It was situated in a grassy little dale, looking as if it had\r\nnever been built like other houses but had grown up there like a big,\r\nbrown mushroom. It was reached by a long, green lane and almost hidden\r\nfrom view by an encircling growth of young birches. No other house\r\ncould be seen from it although the village was just over the hill.\r\nEllen Greene said it was the lonesomest place in the world and vowed\r\nthat she wouldn’t stay there a day if it wasn’t that she pitied the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nEmily didn’t know she was being pitied and didn’t know what\r\nlonesomeness meant. She had plenty of company. There was Father--and\r\nMike--and Saucy Sal. The Wind Woman was always around; and there were\r\nthe trees--Adam-and-Eve, and the Rooster Pine, and all the friendly\r\nlady-birches.\r\n\r\nAnd there was “the flash,” too. She never knew when it might come, and\r\nthe possibility of it kept her a-thrill and expectant.\r\n\r\nEmily had slipped away in the chilly twilight for a walk. She\r\nremembered that walk very vividly all her life--perhaps because of a\r\ncertain eerie beauty that was in it--perhaps because “the flash” came\r\nfor the first time in weeks--more likely because of what happened\r\nafter she came back from it.\r\n\r\nIt had been a dull, cold day in early May, threatening to rain but\r\nnever raining. Father had lain on the sitting-room lounge all day. He\r\nhad coughed a good deal and he had not talked much to Emily, which was\r\na very unusual thing for him. Most of the time he lay with his hands\r\nclasped under his head and his large, sunken, dark-blue eyes fixed\r\ndreamily and unseeingly on the cloudy sky that was visible between the\r\nboughs of the two big spruces in the front yard--Adam-and-Eve, they\r\nalways called those spruces, because of a whimsical resemblance Emily\r\nhad traced between their position, with reference to a small apple-tree\r\nbetween them, and that of Adam and Eve and the Tree of Knowledge in\r\nan old-fashioned picture in one of Ellen Greene’s books. The Tree of\r\nKnowledge looked exactly like the squat little apple-tree, and Adam and\r\nEve stood up on either side as stiffly and rigidly as did the spruces.\r\n\r\nEmily wondered what Father was thinking of, but she never bothered him\r\nwith questions when his cough was bad. She only wished she had somebody\r\nto talk to. Ellen Greene wouldn’t talk that day either. She did nothing\r\nbut grunt, and grunts meant that Ellen was disturbed about something.\r\nShe had grunted last night after the doctor had whispered to her in the\r\nkitchen, and she had grunted when she gave Emily a bedtime snack of\r\nbread and molasses. Emily did not like bread and molasses, but she ate\r\nit because she did not want to hurt Ellen’s feelings. It was not often\r\nthat Ellen allowed her anything to eat before going to bed, and when\r\nshe did it meant that for some reason or other she wanted to confer a\r\nspecial favor.\r\n\r\nEmily expected the grunting attack would wear off over night, as it\r\ngenerally did; but it had not, so no company was to be found in Ellen.\r\nNot that there was a great deal to be found at any time. Douglas Starr\r\nhad once, in a fit of exasperation, told Emily that “Ellen Greene was a\r\nfat, lazy old thing of no importance,” and Emily, whenever she looked\r\nat Ellen after that, thought the description fitted her to a hair.\r\n\r\nSo Emily had curled herself up in the ragged, comfortable old\r\nwing-chair and read _The Pilgrim’s Progress_ all the afternoon. Emily\r\nloved _The Pilgrim’s Progress_. Many a time had she walked the straight\r\nand narrow path with _Christian_ and _Christiana_--although she never\r\nliked _Christiana’s_ adventures half as well as _Christian’s_. For one\r\nthing, there was always such a crowd with _Christiana_. She had not\r\nhalf the fascination of that solitary, intrepid figure who faced all\r\nalone the shadows of the Dark Valley and the encounter with Apollyon.\r\nDarkness and hobgoblins were nothing when you had plenty of company.\r\nBut to be _alone_--ah, Emily shivered with the delicious horror of it!\r\n\r\nWhen Ellen announced that supper was ready Douglas Starr told Emily to\r\ngo out to it.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want anything tonight. I’ll just lie here and rest. And when\r\nyou come in again we’ll have a real talk, Elfkin.”\r\n\r\nHe smiled up at her his old, beautiful smile, with the love behind\r\nit, that Emily always found so sweet. She ate her supper quite\r\nhappily--though it wasn’t a good supper. The bread was soggy and her\r\negg was underdone, but for a wonder she was allowed to have both Saucy\r\nSal and Mike sitting, one on each side of her, and Ellen only grunted\r\nwhen Emily fed them wee bits of bread and butter.\r\n\r\nMike had such a cute way of sitting up on his haunches and catching the\r\nbits in his paws, and Saucy Sal had _her_ trick of touching Emily’s\r\nankle with an almost human touch when her turn was too long in coming.\r\nEmily loved them both, but Mike was her favourite. He was a handsome,\r\ndark-grey cat with huge owl-like eyes, and he was so soft and fat and\r\nfluffy. Sal was always thin; no amount of feeding put any flesh on her\r\nbones. Emily liked her, but never cared to cuddle or stroke her because\r\nof her thinness. Yet there was a sort of weird beauty about her that\r\nappealed to Emily. She was grey-and-white--very white and very sleek,\r\nwith a long, pointed face, very long ears and very green eyes. She was\r\na redoubtable fighter, and strange cats were vanquished in one round.\r\nThe fearless little spitfire would even attack dogs and rout them\r\nutterly.\r\n\r\nEmily loved her pussies. She had brought them up herself, as she\r\nproudly said. They had been given to her when they were kittens by her\r\nSunday School teacher.\r\n\r\n“A _living_ present is so nice,” she told Ellen, “because it keeps on\r\ngetting nicer all the time.”\r\n\r\nBut she worried considerably because Saucy Sal didn’t have kittens.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know why she doesn’t,” she complained to Ellen Greene. “Most\r\ncats seem to have more kittens than they know what to do with.”\r\n\r\nAfter supper Emily went in and found that her father had fallen\r\nasleep. She was very glad of this; she knew he had not slept much\r\nfor two nights; but she was a little disappointed that they were not\r\ngoing to have that “real talk.” “Real” talks with Father were always\r\nsuch delightful things. But next best would be a walk--a lovely\r\nall-by-your-lonesome walk through the grey evening of the young spring.\r\nIt was so long since she had had a walk.\r\n\r\n“You put on your hood and mind you scoot back if it starts to rain,”\r\nwarned Ellen. “_You_ can’t monkey with colds the way some kids can.”\r\n\r\n“Why can’t I?” Emily asked rather indignantly. Why must _she_ be\r\ndebarred from “monkeying with colds” if other children could? It wasn’t\r\nfair.\r\n\r\nBut Ellen only grunted. Emily muttered under her breath for her own\r\nsatisfaction, “You are a fat old thing of no importance!” and slipped\r\nupstairs to get her hood--rather reluctantly, for she loved to run\r\nbareheaded. She put the faded blue hood on over her long, heavy braid\r\nof glossy, jet-black hair, and smiled chummily at her reflection in the\r\nlittle greenish glass. The smile began at the corners of her lips and\r\nspread over her face in a slow, subtle, very wonderful way, as Douglas\r\nStarr often thought. It was her dead mother’s smile--the thing that had\r\ncaught and held him long ago when he had first seen Juliet Murray. It\r\nseemed to be Emily’s only physical inheritance from her mother. In all\r\nelse, he thought, she was like the Starrs--in her large, purplish-grey\r\neyes with their very long lashes and black brows, in her high, white\r\nforehead--too high for beauty--in the delicate modeling of her pale\r\noval face and sensitive mouth, in the little ears that were pointed\r\njust a wee bit to show that she was kin to tribes of elfland.\r\n\r\n“I’m going for a walk with the Wind Woman, dear,” said Emily. “I wish\r\nI could take you too. Do you _ever_ get out of that room, I wonder.\r\nThe Wind Woman is going to be out in the fields to-night. She is tall\r\nand misty, with thin, grey, silky clothes blowing all about her--and\r\nwings like a bat’s--only you can see through them--and shining eyes\r\nlike stars looking through her long, loose hair. She can fly--but\r\nto-night she will walk with me all over the fields. She’s a _great_\r\nfriend of mine--the Wind Woman is. I’ve known her ever since I was six.\r\nWe’re _old, old_ friends--but not quite so old as you and I, little\r\nEmily-in-the-glass. We’ve been friends _always_, haven’t we?”\r\n\r\nWith a blown kiss to little Emily-in-the-glass, Emily-out-of-the-glass\r\nwas off.\r\n\r\nThe Wind Woman was waiting for her outside--ruffling the little spears\r\nof striped grass that were sticking up stiffly in the bed under the\r\nsitting-room window--tossing the big boughs of Adam-and-Eve--whispering\r\namong the misty green branches of the birches--teasing the “Rooster\r\nPine” behind the house--it really did look like an enormous,\r\nridiculous rooster, with a huge, bunchy tail and a head thrown back to\r\ncrow.\r\n\r\nIt was so long since Emily had been out for a walk that she was half\r\ncrazy with the joy of it. The winter had been so stormy and the snow\r\nso deep that she was never allowed out; April had been a month of rain\r\nand wind; so on this May evening she felt like a released prisoner.\r\nWhere should she go? Down the brook--or over the fields to the spruce\r\nbarrens? Emily chose the latter.\r\n\r\nShe loved the spruce barrens, away at the further end of the long,\r\nsloping pasture. That was a place where magic was made. She came more\r\nfully into her fairy birthright there than in any other place. Nobody\r\nwho saw Emily skimming over the bare field would have envied her.\r\nShe was little and pale and poorly clad; sometimes she shivered in\r\nher thin jacket; yet a queen might have gladly given a crown for her\r\nvisions--her dreams of wonder. The brown, frosted grasses under her\r\nfeet were velvet piles. The old, mossy, gnarled half-dead spruce-tree,\r\nunder which she paused for a moment to look up into the sky, was a\r\nmarble column in a palace of the gods; the far dusky hills were the\r\nramparts of a city of wonder. And for companions she had all the\r\nfairies of the countryside--for she could believe in them here--the\r\nfairies of the white clover and satin catkins, the little green folk of\r\nthe grass, the elves of the young fir-trees, sprites of wind and wild\r\nfern and thistledown. Anything might happen there--everything might\r\ncome true.\r\n\r\nAnd the barrens were such a splendid place in which to play hide and\r\nseek with the Wind Woman. She was so very _real_ there; if you could\r\njust spring quickly enough around a little cluster of spruces--only\r\nyou never could--you would _see_ her as well as feel her and hear her.\r\nThere she was--that _was_ the sweep of her grey cloak--no, she was\r\nlaughing up in the very top of the taller trees--and the chase was on\r\nagain--till, all at once, it seemed as if the Wind Woman were gone--and\r\nthe evening was bathed in a wonderful silence--and there was a sudden\r\nrift in the curdled clouds westward, and a lovely, pale, pinky-green\r\nlake of sky with a new moon in it.\r\n\r\nEmily stood and looked at it with clasped hands and her little black\r\nhead upturned. She must go home and write down a description of it in\r\nthe yellow account book, where the last thing written had been, “Mike’s\r\nBiograffy.” It would hurt her with its beauty until she wrote it down.\r\nThen she would read it to Father. She must not forget how the tips of\r\nthe trees on the hill came out like fine black lace across the edge of\r\nthe pinky-green sky.\r\n\r\nAnd then, for one glorious, supreme moment, came “the flash.”\r\n\r\nEmily called it that, although she felt that the name didn’t exactly\r\ndescribe it. It couldn’t be described--not even to Father, who always\r\nseemed a little puzzled by it. Emily never spoke of it to any one else.\r\n\r\nIt had always seemed to Emily, ever since she could remember, that she\r\nwas very, very near to a world of wonderful beauty. Between it and\r\nherself hung only a thin curtain; she could never draw the curtain\r\naside--but sometimes, just for a moment, a wind fluttered it and then\r\nit was as if she caught a glimpse of the enchanting realm beyond--only\r\na glimpse--and heard a note of unearthly music.\r\n\r\nThis moment came rarely--went swiftly, leaving her breathless with the\r\ninexpressible delight of it. She could never recall it--never summon\r\nit--never pretend it; but the wonder of it stayed with her for days.\r\nIt never came twice with the same thing. To-night the dark boughs\r\nagainst that far-off sky had given it. It had come with a high, wild\r\nnote of wind in the night, with a shadow wave over a ripe field, with a\r\ngreybird lighting on her window-sill in a storm, with the singing of\r\n“Holy, holy, holy” in church, with a glimpse of the kitchen fire when\r\nshe had come home on a dark autumn night, with the spirit-like blue of\r\nice palms on a twilit pane, with a felicitous new word when she was\r\nwriting down a “description” of something. And always when the flash\r\ncame to her Emily felt that life was a wonderful, mysterious thing of\r\npersistent beauty.\r\n\r\nShe scuttled back to the house in the hollow, through the gathering\r\ntwilight, all agog to get home and write down her “description” before\r\nthe memory picture of what she had seen grew a little blurred. She knew\r\njust how she would begin it--the sentence seemed to shape itself in her\r\nmind: “The hill called to me and something in me called back to it.”\r\n\r\nShe found Ellen Greene waiting for her on the sunken front-doorstep.\r\nEmily was so full of happiness that she loved everything at that\r\nmoment, even fat things of no importance. She flung her arms around\r\nEllen’s knees and hugged them. Ellen looked down gloomily into the rapt\r\nlittle face, where excitement had kindled a faint wild-rose flush, and\r\nsaid, with a ponderous sigh:\r\n\r\n“Do you know that your pa has only a week or two more to live?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nA WATCH IN THE NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nEmily stood quite still and looked up at Ellen’s broad, red face--as\r\nstill as if she had been suddenly turned to stone. She felt as if she\r\nhad. She was as stunned as if Ellen had struck her a physical blow. The\r\ncolour faded out of her little face and her pupils dilated until they\r\nswallowed up the irides and turned her eyes into pools of blackness.\r\nThe effect was so startling that even Ellen Greene felt uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n“I’m telling you this because I think it’s high time you was told,”\r\nshe said. “I’ve been at your pa for months to tell you, but he’s kept\r\nputting it off and off. I says to him, says I, ‘You know how hard she\r\ntakes things, and if you drop off suddent some day it’ll most kill\r\nher if she hasn’t been prepared. It’s your duty to prepare her,’ and\r\nhe says, says he, ‘There’s time enough yet, Ellen.’ But he’s never\r\nsaid a word, and when the doctor told me last night that the end might\r\ncome any time now, I just made up my mind that _I_’d do what was right\r\nand drop a hint to prepare you. Laws-a-massy, child, don’t look like\r\nthat! You’ll be looked after. Your ma’s people will see to that--on\r\naccount of the Murray pride, if for no other reason. They won’t let\r\none of their own blood starve or go to strangers--even if they have\r\nalways hated your pa like p’isen. You’ll have a good home--better’n\r\nyou’ve ever had here. You needn’t worry a mite. As for your pa, you\r\nought to be thankful to see him at rest. He’s been dying by inches\r\nfor the last five years. He’s kept it from you, but he’s been a great\r\nsufferer. Folks say his heart broke when your ma died--it came on him\r\nso suddent-like--she was only sick three days. That’s why I want you to\r\nknow what’s coming, so’s you won’t be all upset when it happens. For\r\nmercy’s sake, Emily Byrd Starr, don’t stand there staring like that!\r\nYou give me the creeps! You ain’t the first child that’s been left an\r\norphan and you won’t be the last. Try and be sensible. And don’t go\r\npestering your pa about what I’ve told you, mind that. Come you in now,\r\nout of the damp, and I’ll give you a cooky ’fore you go to bed.”\r\n\r\nEllen stepped down as if to take the child’s hand. The power of motion\r\nreturned to Emily--she must scream if Ellen even touched her _now_.\r\nWith one sudden, sharp, bitter little cry she avoided Ellen’s hand,\r\ndarted through the door and fled up the dark staircase.\r\n\r\nEllen shook her head and waddled back to her kitchen.\r\n\r\n“Anyhow, I’ve done _my_ duty,” she reflected. “He’d have just kept\r\nsaying ‘time enough’ and put it off till he was dead and then there’d\r\nhave been no managing her. She’ll have time now to get used to it,\r\nand she’ll brace up in a day or two. I will say for her she’s got\r\nspunk--which is lucky, from all I’ve heard of the Murrays. They won’t\r\nfind it easy to overcrow _her_. She’s got a streak of their pride, too,\r\nand that’ll help her through. I wish I dared send some of the Murrays\r\nword that he’s dying, but I don’t dast go that far. There’s no telling\r\nwhat _he_’d do. Well, I’ve stuck on here to the last and I ain’t sorry.\r\nNot many women would ’a’ done it, living as they do here. It’s a shame\r\nthe way that child’s been brought up--never even sent to school. Well,\r\nI’ve told him often enough what I’ve thought of it--it ain’t on _my_\r\nconscience, that’s one comfort. Here, you Sal-thing, you git out!\r\nWhere’s Mike, too?”\r\n\r\nEllen could not find Mike for the very good reason that he was upstairs\r\nwith Emily, held tightly in her arms, as she sat in the darkness on\r\nher little cot bed. Amid her agony and desolation there was a certain\r\ncomfort in the feel of his soft fur and round velvety head.\r\n\r\nEmily was not crying; she stared straight into the darkness, trying\r\nto face the awful thing Ellen had told her. She did not doubt\r\nit--something told her it was true. Why couldn’t she die, too? She\r\ncouldn’t go on living without Father.\r\n\r\n“If I was God I wouldn’t let things like this happen,” she said.\r\n\r\nShe felt it was very wicked of her to say such a thing--Ellen had told\r\nher once that it was the wickedest thing any one could do to find fault\r\nwith God. But she didn’t care. Perhaps if she were wicked enough God\r\nwould strike her dead and then she and Father could keep on being\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nBut nothing happened--only Mike got tired of being held so tightly\r\nand squirmed away. She was all alone now, with this terrible burning\r\npain that seemed all over her and yet was not of the body. She could\r\nnever get rid of it. She couldn’t help it by writing about it in the\r\nold yellow account book. She had written there about her Sunday School\r\nteacher going away, and of being hungry when she went to bed, and Ellen\r\ntelling her she must be half crazy to talk of Wind Women and flashes;\r\nand after she had written down all about them these things hadn’t hurt\r\nher any more. But this couldn’t be written about. She could not even\r\ngo to Father for comfort, as she had gone when she burned her hand so\r\nbadly, picking up the red-hot poker by mistake. Father had held her in\r\nhis arms all that night and told her stories and helped her to bear the\r\npain. But Father, so Ellen had said, was going to die in a week or two.\r\nEmily felt as if Ellen had told her this years and years ago. It surely\r\ncouldn’t be less than an hour since she had been playing with the Wind\r\nWoman in the barrens and looking at the new moon in the pinky-green sky.\r\n\r\n“The flash will never come again--it can’t,” she thought.\r\n\r\nBut Emily had inherited certain things from her fine old ancestors--the\r\npower to fight--to suffer--to pity--to love very deeply--to rejoice--to\r\nendure. These things were all in her and looked out at you through her\r\npurplish-grey eyes. Her heritage of endurance came to her aid now and\r\nbore her up. She must not let Father know what Ellen had told her--it\r\nmight hurt him. She must keep it all to herself and _love_ Father, oh,\r\nso much, in the little while she could yet have him.\r\n\r\nShe heard him cough in the room below: she must be in bed when he came\r\nup; she undressed as swiftly as her cold fingers permitted and crept\r\ninto the little cot bed which stood across the open window. The voices\r\nof the gentle spring night called to her all unheeded--unheard the Wind\r\nWoman whistled by the eaves. For the fairies dwell only in the kingdom\r\nof Happiness; having no souls they cannot enter the kingdom of Sorrow.\r\n\r\nShe lay there cold and tearless and motionless when her father came\r\ninto the room. How very slowly he walked--how very slowly he took off\r\nhis clothes. How was it she had never noticed these things before? But\r\nhe was not coughing at all. Oh, what if Ellen were mistaken?--what\r\nif--a wild hope shot through her aching heart. She gave a little gasp.\r\n\r\nDouglas Starr came over to her bed. She felt his dear nearness as\r\nhe sat down on the chair beside her, in his old red dressing-gown.\r\nOh, how she loved him! There was no other Father like him in all the\r\nworld--there never could have been--so tender, so understanding, so\r\nwonderful! They had always been such chums--they had loved each other\r\nso much--it couldn’t be that they were to be separated.\r\n\r\n“Winkums, are you asleep?”\r\n\r\n“No,” whispered Emily.\r\n\r\n“Are you sleepy, small dear?”\r\n\r\n“No--no--not sleepy.”\r\n\r\nDouglas Starr took her hand and held it tightly.\r\n\r\n“Then we’ll have our talk, honey. I can’t sleep either. I want to tell\r\nyou something.”\r\n\r\n“Oh--I know it--I know it!” burst out Emily. “Oh, Father, I know it!\r\nEllen told me.”\r\n\r\nDouglas Starr was silent for a moment. Then he said under his breath,\r\n“The old fool--the _fat_ old fool!”--as if Ellen’s fatness was an\r\nadded aggravation of her folly. Again, for the last time, Emily hoped.\r\nPerhaps it was all a dreadful mistake--just some more of Ellen’s fat\r\nfoolishness.\r\n\r\n“It--it isn’t true, is it, Father?” she whispered.\r\n\r\n“Emily, child,” said her father, “I can’t lift you up--I haven’t the\r\nstrength--but climb up and sit on my knee--in the old way.”\r\n\r\nEmily slipped out of bed and got on her father’s knee. He wrapped the\r\nold dressing-gown about her and held her close with his face against\r\nhers.\r\n\r\n“Dear little child--little beloved Emilykin, it is quite true,” he\r\nsaid, “I meant to tell you myself to-night. And now that old absurdity\r\nof an Ellen has told you--brutally, I suppose--and hurt you dreadfully.\r\nShe has the brain of a hen and the sensibility of a cow. May jackals\r\nsit on her grandmother’s grave! _I_ wouldn’t have hurt you, dear.”\r\n\r\nEmily fought something down that wanted to choke her.\r\n\r\n“Father, I can’t--I can’t bear it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you can and will. You will live because there is something for\r\nyou to do, I think. You have my gift--along with something I never\r\nhad. You will succeed where I failed, Emily. I haven’t been able to do\r\nmuch for you, sweetheart, but I’ve done what I could. I’ve taught you\r\nsomething, I think--in spite of Ellen Greene. Emily, do you remember\r\nyour mother?”\r\n\r\n“Just a little--here and there--like lovely bits of dreams.”\r\n\r\n“You were only four when she died. I’ve never talked much to you about\r\nher--I couldn’t. But I’m going to tell you all about her to-night. It\r\ndoesn’t hurt me to talk of her now--I’ll see her so soon again. You\r\ndon’t look like her, Emily--only when you smile. For the rest, you’re\r\nlike your namesake, my mother. When you were born I wanted to call you\r\nJuliet, too. But your mother wouldn’t. She said if we called you Juliet\r\nthen I’d soon take to calling her ‘Mother’ to distinguish between you,\r\nand she couldn’t endure _that_. She said her Aunt Nancy had once said\r\nto her, ‘The first time your husband calls you “Mother” the romance of\r\nlife is over.’ So we called you after my mother--_her_ maiden name\r\nwas Emily Byrd. Your mother thought Emily the prettiest name in the\r\nworld,--it was quaint and arch and delightful, she said. Emily, your\r\nmother was the sweetest woman ever made.”\r\n\r\nHis voice trembled and Emily snuggled close.\r\n\r\n“I met her twelve years ago, when I was sub-editor of the _Enterprise_\r\nup in Charlottetown and she was in her last year at Queen’s. She was\r\ntall and fair and blue-eyed. She looked a little like your Aunt Laura,\r\nbut Laura was never so pretty. Their eyes were very much alike--and\r\ntheir voices. She was one of the Murrays from Blair Water. I’ve never\r\ntold you much about your mother’s people, Emily. They live up on the\r\nold north shore at Blair Water on New Moon Farm--always have lived\r\nthere since the first Murray came out from the Old Country in 1790. The\r\nship he came on was called the _New Moon_ and he named his farm after\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a nice name--the new moon is such a pretty thing,” said Emily,\r\ninterested for a moment.\r\n\r\n“There’s been a Murray ever since at New Moon Farm. They’re a proud\r\nfamily--the Murray pride is a byword along the north shore, Emily.\r\nWell, they had some things to be proud of, that cannot be denied--but\r\nthey carried it too far. Folks call them ‘the chosen people’ up there.\r\n\r\n“They increased and multiplied and scattered all over, but the old\r\nstock at New Moon Farm is pretty well run out. Only your Aunts,\r\nElizabeth and Laura, live there now, and their cousin, Jimmy Murray.\r\nThey never married--could not find any one good enough for a Murray, so\r\nit used to be said. Your Uncle Oliver and your Uncle Wallace live in\r\nSummerside, your Aunt Ruth in Shrewsbury and your Great-Aunt Nancy at\r\nPriest Pond.”\r\n\r\n“Priest Pond--that’s an _interesting_ name--not a pretty name like New\r\nMoon and Blair Water--but interesting,” said Emily. Feeling Father’s\r\narm around her the horror had momentarily shrunk away. For just a\r\nlittle while she ceased to believe it.\r\n\r\nDouglas Starr tucked the dressing-gown a little more closely around\r\nher, kissed her black head, and went on.\r\n\r\n“Elizabeth and Laura and Wallace and Oliver and Ruth were old Archibald\r\nMurray’s children. His first wife was their mother. When he was sixty\r\nhe married again--a young slip of a girl--who died when your mother\r\nwas born. Juliet was twenty years younger than her half-family, as she\r\nused to call them. She was very pretty and charming and they all loved\r\nand petted her and were very proud of her. When she fell in love with\r\nme, a poor young journalist, with nothing in the world but his pen and\r\nhis ambition, there was a family earthquake. The Murray pride couldn’t\r\ntolerate the thing at all. I won’t rake it all up--but things were said\r\nI could never forget or forgive. Your mother married me, Emily--and the\r\nNew Moon people would have nothing more to do with her. Can you believe\r\nthat, in spite of it, she was never sorry for marrying me?”\r\n\r\nEmily put up her hand and patted her father’s hollow cheek.\r\n\r\n“_Of course_ she wouldn’t be sorry. _Of course_ she’d rather have you\r\nthan all the Murrays of any kind of a moon.”\r\n\r\nFather laughed a little--and there was just a note of triumph in his\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n“Yes, she seemed to feel that way about it. And we were so happy--oh,\r\nEmilykin, there never were two happier people in the world. You were\r\nthe child of that happiness. I remember the night you were born in\r\nthe little house in Charlottetown. It was in May and a west wind was\r\nblowing silvery clouds over the moon. There was a star or two here\r\nand there. In our tiny garden--everything we had was small except our\r\nlove and our happiness--it was dark and blossomy. I walked up and\r\ndown the path between the beds of violets your mother had planted--and\r\nprayed. The pale east was just beginning to glow like a rosy pearl\r\nwhen some one came and told me I had a little daughter. I went\r\nin--and your mother, white and weak, smiled just that dear, slow,\r\nwonderful smile I loved, and said, ‘We’ve--got--the only--baby--of any\r\nimportance--in--the world, dear. Just--think--of that!’”\r\n\r\n“I wish people could remember from the very moment they’re born,” said\r\nEmily. “It would be so very interesting.”\r\n\r\n“I dare say we’d have a lot of uncomfortable memories,” said her\r\nfather, laughing a little. “It can’t be very pleasant getting used to\r\nliving--no pleasanter than getting used to stopping it. But you didn’t\r\nseem to find it hard, for you were a good wee kidlet, Emily. We had\r\nfour more happy years and then--do you remember the time your mother\r\ndied, Emily?”\r\n\r\n“I remember the funeral, Father--I remember it _distinctly_. You were\r\nstanding in the middle of a room, holding me in your arms, and Mother\r\nwas lying just before us in a long, black box. And you were crying--and\r\nI couldn’t think why--and I wondered why Mother looked so white and\r\nwouldn’t open her eyes. And I leaned down and touched her cheek--and\r\noh, it was so cold. It made me shiver. And somebody in the room said,\r\n‘Poor little thing!’ and I was frightened and put my face down on your\r\nshoulder.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I recall that. Your mother died very suddenly. I don’t think\r\nwe’ll talk about it. The Murrays all came to her funeral. The Murrays\r\nhave certain traditions and they live up to them very strictly. One\r\nof them is that nothing but candles shall be burned for light at New\r\nMoon--and another is that no quarrel must be carried past the grave.\r\nThey came when she was dead--they would have come when she was ill if\r\nthey had known, I will say that much for them. And they behaved very\r\nwell--oh, very well indeed. They were not the Murrays of New Moon for\r\nnothing. Your Aunt Elizabeth wore her best black satin dress to the\r\nfuneral. For any funeral but a Murray’s the second best one would\r\nhave done; and they made no serious objection when I said your mother\r\nwould be buried in the Starr plot in Charlottetown cemetery. They\r\nwould have liked to take her back to the old Murray burying-ground in\r\nBlair Water--they had their own private burying-ground, you know--no\r\nindiscriminate graveyard for _them_. But your Uncle Wallace handsomely\r\nadmitted that a woman should belong to her husband’s family in death as\r\nin life. And then they offered to take you and bring you up--to ‘give\r\nyou your mother’s place.’ I refused to let them have you--then. Did I\r\ndo right, Emily?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--yes--yes!” whispered Emily, with a hug at every “yes.”\r\n\r\n“I told Oliver Murray--it was he who spoke to me about you--that as\r\nlong as I lived I would not be parted from my child. He said, ‘If you\r\never change your mind, let us know.’ But I did not change my mind--not\r\neven three years later when my doctor told me I must give up work.\r\n‘If you don’t, I give you a year,’ he said, ‘if you do, and live\r\nout-of-doors all you can, I give you three--or possibly four.’ He was a\r\ngood prophet. I came out here and we’ve had four lovely years together,\r\nhaven’t we, small dear one?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--oh, yes!”\r\n\r\n“Those years and what I’ve taught you in them are the only legacy I\r\ncan leave you, Emily. We’ve been living on a tiny income I have from\r\na life interest that was left me in an old uncle’s estate--an uncle\r\nwho died before I was married. The estate goes to a charity now, and\r\nthis little house is only a rented one. From a worldly point of view\r\nI’ve certainly been a failure. But your mother’s people will care for\r\nyou--I know that. The Murray pride will guarantee so much, if nothing\r\nelse. And they can’t help loving you. Perhaps I should have sent for\r\nthem before--perhaps I ought to do it yet. But I have pride of a kind,\r\ntoo--the Starrs are not entirely traditionless--and the Murrays said\r\nsome very bitter things to me when I married your mother. Will I send\r\nto New Moon and ask them to come, Emily?”\r\n\r\n“No!” said Emily, almost fiercely.\r\n\r\nShe did not want any one to come between her and Father for the few\r\nprecious days left. The thought was horrible to her. It would be bad\r\nenough if they had to come--afterwards. But she would not mind anything\r\nmuch--then.\r\n\r\n“We’ll stay together to the very end, then, little Emily-child. We\r\nwon’t be parted for a minute. And I want you to be brave. You mustn’t\r\nbe afraid of _anything_, Emily. Death isn’t terrible. The universe is\r\nfull of love--and spring comes everywhere--and in death you open and\r\nshut a door. There are beautiful things on the other side of the door.\r\nI’ll find your mother there--I’ve doubted many things, but I’ve never\r\ndoubted _that_. Sometimes I’ve been afraid that she would get so far\r\nahead of me in the ways of eternity that I’d never catch up. But I\r\nfeel _now_ that she’s waiting for me. And we’ll wait for you--we won’t\r\nhurry--we’ll loiter and linger till you catch up with us.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you--could take me right through the door with you,” whispered\r\nEmily.\r\n\r\n“After a little while you won’t wish that. You have yet to learn how\r\nkind time is. And life has something for you--I feel it. Go forward to\r\nmeet it fearlessly, dear. I know you don’t feel like that just now--but\r\nyou will remember my words by and by.”\r\n\r\n“I feel just now,” said Emily, who couldn’t bear to hide anything from\r\nFather, “that I don’t like God any more.”\r\n\r\nDouglas Starr laughed--the laugh Emily liked best. It was such a dear\r\nlaugh--she caught her breath over the dearness of it. She felt his\r\narms tightening round her.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you do, honey. You can’t help liking God. He is Love itself, you\r\nknow. You mustn’t mix Him up with Ellen Greene’s God, of course.”\r\n\r\nEmily didn’t know exactly what Father meant. But all at once she found\r\nthat she wasn’t afraid any longer--and the bitterness had gone out of\r\nher sorrow, and the unbearable pain out of her heart. She felt as if\r\nlove was all about her and around her, breathed out from some great,\r\ninvisible, hovering Tenderness. One couldn’t be afraid or bitter\r\nwhere love was--and love was everywhere. Father was going through the\r\ndoor--no, he was going to lift a curtain--she liked _that_ thought\r\nbetter, because a curtain wasn’t as hard and fast as a door--and he\r\nwould slip into that world of which the flash had given her glimpses.\r\nHe would be there in its beauty--never very far away from her. She\r\ncould bear anything if she could only feel that Father wasn’t very far\r\naway from her--just beyond that wavering curtain.\r\n\r\nDouglas Starr held her until she fell asleep; and then in spite of his\r\nweakness he managed to lay her down in her little bed.\r\n\r\n“She will love deeply--she will suffer terribly--she will have glorious\r\nmoments to compensate--as I have had. As her mother’s people deal with\r\nher, so may God deal with them,” he murmured brokenly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nA HOP OUT OF KIN\r\n\r\n\r\nDouglas Starr lived two weeks more. In after years when the pain\r\nhad gone out of their recollection, Emily thought they were the\r\nmost precious of her memories. They were beautiful weeks--beautiful\r\nand not sad. And one night, when he was lying on the couch in the\r\nsitting-room, with Emily beside him in the old wing-chair, he went past\r\nthe curtain--went so quietly and easily that Emily did not know he was\r\ngone until she suddenly felt the strange _stillness_ of the room--there\r\nwas no breathing in it but her own.\r\n\r\n“Father--Father!” she cried. Then she screamed for Ellen.\r\n\r\nEllen Greene told the Murrays when they came that Emily had behaved\r\nreal well, when you took everything into account. To be sure, she had\r\ncried all night and hadn’t slept a wink; none of the Maywood people who\r\ncame flocking kindly in to help could comfort her; but when morning\r\ncame her tears were all shed. She was pale and quiet and docile.\r\n\r\n“That’s right, now,” said Ellen, “that’s what comes of being properly\r\nprepared. Your pa was so mad at me for warning you that he wasn’t\r\nrightly civil to me since--and him a dying man. But I don’t hold any\r\ngrudge against him. _I_ did my duty. Mrs. Hubbard’s fixing up a black\r\ndress for you and it’ll be ready by supper time. Your ma’s people will\r\nbe here tonight, so they’ve telegraphed, and I’m bound they’ll find you\r\nlooking respectable. They’re well off and they’ll provide for you. Your\r\npa hasn’t left a cent but there ain’t any debts, I’ll say _that_ for\r\nhim. Have you been in to see the body?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t call him _that_,” cried Emily, wincing. It was horrible to hear\r\nFather called _that_.\r\n\r\n“Why not? If you ain’t the queerest child! He makes a better looking\r\ncorpse than I thought he would, what with being so wasted and all. He\r\nwas always a pretty man, though too thin.”\r\n\r\n“Ellen Greene,” said Emily suddenly, “if you say any more of--those\r\nthings--about Father, I will put the black curse on you!”\r\n\r\nEllen Greene stared.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what on earth you mean. But that’s no way to talk to me,\r\nafter all I’ve done for you. You’d better not let the Murrays hear you\r\ntalking like that or they won’t want much to do with you. The black\r\ncurse indeed! Well, here’s gratitude!”\r\n\r\nEmily’s eyes smarted. She was just a lonely, solitary little creature\r\nand she felt very friendless. But she was not at all remorseful for\r\nwhat she had said to Ellen and she was not going to pretend she was.\r\n\r\n“Come you here and help me wash these dishes,” ordered Ellen. “It’ll\r\ndo you good to have something to take up your mind and then you won’t\r\nbe after putting curses on people who have worked their fingers to the\r\nbone for you.”\r\n\r\nEmily, with an eloquent glance at Ellen’s hands, went and got the dish\r\ntowel.\r\n\r\n“Your hands are fat and pudgy,” she said. “The bones don’t show at all.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind sassing back! It’s awful, with your poor pa dead in there.\r\nBut if your Aunt Ruth takes you she’ll soon cure you of that.”\r\n\r\n“Is Aunt Ruth going to take me?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, but she ought to. She’s a widow with no chick or child,\r\nand well-to-do.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think I want Aunt Ruth to take me,” said Emily deliberately,\r\nafter a moment’s reflection.\r\n\r\n“Well, _you_ won’t have the choosing likely. You ought to be thankful\r\nto get a home anywhere. Remember you’re not of much importance.”\r\n\r\n“I am important to myself,” cried Emily proudly.\r\n\r\n“It’ll be some chore to bring _you_ up,” muttered Ellen. “Your Aunt\r\nRuth is the one to do it, in my opinion. _She_ won’t stand no nonsense.\r\nA fine woman she is and the neatest housekeeper on P. E. Island. You\r\ncould eat off her floor.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to eat off her floor. I don’t care if a floor is dirty as\r\nlong as the tablecloth is clean.”\r\n\r\n“Well, her tablecloths are clean too, I reckon. She’s got an elegant\r\nhouse in Shrewsbury with bow windows and wooden lace all round the\r\nroof. It’s very stylish. It would be a fine home for you. She’d learn\r\nyou some sense and do you a world of good.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to learn sense and be done a world of good to,” cried\r\nEmily with a quivering lip. “I--I want somebody to love me.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you’ve got to behave yourself if you want people to like you.\r\nYou’re not to blame so much--your pa has spoiled you. I told him so\r\noften enough, but he just laughed. I hope he ain’t sorry for it now.\r\nThe fact is, Emily Starr, you’re queer, and folks don’t care for queer\r\nchildren.”\r\n\r\n“How am I queer?” demanded Emily.\r\n\r\n“You talk queer--and you act queer--and at times you look queer.\r\nAnd you’re too old for your age--though that ain’t _your_ fault. It\r\ncomes of never mixing with other children. I’ve always threaped at\r\nyour father to send you to school--learning at home ain’t the same\r\nthing--but he wouldn’t listen to me, of course. I don’t say but what\r\nyou are as far along in book learning as you need to be, but what you\r\nwant is to learn how to be like other children. In one way it would\r\nbe a good thing if your Uncle Oliver would take you, for he’s got a\r\nbig family. But he’s not as well off as the rest, so it ain’t likely\r\nhe will. Your Uncle Wallace might, seeing as he reckons himself the\r\nhead of the family. He’s only got a grown-up daughter. But his wife’s\r\ndelicate--or fancies she is.”\r\n\r\n“I wish Aunt Laura would take me,” said Emily. She remembered that\r\nFather had said Aunt Laura was something like her mother.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Laura! _She_ won’t have no say in it--Elizabeth’s boss at New\r\nMoon. Jimmy Murray runs the farm, but he ain’t quite all there, I’m\r\ntold--”\r\n\r\n“What part of him isn’t there?” asked Emily curiously.\r\n\r\n“Laws, it’s something about his mind, child. He’s a bit simple--some\r\naccident or other when he was a youngster, I’ve heard. It addled his\r\nhead, kind of. Elizabeth was mixed up in it some way--I’ve never heard\r\nthe rights of it. I don’t reckon the New Moon people will want to be\r\nbothered with you. They’re awful set in their ways. You take my advice\r\nand try to please your Aunt Ruth. Be polite--and well-behaved--mebbe\r\nshe’ll take a fancy to you. There, that’s all the dishes. You’d better\r\ngo upstairs and be out of the way.”\r\n\r\n“Can I take Mike and Saucy Sal?” asked Emily.\r\n\r\n“No, you can’t.”\r\n\r\n“They’d be company for me,” pleaded Emily.\r\n\r\n“Company or no company, you can’t have them. They’re outside and\r\nthey’ll stay outside. I ain’t going to have them tracking all over the\r\nhouse. The floor’s been scrubbed.”\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you scrub the floor when Father was alive?” asked Emily.\r\n“He liked things to be clean. You hardly ever scrubbed it then. Why do\r\nyou do it now?”\r\n\r\n“Listen to her! Was I to be always scrubbing floors with my rheumatiz?\r\nGet off upstairs and you’d better lie down awhile.”\r\n\r\n“I’m going upstairs, but I’m not going to lie down,” said Emily. “I’ve\r\ngot a lot of thinking to do.”\r\n\r\n“There’s one thing I’d advise you to do,” said Ellen, determined to\r\nlose no chance of doing her duty, “and that is to kneel down and pray\r\nto God to make you a good and respectful and grateful child.”\r\n\r\nEmily paused at the foot of the stairs and looked back.\r\n\r\n“Father said I wasn’t to have anything to do with your God,” she said\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\nEllen gasped foolishly, but could not think of any reply to this\r\nheathenish statement. She appealed to the universe.\r\n\r\n“Did any one ever hear the like!”\r\n\r\n“I know what _your_ God is like,” said Emily. “I saw His picture in\r\nthat Adam-and-Eve book of yours. He has whiskers and wears a nightgown.\r\nI don’t like Him. But I like Father’s God.”\r\n\r\n“And what is your father’s God like, if I may ask?” demanded Ellen\r\nsarcastically.\r\n\r\nEmily hadn’t any idea what Father’s God was like, but she was\r\ndetermined not to be posed by Ellen.\r\n\r\n“He is clear as the moon, fair as the sun, and terrible as an army with\r\nbanners,” she said triumphantly.\r\n\r\n“Well, you’re bound to have the last word, but the Murrays will teach\r\nyou what’s what,” said Ellen, giving up the argument. “They’re strict\r\nPresbyterians and won’t hold by any of your father’s awful notions. Get\r\noff upstairs.”\r\n\r\nEmily went up to the south room, feeling very desolate.\r\n\r\n“There isn’t anybody in the world who loves me now,” she said, as\r\nshe curled up on her bed by the window. But she was determined she\r\nwould not cry. The Murrays, who had hated her father, should not see\r\nher crying. She felt that she detested them all--except perhaps Aunt\r\nLaura. How very big and empty the world had suddenly become. Nothing\r\nwas interesting any more. It did not matter that the little squat\r\napple-tree between Adam-and-Eve had become a thing of rose-and-snow\r\nbeauty--that the hills beyond the hollow were of green silk,\r\npurple-misted--that the daffodils were out in the garden--that the\r\nbirches were hung all over with golden tassels--that the Wind Woman was\r\nblowing white young clouds across the sky. None of these things had any\r\ncharm or consolation for her now. In her inexperience she believed they\r\nnever would have again.\r\n\r\n“But I promised Father I’d be brave,” she whispered, clenching her\r\nlittle fists, “and I will. And I _won’t_ let the Murrays see I’m afraid\r\nof them--I won’t _be_ afraid of them!”\r\n\r\nWhen the far-off whistle of the afternoon train blew beyond the hills,\r\nEmily’s heart began to beat. She clasped her hands and lifted her face.\r\n\r\n“Please help me, Father’s God--_not_ Ellen’s God,” she said. “Help me\r\nto be brave and not cry before the Murrays.”\r\n\r\nSoon after there was the sound of wheels below--and voices--loud,\r\ndecided voices. Then Ellen came puffing up the stairs with the black\r\ndress--a sleazy thing of cheap merino.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Hubbard just got it done in time, thanks be. I wouldn’t ’a’\r\nhad the Murrays see you not in black for the world. They can’t say I\r\nhaven’t done my duty. They’re all here--the New Moon people and Oliver\r\nand his wife, your Aunt Addie, and Wallace and his wife, your Aunt Eva,\r\nand Aunt Ruth--Mrs. Dutton, _her_ name is. There, you’re ready now.\r\nCome along.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t I put my Venetian beads on?” asked Emily.\r\n\r\n“Did ever any mortal! Venetian beads with a mourning dress! Shame on\r\nyou! Is this a time to be thinking of vanity?”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t vanity!” cried Emily. “Father gave me those beads last\r\nChristmas--and I want to show the Murrays that I’ve got _something_!”\r\n\r\n“No more of your nonsense! Come along, I say! Mind your\r\nmanners--there’s a good deal depends on the impression you make on\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nEmily walked rigidly downstairs before Ellen and into the parlour.\r\nEight people were sitting around it--and she instantly felt the\r\ncritical gaze of sixteen stranger eyes. She looked very pale and plain\r\nin her black dress; the purple shadows left by weeping made her large\r\neyes look too large and hollow. She was desperately afraid, and she\r\nknew it--but she would not let the Murrays see it. She held up her head\r\nand faced the ordeal before her gallantly.\r\n\r\n“This,” said Ellen, turning her around by the shoulder, “is your Uncle\r\nWallace.”\r\n\r\nEmily shuddered and put out a cold hand. She did not like Uncle\r\nWallace--she knew that at once--he was black and grim and ugly, with\r\nfrowning, bristly brows and a stern, unpitying mouth. He had big\r\npouches under his eyes, and carefully-trimmed black side-whiskers.\r\nEmily decided then and there that she did not admire side-whiskers.\r\n\r\n“How do you do, Emily?” he said coldly--and just as coldly he bent\r\nforward and kissed her cheek.\r\n\r\nA sudden wave of indignation swept over Emily’s soul. How _dared_ he\r\nkiss her--he had hated her father and disowned her mother! She would\r\nhave none of his kisses! Flash-quick, she snatched her handkerchief\r\nfrom her pocket and wiped her outraged cheek.\r\n\r\n“Well--_well_!” exclaimed a disagreeable voice from the other side of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nUncle Wallace looked as if he would like to say a great many things but\r\ncouldn’t think of them. Ellen, with a grunt of despair, propelled Emily\r\nto the next sitter.\r\n\r\n“Your Aunt Eva,” she said.\r\n\r\nAunt Eva was sitting huddled up in a shawl. She had the fretful face\r\nof the imaginary invalid. She shook hands with Emily and said nothing.\r\nNeither did Emily.\r\n\r\n“Your Uncle Oliver,” announced Ellen.\r\n\r\nEmily rather liked Uncle Oliver’s appearance. He was big and fat and\r\nrosy and jolly-looking. She thought she would not mind so much if _he_\r\nkissed her, in spite of his bristly white moustache. But Uncle Oliver\r\nhad learned Uncle Wallace’s lesson.\r\n\r\n“I’ll give you a quarter for a kiss,” he whispered genially. A joke was\r\nUncle Oliver’s idea of being kind and sympathetic, but Emily did not\r\nknow this, and resented it.\r\n\r\n“I don’t _sell_ my kisses,” she said, lifting her head as haughtily as\r\nany Murray of them all could do.\r\n\r\nUncle Oliver chuckled and seemed infinitely amused and not a bit\r\noffended. But Emily heard a sniff across the room.\r\n\r\nAunt Addie was next. She was as fat and rosy and jolly-looking as her\r\nhusband and she gave Emily’s cold hand a nice, gentle squeeze.\r\n\r\n“How are you, dear?” she said.\r\n\r\nThat “dear” touched Emily and thawed her a trifle. But the next in\r\nturn froze her up instantly again. It was Aunt Ruth--Emily knew it was\r\nAunt Ruth before Ellen said so, and she knew it was Aunt Ruth who had\r\n“well--welled” and sniffed. She knew the cold, grey eyes, the prim, dull\r\nbrown hair, the short, stout figure, the thin, pinched, merciless mouth.\r\n\r\nAunt Ruth held out the tips of her fingers, but Emily did not take them.\r\n\r\n“Shake hands with your Aunt,” said Ellen in an angry whisper.\r\n\r\n“She does not want to shake hands with me,” said Emily, distinctly,\r\n“and so I am not going to do it.”\r\n\r\nAunt Ruth folded her scorned hands back on her black silk lap.\r\n\r\n“You are a very ill-bred child,” she said; “but of course it was only\r\nwhat was to be expected.”\r\n\r\nEmily felt a sudden compunction. Had she cast a reflection on her\r\nfather by her behaviour? Perhaps after all she should have shaken hands\r\nwith Aunt Ruth. But it was too late now--Ellen had already jerked her\r\non.\r\n\r\n“This is your Cousin, Mr. James Murray,” said Ellen, in the disgusted\r\ntone of one who gives up something as a bad job and is only anxious to\r\nbe done with it.\r\n\r\n“Cousin Jimmy--Cousin Jimmy,” said that individual. Emily looked\r\nsteadily at him, and liked him at once without any reservations.\r\n\r\nHe had a little, rosy, elfish face with a forked grey beard; his hair\r\ncurled over his head in a most un-Murray-like mop of glossy brown; and\r\nhis large, brown eyes were as kind and frank as a child’s. He gave\r\nEmily a hearty handshake, though he looked askance at the lady across\r\nfrom him while doing it.\r\n\r\n“Hello, pussy!” he said.\r\n\r\nEmily began to smile at him, but her smile was, as always, so slow in\r\ndeveloping that Ellen had whisked her on before it was in full flower,\r\nand it was Aunt Laura who got the benefit of it. Aunt Laura started and\r\npaled.\r\n\r\n“Juliet’s smile!” she said, half under her breath. And again Aunt Ruth\r\nsniffed.\r\n\r\nAunt Laura did not look like any one else in the room. She was almost\r\npretty, with her delicate features and the heavy coils of pale, sleek,\r\nfair hair, faintly greyed, pinned closely all around her head. But it\r\nwas her eyes that won Emily. They were such round blue, _blue_ eyes.\r\nOne never quite got over the shock of their blueness. And when she\r\nspoke it was in a beautiful, soft voice.\r\n\r\n“You poor, dear, little child,” she said, and put her arm around Emily\r\nfor a gentle hug.\r\n\r\nEmily returned the hug and had a narrow escape then from letting\r\nthe Murrays see her cry. All that saved her was the fact that Ellen\r\nsuddenly pushed her on into the corner by the window.\r\n\r\n“And this is your Aunt Elizabeth.”\r\n\r\nYes, this was Aunt Elizabeth. No doubt about that--and she had on a\r\nstiff, black satin dress, so stiff and rich that Emily felt sure it\r\nmust be her very best. This pleased Emily. Whatever Aunt Elizabeth\r\nthought of her father, at least she had paid him the respect of her\r\nbest dress. And Aunt Elizabeth was quite fine looking in a tall,\r\nthin, austere style, with clear-cut features and a massive coronet\r\nof iron-grey hair under her black lace cap. But her eyes, though\r\nsteel-blue, were as cold as Aunt Ruth’s, and her long, thin mouth was\r\ncompressed severely. Under her cool, appraising glance Emily retreated\r\ninto herself and shut the door of her soul. She would have liked to\r\nplease Aunt Elizabeth--who was “boss” at New Moon--but she felt she\r\ncould not do it.\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth shook hands and said nothing--the truth being that she\r\ndid not know exactly what to say. Elizabeth Murray would not have felt\r\n“put about” before King or Governor-General. The Murray pride would\r\nhave carried her through there; but she did feel disturbed in the\r\npresence of this alien, level-gazing child who had already shown that\r\nshe was anything but meek and humble. Though Elizabeth Murray would\r\nnever have admitted it, she did not want to be snubbed as Wallace and\r\nRuth had been.\r\n\r\n“Go and sit on the sofa,” ordered Ellen.\r\n\r\nEmily sat on the sofa with her eyes cast down, a slight, black,\r\nindomitable little figure. She folded her hands on her lap and crossed\r\nher ankles. They should see she had manners.\r\n\r\nEllen had retreated to the kitchen, thanking her stars that _that_ was\r\nover. Emily did not like Ellen but she felt deserted when Ellen had\r\ngone. She was alone now before the bar of Murray opinion. She would\r\nhave given anything to be out of the room. Yet in the back of her mind\r\na design was forming of writing all about it in the old account book.\r\nIt would be interesting. She could describe them all--she knew she\r\ncould. She had the very word for Aunt Ruth’s eyes--“stone-grey.” They\r\nwere just like stones--as hard and cold and relentless. Then a pang\r\ntore through her heart. Father could never again read what she wrote in\r\nthe account book.\r\n\r\nStill--she felt that she would rather like to write it all out. How\r\ncould she best describe Aunt Laura’s eyes? They were such beautiful\r\neyes--just to call them “blue” meant nothing--hundreds of people had\r\nblue eyes--oh, she had it--“wells of blue”--that was the very thing.\r\n\r\nAnd then the flash came!\r\n\r\nIt was the first time since the dreadful night when Ellen had met her\r\non the doorstep. She had thought it could never come again--and now in\r\nthis most unlikely place and time it _had_ come--she had seen, with\r\nother eyes than those of sense, the wonderful world behind the veil.\r\nCourage and hope flooded her cold little soul like a wave of rosy\r\nlight. She lifted her head and looked about her undauntedly--“brazenly”\r\nAunt Ruth afterwards declared.\r\n\r\nYes, she _would_ write them all out in the account book--describe\r\nevery last one of them--sweet Aunt Laura, nice Cousin Jimmy, grim old\r\nUncle Wallace, and moon-faced Uncle Oliver, stately Aunt Elizabeth and\r\ndetestable Aunt Ruth.\r\n\r\n“She’s a delicate-looking child,” said Aunt Eva, suddenly, in her\r\nfretful, colourless voice.\r\n\r\n“Well, what else could you expect?” said Aunt Addie, with a sigh that\r\nseemed to Emily to hold some dire significance. “She’s too pale--if she\r\nhad a little colour she wouldn’t be bad-looking.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know who she looks like,” said Uncle Oliver, staring at Emily.\r\n\r\n“She is not a Murray, that is plain to be seen,” said Aunt Elizabeth,\r\ndecidedly and disapprovingly.\r\n\r\n“They are talking about me just as if I wasn’t here,” thought Emily,\r\nher heart swelling with indignation over the indecency of it.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t call her a Starr either,” said Uncle Oliver. “Seems to me\r\nshe’s more like the Byrds--she’s got her grandmother’s hair and eyes.”\r\n\r\n“She’s got old George Byrd’s nose,” said Aunt Ruth, in a tone that left\r\nno doubt as to her opinion of George’s nose.\r\n\r\n“She’s got her father’s forehead,” said Aunt Eva, also disapprovingly.\r\n\r\n“She has her mother’s smile,” said Aunt Laura, but in such a low tone\r\nthat nobody heard her.\r\n\r\n“And Juliet’s long lashes--hadn’t Juliet very long lashes?” said Aunt\r\nAddie.\r\n\r\nEmily had reached the limit of her endurance.\r\n\r\n“You make me feel as if I was made up of scraps and patches!” she burst\r\nout indignantly.\r\n\r\nThe Murrays stared at her. Perhaps they felt some compunction--for,\r\nafter all, none of them were ogres and all were human, more or less.\r\nApparently nobody could think of anything to say, but the shocked\r\nsilence was broken by a chuckle from Cousin Jimmy--a low chuckle, full\r\nof mirth and free from malice.\r\n\r\n“That’s right, puss,” he said. “Stand up to them--take your own part.”\r\n\r\n“Jimmy!” said Aunt Ruth.\r\n\r\nJimmy subsided.\r\n\r\nAunt Ruth looked at Emily.\r\n\r\n“When I was a little girl,” she said, “I never spoke until I was spoken\r\nto.”\r\n\r\n“But if nobody ever spoke until they were spoken to there would be no\r\nconversation,” said Emily argumentatively.\r\n\r\n“I never answered back,” Aunt Ruth went on severely. “In those days\r\nlittle girls were trained properly. We were polite and respectful to\r\nour elders. We were taught our place and we kept it.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe you ever had much fun,” said Emily--and then gasped in\r\nhorror. She hadn’t meant to say that out loud--she had only meant to\r\n_think_ it. But she had such an old habit of thinking aloud to Father.\r\n\r\n“Fun!” said Aunt Ruth, in a shocked tone. “I did not think of fun when\r\nI was a little girl.”\r\n\r\n“No, I know,” said Emily gravely. Her voice and manner were perfectly\r\nrespectful, for she was anxious to atone for her involuntary lapse.\r\nYet Aunt Ruth looked as if she would like to box her ears. This child\r\nwas _pitying_ her--insulting her by being sorry for _her_--because of\r\nher prim, impeccable childhood. It was unendurable--especially in a\r\nStarr. And that abominable Jimmy was chuckling again! Elizabeth should\r\nsuppress him!\r\n\r\nFortunately Ellen Greene appeared at this juncture and announced supper.\r\n\r\n“You’ve got to wait,” she whispered to Emily. “There ain’t room for you\r\nat the table.”\r\n\r\nEmily was glad. She knew she could not eat a bite under the Murray\r\neyes. Her aunts and uncles filed out stiffly without looking at\r\nher--all except Aunt Laura, who turned at the door and blew her a tiny,\r\nfurtive kiss. Before Emily could respond Ellen Greene had shut the door.\r\n\r\nEmily was left all alone in the room that was filling with twilight\r\nshadows. The pride that had sustained her in the presence of the\r\nMurrays suddenly failed her and she knew that tears were coming. She\r\nwent straight to the closed door at the end of the parlour, opened\r\nit, and went in. Her father’s coffin stood in the centre of the small\r\nroom which had been a bedroom. It was heaped with flowers--the Murrays\r\nhad done the proper thing in that as in all else. The great anchor of\r\nwhite roses Uncle Wallace had brought stood up aggressively on the\r\nsmall table at the head. Emily could not see her father’s face for Aunt\r\nRuth’s heavily-fragrant pillow of white hyacinths lying on the glass,\r\nand she dared not move it. But she curled herself up on the floor and\r\nlaid her cheek against the polished side of the casket. They found her\r\nthere asleep when they came in after supper. Aunt Laura lifted her up\r\nand said,\r\n\r\n“I’m going to take the poor child up to bed--she’s worn right out.”\r\n\r\nEmily opened her eyes and looked drowsily about her.\r\n\r\n“Can I have Mike?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Who is Mike?”\r\n\r\n“My cat--my big grey cat.”\r\n\r\n“A cat!” exclaimed Aunt Elizabeth in a shocked tone. “You must not have\r\na cat in your bedroom!”\r\n\r\n“Why not--for once?” pleaded Laura.\r\n\r\n“Certainly not!” said Aunt Elizabeth. “A cat is a most unwholesome\r\nthing in a sleeping apartment. I’m surprised at you, Laura! Take the\r\nchild up to bed and see that there are plenty of bedclothes. It’s a\r\ncold night--but let me hear no more talk of sleeping with cats.”\r\n\r\n“Mike is a clean cat,” said Emily. “He washes himself--every day.”\r\n\r\n“Take her up to bed, Laura!” said Aunt Elizabeth, ignoring Emily.\r\n\r\nAunt Laura yielded meekly. She carried Emily upstairs, helped her\r\nundress, and tucked her into bed. Emily was very sleepy. But before\r\nshe was wholly asleep she felt something, soft and warm and purry and\r\ncompanionable, snuggling down by her shoulder. Aunt Laura had sneaked\r\ndown, found Mike and brought him up to her. Aunt Elizabeth never knew\r\nand Ellen Greene dared not say a word in protest--for was not Laura a\r\nMurray of New Moon?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nA FAMILY CONCLAVE\r\n\r\n\r\nEmily wakened at daylight the next morning. Through her low,\r\nuncurtained window the splendour of the sunrise was coming in, and one\r\nfaint, white star was still lingering in the crystal-green sky over the\r\nRooster Pine. A fresh sweet wind of dawn was blowing around the eaves.\r\nEllen Greene was sleeping in the big bed and snoring soundly. Except\r\nfor that the little house was very still. It was the chance for which\r\nEmily had waited.\r\n\r\nVery carefully she slipped from her bed, tiptoed across the room and\r\nopened the door. Mike uncoiled himself from the mat on the middle of\r\nthe floor and followed her, rubbing his warm sides against her chilly\r\nlittle ankles. Almost guiltily she crept down the bare, dark staircase.\r\nHow the steps creaked--surely it would waken everybody! But nobody\r\nappeared and Emily got down and slipped into the parlour, drawing a\r\nlong breath of relief as she closed the door. She almost ran across the\r\nroom to the other door.\r\n\r\nAunt Ruth’s floral pillow still covered the glass of the casket. Emily,\r\nwith a tightening of the lips that gave her face an odd resemblance to\r\nAunt Elizabeth, lifted up the pillow and set it on the floor.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Father--Father!” she whispered, putting her hand to her throat to\r\nkeep something down. She stood there, a little shivering, white-clad\r\nfigure, and looked at her father. This was to be her good-bye; she must\r\nsay it when they were alone together--she would not say it before the\r\nMurrays.\r\n\r\nFather looked so beautiful. All the lines of pain had vanished--his\r\nface looked almost like a boy’s except for the silver hair above it.\r\nAnd he was smiling--such a nice, whimsical, wise little smile, as if he\r\nhad suddenly discovered something lovely and unexpected and surprising.\r\nShe had seen many nice smiles on his face in life but never one just\r\nlike this.\r\n\r\n“Father, I didn’t cry before them,” she whispered. “I’m sure I didn’t\r\ndisgrace the Starrs. Not shaking hands with Aunt Ruth wasn’t disgracing\r\nthe Starrs, was it? Because she didn’t really want me to--oh, Father,\r\nI don’t think any of them like me, unless perhaps Aunt Laura does a\r\nlittle. And I’m going to cry a little bit now, Father, because I can’t\r\nkeep it back _all_ the time.”\r\n\r\nShe laid her face on the cold glass and sobbed bitterly but briefly.\r\nShe must say good-bye before any one found her. Raising her head she\r\nlooked long and earnestly at the beloved face.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, dearest darling,” she whispered chokingly.\r\n\r\nDashing away her blinding tears she replaced Aunt Ruth’s pillow, hiding\r\nher father’s face from her forever. Then she slipped out, intent on\r\nspeedily regaining her room. At the door she almost fell over Cousin\r\nJimmy, who was sitting on a chair before it, swathed in a huge, checked\r\ndressing-gown, and nursing Mike.\r\n\r\n“S-s-h!” he whispered, patting her on the shoulder. “_I_ heard you\r\ncoming down and followed you. _I_ knew what you wanted. I’ve been\r\nsitting here to keep them out if any of them came after you. Here, take\r\nthis and hurry back to your bed, small pussy.”\r\n\r\n“This” was a roll of peppermint lozenges. Emily clutched it and fled,\r\novercome with shame at being seen by Cousin Jimmy in her nightgown.\r\nShe hated peppermints and never ate them, but the fact of Cousin Jimmy\r\nMurray’s kindness in giving them to her sent a thrill of delight to her\r\nheart. And he called her “small pussy,” too,--she liked that. She had\r\nthought nobody would ever call her nice pet names again. Father had had\r\nso many of them for her--“sweetheart” and “darling” and “Emily-child”\r\nand “dear wee kidlet” and “honey” and “elfkin.” He had a pet name for\r\nevery mood and she had loved them all. As for Cousin Jimmy, he was\r\nnice. Whatever part of him was missing it wasn’t his heart. She felt so\r\ngrateful to him that after she was safely in her bed again she forced\r\nherself to eat one of the lozenges, though it took all her grit to\r\nworry it down.\r\n\r\nThe funeral was held that forenoon. For once the lonesome little house\r\nin the hollow was filled. The coffin was taken into the parlour and\r\nthe Murrays as mourners sat stiffly and decorously all round it, Emily\r\namong them, pale and prim in her black dress. She sat between Aunt\r\nElizabeth and Uncle Wallace and dared not move a muscle. No other Starr\r\nwas present. Her father had no near living relatives. The Maywood\r\npeople came and looked at his dead face with a freedom and insolent\r\ncuriosity they would never have presumed on in life. Emily hated to\r\nhave them looking at her father like that. They had no right--they\r\nhadn’t been friendly to him while he was alive--they had said harsh\r\nthings of him--Ellen Greene had sometimes repeated them. Every glance\r\nthat fell on him hurt Emily; but she sat still and gave no outward\r\nsign. Aunt Ruth said afterwards that she had never seen a child so\r\nabsolutely devoid of all natural feeling.\r\n\r\nWhen the service was over the Murrays rose and marched around the\r\ncoffin for a dutiful look of farewell. Aunt Elizabeth took Emily’s\r\nhand and tried to draw her along with them but Emily pulled it back\r\nand shook her head. She had said her good-bye already. Aunt Elizabeth\r\nseemed for a moment to be on the point of insisting; then she grimly\r\nswept onward, alone, looking every inch a Murray. No scene must be made\r\nat a funeral.\r\n\r\nDouglas Starr was to be taken to Charlottetown for burial beside his\r\nwife. The Murrays were all going but Emily was not to go. She watched\r\nthe funeral procession as it wound up the long, grassy hill, through\r\nthe light grey rain that was beginning to fall. Emily was glad it was\r\nraining; many a time she had heard Ellen Greene say that happy was the\r\ncorpse the rain fell on; and it was easier to see Father go away in\r\nthat soft, kind, grey mist than through sparkling, laughing sunshine.\r\n\r\n“Well, I must say the funeral went off fine,” said Ellen Greene at\r\nher shoulder. “Everything’s been done regardless. If your father was\r\nlooking down from heaven at it, Emily, I’m sure he’d be pleased.”\r\n\r\n“He isn’t in heaven,” said Emily.\r\n\r\n“Good gracious! Of all the children!” Ellen could say no more.\r\n\r\n“He isn’t there _yet_. He’s only on the way. He said he’d wait around\r\nand go slow until I died, too, so that I could catch up with him. I\r\nhope I’ll die soon.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a wicked, wicked thing to wish,” rebuked Ellen.\r\n\r\nWhen the last buggy had disappeared Emily went back to the\r\nsitting-room, got a book out of the bookcase, and buried herself in the\r\nwing-chair. The women who were tidying up were glad she was quiet and\r\nout of the way.\r\n\r\n“It’s well she can read,” said Mrs. Hubbard gloomily. “Some little\r\ngirls couldn’t be so composed--Jennie Hood just screamed and shrieked\r\nafter they carried her mother out--the Hoods are all such a _feeling_\r\npeople.”\r\n\r\nEmily was not reading. She was thinking. She knew the Murrays would be\r\nback in the afternoon; and she knew her fate would probably be settled\r\nthen. “We’ll talk the matter over when we come back,” she had heard\r\nUncle Wallace saying that morning after breakfast. Some instinct told\r\nher just what “the matter” was; and she would have given one of her\r\npointed ears to hear the discussion with the other. But she knew very\r\nwell she would be sent out of the way. So she was not surprised when\r\nEllen came to her in the twilight and said:\r\n\r\n“You’d better go upstairs, Emily. Your aunts and uncles are coming in\r\nhere to talk over the business.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t I help you get supper?” asked Emily, who thought that if she\r\nwere going and coming around the kitchen she might catch a word or two.\r\n\r\n“No. You’d be more bother than help. March, now.”\r\n\r\nEllen waddled out to the kitchen, without waiting to see if Emily\r\nmarched. Emily got up reluctantly. How could she sleep to-night if she\r\ndid not know what was going to happen to her? And she felt quite sure\r\nshe would not be told till morning, if then.\r\n\r\nHer eyes fell on the oblong table in the centre of the room. Its cloth\r\nwas of generous proportions, falling in heavy folds to the floor. There\r\nwas a flash of black stockings across the rug, a sudden disturbance\r\nof drapery, and then--silence. Emily, on the floor under the table,\r\narranged her legs comfortably and sat triumphant. She would hear what\r\nwas decided and nobody would be any the wiser.\r\n\r\nShe had never been told that it was not considered strictly honourable\r\nto eavesdrop, no occasion for such instruction ever having arisen in\r\nher life with her father; and she considered that it was a bit of pure\r\nluck that she had thought of hiding under the table. She could even see\r\ndimly through the cloth. Her heart beat so loudly in her excitement\r\nthat she was afraid they would hear it; there was no other sound save\r\nthe soft, faraway singing of frogs through the rain, that sounded\r\nthrough the open window.\r\n\r\nIn they came; down they sat around the room; Emily held her breath; for\r\na few minutes nobody spoke, though Aunt Eva sighed long and heavily.\r\nThen Uncle Wallace cleared his throat and said,\r\n\r\n“Well, what is to be done with the child?”\r\n\r\nNobody was in a hurry to answer. Emily thought they would _never_\r\nspeak. Finally Aunt Eva said with a whine,\r\n\r\n“She’s such a difficult child--so odd. _I_ can’t understand her at all.”\r\n\r\n“I think,” said Aunt Laura timidly, “that she has what one might call\r\nan artistic temperament.”\r\n\r\n“She’s a spoiled child,” said Aunt Ruth very decidedly. “There’s work\r\nahead to straighten out _her_ manners, if you ask me.”\r\n\r\n(The little listener under the table turned her head and shot a\r\nscornful glance at Aunt Ruth through the tablecloth. “_I_ think that\r\nyour own manners have a slight curve.” Emily did not dare even to\r\nmurmur the words under her breath, but she shaped them with her mouth;\r\nthis was a great relief and satisfaction.)\r\n\r\n“I agree with you,” said Aunt Eva, “and I for one do not feel equal to\r\nthe task.”\r\n\r\n(Emily understood that this meant Uncle Wallace didn’t mean to take her\r\nand she rejoiced thereat.)\r\n\r\n“The truth is,” said Uncle Wallace, “Aunt Nancy ought to take her. She\r\nhas more of this world’s goods than any of us.”\r\n\r\n“Aunt Nancy would never dream of taking her and you know it well\r\nenough!” said Uncle Oliver. “Besides, she’s entirely too old to have\r\nthe bringing up of a child--her and that old witch Caroline. Upon my\r\nsoul, I don’t believe either of them is human. I would like to take\r\nEmily--but I feel that I can hardly do it. I’ve a large family to\r\nprovide for.”\r\n\r\n“She’ll not likely live long to bother any one,” said Aunt Elizabeth\r\ncrisply. “She’ll probably die of consumption same as her father did.”\r\n\r\n(“I won’t--I won’t!” exclaimed Emily--at least she _thought_ it with\r\nsuch vim that it almost seemed that she exclaimed it. She forgot that\r\nshe had wanted to die soon, so that she could overtake Father. She\r\nwanted to live now, just to put the Murrays in the wrong. “I haven’t\r\n_any_ intention of dying. I’m going to live--for ages--and be a famous\r\n_authoress_--you’ll just see if I don’t, Aunt Elizabeth Murray!”)\r\n\r\n“She _is_ a weedy looking child,” acknowledged Uncle Wallace.\r\n\r\n(Emily relieved her outraged feelings by making a face at Uncle Wallace\r\nthrough the tablecloth. “If I ever possess a pig I am going to name\r\nit after _you_,” she thought--and then felt quite satisfied with her\r\nrevenge.)\r\n\r\n“Somebody has to look after her as long as she’s alive though, you\r\nknow,” said Uncle Oliver.\r\n\r\n(“It would serve you all right if I _did_ die and you suffered terrible\r\nremorse for it all the rest of your lives,” Emily thought. Then in\r\nthe pause that happened to follow, she dramatically pictured out her\r\nfuneral, selected her pall-bearers, and tried to choose the hymn verse\r\nthat she wanted engraved on her tombstone. But before she could settle\r\nthis Uncle Wallace began again.)\r\n\r\n“Well, we are not getting anywhere. We have to look after the child--”\r\n\r\n(“I _wish_ you wouldn’t call me ‘_the child_,’” thought Emily bitterly.)\r\n\r\n“--and some of us must give her a home. Juliet’s daughter must not be\r\nleft to the mercy of strangers. Personally, I feel that Eva’s health is\r\nnot equal to the care and training of a child--”\r\n\r\n“Of _such_ a child,” said Aunt Eva.\r\n\r\n(Emily stuck her tongue out at Aunt Eva.)\r\n\r\n“Poor little soul,” said Aunt Laura gently.\r\n\r\n(Something frozen in Emily’s heart melted at that moment. She was\r\npitifully pleased over being called “poor little soul” so tenderly.)\r\n\r\n“I do not think you need pity her overmuch, Laura,” said Uncle Wallace\r\ndecidedly. “It is evident that she has very little feeling. I have not\r\nseen her shed a tear since we came here.”\r\n\r\n“Did you notice that she would not even take a last look at her\r\nfather?” said Aunt Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nCousin Jimmy suddenly whistled at the ceiling.\r\n\r\n“She feels so much that she has to hide it,” said Aunt Laura.\r\n\r\nUncle Wallace snorted.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think _we_ might take her, Elizabeth?” Laura went on timidly.\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth stirred restlessly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t suppose she’d be contented at New Moon, with three old people\r\nlike us.”\r\n\r\n(“I would--I would!” thought Emily.)\r\n\r\n“Ruth, what about you?” said Uncle Wallace. “You’re all alone in that\r\nbig house. It would be a good thing for you to have some company.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like her,” said Aunt Ruth sharply. “She is as sly as a snake.”\r\n\r\n(“I’m _not_!” thought Emily.)\r\n\r\n“With wise and careful training many of her faults may be cured,” said\r\nUncle Wallace, pompously.\r\n\r\n(“I don’t _want_ them cured!” Emily was getting angrier and angrier\r\nall the time under the table. “I like _my_ faults better than I do\r\n_your_--_your_--” she fumbled mentally for a word--then triumphantly\r\nrecalled a phrase of her father’s--“your _abominable_ virtues!”)\r\n\r\n“I doubt it,” said Aunt Ruth, in a biting tone. “What’s bred in the\r\nbone comes out in the flesh. As for Douglas Starr, I think that it was\r\nperfectly disgraceful for him to die and leave that child without a\r\ncent.”\r\n\r\n“Did he do it on purpose?” asked Cousin Jimmy blandly. It was the first\r\ntime he had spoken.\r\n\r\n“He was a miserable failure,” snapped Aunt Ruth.\r\n\r\n“He wasn’t--he wasn’t!” screamed Emily, suddenly sticking her head out\r\nunder the tablecloth, between the end legs of the table.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the Murrays sat as silent and motionless as if her\r\noutburst had turned them to stone. Then Aunt Ruth rose, stalked to the\r\ntable, and lifted the cloth, behind which Emily had retired in dismay,\r\nrealising what she had done.\r\n\r\n“Get up and come out of that, Em’ly Starr!” said Aunt Ruth.\r\n\r\n“Em’ly Starr” got up and came out. She was not specially\r\nfrightened--she was too angry to be that. Her eyes had gone black and\r\nher cheeks crimson.\r\n\r\n“What a little beauty--what a regular little beauty!” said Cousin\r\nJimmy. But nobody heard him. Aunt Ruth had the floor.\r\n\r\n“You shameless little eavesdropper!” she said. “There’s the Starr blood\r\ncoming out--a Murray would never have done such a thing. You ought to\r\nbe whipped!”\r\n\r\n“Father wasn’t a failure!” cried Emily, choking with anger. “You had no\r\nright to call him a failure. Nobody who was loved as much as he was\r\ncould be a failure. I don’t believe anybody _ever_ loved you. So it’s\r\n_you_ that’s a failure. And I’m _not_ going to die of consumption.”\r\n\r\n“Do you realize what a shameful thing you’ve been guilty of?” demanded\r\nAunt Ruth, cold with anger.\r\n\r\n“I wanted to hear what was going to become of me,” cried Emily. “I\r\ndidn’t know it was such a dreadful thing to do--I didn’t know you were\r\ngoing to say such horrid things about me.”\r\n\r\n“Listeners never hear any good of themselves,” said Aunt Elizabeth\r\nimpressively. “Your mother would _never_ have done that, Emily.”\r\n\r\nThe bravado all went out of poor Emily. She felt guilty and\r\nmiserable--oh, so miserable. She hadn’t known--but it seemed she had\r\ncommitted a terrible sin.\r\n\r\n“Go upstairs,” said Aunt Ruth.\r\n\r\nEmily went, without a protest. But before going she looked around the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n“While I was under the table,” she said, “I made a face at Uncle\r\nWallace and stuck my tongue out at Aunt Eva.”\r\n\r\nShe said it sorrowfully, desiring to make a clean breast of her\r\ntransgressions; but so easily do we misunderstand each other that\r\nthe Murrays actually thought that she was indulging in a piece of\r\ngratuitous impertinence. When the door had closed behind her they\r\nall--except Aunt Laura and Cousin Jimmy--shook their heads and groaned.\r\n\r\nEmily went upstairs in a state of bitter humiliation. She felt that she\r\nhad done something that gave the Murrays the right to despise her, and\r\nthey thought it was the Starr coming out in her--and she had not even\r\nfound out what her fate was to be.\r\n\r\nShe looked dismally at little Emily-in-the-glass.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know--I didn’t know,” she whispered. “But I’ll know after\r\nthis,” she added with sudden vim, “and I’ll never, _never_ do it\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment she thought she would throw herself on her bed and cry.\r\nShe _couldn’t_ bear all the pain and shame that were burning in her\r\nheart. Then her eyes fell on the old yellow account book on her little\r\ntable. A minute later Emily was curled up on her bed, Turk-fashion,\r\nwriting eagerly in the old book with her little stubby lead pencil.\r\nAs her fingers flew over the faded lines her cheeks flushed and her\r\neyes shone. She forgot the Murrays although she was writing about\r\nthem--she forgot her humiliation--although she was describing what had\r\nhappened; for an hour she wrote steadily by the wretched light of her\r\nsmoky little lamp, never pausing, save now and then, to gaze out of the\r\nwindow into the dim beauty of the misty night, while she hunted through\r\nher consciousness for a certain word she wanted; when she found it she\r\ngave a happy sigh and fell to again.\r\n\r\nWhen she heard the Murrays coming upstairs she put her book away. She\r\nhad finished; she had written a description of the whole occurrence and\r\nof that conclave ring of Murrays, and she had wound up by a pathetic\r\ndescription of her own deathbed, with the Murrays standing around\r\nimploring her forgiveness. At first she depicted Aunt Ruth as doing\r\nit on her knees in an agony of remorseful sobs. Then she suspended\r\nher pencil--“Aunt Ruth couldn’t _ever_ feel as bad as _that_ over\r\nanything,” she thought--and drew her pencil through the line.\r\n\r\nIn the writing, pain and humiliation had passed away. She only felt\r\ntired and rather happy. It _had_ been fun, finding words to fit Uncle\r\nWallace; and what exquisite satisfaction it had been to describe Aunt\r\nRuth as “a dumpy little woman.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder what my uncles and aunts would say if they knew what I\r\n_really_ think of them,” she murmured as she got into bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nDIAMOND CUT DIAMOND\r\n\r\n\r\nEmily, who had been pointedly ignored by the Murrays at breakfast, was\r\ncalled into the parlour when the meal was over.\r\n\r\nThey were all there--the whole phalanx of them--and it occurred to\r\nEmily as she looked at Uncle Wallace, sitting in the spring sunshine,\r\nthat she had not just found the exact word after all to express his\r\npeculiar quality of grimness.\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth stood unsmilingly by the table with slips of paper in\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n“Emily,” she said, “last night we could not decide who should take you.\r\nI may say that none of us feel very much like doing so, for you have\r\nbehaved very badly in many respects--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Elizabeth,--” protested Laura. “She--she is our sister’s child.”\r\n\r\nElizabeth lifted a hand regally.\r\n\r\n“_I_ am doing this, Laura. Have the goodness not to interrupt me. As I\r\nwas saying, Emily, we could not decide as to who should have the care\r\nof you. So we have agreed to Cousin Jimmy’s suggestion that we settle\r\nthe matter by lot. I have our names here, written on these slips of\r\npaper. You will draw one and the one whose name is on it will give you\r\na home.”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth held out the slips of paper. Emily trembled so violently\r\nthat at first she could not draw one. This was terrible--it seemed as\r\nif she must blindly settle her own fate.\r\n\r\n“Draw,” said Aunt Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nEmily set her teeth, threw back her head with the air of one who\r\nchallenges destiny, and drew. Aunt Elizabeth took the slip from the\r\nlittle shaking hand and held it up. On it was her own name--“Elizabeth\r\nMurray.” Laura Murray suddenly put her handkerchief to her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s settled,” said Uncle Wallace, getting up with an air of\r\nrelief. “And if I’m going to catch that train I’ve got to hurry. Of\r\ncourse, as far as the matter of expense goes, Elizabeth, I’ll do my\r\nshare.”\r\n\r\n“We are not paupers at New Moon,” said Aunt Elizabeth rather coldly.\r\n“Since it has fallen to me to take her, I shall do all that is\r\nnecessary, Wallace. I do not shirk my duty.”\r\n\r\n“_I_ am her duty,” thought Emily. “Father said nobody ever liked a\r\nduty. So Aunt Elizabeth will never like me.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve got more of the Murray pride than all the rest of us put\r\ntogether, Elizabeth,” laughed Uncle Wallace.\r\n\r\nThey all followed him out--all except Aunt Laura. She came up to Emily,\r\nstanding alone in the middle of the room, and drew her into her arms.\r\n\r\n“I’m so glad, Emily--I’m so glad,” she whispered. “Don’t fret, dear\r\nchild. I love you already--and New Moon is a nice place, Emily.”\r\n\r\n“It has--a pretty name,” said Emily, struggling for self-control.\r\n“I’ve--always hoped--I could go with you, Aunt Laura. I think I am\r\ngoing to cry--but it’s not because I’m sorry I’m going there. My\r\nmanners are _not_ as bad as you may think, Aunt Laura--and I wouldn’t\r\nhave listened last night if I’d known it was wrong.”\r\n\r\n“Of course you wouldn’t,” said Aunt Laura.\r\n\r\n“But I’m not a Murray, you know.”\r\n\r\nThen Aunt Laura said a queer thing--for a Murray.\r\n\r\n“Thank heaven for that!” said Aunt Laura.\r\n\r\nCousin Jimmy followed Emily out and overtook her in the little hall.\r\nLooking carefully around to ensure privacy, he whispered,\r\n\r\n“Your Aunt Laura is a great hand at making an apple turnover, pussy.”\r\n\r\nEmily thought apple turnover sounded nice, though she did not know what\r\nit was. She whispered back a question which she would never have dared\r\nask Aunt Elizabeth or even Aunt Laura.\r\n\r\n“Cousin Jimmy, when they make a cake at New Moon, will they let me\r\nscrape out the mixing-bowl and eat the scrapings?”\r\n\r\n“Laura will--Elizabeth won’t,” whispered Cousin Jimmy solemnly.\r\n\r\n“And put my feet in the oven when they get cold? And have a cooky\r\nbefore I go to bed?”\r\n\r\n“Answer same as before,” said Cousin Jimmy. “_I’ll_ recite my poetry\r\nto you. It’s very few people I do that for. I’ve composed a thousand\r\npoems. They’re not written down--I carry them here.” Cousin Jimmy\r\ntapped his forehead.\r\n\r\n“Is it very hard to write poetry?” asked Emily, looking with new\r\nrespect at Cousin Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Easy as rolling off a log if you can find enough rhymes,” said Cousin\r\nJimmy.\r\n\r\nThey all went away that morning except the New Moon people. Aunt\r\nElizabeth announced that they would stay until the next day to pack up\r\nand take Emily with them.\r\n\r\n“Most of the furniture belongs to the house,” she said, “so it won’t\r\ntake us long to get ready. There are only Douglas Starr’s books and his\r\nfew personal belongings to pack.”\r\n\r\n“How shall I carry my cats?” asked Emily anxiously.\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth stared.\r\n\r\n“Cats! You’ll take no cats, miss.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I must take Mike and Saucy Sal!” cried Emily wildly. “I can’t\r\nleave them behind. I can’t live without a cat.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! There are barn cats at New Moon, but they are never allowed\r\nin the house.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you like cats?” asked Emily wonderingly.\r\n\r\n“No, I do _not_.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you like the _feel_ of a nice, soft, fat cat?” persisted Emily.\r\n\r\n“No; I would as soon touch a snake.”\r\n\r\n“There’s a lovely old wax doll of your mother’s up there,” said Aunt\r\nLaura. “I’ll dress it up for you.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like dolls--they can’t talk,” exclaimed Emily.\r\n\r\n“Neither can cats.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, can’t they! Mike and Saucy Sal can. Oh, I _must_ take them. Oh,\r\n_please_, Aunt Elizabeth. I _love_ those cats. And they’re the only\r\nthings left in the world that love me. Please!”\r\n\r\n“What’s a cat more or less on two hundred acres?” said Cousin Jimmy,\r\npulling his forked beard. “Take ’em along, Elizabeth.”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth considered for a moment. She couldn’t understand why\r\nanybody should want a cat. Aunt Elizabeth was one of those people who\r\nnever do understand anything unless it is told them in plain language\r\nand hammered into their heads. And _then_ they understand it only with\r\ntheir brains and not with their hearts.\r\n\r\n“You may take _one_ of your cats,” she said at last, with the air of a\r\nperson making a great concession. “One--and no more. No, don’t argue.\r\nYou may as well learn first as last, Emily, that when _I_ say a thing I\r\nmean it. That’s enough, Jimmy.”\r\n\r\nCousin Jimmy bit off something he had tried to say, stuck his hands in\r\nhis pockets, and whistled at the ceiling.\r\n\r\n“When she won’t, she won’t--Murray like. We’re all born with that kink\r\nin us, small pussy, and you’ll have to put up with it--more by token\r\nthat you’re full of it yourself, you know. Talk about your not being\r\nMurray! The Starr is only skin deep with you.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t--I’m _all_ Starr--I _want_ to be,” cried Emily. “And, oh, how\r\ncan I choose between Mike and Saucy Sal?”\r\n\r\nThis was indeed a problem. Emily wrestled with it all day, her heart\r\nbursting. She liked Mike best--there was no doubt of that; but she\r\n_couldn’t_ leave Saucy Sal to Ellen’s tender mercies. Ellen had always\r\nhated Sal; but she rather liked Mike and she would be good to him.\r\nEllen was going back to her own little house in Maywood village and she\r\nwanted a cat. At last in the evening, Emily made her bitter decision.\r\nShe would take Saucy Sal.\r\n\r\n“Better take the Tom,” said Cousin Jimmy. “Not so much bother with\r\nkittens you know, Emily.”\r\n\r\n“Jimmy!” said Aunt Elizabeth sternly. Emily wondered over the\r\nsternness. Why weren’t kittens to be spoken of? But she didn’t like to\r\nhear Mike called “the Tom.” It sounded insulting, someway.\r\n\r\nAnd she didn’t like the bustle and commotion of packing up. She longed\r\nfor the old quiet and the sweet, remembered talks with her father.\r\nShe felt as if he had been thrust far away from her by this influx of\r\nMurrays.\r\n\r\n“What’s this?” said Aunt Elizabeth suddenly, pausing for a moment in\r\nher packing. Emily looked up and saw with dismay that Aunt Elizabeth\r\nhad in her hands the old account book--that she was opening it--that\r\nshe was _reading_ in it. Emily sprang across the floor and snatched the\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n“You mustn’t read that, Aunt Elizabeth,” she cried indignantly, “that’s\r\nmine,--my own _private property_.”\r\n\r\n“Hoity-toity, Miss Starr,” said Aunt Elizabeth, staring at her, “let\r\nme tell you that I have a right to read your books. I am responsible\r\nfor you now. I am not going to have anything hidden or underhanded,\r\nunderstand that. You have evidently something there that you are\r\nashamed to have seen and I mean to see it. Give me that book.”\r\n\r\n“I’m _not_ ashamed of it,” cried Emily, backing away, hugging her\r\nprecious book to her breast. “But I won’t let you--or _anybody_--see\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth followed.\r\n\r\n“Emily Starr, do you hear what I say? Give me that book--at _once_.”\r\n\r\n“No--no!” Emily turned and ran. She would _never_ let Aunt Elizabeth\r\nsee that book. She fled to the kitchen stove--she whisked off a\r\ncover--she crammed the book into the glowing fire. It caught and blazed\r\nmerrily. Emily watched it in agony. It seemed as if part of herself\r\nwere burning there. But Aunt Elizabeth should never see it--see all\r\nthe little things she had written and read to Father--all her fancies\r\nabout the Wind Woman, and Emily-in-the-glass--all her little cat\r\ndialogues--all the things she had said in it last night about the\r\nMurrays. She watched the leaves shrivel and shudder, as if they were\r\nsentient things, and then turn black. A line of white writing came out\r\nvividly on one. “Aunt Elizabeth is very cold and _hawty_.” What if\r\nAunt Elizabeth had seen _that_? What if she were seeing it now! Emily\r\nglanced apprehensively over her shoulder. No, Aunt Elizabeth had gone\r\nback to the room and shut the door with what, in anybody but a Murray,\r\nwould have been called a bang. The account book was a little heap of\r\nwhite film on the glowing coals. Emily sat down by the stove and cried.\r\nShe felt as if she had lost something incalculably precious. It was\r\nterrible to think that all those dear things were gone. She could never\r\nwrite them again--not just the same; and if she could she wouldn’t\r\ndare--she would never dare to write _anything_ again, if Aunt Elizabeth\r\nmust see everything. Father never insisted on seeing them. She liked to\r\nread them to _him_--but if she hadn’t wanted to do it he would never\r\nhave made her. Suddenly Emily, with tears glistening on her cheeks,\r\nwrote a line in an imaginary account book.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Elizabeth is cold and hawty; and she is _not fair_.”\r\n\r\nNext morning, while Cousin Jimmy was tying the boxes at the back of\r\nthe double-seated buggy, and Aunt Elizabeth was giving Ellen her final\r\ninstructions, Emily said good-bye to everything--to the Rooster Pine\r\nand Adam-and-Eve--“they’ll miss me so when I’m gone; there won’t be\r\nany one here to love them,” she said wistfully--to the spider crack\r\nin the kitchen window--to the old wing-chair--to the bed of striped\r\ngrass--to the silver birch-ladies. Then she went upstairs to the window\r\nof her own old room. That little window had always seemed to Emily to\r\nopen on a world of wonder. In the burned account book there had been\r\none piece of which she was especially proud. “A deskripshun of the\r\nvew from my Window.” She had sat there and dreamed; at night she used\r\nto kneel there and say her little prayers. Sometimes the stars shone\r\nthrough it--sometimes the rain beat against it--sometimes the little\r\ngreybirds and swallows visited it--sometimes airy fragrances floated\r\nin from apple and lilac blossom--sometimes the Wind Woman laughed\r\nand sighed and sang and whistled round it--Emily had heard her there\r\nin the dark nights and in wild, white winter storms. She did not say\r\ngood-bye to the Wind Woman, for she knew the Wind Woman would be at New\r\nMoon, too; but she said good-bye to the little window and the green\r\nhill she had loved, and to her fairy-haunted barrens and to little\r\nEmily-in-the-glass. There might be another Emily-in-the-glass at New\r\nMoon, but she wouldn’t be the same one. And she unpinned from the wall\r\nand stowed away in her pocket the picture of the ball dress she had cut\r\nfrom a fashion sheet. It was such a wonderful dress--all white lace\r\nand wreaths of rosebuds, with a long, long, train of lace flounces\r\nthat must reach clear across a room. Emily had pictured herself a\r\nthousand times wearing that dress, sweeping, a queen of beauty, across\r\na ballroom floor.\r\n\r\nDownstairs they were waiting for her. Emily said good-bye to Ellen\r\nGreene rather indifferently--she had never liked Ellen Greene at any\r\ntime, and since the night Ellen had told her her father was going to\r\ndie she had hated and feared her.\r\n\r\nEllen amazed Emily by bursting into tears and hugging her--begging her\r\nnot to forget her--asking her to write to her--calling her “my blessed\r\nchild.”\r\n\r\n“I am not your blessed child,” said Emily, “but I will write to you.\r\nAnd will you be very good to Mike?”\r\n\r\n“I b’lieve you feel worse over leaving that cat than you do over\r\nleaving me,” sniffed Ellen.\r\n\r\n“Why, of course I do,” said Emily, amazed that there could be any\r\nquestion about it.\r\n\r\nIt took all her resolution not to cry when she bade farewell to Mike,\r\nwho was curled up on the sun-warm grass at the back door.\r\n\r\n“Maybe I’ll see you again sometime,” she whispered as she hugged him.\r\n“I’m sure _good_ pussy cats go to heaven.”\r\n\r\nThen they were off in the double-seated buggy with its fringed canopy,\r\nalways affected by the Murrays of New Moon. Emily had never driven in\r\nanything so splendid before. She had never had many drives. Once or\r\ntwice her father had borrowed Mr. Hubbard’s old buckboard and grey pony\r\nand driven to Charlottetown. The buckboard was rattly and the pony\r\nslow, but Father had talked to her all the way and made the road a\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\nCousin Jimmy and Aunt Elizabeth sat in front, the latter very imposing\r\nin black lace bonnet and mantle. Aunt Laura and Emily occupied the seat\r\nbehind, with Saucy Sal between them in a basket, shrieking piteously.\r\n\r\nEmily glanced back as they drove up the grassy lane, and thought the\r\nlittle, old, brown house in the hollow had a broken-hearted look. She\r\nlonged to run back and comfort it. In spite of her resolution, the\r\ntears came into her eyes; but Aunt Laura put a kid-gloved hand across\r\nSal’s basket and caught Emily’s in a close, understanding squeeze.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I just love you, Aunt Laura,” whispered Emily.\r\n\r\nAnd Aunt Laura’s eyes were very, very blue and deep and kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nNEW MOON\r\n\r\n\r\nEmily found the drive through the blossomy June world pleasant. Nobody\r\ntalked much; even Saucy Sal had subsided into the silence of despair;\r\nnow and then Cousin Jimmy made a remark, more to himself, as it seemed,\r\nthan to anybody else. Sometimes Aunt Elizabeth answered it, sometimes\r\nnot. She always spoke crisply and used no unnecessary words.\r\n\r\nThey stopped in Charlottetown and had dinner. Emily, who had had no\r\nappetite since her father’s death, could not eat the roast beef which\r\nthe boarding-house waitress put before her. Whereupon Aunt Elizabeth\r\nwhispered mysteriously to the waitress, who went away and presently\r\nreturned with a plateful of delicate, cold chicken--fine white slices,\r\nbeautifully trimmed with lettuce frills.\r\n\r\n“Can you eat _that_?” said Aunt Elizabeth sternly, as to a culprit at\r\nthe bar.\r\n\r\n“I’ll--try,” whispered Emily.\r\n\r\nShe was too frightened just then to say more, but by the time she had\r\nforced down some of the chicken she had made up her small mind that a\r\ncertain matter must be put right.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Elizabeth,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Hey, what?” said Aunt Elizabeth, directing her steel-blue eyes\r\nstraight at her niece’s troubled ones.\r\n\r\n“I would like you to understand,” said Emily, speaking very primly and\r\nprecisely so that she would be sure to get things right, “that it was\r\nnot because I did not like the roast beef I did not eat it. I was not\r\nhungry at all; and I just et some of the chicken to oblige you, not\r\nbecause I liked it any better.”\r\n\r\n“Children should eat what is put before them and never turn up their\r\nnoses at good, wholesome food,” said Aunt Elizabeth severely. So Emily\r\nfelt that Aunt Elizabeth had not understood after all and she was\r\nunhappy about it.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Aunt Elizabeth announced to Aunt Laura that they would do\r\nsome shopping.\r\n\r\n“We must get some things for the child,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Oh, please don’t call me ‘the child,’” exclaimed Emily. “It makes\r\nme feel as if I didn’t belong anywhere. Don’t you like my name, Aunt\r\nElizabeth? Mother thought it so pretty. And I don’t need any ‘things.’\r\nI have two whole sets of underclothes--only one is patched.----”\r\n\r\n“S-s-sh!” said Cousin Jimmy, gently kicking Emily’s shins under the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nCousin Jimmy only meant that she would better let Aunt Elizabeth buy\r\n“things” for her when she was in the humour for it; but Emily thought\r\nhe was rebuking her for mentioning such matters as underclothes and\r\nsubsided in scarlet conviction. Aunt Elizabeth went on talking to Laura\r\nas if she had not heard.\r\n\r\n“She must not wear that cheap black dress in Blair Water. You could\r\nsift oatmeal through it. It is nonsense expecting a child of ten to\r\nwear black at all. I shall get her a nice white dress with black sash\r\nfor good, and some black-and-white-check gingham for school. Jimmy,\r\nwe’ll leave the child with you. Look after her.”\r\n\r\nCousin Jimmy’s method of looking after her was to take her to a\r\nrestaurant down street and fill her up with ice-cream. Emily had never\r\nhad many chances at ice-cream and she needed no urging, even with\r\nlack of appetite, to eat two saucerfuls. Cousin Jimmy eyed her with\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n“No use my getting anything for you that Elizabeth could see,” he said.\r\n“But she can’t see what is inside of you. Make the most of your chance,\r\nfor goodness alone knows when you’ll get any more.”\r\n\r\n“Do you never have ice-cream at New Moon?”\r\n\r\nCousin Jimmy shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Your Aunt Elizabeth doesn’t like new-fangled things. In the house, we\r\nbelong to fifty years ago, but on the farm she has to give way. In the\r\nhouse--candles; in the dairy, her grandmother’s big pans to set the\r\nmilk in. But, pussy, New Moon is a pretty good place after all. You’ll\r\nlike it some day.”\r\n\r\n“Are there any fairies there?” asked Emily, wistfully.\r\n\r\n“The woods are full of ’em,” said Cousin Jimmy. “And so are the\r\ncolumbines in the old orchard. We grow columbines there on purpose for\r\nthe fairies.”\r\n\r\nEmily sighed. Since she was eight she had known there were no fairies\r\nanywhere nowadays; yet she hadn’t quite given up the hope that one or\r\ntwo might linger in old-fashioned, out-of-the-way spots. And where so\r\nlikely as at New Moon?\r\n\r\n“Really-truly fairies?” she questioned.\r\n\r\n“Why, you know, if a fairy was really-truly it wouldn’t _be_ a fairy,”\r\nsaid Uncle Jimmy seriously. “Could it, now?”\r\n\r\nBefore Emily could think this out the aunts returned and soon they were\r\nall on the road again. It was sunset when they came to Blair Water--a\r\nrosy sunset that flooded the long, sandy sea-coast with colour and\r\nbrought red road and fir-darkened hill out in fleeting clearness of\r\noutline. Emily looked about her on her new environment and found it\r\ngood. She saw a big house peering whitely through a veil of tall old\r\ntrees--no mushroom growth of yesterday’s birches but trees that had\r\nloved and been loved by three generations--a glimpse of silver water\r\nglistening through the dark spruces--that was the Blair Water itself,\r\nshe knew--and a tall, golden-white church spire shooting up above\r\nthe maple woods in the valley below. But it was none of these that\r\nbrought her the flash--_that_ came with the sudden glimpse of the dear,\r\nfriendly, little dormer window peeping through vines on the roof--and\r\nright over it, in the opalescent sky, a real new moon, golden and\r\nslender. Emily was tingling all over with it as Cousin Jimmy lifted her\r\nfrom the buggy and carried her into the kitchen.\r\n\r\nShe sat on a long wooden bench that was satin-smooth with age and\r\nscrubbing, and watched Aunt Elizabeth lighting candles here and there,\r\nin great, shining, brass candlesticks--on the shelf between the\r\nwindows, on the high dresser where the row of blue and white plates\r\nbegan to wink her a friendly welcome, on the long table in the corner.\r\nAnd as she lighted them, elvish “rabbits’ candles” flashed up amid the\r\ntrees outside the windows.\r\n\r\nEmily had never seen a kitchen like this before. It had dark wooden\r\nwalls and low ceiling, with black rafters crossing it, from which hung\r\nhams and sides of bacon and bunches of herbs and new socks and mittens,\r\nand many other things, the names and uses of which Emily could not\r\nimagine. The sanded floor was spotlessly white, but the boards had been\r\nscrubbed away through the years until the knots in them stuck up all\r\nover in funny little bosses, and in front of the stove they had sagged,\r\nmaking a queer, shallow little hollow. In one corner of the ceiling was\r\na large square hole which looked black and spookish in the candlelight,\r\nand made her feel creepy. _Something_ might pop down out of a hole\r\nlike that if one hadn’t behaved just right, you know. And candles cast\r\nsuch queer wavering shadows. Emily didn’t know whether she liked the\r\nNew Moon kitchen or not. It was an interesting place--and she rather\r\nthought she would like to describe it in the old account book, if it\r\nhadn’t been burned--but Emily suddenly found herself trembling on the\r\nverge of tears.\r\n\r\n“Cold?” said Aunt Laura kindly. “These June evenings are chilly yet.\r\nCome into the sitting-room--Jimmy has kindled a fire in the stove\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\nEmily, fighting desperately for self-control, went into the\r\nsitting-room. It was much more cheerful than the kitchen. The floor\r\nwas covered with gay-striped homespun, the table had a bright crimson\r\ncloth, the walls were hung with pretty, diamond-patterned paper, the\r\ncurtains were of wonderful pale-red damask with a design of white\r\nferns scattered all over them. They looked very rich and imposing\r\nand Murray-like. Emily had never seen such curtains before. But best\r\nof all were the friendly gleams and flickers from the jolly hardwood\r\nfire in the open stove that mellowed the ghostly candlelight with\r\nsomething warm and rosy-golden. Emily toasted her toes before it and\r\nfelt reviving interest in her surroundings. What lovely little leaded\r\nglass doors closed the china closets on either side of the high,\r\nblack, polished mantel! What a funny, delightful shadow the carved\r\nornament on the sideboard cast on the wall behind it--just like a\r\nnegro’s side-face, Emily decided. What mysteries might lurk behind the\r\nchintz-lined glass doors of the bookcase! Books were Emily’s friends\r\nwherever she found them. She flew over to the bookcase and opened the\r\ndoor. But before she could see more than the backs of rather ponderous\r\nvolumes, Aunt Elizabeth came in, with a mug of milk and a plate whereon\r\nlay two little oatmeal cakes.\r\n\r\n“Emily,” said Aunt Elizabeth sternly, “shut that door. Remember that\r\nafter this you are not to meddle with things that don’t belong to you.”\r\n\r\n“I thought books belonged to everybody,” said Emily.\r\n\r\n“Ours don’t,” said Aunt Elizabeth, contriving to convey the impression\r\nthat New Moon books were in a class by themselves. “Here is your\r\nsupper, Emily. We are all so tired that we are just having a lunch. Eat\r\nit and then we will go to bed.”\r\n\r\nEmily drank the milk and worried down the oat-cakes, still gazing about\r\nher. How pretty the wallpaper was, with the garland of roses inside\r\nthe gilt diamond! Emily wondered if she could “see it in the air.” She\r\ntried--yes, she could--there it hung, a yard from her eyes, a little\r\nfairy pattern, suspended in mid-air like a screen. Emily had discovered\r\nthat she possessed this odd knack when she was six. By a certain\r\nmovement of the muscles of her eyes, which she could never describe,\r\nshe could produce a tiny replica of the wallpaper in the air before\r\nher--could hold it there and look at it as long as she liked--could\r\nshift it back and forth, to any distance she chose, making it larger\r\nor smaller as it went farther away or came nearer. It was one of her\r\nsecret joys when she went into a new room anywhere to “see the paper in\r\nthe air.” And this New Moon paper made the prettiest fairy paper she\r\nhad ever seen.\r\n\r\n“What are you staring at nothing in that queer way for?” demanded Aunt\r\nElizabeth, suddenly returning.\r\n\r\nEmily shrank into herself. She couldn’t explain to Aunt Elizabeth--Aunt\r\nElizabeth would be like Ellen Greene and say she was “crazy.”\r\n\r\n“I--I wasn’t staring at nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t contradict. I say you were,” retorted Aunt Elizabeth. “Don’t do\r\nit again. It gives your face an unnatural expression. Come now--we will\r\ngo upstairs. You are to sleep with me.”\r\n\r\nEmily gave a gasp of dismay. She had hoped it might be with Aunt\r\nLaura. Sleeping with Aunt Elizabeth seemed a very formidable thing.\r\nBut she dared not protest. They went up to Aunt Elizabeth’s big,\r\nsombre bedroom where there was dark, grim wallpaper that could never\r\nbe transformed into a fairy curtain, a high black bureau, topped\r\nwith a tiny swing-mirror, so far above her that there could be no\r\nEmily-in-the-glass, tightly closed windows with dark-green curtains,\r\na high bedstead with a dark-green canopy, and a huge, fat, smothering\r\nfeather-bed, with high, hard pillows.\r\n\r\nEmily stood still, gazing about her.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you get undressed?” asked Aunt Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n“I--I don’t like to undress before you,” faltered Emily.\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth looked at Emily through her cold, spectacled eyes.\r\n\r\n“Take off your clothes, _at once_,” she said.\r\n\r\nEmily obeyed, tingling with anger and shame. It was abominable--taking\r\noff her clothes while Aunt Elizabeth stood and watched her. The outrage\r\nof it was unspeakable. It was even harder to say her prayers before\r\nAunt Elizabeth. Emily felt that it was not much good to pray under such\r\ncircumstances. Father’s God seemed very far away and she suspected that\r\nAunt Elizabeth’s was too much like Ellen Greene’s.\r\n\r\n“Get into bed,” said Aunt Elizabeth, turning down the clothes.\r\n\r\nEmily glanced at the shrouded window.\r\n\r\n“Aren’t you going to open the window, Aunt Elizabeth?”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth looked at Emily as if the latter had suggested removing\r\nthe roof.\r\n\r\n“Open the window--and let in the night air!” she exclaimed. “Certainly\r\nnot!”\r\n\r\n“Father and I always had our window open,” cried Emily.\r\n\r\n“No wonder he died of consumption,” said Aunt Elizabeth. “Night air is\r\npoison.”\r\n\r\n“What air is there at night but night air?” asked Emily.\r\n\r\n“Emily,” said Aunt Elizabeth icily, “get--into--bed.”\r\n\r\nEmily got in.\r\n\r\nBut it was utterly impossible to sleep, lying there in that engulfing\r\nbed that seemed to swallow her up, with that cloud of blackness above\r\nher and not a gleam of light anywhere--and Aunt Elizabeth lying beside\r\nher, long and stiff and bony.\r\n\r\n“I feel as if I was in bed with a griffin,” thought Emily.\r\n“Oh--oh--oh--I’m going to cry--I know I am.”\r\n\r\nDesperately and vainly she strove to keep the tears back--they _would_\r\ncome. She felt utterly alone and lonely--there in that darkness, with\r\nan alien, hostile world all around her--for it seemed hostile now. And\r\nthere was such a strange, mysterious, mournful sound in the air--far\r\naway, yet clear. It was the murmur of the sea, but Emily did not know\r\nthat and it frightened her. Oh, for her little bed at home--oh, for\r\nFather’s soft breathing in the room--oh, for the dancing friendliness\r\nof well-known stars shining down through her open window! She _must_ go\r\nback--she couldn’t stay here--she would never be happy here! But there\r\nwasn’t any “back” to go to--no home--no father--. A great sob burst\r\nfrom her--another followed and then another. It was no use to clench\r\nher hands and set her teeth--and chew the inside of her cheeks--nature\r\nconquered pride and determination and had her way.\r\n\r\n“What are you crying for?” asked Aunt Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth Aunt Elizabeth felt quite as uncomfortable and\r\ndisjointed as Emily did. She was not used to a bedfellow; she didn’t\r\nwant to sleep with Emily any more than Emily wanted to sleep with\r\nher. But she considered it quite impossible that the child should\r\nbe put off by herself in one of the big, lonely New Moon rooms; and\r\nLaura was a poor sleeper, easily disturbed; children always kicked,\r\nElizabeth Murray had heard. So there was nothing to do but take Emily\r\nin with her; and when she had sacrificed comfort and inclination to\r\ndo her unwelcome duty this ungrateful and unsatisfactory child was not\r\ncontented.\r\n\r\n“I asked you what you were crying for, Emily?” she repeated.\r\n\r\n“I’m--homesick, I guess,” sobbed Emily.\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth was annoyed.\r\n\r\n“A nice home you had to be homesick for,” she said sharply.\r\n\r\n“It--it wasn’t as elegant--as New Moon,” sobbed Emily, “but--_Father_\r\nwas there. I guess I’m Father-sick, Aunt Elizabeth. Didn’t you feel\r\nawfully lonely when _your_ father died?”\r\n\r\nElizabeth Murray involuntarily remembered the ashamed, smothered\r\nfeeling of relief when old Archibald Murray had died--the handsome,\r\nintolerant, autocratic old man who had ruled his family with a rod\r\nof iron all his life and had made existence at New Moon miserable\r\nwith the petulant tyranny of the five years of invalidism that had\r\nclosed his career. The surviving Murrays had behaved impeccably, and\r\nwept decorously, and printed a long and flattering obituary. But had\r\none genuine feeling of regret followed Archibald Murray to his tomb?\r\nElizabeth did not like the memory and was angry with Emily for evoking\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“I was resigned to the will of Providence,” she said coldly. “Emily,\r\nyou must understand right now that you are to be grateful and obedient\r\nand show your appreciation of what is being done for you. I won’t have\r\ntears and repining. What would you have done if you had no friends to\r\ntake you in? Answer me that.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose I would have starved to death,” admitted Emily--instantly\r\nbeholding a dramatic vision of herself lying dead, looking exactly like\r\nthe pictures she had seen in one of Ellen Greene’s missionary magazines\r\ndepicting the victims of an Indian famine.\r\n\r\n“Not exactly--but you would have been sent to some orphanage where you\r\nwould have been half-starved, probably. You little know what you have\r\nescaped. You have come to a good home where you will be cared for and\r\neducated properly.”\r\n\r\nEmily did not altogether like the sound of being “educated properly.”\r\nBut she said humbly,\r\n\r\n“I know it was very good of you to bring me to New Moon, Aunt\r\nElizabeth. And I won’t bother you long, you know. I’ll soon be grown-up\r\nand able to earn my own living. What do you think is the earliest age a\r\nperson can be called grown-up, Aunt Elizabeth?”\r\n\r\n“You needn’t think about that,” said Aunt Elizabeth shortly. “The\r\nMurray women have never been under any necessity for earning their own\r\nliving. All we require of you is to be a good and contented child and\r\nto conduct yourself with becoming prudence and modesty.”\r\n\r\nThis sounded terribly hard.\r\n\r\n“I _will_ be,” said Emily, suddenly determining to be heroic, like the\r\ngirl in the stories she had read. “Perhaps it won’t be so very hard\r\nafter all, Aunt Elizabeth,”--Emily happened at this point to recall\r\na speech she had heard her father use once, and thought this a good\r\nopportunity to work it in--“because, you know, God is good and the\r\ndevil might be worse.”\r\n\r\nPoor Aunt Elizabeth! To have a speech like that fired at her in the\r\ndarkness of the night from that unwelcome little interloper into her\r\norderly life and peaceful bed! Was it any wonder that for a moment\r\nor so she was too paralyzed to reply! Then she exclaimed in tones of\r\nhorror,\r\n\r\n“Emily, _never_ say that again.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Emily meekly. “But,” she added defiantly under her\r\nbreath, “I’ll go on thinking it.”\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Aunt Elizabeth, “I want to say that I am not in the\r\nhabit of talking all night if you are. I tell you to go to sleep, and I\r\n_expect_ you to obey me. Good-night.”\r\n\r\nThe tone of Aunt Elizabeth’s good-night would have spoiled the best\r\nnight in the world. But Emily lay very still and sobbed no more, though\r\nthe noiseless tears trickled down her cheeks in the darkness for some\r\ntime. She lay so still that Aunt Elizabeth imagined she was asleep and\r\nwent to sleep herself.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if anybody in the world is awake but me,” thought Emily,\r\nfeeling a sickening loneliness. “If I only had Saucy Sal here! She\r\nisn’t so cuddly as Mike but she’d be better than nothing. I wonder\r\nwhere she is. I wonder if they gave her any supper.”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth had handed Sal’s basket to Cousin Jimmy with an\r\nimpatient, “Here--look to this cat,” and Jimmy had carried it off.\r\nWhere had he put it? Perhaps Saucy Sal would get out and go home--Emily\r\nhad heard cats always went back home. She wished _she_ could get out\r\nand go home--she pictured herself and her cat running eagerly along\r\nthe dark, starlit roads to the little house in the hollow--back to the\r\nbirches and Adam-and-Eve and Mike, and the old wing-chair and her dear\r\nlittle cot and the open window where the Wind Woman sang to her and at\r\ndawn one could see the blue of the mist on the homeland hills.\r\n\r\n“Will it ever be morning?” thought Emily. “Perhaps things won’t be so\r\nbad in the morning.”\r\n\r\nAnd then--she heard the Wind Woman at the window--she heard the little,\r\nlow, whispering murmur of the June night breeze--cooing, friendly,\r\nlovesome.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you’re out there, are you, dearest one?” she whispered, stretching\r\nout her arms. “Oh, I’m so glad to hear you. You’re such company, Wind\r\nWoman. I’m not lonesome any more. And the flash came, too! I was afraid\r\nit might never come at New Moon.”\r\n\r\nHer soul suddenly escaped from the bondage of Aunt Elizabeth’s stuffy\r\nfeather-bed and gloomy canopy and sealed windows. She was out in the\r\nopen with the Wind Woman and the other gipsies of the night--the\r\nfireflies, the moths, the brooks, the clouds. Far and wide she\r\nwandered in enchanted reverie until she coasted the shore of dreams and\r\nfell soundly asleep on the fat, hard pillow, while the Wind Woman sang\r\nsoftly and luringly in the vines that clustered over New Moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE BOOK OF YESTERDAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThat first Saturday and Sunday at New Moon always stood out in Emily’s\r\nmemory as a very wonderful time, so crowded was it with new and\r\ngenerally delightful impressions. If it be true that we “count time\r\nby heart throbs” Emily lived two years in it instead of two days.\r\nEverything was fascinating from the moment she came down the long,\r\npolished staircase into the square hall that was filled with a soft,\r\nrosy light coming through the red glass panes of the front door. Emily\r\ngazed through the panes delightedly. What a strange, fascinating, red\r\nworld she beheld, with a weird red sky that looked, she thought, as if\r\nit belonged to the Day of Judgment.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain charm about the old house which Emily felt keenly\r\nand responded to, although she was too young to understand it. It was a\r\nhouse which aforetime had had vivid brides and mothers and wives, and\r\nthe atmosphere of their loves and lives still hung around it, not yet\r\nbanished by the old-maidishness of the régime of Elizabeth and Laura.\r\n\r\n“Why--I’m going to _love_ New Moon,” thought Emily, quite amazed at the\r\nidea.\r\n\r\nAunt Laura was setting the breakfast table in the kitchen, which seemed\r\nquite bright and jolly in the glow of morning sunshine. Even the\r\nblack hole in the ceiling had ceased to be spookish and become only\r\na commonplace entrance to the kitchen loft. And on the red-sandstone\r\ndoorstep Saucy Sal was sitting, preening her fur as contentedly as\r\nif she had lived at New Moon all her life. Emily did not know it,\r\nbut Sal had already drunk deep the delight of battle with her peers\r\nthat morning and taught the barn cats their place once and for all.\r\nCousin Jimmy’s big yellow Tom had got a fearful drubbing, and was\r\nminus several bits of his anatomy, while a stuck-up, black lady-cat,\r\nwho fancied herself considerably, had made up her mind that if that\r\ngrey-and-white, narrow-faced interloper from goodness knew where was\r\ngoing to stay at New Moon, _she_ was not.\r\n\r\nEmily gathered Sal up in her arms and kissed her joyously, to the\r\nhorror of Aunt Elizabeth, who was coming across the platform from the\r\ncook-house with a plate of sizzling bacon in her hands.\r\n\r\n“Don’t ever let me see you kissing a cat again,” she ordered.\r\n\r\n“Oh, all right,” agreed Emily cheerfully. “I’ll only kiss her when you\r\ndon’t see me after this.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want any of your pertness, miss. You are not to kiss cats at\r\nall.”\r\n\r\n“But, Aunt Elizabeth, I didn’t kiss her on her mouth, _of course_. I\r\njust kissed her between her ears. It’s nice--won’t you just try it for\r\nonce and see for yourself?”\r\n\r\n“That will do, Emily. You have said quite enough.” And Aunt Elizabeth\r\nsailed on into the kitchen majestically, leaving Emily momentarily\r\nwretched. She felt that she had offended Aunt Elizabeth, and she hadn’t\r\nthe least notion why or how.\r\n\r\nBut the scene before her was too interesting to worry long over Aunt\r\nElizabeth. Delicious smells were coming from the cook-house--a little,\r\nslant-roofed building at the corner where the big cooking-stove was\r\nplaced in summer. It was thickly overgrown with hop vines, as most of\r\nthe New Moon buildings were. To the right was the “new” orchard, very\r\nwonderful now in blossom, but a rather commonplace spot after all,\r\nsince Cousin Jimmy cultivated it in most up-to-date fashion and had\r\ngrain growing in the wide spaces between the straight rows of trees\r\nthat looked all alike. But on the other side of the barn lane, just\r\nbehind the well, was the “old orchard,” where Cousin Jimmy said the\r\ncolumbines grew and which seemed to be a delightful place where trees\r\nhad come up at their own sweet will, and grown into individual shapes\r\nand sizes, where blue-eyed ivy twined about their roots and wild-briar\r\nroses rioted over the grey paling fence. Straight ahead, closing the\r\nvista between the orchards, was a little slope covered with huge white\r\nbirches, among which were the big New Moon barns, and beyond the new\r\norchard a little, lovable red road looped lightly up and up, over a\r\nhill, until it seemed to touch the vivid blue of the sky.\r\n\r\nCousin Jimmy came down from the barns, carrying brimming pails of\r\nmilk, and Emily ran with him to the dairy behind the cook-house. Such\r\na delightful spot she had never seen or imagined. It was a snow-white\r\nlittle building in a clump of tall balm-of-gileads. Its grey roof was\r\ndotted over with cushions of moss like fat green-velvet mice. You went\r\ndown six sandstone steps, with ferns crowding about them, and opened a\r\nwhite door with a glass panel in it, and went down three more steps.\r\nAnd then you were in a clean, earthy-smelling, damp, cool place with\r\nan earthen floor and windows screened by the delicate emerald of young\r\nhop-vines, and broad wooden shelves all around, whereon stood wide,\r\nshallow pans of glossy brown ware, full of milk coated over with cream\r\nso rich that it was positively yellow.\r\n\r\nAunt Laura was waiting for them and she strained the milk into empty\r\npans and then skimmed some of the full ones. Emily thought skimming was\r\na lovely occupation and longed to try her hand at it. She also longed\r\nto sit right down and write a description of that dear dairy; but\r\nalas, there was no account book; still, she could write it in her head.\r\nShe squatted down on a little three-legged stool in a dim corner and\r\nproceeded to do it, sitting so still that Jimmy and Laura forgot her\r\nand went away and later had to hunt for her a quarter of an hour. This\r\ndelayed breakfast and made Aunt Elizabeth very cross. But Emily had\r\nfound just the right sentence to define the clear yet dim green light\r\nthat filled the dairy and was so happy over it that she didn’t mind\r\nAunt Elizabeth’s black looks a bit.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast Aunt Elizabeth informed Emily that henceforth it would\r\nbe one of her duties to drive the cows to pasture every morning.\r\n\r\n“Jimmy has no hired man just now and it will save him a few minutes.”\r\n\r\n“And don’t be afraid,” added Aunt Laura, “the cows know the way so well\r\nthey’ll go of themselves. You have only to follow and shut the gates.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not afraid,” said Emily.\r\n\r\nBut she was. She knew nothing about cows; still, she was determined\r\nthat the Murrays should not suspect a Starr was scared. So, her heart\r\nbeating like a trip-hammer, she sallied valiantly forth and found that\r\nwhat Aunt Laura had said was true and cows were not such ferocious\r\nanimals after all. They went gravely on ahead and she had only to\r\nfollow, through the old orchard and then through the scrub maple growth\r\nbeyond, along a twisted ferny path where the Wind Woman was purring and\r\npeeping around the maple clumps.\r\n\r\nEmily loitered by the pasture gate until her eager eyes had taken in\r\nall the geography of the landscape. The old pasture ran before her in\r\na succession of little green bosoms right down to the famous Blair\r\nWater--an almost perfectly round pond, with grassy, sloping, treeless\r\nmargins. Beyond it was the Blair Water valley, filled with homesteads,\r\nand further out the great sweep of the white-capped gulf. It seemed to\r\nEmily’s eyes a charming land of green shadows and blue waters. Down\r\nin one corner of the pasture, walled off by an old stone dyke, was the\r\nlittle private graveyard where the dead-and-gone Murrays were buried.\r\nEmily wanted to go and explore it, but was afraid to trust herself in\r\nthe pasture.\r\n\r\n“I’ll go as soon as I get better acquainted with the cows,” she\r\nresolved.\r\n\r\nOff to the right, on the crest of a steep little hill, covered with\r\nyoung birches and firs, was a house that puzzled and intrigued Emily.\r\nIt was grey and weather-worn, but it didn’t look old. It had never been\r\nfinished; the roof was shingled but the sides were not, and the windows\r\nwere boarded over. Why had it never been finished? And it was meant to\r\nbe such a pretty little house--a house you could love--a house where\r\nthere would be nice chairs and cozy fires and bookcases and lovely,\r\nfat, purry cats and unexpected corners; then and there she named it the\r\nDisappointed House, and many an hour thereafter did she spend finishing\r\nthat house, furnishing it as it should be furnished, and inventing the\r\nproper people and animals to live in it.\r\n\r\nTo the left of the pasture field was another house of a quite different\r\ntype--a big, old house, tangled over with vines, flat-roofed, with\r\nmansard windows, and a general air of indifference and neglect about\r\nit. A large, untidy lawn, overgrown with unpruned shrubs and trees,\r\nstraggled right down to the pond, where enormous willows drooped over\r\nthe water. Emily decided that she would ask Cousin Jimmy about these\r\nhouses when she got a good chance.\r\n\r\nShe felt that, before she went back, she must slip along the pasture\r\nfence and explore a certain path which she saw entering the grove of\r\nspruce and maple further down. She did--and found that it led straight\r\ninto Fairyland,--along the bank of a wide, lovely brook--a wild, dear,\r\nlittle path with lady-ferns beckoning and blowing along it, the shyest\r\nof elfin June-bells under the firs, and little whims of loveliness at\r\nevery curve. She breathed in the tang of fir-balsam and saw the shimmer\r\nof gossamers high up in the boughs, and everywhere the frolic of elfin\r\nlights and shadows. Here and there the young maple branches interlaced\r\nas if to make a screen for dryad faces--Emily knew all about dryads,\r\nthanks to her father--and the great sheets of moss under the trees were\r\nmeet for Titania’s couch.\r\n\r\n“This is one of the places where dreams grow,” said Emily happily.\r\n\r\nShe wished the path might go on forever, but presently it veered away\r\nfrom the brook, and when she had scrambled over a mossy, old board\r\nfence she found herself in the “front-garden” of New Moon, where Cousin\r\nJimmy was pruning some spirea bushes.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Cousin Jimmy, I’ve found the dearest little road,” said Emily\r\nbreathlessly.\r\n\r\n“Coming up through Lofty John’s bush?”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it our bush?” asked Emily, rather disappointed.\r\n\r\n“No, but it ought to be. Fifty years ago Uncle Archibald sold that jog\r\nof land to Lofty John’s father--old Mike Sullivan. He built a little\r\nhouse down near the pond and lived there till he quarrelled with Uncle\r\nArchibald--which wasn’t long, of course. Then he moved his house across\r\nthe road--and Lofty John lives there now. Elizabeth has tried to buy\r\nthe land back from him--she’s offered him far more than it’s worth--but\r\nLofty John won’t sell--just for spite, seeing that he has a good farm\r\nof his own and this piece isn’t much good to him. He only pastures a\r\nfew young cattle on it through the summer, and what was cleared is\r\nall growing up with scrub maple. It’s a thorn in Elizabeth’s side and\r\nlikely to be as long as Lofty John nurses his spite.”\r\n\r\n“Why is he called Lofty John?”\r\n\r\n“Because he’s a high and lofty fellow. But never mind him. I want to\r\nshow you round my garden, Emily. It’s mine. Elizabeth bosses the farm;\r\nbut she lets me run the garden--to make up for pushing me into the\r\nwell.”\r\n\r\n“_Did_ she do that?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. She didn’t mean to, of course. We were just children--I was\r\nhere on a visit--and the men were putting a new hood on the well and\r\ncleaning it. It was open--and we were playing tag around it. I made\r\nElizabeth mad--forget what I said--’twasn’t _hard_ to make her mad,\r\nyou understand--and she made to give me a bang on the head. I saw it\r\ncoming--and stepped back to get out of the way--and down I went, head\r\nfirst. Don’t remember anything more about it. There was nothing but mud\r\nat the bottom--but my head struck the stones at the side. I was took up\r\nfor dead--my head all cut up. Poor Elizabeth was--” Cousin Jimmy shook\r\nhis head, as if to intimate that it was impossible to describe how or\r\nwhat poor Elizabeth was. “I got about after a while, though--pretty\r\nnear as good as new. Folks say I’ve never been quite right since--but\r\nthey only say that because I’m a poet, and because nothing ever worries\r\nme. Poets are so scarce in Blair Water folks don’t understand them, and\r\nmost people worry so much, they think you’re not right if you don’t\r\nworry.”\r\n\r\n“Won’t you recite some of your poetry to me, Cousin Jimmy?” asked Emily\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n“When the spirit moves me I will. It’s no use to ask me when the spirit\r\ndon’t move me.”\r\n\r\n“But how am I to know when the spirit moves you, Cousin Jimmy?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll begin of my own accord to recite my compositions. But I’ll tell\r\nyou this--the spirit generally moves me when I’m boiling the pigs’\r\npotatoes in the fall. Remember that and be around.”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you write your poetry down?”\r\n\r\n“Paper’s too scarce at New Moon. Elizabeth has some pet economies and\r\nwriting paper of any kind is one of them.”\r\n\r\n“But haven’t you any money of your own, Cousin Jimmy?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Elizabeth pays me good wages. But she puts all my money in the\r\nbank and just doles out a few dollars to me once in a while. She says\r\nI’m not fit to be trusted with money. When I came here to work for\r\nher she paid me my wages at the end of the month and I started for\r\nShrewsbury to put it in the bank. Met a tramp on the road--a poor,\r\nforlorn creature without a cent. I gave _him_ the money. Why not? _I_\r\nhad a good home and a steady job and clothes enough to do me for years.\r\nI s’pose it was the foolishest thing I ever did--and the nicest. But\r\nElizabeth never got over it. _She’s_ managed my money ever since. But\r\ncome you now, and I’ll show you my garden before I have to go and sow\r\nturnips.”\r\n\r\nThe garden was a beautiful place, well worthy Cousin Jimmy’s pride.\r\nIt seemed like a garden where no frost could wither or rough wind\r\nblow--a garden remembering a hundred vanished summers. There was a high\r\nhedge of clipped spruce all around it, spaced at intervals by tall\r\nlombardies. The north side was closed in by a thick grove of spruce\r\nagainst which a long row of peonies grew, their great red blossoms\r\nsplendid against its darkness. One big spruce grew in the center of the\r\ngarden and underneath it was a stone bench, made of flat shore stones\r\nworn smooth by long polish of wind and wave. In the southeast corner\r\nwas an enormous clump of lilacs, trimmed into the semblance of one\r\nlarge drooping-boughed tree, gloried over with purple. An old summer\r\nhouse, covered with vines, filled the southwest corner. And in the\r\nnorthwest corner there was a sun-dial of grey stone, placed just where\r\nthe broad red walk that was bordered with striped grass, and picked out\r\nwith pink conchs, ran off into Lofty John’s bush. Emily had never seen\r\na sun-dial before and hung over it enraptured.\r\n\r\n“Your great-great grandfather, Hugh Murray, had that brought out from\r\nthe Old Country,” said Cousin Jimmy. “There isn’t as fine a one in the\r\nMaritime Provinces. And Uncle George Murray brought those conchs from\r\nthe Indies. He was a sea-captain.”\r\n\r\nEmily looked about her with delight. The garden was lovely and the\r\nhouse quite splendid to her childish eyes. It had a big front porch\r\nwith Grecian columns. These were thought very elegant in Blair Water,\r\nand went far to justify the Murray pride. A schoolmaster had said\r\nthey gave the house a classical air. To be sure, the classical effect\r\nwas just now rather smothered in hop vines that rioted over the whole\r\nporch and hung in pale-green festoons above the rows of potted scarlet\r\ngeraniums that flanked the steps.\r\n\r\nEmily’s heart swelled with pride.\r\n\r\n“It’s a noble house,” she said.\r\n\r\n“And what about my garden?” demanded Cousin Jimmy jealously.\r\n\r\n“It’s fit for a queen,” said Emily, gravely and sincerely.\r\n\r\nCousin Jimmy nodded, well pleased, and then a strange sound crept into\r\nhis voice and an odd look into his eyes.\r\n\r\n“There is a spell woven round this garden. The blight shall spare it\r\nand the green worm pass it by. Drought dares not invade it and the rain\r\ncomes here gently.”\r\n\r\nEmily took an involuntary step backward--she almost felt like running\r\naway. But now Cousin Jimmy was himself again.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t this grass about the sun-dial like green velvet? I’ve taken\r\nsome pains with it, I can tell you. You make yourself at home in this\r\ngarden.” Cousin Jimmy made a splendid gesture. “I confer the freedom of\r\nit upon you. Good-luck to you, and may you find the Lost Diamond.”\r\n\r\n“The Lost Diamond?” said Emily wonderingly. What fascinating thing was\r\nthis?\r\n\r\n“Never hear the story? I’ll tell it to-morrow--Sunday’s lazy day at\r\nNew Moon. I must get off to my turnips now or I’ll have Elizabeth out\r\nlooking at me. She won’t say anything--she’ll just _look_. Ever seen\r\nthe real Murray look?”\r\n\r\n“I guess I saw it when Aunt Ruth pulled me out from under the table,”\r\nsaid Emily ruefully.\r\n\r\n“No--no. That was the Ruth Dutton look--spite and malice and all\r\nuncharitableness. I hate Ruth Dutton. She laughs at my poetry--not\r\nthat she ever hears any of it. The spirit never moves when Ruth is\r\naround. Dunno where they got her. Elizabeth is a crank but she’s sound\r\nas a nut, and Laura’s a saint. But Ruth’s worm-eaten. As for the\r\nMurray look, you’ll know it when you see it. It’s as well-known as the\r\nMurray pride. We’re a darn queer lot--but we’re the finest people ever\r\nhappened. I’ll tell you all about us to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nCousin Jimmy kept his promise while the aunts were away at church. It\r\nhad been decided in family conclave that Emily was not to go to church\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\n“She has nothing suitable to wear,” said Aunt Elizabeth. “By next\r\nSunday we will have her white dress ready.”\r\n\r\nEmily was disappointed that she was not to go to church. She had always\r\nfound church very interesting on the rare occasions when she got there.\r\nIt had been too far at Maywood for her father to walk but sometimes\r\nEllen Greene’s brother had taken her and Ellen.\r\n\r\n“Do you think, Aunt Elizabeth,” she said wistfully, “that God would\r\nbe much offended if I wore my black dress to church? Of course it’s\r\ncheap--I think Ellen Greene paid for it herself--but it covers me all\r\nup.”\r\n\r\n“Little girls who do not understand things should hold their tongues,”\r\nsaid Aunt Elizabeth. “I do not choose that Blair Water people should\r\nsee my niece in such a dress as that wretched black merino. And if\r\nEllen Greene paid for it we must repay her. You should have told us\r\nthat before we came away from Maywood. No, you are not going to church\r\nto-day. You can wear the black dress to school to-morrow. We can cover\r\nit up with an apron.”\r\n\r\nEmily resigned herself with a sigh of disappointment to staying home;\r\nbut it was very pleasant after all. Cousin Jimmy took her for a walk to\r\nthe pond, showed her the graveyard and opened the book of yesterday for\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“Why are all the Murrays buried here?” asked Emily. “Is it really\r\nbecause they are too good to be buried with common people?”\r\n\r\n“No--no, pussy. We don’t carry our pride as far as _that_. When old\r\nHugh Murray settled at New Moon there was nothing much but woods for\r\nmiles and no graveyards nearer than Charlottetown. That’s why the old\r\nMurrays were buried here--and later on we kept it up because we wanted\r\nto lie with our own, here on the green, green banks of the old Blair\r\nWater.”\r\n\r\n“That sounds like a line out of a poem, Cousin Jimmy,” said Emily.\r\n\r\n“So it is--out of one of my poems.”\r\n\r\n“I kind of like the idea of a ’sclusive burying-ground like this,” said\r\nEmily decidedly, looking around her approvingly at the velvet grass\r\nsloping down to the fairy-blue pond, the neat walks, the well-kept\r\ngraves.\r\n\r\nCousin Jimmy chuckled.\r\n\r\n“And yet they say you ain’t a Murray,” he said. “Murray and Byrd and\r\nStarr--and a dash of Shipley to boot, or Cousin Jimmy Murray is much\r\nmistaken.”\r\n\r\n“Shipley?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--Hugh Murray’s wife--your great-great-grandmother--was a\r\nShipley--an Englishwoman. Ever hear of how the Murrays came to New\r\nMoon?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“They were bound for Quebec--hadn’t any notion of coming to P. E. I.\r\nThey had a long rough voyage and water got scarce, so the captain of\r\nthe _New Moon_ put in here to get some. Mary Murray had nearly died\r\nof sea-sickness coming out--never seemed to get her sea-legs--so the\r\ncaptain, being sorry for her, told her she could go ashore with the\r\nmen and feel solid ground under her for an hour or so. Very gladly she\r\nwent and when she got to shore she said, ‘Here I stay.’ And stay she\r\ndid; nothing could budge her; old Hugh--he was young Hugh then, of\r\ncourse--coaxed and stormed and raged and argued--and even cried, I’ve\r\nbeen told--but Mary wouldn’t be moved. In the end he gave in and had\r\nhis belongings landed and stayed, too. So that is how the Murrays came\r\nto P. E. Island.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad it happened like that,” said Emily.\r\n\r\n“So was old Hugh in the long run. And yet it rankled, Emily--it\r\nrankled. He never forgave his wife with a whole heart. Her grave is\r\nover there in the corner--that one with the flat red stone. Go you and\r\nlook at what he had put on it.”\r\n\r\nEmily ran curiously over. The big flat stone was inscribed with one of\r\nthe long, discursive epitaphs of an older day. But beneath the epitaph\r\nwas no scriptural verse or pious psalm. Clear and distinct, in spite of\r\nage and lichen, ran the line, “Here I stay.”\r\n\r\n“_That’s_ how he got even with her,” said Cousin Jimmy. “He was a good\r\nhusband to her--and she was a good wife and bore him a fine family--and\r\nhe never was the same after her death. But that rankled in him until it\r\nhad to come out.”\r\n\r\nEmily gave a little shiver. Somehow, the idea of that grim old ancestor\r\nwith his undying grudge against his nearest and dearest was rather\r\nterrifying.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad I’m only _half_ Murray,” she said to herself. Aloud--“Father\r\ntold me it was a Murray tradition not to carry spite past the grave.”\r\n\r\n“So ’tis now--but it took its rise from this very thing. His family\r\nwere so horrified at it, you see. It made considerable of a scandal.\r\nSome folks twisted it round to mean that old Hugh didn’t believe in the\r\nresurrection, and there was talk of the session taking it up, but after\r\na while the talk died away.”\r\n\r\nEmily skipped over to another lichen-grown stone.\r\n\r\n“Elizabeth Burnley--who was she, Cousin Jimmy?”\r\n\r\n“Old William Murray’s wife. He was Hugh’s brother, and came out here\r\nfive years after Hugh did. His wife was a great beauty and had been a\r\nbelle in the Old Country. She didn’t like the P. E. Island woods. She\r\nwas homesick, Emily--scandalous homesick. For weeks after she came\r\nhere she wouldn’t take off her bonnet--just walked the floor in it,\r\ndemanding to be taken back home.”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t she take it off when she went to bed?” asked Emily.\r\n\r\n“Dunno if she did go to bed. Anyway, William wouldn’t take\r\nher back home so in time she took off her bonnet and resigned\r\nherself. Her daughter married Hugh’s son, so Elizabeth was your\r\ngreat-great-grandmother.”\r\n\r\nEmily looked down at the sunken green grave and wondered if any\r\nhomesick dreams haunted Elizabeth Burnley’s slumber of a hundred years.\r\n\r\n“It’s dreadful to be homesick--_I_ know,” she thought sympathetically.\r\n\r\n“Little Stephen Murray is buried over there,” said Cousin Jimmy.\r\n“His was the first marble stone in the burying-ground. He was your\r\ngrandfather’s brother--died when he was twelve. He has,” said Cousin\r\nJimmy solemnly, “become a Murray tradition.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“He was so beautiful and clever and good. He hadn’t a fault--so of\r\ncourse he couldn’t live. They say there never was such a handsome child\r\nin the connection. And lovable--everybody loved him. He has been dead\r\nfor ninety years--not a Murray living to-day ever saw him--and yet\r\nwe talk about him at family gatherings--he’s more real than lots of\r\nliving people. So you see, Emily, he must have been an extraordinary\r\nchild--but it ended in that--” Cousin Jimmy waved his hand towards the\r\ngrassy grave and the white, prim headstone.\r\n\r\n“I wonder,” thought Emily, “if any one will remember _me_ ninety years\r\nafter I’m dead.”\r\n\r\n“This old yard is nearly full,” reflected Cousin Jimmy. “There’s just\r\nroom in yonder corner for Elizabeth and Laura--and me. None for you,\r\nEmily.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to be buried here,” flashed Emily. “I think it’s splendid\r\nto have a graveyard like this in the family--but _I_ am going to be\r\nburied in Charlottetown graveyard with Father and Mother. But there’s\r\none thing worries me Cousin Jimmy, do _you_ think I’m likely to die of\r\nconsumption?”\r\n\r\nCousin Jimmy looked judicially down into her eyes.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said, “no, Miss Puss. You’ve got enough life in _you_ to carry\r\nyou far. You aren’t meant for death.”\r\n\r\n“I feel that, too,” said Emily, nodding. “And now, Cousin Jimmy, _why_\r\nis that house over there disappointed?”\r\n\r\n“Which one?--oh, Fred Clifford’s house. Fred Clifford began to build\r\nthat house thirty years ago. He was to be married and his lady picked\r\nout the plan. And when the house was just as far along as you see\r\nshe jilted him, Emily--right in the face of day she jilted him.\r\nNever another nail was driven in the house. Fred went out to British\r\nColumbia. He’s living there yet--married and happy. But he won’t sell\r\nthat lot to any one--so I reckon he feels the sting yet.”\r\n\r\n“I’m so sorry for that house. I _wish_ it had been finished. It _wants_\r\nto be--even yet it _wants_ to be.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I reckon it never will. Fred had a bit of Shipley in him, too,\r\nyou see. One of old Hugh’s girls was his grandmother. And Doctor\r\nBurnley up there in the big grey house has more than a bit.”\r\n\r\n“Is he a relation of ours, too, Cousin Jimmy?”\r\n\r\n“Forty-second cousin. Way back he had a cousin of Mary Shipley’s for a\r\ngreat-something. That was in the Old Country--his forebears came out\r\nhere after we did. He’s a good doctor but an odd stick--odder by far\r\nthan I am, Emily, and yet nobody ever says he’s not all there. Can you\r\naccount for that? _He_ doesn’t believe in God--and _I_ am not such a\r\nfool as that.”\r\n\r\n“Not in _any_ God?”\r\n\r\n“Not in any God. He’s an infidel, Emily. And he’s bringing his little\r\ngirl up the same way, which _I_ think is a shame, Emily,” said Cousin\r\nJimmy confidentially.\r\n\r\n“Doesn’t her mother teach her things?”\r\n\r\n“Her mother is--dead,” answered Cousin Jimmy, with a little odd\r\nhesitation. “Dead these ten years,” he added in a firmer tone. “Ilse\r\nBurnley is a great girl--hair like daffodils and eyes like yellow\r\ndiamonds.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Cousin Jimmy, you promised you’d tell me about the Lost Diamond,”\r\ncried Emily eagerly.\r\n\r\n“To be sure--to be sure. Well, it’s there--somewhere in or about the\r\nold summer-house, Emily. Fifty years ago Edward Murray and his wife\r\ncame here from Kingsport for a visit. A great lady she was, and wearing\r\nsilks and diamonds like a queen, though no beauty. She had a ring on\r\nwith a stone in it that cost two hundred pounds, Emily. That was a\r\nbig lot of money to be wearing on one wee woman-finger, wasn’t it? It\r\nsparkled on her white hand as she held her dress going up the steps of\r\nthe summer house; but when she came down the steps it was gone.”\r\n\r\n“And was it _never_ found?” asked Emily breathlessly.\r\n\r\n“Never--and for no lack of searching. Edward Murray wanted to have the\r\nhouse pulled down--but Uncle Archibald wouldn’t hear of it--because he\r\nhad built it for his bride. The two brothers quarrelled over it and\r\nwere never good friends again. Everybody in the connection has taken\r\na spell hunting for the diamond. Most folks think it fell out of the\r\nsummer house among the flowers or shrubs. But I know better, Emily. I\r\nknow Miriam Murray’s diamond is somewhere about that old house yet. On\r\nmoonlit nights, Emily, I’ve seen it glinting--glinting and beckoning.\r\nBut never in the same place--and when you go to it--it’s gone, and you\r\nsee it laughing at you from somewhere else.”\r\n\r\nAgain there was that eerie, indefinable something in Cousin Jimmy’s\r\nvoice or look that gave Emily a sudden crinkly feeling in her spine.\r\nBut she loved the way he talked to her, as if she were grown-up; and\r\nshe loved the beautiful land around her; and, in spite of the ache for\r\nher father and the house in the hollow which persisted all the time and\r\nhurt her so much at night that her pillow was wet with secret tears,\r\nshe was beginning to be a little glad again in sunset and bird song\r\nand early white stars, in moonlit nights and singing winds. She knew\r\nlife was going to be wonderful here--wonderful and interesting, what\r\nwith out-door cook-houses and cream-girdled dairies and pond paths\r\nand sun-dials, and Lost Diamonds, and Disappointed Houses and men who\r\ndidn’t believe in _any_ God--not even Ellen Greene’s God. Emily hoped\r\nshe would soon see Dr. Burnley. She was very curious to see what an\r\ninfidel looked like. And she had already quite made up her mind that\r\nshe would find the Lost Diamond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTRIAL BY FIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth drove Emily to school the next morning. Aunt Laura had\r\nthought that, since there was only a month before vacation, it was not\r\nworth while for Emily to “start school.” But Aunt Elizabeth did not yet\r\nfeel comfortable with a small niece skipping around New Moon, poking\r\ninto everything insatiably, and was resolved that Emily must go to\r\nschool to get her out of the way. Emily herself, always avid for new\r\nexperiences, was quite keen to go, but for all that she was seething\r\nwith rebellion as they drove along. Aunt Elizabeth had produced a\r\nterrible gingham apron and an equally terrible gingham sunbonnet from\r\nsomewhere in the New Moon garret, and made Emily put them on. The apron\r\nwas a long sack-like garment, high in the neck, with _sleeves_. Those\r\nsleeves were the crowning indignity. Emily had never seen any little\r\ngirl wearing an apron with sleeves. She rebelled to the point of tears\r\nover wearing it, but Aunt Elizabeth was not going to have any nonsense.\r\nEmily saw the Murray look then; and when she saw it she buttoned her\r\nrebellious feelings tightly up in her soul and let Aunt Elizabeth put\r\nthe apron on her.\r\n\r\n“It was one of your mother’s aprons when she was a little girl, Emily,”\r\nsaid Aunt Laura comfortingly, and rather sentimentally.\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Emily, uncomforted and unsentimental, “I don’t wonder she\r\nran away with Father when she grew up.”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth finished buttoning the apron and gave Emily a none too\r\ngentle push away from her.\r\n\r\n“Put on your sunbonnet,” she ordered.\r\n\r\n“Oh, please, Aunt Elizabeth, don’t make me wear that horrid thing.”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth, wasting no further words, picked up the bonnet and tied\r\nit on Emily’s head. Emily had to yield. But from the depths of the\r\nsunbonnet issued a voice, defiant though tremulous.\r\n\r\n“Anyway, Aunt Elizabeth, you can’t boss God,” it said.\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth was too cross to speak all the way to the schoolhouse.\r\nShe introduced Emily to Miss Brownell, and drove away. School was\r\nalready “in,” so Emily hung her sunbonnet on the porch nail and went to\r\nthe desk Miss Brownell assigned her. She had already made up her mind\r\nthat she did not like Miss Brownell and never would like her.\r\n\r\nMiss Brownell had the reputation in Blair Water of being a fine\r\nteacher--due mainly to the fact that she was a strict disciplinarian\r\nand kept excellent “order.” She was a thin, middle-aged person with a\r\ncolourless face, prominent teeth, most of which she showed when she\r\nlaughed, and cold, watchful grey eyes--colder even than Aunt Ruth’s.\r\nEmily felt as if those merciless agate eyes saw clean through her to\r\nthe core of her sensitive little soul. Emily could be fearless enough\r\non occasion; but in the presence of a nature which she instinctively\r\nfelt to be hostile to hers she shrank away in something that was more\r\nrepulsion than fear.\r\n\r\nShe was a target for curious glances all the morning. The Blair Water\r\nschool was large and there were at least twenty little girls of about\r\nher own age. Emily looked back curiously at them all and thought the\r\nway they whispered to each other behind hands and books when they\r\nlooked at her very ill-mannered. She felt suddenly unhappy and homesick\r\nand lonesome--she wanted her father and her old home and the dear\r\nthings she loved.\r\n\r\n“The New Moon girl is crying,” whispered a black-eyed girl across the\r\naisle. And then came a cruel little giggle.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter with you, Emily?” said Miss Brownell suddenly and\r\naccusingly.\r\n\r\nEmily was silent. She could not tell Miss Brownell what was the matter\r\nwith her--especially when Miss Brownell used such a tone.\r\n\r\n“When I ask one of my pupils a question, Emily, I am accustomed to\r\nhaving an answer. Why are you crying?”\r\n\r\nThere was another giggle from across the aisle. Emily lifted miserable\r\neyes and in her extremity fell back on a phrase of her father’s.\r\n\r\n“It is a matter that concerns only myself,” she said.\r\n\r\nA red spot suddenly appeared in Miss Brownell’s sallow cheek. Her eyes\r\ngleamed with cold fire.\r\n\r\n“You will remain in during recess as a punishment for your\r\nimpertinence,” she said--but she left Emily alone the rest of the day.\r\n\r\nEmily did not in the least mind staying in at recess, for, acutely\r\nsensitive to her environment as she was, she realized that, for\r\nsome reason she could not fathom, the atmosphere of the school was\r\nantagonistic. The glances cast at her were not only curious but\r\nill-natured. She did not want to go out to the playground with those\r\ngirls. She did not want to go to school in Blair Water. But she would\r\nnot cry any more. She sat erect and kept her eyes on her book. Suddenly\r\na soft, malignant hiss came across the aisle.\r\n\r\n“Miss Pridey--Miss Pridey!”\r\n\r\nEmily looked across at the girl. Large, steady, purplish-grey eyes\r\ngazed into beady, twinkling, black ones--gazed unquailingly--with\r\nsomething in them that cowed and compelled. The black eyes wavered and\r\nfell, their owner covering her retreat with another giggle and toss of\r\nher short braid of hair.\r\n\r\n“I can master _her_,” thought Emily, with a thrill of triumph.\r\n\r\nBut there is strength in numbers and at noon hour Emily found herself\r\nstanding alone on the playground facing a crowd of unfriendly faces.\r\nChildren can be the most cruel creatures alive. They have the herd\r\ninstinct of prejudice against any outsider, and they are merciless in\r\nits indulgence. Emily was a stranger and one of the proud Murrays--two\r\ncounts against her. And there was about her, small and ginghamed and\r\nsunbonneted as she was, a certain reserve and dignity and fineness that\r\nthey resented. And they resented the level way she looked at them, with\r\nthat disdainful face under cloudy black hair, instead of being shy and\r\ndrooping as became an interloper on probation.\r\n\r\n“You are a proud one,” said Black-eyes. “Oh, my, you may have buttoned\r\nboots, but you are living on charity.”\r\n\r\nEmily had not wanted to put on the buttoned boots. She wanted to go\r\nbarefoot as she had always done in summer. But Aunt Elizabeth had told\r\nher that no child from New Moon had ever gone barefoot to school.\r\n\r\n“Oh, just look at the baby apron,” laughed another girl, with a head of\r\nchestnut curls.\r\n\r\nNow Emily flushed. This was indeed the vulnerable point in her armour.\r\nDelighted at her success in drawing blood the curled one tried again.\r\n\r\n“Is that your grandmother’s sunbonnet?”\r\n\r\nThere was a chorus of giggles.\r\n\r\n“Oh, she wears a sunbonnet to save her complexion,” said a bigger girl.\r\n“That’s the Murray pride. The Murrays are rotten with pride, my mother\r\nsays.”\r\n\r\n“You’re awful ugly,” said a fat, squat little miss, nearly as broad as\r\nshe was long. “Your ears look like a cat’s.”\r\n\r\n“You needn’t be so proud,” said Black-eyes. “Your kitchen ceiling isn’t\r\nplastered even.”\r\n\r\n“And your Cousin Jimmy is an idiot,” said Chestnut-curls.\r\n\r\n“He isn’t!” cried Emily. “He has more sense than any of you. You can\r\nsay what you like about me but you are not going to _insult my family_.\r\nIf you say one more word about them I’ll look you over with the evil\r\neye.”\r\n\r\nNobody understood what this threat meant, but that made it all the more\r\neffective. It produced a brief silence. Then the baiting began again in\r\na different form.\r\n\r\n“Can you sing?” asked a thin, freckled girl, who yet contrived to be\r\nvery pretty in spite of thinness and freckles.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Emily.\r\n\r\n“Can you dance?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Can you sew?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Can you cook?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Can you knit lace?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Can you crochet?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Then what _can_ you do?” said the freckled-one in a contemptuous tone.\r\n\r\n“I can write poetry,” said Emily, without in the least meaning to\r\nsay it. But at that instant she knew she _could_ write poetry. And\r\nwith this queer unreasonable conviction came--the flash! Right there,\r\nsurrounded by hostility and suspicion, fighting alone for her standing,\r\nwithout backing or advantage, came the wonderful moment when soul\r\nseemed to cast aside the bonds of flesh and spring upward to the\r\nstars. The rapture and delight on Emily’s face amazed and enraged her\r\nfoes. They thought it a manifestation of Murray pride in an uncommon\r\naccomplishment.\r\n\r\n“You lie,” said Black-eyes bluntly.\r\n\r\n“A Starr does not lie,” retorted Emily. The flash was gone, but its\r\nuplift remained. She looked them all over with a cool detachment that\r\nquelled them temporarily.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you like me?” she asked directly.\r\n\r\nThere was no reply. Emily looked straight at Chestnut-curls and\r\nrepeated her question. Chestnut-curls felt herself compelled to answer\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Because you ain’t a bit like us,” she muttered.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t want to be,” said Emily scornfully.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my, you are one of the Chosen People,” mocked Black-eyes.\r\n\r\n“Of course I am,” retorted Emily.\r\n\r\nShe walked away to the schoolhouse, conqueror in that battle.\r\n\r\nBut the forces against her were not so easily cowed. There was much\r\nwhispering and plotting after she had gone in, a conference with some\r\nof the boys, and a handing over of bedizened pencils and chews of gum\r\nfor value received.\r\n\r\nAn agreeable sense of victory and the afterglow of the flash carried\r\nEmily through the afternoon in spite of the fact that Miss Brownell\r\nridiculed her for her mistakes in spelling. Miss Brownell was very fond\r\nof ridiculing her pupils. All the girls in the class giggled except\r\none who had not been there in the morning and was consequently at the\r\ntail. Emily had been wondering who she was. She was as unlike the rest\r\nof the girls as Emily herself, but in a totally different style. She\r\nwas tall, oddly dressed in an overlong dress of faded, striped print,\r\nand barefooted. Her thick hair, cut short, fluffed out all around her\r\nhead in a bushy wave that seemed to be of brilliant spun gold; and her\r\nglowing eyes were of a brown so light and translucent as to be almost\r\namber. Her mouth was large, and she had a saucy, pronounced chin.\r\nPretty she might not be called, but her face was so vivid and mobile\r\nthat Emily could not drag her fascinated eyes from it. And she was the\r\nonly girl in class who did not, sometime through the lesson, get a barb\r\nof sarcasm from Miss Brownell, though she made as many mistakes as the\r\nrest of them.\r\n\r\nAt recess one of the girls came up to Emily with a box in her hand.\r\nEmily knew that she was Rhoda Stuart and thought her very pretty and\r\nsweet. Rhoda had been in the crowd around her at the noon hour but she\r\nhad not said anything. She was dressed in crispy pink gingham; she had\r\nsmooth, lustrous braids of sugar-brown hair, big blue eyes, a rose-bud\r\nmouth, doll-like features and a sweet voice. If Miss Brownell could be\r\nsaid to have a favourite it was Rhoda Stuart, and she seemed generally\r\npopular in her own set and much petted by the older girls.\r\n\r\n“Here is a present for you,” she said sweetly.\r\n\r\nEmily took the box unsuspectingly. Rhoda’s smile would have disarmed\r\nany suspicion. For a moment Emily was happily anticipant as she\r\nremoved the cover. Then with a shriek she flung the box from her, and\r\nstood pale and trembling from head to foot. There was a snake in the\r\nbox--whether dead or alive she did not know and did not care. For any\r\nsnake Emily had a horror and repulsion she could not overcome. The very\r\nsight of one almost paralyzed her.\r\n\r\nA chorus of giggles ran around the porch.\r\n\r\n“Before I’d be so scared of an old dead snake!” scoffed Black-eyes.\r\n\r\n“Can you write poetry about _that_?” giggled Chestnut-curls.\r\n\r\n“I _hate_ you--I hate you!” cried Emily. “You are mean, hateful girls!”\r\n\r\n“Calling names isn’t ladylike,” said the Freckled-one. “I thought a\r\nMurray would be too grand for that.”\r\n\r\n“If you come to school to-morrow, _Miss_ Starr,” said Black-eyes\r\ndeliberately, “we are going to take that snake and put it around your\r\nneck.”\r\n\r\n“Let me see you do it!” cried a clear, ringing voice. Into their midst\r\nwith a bound came the girl with amber eyes and short hair. “Just let me\r\n_see_ you do it, Jennie Strang!”\r\n\r\n“This isn’t any of your business, Ilse Burnley,” muttered Jennie,\r\nsullenly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, isn’t it? Don’t you sass me, Piggy-eyes.” Ilse walked up to the\r\nretreating Jennie and shook a sunburned fist in her face. “If I catch\r\nyou teasing Emily Starr to-morrow with that snake again I’ll take _it_\r\nby the tail and _you_ by _your_ tail, and slash you across the face\r\nwith it. Mind that, Piggy-eyes. Now you go and pick up that precious\r\nsnake of yours and throw it down on the ash pile.”\r\n\r\nJennie actually went and did it. Ilse faced the others.\r\n\r\n“Clear out, all of you, and leave the New Moon girl alone after this,”\r\nshe said. “If I hear of any more meddling and sneaking I’ll slit your\r\nthroats, and rip out your hearts and tear your eyes out. Yes, and I’ll\r\ncut off your ears and wear them pinned on my dress!”\r\n\r\nCowed by these ferocious threats, or by something in Ilse’s\r\npersonality, Emily’s persecutors drifted away. Ilse turned to Emily.\r\n\r\n“Don’t mind them,” she said contemptuously. “They’re jealous of you,\r\nthat’s all--jealous because you live at New Moon and ride in a fringed\r\ntop-buggy and wear buttoned boots. You smack their mugs if they give\r\nyou any more of their jaw.”\r\n\r\nIlse vaulted the fence and tore off into the maple bush without another\r\nglance at Emily. Only Rhoda Stuart remained.\r\n\r\n“Emily, I’m awful sorry,” she said, rolling her big blue eyes\r\nappealingly. “I didn’t know there was a snake in that box, cross my\r\nheart I didn’t. The girls just told me it was a present for you. You’re\r\nnot mad at me, are you? Because I like you.”\r\n\r\nEmily had been “mad” and hurt and outraged. But this little bit of\r\nfriendliness melted her instantly. In a moment she and Rhoda had their\r\narms around each other, parading across the playground.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to ask Miss Brownell to let you sit with me,” said Rhoda. “I\r\nused to sit with Annie Gregg but she’s moved away. You’d like to sit\r\nwith me, wouldn’t you?”\r\n\r\n“I’d love it,” said Emily warmly. She was as happy as she had been\r\nmiserable. Here was the friend of her dreams. Already she worshipped\r\nRhoda.\r\n\r\n“We _ought_ to sit together,” said Rhoda importantly. “We belong to the\r\ntwo best families in Blair Water. Do you know that if my father had his\r\nrights he would be on the throne of England?”\r\n\r\n“England!” said Emily, too amazed to be anything but an echo.\r\n\r\n“Yes. We are descended from the kings of Scotland,” said Rhoda. “So of\r\ncourse we don’t ’sociate with everybody. My father keeps store and I’m\r\ntaking music lessons. Is your Aunt Elizabeth going to give you music\r\nlessons?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“She ought to. She is very rich, isn’t she?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said Emily again. She wished Rhoda would not ask such\r\nquestions. Emily thought it was hardly good manners. But surely a\r\ndescendant of the Stuart kings ought to know the rules of breeding, if\r\nanybody did.\r\n\r\n“She’s got an awful temper, hasn’t she?” asked Rhoda.\r\n\r\n“No, she hasn’t!” cried Emily.\r\n\r\n“Well, she nearly killed your Cousin Jimmy in one of her rages,” said\r\nRhoda. “That’s true--Mother told me. Why doesn’t your Aunt Laura get\r\nmarried? Has she got a beau? What wages does your Aunt Elizabeth pay\r\nyour Cousin Jimmy?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Rhoda, rather disappointedly. “I suppose you haven’t\r\nbeen at New Moon long enough to find things out. But it must be very\r\ndifferent from what you’ve been used to, I guess. Your father was as\r\npoor as a church mouse, wasn’t he?”\r\n\r\n“My father was a very, _very_ rich man,” said Emily deliberately.\r\n\r\nRhoda stared.\r\n\r\n“I thought he hadn’t a cent.”\r\n\r\n“Neither he had. But people can be rich without money.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see how. But anyhow, _you’ll_ be rich some day--your Aunt\r\nElizabeth will likely leave you all her money, Mother says. So I don’t\r\ncare if you _are_ living on charity--I love you and I’m going to stick\r\nup for you. Have you got a beau, Emily?”\r\n\r\n“No,” cried Emily, blushing violently and quite scandalized at the\r\nidea. “Why, I’m only eleven.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, everybody in our class has a beau. Mine is Teddy Kent. I shook\r\nhands with him after I’d counted nine stars for nine nights without\r\nmissing a night. If you do that the first boy you shake hands with\r\nafterwards is to be your beau. But it’s awful hard to do. It took me\r\nall winter. Teddy wasn’t in school to-day--he’s been sick all June.\r\nHe’s the best-looking boy in Blair Water. You’ll have to have a beau,\r\ntoo, Emily.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t,” declared Emily angrily. “I don’t know a thing about beaux\r\nand I won’t have one.”\r\n\r\nRhoda tossed her head.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I s’pose you think there’s nobody good enough for you, living at\r\nNew Moon. Well, you won’t be able to play Clap-in-and-clap-out if you\r\nhaven’t a beau.”\r\n\r\nEmily knew nothing of the mysteries of Clap-in-and-clap-out, and didn’t\r\ncare. Anyway, she wasn’t going to have a beau and she repeated this in\r\nsuch decided tones that Rhoda deemed it wise to drop the subject.\r\n\r\nEmily was rather glad when the bell rang. Miss Brownell granted Rhoda’s\r\nrequest quite graciously and Emily transferred her goods and chattels\r\nto Rhoda’s seat. Rhoda whispered a good deal during the last hour and\r\nEmily got scolded for it but did not mind.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to have a birthday party the first week in July, and I’m\r\ngoing to invite you, if your aunts will let you come. I’m not going to\r\nhave Ilse Burnley though.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you like her?”\r\n\r\n“No. She’s an awful tomboy. And then her father is an infidel. And so’s\r\nshe. She always spells ‘God’ with a little ‘g’ in her dictation. Miss\r\nBrownell scolds her for it but she does it right along. Miss Brownell\r\nwon’t whip _her_ because she’s setting her cap for Dr. Burnley. But Ma\r\nsays she won’t get him because he hates women. _I_ don’t think it’s\r\nproper to ’sociate with such people. Ilse is an awful wild queer girl\r\nand has an awful temper. So has her father. She doesn’t chum with\r\nanybody. Isn’t it ridic’lus the way she wears her hair? _You_ ought to\r\nhave a bang, Emily. They’re all the rage and you’d look well with one\r\nbecause you’ve such a high forehead. It would make a real beauty of\r\nyou. My, but you have lovely hair, and your hands are just lovely. All\r\nthe Murrays have pretty hands. And you have the _sweetest_ eyes, Emily.”\r\n\r\nEmily had never received so many compliments in her life. Rhoda laid\r\nflattery on with a trowel. Her head was quite turned and she went home\r\nfrom school determined to ask Aunt Elizabeth to cut her hair in a bang.\r\nIf it would make a beauty of her it must be compassed somehow. And she\r\nwould also ask Aunt Elizabeth if she might wear her Venetian beads to\r\nschool next day.\r\n\r\n“The other girls may _respect_ me more then,” she thought.\r\n\r\nShe was alone from the crossroads, where she had parted company with\r\nRhoda, and she reviewed the events of the day with a feeling that,\r\nafter all, she had kept the Starr flag flying, except for a temporary\r\nreverse in the matter of the snake. School was very different from\r\nwhat she had expected it to be, but that was the way in life, she had\r\nheard Ellen Greene say, and you just had to make the best of it. Rhoda\r\nwas a darling; and there was something about Ilse Burnley that one\r\nliked; and as for the rest of the girls Emily got square with them\r\nby pretending she saw them all being hanged in a row for frightening\r\nher to death with a snake, and felt no more resentment towards them,\r\nalthough some of the things that had been said to her rankled bitterly\r\nin her heart for many a day. She had no father to tell them to, and no\r\naccount book to write them out in, so she could not exorcise them.\r\n\r\nShe had no speedy chance to ask for a bang, for there was company at\r\nNew Moon and her aunts were busy getting ready an elaborate supper. But\r\nwhen the preserves were brought on Emily snatched the opportunity of a\r\nlull in the older conversation.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Elizabeth,” she said, “can I have a bang?”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth looked her disdain.\r\n\r\n“No,” she said, “I do not approve of bangs. Of all the silly fashions\r\nthat have come in now-a-days, bangs are the silliest.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Aunt Elizabeth, _do_ let me have a bang. It would make a beauty of\r\nme,--Rhoda says so.”\r\n\r\n“It would take a good deal more than a bang to do that, Emily. We will\r\nnot have bangs at New Moon--except on the Molly cows. _They_ are the\r\nonly creatures that should wear bangs.”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth smiled triumphantly around the table--Aunt Elizabeth\r\n_did_ smile sometimes when she thought she had silenced some small\r\nperson by exquisite ridicule. Emily understood that it was no use to\r\nhope for bangs. Loveliness did not lie that way for her. It was mean of\r\nAunt Elizabeth--mean. She heaved a sigh of disappointment and dismissed\r\nthe idea for the present. There was something else she wanted to know.\r\n\r\n“Why doesn’t Ilse Burnley’s father believe in God?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“’Cause of the trick her mother played him,” said Mr. Slade, with\r\na chuckle. Mr. Slade was a fat, jolly-looking old man with bushy\r\nhair and whiskers. He had already said some things Emily could not\r\nunderstand and which had seemed greatly to embarrass his very lady-like\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n“What trick did Ilse’s mother play?” asked Emily, all agog with\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nNow Aunt Laura looked at Aunt Elizabeth and Aunt Elizabeth looked at\r\nAunt Laura. Then the latter said:\r\n\r\n“Run out and feed the chickens, Emily.”\r\n\r\nEmily rose with dignity.\r\n\r\n“You might just as well tell me that Ilse’s mother isn’t to be talked\r\nabout and I would obey you. I understand _perfectly_ what you mean,”\r\nshe said as she left the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nA SPECIAL PROVIDENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nEmily was sure on that first day at school that she would never like\r\nit. She must go, she knew, in order to get an education and be ready to\r\nearn her own living; but it would always be what Ellen Greene solemnly\r\ncalled “a cross.” Consequently Emily felt quite astonished when, after\r\ngoing to school a few days, it dawned upon her that she was liking\r\nit. To be sure, Miss Brownell did not improve on acquaintance; but\r\nthe other girls no longer tormented her--indeed, to her amazement,\r\nthey seemed suddenly to forget all that had happened and hailed her\r\nas one of themselves. She was admitted to the fellowship of the\r\npack and, although in some occasional tiff she got a dig about baby\r\naprons and Murray pride, there was no more hostility, veiled or open.\r\nBesides, Emily was quite able to give “digs” herself, as she learned\r\nmore about the girls and their weak points, and she could give them\r\nwith such merciless lucidity and irony that the others soon learned\r\nnot to provoke them. Chestnut-curls, whose name was Grace Wells,\r\nand the Freckled-one, whose name was Carrie King, and Jennie Strang\r\nbecame quite chummy with her, and Jennie sent chews of gum and tissue\r\nthumb-papers across the aisle instead of giggles. Emily allowed them\r\nall to enter the outer court of her temple of friendship but only\r\nRhoda was admitted to the inner shrine. As for Ilse Burnley, she did\r\nnot appear after that first day. Ilse, so Rhoda said, came to school\r\nor not, just as she liked. Her father never bothered about her. Emily\r\nalways felt a certain hankering to know more of Ilse, but it did not\r\nseem likely to be gratified.\r\n\r\nEmily was insensibly becoming happy again. Already she felt as if\r\nshe belonged to this old cradle of her family. She thought a great\r\ndeal about the old Murrays; she liked to picture them revisiting the\r\nglimpses of New Moon--Great-grandmother rubbing up her candlesticks and\r\nmaking cheeses; Great-aunt Miriam stealing about looking for her lost\r\ntreasure; homesick Great-great-aunt Elizabeth stalking about in her\r\nbonnet; Captain George, the dashing, bronzed sea-captain, coming home\r\nwith the spotted shells of the Indies; Stephen, the beloved of all,\r\nsmiling from its windows; her own mother dreaming of Father--they all\r\nseemed as real to her as if she had known them in life.\r\n\r\nShe still had terrible hours when she was overwhelmed by grief for\r\nher father and when all the splendours of New Moon could not stifle\r\nthe longing for the shabby little house in the hollow where they had\r\nloved each other so. Then Emily fled to some secret corner and cried\r\nher heart out, emerging with red eyes that always seemed to annoy Aunt\r\nElizabeth. Aunt Elizabeth had become used to having Emily at New Moon\r\nbut she had not drawn any nearer to the child. This hurt Emily always;\r\nbut Aunt Laura and Cousin Jimmy loved her and she had Saucy Sal and\r\nRhoda, fields creamy with clover, soft dark trees against amber skies,\r\nand the madcap music the Wind Woman made in the firs behind the barns\r\nwhen she blew straight up from the gulf; her days became vivid and\r\ninteresting, full of little pleasures and delights, like tiny, opening,\r\ngolden buds on the tree of life. If she could only have had her old\r\nyellow account book, or some equivalent, she could have been fully\r\ncontent. She missed it next to her father, and its enforced burning was\r\nsomething for which she held Aunt Elizabeth responsible and for which\r\nshe felt she could never wholly forgive her. It did not seem possible\r\nto get any substitute. As Cousin Jimmy had said, writing paper of any\r\nkind was scarce at New Moon. Letters were seldom written, and when\r\nthey were a sheet of note-paper sufficed. Emily dared not ask Aunt\r\nElizabeth for any. There were times when she felt she would burst if\r\nshe couldn’t write out some of the things that came to her. She found\r\na certain safety valve in writing on her slate in school; but these\r\nscribblings had to be rubbed off sooner or later--which left Emily with\r\na sense of loss--and there was always the danger that Miss Brownell\r\nwould see them. That, Emily felt, would be unendurable. No stranger\r\neyes must behold these sacred productions. Sometimes she let Rhoda read\r\nthem, though Rhoda rasped her by giggling over her finest flights.\r\nEmily thought Rhoda as near perfection as a human being could be, but\r\ngiggling was her fault.\r\n\r\nBut there is a destiny which shapes the ends of young misses who are\r\nborn with the itch for writing tingling in their baby fingertips, and\r\nin the fulness of time this destiny gave to Emily the desire of her\r\nheart--gave it to her, too, on the very day when she most needed it.\r\nThat was the day, the ill-starred day, when Miss Brownell elected to\r\nshow the fifth class, by example as well as precept, how the _Bugle\r\nSong_ should be read.\r\n\r\nStanding on the platform Miss Brownell, who was not devoid of a\r\nsuperficial, elocutionary knack, read those three wonderful verses.\r\nEmily, who should have been doing a sum in long division, dropped her\r\npencil and listened entranced. She had never heard the _Bugle Song_\r\nbefore--but now she heard it--and _saw_ it--the rose-red splendour\r\nfalling on those storied, snowy summits and ruined castles--the\r\nlights that never were on land or sea streaming over the lakes--she\r\nheard the wild echoes flying through the purple valleys and the misty\r\npasses--the mere sound of the words seemed to make an exquisite echo\r\nin her soul--and when Miss Brownell came to “Horns of elf-land faintly\r\nblowing” Emily trembled with delight. She was snatched out of herself.\r\nShe forgot everything but the magic of that unequalled line--she sprang\r\nfrom her seat, knocking her slate to the floor with a clatter, she\r\nrushed up the aisle, she caught Miss Brownell’s arm.\r\n\r\n“Oh, teacher,” she cried with passionate earnestness, “read that line\r\nover again--oh, read that line over again!”\r\n\r\nMiss Brownell, thus suddenly halted in her elocutionary display, looked\r\ndown into a rapt, uplifted face where great purplish-grey eyes were\r\nshining with the radiance of a divine vision--and Miss Brownell was\r\nangry. Angry with this breach of her strict discipline--angry with this\r\nunseemly display of interest in a third class atom whose attention\r\nshould have been focused on long division. Miss Brownell shut her book\r\nand shut her lips and gave Emily a resounding slap on her face.\r\n\r\n“Go right back to your seat and mind your own business, Emily Starr,”\r\nsaid Miss Brownell, her cold eyes malignant with her fury.\r\n\r\nEmily, thus dashed to earth, moved back to her seat in a daze. Her\r\nsmitten cheek was crimson, but the wound was in her heart. One\r\nmoment ago in the seventh heaven--and now _this_--pain, humiliation,\r\nmisunderstanding! She could not bear it. What had she done to deserve\r\nit? She had never been slapped in her life before. The degradation\r\nand the injustice ate into her soul. She could not cry--this was “a\r\ngrief too deep for tears”--she went home from school in a suppressed\r\nanguish of bitterness and shame and resentment--an anguish that had no\r\noutlet, for she dared not tell her story at New Moon. Aunt Elizabeth,\r\nshe felt sure, would say that Miss Brownell had done quite right, and\r\neven Aunt Laura, kind and sweet as she was, would not understand. She\r\nwould be grieved because Emily had misbehaved in school and had had to\r\nbe punished.\r\n\r\n“Oh, if I could only tell Father all about it!” thought Emily.\r\n\r\nShe could not eat any supper--she did not think she would ever be able\r\nto eat again. And oh, how she hated that unjust, horrid Miss Brownell!\r\nShe could never forgive her--never! If there were only some way in\r\nwhich she could get square with Miss Brownell! Emily, sitting small and\r\npale and quiet at the New Moon supper table, was a seething volcano\r\nof wounded feeling and misery and pride--ay, pride! Worse even than\r\nthe injustice was the sting of humiliation over this thing that had\r\nhappened. She, Emily Byrd Starr, on whom no hand had ever before been\r\nungently laid, had been slapped like a naughty baby before the whole\r\nschool. Who could endure this and live?\r\n\r\nThen destiny stepped in and drew Aunt Laura to the sitting-room\r\nbookcase to look in its lower compartment for a certain letter she\r\nwanted to see. She took Emily with her to show her a curious old\r\nsnuff-box that had belonged to Hugh Murray, and in rummaging for it\r\nlifted out a big, flat bundle of dusty paper--paper of a deep pink\r\ncolour in oddly long and narrow sheets.\r\n\r\n“It’s time these old letter-bills were burned,” she said. “What a pile\r\nof them! They’ve been here gathering dust for years and they are no\r\nearthly good. Father once kept the post-office here at New Moon, you\r\nknow, Emily. The mail came only three times a week then, and each day\r\nthere was one of these long red ‘letter-bills,’ as they were called.\r\nMother always kept them, though when once used they were of no further\r\nuse. But I’m going to burn them right away.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Aunt Laura,” gasped Emily, so torn between desire and fear that\r\nshe could hardly speak. “Oh, don’t do that--give them to me--_please_\r\ngive them to me.”\r\n\r\n“Why, child, what ever do you want of them?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Aunty, they have such lovely blank backs for writing on. Please,\r\nAunt Laura, it would be a _sin_ to burn those letter-bills.”\r\n\r\n“You can have them, dear. Only you’d better not let Elizabeth see them.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t--I won’t,” breathed Emily.\r\n\r\nShe gathered her precious booty into her arms and fairly ran\r\nupstairs--and then upstairs again into the garret, where she already\r\nhad her “favourite haunt,” in which her uncomfortable habit of thinking\r\nof things thousands of miles away could not vex Aunt Elizabeth. This\r\nwas the quiet corner of the dormer window, where shadows always moved\r\nabout, softly and swingingly, and beautiful mosaics patterned the bare\r\nfloor. From it one could see over the tree-tops right down to the Blair\r\nWater. The walls were hung around with great bundles of soft fluffy\r\nrolls, all ready for spinning, and hanks of untwisted yarn. Sometimes\r\nAunt Laura spun on the great wheel at the other end of the garret and\r\nEmily loved the whirr of it.\r\n\r\nIn the recess of the dormer window she crouched--breathlessly she\r\nselected a letter-bill and extracted a lead pencil from her pocket. An\r\nold sheet of cardboard served as a desk; she began to write feverishly.\r\n\r\n“Dear Father”--and then she poured out her tale of the day--of her\r\nrapture and her pain--writing heedlessly and intently until the sunset\r\nfaded into dim, star-litten twilight. The chickens went unfed--Cousin\r\nJimmy had to go himself for the cows--Saucy Sal got no new milk--Aunt\r\nLaura had to wash the dishes--what mattered it? Emily, in the\r\ndelightful throes of literary composition, was lost to all worldly\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nWhen she had covered the backs of four letter-bills she could see to\r\nwrite no more. But she had emptied out her soul and it was once more\r\nfree from evil passions. She even felt curiously indifferent to Miss\r\nBrownell. Emily folded up her letter-bills and wrote clearly across the\r\npacket,\r\n\r\n                    _Mr. Douglas Starr,\r\n                             On the Road to Heaven._\r\n\r\nThen she stepped softly across to an old, worn-out sofa in a far corner\r\nand knelt down, stowing away her letter and her “letter-bills” snugly\r\non a little shelf formed by a board nailed across it underneath.\r\nEmily had discovered this one day when playing in the garret and had\r\nnoted it as a lovely hiding-place for secret documents. Nobody would\r\never come across them there. She had writing paper enough to last for\r\nmonths--there must be hundreds of those jolly old letter-bills.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” cried Emily, dancing down the garret stairs, “I feel as if I was\r\nmade out of star-dust.”\r\n\r\nThereafter few evenings passed on which Emily did not steal up to the\r\ngarret and write a letter, long or short, to her father. The bitterness\r\ndied out of her grief. Writing to him seemed to bring him so near; and\r\nshe told him everything, with a certain honesty of confession that\r\nwas characteristic of her--her triumphs, her failures, her joys, her\r\nsorrows, everything went down on the letter-bills of a Government which\r\nhad not been so economical of paper as it afterwards became. There was\r\nfully half a yard of paper in each bill and Emily wrote a small hand\r\nand made the most of every inch.\r\n\r\n“I like New Moon. It’s so _stately_ and _splendid_ here,” she told her\r\nfather. “And it seems as if we must be very aristokratik when we have a\r\nsun dyal. I can’t help feeling proud of it all. I am afraid I have too\r\nmuch pride and so I ask God every night to take _most_ of it away but\r\nnot quite all. It is very easy to get a repputation for pride in Blair\r\nWater school. If you walk straight and hold your head up you are a\r\nproud one. Rhoda is proud, too, because her father ought to be King of\r\nEngland. I wonder how Queen Victoria would feel if she knew that. It’s\r\nvery wonderful to have a friend who would be a princess if every one\r\nhad their rites. I love Rhoda with all my heart. She is so sweet and\r\nkind. But I don’t like her giggles. And when I told her I could see the\r\nschool wallpaper small in the air she said You lie. It hurt me awfully\r\nto have my dearest friend say that to me. And it hurt me worse when I\r\nwoke up in the night and thought about it. I had to stay awake ever so\r\nlong, too, because I was tired lying on one side and I was afraid to\r\nturn over because Aunt Elizabeth would think I was figitting.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t dare tell Rhoda about the Wind Woman because I suppose\r\nthat really is a kind of lie, though she seems so real to me. I hear\r\nher now singing up on the roof around the big chimneys. I have no\r\nEmily-in-the-glass here. The looking-glasses are all too high up in\r\nthe rooms I’ve been in. I’ve never been in the look-out. It is always\r\nlocked. It was Mother’s room and Cousin Jimmy says her father locked\r\nit up after she ran away with you and Aunt Elizabeth keeps it locked\r\nstill out of respect to his memory, though Cousin Jimmy says Aunt\r\nElizabeth used to fight with her father something scandalus when he was\r\nalive though no outsider knew of it because of the Murray pride. I feel\r\nthat way myself. When Rhoda asked me if Aunt Elizabeth burned candles\r\nbecause she was old-fashioned I answered hawtily no, it was a Murray\r\ntradishun. Cousin Jimmy has told me all the tradishuns of the Murrays.\r\nSaucy Sal is very well and bosses the barns but still she will not have\r\nkittens and I can’t understand it. I asked Aunt Elizabeth about it and\r\nshe said nice little girls didn’t talk about such things but I cannot\r\nsee why kittens are impropper. When Aunt Elizabeth is away Aunt Laura\r\nand I smuggle Sal into the house but when Aunt Elizabeth comes back I\r\nalways feel gilty and wish I hadn’t. _But the next time I do it again._\r\nI think that very strange. I never hear about dear Mike. I wrote Ellen\r\nGreene and asked about him and she replyed and never mentioned Mike but\r\ntold me all about her roomatism. As if I cared about her roomatism.\r\n\r\n“Rhoda is going to have a birthday party and she is going to invite\r\nme. I am so exited. You know I never was to a party before. I think\r\nabout it a great deal and picture it out. Rhoda is not going to invite\r\nall the girls but only a favered few. I hope Aunt Elizabeth will let\r\nme ware my white dress and good hat. Oh, Father, I pinned that lovely\r\npicture of the lace ball dress up on the wall of Aunt Elizabeth’s\r\nroom, just like I had it at home and Aunt Elizabeth took it down and\r\nburned it and skolded me for making pin marks in the paper. I said Aunt\r\nElizabeth you should not have burned that picture. I wanted to have\r\nit when I grow up to have a dress made like it for balls. And Aunt\r\nElizabeth said Do you expect to attend many balls if I may ask and I\r\nsaid Yes when I am rich and famus and Aunt Elizabeth said Yes when the\r\nmoon is made of green cheese.\r\n\r\n“I saw Dr. Burnley yesterday when he came over to buy some eggs from\r\nAunt Elizabeth. I was disappointed because he looks just like other\r\npeople. I thought a man who didn’t believe in God would look queer in\r\nsome way. He did not sware either and I was sorry for I have never\r\nheard any one sware and I am very angshus to. He has big yellow eyes\r\nlike Ilse and a loud voice and Rhoda says when he gets mad you can hear\r\nhim yelling all over Blair Water. There is some mistery about Ilse’s\r\nmother which I cannot fathum. Dr. Burnley and Ilse live alone. Rhoda\r\nsays Dr. Burnley says he will have no devils of women in that house.\r\nThat speech is wikked but striking. Old Mrs. Simms goes over and cooks\r\ndinner and supper for them and then vamooses and they get their own\r\nbreakfast. The doctor sweeps out the house now and then and Ilse never\r\ndoes anything but run wild. The doctor never smiles so Rhoda says. He\r\nmust be like King Henry the Second.\r\n\r\n“I would like to get akwanted with Ilse. She isn’t as sweet as Rhoda\r\nbut I like her looks, too. But she doesn’t come to school much and\r\nRhoda says I mustn’t have any chum but her or she will cry her eyes\r\nout. Rhoda loves me as much as I love her. We are both going to pray\r\nthat we may live together all our lives and die the same day.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Elizabeth always puts up my school dinner for me. She won’t\r\ngive me anything but plain bread and butter but she cuts good thick\r\nslices and the butter is thick too and never has the horrid taste Ellen\r\nGreene’s butter used to have. And Aunt Laura slips in a cooky or an\r\napple turnover when Aunt Elizabeth’s back is turned. Aunt Elizabeth\r\nsays apple turnovers are not helthy for me. Why is it that the nicest\r\nthings never are helthy, Father? Ellen Greene used to say that too.\r\n\r\n“My teacher’s name is Miss Brownell. I don’t like the cut of her jib.\r\n(That is a naughtical frays that Cousin Jimmy uses. I know frays is\r\nnot spelled right but there is no dixonary at New Moon but that is the\r\nsound of it.) She is too sarkastik and she likes to make you rediklus.\r\nThen she laughs at you in a disagreable, snorting way. But I forgave\r\nher for slapping me and I took a boquet to her to school next day to\r\nmake up. She receeved it very coldly and let it fade on her desk. In\r\na story she would have wepped on my neck. I don’t know whether it is\r\nany use forgiving people or not. Yes, it is, it makes you feel more\r\ncomfortable yourself. You never had to ware baby aprons and sunbonnets\r\nbecause you were a boy so you can’t understand how I feel about it.\r\nAnd the aprons are made of such good stuff that they will never ware\r\nout and it will be years before I grow out of them. But I have a white\r\ndress for church with a black silk sash and a white legorn hat with\r\nblack bows and black kid slippers, and I feel very elegant in them.\r\nI wish I could have a bang but Aunt Elizabeth will not hear to it.\r\nRhoda told me I had beautiful eyes. I wish she hadn’t. I have always\r\nsuspekted my eyes were beautiful but I was not sure. Now that I know\r\nthey are I’m afraid I’ll always be wondering if people notis it. I have\r\nto go to bed at half past eight and I don’t like it but I sit up in bed\r\nand look out of the window till it gets dark, so I get square with Aunt\r\nElizabeth that way, and I listen to the sound the sea makes. I like\r\nit now though it always makes me feel sorrowful, but it’s a kind of a\r\nnice sorrow. I have to sleep with Aunt Elizabeth and I don’t like that\r\neither because if I move ever so little she says I figit but she admits\r\nthat I don’t kick. And she won’t let me put the window up. She doesn’t\r\nlike fresh air or light in the house. The parlour is dark as a toomb.\r\nI went in one day and rolled up all the blinds and Aunt Elizabeth was\r\nhorrifyed and called me a little hussy and gave me the Murray look. You\r\nwould suppose I had committed a crime. I felt so insulted that I came\r\nup to the garret and wrote a deskription of myself being drowned on a\r\nletter-bill and then I felt better. Aunt Elizabeth said I was never to\r\ngo into the parlour again without permission but I don’t want to. I am\r\nafraid of the parlour. All the walls are hung over with pictures of our\r\nancesters and there is not one good-looking person among them except\r\nGrand-father Murray who looks handsome but very cross. The spare room\r\nis upstairs and is just as gloomy as the parlour. Aunt Elizabeth only\r\nlets distingwished people sleep there. I like the kitchen in daytime,\r\nand the garret and the cook-house and the sitting-room and the hall\r\nbecause of the lovely red front door and I love the dairy, but I don’t\r\nlike the other New Moon rooms. Oh, I forgot the cellar cubbord. I\r\nlove to go down there and look at the beautiful rows of jam and jelly\r\npots. Cousin Jimmy says it is a New Moon tradishun that the jam pots\r\nmust never be empty. What a lot of tradishuns New Moon has. It is a\r\nvery spashus house, and the trees are lovely. I have named the three\r\nlombardys at the garden gate the Three Princesses and I have named\r\nthe old summer house Emily’s Bower, and the big apple tree by the old\r\norchard gate the Praying Tree because it holds up its long boughs\r\nexactly as Mr. Dare holds up his arms in church where he prays.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Elizabeth has given me the little right hand top burow drawer to\r\nkeep my things in.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Father dear, I have made a great diskoverry. I wish I had made it\r\nwhen you were alive for I think you’d have liked to know. _I can write\r\npoetry._ Perhaps I could have written it long ago if I’d tried. But\r\nafter that first day in school I felt I was bound in honnour to try\r\nand it is so easy. There is a little curly black-covered book in Aunt\r\nElizabeth’s bookcase called Thompson’s Seasons and I decided I would\r\nwrite a poem on a season and the first three lines are,\r\n\r\n    Now Autumn comes ripe with the peech and pear,\r\n    The sportsman’s horn is heard throughout the land,\r\n    And the poor partridge fluttering falls dead.\r\n\r\n“Of course there are no peeches in P. E. Island and I never heard a\r\nsportsman’s horn here either, but you don’t have to stick too close to\r\nfacts in poetry. I filled a whole letter-bill with it and then I ran\r\nand read it to Aunt Laura. I thought she would be overjoyed to find\r\nshe had a niece who could write poetry but she took it very coolly\r\nand said it didn’t sound much like poetry. It’s blank verse I cryed.\r\n_Very_ blank said Aunt Elizabeth sarkastically though I hadn’t asked\r\n_her_ opinion. But I think I will write ryming poetry after this so\r\nthat there will be no mistake about it and I intend to be a poetess\r\nwhen I grow up and become famus. I hope also that I will be silph-like.\r\nA poetess should be silph-like. Cousin Jimmy makes poetry too. He has\r\nmade over 1000 pieces but he never writes any down but carries them\r\nin his head. I offered to give him some of my letter-bills--for he is\r\nvery kind to me--but he said he was too old to learn new habits. I\r\nhaven’t heard any of his poetry yet because the spirit hasn’t moved\r\nhim but I am very angshus to and I am sorry they don’t fatten the pigs\r\ntill the fall. I like Cousin Jimmy more and more all the time, except\r\nwhen he takes his queer spells of looking and talking. Then he fritens\r\nme but they never last long. I have read a good many of the books in\r\nthe New Moon bookcase. A history of the reformation in France, very\r\nrelijus and sad. A little fat book deskribing the months in England\r\nand the afoursaid Thompson’s Seasons. I like to read them because they\r\nhave so many pretty words in them, but I don’t like the feel of them.\r\nThe paper is so rough and thick it makes me creepy. Travels in Spain,\r\nvery fassinating, with lovely smooth shiny paper, a missionary book\r\non the Paciffic Islands, pictures very interesting because of the way\r\nthe heathen chiefs arange their hair. After they became Christians\r\nthey cut it off which I think was a pity. Mrs. Hemans Poems. I am\r\npasshunately fond of poetry, also of stories about desert islands. Rob\r\nRoy, a novel, but I only read a little of it when Aunt Elizabeth said\r\nI must stop because I must not read novels. Aunt Laura says to read\r\nit on the sly. I don’t see why it wouldn’t be all right to obey Aunt\r\nLaura but I have a queer feeling about it and I haven’t yet. A lovely\r\nTiger-book, full of pictures and stories of tigers that make me feel\r\nso nice and shivery. The Royal Road, also relijus but some fun in it\r\nso very good for Sundays. Reuben and Grace, a story but not a novel,\r\nbecause Reuben and Grace are brother and sister and there is no getting\r\nmarried. Little Katy and Jolly Jim, same as above but not so exciting\r\nand traggic. Nature’s Mighty Wonders which is good and improving. Alice\r\nin Wonderland, which is perfectly lovely, and the Memoirs of Anzonetta\r\nB. Peters who was converted at seven and died at twelve. When anybody\r\nasked for a question she answered with a hym verse. That is after she\r\nwas converted. Before that she spoke English. Aunt Elizabeth told me I\r\nought to try to be like Anzonetta. I think I might be an Alice under\r\nmore faverable circumstances but I am sure I can never be as good\r\nas Anzonetta was and I don’t believe I want to be because she never\r\nhad any fun. She got sick as soon as she was converted and suffered\r\naggonies for years. Besides I am sure that if I talked hyms to people\r\nit would exite ridicule. I tried it once. Aunt Laura asked me the other\r\nday if I would like blue stripes better than red in my next winter’s\r\nstockings and I ansered just as Anzonetta did when asked a similar\r\nquestion, only different, about a sack,\r\n\r\n    Jesus Thy blood and rightchusness\r\n    My beauty are, my glorious dress.\r\n\r\nAnd Aunt Laura said was I crazy and Aunt Elizabeth said I was\r\nireverent. So I know it wouldn’t work. Besides, Anzonetta couldn’t eat\r\nanything for years having ulsers in her stomach and I am pretty fond of\r\ngood eating.\r\n\r\n“Old Mr. Wales on the Derry Pond Road is dying of canser. Jennie Strang\r\nsays his wife has her morning all ready.\r\n\r\n“I wrote a biograffy of Saucy Sal to-day and a deskripshun of the road\r\nin Lofty John’s bush. I will pin them to this letter so you can read\r\nthem too. Good night my beloved Father.\r\n\r\n“Yours most obedient humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                  “_Emily B. Starr._\r\n\r\n“P. S. I think Aunt Laura loves me. I like to be loved, Father dear.\r\n\r\n                                        “_E. B. S._”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nGROWING PAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal of suppressed excitement in school during the\r\nlast week in June, the cause thereof being Rhoda Stuart’s birthday\r\nparty, which was to take place early in July. The amount of heart\r\nburning was incredible. Who was to be invited? That was the great\r\nquestion. There were some who knew they wouldn’t and some who knew\r\nthey would; but there were more who were in truly horrible suspense.\r\nEverybody paid court to Emily because she was Rhoda’s dearest friend\r\nand might conceivably have some voice in the selection of guests.\r\nJennie Strang even went as far as bluntly to offer Emily a beautiful\r\nwhite box with a gorgeous picture of Queen Victoria on the cover, to\r\nkeep her pencils in, if she would procure her an invitation. Emily\r\nrefused the bribe and said grandly that she could not interfere in such\r\na delicate matter. Emily really did put on some airs about it. _She_\r\nwas sure of her invitation. Rhoda had told her about the party weeks\r\nbefore and had talked it all over with her. It was to be a very grand\r\naffair--a birthday cake covered with pink icing and adorned with ten\r\ntall pink candles--ice-cream and oranges--and written invitations on\r\npink, gilt-edged notepaper _sent through the post-office_--this last\r\nbeing an added touch of exclusiveness. Emily dreamed about that party\r\nday and night and had her present all ready for Rhoda--a pretty hair\r\nribbon which Aunt Laura had brought from Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\nOn the first Sunday in July Emily found herself sitting beside Jennie\r\nStrang in Sunday School for the opening exercises. Generally she and\r\nRhoda sat together, but now Rhoda was sitting three seats ahead with a\r\nstrange little girl--a very gay and gorgeous little girl, dressed in\r\nblue silk, with a large, flower-wreathed leghorn hat on her elaborately\r\ncurled hair, white lace-work stockings on her pudgy legs and a bang\r\nthat came clean down to her eyes. Not all her fine feathers could make\r\na really fine bird of her, however; she was not in the least pretty and\r\nher expression was cross and contemptuous.\r\n\r\n“Who is the girl sitting with Rhoda?” whispered Emily.\r\n\r\n“Oh, she’s Muriel Porter,” answered Jennie. “She’s a towny, you know.\r\nShe’s come out to spend her vacation with her aunt, Jane Beatty. I\r\nhate her. If I was her I’d never _dream_ of wearing blue with a skin\r\nas dark as hers. But the Porters are rich and Muriel thinks she’s a\r\nwonder. They say Rhoda and her have been _awful thick_ since she came\r\nout--Rhoda’s always chasing after anybody she thinks is up in the\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\nEmily stiffened up. She was not going to listen to disparaging remarks\r\nabout her friends. Jennie felt the stiffening and changed her note.\r\n\r\n“Anyway, I’m _glad_ I’m not invited to Rhoda’s old party. I wouldn’t\r\n_want_ to go when Muriel Porter will be there, putting on her airs.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know you are not invited?” wondered Emily.\r\n\r\n“Why, the invitations went out yesterday. Didn’t you get yours?”\r\n\r\n“No--o--o.”\r\n\r\n“Did you get your mail?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--Cousin Jimmy got it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, maybe Mrs. Beecher forgot to give it to him. Likely you’ll get\r\nit to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nEmily agreed that it was likely. But a queer cold sensation of dismay\r\nhad invaded her being, which was not removed by the fact that after\r\nSunday School Rhoda strutted away with Muriel Porter without a glance\r\nat any one else. On Monday Emily herself went to the post-office,\r\nbut there was no pink envelope for her. She cried herself to sleep\r\nthat night, but did not quite give up hope until Tuesday had passed.\r\nThen she faced the terrible truth--that she--she, Emily Byrd Starr,\r\nof New Moon--had not been invited to Rhoda’s party. The thing was\r\nincredible. There _must_ be a mistake somewhere. Had Cousin Jimmy lost\r\nthe invitation on the road home? Had Rhoda’s grown-up sister who wrote\r\nthe invitations overlooked her name? Had,--Emily’s unhappy doubts\r\nwere forever resolved into bitter certainty by Jennie, who joined her\r\nas she left the post-office. There was a malicious light in Jennie’s\r\nbeady eyes. Jennie liked Emily quite well by now, in spite of their\r\npassage-at-arms on the day of their first meeting, but she liked to see\r\nher pride humbled for all that.\r\n\r\n“So you’re not invited to Rhoda’s party after all.”\r\n\r\n“No,” admitted Emily.\r\n\r\nIt was a very bitter moment for her. The Murray pride was sorely\r\nwrung--and, beneath the Murray pride, something else had been\r\ngrievously wounded but was not yet quite dead.\r\n\r\n“Well, I call it dirt mean,” said Jennie, quite honestly sympathetic in\r\nspite of her secret satisfaction. “After all the fuss she’s made over\r\nyou, too! But that’s Rhoda Stuart all over. Deceitful is no name for\r\n_her_.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think she’s deceitful,” said Emily, loyal to the last ditch.\r\n“I believe there’s some mistake about my not being invited.”\r\n\r\nJennie stared.\r\n\r\n“Then you don’t know the reason? Why, Beth Beatty told me the whole\r\nstory. Muriel Porter hates you and she just up and told Rhoda that she\r\nwould not go to her party if you were invited. And Rhoda was so crazy\r\nto have a town girl there that she promised she wouldn’t invite you.”\r\n\r\n“Muriel Porter doesn’t know me,” gasped Emily. “How can she hate me?”\r\n\r\nJennie grinned impishly.\r\n\r\n“_I_ can tell you. She’s _dead stuck_ on Fred Stuart and Fred knows it\r\nand he teased her by praising _you_ up to her--told her you were the\r\nsweetest girl in Blair Water and he meant to have you for _his girl_\r\nwhen you were a little older. And Muriel was so mad and jealous she\r\nmade Rhoda leave you out. _I_ wouldn’t care if I was you. A Murray of\r\nNew Moon is away above such trash. As for Rhoda not being deceitful,\r\nI can tell you she _is_. Why, she told you that she didn’t know that\r\nsnake was in the box, when it was her thought of doing it in the first\r\nplace.”\r\n\r\nEmily was too crushed to reply. She was glad that Jennie had to\r\nswitch off down her own lane and leave her alone. She hurried home,\r\nafraid that she could not keep the tears back until she got there.\r\nDisappointment about the party--humiliation over the insult--all were\r\nswallowed up in the anguish of a faith betrayed and a trust outraged.\r\nHer love of Rhoda was quite dead now and Emily smarted to the core\r\nof her soul with the pain of the blow that had killed it. It was a\r\nchild’s tragedy--and all the more bitter for that, since there was no\r\none to understand. Aunt Elizabeth told her that birthday parties were\r\nall nonsense and that the Stuarts were not a family that the Murrays\r\nhad ever associated with. And even Aunt Laura, though she petted and\r\ncomforted, did not realize how deep and grievous the hurt had been--so\r\ndeep and grievous that Emily could not even write about it to her\r\nfather, and had no outlet for the violence of emotion that racked her\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nThe next Sunday Rhoda was alone in Sunday School, Muriel Porter having\r\nbeen suddenly summoned back to town by her father’s illness; and Rhoda\r\nlooked sweetly towards Emily. But Emily sailed past her with a head\r\nheld very high and scorn on every lineament. She would _never_ have\r\nanything to do with Rhoda Stuart again--she couldn’t. She despised\r\nRhoda more than ever for trying to get back with her, now that the town\r\ngirl for whom she had sacrificed her was gone. It was not for Rhoda she\r\nmourned--it was for the friendship that had been so dear to her. Rhoda\r\n_had_ been dear and sweet on the surface at least, and Emily had found\r\nintense happiness in their companionship. Now it was gone and she could\r\nnever, _never_ love or trust anybody again. _There_ lay the sting.\r\n\r\nIt poisoned everything. Emily was of a nature which, even as a child,\r\ndid not readily recover from or forget such a blow. She moped about\r\nNew Moon, lost her appetite and grew thin. She hated to go to Sunday\r\nSchool because she thought the other girls exulted in her humiliation\r\nand her estrangement from Rhoda. Some slight feeling of the kind there\r\nwas, perhaps, but Emily morbidly exaggerated it. If two girls whispered\r\nor giggled together she thought she was being discussed and laughed\r\nat. If one of them walked home with her she thought it was out of\r\ncondescending pity because she was friendless. For a month Emily was\r\nthe most unhappy little being in Blair Water.\r\n\r\n“I think I must have been put under a curse at birth,” she reflected\r\ndisconsolately.\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth had a more prosaic idea to account for Emily’s languor\r\nand lack of appetite. She had come to the conclusion that Emily’s heavy\r\nmasses of hair “took from her strength” and that she would be much\r\nstronger and better if it were cut off. With Aunt Elizabeth to decide\r\nwas to act. One morning she coolly informed Emily that her hair was to\r\nbe “shingled.”\r\n\r\nEmily could not believe her ears.\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean that you are going to cut off my hair, Aunt Elizabeth,”\r\nshe exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I mean exactly that,” said Aunt Elizabeth firmly. “You have\r\nentirely too much hair especially for hot weather. I feel sure that is\r\nwhy you have been so miserable lately. Now, I don’t want any crying.”\r\n\r\nBut Emily could not keep the tears back.\r\n\r\n“Don’t cut it _all_ off,” she pleaded. “Just cut a good big bang. Lots\r\nof the girls have their hair banged clean from the crown of their\r\nheads. That would take half my hair off and the rest won’t take too\r\nmuch strength.”\r\n\r\n“There will be no bangs here,” said Aunt Elizabeth. “I’ve told you so\r\noften enough. I’m going to shingle your hair close all over your head\r\nfor the hot weather. You’ll be thankful to me some day for it.”\r\n\r\nEmily felt anything but thankful just then.\r\n\r\n“It’s my one beauty,” she sobbed, “it and my lashes. I suppose you want\r\nto cut off my lashes too.”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth _did_ distrust those long, upcurled fringes of Emily’s,\r\nwhich were an inheritance from the girlish stepmother, and too\r\nun-Murray-like to be approved; but she had no designs against them. The\r\nhair must go, however, and she curtly bade Emily wait there, without\r\nany fuss, until she got the scissors.\r\n\r\nEmily waited--quite hopelessly. She must lose her lovely hair--the\r\nhair her father had been so proud of. It might grow again in time--if\r\nAunt Elizabeth let it--but that would take years, and meanwhile what a\r\nfright she would be! Aunt Laura and Cousin Jimmy were out; she had no\r\none to back her up; this horrible thing must happen.\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth returned with the scissors; they clicked suggestively\r\nas she opened them; that click, as if by magic, seemed to loosen\r\nsomething--some strange formidable power in Emily’s soul. She turned\r\ndeliberately around and faced her aunt. She felt her brows drawing\r\ntogether in an unaccustomed way--she felt an uprush as from unknown\r\ndepths of some irresistible surge of energy.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Elizabeth,” she said, looking straight at the lady with the\r\nscissors, “_my hair is not going to be cut off_. Let me hear no more of\r\nthis.”\r\n\r\nAn amazing thing happened to Aunt Elizabeth. She turned pale--she laid\r\nthe scissors down--she looked aghast for one moment at the transformed\r\nor possessed child before her--and then for the first time in her life\r\nElizabeth Murray turned tail and fled--literally fled--to the kitchen.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter, Elizabeth?” cried Laura, coming in from the\r\ncook-house.\r\n\r\n“I saw--Father--looking from her face,” gasped Elizabeth, trembling.\r\n“And she said, ‘Let me hear no more of this,’--just as _he_ always said\r\nit--his very words.”\r\n\r\nEmily overheard her and ran to the sideboard mirror. She had had, while\r\nshe was speaking, an uncanny feeling of wearing somebody else’s face\r\ninstead of her own. It was vanishing now--but Emily caught a glimpse\r\nof it as it left--the Murray look, she supposed. No wonder it had\r\nfrightened Aunt Elizabeth--it frightened herself--she was glad that it\r\nhad gone. She shivered--she fled to her garret retreat and cried; but\r\nsomehow, she knew that her hair would not be cut.\r\n\r\nNor was it; Aunt Elizabeth never referred to the matter again. But\r\nseveral days passed before she meddled much with Emily.\r\n\r\nIt was a rather curious fact that from that day Emily ceased to\r\ngrieve over her lost friend. The matter had suddenly become of small\r\nimportance. It was as if it had happened so long ago that nothing, save\r\nthe mere emotionless memory of it, remained. Emily speedily regained\r\nappetite and animation, resumed her letters to her father and found\r\nthat life tasted good again, marred only by a mysterious prescience\r\nthat Aunt Elizabeth had it in for her in regard to her defeat in the\r\nmatter of her hair and would get even sooner or later.\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth “got even” within the week. Emily was to go on an errand\r\nto the shop. It was a broiling day and she had been allowed to go\r\nbarefooted at home; but now she must put on boots and stockings. Emily\r\nrebelled--it was too hot--it was too dusty--she couldn’t walk that long\r\nhalf-mile in buttoned boots. Aunt Elizabeth was inexorable. No Murray\r\nmust be seen barefooted away from home--and on they went. But the\r\nminute Emily was outside the New Moon gate she deliberately sat down,\r\ntook them off, stowed them in a hole in the dyke, and pranced away\r\nbarefooted.\r\n\r\nShe did her errand and returned with an untroubled conscience. How\r\nbeautiful the world was--how softly blue was the great, round Blair\r\nWater--how glorious that miracle of buttercups in the wet field below\r\nLofty John’s bush! At sight of it Emily stood stock still and composed\r\na verse of poetry.\r\n\r\n    “Buttercup, flower of the yellow dye,\r\n      I see thy cheerful face\r\n    Greeting and nodding everywhere\r\n      Careless of time and place.\r\n\r\n    “In boggy field or public road\r\n      Or cultured garden’s pale\r\n    You sport your petals satin-soft,\r\n      And down within the vale.”\r\n\r\nSo far, so good. But Emily wanted another verse to round the poem off\r\nproperly and the divine afflatus seemed gone. She walked dreamily home,\r\nand by the time she reached New Moon she had got her verse and was\r\nreciting it to herself with an agreeable sense of completion.\r\n\r\n    “You cast your loveliness around\r\n      Where’er you chance to be,\r\n    And you shall always, buttercup,\r\n      Be a flower dear to me.”\r\n\r\nEmily felt very proud. This was her third poem and undoubtedly her\r\nbest. Nobody could say _it_ was very blank. She must hurry up to\r\nthe garret and write it on a letter-bill. But Aunt Elizabeth was\r\nconfronting her on the steps.\r\n\r\n“Emily, where are your boots and stockings?”\r\n\r\nEmily came back from cloudland with a disagreeable jolt. She had\r\nforgotten all about boots and stockings.\r\n\r\n“In the hole by the gate,” she said flatly.\r\n\r\n“You went to the store barefooted?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“After I had told you not to?”\r\n\r\nThis seemed to Emily a superfluous question and she did not answer it.\r\nBut Aunt Elizabeth’s turn had come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nILSE\r\n\r\n\r\nEmily was locked in the spare-room and told that she must stay there\r\nuntil bedtime. She had pleaded against such a punishment in vain. She\r\nhad tried to give the Murray look but it seemed that--in her case at\r\nany rate--it did not come at will.\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t shut me up alone there, Aunt Elizabeth,” she implored. “I\r\nknow I was naughty--but don’t put me in the spare-room.”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth was inexorable. She knew that it was a cruel thing to\r\nshut an over-sensitive child like Emily in that gloomy room. But she\r\nthought she was doing her duty. She did not realize and would not have\r\nfor a moment believed that she was really wreaking her own smothered\r\nresentment with Emily for her defeat and fright on the day of the\r\nthreatened hair-cutting. Aunt Elizabeth believed she had been stampeded\r\non that occasion by a chance family resemblance coming out under\r\nstress, and she was ashamed of it. The Murray pride had smarted under\r\nthat humbling, and the smart ceased to annoy her only when she turned\r\nthe key of the spare-room on the white-faced culprit.\r\n\r\nEmily, looking very small and lost and lonely, her eyes full of such\r\nfear as should have no place in a child’s eyes, shrank close against\r\nthe door of the spare-room. It was better that way. She could not\r\nimagine things behind her then. And the room was so big and dim that\r\na dreadful number of things could be imagined in it. Its bigness\r\nand dimness filled her with a terror against which she could not\r\nstrive. Ever since she could remember she had had a horror of being\r\nshut up alone in semi-darkness. She was not frightened of twilight\r\nout-of-doors, but this shadowy, walled gloom made of the spare-room a\r\nplace of dread.\r\n\r\nThe window was hung with heavy, dark-green material, reinforced by\r\ndrawn slat-blinds. The big canopied bed, jutting out from the wall\r\ninto the middle of the floor, was high and rigid and curtained also\r\nwith dark draperies. _Anything_ might jump at her out of such a bed.\r\nWhat if some great black hand should suddenly reach out of it--reach\r\nright across the floor--and pluck at her? The walls, like those of the\r\nparlour, were adorned with pictures of departed relatives. There _was_\r\nsuch a large connection of dead Murrays. The glasses of their frames\r\ngave out weird reflections of the spectral threads of light struggling\r\nthrough the slat blinds. Worst of all, right across the room from her,\r\nhigh up on the top of the black wardrobe, was a huge, stuffed white\r\nArctic owl, staring at her with uncanny eyes. Emily shrieked aloud\r\nwhen she saw it, and then cowered down in her corner aghast at the\r\nsound she had made in the great, silent, echoing room. She wished that\r\nsomething _would_ jump out of the bed and put an end to her.\r\n\r\n“I wonder what Aunt Elizabeth would feel like if I was found here\r\n_dead_,” she thought, vindictively.\r\n\r\nIn spite of her fright she began to dramatize it and felt Aunt\r\nElizabeth’s remorse so keenly that she decided only to be unconscious\r\nand come back to life when everybody was sufficiently scared and\r\npenitent. But people _had_ died in this room--dozens of them. According\r\nto Cousin Jimmy it was a New Moon tradition that when any member of the\r\nfamily was near death he or she was promptly removed to the spare-room,\r\nto die amid surroundings of proper grandeur. Emily could _see_ them\r\ndying, in that terrible bed. She felt that she was going to scream\r\nagain, but she fought the impulse down. A Starr must not be a coward.\r\nOh, that owl! Suppose, when she looked away from it and then looked\r\nback she would find that it had silently hopped down from the wardrobe\r\nand was coming towards her. Emily dared not look at it for fear that\r\nwas just what had happened. _Didn’t_ the bed curtains stir and waver!\r\nShe felt beads of cold perspiration on her forehead.\r\n\r\nThen something did happen. A beam of sunlight struck through a small\r\nbreak in one of the slats of the blind and fell directly athwart the\r\npicture of Grandfather Murray hanging over the mantel-piece. It was a\r\ncrayon “enlargement” copied from the old daguerreotype in the parlour\r\nbelow. In that gleam of light his face seemed veritably to leap out of\r\nthe gloom at Emily with its grim frown strangely exaggerated. Emily’s\r\nnerve gave way completely. In an ungovernable spasm of panic she rushed\r\nmadly across the room to the window, dashed the curtains aside, and\r\ncaught up the slat blind. A blessed flood of sunshine burst in. Outside\r\nwas a wholesome, friendly, human world. And, of all wonders, there,\r\nleaning right against the window-sill was a ladder! For a moment Emily\r\nalmost believed that a miracle had been worked for her escape.\r\n\r\nCousin Jimmy had tripped that morning over the ladder, lying lost among\r\nthe burdocks under the balm-of-gileads behind the dairy. It was very\r\nrotten and he decided it was time it was disposed of. He had shouldered\r\nit up against the house so that he would be sure to see it on his\r\nreturn from the hayfield.\r\n\r\nIn less time than it takes to write of it Emily had got the window up,\r\nclimbed out on the sill, and backed down the ladder. She was too intent\r\non escaping from that horrible room to be conscious of the shakiness of\r\nthe rotten rungs. When she reached the ground she bolted through the\r\nbalm-of-gileads and over the fence into Lofty John’s bush, nor did she\r\nstop running till she reached the path by the brook.\r\n\r\nThen she paused for breath, exultant. She was full of a fearful joy\r\nwith an elfin delight running through it. Sweet was the wind of freedom\r\nthat was blowing over the ferns. She had escaped from the spare-room\r\nand its ghosts--she had got the better of mean old Aunt Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n“I feel as if I was a little bird that had just got out of a cage,” she\r\ntold herself; and then she danced with joy of it all along her fairy\r\npath to the very end, where she found Ilse Burnley huddled up on the\r\ntop of a fence panel, her pale-gold head making a spot of brilliance\r\nagainst the dark young firs that crowded around her. Emily had not seen\r\nher since that first day of school and again she thought she had never\r\nseen or pretended anybody just like Ilse.\r\n\r\n“Well, Emily of New Moon,” said Ilse, “where are you running to?”\r\n\r\n“I’m running away,” said Emily frankly. “I was bad--at least, I was a\r\nlittle bad--and Aunt Elizabeth locked me in the spare-room. I hadn’t\r\nbeen bad enough for _that_--it wasn’t fair--so I got out of the window\r\nand down the ladder.”\r\n\r\n“You little cuss! I didn’t think you’d gimp enough for that,” said Ilse.\r\n\r\nEmily gasped. It seemed very dreadful to be called a little cuss. But\r\nIlse had said it quite admiringly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think it was gimp,” said Emily, too honest to take a\r\ncompliment she didn’t deserve. “I was too scared to stay in that room.”\r\n\r\n“Well, where are you going now?” asked Ilse. “You’ll have to go\r\nsomewhere--you can’t stay outdoors. There’s a thunderstorm coming up.”\r\n\r\nSo there was. Emily did not like thunderstorms. And her conscience\r\nsmote her.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she said, “do you suppose God is bringing up that storm to punish\r\nme because I’ve run away?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Ilse scornfully. “If there is any God he wouldn’t make such\r\na fuss over nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Ilse, don’t you believe there is a God?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. Father says there isn’t. But in that case how did things\r\nhappen? Some days I believe there’s a God and some days I don’t. You’d\r\nbetter come home with me. There’s nobody there. I was so dod-gastedly\r\nlonesome I took to the bush.”\r\n\r\nIlse sprang down and held out her sunburned paw to Emily. Emily\r\ntook it and they ran together over Lofty John’s pasture to the old\r\nBurnley house which looked like a huge grey cat basking in the warm\r\nlate sunshine, that had not yet been swallowed up by the menacing\r\nthunderheads. Inside, it was full of furniture that must have been\r\nquite splendid once; but the disorder was dreadful and the dust lay\r\nthickly over everything. Nothing was in the right place apparently, and\r\nAunt Laura would certainly have fainted with horror if she had seen\r\nthe kitchen. But it was a good place to play. You didn’t have to be\r\ncareful not to mess things up. Ilse and Emily had a glorious game of\r\nhide and seek all over the house until the thunder got so heavy and\r\nthe lightning so bright that Emily felt she must huddle on the sofa and\r\nnurse her courage.\r\n\r\n“Aren’t you ever afraid of thunder?” she asked Ilse.\r\n\r\n“No, I ain’t afraid of anything except the devil,” said Ilse.\r\n\r\n“I thought you didn’t believe in the devil either--Rhoda said you\r\ndidn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, there’s a devil all right, Father says. It’s only God he doesn’t\r\nbelieve in. And if there _is_ a devil and no God to keep him in order,\r\nis it any wonder I’m scared of him? Look here, Emily Byrd Starr, I\r\nlike you--heaps. I’ve always liked you. I knew you’d soon be good and\r\nsick of that little, white-livered, lying sneak of a Rhoda Stuart. _I_\r\nnever tell lies. Father told me once he’d kill me if he ever caught me\r\ntelling a lie. I want you for _my_ chum. I’d go to school regular if I\r\ncould sit with you.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Emily off-handedly. No more sentimental Rhodian vows\r\nof eternal devotion for her. _That_ phase was over.\r\n\r\n“And you’ll tell me things--nobody ever tells me things. And let _me_\r\ntell _you_ things--I haven’t anybody to tell things to,” said Ilse.\r\n“And you won’t be ashamed of me because my clothes are always queer and\r\nbecause I don’t believe in God?”\r\n\r\n“No. But if you knew Father’s God you’d believe in _Him_.”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t. Besides, there’s only one God if there is any at all.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said Emily perplexedly. “No, it can’t be like that.\r\nEllen Greene’s God isn’t a bit like Father’s, and neither is Aunt\r\nElizabeth’s. I don’t think I’d _like_ Aunt Elizabeth’s, but He is a\r\n_dignified_ God at least, and Ellen’s isn’t. And I’m sure Aunt Laura’s\r\nis another one still--nice and kind but not wonderful like Father’s.”\r\n\r\n“Well never mind--I don’t like talking about God,” said Ilse\r\nuncomfortably.\r\n\r\n“_I_ do,” said Emily. “I think God is a very interesting subject, and\r\nI’m going to pray for you, Ilse, that you can believe in Father’s God.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you dast!” shouted Ilse, who for some mysterious reason did not\r\nlike the idea. “I won’t be prayed for!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you ever pray yourself, Ilse?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, now and then--when I feel lonesome at night--or when I’m in a\r\nscrape. But I don’t want any one else to pray for me. If I catch you\r\ndoing it, Emily Starr, I’ll tear your eyes out. And don’t you go\r\nsneaking and praying for me behind my back either.”\r\n\r\n“All right, I won’t,” said Emily sharply, mortified at the failure of\r\nher well-meant offer. “I’ll pray for every single soul I know, but I’ll\r\nleave you out.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Ilse looked as if she didn’t like this either. Then she\r\nlaughed and gave Emily a volcanic hug.\r\n\r\n“Well, anyway, please like me. Nobody likes me, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Your father _must_ like you, Ilse.”\r\n\r\n“He doesn’t,” said Ilse positively. “Father doesn’t care a hoot about\r\nme. I think there’s times when he hates the sight of me. I wish he\r\n_did_ like me because he can be awful nice when he likes any one.\r\nDo you know what I’m going to be when I grow up? I’m going to be an\r\nelo-cu-tion-ist.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?”\r\n\r\n“A woman who recites at concerts. I can do it dandy. What are you going\r\nto be?”\r\n\r\n“A poetess.”\r\n\r\n“Golly!” said Ilse, apparently overcome. “I don’t believe _you_ can\r\nwrite poetry,” she added.\r\n\r\n“I can so, too,” cried Emily. “I’ve written three pieces--‘Autumn’\r\nand ‘Lines to Rhoda’--only I burned _that_--and ‘An Address to a\r\nButtercup.’ I composed it to-day and it is my--my masterpiece.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s hear it,” ordered Ilse.\r\n\r\nNothing loth, Emily proudly repeated her lines. Somehow she did not\r\nmind letting Ilse hear them.\r\n\r\n“Emily Byrd Starr, you _didn’t_ make that out of your own head?”\r\n\r\n“I did.”\r\n\r\n“Cross your heart?”\r\n\r\n“Cross my heart.”\r\n\r\n“Well”--Ilse drew a long breath--“I guess you _are_ a poetess all\r\nright.”\r\n\r\nIt was a very proud moment for Emily--one of the great moments of life,\r\nin fact. Her world had conceded her standing. But now other things\r\nhad to be thought of. The storm was over and the sun had set. It was\r\ntwilight--it would soon be dark. She must get home and back into the\r\nspare-room before her absence was discovered. It was dreadful to think\r\nof going back but she must do it lest a worse thing come upon her at\r\nAunt Elizabeth’s hands. Just now, under the inspiration of Ilse’s\r\npersonality, she was full of Dutch courage. Besides, it would soon be\r\nher bedtime and she would be let out. She trotted home through Lofty\r\nJohn’s bush, that was full of the wandering, mysterious lamps of the\r\nfireflies, dodged cautiously through the balm-of-gileads--and stopped\r\nshort in dismay. The ladder was gone!\r\n\r\nEmily went around to the kitchen door, feeling that she was going\r\nstraight to her doom. But for once the way of the transgressor was made\r\nsinfully easy. Aunt Laura was alone in the kitchen.\r\n\r\n“Emily dear, where on earth did you come from?” she exclaimed. “I was\r\njust going up to let you out. Elizabeth said I might--she’s gone to\r\nprayer-meeting.”\r\n\r\nAunt Laura did not say that she had tiptoed several times to the\r\nspare-room door and had been racked with anxiety over the silence\r\nbehind it. Was the child unconscious from fright? Not even while the\r\nthunderstorm was going on would relentless Elizabeth allow that door\r\nto be opened. And here was Miss Emily walking unconcernedly in out\r\nof the twilight after all this agony. For a moment even Aunt Laura\r\nwas annoyed. But when she heard Emily’s tale her only feeling was\r\nthankfulness that Juliet’s child had not broken her neck on that rotten\r\nladder.\r\n\r\nEmily felt that she had got off better than she deserved. She knew Aunt\r\nLaura would keep the secret; and Aunt Laura let her give Saucy Sal a\r\nwhole cupful of strippings, and gave her a big plummy cooky and put her\r\nto bed with kisses.\r\n\r\n“You oughtn’t to be so good to me because I _was_ bad to-day,” Emily\r\nsaid, between delicious mouthfuls. “I suppose I disgraced the Murrays\r\ngoing barefoot.”\r\n\r\n“If I were you I’d hide my boots every time I went out of the gate,”\r\nsaid Aunt Laura. “But I wouldn’t forget to put them on before I came\r\nback. What Elizabeth doesn’t know will never hurt her.”\r\n\r\nEmily reflected over this until she had finished her cooky. Then she\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n“That would be nice, but I don’t mean to do it any more. I guess I must\r\nobey Aunt Elizabeth because she’s the head of the family.”\r\n\r\n“Where do you get such notions?” said Aunt Laura.\r\n\r\n“Out of my head. Aunt Laura, Ilse Burnley and I are going to be chums.\r\nI like her--I’ve always felt I’d like her if I had a chance. I don’t\r\nbelieve I can ever _love_ any girl again, but I _like_ her.”\r\n\r\n“Poor Ilse!” said Aunt Laura, sighing.\r\n\r\n“Yes, her father doesn’t like her. Isn’t it dreadful?” said Emily. “Why\r\ndoesn’t he?”\r\n\r\n“He does--really. He only thinks he doesn’t.”\r\n\r\n“But _why_ does he think it?”\r\n\r\n“You are too young to understand, Emily.”\r\n\r\nEmily hated to be told she was too young to understand. She felt that\r\nshe could understand perfectly well if only people would take the\r\ntrouble to explain things to her and not be so mysterious.\r\n\r\n“I wish I could pray for her. It wouldn’t be fair, though, when I know\r\nhow she feels about it. But I’ve always asked God to bless all my\r\nfriends so she’ll be in _that_ and maybe some good will come of it. Is\r\n‘golly’ a proper word to say, Aunt Laura?”\r\n\r\n“No--no!”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry for that,” said Emily, seriously, “because it’s very\r\nstriking.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE TANSY PATCH\r\n\r\n\r\nEmily and Ilse had a splendid fortnight of fun before their first\r\nfight. It was really quite a terrible fight, arising out of a simple\r\nargument as to whether they would or would not have a parlour in the\r\nplayhouse they were building in Lofty John’s bush. Emily wanted a\r\nparlour and Ilse didn’t. Ilse lost her temper at once, and went into\r\na true Burnley tantrum. She was very fluent in her rages and the\r\nvolley of abusive “dictionary words” which she hurled at Emily would\r\nhave staggered most of the Blair Water girls. But Emily was too much\r\nat home with words to be floored so easily; she grew angry too, but\r\nin the cool, dignified, Murray way which was more exasperating than\r\nviolence. When Ilse had to pause for breath in her diatribes, Emily,\r\nsitting on a big stone with her knees crossed, her eyes black and her\r\ncheeks crimson, interjected little sarcastic retorts that infuriated\r\nIlse still further. Ilse was crimson, too, and her eyes were pools of\r\nscintillating, tawny fire. They were both so pretty in their fury that\r\nit was almost a pity they couldn’t have been angry all the time.\r\n\r\n“You needn’t suppose, you little puling, snivelling chit, that you are\r\ngoing to boss _me_, just because you live at New Moon,” shrieked Ilse,\r\nas an ultimatum, stamping her foot.\r\n\r\n“I’m not going to boss you--I’m not going to associate with you ever\r\nagain,” retorted Emily, disdainfully.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad to be rid of you--you proud, stuck-up, conceited, top-lofty\r\n_biped_,” cried Ilse. “Never you speak to me again. And don’t you go\r\nabout Blair Water saying things about me, either.”\r\n\r\nThis was unbearable to a girl who _never_ “said things” about her\r\nfriends or once-friends.\r\n\r\n“I’m not going to _say_ things about you,” said Emily deliberately. “I\r\nam just going to _think_ them.”\r\n\r\nThis was far more aggravating than speech and Emily knew it. Ilse was\r\ndriven quite frantic by it. Who knew what unearthly things Emily might\r\nbe thinking about her any time she took the notion to? Ilse had already\r\ndiscovered what a fertile invention Emily had.\r\n\r\n“Do you suppose I care what you think, you insignificant serpent? Why,\r\nyou haven’t _any_ sense.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got something then that’s far better,” said Emily, with a\r\nmaddening superior smile. “Something that _you_ can _never_ have, Ilse\r\nBurnley.”\r\n\r\nIlse doubled her fists as if she would like to demolish Emily by\r\nphysical force.\r\n\r\n“If I couldn’t write better poetry than you, I’d hang myself,” she\r\nderided.\r\n\r\n“I’ll lend you a dime to buy a rope,” said Emily.\r\n\r\nIlse glared at her, vanquished.\r\n\r\n“You go to the devil!” she said.\r\n\r\nEmily got up and went, not to the devil, but back to New Moon. Ilse\r\nrelieved _her_ feelings by knocking the boards of their china closet\r\ndown, and kicking their “moss gardens” to pieces, and departed also.\r\n\r\nEmily felt exceedingly badly. Here was another friendship destroyed--a\r\nfriendship, too, that had been very delightful and satisfying. Ilse\r\n_had_ been a splendid chum--there was no doubt about that. After Emily\r\nhad cooled down she went to the dormer window and cried.\r\n\r\n“Wretched, wretched me!” she sobbed, dramatically, but very sincerely.\r\n\r\nYet the bitterness of her break with Rhoda was not present. _This_\r\nquarrel was fair and open and above-board. She had not been stabbed in\r\nthe back. But of course she and Ilse would never be chums again. You\r\ncouldn’t be chums with a person who called you a chit and a biped, and\r\na serpent, and told you to go to the devil. The thing was impossible.\r\nAnd besides, Ilse could _never_ forgive _her_--for Emily was honest\r\nenough to admit to herself that she had been very aggravating, too.\r\n\r\nYet, when Emily went to the playhouse next morning, bent on retrieving\r\nher share of broken dishes and boards, there was Ilse, skipping around,\r\nhard at work, with all the shelves back in place, the moss garden\r\nre-made, and a beautiful parlour laid out and connected with the\r\nliving-room by a spruce arch.\r\n\r\n“Hello, you. Here’s your parlour and I hope you’ll be satisfied now,”\r\nshe said gaily. “What’s kept you so long? I thought you were never\r\ncoming.”\r\n\r\nThis rather posed Emily after her tragic night, wherein she had buried\r\nher second friendship and wept over its grave. She was not prepared for\r\nso speedy a resurrection. As far as Ilse was concerned it seemed as if\r\nno quarrel had ever taken place.\r\n\r\n“Why, that was _yesterday_,” she said in amazement, when Emily, rather\r\ndistantly, referred to it. Yesterday and to-day were two entirely\r\ndifferent things in Ilse’s philosophy. Emily accepted it--she found she\r\nhad to. Ilse, it transpired, could no more help flying into tantrums\r\nnow and then than she could help being jolly and affectionate between\r\nthem. What amazed Emily, in whom things were bound to rankle for a\r\ntime, was the way in which Ilse appeared to forget a quarrel the\r\nmoment it was over. To be called a serpent and a crocodile one minute\r\nand hugged and darling-ed the next was somewhat disconcerting until\r\ntime and experience took the edge off it.\r\n\r\n“Aren’t I nice enough between times to make up for it?” demanded Ilse.\r\n“Dot Payne never flies into tempers, but would you like _her_ for a\r\nchum?”\r\n\r\n“No, she’s too stupid,” admitted Emily.\r\n\r\n“And Rhoda Stuart is never out of temper, but you got enough of _her_.\r\nDo you think I’d ever treat you as she did?”\r\n\r\nNo, Emily had no doubt on this point. Whatever Ilse was or was not, she\r\nwas loyal and true.\r\n\r\nAnd certainly Rhoda Stuart and Dot Payne compared to Ilse were “as\r\nmoonlight unto sunlight and as water unto wine”--or would have been if\r\nEmily had as yet known anything more of her Tennyson than the _Bugle\r\nSong_.\r\n\r\n“You can’t have everything,” said Ilse. “I’ve got Dad’s temper and\r\nthat’s all there is to it. Wait till you see _him_ in one of his rages.”\r\n\r\nEmily had not seen this so far. She had often been down in the\r\nBurnley’s house but on the few occasions when Dr. Burnley had been\r\nhome he had ignored her save for a curt nod. He was a busy man, for,\r\nwhatever his shortcomings were, his skill was unquestioned and the\r\nbounds of his practice extended far. By the sickbed he was as gentle\r\nand sympathetic as he was brusque and sarcastic away from it. As long\r\nas you were ill there was nothing Dr. Burnley would not do for you;\r\nonce you were well he had apparently no further use for you. He had\r\nbeen absorbed all through July trying to save Teddy Kent’s life up at\r\nthe Tansy Patch. Teddy was out of danger now and able to be up, but\r\nhis improvement was not speedy enough to satisfy Dr. Burnley. One day\r\nhe held up Emily and Ilse, who were heading through the lawn to the\r\npond, with fishing-hooks and a can of fat, abominable worms--the latter\r\nmanipulated solely by Ilse--and ordered them to betake themselves up to\r\nthe Tansy Patch and play with Teddy Kent.\r\n\r\n“He’s lonesome and moping. Go and cheer him up,” said the doctor.\r\n\r\nIlse was rather loth to go. She liked Teddy, but it seemed she did not\r\nlike his mother. Emily was secretly not averse. She had seen Teddy Kent\r\nbut once, at Sunday School the day before he was taken seriously ill,\r\nand she had liked his looks. It had seemed that he liked hers, too, for\r\nshe caught him staring shyly at her over the intervening pews several\r\ntimes. He was very handsome, Emily decided. She liked his thick,\r\ndark-brown hair and his black-browed blue eyes, and for the first time\r\nit occurred to her that it might be rather nice to have a boy playmate,\r\ntoo. Not a “beau” of course. Emily hated the school jargon that called\r\na boy your “beau” if he happened to give you a pencil or an apple and\r\npicked you out frequently for his partner in the games.\r\n\r\n“Teddy’s nice but his mother is queer,” Ilse told her on their way to\r\nthe Tansy Patch. “She never goes out anywhere--not even to church--but\r\nI guess it’s because of the scar on her face. They’re not Blair Water\r\npeople--they’ve only been living at the Tansy Patch since last fall.\r\nThey’re poor and proud and not many people visit them. But Teddy is\r\nawfully nice, so if his mother gives us some black looks we needn’t\r\nmind.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Kent gave them no black looks, though her reception was rather\r\ndistant. Perhaps she, too, had received some orders from the doctor.\r\nShe was a tiny creature, with enormous masses of dull, soft, silky,\r\nfawn hair, dark, mournful eyes, and a broad scar running slantwise\r\nacross her pale face. Without the scar she must have been pretty, and\r\nshe had a voice as soft and uncertain as the wind in the tansy. Emily,\r\nwith her instinctive faculty of sizing up people she met, felt that\r\nMrs. Kent was not a happy woman.\r\n\r\nThe Tansy Patch was east of the Disappointed House, between the Blair\r\nWater and the sand-dunes. Most people considered it a bare, lonely,\r\nneglected place, but Emily thought it was fascinating. The little\r\nclap-boarded house topped a small hill, over which tansy grew in a\r\nhard, flaunting, aromatic luxuriance, rising steeply and abruptly\r\nfrom a main road. A straggling rail fence, almost smothered in wild\r\nrosebushes, bounded the domain, and a sagging, ill-used little gate\r\ngave ingress from the road. Stones were let into the side of the hill\r\nfor steps up to the front door. Behind the house was a tumble-down\r\nlittle barn, and a field of flowering buckwheat, creamy green, sloping\r\ndown to the Blair Water. In front was a crazy veranda around which a\r\nbrilliant band of red poppies held up their enchanted cups.\r\n\r\nTeddy was unfeignedly glad to see them, and they had a happy afternoon\r\ntogether. There was some colour in Teddy’s clear olive skin when it\r\nended and his dark-blue eyes were brighter. Mrs. Kent took in these\r\nsigns greedily and asked the girls to come back, with an eagerness that\r\nwas yet not cordiality. But they had found the Tansy Patch a charming\r\nplace and were glad to go again. For the rest of the vacation there was\r\nhardly a day when they did not go up to it--preferably in the long,\r\nsmoky, delicious August evenings when the white moths sailed over the\r\ntansy plantation and the golden twilight faded into dusk and purple\r\nover the green slopes beyond and fireflies lighted their goblin torches\r\nby the pond. Sometimes they played games in the tansy patch, when Teddy\r\nand Emily somehow generally found themselves on the same side and then\r\nno more than a match for agile, quick-witted Ilse; sometimes Teddy\r\ntook them to the barn loft and showed them his little collection of\r\ndrawings. Both girls thought them very wonderful without knowing in\r\nthe least how wonderful they really were. It seemed like magic to see\r\nTeddy take a pencil and bit of paper and with a few quick strokes of\r\nhis slim brown fingers bring out a sketch of Ilse or Emily or Smoke or\r\nButtercup, that looked ready to speak--or meow.\r\n\r\nSmoke and Buttercup were the Tansy Patch cats. Buttercup was a chubby,\r\nyellow, delightful creature hardly out of kittenhood. Smoke was a big\r\nMaltese and an aristocrat from the tip of his nose to the tip of his\r\ntail. There was no doubt whatever that he belonged to the cat caste of\r\nVere de Vere. He had emerald eyes and a coat of plush. The only white\r\nthing about him was an adorable dicky.\r\n\r\nEmily thought of all the pleasant hours spent at the Tansy Patch the\r\npleasantest were those, when, tired with play, they all three sat\r\non the crazy veranda steps in the mystery and enchantment of the\r\nborderland ’tween light and dark when the little clump of spruce behind\r\nthe barn looked like beautiful, dark, phantom trees. The clouds of the\r\nwest faded into grey and a great round yellow moon rose over the fields\r\nto be reflected brokenly in the pond, where the Wind Woman was making\r\nwonderful, woven lights and shadows.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kent never joined them, though Emily had a creepy conviction\r\nthat she was watching them stealthily from behind the kitchen blind.\r\nTeddy and Ilse sang school ditties, and Ilse recited, and Emily told\r\nstories; or they sat in happy silence, each anchored in some secret\r\nport of dreams, while the cats chased each other madly over the hill\r\nand through the tansy, tearing round and round the house like possessed\r\ncreatures. They would spring up at the children with sudden pounces and\r\nspring as suddenly away. Their eyes gleamed like jewels, their tails\r\nswayed like plumes. They were palpitating with nervous, stealthy life.\r\n\r\n“Oh, isn’t it good to be alive--like this?” Emily said once. “Wouldn’t\r\nit be dreadful if one had never lived?”\r\n\r\nStill, existence was not wholly unclouded--Aunt Elizabeth took care of\r\nthat. Aunt Elizabeth only permitted the visits to the Tansy Patch under\r\nprotest, and because Dr. Burnley had ordered them.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Elizabeth does not aprove of Teddy,” Emily wrote in one of her\r\nletters to her father--which epistles were steadily mutiplying on the\r\nold garret sofa shelf. “The first time I asked her if I might go and\r\nplay with Teddy she looked at me _severely_ and said, Who is this Teddy\r\nperson. We do not know anything about these Kents. Remember, Emily,\r\nthe Murrays do not assosiate with every one. I said I am a Starr--I am\r\nnot a Murray, you said so yourself. Dear Father I did not mean to be\r\nimpertnent but Aunt Elizabeth said I was and would not speak to me the\r\nrest of the day. She seemed to think that was a very bad punishment\r\nbut I did not mind it much only it is rather unpleasant to have your\r\nown family preserve a disdaneful silence towards you. But since then\r\nshe lets me go to the Tansy Patch because Dr. Burnley came and told\r\nher to. Dr. Burnley has a _strange inflewence_ over Aunt Elizabeth. I\r\ndo not understand it. Rhoda said once that Aunt Elizabeth hoped Dr.\r\nBurnley and Aunt Laura would make a match of it--which, you know means\r\nget married--but that is not so. Mrs. Thomas Anderson was here one\r\nafternoon to tea. (Mrs. Thomas Anderson is a big fat woman and her\r\ngrandmother was a Murray and there is nothing else to say about _her_.)\r\nShe asked Aunt Elizabeth if she thought Dr. Burnley would marry again\r\nand Aunt Elizabeth said no, he would not and she did not think it right\r\nfor people to marry a second time. Mrs. Anderson said Sometimes I have\r\nthought he would take Laura. Aunt Elizabeth just swept her a hawty\r\nglance. There is no use in denying it, there are times when I am very\r\nproud of Aunt Elizabeth, even if I do not like her.\r\n\r\n“Teddy is a very nice boy, Father. I think you would aprove of him.\r\nShould there be two p’s in aprove? He can make splendid pictures\r\nand he is going to be a famus artist some day, and then he is going\r\nto paint my portrate. He keeps his pictures in the barn loft because\r\nhis mother doesn’t like to see them. He can whistle just like a bird.\r\nThe Tansy Patch is a _very quante_ place--espesially at night. I love\r\nthe twilight there. We always have such fun in the twilight. The Wind\r\nWoman makes herself small in the tansy just like a tiny, tiny fairy and\r\nthe cats are so queer and creepy and delightful then. They belong to\r\nMrs. Kent and Teddy is afraid to pet them much for fear she will drown\r\nthem. She drowned a kitten once because she thought he liked it better\r\nthan her. But he didn’t because Teddy is _very much attatched_ to his\r\nmother. He washes the dishes for her and helps her in all the house\r\nwork. Ilse says the boys in school call him sissy for that but I think\r\nit is noble and manley of him. Teddy wishes she would let him have a\r\ndog but she wont. I have thought Aunt Elizabeth was tirannical but\r\nMrs. Kent is far worse in some ways. But then she loves Teddy and Aunt\r\nElizabeth does not love me.\r\n\r\n“But Mrs. Kent doesn’t like Ilse or me. She never says so but we _feel_\r\nit. She never asks us to stay to tea--and we’ve always been so polite\r\nto her. I believe she is jellus of us because Teddy likes us. Teddy\r\ngave me the sweetest picture of the Blair Water he had painted on a big\r\nwhite cowhawk shell but he said I mustn’t let his mother know about it\r\nbecause she would cry. Mrs. Kent is a very misterious person, very like\r\nsome people you read of in books. I like misterious people but not too\r\nclose. Her eyes always look hungry though she has plenty to eat. She\r\nnever goes anywhere because she has a scar on her face where she was\r\nburned with a lamp exploding. It made my blood run cold, dear Father.\r\nHow thankful I am that Aunt Elizabeth only burns candles. Some of the\r\nMurray tradishuns are very sensible. Mrs. Kent is very relijus--what\r\nshe calls relijus. She prays even in the middle of the day. Teddy says\r\nthat before he was born into this world he lived in another one where\r\nthere were two suns, one red and one blue. The days were red and the\r\nnights blue. I don’t know where he got the idea but it sounds atractive\r\nto me. And he says the brooks run honey instead of water. But what did\r\nyou do when you were thirsty, I said. Oh, we were never thirsty there.\r\nBut I think I would _like_ to be thirsty because then cold water tastes\r\nso good. _I_ would like to live in the moon. It must be such a nice\r\nsilvery place.\r\n\r\n“Ilse says Teddy ought to like her best because there is more fun in\r\nher than in me but that is not true. There is just as much fun in me\r\nwhen my conshence doesn’t bother me. I guess Ilse wants Teddy to like\r\nher best but she is not a jellus girl.\r\n\r\n“I am glad to say that Aunt Elizabeth and Aunt Laura both aprove of my\r\nfriendship with Ilse. It is so seldom they aprove of the same thing.\r\nI am getting used to fighting with Ilse now and don’t mind it much.\r\nBesides I can fight pretty well myself when my blood is up. We fight\r\nabout once a week but we make up right away and Ilse says things would\r\nbe dull if there was never a row. I would like it better without rows\r\nbut you can never tell what will make Ilse mad. She never gets mad\r\ntwice over the same thing. She calls me dreadful names. Yesterday she\r\ncalled me a lousy lizard and a toothless viper. But somehow I didn’t\r\nmind it much because I knew I wasn’t lousy or toothless and she knew\r\nit too. I don’t call names because that is unladylike but I smile and\r\nthat makes Ilse far madder than if I skowled and stamped as she does,\r\nand that is why I do it. Aunt Laura says I must be careful not to pick\r\nup the words Ilse uses and try to set her a good example because the\r\npoor child has no one to look after her propperly. I wish I could use\r\nsome of her words because they are so striking. She gets them from her\r\nfather. I think my aunts are too perticular. One night when the Rev.\r\nMr. Dare was here to tea I used the word bull in my conversashun. I\r\nsaid Ilse and I were afraid to go through Mr. James Lee’s pasture where\r\nthe old well was because he had a cross bull there. After Mr. Dare\r\nhad gone Aunt Elizabeth gave me an awful skolding and told me I was\r\nnever to use _that word_ again. But she had been talking of tigers at\r\ntea--in connexshun with missionaries--and I can’t understand why it is\r\nmore disgraceful to talk about bulls than tigers. Of course bulls are\r\nferoshus animals but so are tigers. But Aunt Elizabeth says I am always\r\ndisgracing them when they have company. When Mrs. Lockwood was here\r\nfrom Shrewsbury last week they were talking about Mrs. Foster Beck, who\r\nis a bride, and I said Dr. Burnley thought she was devilishly pretty.\r\nAunt Elizabeth said EMILY in an awful tone. She was pale with rath.\r\nDr. Burnley said it, I cryed, I am only kwoting. And Dr. Burnley did\r\nsay it the day I stayed to dinner with Ilse and Dr. Jameson was there\r\nfrom Shrewsbury. I saw Dr. Burnley in one of his rages that afternoon\r\nover something Mrs. Simms had done in his office. It was a groosome\r\nsight. His big yellow eyes blazed and he tore about and kicked over a\r\nchair and threw a mat at the wall and fired a vase out of the window\r\nand said _terrible things_. I sat on the sofa and stared at him like\r\none fassinated. It was so interesting I was sorry when he cooled down\r\nwhich he soon did because he is like Ilse and never stays mad long. He\r\nnever gets mad at Ilse though. Ilse says she wishes he would--it would\r\nbe better than being taken no notis of. She is as much of an orfan as\r\nI am, poor child. Last Sunday she went to church with her old faded\r\nblue dress on. There was a tare right in front of it. Aunt Laura wepped\r\nwhen she came home and then spoke to Mrs. Simms about it because she\r\ndid not dare speak to Dr. Burnley. Mrs. Simms was cross and said it\r\nwas not her place to look after Ilses close but she said she had got\r\nDr. Burnley to get Ilse a nice sprigged muslin dress and Ilse had got\r\negg stane on it, and when Mrs. Simms skolded her for being so careless\r\nIlse flew into a rage and went upstairs and tore the muslin dress to\r\npieces, and Mrs. Simms said she wasn’t going to bother her head again\r\nabout a child like that and there was nothing for her to ware but her\r\nold blue but Mrs. Simms didn’t know it was tore. So I sneaked Ilses\r\ndress over to New Moon and Aunt Laura mended it neetly and hid the tare\r\nwith a pocket. Ilse said she tore up her muslin dress one of the days\r\nshe didn’t believe in God and didn’t care what she did. Ilse found\r\na mouse in her bed one night and she just shook it out and jumped\r\nin. Oh, how brave. I could never be as brave as that. It is not true\r\nthat Dr. Burnley never smiles. I have seen him do it but not often.\r\nHe just smiles with his lips but not his eyes and it makes me feel\r\nuncomfortable. Mostly he laughs in a horrid sarkastic way like _Jolly\r\nJim’s_ uncle.\r\n\r\n“We had barley soup for dinner that day--very watery.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Laura is giving me five cents a week for washing the dishes. I\r\ncan only spend one cent of it and the other four have to be put in\r\nthe toad bank in the sitting-room on the mantel. The toad is made of\r\nbrass and sits on top of the bank and you put the cents in his mouth\r\none at a time. He swallows them and they drop into the bank. It’s very\r\nfassinating (I should not write fassinating again because you told me\r\nI must not use the same word too often but I cant think of any other\r\nthat deskribes my feelings so well). The toad bank is Aunt Laura’s but\r\nshe said I could use it. I just hugged her. Of course I never hug Aunt\r\nElizabeth. She is too rijid and bony. She does not aprove of Aunt Laura\r\npaying me for washing dishes. I tremble to think what she would say if\r\nshe knew Cousin Jimmy gave me a whole dollar on the sly last week.\r\n\r\n“I wish he had not given me so much. It worrys me. It is an awful\r\nresponsibility. It will be so diffikult to spend it wisely also\r\nwithout Aunt Elizabeth finding out about it. I hope I shall never\r\nhave a million dollars. I am sure it would crush me utterly. I keep\r\nmy dollar hid on the shelf with my letters and I put it in an old\r\nenvelope and wrote on it Cousin Jimmy Murray gave me this so that if I\r\ndied suddenly and Aunt Elizabeth found it she would know I came by it\r\nhonestly.\r\n\r\n“Now that the days are getting cool Aunt Elizabeth makes me wear my\r\nthick flannel petticoat. I hate it. It makes me so bunchy. But Aunt\r\nElizabeth says I must wear it because you died of consumption. I wish\r\nclose could be both graceful and helthy. I read the story of Red Riding\r\nHood to-day. I think the wolf was the most intresting caracter in it.\r\nRed Riding Hood was a stupid little thing so easily fooled.\r\n\r\n“I wrote two poems yesterday. One was short and entitelled Lines\r\nAdressed to a blue-eyed-grass flower gathered in the Old Orchard. Here\r\nit is.\r\n\r\n    Sweet little flower thy modest face\r\n    Is ever lifted tords the sky\r\n    And a reflexshun of its face\r\n    Is caught within thine own blue eye.\r\n    The meadow queens are tall and fair\r\n    The columbines are lovely too\r\n    But the poor talent I possess\r\n    Shall laurel thee my flower of blue.\r\n\r\n“The other poem was long and I wrote it on a letter-bill. It is called\r\nThe Monark of the Forest. The Monark is the big birch in Lofty John’s\r\nbush. I love that bush so much it hurts. Do you understand that kind\r\nof hurting. Ilse likes it too and we play there most of the time when\r\nwe are not at the Tansy Patch. We have three paths in it. We call them\r\nthe To-day Road, the Yesterday Road and the To-morrow Road. The To-day\r\nRoad is by the brook and we call it that because it is lovely now. The\r\nYesterday Road is out in the stumps where Lofty John cut some trees\r\ndown and we call it that because it used to be lovely. The To-morrow\r\nRoad is just a tiny path in the maple clearing and we call it that\r\nbecause it is going to be lovely some day, when the maples grow bigger.\r\nBut oh Father dear I haven’t forgotten the dear old trees down home.\r\nI always think of them after I go to bed. But I am happy here. It\r\nisn’t wrong to be happy, is it Father. Aunt Elizabeth says I got over\r\nbeing homesick very quick but I am often homesick _inside_. I have got\r\nakwanted with Lofty John. Ilse is a great friend of his and often goes\r\nthere to watch him working in his carpenter shop. He says he has made\r\nenough ladders to get to heaven without the priest but that is just his\r\njoke. He is really a very devowt Catholic and goes to the chapel at\r\nWhite Cross every Sunday. I go with Ilse though perhaps I ought not to\r\nwhen he is an enemy of my family. He is of stately baring and refined\r\nmanners--very sivil to me but I don’t always like him. When I ask him\r\na serius question he always winks over my head when he ansers. That\r\nis insulting. Of course I never ask any questions on relijus subjects\r\nbut Ilse does. She likes him but she says he would burn us all at the\r\nstake if he had the power. She asked him right out if he wouldn’t\r\nand he winked at me and said Oh, we wouldn’t burn nice pretty little\r\nProtestants like you. We would only burn the old ugly ones. That was a\r\nfrivellus reply. Mrs. Lofty John is a nice woman and not at all proud.\r\nShe looks just like a little rosy rinkled apple.\r\n\r\n“On rainy days we play at Ilse’s. We can slide down the bannisters and\r\ndo what we like. Nobody cares only when the doctor is home we have to\r\nbe quiet because he cant bear any noise in the house except what he\r\nmakes himself. The roof is flat and we can get out on it through a door\r\nin the garret ceiling. It is very exiting to be up on the roof of a\r\nhouse. We had a yelling contest there the other night to see which\r\ncould yell the loudest. To my surprise I found I could. You never can\r\ntell what you can do till you try. But too many people heard us and\r\nAunt Elizabeth was very angry. She asked me what made me do such a\r\nthing. That is an okward question because often I cant tell what makes\r\nme do things. Sometimes I do them just to find out what I feel like\r\ndoing them. And sometimes I do them because I want to have some exiting\r\nthings to tell my grandchildren. Is it impropper to talk about haveing\r\ngrandchildren. I have discovered that it is impropper to talk about\r\nhaveing children. One evening when people were here Aunt Laura said to\r\nme quite kindly What are you thinking so ernestly about, Emily, and I\r\nsaid I am picking names for my children. I mean to have ten. And after\r\nthe company had gone Aunt Elizabeth said to Aunt Laura _icilly_ I think\r\nit will be better in the future Laura if you do _not_ ask that child\r\nwhat she is thinking of. If Aunt Laura doesnt I shall be sorry because\r\nwhen I have an intresting thought I like to tell it.\r\n\r\n“School begins again next week. Ilse is going to ask Miss Brownell if\r\nI can sit with her. I intend to act as if Rhoda was not there at all.\r\nTeddy is going too. Dr. Burnley says he is well enough to go though his\r\nmother doesnt like the idea. Teddy says she never likes to have him go\r\nto school but she is glad that he hates Miss Brownell. Aunt Laura says\r\nthe right way to end a letter to a dear friend is yours affeckshunately.\r\n\r\n“So I am yours very affeckshunately.\r\n\r\n                                “_Emily Byrd Starr._\r\n\r\n“P. S. Because _you_ are my _very dearest friend still_, Father. Ilse\r\nsays she loves me best of anything in the world and her red leather\r\nboots that Mrs. Simms gave her next.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nA DAUGHTER OF EVE\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Moon was noted for its apples and on that first autumn of Emily’s\r\nlife there both the “old” and the “new” orchards bore a bumper crop.\r\nIn the new were the titled and pedigreed apples; and in the old the\r\nseedlings, unknown to catalogues, that yet had a flavour wildly sweet\r\nand all their own. There was no taboo on any apple and Emily was free\r\nto eat all she wanted of each and every kind,--the only prohibition\r\nbeing that she must not take any to bed with her. Aunt Elizabeth, very\r\nproperly, did not want her bed messed up with apple seeds; and Aunt\r\nLaura had a horror of any one eating apples in the dark lest they might\r\neat an apple worm into the bargain. Emily, therefore, should have been\r\nable fully to satisfy her appetite for apples at home; but there is\r\na certain odd kink in human nature by reason of which the flavour of\r\nthe apples belonging to somebody else is always vastly superior to our\r\nown--as the crafty serpent of Eden very well knew. Emily, like most\r\npeople, possessed this kink, and consequently thought that nowhere were\r\nthere such delicious apples as those belonging to Lofty John. He was in\r\nthe habit of keeping a long row of apples on one of the beams in his\r\nworkshop and it was understood that she and Ilse might help themselves\r\nfreely whenever they visited that charming, dusty, shaving-carpeted\r\nspot. Three varieties of Lofty John’s apples were their especial\r\nfavourites--the “scabby apples,” that looked as if they had leprosy but\r\nwere of unsurpassed deliciousness under their queerly blotched skins;\r\nthe “little red apples,” scarcely bigger than a crab, deep crimson all\r\nover and glossy as satin, that had such a sweet, nutty flavour; and\r\nthe big green “sweet apples” that children usually thought the best of\r\nall. Emily considered that day wasted whose low descending sun had not\r\nbeheld her munching one of Lofty John’s big green sweets.\r\n\r\nIn the back of her mind Emily knew quite well that she should not be\r\ngoing to Lofty John’s at all. To be sure, she had never been forbidden\r\nto go--simply because it had never occurred to her aunts that an inmate\r\nof New Moon could so forget the beloved old family feud between the\r\nhouses of Murray and Sullivan belonging to two generations back. It was\r\nan inheritance that any proper Murray would live up to as a matter of\r\ncourse. But when Emily was off with that wild little Ishmaelite of an\r\nIlse, traditions lost their power under the allurement of Lofty John’s\r\n“reds” and “scabs.”\r\n\r\nShe wandered rather lonesomely into his workshop one September evening\r\nat twilight. She had been alone since she came from school; her aunts\r\nand Cousin Jimmy had gone to Shrewsbury, promising to be back by\r\nsunset. Ilse was away also, her father, prodded thereto by Mrs. Simms,\r\nhaving taken her to Charlottetown to get her a winter coat. Emily liked\r\nbeing alone very well at first. She felt quite important over being\r\nin charge of New Moon. She ate the supper Aunt Laura had left on the\r\ncook-house dresser for her and she went into the dairy and skimmed\r\nsix lovely big pans of milk. She had no business at all to do this\r\nbut she had always hankered to do it and this was too good a chance\r\nto be missed. She did it beautifully and nobody ever knew--each aunt\r\nsupposing the other had done it--and so she was never scolded for it.\r\nThis does not point any particular moral, of course; in a proper yarn\r\nEmily should either have been found out and punished for disobedience\r\nor been driven by an uneasy conscience to confess; but I am sorry--or\r\nought to be--to have to state that Emily’s conscience never worried\r\nher about the matter at all. Still, she was doomed to suffer enough\r\nthat night from an entirely different cause, to balance all her little\r\npeccadillos.\r\n\r\nBy the time the cream was skimmed and poured into the big stone crock\r\nand well stirred--Emily didn’t forget _that_, either--it was after\r\nsunset and still nobody had come home. Emily didn’t like the idea of\r\ngoing alone into the big, dusky, echoing house; so she hied her to\r\nLofty John’s shop, which she found unoccupied, though the plane halted\r\nmidway on a board indicated that Lofty John had been working there\r\nquite recently and would probably return. Emily sat down on a round\r\nsection of a huge log and looked around to see what she could get to\r\neat. There was a row of “reds” and “scabs” clean across the side of the\r\nshop but no “sweet” among them; and Emily felt that what she needed\r\njust then was a “sweet” and nothing else.\r\n\r\nThen she spied one--a huge one--the biggest “sweet” Emily had ever\r\nseen, all by itself on one of the steps of the stair leading up to the\r\nloft. She climbed up, possessed herself of it and ate it out of hand.\r\nShe was gnawing happily at the core when Lofty John came in. He nodded\r\nto her with a seemingly careless glance around.\r\n\r\n“Just been in to get my supper,” he said. “The wife’s away so I had to\r\nget it myself.”\r\n\r\nHe fell to planing in silence. Emily sat on the stairs, counting\r\nthe seeds of the big “sweet”--you told your fortunes by the\r\nseeds--listening to the Wind Woman whistling elfishly through a\r\nknot hole in the loft, and composing a “Deskripshun of Lofty John’s\r\nCarpenter Shop By Lantern Light,” to be written later on a letter-bill.\r\nShe was lost in a mental hunt for an accurate phrase to picture the\r\nabsurd elongated shadow of Lofty John’s nose on the opposite wall when\r\nLofty John whirled about, so suddenly that the shadow of his nose shot\r\nupward like a huge spear to the ceiling, and demanded in a startled\r\nvoice,\r\n\r\n“What’s become av that big sweet apple that was on that stair?”\r\n\r\n“Why--I--I et it,” stammered Emily.\r\n\r\nLofty John dropped his plane, threw up his hands, and looked at Emily\r\nwith a horrified face.\r\n\r\n“The saints preserve us, child! Ye never et that apple--don’t tell me\r\nye’ve gone and et _that_ apple!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did,” said Emily uncomfortably. “I didn’t think it was any\r\nharm--I--”\r\n\r\n“Harm! Listen to her, will you? That apple was poisoned for the rats!\r\nThey’ve been plaguing me life out here and I had me mind made up to\r\nfinish their fun. And now you’ve et the apple--it would kill a dozen av\r\nye in a brace of shakes.”\r\n\r\nLofty John saw a white face and a gingham apron flash through the\r\nworkshop and out into the dark. Emily’s first wild impulse was to\r\nget home at once--before she dropped dead. She tore across the field\r\nthrough the bush and the garden and dashed into the house. It was still\r\nsilent and dark--nobody was home yet. Emily gave a bitter little shriek\r\nof despair--when they came they would find her stiff and cold, black in\r\nthe face likely, everything in this dear world ended for her forever,\r\nall because she had eaten an apple which she thought she was perfectly\r\nwelcome to eat. It wasn’t fair--she didn’t want to die.\r\n\r\nBut she must. She only hoped desperately that some one would come\r\nbefore she was dead. It would be so terrible to die there all alone in\r\nthat great, big, empty New Moon. She dared not try to go anywhere for\r\nhelp. It was too dark now and she would likely drop dead on the way. To\r\ndie out there--alone--in the dark--oh, that would be too dreadful. It\r\ndid not occur to her that anything could be done for her; she thought\r\nif you once swallowed poison that was the end of you.\r\n\r\nWith hands shaking in panic she got a candle lighted. It wasn’t quite\r\nso bad then--you _could_ face things in the light. And Emily, pale,\r\nterrified, alone, was already deciding that this must be faced bravely.\r\nShe must not shame the Starrs and the Murrays. She clenched her cold\r\nhands and tried to stop trembling. How long would it be before she\r\ndied, she wondered. Lofty John had said the apple would kill her in a\r\n“brace of shakes.” What did that mean? How long was a brace of shakes?\r\nWould it hurt her to die? She had a vague idea that poison did hurt you\r\nawfully. Oh; and just a little while ago she had been so happy! She had\r\nthought she was going to live for years and write great poems and be\r\nfamous like Mrs. Hemans. She had had a fight with Ilse the night before\r\nand hadn’t made it up yet--never could make it up now. And Ilse would\r\nfeel so terribly. She must write her a note and forgive her. Was there\r\ntime for that much? Oh, how cold her hands were! Perhaps that meant\r\nshe was dying already. She had heard or read that your hands turned\r\ncold when you were dying. She wondered if her face was turning black.\r\nShe grasped her candle and hurried up the stairs to the spare-room.\r\nThere was a looking-glass there--the only one in the house hung low\r\nenough for her to see her reflection if she tipped the bottom of it\r\nback. Ordinarily Emily would have been frightened to death at the mere\r\nthought of going into that spare-room by dim, flickering candlelight.\r\nBut the one great terror had swallowed up all lesser ones. She looked\r\nat her reflection, amid the sleek, black flow of her hair, in the\r\nupward-striking light on the dark background of the shadowy room. Oh,\r\nshe was pale as the dead already. Yes, that was a dying face--there\r\ncould be no doubt of it.\r\n\r\nSomething rose up in Emily and took possession of her--some inheritance\r\nfrom the good old stock behind her. She ceased to tremble--she accepted\r\nher fate--with bitter regret, but calmly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to die but since I have to I’ll die as becomes a Murray,”\r\nshe said. She had read a similar sentence in a book and it came pat\r\nto the moment. And now she must hurry. That letter to Ilse must be\r\nwritten. Emily went to Aunt Elizabeth’s room first, to assure herself\r\nthat her right-hand top bureau drawer was quite tidy; then she flitted\r\nup the garret stairs to her dormer corner. The great place was full of\r\nlurking, pouncing shadows that crowded about the little island of faint\r\ncandlelight, but they had no terrors for Emily now.\r\n\r\n“And to think I was feeling so bad to-day because my petticoat was\r\nbunchy,” she thought, as she got one of her dear letter-bills--the last\r\nshe would ever write on. There was no need to write to Father--she\r\nwould see him soon--but Ilse must have her letter--dear, loving, jolly,\r\nhot-tempered Ilse, who, just the day before had shrieked insulting\r\nepithets after her and who would be haunted by remorse all her life for\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Dearest Ilse,” wrote Emily, her hand shaking a little but her lips\r\nfirmly set. “I am going to die. I have been poisoned by an apple Lofty\r\nJohn had put for rats. I will never see you again, but I am writing\r\nthis to tell you I love you and you are not to feel bad because you\r\ncalled me a skunk and a bloodthirsty mink yesterday. I forgive you, so\r\ndo not worry over it. And I am sorry I told you that you were beneath\r\ncontemt because I didn’t mean a word of it. I leave you all my share of\r\nthe broken dishes in our playhouse and please tell Teddy good-bye for\r\nme. He will never be able to teach me how to put worms on a fish-hook\r\nnow. I promised him I would learn because I did not want him to think\r\nI was a coward but I am glad I did not for I know what the worm feels\r\nlike now. I do not feel sick yet but I dont know what the simptoms of\r\npoisoning are and Lofty John said there was enough to kill a dozen of\r\nme so I cant have long to live. If Aunt Elizabeth is willing you can\r\nhave my necklace of Venetian beads. It is the only valuble possession\r\nI have. Don’t let anybody do anything to Lofty John because he did\r\nnot mean to poison me and it was all my own fault for being so\r\ngreedy. Perhaps people will think he did it on purpose because I am a\r\nProtestant but I feel sure he did not and please tell him not to be\r\nhawnted by remorse. I think I feel a pain in my stomach now so I guess\r\nthat the end draws ni. Fare well and remember her who died so young.\r\n\r\n                         “Your own devoted,\r\n                                          “_Emily_.”\r\n\r\nAs Emily folded up her letter-bill she heard the sound of wheels in the\r\nyard below. A moment later Elizabeth and Laura Murray were confronted\r\nin the kitchen by a tragic-faced little creature, grasping a guttering\r\ncandle in one hand and a red letter-bill in the other.\r\n\r\n“Emily, what is the matter?” cried Aunt Laura.\r\n\r\n“I’m dying,” said Emily solemnly. “I et an apple Lofty John had\r\npoisoned for rats. I have only a few minutes to live, Aunt Laura.”\r\n\r\nLaura Murray dropped down on the black bench with her hand at her\r\nheart. Elizabeth turned as pale as Emily herself.\r\n\r\n“Emily, is this some play-acting of yours?” she demanded sternly.\r\n\r\n“No,” cried Emily, quite indignantly. “It’s the truth. Do you suppose\r\na dying person would be play-acting? And oh, Aunt Elizabeth, please\r\nwill you give this letter to Ilse--and please forgive me for being\r\nnaughty--though I wasn’t always naughty when you thought I was--and\r\ndon’t let any one see me after I’m dead if I turn black--especially\r\nRhoda Stuart.”\r\n\r\nBy this time Aunt Elizabeth was herself again.\r\n\r\n“How long ago is it since you ate that apple, Emily?”\r\n\r\n“About an hour.”\r\n\r\n“If you’d eaten a poisoned apple an hour ago you’d be dead or sick by\r\nnow--”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” cried Emily transformed in a second. A wild, sweet hope sprang\r\nup in her heart--was there a chance for her after all? Then she added\r\ndespairingly, “But I felt another pain in my stomach just as I came\r\ndownstairs.”\r\n\r\n“Laura,” said Aunt Elizabeth, “take this child out to the cook-house\r\nand give her a good dose of mustard and water at once. It will do no\r\nharm and _may_ do some good, if there’s anything in this yarn of hers.\r\nI’m going down to the doctor’s--he may be back--but I’ll see Lofty John\r\non the way.”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth went out--and Aunt Elizabeth went out very quickly--if\r\nit had been any one else it might have been said she ran. As for\r\nEmily--well, Aunt Laura gave her that emetic in short order and two\r\nminutes later Emily had no doubt at all that she was dying then and\r\nthere--and the sooner the better. When Aunt Elizabeth returned Emily\r\nwas lying on the sofa in the kitchen, as white as the pillow under her\r\nhead, and as limp as a faded lily.\r\n\r\n“Wasn’t the doctor home?” cried Aunt Laura desperately.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know--there’s no need of the doctor. I didn’t think there was\r\nfrom the first. It was just one of Lofty John’s jokes. He thought he’d\r\ngive Emily a fright--just for fun--_his_ idea of fun. March you off to\r\nbed, Miss Emily. You deserve all you’ve got for going over there to\r\nLofty John’s at all and I don’t pity you a particle. I haven’t had such\r\na turn for years.”\r\n\r\n“I _did_ have a pain in my stomach,” wailed Emily, in whom fright and\r\nmustard-and-water combined had temporarily extinguished all spirit.\r\n\r\n“Any one who eats apples from dawn to dark must expect a few pains in\r\nher stomach. You won’t have any more to-night, I reckon--the mustard\r\nwill remedy that. Take your candle and go.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Emily, getting unsteadily to her feet, “I _hate_ that\r\ndod-gasted Lofty John.”\r\n\r\n“Emily!” said both aunts together.\r\n\r\n“He _deserves_ it,” said Emily vindictively.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Emily--that dreadful word you used!” Aunt Laura seemed curiously\r\nupset about something.\r\n\r\n“Why, what’s the matter with dod-gasted?” said Emily, quite mystified.\r\n“Cousin Jimmy uses it often, when things vex him. He used it to-day--he\r\nsaid that dod-gasted heifer had broken out of the graveyard pasture\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“Emily,” said Aunt Elizabeth, with the air of one impaling herself on\r\nthe easiest horn of a dilemma, “your Cousin Jimmy is a man--and men\r\nsometimes use expressions, in the heat of anger, that are not proper\r\nfor little girls.”\r\n\r\n“But what _is_ the matter with dod-gasted?” persisted Emily. “It isn’t\r\na swear word, is it? And if it isn’t, why can’t I use it?”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t a--a ladylike word,” said Aunt Laura.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I won’t use it any more,” said Emily resignedly, “but\r\nLofty John _is_ dod-gasted.”\r\n\r\nAunt Laura laughed so much after Emily had gone upstairs that Aunt\r\nElizabeth told her a woman of her age should have more sense.\r\n\r\n“Elizabeth, you _know_ it was funny,” protested Laura.\r\n\r\nEmily being safely out of sight, Elizabeth permitted herself a somewhat\r\ngrim smile.\r\n\r\n“I told Lofty John a few plain truths--he’ll not go telling children\r\nthey’re poisoned again in a hurry. I left him fairly dancing with rage.”\r\n\r\nWorn out, Emily fell asleep as soon as she was in bed; but an hour\r\nlater she awakened. Aunt Elizabeth had not yet come to bed so the blind\r\nwas still up and Emily saw a dear, friendly star winking down at her.\r\nFar away the sea moaned alluringly. Oh, it was nice just to be alone\r\nand to be alive. Life tasted good to her again--“tasted like more,” as\r\nCousin Jimmy said. She could have a chance to write more letter-bills,\r\nand poetry--Emily already saw a yard of verses entitled “Thoughts of\r\nOne Doomed to Sudden Death”--and play with Ilse and Teddy--scour the\r\nbarns with Saucy Sal, watch Aunt Laura skim cream in the dairy and\r\nhelp cousin Jimmy garden,--read books in Emily’s Bower and trot along\r\nthe To-day Road--but _not_ visit Lofty John’s workshop. She determined\r\nthat she would never have anything to do with Lofty John again after\r\nhis diabolical cruelty. She felt so indignant with him for frightening\r\nher--after they had been such good friends, too--that she could not go\r\nto sleep until she had composed an account of her death by poison, of\r\nLofty John being tried for her murder and condemned to death, and of\r\nhis being hanged on a gibbet as lofty as himself, Emily being present\r\nat the dreadful scene, in spite of the fact that she was dead by his\r\nact. When she had finally cut him down and buried him with obloquy--the\r\ntears streaming down her face out of sympathy for Mrs. Lofty John--she\r\nforgave him. Very likely he was not dod-gasted after all.\r\n\r\nShe wrote it all down on a letter-bill in the garret the next day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nFANCY FED\r\n\r\n\r\nIn October Cousin Jimmy began to boil the pigs’ potatoes--unromantic\r\nname for a most romantic occupation--or so it appeared to Emily, whose\r\nlove of the beautiful and picturesque was satisfied as it had never yet\r\nbeen on those long, cool, starry twilights of the waning year at New\r\nMoon.\r\n\r\nThere was a clump of spruce-trees in a corner of the old orchard,\r\nand under them an immense iron pot was hung over a circle of large\r\nstones--a pot so big that an ox could have been comfortably stewed in\r\nit. Emily thought it must have come down from the days of fairy tales\r\nand been some giant’s porridge pot; but Cousin Jimmy told her that it\r\nwas only a hundred years old and old Hugh Murray had had it sent out\r\nfrom England.\r\n\r\n“We’ve used it ever since to boil the potatoes for the New Moon pigs,”\r\nhe said. “Blair Water folks think it old-fashioned; they’ve all got\r\nboiler-houses now, with built-in boilers; but as long as Elizabeth’s\r\nboss at New Moon we’ll use this.”\r\n\r\nEmily was sure no built-in boiler could have the charm of the big pot.\r\nShe helped Cousin Jimmy fill it full of potatoes after she came from\r\nschool; then, when supper was over, Cousin Jimmy lighted the fire\r\nunder it and puttered about it all the evening. Sometimes he poked\r\nthe fire--Emily loved that part of the performance--sending glorious\r\nstreams of rosy sparks upward into the darkness; sometimes he stirred\r\nthe potatoes with a long pole, looking, with his queer, forked grey\r\nbeard and belted “jumper,” just like some old gnome or troll of\r\nnorthland story mixing the contents of a magical caldron; and sometimes\r\nhe sat beside Emily on the grey granite boulder near the pot and\r\nrecited his poetry for her. Emily liked this best of all, for Cousin\r\nJimmy’s poetry was surprisingly good--at least in spots--and Cousin\r\nJimmy had “fit audience though few” in this slender little maiden with\r\nher pale eager face and rapt eyes.\r\n\r\nThey were an odd couple and they were perfectly happy together. Blair\r\nWater people thought Cousin Jimmy a failure and a mental weakling.\r\nBut he dwelt in an ideal world of which none of them knew anything.\r\nHe had recited his poems a hundred times thus, as he boiled the pigs’\r\npotatoes; the ghosts of a score of autumns haunted the clump of spruces\r\nfor him. He was an odd, ridiculous figure enough, bent and wrinkled and\r\nunkempt, gesticulating awkwardly as he recited. But it was his hour;\r\nhe was no longer “simple Jimmy Murray” but a prince in his own realm.\r\nFor a little while he was strong and young and splendid and beautiful,\r\naccredited master of song to a listening, enraptured world. None of his\r\nprosperous, sensible Blair Water neighbours ever lived through such\r\nan hour. He would not have exchanged places with one of them. Emily,\r\nlistening to him, felt vaguely that if it had not been for that unlucky\r\npush into the New Moon well, this queer little man beside her might\r\nhave stood in the presence of kings.\r\n\r\nBut Elizabeth _had_ pushed him into the New Moon well and as a\r\nconsequence he boiled pigs’ potatoes and recited to Emily--Emily, who\r\nwrote poetry too, and loved these evenings so much that she could not\r\nsleep after she went to bed until she had composed a minute description\r\nof them. The flash came almost every evening over something or\r\nother. The Wind Woman swooped or purred in the tossing boughs above\r\nthem--Emily had never been so near to seeing her; the sharp air was\r\nfull of the pleasant tang of the burning spruce cones Cousin Jimmy\r\nshovelled under the pot; Emily’s furry kitten, Mike II, frisked and\r\nscampered about like a small, charming demon of the night; the fire\r\nglowed with beautiful redness and allure through the gloom; there were\r\nnice whispery sounds everywhere; the “great big dark” lay spread around\r\nthem full of mysteries that daylight never revealed; and over all a\r\npurple sky powdered with stars.\r\n\r\nIlse and Teddy came, too, on some evenings. Emily always knew when\r\nTeddy was coming, for when he reached the old orchard he whistled his\r\n“call”--the one he used just for her--a funny, dear little call, like\r\nthree clear bird notes, the first just medium pitch, the second higher,\r\nthe third dropping away into lowness and sweetness long-drawn-out--like\r\nthe echoes in the _Bugle Song_ that went clearer and further in their\r\ndying. That call always had an odd effect on Emily; it seemed to her\r\nthat it fairly drew the heart out of her body--and she _had_ to follow\r\nit. She thought Teddy could have whistled her clear across the world\r\nwith those three magic notes. Whenever she heard it she ran quickly\r\nthrough the orchard and told Teddy whether Cousin Jimmy wanted him or\r\nnot, because it was only on certain nights that Cousin Jimmy wanted\r\nanybody but her. He would never recite his poetry to Ilse or Teddy;\r\nbut he told them fairy stories, and tales about the old dead-and-gone\r\nMurrays in the pond graveyard that were as queer, sometimes, as the\r\nfairy stories; and Ilse would recite too, doing better there than\r\nshe ever did anywhere else; and sometimes Teddy lay sprawled out on\r\nthe ground beside the big pot and drew pictures by the light of the\r\nfire--pictures of Cousin Jimmy stirring the potatoes--pictures of\r\nIlse and Emily dancing hand in hand around it like two small witches,\r\npictures of Mike’s cunning, little, whiskered face peering around the\r\nold boulder, pictures of weird, vague faces crowding in the darkness\r\noutside their enchanted circle. They had very wonderful evenings there,\r\nthose four children.\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t you like the world at night, Ilse?” Emily once said\r\nrapturously.\r\n\r\nIlse glanced happily around her--poor little neglected Ilse, who found\r\nin Emily’s companionship what she had hungered for all her short life\r\nand who was, even now, being led by love into something of her rightful\r\nheritage.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said. “And I always believe there _is_ a God when I’m here\r\nlike this.”\r\n\r\nThen the potatoes were done--and Cousin Jimmy gave each of them one\r\nbefore he mixed in the bran; they broke them in pieces on plates of\r\nbirch-bark, sprinkled them with salt which Emily had cached in a small\r\nbox under the roots of the biggest spruce, and ate them with gusto. No\r\nbanquet of gods was ever as delicious as those potatoes. Then finally\r\ncame Aunt Laura’s kind, silvery voice calling through the frosty dark;\r\nIlse and Teddy scampered homewards; and Emily captured Mike II and shut\r\nhim up safely for the night in the New Moon dog-house which had held\r\nno dog for years, but was still carefully preserved and whitewashed\r\nevery spring. Emily’s heart would have broken if anything had happened\r\nto Mike II.\r\n\r\n“Old Kelly,” the tin pedlar, had given him to her. Old Kelly had come\r\nround through Blair Water every fortnight from May to November for\r\nthirty years, perched on the seat of a bright red pedlar’s wagon and\r\nbehind a dusty, ambling, red pony of that peculiar gait and appearance\r\npertaining to the ponies of country pedlars--a certain placid,\r\nunhasting leanness as of a nag that has encountered troubles of his own\r\nand has lived them down by sheer patience and staying power. From the\r\nbright red wagon proceeded a certain metallic rumbling and clinking\r\nas it bowled along, and two huge nests of tin pans on its flat,\r\nrope-encircled roof flashed back the sunlight so dazzlingly that Old\r\nKelly seemed the beaming sun of a little planetary system all his own.\r\nA new broom, sticking up aggressively at each of the four corners gave\r\nthe wagon a resemblance to a triumphal chariot. Emily hankered secretly\r\nfor a ride in Old Kelly’s wagon. She thought it must be very delightful.\r\n\r\nOld Kelly and she were great friends. She liked his red, clean-shaven\r\nface under his plug hat, his nice, twinkly, blue eyes, his brush of\r\nupstanding, sandy hair, and his comical pursed-up mouth, the shape of\r\nwhich was partly due to nature and partly to much whistling. He always\r\nhad a little three-cornered paper bag of “lemon drops” for her, or a\r\ncandy stick of many colours, which he smuggled into her pocket when\r\nAunt Elizabeth wasn’t looking. And he never forgot to tell her that\r\nhe supposed she’d soon be thinking of getting married--for Old Kelly\r\nthought that the surest way to please a female creature of any age was\r\nto tease her about getting married.\r\n\r\nOne day, instead of candy, he produced a plump grey kitten from the\r\nback drawer of his wagon and told her it was for her. Emily received\r\nthe gift rapturously, but after Old Kelly had rattled and clattered\r\naway Aunt Elizabeth told her they did not want any more cats at New\r\nMoon.\r\n\r\n“Oh, please let me keep it, Aunt Elizabeth,” Emily begged. “It won’t\r\nbe a bit of bother to you. _I_ have had experience in bringing up\r\ncats. And I’m so lonesome for a kitten. Saucy Sal is getting so wild\r\nrunning with the barn cats that I can’t ’sociate with her like I used\r\nto do--and she never was nice to cuddle. _Please_, Aunt Elizabeth.”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth would not and did not please. She was in a very bad\r\nhumour that day, anyhow,--nobody knew just why. In such a mood she\r\nwas entirely unreasonable. She would not listen to anybody--Laura and\r\nCousin Jimmy had to hold their tongues, and Cousin Jimmy was bidden to\r\ntake the grey kitten down to the Blair Water and drown it. Emily burst\r\ninto tears over this cruel command, and this aggravated Aunt Elizabeth\r\nstill further. She was so cross that Cousin Jimmy dared not smuggle the\r\nkitten up to the barn as he had at first planned to do.\r\n\r\n“Take that beast down to the pond and throw it in and come back\r\nand tell me you’ve done it,” said Elizabeth angrily. “I mean to be\r\nobeyed--New Moon is not going to be made a dumping-ground for Old Jock\r\nKelly’s superfluous cats.”\r\n\r\nCousin Jimmy did as he was told and Emily would not eat any dinner.\r\nAfter dinner she stole mournfully away through the old orchard down\r\nthe pasture to the pond. Just why she went she could not have told,\r\nbut she felt that go she must. When she reached the bank of the little\r\ncreek where Lofty John’s brook ran into Blair Water, she heard piteous\r\nshrieks; and there, marooned on a tiny islet of sere marsh grass in the\r\ncreek, was an unhappy little beast, its soaking fur plastered against\r\nits sides, shivering and trembling in the wind of the sharp autumnal\r\nday. The old oat-bag in which Cousin Jimmy had imprisoned it was\r\nfloating out into the pond.\r\n\r\nEmily did not stop to think, or look for a board, or count the\r\nconsequences. She plunged in the creek up to her knees, she waded out\r\nto the clump of grass and caught the kitten up. She was so hot with\r\nindignation that she did not feel the cold of the water or the chill\r\nof the wind as she ran back to New Moon. A suffering or tortured\r\nanimal always filled her with such a surge of sympathy that it lifted\r\nher clean out of herself. She burst into the cook-house where Aunt\r\nElizabeth was frying doughnuts.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Elizabeth,” she cried, “the kitten wasn’t drowned after all--and\r\nI _am_ going to keep it.”\r\n\r\n“You’re not,” said Aunt Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nEmily looked her aunt in the face. Again she felt that odd sensation\r\nthat had come when Aunt Elizabeth brought the scissors to cut her hair.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Elizabeth, this poor little kitten is cold and starving, and\r\noh, so miserable. It has been suffering for hours. It shall _not_ be\r\ndrowned again.”\r\n\r\nArchibald Murray’s look was on her face and Archibald Murray’s tone\r\nwas in her voice. This happened only when the deeps of her being were\r\nstirred by some peculiarly poignant emotion. Just now she was in an\r\nagony of pity and anger.\r\n\r\nWhen Elizabeth Murray saw her father looking at her out of Emily’s\r\nlittle white face, she surrendered without a struggle, rage at herself\r\nas she might afterwards for her weakness. It was her one vulnerable\r\npoint. The thing might not have been so uncanny if Emily had resembled\r\nthe Murrays. But to see the Murray look suddenly superimposed like a\r\nmask over alien features, was such a shock to her nerves that she could\r\nnot stand up against it. A ghost from the grave could not have cowed\r\nher more speedily.\r\n\r\nShe turned her back on Emily in silence but Emily knew that she had\r\nwon her second victory. The grey kitten stayed at New Moon and waxed\r\nfat and lovable, and Aunt Elizabeth never took the slightest notice\r\nof its existence, save to sweep it out of the house when Emily was not\r\nabout. But it was weeks before Emily was really forgiven and she felt\r\nuncomfortable enough over it. Aunt Elizabeth could be a not ungenerous\r\nconqueror but she was very disagreeable in defeat. It was really just\r\nas well that Emily could not summon the Murray look at will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nVARIOUS TRAGEDIES\r\n\r\n\r\nEmily, obedient to Aunt Elizabeth’s command, had eliminated the word\r\n“bull” from her vocabulary. But to ignore the existence of bulls was\r\nnot to do away with them--and specifically with Mr. James Lee’s English\r\nbull, who inhabited the big windy pasture west of Blair Water and\r\nwho bore a dreadful reputation. He was certainly an awesome looking\r\ncreature and Emily sometimes had fearful dreams of being chased by him\r\nand being unable to move. And one sharp November day these dreams came\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain well at the far end of the pasture concerning\r\nwhich Emily felt a curiosity, because Cousin Jimmy had told her a\r\ndreadful tale about it. The well had been dug sixty years ago by two\r\nbrothers who lived in a little house which was built down near the\r\nshore. It was a very deep well, which was considered a curious thing\r\nin that low-lying land near pond and sea; the brothers had gone ninety\r\nfeet before they found a spring. Then the sides of the well had been\r\nstoned up--but the work never went further. Thomas and Silas Lee had\r\nquarrelled over some trivial difference of opinion as to what kind of\r\na hood should be put over it; and in the heat of his anger Silas had\r\nstruck Thomas on the head with his hammer and killed him.\r\n\r\nThe well-house was never built. Silas Lee was sent to prison for\r\nmanslaughter and died there. The farm passed to another brother--Mr.\r\nJames Lee’s father--who moved the house to the other end of it and\r\nplanked the well over. Cousin Jimmy added that Tom Lee’s ghost was\r\nsupposed to haunt the scene of his tragic death but he couldn’t vouch\r\nfor that, though he had written a poem on it. A very eerie poem it was,\r\ntoo, and made Emily’s blood run cold with a fearful joy when he recited\r\nit to her one misty night by the big potato pot. Ever since she had\r\nwanted to see the old well.\r\n\r\nHer chance came one Saturday when she was prowling alone in the old\r\ngraveyard. Beyond it lay the Lee pasture and there was apparently not a\r\nsign of a bull in or about it. Emily decided to pay a visit to the old\r\nwell and went skimming down the field against the sweep of the north\r\nwind racing across the gulf. The Wind Woman was a giantess that day and\r\na mighty swirl she was stirring up along the shore; but as Emily drew\r\nnear the big sand-dunes they made a little harbour of calmness around\r\nthe old well.\r\n\r\nEmily coolly lifted up one of the planks, knelt on the others and\r\npeered down. Fortunately the planks were strong and comparatively\r\nnew--otherwise the small maiden of New Moon might have explored the\r\nwell more thoroughly than she desired to do. As it was, she could see\r\nlittle of it; huge ferns grew thickly out of the crevices among the\r\nstones of its sides and reached across it, shutting out the view of\r\nits gloomy depths. Rather disappointed, Emily replaced the plank and\r\nstarted homeward. She had not gone ten steps before she stopped. Mr.\r\nJames Lee’s bull was coming straight towards her and was less than\r\ntwenty yards away.\r\n\r\nThe shore fence was not far behind Emily, and she might possibly have\r\nreached it in time had she run. But she was incapable of running; as\r\nshe wrote that night in her letter to her father she was “parralised”\r\nwith terror and could no more move than she could in her dreams of this\r\nvery occurrence. It is quite conceivable that a dreadful thing might\r\nhave happened then and there had not a certain boy been sitting on the\r\nshore fence. He had been sitting there unnoticed all the time Emily had\r\nbeen peering into the well; now he sprang down.\r\n\r\nEmily saw, or sensed, a sturdy body dashing past her. The owner thereof\r\nran to within ten feet of the bull, hurled a stone squarely into the\r\nmonster’s hairy face, then sped off at right angles towards the side\r\nfence. The bull, thus insulted, turned with a menacing rumble and\r\nlumbered off after this intruder.\r\n\r\n“Run now!” screamed the boy over his shoulder to Emily.\r\n\r\nEmily did not run. Terrified as she was, there was something in her\r\nthat would not let her run until she saw whether her gallant rescuer\r\nmade good his escape. He reached his fence in the nick of time. Then\r\nand not till then Emily ran too, and scrambled over the shore fence\r\njust as the bull started back across the pasture, evidently determined\r\nto catch somebody. Trembling, she made her way through the spiky grass\r\nof the sand-hills and met the boy at the corner. They stood and looked\r\nat each other for a moment.\r\n\r\nThe boy was a stranger to Emily. He had a cheery, impudent, clean-cut\r\nface, with keen, grey eyes and plenty of tawny curls. He wore as few\r\nclothes as decency permitted and had only the pretence of a hat. Emily\r\nliked him; there was nothing of Teddy’s subtle charm in him but he had\r\na certain forceful attraction of his own and he had just saved her from\r\na terrible death.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Emily shyly, looking up at him with great grey eyes\r\nthat looked blue under her long lashes. It was a very effective look\r\nwhich lost nothing of effectiveness from being wholly unconscious.\r\nNobody had as yet told Emily how very winsome that shy, sudden,\r\nup-glance of hers was.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t he a rip-snorter?” said the boy easily. He thrust his hands into\r\nhis ragged pockets and stared at Emily so fixedly that she dropped her\r\neyes in confusion--thereby doing further damage with those demure lids\r\nand silken fringes.\r\n\r\n“He’s dreadful,” she said with a shudder. “And I was so scared.”\r\n\r\n“Were you now? And me thinking you were full of grit to be standing\r\nthere like that looking at him cool as a cucumber. What’s it like to be\r\nafraid?”\r\n\r\n“Weren’t _you_ ever afraid?” asked Emily.\r\n\r\n“No--don’t know what it’s like,” said the boy carelessly, and a bit\r\nboastfully. “What’s your name?”\r\n\r\n“Emily Byrd Starr.”\r\n\r\n“Live round here?”\r\n\r\n“I live at New Moon.”\r\n\r\n“Where Simple Jimmy Murray lives?”\r\n\r\n“He _isn’t_ simple,” cried Emily indignantly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, all right. I don’t know him. But I’m going to. I’m going to hire\r\nwith him for chore boy for the winter.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know,” said Emily, surprised. “Are you really?”\r\n\r\n“Yep. I didn’t know it myself till just this minute. He was asking Aunt\r\nTom about me last week but I didn’t mean to hire out then. Now I guess\r\nI will. Want to know my name?”\r\n\r\n“Of course.”\r\n\r\n“Perry Miller. I live with my old beast of an Aunt Tom down at\r\nStovepipe Town. Dad was a sea-captain and I uster sail with him when he\r\nwas alive--sailed everywhere. Go to school?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t--never did. Aunt Tom lives so far away. Anyhow, I didn’t\r\nthink I’d like it. Guess I’ll go now, though.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t you read?” asked Emily wonderingly.\r\n\r\n“Yes--some--and figger. Dad learned me some when he was alive. I hain’t\r\nbothered with it since--I’d ruther be down round the harbour. Great\r\nfun there. But if I make up my mind to go to school I’ll learn like\r\nthunder. I s’pose you’re awful clever.”\r\n\r\n“No--not very. Father said I was a genius, but Aunt Elizabeth says I’m\r\njust queer.”\r\n\r\n“What’s a genius?”\r\n\r\n“I’m not sure. Sometimes it’s a person who writes poetry. _I_ write\r\npoetry.”\r\n\r\nPerry stared at her.\r\n\r\n“Golly. I’ll write poetry too, then.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe _you_ could write poetry,” said Emily--a little\r\ndisdainfully, it must be admitted. “Teddy can’t--and he’s _very_\r\nclever.”\r\n\r\n“Who’s Teddy?”\r\n\r\n“A friend of mine.” There was just a trace of stiffness in Emily’s\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Perry, folding his arms across his breast and scowling,\r\n“I’m going to punch this friend of yours’ head for him.”\r\n\r\n“You’re not,” cried Emily. She was very indignant and quite forgot for\r\nthe moment that Perry had rescued her from the bull. She tossed her own\r\nhead and started homeward. Perry turned too.\r\n\r\n“May as well go up and see Jimmy Murray about hiring ’fore I go home,”\r\nhe said. “Don’t be mad, now. If you don’t want anybody’s head punched I\r\nwon’t punch it. Only you’ve gotter like me, too.”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course I’ll like you,” said Emily, as if there could be no\r\nquestion about it. She smiled her slow, blossoming smile at Perry and\r\nthereby reduced him to hopeless bondage.\r\n\r\nTwo days later Perry Miller was installed as chore boy at New Moon and\r\nin a fortnight’s time Emily felt as if he must have been there always.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Elizabeth didn’t want Cousin Jimmy to hire him,” she wrote to\r\nher father, “because he was one of the boys who did a dreadful thing\r\none night last fall. They changed all the horses that were tied to\r\nthe fence one Sunday night when preaching was going on and when folks\r\ncame out the confushun was awful. Aunt Elizabeth said it wouldn’t be\r\nsafe to have him round the place. But Cousin Jimmy said it was awful\r\nhard to get a chore boy and that we ode Perry something for saving my\r\nlife from the bull. So Aunt Elizabeth gave in and lets him sit at the\r\ntable with us but he has to stay in the kitchen in the evenings. The\r\nrest of us are in the sitting-room, but I am allowed to go out and\r\nhelp Perry with his lessons. He can only have one candle and the light\r\nis very dim. It keeps us snuffing it all the time. It is great fun to\r\nsnuff candles. Perry is head of his class in school already. He is\r\nonly in the third book all-though he is nearly twelve. Miss Brownell\r\nsaid something sarkastik to him the first day in school and he just\r\nthrew back his head and laughed loud and long. Miss Brownell gave him a\r\nwhipping for it but she has never been sarkastik to him again. She does\r\nnot like to be laughed at I can see. Perry isn’t afraid of anything. I\r\nthought he might not go to school any more when she whipped him but he\r\nsays a little thing like that isn’t going to keep him from getting an\r\neducashun since he has made up his mind to it. He is very determined.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Elizabeth is determined too. But she says Perry is stubborn. I am\r\nteaching Perry grammar. He says he wants to learn to speak properly. I\r\ntold him he should not call his Aunt Tom an old beast but he said he\r\nhad to because she wasn’t a young beast. He says the place he lives\r\nin is called Stovepipe Town because the houses have no chimneys, only\r\npipes sticking out of the roof, but he would live in a manshun some\r\nday. Aunt Elizabeth says I ought not to be so friendly with a hired\r\nboy. But he is a nice boy though his manners are crood. Aunt Laura\r\nsays they are crood. I don’t know what it means but I guess it means\r\nhe always says what he thinks right out and eats beans with his knife.\r\nI like Perry but in a different way from Teddy. Isn’t it funny, dear\r\nFather, how many kinds of ways of liking there are? I don’t think Ilse\r\nlikes him. She makes fun of his ignerance and turns up her nose at him\r\nbecause his close are patched though her own close are queer enough.\r\nTeddy doesnt like him much and he drew such a funny picture of Perry\r\nhanging by his heels from a gallos. The face looked like Perrys and\r\nstill it didn’t. Cousin Jimmy said it was a carrycachure and laughed\r\nat it but I dared not show it to Perry for fear he would punch Teddys\r\nhead. I showed it to Ilse and she got mad and tore it in two. I cant\r\nimagine why.\r\n\r\n“Perry says he can recite as well as Ilse and could draw pictures too\r\nif he put his mind to it. I can see he doesnt like to think anybody can\r\ndo anything he cant. But he cant see the wallpaper in the air like I\r\ncan though he tries until I fear he will strane his eyes. He can make\r\nbetter speeches than any of us. He says he used to mean to be a sailer\r\nlike his father but now he thinks he will be a lawyer when he grows\r\nup and go to parlament. Teddy is going to be an artist if his mother\r\nwill let him, and Ilse is going to be a concert reciter--there is\r\nanother name but I don’t know how it is spelled--and I am going to be a\r\npoetess. I think we are a tallented crowd. Perhaps that is a vane thing\r\nto say, dear Father.\r\n\r\n“A very terrible thing happened the day before yesterday. On Saturday\r\nmorning we were at family prayers, all kneeling quite solemn around the\r\nkitchen. I just looked at Perry once and he made such a funny face at\r\nme that I laughed right out loud before I could help it. (_That_ was\r\nnot the terrible thing.) Aunt Elizabeth was _very_ angry. I would not\r\ntell that it was Perry made me laugh because I was afraid he might be\r\nsent away if I did. So Aunt Elizabeth said I was to be punished and\r\nI was not let go to Jennie Strangs party in the afternoon. (It was a\r\ndreadful disappointment but _it_ was not the terrible thing either.)\r\nPerry was away with Cousin Jimmy all day and when he came home at night\r\nhe said to me, very feerce, Who has been making you cry. I said I had\r\nbeen crying--a little but not much--because I was not let go to the\r\nparty because I had laughed at prayers. And Perry marched right up to\r\nAunt Elizabeth and told her it was all his fault that I laughed. Aunt\r\nElizabeth said I should not have laughed anyhow, but Aunt Laura was\r\n_greevously_ upset and said my punishment had been far too severe; and\r\nshe said that she would let me ware her pearl ring to school Monday to\r\nmake up for it. I was enraptured for it is a lovely ring and no other\r\ngirl has one. As soon as roll call was over Monday morning I put up my\r\nhand to ask Miss Brownell a question but really to show off my ring.\r\nThat was wikked pride and I was punished. At recess Cora Lee, one of\r\nthe big girls in the sixth class came and asked me to let her ware the\r\nring for a while. I didnt want to but she said if I didnt she would get\r\nall the girls in my class to send me to coventry (which is a dreadful\r\nthing, dear Father, and makes you feel like an outcast). So I let her\r\nand she kept it on till the afternoon recess and then she came and\r\ntold me she had lost it in the brook. (This was the terrible thing).\r\nOh, Father dear, I was nearly wild. I dared not go home and face Aunt\r\nLaura. I had promised her I would be so careful of the ring. I thought\r\nI might earn money to get her another ring but when I figgered it out\r\non my slate I knew I would have to wash dishes for twenty years to do\r\nit. I wepped in my despare. Perry saw me and after school he marched up\r\nto Cora Lee and said You fork over that ring or I’ll tell Miss Brownell\r\nabout it. And Cora Lee forked it over, very meek and said I was going\r\nto give it to her anyhow. I was just playing a joke and Perry said,\r\nDont you play any more jokes on Emily or I’ll joke you. It is very\r\ncomforting to have such a champeen! I tremble to think what it would\r\nhave been like if I had had to go home and tell Aunt Laura I had lost\r\nher ring. But it was crewel of Cora Lee to tell me she had lost it when\r\nshe had not and harrow up my mind so. I could not be so crewel to an\r\norfan girl.\r\n\r\n“When I got home I looked in the glass to see if my hair had turned\r\nwhite. I am told that sometimes hapens. But it hadnt.\r\n\r\n“Perry knows more geograffy than any of us because he has been nearly\r\neverywhere in the world with his father. He tells me such fassinating\r\nstories after his lessons are done. He talks till the candle is burned\r\nto the last inch and then he uses that to go to bed with up the black\r\nhole into the kitchen loft because Aunt Elizabeth will not let him have\r\nmore than one candle a night.\r\n\r\n“Ilse and I had a fight yesterday about which we’d rather be Joan of\r\nArc or Frances Willard. We didn’t begin it as a fight but just as an\r\nargewment but it ended that way. _I_ would rather be Frances Willard\r\nbecause she is alive.\r\n\r\n“We had the first snow yesterday. I made a poem on it. This is it.\r\n\r\n    Along the snow the sunbeams glide\r\n    Earth is a peerless, gleaming bride,\r\n    Dripping with dimonds, clad in traling white,\r\n    No bride was ever half so fair and bright.\r\n\r\n“I read it to Perry and he said he could make poetry just as good and\r\nhe said right off,\r\n\r\n    Mike has made a long row\r\n    Of tracks across the snow.\r\n\r\nNow isnt that as good as yours. I didnt think it was because you could\r\nsay it just as well in prose. But when you talk of peerless gleaming\r\nbrides in prose it sounds funny. Mike _did_ make a row of little tracks\r\nright across the barn field and they looked so pretty, but not so\r\npretty as the mice tracks in some flour Cousin Jimmy spilled on the\r\ngranary floor. They are the dearest little things. They _look_ like\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry winter has come because Ilse and I cant play in our house\r\nin Lofty Johns bush any more till spring or outside at the Tansy Patch.\r\nSometimes we play indoors at the Tansy Patch but Mrs. Kent makes us\r\nfeel queer. She sits and watches us all the time. So we dont go only\r\nwhen Teddy coaxes very hard. And the pigs have been killed, poor\r\nthings, so Cousin Jimmy doesnt boil for them any more. But there is\r\none consolashun I do not have to ware a sunbonnet to school now. Aunt\r\nLaura made me such a pretty red hood with ribbons on it at which Aunt\r\nElizabeth looked skornfully saying it was extravagant. I like school\r\nhere better every day but I cant like Miss Brownell. She isnt fair.\r\nShe told us she would give the one who wrote the best composishun a\r\npink ribbon to wear from Friday night to Monday. I wrote The Brooks\r\nStory about the brook in Lofty John’s bush--all its advenshures and\r\nthoughts--and Miss Brownell said I must have copyed it and Rhoda Stuart\r\ngot the ribbon. Aunt Elizabeth said You waste enough time writing trash\r\nI think you might have won that ribbon. She was mortifyed (I think)\r\nbecause I had disgraced New Moon by not getting it but I did not tell\r\nher what had happened. Teddy says a _good sport_ never whines over\r\nlosing. I want to be a good sport. Rhoda is so hateful to me now. She\r\nsays she is surprised that a New Moon girl should have a hired boy for\r\na bow. That is very silly because Perry is not my bow. Perry told her\r\nshe had more gab than sense. That was not polite but it is true. One\r\nday in class Rhoda said the moon was situated east of Canada. Perry\r\nlaughed right out and Miss Brownell made him stay in at recess but she\r\nnever said anything to Rhoda for saying such a ridiklus thing. But the\r\nmeanest thing Rhoda said was that she had forgiven me for the way I\r\nhad used her. That made my blood boil when I hadnt done anything to be\r\nforgiven for. The idea.\r\n\r\n“We have begun to eat the big beef ham that hung in the southwest\r\ncorner of the kitchen.\r\n\r\n“The other Wednesday night Perry and I helped Cousin Jimmy pick a road\r\nthrough the turnips in the first cellar. We have to go through it to\r\nthe second cellar because the outside hatch is banked up now. It was\r\ngreat fun. We had a candle stuck up in a hole in the wall and it made\r\nsuch lovely shadows and we could eat all the apples we wanted from the\r\nbig barrel in the corner and the spirit moved Cousin Jimmy to recite\r\nsome of his poetry as he threw the turnips.\r\n\r\n“I am reading The Alhambra. It belongs to our book case. Aunt Elizabeth\r\ndoes not like to say it isnt fit for me to read because it was one of\r\nher fathers books, but I dont believe she aproves because she knits\r\nvery furiusly and looks black at me over her glasses. Teddy lent me\r\nHans Andersons stories. I love them--only I always think of a different\r\nend for the Ice Maiden and save Rudy.\r\n\r\n“They say Mrs. John Killegrew has swallowed her wedding-ring. I wonder\r\nwhat she did that for.\r\n\r\n“Cousin Jimmy says there is to be an eklips of the sun in December. I\r\nhope it wont interfear with Chrismas.\r\n\r\n“My hands are chapped. Aunt Laura rubs mutton tallow on them every\r\nnight when I go to bed. It is hard to write poetry with chapped hands.\r\nI wonder if Mrs. Hemans ever had chapped hands. It does not mention\r\nanything like that in her biograffy.\r\n\r\n“Jimmy Ball has to be a minister when he grows up. His mother told\r\nAunt Laura that she consekrated him to it in his cradle. I wonder how\r\nshe did it.\r\n\r\n“We have brekfast by candlelight now and I like it.\r\n\r\n“Ilse was up here Sunday afternoon and we went up in the garret and\r\ntalked about God, because that is propper on Sundays. We have to be\r\nvery careful what we do on Sundays. It is a traddishun of New Moon to\r\nkeep Sundays very holy. Grandfather Murray was very strikt. Cousin\r\nJimmy told me a story about him. They always cut the wood for Sunday\r\non Saturday night, but one time they forgot and there was no wood on\r\nSunday to cook the dinner, so Grandfather Murray said you must not cut\r\nwood on Sundays, boys, but just break a little with the back of the\r\naxe. Ilse is very curious about God although she doesnt believe in Him\r\nmost of the time and doesnt like to talk about Him but still wants to\r\nfind out about Him. She says she thinks she might like Him if she knew\r\nHim. She spells his name with a Capital G now because it is best to be\r\non the safe side. _I_ think God is just like my flash, only _it_ lasts\r\nonly a second and He lasts always. We talked so long we got hungry and\r\nI went down to the sitting-room cubbord and got two donuts. I forgot\r\nAunt Elizabeth had told me I could not have donuts between meals. It\r\nwas not stealing it was just forgetting. But Ilse got mad at the last\r\nand said I was a she jakobite (whatever that is) and a thief and that\r\nno Christian would steal donuts from her poor old aunt. So I went and\r\nconfessed to Aunt Elizabeth and she said I was not to have a donut at\r\nsupper. It was hard to see the others eating them. I thought Perry\r\net his very quick but after supper he bekoned me out doors and gave\r\nme half his donut which he had kept for me. He had rapped it in his\r\nhangkerchief which was not very clean but I et it because I did not\r\nwant to hurt his feelings.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Laura says Ilse has a nice smile. I wonder if I have a nice\r\nsmile. I looked at the glass in Ilse’s room and smiled but it did not\r\nseem to me very nice.\r\n\r\n“Now the nights have got cold Aunt Elizabeth always puts a gin jar full\r\nof hot water in the bed. I like to put my toes against it. That is all\r\nwe use the gin jar for nowadays. But Grandfather Murray used to keep\r\nreal gin in it.\r\n\r\n“Now that the snow has come Cousin Jimmy cant work in his garden any\r\nmore and he is very lonesome. I think the garden is just as pretty in\r\nwinter as in summer. There are such pretty dimples and baby hills where\r\nthe snow has covered up the flower beds. And in the evenings it is all\r\npink and rosy at sunset and by moonlight it is like dreamland. I like\r\nto look out of the sitting-room window at it and watch the rabbits\r\ncandles floting in the air above it and wonder what all the little\r\nroots and seeds are thinking of down under the snow. And it gives me a\r\nlovely creepy feeling to look at it through the red glass in the front\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n“There is a beautiful fringe of isikles along the cook-house roof. But\r\nthere will be much more beautiful things in heaven. I was reading about\r\nAnzonetta to-day and it made me feel relijus. Good night, my dearest of\r\nfathers.\r\n\r\n                                           “_Emily._\r\n\r\n“P. S. That doesnt mean that I have any other Father. It is just a way\r\nof saying _very very_ dear.\r\n\r\n                                        “_E. B. S._”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nCHECK FOR MISS BROWNELL\r\n\r\n\r\nEmily and Ilse were sitting out on the side bench of Blair Water school\r\nwriting poetry on their slates--at least, Emily was writing poetry and\r\nIlse was reading it as she wrote and occasionally suggesting a rhyme\r\nwhen Emily was momentarily stuck for one. It may as well be admitted\r\nhere and now that they had no business whatever to be doing this. They\r\nshould have been “doing sums,” as Miss Brownell supposed they were.\r\nBut Emily never did sums when she took it into her black head to write\r\npoetry, and Ilse hated arithmetic on general principles. Miss Brownell\r\nwas hearing the geography class at the other side of the room, the\r\npleasant sunshine was showering in over them through the big window,\r\nand everything seemed propitious for a flight with the muses. Emily\r\nbegan to write a poem about the view from the school window.\r\n\r\nIt was quite a long time since she had been allowed to sit out on the\r\nside bench. This was a boon reserved for those pupils who had found\r\nfavour in Miss Brownell’s cold eyes--and Emily had never been one of\r\nthose. But this afternoon Ilse had asked for both herself and Emily,\r\nand Miss Brownell had let both go, not being able to think of any\r\nvalid reason for permitting Ilse and refusing Emily--as she would have\r\nliked to do, for she had one of those petty natures which never forget\r\nor forgive any offence. Emily, on her first day of school, had, so\r\nMiss Brownell believed, been guilty of impertinence and defiance--and\r\nsuccessful defiance at that. This rankled in Miss Brownell’s mind\r\nstill and Emily felt its venom in a score of subtle ways. She never\r\nreceived any commendation--she was a target for Miss Brownell’s sarcasm\r\ncontinually--and the small favours that other girls received never came\r\nher way. So this opportunity to sit on the side bench was a pleasing\r\nnovelty.\r\n\r\nThere were points about sitting on the side bench. You could see all\r\nover the school without turning your head--and Miss Brownell could not\r\nsneak up behind you and look over your shoulder to see what you were up\r\nto; but in Emily’s eyes the finest thing about it was that you could\r\nlook right down into the “school bush,” and watch the old spruces where\r\nthe Wind Woman played, the long grey-green trails of moss hanging\r\nfrom the branches, like banners of Elfland, the little red squirrels\r\nrunning along the fence, and the wonderful white aisles of snow where\r\nsplashes of sunlight fell like pools of golden wine; and there was one\r\nlittle opening in the trees through which you could see right over\r\nthe Blair Water valley to the sand-hills and the gulf beyond. To-day\r\nthe sand-hills were softly rounded and gleaming white under the snow,\r\nbut beyond them the gulf was darkly, deeply blue with dazzling white\r\nmasses of ice like baby icebergs, floating about in it. Just to look\r\nat it thrilled Emily with a delight that was unutterable but which\r\nshe yet must try to utter. She began her poem. Fractions were utterly\r\nforgotten--what had numerators and denominators to do with those\r\ncurving bosoms of white snow--that heavenly blue--those crossed dark\r\nfir tips against the pearly skies--those ethereal woodland aisles of\r\npearl and gold? Emily was lost to her world--so lost that she did not\r\nknow the geography class had scattered to their respective seats and\r\nthat Miss Brownell, catching sight of Emily’s entranced gaze sky-wards\r\nas she searched for a rhyme, was stepping softly towards her. Ilse was\r\ndrawing a picture on her slate and did not see her or she would have\r\nwarned Emily. The latter suddenly felt her slate drawn out of her hand\r\nand heard Miss Brownell saying:\r\n\r\n“I suppose you have finished those sums, Emily?”\r\n\r\nEmily had not finished even one sum--she had only covered her slate\r\nwith verses--verses that Miss Brownell must not see--_must not_ see!\r\nEmily sprang to her feet and clutched wildly after her slate. But Miss\r\nBrownell, with a smile of malicious enjoyment on her thin lips, held it\r\nbeyond her reach.\r\n\r\n“What is this? It does not look--exactly--like fractions. ‘Lines on the\r\nView--v-e-w--from the Window of Blair Water School.’ Really, children,\r\nwe seem to have a budding poet among us.”\r\n\r\nThe words were harmless enough, but--oh, the hateful sneer that ran\r\nthrough the tone--the contempt, the mockery that was in it! It seared\r\nEmily’s soul like a whiplash. Nothing was more terrible to her than\r\nthe thought of having her beloved “poems” read by stranger eyes--cold,\r\nunsympathetic, derisive, stranger eyes.\r\n\r\n“Please--please, Miss Brownell,” she stammered miserably, “don’t read\r\nit--I’ll rub it off--I’ll do my sums right away. Only please don’t read\r\nit. It--it isn’t anything.”\r\n\r\nMiss Brownell laughed cruelly.\r\n\r\n“You are too modest, Emily. It is a whole slateful of--_poetry_--think\r\nof that, children--_poetry_. We have a pupil in this school who can\r\nwrite--_poetry_. And she does not want us to read this--_poetry_. I am\r\nafraid Emily is selfish. I am sure we should all enjoy this--_poetry_.”\r\n\r\nEmily cringed every time Miss Brownell said “_poetry_,” with that\r\njeering emphasis and that hateful pause before it. Many of the children\r\ngiggled, partly because they enjoyed seeing a “Murray of New Moon”\r\ngrilled, partly because they realized that Miss Brownell expected them\r\nto giggle. Rhoda Stuart giggled louder than any one else; but Jennie\r\nStrang, who had tormented Emily on her first day at school, refused to\r\ngiggle and scowled blackly at Miss Brownell instead.\r\n\r\nMiss Brownell held up the slate and read Emily’s poem aloud, in a\r\nsing-song nasal voice, with absurd intonations and gestures that made\r\nit seem a very ridiculous thing. The lines Emily had thought the finest\r\nseemed the most ridiculous. The other pupils laughed more than ever and\r\nEmily felt that the bitterness of the moment could never go out of her\r\nheart. The little fancies that had been so beautiful when they came to\r\nher as she wrote were shattered and bruised now, like torn and mangled\r\nbutterflies--“vistas in some fairy dream,” chanted Miss Brownell,\r\nshutting her eyes and wagging her head from side to side. The giggles\r\nbecame shouts of laughter.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” thought Emily, clenching her hands, “I wish--I wish the bears\r\nthat ate the naughty children in the Bible would come and eat _you_.”\r\n\r\nThere were no nice, retributive bears in the school bush, however, and\r\nMiss Brownell read the whole “poem” through. She was enjoying herself\r\nhugely. To ridicule a pupil always gave her pleasure and when that\r\npupil was Emily of New Moon, in whose heart and soul she had always\r\nsensed something fundamentally different from her own, the pleasure was\r\nexquisite.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the end she handed the slate back to the\r\ncrimson-cheeked Emily.\r\n\r\n“Take your--_poetry_, Emily,” she said.\r\n\r\nEmily snatched the slate. No slate “rag” was handy but Emily gave\r\nthe palm of her hand a fierce lick and one side of the slate was\r\nwiped off. Another lick--and the rest of the poem went. It had been\r\ndisgraced--degraded--it must be blotted out of existence. To the end of\r\nher life Emily never forgot the pain and humiliation of that experience.\r\n\r\nMiss Brownell laughed again.\r\n\r\n“What a pity to obliterate such--_poetry_, Emily,” she said. “Suppose\r\nyou do those sums now. They are not--_poetry_, but I am in this\r\nschool to teach arithmetic and I am not here to teach the art of\r\nwriting--_poetry_. Go to your own seat. Yes, Rhoda?”\r\n\r\nFor Rhoda Stuart was holding up her hand and snapping her fingers.\r\n\r\n“Please, Miss Brownell,” she said, with distinct triumph in her tones,\r\n“Emily Starr has a whole bunch of poetry in her desk. She was reading\r\nit to Ilse Burnley this morning while you thought they were learning\r\nhistory.”\r\n\r\nPerry Miller turned around and a delightful missile, compounded of\r\nchewed paper and known as a “spit pill,” flew across the room and\r\nstruck Rhoda squarely in the face. But Miss Brownell was already at\r\nEmily’s desk, having reached it one jump before Emily herself.\r\n\r\n“Don’t touch them--you have no _right_!” gasped Emily frantically.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Brownell had the “bunch of poetry” in her hands. She turned\r\nand walked up to the platform. Emily followed. Those poems were very\r\ndear to her. She had composed them during the various stormy recesses\r\nwhen it had been impossible to play out of doors and written them down\r\non disreputable scraps of paper borrowed from her mates. She had meant\r\nto take them home that very evening and copy them on letter-bills. And\r\nnow this horrible woman was going to read them to the whole jeering,\r\ngiggling school.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Brownell realized that the time was too short for that.\r\nShe had to content herself with reading over the titles, with some\r\nappropriate comments.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Perry Miller was relieving his feelings by bombarding Rhoda\r\nStuart with spit pills, so craftily timed that Rhoda had no idea from\r\nwhat quarter of the room they were coming and so could not “tell” on\r\nany one. They greatly interfered with her enjoyment of Emily’s scrape,\r\nhowever. As for Teddy Kent, who did not wage war with spit pills but\r\npreferred subtler methods of revenge, he was busy drawing something on\r\na sheet of paper. Rhoda found the sheet on her desk the next morning;\r\non it was depicted a small, scrawny monkey, hanging by its tail from\r\na branch; and the face of the monkey was as the face of Rhoda Stuart.\r\nWhereat Rhoda Stuart waxed wroth, but for the sake of her own vanity\r\ntore the sketch to tatters and kept silence regarding it. She did not\r\nknow that Teddy had made a similar sketch, with Miss Brownell figuring\r\nas a vampirish-looking bat, and thrust it into Emily’s hand as they\r\nleft school.\r\n\r\n“‘The Lost Dimond--a Romantic Tale,’” read Miss Brownell. “‘Lines on\r\na Birch Tree’--looks to me more like lines on a very dirty piece of\r\npaper, Emily--‘Lines Written on a Sundial in our Garden’--ditto--‘Lines\r\nto my Favourite Cat’--another romantic _tail_, I presume--‘Ode to\r\nIlse’--‘Thy neck is of a wondrous pearly sheen’--hardly that, I should\r\nsay. Ilse’s neck is very sunburned--‘A Deskripshun of Our Parlour,’\r\n‘The Violets Spell’--I hope the violet _spells_ better than you do,\r\nEmily--‘The Disappointed House’--\r\n\r\n    “‘Lilies lifted up white cups\r\n    For the bees to _dr--r--i--i--nk_.’”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t write it that way!” cried tortured Emily.\r\n\r\n“‘Lines to a Piece of Brokade in Aunt Laura’s Burow Drawer,’ ‘Farewell\r\non Leaving Home,’ ‘Lines to a Spruce Tree’--‘It keeps off heat and sun\r\nand glare, Tis a goodly tree I ween’--are you quite sure that you know\r\nwhat ‘ween’ means, Emily?--‘Poem on Mr. Tom Bennet’s Field’--‘Poem on\r\nthe Vew from Aunt Elizabeth’s Window’--you are strong on ‘v-e-w-s,’\r\nEmily--‘Epitaff on a Drowned Kitten,’ ‘Meditashuns at the tomb of my\r\ngreat great grandmother’--poor lady--‘To my Northern Birds’--‘Lines\r\ncomposed on the bank of Blair Water gazing at the stars’--h’m--h’m--\r\n\r\n    “‘Crusted with uncounted gems,\r\n    Those stars so distant, cold and true,’\r\n\r\nDon’t try to pass those lines off as your own, Emily. You couldn’t have\r\nwritten them.”\r\n\r\n“I did--I did!” Emily was white with sense of outrage. “And I’ve\r\nwritten lots far better.”\r\n\r\nMiss Brownell suddenly crumpled the ragged little papers up in her hand.\r\n\r\n“We have wasted enough time over this trash,” she said. “Go to your\r\nseat, Emily.”\r\n\r\nShe moved towards the stove. For a moment Emily did not realize\r\nher purpose. Then, as Miss Brownell opened the stove door, Emily\r\nunderstood and bounded forward. She caught at the papers and tore them\r\nfrom Miss Brownell’s hand before the latter could tighten her grasp.\r\n\r\n“You _shall not_ burn them--you shall not have them,” gasped Emily. She\r\ncrammed the poems into the pocket of her “baby apron” and faced Miss\r\nBrownell in a kind of calm rage. The Murray look was on her face--and\r\nalthough Miss Brownell was not so violently affected by it as Aunt\r\nElizabeth had been, it nevertheless gave her an unpleasant sensation,\r\nas of having roused forces with which she dared not tamper further.\r\nThis tormented child looked quite capable of flying at her, tooth and\r\nclaw.\r\n\r\n“Give me those papers, Emily,”--but she said it rather uncertainly.\r\n\r\n“I will not,” said Emily stormily. “They are mine. You have no right to\r\nthem. I wrote them at recesses--I didn’t break any rules. You”--Emily\r\nlooked defiantly into Miss Brownell’s cold eyes--“You are an unjust,\r\ntyrannical _person_.”\r\n\r\nMiss Brownell turned to her desk.\r\n\r\n“I am coming up to New Moon to-night to tell your Aunt Elizabeth of\r\nthis,” she said.\r\n\r\nEmily was at first too much excited over saving her precious poetry to\r\npay much heed to this threat. But as her excitement ebbed cold dread\r\nflowed in. She knew she had an unpleasant time ahead of her. But at all\r\nevents they should not get her poems--not one of them, no matter what\r\nthey did to _her_. As soon as she got home from school she flew to the\r\ngarret and secreted them on the shelf of the old sofa.\r\n\r\nShe wanted terribly to cry but she would not. Miss Brownell was coming\r\nand Miss Brownell should _not_ see her with red eyes. But her heart\r\nburned within her. Some sacred temple of her being had been desecrated\r\nand shamed. And more was yet to come, she felt wretchedly sure. Aunt\r\nElizabeth was certain to side with Miss Brownell. Emily shrank from the\r\nimpending ordeal with all the dread of a sensitive, fine strung nature\r\nfacing humiliation. She would not have been afraid of justice; but she\r\nknew at the bar of Aunt Elizabeth and Miss Brownell she would not have\r\njustice.\r\n\r\n“And I can’t write Father about it,” she thought, her little breast\r\nheaving. The shame of it all was too deep and intimate to be written\r\nout, and so she could find no relief for her pain.\r\n\r\nThey did not have supper at New Moon in winter time until Cousin Jimmy\r\nhad finished his chores and was ready to stay in for the night. So\r\nEmily was left undisturbed in the garret.\r\n\r\nFrom the dormer window she looked down on a dreamland scene that would\r\nordinarily have delighted her. There was a red sunset behind the white,\r\ndistant hills, shining through the dark trees like a great fire; there\r\nwas a delicate blue tracery of bare branch shadows all over the crusted\r\ngarden; there was a pale, ethereal alpenglow all over the southeastern\r\nsky; and presently there was a little, lovely new moon in the silvery\r\narch over Lofty John’s bush. But Emily found no pleasure in any of them.\r\n\r\nPresently she saw Miss Brownell coming up the lane, under the white\r\narms of the birches, with her mannish stride.\r\n\r\n“If my father was alive,” said Emily, looking down at her, “you would\r\ngo away from this place with a flea in your ear.”\r\n\r\nThe minutes passed, each seeming very long to Emily. At last Aunt Laura\r\ncame up.\r\n\r\n“Your Aunt Elizabeth wants you to come down to the kitchen, Emily.”\r\n\r\nAunt Laura’s voice was kind and sad. Emily fought down a sob. She hated\r\nto have Aunt Laura think she had been naughty, but she could not trust\r\nherself to explain. Aunt Laura would sympathize and sympathy would\r\nbreak her down. She went silently down the two long flights of stairs\r\nbefore Aunt Laura and out to the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThe supper table was set and the candles were lighted. The big\r\nblack-raftered kitchen looked spookish and weird, as it always did\r\nby candlelight. Aunt Elizabeth sat rigidly by the table and her face\r\nwas very hard. Miss Brownell sat in the rocking-chair, her pale eyes\r\nglittering with triumphant malice. There seemed something baleful and\r\npoisonous in her very glance. Also, her nose was very red--which did\r\nnot add to her charm.\r\n\r\nCousin Jimmy, in his grey jumper, was perched on the edge of the\r\nwood-box, whistling at the ceiling, and looking more gnome-like than\r\never. Perry was nowhere to be seen. Emily was sorry for this. The\r\npresence of Perry, who was on her side, would have been a great moral\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to say, Emily, that I have been hearing some very bad\r\nthings about your behaviour in school to-day,” said Aunt Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t think you are sorry,” said Emily, gravely.\r\n\r\nNow that the crisis had come she found herself able to confront it\r\ncoolly--nay, more, to take a curious interest in it under all her\r\nsecret fear and shame, as if some part of her had detached itself from\r\nthe rest and was interestedly absorbing impressions and analyzing\r\nmotives and describing settings. She felt that when she wrote about\r\nthis scene later on she must not forget to describe the odd shadows the\r\ncandle under Aunt Elizabeth’s nose cast upward on her face, producing a\r\nrather skeletonic effect. As for Miss Brownell, could _she_ ever have\r\nbeen a baby--a dimpled, fat, laughing baby? The thing was unbelievable.\r\n\r\n“Don’t speak impertinently to _me_,” said Aunt Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n“You see,” said Miss Brownell, significantly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t mean to be impertinent, but you are _not_ sorry,” persisted\r\nEmily. “You are angry because you think I have disgraced New Moon, but\r\nyou are a little glad that you have got some one to agree with you that\r\nI’m bad.”\r\n\r\n“What a _grateful_ child,” said Miss Brownell--flashing her eyes up at\r\nthe ceiling--where they encountered a surprising sight. Perry Miller’s\r\nhead--and no more of him--was stuck down out of the “black hole” and\r\non Perry Miller’s upside-down face was a most disrespectful and impish\r\ngrimace. Face and head disappeared in a flash, leaving Miss Brownell\r\nstaring foolishly at the ceiling.\r\n\r\n“You have been behaving disgracefully in school,” said Aunt Elizabeth,\r\nwho had not seen this by-play. “I am ashamed of you.”\r\n\r\n“It was not as bad as that, Aunt Elizabeth,” said Emily steadily. “You\r\nsee it was this way--”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to hear anything more about it,” said Aunt Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n“But you must,” cried Emily. “It isn’t fair to listen only to _her_\r\nside. I was a little bad--but not so bad as she says--”\r\n\r\n“Not another word! I have heard the whole story,” said Aunt Elizabeth\r\ngrimly.\r\n\r\n“You heard a pack of lies,” said Perry, suddenly sticking his head down\r\nthrough the black hole again.\r\n\r\nEverybody jumped--even Aunt Elizabeth, who at once became angrier than\r\never because she _had_ jumped.\r\n\r\n“Perry Miller, come down out of that loft instantly!” she commanded.\r\n\r\n“Can’t,” said Perry laconically.\r\n\r\n“At once, I say!”\r\n\r\n“Can’t,” repeated Perry, winking audaciously at Miss Brownell.\r\n\r\n“Perry Miller, come down! I _will_ be obeyed. I am mistress here\r\n_yet_.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, all right,” said Perry cheerfully. “If I must.”\r\n\r\nHe swung himself down until his toes touched the ladder. Aunt Laura\r\ngave a little shriek. Everybody else seemed to be stricken dumb.\r\n\r\n“I’ve just got my wet duds off,” Perry was saying cheerfully, waving\r\nhis legs about to get a foothold on the ladder while he hung to the\r\nsides of the black hole with his elbows. “Fell into the brook when I\r\nwas watering the cows. Was going to put on dry ones--but just as you\r\nsay--”\r\n\r\n“Jimmy,” implored poor Elizabeth Murray, surrendering at discretion.\r\n_She_ could not cope with the situation.\r\n\r\n“Perry, get back into that loft and get your clothes on this minute!”\r\nordered Cousin Jimmy.\r\n\r\nThe bare legs shot up and disappeared. There was a chuckle as mirthful\r\nand malicious as an owl’s beyond the black hole. Aunt Elizabeth gave a\r\nconvulsive gasp of relief and turned to Emily. She was determined to\r\nregain ascendancy and Emily must be thoroughly humbled.\r\n\r\n“Emily, kneel down here before Miss Brownell and ask her pardon for\r\nyour conduct to-day,” she said.\r\n\r\nInto Emily’s pale cheek came a scarlet protest. She could not do\r\nthis--she would ask pardon of Miss Brownell but not on her knees. To\r\nkneel to this cruel woman who had hurt her so--she could not--would not\r\ndo it. Her whole nature rose up in protest against such a humiliation.\r\n\r\n“Kneel down,” repeated Aunt Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nMiss Brownell looked pleased and expectant. It would be very satisfying\r\nto see this child who had defied her kneeling before her as a penitent.\r\nNever again, Miss Brownell felt, would Emily be able to look levelly\r\nat her with those dauntless eyes that bespoke a soul untamable and\r\nfree, no matter what punishment might be inflicted upon body or mind.\r\nThe memory of this moment would always be with Emily--she could never\r\nforget that she had knelt in abasement. Emily felt this as clearly as\r\nMiss Brownell did and remained stubbornly on her feet.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Elizabeth, _please_ let me tell my side of the story,” she\r\npleaded.\r\n\r\n“I have heard all I wish to hear of the matter. You will do as I say,\r\nEmily, or you will be outcast in this house until you do. No one will\r\ntalk to you--play with you--eat with you--have anything to do with you\r\nuntil you have obeyed me.”\r\n\r\nEmily shuddered. _That_ was a punishment she could not face. To be cut\r\noff from her world--she knew it would bring her to terms before long.\r\nShe might as well yield at once--but, oh, the bitterness, the shame of\r\nit!\r\n\r\n“A human being should not kneel to any one but God,” said Cousin Jimmy,\r\nunexpectedly, still staring at the ceiling.\r\n\r\nA sudden strange change came over Elizabeth Murray’s proud, angry face.\r\nShe stood very still, looking at Cousin Jimmy--stood so long that Miss\r\nBrownell made a motion of petulant impatience.\r\n\r\n“Emily,” said Aunt Elizabeth in a different tone, “I was wrong--I shall\r\nnot ask you to kneel. But you must apologize to your teacher--and I\r\nshall punish you later on.”\r\n\r\nEmily put her hands behind her and looked straight into Miss Brownell’s\r\neyes again.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry for anything I did to-day that was wrong,” she said, “and I\r\nask your pardon for it.”\r\n\r\nMiss Brownell got on her feet. She felt herself cheated of a legitimate\r\ntriumph. Whatever Emily’s punishment would be she would not have the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing it. She could have shaken “simple Jimmy Murray”\r\nwith a right good will. But it would hardly do to show all she felt.\r\nElizabeth Murray was not a trustee but she was the heaviest ratepayer\r\nin New Moon and had great influence with the School Board.\r\n\r\n“I shall excuse your conduct if you behave yourself in future, Emily,”\r\nshe said coldly. “_I_ feel that I have only done my duty in putting the\r\nmatter before your aunt. No, thank you, Miss Murray, I cannot stay to\r\nsupper--I want to get home before it is too dark.”\r\n\r\n“God speed all travellers,” said Perry cheerfully, climbing down his\r\nladder--this time with his clothes on.\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth ignored him--she was not going to have a scene with a\r\nhired boy before Miss Brownell. The latter switched herself out and\r\nAunt Elizabeth looked at Emily.\r\n\r\n“You will eat your supper alone to-night, Emily, in the pantry--you\r\nwill have bread and milk only. And you will not speak one word to\r\nanyone until to-morrow morning.”\r\n\r\n“But you won’t forbid me to think?” said Emily anxiously.\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth made no reply but sat haughtily down at the supper\r\ntable. Emily went into the pantry and ate her bread and milk, with the\r\nodour of the delicious sausages the others were eating for savour.\r\nEmily liked sausages, and New Moon sausages were the last word in\r\nsausages. Elizabeth Burnley had brought the recipe out from the Old\r\nCountry and its secret was carefully guarded. And Emily was hungry. But\r\nshe had escaped the unbearable, and things might be worse. It suddenly\r\noccurred to her that she would write an epic poem in imitation of _The\r\nLay Of The Last Minstrel_. Cousin Jimmy had read _The Lay_ to her last\r\nSaturday. She would begin the first canto right off. When Laura Murray\r\ncame into the pantry, Emily, her bread and milk only half eaten, was\r\nleaning her elbows on the dresser, gazing into space, with faintly\r\nmoving lips and the light that never was on land or sea in her young\r\neyes. Even the aroma of sausages was forgotten--was she not drinking\r\nfrom a fount of Castaly?\r\n\r\n“Emily,” said Aunt Laura, shutting the door, and looking very lovingly\r\nupon Emily out of her kind blue eyes, “you can talk to _me_ all\r\nyou want to. I don’t like Miss Brownell and I don’t think you were\r\naltogether in the wrong--although of course you shouldn’t be writing\r\npoetry when you have sums to do. And there are some ginger cookies in\r\nthat box.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to talk to any one, dear Aunt Laura--I’m too happy,” said\r\nEmily dreamily. “I’m composing an epic--it is to be called _The White\r\nLady_, and I’ve got twenty lines of it made already--and two of them\r\nare thrilling. The heroine wants to go into a convent and her father\r\nwarns her that if she does she will never be able to\r\n\r\n    Come back to the life you gave\r\n    With all its pleasures to the grave.\r\n\r\nOh, Aunt Laura, when I composed those lines the flash came to me. And\r\nginger cookies are nothing to me any more.”\r\n\r\nAunt Laura smiled again.\r\n\r\n“Not just now perhaps, dear. But when the moment of inspiration has\r\npassed it will do no harm to remember that the cookies in the box have\r\nnot been counted and that they are as much mine as Elizabeth’s.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nLIVING EPISTLES\r\n\r\n\r\n“DEAR FATHER:\r\n\r\n“O, I have such an exiting thing to tell you. I have been the heroin of\r\nan adventure. One day last week Ilse asked me if I would go and stay\r\nall night with her because her father was away and wouldn’t be home\r\ntill very late and Ilse said she wasn’t fritened but very lonesome. So\r\nI asked Aunt Elizabeth if I could. I hardly dared hope, dear Father,\r\nthat she would let me, for she doesn’t aprove of little girls being\r\naway from home at night but to my surprise she said I could go very\r\nkindly. And then I heard her say in the pantry to Aunt Laura It is\r\na shame the way the doctor leaves that poor child so much alone at\r\nnights. It is _wikked_ of him. And Aunt Laura said The poor man is\r\nwarped. You know he was not a bit like that before his wife--and then\r\njust as it was getting intresting Aunt Elizabeth gave Aunt Laura a\r\nnudge and said s-s-s-h, little pitchers have big ears. I knew she meant\r\nme though my ears are not big, only pointed. I do wish I could find out\r\nwhat Ilse’s mother did. It worrys me after I go to bed. I lie awake for\r\never so long thinking about it. Ilse has no idea. Once she asked her\r\nfather and he told her (in a _voice of thunder_) never to mention _that\r\nwoman_ to him again. And there is something else that worrys me too. I\r\nkeep thinking of Silas Lee who killed his brother at the old well. How\r\ndreadful the poor man must have felt. And what is it to be warped.\r\n\r\n“I went over to Ilses and we played in the garret. I like playing there\r\nbecause we dont have to be careful and tidy like we do in our garret.\r\nIlses garret is very untidy and cant have been dusted for years. The\r\nrag room is worse than the rest. It is boarded off at one end of\r\nthe garret and it is full of old close and bags of rags and broken\r\nfurniture. I dont like the smell of it. The kitchen chimney goes up\r\nthrough it and things hang round it (or did). For all this is in the\r\npast now, dear Father.\r\n\r\n“When we got tired playing we sat down on an old chest and talked. This\r\nis splendid in daytime I said but it must be awful queer at night.\r\nMice, said Ilse,--and spiders and gosts. I dont believe in gosts I\r\nsaid skornfully. There isnt any such thing. (But maybe there is for\r\nall that, dear Father.) I believe this garret is hawnted, said Ilse.\r\nThey say garrets always are. Nonsense I said. You know dear Father it\r\nwould not do for a New Moon person to believe in gosts. But I felt\r\nvery queer. Its easy to talk said Ilse beginning to be mad (though I\r\nwasnt trying to run down her garret) but you wouldnt stay here alone at\r\nnight. I wouldnt mind it a bit I said. Then I dare you to do it said\r\nIlse. I dare you to come up here at bedtime and sleep here all night.\r\nThen I saw I was in an awful skrape Father dear. It is a foolish thing\r\nto bost. I knew not what to do. It was dreadful to think of sleeping\r\nalone in that garret but if I didnt Ilse would always cast it up to\r\nme whenever we fought and worse than that she would tell Teddy and he\r\nwould think me a coward. So I said proudly Ill do it Ilse Burnley and\r\nIm not afraid to either. (But oh I was--inside.) The mice will run over\r\nyou said Ilse. O I wouldnt be you for the world. It was mean of Ilse\r\nto make things worse than they were. But I could feel she admired me\r\ntoo and that helped me a great deal. We dragged an old feather bed out\r\nof the rag room and Ilse gave me a pillow and half her close. It was\r\ndark by this time and Ilse wouldnt go up into the garret again. So I\r\nsaid my prayers very carefully and then I took a lamp and started up.\r\nI am so used to candles now that the lamp made me nervus. Ilse said I\r\nlooked scared to death. My knees shook dear Father but for the honnor\r\nof the Starrs (and the Murrays too) I went on. I had undressed in Ilses\r\nroom, so I got right into bed and blew out the lamp. But I couldnt go\r\nto sleep for a long time. The moonlight made the garret look weerd. I\r\ndont know exactly what weerd means but I feel the garret was it. The\r\nbags and old close hanging from the beams looked like creatures. I\r\nthought I need not be fritened. The angels are here. But then I felt\r\nas if I would be as much fritened of angels as of anything else. And\r\nI could hear rats and mice scrambling over things. I thought What if a\r\nrat was to run over me, and then I thought that next day I would write\r\nout a descripshon of the garret by moonlight and my feelings. At last I\r\nheard the doctor driving in and then I heard him knocking round in the\r\nkitchen and I felt better and before very long I went to sleep and I\r\ndreamed a dreadful dream. I dreamed the door of the rag room opened and\r\na big newspaper came out and chased me all around the garret. And then\r\nit went on fire and I could smell the smoke plain as plain and it was\r\njust on me when I skreamed and woke up. I was sitting right up in bed\r\nand the newspaper was gone but I could smell smoke still. I looked at\r\nthe rag room door and smoke was coming out under it and I saw firelight\r\nthrough the cracks of the boards. I just yelled at the top of my voice\r\nand tore down to Ilses room and she rushed across the hall and woke her\r\nfather. He said dam but he got right up and then all three of us kept\r\nrunning up and down the garret stairs with pails of water and we made\r\nan awful mess but we got the fire out. It was just the bags of wool\r\nthat had been hanging close to the chimney that had caught fire. When\r\nall was over the doctor wiped the persperation from his manly brow and\r\nsaid That was a close call. A few minutes later would have been too\r\nlate. I put on a fire when I came in to make a cup of tea and I suppose\r\nthose bags must have caught fire from a spark. I see theres a hole\r\nhere where the plaster has tumbled out. I must have this whole place\r\ncleaned out. How in the world did you come to diskover the fire, Emily.\r\nI was sleeping in the garret I said. Sleeping in the garret said the\r\ndoctor, what in--what the--_what_ were you doing there. Ilse dared me I\r\nsaid. She said Id be too scared to stay there and I said I wouldnt. I\r\nfell asleep and woke up and smelled smoke. You little devil, said the\r\ndoctor. I suppose it was a dreadful thing to be called a devil but\r\nthe doctor looked at me so admiringly that I felt as if he was paying\r\nme a compelment. He has queer ways of talking. Ilse says the only time\r\nhe ever said a kind thing to her was once when she had a sore throat\r\nhe called her “a poor little animal” and looked as if he was sorry for\r\nher. I feel sure Ilse feels dreadfully bad because her father doesnt\r\nlike her though she pretends she does not care. But oh dear Father\r\nthere is more to tell. Yesterday the Shrewsbury _Weekly Times_ came\r\nand in the Blair Notes it told all about the fire at the doctors and\r\nsaid it had been fortunately diskovered in time by Miss Emily Starr. I\r\ncant tell you what I felt like when I saw my name in the paper. I felt\r\n_famus_. And I never was called Miss in ernest before.\r\n\r\n“Last Saturday Aunt Elizabeth and Aunt Laura went to Shrewsbury for\r\nthe day and left Cousin Jimmy and me to keep house. We had such fun\r\nand Cousin Jimmy let me skim all the milk pans. But after dinner\r\nunexpekted company came and there was no cake in the house. That was\r\na dreadful thing. It never happened before in the annels of New Moon.\r\nAunt Elizabeth had toothache all day yesterday and Aunt Laura was away\r\nat Priest Pond visiting Great Aunt Nancy, so no cake was made. I prayed\r\nabout it and then I went to work and made a cake by Aunt Laura’s receet\r\nand it turned out all right. Cousin Jimmy helped me set the table and\r\nget supper, and I poured the tea and never slopped any over in the\r\nsaucers. You would have been proud of me Father. Mrs. Lewis took a\r\nsecond piece of cake and said I would know Elizabeth Murrays cake if\r\nI found it in central Africa. I said not a word for the honnor of the\r\nfamily. But I felt very proud. I had saved the Murrays from disgrace.\r\nWhen Aunt Elizabeth came home and heard the tale she looked grim and\r\ntasted a piece that was left and then she said Well, you have got\r\n_some_ Murray in you anyway. That is the first time Aunt Elizabeth has\r\never praised me. She had three teeth out so they will not ache any\r\nmore. I am glad for her sake. Before I went to bed I got the cook book\r\nand picked out all the things Id like to make. Queen Pudding, Sea-foam\r\nSauce, Blackeyed Susans, Pigs In Blankets. They sound just lovely.\r\n\r\n“I can see such beautiful fluffy white clouds over Lofty Johns bush.\r\nI wish I could sore up and drop right into them. I cant believe they\r\nwould be wet and messy like Teddy says. Teddy cut my initials and his\r\ntogether on the Monark of The Forest but somebody has cut them out. I\r\ndon’t know whether it was Perry or Ilse.\r\n\r\n“Miss Brownell hardly ever gives me good deportment marks now and\r\nAunt Elizabeth is much displeased on Friday nights but Aunt Laura\r\nunderstands. I wrote an account of the afternoon when Miss Brownell\r\nmade fun of my poems and put it in an old envelope and wrote Aunt\r\nElizabeths name on it and put it among my papers. If I die of\r\nconsumption Aunt Elizabeth will find it and know the rites of it and\r\nmourn that she was so unjust to me. But I don’t think I will die\r\nbecause Im getting much fatter and Ilse told me she heard her father\r\ntell Aunt Laura I would be handsome if I had more color. Is it wrong to\r\nwant to be handsome, dearest Father. Aunt Elizabeth says it is and when\r\nI said to her Wouldn’t _you_ like to be handsome, Aunt Elizabeth, she\r\nseemed anoyed about something.\r\n\r\n“Miss Brownell has had a spite at Perry ever since that evening and\r\ntreats him very mean but he is meek and says he wont kick up any fuss\r\nin school because he wants to learn and get ahead. He keeps saying his\r\nrymes are as good as mine and I know they are not and it exassperates\r\nme. If I do not pay attention all the time in school Miss Brownell says\r\nI suppose you are composing--poetry Emily and then everybody laughs.\r\nNo not everybody. I must not exagerate. Teddy and Perry and Ilse and\r\nJennie never laugh. It is funny that I like Jennie so well now and I\r\nhated her so that first day in school. Her eyes are not piggy after\r\nall. They are small but they are jolly and twinkly. She is quite poplar\r\nin school. I do hate Frank Barker. He took my new reader and wrote in a\r\nbig sprawly way all over the front page\r\n\r\n    Steal not this book for fear of shame\r\n    For on it is the owners name\r\n    And when you die the Lord will say\r\n    Where is that book you stole away\r\n    And when you say you do not know\r\n    The Lord will say go down below.\r\n\r\n“That is not a refined poem and besides it is not the rite way to speak\r\nabout God. I tore out the leaf and burned it and Aunt Elizabeth was\r\nangry and even when I explained why her rath was not apeased. Ilse says\r\nshe is going to call God Alla after this. I think it is a nicer name\r\nmyself. It is so soft and doesn’t sound so stern. But I fear its not\r\nrelijus enough.\r\n\r\n                                            “MAY 20.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday was my birthday dear Father. It will soon be a year since I\r\ncame to New Moon. I feel as if I had always lived here. I have grown\r\ntwo inches. Cousin Jimmy measured me by a mark on the dairy door. My\r\nbirthday was very nice. Aunt Laura made a lovely cake and gave me a\r\nbeautiful new white pettycoat with an embroidered flounce. She had run\r\na blue ribbon through it but Aunt Elizabeth made her pull it out. And\r\nAunt Laura also gave me that piece of pink satin brokade in her burow\r\ndrawer. I have longed for it ever since I saw it but never hoped to\r\npossess it. Ilse asked me what I meant to do with it but I dont mean\r\nto do anything with it. Only keep it up here in the garret with my\r\ntreasures and look at it, because it is beautiful. Aunt Elizabeth gave\r\nme a dixonary. That was a useful present. I feel I ought to like it.\r\nYou will soon notice an improovement in my spelling, I hope. The only\r\ntrouble is when I am writing something interesting I get so exited\r\nit is just awful to have to stop and hunt up a word to see how it is\r\nspelled. I looked up ween in it and Miss Brownell was right. I did not\r\nknow what it really meant. It rymed so well with sheen and I thought it\r\nmeant to behold or see but it means to think. Cousin Jimmy gave me a\r\nbig thick blank book. I am so proud of it. It will be so nice to write\r\npieces in. But I will still use the letter-bills to write to you, dear\r\nFather, because I can fold each one up by itself and adress it like a\r\nreal letter. Teddy gave me a picture of myself. He painted it in water\r\ncolors and called it The Smiling Girl. I look as if I was listening\r\nto something that made me very happy. Ilse says it flatters me. It\r\ndoes make me better looking than I am but not any better looking than\r\nI would be if I could have a bang. Teddy says he is going to paint a\r\nreal big picture of me when he grows up. Perry walked all the way to\r\nShrewsbury to get me a necklace of pearl beads and lost it. He had no\r\nmore money so he went home to Stovepipe Town and got a young hen from\r\nhis Aunt Tom and gave me that. He is a very persistent boy. I am to\r\nhave all the eggs the hen lays to sell the pedler for myself. Ilse gave\r\nme a box of candy. I am only going to eat one piece a day to make it\r\nlast a long time. I wanted Ilse to eat some but she said she wouldnt\r\nbecause it would be mean to help eat a present you had given and I\r\ninsisted and then we fought over it and Ilse said I was a caterwawling\r\nquadruped (which was ridiklus) and didn’t know enough to come in when\r\nit rained. And I said I knew enough to have some manners at least. Ilse\r\ngot so mad she went home but she cooled off soon and came back for\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\n“It is raining tonight and it sounds like fairies feet dancing over\r\nthe garret roof. If it had not rained Teddy was going to come down and\r\nhelp me look for the Lost Dimond. Wouldnt it be splendid if we could\r\nfind it.\r\n\r\n“Cousin Jimmy is fixing up the garden. He lets me help him and I have a\r\nlittle flower bed of my own. I always run out first thing every morning\r\nto see how much the things have grown since yesterday. Spring is such\r\na happyfying time isnt it, Father. The little Blue People are all out\r\nround the summer house. That is what Cousin Jimmy calls the violets and\r\nI think it is lovely. He has names like that for all the flowers. The\r\nroses are the Queens and the June lilies are the Snow Ladies and the\r\ntulips are the Gay Folk and the daffodils are the Golden Ones and the\r\nChina Asters are My Pink Friends.\r\n\r\n“Mike II is here with me, sitting on the window-sill. Mike is a smee\r\ncat. Smee is not in the dictionary. It is a word I invented myself. I\r\ncould not think of any English word which just describes Mike II so I\r\nmade this up. It means sleek and glossy and soft and fluffy all in one\r\nand something else besides that I cant express.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Laura is teaching me to sew. She says I must learn to make a hem\r\non muslin that can’t be seen (tradishun). I hope she will teach me how\r\nto make point lace some day. All the Murrays of New Moon have been\r\nnoted for making point lace (I mean all the women Murrays). None of the\r\ngirls in school can make point lace. Aunt Laura says she will make me\r\na point lace hangkerchief when I get married. All the New Moon brides\r\nhad point lace hangkerchiefs except my mother who ran away. But you\r\ndidnt mind her not having one did you Father. Aunt Laura talks a good\r\nbit about my mother to me but not when Aunt Elizabeth is around. Aunt\r\nElizabeth never mentions her name. Aunt Laura wants to show me Mothers\r\nroom but she has never been able to find the key yet because Aunt\r\nElizabeth keeps it hid. Aunt Laura says Aunt Elizabeth loved my mother\r\nvery much. You would think she would love her daughter some wouldnt\r\nyou. But she doesnt. She is just bringing me up as a duty.\r\n\r\n                                            “JUNE 1.\r\n\r\n“DEAR FATHER:\r\n\r\n“This has been a very important day. I wrote my first letter, I\r\nmean the first letter that was really to go in the mail. It was to\r\nGreat-Aunt Nancy who lives at Priest Pond and is very old. She wrote\r\nAunt Elizabeth and said I might write now and then to a poor old woman.\r\nMy heart was touched and I wanted to. Aunt Elizabeth said We might as\r\nwell let her. And she said to me You must be careful to write a nice\r\nletter and I will read it over when it is written. If you make a good\r\nimpression on Aunt Nancy she may do something for you. I wrote the\r\nletter very carefully but it didn’t sound a bit like me when it was\r\nfinished. I couldn’t write a good letter when I knew Aunt Elizabeth was\r\ngoing to read it. I felt paralized.\r\n\r\n                                            “JUNE 7.\r\n\r\n“Dear Father, my letter did not make a good impression on Great-Aunt\r\nNancy. She did not answer it but she wrote Aunt Elizabeth that I must\r\nbe a very stupid child to write such a stupid letter. I feel insulted\r\nbecause I am not stupid. Perry says he feels like going to Priest Pond\r\nand knocking the daylights out of Great-Aunt Nancy. I told him he must\r\nnot talk like that about my family, and anyhow I dont see how knocking\r\nthe daylights out of Great-Aunt Nancy would make her change her opinion\r\nabout me being stupid. (I wonder what daylights are and how you knock\r\nthem out of people.)\r\n\r\n“I have three cantos of _The White Lady_ finished. I have the heroin\r\nimured in a convent and I dont know how to get her out because I\r\nam not a Catholic. I suppose it would have been better if I had\r\na Protestant heroin but there were no Protestants in the days of\r\nshivalry. I might have asked Lofty John last year but this year I cant\r\nbecause Ive never spoken to him since he played that horrid joke on\r\nme about the apple. When I meet him on the road I look straight ahead\r\njust as lofty as he does. I have called my pig after him to get square.\r\nCousin Jimmy has given me a little pig for my own. When it is sold I\r\nam to have the money. I mean to give some for missionaries and put the\r\nrest in the bank to go to my educashun. And I thought if I ever had\r\na pig I would call it Uncle Wallace. But now it does not seem to me\r\npropper to call pigs after your uncles even if you dont like them.\r\n\r\n“Teddy and Perry and Ilse and I play we are living in the days of\r\nshivalry and Ilse and I are distressed damsels reskued by galant\r\nknites. Teddy made a splendid suit of armor out of old barrel staves\r\nand then Perry made a better one out of old tin boilers hammered flat\r\nwith a broken saucepan for a helmit. Sometimes we play at the Tansy\r\nPatch. I have a queer feeling that Teddys mother hates me this summer.\r\nLast summer she just didnt like me. Smoke and Buttercup are not there\r\nnow. They disappeared misteriously in the winter. Teddy says he feels\r\nsure his mother poisoned them because she thought he was getting too\r\nfond of them. Teddy is teaching me to whistle but Aunt Laura says it\r\nis unladylike. So many jolly things seem to be unladylike. Sometimes I\r\nalmost wish my aunts were infidels like Dr. Burnly. _He_ never bothers\r\nwhether Ilse is unladylike or not. But no, it would not be good manners\r\nto be an infidel. It would not be a New Moon tradishun.\r\n\r\n“Today I taught Perry that he must not eat with his knife. He wants\r\nto learn all the _rules of etiket_. And I am helping him learn a\r\nrecitation for school examination day. I wanted Ilse to do it but she\r\nwas mad because he asked me first and she wouldnt. But she should\r\nbecause she is a far better reciter than I am. I am too nervus.\r\n\r\n                                           “JUNE 14.\r\n\r\n“Dear Father, we have composition in school now and I learned today\r\nthat you put in things like this “ ” when you write anything anybody\r\nhas said. I didnt know that before. I must go over all my letters to\r\nyou and put them in. And after a question you must put a mark like this\r\n? and when a letter is left out a postroffe which is a comma up in\r\nthe air. Miss Brownell is sarkastic but she _does_ teach you things.\r\nI am putting that down because I want to be fair even if I do hate\r\nher. And she is interesting although she is not nice. I have written\r\na descripshun of her on a letter-bill. I like writing about people I\r\ndon’t like better than about those I do like. Aunt Laura is nicer to\r\nlive with than Aunt Elizabeth, but Aunt Elizabeth is nicer to write\r\nabout. I can deskribe _her_ fawlts but I feel wikked and ungrateful if\r\nI say anything that is not compelmentary about dear Aunt Laura. Aunt\r\nElizabeth has locked your books away and says I’m not to have them till\r\nI’m grown up. Just as if I wouldn’t be careful of them, dear Father.\r\nShe says I wouldn’t because she found that when I was reading one of\r\nthem I put a tiny pencil dot under every beautiful word. It didn’t hurt\r\nthe book a bit, dear Father. Some of the words were dingles, pearled,\r\nmusk, dappled, intervales, glen, bosky, piping, shimmer, crisp,\r\nbeechen, ivory. I think those are all lovely words, Father.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Laura lets me read her copy of A Pilgrims Progress on Sundays. I\r\ncall the big hill in the road to White Cross the Delectable Mountain\r\nbecause it is such a beautiful one.\r\n\r\n“Teddy lent me 3 books of poetry. One of them was Tennyson and I have\r\nlearned The Bugle Song off by heart so I will always have it. One was\r\nMrs. Browning. She is lovely. I would like to meet her. I suppose I\r\nwill when I die but that may be a long time away. The other was just\r\none poem called Sohrab and Rustum. After I went to bed I cried over\r\nit. Aunt Elizabeth said “what are you sniffling about?” I wasn’t\r\nsniffling--I was weeping sore. She made me tell her and then she said\r\n“You must be crazy.” But I couldn’t go to sleep until I had thought out\r\na different end for it--a happy one.\r\n\r\n                                           “JUNE 25.\r\n\r\n“DEAR FATHER:\r\n\r\n“There has been a dark shadow over this day. I dropped my cent in\r\nchurch. It made a dreadful noise. I felt as if everybody looked at me.\r\nAunt Elizabeth was much annoyed. Perry dropped his too soon after. He\r\ntold me after church he did it on purpose because he thought it would\r\nmake me feel better but it didn’t because I was afraid the people\r\nwould think it was me dropping mine again. Boys do such queer things.\r\nI hope the minister did not hear because I am beginning to like him. I\r\nnever liked him much before last Tuesday. His family are all boys and\r\nI suppose he doesn’t understand little girls very well. Then he called\r\nat New Moon. Aunt Laura and Aunt Elizabeth were both away and I was in\r\nthe kitchen alone. Mr. Dare came in and sat down on Saucy Sal who was\r\nasleep in the rocking-chair. He was comfortable but Saucy Sal wasn’t.\r\nHe didn’t sit on her stomach. If he had I suppose he would have killed\r\nher. He just sat on her legs and tail. Sal yowled but Mr. Dare is a\r\nlittle deaf and didn’t hear her and I was too shy to tell him. But\r\nCousin Jimmy came in just as he was asking me if I knew my catechism\r\nand said “Catechism, is it? Lawful heart, man, listen to that poor\r\ndum beast. Get up if you’re a Christian.” So Mr. Dare got up and said,\r\n“Dear me, this is very remarkable. I thought I felt something moving.”\r\n\r\n“I thought I would write this to you, dear Father, because it struck me\r\nas humerus.\r\n\r\n“When Mr. Dare finished asking me questions I thought it was my turn\r\nand I would ask him some about some things I’ve wanted to know for\r\nyears. I asked him if he thought God was very perticular about every\r\nlittle thing I did and if he thought my cats would go to heaven. He\r\nsaid he hoped I never did wrong things and that animals had no souls.\r\nAnd I asked him why we shouldn’t put new wine in old bottles. Aunt\r\nElizabeth does with her dandelion wine and the old bottles do just as\r\nwell as new ones. He explained quite kindly that the Bible bottles were\r\nmade of skins and got rotten when they were old. It made it quite clear\r\nto me. Then I told him I was worried because I knew I ought to love God\r\nbetter than anything but there were things I loved better than God. He\r\nsaid “What things?” and I said flowers and stars and the Wind Woman\r\nand the Three Princesses and things like that. And he smiled and said\r\n“But they are just a part of God, Emily--every beautiful thing is.” And\r\nall at once I liked him ever so much and didn’t feel shy with him any\r\nmore. He preeched a sermon on heaven last Sunday. It seemed like a dull\r\nplace. I think it must be more exiting than that. I wonder what I will\r\ndo when I go to heaven since I cant sing. I wonder if they will let me\r\nwrite poetry. But I think church is interesting. Aunt Elizabeth and\r\nAunt Laura always read their Bibles before the servis begins but I like\r\nto stare around and see everybody and wonder what they are thinking of.\r\nIt’s so nice to hear the silk dresses swishing up the isles. Bustles\r\nare very fashunable now but Aunt Elizabeth will not wear them. I think\r\nAunt Elizabeth _would_ look funny with a bustle. Aunt Laura wears a\r\nvery little one.\r\n\r\n                       “Your lovingest daughter,\r\n                                  “_Emily B. Starr_.\r\n\r\n“P. S. Dear Father, it is lovely to write to you. But O, I never get an\r\nanswer back.\r\n\r\n                                        “_E. B. S._”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nFATHER CASSIDY\r\n\r\n\r\nConsternation reigned at New Moon. Everybody was desperately unhappy.\r\nAunt Laura cried. Aunt Elizabeth was so cantankerous that there was no\r\nliving with her. Cousin Jimmy went about as one distracted and Emily\r\ngave up worrying about Ilse’s mother and Silas Lee’s remorseful ghost\r\nafter she went to bed, and worried over this new trouble. For it had\r\nall originated in her disregard of New Moon tradition in making calls\r\non Lofty John, and Aunt Elizabeth did not mince matters in telling her\r\nso. If she, Emily Byrd Starr, had never gone to Lofty John’s she would\r\nnever have eaten the Big Sweet apple, and if she had never eaten the\r\nBig Sweet apple Lofty John would not have played a joke on her and if\r\nhe had not played a joke on her Aunt Elizabeth would never have gone\r\nand said bitter, Murray-like things to him; and if Aunt Elizabeth\r\nhad never said bitter Murray-like things to him Lofty John would not\r\nhave become offended and revengeful; and if Lofty John had not become\r\noffended and revengeful he would never have taken it into his lofty\r\nhead to cut down the beautiful grove to the north of New Moon.\r\n\r\nFor this was exactly where this house-that-Jack-built progression had\r\nlanded them all. Lofty John had announced publicly in the Blair Water\r\nblacksmith shop that he was going to cut down the bush as soon as\r\nharvest was over--every last tree and sapling was to be laid low. The\r\nnews was promptly carried to New Moon and upset the inhabitants thereof\r\nas they had not been upset for years. In their eyes it was nothing\r\nshort of a catastrophe.\r\n\r\nElizabeth and Laura could hardly bring themselves to believe it. The\r\nthing was incredible. That big, thick, protecting bush of spruce and\r\nhardwood had _always_ been there; it belonged to New Moon _morally_;\r\neven Lofty John Sullivan would not _dare_ to cut it down. But Lofty\r\nJohn had an uncomfortable reputation for doing what he said he would\r\ndo; that was a part of his loftiness; and if he did--if he did--\r\n\r\n“New Moon will be ruined,” wailed poor Aunt Laura. “It will look\r\n_dreadful_--_all_ its beauty will go--and we will be left open to\r\nthe north wind and the sea storms--we have always been so warm and\r\nsheltered here. And Jimmy’s garden will be ruined too.”\r\n\r\n“This is what comes of bringing Emily here,” said Aunt Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nIt was a cruel thing to say, even when all allowances were made,--cruel\r\nand unjust, since her own sharp tongue and Murray sarcasm had had quite\r\nas much to do with it as Emily. But she said it and it pierced Emily to\r\nthe heart with a pang that left a scar for years. Poor Emily did not\r\nfeel as if she needed any additional anguish. She was already feeling\r\nso wretched that she could not eat or sleep. Elizabeth Murray, angry\r\nand unhappy as she was, slept soundly at nights; but beside her in the\r\ndarkness, afraid to move or turn, lay a slender little creature whose\r\ntears, stealing silently down her cheeks, could not ease her breaking\r\nheart. For Emily thought her heart _was_ breaking; she couldn’t go on\r\nliving and suffering like this. Nobody could.\r\n\r\nEmily had lived long enough at New Moon for it to get pretty thoroughly\r\ninto her blood. Perhaps it had even been born there. At any rate,\r\nwhen she came to it she fitted into its atmosphere as a hand into a\r\nglove. She loved it as well as if she had lived there all her short\r\nlife--loved every stick and stone and tree and blade of grass about\r\nit--every nail in the old kitchen floor, every cushion of green moss\r\non the dairy roof, every pink and white columbine that grew in the\r\nold orchard, every “tradition” of its history. To think of its beauty\r\nbeing in a large measure reft from it was agony to her. And to think\r\nof Cousin Jimmy’s garden being ruined! Emily loved that garden almost\r\nas much as he did; why, it was the pride of Cousin Jimmy’s life that\r\nhe could grow there plants and shrubs that would winter nowhere else\r\nin P. E. Island; if the northern shelter were removed they would die.\r\nAnd to think of that beautiful bush itself being cut down--the Today\r\nRoad and the Yesterday Road and the Tomorrow Road being swept out of\r\nexistence--the stately Monarch of the Forest discrowned--the little\r\nplayhouse where she and Ilse had such glorious hours destroyed--the\r\nwhole lovely, ferny, intimate place torn out of her life at one fell\r\nswoop.\r\n\r\nOh, Lofty John had chosen and timed his vengeance well!\r\n\r\nWhen would the blow fall? Every morning Emily listened miserably as\r\nshe stood on the sandstone doorstep of the kitchen, for the sound of\r\naxe blows on the clear September air. Every evening when she returned\r\nfrom school she dreaded to see that the work of destruction had\r\nbegun. She pined and fretted. There were times when it seemed to her\r\nshe couldn’t bear her life any longer. Every day Aunt Elizabeth said\r\nsomething imputing the whole blame to her and the child grew morbidly\r\nsensitive about it. Almost she wished Lofty John would begin and be\r\ndone with it. If Emily had ever heard the classic story of Damocles\r\nshe would have heartily sympathized with him. If she had had any hope\r\nthat it would do any good she would have swallowed Murray pride and\r\nStarr pride and every other kind of pride and gone on her knees to\r\nLofty John to entreat him to hold his revengeful hand. But she believed\r\nit would not. Lofty John had left no doubt in anybody’s mind as to\r\nhis bitter determination in the matter. There was much talk about it\r\nin Blair Water and some were very well pleased at this blow to New\r\nMoon pride and prestige, and some held that it was low and unclean\r\nbehaviour on Lofty John’s part, and all agreed that this was what\r\nthey had prophesied all along as bound to happen some day when the\r\nold Murray-Sullivan feud of three generations should have come to its\r\ninevitable head. The only surprising thing was that Lofty John hadn’t\r\ndone it long ago. He had always hated Elizabeth Murray since their\r\nschooldays, when her tongue had not spared him.\r\n\r\nOne day by the banks of Blair Water Emily sat down and wept. She had\r\nbeen sent to trim the dead blossoms off the rosebushes on Grandmother\r\nMurray’s grave; having finished her task she had not the heart to go\r\nback to the house where Aunt Elizabeth was making everybody miserable\r\nbecause she was herself so unhappy. Perry had reported that Lofty John\r\nhad stated the day before at the blacksmith’s that he was going to\r\nbegin cutting down the big bush on Monday morning.\r\n\r\n“I _can’t_ bear it,” sobbed Emily to the rosebushes.\r\n\r\nA few late roses nodded at her; the Wind Woman combed and waved and\r\nstirred the long green grasses on the graves where proud Murrays, men\r\nand women, slept calmly, unstirred by old feuds and passions; the\r\nSeptember sunlight shone beyond on old harvest fields mellowly bright\r\nand serene, and very softly against its green, shrub-hung bank, purred\r\nand lapped the blue Blair Water.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see why God doesn’t _stop_ Lofty John,” said Emily\r\npassionately. Surely the New Moon Murrays had a right to expect that\r\nmuch from Providence.\r\n\r\nTeddy came whistling down the pasture, the notes of his tune blowing\r\nacross the Blair Water like elfin drops of sound, vaulted the graveyard\r\nfence and perched his lean, graceful body irreverently on the “Here I\r\nstay” of Great-Grandmother Murray’s flat tombstone.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Everything’s the matter,” said Emily, a little crossly. Teddy had no\r\nbusiness to be looking so cheerful. She was used to more sympathy from\r\nTeddy and it aggravated her not to find it. “Don’t you know Lofty John\r\nis going to begin cutting down the bush Monday?”\r\n\r\nTeddy nodded.\r\n\r\n“Yep. Ilse told me. But look here, Emily, I’ve thought of something.\r\nLofty John wouldn’t dare cut down that bush if the priest told him not\r\nto, would he?”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because the Catholics have to do just what their priests tell them to,\r\nhaven’t they?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know--I don’t know anything about them. _We_ are\r\nPresbyterians.”\r\n\r\nEmily gave her head a little toss. Mrs. Kent was known to be an\r\n“English Church” woman and though Teddy went to the Presbyterian Sunday\r\nSchool, that fact gave him scanty standing among bred-in-the-bone\r\nPresbyterian circles.\r\n\r\n“If your Aunt Elizabeth went to Father Cassidy at White Cross and asked\r\nhim to stop Lofty John, maybe he’d do it,” persisted Teddy.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Elizabeth would never do that,” said Emily positively. “I’m sure\r\nof it. She’s too proud.”\r\n\r\n“Not even to save the bush?”\r\n\r\n“Not even for that.”\r\n\r\n“Then I guess nothing can be done,” said Teddy rather crest-fallen.\r\n“Look here--see what I’ve made. This is a picture of Lofty John in\r\npurgatory, with three little devils sticking red-hot pitch forks\r\ninto him. I copied some of it out of one of mother’s books--Dante’s\r\nInfernal, I think it was--but I put Lofty John in place of the man in\r\nthe book. You can have it.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want it.” Emily uncoiled her legs and got up. She was past the\r\nstage when inflicting imaginary torments on Lofty John could comfort\r\nher. She had already slain him in several agonizing ways during her\r\nnight vigils. But an idea had come to her--a daring, breathless idea.\r\n“I must go home now, Teddy--it’s supper time.”\r\n\r\nTeddy pocketed his despised sketch--which was really a wonderful bit\r\nof work if either of them had had the sense to know it; the expression\r\nof anguish in Lofty John’s face as a merry little devil touched him\r\nup with a pitchfork would have been the despair of many a trained\r\nartist. He went home wishing he could help Emily; it was all wrong\r\nthat a creature like Emily--with soft purple-gray eyes and a smile\r\nthat made you think of all sorts of wonderful things you couldn’t put\r\ninto words--should be unhappy. Teddy felt so worried about it that he\r\nadded a few more devils to his sketch of Lofty John in purgatory and\r\nlengthened the prongs of their pitchforks quite considerably.\r\n\r\nEmily went home with a determined twist to her mouth. She ate as much\r\nsupper as she could--which wasn’t much, for Aunt Elizabeth’s face would\r\nhave destroyed her appetite if she had had any--and then sneaked out\r\nof the house by the front door. Cousin Jimmy was working in his garden\r\nbut he did not call her. Cousin Jimmy was always very sorrowful now.\r\nEmily stood a moment on the Grecian porch and looked at Lofty John’s\r\nbush--green-bosomed, waving, all lovely. Would it be a desecrated waste\r\nof stumps by Monday night? Goaded by the thought Emily cast fear and\r\nhesitation to the winds and started briskly off down the lane. When she\r\nreached the gate she turned to the left on the long red road of mystery\r\nthat ran up the Delectable Mountain. She had never been on that road\r\nbefore; it ran straight to White Cross; Emily was going to the parish\r\nhouse there to interview Father Cassidy. It was two miles to White\r\nCross and Emily walked it all too soon--not because it was a beautiful\r\nroad of wind and wild fern, haunted by little rabbits--but because she\r\ndreaded what awaited her at the end. She had been trying to think what\r\nshe should say--how she should say it; but her invention failed her.\r\nShe had no acquaintance with Catholic priests, and couldn’t imagine\r\nhow you should talk to them at all. They were even more mysterious and\r\nunknowable than ministers. Suppose Father Cassidy should be dreadfully\r\nangry at her daring to come there and ask a favour. Perhaps it _was_ a\r\ndreadful thing to do from every point of view. And very likely it would\r\ndo no good. Very likely Father Cassidy would refuse to interfere with\r\nLofty John, who was a good Catholic, while she was, in his opinion,\r\na heretic. But for any chance, even the faintest, of averting the\r\ncalamity impending over New Moon, Emily would have faced the entire\r\nSacred College. Horribly frightened, miserably nervous as she was, the\r\nidea of turning back never occurred to her. She was only sorry that\r\nshe hadn’t put on her Venetian beads. They might have impressed Father\r\nCassidy.\r\n\r\nAlthough Emily had never been to White Cross she knew the parish house\r\nwhen she saw it--a fine, tree-embowered residence near the big white\r\nchapel with the flashing gilt cross on its spire and the four gilt\r\nangels, one on each of the little spires at the corners. Emily thought\r\nthem very beautiful as they gleamed in the light of the lowering sun,\r\nand wished they could have some on the plain white church at Blair\r\nWater. She couldn’t understand why Catholics should have all the\r\nangels. But there was not time to puzzle over this, for the door was\r\nopening and the trim little maid was looking a question.\r\n\r\n“Is--Father Cassidy--at--home?” asked Emily, rather jerkily.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Can--I--see--him?”\r\n\r\n“Come in,” said the little maid. Evidently there was no difficulty\r\nabout seeing Father Cassidy--no mysterious ceremonies such as Emily\r\nhad half expected, even if she were allowed to see him at all. She was\r\nshown into a book-lined room and left there, while the maid went to\r\ncall Father Cassidy, who, she said, was working in the garden. _That_\r\nsounded quite natural and encouraging. If Father Cassidy worked in a\r\ngarden, he could not be so very terrible.\r\n\r\nEmily looked about her curiously. She was in a very pretty room--with\r\ncosy chairs, and pictures and flowers. Nothing alarming or uncanny\r\nabout it--except a huge black cat who was sitting on the top of one of\r\nthe bookcases. It was really an enormous creature. Emily adored cats\r\nand had always felt at home with any of them. But she had never seen\r\nsuch a cat as this. What with its size and its insolent, gold-hued\r\neyes, set like living jewels in its black velvet face, it did not seem\r\nto belong to the same species as nice, cuddly, respectable kittens at\r\nall. Mr. Dare would never have had such a beast about his manse. All\r\nEmily’s dread of Father Cassidy returned.\r\n\r\nAnd then in came Father Cassidy, with the friendliest smile in the\r\nworld. Emily took him in with her level glance as was her habit--or\r\ngift--and never again in the world was she the least bit afraid of\r\nFather Cassidy. He was big and broad-shouldered, with brown eyes and\r\nbrown hair; and his very face was so deeply tanned from his inveterate\r\nhabit of going about bareheaded in merciless sunshine, that it was\r\nbrown, too. Emily thought he looked just like a big nut--a big, brown,\r\nwholesome nut.\r\n\r\nFather Cassidy looked at her as he shook hands; Emily had one of her\r\nvisitations of beauty just then. Excitement had brought a wildrose\r\nhue to her face, the sunlight brought out the watered-silk gloss of\r\nher black hair; her eyes were softly dark and limpid; but it was at\r\nher ears Father Cassidy suddenly bent to look. Emily had a moment of\r\nagonized wonder if they were clean.\r\n\r\n“She’s got pointed ears,” said Father Cassidy, in a thrilling whisper.\r\n“Pointed ears! I _knew_ she came straight from fairyland the minute\r\nI saw her. Sit down, Elf--if elves do sit--sit down and give me the\r\nlatest news av Titania’s court.”\r\n\r\nEmily’s foot was now on her native heath. Father Cassidy talked her\r\nlanguage, and he talked it in such a mellow, throaty voice, slurring\r\nhis “ofs” ever so softly as became a proper Irishman. But she shook\r\nher head a little sadly. With the burden of her errand on her soul she\r\ncould not play the part of ambassadress from Elfland.\r\n\r\n“I’m only Emily Starr of New Moon,” she said; and then gasped\r\nhurriedly, because there must be no deception--no sailing under false\r\ncolours, “and I’m a Protestant.”\r\n\r\n“And a very nice little Protestant you are,” said Father Cassidy. “But\r\nfor sure I’m a bit disappointed. I’m used to Protestants--the woods\r\nhereabouts being full av them--but it’s a hundred years since the last\r\nelf called on me.”\r\n\r\nEmily stared. Surely Father Cassidy wasn’t a hundred years old. He\r\ndidn’t look more than fifty. Perhaps, though, Catholic priests did live\r\nlonger than other people. She didn’t know exactly what to say so she\r\nsaid, a bit lamely,\r\n\r\n“I see you have a cat.”\r\n\r\n“Wrong.” Father Cassidy shook his head and groaned dismally. “A cat has\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nEmily gave up trying to understand Father Cassidy. He was nice but\r\nununderstandable. She let it go at that. And she must get on with her\r\nerrand.\r\n\r\n“You are a kind of minister, aren’t you?” she asked timidly. She\r\ndidn’t know whether Father Cassidy would like being called a minister.\r\n\r\n“Kind av,” he agreed amiably. “And you see ministers and priests can’t\r\ndo their own swearing. They have to keep cats to do it for them. I\r\nnever knew any cat that could sware as genteelly and effectively as the\r\nB’y.”\r\n\r\n“Is that what you call him?” asked Emily, looking at the black cat in\r\nsome awe. It seemed hardly safe to discuss him right before his face.\r\n\r\n“That’s what he calls himself. My mother doesn’t like him because he\r\nsteals the cream. Now, _I_ don’t mind his doing that; no, it’s his way\r\nav licking his jaws after it that I can’t stand. Oh, B’y, we’ve a fairy\r\ncalling on us. Be excited for once, I implore you--there’s a duck av a\r\ncat.”\r\n\r\nThe B’y refused to be excited. He winked an insolent eye at Emily.\r\n\r\n“Have you any idea what goes on in the head av a cat, elf?”\r\n\r\nWhat queer questions Father Cassidy asked. Yet Emily thought she would\r\nlike his questions if she were not so worried. Suddenly Father Cassidy\r\nleaned across the table and said,\r\n\r\n“Now, just what’s bothering you?”\r\n\r\n“I’m so unhappy,” said Emily piteously.\r\n\r\n“So are lots av other people. Everybody is unhappy by spells. But\r\ncreatures who have pointed ears shouldn’t be unhappy. It’s only mortals\r\nwho should be that.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, please--please--” Emily wondered what she should call him. Would\r\nit offend him if a Protestant called him “Father”? But she had to risk\r\nit--“please, Father Cassidy, I’m in such trouble and I’ve come to ask a\r\n_great favour_ of you.”\r\n\r\nEmily told him the whole tale from beginning to end--the old\r\nMurray-Sullivan feud, her erstwhile friendship with Lofty John, the\r\nBig Sweet apple, the unhappy consequence, and Lofty John’s threatened\r\nrevenge. The B’y and Father Cassidy listened with equal gravity until\r\nshe had finished. Then the B’y winked at her, but Father Cassidy put\r\nhis long brown fingers together.\r\n\r\n“Humph,” he said.\r\n\r\n(“That’s the first time,” reflected Emily, “that I’ve ever heard anyone\r\noutside of a book say ‘Humph.’”)\r\n\r\n“Humph,” said Father Cassidy again. “And you want me to put a stop to\r\nthis nefarious deed?”\r\n\r\n“If you can,” said Emily. “Oh, it would be so splendid if you could.\r\nWill you--will you?”\r\n\r\nFather Cassidy fitted his fingers still more carefully together.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I can hardly invoke the power av the keys to prevent Lofty\r\nJohn from disposing as he wishes av his own lawful property, you know,\r\nelf.”\r\n\r\nEmily didn’t understand the allusion to the keys but she did understand\r\nthat Father Cassidy was declining to bring the lever of the Church to\r\nbear on Lofty John. There was no hope, then. She could not keep the\r\ntears of disappointment out of her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Oh, come now, darling, don’t cry,” implored Father Cassidy. “Elves\r\nnever cry--they can’t. It would break my heart to discover you weren’t\r\nav the Green Folk. You may call yourself av New Moon and av any\r\nreligion you like, but the fact remains that you belong to the Golden\r\nAge and the old gods. That’s why I must save your precious bit av\r\ngreenwood for you.”\r\n\r\nEmily stared.\r\n\r\n“I think it can be done,” Father Cassidy went on. “I think if I go\r\nto Lofty John and have a heart-to-heart talk with him I can make him\r\nsee reason. Lofty John and I are very good friends. He’s a reasonable\r\ncreature, if you know how to take him--which means to flatter his\r\nvanity judiciously. I’ll put it to him, not as priest to parishoner,\r\nbut as man to man, that no decent Irishman carries on a feud with\r\nwomen and that no sensible person is going to destroy for nothing but\r\na grudge those fine old trees that have taken half a century to grow\r\nand can never be replaced. Why, the man who cuts down such a tree except\r\nwhen it is really necessary should be hanged as high as Haman on a\r\ngallows made from the wood av it.”\r\n\r\n(Emily thought she would write that last sentence of Father Cassidy’s\r\ndown in Cousin Jimmy’s blank book when she got home.)\r\n\r\n“But I won’t say _that_ to Lofty John,” concluded Father Cassidy. “Yes,\r\nEmily av New Moon, I think we can consider it a settled thing that your\r\nbush will not be cut down.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly Emily felt very happy. Somehow she had entire confidence in\r\nFather Cassidy. She was sure he would twist Lofty John around his\r\nlittle finger.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I can never thank you enough!” she said earnestly.\r\n\r\n“That’s true, so don’t waste breath trying. And now tell me things. Are\r\nthere any more av you? And how long have you been yourself?”\r\n\r\n“I’m twelve years old--I haven’t any brothers or sisters. And I _think_\r\nI’d better be going home.”\r\n\r\n“Not till you’ve had a bite av lunch.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, thank you, I’ve had my supper.”\r\n\r\n“Two hours ago and a two-mile walk since. Don’t tell me. I’m sorry I\r\nhaven’t any nectar and ambrosia on hand--such food as elves eat--and\r\nnot even a saucer av moonshine--but my mother makes the best plum\r\ncake av any woman in P. E. Island. And we keep a cream cow. Wait here\r\na bit. Don’t be afraid av the B’y. He eats tender little Protestants\r\nsometimes, but he never meddles with leprechauns.”\r\n\r\nWhen Father Cassidy came back his mother came with him, carrying a\r\ntray. Emily had expected to see her big and brown too, but she was the\r\ntiniest woman imaginable, with snow-white, silky hair, mild blue eyes,\r\nand pink cheeks.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t she the sweetest thing in the way av mothers?” asked Father\r\nCassidy. “I keep her to look at. Av course--” Father Cassidy dropped\r\nhis voice to a pig’s whisper--“there’s something odd about her. I’ve\r\nknown that woman to stop right in the middle av housecleaning, and go\r\noff and spend an afternoon in the woods. Like yourself, I’m thinking\r\nshe has some truck with fairies.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Cassidy smiled, kissed Emily, said she must go out and finish her\r\npreserving, and trotted off.\r\n\r\n“Now you sit right down here, Elf, and be human for ten minutes and\r\nwe’ll have a friendly snack.”\r\n\r\nEmily _was_ hungry--a nice comfortable feeling she hadn’t experienced\r\nfor a fortnight. Mrs. Cassidy’s plum cake was all her reverend son\r\nclaimed, and the cream cow seemed to be no myth.\r\n\r\n“What do you think av me now?” asked Father Cassidy suddenly, finding\r\nEmily’s eyes fixed on him speculatively.\r\n\r\nEmily blushed. She had been wondering if she dared ask another favour\r\nof Father Cassidy.\r\n\r\n“I think you are awfully good,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I _am_ awfully good,” agreed Father Cassidy. “I’m so good that I’ll do\r\nwhat you want me to do--for I feel there’s something else you want me\r\nto do.”\r\n\r\n“I’m in a scrape and I’ve been in it all summer. You see”--Emily was\r\nvery sober--“I am a poetess.”\r\n\r\n“Holy Mike! That _is_ serious. I don’t know if I can do much for you.\r\nHow long have you been that way?”\r\n\r\n“Are you making fun of me?” asked Emily gravely.\r\n\r\nFather Cassidy swallowed something besides plum cake.\r\n\r\n“The saints forbid! It’s only that I’m rather overcome. To be after\r\nentertaining a lady av New Moon--and an elf--and a poetess all in one\r\nis a bit too much for a humble praste like meself. Have another slice\r\nav cake and tell me all about it.”\r\n\r\n“It’s like this--I’m writing an epic.”\r\n\r\nFather Cassidy suddenly leaned over and gave Emily’s wrist a little\r\npinch.\r\n\r\n“I just wanted to see if you were real,” he explained. “Yes--yes,\r\nyou’re writing an epic--go on. I think I’ve got my second wind now.”\r\n\r\n“I began it last spring. I called it _The White Lady_ first but now\r\nI’ve changed it to _The Child of the Sea_. Don’t you think that’s a\r\nbetter title?”\r\n\r\n“Much better.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got three cantos done, and I can’t get any further because\r\nthere’s something I don’t know and can’t find out. I’ve been so worried\r\nabout it.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“My epic,” said Emily, diligently devouring plum cake, “is about a very\r\nbeautiful high-born girl who was stolen away from her real parents when\r\nshe was a baby and brought up in a woodcutter’s hut.”\r\n\r\n“One av of the seven original plots in the world,” murmured Father\r\nCassidy.\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing. Just a bad habit av thinking aloud. Go on.”\r\n\r\n“She had a lover of high degree but his family did not want him to\r\nmarry her because she was only a woodcutter’s daughter--”\r\n\r\n“Another of the seven plots--excuse me.”\r\n\r\n“--so they sent him away to the Holy land on a crusade and word came\r\nback that he was killed and then Editha--her name was Editha--went into\r\na convent--”\r\n\r\nEmily paused for a bite of plum cake and Father Cassidy took up the\r\nstrain.\r\n\r\n“And now her lover comes back very much alive, though covered with\r\nPaynim scars, and the secret av her birth is discovered through the\r\ndying confession av the old nurse and the birthmark on her arm.”\r\n\r\n“How did you know?” gasped Emily in amazement.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I guessed it--I’m a good guesser. But where’s your bother in all\r\nthis?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know how to get her out of the convent,” confessed Emily. “I\r\nthought perhaps you would know how it could be done.”\r\n\r\nAgain Father Cassidy fitted his fingers.\r\n\r\n“Let us see, now. It’s no light matter you’ve undertaken, young lady.\r\nHow stands the case? _Editha_ has taken the veil, not because she has\r\na religious vocation but because she imagines her heart is broken. The\r\nCatholic Church does not release its nuns from their vows because they\r\nhappen to think they’ve made a little mistake av that sort. No, no,--we\r\nmust have a better reason. Is this Editha the sole child av her real\r\nparents?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, then the way is clear. If she had had any brothers or sisters you\r\nwould have had to kill them off, which is a messy thing to do. Well,\r\nthen, she is the sole daughter and heiress av a noble family who have\r\nfor years been at deadly feud with another noble family--the family av\r\nthe lover. Do you know what a feud is?”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Emily disdainfully. “And I’ve got all that in the\r\npoem already.”\r\n\r\n“So much the better. This feud has rent the kingdom in twain and can\r\nonly be healed by an alliance between Capulet and Montague.”\r\n\r\n“Those aren’t their names.”\r\n\r\n“No matter. This, then, is a national affair, with far-reaching issues,\r\ntherefore an appeal to the Supreme Pontiff is quite in order. What you\r\nwant,” Father Cassidy nodded solemnly, “is a dispensation from Rome.”\r\n\r\n“Dispensation is a hard word to work into a poem,” said Emily.\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly. But young ladies who _will_ write epic poems and who\r\n_will_ lay the scenes thereof amid times and manners av hundreds av\r\nyears ago, and _will_ choose heroines av a religion quite unknown to\r\nthem, _must_ expect to run up against a few snags.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I think I’ll be able to work it in,” said Emily cheerfully. “And\r\nI’m so much obliged to you. You don’t know what a relief it is to my\r\nmind. I’ll finish the poem right up now in a few weeks. I haven’t done\r\na thing at it all summer. But then of course I’ve been busy. Ilse\r\nBurnley and I have been making a new language.”\r\n\r\n“Making a--new--excuse me. _Did_ you say _language_?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter with English? Isn’t it good enough for you, you\r\nincomprehensible little being?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes. _That_ isn’t why we’re making a new one. You see in the\r\nspring, Cousin Jimmy got a lot of French boys to help plant the\r\npotatoes. I had to help too, and Ilse came to keep me company. And it\r\nwas so annoying to hear those boys talking French when we couldn’t\r\nunderstand a word of it. They did it just to make us mad. Such\r\njabbering! So Ilse and I just made up our minds we’d invent a new\r\nlanguage that _they_ couldn’t understand. We’re getting on fine and\r\nwhen the potato picking time comes we’ll be able to talk to each other\r\nand those boys won’t be able to understand a word we’re saying. Oh, it\r\nwill be great fun!”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t a doubt. But two girls who will go to all the trouble av\r\ninventing a new language just to get square with some poor little\r\nFrench boys--you’re beyond me,” said Father Cassidy, helplessly.\r\n“Goodness knows what you’ll be doing when you grow up. You’ll be Red\r\nRevolutionists. I tremble for Canada.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it isn’t a trouble--it’s fun. And all the girls in school are just\r\nwild because they hear us talking in it and can’t make it out. We can\r\ntalk secrets right before them.”\r\n\r\n“Human nature being what it is, I can see where the fun comes in all\r\nright. Let’s hear a sample av your language.”\r\n\r\n“Nat millan O ste dolman bote ta Shrewsbury fernas ta poo litanos,”\r\nsaid Emily glibly. “That means, ‘Next summer I am going to Shrewsbury\r\nwoods to pick strawberries.’ I yelled that across the playground to\r\nIlse the other day at recess and oh, how everybody stared.”\r\n\r\n“Staring, is it? I should say so. My own poor old eyes are all but\r\ndropping out av me head. Let’s hear a bit more av it.”\r\n\r\n“Mo tral li dead seb ad li mo trene. Mo bertral seb mo bertrene das\r\nsten dead e ting setra. _That_ means ‘My father is dead and so is my\r\nmother. My grandfather and grandmother have been dead a long time.’ We\r\nhaven’t invented a word for ‘dead’ yet. I think I will soon be able to\r\nwrite my poems in our language and then Aunt Elizabeth will not be able\r\nto read them if she finds them.”\r\n\r\n“Have you written any other poetry besides your epic?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes--but just short pieces--dozens of them.”\r\n\r\n“H’m. Would you be so kind as to let me hear one av them?”\r\n\r\nEmily was greatly flattered. And she did not mind letting Father\r\nCassidy hear her precious stuff.\r\n\r\n“I’ll recite my last poem,” she said, clearing her throat importantly.\r\n“It’s called _Evening Dreams_.”\r\n\r\nFather Cassidy listened attentively. After the first verse a change\r\ncame over his big brown face, and he began patting his fingertips\r\ntogether. When Emily finished she hung down her lashes and waited\r\ntremblingly. What if Father Cassidy said it was no good? No, he\r\nwouldn’t be so impolite--but if he bantered her as he had done about\r\nher epic--she would know what _that_ meant.\r\n\r\nFather Cassidy did not speak all at once. The prolonged suspense was\r\nterrible to Emily. She was afraid he could not praise and did not want\r\nto hurt her feelings by dispraise. All at once her “Evening Dreams”\r\nseemed trash and she wondered how she could ever have been silly enough\r\nto repeat it to Father Cassidy.\r\n\r\nOf course, it _was_ trash. Father Cassidy knew that well enough.\r\nAll the same, for a child like this--and rhyme and rhythm were\r\nflawless--and there was one line--just one line--“the light of faintly\r\ngolden stars”--for the sake of that line Father Cassidy suddenly said,\r\n\r\n“Keep on,--keep on writing poetry.”\r\n\r\n“You mean?”--Emily was breathless.\r\n\r\n“I mean you’ll be able to do something by and by. Something--I don’t\r\nknow how much--but keep on--keep on.”\r\n\r\nEmily was so happy she wanted to cry. It was the first word of\r\ncommendation she had ever received except from her father--and a father\r\nmight have too high an opinion of one. _This_ was different. To the end\r\nof her struggle for recognition Emily never forgot Father Cassidy’s\r\n“Keep on” and the tone in which he said it.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Elizabeth scolds me for writing poetry,” she said wistfully. “She\r\nsays people will think I’m as simple as Cousin Jimmy.”\r\n\r\n“The path of genius never did run smooth. But have another piece av\r\ncake--do, just to show there’s something human about you.”\r\n\r\n“Ve, merry ti. O del re dolman cosey aman ri sen ritter. _That_ means,\r\n‘No, thank you. I must be going home before it gets dark.’”\r\n\r\n“I’ll drive you home.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, no. It’s very kind of you”--the English language was quite\r\ngood enough for Emily now. “But I’d rather _walk_. It’s--it’s--such\r\ngood exercise.”\r\n\r\n“Meaning,” said Father Cassidy with a twinkle in his eye, “that we\r\nmust keep it from the old lady. Good-bye, and may you always see a\r\nhappy face in your looking-glass!”\r\n\r\nEmily was too happy to be tired on the way home. There seemed to be a\r\nbubble of joy in her heart--a shimmering, prismatic bubble. When she\r\ncame to the top of the big hill and looked across to New Moon, her eyes\r\nwere satisfied and loving. How beautiful it was, lying embowered in the\r\ntwilight of the old trees; the tips of the loftiest spruces came out in\r\npurple silhouette against the northwestern sky of rose and amber; down\r\nbehind it the Blair Water dreamed in silver; the Wind Woman had folded\r\nher misty bat-wings in a valley of sunset and stillness lay over the\r\nworld like a blessing. Emily felt sure everything would be all right.\r\nFather Cassidy would manage it in some way.\r\n\r\nAnd he had told her to “keep on.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nFRIENDS AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nEmily listened very anxiously on Monday morning, but “no sound of axe,\r\nno ponderous hammer rang” in Lofty John’s bush. That evening on her way\r\nhome from school, Lofty John himself overtook her in his buggy and for\r\nthe first time since the night of the apple stopped and accosted her.\r\n\r\n“Will ye take a lift, Miss Emily av New Moon?” he said affably.\r\n\r\nEmily climbed in, feeling a little bit foolish. But Lofty John looked\r\nquite friendly as he clucked to his horse.\r\n\r\n“So you’ve clean wiled the heart out av Father Cassidy’s body,” he\r\nsaid. “‘The sweetest scrap av a girl I’ve iver seen,’ says he to me.\r\nSure an’ ye might lave the poor prastes alone.”\r\n\r\nEmily looked at Lofty John out of the corner of her eye. He did not\r\nseem angry.\r\n\r\n“Ye’ve put _me_ in a nice tight fix av it,” he went on. “I’m as proud\r\nas any New Moon Murray av ye all and your Aunt Elizabeth said a number\r\nav things that got under my skin. I’ve many an old score to settle with\r\nher. So I thought I’d get square by cutting av the bush down. And you\r\nhad to go and quare me wid me praste bekase av it and now I make no\r\ndoubt I’ll not be after daring to cut a stick av kindling to warm me\r\nshivering carcase without asking lave av the Pope.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Sullivan, are you going to leave the bush alone?” said Emily\r\nbreathlessly.\r\n\r\n“It all rests with yourself, Miss Emily av New Moon. Ye can’t be after\r\nexpecting a Lofty John to be too humble. I didn’t come by the name\r\nbekase av me makeness.”\r\n\r\n“What do you want me to do?”\r\n\r\n“First, then, I’m wanting you to let bygones be bygones in that matter\r\nav the apple. And be token av the same come over and talk to me now\r\nand then as ye did last summer. Sure now, and I’ve missed ye--ye and\r\nthat spit-fire av an Ilse who’s never come aither bekase she thinks I\r\nmistrated you.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll come of course,” said Emily doubtfully, “if only Aunt Elizabeth\r\nwill let me.”\r\n\r\n“Tell her if she don’t the bush’ll be cut down--ivery last stick av it.\r\nThat’ll fetch her. And there’s wan more thing. Ye must ask me rale make\r\nand polite to do ye the favour av not cutting down the bush. If ye do\r\nit pretty enough sure niver a tree will I touch. But if ye don’t down\r\nthey go, praste or no praste,” concluded Lofty John.\r\n\r\nEmily summoned all her wiles to her aid. She clasped her hands, she\r\nlooked up through her lashes at Lofty John, she smiled as slowly\r\nand seductively as she knew how--and Emily had considerable native\r\nknowledge of that sort. “Please, Mr. Lofty John,” she coaxed, “won’t\r\nyou leave me the dear bush I love?”\r\n\r\nLofty John swept off his crumpled old felt hat. “To be sure an’ I will.\r\nA proper Irishman always does what a lady asks him. Sure an’ it’s been\r\nthe ruin av us. We’re at the mercy av the petticoats. If ye’d come\r\nand said that to me afore ye’d have had no need av your walk to White\r\nCross. But mind ye keep the rest av the bargin. The reds are ripe and\r\nthe scabs soon will be--and all the rats have gone to glory.”\r\n\r\nEmily flew into the New Moon kitchen like a slim whirlwind.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Elizabeth, Lofty John isn’t going to cut down the bush--he told\r\nme he wouldn’t--but I have to go and see him sometimes--if you don’t\r\nobject.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose it wouldn’t make much difference to you if I did,” said\r\nAunt Elizabeth. But her voice was not so sharp as usual. She would not\r\nconfess how much Emily’s announcement relieved her; but it mellowed her\r\nattitude considerably. “There’s a letter here for you. I want to know\r\nwhat it means.”\r\n\r\nEmily took the letter. It was the first time she had ever received a\r\nreal letter through the mail and she tingled with the delight of it.\r\nIt was addressed in a heavy black hand to “Miss Emily Starr, New Moon,\r\nBlair Water.” But--\r\n\r\n“You opened it!” she cried indignantly.\r\n\r\n“Of course I did. You are not going to receive letters I am not to see,\r\nMiss. What I want to know is--how comes Father Cassidy to be writing to\r\nyou--and writing such nonsense?”\r\n\r\n“I went to see him Saturday,” confessed Emily, realizing that the cat\r\nwas out of the bag. “And I asked him if he couldn’t prevent Lofty John\r\nfrom cutting down the bush.”\r\n\r\n“Emily--Byrd--Starr!”\r\n\r\n“I _told_ him I was a Protestant,” cried Emily. “He understands all\r\nabout it. And he was just like anybody else. I like him _better_ than\r\nMr. Dare.”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth did not say much more. There did not seem to be much she\r\n_could_ say. Besides the bush wasn’t going to be cut down. The bringer\r\nof good news is forgiven much. She contented herself with glaring at\r\nEmily--who was too happy and excited to mind glares. She carried her\r\nletter off to the garret dormer and gloated over the stamp and the\r\nsuperscription a bit before she took out the enclosure.\r\n\r\n“Dear Pearl of Emilys,” wrote Father Cassidy. “I’ve seen our lofty\r\nfriend and I feel sure your green outpost of fairyland will be saved\r\nfor your moonlit revels. I know you _do_ dance there by light o’ moon\r\nwhen mortals are snoring. I think you’ll have to go through the form\r\nof asking Mr. Sullivan to spare those trees, but you’ll find him quite\r\nreasonable. It’s all in the knowing how and the time of the moon.\r\nHow goes the epic and the language? I hope you’ll have no trouble in\r\nfreeing the _Child of The Sea_ from her vows. Continue to be the friend\r\nof all good elves, and of\r\n\r\n                          “Your admiring friend,\r\n                                   “_James Cassidy_.\r\n\r\n“P. S. The B’y sends respects. What word have you for ‘cat’ in your\r\nlanguage? Sure and you can’t get anything cattier than ‘cat’ can you,\r\nnow?”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLofty John spread the story of Emily’s appeal to Father Cassidy far\r\nand wide, enjoying it as a good joke on himself. Rhoda Stuart said she\r\nalways knew Emily Starr was a bold thing and Miss Brownell said she\r\nwould be surprised at _nothing_ Emily Starr would do, and Dr. Burnley\r\ncalled her a Little Devil more admiringly than ever, and Perry said she\r\nhad pluck and Teddy took credit for suggesting it, and Aunt Elizabeth\r\nendured, and Aunt Laura thought it might have been worse. But Cousin\r\nJimmy made Emily feel very happy.\r\n\r\n“It would have spoiled the garden and broken my heart, Emily,” he told\r\nher. “You’re a little darling girl to have prevented it.”\r\n\r\nOne day a month later, when Aunt Elizabeth had taken Emily to\r\nShrewsbury to fit her out with a winter coat, they met Father Cassidy\r\nin a store. Aunt Elizabeth bowed with great stateliness, but Emily put\r\nout a slender paw.\r\n\r\n“What about the dispensation from Rome?” whispered Father Cassidy.\r\n\r\nOne Emily was quite horrified lest Aunt Elizabeth should overhear\r\nand think she was having sly dealings with the Pope, such as no\r\ngood Presbyterian half-Murray of New Moon should have. The other\r\nEmily thrilled to her toes with the dramatic delight of a secret\r\nunderstanding of mystery and intrigue. She nodded gravely, her eyes\r\neloquent with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“I got it without any trouble,” she whispered back.\r\n\r\n“Fine,” said Father Cassidy. “I wish you good luck, and I wish it hard.\r\nGood-bye.”\r\n\r\n“Farewell,” said Emily, thinking it a word more in keeping with dark\r\nsecrets than good-bye. She tasted the flavour of that half-stolen\r\ninterview all the way home, and felt quite as if she were living in an\r\nepic herself. She did not see Father Cassidy again for years--he was\r\nsoon afterwards removed to another parish; but she always thought of\r\nhim as a very agreeable and understanding person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nBY AERIAL POST\r\n\r\n\r\n“DEAREST FATHER:\r\n\r\n“My heart is very sore to night. Mike died this morning. Cousin Jimmy\r\nsays he must have been poisoned. Oh, Father dear, I felt so bad. He\r\nwas such a lovely cat. I cried and cried and cried. Aunt Elizabeth was\r\ndisgusted. She said, “You did not make half so much fuss when your\r\nfather died.” What a crewel speech. Aunt Laura was nicer but when she\r\nsaid, “Don’t cry dear. I will get you another kitten,” I saw she didn’t\r\nunderstand either. I don’t want another kitten. If I had _millions_ of\r\nkittens they wouldn’t make up for Mike.\r\n\r\n“Ilse and I buried him in Lofty John’s bush. I am so thankful the\r\nground wasn’t frozen yet. Aunt Laura gave me a shoe box for a coffin,\r\nand some pink tissue paper to wrap his poor little body in. And we put\r\na stone over the grave and I said “Blessed are the dead who die in the\r\nLord.” When I told Aunt Laura about it she was horrified and said, “Oh,\r\nEmily, that was a dreadful thing. You should not have said that over a\r\ncat.” And Cousin Jimmy said, “Don’t you think, Laura, that an innocent\r\nlittle dum creature has a share in God? Emily loved him and all love is\r\npart of God.” And Aunt Laura said, “Maybe you are right, Jimmy. But I\r\nam thankful Elizabeth did not hear her.”\r\n\r\n“Cousin Jimmy may not be all there, but what is there is very nice.\r\n\r\n“But oh, Father, I am so lonesome for Mike tonight. Last night he was\r\nhere playing with me, so cunning and pretty and _smee_, and now he is\r\ncold and dead in Lofty John’s bush.\r\n\r\n                                       “DECEMBER 18.\r\n\r\n“DEAR FATHER:\r\n\r\n“I am here in the garret. The Wind Woman is very sorry about something\r\ntonight. She is sying so sadly around the window. And yet the first\r\ntime I heard her tonight the flash came--I felt as if I had just seen\r\nsomething that happened long, long ago--something so lovely that it\r\nhurt me.\r\n\r\n“Cousin Jimmy says there will be a snow storm tonight. I am glad. I\r\nlike to hear a storm at night. It’s so cozy to snuggle down among\r\nthe blankets and feel it can’t get at you. Only when I snuggle Aunt\r\nElizabeth says I skwirm. The idea of any one not knowing the difference\r\nbetween snuggling and skwirming.\r\n\r\n“I am glad we will have snow for Christmas. The Murray dinner is to\r\nbe at New Moon this year. It is our turn. Last year it was at Uncle\r\nOliver’s but Cousin Jimmy had grippe and couldn’t go so I stayed home\r\nwith him. I will be right in the thick of it this year and it exites\r\nme. I will write you all about it after it is over, dearest.\r\n\r\n“I want to tell you something, Father. I am ashamed of it, but I think\r\nI’ll feel better if I tell you all about it. Last Saturday Ella Lee had\r\na birthday party and I was invited. Aunt Elizabeth let me put on my new\r\nblue cashmere dress. It is a very pretty dress. Aunt Elizabeth wanted\r\nto get a dark brown but Aunt Laura insisted on blue. I looked at myself\r\nin my glass and I remembered that Ilse had told me her father told her\r\nI would be handsome if I had more colour. So I pinched my cheeks to\r\nmake them red. I looked ever so much nicer but it didn’t last. Then\r\nI took an old red velvet flower that had once been in Aunt Laura’s\r\nbonnet and wet it and then rubbed the red on my cheeks. I went to the\r\nparty and the girls all _looked_ at me but nobody said anything, only\r\nRhoda Stuart giggled and giggled. I meant to come home and wash the\r\nred off before Aunt Elizabeth saw me. But she took a notion to call\r\nfor me on her way home from the store. She did not say anything there\r\nbut when we got home she said, “What have you been doing to your face,\r\nEmily?” I told her and I expected an awful scolding, but all she said\r\nwas, “Don’t you know that you have made yourself _cheap_?” I did know\r\nit, too. I had felt that all along although I couldn’t think of the\r\nright word for it before. “I will never do such a thing again, Aunt\r\nElizabeth,” I said. “You’d better not,” she said. “Go and wash your\r\nface this instant.” I did and I was not half so pretty but I felt ever\r\nso much better. Strange to relate, dear Father, I heard Aunt Elizabeth\r\nlaughing about it in the pantry to Aunt Laura afterwards. You never can\r\ntell what will make Aunt Elizabeth laugh. I am sure it was ever so much\r\nfunnier when Saucy Sal followed me to prayer meeting last Wednesday\r\nnight, but Aunt Elizabeth never laughed a bit then. I don’t often go to\r\nprayer meeting but Aunt Laura couldn’t go that night so Aunt Elizabeth\r\ntook me because she doesn’t like to go alone. I didn’t know Sal was\r\nfollowing us till just as we got to the church I saw her. I shooed her\r\naway but after we went in I suppose Sal sneaked in when someone opened\r\nthe door and got upstairs into the galery. And just as soon as Mr.\r\nDare began to pray Sal began to yowl. It sounded awful up in that big\r\nempty galery. I felt so gilty and miserable. I did not need to paint\r\nmy face. It was just burning red and Aunt Elizabeth’s eyes glittered\r\nfeendishly. Mr. Dare prayed a long time. He is deaf, so he did not hear\r\nSal any more than when he sat on her. But everyone else did and the\r\nboys giggled. After the prayer Mr. Morris went up to the galery and\r\nchased Sal out. We could hear her skrambling over the seats and Mr.\r\nMorris after her. I was wild for fear he’d hurt her. I ment to spank\r\nher myself with a shingle next day but I did not want her to be kicked.\r\nAfter a long time he got her out of the galery and she tore down the\r\nstairs and into the church, up one isle and down the other two or\r\nthree times as fast as she could go and Mr. Morris after her with a\r\nbroom. It is awfully funny to think of it now but I did not think it so\r\nfunny at the time I was so ashamed and so afraid Sal would be hurt.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Morris chased her out at last. When he sat down I made a face\r\nat him behind my hymn book. Coming home Aunt Elizabeth said, “I hope\r\nyou have disgraced us enough tonight, Emily Starr. I shall never take\r\nyou to prayer meeting again.” I am sorry I disgraced the Murrays but\r\nI don’t see how I was to blame and anyway I don’t like prayer meeting\r\nbecause it is dull.\r\n\r\n“But it wasn’t dull that night, dear Father.\r\n\r\n“Do you notice how my spelling is improved? I have thought of such a\r\ngood plan. I write my letter first and then I look up all the words I’m\r\nnot sure of and correct them. Sometimes though I think a word is all\r\nright when it isn’t.\r\n\r\n“Ilse and I have given up our language. We fought over the verbs. Ilse\r\ndidn’t want to have any tenses for the verbs. She just wanted to have\r\na different word altogether for every tense. I said if I was going to\r\nmake a language it was going to be a proper one and Ilse got mad and\r\nsaid she had enough bother with grammer in English and I could go and\r\nmake my old language by myself. But that is no fun so I let it go too.\r\nI was sorry because it was very interesting and it was such fun to\r\npuzzle the other girls in school. We weren’t able to get square with\r\nthe French boys after all for Ilse had sore throat all through potato\r\npicking time and couldn’t come over. It seems to me that life is full\r\nof disappointments.\r\n\r\n“We had examinations in school this week. I did pretty well in all\r\nexcept arithmetic. Miss Brownell explained something about the\r\nquestions but I was busy composing a story in my mind and did not\r\nhear her so I got poor marks. The story is called _Madge MacPherson’s\r\nSecret_. I am going to buy four sheets of foolscap with my egg money\r\nand sew them into a book and write the story in it. I can do what I\r\nlike with my egg money. I think maybe I’ll write novels when I grow up\r\nas well as poetry. But Aunt Elizabeth won’t let me read any novels so\r\nhow can I find out how to write them? Another thing that worries me, if\r\nI do grow up and write a wonderful poem, perhaps people won’t see how\r\nwonderful it is.\r\n\r\n“Cousin Jimmy says that a man in Priest Pond says the end of the world\r\nis coming soon. I hope it won’t come till I’ve seen everything in it.\r\n\r\n“Poor Elder MacKay has the mumps.\r\n\r\n“I was over sleeping with Ilse the other night because her father was\r\naway. Ilse says her prayers now and she said she’d bet me anything she\r\ncould pray longer than me. I said she couldn’t and I prayed ever so\r\nlong about everything I could think of and when I couldn’t think of\r\nanything more I thought at first I’d begin over again. Then I thought,\r\n“No, that would not be honerable. A Starr must be honerable.” So I got\r\nup and said “You win” and Ilse never answered. I went around the bed\r\nand there she was asleep on her knees. When I woke her up she said we’d\r\nhave to call the bet off because she could have gone on praying for\r\never so long if she hadn’t fell asleep.\r\n\r\n“After we got into bed I told her a lot of things I wished afterwards I\r\nhadn’t. Secrets.\r\n\r\n“The other day in history class Miss Brownell read that Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh had to lie in the Tower for fourteen years. Perry said\r\n“Wouldn’t they let him get up sometimes?” Then Miss Brownell punished\r\nhim for impertinence, but Perry was in earnest. Ilse was mad at Miss\r\nBrownell for whipping Perry and mad at Perry for asking such a fool\r\nquestion as if he didn’t know anything. But Perry says he is going to\r\nwrite a history book some day that won’t have such puzzling things in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“I am finishing the Disappointed House in my mind. I’m furnishing\r\nthe rooms like flowers. I’ll have a rose room all pink and a lily\r\nroom all white and silver and a pansy room, blue and gold. I wish\r\nthe Disappointed House could have a Christmas. It never has any\r\nChristmasses.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Father, I’ve just thought of something nice. When I grow up and\r\nwrite a great novel and make lots of money, I will buy the Disappointed\r\nHouse and finish it. Then it won’t be Disappointed any more.\r\n\r\n“Ilse’s Sunday School teacher, Miss Willeson, gave her a Bible for\r\nlearning 200 verses. But when she took it home her father laid it on\r\nthe floor and kicked it out in the yard. Mrs. Simms says a judgment\r\nwill come on him but nothing has happened yet. The poor man is warped.\r\nThat is why he did such a wicked thing.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Laura took me to old Mrs. Mason’s funeral last Wednesday. I like\r\nfunerals. They are so dramatic.\r\n\r\n“My pig died last week. It was a _great finanshul loss_ to me. Aunt\r\nElizabeth says Cousin Jimmy fed it too well. I suppose I should not\r\nhave called it after Lofty John.\r\n\r\n“We have maps to draw in school now. Rhoda Stuart always gets the most\r\nmarks. Miss Brownell doesn’t know that Rhoda just puts the map up\r\nagainst a window pane and the paper over it and copies it off. I like\r\ndrawing maps. Norway and Sweden look like a tiger with mountains for\r\nstripes and Ireland looks like a little dog with its back turned on\r\nEngland, and its paws held up against its breast, and Africa looks like\r\na big pork ham. Australia is a lovely map to draw.\r\n\r\n“Ilse is getting on real well in school now. She says she isn’t going\r\nto have me beating her. She can learn like the dickins, as Perry says,\r\nwhen she tries, and she has won the silver metal for Queen’s County.\r\nThe W.C.T.U. in Charlottetown gave it for the best reciter. They had\r\nthe contest in Shrewsbury and Aunt Laura took Ilse because Dr. Burnley\r\nwouldn’t and Ilse won it. Aunt Laura told Dr. Burnley when he was here\r\none day that he ought to give Ilse a good education. He said “I’m not\r\ngoing to waste money educating any she-thing.” And he looked black as\r\na thunder cloud. Oh, I wish Dr. Burnley would love Ilse. I’m so glad\r\n_you_ loved _me_, Father.\r\n\r\n                                           “DEC. 22.\r\n\r\n“Dear Father: We had our school examination today. It was a great\r\noccasion. Almost everybody was there except Dr. Burnley and Aunt\r\nElizabeth. All the girls wore their best dresses but me. I knew Ilse\r\nhad nothing to wear but her shabby old last winter’s plaid that is\r\ntoo short for her, so to keep her from feeling bad, I put on my old\r\nbrown dress, too. Aunt Elizabeth did not want to let me do it at first\r\nbecause New Moon Murrays should be well dressed but when I explained\r\nabout Ilse she looked at Aunt Laura and then said I might.\r\n\r\n“Rhoda Stuart made fun of Ilse and me but I heaped coals of fire on\r\nher head. (That is what is called a figure of speech.) She got stuck\r\nin her recitation. She had left the book home and nobody else knew the\r\npiece but me. At first I looked at her triumphantly. But then a queer\r\nfeeling came into me and I thought “What would I feel like if I was\r\nstuck before a big crowd of people like this? And besides the honour of\r\nthe school is at stake,” so I whispered it to her because I was quite\r\nclose. She got through the rest all right. The strange thing is, dear\r\nFather, that now I don’t feel any more as if I hated her. I feel quite\r\nkindly to her and it is much nicer. It is uncomfortable to hate people.\r\n\r\n                                           “DEC. 28.\r\n\r\n“DEAR FATHER:\r\n\r\n“Christmas is over. It was pretty nice. I never saw so many good things\r\ncooked all at once. Uncle Wallace and Aunt Eva and Uncle Oliver and\r\nAunt Addie and Aunt Ruth were here. Uncle Oliver didn’t bring any of\r\nhis children and I was much disappointed. We had Dr. Burnley and Ilse\r\ntoo. Everyone was dressed up. Aunt Elizabeth wore her black satin dress\r\nwith a pointed lace collar and cap. She looked quite handsome and I was\r\nproud of her. You like your relations to look well even if you don’t\r\nlike _them_. Aunt Laura wore her brown silk and Aunt Ruth had on a\r\ngrey dress. Aunt Eva was _very_ elegant. Her dress had a train. But it\r\nsmelled of moth balls.\r\n\r\n“I had on my blue cashmere and wore my hair tied with blue ribbons, and\r\nAunt Laura let me wear mother’s blue silk sash with the pink daisies\r\non it that she had when she was a little girl at New Moon. Aunt Ruth\r\nsniffed when she saw me. She said, “You have grown a good deal, Em’ly.\r\nI hope you are a better girl.”\r\n\r\n“But she _didn’t_ hope it (really). I saw that quite plain. Then she\r\ntold me my bootlace was untyed.\r\n\r\n“She looks better,” said Uncle Oliver. “I wouldn’t wonder if she grew\r\nup into a strong, healthy girl after all.”\r\n\r\n“Aunt Eva sighed and shook her head. Uncle Wallace didn’t say anything\r\nbut shook hands with me. His hand was as cold as a fish. When we went\r\nout to the sitting room for dinner I stepped on Aunt Eva’s train and\r\nI could hear some stitches rip somewhere. Aunt Eva pushed me away and\r\nAunt Ruth said, “What a very awkward child you are, Emily.” I stepped\r\nbehind Aunt Ruth and stuck out my tongue at her. Uncle Oliver makes a\r\nnoise eating his soup. We had all the good silver spoons out. Cousin\r\nJimmy carved the turkeys and he gave me two slices of the breast\r\nbecause he knows I like the white meat best. Aunt Ruth said “When I was\r\na little girl the wing was good enough for me,” and Cousin Jimmy put\r\n_another_ white slice on my plate. Aunt Ruth didn’t say anything more\r\nthen till the carving was done, and then she said, “I saw your school\r\nteacher in Shrewsbury last Saturday, Em’ly, and she did not give me a\r\nvery good account of you. If you were _my_ daughter I would expect a\r\ndifferent report.”\r\n\r\n“I am very glad I am not your daughter,” I said in my mind. I didn’t\r\nsay it out loud of course but Aunt Ruth said, “Please do not look so\r\nsulky when I speak to you, Em’ly.” And Uncle Wallace said, “It is a\r\npity she has such an unattractive expression.”\r\n\r\n“_You_ are conceited and domineering and stingy,” I said, still in my\r\nmind. “I heard Dr. Burnley say you were.”\r\n\r\n“I see there is an ink-stain on her finger,” said Aunt Ruth. (I had\r\nbeen writing a poem before dinner.)\r\n\r\n“And then a most surprising thing happened. Relations are always\r\nsurprising you. Aunt Elizabeth spoke up and said, “_I do wish, Ruth,\r\nthat you and Wallace would leave that child alone._” I could hardly\r\nbelieve my ears. Aunt Ruth looked annoyed but she _did_ leave me alone\r\nafter that and only sniffed when Cousin Jimmy slipped a bit more white\r\nmeat on my plate.\r\n\r\n“After that the dinner was nice. And when they got as far as the\r\npudding they all began to talk and it was splendid to listen to. They\r\ntold stories and jokes about the Murrays. Even Uncle Wallace laughed\r\nand Aunt Ruth told some things about Great-Aunt Nancy. They were\r\nsarcastic but they were interesting. Aunt Elizabeth opened Grandfather\r\nMurray’s desk and took out an old poem that had been written to Aunt\r\nNancy _by a lover_ when she was young and Uncle Oliver read it.\r\nGreat-Aunt Nancy must have been very beautiful. I wonder if anyone will\r\never write a poem to me. If I could have a bang somebody might. I said,\r\n“Was Great Aunt Nancy really as pretty as that?” and Uncle Oliver said,\r\n“They say she was 70 years ago” and Uncle Wallace said, “She hangs on\r\nwell--she’ll see the century mark yet,” and Uncle Oliver said, “Oh,\r\nshe’s got so in the habit of living she’ll never die.”\r\n\r\n“Dr. Burnley told a story I didn’t understand. Uncle Wallace hawhawed\r\nright out and Uncle Oliver put his napkin up to his face. Aunt Addie\r\nand Aunt Eva looked at each other sidewise and then at their plates\r\nand smiled a little bit. Aunt Ruth seemed offended and Aunt Elizabeth\r\nlooked _coldly_ at Dr. Burnley and said, “I think you forget that\r\nthere are children present.” Dr. Burnley said, “I beg your pardon,\r\nElizabeth,” _very_ politely. He can speak with a _grand air_ when he\r\nlikes. He is very handsome when he is dressed up and shaved. Ilse says\r\nshe is proud of him even if he hates her.\r\n\r\n“After dinner was over the presents were given. That is a Murray\r\ntradishun. We never have stockings or trees but a big bran pie is\r\npassed all around with the presents buried in it and ribbons hanging\r\nout with names on them. It was fun. My relations all gave me useful\r\npresents except Aunt Laura. She gave me a bottle of perfume. I love\r\nit. I love nice smells. Aunt Elizabeth does not approve of perfumes.\r\nShe gave me a new apron but I am thankful to say not a baby one. Aunt\r\nRuth gave me a New Testament and said “Em’ly, I hope you will read a\r\nportion of that every day until you have read it through,” and I said,\r\n“Why, Aunt Ruth, I’ve read the whole New Testament a dozen times (and\r\nso I have) I _love_ Revelations.” (And I _do_. When I read the verse\r\n“and the twelve gates were twelve pearls” I just _saw_ them and the\r\nflash came.) “The Bible is not to be read as a story book,” Aunt Ruth\r\nsaid coldly. Uncle Wallace and Aunt Eva gave me a pair of black mits\r\nand Uncle Oliver and Aunt Addie gave me a whole dollar in nice new\r\nsilver dimes and Cousin Jimmy gave me a hair ribbon. Perry had left a\r\nsilk bookmark for me. He had to go home to spend Christmas day with his\r\nAunt Tom at Stovepipe Town but I saved a lot of nuts and raisins for\r\nhim. I gave him and Teddy handkerchiefs (Teddy’s was a _little_ the\r\nnicest) and I gave Ilse a hair ribbon. I bought them myself out of my\r\negg money. (I will not have any more egg money for a long time because\r\nmy hen has stopped laying.) Everybody was happy and once Uncle Wallace\r\nsmiled right at me. I did not think him so ugly when he smiled.\r\n\r\n“After dinner Ilse and I played games in the kitchen and Cousin Jimmy\r\nhelped us make taffy. We had a big supper but nobody could eat much\r\nbecause they had had such a dinner. Aunt Eva’s head ached and Aunt Ruth\r\nsaid she didn’t see why Elizabeth made the sausages so rich. But the\r\nrest were good humored and Aunt Laura kept things pleasant. She is good\r\nat making things pleasant. And after it was all over Uncle Wallace said\r\n(this is another Murray tradishun) “Let us think for a few moments of\r\nthose who have gone before.” I liked the way he said it--very solemnly\r\nand kind. It was one of the times when I am glad the blood of the\r\nMurrays flows in my vains. And I thought of _you_, darling Father, and\r\nMother and poor little Mike and Great-great-Grandmother Murray, and of\r\nmy old account book that Aunt Elizabeth burned, because it seemed just\r\nlike a person to me. And then we all joined hands and sung “For Auld\r\nLang Syne” before they went home. I didn’t feel like a stranger among\r\nthe Murrays any more. Aunt Laura and I stood out on the porch to watch\r\nthem go. Aunt Laura put her arm around me and said, “Your mother and I\r\nused to stand like this long ago, Emily, to watch the Christmas guests\r\ngo away.” The snow creaked and the bells rang back through the trees\r\nand the frost on the pighouse roof sparkled in the moonlight. And it\r\nwas all so lovely (the bells and the frost and the big shining white\r\nnight) that _the flash_ came and that was best of all.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n“ROMANTIC BUT NOT COMFORTABLE”\r\n\r\n\r\nA certain thing happened at New Moon because Teddy Kent paid Ilse\r\nBurnley a compliment one day and Emily Starr didn’t altogether like it.\r\nEmpires have been overturned for the same reason.\r\n\r\nTeddy was skating on Blair Water and taking Ilse and Emily out in\r\nturns for “slides.” Neither Ilse nor Emily had skates. Nobody was\r\nsufficiently interested in Ilse to buy skates for her, and as for\r\nEmily, Aunt Elizabeth did not approve of girls skating. New Moon girls\r\nhad never skated. Aunt Laura had a revolutionary idea that skating\r\nwould be good exercise for Emily and would, moreover, prevent her\r\nfrom wearing out the soles of her boots sliding. But neither of these\r\narguments was sufficient to convince Aunt Elizabeth, in spite of the\r\nthrifty streak that came to her from the Burnleys. The latter, however,\r\ncaused her to issue an edict that Emily was not to “slide.” Emily took\r\nthis very hardly. She moped about in a woe-begone fashion and she wrote\r\nto her father, “I _hate_ Aunt Elizabeth. She is so unjust. She never\r\nplays fair.” But one day Dr. Burnley stuck his head in at the door of\r\nthe New Moon kitchen and said gruffly, “What’s this I hear about you\r\nnot letting Emily slide, Elizabeth?”\r\n\r\n“She wears out the soles of her boots,” said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n“Boots be--” the doctor remembered that ladies were present just in\r\ntime. “Let the creature slide all she wants to. She ought to be in\r\nthe open air all the time. She ought”--the doctor stared at Elizabeth\r\nferociously--“she ought to sleep out of doors.”\r\n\r\nElizabeth trembled lest the doctor should go on to insist on this\r\nunheard-of proceeding. She knew he had absurd ideas about the proper\r\ntreatment of consumptives and those who might become such. She was glad\r\nto appease him by letting Emily stay out-of-doors in daytime and do\r\nwhat seemed good to her, if only he would say no more about staying out\r\nall night too.\r\n\r\n“He is much more concerned about Emily than he is about his own child,”\r\nshe said bitterly to Laura.\r\n\r\n“Ilse is too healthy,” said Aunt Laura with a smile. “If she were a\r\ndelicate child Allan might forgive her for--for being her mother’s\r\ndaughter.”\r\n\r\n“S--s--h,” said Aunt Elizabeth. But she “s--s--s--h’d” too late. Emily,\r\ncoming into the kitchen, had heard Aunt Laura and puzzled over what she\r\nhad said all day in school. Why had Ilse to be forgiven for being her\r\nmother’s daughter? Everybody was her mother’s daughter, wasn’t she?\r\nWherein did the crime consist? Emily worried over it so much that she\r\nwas inattentive to her lessons and Miss Brownell raked her fore and aft\r\nwith sarcasm.\r\n\r\nIt is time we got back to Blair Water where Teddy was just bringing\r\nEmily in from a glorious spin clear round the great circle of ice.\r\nIlse was waiting for her turn, on the bank. Her golden cloud of hair\r\naureoled her face and fell in a shimmering wave over her forehead\r\nunder the faded, little red tam she wore. Ilse’s clothes were always\r\nfaded. The stinging kiss of the wind had crimsoned her cheeks and her\r\neyes were glowing like amber pools with fire in their hearts. Teddy’s\r\nartistic perception saw her beauty and rejoiced in it.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t Ilse handsome?” he said.\r\n\r\nEmily was not jealous. It never hurt her to hear Ilse praised. But\r\nsomehow she did not like this. Teddy was looking at Ilse altogether\r\n_too_ admiringly. It was all, Emily believed, due to that shimmering\r\nfringe on Ilse’s white brows.\r\n\r\n“If _I_ had a bang Teddy might think me handsome too,” she thought\r\nresentfully. “Of course, black hair isn’t as pretty as gold. But my\r\nforehead is too high--everybody says so. And I _did_ look nice in\r\nTeddy’s picture because he drew some curls over it.”\r\n\r\nThe matter rankled. Emily thought of it as she went home over the sheen\r\nof the crusted snow-field slanting to the light of the winter sunset,\r\nand she could not eat her supper because she did not have a bang. All\r\nher long hidden yearning for a bang seemed to come to a head at once.\r\nShe knew there was no use in coaxing Aunt Elizabeth for one. But when\r\nshe was getting ready for bed that night she stood on a chair so that\r\nshe could see little Emily-in-the-glass, then lifted the curling ends\r\nof her long braid and laid them over her forehead. The effect, in\r\nEmily’s eyes at least, was very alluring. She suddenly thought--what if\r\nshe cut a bang herself? It would take only a minute. And once done what\r\ncould Aunt Elizabeth do? She would be very angry and doubtless inflict\r\nsome kind of punishment. But the bang would be there--at least until it\r\ngrew out long.\r\n\r\nEmily, her lips set, went for the scissors. She unbraided her hair and\r\nparted the front tresses. Snip--snip--went the scissors. Glistening\r\nlocks fell at her feet. In a minute Emily had her long-desired bang.\r\nStraight across her brows fell the lustrous, softly curving fringe. It\r\nchanged the whole character of her face. It made it arch, provocative,\r\nelusive. For one brief moment Emily gazed at her reflection in triumph.\r\n\r\nAnd then--sheer terror seized her. Oh, what had she done? How angry\r\nAunt Elizabeth would be! Conscience suddenly awoke and added its pang\r\nalso. She had been wicked. It was wicked to cut a bang when Aunt\r\nElizabeth had forbidden it. Aunt Elizabeth had given her a home at New\r\nMoon--hadn’t Rhoda Stuart that very day in school twitted her again\r\nwith “living on charity”? And she was repaying her by disobedience and\r\ningratitude. A Starr should not have done that. In a panic of fear\r\nand remorse Emily snatched the scissors and cut the bang off--cut it\r\nclose against the hair line. Worse and worse! Emily beheld the result\r\nin dismay. Any one could see that a bang _had_ been cut, so Aunt\r\nElizabeth’s anger was still to face. And she had made a terrible fright\r\nof herself. Emily burst into tears, snatched up the fallen locks and\r\ncrammed them into the waste-basket, blew out her candle and sprang into\r\nbed, just as Aunt Elizabeth came in.\r\n\r\nEmily burrowed face downward in the pillows, and pretended to be\r\nasleep. She was afraid Aunt Elizabeth would ask her some question and\r\ninsist on her looking up while she answered it. That was a Murray\r\ntradition--you looked people in the face when you spoke to them. But\r\nAunt Elizabeth undressed in silence and came to bed. The room was in\r\ndarkness--thick darkness. Emily sighed and turned over. There was a\r\nhot gin-jar in the bed, she knew, and her feet were cold. But she did\r\nnot think she ought to have the privilege of the gin-jar. She was too\r\nwicked--too ungrateful.\r\n\r\n“_Do_ stop squirming,” said Aunt Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nEmily squirmed no more--physically at least. Mentally she continued to\r\nsquirm. She could not sleep. Her feet or her conscience--or both--kept\r\nher awake. And fear, also. She dreaded the morning. Aunt Elizabeth\r\nwould see then what had happened. If it were only over--if the\r\nrevelation were only over. Emily forgot and squirmed.\r\n\r\n“What makes you so restless tonight?” demanded Aunt Elizabeth, in high\r\ndispleasure. “Are you taking a cold?”\r\n\r\n“No, ma’am.”\r\n\r\n“Then go to sleep. I can’t bear such wriggling. One might as well have\r\nan eel in bed--O--W!”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth, in squirming a bit herself, had put her own foot\r\nagainst Emily’s icy ones.\r\n\r\n“Goodness, child, your feet are like snow. Here, put them on the\r\ngin-jar.”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth pushed the gin-jar over against Emily’s feet. How lovely\r\nand warm and comforting it was!\r\n\r\nEmily worked her toes against it like a cat. But she suddenly knew she\r\ncould not wait for morning.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Elizabeth, I’ve got something to confess.”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth was tired and sleepy and did not want confessions just\r\nthen. In no very gracious tone she said,\r\n\r\n“What have you been doing?”\r\n\r\n“I--I cut a bang, Aunt Elizabeth.”\r\n\r\n“A bang?”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth sat up in bed.\r\n\r\n“But I cut it off again,” cried Emily hurriedly. “Right off--close to\r\nmy head.”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth got out of bed, lit a candle, and looked Emily over.\r\n\r\n“Well you _have_ made a sight of yourself,” she said grimly. “I never\r\nsaw any one as ugly as you are this minute. And you have behaved in a\r\nmost underhanded fashion.”\r\n\r\nThis was one of the times Emily felt compelled to agree with Aunt\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry,” she said, lifting pleading eyes.\r\n\r\n“You will eat your supper in the pantry for a week,” said Aunt\r\nElizabeth. “And you will not go to Uncle Oliver’s next week when I go.\r\nI had promised to take you. But I shall take no one who looks as you do\r\nanywhere with me.”\r\n\r\nThis was hard. Emily had looked forward to that visit to Uncle\r\nOliver’s. But on the whole she was relieved. The worst was over and her\r\nfeet were getting warm. But there was one thing yet. She might as well\r\nunburden her heart completely while she was at it.\r\n\r\n“There’s another thing I feel I ought to tell you.”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth got into bed again with a grunt. Emily took it for\r\npermission.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Elizabeth, you remember that book I found in Dr. Burnley’s\r\nbookcase and brought home and asked you if I could read it? It was\r\ncalled ‘The History of Henry Esmond.’ You looked at it and said you had\r\nno objections to my reading history. So I read it. But, Aunt Elizabeth,\r\nit wasn’t history--it was a novel. And I _knew it when I brought it\r\nhome_.”\r\n\r\n“You know that I have forbidden you to read novels, Emily Starr. They\r\nare wicked books and have ruined many souls.”\r\n\r\n“It was very dull,” pleaded Emily, as if dullness and wickedness were\r\nquite incompatible. “And it made me feel unhappy. Everybody seemed\r\nto be in love with the wrong person. I have made up my mind, Aunt\r\nElizabeth, that I will never fall in love. It makes too much trouble.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t talk of things you can’t understand, and that are not fit for\r\nchildren to think about. This is the result of reading novels. I shall\r\ntell Dr. Burnley to lock his bookcase up.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t do that, Aunt Elizabeth,” exclaimed Emily. “There are no\r\nmore novels in it. But I’m reading such an interesting book over there.\r\nIt tells about everything that’s inside of you. I’ve got as far along\r\nas the liver and its diseases. The pictures are so interesting. Please\r\nlet me finish it.”\r\n\r\nThis was worse than novels. Aunt Elizabeth was truly horrified. Things\r\nthat were inside of you were not to be read about.\r\n\r\n“Have you no shame, Emily Starr? If you have not I am ashamed for you.\r\nLittle girls do not read books like that.”\r\n\r\n“But, Aunt Elizabeth, why not? I _have_ a liver, haven’t I--and heart\r\nand lungs--and stomach--and--”\r\n\r\n“That will do, Emily. Not another word.”\r\n\r\nEmily went to sleep unhappily. She wished she had never said a word\r\nabout ‘Esmond.’ And she knew she would never have a chance to finish\r\nthat other fascinating book. Nor had she. Dr. Burnley’s bookcase was\r\nlocked thereafter and the doctor gruffly ordered her and Ilse to keep\r\nout of his office. He was in a very bad humour about it for he had\r\nwords with Elizabeth Murray over the matter.\r\n\r\nEmily was not allowed to forget her bang. She was twitted and teased\r\nin school about it and Aunt Elizabeth looked at it whenever she looked\r\nat Emily and the contempt in her eyes burned Emily like a flame.\r\nNevertheless, as the mistreated hair grew out and began to curl in\r\nsoft little ringlets, Emily found consolation. The bang was tacitly\r\npermitted, and she felt that her looks were greatly improved thereby.\r\nOf course, as soon as it grew long enough she knew Aunt Elizabeth would\r\nmake her brush it back. But for the time being she took comfort in her\r\nadded beauty.\r\n\r\nThe bang was just about at its best when the letter came from\r\nGreat-Aunt Nancy.\r\n\r\nIt was written to Aunt Laura--Great-Aunt Nancy and Aunt Elizabeth were\r\nnot over-fond of each other--and in it Great-Aunt Nancy said, “If you\r\nhave a photograph of that child Emily send it along. I don’t want to\r\nsee _her_; she’s stupid--I know she’s stupid. But I want to see what\r\nJuliet’s child looks like. Also the child of that fascinating young\r\nman, Douglas Starr. He _was_ fascinating. What fools you all were\r\nto make such a fuss about Juliet running away with him. If you and\r\nElizabeth had _both_ run away with somebody in your running days it\r\nwould have been better for you.”\r\n\r\nThis letter was not shown to Emily. Aunt Elizabeth and Aunt Laura had\r\na long secret consultation and then Emily was told that she was to be\r\ntaken to Shrewsbury to have her picture taken for Aunt Nancy. Emily\r\nwas much excited over this. She was dressed in her blue cashmere and\r\nAunt Laura put a point lace collar on it and hung her Venetian beads\r\nover it. And new buttoned boots were got for the occasion.\r\n\r\n“I’m so glad this has happened while I still have my bang,” thought\r\nEmily happily.\r\n\r\nBut in the photographer’s dressing-room, Aunt Elizabeth grimly\r\nproceeded to brush back her bang and pin it with hairpins.\r\n\r\n“Oh, please, Aunt Elizabeth, let me have it down,” Emily begged. “Just\r\nfor the picture. After this I’ll brush it back.”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth was inexorable. The bang was brushed back and the\r\nphotograph taken. When Aunt Elizabeth saw the finished result she was\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n“She looks sulky; but she is neat; and there is a resemblance to the\r\nMurrays I never noticed before,” she told Aunt Laura. “That will please\r\nAunt Nancy. She is very clannish under all her oddness.”\r\n\r\nEmily would have liked to throw every one of the photographs in the\r\nfire. She hated them. They made her look hideous. Her face seemed to\r\nbe _all_ forehead. If they sent Aunt Nancy that Aunt Nancy would think\r\nher stupider than ever. When Aunt Elizabeth did the photograph up in\r\ncardboard and told Emily to take it to the office Emily already knew\r\nwhat she meant to do. She went straight to the garret and took out of\r\nher box the water-colour Teddy had made of her. It was just the same\r\nsize as the photograph. Emily removed the latter from its wrappings,\r\nspurning it aside with her foot.\r\n\r\n“That isn’t _me_,” she said. “I looked sulky because I felt sulky about\r\nthe bang. But I hardly ever look sulky, so it isn’t fair.”\r\n\r\nShe wrapped Teddy’s sketch up in the cardboard and then sat down and\r\nwrote a letter.\r\n\r\n“DEAR GREAT-AUNT NANCY:\r\n\r\n“Aunt Elizabeth had my picture taken to send you but I don’t like it\r\nbecause it makes me look too ugly and I am putting another picture in\r\ninstead. An _artist friend_ made it for me. It is just like me when I’m\r\nsmiling and have a bang. I am only _lending_ it to you, not _giving_\r\nit, because I valew it very highly.\r\n\r\n                     “Your obedient grand niece,\r\n                                  “EMILY BYRD STARR.\r\n\r\n“P. S. I am not so stupid as you think.\r\n\r\n                                           “E. B. S.\r\n“P. S. No. 2. I am not stupid _at all_.”\r\n\r\nEmily put her letter in with the picture--thereby unconsciously\r\ncheating the post-office--and slipped out of the house to mail it.\r\nOnce it was safely in the post-office she drew a breath of relief. She\r\nfound the walk home very enjoyable. It was a bland day in early April\r\nand spring was looking at you round the corners. The Wind Woman was\r\nlaughing and whistling over the wet sweet fields; freebooting crows\r\nheld conferences in the tree tops; little pools of sunshine lay in the\r\nmossy hollows; the sea was a blaze of sapphire beyond the golden dunes;\r\nthe maples in Lofty John’s bush were talking about red buds. Everything\r\nEmily had ever read of dream and myth and legend seemed a part of the\r\ncharm of that bush. She was filled to her finger-tips with a rapture of\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I smell spring!” she cried as she danced along the brook path.\r\n\r\nThen she began to compose a poem on it. Everybody who has ever lived in\r\nthe world and could string two rhymes together has written a poem on\r\nspring. It is the most be-rhymed subject in the world--and always will\r\nbe, because it is poetry incarnate itself. You can never be a real\r\npoet if you haven’t made at least one poem about spring.\r\n\r\nEmily was wondering whether she would have elves dancing on the\r\nbrookside by moonlight, or pixies sleeping in a bed of ferns in her\r\npoem, when something confronted her at a bend in the path which was\r\nneither elf nor pixy, but seemed odd and weird enough to belong to some\r\nof the tribes of Little People. Was it a witch? Or an elderly fay of\r\nevil intentions--the bad fairy of all christening tales?\r\n\r\n“I’m the b’y’s Aunt Tom,” said the appearance, seeing that Emily was\r\ntoo amazed to do anything but stand and stare.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” Emily gasped in relief. She was no longer frightened. But what a\r\n_very_ peculiar looking lady Perry’s Aunt Tom was. Old--so old that it\r\nseemed quite impossible that she could ever have been young; a bright\r\nred hood over crone-like, fluttering grey locks; a little face seamed\r\nby a thousand fine, criss-cross wrinkles; a long nose with a knob on\r\nthe end of it; little twinkling, eager, grey eyes under bristly brows;\r\na ragged man’s coat covering her from neck to feet; a basket in one\r\nhand and a black knobby stick in the other.\r\n\r\n“Staring wasn’t thought good breeding in my time,” said Aunt Tom.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Emily again. “Excuse me-- How do you do!” she added, with a\r\nvague grasp after her manners.\r\n\r\n“Polite--and not too proud,” said Aunt Tom, peering curiously at her.\r\n“I’ve been up to the big house with a pair of socks for the b’y but\r\n’twas yourself I wanted to see.”\r\n\r\n“Me?” said Emily blankly.\r\n\r\n“Yis. The b’y has been talking a bit of you and a plan kem into my\r\nhead. Thinks I to myself it’s no bad notion. But I’ll make sure before\r\nI waste my bit o’ money. Emily Byrd Starr is your name and Murray is\r\nyour nature. If I give the b’y an eddication will ye marry him when ye\r\ngrow up?”\r\n\r\n“Me!” said Emily again. It seemed to be all she could say. Was she\r\ndreaming? She _must_ be.\r\n\r\n“Yis--you. You’re half Murray and it’ll be a great step up f’r the b’y.\r\nHe’s smart and he’ll be a rich man some day and boss the country. But\r\ndivil a cent will I spend on him unless you promise.”\r\n\r\n“Aunt Elizabeth wouldn’t let me,” cried Emily, too frightened of this\r\nodd old body to refuse on her own account.\r\n\r\n“If you’ve got any Murray in you you’ll do your own choosing,” said\r\nAunt Tom, thrusting her face so close to Emily’s that her bushy\r\neyebrows tickled Emily’s nose. “Say you’ll marry the b’y and to college\r\nhe goes.”\r\n\r\nEmily seemed to be rendered speechless. She could think of nothing to\r\nsay--oh, if she could _only_ wake up! She could not even run.\r\n\r\n“Say it!” insisted Aunt Tom, thumping her stick sharply on a stone in\r\nthe path.\r\n\r\nEmily was so horrified that she might have said something--anything--to\r\nescape. But at this moment Perry bounded out of the spruce copse, his\r\nface white with rage, and seized his Aunt Tom most disrespectfully by\r\nthe shoulder.\r\n\r\n“You go home!” he said furiously.\r\n\r\n“Now, b’y dear,” quavered Aunt Tom deprecatingly. “I was only trying to\r\ndo you a good turn. I was asking her to marry ye after a bit an--”\r\n\r\n“I’ll do my own asking!” Perry was angrier than ever. “You’ve likely\r\nspoiled everything. Go home--go home, I say!”\r\n\r\nAunt Tom hobbled off muttering, “Then I’ll know better than to waste me\r\nbit o’ money. No Murray, no money, me b’y.”\r\n\r\nWhen she had disappeared down the brook path Perry turned to Emily.\r\nFrom white he had gone very red.\r\n\r\n“Don’t mind her--she’s cracked,” he said. “Of course, when I grow up I\r\nmean to ask you to marry me but--”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t--Aunt Elizabeth--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, she will then. I’m going to be premier of Canada some day.”\r\n\r\n“But I wouldn’t want--I’m sure I wouldn’t--”\r\n\r\n“You will when you grow up. Ilse is better looking of course, and I\r\ndon’t know why I like you best but I do.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you ever talk to me like this again!” commanded Emily, beginning\r\nto recover her dignity.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I won’t--not till we grow up. I’m as ashamed of it as you are,”\r\nsaid Perry with a sheepish grin. “Only I had to say something after\r\nAunt Tom butted in like that. I ain’t to blame for it so don’t you hold\r\nit against me. But just you remember that I’m going to ask you some\r\nday. And I believe Teddy Kent is too.”\r\n\r\nEmily was walking haughtily away but she turned at this to say coolly\r\nover her shoulder,\r\n\r\n“If he does I’ll marry him.”\r\n\r\n“If you do I’ll knock his head off,” shouted Perry in a prompt rage.\r\n\r\nBut Emily walked steadily on home and went to the garret to think\r\nthings over.\r\n\r\n“It has been romantic but not comfortable,” was her conclusion. And\r\nthat particular poem on spring was never finished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nWYTHER GRANGE\r\n\r\n\r\nNo reply or acknowledgement came from Great-Aunt Nancy Priest regarding\r\nEmily’s picture. Aunt Elizabeth and Aunt Laura, knowing Great-Aunt\r\nNancy’s ways tolerably well, were not surprised at this, but Emily\r\nfelt rather worried over it. Perhaps Great-Aunt Nancy did not approve\r\nof what she had done; or perhaps she still thought her too stupid to\r\nbother with.\r\n\r\nEmily did not like to lie under the imputation of stupidity. She wrote\r\na scathing epistle to Great-Aunt Nancy on a letter-bill in which she\r\ndid not mince her opinions as to that ancient lady’s knowledge of the\r\nrules of epistolary etiquette; the letter was folded up and stowed away\r\non the little shelf under the sofa but it served its purpose in blowing\r\noff steam and Emily had ceased to think about the matter when a letter\r\ncame from Great-Aunt Nancy in July.\r\n\r\nElizabeth and Laura talked the matter over in the cook-house, forgetful\r\nor ignorant of the fact that Emily was sitting on the kitchen doorstep\r\njust outside. Emily was imagining herself attending a drawing-room of\r\nQueen Victoria. Robed in white, with ostrich plumes, veil, and court\r\ntrain, she had just bent to kiss the Queen’s hand when Aunt Elizabeth’s\r\nvoice shattered her dream as a pebble thrown into a pool scatters the\r\nfairy reflection.\r\n\r\n“What is your opinion, Laura,” Aunt Elizabeth was saying, “of letting\r\nEmily visit Aunt Nancy?”\r\n\r\nEmily pricked up her ears. What was in the wind now?\r\n\r\n“From her letter she seems very anxious to have the child,” said Laura.\r\n\r\nElizabeth sniffed.\r\n\r\n“A whim--a whim. You know what her whims are. Likely by the time Emily\r\ngot there she’d be quite over it and have no use for her.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but on the other hand if we don’t let her go she will be\r\ndreadfully offended and never forgive us--or Emily. Emily should have\r\nher chance.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know that her chance is worth much. If Aunt Nancy really has\r\nany money beyond her annuity--and that’s what neither you nor I nor any\r\nliving soul knows, unless it’s Caroline--she’ll likely leave it all to\r\nsome of the Priests--Leslie Priest’s a favourite of hers, I understand.\r\nAunt Nancy always liked her husband’s family better than her own, even\r\nthough she’s always slurring at them. Still--she _might_ take a fancy\r\nto Emily--they’re both so odd they might suit each other--but you know\r\nthe way she talks--she and that abominable old Caroline.”\r\n\r\n“Emily is too young to understand,” said Aunt Laura.\r\n\r\n“I understand more than you think,” cried Emily indignantly.\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth jerked open the cook-house door.\r\n\r\n“Emily Starr, haven’t you learned by this time not to listen?”\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t listening. I thought you knew I was sitting here--I can’t\r\nhelp my ears _hearing_. Why didn’t you _whisper_? When you whisper I\r\nknow you’re talking secrets and I don’t try to hear them. Am I going to\r\nGreat-Aunt Nancy’s for a visit?”\r\n\r\n“We haven’t decided,” said Aunt Elizabeth coldly, and that was all the\r\nsatisfaction Emily got for a week. She hardly knew herself whether she\r\nwanted to go or not. Aunt Elizabeth had begun making cheese--New Moon\r\nwas noted for its cheeses--and Emily found the whole process absorbing,\r\nfrom the time the rennet was put in the warm new milk till the white\r\ncurds were packed away in the hoop and put under the press in the old\r\norchard, with the big, round, grey “cheese” stone to weight it down as\r\nit had weighed down New Moon cheeses for a hundred years. And then she\r\nand Ilse and Teddy and Perry were absorbed heart and soul in “playing\r\nout” the “Midsummer Night’s Dream” in Lofty John’s bush and it was\r\nvery fascinating. When they entered Lofty John’s bush they went out of\r\nthe realm of daylight and things known into the realm of twilight and\r\nmystery and enchantment. Teddy had painted wonderful scenery on old\r\nboards and pieces of sails, which Perry had got at the Harbor. Ilse\r\nhad fashioned delightful fairy wings from tissue paper and tinsel, and\r\nPerry had made an ass’s head for _Bottom_ out of an old calf-skin that\r\nwas very realistic. Emily had toiled happily for many weeks copying\r\nout the different parts and adapting them to circumstances. She had\r\n“cut” the play after a fashion that would have harrowed Shakespeare’s\r\nsoul but after all the result was quite pretty and coherent. It did not\r\nworry them that four small actors had to take six times as many parts.\r\nEmily was _Titania_ and _Hermia_ and a job lot of fairies besides, Ilse\r\nwas _Hippolyta_ and _Helena_, plus some more fairies, and the boys were\r\nanything that the dialogue required. Aunt Elizabeth knew nothing of it\r\nall; she would promptly have put a stop to the whole thing, for she\r\nthought play-acting exceedingly wicked; but Aunt Laura was privy to the\r\nplot, and Cousin Jimmy and Lofty John had already attended a moonlight\r\nrehearsal.\r\n\r\nTo go away and leave all this, even for a time, would be a hard wrench,\r\nbut on the other hand Emily had a burning curiosity to see Great-Aunt\r\nNancy and Wyther Grange, her quaint, old house at Priest Pond with\r\nthe famous stone dogs on the gateposts. On the whole, she thought she\r\nwould like to go; and when she saw Aunt Laura doing up her starched\r\nwhite petticoats and Aunt Elizabeth grimly dusting off a small, black,\r\nnail-studded trunk in the garret she knew, before she was told, that\r\nthe visit to Priest Pond was going to come off; so she took out the\r\nletter she had written to Aunt Nancy and added an apologetic postscript.\r\n\r\nIlse chose to be disgruntled because Emily was going for a visit. In\r\nreality Ilse felt appalled at the lonely prospect of a month or more\r\nwithout her inseparable chum. No more jolly evenings of play-acting in\r\nLofty John’s bush, no more pungent quarrels. Besides, Ilse herself had\r\nnever been anywhere for a visit in her whole life and she felt sore\r\nover this fact.\r\n\r\n“_I_ wouldn’t go to Wyther Grange for anything,” said Ilse. “It’s\r\nhaunted.”\r\n\r\n“’Tisn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Yes! It’s haunted by a ghost you can _feel_ and _hear_ but never\r\n_see_. Oh, I wouldn’t be _you_ for the world! Your Great-Aunt Nancy is\r\nan _awful crank_ and the old woman who lives with her is a _witch_.\r\nShe’ll put a spell on you. You’ll pine away and die.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t--she isn’t!”\r\n\r\n“_Is!_ Why, she makes the stone dogs on the gateposts howl every night\r\nif any one comes near the place. They go, ‘_Wo-or-oo-oo_.’”\r\n\r\nIlse was not a born elocutionist for nothing. Her “wo-or-oo-oo” was\r\nextremely gruesome. But it was daylight, and Emily was as brave as a\r\nlion in daylight.\r\n\r\n“You’re jealous,” she said, and walked off.\r\n\r\n“I’m not, you blithering centipede,” Ilse yelled after her. “Putting\r\non airs because your aunt has stone dogs on her gateposts! Why, I know\r\na woman in Shrewsbury who has dogs on her posts that are ten times\r\nstonier than your aunt’s!”\r\n\r\nBut next morning Ilse was over to bid Emily good-bye and entreat her\r\nto write every week. Emily was going to drive to Priest Pond with Old\r\nKelly. Aunt Elizabeth was to have driven her but Aunt Elizabeth was not\r\nfeeling well that day and Aunt Laura could not leave her. Cousin Jimmy\r\nhad to work at the hay. It looked as if she could not go, and this was\r\nrather serious, for Aunt Nancy had been told to expect her that day\r\nand Aunt Nancy did not like to be disappointed. If Emily did not turn\r\nup at Priest Pond on the day set Great-Aunt Nancy was quite capable of\r\nshutting the door in her face when she did appear and telling her to go\r\nback home. Nothing less than this conviction would have induced Aunt\r\nElizabeth to fall in with Old Kelly’s suggestion that Emily should ride\r\nto Priest Pond with him. His home was on the other side of it and he\r\nwas going straight there.\r\n\r\nEmily was quite delighted. She liked Old Kelly and thought that a drive\r\non his fine red wagon would be quite an adventure. Her little black\r\nbox was hoisted to the roof and tied there and they went clinking and\r\nglittering down the New Moon lane in fine style. The tins in the bowels\r\nof the wagon behind them rumbled like a young earthquake.\r\n\r\n“Get up, my nag, get up,” said Old Kelly. “Sure, an’ I always like to\r\ndrive the pretty gurrls. An’ when is the wedding to be?”\r\n\r\n“Whose wedding?”\r\n\r\n“The slyness av her! Your own, av coorse.”\r\n\r\n“I have no intention of being married--immediately,” said Emily, in a\r\nvery good imitation of Aunt Elizabeth’s tone and manner.\r\n\r\n“Sure, and ye’re a chip av the ould block. Miss Elizabeth herself\r\ncouldn’t have said it better. Get up, my nag, get up.”\r\n\r\n“I only meant,” said Emily, fearing that she had insulted Old Kelly,\r\n“that I am too young to be married.”\r\n\r\n“The younger the better--the less mischief ye’ll be after working with\r\nthem come-hither eyes. Get up, my nag, get up. The baste is tired. So\r\nwe’ll let him go at his own swate will. Here’s a bag av swaties for ye.\r\nOuld Kelley always trates the ladies. Come now, tell me all about him.”\r\n\r\n“About who?”--but Emily knew quite well.\r\n\r\n“Your beau, av coorse.”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t _any_ beau. Mr. Kelly, I wish you wouldn’t talk to me about\r\nsuch things.”\r\n\r\n“Sure, and I won’t if ’tis a sore subject. Don’t ye be minding if ye\r\nhaven’t got one--there’ll be scads av them after a while. And if the\r\nright one doesn’t know what’s good for him, just ye come to Ould Kelly\r\nand get some toad ointment.”\r\n\r\nToad ointment! It sounded horrible. Emily shivered. But she would\r\nrather talk about toad ointment than beaux.\r\n\r\n“What is that for?”\r\n\r\n“It’s a love charm,” said Old Kelly mysteriously. “Put a li’l smootch\r\non his eyelids and he’s yourn for life with never a squint at any other\r\ngurrl.”\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t _sound_ very nice,” said Emily. “How do you make it?”\r\n\r\n“You bile four toads alive till they’re good and soft and then mash--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, stop, stop!” implored Emily, putting her hands to her ears. “I\r\ndon’t want to hear any more--you couldn’t be so cruel!”\r\n\r\n“Cruel is it? You were after eating lobsters this day that were biled\r\nalive--”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe it. I don’t. If it’s true I’ll never, never eat one\r\nagain. Oh, Mr. Kelly, I thought you were a nice kind man--but those\r\npoor toads!”\r\n\r\n“Gurrl dear, it was only me joke. An’ you won’t be nading toad ointment\r\nto win your lad’s love. Wait you now--I’ve something in the till behind\r\nme for a prisent for you.”\r\n\r\nOld Kelly fished out a box which he put into Emily’s lap. She found a\r\ndainty little hairbrush in it.\r\n\r\n“Look at the back av it,” said Old Kelly. “You’ll see something\r\nhandsome--all the love charm ye’ll ever nade.”\r\n\r\nEmily turned it over. Her own face looked back at her from a little\r\ninset mirror surrounded by a scroll of painted roses.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Kelly--how pretty--I mean the roses and the glass,” she\r\ncried. “Is it really for me? Oh, thank you, thank you! Now, I can have\r\nEmily-in-the-glass whenever I want her. Why, I can carry her round with\r\nme. And you were really only in fun about the toads!”\r\n\r\n“Av coorse. Get up, my nag, get up. An’ so ye’re going to visit the\r\nould lady over at Praste Pond? Ever been there?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“It’s full of Prastes. Ye can’t throw a stone but ye hit one. And hit\r\none--hit all. They’re as proud and lofty as the Murrays themselves.\r\nThe only wan I know is Adam Praste--the others hold too high. He’s\r\nthe black shape and quite sociable. But if ye want to see how the\r\nworld looked on the morning after the flood go into his barnyard on\r\na rainy day. Look a-here, gurrl dear”--Old Kelly lowered his voice\r\nmysteriously--“don’t ye ever marry a Praste.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” asked Emily, who had never thought of marrying a Priest but\r\nwas immediately curious as to why she shouldn’t.\r\n\r\n“They’re ill to marry--ill to live with. The wives die young. The ould\r\nlady of the Grange fought her man out and buried him but she had the\r\nMurray luck. I wouldn’t trust it too far. The only dacent Praste among\r\nthem is the wan they call Jarback Praste and he’s too ould for you.”\r\n\r\n“Why do they call him Jarback?”\r\n\r\n“Wan av his shoulders is a l’il bit higher than the other. He’s got a\r\nbit of money and doesn’t be after having to work. A book worrum, I’m\r\nbelaving. Have ye got a bit av cold iron about you?”\r\n\r\n“No; why?”\r\n\r\n“Ye should have. Old Caroline Praste at the Grange is a witch if ever\r\nthere was one.”\r\n\r\n“Why, that’s what Ilse said. But there are no such thing as witches\r\nreally, Mr. Kelly.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe that’s thrue but it’s better to be on the safe side. Here, put\r\nthis horseshoe-nail in your pocket and don’t cross her if ye can help\r\nit. Ye don’t mind if I have a bit av a smoke, do ye?”\r\n\r\nEmily did not mind at all. It left her free to follow her own thoughts,\r\nwhich were more agreeable than Old Kelly’s talk of toads and witches.\r\nThe road from Blair Water to Priest Pond was a very lovely one,\r\nwinding along the gulf shore, crossing fir fringed rivers and inlets,\r\nand coming ever and anon on one of the ponds for which that part of\r\nthe north shore was noted--Blair Water, Derry Pond, Long Pond, Three\r\nPonds where three blue lakelets were strung together like three great\r\nsapphires held by a silver thread; and then Priest Pond, the largest\r\nof all, almost as round as Blair Water. As they drove down towards it\r\nEmily drank the scene in with avid eyes--as soon as possible she must\r\nwrite a description of it; she had packed the Jimmy blank book in her\r\nbox for just such purposes.\r\n\r\nThe air seemed to be filled with opal dust over the great pond and the\r\nbowery summer homesteads around it. A western sky of smoky red was\r\narched over the big Malvern Bay beyond. Little grey sails were drifting\r\nalong by the fir-fringed shores. A sequestered side road, fringed\r\nthickly with young maples and birches, led down to Wyther Grange. How\r\ndamp and cool the air was in the hollows! And how the ferns did smell!\r\nEmily was sorry when they reached Wyther Grange and climbed in between\r\nthe gateposts whereon the big stone dogs sat very stonily, looking grim\r\nenough in the twilight.\r\n\r\nThe wide hall door was open and a flood of light streamed out over the\r\nlawn. A little old woman was standing in it. Old Kelly seemed suddenly\r\nin something of a hurry. He swung Emily and her box to the ground,\r\nshook hands hastily and whispered, “Don’t lose that bit av a nail.\r\nGood-bye. I wish ye a cool head and a warm heart,” and was off before\r\nthe little old woman could reach them.\r\n\r\n“So this is Emily of New Moon!” Emily heard a rather shrill, cracked\r\nvoice saying. She felt a thin, claw-like hand grasp hers and draw her\r\ntowards the door. There were no witches, Emily knew,--but she thrust\r\nher hand into her pocket and touched the horseshoe-nail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nDEALS WITH GHOSTS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Your aunt is in the back parlor,” said Caroline Priest. “Come this\r\nway. Are you tired?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Emily, following Caroline and taking her in thoroughly.\r\nIf Caroline were a witch she was a very small one. She was really no\r\ntaller than Emily herself. She wore a black silk dress and a little\r\nstring cap of black net edged with black ruching on her yellowish\r\nwhite hair. Her face was more wrinkled than Emily had ever supposed a\r\nface could be and she had the peculiar grey-green eyes which, as Emily\r\nafterwards discovered, “ran” in the Priest clan.\r\n\r\n“You may be a witch,” thought Emily, “but I think I can manage _you_.”\r\n\r\nThey went through the spacious hall, catching glimpses on either side\r\nof large, dim, splendid rooms, then through the kitchen end out of it\r\ninto an odd little back hall. It was long and narrow and dark. On one\r\nside was a row of four, square, small-paned windows, on the other were\r\ncupboards, reaching from floor to ceiling, with doors of black shining\r\nwood. Emily felt like one of the heroines in Gothic romance, wandering\r\nat midnight through a subterranean dungeon, with some unholy guide. She\r\nhad read “The Mysteries of Udolpho” and “The Romance of the Forest”\r\nbefore the taboo had fallen on Dr. Burnley’s bookcase. She shivered. It\r\nwas awful but interesting.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the hall a flight of four steps led up to a door. Beside\r\nthe steps was an immense black grandfather’s clock reaching almost to\r\nthe ceiling.\r\n\r\n“We shut little girls up in that when they’re bad,” whispered\r\nCaroline, nodding at Emily, as she opened the door that led into the\r\nback parlour.\r\n\r\n“I’ll take good care you won’t shut _me_ up in it,” thought Emily.\r\n\r\nThe back parlour was a pretty, quaint old room where a table was laid\r\nfor supper. Caroline led Emily through it and knocked at another door,\r\nusing a quaint old brass knocker that was fashioned like a chessy-cat,\r\nwith such an irresistible grin that you wanted to grin, too, when you\r\nsaw it. Somebody said, “Come in,” and they went down another four\r\nsteps--was there ever such a funny house?--into a bedroom. And here at\r\nlast was Great-Aunt Nancy Priest, sitting in her arm-chair, with her\r\nblack stick leaning against her knee, and her tiny white hands, still\r\npretty, and sparkling with fine rings, lying on her purple silk apron.\r\n\r\nEmily felt a distinct shock of disappointment. After hearing that poem\r\nin which Nancy Murray’s beauty of nut-brown hair and starry brown eyes\r\nand cheek of satin rose had been be-rhymed she had somehow expected\r\nGreat-Aunt Nancy, in spite of her ninety years, to be beautiful still.\r\nBut Aunt Nancy was white-haired and yellow-skinned and wrinkled and\r\nshrunken, though her brown eyes were still bright and shrewd. Somehow,\r\nshe looked like an old fairy--an impish, tolerant old fairy, who might\r\nturn suddenly malevolent if you rubbed her the wrong way--only fairies\r\nnever wore long, gold-tasselled earrings that almost touched their\r\nshoulders, or white lace caps with purple pansies in them.\r\n\r\n“So this is Juliet’s girl!” she said, giving Emily one of her sparkling\r\nhands. “Don’t look so startled, child. I’m not going to kiss you. I\r\nnever held with inflicting kisses on defenseless creatures simply\r\nbecause they were so unlucky as to be my relatives. Now, who does she\r\nlook like, Caroline?”\r\n\r\nEmily made a mental grimace. Now for another ordeal of comparisons,\r\nwherein dead-and-gone noses and eyes and foreheads would be dragged\r\nout and fitted on her. She was thoroughly tired of having her looks\r\ntalked over in every gathering of the clans.\r\n\r\n“Not much like the Murrays,” said Caroline, peering so closely into\r\nher face that Emily involuntarily drew back. “Not so handsome as the\r\nMurrays.”\r\n\r\n“Nor the Starrs either. Her father was a handsome man--so handsome that\r\nI’d have run away with him myself if I’d been fifty years younger.\r\nThere’s nothing of Juliet in her that I can see. Juliet was pretty.\r\nYou are not as good-looking as that picture made you out but I didn’t\r\nexpect you would be. Pictures and epitaphs are never to be trusted.\r\nWhere’s your bang gone, Emily?”\r\n\r\n“Aunt Elizabeth combed it back.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you comb it down again while you’re in my house. There’s\r\nsomething of your Grandfather Murray about your eye-brows. Your\r\ngrandfather was a handsome man--and a darned bad-tempered one--almost\r\nas bad-tempered as the Priests,--hey, Caroline?”\r\n\r\n“If you please, Great-Aunt Nancy,” said Emily deliberately, “I don’t\r\nlike to be told I look like other people. I look just like myself.”\r\n\r\nAunt Nancy chuckled.\r\n\r\n“Spunk, I see. Good. I never cared for meek youngsters. So you’re not\r\nstupid, eh?”\r\n\r\n“No, I’m not.”\r\n\r\nGreat-Aunt Nancy grinned this time. Her false teeth looked uncannily\r\nwhite and young in her old, brown face.\r\n\r\n“Good. If you’ve brains it’s better than beauty--brains last, beauty\r\ndoesn’t. Me, for example. Caroline here, now, never had either brains\r\nnor beauty, had you, Caroline? Come, let’s go to supper. Thank\r\ngoodness, my stomach has stood by me if my good looks haven’t.”\r\n\r\nGreat-Aunt Nancy hobbled, by the aid of her stick, up the steps and\r\nover to the table. She sat at one end, Caroline at the other, Emily\r\nbetween, feeling rather uncomfortable. But the ruling passion was still\r\nstrong in her and she was already composing a description of them for\r\nthe blank book.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if anybody will be sorry when you die,” she thought, looking\r\nintently at Caroline’s wizened old face.\r\n\r\n“Come now, tell me,” said Aunt Nancy. “If you’re not stupid, why did\r\nyou write me such a stupid letter that first time. Lord, but it was\r\nstupid! I read it over to Caroline to punish her whenever she is\r\nnaughty.”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t write any other kind of a letter because Aunt Elizabeth\r\nsaid she was going to read it.”\r\n\r\n“Trust Elizabeth for that. Well, you can write what you like here--and\r\nsay what you like--and do what you like. Nobody will interfere with you\r\nor try to bring you up. I asked you for a visit, not for discipline.\r\nThought likely you’d have enough of that at New Moon. You can have\r\nthe run of the house and pick a beau to your liking from the Priest\r\nboys--not that the young fry are what they were in my time.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want a beau,” retorted Emily. She felt rather disgusted. Old\r\nKelly had ranted about beaux half the way over and here was Aunt Nancy\r\nbeginning on the same unnecessary subject.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you tell me,” said Aunt Nancy, laughing till her gold tassels\r\nshook. “There never was a Murray of New Moon that didn’t like a beau.\r\nWhen I was your age I had half a dozen. All the little boys in Blair\r\nWater were fighting about me. Caroline here now never had a beau in her\r\nlife, had you, Caroline?”\r\n\r\n“Never wanted one,” snapped Caroline.\r\n\r\n“Eighty and twelve say the same thing and both lie,” said Aunt Nancy.\r\n“What’s the use of being hypocrites among ourselves? I don’t say it\r\nisn’t well enough when men are about. Caroline, do you notice what\r\na pretty hand Emily has? As pretty as mine when I was young. And an\r\nelbow like a cat’s. Cousin Susan Murray had an elbow like that. It’s\r\nodd--she has more Murray points than Starr points and yet she looks\r\nlike the Starrs and not like the Murrays. What odd sums in addition we\r\nall are--the answer is never what you’d expect. Caroline, what a pity\r\nJarback isn’t home. He’d like Emily--I have a feeling he’d like Emily.\r\nJarback’s the only Priest that’ll ever go to heaven, Emily. Let’s have\r\na look at your ankles, puss.”\r\n\r\nEmily rather unwillingly put out her foot. Aunt Nancy nodded her\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n“Mary Shipley’s ankle. Only one in a generation has it. I had it. The\r\nMurray ankles are thick. Even your mother’s ankles were thick. Look at\r\nthat instep, Caroline. Emily, you’re not a beauty but if you learn to\r\nuse your eyes and hands and feet properly you’ll pass for one. The men\r\nare easily fooled and if the women say you’re not ’twill be held for\r\njealousy.”\r\n\r\nEmily decided that this was a good opportunity to find out something\r\nthat had puzzled her.\r\n\r\n“Old Mr. Kelly said I had come-hither eyes, Aunt Nancy. Have I? And\r\n_what_ are come-hither eyes?”\r\n\r\n“Jock Kelly’s an old ass. You haven’t come-hither eyes--it wouldn’t\r\nbe a Murray tradish.” Aunt Nancy laughed. “The Murrays have\r\nkeep-your-distance eyes--and so have you--though your lashes contradict\r\nthem a bit. But sometimes eyes like that--combined with certain\r\nother points--are quite as effective as come-hither eyes. Men go by\r\ncontraries oftener than not--if you tell them to keep off they’ll come\r\non. My own Nathaniel now--the only way to get him to do anything was to\r\ncoax him to do the opposite. Remember, Caroline? Have another cooky,\r\nEmily?”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t had one yet,” said Emily, rather resentfully.\r\n\r\nThose cookies looked very tempting and she had been wishing they might\r\nbe passed. She didn’t know why Aunt Nancy and Caroline both laughed.\r\nCaroline’s laugh was unpleasant--a dry, rusty sort of laugh--“no juice\r\nin it,” Emily decided. She thought she would write in her description\r\nthat Caroline had a “thin, rattling laugh.”\r\n\r\n“What do you think of us?” demanded Aunt Nancy. “Come now, what _do_\r\nyou think of us?”\r\n\r\nEmily was dreadfully embarrassed. She had just been thinking of writing\r\nthat Aunt Nancy looked “withered and shrivelled;” but one couldn’t say\r\nthat--one _couldn’t_.\r\n\r\n“Tell the truth and shame the devil,” said Aunt Nancy.\r\n\r\n“That isn’t a fair question,” cried Emily.\r\n\r\n“You think,” said Aunt Nancy, grinning, “that I’m a hideous old hag\r\nand that Caroline isn’t quite human. She isn’t. She never was--but you\r\nshould have seen _me_ seventy years ago. I was handsomest of all the\r\nhandsome Murrays. The men were mad about me. When I married Nat Priest\r\nhis three brothers could have cut his throat. One cut his own. Oh, I\r\nplayed havoc in my time. All I regret is I can’t live it over. ’Twas\r\na grand life while it lasted. I queened it over them. The women hated\r\nme, of course--all but Caroline here. You worshipped me, didn’t you,\r\nCaroline? And you worship me yet, don’t you, Caroline? Caroline, I\r\n_wish_ you didn’t have a wart on your nose.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you had one on your tongue,” said Caroline waspishly.\r\n\r\nEmily was beginning to feel tired and bewildered. It was\r\ninteresting--and Aunt Nancy was kind enough in her queer way; but at\r\nhome Ilse and Perry and Teddy would be foregathering in Lofty John’s\r\nbush for their evening revel, and Saucy Sal would be sitting on the\r\ndairy steps, waiting for Cousin Jimmy to give her the froth. Emily\r\nsuddenly realized that she was as homesick for New Moon as she had been\r\nfor Maywood her first night at New Moon.\r\n\r\n“The child’s tired,” said Aunt Nancy. “Take her to bed, Caroline. Put\r\nher in the Pink Room.”\r\n\r\nEmily followed Caroline through the back hall, through the kitchen,\r\nthrough the front hall, up the stairs, down a long hall, through a long\r\nside hall. Where on earth was she being taken? Finally they reached a\r\nlarge room. Caroline set down the lamp, and asked Emily if she had a\r\nnightgown.\r\n\r\n“Of course I have. Do you suppose Aunt Elizabeth would have let me come\r\nwithout one?”\r\n\r\nEmily was quite indignant.\r\n\r\n“Nancy says you can sleep as long as you like in the morning,” said\r\nCaroline. “Good-night. Nancy and I sleep in the old wing, of course,\r\nand the rest of us sleep well in our graves.”\r\n\r\nWith this cryptic remark Caroline trotted out and shut the door.\r\n\r\nEmily sat down on an embroidered ottoman and looked about her. The\r\nwindow curtains were of faded pink brocade and the walls were hung\r\nwith pink paper decorated with diamonds of rose chains. It made a very\r\npretty fairy paper, as Emily found by cocking her eyes at it. There was\r\na green carpet on the floor, so lavishly splashed with big pink roses\r\nthat Emily was almost afraid to walk on it. She decided that the room\r\nwas a very splendid one.\r\n\r\n“But I have to sleep here alone, so I must say my prayers very\r\ncarefully,” she reflected.\r\n\r\nShe undressed rather hastily, blew out the light and got into bed. She\r\ncovered herself up to her chin and lay there, staring at the high,\r\nwhite ceiling. She had grown so used to Aunt Elizabeth’s curtained\r\nbed that she felt curiously unsheltered in this low, modern one. But\r\nat least the window was wide open--evidently Aunt Nancy did not share\r\nAunt Elizabeth’s horror of night air. Through it Emily could see summer\r\nfields lying in the magic of a rising yellow moon. But the room was\r\nbig and ghostly. She felt horribly far away from everybody. She was\r\nlonesome--homesick. She thought of Old Kelly and his toad ointment.\r\nPerhaps he _did_ boil the toads alive after all. This hideous thought\r\ntormented her. It was _awful_ to think of toads--or anything--being\r\nboiled alive. She had never slept alone before. Suddenly she was\r\nfrightened. How the window rattled. It sounded terribly as if\r\nsomebody--or _something_--were trying to get in. She thought of Ilse’s\r\nghost--a ghost you couldn’t _see_ but could _hear_ and _feel_ was\r\nsomething especially spooky in the way of ghosts--she thought of the\r\nstone dogs that went “Wo--or--oo--oo” at midnight. A dog _did_ begin to\r\nhowl somewhere. Emily felt a cold perspiration on her brow. _What_ had\r\nCaroline meant about the rest of them sleeping well in their graves?\r\nThe floor creaked. Wasn’t there somebody--or _something_--tiptoeing\r\nround outside the door? Didn’t something move in the corner? There were\r\nmysterious sounds in the long hall.\r\n\r\n“I _won’t_ be scared,” said Emily. “I _won’t_ think of those things,\r\nand tomorrow I’ll write down all about how I feel now.”\r\n\r\nAnd then--she _did_ hear something--right behind the wall at the head\r\nof her bed. There was no mistake about it. It was not imagination. She\r\nheard distinctly strange uncanny rustles--as if stiff silk dresses\r\nwere rubbing against each other--as if fluttering wings fanned the\r\nair--and there were soft, low, muffled sounds like tiny children’s\r\ncries or moans. They lasted--they kept on. Now and then they would die\r\naway--then start up again.\r\n\r\nEmily cowered under the bedclothes, cold with real terror. Before, her\r\nfright had been only on the surface--she had _known_ there was nothing\r\nto fear, even while she feared. Something in her braced her to endure.\r\nBut _this_ was no mistake--no imagination. The rustles and flutterings\r\nand cries and moans were all too real. Wyther Grange suddenly became\r\na dreadful, uncanny place. Ilse was right--it _was_ haunted. And she\r\nwas all alone here, with miles of rooms and halls between her and any\r\nhuman being. It was cruel of Aunt Nancy to put her in a haunted room.\r\nAunt Nancy must have known it was haunted--cruel old Aunt Nancy with\r\nher ghoulish pride in men who had killed themselves for her. Oh, if\r\nshe were back in dear New Moon, with Aunt Elizabeth beside her. Aunt\r\nElizabeth was not an ideal bedfellow but she was flesh-and-blood. And\r\nif the windows were hermetically sealed they kept out spooks as well as\r\nnight air.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it won’t be so bad if I say my prayers over again,” thought\r\nEmily.\r\n\r\nBut even this didn’t help much.\r\n\r\nTo the end of her life Emily never forgot that first horrible night at\r\nWyther Grange. She was so tired that sometimes she dozed fitfully off\r\nonly to be awakened in a few minutes in panic horror, by the rustling\r\nand muffled moans behind her bed. Every ghost and groan, every tortured\r\nspirit and bleeding nun of the books she had read came into her mind.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Elizabeth was right--novels aren’t fit to read,” she thought.\r\n“Oh, I will die here--of fright--I know I will. I know I’m a coward--I\r\ncan’t be brave.”\r\n\r\nWhen morning came the room was bright with sunshine and free from\r\nmysterious sounds. Emily got up, dressed and found her way to the old\r\nwing. She was pale, with black-ringed eyes, but resolute.\r\n\r\n“Well, and how did you sleep?” asked Aunt Nancy graciously.\r\n\r\nEmily ignored the question.\r\n\r\n“I want to go home today,” she said.\r\n\r\nAunt Nancy stared.\r\n\r\n“Home? Nonsense! Are you such a homesick baby as that?”\r\n\r\n“I’m not homesick--not _very_--but I must go home.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t--there’s no one here to take you. You don’t expect Caroline\r\ncan drive you to Blair Water, do you?”\r\n\r\n“Then I will walk.”\r\n\r\nAunt Nancy thumped her stick angrily on the floor.\r\n\r\n“You will stay right here until I’m ready for you to go, Miss Puss. I\r\nnever tolerate any whims but my own. Caroline knows that, don’t you,\r\nCaroline? Sit down to your breakfast--and eat--_eat_.”\r\n\r\nAunt Nancy glared at Emily.\r\n\r\n“I won’t stay here,” said Emily. “I won’t stay another night in that\r\nhorrible haunted room. It was cruel of you to put me there. If--” Emily\r\ngave Aunt Nancy glare for glare--“if I was Salome I’d ask for _your_\r\nhead on a charger.”\r\n\r\n“Hoity-toity! What nonsense is this about a haunted room? We’ve no\r\nghosts at Wyther Grange. Have we, Caroline? We don’t consider them\r\nhygienic.”\r\n\r\n“You have something _dreadful_ in that room--it rustled and moaned and\r\ncried all night long right in the wall behind my bed. I won’t stay--I\r\nwon’t--.”\r\n\r\nEmily’s tears came in spite of her efforts to repress them. She was so\r\nunstrung nervously that she couldn’t help crying. It lacked but little\r\nof hysterics with her already.\r\n\r\nAunt Nancy looked at Caroline and Caroline looked back at Aunt Nancy.\r\n\r\n“We should have told her, Caroline. It’s all our fault. I clean\r\nforgot--it’s so long since any one slept in the Pink Room. No wonder\r\nshe was frightened. Emily, you poor child, it was a shame. It would\r\nserve me right to have my head on a charger, you vindictive scrap. We\r\nshould have told you.”\r\n\r\n“Told me--what?”\r\n\r\n“About the swallows in the chimney. That was what you heard. The big\r\ncentral chimney goes right up through the walls behind your bed. It is\r\nnever used now since the fireplaces were built in. The swallows nest\r\nthere--hundreds of them. They do make an uncanny noise--fluttering and\r\nquarrelling as they do.”\r\n\r\nEmily felt foolish and ashamed--much more ashamed than she needed to\r\nfeel, for her experience had really been a very trying one, and older\r\nfolks than she had been woefully frightened o’ nights in the Pink\r\nRoom at Wyther Grange. Nancy Priest _had_ put people into that room\r\nsometimes expressly to scare them. But to do her justice she really had\r\nforgotten in Emily’s case and was sorry.\r\n\r\nEmily said no more about going home; Caroline and Aunt Nancy were both\r\nvery kind to her that day; she had a good nap in the afternoon; and\r\nwhen the second night came she went straight to the Pink Room and slept\r\nsoundly the night through. The rustles and cries were as distinct as\r\never but swallows and spectres were two entirely different things.\r\n\r\n“After all, I think I’ll like Wyther Grange,” said Emily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nA DIFFERENT KIND OF HAPPINESS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         “JULY 20th.\r\n\r\n“DEAR FATHER:\r\n\r\n“I have been a fortnight at Wyther Grange and I have not written to you\r\nonce. But I thought of you every day. I had to write to Aunt Laura and\r\nIlse and Teddy and Cousin Jimmy and Perry and between times I am having\r\nsuch fun. The first night I was here I did not think I was going to be\r\nhappy. But I am--only it’s a different kind from New Moon happiness.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Nancy and Caroline are very good to me and let me do exactly as\r\nI like. This is very agreeable. They are very sarcastic to each other.\r\nBut I think they are a good bit like Ilse and me--they fight quite\r\nfrequently but love each other very hard between times. I am sure\r\nCaroline isn’t a witch but I would like to know what she thinks of\r\nwhen she is all alone by herself. Aunt Nancy is not pretty any longer\r\nbut she is very _aristocratic looking_. She doesn’t walk much because\r\nof her roomatism, so she sits mostly in her back parlor and reads and\r\nknits lace or plays cards with Caroline. I talk to her a great deal\r\nbecause she says it amuses her and I have told her a great many things\r\nbut I have never told her that I write poetry. If I did I know she\r\nwould make me recite it to her and I feel she is not the right person\r\nto recite your poetry to. And I do not talk about you or Mother to\r\nher, though she tries to make me. I told her all about Lofty John and\r\nhis bush and going to Father Cassidy. She chuckled over that and said\r\nshe always liked to talk to the Catholic Priests because they were the\r\nonly men in the world a woman could talk to for more than ten minutes\r\nwithout other women saying she was throwing herself at their heads.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Nancy says a great many things like that. She and Caroline talk\r\na great deal to each other about things that happened in the Priest\r\nand Murray families. I like to sit and listen. They don’t stop just as\r\nthings are getting interesting the way Aunt Elizabeth and Aunt Laura\r\ndo. A good many things I don’t understand but I will remember them and\r\nwill find out about them sometime. I have written descriptions of Aunt\r\nNancy and Caroline in my Jimmy-book. I keep the book hid behind the\r\nwardrobe in my room because I found Caroline rummidging in my trunk\r\none day. I must not call Aunt Nancy Great-Aunt. She says it makes her\r\nfeel like Methoosaleh. She tells me all about the men who were in love\r\nwith her. It seems to me they all behaved pretty much the same. I don’t\r\nthink that was exciting but she says it was. She tells me about all\r\nthe parties and dances they used to have here long ago. Wyther Grange\r\nis bigger than New Moon and the furniture is much handsomer but it is\r\nharder to feel acquainted with it.\r\n\r\n“There are many interesting things in this house. I love to look at\r\nthem. There is a Jakobite glass on a stand in the parlor. It was a\r\nglass _an old ansester_ of the Priests had long ago in Scotland and\r\nit has a thistle and a rose on it and they used it to drink Prince\r\nCharlie’s health with and for _no other purpose_. It is a very\r\n_valewable airloom_ and Aunt Nancy prizes it highly. And she has a\r\npickled snake in a big glass jar in the china cabinet. It is hideous\r\nbut fascinating. I shiver when I see it but yet I go to look at it\r\nevery day. Something seems to drag me to it. Aunt Nancy has a bureau\r\nin her room with _glass knobs_ and a vase shaped like a green fish\r\nsitting up on end and a Chinese draggon with a curly tail, and a case\r\nof sweet little stuffed humming birds and a sand-glass for boiling eggs\r\nby and a framed wreath made out of the hair of all the dead Priests\r\nand lots of old dagerrotipes. But the thing I like the best of all is\r\na great silvery shining ball hanging from the lamp in the parlour. It\r\nreflects everything like a little fairy world. Aunt Nancy calls it a\r\ngazing-ball, and says that when she is dead I am to have it. I wish\r\nshe hadn’t said that because I want the ball so much that I can’t help\r\nwondering when she will die and that makes me feel wicked. I am to\r\nhave the chessy-cat door knocker and her gold earrings, too. These are\r\nMurray airlooms. Aunt Nancy says the Priest airlooms must go to the\r\nPriests. I will like the chessy-cat but I don’t want the earrings. I’d\r\nrather not have people notice my ears.\r\n\r\n“I have to sleep alone. I feel frightened but I think if I could get\r\nover being frightened I’d like it. I don’t mind the swallows now. It’s\r\njust being alone so far away from any one. But it is lovely to be able\r\nto stretch out your legs just as you like and not have anybody scold\r\nyou for skwirming. And when I wake up in the night and think of a\r\nsplendid line of poetry (because the things that you think of like that\r\nalways seem the best) I can get right out of bed and write it right\r\ndown in my Jimmy-book. I couldn’t do that at home and then by morning\r\nI’d likely forget it. I thought of such a nice line last night. “Lilies\r\nlifted pearly chaluses (a chalus is a kind of cup only more poetical)\r\nwhere bees were drowned in sweetness” and I felt happy because I was\r\nsure they were two better lines than any I had composed yet.\r\n\r\n“I am allowed to go into the kitchen and help Caroline cook. Caroline\r\nis a good cook but sometimes she makes a mistake and this vexes Aunt\r\nNancy because she likes nice things to eat. The other day Caroline\r\nmade the barley soup far too thick and when Aunt Nancy looked at her\r\nplate she said “Lord, is this a dinner or a poltis?” Caroline said\r\n“It is good enough for a Priest and what is good enough for a Priest\r\nis good enough for a Murray,” and Aunt Nancy said “Woman, the Priests\r\neat of the crumbs that fall from the Murrays’ tables,” and Caroline\r\nwas so mad she cried. And Aunt Nancy said to me “Emily, never marry a\r\nPriest”--just like Old Kelly, when I have no notion of marrying one of\r\nthem. I don’t like any of them I’ve seen very much but they seem to me\r\na good deal like other people. Jim is the best of them but impident.\r\n\r\n“I like the Wyther Grange breakfasts better than the New Moon\r\nbreakfasts. We have toast and bacon and marmalade--nicer than porridge.\r\n\r\n“Sunday is more amusing here than at New Moon but not so holy. Nice\r\nfor a change. Aunt Nancy can’t go to church or knit lace so she and\r\nCaroline play cards all day but she says I must never do it--that\r\nshe is just a bad example. I love to look at Aunt Nancy’s big parlor\r\nBible because there are so many interesting things in it--pieces of\r\ndresses and hair and poetry and old tintipes and accounts of deaths\r\nand weddings. I found a piece about my own birth and it gave me a queer\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\n“In the afternoon some of the Priests come to see Aunt Nancy and stay\r\nto supper. Leslie Priest always comes. He is Aunt Nancy’s faverite\r\nneffew, so Jim says. I think that is because he pays her compliments.\r\nBut I saw him wink at Isaac Priest once when he paid her one. I don’t\r\nlike him. He treats me as if I was a meer child. Aunt Nancy says\r\nterrible things to them all but they just laugh. When they go away Aunt\r\nNancy makes fun of them to Caroline. Caroline doesn’t like it, because\r\nshe is a Priest and so she and Aunt Nancy always quarrel Sunday evening\r\nand don’t speak again till Monday morning.\r\n\r\n“I can read all the books in Aunt Nancy’s bookcase except the row on\r\nthe top shelf. I wonder why I can’t read them. Aunt Nancy said they\r\nwere French novels but I just peeped into one and it was English. I\r\nwonder if Aunt Nancy tells lies.\r\n\r\n“The place I love best is down at bay shore. Some parts of the shore\r\nare very steep and there are such nice, woodsy, _unexpected_ places\r\nall along it. I wander there and compose poetry. I miss Ilse and Teddy\r\nand Perry and Saucy Sal a great deal. I had a letter from Ilse today.\r\nShe wrote me that they couldn’t do anything more about the Midsummer\r\nNight’s Dream till I got back. It is nice to feel so necessary.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Nancy doesn’t like Aunt Elizabeth. She called her a “tyrant” one\r\nday and then she said “Jimmy Murray was a very clever boy. Elizabeth\r\nMurray killed his intellect in her temper--and nothing was done to her.\r\nIf she had killed his body she would have been a murderess. The other\r\nwas worse, if you ask me.” I do not like Aunt Elizabeth at times myself\r\nbut I felt, dear Father, that I must stand up for _my family_ and I\r\nsaid “I do not want to hear such things said of my Aunt Elizabeth.”\r\n\r\n“And I just gave Aunt Nancy a _look_. She said “Well, Saucebox, my\r\nbrother Archibald will never be dead as long as you’re alive. If you\r\ndon’t want to hear things don’t hang around when Caroline and I are\r\ntalking. I notice there are plenty of things you like to hear.”\r\n\r\n“This was sarcasm, dear Father, but still I feel Aunt Nancy likes me\r\nbut perhaps she will not like me very long. Jim Priest says she is\r\nfikkle and never liked anyone, even her husband, very long. But after\r\nshe has been sarcastic to me she always tells Caroline to give me a\r\npiece of pie so I don’t mind the sarcasm. She lets me have real tea,\r\ntoo. I like it. At New Moon Aunt Elizabeth won’t give me anything but\r\ncambric tea because it is best for my health. Aunt Nancy says the way\r\nto be healthy is to eat just what you want and never think about your\r\nstomach. But then she was never threttened with consumption. She says I\r\nneedn’t be a bit frightened of dying of consumption because I have too\r\nmuch ginger in me. That is a comforting thought. The only time I don’t\r\nlike Aunt Nancy is when she begins talking about the different parts of\r\nme and the effect they will have on the men. It makes me feel so silly.\r\n\r\n“I will write you oftener after this, dear Father. I feel I have been\r\nneglecting you.\r\n\r\n“P. S. I am afraid there are some mistakes in spelling in this letter.\r\nI forgot to bring my dictionary with me.\r\n\r\n                                           “JULY 22.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear Father, I am in a dreadful scrape. I don’t know what I am to\r\ndo. Oh, Father, I have broken Aunt Nancy’s Jakobite glass. It seems to\r\nme like a dreadful dream.\r\n\r\n“I went into the parlor today to look at the pickled snake and just as\r\nI was turning away my sleeve caught the Jakobite glass and over it went\r\non the harth and _shivered into fragments_. At first I rushed out and\r\nleft them there but afterwards I went back and carefully gathered them\r\nup and hid them in a box behind the sofa. Aunt Nancy never goes into\r\nthe parlor now and Caroline not very often and perhaps they may not\r\nmiss the glass until I go home. But it _haunts_ me. I keep thinking of\r\nit all the time and I cannot enjoy anything. I know Aunt Nancy will be\r\nfurious and never forgive me if she finds out. I could not sleep all\r\nnight for worrying about it. Jim Priest came down to play with me today\r\nbut he said there was no fun in me and went home. The Priests mostly\r\nsay what they think. Of course there was no fun in me. How could there\r\nbe? I wonder if it would do any good to pray about it. I don’t feel as\r\nif it would be right to pray because I am deceiving Aunt Nancy.\r\n\r\n                                           “JULY 24.\r\n\r\n“Dear Father, this is a very strange world. Nothing ever turns out\r\njust like what you expect. Last night I couldn’t sleep again. I was\r\nso worried. I thought I was a coward, and doing an underhanded thing\r\nand not living up to my tradishuns. At last it got so bad I couldn’t\r\nstand it. I can bear it when other people have a bad opinion of me but\r\nit hurts too much when I have a bad opinion of myself. So I got out of\r\nbed and went right back through all those halls to the back parlor.\r\nAunt Nancy was still there all alone playing Solitare. She said what\r\non earth was I out of bed for at such an hour. I just said, short and\r\nquick to get the worst over, “I broke your Jakobite glass yesterday\r\nand hid the pieces behind the sofa.” Then I waited for the _storm to\r\nburst_. Aunt Nancy said “What a blessing. I’ve often wanted to smash it\r\nbut never had the courage. All the Priest clan are waiting for me to\r\ndie to get that glass and quarrel over it and I’m tickled to think none\r\nof them can have it now and yet can’t pick a fuss with me over smashing\r\nit. Get off to bed and get your beauty sleep.” I said “And aren’t you\r\nmad at all, Aunt Nancy?” “If it had been a Murray airloom I’d have\r\ntorn up the turf” Aunt Nancy said. “But I don’t care a hoot about the\r\nPriest things.”\r\n\r\n“So I went back to bed, dear Father, and felt very releeved, but not so\r\nheroyik.\r\n\r\n“I had a letter from Ilse today. She says Saucy Sal has had kittens at\r\nlast. I feel that I ought to be home to see about them. Likely Aunt\r\nElizabeth will have them all drowned before I get back. I had a letter\r\nfrom Teddy too, not much of a letter but all filled with dear little\r\npictures of Ilse and Perry and the Tansy Patch and Lofty John’s bush.\r\nThey made me feel homesick.\r\n\r\n                                           “JULY 28.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Father dear, I have found out all about the mistery of Ilse’s\r\nmother. It is so terrible I can’t write it down even to you. I cannot\r\nbelieve it but Aunt Nancy says it is true. I did not think there could\r\nbe such terrible things in the world. No, I can’t believe it and I\r\nwon’t believe it no matter who says it is true. I _know_ Ilse’s mother\r\n_couldn’t_ have done anything like that. There must have been a fearful\r\nmistake somewhere. I am so unhappy and feel as if I could never be\r\nhappy any more. Last night I wept on my pillow, like the heroins in\r\nAunt Nancy’s books do.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n“SHE COULDN’T HAVE DONE IT”\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat-Aunt Nancy and Caroline Priest were wont to colour their grey\r\ndays with the remembered crimsons of old, long-past delights and\r\nmerry-makings, but they went further than this and talked over any\r\nnumber of old family histories before Emily with a total disregard of\r\nher youth. Loves, births, deaths, scandals, tragedies--anything that\r\ncame into their old heads. Nor did they spare details. Aunt Nancy\r\nrevelled in details. She forgot nothing, and sins and weaknesses that\r\ndeath had covered and time shown mercy to were ruthlessly dragged out\r\nand dissected by this ghoulish old lady.\r\n\r\nEmily was not quite certain whether she really liked it or not. It\r\n_was_ fascinating--it fed some dramatic hunger in her--but it made her\r\nfeel unhappy somehow, as if something very ugly were concealed in the\r\ndarkness of the pit they opened before her innocent eyes. As Aunt Laura\r\nhad said, her youth protected her to some extent, but it could not save\r\nher from a dreadful understanding of the pitiful story of Ilse’s mother\r\non the afternoon when it seemed good to Aunt Nancy to resurrect that\r\ntale of anguish and shame.\r\n\r\nEmily was curled up on the sofa in the back parlour, reading _The\r\nScottish Chiefs_ because it was a breathlessly hot July afternoon--too\r\nhot to haunt the bay shore. Emily was feeling very happy. The Wind\r\nWoman was ruffling over the big maple grove behind the Grange, turning\r\nthe leaves until every tree seemed to be covered with strange, pale,\r\nsilvery blossoms; fragrances drifted in from the garden; the world was\r\nlovely; she had had a letter from Aunt Laura saying that one of Saucy\r\nSal’s kittens had been saved for her. Emily had felt when Mike II died\r\nthat she would never want another cat. But now she found she did.\r\nEverything suited her very well; she was so happy that she should have\r\nsacrificed her dearest possession to the jealous gods if she had known\r\nanything about the old pagan belief.\r\n\r\nAunt Nancy was tired of playing solitaire. She pushed the cards away\r\nand took up her knitting.\r\n\r\n“Emily,” she said, “has your Aunt Laura any notion of marrying Dr.\r\nBurnley?”\r\n\r\nEmily, recalled thus abruptly from the field of Bannockburn, looked\r\nbored. Blair Water gossip had often asked or hinted this question; and\r\nnow it met her in Priest Pond.\r\n\r\n“No, I’m sure she hasn’t,” she said. “Why, Aunt Nancy, Dr. Burnley\r\n_hates_ women.”\r\n\r\nAunt Nancy chuckled.\r\n\r\n“Thought perhaps he’d got over that. It’s eleven years now since his\r\nwife ran away. Few men hold to one idea for anything like eleven years.\r\nBut Allan Burnley always was stubborn in anything--love or hate. He\r\nstill loves his wife--and that is why he hates her memory and all other\r\nwomen.”\r\n\r\n“I never heard the rights of that story,” said Caroline. “Who was his\r\nwife?”\r\n\r\n“Beatrice Mitchell--one of the Shrewsbury Mitchells. She was only\r\neighteen when Allan married her. He was thirty-five. Emily, never you\r\nbe fool enough to marry a man much older than yourself.”\r\n\r\nEmily said nothing. _The Scottish Chiefs_ was forgotten. Her\r\nfinger-tips were growing cold as they always did in excitement, her\r\neyes turning black. She felt that she was on the verge of solving the\r\nmystery that had so long worried and puzzled her. She was desperately\r\nafraid that Aunt Nancy would branch off to something else.\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard she was a great beauty,” said Caroline.\r\n\r\nAunt Nancy sniffed.\r\n\r\n“Depends on your taste in style. Oh, she was pretty--one of your\r\ngolden-haired dolls. She had a little birthmark over her left\r\neyebrow--just like a tiny red heart--I never could see anything but\r\nthat mark when I looked at her. But her flatterers told her it was a\r\nbeauty spot--‘the Ace of Hearts’ they called her. Allan was mad about\r\nher. She had been a flirt before her marriage. But I _will_ say--for\r\njustice among women is a rare thing, Caroline--_you_, for instance, are\r\nan unjust old hag--that she didn’t flirt after marrying--openly, at\r\nleast. She was a sly puss--always laughing and singing and dancing--no\r\nwife for Allan Burnley if you ask me. And he could have had Laura\r\nMurray. But between a fool and a sensible woman did a man ever\r\nhesitate? The fool wins every time, Caroline. That’s why _you_ never\r\ngot a husband. You were too sensible. I got mine by pretending to be a\r\nfool. Emily, you remember that. You have brains--hide them. Your ankles\r\nwill do more for you than your brains ever will.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind Emily’s ankles,” said Caroline, keen on a scandal hunt. “Go\r\non about the Burnleys.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there was a cousin of hers--Leo Mitchell from Shrewsbury. You\r\nremember the Mitchells, don’t you, Caroline? This Leo was a handsome\r\nfellow--a sea-captain. He had been in love with Beatrice, so gossip\r\nran. Some said Beatrice wanted him but that her people made her marry\r\nAllan Burnley because he was the better match. Who knows? Gossip lies\r\nnine times and tells a half truth the tenth. She pretended to be in\r\nlove with Allan anyhow, and he believed it. When Leo came home from a\r\nvoyage and found Beatrice married he took it coolly enough. But he was\r\nalways over at Blair Water. Beatrice had plenty of excuses. Leo was her\r\ncousin--they had been brought up together--they were like brother and\r\nsister--she was so lonesome in Blair Water after living in a town--he\r\nhad no home except with a brother. Allan took it all down--he was so\r\ninfatuated with her she could have made him believe anything. She and\r\nLeo were always together there when Allan was away seeing his patients.\r\nThen came the night Leo’s vessel--_The Lady of Winds_--was to sail from\r\nBlair Harbour for South America. He went--and my lady Beatrice went\r\nwith him.”\r\n\r\nA queer little strangled sound came from Emily’s corner. If Aunt Nancy\r\nor Caroline had looked at her they would have seen that the child was\r\nwhite as the dead, with wide, horror-filled eyes. But they did not\r\nlook. They knitted and gossiped on, enjoying themselves hugely.\r\n\r\n“How did the doctor take it?” asked Caroline.\r\n\r\n“Take it--take it--nobody knows. Everybody knows what kind of a man\r\nhe’s been ever since, though. He came home that night at dusk. The baby\r\nwas asleep in its crib and the servant girl was watching it. She told\r\nAllan that Mrs. Burnley had gone to the harbour with her cousin for a\r\ngood-bye walk and would be back at ten. Allan waited for her easily\r\nenough--he never doubted her--but she didn’t come back. She had never\r\nintended to come back. In the morning _The Lady of Winds_ was gone--had\r\nsailed out of the harbour at dark the night before. Beatrice had gone\r\non board with him--that was all anybody knew. Allan Burnley _said_\r\nnothing, beyond forbidding her name ever to be mentioned in his hearing\r\nagain. But _The Lady of Winds_ was lost with all on board off Hatteras\r\nand that was the end of that elopement, and the end of Beatrice with\r\nher beauty and her laughter and her Ace of Hearts.”\r\n\r\n“But not the end of the shame and wretchedness she brought to her\r\nhome,” said Caroline shrewishly. “I’d tar and feather such a woman.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense--if a man can’t look after his wife--if he blinds his own\r\neyes-- Mercy on us, child, what is the matter?”\r\n\r\nFor Emily was standing up, holding out her hands as if pushing some\r\nloathly thing from her.\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe it,” she cried, in a high, unnatural voice. “I don’t\r\nbelieve Ilse’s mother did _that_. She didn’t--she couldn’t have--not\r\nIlse’s _mother_.”\r\n\r\n“Catch her, Caroline!” cried Aunt Nancy.\r\n\r\nBut Emily, though the back parlour had whirled about her for a second,\r\nhad recovered herself.\r\n\r\n“Don’t touch me!” she cried passionately. “Don’t touch me!\r\nYou--you--you _liked_ hearing that story!”\r\n\r\nShe rushed out of the room. Aunt Nancy looked ashamed for a moment. For\r\nthe first time it occurred to her that her scandal-loving old tongue\r\nhad done a black thing. Then she shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n“She can’t go through life in cotton wool. Might as well learn spades\r\nare spades now as ever. I would have thought she’d have heard it all\r\nlong ago if Blair Water gossip is what it used to be. If she goes home\r\nand tells this I’ll have the indignant virgins of New Moon coming down\r\non me in holy horror as a corrupter of youth. Caroline, don’t you ask\r\nme to tell you any more family horrors before my niece, you scandalous\r\nold woman. At your age! I’m surprised at you!”\r\n\r\nAunt Nancy and Caroline returned to their knitting and their spicy\r\nreminiscences, and upstairs in the Pink Room Emily lay face downwards\r\non her bed and cried for hours. It was so horrible--Ilse’s mother\r\nhad run away and left her little baby. To Emily that was the awful\r\nthing--the strange, cruel, heartless thing that Ilse’s mother had done.\r\nShe could not bring herself to believe it--there was some mistake\r\nsomewhere--there _was_.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps she was kidnapped,” said Emily, trying desperately to explain\r\nit. “She just went on board to look around--and he weighed anchor and\r\ncarried her off. She _couldn’t_ have gone away of her own accord and\r\nleft her dear little baby.”\r\n\r\nThe story haunted Emily in good earnest. She could think of nothing\r\nelse for days. It took possession of her and worried and gnawed at her\r\nwith an almost physical pain. She dreaded going back to New Moon and\r\nmeeting Ilse with this consciousness of a dark secret which she must\r\nhide from her. Ilse knew nothing. She had asked Ilse once where her\r\nmother was buried and Ilse had said, “Oh, I don’t know. At Shrewsbury,\r\nI guess--that’s where all the Mitchells are buried.”\r\n\r\nEmily wrung her slim hands together. She was as sensitive to ugliness\r\nand pain as she was to beauty and pleasure, and this thing was both\r\nhideous and agonizing. Yet she could not keep from thinking about it,\r\nday and night. Life at Wyther Grange suddenly went stale. Aunt Nancy\r\nand Caroline all at once gave up talking family history, even harmless\r\nhistory, before her. And as it was painful repression for them, they\r\ndid not encourage her hanging round. Emily began to feel that they\r\nwere glad when she was out of hearing, so she kept away and spent\r\nmost of her days wandering on the bay shore. She could not compose\r\nany poetry--she could not write in her Jimmy-book--she could not even\r\nwrite to her father. Something seemed to hang between her and her old\r\ndelights. There was a drop of poison in every cup. Even the filmy\r\nshadows on the great bay, the charm of its fir-hung cliffs and its\r\nlittle purple islets that looked like outposts of fairyland, could not\r\nbring to her the old “fine, careless rapture.” She was afraid she could\r\nnever be happy again--so intense had been her reaction to her first\r\nrevelation of the world’s sin and sorrow. And under it all, persisted\r\nthe same incredulity--Ilse’s mother _couldn’t_ have done it--and the\r\nsame helpless longing to prove she couldn’t have done it. But how could\r\nit be proved? It couldn’t. She had solved one “mystery” but she had\r\nstumbled into a darker one--the reason why Beatrice Burnley had never\r\ncome back on that summer twilight of long ago. For, all the evidence of\r\nfacts to the contrary notwithstanding, Emily persisted in her secret\r\nbelief that whatever the reason _was_, it was _not_ that she had gone\r\naway in _The Lady of Winds_ when that doomed ship sailed out into the\r\nstarlit wonder of the gulf beyond Blair Harbour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nON THE BAY SHORE\r\n\r\n\r\n“I wonder,” thought Emily, “how much longer I have to live.”\r\n\r\nShe had prowled that evening further down the bay shore than she had\r\never gone before. It was a warm, windy evening; the air was resinous\r\nand sweet; the bay a misty turquoise. That part of the shore whereon\r\nshe found herself seemed as lonely and virgin as if no human foot had\r\never trodden it, save for a tiny, tricksy path, slender as red thread\r\nand bordered by great, green, velvety sheets of moss, that wound in\r\nand out of the big firs and scrub spruces. The banks grew steeper and\r\nrockier as she went on and finally the little path vanished altogether\r\nin a plot of bracken. Emily was just turning to go back when she caught\r\nsight of a magnificent spray of farewell summer, growing far out on the\r\nedge of the bank. She must get it--she had never seen farewell-summers\r\nof so dark and rich a purple. She stepped out to reach them--the\r\ntreacherous mossy soil gave way under her feet and slid down the steep\r\nslope. Emily made a frantic attempt to scramble back but the harder she\r\ntried, the faster went the landslide, carrying her with it. In a moment\r\nit would pass the slope and go over the brink of the rocks, straight\r\nto the boulder-strewn shore thirty feet below. Emily had one dreadful\r\nmoment of terror and despair; and then she found that the clump of\r\nmossy earth which had broken away had held on a narrow ledge of rock,\r\nhalf hanging over it; and she was lying on the clump. It seemed to her\r\nthat the slightest movement on her part would send it over, straight to\r\nthe cruel boulders underneath.\r\n\r\nShe lay very still, trying to think--trying not to be afraid. She was\r\nfar, far away from any house--nobody could hear her if she screamed.\r\nAnd she did not even dare to scream lest the motion of her body\r\ndislodge the fragment on which she lay. How long could she lie there\r\nmotionless? Night was coming on. Aunt Nancy would grow anxious when\r\nthe dark fell and would send Caroline to look for her. But Caroline\r\nwould never find her here. Nobody would ever think of looking here for\r\nher, so far away from the Grange, in the spruce barrens of the Lower\r\nBay. To lie there alone all night--to fancy the earth was slipping\r\nover--waiting for help that would never come--Emily could hardly\r\nrestrain a shudder that might have been ruinous.\r\n\r\nShe had faced death once before, or thought she had, on the night when\r\nLofty John had told her she had eaten a poisoned apple--but this was\r\neven harder. To die here, all alone, far away from home! They might\r\nnever know what had become of her--never find her. The crows or the\r\ngulls would pick her eyes out. She dramatized the thing so vividly that\r\nshe almost screamed with the horror of it. She would just disappear\r\nfrom the world as Ilse’s mother had disappeared.\r\n\r\n_What had become of Ilse’s mother?_ Even in her own desperate plight\r\nEmily asked herself that question. And she would never see dear New\r\nMoon again and Teddy and the dairy and the Tansy Patch and Lofty\r\nJohn’s bush and the mossy old sundial and her precious little heap of\r\nmanuscripts on the sofa shelf in the garret.\r\n\r\n“I must be very brave and patient,” she thought. “My only chance is to\r\nlie still. And I can pray in my mind--I’m sure God can hear thoughts as\r\nwell as words. It is nice to think He can hear me if nobody else can.\r\nO God--Father’s God--please work a miracle and save my life, because I\r\ndon’t think I’m fit to die yet. Excuse my not being on my knees--You\r\ncan see I can’t move. And if I die please don’t let Aunt Elizabeth find\r\nmy letter-bills ever. Please let Aunt Laura find them. And please don’t\r\nlet Caroline move out the wardrobe when she house-cleans because then\r\nshe would find my Jimmy-book and read what I wrote about her. Please\r\nforgive all my sins, especially not being grateful enough and cutting a\r\nbang, and please don’t let Father be very far away. Amen.”\r\n\r\nThen, characteristically she thought of a postscript. “And oh, _please_\r\nlet somebody find out that Ilse’s mother didn’t do _that_.”\r\n\r\nShe lay very still. The light on the water began to turn warm gold and\r\nrose. A great pine on a bluff in front of her overflowed in a crest of\r\ndark boughs against the amber splendour behind it--a part of the beauty\r\nof the beautiful world that was slipping away from her. The chill of\r\nthe evening gulf breeze began to creep over her. Once a bit of earth\r\nbroke off at her side and went down--Emily heard the thud of the little\r\npebbles in it on the boulders below. The portion upon which one of her\r\nlegs lay was quite loose and pendent also. She knew it might break off,\r\ntoo, at any moment. It would be very dreadful to be there when it got\r\ndark. She could see the big spray of farewell-summer that had lured her\r\nto her doom, waving unplucked above her, wonderfully purple and lovely.\r\n\r\nThen, beside it, she saw a man’s face looking down at her!\r\n\r\nShe heard him say, “My God!” softly to himself. She saw that he was\r\nslight and that one shoulder was a trifle higher than the other. This\r\nmust be Dean Priest--Jarback Priest. Emily dared not call to him. She\r\nlay still and her great, grey-purple eyes said, “Save me.”\r\n\r\n“How can I help you?” said Dean Priest hoarsely, as if to himself. “I\r\ncannot reach you--and it looks as if the slightest touch or jar would\r\nsend that broken earth over the brink. I must go for a rope--and to\r\nleave you here alone--like this. Can you wait, child?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” breathed Emily. She smiled at him to encourage him--the little\r\nsoft smile that began at the corners of her mouth and spread over her\r\nface. Dean Priest never forgot that smile--and the steadfast child-eyes\r\nlooking out through it from the little face that seemed so perilously\r\nnear the brink.\r\n\r\n“I’ll be as quick as I can,” he said. “I can’t go very fast--I’m a bit\r\nlame, you see. But don’t be frightened--I’ll save you. I’ll leave my\r\ndog to keep you company. Here, Tweed.”\r\n\r\nHe whistled--a great, tawny-gold dog came in sight.\r\n\r\n“Sit right there, Tweed, till I come back. Don’t stir a paw--don’t wag\r\na tail--talk to her only with your eyes.”\r\n\r\nTweed sat down obediently and Dean Priest disappeared.\r\n\r\nEmily lay there and dramatized the whole incident for her Jimmy-book.\r\nShe was a little frightened still, but not too frightened to see\r\nherself writing it all out the next day. It would be quite a thrilling\r\nbit.\r\n\r\nShe liked to know the big dog was there. She was not so learned in\r\nlore of dogs as in lore of cats. But he looked very human and trusty\r\nwatching her with great kindly eyes. A grey kitten was an adorable\r\nthing--but a grey kitten would not have sat there and encouraged her.\r\n“I believe,” thought Emily, “that a dog is better than a cat when\r\nyou’re in trouble.”\r\n\r\nIt was half an hour before Dean Priest returned.\r\n\r\n“Thank God you haven’t gone over,” he muttered. “I hadn’t to go as far\r\nas I feared--I found a rope in an empty boat up-shore and took it. And\r\nnow--if I drop the rope down to you, are you strong enough to hold it\r\nwhile the earth goes and then hang on while I pull you up?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll try,” said Emily.\r\n\r\nDean Priest knotted a loop at the end and slid it down to her. Then he\r\nwound the rope around the trunk of a heavy fir.\r\n\r\n“Now,” he said.\r\n\r\nEmily said inwardly, “Dear God, _please_--” and caught the swaying\r\nloop. The next moment the full weight of her body swung from it, for at\r\nher first movement the broken soil beneath her slipped down--slipped\r\nover. Dean Priest sickened and shivered. Could she cling to the rope\r\nwhile he drew her up?\r\n\r\nThen he saw she had got a little knee-hold on the narrow shelf.\r\nCarefully he drew on the rope. Emily, full of pluck, helped him by\r\ndigging her toes into the crumbling bank. In a moment she was within\r\nhis reach. He grasped her arms and pulled her up beside him into\r\nsafety. As he lifted her past the farewell-summer Emily reached out her\r\nhand and broke off the spray.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got it, anyhow,” she said jubilantly. Then she remembered her\r\nmanners. “I’m much obliged to you. You saved my life. And--and--I think\r\nI’ll sit down a moment. My legs feel funny and trembly.”\r\n\r\nEmily sat down, all at once more shaky than she had been through all\r\nthe danger. Dean Priest leaned against the gnarled old fir. He seemed\r\n“trembly” too. He wiped his forehead with his handkerchief. Emily\r\nlooked curiously at him. She had learned a good deal about him from\r\nAunt Nancy’s casual remarks--not always good-natured remarks, for\r\nAunt Nancy did not wholly like him, it seemed. She always called him\r\n“Jarback” rather contemptuously, while Caroline scrupulously called him\r\nDean. Emily knew he had been to college, that he was thirty-six years\r\nold--which to Emily seemed a venerable age--and well-off; that he had a\r\nmalformed shoulder and limped slightly; that he cared for nothing save\r\nbooks nor ever had; that he lived with an older brother and travelled\r\na great deal; and that the whole Priest clan stood somewhat in awe of\r\nhis ironic tongue. Aunt Nancy had called him a “cynic.” Emily did not\r\nknow what a cynic was but it sounded interesting. She looked him over\r\ncarefully and saw that he had delicate, pale features and tawny-brown\r\nhair. His lips were thin and sensitive, with a whimsical curve. She\r\nliked his mouth. Had she been older she would have known why--because\r\nit connoted strength and tenderness and humour.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his twisted shoulder there was about him a certain aloof\r\ndignity of presence which was characteristic of many of the Priests and\r\nwhich was often mistaken for pride. The green Priest eyes, that were\r\npeering and uncanny in Caroline’s face and impudent in Jim Priest’s,\r\nwere remarkably dreamy and attractive in his.\r\n\r\n“Well, do you think me handsome?” he said, sitting down on another\r\nstone and smiling at her. His voice was beautiful--musical and\r\ncaressing.\r\n\r\nEmily blushed. She knew staring was not etiquette, and she did not\r\nthink him at all handsome, so she was very thankful that he did not\r\npress his question, but asked another.\r\n\r\n“Do you know who your knightly rescuer is?”\r\n\r\n“I think you must be Jar--Mr. Dean Priest.” Emily flushed again with\r\nvexation. She had come so near to making another terrible hole in her\r\nmanners.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Jarback Priest. You needn’t mind the nickname. I’ve heard\r\nit often enough. It’s a Priest idea of humour.” He laughed rather\r\nunpleasantly. “The reason for it is obvious enough, isn’t it? I never\r\ngot anything else at school. How came you to slide over that cliff?”\r\n\r\n“I wanted this,” said Emily, waving her farewell-summer.\r\n\r\n“And you have it! Do you always get what you go after, even with death\r\nslipping a thin wedge between? I think you’re born lucky. I see the\r\nsigns. If that big aster lured you into danger it saved you as well,\r\nfor it was through stepping over to investigate it that I saw you. Its\r\nsize and colour caught my eye. Otherwise I should have gone on and\r\nyou--what would have become of you? Whom do you belong to that you are\r\nlet risk your life on these dangerous banks? What is your name--if you\r\nhave a name! I begin to doubt you--I see you have pointed ears. Have I\r\nbeen tricked into meddling with fairies, and will I discover presently\r\nthat twenty years have passed and that I am an old man long since\r\nlost to the living world with nothing but the skeleton of my dog for\r\ncompany?”\r\n\r\n“I am Emily Byrd Starr of New Moon,” said Emily, rather coldly. She was\r\nbeginning to be sensitive about her ears. Father Cassidy had remarked\r\non them--and now Jarback Priest. Was there really something uncanny\r\nabout them?\r\n\r\nAnd yet there was a flavour about the said Jarback that she\r\nliked--liked decidedly. Emily never was long in doubt about any one\r\nshe met. In a few minutes she always knew whether she liked, disliked,\r\nor was indifferent to them. She had a queer feeling that she had known\r\nJarback Priest for years--perhaps because it had seemed so long when\r\nshe was lying on that crumbling earth waiting for him to return. He\r\nwas not handsome but she liked that lean, clever face of his with its\r\nmagnetic green eyes.\r\n\r\n“So you’re the young lady visitor at the Grange!” said Dean Priest,\r\nin some astonishment. “Then my dear Aunt Nancy should look after you\r\nbetter--my _very_ dear Aunt Nancy.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t like Aunt Nancy, I see,” said Emily coolly.\r\n\r\n“What is the use of liking a lady who won’t like me? You have probably\r\ndiscovered by this time that my Lady Aunt detests me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t think it’s as bad as that,” said Emily. “She must have\r\nsome good opinions about you--she says you’re the only Priest who will\r\never go to heaven.”\r\n\r\n“She doesn’t mean that as a compliment, whatever you in your innocence\r\nbelieve it to be. And you are Douglas Starr’s daughter? I knew your\r\nfather. We were boys together at Queen’s Academy--we drifted apart\r\nafter we left it--he went into journalism, I to McGill. But he was the\r\nonly friend I had at school--the only boy who would bother himself\r\nabout Jarback Priest, who was lame and hunchbacked and couldn’t play\r\nfootball or hockey. Emily Byrd Starr--Starr should be your first name.\r\nYou look like a star--you have a radiant sort of personality shining\r\nthrough you--your proper habitat should be the evening sky just after\r\nsunset--or the morning sky just before sunrise. Yes. You’d be more at\r\nhome in the morning sky. I think I shall call you Star.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean that you think me pretty?” asked Emily directly.\r\n\r\n“Why, it hadn’t occurred to me to wonder whether you were pretty or\r\nnot. Do you think a star should be pretty?”\r\n\r\nEmily reflected.\r\n\r\n“No,” she said finally, “the word doesn’t suit a star.”\r\n\r\n“I perceive you are an artist in words. Of course it doesn’t. Stars are\r\nprismatic--palpitating--elusive. It is not often we find one made flesh\r\nand blood. I think I’ll wait for you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m ready to go now,” said Emily, standing up.\r\n\r\n“H’m. That wasn’t what I meant. Never mind. Come along, Star--if you\r\ndon’t mind walking a bit slowly. I’ll take you back from the wilderness\r\nat least--I don’t know that I’ll venture to Wyther Grange to-night.\r\nI don’t want Aunt Nancy to take the edge off _you_. And so you don’t\r\nthink me handsome?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t say so,” cried Emily.\r\n\r\n“Not in words. But I can read your thoughts, Star--it won’t ever do\r\nto think anything you don’t want me to know. The gods gave me that\r\ngift--when they kept back everything else I wanted. You don’t think me\r\nhandsome but you think me nice. Do you think you are pretty yourself?”\r\n\r\n“A little--since Aunt Nancy lets me wear my bang,” said Emily frankly.\r\n\r\nJarback Priest made a grimace.\r\n\r\n“Don’t call it by such a name. It’s a worse name even than bustle.\r\nBangs and bustles--they hurt me. I like that black wave breaking on\r\nyour white brows--but don’t call it a bang--ever again.”\r\n\r\n“It _is_ a very ugly word. I never use it in my poetry, of course.”\r\n\r\nWhereby Dean Priest discovered that Emily wrote poetry. He also\r\ndiscovered pretty nearly everything else about her in that charming\r\nwalk back to Priest Pond in the fir-scented dusk, with Tweed walking\r\nbetween them, his nose touching his master’s hand softly every now and\r\nthen, while the robins in the trees above them whistled blithely in the\r\nafterlight.\r\n\r\nWith nine out of ten people Emily was secretive and reserved, but Dean\r\nPriest was sealed of her tribe and she divined it instantly. He had a\r\nright to the inner sanctuary and she yielded it unquestioningly. She\r\ntalked to him freely.\r\n\r\nBesides, she felt _alive_ again--she felt the wonderful thrill of\r\nliving again, after that dreadful space when she had seemed to\r\nhang between life and death. She felt, as she wrote to her father\r\nafterwards, “as if a little bird was singing in my heart.” And oh, how\r\ngood the green sod felt under her feet!\r\n\r\nShe told him all about herself and her doings and beings. Only one\r\nthing she did not tell him--her worry over Ilse’s mother. _That_ she\r\ncould not speak of to any one. Aunt Nancy need not have been frightened\r\nthat she would carry tales to New Moon.\r\n\r\n“I wrote a whole poem yesterday when it rained and I couldn’t get out,”\r\nshe said. “It began,\r\n\r\n    I sit by the western window\r\n    That looks on Malvern Bay--”\r\n\r\n“Am I not to hear the whole of it?” asked Dean, who knew perfectly well\r\nthat Emily was hoping that he would ask it.\r\n\r\nEmily delightedly repeated the whole poem. When she came to the two\r\nlines she liked best in it,\r\n\r\n    Perhaps in those wooded islands\r\n      That gem the proud bay’s breast--\r\n\r\nshe looked up sidewise at him to see if he admired them. But he was\r\nwalking with eyes cast down and an absent expression on his face. She\r\nfelt a little disappointed.\r\n\r\n“H’m,” he said when she had finished. “You’re twelve, didn’t you say?\r\nWhen you’re ten years older I shouldn’t wonder--but let’s not think of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Father Cassidy told me to keep on,” cried Emily.\r\n\r\n“There was no need of it. You _would_ keep on anyhow--you have the itch\r\nfor writing born in you. It’s quite incurable. What are you going to do\r\nwith it?”\r\n\r\n“I think I shall be either a great poetess or a distinguished\r\nnovelist,” said Emily reflectively.\r\n\r\n“Having only to choose,” remarked Dean dryly. “Better be a novelist--I\r\nhear it pays better.”\r\n\r\n“What worries me about writing novels,” confided Emily, “is the love\r\ntalk in them. I’m sure I’ll never be able to write it. I’ve tried,” she\r\nconcluded candidly, “and I can’t think of _anything_ to say.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry about that. _I’ll_ teach you some day,” said Dean.\r\n\r\n“Will you--will you really?” Emily was very eager. “I’ll be so obliged\r\nif you will. I _think_ I could manage _everything_ else very nicely.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a bargain then--don’t forget it. And don’t go looking for another\r\nteacher, mind. What do you find to do at the Grange besides writing\r\npoetry? Are you never lonesome with only those two old survivals?”\r\n\r\n“No. I enjoy my own company,” said Emily gravely.\r\n\r\n“You would. Stars are said to dwell apart, anyhow, sufficient unto\r\nthemselves--ensphered in their own light. Do you really like Aunt\r\nNancy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed. She is very kind to me. She doesn’t make me wear\r\nsunbonnets and she lets me go barefooted in the forenoons. But I have\r\nto wear my buttoned boots in the afternoons, and I hate buttoned boots.”\r\n\r\n“Naturally. You should be shod with sandals of moonshine and wear a\r\nscarf of sea-mist with a few fireflies caught in it over your hair.\r\nStar, you don’t look like your father, but you suggest him in several\r\nways. Do you look like your mother? I never saw her.”\r\n\r\nAll at once Emily smiled demurely. A real sense of humour was born in\r\nher at that moment. Never again was she to feel quite so unmixedly\r\ntragic over anything.\r\n\r\n“No,” she said, “it’s only my eyelashes and smile that are like\r\nMother’s. But I’ve got Father’s forehead, and Grandma Starr’s hair\r\nand eyes, and Great-Uncle George’s nose, and Aunt Nancy’s hands, and\r\nCousin Susan’s elbows, and Great-great-Grandmother Murray’s ankles, and\r\nGrandfather Murray’s eyebrows.”\r\n\r\nDean Priest laughed.\r\n\r\n“A rag-bag--as we all are,” he said. “But your soul is your own, and\r\nfire-new, I’ll swear to that.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m so glad I like you,” said Emily impulsively. “It would be\r\n_hateful_ to think any one I didn’t like had saved my life. I don’t\r\nmind _your_ saving it a bit.”\r\n\r\n“That’s good. Because you see your life belongs to me henceforth. Since\r\nI saved it it’s mine. Never forget that.”\r\n\r\nEmily felt an odd sensation of rebellion. She didn’t fancy the idea\r\nof her life belonging to anybody but herself--not even to anybody she\r\nliked as much as she liked Dean Priest. Dean, watching her, saw it and\r\nsmiled his whimsical smile that always seemed to have so much more in\r\nit than mere smiling.\r\n\r\n“That doesn’t quite suit you? Ah, you see one pays a penalty when one\r\nreaches out for something beyond the ordinary. One pays for it in\r\nbondage of some kind or other. Take your wonderful aster home and keep\r\nit as long as you can. It has cost you your freedom.”\r\n\r\nHe was laughing--he was only joking, of course--yet Emily felt as if a\r\ncobweb fetter had been flung round her. Yielding to a sudden impulse\r\nshe flung the big aster on the ground and set her foot on it.\r\n\r\nDean Priest looked on amusedly. His strange eyes were very kindly as he\r\nmet hers.\r\n\r\n“You rare thing--you vivid thing--you starry thing! We are going to be\r\ngood friends--we _are_ good friends. I’m coming up to Wyther Grange\r\nto-morrow to see those descriptions you’ve written of Caroline and\r\nmy venerable Aunt in your Jimmy-book. I feel sure they’re delicious.\r\nHere’s your path--don’t go roaming again so far from civilization.\r\nGood-night, my Star of the Morning.”\r\n\r\nHe stood at the crossroad and watched her out of sight.\r\n\r\n“What a child!” he muttered. “I’ll never forget her eyes as she lay\r\nthere on the edge of death--the dauntless little soul--and I’ve never\r\nseen a creature who seemed so full of sheer joy in existence. She is\r\nDouglas Starr’s child--_he_ never called me Jarback.”\r\n\r\nHe stooped and picked up the broken aster. Emily’s heel had met it\r\nsquarely and it was badly crushed. But he put it away that night\r\nbetween the leaves of an old volume of _Jane Eyre_, where he had marked\r\na verse--\r\n\r\n    All glorious rose upon my sight\r\n    That child of shower and gleam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE VOW OF EMILY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Dean Priest Emily found, for the first time since her father had\r\ndied, a companion who could fully sympathize. She was always at her\r\nbest with him, with a delightful feeling of being understood. To love\r\nis easy and therefore common--but to _understand_--how rare it is!\r\nThey roamed wonderlands of fancy together in the magic August days\r\nthat followed upon Emily’s adventure on the bay shore, talked together\r\nof exquisite, immortal things, and were at home with “nature’s old\r\nfelicities” of which Wordsworth so happily speaks.\r\n\r\nEmily showed him all the poetry and “descriptions” in her “Jimmy-book”\r\nand he read them gravely, and, exactly as Father had done, made little\r\ncriticisms that did not hurt her because she knew they were just. As\r\nfor Dean Priest, a certain secret well-spring of fancy that had long\r\nseemed dry bubbled up in him sparklingly again.\r\n\r\n“You make me believe in fairies, whether I will or no,” he told her,\r\n“and that means youth. As long as you believe in fairies you can’t grow\r\nold.”\r\n\r\n“But I can’t believe in fairies myself,” protested Emily sorrowfully.\r\n“I wish I could.”\r\n\r\n“But _you_ are a fairy yourself--or you wouldn’t be able to find\r\nfairyland. You can’t buy a ticket there, you know. Either the fairies\r\nthemselves give you your passport at your christening--or they don’t.\r\nThat is all there is to it.”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t ‘Fairyland’ the _loveliest_ word?” said Emily dreamily.\r\n\r\n“Because it means everything the human heart desires,” said Dean.\r\n\r\nWhen he talked to her Emily felt as if she were looking into some\r\nenchanted mirror where her own dreams and secret hopes were reflected\r\nback to her with added charm. If Dean Priest were a cynic he showed no\r\ncynicism to Emily. But in her company he was not a cynic; he had shed\r\nhis years and became a boy again with a boy’s untainted visions. She\r\nloved him for the world he opened to her view.\r\n\r\nThere was such fun in him, too,--such sly, surprising fun. He told her\r\njokes--he made her laugh. He told her strange old tales of forgotten\r\ngods who were very beautiful--of court festivals and the bridals of\r\nkings. He seemed to have the history of the whole world at his fingers’\r\nends. He described things to her in unforgettable phrases as they\r\nwalked by the bay shore or sat in the overgrown, shadowy old garden\r\nof Wyther Grange. When he spoke of Athens as “the City of the Violet\r\nCrown” Emily realized afresh what magic is made when the right words\r\nare wedded; and she loved to think of Rome as “the City of the Seven\r\nHills.” Dean had been in Rome and Athens--and almost everywhere else.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know any one ever talked as you do except in books,” she told\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nDean laughed--with a little note of bitterness that was so often\r\npresent in his laughter--though less often with Emily than with other\r\npeople. It was really his laughter that had won Dean his reputation for\r\ncynicism. People so often felt that he was laughing _at_ them instead\r\nof _with_ them.\r\n\r\n“I’ve had only books for companions most of my life,” he said. “Is it\r\nany wonder I talk like them?”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure I’ll like studying history after this,” said Emily; “except\r\nCanadian History. I’ll never like _it_--it’s so dull. Not just at the\r\nfirst, when we belonged to France and there was plenty of fighting, but\r\nafter that it’s nothing but politics.”\r\n\r\n“The happiest countries, like the happiest women, have no history,”\r\nsaid Dean.\r\n\r\n“I hope _I’ll_ have a history,” cried Emily. “I want a _thrilling_\r\ncareer.”\r\n\r\n“We all do, foolish one. Do you know what makes history? Pain--and\r\nshame--and rebellion--and bloodshed and heartache. Star, ask yourself\r\nhow many hearts ached--and broke--to make those crimson and purple\r\npages in history that you find so enthralling. I told you the story of\r\nLeonidas and his Spartans the other day. They had mothers, sisters and\r\nsweethearts. If they could have fought a bloodless battle at the polls\r\nwouldn’t it have been better--if not so dramatic.”\r\n\r\n“I--can’t--_feel_--that way,” said Emily confusedly. She was not old\r\nenough to think or say, as she would say ten years later, “The heroes\r\nof Thermopylæ have been an inspiration to humanity for centuries. What\r\nsquabble around a ballot-box will ever be that?”\r\n\r\n“And, like all female creatures, you form your opinions by your\r\nfeelings. Well, hope for your thrilling career--but remember that if\r\nthere is to be drama in your life _somebody_ must pay the piper in the\r\ncoin of suffering. If not you--then some one else.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, I wouldn’t like _that_.”\r\n\r\n“Then be content with fewer thrills. What about your tumble over the\r\nbank down there? That came near being a tragedy. What if I hadn’t found\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“But you _did_ find me,” cried Emily. “I like near escapes--after\r\nthey’re over,” she added. “If everybody had always been happy there’d\r\nbe nothing to read about.”\r\n\r\nTweed made a third in their rambles and Emily grew very fond of him,\r\nwithout losing any of her loyalty to the pussy folk.\r\n\r\n“I like cats with one part of my mind and dogs with another part,” she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“I like cats but I never keep one,” Dean said. “They’re too\r\nexacting--they ask too much. Dogs want only love but cats demand\r\nworship. They have never got over the Bubastis habit of godship.”\r\n\r\nEmily understood this--he had told her all about old Egypt and the\r\ngoddess Pasht--but she did not quite agree with him.\r\n\r\n“Kittens don’t want to be worshipped,” she said. “They just want to be\r\ncuddled.”\r\n\r\n“By their priestesses--yes. If you had been born on the banks of the\r\nNile five thousand years ago, Emily, you would have been a priestess of\r\nPasht--an adorable, slim, brown creature with a fillet of gold around\r\nyour black hair and bands of silver on those ankles Aunt Nancy admires,\r\nwith dozens of sacred little godlings frisking around you under the\r\npalms of the temple courts.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” gasped Emily rapturously, “that gave me _the flash_. And,” she\r\nadded wonderingly, “just for a moment it made me _homesick_, too. Why?”\r\n\r\n“Why? Because I haven’t a doubt you _were_ just such a priestess in\r\na former incarnation and my words reminded your soul of it. Do you\r\nbelieve in the doctrine of the transmigration of souls, Star? But of\r\ncourse not--brought up by the true-blue Calvinists of New Moon.”\r\n\r\n“What does it mean?” asked Emily, and when Dean explained it to her she\r\nthought it a very delightful belief but was quite sure Aunt Elizabeth\r\nwould not approve of it.\r\n\r\n“So I won’t believe it--yet,” she said gravely.\r\n\r\nThen it all came to an end quite suddenly. It had been taken for\r\ngranted by all concerned that Emily was to stay at Wyther Grange until\r\nthe end of August. But in mid-August Aunt Nancy said suddenly to her\r\none day,\r\n\r\n“Go home, Emily. I’m tired of you. I like you very well--you’re not\r\nstupid and you’re passably pretty and you’ve behaved exceedingly\r\nwell--tell Elizabeth you do the Murrays credit--but I’m tired of you.\r\nGo home.”\r\n\r\nEmily’s feelings were mixed. It hurt her to be told Aunt Nancy was\r\ntired of her--it would hurt any one. It rankled in her for several days\r\nuntil she thought of a sharp answer she might have made Aunt Nancy and\r\nwrote it down in her Jimmy-book. She felt quite as relieved then as if\r\nshe had really said it.\r\n\r\nAnd she was sorry to leave Wyther Grange; she had grown to love the\r\nold beautiful house, with its flavour of hidden secrets--a flavour\r\nthat was wholly a trick of its architecture, for there had never been\r\nanything in it but the simple tale of births and deaths and marriages\r\nand everyday living that most houses have. She was sorry to leave the\r\nbay shore and the quaint garden and the gazing-ball and the chessy-cat\r\nand the Pink Room bed of freedom; and most of all she was sorry to\r\nleave Dean Priest. But on the other hand it was delightful to think\r\nof going back to New Moon and all the loved ones there--Teddy and his\r\ndear whistle, Ilse and her stimulating comradeship, Perry with his\r\ndetermined reaching up for higher things, Saucy Sal and the new kitten\r\nthat must be needing proper training now, and the fairy world of the\r\n_Midsummer Night’s Dream_. Cousin Jimmy’s garden would be in its prime\r\nof splendour, the August apples would be ripe. Suddenly, Emily was very\r\nready to go. She packed her little black box jubilantly and found it an\r\nexcellent chance to work in neatly a certain line from a poem Dean had\r\nrecently read to her which had captured her fancy.\r\n\r\n“‘Good-bye, proud world, I’m going home,’” she declaimed feelingly,\r\nstanding at the top of the long, dark, shining staircase and\r\napostrophizing the row of grim Priest photographs hanging on the wall.\r\n\r\nBut she was much annoyed over one thing. Aunt Nancy would not give her\r\nback the picture Teddy had painted.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to keep it,” Aunt Nancy said, grinning and shaking her gold\r\ntassels. “Some day that picture will be worth something as the early\r\neffort of a famous artist.”\r\n\r\n“I only lent it to you--I told you I only lent it to you,” said Emily\r\nindignantly.\r\n\r\n“I’m an unscrupulous old demon,” said Aunt Nancy coolly. “That is\r\nwhat the Priests all call me behind my back. Don’t they, Caroline?\r\nMay as well have the game as the name. I happen to have a fancy for\r\nthat picture, that’s all. I’m going to frame it and hang it here in my\r\nparlour. But I’ll leave it to you in my will--that and the chessy-cat\r\nand the gazing-ball and my gold earrings. Nothing else--I’m not going\r\nto leave you a cent of my money--never count on that.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want it,” said Emily loftily. “I’m going to earn heaps of\r\nmoney for myself. But it isn’t fair of you to keep my picture. It was\r\ngiven to me.”\r\n\r\n“I never was fair,” said Aunt Nancy. “Was I, Caroline?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Caroline shrewishly.\r\n\r\n“You see. Now don’t make a fuss, Emily. You’ve been a very good child\r\nbut I feel that I’ve done my duty by you for this year. Go back to New\r\nMoon and when Elizabeth won’t let you do things tell her _I_ always let\r\nyou. I don’t know if it will do any good but try it. Elizabeth, like\r\nevery one else related to me, is always wondering what I’m going to do\r\nwith my money.”\r\n\r\nCousin Jimmy came over for Emily. How glad she was to see his kind face\r\nwith its gentle, elfish eyes and forked beard again! But she felt very\r\nbadly when she turned to Dean.\r\n\r\n“If you like I’ll kiss you good-bye,” she said chokily.\r\n\r\nEmily did not like kissing people. She did not really want to kiss\r\nDean but she liked him so much she thought she ought to extend all the\r\ncourtesies to him.\r\n\r\nDean looked down smiling into her face, so young, so pure, so softly\r\ncurved.\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t want you to kiss me--yet. And our first kiss mustn’t have\r\nthe flavour of good-bye. It would be a bad omen. Star O’ Morning, I’m\r\nsorry you’re going. But I’ll see you again before long. My oldest\r\nsister lives in Blair Water, you know, and I feel a sudden access of\r\nbrotherly affection towards her. I seem to see myself visiting her very\r\noften henceforth. In the meantime remember you have promised to write\r\nme every week. And I’ll write you.”\r\n\r\n“Nice fat letters,” coaxed Emily. “I love fat letters.”\r\n\r\n“Fat! They’ll be positively corpulent, Star. Now, I’m not even going to\r\n_say_ good-bye. Let’s make a pact, Star. We’ll never _say_ good-bye to\r\neach other. We’ll just smile and go.”\r\n\r\nEmily made a gallant effort--smiled--and went. Aunt Nancy and Caroline\r\nreturned to the back parlour and their cribbage. Dean Priest whistled\r\nfor Tweed and went to the bay shore. He was so lonely that he laughed\r\nat himself.\r\n\r\nEmily and Cousin Jimmy had so much to talk of that the drive home\r\nseemed very short.\r\n\r\nNew Moon was white in the evening sunshine which also lay with\r\nexceeding mellowness on the grey old barns. The Three Princesses,\r\nshooting up against the silvery sky, were as remote and princessly as\r\never. The old gulf was singing away down over the fields.\r\n\r\nAunt Laura came running out to meet them, her lovely blue eyes shining\r\nwith pleasure. Aunt Elizabeth was in the cook-house preparing supper\r\nand only shook hands with Emily, but looked a trifle less grim and\r\nstately than usual, and she had made Emily’s favourite cream-puffs for\r\nsupper. Perry was hanging about, barefooted and sunburned, to tell\r\nher all the gossip of kittens and calves and little pigs and the new\r\nfoal. Ilse came swooping over, and Emily discovered she had forgotten\r\nhow vivid Ilse was--how brilliant her amber eyes, how golden her mane\r\nof spun-silk hair, looking more golden than ever under the bright\r\nblue silk tam Mrs. Simms had bought her in Shrewsbury. As an article\r\nof dress, that loud tam made Laura Murray’s eyes and sensibilities\r\nache, but its colour certainly did set off Ilse’s wonderful hair. She\r\nengulfed Emily in a rapturous embrace and quarrelled bitterly with her\r\nten minutes later over the fact that Emily refused to give her Saucy\r\nSal’s sole surviving kitten.\r\n\r\n“I ought to have it, you doddering hyena,” stormed Ilse. “It’s as much\r\nmine as yours, pig! Our old barn cat is its father.”\r\n\r\n“Such talk is not decent,” said Aunt Elizabeth, pale with horror. “And\r\nif you two children are going to quarrel over that kitten I’ll have it\r\ndrowned--remember that.”\r\n\r\nIlse was finally appeased by Emily’s offering to let her name the\r\nkitten and have a half interest in it. Ilse named it Daffodil. Emily\r\ndid not think this suitable, since, from the fact of Cousin Jimmy\r\nreferring to it as Little Tommy, she suspected it was of the sterner\r\nsex. But rather than again provoke Aunt Elizabeth’s wrath by discussing\r\ntabooed subjects, she agreed.\r\n\r\n“I can call it Daff,” she thought. “That sounds more _masculine_.”\r\n\r\nThe kitten was a delicate bit of striped greyness that reminded Emily\r\nof her dear lost Mikes. And it smelled so nice--of warmth and clean\r\nfurriness, with whiffs of the clover hay where Saucy Sal had made her\r\nmother-nest.\r\n\r\nAfter supper she heard Teddy’s whistle in the old orchard--the same\r\nenchanting call. Emily flew out to greet him--after all, there was\r\nnobody just like Teddy in the world. They had an ecstatic scamper up to\r\nthe Tansy Patch to see a new puppy that Dr. Burnley had given Teddy.\r\nMrs. Kent did not seem very glad to see Emily--she was colder and more\r\nremote than ever, and she sat and watched the two children playing with\r\nthe chubby little pup with a smouldering fire in her dark eyes that\r\nmade Emily vaguely uncomfortable whenever she happened to glance up and\r\nencounter it. Never before had she sensed Mrs. Kent’s dislike for her\r\nso keenly as that night.\r\n\r\n“Why doesn’t your mother like me?” she asked Teddy bluntly, when they\r\ncarried little Leo to the barn for the night.\r\n\r\n“Because _I_ do,” said Teddy briefly. “She doesn’t like _anything_ I\r\nlike. I’m afraid she’ll poison Leo very soon. I--I wish she wasn’t\r\nso fond of me,” he burst out, in the beginning of a revolt against\r\nthis abnormal jealousy of love, which he felt rather than understood\r\nto be a fetter that was becoming galling. “She says she won’t let me\r\ntake up Latin and Algebra this year--you know Miss Brownell said I\r\nmight--because I’m not to go to college. She says she can’t bear to\r\npart from me--ever. I don’t care about the Latin and stuff--but I want\r\nto learn to be an artist--I want to go away some day to the schools\r\nwhere they teach that. She won’t let me--she hates my pictures now\r\nbecause she thinks I like them better than her. I _don’t_--I love\r\nMother--she’s awful sweet and good to me every other way. But she\r\nthinks I do--and she’s burned some of them. I know she has. They’re\r\nmissing from the barn wall and I can’t find them anywhere. If she does\r\nanything to Leo--I’ll--I’ll _hate_ her.”\r\n\r\n“Tell her that,” said Emily coolly, with some of the Murray shrewdness\r\ncoming uppermost in her. “She doesn’t know that _you_ know she poisoned\r\nSmoke and Buttercup. Tell her you do know it and that if she does\r\nanything to Leo you won’t love her any more. She’ll be so frightened\r\nof your _not_ loving her that she won’t meddle with Leo--I _know_.\r\nTell her gently--don’t hurt her feelings--but _tell_ her. It will,”\r\nconcluded Emily, with a killing imitation of Aunt Elizabeth delivering\r\nan ultimatum, “be better for all concerned.”\r\n\r\n“I believe I will,” said Teddy, much impressed. “I _can’t_ have Leo\r\ndisappear like my cats did--he’s the only dog I’ve ever had and I’ve\r\nalways wanted a dog. Oh, Emily, I’m glad you’re back!”\r\n\r\nIt was very nice to be told this--especially by Teddy. Emily went home\r\nto New Moon happily. In the old kitchen the candles were lighted and\r\ntheir flames were dancing in the winds of the August night blowing\r\nthrough door and window.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you’ll not like candles very well, Emily, after being used\r\nto lamps at Wyther Grange,” said Aunt Laura with a little sigh. It was\r\none of the bitter, small things in Laura Murray’s life that Elizabeth’s\r\ntyranny extended to candles.\r\n\r\nEmily looked around her thoughtfully. One candle sputtered and bobbed\r\nat her as if greeting her. One, with a long wick, glowed and smouldered\r\nlike a sulky little demon. One had a tiny flame--a sly, meditative\r\ncandle. One swayed with a queer fiery grace in the draught from the\r\ndoor. One burned with a steady upright flame like a faithful soul.\r\n\r\n“I--don’t know--Aunt Laura,” she answered slowly. “You can\r\nbe--friends--with candles. I believe I like the candles best after all.”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth, coming in from the cook-house, heard her. Something\r\nlike pleasure gleamed in her gulf-blue eyes.\r\n\r\n“You have some sense in you,” she said.\r\n\r\n“That’s the second compliment she has paid me,” thought Emily.\r\n\r\n“I think Emily has grown taller since she went to Wyther Grange,” Aunt\r\nLaura said, looking at her rather wistfully.\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth, snuffing the candles, glanced sharply over her glasses.\r\n\r\n“I can’t see it,” she said. “Her dress is just the same length on her.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure she has,” persisted Laura.\r\n\r\nCousin Jimmy, to settle the dispute, measured Emily by the sitting-room\r\ndoor. She just touched the former mark.\r\n\r\n“You see,” said Aunt Elizabeth triumphantly, liking to be right even in\r\nthis small matter.\r\n\r\n“She looks--different,” said Laura with a sigh.\r\n\r\nLaura, after all, was right. Emily _had_ grown, taller and older, in\r\nsoul, if not in body. It was this change which Laura felt, as close\r\nand tender affection swiftly feels. The Emily who returned from Wyther\r\nGrange was not the Emily who had gone there. She was no longer wholly\r\nthe child. Aunt Nancy’s family histories over which she had pondered,\r\nher enduring anguish over the story of Ilse’s mother, that terrible\r\nhour when she had lain cheek by jowl with death on the cliffs of the\r\nbay shore, her association with Dean Priest, all had combined to mature\r\nher intelligence and her emotions. When she went to the garret next\r\nmorning and pulled out her precious little bundle of manuscripts to\r\nread them lovingly over she was amazed and rather grieved to find that\r\nthey were not half so good as she had believed they were. Some of them\r\nwere positively silly, she thought; she was ashamed of them--so ashamed\r\nthat she smuggled them down to the cook-house stove and burned them,\r\nmuch to Aunt Elizabeth’s annoyance when she came to prepare dinner and\r\nfound the fire-box all choked up with charred paper.\r\n\r\nEmily no longer wondered that Miss Brownell had made fun of\r\nthem--though this did not mellow her bitterness of remembrance in\r\nregard to that lady in any degree. The rest she put back on the sofa\r\nshelf, including “The Child of the Sea,” which still impressed her as\r\nfairly good, though not just the wonderful composition she had once\r\ndeemed it. She felt that many passages could be re-written to their\r\nadvantage. Then she immediately began writing a new poem, “On Returning\r\nHome After Weeks’ Absence.” As everything and everybody connected with\r\nNew Moon had to be mentioned in this poem it promised to be quite long\r\nand to furnish agreeable occupation for spare minutes in many weeks to\r\ncome. It was very good to be home again.\r\n\r\n“There is no place just like dear New Moon,” thought Emily.\r\n\r\nOne thing that marked her return--one of those little household\r\n“epochs” that make a keener impression on the memory and imagination\r\nthan perhaps their real importance warrants--was the fact that she was\r\ngiven a room of her own. Aunt Elizabeth had found her unshared slumber\r\ntoo sweet a thing to be again surrendered. She decided that she could\r\nnot put up any longer with a squirming bedfellow who asked unearthly\r\nquestions at any hour of the night she took it into her head to do so.\r\n\r\nSo, after a long conference with Laura, it was settled that Emily was\r\nto have her mother’s room--the “lookout” as it was called, though\r\nit was not really a lookout. But it occupied the place in New Moon,\r\nlooking over the front door to the garden, that the real lookouts did\r\nin other Blair Water houses, so it went by that name. It had been\r\nprepared for Emily’s occupancy in her absence and when bedtime came on\r\nthe first evening of her return Aunt Elizabeth curtly told her that\r\nhenceforth she was to have her mother’s room.\r\n\r\n“All to myself?” exclaimed Emily.\r\n\r\n“Yes. We will expect you to take care of it yourself and keep it very\r\ntidy.”\r\n\r\n“It has never been slept in since the night before your mother--went\r\naway,” said Aunt Laura, with a queer sound in her voice--a sound of\r\nwhich Aunt Elizabeth disapproved.\r\n\r\n“Your mother,” she said, looking coldly at Emily over the flame of the\r\ncandle--an attitude that gave a rather gruesome effect to her acquiline\r\nfeatures--“_ran_ away--flouted her family and broke her father’s heart.\r\nShe was a silly, ungrateful, disobedient girl. I hope _you_ will never\r\ndisgrace your family by such conduct.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Aunt Elizabeth,” said Emily breathlessly, “when you hold the\r\ncandle down like that it makes your face look just like a corpse! Oh,\r\nit’s so interesting.”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth turned and led the way upstairs in grim silence. There\r\nwas no use in wasting perfectly good admonitions on a child like this.\r\n\r\nLeft alone in her lookout, lighted dimly by the one small candle, Emily\r\ngazed about her with keen and thrilling interest. She could not get\r\ninto bed until she had explored every bit of it. The room was very\r\nold-fashioned, like all the New Moon rooms. The walls were papered with\r\na design of slender gilt diamonds enclosing golden stars and hung with\r\nworked woollen mottoes and pictures that had been “supplements” in the\r\ngirlhood of her aunts. One of them, hanging over the head of the bed,\r\nrepresented two guardian angels. In its day this had been much admired\r\nbut Emily looked at it with distaste.\r\n\r\n“I don’t like feather wings on angels,” she said decidedly. “Angels\r\nshould have rainbowy wings.”\r\n\r\nOn the floor was a pretty homespun carpet and round braided rugs. There\r\nwas a high black bedstead with carved posts, a fat feather-bed, and an\r\nIrish chain quilt, but, as Emily was glad to see, no curtains. A little\r\ntable, with funny claw-feet and brass-knobbed drawers, stood by the\r\nwindow, which was curtained with muslin frills; one of the window-panes\r\ncontorted the landscape funnily, making a hill where no hill was. Emily\r\nliked this--she couldn’t have told why, but it was really because\r\nit gave the pane an individuality of its own. An oval mirror in a\r\ntarnished gilt frame hung above the table; Emily was delighted to\r\nfind she could see herself in it--“all but my boots”--without craning\r\nor tipping it. “And it doesn’t twist my face or turn my complexion\r\ngreen,” she thought happily. Two high-backed, black chairs with\r\nhorsehair seats, a little washstand with a blue basin and pitcher, and\r\na faded ottoman with woollen roses cross-stitched on it, completed the\r\nfurnishing. On the little mantel were vases full of dried and coloured\r\ngrasses and a fascinating pot-bellied bottle filled with West Indian\r\nshells. On either side were lovable little cupboards with leaded-glass\r\ndoors like those in the sitting-room. Underneath was a small fireplace.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if Aunt Elizabeth will ever let me have a little fire here,”\r\nthought Emily.\r\n\r\nThe room was full of that indefinable charm found in all rooms where\r\nthe pieces of furniture, whether old or new, are well acquainted with\r\neach other and the walls and floors are on good terms. Emily felt it\r\nall over her as she flitted about examining everything. This was her\r\nroom--she loved it already--she felt perfectly at home.\r\n\r\n“I belong here,” she breathed happily.\r\n\r\nShe felt deliciously _near_ to her mother--as if Juliet Starr had\r\nsuddenly become real to her. It thrilled her to think that her mother\r\nhad probably crocheted the lace cover on the round pincushion on the\r\ntable. And that fat, black jar of pot-pourri on the mantel--her mother\r\nmust have compounded it. When Emily lifted the lid a faint spicy odour\r\nfloated out. The souls of all the roses that had bloomed through many\r\nolden summers at New Moon seemed to be prisoned there in a sort of\r\nflower purgatory. Something in the haunting, mystical, elusive odour\r\ngave Emily _the flash_--and her room had received its consecration.\r\n\r\nThere was a picture of her mother hanging over the mantel--a large\r\ndaguerreotype taken when she was a little girl. Emily looked at it\r\nlovingly. She had the picture of her mother which her father had left,\r\ntaken after their marriage. But when Aunt Elizabeth had brought that\r\nfrom Maywood to New Moon she had hung it in the parlour where Emily\r\nseldom saw it. This picture, in her bedroom, of the golden-haired,\r\nrose-cheeked girl, was all her own. She could look at it--talk to it at\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mother,” she said, “what did you think of when you were a little\r\ngirl here like me? I wish I could have known you _then_. And to think\r\nnobody has ever slept here since that last night you did before you\r\nran away with Father. Aunt Elizabeth says you were wicked to do it but\r\n_I_ don’t think you were. It wasn’t as if you were running away with\r\na _stranger_. Anyway, I’m glad you _did_, because if you hadn’t there\r\nwouldn’t have been any _me_.”\r\n\r\nEmily, very glad that there was an Emily, opened her lookout window as\r\nhigh as it would go, got into bed and drifted off to sleep, feeling a\r\nhappiness that was so deep as to be almost pain as she listened to the\r\nsonorous sweep of the night wind among the great trees in Lofty John’s\r\nbush. When she wrote to her father a few days later she began the\r\nletter “Dear Father and Mother.”\r\n\r\n“And I’ll always write the letter to _you_ as well as Father after\r\nthis, Mother. I’m sorry I left you out so long. But you didn’t seem\r\n_real_ till that night I came home. I made the bed beautifully next\r\nmorning--Aunt Elizabeth didn’t find a bit of fault with it--and I\r\ndusted _everything_--and when I went out I knelt down and kissed the\r\ndoorstep. I didn’t think Aunt Elizabeth saw me but she did and said had\r\nI gone crazy. Why does Aunt Elizabeth think any one is crazy who does\r\nsomething she never does? I said ‘No, it’s only because I love my room\r\nso much’ and she sniffed and said ‘You’d better love your God.’ But so\r\nI do, dear Father--and Mother--and I love Him better than ever since\r\nI have my dear room. I can see all over the garden from it and into\r\nLofty John’s bush and one little bit of the Blair Water through the gap\r\nin the trees where the Yesterday Road runs. I like to go to bed early\r\nnow. I love to lie all alone in my own room and make poetry and think\r\nout descriptions of things while I look through the open window at the\r\nstars and the nice, big, kind, quiet trees in Lofty John’s bush.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Father dear and Mother, we are going to have a new teacher. Miss\r\nBrownell is not coming back. She is going to be married and Ilse says\r\nthat when her father heard it he said ‘God help the man.’ And the new\r\nteacher is a Mr. Carpenter. Ilse saw him when he came to see her father\r\nabout the school--because Dr. Burnley is a trustee this year--and she\r\nsays he has bushy grey hair and whiskers. He is married, too, and is\r\ngoing to live in that little old house down in the hollow below the\r\nschool. It seems so funny to think of a teacher having a wife and\r\nwhiskers.\r\n\r\n“I am glad to be home. But I miss Dean and the gazing-ball. Aunt\r\nElizabeth looked very cross when she saw my bang but didn’t say\r\nanything. Aunt Laura says just to keep quiet and go on wearing it.\r\nBut I don’t feel comfortable going against Aunt Elizabeth so I have\r\ncombed it all back except a _little_ fringe. I don’t feel _quite_\r\ncomfortable about it even yet, but I have to put up with being a little\r\nuncomfortable for the sake of my looks. Aunt Laura says bustles are\r\ngoing out of style so I’ll never be able to have one but I don’t care\r\nbecause I think they’re ugly. Rhoda Stuart will be cross because she\r\nwas just longing to be old enough to wear a bustle. I hope I’ll be able\r\nto have a gin-jar all to myself when the weather gets cold. There is a\r\nrow of gin-jars on the high shelf in the cook-house.\r\n\r\n“Teddy and I had the nicest _adventure_ yesterday evening. We are going\r\nto keep it a secret from everybody--partly because it was so nice, and\r\npartly because we think we’d get a fearful scolding for one thing we\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n“We went up to the Disappointed House, and we found one of the boards\r\non the windows loose. So we pried it off and crawled in and went all\r\nover the house. It is lathed but not plastered, and the shavings are\r\nlying all over the floors just as the carpenters left them years\r\nago. It seemed more disappointed than ever. I just felt like crying.\r\nThere was a dear little fireplace in one room so we went to work and\r\nkindled a fire in it with shavings and pieces of boards (this is the\r\nthing we would be scolded for, likely) and then sat before it on an\r\nold carpenter’s bench and talked. We decided that when we grew up we\r\nwould buy the Disappointed House and live here together. Teddy said he\r\nsupposed we’d have to get married, but I thought maybe we could find\r\na way to manage without going to all that bother. Teddy will paint\r\npictures and I will write poetry and we will have toast and bacon and\r\nmarmalade _every morning_ for breakfast--just like Wyther Grange--but\r\n_never_ porridge. And we’ll always have lots of nice things to eat in\r\nthe pantry and I’ll make lots of jam and Teddy is always going to help\r\nme wash the dishes and we’ll hang the gazing-ball from the middle of\r\nthe ceiling in the fireplace room--because likely Aunt Nancy will be\r\ndead by then.\r\n\r\n“When the fire burned out we jammed the board into place in the window\r\nand came away. Every now and then to-day Teddy would say to me “Toast\r\nand bacon and marmalade” in the _most mysterious_ tones and Ilse and\r\nPerry are wild because they can’t find out what he means.\r\n\r\n“Cousin Jimmy has got Jimmy Joe Belle to help with the harvest. Jimmy\r\nJoe Belle comes from over Derry Pond way. There are a great many French\r\nthere and when a French girl marries they call her mostly by her\r\nhusband’s first name instead of Mrs. like the English do. If a girl\r\nnamed Mary marries a man named Leon she will always be called Mary Leon\r\nafter that. But in Jimmy Joe Belle’s case, it is the other way and he\r\nis called by his wife’s name. I asked Cousin Jimmy why, and he said it\r\nwas because Jimmy Joe was a poor stick of a creature and Belle wore\r\nthe britches. But still I don’t understand. Jimmy Joe wears britches\r\nhimself--that means trousers--and why should he be called Jimmy Joe\r\nBelle instead of her being called Belle Jimmy Joe just because she\r\nwears them too! I won’t rest till I find out.\r\n\r\n“Cousin Jimmy’s garden is splendid now. The tiger lilies are out. I am\r\ntrying to love them because nobody seems to like them at all but deep\r\ndown in my heart I know I love the late roses best. You just can’t help\r\nloving the roses best.\r\n\r\n“Ilse and I hunted all over the old orchard to-day for a four-leaved\r\nclover and couldn’t find one. Then I found one in a clump of clover\r\nby the dairy steps to-night when I was straining the milk and never\r\nthinking of clovers. Cousin Jimmy says that is the way luck always\r\ncomes, and it is no use to look for it.\r\n\r\n“It is lovely to be with Ilse again. We have only fought twice since I\r\ncame home. I am going to try not to fight with Ilse any more because\r\nI don’t think it is dignified, although quite interesting. But it is\r\nhard not to because even when I keep quiet and don’t say a word Ilse\r\nthinks that’s a way of fighting and gets madder and says worse things\r\nthan ever. Aunt Elizabeth says it always takes two to make a quarrel\r\nbut she doesn’t know Ilse as I do. Ilse called me a sneaking albatross\r\nto-day. I wonder how many animals are left to call me. She never\r\nrepeats the same one twice. I wish she wouldn’t clapper-claw Perry so\r\nmuch. (Clapper-claw is a word I learned from Aunt Nancy. Very striking,\r\nI think.) It seems as if she couldn’t bear him. He dared Teddy to jump\r\nfrom the henhouse roof across to the pighouse roof. Teddy wouldn’t. He\r\nsaid he would try it if it had to be done or would do anybody any good\r\nbut he wasn’t going to do it just to show off. Perry did it and landed\r\nsafe. If he hadn’t he might have broken his neck. Then he bragged about\r\nit and said Teddy was afraid and Ilse turned red as a beet and told\r\nhim to shut up or she would bite his snout off. She can’t bear to have\r\nanything said against Teddy, but I guess he can take care of himself.\r\n\r\n“Ilse can’t study for the Entrance either. Her father won’t let her.\r\nBut she says she doesn’t care. She says she’s going to run away when\r\nshe gets a little older and study for the stage. That sounds wicked,\r\nbut interesting.\r\n\r\n“I felt very queer and guilty when I saw Ilse first, because I knew\r\nabout her mother. I don’t know why I felt guilty because I had nothing\r\nto do with it. The feeling is wearing away a little now but I am so\r\nunhappy by spells over it. I wish I could either forget it altogether\r\nor find out the rights of it. Because I am sure nobody knows them.\r\n\r\n“I had a letter from Dean to-day. He writes lovely letters--just as\r\nif I was grown up. He sent me a little poem he had cut out of a paper\r\ncalled _The Fringed Gentian_. He said it made him think of me. It is\r\nall lovely but I like the last verse best of all. This is it:\r\n\r\n    Then whisper, blossom, in thy sleep\r\n    How I may upward climb\r\n    The Alpine Path, so hard, so steep,\r\n    That leads to heights sublime.\r\n    How I may reach that far-off goal\r\n    Of true and honored fame\r\n    And write upon its shining scroll\r\n    A woman’s humble name.\r\n\r\n“When I read that _the flash_ came, and I took a sheet of paper--I\r\nforgot to tell you Cousin Jimmy gave me a little box of paper and\r\nenvelopes--_on the sly_--and I wrote on it:\r\n\r\n    I, Emily Byrd Starr, do solemnly vow this day that I will climb\r\n    the Alpine Path and write my name on the scroll of fame.\r\n\r\n“Then I put it in the envelope and sealed it up and wrote on it _The\r\nVow of Emily Byrd Starr, aged 12 years and 3 months_, and put it away\r\non the sofa shelf in the garret.\r\n\r\n“I am writing a murder story now and I am trying to feel how a man\r\nwould feel who was a murderer. It is creepy, but thrilling. I almost\r\nfeel as if I _had_ murdered somebody.\r\n\r\n        “Good night, dear Father and Mother.\r\n                       “Your lovingest daughter,\r\n                                           “_Emily_.\r\n\r\n“P. S. I have been wondering how I’ll sign my name when I grow up and\r\nprint my pieces. I don’t know which would be best--Emily Byrd Starr in\r\nfull or Emily B. Starr, or E. B. Starr, or E. Byrd Starr. Sometimes\r\nI think I’ll have a _nom-de-plume_--that is, another name you pick\r\nfor yourself. It’s in my dictionary among the “French phrases” at the\r\nback. If I did that then I could hear people talking of my pieces right\r\nbefore me, never suspecting, and say just what they really thought of\r\nthem. That would be interesting but perhaps not always comfortable. I\r\nthink I’ll be,\r\n\r\n                                  “_E. Byrd Starr_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nA WEAVER OF DREAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt took Emily several weeks to make up her mind whether she liked Mr.\r\nCarpenter or not. She knew she did not _dis_like him, not even though\r\nhis first greeting, shot at her on the opening day of school in a gruff\r\nvoice, accompanied by a startling lift of his spiky grey brows was, “So\r\nyou’re the girl that writes poetry, eh? Better stick to your needle and\r\nduster. Too many fools in the world trying to write poetry and failing.\r\nI tried it myself once. Got better sense now.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t keep your nails clean,” thought Emily.\r\n\r\nBut he upset every kind of school tradition so speedily and thoroughly\r\nthat Ilse, who gloried in upsetting things and hated routine, was the\r\nonly scholar that liked him from the start. Some never liked him--the\r\nRhoda Stuart type for example--but most of them came to it after they\r\ngot used to never being used to anything. And Emily finally decided\r\nthat she liked him tremendously.\r\n\r\nMr. Carpenter was somewhere between forty and fifty--a tall man, with\r\nan upstanding shock of bushy grey hair, bristling grey moustache and\r\neyebrows, a truculent beard, bright blue eyes out of which all his\r\nwild life had not yet burned the fire, and a long, lean, greyish\r\nface, deeply lined. He lived in a little two-roomed house below the\r\nschool with a shy mouse of a wife. He never talked of his past or\r\noffered any explanation of the fact that at his age he had no better\r\nprofession than teaching a district school for a pittance of salary,\r\nbut the truth leaked out after a while; for Prince Edward Island is a\r\nsmall province and everybody in it knows something about everybody\r\nelse. So eventually Blair Water people, and even the school children,\r\nunderstood that Mr. Carpenter had been a brilliant student in his youth\r\nand had had his eye on the ministry. But at college he had got in with\r\na “fast set”--Blair Water people nodded heads slowly and whispered\r\nthe dreadful phrase portentously--and the fast set had ruined him. He\r\n“took to drink” and went to the dogs generally. And the upshot of it\r\nall was that Francis Carpenter, who had led his class in his first and\r\nsecond years at McGill, and for whom his teachers had predicted a great\r\ncareer, was a country school-teacher at forty-five with no prospect of\r\never being anything else. Perhaps he was resigned to it--perhaps not.\r\nNobody ever knew, not even the brown mouse of a wife. Nobody in Blair\r\nWater cared--he was a good teacher, and that was all that mattered.\r\nEven if he did go on occasional “sprees” he always took Saturday for\r\nthem and was sober enough by Monday. Sober, and especially dignified,\r\nwearing a rusty black frock coat which he never put on any other day\r\nof the week. He did not invite pity and he did not pose as a tragedy.\r\nBut sometimes, when Emily looked at his face, bent over the arithmetic\r\nproblems of Blair Water School, she felt horribly sorry for him without\r\nin the least understanding why.\r\n\r\nHe had an explosive temper which generally burst into flame at least\r\nonce a day, and then he would storm about wildly for a few minutes,\r\ntugging at his beard, imploring heaven to grant him patience,\r\nabusing everybody in general and the luckless object of his wrath in\r\nparticular. But these tempers never lasted long. In a few minutes Mr.\r\nCarpenter would be smiling as graciously as a sun bursting through a\r\nstorm-cloud on the very pupil he had been rating. Nobody seemed to\r\ncherish any grudge because of his scoldings. He never said any of the\r\nbiting things Miss Brownell was wont to say, which rankled and festered\r\nfor weeks; his hail of words fell alike on just and unjust and rolled\r\noff harmlessly.\r\n\r\nHe could take a joke on himself in perfect good nature. “Do you hear\r\nme? Do you hear me, sirrah?” he bellowed to Perry Miller one day. “Of\r\ncourse I hear you,” retorted Perry coolly, “they could hear you in\r\nCharlottetown.” Mr. Carpenter stared for a moment, then broke into a\r\ngreat, jolly laugh.\r\n\r\nHis methods of teaching were so different from Miss Brownell’s that\r\nthe Blair Water pupils at first felt as if he had stood them on their\r\nheads. Miss Brownell had been a martinet for order. Mr. Carpenter\r\nnever tried to keep order apparently. But somehow he kept the children\r\nso busy that they had no time to do mischief. He taught history\r\ntempestuously for a month, making his pupils play the different\r\ncharacters and enact the incidents. He never bothered any one to\r\nlearn dates--but the dates stuck in the memory just the same. If, as\r\nMary Queen of Scots, you were beheaded by the school axe, kneeling\r\nblindfolded at the doorstep, with Perry Miller, wearing a mask made out\r\nof a piece of Aunt Laura’s old black silk, for executioner, wondering\r\nwhat would happen if he brought the axe down _too_ hard, you did not\r\nforget the year it happened; and if you fought the battle of Waterloo\r\nall over the school playground, and heard Teddy Kent shouting, “Up,\r\nGuards and at ’em!” as he led the last furious charge you remembered\r\n1815 without half trying to.\r\n\r\nNext month history would be thrust aside altogether and geography\r\nwould take its place, when school and playground were mapped out into\r\ncountries and you dressed up as the animals inhabiting them or traded\r\nin various commodities over their rivers and cities. When Rhoda Stuart\r\nhad cheated you in a bargain in hides, you remembered that she had\r\nbought the cargo from the Argentine Republic, and when Perry Miller\r\nwould not drink any water for a whole hot summer day because he was\r\ncrossing the Arabian Desert with a caravan of camels and could not\r\nfind an oasis, and then drank so much that he took terrible cramps and\r\nAunt Laura had to be up all night with him--you did not forget where\r\nthe said desert was. The trustees were quite scandalized over some of\r\nthe goings on and felt sure that the children were having too good a\r\ntime to be really learning anything.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to learn Latin and French you had to do it by talking\r\nyour exercises, not writing them, and on Friday afternoons all lessons\r\nwere put aside and Mr. Carpenter made the children recite poems, make\r\nspeeches and declaim passages from Shakespeare and the Bible. This was\r\nthe day Ilse loved. Mr. Carpenter pounced on her gift like a starving\r\ndog on a bone and drilled her without mercy. They had endless fights\r\nand Ilse stamped her foot and called him names while the other pupils\r\nwondered why she was not punished for it but at last had to give in\r\nand do as he willed. Ilse went to school regularly--something she had\r\nnever done before. Mr. Carpenter had told her that if she were absent\r\nfor a day without good excuse she could take no part in the Friday\r\n“exercises” and this would have killed her.\r\n\r\nOne day Mr. Carpenter had picked up Teddy’s slate and found a sketch\r\nof himself on it, in one of his favourite if not exactly beautiful\r\nattitudes. Teddy had labelled it “The Black Death”--half of the pupils\r\nof the school having died that day of the Great Plague, and having\r\nbeen carried out on stretchers to the Potter’s Field by the terrified\r\nsurvivors.\r\n\r\nTeddy expected a roar of denunciation, for the day before Garrett\r\nMarshall had been ground into figurative pulp on being discovered with\r\nthe picture of a harmless cow on his slate--at least, Garrett said he\r\nmeant it for a cow. But now this amazing Mr. Carpenter only drew his\r\nbeetling brows together, looked earnestly at Teddy’s slate, put it down\r\non the desk, looked at Teddy, and said,\r\n\r\n“I don’t know anything about drawing--I can’t help you, but, by gad, I\r\nthink hereafter you’d better give up those extra arithmetic problems in\r\nthe afternoon and draw pictures.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon Garrett Marshall went home and told his father that “old\r\nCarpenter” wasn’t fair and “made favourites” over Teddy Kent.\r\n\r\nMr. Carpenter went up to the Tansy Patch that evening and saw the\r\nsketches in Teddy’s old barn-loft studio. Then he went into the house\r\nand talked to Mrs. Kent. What he said and what she said nobody ever\r\nknew. But Mr. Carpenter went away looking grim, as if he had met an\r\nunexpected match. He took great pains with Teddy’s general school work\r\nafter that and procured from somewhere certain elementary text books on\r\ndrawing which he gave him, telling him not to take them home--a caution\r\nTeddy did not require. He knew quite well that if he did they would\r\ndisappear as mysteriously as his cats had done. He had taken Emily’s\r\nadvice and told his mother he would not love _her_ if anything happened\r\nto Leo, and Leo flourished and waxed fat and doggy. But Teddy was too\r\ngentle at heart and too fond of his mother to make such a threat more\r\nthan once. He knew she had cried all that night after Mr. Carpenter had\r\nbeen there, and prayed on her knees in her little bedroom most of the\r\nnext day, and looked at him with bitter, haunting eyes for a week. He\r\nwished she were more like other fellows’ mothers but they loved each\r\nother very much and had dear hours together in the little grey house on\r\nthe tansy hill. It was only when other people were about that Mrs. Kent\r\nwas queer and jealous.\r\n\r\n“She’s always lovely when we’re alone,” Teddy had told Emily.\r\n\r\nAs for the other boys, Perry Miller was the only one Mr. Carpenter\r\nbothered much with in the way of speeches--and he was as merciless\r\nwith him as with Ilse. Perry worked hard to please him and practiced\r\nhis speeches in barn and field--and even by nights in the kitchen\r\nloft--until Aunt Elizabeth put a stop to _that_. Emily could not\r\nunderstand why Mr. Carpenter would smile amiably and say, “Very good”\r\nwhen Neddy Gray rattled off a speech glibly, without any expression\r\nwhatever, and then rage at Perry and denounce him as a dunce and a\r\nnincompoop, by gad, because he had failed to give just the proper\r\nemphasis on a certain word, or had timed his gesture a fraction of a\r\nsecond too soon.\r\n\r\nNeither could she understand why he made red pencil corrections\r\nall over her compositions and rated her for split infinitives and\r\ntoo lavish adjectives and strode up and down the aisle and hurled\r\nobjurgations at her because she didn’t know “a good place to stop when\r\nshe saw it, by gad,” and then told Rhoda Stuart and Nan Lee that their\r\ncompositions were very pretty and gave them back without so much as\r\na mark on them. Yet, in spite of it all, she liked him more and more\r\nas time went on and autumn passed and winter came with its beautiful\r\nbare-limbed trees, and soft pearl-grey skies that were slashed with\r\nrifts of gold in the afternoons, and cleared to a jewelled pageantry of\r\nstars over the wide white hills and valleys around New Moon.\r\n\r\nEmily shot up so that winter that Aunt Laura had to let down the tucks\r\nin her dresses. Aunt Ruth, who had come for a week’s visit, said she\r\nwas outgrowing her strength--consumptive children always did.\r\n\r\n“I am _not_ consumptive,” Emily said. “The Starrs are tall,” she added,\r\nwith a touch of subtle malice hardly to be looked for in near-thirteen.\r\n\r\nAunt Ruth, who was sensitive in regard to her dumpiness, sniffed.\r\n\r\n“It would be well if _that_ were the only thing in which you resemble\r\nthem,” she said. “How are you getting on in school?”\r\n\r\n“Very well. I am the smartest scholar in my class,” answered Emily\r\ncomposedly.\r\n\r\n“You conceited child!” said Aunt Ruth.\r\n\r\n“I’m _not_ conceited.” Emily looked scornful indignation. “Mr.\r\nCarpenter said it and _he_ doesn’t flatter. Besides, I can’t help\r\nseeing it myself.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it is to be hoped you have some brains, because you haven’t\r\nmuch in the way of looks,” said Aunt Ruth. “You’ve no complexion to\r\nspeak of--and that inky hair around your white face is startling. I see\r\nyou’re going to be a plain girl.”\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t say that to a grown-up person’s face,” said Emily with a\r\ndeliberate gravity which always exasperated Aunt Ruth because she could\r\nnot understand it in a child. “I don’t think it would hurt you to be as\r\npolite to me as you are to other people.”\r\n\r\n“I’m telling you your faults so you may correct them,” said Aunt Ruth\r\nfrigidly.\r\n\r\n“It _isn’t_ my fault that my face is pale and my hair black,” protested\r\nEmily. “I can’t correct that.”\r\n\r\n“If you were a different girl,” said Aunt Ruth, “I would--”\r\n\r\n“But I don’t _want_ to be a different girl,” said Emily decidedly. She\r\nhad no intention of lowering the Starr flag to Aunt Ruth. “I wouldn’t\r\nwant to be anybody but myself even if I am plain. Besides,” she added\r\nimpressively as she turned to go out of the room, “though I may not\r\nbe very good-looking now, when I go to heaven I believe I’ll be very\r\nbeautiful.”\r\n\r\n“Some people think Emily quite pretty,” said Aunt Laura, but she did\r\nnot say it until Emily was out of hearing. She was Murray enough for\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know where they see it,” said Aunt Ruth. “She’s vain and\r\npert and says things to be thought smart. You heard her just now. But\r\nthe thing I dislike most in her is that she is un-childlike--and deep\r\nas the sea. Yes, she is, Laura--deep as the sea. You’ll find it out\r\nto your cost one day if you disregard my warning. She’s capable of\r\nanything. Sly is no word for it. You and Elizabeth don’t keep a tight\r\nenough rein over her.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve done my best,” said Elizabeth stiffly. She herself did think\r\nshe had been much too lenient with Emily--Laura and Jimmy were two to\r\none--but it nettled her to have Ruth say so.\r\n\r\nUncle Wallace also had an attack of worrying over Emily that winter.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her one day when he was at New Moon and remarked that she\r\nwas getting to be a big girl.\r\n\r\n“How old are you, Emily?” He asked her that every time he came to New\r\nMoon.\r\n\r\n“Thirteen in May.”\r\n\r\n“H’m. What are you going to do with her, Elizabeth?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what you mean,” said Aunt Elizabeth coldly--or as\r\ncoldly as is possible to speak when one is pouring melted tallow into\r\ncandle-moulds.\r\n\r\n“Why, she’ll soon be grown up. She can’t expect you to provide for her\r\nindefinitely”--\r\n\r\n“I don’t,” Emily whispered resentfully under her breath.\r\n\r\n“--and it’s time we decided what is best to be done for her.”\r\n\r\n“The Murray women have never had to work out for a living,” said Aunt\r\nElizabeth, as if that disposed of the matter.\r\n\r\n“Emily is only half Murray,” said Wallace. “Besides, times are\r\nchanging. You and Laura will not live forever, Elizabeth, and when you\r\nare gone New Moon goes to Oliver’s Andrew. In my opinion Emily should\r\nbe fitted to support herself if necessary.”\r\n\r\nEmily did not like Uncle Wallace but she was very grateful to him at\r\nthat moment. Whatever his motives were he was proposing the very thing\r\nshe secretly yearned for.\r\n\r\n“I would suggest,” said Uncle Wallace, “that she be sent to Queen’s\r\nAcademy to get a teacher’s license. Teaching is a genteel, lady-like\r\noccupation. _I_ will do my share in providing for the expense of it.”\r\n\r\nA blind person might have seen that Uncle Wallace thought this very\r\nsplendid of himself.\r\n\r\n“If you do,” thought Emily, “I’ll pay every cent back to you as soon as\r\nI’m able to earn it.”\r\n\r\nBut Aunt Elizabeth was adamant.\r\n\r\n“I do not believe in girls going out into the world,” she said. “I\r\ndon’t mean Emily to go to Queen’s. I told Mr. Carpenter so when he\r\ncame to see me about her taking up the Entrance work. He was very\r\nrude--school-teachers knew their place better in my father’s time. But\r\nI made him understand, I think. I’m rather surprised at _you_, Wallace.\r\nYou did not send your own daughter out to work.”\r\n\r\n“_My_ daughter had parents to provide for her,” retorted Uncle Wallace\r\npompously. “Emily is an orphan. I imagined from what I had heard about\r\nher that she would prefer earning her own living to living on charity.”\r\n\r\n“So I would,” cried out Emily. “So I would, Uncle Wallace. Oh, Aunt\r\nElizabeth, please let me study for the Entrance. Please! I’ll pay you\r\nback every cent you spend on it--I will indeed. I pledge you my word of\r\nhonour.”\r\n\r\n“It does not happen to be a question of money,” said Aunt Elizabeth\r\nin her stateliest manner. “I undertook to provide for you, Emily, and\r\nI will do it. When you are older I may send you to the High School in\r\nShrewbury for a couple of years. I am not decrying education. But you\r\nare not going to be a slave to the public--no Murray girl ever was\r\n_that_.”\r\n\r\nEmily realising the uselessness of pleading, went out in the same\r\nbitter disappointment she had felt after Mr. Carpenter’s visit. Then\r\nAunt Elizabeth looked at Wallace.\r\n\r\n“Have you forgotten what came of sending Juliet to Queen’s?” she asked\r\nsignificantly.\r\n\r\nIf Emily was not allowed to take up the Entrance classes, Perry\r\nhad no one to say him nay and he went at them with the same dogged\r\ndetermination he showed in all other matters. Perry’s status at New\r\nMoon had changed subtly and steadily. Aunt Elizabeth had ceased to\r\nrefer scornfully to him as “a hired boy.” Even she recognised that\r\nthough he was still indubitably a hired boy he was not going to remain\r\none, and she no longer objected to Laura’s patching up his ragged bits\r\nof clothing, or to Emily’s helping him with his lessons in the kitchen\r\nafter supper, nor did she growl when Cousin Jimmy began to pay him a\r\ncertain small wage--though older boys than Perry were still glad to put\r\nin the winter months choring for board and lodging in some comfortable\r\nhome. If a future premier was in the making at New Moon Aunt Elizabeth\r\nwanted to have some small share in the making. It was credible and\r\ncommendable that a boy should have ambitions. A girl was an entirely\r\ndifferent matter. A girl’s place was at home.\r\n\r\nEmily helped Perry work out algebra problems and heard his lessons in\r\nFrench and Latin. She picked up more thus than Aunt Elizabeth would\r\nhave approved and more still when the Entrance pupils talked those\r\nlanguages in school. It was quite an easy matter for a girl who had\r\nonce upon a time invented a language of her own. When George Bates,\r\nby way of showing off, asked her one day in French--_his_ French, of\r\nwhich Mr. Carpenter had once said doubtfully that perhaps God might\r\nunderstand it--“Have you the ink of my grandmother and the shoebrush of\r\nmy cousin and the umbrella of my aunt’s husband in your desk?” Emily\r\nretorted quite as glibly and _quite_ as Frenchily, “No, but I have the\r\npen of your father and the cheese of the innkeeper and the towel of\r\nyour uncle’s maidservant in my basket.”\r\n\r\nTo console herself for her disappointment in regard to the Entrance\r\nclass Emily wrote more poetry than ever. It was especially delightful\r\nto write poetry on a winter evening when the storm winds howled without\r\nand heaped the garden and orchard with big ghostly drifts, starred\r\nover with rabbits’ candles. She also wrote several stories--desperate\r\nlove affairs wherein she struggled heroically against the difficulties\r\nof affectionate dialogue; tales of bandits and pirates--Emily liked\r\nthese because there was no necessity for bandits and pirates to\r\nconverse lovingly; tragedies of earls and countesses whose conversation\r\nshe dearly loved to pepper with scraps of French; and a dozen other\r\nsubjects she didn’t know anything about. She also meditated beginning a\r\nnovel but decided it would be too hard to get enough paper for it. The\r\nletter-bills were all done now and the Jimmy-books were not big enough,\r\nthough a new one always appeared mysteriously in her school basket when\r\nthe old one was almost full. Cousin Jimmy seemed to have an uncanny\r\nprescience of the proper time--that was part of his Jimmyness.\r\n\r\nThen one night, as she lay in her lookout bed and watched a full moon\r\ngleaming lustrously from a cloudless sky across the valley, she had a\r\nsudden dazzling idea.\r\n\r\nShe would send her latest poem to the Charlottetown _Enterprise_.\r\n\r\nThe _Enterprise_ had a Poet’s Corner where “original” verses were\r\nfrequently printed. Privately Emily thought her own were quite as\r\ngood--as probably they were, for most of the _Enterprise_ “poems” were\r\nsad trash.\r\n\r\nEmily was so excited over the idea that she could not sleep for the\r\ngreater part of the night--and didn’t want to. It was glorious to lie\r\nthere, thrilling in the darkness, and picture the whole thing out. She\r\nsaw her verses in print signed E. Byrd Starr--she saw Aunt Laura’s\r\neyes shining with pride--she saw Mr. Carpenter pointing them out to\r\nstrangers--“the work of a pupil of mine, by gad”--she saw all her\r\nschoolmates envying her or admiring, according to type--she saw herself\r\nwith one foot at least firmly planted on the ladder of fame--one hill\r\nat least of the Alpine Path crested, with a new and glorious prospect\r\nopening therefrom.\r\n\r\nMorning came. Emily went to school, so absent-minded because of her\r\nsecret that she did badly in everything and was raged at by Mr.\r\nCarpenter. But it all slipped off her like the proverbial water off a\r\nduck’s back. Her body was in Blair Water school but her spirit was in\r\nkingdoms empyreal.\r\n\r\nAs soon as school was out she betook herself to the garret with half a\r\nsheet of blue-lined notepaper. Very painstakingly she copied down the\r\npoem, being especially careful to dot every _i_ and cross every _t_.\r\nShe wrote it on both sides of the paper, being in blissful ignorance\r\nof any taboo thereon. Then she read it aloud delightedly, not omitting\r\nthe title _Evening Dreams_. There was one line in it she tasted two or\r\nthree times:\r\n\r\n    The haunting elfin music of the air.\r\n\r\n“I think that line is _very_ good,” said Emily. “I wonder now how I\r\nhappened to think of it.”\r\n\r\nShe mailed her poem the next day and lived in a delicious mystic\r\nrapture until the following Saturday. When the _Enterprise_ came she\r\nopened it with tremulous eagerness and ice-cold fingers, and turned to\r\nthe Poet’s Corner. Now for her great moment!\r\n\r\nThere was not a sign of an Evening Dream about it!\r\n\r\nEmily threw down the _Enterprise_ and fled to the garret dormer where,\r\nface downward on the old haircloth sofa, she wept out her bitterness\r\nof disappointment. She drained the draught of failure to the very\r\ndregs. It was horribly real and tragic to her. She felt exactly as if\r\nshe had been slapped in the face. She was crushed in the very dust of\r\nhumiliation and was sure she could never rise again.\r\n\r\nHow thankful she was that she hadn’t told Teddy anything about it--she\r\nhad been so strongly tempted to, and only refrained because she didn’t\r\nwant to spoil the dramatic surprise of the moment when she would show\r\nhim the verses with her name signed to them. She _had_ told Perry,\r\nand Perry was furious when he saw her tear-stained face later on in\r\nthe dairy, as they strained the milk together. Ordinarily Emily loved\r\nthis, but to-night the savour had gone out of the world. Even the\r\nmilky splendour of the still, mild winter evening and the purple bloom\r\nover the hillside woods that presaged a thaw could not give her the\r\naccustomed soul-thrill.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to Charlottetown if I have to walk and I’ll bust that\r\n_Enterprise_ editor’s head,” said Perry, with the expression which,\r\nthirty years later, warned the members of his party to scatter for\r\ncover.\r\n\r\n“That wouldn’t be any use,” said Emily drearily. “He didn’t think it\r\ngood enough to print--that is what hurts me so, Perry--he didn’t think\r\nit any good. Busting his head wouldn’t change _that_.”\r\n\r\nIt took her a week to recover from the blow. Then she wrote a story\r\nin which the editor of the _Enterprise_ played the part of a dark and\r\ndesperate villain who found lodging eventually behind prison bars.\r\nThis got the venom out of her system and she forgot all about him in\r\nthe delight of writing a poem addressed to “Sweet Lady April.” But\r\nI question if she ever really forgave him--even when she discovered\r\neventually that you must _not_ write on both sides of the paper--even\r\nwhen she read over _Evening Dreams_ a year later and wondered how she\r\ncould ever have thought it any good.\r\n\r\nThis sort of thing was happening frequently now. Every time she read\r\nher little hoard of manuscripts over she found some of which the fairy\r\ngold had unaccountably turned to withered leaves, fit only for the\r\nburning. Emily burned them,--but it hurt her a little. Outgrowing\r\nthings we love is never a pleasant process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nSACRILEGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere had been several clashes between Aunt Elizabeth and Emily that\r\nwinter and spring. Generally Aunt Elizabeth came out victorious; there\r\nwas that in her that would not be denied the satisfaction of having\r\nher own way even in trifling matters. But once in a while she came up\r\nagainst that curious streak of granite in Emily’s composition which was\r\nunyielding and unbendable and unbreakable. Mary Murray, of a hundred\r\nyears agone, had been, so family chronicle ran, a gentle and submissive\r\ncreature generally; but she had that same streak in her, as her “Here I\r\nStay” abundantly testified. When Aunt Elizabeth tried conclusions with\r\nthat element in Emily she always got the worst of it. Yet she did not\r\nlearn wisdom therefrom but pursued her policy of repression all the\r\nmore rigorously; for it occasionally came home to her, as Laura let\r\ndown tucks, that Emily was on the verge of beginning to grow up and\r\nthat various breakers and reefs loomed ahead, ominously magnified in\r\nthe mist of unseen years. Emily must not be allowed to get out of hand\r\nnow, lest later on she make shipwreck as her mother had done--or as\r\nElizabeth Murray firmly believed she had done. There were, in short, to\r\nbe no more elopements from New Moon.\r\n\r\nOne of the things they fell out about was the fact that Emily, as Aunt\r\nElizabeth discovered one day, was in the habit of using more of her\r\negg money to buy paper than Aunt Elizabeth approved of. What did Emily\r\ndo with so much paper? They had a fuss over this and eventually Aunt\r\nElizabeth discovered that Emily was writing stories. Emily had been\r\nwriting stories all winter under Aunt Elizabeth’s very nose and Aunt\r\nElizabeth had never suspected it. She had fondly supposed that Emily\r\nwas writing school compositions. Aunt Elizabeth knew in a vague way\r\nthat Emily wrote silly rhymes which she called “poetry” but this did\r\nnot worry her especially. Jimmy made up a lot of similar trash. It was\r\nfoolish but harmless and Emily would doubtless outgrow it. Jimmy had\r\nnot outgrown it, to be sure, but then his accident--Elizabeth always\r\nwent a little sick in soul when she remembered it--had made him more or\r\nless a child for life.\r\n\r\nBut writing stories was a very different thing and Aunt Elizabeth was\r\nhorrified. Fiction of any kind was an abominable thing. Elizabeth\r\nMurray had been trained up in this belief in her youth and in her\r\nage she had not departed from it. She honestly thought that it was a\r\nwicked and sinful thing in anyone to play cards, dance, or go to the\r\ntheatre, read or write novels, and in Emily’s case there was a worse\r\nfeature--it was the Starr coming out in her--Douglas Starr especially.\r\nNo Murray of New Moon had ever been guilty of writing “stories” or of\r\never wanting to write them. It was an alien growth that must be pruned\r\noff ruthlessly. Aunt Elizabeth applied the pruning shears; and found\r\nno pliant, snippable root but that same underlying streak of granite.\r\nEmily was respectful and reasonable and above-board; she bought no\r\nmore paper with egg money; but she told Aunt Elizabeth that she could\r\nnot give up writing stories and she went right on writing them, on\r\npieces of brown wrapping paper and the blank backs of circulars which\r\nagricultural machinery firms sent Cousin Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you know that it is wicked to write novels?” demanded Aunt\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m not writing novels--yet,” said Emily. “I can’t get enough\r\npaper. These are just short stories. And it isn’t wicked--Father liked\r\nnovels.”\r\n\r\n“Your father--” began Aunt Elizabeth, and stopped. She remembered that\r\nEmily had “acted up” before now when anything derogatory was said of\r\nher father. But the very fact that she felt mysteriously compelled to\r\nstop annoyed Elizabeth, who had said what seemed good to her all her\r\nlife at New Moon without much regard for other people’s feelings.\r\n\r\n“You will not write any more of _this stuff_,” Aunt Elizabeth\r\ncontemptuously flourished “The Secret of the Castle” under Emily’s\r\nnose. “I forbid you--remember, I forbid you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I must write, Aunt Elizabeth,” said Emily gravely, folding her\r\nslender, beautiful hands on the table and looking straight into Aunt\r\nElizabeth’s angry face with the steady, unblinking gaze which Aunt Ruth\r\ncalled unchildlike. “You see, it’s this way. It is _in_ me. I can’t\r\nhelp it. And Father said I was _always_ to keep on writing. He said I\r\nwould be famous some day. Wouldn’t you like to have a famous niece,\r\nAunt Elizabeth?”\r\n\r\n“I am not going to argue the matter,” said Aunt Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n“I’m not arguing--only explaining.” Emily was exasperatingly\r\nrespectful. “I just want you to understand how it is that I _have_\r\nto go on writing stories, even though I am so very sorry you don’t\r\napprove.”\r\n\r\n“If you don’t give up this--this worse than nonsense, Emily,\r\nI’ll--I’ll--”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth stopped, not knowing what to say she would do. Emily\r\nwas too big now to be slapped or shut up; and it was no use to say,\r\nas she was tempted to, “I’ll send you away from New Moon,” because\r\nElizabeth Murray knew perfectly well she would not send Emily away from\r\nNew Moon--_could_ not send her away, indeed, though this knowledge\r\nwas as yet only in her feelings and had not been translated into her\r\nintellect. She only felt that she was helpless and it angered her;\r\nbut Emily was mistress of the situation and calmly went on writing\r\nstories. If Aunt Elizabeth had asked her to give up crocheting lace or\r\nmaking molasses taffy, or eating Aunt Laura’s delicious drop cookies,\r\nEmily would have done so wholly and cheerfully, though she loved\r\nthese things. But to give up writing stories--why, Aunt Elizabeth\r\nmight as well have asked her to give up breathing. _Why_ couldn’t she\r\nunderstand? It seemed so simple and indisputable to Emily.\r\n\r\n“Teddy can’t help making pictures and Ilse can’t help reciting and I\r\ncan’t help writing. _Don’t_ you see, Aunt Elizabeth?”\r\n\r\n“I see that you are an ungrateful and disobedient child,” said Aunt\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\nThis hurt Emily horribly, but she could not give in; and there\r\ncontinued to be a sense of soreness and disapproval between her and\r\nAunt Elizabeth in all the little details of daily life that poisoned\r\nexistence more or less for the child, who was so keenly sensitive to\r\nher environment and to the feelings with which her kindred regarded\r\nher. Emily felt it all the time--except when she was writing her\r\nstories. _Then_ she forgot everything, roaming in some enchanted\r\ncountry between the sun and moon, where she saw wonderful beings whom\r\nshe tried to describe and wonderful deeds which she tried to record,\r\ncoming back to the candle-lit kitchen with a somewhat dazed sense of\r\nhaving been years in No-Man’s Land.\r\n\r\nShe did not even have Aunt Laura to back her up in the matter. Aunt\r\nLaura thought Emily ought to yield in such an unimportant matter and\r\nplease Aunt Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n“But it’s not unimportant,” said Emily despairingly. “It’s the most\r\nimportant thing in the world to me, Aunt Laura. Oh, I thought _you_\r\nwould understand.”\r\n\r\n“I understand that you like to do it, dear, and I think it’s a harmless\r\nenough amusement. But it seems to annoy Elizabeth some way and I do\r\nthink you might give it up on that account. It is not as if it was\r\nanything that mattered much--it _is_ really a waste of time.”\r\n\r\n“No--no,” said distressed Emily. “Why, some day, Aunt Laura, I’ll\r\nwrite real books--and make lots of money,” she added, sensing that the\r\nbusinesslike Murrays measured the nature of most things on a cash basis.\r\n\r\nAunt Laura smiled indulgently.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid you’ll never grow rich that way, dear. It would be wiser to\r\nemploy your time preparing yourself for some useful work.”\r\n\r\nIt was maddening to be condescended to like this--maddening that nobody\r\ncould see that she _had_ to write--maddening to have Aunt Laura so\r\nsweet and loving and stupid about it.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” thought Emily bitterly, “if that hateful _Enterprise_ editor had\r\nprinted my piece they’d have believed _then_.”\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” advised Aunt Laura, “don’t let Elizabeth _see_ you\r\nwriting them.”\r\n\r\nBut somehow Emily could not take this prudent advice. There _had_\r\nbeen occasions when she had connived with Aunt Laura to hoodwink\r\nAunt Elizabeth on some little matter, but she found she could not do\r\nit in this. _This_ had to be open and above-board. She _must_ write\r\nstories--and Aunt Elizabeth _must_ know it--that was the way it had to\r\nbe. She could not be false to herself in this--she could not _pretend_\r\nto be false.\r\n\r\nShe wrote her father all about it--poured out her bitterness and\r\nperplexity to him in what, though she did not suspect it at the time,\r\nwas the last letter she was to write him. There was a large bundle\r\nof letters by now on the old sofa shelf in the garret--for Emily had\r\nwritten many letters to her father besides those which have been\r\nchronicled in this history. There were a great many paragraphs about\r\nAunt Elizabeth in them, most of them very uncomplimentary and some\r\nof them, as Emily herself would have owned when her first bitterness\r\nwas past, overdrawn and exaggerated. They had been written in moments\r\nwhen her hurt and angry soul demanded some outlet for its emotion and\r\nbarbed her pen with venom. Emily was mistress of a subtly malicious\r\nstyle when she chose to be. After she had written them the hurt had\r\nceased and she thought no more about them. But they remained.\r\n\r\nAnd one spring day, Aunt Elizabeth, housecleaning in the garret while\r\nEmily played happily with Teddy at the Tansy Patch, found the bundle of\r\nletters on the sofa shelf, sat down, and read them all.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Murray would never have read any writing belonging\r\nto a grown person. But it never occurred to her that there was\r\nanything dishonourable in reading the letters wherein Emily, lonely\r\nand--sometimes--misunderstood, had poured out her heart to the father\r\nshe had loved and been loved by, so passionately and understandingly.\r\nAunt Elizabeth thought she had a right to know everything that this\r\npensioner on her bounty did, said, or thought. She read the letters\r\nand she found out what Emily thought of her--of her, Elizabeth Murray,\r\nautocrat unchallenged, to whom no one had ever dared to say anything\r\nuncomplimentary. Such an experience is no pleasanter at sixty than\r\nat sixteen. As Elizabeth Murray folded up the last letter her hands\r\ntrembled--with anger, and something underneath it that was not anger.\r\n\r\n“Emily, your Aunt Elizabeth wants to see you in the parlour,” said\r\nAunt Laura, when Emily returned from the Tansy Patch, driven home by\r\nthe thin grey rain that had begun to drift over the greening fields.\r\nHer tone--her sorrowful look--warned Emily that mischief was in the\r\nwind. Emily had no idea what mischief--she could not recall anything\r\nshe had done recently that should bring her up before the tribunal\r\nAunt Elizabeth occasionally held in the parlour. It must be serious\r\nwhen it was in the parlour. For reasons best known to herself Aunt\r\nElizabeth held super-serious interviews like this in the parlour.\r\nPossibly it was because she felt obscurely that the photographs of\r\nthe Murrays on the walls gave her a backing she needed when dealing\r\nwith this hop-out-of-kin; for the same reason Emily detested a trial in\r\nthe parlour. She always felt on such occasions like a very small mouse\r\nsurrounded by a circle of grim cats.\r\n\r\nEmily skipped across the big hall, pausing, in spite of her alarm, to\r\nglance at the charming red world through the crimson glass; then pushed\r\nopen the parlour door. The room was dim, for only one of the slat\r\nblinds was partially raised. Aunt Elizabeth was sitting bolt upright in\r\nGrandfather Murray’s black horsehair-chair. Emily looked at her stern,\r\nangry face first--and then at her lap.\r\n\r\nEmily understood.\r\n\r\nThe first thing she did was to retrieve her precious letters. With the\r\nquickness of light she sprang to Aunt Elizabeth, snatched up the bundle\r\nand retreated to the door; there she faced Aunt Elizabeth, her face\r\nblazing with indignation and outrage. Sacrilege had been committed--the\r\nmost sacred shrine of her soul had been profaned.\r\n\r\n“How dare you?” she said. “How dare you touch _my private papers_, Aunt\r\nElizabeth?”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth had not expected _this_. She had looked for\r\nconfusion--dismay--shame--fear--for anything but this righteous\r\nindignation, as if _she_, forsooth, were the guilty one. She rose.\r\n\r\n“Give me those letters, Emily.”\r\n\r\n“No, I will not,” said Emily, white with anger, as she clasped her\r\nhands around the bundle. “They are mine and Father’s--not yours. You\r\nhad no right to touch them. I will _never_ forgive you!”\r\n\r\nThis was turning the tables with a vengeance. Aunt Elizabeth was so\r\ndumfounded that she hardly knew what to say or do. Worst of all, a most\r\nunpleasant doubt of her own conduct suddenly assailed her--driven home\r\nperhaps by the intensity and earnestness of Emily’s accusation. For\r\nthe first time in her life it occurred to Elizabeth Murray to wonder if\r\nshe had done rightly. For the first time in her life she felt ashamed;\r\nand the shame made her furious. It was intolerable that _she_ should be\r\nmade to feel ashamed.\r\n\r\nFor the moment they faced each other, not as aunt and niece, not as\r\nchild and adult, but as two human beings each with hatred for the other\r\nin her heart--Elizabeth Murray, tall and austere and thin-lipped; Emily\r\nStarr, white of face, her eyes pools of black flame, her trembling arms\r\nhugging her letters.\r\n\r\n“So _this_ is your gratitude,” said Aunt Elizabeth. “You were a\r\npenniless orphan--I took you to my home--I have given you shelter and\r\nfood and education and kindness--and _this_ is my thanks.”\r\n\r\nAs yet Emily’s tempest of anger and resentment prevented her from\r\nfeeling the sting of this.\r\n\r\n“You did not _want_ to take me,” she said. “You made me draw lots and\r\nyou took me because the lot fell to you. You knew some of you had to\r\ntake me because you were the proud Murrays and couldn’t let a relation\r\ngo to an orphan asylum. Aunt Laura loves me now but you don’t. So why\r\nshould I love you?”\r\n\r\n“Ungrateful, thankless child!”\r\n\r\n“I’m _not_ thankless. I’ve tried to be good--I’ve tried to obey you and\r\nplease you--I do all the chores I can to help pay for my keep. And you\r\nhad _no business_ to read my letters to Father.”\r\n\r\n“They are disgraceful letters--and must be destroyed,” said Aunt\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\n“No,” Emily clasped them tighter. “I’d sooner burn myself. You shall\r\nnot have them, Aunt Elizabeth.”\r\n\r\nShe felt her brows drawing together--she felt the Murray look on her\r\nface--she knew she was conquering.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Murray turned paler, if that were possible. There were\r\ntimes when she could give the Murray look herself; it was not that\r\nwhich dismayed her--it was the uncanny something which seemed to\r\npeer out behind the Murray look that always broke her will. She\r\ntrembled--faltered--yielded.\r\n\r\n“Keep your letters,” she said bitterly, “and scorn the old woman who\r\nopened her home to you.”\r\n\r\nShe went out of the parlour. Emily was left mistress of the field. And\r\nall at once her victory turned to dust and ashes in her mouth.\r\n\r\nShe went up to her own room, hid her letters in the cupboard over the\r\nmantel, and then crept up on her bed, huddling down in a little heap\r\nwith her face buried in her pillow. She was still sore with a sense of\r\noutrage--but underneath another pain was beginning to ache terribly.\r\n\r\nSomething in her was hurt because she had hurt Aunt Elizabeth--for\r\nshe felt that Aunt Elizabeth, under all her anger, was _hurt_. This\r\nsurprised Emily. She would have expected Aunt Elizabeth to be angry, of\r\ncourse, but she would never have supposed it would affect her in any\r\nother way. Yet she had seen something in Aunt Elizabeth’s eyes when she\r\nhad flung that last stinging sentence at her--something that spoke of\r\nbitter hurt.\r\n\r\n“Oh! Oh!” gasped Emily. She began to cry chokingly into her pillow. She\r\nwas so wretched that she could not get out of herself and watch her\r\nown suffering with a sort of enjoyment in its drama--set her mind to\r\nanalyse her feelings--and when Emily was as wretched as that she was\r\nvery wretched indeed and wholly comfortless. Aunt Elizabeth would not\r\nkeep her at New Moon after a poisonous quarrel like this. She would\r\nsend her away, of course. Emily believed this. Nothing was too horrible\r\nto believe just then. How could she live away from dear New Moon?\r\n\r\n“And I may have to live eighty years,” Emily moaned.\r\n\r\nBut worse even than this was the remembrance of that look in Aunt\r\nElizabeth’s eyes.\r\n\r\nHer own sense of outrage and sacrilege ebbed away under the\r\nremembrance. She thought of all the things she had written her father\r\nabout Aunt Elizabeth--sharp, bitter things, some of them just, some of\r\nthem unjust. She began to feel that she should not have written them.\r\nIt was true enough that Aunt Elizabeth had not loved her--had not\r\nwanted to take her to New Moon. But she _had_ taken her and though it\r\nhad been done in duty, not in love, the fact remained. It was no use\r\nfor her to tell herself that it wasn’t as if the letters were written\r\nto any one living, to be seen and read by others. While she was under\r\nAunt Elizabeth’s roof--while she owed the food she ate and the clothes\r\nshe wore to Aunt Elizabeth--she should not say, even to her father,\r\nharsh things of her. A Starr should not have done it.\r\n\r\n“I must go and ask Aunt Elizabeth to forgive me,” thought Emily at\r\nlast, all the passion gone out of her and only regret and repentance\r\nleft. “I suppose she never will--she’ll hate me always now. But I must\r\ngo.”\r\n\r\nShe turned herself about--and then the door opened and Aunt Elizabeth\r\nentered. She came across the room and stood at the side of the bed,\r\nlooking down at the grieved little face on the pillow--a face that in\r\nthe dim, rainy twilight, with its tear-stains and black shadowed eyes,\r\nlooked strangely mature and chiseled.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Murray was still austere and cold. Her voice sounded stern;\r\nbut she said an amazing thing.\r\n\r\n“Emily, I had no right to read your letters. I admit I was wrong. Will\r\nyou forgive me?”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” The word was almost a cry. Aunt Elizabeth had at last discerned\r\nthe way to conquer Emily. The latter lifted herself up, flung her arms\r\nabout Aunt Elizabeth, and said chokingly,\r\n\r\n“Oh--Aunt Elizabeth--I’m sorry--I’m sorry--I shouldn’t have written\r\nthose things--but I wrote them when I was vexed--and I didn’t mean\r\nthem _all_--truly, I didn’t mean the worst of them. Oh, you’ll believe\r\n_that_, won’t you, Aunt Elizabeth?”\r\n\r\n“I’d like to believe it, Emily.” An odd quiver passed through the\r\ntall, rigid form. “I--don’t like to think you--_hate_ me--my sister’s\r\nchild--little Juliet’s child.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t--oh, I don’t,” sobbed Emily. “And I’ll _love_ you, Aunt\r\nElizabeth, if you’ll let me--if you _want_ me to. I didn’t think you\r\ncared. _Dear_ Aunt Elizabeth.”\r\n\r\nEmily gave Aunt Elizabeth a fierce hug and a passionate kiss on the\r\nwhite, fine-wrinkled cheek. Aunt Elizabeth kissed her gravely on the\r\nbrow in return and then said, as if closing the door on the whole\r\nincident,\r\n\r\n“You’d better wash your face and come down to supper.”\r\n\r\nBut there was yet something to be cleared up.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Elizabeth,” whispered Emily. “I _can’t_ burn those letters, you\r\nknow--they belong to Father. But I’ll tell you what I will do. I’ll go\r\nover them all and put a star by anything I said about you and then I’ll\r\nadd an explanatory footnote saying that I was mistaken.”\r\n\r\nEmily spent her spare time for several days putting in her “explanatory\r\nfootnotes,” and then her conscience had rest. But when she again tried\r\nto write a letter to her father she found that it no longer meant\r\nanything to her. The sense of reality--nearness--of close communion had\r\ngone. Perhaps she had been outgrowing it gradually, as childhood began\r\nto merge into girlhood--perhaps the bitter scene with Aunt Elizabeth\r\nhad only shaken into dust something out of which the spirit had already\r\ndeparted. But, whatever the explanation, it was not possible to write\r\nsuch letters any more. She missed them terribly but she could not go\r\nback to them. A certain door of life was shut behind her and could not\r\nbe re-opened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nWHEN THE CURTAIN LIFTED\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be pleasant to be able to record that after the reconciliation\r\nin the lookout Emily and Aunt Elizabeth lived in entire amity and\r\nharmony. But the truth was that things went on pretty much the same as\r\nbefore. Emily went softly, and tried to mingle serpent’s wisdom and\r\ndove’s harmlessness in practical proportions, but their points of view\r\nwere so different that there were bound to be clashes; they did not\r\nspeak the same language, so there was bound to be misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nAnd yet there was a difference--a very vital difference. Elizabeth\r\nMurray had learned an important lesson--that there was not one law of\r\nfairness for children and another for grown-ups. She continued to be\r\nas autocratic as ever--but she did not do or say to Emily anything she\r\nwould not have done or said to Laura had occasion called for it.\r\n\r\nEmily, on her side, had discovered the fact that, under all her surface\r\ncoldness and sternness, Aunt Elizabeth really had an affection for her;\r\nand it was wonderful what a difference this made. It took the sting\r\nout of Aunt Elizabeth’s “ways” and words and healed entirely a certain\r\nlittle half-conscious sore spot that had been in Emily’s heart ever\r\nsince the incident of the drawn slips at Maywood.\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe I’m a duty to Aunt Elizabeth any more,” she thought\r\nexultantly.\r\n\r\nEmily grew rapidly that summer in body, mind and soul. Life was\r\ndelightful, growing richer every hour, like an unfolding rose. Forms of\r\nbeauty filled her imagination and were transferred as best she could\r\nto paper, though they were never so lovely there, and Emily had the\r\nheartbreaking moments of the true artist who discovers that\r\n\r\n    “Never on painter’s canvas lives\r\n    The charm of his fancy’s dream.”\r\n\r\nMuch of her “old stuff” she burned; even the _Child of the Sea_ was\r\nreduced to ashes. But the little pile of manuscripts in the mantel\r\ncupboard of the lookout was growing steadily larger. Emily kept her\r\nscribblings there now; the sofa shelf in the garret was desecrated;\r\nand, besides, she felt somehow that Aunt Elizabeth would never meddle\r\nwith her “private papers” again, no matter where they were kept. She\r\ndid not go now to the garret to read or write or dream; her own dear\r\nlookout was the best place for that. She loved that quaint, little old\r\nroom intensely; it was almost like a living thing to her--a sharer in\r\ngladness--a comforter in sorrow.\r\n\r\nIlse was growing, too, blossoming out into strange beauty and\r\nbrilliance, knowing no law but her own pleasure, recognizing no\r\nauthority but her own whim. Aunt Laura worried over her.\r\n\r\n“She will be a woman so soon--and _who_ will look after her? Allan\r\nwon’t.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve no patience with Allan,” said Aunt Elizabeth grimly. “He is\r\nalways ready to hector and advise other people. He’d better look at\r\nhome. He’ll come over here and order me to do this or that, or _not_ to\r\ndo it, for Emily; but if I say one word to him about Ilse he blows the\r\nroof off. The idea of a man turning against his daughter and neglecting\r\nher as he has neglected Ilse simply because her mother wasn’t all she\r\nought to be--as if the poor child was to blame for _that_.”\r\n\r\n“S--s--sh,” said Aunt Laura, as Emily crossed the sitting-room on her\r\nway upstairs.\r\n\r\nEmily smiled sadly to herself. Aunt Laura needn’t be “s-s-sh’ing.”\r\nThere was nothing left for her to find out about Ilse’s\r\nmother--nothing, except the most important thing of all, which neither\r\nshe nor anybody else living knew. For Emily had never surrendered her\r\nconviction that the whole truth about Beatrice Burnley was not known.\r\nShe often worried about it when she lay curled up in her black walnut\r\nbed o’nights, listening to the moan of the gulf and the Wind Woman\r\nsinging in the trees, and drifted into sleep wishing intensely that she\r\ncould solve the dark old mystery and dissolve its legend of shame and\r\nbitterness.\r\n\r\nEmily went rather languidly upstairs to the lookout. She meant to\r\nwrite some more of her story, _The Ghost of the Well_, wherein she\r\nwas weaving the old legend of the well in the Lee field; but somehow\r\ninterest was lacking; she put the manuscript back into the mantel\r\ncupboard; she read over a letter from Dean Priest which had come that\r\nday, one of his fat, jolly, whimsical, delightful letters wherein he\r\nhad told her that he was coming to stay a month with his sister at\r\nBlair Water. She wondered why this announcement did not excite her\r\nmore. She was tired--her head was aching. Emily couldn’t remember ever\r\nhaving had a headache before. Since she could not write she decided to\r\nlie down and be _Lady Trevanion_ for awhile. Emily was _Lady Trevanion_\r\nvery often that summer, in one of the dream lives she had begun to\r\nbuild up for herself. _Lady Trevanion_ was the wife of an English earl\r\nand, besides being a famous novelist, was a member of the British House\r\nof Commons--where she always appeared in black velvet with a stately\r\ncoronet of pearls on her dark hair. She was the only woman in the House\r\nand, as this was before the days of the suffragettes, she had to endure\r\nmany sneers and innuendoes and insults from the ungallant males around\r\nher. Emily’s favourite dream scene was where she rose to make her first\r\nspeech--a wonderfully thrilling event. As Emily found it difficult\r\nto do justice to the scene in any ideas of her own, she always fell\r\nback on “Pitt’s reply to Walpole,” which she had found in her _Royal\r\nReader_, and declaimed it, with suitable variations. The insolent\r\nspeaker who had provoked _Lady Trevanion_ into speech had sneered at\r\nher as a _woman_, and _Lady Trevanion_, a magnificent creature in her\r\nvelvet and pearls, rose to her feet, amid hushed and dramatic silence,\r\nand said,\r\n\r\n“The atrocious crime of being a _woman_ which the honourable member\r\nhas, with such spirit and decency, charged upon me, I shall attempt\r\nneither to palliate nor deny, but shall content myself with wishing\r\nthat I may be one of those whose follies cease with their _sex_ and\r\n_not_ one of that number who are ignorant in spite of _manhood_ and\r\nexperience.”\r\n\r\n(Here she was always interrupted by thunders of applause.)\r\n\r\nBut the savour was entirely lacking in this scene today and by the\r\ntime Emily had reached the line, “But _womanhood_, Sir, is not my only\r\ncrime”--she gave up in disgust and fell to worrying over Ilse’s mother\r\nagain, mixed up with some uneasy speculations regarding the climax of\r\nher story about the ghost of the well, mingled with her unpleasant\r\nphysical sensations.\r\n\r\nHer eyes hurt her when she moved them. She was chilly, although the\r\nJuly day was hot. She was still lying there when Aunt Elizabeth came up\r\nto ask why she hadn’t gone to bring the cows home from the pasture.\r\n\r\n“I--I didn’t know it was so late,” said Emily confusedly. “I--my head\r\naches, Aunt Elizabeth.”\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth rolled up the white cotton blind and looked at Emily.\r\nShe noted her flushed face--she felt her pulse. Then she bade her\r\nshortly to stay where she was, went down, and sent Perry for Dr.\r\nBurnley.\r\n\r\n“Probably she’s got the measles,” said the doctor as gruffly as usual.\r\nEmily was not yet sick enough to be gentle over. “There’s an outbreak\r\nof them at Derry Pond. Has she had any chance to catch them?”\r\n\r\n“Jimmy Joe Belle’s two children were here one afternoon about ten days\r\nago. She played with them--she’s always playing round with people\r\nshe’s no business to associate with. I haven’t heard that they were or\r\nhave been sick though.”\r\n\r\nJimmy Joe Belle, when asked plainly, confessed that his “young ones”\r\nhad come out with measles the very day after they had been at New Moon.\r\nThere was therefore not much doubt as to Emily’s malady.\r\n\r\n“It’s a bad kind of measles apparently,” the doctor said. “Quite a\r\nnumber of the Derry Pond children have died of it. Mostly French\r\nthough--the kids would be out of bed when they had no business to be\r\nand caught cold. I don’t think you need worry about Emily. She might as\r\nwell have measles and be done with it. Keep her warm and keep the room\r\ndark. I’ll run over in the morning.”\r\n\r\nFor three or four days nobody was much alarmed. Measles was a disease\r\neverybody had to have. Aunt Elizabeth looked after Emily well and slept\r\non a sofa which had been moved into the lookout. She even left the\r\nwindow open at night. In spite of this--perhaps Aunt Elizabeth thought\r\nbecause of it--Emily grew steadily sicker, and on the fifth day a sharp\r\nchange for the worse took place. Her fever went up rapidly, delirium\r\nset in; Dr. Burnley came, looked anxious, scowled, changed the medicine.\r\n\r\n“I’m sent for to a bad case of pneumonia at White Cross,” he said, “and\r\nI have to go to Charlottetown in the morning to be present at Mrs.\r\nJackwell’s operation. I promised her I would go. I’ll be back in the\r\nevening. Emily is very restless--that high-strung system of hers is\r\nevidently very sensitive to fever. What’s that nonsense she’s talking\r\nabout the Wind Woman?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t know,” said Aunt Elizabeth worriedly. “She’s always\r\ntalking nonsense like that, even when she’s well. Allan, tell me\r\nplainly--is there any danger?”\r\n\r\n“There’s always danger in this type of measles. I don’t like these\r\nsymptoms--the eruption should be out by now and there’s no sign of\r\nit. Her fever is very high--but I don’t think we need be alarmed\r\nyet. If I thought otherwise I wouldn’t go to town. Keep her as quiet\r\nas possible--humour her whims if you can--I don’t like that mental\r\ndisturbance. She looks terribly distressed--seems to be worrying over\r\nsomething. Has she had anything on her mind of late?”\r\n\r\n“Not that I know of,” said Aunt Elizabeth. She had a sudden bitter\r\nrealisation that she really did not know much about the child’s mind.\r\nEmily would never have come to her with any of her little troubles and\r\nworries.\r\n\r\n“Emily, what is bothering you?” asked Dr. Burnley softly--very softly.\r\nHe took the hot, tossing, little hand gently, oh, so gently, in his big\r\none.\r\n\r\nEmily looked up with wild, fever-bright eyes.\r\n\r\n“She couldn’t have done it--she _couldn’t_ have done it.”\r\n\r\n“Of course she couldn’t,” said the doctor cheerily. “Don’t worry--she\r\ndidn’t do it.”\r\n\r\nHis eyes telegraphed, “What does she mean?” to Elizabeth, but Elizabeth\r\nshook her head.\r\n\r\n“Who are you talking about--dear?” she asked Emily. It was the first\r\ntime she had called Emily “dear.”\r\n\r\nBut Emily was off on another tack. The well in Mr. Lee’s field was\r\nopen, she declared. Someone would be sure to fall into it. Why didn’t\r\nMr. Lee shut it up? Dr. Burnley left Aunt Elizabeth trying to reassure\r\nEmily on that point and hurried away to White Cross.\r\n\r\nAt the door he nearly fell over Perry who was curled up on the\r\nsandstone slab, hugging his sunburned legs desperately. “How is Emily?”\r\nhe demanded, grasping the skirt of the doctor’s coat.\r\n\r\n“Don’t bother me--I’m in a hurry,” growled the doctor.\r\n\r\n“You tell me how Emily is or I’ll hang on to your coat till the seams\r\ngo,” said Perry stubbornly. “I can’t get one word of sense out of them\r\nold maids. _You_ tell me.”\r\n\r\n“She’s a sick child but I’m not seriously alarmed about her yet.” The\r\ndoctor gave his coat another tug--but Perry held on for a last word.\r\n\r\n“You’ve _got_ to cure her,” he said. “If anything happens to Emily I’ll\r\ndrown myself in the pond--mind that.”\r\n\r\nHe let go so suddenly that Dr. Burnley nearly went headlong on the\r\nground. Then Perry curled up on the doorstep again. He watched there\r\nuntil Laura and Cousin Jimmy had gone to bed and then he sneaked\r\nthrough the house and sat on the stairs, where he could hear any sound\r\nin Emily’s room. He sat there all night, with his fists clenched, as if\r\nkeeping guard against an unseen foe.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Murray watched by Emily until two o’clock, and then Laura\r\ntook her place.\r\n\r\n“She has raved a great deal,” said Aunt Elizabeth. “I wish I knew what\r\nis worrying her--there _is_ something, I feel sure. It isn’t all mere\r\ndelirium. She keeps repeating ‘She couldn’t have done it’ in such\r\nimploring tones. I wonder oh, Laura, you remember the time I read her\r\nletters? Do you think she means me?”\r\n\r\nLaura shook her head. She had never seen Elizabeth so moved.\r\n\r\n“If the child--doesn’t get--better--” said Aunt Elizabeth. She said no\r\nmore but went quickly out of the room.\r\n\r\nLaura sat down by the bed. She was pale and drawn with her own worry\r\nand fatigue--for she had not been able to sleep. She loved Emily as\r\nher own child and the awful dread that had possessed her heart would\r\nnot lift for an instant. She sat there and prayed mutely. Emily fell\r\ninto a troubled slumber which lasted until the grey dawn crept into\r\nthe lookout. Then she opened her eyes and looked at Aunt Laura--looked\r\nthrough her--looked beyond her.\r\n\r\n“I see her coming over the fields,” she said in a high, clear voice.\r\n“She is coming so gladly--she is singing--she is thinking of her\r\nbaby--oh, keep her back--keep her back--she doesn’t see the well--it’s\r\nso dark she doesn’t see it--oh, she’s gone into it--she’s gone into it!”\r\n\r\nEmily’s voice rose in a piercing shriek which penetrated to Aunt\r\nElizabeth’s room and brought her flying across the hall in her flannel\r\nnightgown.\r\n\r\n“What is wrong, Laura?” she gasped.\r\n\r\nLaura was trying to soothe Emily, who was struggling to sit up in bed.\r\nHer cheeks were crimson and her eyes had still the same far, wild look.\r\n\r\n“Emily--Emily, darling, you’ve just had a bad dream. The old Lee well\r\nisn’t open--nobody has fallen into it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, somebody has,” said Emily shrilly. “_She_ has--I saw her--I saw\r\nher--with the ace of hearts on her forehead. Do you think I don’t know\r\nher?”\r\n\r\nShe fell back on her pillow, moaned, and tossed the hands which Laura\r\nMurray had loosened in her surprise.\r\n\r\nThe two ladies of New Moon looked at each other across her bed in\r\ndismay--and something like terror.\r\n\r\n“Who did you see, Emily?” asked Aunt Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n“Ilse’s mother--of course. I always knew she didn’t do that dreadful\r\nthing. She fell into the old well--she’s there now--go--go and get her\r\nout, Aunt Laura. _Please._”\r\n\r\n“Yes--yes, of course we’ll get her out, darling,” said Aunt Laura,\r\nsoothingly.\r\n\r\nEmily sat up in bed and looked at Aunt Laura again. This time she did\r\nnot look through her--she looked into her. Laura Murray felt that\r\nthose burning eyes read her soul.\r\n\r\n“You are lying to me,” cried Emily. “You don’t mean to try to get\r\nher out. You are only saying it to put me off. Aunt Elizabeth,” she\r\nsuddenly turned and caught Aunt Elizabeth’s hand, “you’ll do it for me,\r\nwon’t you? You’ll go and get her out of the old well, won’t you?”\r\n\r\nElizabeth remembered that Dr. Burnley had said that Emily’s whims must\r\nbe humoured. She was terrified by the child’s condition.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I’ll get her out if she is in there,” she said. Emily released\r\nher hand and sank down. The wild glare left her eyes. A great sudden\r\ncalm fell over her anguished little face.\r\n\r\n“I know _you’ll_ keep your word,” she said. “You are very hard--but\r\n_you_ never lie, Aunt Elizabeth.”\r\n\r\nElizabeth Murray went back to her own room and dressed herself with her\r\nshaking fingers. A little later, when Emily had fallen into a quiet\r\nsleep, Laura went down stairs and heard Elizabeth giving Cousin Jimmy\r\nsome orders in the kitchen.\r\n\r\n“Elizabeth, you don’t really mean to have that old well searched?”\r\n\r\n“I do,” said Elizabeth resolutely. “I know it’s nonsense as well as\r\nyou do. But I had to promise it to quiet her down--and I’ll keep my\r\npromise. You heard what she said--she believed I wouldn’t lie to her.\r\nNor will I. Jimmy, you will go over to James Lee’s after breakfast and\r\nask him to come here.”\r\n\r\n“How has she heard the story?” said Laura.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know--oh, some one has told her, of course--perhaps that old\r\ndemon of a Nancy Priest. It doesn’t matter who. She _has_ heard it\r\nand the thing is to keep her quiet. It isn’t so much of a job to put\r\nladders in the well and get some one to go down it. The thing that\r\nmatters is the absurdity of it.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll be laughed at for a pair of fools,” protested Laura, whose share\r\nof Murray pride was in hot revolt. “And besides, it will open up all\r\nthe old scandal again.”\r\n\r\n“No matter. I’ll keep my word to the child,” said Elizabeth stubbornly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAllan Burnley came to New Moon at sunset, on his way home from town. He\r\nwas tired, for he had been going night and day for over a week; he was\r\nmore worried than he had admitted over Emily; he looked old and rather\r\ndesolate as he stepped into the New Moon kitchen.\r\n\r\nOnly Cousin Jimmy was there. Cousin Jimmy did not seem to have much to\r\ndo, although it was a good hay-day and Jimmy Joe Belle and Perry were\r\nhauling in the great fragrant, sun-dried loads. He sat by the western\r\nwindow with a strange expression on his face.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Jimmy, where are the girls? And how is Emily?”\r\n\r\n“Emily is better,” said Cousin Jimmy. “The rash is out and her fever\r\nhas gone down. I think she’s asleep.”\r\n\r\n“Good. We couldn’t afford to lose that little girl, could we, Jimmy?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Jimmy. But he did not seem to want to talk about it. “Laura\r\nand Elizabeth are in the sitting-room. They want to see you.” He paused\r\na minute and then added in an eerie way, “There is nothing hidden that\r\nshall not be revealed.”\r\n\r\nIt occurred to Allan Burnley that Jimmy was acting mysteriously. And\r\nif Laura and Elizabeth wanted to see him why didn’t they come out? It\r\nwasn’t like them to stand on ceremony in this fashion. He pushed open\r\nthe sitting-room door impatiently.\r\n\r\nLaura Murray was sitting on the sofa, leaning her head on its arm. He\r\ncould not see her face but he felt that she was crying. Elizabeth\r\nwas sitting bolt upright on a chair. She wore her second-best black\r\nsilk and her second-best lace cap. And she, too, had been crying. Dr.\r\nBurnley never attached much importance to Laura’s tears, easy as those\r\nof most women, but that Elizabeth Murray should cry--had he ever seen\r\nher cry before?\r\n\r\nThe thought of Ilse flashed into his mind--his little neglected\r\ndaughter. Had anything happened to Ilse?\r\n\r\nIn one dreadful moment Allan Burnley paid the price of his treatment of\r\nhis child.\r\n\r\n“What is wrong?” he exclaimed in his gruffest manner.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Allan,” said Elizabeth Murray. “God forgive us--God forgive us\r\nall!”\r\n\r\n“It--is--Ilse,” said Dr. Burnley, dully.\r\n\r\n“No--no--not Ilse.”\r\n\r\nThen she told him--she told him what had been found at the bottom of\r\nthe old Lee well--she told him what had been the real fate of the\r\nlovely, laughing young wife whose name for twelve bitter years had\r\nnever crossed his lips.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was not until the next evening that Emily saw the doctor. She was\r\nlying in bed, weak and limp, red as a beet with the measles rash, but\r\nquite herself again. Allan Burnley stood by the bed and looked down at\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“Emily--dear little child--do you know what you have done for me? God\r\nknows how you did it.”\r\n\r\n“I thought you didn’t believe in God,” said Emily, wonderingly.\r\n\r\n“You have given me back my faith in Him, Emily.”\r\n\r\n“Why, what have I done?”\r\n\r\nDr. Burnley saw that she had no remembrance of her delirium. Laura had\r\ntold him that she had slept long and soundly after Elizabeth’s promise\r\nand had awakened with fever gone and the eruption fast coming out. She\r\nhad asked nothing and they had said nothing.\r\n\r\n“When you are better we will tell you all,” he said, smiling down at\r\nher. There was something very sorrowful in the smile--and yet something\r\nvery sweet.\r\n\r\n“He is smiling with his eyes as well as his mouth now,” thought Emily.\r\n\r\n“How--how did she know?” whispered Laura Murray to him when he went\r\ndown. “I--can’t understand it, Allan.”\r\n\r\n“Nor I. These things are beyond us, Laura,” he answered gravely. “I\r\nonly know this child has given Beatrice back to me, stainless and\r\nbeloved. It can be explained rationally enough perhaps. Emily has\r\nevidently been told about Beatrice and worried over it--her repeated\r\n‘she couldn’t have done it’ shows that. And the tales of the old Lee\r\nwell naturally made a deep impression on the mind of a sensitive child\r\nkeenly alive to dramatic values. In her delirium she mixed this all up\r\nwith the well-known fact of Jimmy’s tumble into the New Moon well--and\r\nthe rest was coincidence. I would have explained it all so myself\r\nonce--but now--now, Laura, I only say humbly, ‘A little child shall\r\nlead them.’”\r\n\r\n“Our stepmother’s mother was a Highland Scotchwoman. They said she had\r\nthe second sight,” said Elizabeth. “I never believed in it--before.”\r\n\r\nThe excitement of Blair Water had died away before Emily was deemed\r\nstrong enough to hear the story. That which had been found in the old\r\nLee well had been buried in the Mitchell plot at Shrewsbury and a\r\nwhite marble shaft, “Sacred to the memory of Beatrice Burnley, beloved\r\nwife of Allan Burnley,” had been erected. The sensation caused by Dr.\r\nBurnley’s presence every Sunday in the old Burnley pew had died away.\r\nOn the first evening that Emily was allowed to sit up Aunt Laura told\r\nher the whole story. Her manner of telling stripped it forever of the\r\ntaint and innuendo left by Aunt Nancy.\r\n\r\n“I _knew_ Ilse’s mother couldn’t have done it,” said Emily triumphantly.\r\n\r\n“We blame ourselves now for our lack of faith,” said Aunt Laura. “We\r\nshould have known too--but it _did_ seem black against her at the time,\r\nEmily. She was a bright, beautiful, merry creature--we thought her\r\nclose friendship with her cousin natural and harmless. We know now it\r\nwas so--but all these years since her disappearance we have believed\r\ndifferently. Mr. James Lee remembers clearly that the well was open\r\nthe night of Beatrice’s disappearance. His hired man had taken the\r\nold rotten planks off it that evening, intending to put the new ones\r\non at once. Then Robert Greerson’s house caught fire and he ran with\r\neverybody else to help save it. By the time it was out it was too dark\r\nto finish with the well, and the man said nothing about it until the\r\nmorning. Mr. Lee was angry with him--he said it was a scandalous thing\r\nto leave a well uncovered like that. He went right down and put the\r\nnew planks in place himself. He did not look down in the well--had he\r\nlooked he could have seen nothing, for the ferns growing out from the\r\nsides screened the depths. It was just after harvest. No one was in\r\nthe field again before the next spring. He never connected Beatrice’s\r\ndisappearance with the open well--he wonders now that he didn’t. But\r\nyou see--dear--there had been much malicious gossip--and Beatrice was\r\n_known_ to have gone on board _The Lady of Winds_. It was taken for\r\ngranted she never came off again. But she did--and went to her death\r\nin the old Lee field. It was a dreadful ending to her bright young\r\nlife--but not so dreadful, after all, as what we believed. For twelve\r\nyears we have wronged the dead. But--Emily--how could you _know_?”\r\n\r\n“I--don’t--know. When the doctor came in that day I couldn’t remember\r\nanything--but now it seems to me that I remember something--just as\r\nif I’d dreamed it--of _seeing_ Ilse’s mother coming over the fields,\r\nsinging. It was dark--and yet I could see the ace of hearts--oh, Aunty,\r\nI don’t know--I don’t like to think of it, some way.”\r\n\r\n“We won’t talk of it again,” said Aunt Laura gently. “It is one of the\r\nthings best not talked of--one of God’s secrets.”\r\n\r\n“And Ilse--does her father love her now?” asked Emily eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Love her! He can’t love her enough. It seems as if he were pouring out\r\non her at once all the shut-up love of those twelve years.”\r\n\r\n“He’ll likely spoil her now as much with indulgence as he did before\r\nwith neglect,” said Elizabeth, coming in with Emily’s supper in time to\r\nhear Laura’s reply.\r\n\r\n“It will take a lot of love to spoil Ilse,” laughed Laura. “She’s\r\ndrinking it up like a thirsty sponge. And she loves him wildly in\r\nreturn. There isn’t a trace of grudge in her over his long neglect.”\r\n\r\n“All the same,” said Elizabeth grimly, tucking pillows behind Emily’s\r\nback with a very gentle hand, oddly in contrast with her severe\r\nexpression, “he won’t get off so easily. Ilse has run wild for twelve\r\nyears. He won’t find it so easy to make her behave properly now--if he\r\never does.”\r\n\r\n“Love will do wonders,” said Aunt Laura softly. “Of course, Ilse is\r\ndying to come and see you, Emily. But she must wait until there is no\r\ndanger of infection. I told her she might write--but when she found I\r\nwould have to read it because of your eyes she said she’d wait till you\r\ncould read it yourself. Evidently”--Laura laughed again--“evidently\r\nIlse has much of importance to tell you.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know anybody could be as happy as I am now,” said Emily.\r\n“And oh, Aunt Elizabeth, it is _so_ nice to feel hungry again and to\r\nhave something to _chew_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nEMILY’S GREAT MOMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nEmily’s convalescence was rather slow. Physically she recovered with\r\nnormal celerity but a certain spiritual and emotional languor persisted\r\nfor a time. One cannot go down to the depths of hidden things and\r\nescape the penalty. Aunt Elizabeth said she “moped.” But Emily was\r\ntoo happy and contented to mope. It was just that life seemed to have\r\nlost its savour for a time, as if some spring of vital energy had been\r\ndrained out of it and refilled slowly.\r\n\r\nShe had, just then, no one to play with. Perry, Ilse and Teddy had\r\nall come down with measles the same day. Mrs. Kent at first declared\r\nbitterly that Teddy had caught them at New Moon, but all three had\r\ncontracted them at a Sunday School picnic where Derry Pond children had\r\nbeen. That picnic infected all Blair Water. There was a perfect orgy of\r\nmeasles. Teddy and Ilse were only moderately ill, but Perry, who had\r\ninsisted on going home to Aunt Tom at the first symptoms, nearly died.\r\nEmily was not allowed to know his danger until it had passed, lest\r\nit worry her too much. Even Aunt Elizabeth worried over it. She was\r\nsurprised to discover how much they missed Perry round the place.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for Emily that Dean Priest was in Blair Water during\r\nthis forlorn time. His companionship was just what she needed and\r\nhelped her wonderfully on the road to complete recovery. They went for\r\nlong walks together all over Blair Water, with Tweed woofing around\r\nthem, and explored places and roads Emily had never seen before. They\r\nwatched a young moon grow old, night by night; they talked in dim\r\nscented chambers of twilight over long red roads of mystery; they\r\nfollowed the lure of hill winds; they saw the stars rise and Dean told\r\nher all about them--the great constellations of the old myths. It\r\nwas a wonderful month; but on the first day of Teddy’s convalescence\r\nEmily was off to the Tansy Patch for the afternoon and Jarback Priest\r\nwalked--if he walked at all--alone.\r\n\r\nAunt Elizabeth was extremely polite to him, though she did not like the\r\nPriests of Priest Pond overmuch, and never felt quite comfortable under\r\nthe mocking gleam of “Jarback’s” green eyes and the faint derision of\r\nhis smile, which seemed to make Murray pride and Murray traditions seem\r\nmuch less important than they really were.\r\n\r\n“He has the Priest flavour,” she told Laura, “though it isn’t as strong\r\nin him as in most of them. And he’s certainly helping Emily--she has\r\nbegun to spunk up since he came.”\r\n\r\nEmily continued to “spunk up” and by September, when the measles\r\nepidemic was spent and Dean Priest had gone on one of his sudden swoops\r\nover to Europe for the autumn, she was ready for school again--a\r\nlittle taller, a little thinner, a little less childlike, with great\r\ngrey shadowy eyes that had looked into death and read the riddle of a\r\nburied thing, and henceforth would hold in them some haunting, elusive\r\nremembrance of that world behind the veil. Dean Priest had seen it--Mr.\r\nCarpenter saw it when she smiled at him across her desk at school.\r\n\r\n“She’s left the childhood of her soul behind, though she is still a\r\nchild in body,” he muttered.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon amid the golden days and hazes of October he asked her\r\ngruffly to let him see some of her verses.\r\n\r\n“I never meant to encourage you in it,” he said. “I don’t mean it\r\nnow. Probably you can’t write a line of real poetry and never will.\r\nBut let me see your stuff. If it’s hopelessly bad I’ll tell you so. I\r\nwon’t have you wasting years striving for the unattainable--at least\r\nI won’t have it on my conscience if you do. If there’s any promise in\r\nit, I’ll tell you so just as honestly. And bring some of your stories,\r\ntoo--_they’re_ trash yet, that’s certain, but I’ll see if they show\r\njust and sufficient cause for going on.”\r\n\r\nEmily spent a very solemn hour that evening, weighing, choosing,\r\nrejecting. To the little bundle of verse she added one of her\r\nJimmy-books which contained, as she thought, her best stories. She went\r\nto school next day, so secret and mysterious that Ilse took offense,\r\nstarted in to call her names--and then stopped. Ilse had promised her\r\nfather that she would try to break herself of the habit of calling\r\nnames. She was making fairly good headway and her conversation, if less\r\nvivid, was beginning to approximate to New Moon standards.\r\n\r\nEmily made a sad mess of her lessons that day. She was nervous and\r\nfrightened. She had a tremendous respect for Mr. Carpenter’s opinion.\r\nFather Cassidy had told her to keep on--Dean Priest had told her that\r\nsome day she might really write--but perhaps they were only trying\r\nto be encouraging because they liked her and didn’t want to hurt her\r\nfeelings. Emily knew Mr. Carpenter would not do this. No matter if he\r\ndid like her he would nip her aspirations mercilessly if he thought\r\nthe root of the matter was not in her. If, on the contrary, he bade\r\nher God-speed, she would rest content with that against the world and\r\nnever lose heart in the face of any future criticism. No wonder the day\r\nseemed fraught with tremendous issues to Emily.\r\n\r\nWhen school was out Mr. Carpenter asked her to remain. She was so\r\nwhite and tense that the other pupils thought she must have been found\r\nout by Mr. Carpenter in some especially dreadful behaviour and knew\r\nshe was going to “catch it.” Rhoda Stuart flung her a significantly\r\nmalicious smile from the porch--which Emily never even saw. She was,\r\nindeed, at a momentous bar, with Mr. Carpenter as supreme judge, and\r\nher whole future career--so she believed--hanging on his verdict.\r\n\r\nThe pupils disappeared and a mellow sunshiny stillness settled over\r\nthe old schoolroom. Mr. Carpenter took the little packet she had given\r\nhim in the morning out of his desk, came down the aisle and sat in the\r\nseat before her, facing her. Very deliberately he settled his glasses\r\nastride his hooked nose, took out her manuscripts and began to read--or\r\nrather to glance over them, flinging scraps of comments, mingled with\r\ngrunts, sniffs and hoots, at her as he glanced. Emily folded her cold\r\nhands on her desk and braced her feet against the legs of it to keep\r\nher knees from trembling. This was a very terrible experience. She\r\nwished she had never given her verses to Mr. Carpenter. They were\r\nno good--of course they were no good. Remember the editor of the\r\n_Enterprise_.\r\n\r\n“Humph!” said Mr. Carpenter. “_Sunset_--Lord, how many poems have been\r\nwritten on ‘Sunset’--\r\n\r\n    ‘The clouds are massed in splendid state\r\n    At heaven’s unbarred western gate\r\n    Where troops of star-eyed spirits wait’--\r\n\r\nBy gad, what does that mean?”\r\n\r\n“I--I--don’t know,” faltered startled Emily, whose wits had been\r\nscattered by the sudden swoop of his spiked glance.\r\n\r\nMr. Carpenter snorted.\r\n\r\n“For heaven’s sake, girl, don’t write what you can’t understand\r\nyourself. And this--_To Life_--‘Life, as thy gift I ask no rainbow\r\njoy’--is that sincere? Is it, girl. Stop and think. _Do_ you ask ‘no\r\nrainbow joy’ of life?”\r\n\r\nHe transfixed her with another glare. But Emily was beginning to pick\r\nherself up a bit. Nevertheless, she suddenly felt oddly ashamed of the\r\nvery elevated and unselfish desires expressed in that sonnet.\r\n\r\n“No--o,” she answered reluctantly. “I _do_ want rainbow joy--lots of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Of course you do. We all do. We don’t get it--you won’t get it--but\r\ndon’t be hypocrite enough to pretend you don’t want it, even in a\r\nsonnet. _Lines to a Mountain Cascade_-- ‘On its dark rocks like the\r\nwhiteness of a veil around a bride’--Where did you see a mountain\r\ncascade in Prince Edward Island?”\r\n\r\n“Nowhere--there’s a picture of one in Dr. Burnley’s library.”\r\n\r\n“_A Wood Stream_--\r\n\r\n    ‘The threading sunbeams quiver,\r\n    The bending bushes shiver,\r\n    O’er the little shadowy river’--\r\n\r\nThere’s only one more rhyme that occurs to me and that’s ‘liver.’ Why\r\ndid you leave it out?”\r\n\r\nEmily writhed.\r\n\r\n“_Wind Song_--\r\n\r\n       ‘I have shaken the dew in the meadows\r\n    From the clover’s creamy gown’--\r\n\r\nPretty, but weak. _June_--June, for heaven’s sake, girl, don’t write\r\npoetry on June. It’s the sickliest subject in the world. It’s been\r\nwritten to death.”\r\n\r\n“No, June is immortal,” cried Emily suddenly, a mutinous sparkle\r\nreplacing the strained look in her eyes. She was not going to let Mr.\r\nCarpenter have it all his own way.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Carpenter had tossed _June_ aside without reading a line of it.\r\n\r\n“‘I weary of the hungry world’--what do you know of the hungry\r\nworld?--you in your New Moon seclusion of old trees and old maids--but\r\nit _is_ hungry. _Ode to Winter_--the seasons are a sort of disease all\r\nyoung poets must have, it seems--ha! ‘Spring will not forget’--_that’s_\r\na good line--the only good line in it. H’m’m--_Wanderings_--\r\n\r\n    ‘I’ve learned the secret of the rune\r\n    That the somber pines on the hillside croon’--\r\n\r\nHave you--_have_ you learned that secret?”\r\n\r\n“I think I’ve always known it,” said Emily dreamily. That flash of\r\nunimaginable sweetness that sometimes surprised her had just come and\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n“_Aim and Endeavour_--too didactic--too didactic. You’ve no right to\r\ntry to teach until you’re old--and then you won’t want to--\r\n\r\n    ‘Her face was like a star all pale and fair’--\r\n\r\nWere you looking in the glass when you composed that line?”\r\n\r\n“No--” indignantly.\r\n\r\n“‘When the morning light is shaken like a banner on the hill’--a good\r\nline--a good line--\r\n\r\n    ‘Oh, on such a golden morning\r\n    To be living is delight’--\r\n\r\nToo much like a faint echo of Wordsworth. _The Sea in September_--‘blue\r\nand austerely bright’--‘austerely bright’--child, how can you marry the\r\nright adjectives like that? _Morning_--‘all the secret fears that haunt\r\nthe night’--what do _you_ know of the fears that haunt the night?”\r\n\r\n“I know something,” said Emily decidedly, remembering her first night\r\nat Wyther Grange.\r\n\r\n“_To a Dead Day_--\r\n\r\n    ‘With the chilly calm on her brow\r\n    That only the dead may wear’--\r\n\r\nHave you ever _seen_ the chilly calm on the brow of the dead, Emily?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Emily softly, recalling that grey dawn in the old house in\r\nthe hollow.\r\n\r\n“I thought so--otherwise you couldn’t have written _that_--and even as\r\nit is--how old are you, jade?”\r\n\r\n“Thirteen, last May.”\r\n\r\n“Humph! _Lines to Mrs. George Irving’s Infant Son_--you should study\r\nthe art of titles, Emily--there’s a fashion in them as in everything\r\nelse. Your titles are as out of date as the candles of New Moon--\r\n\r\n    ‘Soundly he sleeps with his red lips pressed\r\n    Like a beautiful blossom close to her breast’--\r\n\r\nThe rest isn’t worth reading. _September_--is there a month you’ve\r\nmissed?--‘Windy meadows harvest-deep’--good line. _Blair Water by\r\nMoonlight_--gossamer, Emily, nothing but gossamer. _The Garden of New\r\nMoon_--\r\n\r\n    ‘Beguiling laughter and old song\r\n    Of merry maids and men’--\r\n\r\nGood line--I suppose New Moon _is_ full of ghosts. ‘Death’s fell minion\r\nwell fulfilled its part’--that might have passed in Addison’s day but\r\nnot now--not now, Emily--\r\n\r\n    ‘Your azure dimples are the graves\r\n    Where million buried sunbeams play’--\r\n\r\nAtrocious, girl--atrocious. Graves aren’t playgrounds. How much would\r\n_you_ play if you were buried?”\r\n\r\nEmily writhed and blushed again. _Why_ couldn’t she have seen that\r\nherself? _Any_ goose could have seen it.\r\n\r\n    “‘Sail onward, ships--white wings, sail on,\r\n    Till past the horizon’s purple bar\r\n    You drift from sight.--In flush of dawn\r\n    Sail on, and ’neath the evening star’--\r\n\r\nTrash--trash--and yet there’s a picture in it--\r\n\r\n    ‘Lap softly, purple waves. I dream,\r\n    And dreams are sweet--I’ll wake no more’--\r\n\r\nAh, but you’ll have to wake if you want to accomplish anything. Girl,\r\nyou’ve used _purple_ twice in the same poem.\r\n\r\n    ‘Buttercups in a golden frenzy’--\r\n\r\n‘a golden frenzy’--girl, I _see_ the wind shaking the buttercups.\r\n\r\n    ‘From the purple gates of the west I come’--\r\n\r\nYou’re too fond of purple, Emily.”\r\n\r\n“It’s such a lovely word,” said Emily.\r\n\r\n    “‘Dreams that seem too bright to die’--\r\n\r\n_Seem_ but never _are_, Emily--\r\n\r\n    ‘The luring voice of the echo, fame’--\r\n\r\nSo you’ve heard it, too? It _is_ a lure and for most of us only an\r\necho. And that’s the last of the lot.”\r\n\r\nMr. Carpenter swept the little sheets aside, folded his arms on the\r\ndesk, and looked over his glasses at Emily.\r\n\r\nEmily looked back at him mutely, nervelessly. All the life seemed to\r\nhave been drained out of her body and concentrated in her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Ten good lines out of four hundred, Emily--comparatively good, that\r\nis--and all the rest balderdash--balderdash, Emily.”\r\n\r\n“I--suppose so,” said Emily faintly.\r\n\r\nHer eyes brimmed with tears--her lips quivered. She could not help it.\r\nPride was hopelessly submerged in the bitterness of her disappointment.\r\nShe felt exactly like a candle that somebody had blown out.\r\n\r\n“What are you crying for?” demanded Mr. Carpenter.\r\n\r\nEmily blinked away the tears and tried to laugh.\r\n\r\n“I--I’m sorry--you think it’s no good--” she said.\r\n\r\nMr. Carpenter gave the desk a mighty thump.\r\n\r\n“No good! Didn’t I tell you there were ten good lines? Jade, for ten\r\nrighteous men Sodom had been spared.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean--that--after all--” The candle was being relighted again.\r\n\r\n“Of course, I mean. If at thirteen you can write ten good lines, at\r\ntwenty you’ll write ten times ten--if the gods are kind. Stop messing\r\nover months, though--and don’t imagine you’re a genius either, if you\r\n_have_ written ten decent lines. I think there’s _something_ trying to\r\nspeak through you--but you’ll have to make yourself a fit instrument\r\nfor it. You’ve got to work hard and sacrifice--by gad, girl, you’ve\r\nchosen a jealous goddess. And she never lets her votaries go--not even\r\nwhen she shuts her ears forever to their plea. What have you there?”\r\n\r\nEmily, her heart thrilling, handed him her Jimmy-book. She was so happy\r\nthat it shone through her whole being with a positive radiance. She\r\nsaw her future, wonderful, brilliant--oh, her goddess would listen to\r\n_her_--“Emily B. Starr, the distinguished poet”--“E. Byrd Starr, the\r\nrising young novelist”--\r\n\r\nShe was recalled from her enchanting reverie by a chuckle from Mr.\r\nCarpenter. Emily wondered a little uneasily what he was laughing at.\r\nShe didn’t think there was anything funny in _that_ book. It contained\r\nonly three or four of her latest stories--_The Butterfly Queen_, a\r\nlittle fairy tale; _The Disappointed House_, wherein she had woven a\r\npretty dream of hopes come true after long years; _The Secret of the\r\nGlen_, which, in spite of its title, was a fanciful little dialogue\r\nbetween the Spirit of the Snow, the Spirit of the Grey Rain, the\r\nSpirit of Mist, and the Spirit of Moonshine.\r\n\r\n“So you think I am not beautiful when I say my prayers?” said Mr.\r\nCarpenter.\r\n\r\nEmily gasped--realized what had happened--made a frantic grab at her\r\nJimmy-book--missed it. Mr. Carpenter held it up beyond her reach and\r\nmocked at her.\r\n\r\nShe had given him the wrong Jimmy-book! And this one, oh, horrors,\r\nwhat was in it? Or rather, what wasn’t in it? Sketches of everyone in\r\nBlair Water--and a full--a very full--description of Mr. Carpenter\r\nhimself. Intent on describing him exactly, she had been as mercilessly\r\nlucid as she always was, especially in regard to the odd faces he\r\nmade on mornings when he opened the school day with a prayer. Thanks\r\nto her dramatic knack of word painting, Mr. Carpenter _lived_ in that\r\nsketch. Emily did not know it, but _he_ did--he saw himself as in a\r\nglass and the artistry of it pleased him so that he cared for nothing\r\nelse. Besides, she had drawn his good points quite as clearly as his\r\nbad ones. And there were some sentences in it--“He looks as if he knew\r\na great deal that can never be any use to him”--“I think he wears the\r\nblack coat Mondays because it makes him feel that he hasn’t been drunk\r\nat all.” Who or what had taught the little jade these things? Oh, her\r\ngoddess would not pass Emily by!\r\n\r\n“I’m--sorry,” said Emily, crimson with shame all over her dainty\r\npaleness.\r\n\r\n“Why, I wouldn’t have missed this for all the poetry you’ve written or\r\never will write! By gad, it’s literature--_literature_--and you’re only\r\nthirteen. But you don’t know what’s ahead of you--the stony hills--the\r\nsteep ascents--the buffets--the discouragements. Stay in the valley if\r\nyou’re wise. Emily, _why_ do you want to write? Give me your reason.”\r\n\r\n“I want to be famous and rich,” said Emily coolly.\r\n\r\n“Everybody does. Is that all?”\r\n\r\n“No. I just _love_ to write.”\r\n\r\n“A better reason--but not enough--not enough. Tell me this--if you knew\r\nyou would be poor as a church mouse all your life--if you knew you’d\r\nnever have a line published--would you still go on writing--_would_\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I would,” said Emily disdainfully. “Why, I _have_ to\r\nwrite--I can’t help it by times--I’ve just _got_ to.”\r\n\r\n“Oh--then I’d waste my breath giving advice at all. If it’s _in_ you\r\nto climb you must--there are those who _must_ lift their eyes to the\r\nhills--they can’t breathe properly in the valleys. God help them if\r\nthere’s some weakness in them that prevents their climbing. You don’t\r\nunderstand a word I’m saying--yet. But go on--climb! There, take\r\nyour book and go home. Thirty years from now I will have a claim to\r\ndistinction in the fact that Emily Byrd Starr was once a pupil of mine.\r\nGo--go--before I remember what a disrespectful baggage you are to write\r\nsuch stuff about me and be properly enraged.”\r\n\r\nEmily went, still a bit scared but oddly exultant behind her fright.\r\nShe was so happy that her happiness seemed to irradiate the world with\r\nits own splendour. All the sweet sounds of nature around her seemed\r\nlike the broken words of her own delight. Mr. Carpenter watched her out\r\nof sight from the old worn threshold.\r\n\r\n“Wind--and flame--and sea!” he muttered. “Nature is always taking us\r\nby surprise. This child has--what I have never had and would have made\r\nany sacrifice to have. But ‘the gods don’t allow us to be in their\r\ndebt’--she will pay for it--she will pay.”\r\n\r\nAt sunset Emily sat in the lookout room. It was flooded with soft\r\nsplendour. Outside, in sky and trees, were delicate tintings and\r\naerial sounds. Down in the garden Daffy was chasing dead leaves along\r\nthe red walks. The sight of his sleek, striped sides, the grace of\r\nhis movements, gave her pleasure--as did the beautiful, even, glossy\r\nfurrows of the ploughed fields beyond the lane, and the first faint\r\nwhite star in the crystal-green sky.\r\n\r\nThe wind of the autumn night was blowing trumpets of fairyland on the\r\nhills; and over in Lofty John’s bush was laughter--like the laughter of\r\nfauns. Ilse and Perry and Teddy were waiting there for her--they had\r\nmade a tryst for a twilight romp. She would go to them--presently--not\r\nyet. She was so full of rapture that she must write it out before she\r\nwent back from her world of dreams to the world of reality. Once she\r\nwould have poured it into a letter to her father. She could no longer\r\ndo that. But on the table before her lay a brand-new Jimmy-book. She\r\npulled it towards her, took up her pen, and on its first virgin page\r\nshe wrote.\r\n\r\n                                  NEW MOON,\r\n                                    BLAIR WATER,\r\n                                       P. E. ISLAND.\r\n                                   October 8th.\r\n\r\nI am going to write a diary, that it may be published when I die.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Note:\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to standardise punctuation according to the\r\nstyle used in the original book.
