The sack of Rome inflicted a\r\ndire retribution for the restless shuffling that had disgraced the\r\ntemporal policy of recent pontiffs; it was the crowning mischief to a\r\nlong agony of ultramontane aggression; and in it was spent one of the\r\nlast mighty waves of barbarian aggression that broke upon the Italian\r\nPeninsula.\r\n\r\nSuch are the difficulties in the way of a just and satisfactory\r\njudgment as to the causes which led to this outrage, that it may\r\nbe well to review these, even at the risk of some recapitulation.\r\nThe total demoralisation of Bourbon's army, the want of good\r\nunderstanding between him and other imperial leaders in Italy, the\r\nabsence of zeal or common interests among the confederate powers\r\nand their officials, with the prevailing bad faith of all parties,\r\nform a combination of elements baffling to the historian as it must\r\nhave been to the actors themselves. The petty motives and feeble\r\nmeasures of the Pontiff have already been amply exposed. Francis and\r\nthe Venetians had originally entered the strife only from selfish\r\nviews upon Lombardy, which they pursued without attempting any\r\ncomprehensive or efficient operations, and, as soon as the storm had\r\npassed by them, their languor became indifference. Charles cared\r\nlittle for Italy, or the ill-defined claims of the Empire upon it,\r\nexcept as a fair field for aggrandising or securing, by intrigue or\r\nby arms, his already exorbitant dominions, and he left his officers\r\nthere pretty much to their own discretion in the maintenance of his\r\ninterests. His successive viceroys at Naples, perceiving the policy\r\nof Clement to be inherently adverse to their master's interests,\r\nwere ever ready to annoy his frontier, or to cajole him away from\r\nthe Lombard league. The Constable, finding that the cautious tactics\r\nof the Duke of Urbino kept his own movements in check, and impeded\r\nhis appeasing with pillage a reckless host whom he could not pay,\r\nwas ready to adopt any enterprise that might ensure occupation and\r\nplunder to his dangerous bands, not doubting that, whoever might\r\nsuffer, success would justify him with the Emperor, to whose glory it\r\nmust ultimately redound.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Pope had ratified the truce of the 15th March, he,\r\nwith an infatuation which even an empty treasury can ill excuse,\r\ndismissed two thousand of the _bande nere_ who garrisoned Rome.\r\nA Swiss corps withdrew at the same time, on his refusal of their\r\nmonthly pay in advance. When the imperialists drew southward, his\r\nchief care was for Florence, and, on hearing of the insurrection\r\nthere, he sent one of his chamberlains to acknowledge Francesco\r\nMaria's good service, adding a vague hope that, in the event of\r\nBourbon threatening Rome, he would contribute counsel and aid for\r\nits safety. In reply, the Duke recommended that Viterbo, and\r\nMontefiascone should be secured, and Rome suitably defended by Renzo\r\nda Ceri and Orazio Baglioni, suggesting that his Holiness might\r\nbetake himself to the strongholds of Orvieto or Civita Castellana:\r\nwith these precautions, he added that an early and innocuous\r\nconclusion of the inroad would ensue, as the enemy, when shut out\r\nfrom plunder of the towns, must quickly disperse. But these counsels\r\ncame too late, and, with a foolhardiness and folly savouring\r\nof judicial blindness, the Pontiff remained in the comfortable\r\nconviction that Bourbon would take up his quarters at Siena, on the\r\nrepresentations of Lannoy.[*1] It was only about the 25th that his\r\nimpending danger first dawned upon him. Rome had then, of regular\r\ntroops, but two hundred foot and a few light cavalry, besides the\r\nSwiss guard, and the only officer of rank was Renzo da Ceri, whose\r\npersonal courage and military capacity were in equal disrepute, and\r\nof whom Clement had on various occasions spoken with contempt. Yet\r\nupon this broken reed did he place his sole reliance for the defence\r\nof his capital. He commanded the weak points of the walls to be\r\nrepaired and strictly guarded, distributing the artillery where most\r\nrequired. He pressed above three thousand men into his service; but\r\nthese hasty levies were of the most useless description, composed\r\nof artizans, servants, and the scum of the population, \"more used\r\nto handle kitchen spits and stable forks than military weapons.\"\r\nResorting to fanatical expedients, he proclaimed a plenary remission\r\nof their sins to such as should fall in the sacred struggle. But\r\nthe greatest difficulty was to raise money for these purposes: the\r\nwealthy classes were so absorbed in egotism and luxury, so deluded\r\nby false security, that they would contribute nothing. Domenico de'\r\nMassini, one of the richest of them, would lend but a hundred ducats,\r\na refusal for which he and his family paid bitterly in the sack. On\r\nthe 11th of April, Girolamo Negri, a shrewd observer, wrote that the\r\npapal court had become a barn-yard of chickens, and that, though each\r\nday gave more manifest signs of evil times, every one relied on the\r\nViceroy's mediation, failing which all would be lost.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *1: The army would not hear of a truce. Bourbon, really\r\nat their mercy, as he knew before he crossed the Apennines, asked\r\nthem what they wished to do. \"To march on,\" replied the Spaniards,\r\n\"even without pay.\" The Germans after a time, though hungry for their\r\nwage, made common cause with them. \"To march on,\" became almost a\r\nwar-cry, and Bourbon was compelled to consent. He sent word to the\r\nPope before he got into Val d'Arno that his men \"were determined to\r\npush on, not only to Florence but to Rome, and dragged him with them\r\nas a prisoner.\" He asked for 150,000 ducats by April 15th to pay them\r\nwith, that he might lead them back. The Pope, however, who had no\r\nfaith in his power or honesty, sent nothing, trusting in Lannoy and\r\nthat broken reed the Duke of Urbino.]\r\n\r\nAt this juncture there appeared in Rome one of those strange\r\nfanatics whose mysterious aspect and unearthly character, taking\r\nstrong hold of the popular imagination at particular crises, impart\r\na supernatural character to their wild and dismal vaticinations.\r\nHe was an aged anchorite, who, fancying himself another Jonah, had\r\nlong attracted street audiences by vague declamations of coming\r\nconvulsions, and, as the peril became imminent, warned the anxious\r\npeople that a total revolution in church and state, and the ruin of\r\nthe priesthood, were at hand. Rushing along the thoroughfares, he\r\npreached, with piercing voice and excited gesticulation, a general\r\npenitence and humble reliance on the offended Deity, as the only\r\nshelter from the impending storm. He even forced his way to the\r\npresence of his Holiness, and, in the midst of the court, repeated\r\ngloomy warnings and stern denunciations in harsh words seldom\r\nheard in such high places. \"But,\" in the words of an old writer,\r\n\"repentance is an irksome sound to the ears of hardened sinners,\"\r\nand \"more is required to make a saint than sackcloth raiment, a\r\ncrucifix, and philippics against vice\"; so the prophet was committed\r\nto prison, to continue his preaching to a more limited audience.\r\nYet it needed no stretch of superstition to regard the sack of\r\nRome, with its accumulated horrors, as a Divine judgment. The gross\r\nvices which disgraced the papacy towards the close of the preceding\r\ncentury had, indeed, been considerably modified; but, as the\r\nreformation was rather in decency than in morals, it had not greatly\r\ninfluenced the people of Rome: the poison, though counteracted at\r\nthe core, continued to circulate through the branches. In truth, the\r\nhearts of all were so indurated, and their judgment so blinded by\r\npleasures, debaucheries, avarice, and ambition, that the forebodings\r\nof enthusiasts, and the many portentous omens of evil that occurred\r\nabout the same time, were equally disregarded. Among these were,\r\nof course, blood-red suns and fiery meteors; but it was afterwards\r\nremembered that two aged men with long beards had been observed to\r\nstride solemnly along the chief thoroughfares of the city, bearing a\r\nlarge empty bag, and exclaiming at intervals with dolorous solemnity,\r\n\"Behold the sack!\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The play of words applies equally in Italian and\r\nEnglish, and the incident savours much of a carnival jest. A scarce\r\nlittle book of prophecies, dated 1532, has for _Envoye_ a sonnet,\r\nforeshadowing the woes of Italy in consequence of--\r\n\r\n     \"L'infando error de Sogdoma e Gomora,\r\n     Le profanate sacre binde e tempi,\r\n     L'occider Dio mille volte al hora.\"]\r\n\r\nThe measures of the government, superficial as they were, generated\r\nfalse security; and a general muster of the citizens which returned\r\nthirty thousand as capable of bearing arms, tended to confirm the\r\nfatal delusion. The Pope gave currency to it by setting forth on all\r\noccasions the reduced state of the imperialist army, the proximity\r\nof that of the league, and above all insisted that the invaders,\r\nbeing for the most part Lutherans, were no doubt conducted by\r\nProvidence, to undergo a signal punishment for their heresies under\r\nthe very walls of the Christian metropolis. To such a height was this\r\nfoolhardiness carried, that the messenger, who arrived on the 3rd of\r\nMay to demand free passage to Naples, was dismissed by Renzo with\r\nthe threat of a cannon-ball at his head; and on the following day the\r\nDatary wrote to Count Guido Rangone, that a reinforcement of six or\r\neight hundred men would suffice for defence of the city. But ere the\r\nmessenger was well clear of the gate, the enemy were before it.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: It is difficult to reconcile the varying accounts of the\r\nsack, for which, besides the many printed authorities, we have drawn\r\nlargely upon a collection of unpublished and very minute details,\r\nVat. Urb. MSS. No. 1677. It is doubtful whether Bourbon arrived on\r\nthe evening of the 4th or of the 5th of May, but the assault was\r\nunquestionably made upon Monday the 6th. Many of the incidents given\r\nin that MS. are too horrible for admission into these pages. The\r\nnarratives of Guicciardini and Giacomo Buonaparte, and those printed\r\nin the second volume of Eccardius, may be consulted for such; the\r\ntwo first, indeed, have done little beyond arranging some documents\r\nof that MS. collection. We have also consulted the Narrative of\r\nLeonardo Santori, Vat. Ottob. MSS. No. 2607, and Sanuto's MS.\r\nDiaries; checking the whole by minute examination of the localities.\r\n*On the 3rd May Bourbon had passed Viterbo, on the 4th he was at\r\nIsola Farnese. As to the number of men which Renzo da Ceri had at\r\ncommand, 3000 seems nearer the truth than 30,000. Bourbon had scaling\r\nladders but no artillery. Cf. GUICCIARDINI, _Il Sacco di\r\nRoma_, Milanesi, p. 163, and CASANOVA, _Lettere di Carlo V.\r\na Clement VII._ (per nozze Firenze, 1894).]\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants, at length aroused to their danger by the presence\r\nof an army whom they supposed at Siena, were thrown into general\r\npanic, though some were so blinded as to suppose it the advanced\r\nguard of the confederates. Even now, bold and judicious expedients\r\nmight have defended the walls until the arrival of the allies, whose\r\nfirst division actually reached the Porta Salara the same day on\r\nwhich the city was taken; and had the bridges been previously cut,\r\nas was urged upon Renzo in consideration of the weak defences of the\r\nBorgo S. Spirito, the principal portion of the city might have held\r\nout, even after these had been carried, whilst the Duke of Urbino\r\nwould have had leisure to execute signal vengeance upon the ruffian\r\ninvaders, demoralised by their leader's fall and by the pillage of\r\nits Transteverin quarters.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means easy to form an idea of the actual force of the\r\ninvading army from the varying estimates that have come down to us.\r\nMuratori, who bestowed much attention upon such military statistics,\r\nreckons the troops whom Bourbon carried from Milan at about five\r\nthousand Spaniards, four thousand Germans, and half as many Italians,\r\nbesides five hundred men-at-arms, two thousand German cavalry,\r\nand an indefinite number of light horse, to whom were soon united\r\nthe lansquenets of Fründesberg, originally fourteen thousand, but\r\nalready somewhat reduced. This would give a total of twenty-six or\r\ntwenty-seven thousand men, which exceeds by a few thousand infantry\r\nthe calculation adopted by Giacomo Buonaparte, his multiplication\r\nof the men-at-arms by ten being obviously an accidental error. The\r\nsame author supposes that the Imperialists who had marched from\r\nMontevarchi were about twenty thousand Germans, eight thousand\r\nSpaniards, three thousand Italians, with but six hundred horse.\r\nThe impression current at Rome, and in the confederate camp, that\r\nBourbon brought from forty to fifty thousand men before that city\r\nwas therefore grossly exaggerated; indeed, some authorities diminish\r\nhis effective force to half that number, while Buonaparte esteems\r\nit under thirty thousand. The allied army, according to Baldi, was\r\ntwenty thousand strong, of whom one fifth were cavalry: but it, too,\r\nhad melted away when mustered at Isola, as we shall in due time see.\r\nOn the whole, it appears that the inequality of numbers was not such\r\nas to justify the Fabian tactics, or it may be the petted policy, of\r\nFrancesco Maria.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 5th of May, the Constable bivouacked in the meadows\r\nnorth-west of the city, having approached it without crossing the\r\nTiber. He repeated by trumpet his summons in name of the Emperor for\r\nfree passage to Naples; an idle insult, considering that the way\r\nbeneath the walls lay open for him. He then explained to a council\r\nof his officers the perilous state of affairs,--the troops fatigued,\r\nstarving, mutinous, with a powerful enemy pressing upon their rear,\r\nand the richest metropolis of Europe ill-defended before them,\r\nurging that there was no alternative but that night to conquer its\r\neffeminate citizens, or next day be cut to pieces by the allied host.\r\nBut, finding these representations received with cold indifference,\r\nhe at dusk repeated them to the whole army in an energetic harangue,\r\nwhich he concluded by assuring them he had received, through Cardinal\r\nColonna, assurances of support from the Ghibelline party within the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nEre the morrow's dawn his army was in motion, and, under cover of a\r\nsingularly dense fog, approached the city between the modern gates\r\nof Cavallegieri and S. Pancrazio. The wall was there pierced by a\r\nloop-hole, serving as the window of a small and slightly built house\r\nthat formed part of the defences; below it was another aperture into\r\nthe cellar. These vulnerable points, which had been unpardonably\r\noverlooked by the papal engineers, were quickly noticed by the\r\nenemy, who brought the few guns they possessed to bear upon them,\r\nand soon effected a small breach. The exact site is loosely and\r\ncontradictorily described as between one of the gates and the tower\r\nof S. Spirito, near Cardinal Mellini's, or Ermellini's, garden.\r\nMeanwhile the besiegers, protected by the mist from the guns of S.\r\nAngelo, vigorously attacked various points; and on the heights above\r\nthe Strada Giulia, two Spanish colours were wrested from them. The\r\nwalls and substructions now visible on that side, and those which\r\nseparate the Lungara from the Borgo S. Spirito, are all of later\r\ndate; and in constructing them, sixteen years subsequently, the\r\naspect of the localities has been so changed as to baffle accurate\r\ncomparison with descriptions of the assault. If we can suppose the\r\nexternal wall to have run from near the Porta S. Spirito towards\r\nthat of S. Pancrazio, instead of being carried, as at present,\r\nalong the Janicular ridge from the Porta Cavallegieri, it might be\r\ncomparatively easy to reconcile these statements. At all events, it\r\nis certain that considerable resistance was made by some citizens\r\nwho occupied the _Campo Santo_ or burying ground, which then lay\r\njust outside of the gate from S. Spirito into the Lungara, and\r\nwhich, according to a mural inscription there, was removed in 1749\r\nto its present site farther up the hill. This, being the brunt of\r\nthe battle, was occupied by Bourbon, whose exertions throughout the\r\nmorning had been unremitting. Whilst steadying a ladder with his\r\nleft hand, and cheering on his men with his right, he was struck to\r\nthe ground by a bullet which passed through his thigh. The credit\r\nof that lucky shot, which cut short a career commenced in treason,\r\nclosed in sacrilege, is claimed by Benvenuto Cellini. He tells us\r\nthat on hieing to the Campo Santo with two comrades, he beheld from\r\nthe walls the enemy assaulting the spot where they stood; whereupon\r\nthey discharged their pieces in terror, he aiming at a figure\r\nsingled out in the mist from its commanding height. Having mustered\r\ncourage to peep over the wall, he saw a great confusion occasioned\r\nby the Constable's fall, and, fleeing with his friends through the\r\ncemetery, escaped by St. Peter's to the castle of S. Angelo.[*4]\r\nThis assertion, which has generally passed for gasconade, receives\r\nsupport from the Vatican MS., wherein the shot is ascribed to some\r\nsilversmith lads who, from the Mount of the Holy Crucifix, aimed at\r\nthe general's white mantle and plume; and a monumental tablet outside\r\nthe Church of S. Spirito commemorates Bernardino Passeri, goldsmith\r\nand jeweller to Clement and his two predecessors, who was killed on\r\nthe 6th of May, on the adjoining part of the Janicular, after slaying\r\nmany of the enemy, and capturing a standard. About five hundred paces\r\nto the west of that reach of the modern city wall which commands the\r\nCavallegieri gate, there stands on the road to the Fornaci a small\r\noratory, called the Capella di Barbone, and pointed out by tradition\r\nas the spot where Bourbon was wounded. No account, however, which I\r\nhave seen, countenances the idea of his having fallen so far away;\r\nnor is it possible, even when no mist intervenes, to see either that\r\npoint, or the site of the present exterior city wall, from the old\r\ncemetery of S. Spirito, whence the fatal shot appears to have been\r\naimed. But from whatever spot or hand it proceeded, the wound was\r\nmortal, and the Constable died in his thirty-ninth year, ere he could\r\nwitness the desecration or share the booty to which he had stimulated\r\nhis followers. Yet had God's just judgment on the traitor been\r\nwithheld for a time, his influence might, perhaps, have stayed the\r\nfury of the soldiery, and Rome might have been spared some portion of\r\nthe misery that ensued. His body was carried to Gaeta, and his armour\r\nis still shown at the Vatican, a plain coat of immense strength. It,\r\nhowever, bears an indentation on the inner side of the right thigh,\r\nwhere the fatal bullet entered after grazing its steel edge.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *4: Cf. _The Life of Benvenuto Cellini_, trans. by J.A.\r\nSymonds (Nimmo, 1896), p. 656.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: In a set of miniatures executed by Giulio Clovio for\r\nCharles V., and illustrative of his military achievement, which were\r\nbequeathed by the Right Hon. Thomas Granville to the British Museum\r\nin 1847, Bourbon is represented falling backwards from a ladder\r\nplaced against a round tower on the walls of Rome; but being composed\r\nwithout accurate knowledge of the localities, it throws no light upon\r\nthe manner of his death.]\r\n\r\nFor a moment his troops wavered, dismayed by their leader's fall;\r\nbut revenge and a consciousness of their perilous position rendered\r\nthem desperate. The assertion of Mambrino Roseo, that the Swiss guard\r\ndisputed every inch of the breach until only a drummer was left\r\nalive, wants confirmation from those narratives of eye-witnesses\r\nwhich I have examined. Be this as it may, it was about half-past\r\neight that the first detachment, who had made their way into the\r\nBorgo, were observed by Renzo da Ceri. Instead of cutting them down\r\nwith the body of horse who followed him, he in a loud voice gave the\r\n_sauve qui peut_, and, galloping round by the Ponte Sisto, reached\r\nthat of S. Angelo, where he recklessly crushed and trod down the\r\ncitizens, already rushing across it in masses to the castle.[*6] Had\r\nthis craven caitiff rallied his men to the breach, it might have been\r\nrepaired; and had he but held the Porta Settimiana, or even now cut\r\nthe lower bridges, the invaders would have been confined within a\r\nsmall district of the city, until Guido Rangone arrived with succours.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *6: Creighton justly remarks that this was not in keeping\r\nwith Renzo da Ceri's character. The tale is from Guicciardini. Renzo\r\nda Ceri was certainly no \"craven caitiff.\"]\r\n\r\nThe panic thus originated by the city's defender spread rapidly\r\nin all quarters. The Pontiff, who, from his chair in S. Peter's,\r\nhad been thundering spiritual menaces against the foe, was hurried\r\nalong the covered passage to S. Angelo, whither also flocked the\r\ncardinals, clergy, and citizens of all ranks, in such crowds that it\r\nwas found impossible to close the gates. At length the portcullis\r\nwas dropped, with great difficulty from its rusty condition, and\r\nseveral cardinals, who had been excluded, were afterwards drawn up\r\nin baskets. The terrified crowd who were thus shut out, rushed to\r\nescape by the city gates, but, finding these closed, they dispersed\r\nthemselves among the palaces of the Ghibelline cardinals, upon which\r\nthey vainly relied as sure asylums.\r\n\r\nAbout three thousand got into the castle, with fourteen cardinals.\r\nIt was very ill supplied with provisions, and the neighbouring\r\nshops were hurriedly emptied of whatever stores they contained. The\r\nPontiff, in his alarm, would have attempted flight, but Bourbon's\r\ndeath inspired him with some hope of making terms. In fact, the\r\nbesiegers, who had at first rushed in with cries of \"Hurrah for\r\nSpain! slay! slay!\" soon paused, discouraged by the loss of their\r\nleader, and anticipating a desperate resistance. In this state of\r\nmatters, the Portuguese ambassador was authorised by his Holiness\r\nto propose an accommodation to the imperialist chiefs, who, finding\r\nthemselves in possession of but a fraction of the city, with walls\r\nand gates on either side excluding them from the S. Spirito and\r\nTrastevere quarters, temporised for some hours. But as the bulk of\r\ntheir army entered at S. Pancrazio, and they ascertained the panic in\r\nthe town, their misgivings passed away, and about two hours before\r\nsunset they suddenly advanced through the Porta Settimiana, in Via\r\nLungara. Encouraged by its defenceless state, they pushed across the\r\nPonte Sisto, which they found equally unguarded, and spread like a\r\ndeluge over the devoted city.\r\n\r\nNow began the horrors of the sack. The brutal soldiery, absolved\r\nfrom discipline, scoured the city at will, penetrating unchallenged\r\ninto the most secret and most sacred places.[*7] Churches and\r\nconvents, palaces and houses, were invaded and rifled; resistance was\r\npunished with fire and sword; rape and murder were the fate of the\r\ninhabitants. Passing over details too revolting for the imagination\r\nto supply, but too repulsive for a place in these pages, we may\r\ncite the feeling exclamations of one who seems to have witnessed\r\nthem:--\"Alas! how many courtiers, gentlemen, and prelates, how many\r\ndevout nuns, matrons, and maidens became a prey to these savages!\r\nWhat chalices, images, crucifixes, vessels of silver and gold,\r\nwere torn from the altars by these sacrilegious hands! What holy\r\nrelics were dashed to the ground with derisive blasphemy by these\r\nbrutal Lutherans! The heads of Saints Peter, Paul, Andrew, and of\r\nmany others, the wood of the sacred Cross, the blessed oil, and\r\nthe sacramental wafers, were ruthlessly trodden upon. The streets\r\nexhibited heaps of rich furniture, vestments, and plate, all the\r\nwealth and splendour of the Roman court, pillaged by the basest\r\nruffians.\"[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *7: They were of many nationalities--Germans, Spaniards,\r\nItalians--\"a horde of 40,000 ruffians free from all restraint.\" They\r\ngratified their elemental passions and lusts at the expense of the\r\nmost cultivated population in the world. The Germans were the worst:\r\n\"the Lutherans amongst them setting an example which was quickly\r\nfollowed of disregard of holy places.\" The Spaniards, however,\r\nexcelled them in deliberate cruelty. For three days this barbarism\r\nwent on unchecked. On the fourth the barbarians began to quarrel\r\namongst themselves over the division of the booty. \"The Germans ...\r\nturned to drunkenness and buffoonery. Clad in magnificent vestments\r\nand decked with jewels, accompanied by concubines who were bedizened\r\nwith like ornaments, they rode on mules through the streets and\r\nimitated with drunken gravity the processions of the Papal Court.\"\r\nCf. CREIGHTON, _op. cit._, vol. VI., pp. 342-3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 1677, f. 19.]\r\n\r\nAfter these miserable scenes had endured for three days, rumours of\r\nthe Duke of Urbino's approach recalled the imperialist leaders to the\r\nnecessity of defence.[*9] The command having devolved upon the Prince\r\nof Orange, a yellow-haired barbarian, further plunder was prohibited,\r\nunder severe penalties; and the army, reduced to comparative\r\norder, betook themselves to enjoy their booty. But now a new drama\r\nof atrocities opened. The Germans had especially distinguished\r\nthemselves by a thirst for blood, but the wily Spaniards taught\r\nthem a means more effectual than murder of enriching themselves and\r\npunishing their victims. The prisoners had, in most cases, concealed\r\nwhatever of greatest value they possessed, and recourse was had to\r\nevery variety of torment in order to extract from them supposed\r\ntreasures, and a ransom for their lives; so that those who had been\r\nspared in seeming mercy found themselves but reserved for a worse\r\nfate. After stripes and blows had been exhausted, when hunger and\r\nthirst had failed to force compliance, tortures the most brutal\r\nsucceeded. Some were suspended naked from their own windows by a\r\nsensitive limb, or swung head downwards, and momentarily threatened\r\nto be let drop into the street. Others had their teeth drawn slowly\r\nand singly, or were compelled to swallow their own mutilated and\r\nroasted members. Others were forced to perform the most odious\r\nand menial services; and the greatest extremities were always used\r\ntowards those who were suspected of being the most wealthy and noble.\r\nEven after the desired amount of gold had been thus extorted from\r\nthem, their sufferings were sometimes resumed at the instance of new\r\ntormentors. When such cruelties palled, their inflictors had recourse\r\nto a novel amusement, by forcing from the victims a confession of\r\ntheir sins; and we are assured by the narrator of these enormities,\r\nhimself a Roman, that the iniquities thus brought to light, as\r\nhabitual in that dissolute capital, were such as to confound even the\r\nlicentious soldiery of Bourbon. Over the outrages committed upon the\r\nwomen we draw a veil: when lust was satiated, they were prolonged\r\nin diabolical punishment, the husbands and fathers being compulsory\r\nwitnesses to such unspeakable atrocities.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *9: The Duke was very slow as usual. There was plenty of\r\ntime for him to receive imploring letters. A career, which was a\r\nfailure brought about by dilatoriness and treason, here seems to have\r\nreached its lowest point. As always, Dennistoun is too favourable in\r\nhis judgment of anyone belonging to the Rovere house.]\r\n\r\nBut the delight of these sacrilegious villains, especially of the\r\nGerman Lutherans, was to outrage everything holy. The churches and\r\nchapels, including the now bloodstained St. Peter's, were desecrated\r\ninto stables, taverns, or brothels; and the choirs, whence no sounds\r\nhad breathed but the elevating chant of prayer and praise, rang with\r\nbase ribaldry and blasphemous imprecations. The grand creations of\r\nreligious art were wantonly insulted or damaged; the reliquaries and\r\nmiraculous images were pillaged or defaced. Nay, a poor priest was\r\ninhumanly murdered for his firm refusal to administer the blessed\r\nsacrament to an ass. Nor was any respect paid to persons or party\r\nfeelings. The subjects of the Emperor who happened to be in Rome,\r\nthe adherents of the Colonna and other Ghibelline leaders, were all\r\ninvolved in the general fate. Four cardinals attached to that faction\r\nhad declined entering S. Angelo, calculating that they would not only\r\n\r\n     \"Guide the whirlwind and direct the storm,\"\r\n\r\nbut peradventure, promote their own interests in the mêlée. They\r\nwere, however, miserably mistaken, for they, too, were held to\r\nransom; and one of them (Aracoeli), after being often led through the\r\nstreets tied on a donkey, behind a common soldier, was carried to\r\nchurch with mock funereal rites, when the office of the dead was read\r\nover his living body, and an oration pronounced, wherein, for eulogy,\r\nwere loathsomely related all the real or alleged immoralities of his\r\npast life. Another outrage in especial repute with the Germans, was a\r\nribald procession, in which some low buffoon in sacred vestments was\r\nborne shoulder-high, scattering mock benedictions among the mob, amid\r\nshouts of \"Long live Luther!\"\r\n\r\nA great portion of the circulating wealth of the city was centred in\r\nthe Strada de' Banchi, which, from being in a line with the castle\r\nand just across the river, was considered comparatively secure. But\r\nthis fallacious hope quickly vanished, and during five hours that\r\nquarter of bankers, merchants, and jewellers was savagely sacked\r\nin sight of the papal court. In one of these shops a large money\r\nbag being discovered, a general scramble ensued for its contents,\r\nand forty-two of the soldiery lost their lives at their comrades'\r\nhands, fighting for what proved to be counterfeit coin. The Jews,\r\nwho were not then enclosed in the Ghetto, suffered a full share of\r\nsuch miseries, to make them disgorge their secret treasures. Vast\r\nmultitudes of citizens took refuge in the palaces of the cardinals\r\nand principal nobility, especially of those supposed to be friendly\r\nto the imperial interests; but these asylums were seldom respected.\r\nThat of the Cancelleria, originally built by Cardinal Pietro Riario,\r\nand still one of the most spacious in the capital, was long spared;\r\nbut on the 20th of May its turn came; and as it was the last to\r\nbe pillaged, the outrages perpetrated upon its miserable inmates,\r\nincluding numerous ecclesiastical and diplomatic dignitaries, with\r\na crowd of the high-born beauties of Rome, were perhaps the most\r\nsignal and sanguinary of all. In other palaces the fugitives, though\r\nspared from violence, were held to ransom. The Dowager Marchioness\r\nof Mantua purchased immunity for her residence with 10,000 ducats,\r\nwhich the merchants whom it sheltered joined in paying, and which\r\nher son Ferdinando, one of the imperial leaders, was said to have\r\nbasely shared. In the Vatican MS. is a backbond, signed by about five\r\nhundred persons, who had sought refuge in the palace of Cardinal\r\nAndrea della Valle, obliging themselves to repay, in sums varying\r\nfrom 10 to 4000 scudi each, the ransom of 40,000 ducats which he had\r\nadvanced. Among the names is the King of Cyprus, and, what may have\r\nmore interest for us, that of Peter Hustan from Scotland. The English\r\nCardinal of St. Cecilia, Thomas Usher, Archbishop of York, was one of\r\nthose who escaped into the castle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut where, meanwhile, was the army of the League?[*10] The Duke of\r\nUrbino, after quelling the insurrection at Florence, had lingered\r\nthere for some days at the instance of the Cardinal Legate, who\r\nrepresented to him that Rome was amply provided with means of\r\ndefence. Yet, upon learning Bourbon's advance, the confederates\r\ndespatched Guido Rangone from Incisa, where their army lay, to\r\nanticipate by forced marches his arrival at that capital. Taking\r\nfive thousand light infantry of the _bande nere_, with a large force\r\nof cavalry, he pushed on, and at Otricoli met the Datary's foolish\r\nmissive of the 4th of May, which, declining further relief, asked for\r\nbut a few hundred troops as enough for the wants of the city. The\r\nCount, however, paid no attention to this news, and, hurrying across\r\nthe Campagna, heard near the Ponte Salara that the enemy had that\r\nmorning penetrated the walls. Had he but known the real state of the\r\narmy, or by a headlong dash risked his all in the noble enterprise,\r\nhis name would have been honoured as the saviour of Rome. But his\r\ngenius was unequal to the opportunity, and he retired to Otricoli to\r\nawait the arrival of his chiefs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *10: Where indeed! The Duke of Urbino had left Florence on\r\nMay 3rd, but it was the 22nd of that month before he reached Isola.\r\nStrangely enough, he marched much slower than the barbarians.]\r\n\r\nThe Duke at length aroused himself, and moved rapidly forwards.\r\nOn the 3rd he quitted Florence, and at Cortona separated the army\r\ninto two divisions for facilitating the commissariat. One he led by\r\nPerugia, the other, under Saluzzo, took the Val di Chiana, with a\r\ncommon rendezvous at Orvieto.[*11] He was at the lake of Thrasimene\r\non the day Rome fell, and arrested his march at Perugia to effect\r\nonce more a revolution there, by substituting his friend Orazio\r\nBaglioni for Gentile, a partisan of the Medici. Santori justly\r\nobserves, that \"in the Duke of Urbino the desire of avenging old\r\ninjuries was suspected to have prevailed over zeal for the honour of\r\nItaly and the safety of Rome\": indeed, this ill-timed gratification\r\nof an old grudge cost several precious days. On the 9th, his advanced\r\nguard were met at Casalino on the Tiber by a fugitive from Rome with\r\nnews of the fall of that city, and again halted. Thus it was the 16th\r\nere he joined the other division of the army at Orvieto, where it had\r\npreceded him by five days, and whence, after cruelly sacking Città\r\ndella Pieve, which refused supplies, he sent on a strong party of\r\ntwo thousand foot and five hundred horse to carry off the Pope. It\r\nwas commanded by Federigo da Bozzolo, whose gallantry well qualified\r\nhim for such an attempt; but his horse having unfortunately fallen\r\nupon him near Viterbo, disabling him entirely, the command of the\r\nexpedition devolved upon a subaltern, who, finding it daylight ere he\r\ncame in sight of S. Angelo, and his orders being for a night attack,\r\nretraced his steps without communicating with the castle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *11: This amazing route is inexplicable. The way by the\r\nVal di Chiana was, of course, a highway to Rome. The way by Perugia,\r\n\"with a rendezvous at Orvieto,\" is inexplicable. No more fatuous\r\nproceeding can be imagined. From Florence he would keep the Via\r\nAretina so far as Arezzo, following it indeed thence to Rigutino to\r\nCamuscia to the Case del Piano in the Perugino close to Trasimeno. If\r\nhe went thence to Perugia he was merely trying to delay his march.\r\nIt was off the main route, and would lead him into the valley of\r\nSpoleto. From Perugia to Orvieto there was no good road. If he wished\r\nfor a road to Rome via Perugia he should have joined the Via Flaminia\r\nat Foligno and followed it directly to the Eternal City.]\r\n\r\nThree days were now passed in consultations among the leaders, of\r\nwhich we have varying accounts. Guicciardini of course represents\r\nthem in the most unfavourable light for Francesco Maria.[*12] He\r\ntells us that neither the letters of the Pontiff, nor the entreaties\r\nof the Proveditori and the French general, could rouse the Duke's\r\nstubborn nature to active measures; and he describes him as full of\r\nzeal in words and proposals, but ever interposing obstacles to the\r\nexecution of any definite plan. On the other hand, Baldi asserts that\r\nan onward movement, suggested by the Duke at Isola,[*13] was, to his\r\ngreat regret, overruled by these authorities, and by Guicciardini\r\nhimself; whilst the Bishop of Cagli[14] pleads as his excuse for\r\ninaction, that the Venetians, finding their duty very different from\r\nfield-days and muster-rolls, refused to follow him, and even retired\r\nhome in great numbers. But, assuming the truth of the last averment,\r\nshould not the blame of such lax discipline attach to the general\r\nwho had led these troops through several campaigns? and may not the\r\nmoral paralysis which impeded effective tactics in the army be fairly\r\nadduced in mitigation of their unauthorised furloughs?\r\n\r\n[Footnote *12: It is impossible to represent the Duke in a worse\r\nlight than he appears. He behaved throughout the campaign like a\r\nselfish fool; he seems never to have understood the gravity of the\r\nsituation or the enormity of his crime. His biographer does not seem\r\nto understand it either.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *13: As we know, he did not reach Isola till the 22nd. Rome\r\nwas then sacked. If Guicciardini delayed, as Baldi says, we know that\r\nit was for some good reason, for his integrity and his patriotism\r\ncannot be questioned. We may well doubt Baldi's tittle-tattle.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 818, f. 5. Sanuto has preserved a\r\nletter which he says gave the first authentic information of the\r\nsack to the combined leaders, and which urges them to exertion in\r\nmost pressing terms. It will be found in II. of the Appendix, with\r\ntwo other letters detailing the principal incidents of that direful\r\nevent in terms which, though in a great measure anticipated by our\r\nnarrative, show the impression made by them at the time, and probably\r\nconveyed the fullest information of the catastrophe to the Duchess of\r\nUrbino and to the Emperor. See the Pontiff's brieves illustrating his\r\nfeeble policy, No. I.]\r\n\r\nAt length an advance was agreed upon, and on the 20th the\r\nhead-quarters were at Isola di Farnese, nine miles from Rome,\r\nthe Duke having marched by Nepi, and Saluzzo by Bracciano. Here\r\ndistracted counsels again prevailed, and, in answer to urgent\r\nrepresentations of his confederates, that the Pope must at all\r\nhazards be relieved, Francesco Maria ordered a muster of the army,\r\nwhich showed twelve to fifteen thousand men. Letters to the same\r\npurpose arriving from the Signory, and a message declaring that\r\nClement had broken off a negotiation with his oppressors on the\r\nstrength of speedy assistance, he at length consented that Rangone\r\nshould once more attempt to bring off his Holiness, by leading a\r\ndivision to Monte Mario, whilst he advanced to his support with the\r\nmain body as far as Tre Capanne. But on pretext of making a previous\r\nexamination of the ground, he wasted so much time, that night had\r\nfallen when they reached that place; and the expedition being thereby\r\ndelayed until morning, a general feeling then prevailed that the\r\nforce was inadequate, and the troops were thereupon withdrawn.\r\nAn even less creditable version of this evolution is given by an\r\neye-witness in the Duke's service, who attributes as its motive\r\nthe seizure of a quantity of booty, which had been removed from\r\nRome to Monte Rotondo; adding that, on seeing signal fires over the\r\nCampagna, and hearing a vague rumour that the enemy were approaching\r\nin force, the Duke suddenly faced about and regained his quarters,\r\nhis men in sad plight, and the rear stripped to their shirts by some\r\nskirmishers.[15]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Memoirs of Antenore Leonardi, dictated by him in\r\n1581, Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 1023, f. 85. Among the works dedicated to\r\nFrancesco Maria II. is a _Treatise on Tides_ by Annibale Raimondo\r\nof Verona [1589], who had served under his grandfather in Lombardy,\r\nand at this time. In the preface, a somewhat inflated testimony is\r\nborne to that Duke's military talents, arguing that his tactics\r\nwere ever aggressive when unimpeded by other leaders, who in the\r\npresent instance prevented him from marching upon Rome. But the\r\nauthor was eighty-four when he wrote a statement palpably intended\r\nfor an adulatory purpose, and his feeble or partial reminiscences\r\ncannot be considered of material weight. We have thought it right,\r\nin a passage so nearly touching the Duke of Urbino's fair fame,\r\nto embrace the conflicting views of our best authorities: the\r\nnarratives of Paruta and Morosini, Venetians, who had no interest\r\nin his reputation, go far to reconcile these and justify him. They\r\ntell us that the Signory, profoundly moved by the Pontiff's danger,\r\nsent pressing orders for their army to support him; and that, in\r\ncompliance therewith, Francesco Maria and the Proveditore Pisani\r\nresolved to advance upon Rome and rescue Clement, even at the hazard\r\nof a general engagement, but that the other Proveditore, Vetturi,\r\nformally protested against exposing the army to so great a risk: that\r\ndisgusted by the failures brought on by these misunderstandings,\r\nthe Signory superseded Vetturi, and grumbled against their general:\r\nthat the latter, annoyed by unmerited reflections, wished to throw\r\nup his command, and that it was only after cool consideration, and\r\nflattering advances from the senate, that he consented to remain in\r\nits service. See his formal defence, App. III. *Nothing can justify\r\nhim, and it is impossible to defend him with honour. After all the\r\nonly excuse for a soldier is his success, and Francesco Maria knew\r\nnot what success meant. The testimony of courtiers should go for\r\nnothing. History has tried him, and the ruin of Rome bears witness\r\nto the treason of this ineffectual Signorotto. The Pope surrendered\r\nCastel S. Angelo on June 7th.]\r\n\r\nIn order to cut short such discreditable scenes, the Duke, at a\r\ncouncil of war, announced his resolution to attempt no offensive\r\noperations until his army should be recruited by fifteen thousand\r\nSwiss, some ten thousand other troops, and forty pieces of cannon,\r\nwith ample funds for their pay; adding that, as S. Angelo was\r\nprovisioned for three months, there would be sufficient time for\r\nraising these reinforcements. This opinion he embodied in a memorial,\r\nwhich he sent on the 30th from Isola, by the Bishop of Asti, to\r\nFrancis I. It is preserved by Baldi, and in Sermonetta's Letters,\r\nand offers a verbose, laboured, and inconclusive defence of his\r\ndrivelling tactics. The burden of it is the inferiority of the allied\r\nforce to the enemy, the probable failure of aggressive movements,\r\nand an urgent appeal that the King should come in person, as the\r\nonly means of giving unanimity to a council in which each desired\r\nto lead. Indeed, the whole proceedings of the army attest the\r\nmutual jealousies and disunion of its leaders, which form the best\r\njustification of the Duke's dilatory measures, amid difficulties\r\nwhich he had not energy or decision to overcome.\r\n\r\nThe Pontiff, thus abandoned to his fate, learned by bitter experience,\r\n\r\n     \"With what a weight that robe of sovereignty\r\n     Upon his shoulder rests, who from the mire\r\n     Would guard it, that each other fardel seems\r\n     But feathers in the balance.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 18th he wrote to the Duke of Urbino, \"amid these calamities\r\nand perils,\" begging a safe-conduct for a messenger as far as\r\nSiena, to induce Lannoy to repair to Rome, the envoy selected for\r\nthis mission being Bernardo, father of Torquato Tasso. The Viceroy\r\nwillingly responded to this summons, hoping to succeed Bourbon\r\nin command of the imperialists. But finding the Prince of Orange\r\nalready chosen by the army to that post, he in disgust kept aloof\r\nfrom the capitulation, which was signed on the 5th of June, by the\r\nintervention of Gattinara. Its principal stipulations were these: 1.\r\nA safe-conduct to Naples for his Holiness, and such of the cardinals\r\nas chose to go, upon payment of 150,000 golden scudi, two thirds\r\nwhereof within six days, the remainder on the expiry of twenty. 2.\r\nSecurity for the personal property within the castle, upon payment\r\nof as much more, for which hostages were to be given until it could\r\nbe raised by a general impost or otherwise. 3. The removal of all\r\ncensures from the Colonna, and their restoration to their estates\r\nand dignities. 4. The immediate surrender of S. Angelo, Civita\r\nVecchia, Ostia, and Civita Castellana, with the further cession of\r\nParma, Piacenza, and Modena to the Emperor, as an inducement for the\r\narmy to evacuate Rome. This treaty was signed by nine cardinals,\r\nfour bishops, and eighteen imperialist officers, and the castle was\r\nforthwith consigned to a guard of the invaders, in whose hands the\r\nPontiff and his court remained virtually prisoners.[16]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 1677, f. 38.]\r\n\r\nBut many difficulties impeded completion of the remaining conditions.\r\nThe amount of ransom seems under various pretexts to have been\r\nconsiderably advanced, and is set down by most writers at 400,000\r\nscudi. In order to raise this sum, all the church-plate, which had\r\nbeen saved in the fortress, was hastily coined into specie, and three\r\nscarlet hats were set up to sale. Two of them were at once secured\r\nfor 160,000 scudi by the Venetians, ambitious of influence in the\r\nconclave. The third was bought for a creature of Pompeo Colonna,\r\nwhose personal hostility to Clement had become somewhat mitigated\r\nby grief for the sufferings he had brought upon the city, and who,\r\nin a pathetic audience with his master, obtained his forgiveness\r\nand benediction. Still, a large balance of the besiegers' demands\r\nremained undischarged, and the stipulation regarding the fortresses\r\nwas nullified, Civita Castellana being in the hands of the allies,\r\nand Ostia occupied by Andrea Doria, neither of whom would acknowledge\r\nthe capitulation. Parma and Piacenza were also held for the\r\nChurch, in consequence, as was suspected, of instructions secretly\r\ntransmitted by Clement. In the hope of obtaining better terms, his\r\nHoliness successively directed more than one member of the Sacred\r\nCollege to proceed as legate to Charles, among whom was Cardinal\r\nFarnese, his successor on the papal throne; but none of them would\r\nexecute the commission.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the miseries of the city were fearfully aggravated. The\r\nterrified peasantry having ceased to carry supplies where they were\r\nsure of misusage, scarcity was succeeded by famine; and the sewers,\r\nchoked with bodies and abandoned to neglect, engendered a deadly\r\nepidemic, called by Muratori, the murrain, which spared neither\r\nfriend nor foe. In August, the pestilence increased to a terrific\r\ndegree; and the invading army being reduced by long licence to an\r\nundisciplined horde, portions of it rushed in masses from the city\r\nof the plague. Some of these bands, after attempting to hang the\r\nPope's hostages, fled towards Terni and Spoleto, sacking the towns\r\non their way, until cut to pieces by the confederates. Nor was the\r\nPontiff exempt from scenes of suffering. Asses' flesh was served at\r\nhis table; and a greengrocer's wife was hanged before S. Angelo,\r\nfor dropping into the trenches a few salad leaves for his use. The\r\ncontagion spread so rapidly in the castle, that the invaders, fearing\r\ntheir prey might slip from their grasp by death, removed his Holiness\r\nfor some weeks to the Vatican Belvidere, until the scourge had abated.\r\n\r\nLannoy, having fallen a victim to the disease, was succeeded as\r\nviceroy by Ugo da Moncada, from whose mercy Clement knew he had\r\nnothing to expect, and whom Santori characterises as \"an experienced,\r\nclever, and sagacious man of the world, devoid of religion, full\r\nof fraud, and no observer of his word.\" He arrived on the 31st of\r\nOctober, in order to effect some new arrangement, when the Pope\r\npurchased by further large sums an exemption from several of the\r\nformer stipulations, in particular from putting himself and his\r\ncardinals into his enemy's hands by going to Naples.[17] To raise\r\nthis fresh imposition, four more hats were thrown upon the market,\r\nand were purchased by adherents of the Emperor. At length, after many\r\ndelays, the 9th of December was fixed for his liberation from a seven\r\nmonths' virtual captivity; but, distrusting every one, he escaped in\r\ndisguise the previous night. Concealing his face and beard under an\r\nold slouch hat and cloak, and laden with baskets and bags, he passed\r\nthe sentinels of S. Angelo as a pedlar or menial servant. At a\r\nsecret postern in the Vatican garden, he found a fleet horse, with a\r\nsingle attendant, supposed to have been provided by Cardinal Colonna,\r\nand, riding all night by Celano and Baccano, after a short repose at\r\nCapranica, he reached Orvieto, which he had some days before fixed\r\nupon as an interim residence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: The new treaty of November 26 is printed by Molini in\r\nthe _Documenti di Storia Italiana_, I., 273.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic relations of the Holy See at Madrid were at this\r\njuncture in the hands of Count Castiglione, with whom we have\r\nformerly become acquainted in the service of Dukes Guidobaldo and\r\nFrancesco Maria, and whom we last noticed as agent for the Marquis\r\nof Mantua at the Roman court in 1522, where he was again sent in the\r\nsame capacity on the election of Clement VII. The position of the new\r\nPontiff soon became one of great delicacy, and already were those\r\ndifficulties closing around him, which, during his reign, completed\r\nthe first great breach in the Romish church, and consummated the\r\nmischiefs of foreign invasion in the Peninsula. The struggle for\r\nuniversal dominion of those youthful rivals who occupied the thrones\r\nof France and the Empire, was convulsing civilised Europe, and Italy\r\nwas obviously fated to become the permanent prey of the victor. In\r\nthese circumstances, a character so deficient in energy and decision\r\nwas singularly inadequate to cope with the necessities of the times;\r\nand Clement's influence at Florence, far from affording a prop to the\r\ntottering papacy, tended yet more to distract his irresolute purpose.\r\nFalling back upon the usual expedient of small minds, he adopted a\r\nneutral attitude between the two contending potentates: but the days\r\nwere past when Pontiffs could grasp the balance of power, or curb a\r\ndangerous ascendancy; and Clement's views aimed not beyond siding\r\nwith a momentary victor. To carry out such policy fine diplomacy was\r\nrequisite, and Castiglione was selected to watch the interests of\r\nRome at the Spanish court. In the autumn of 1524, he accepted this\r\nNunziatura, to which was joined the lucrative collectorship of Spain;\r\nand after visiting the shrine of Loreto, he reached Madrid in the\r\nfollowing March.\r\n\r\nHis negotiations for the next four years embraced the politics of\r\nEurope, to which those of Italy were but an episode. We cannot\r\ninterrupt the thread of our narrative to notice them: a sketch of\r\ntheir progress, in No. IV. of the Appendix, may afford some idea\r\nof the difficulties of Castiglione's position, as the medium of\r\ncommunication between a master who, leaving him habitually without\r\ninformation, recalled his most momentous instructions after they\r\nhad been acted upon, and a monarch whose public measures were in\r\nuniform contradiction to his private assurances. That diplomacy so\r\nconducted should have issued in disgrace to Clement, ruin to Rome,\r\nand a broken heart to Count Baldassare, can excite no astonishment;\r\nbut the ambassador merits our pity rather than our blame. Indeed\r\nits complicated intrigues may well drive the historian and the\r\ncritic to despair. Incidents, which, although attended by important\r\nconsequences, seem sudden and unlooked for, might, upon more accurate\r\nscrutiny, be detected as results long aimed at, and patiently\r\nwrought out. Thus, some documents lately published by Lanz[18] prove\r\nthat Charles, although disposed to yield much for a satisfactory\r\naccommodation with Clement, had authorised Moncada, early in the\r\nsummer of 1526, to concert with Cardinal Pompeo Colonna a series of\r\ndomestic insurrections, in order to embarrass his Holiness into a\r\ndisposition for peace, the issue of which machinations we have seen\r\nin the first sack of Rome.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Lanz, Correspondenz des Kaisers Carl V. See also\r\nthe delightful and well-edited _Lettere di Castiglione_ by\r\nSERASSI. *Cf. also CASANOVA, _Lettere di Carlo V. a Clement VII._\r\n(per nozze, Firenze, 1894).]\r\n\r\nAlthough the acts of Charles and his generals during 1526-7 were\r\nuniformly and aggravatingly hostile to Clement, and prejudicial to\r\nthe papacy, they must be regarded as in some measure forced upon him\r\nby the shuffling of his Holiness. His own position and prospects were\r\nnot then by any means so secure as to render redundant the support\r\nstill carried by the influence of the Keys; and the cherished aim\r\nof his manhood, which would have united Western Europe in one faith\r\nand under one sway, had not yet been abandoned as a fitful dream. By\r\nkeeping in view these peculiarities in his situation, we may in some\r\nmeasure reconcile the obvious contradictions between his professions\r\nand his policy--between his language to Castiglione and the conduct\r\nof Bourbon; and we may appreciate in their true sense such apparently\r\nfulsome and false expressions as he thus addressed to Clement, on the\r\n18th of September, 1526:--\"And since God has constituted us two as\r\nmighty luminaries, it behoves us to endeavour that the globe should\r\nbe enlightened by us, and to see that no eclipse occur through our\r\ndifferences; let us, then, take counsel together for the general\r\nweal, for repressing barbarian inroads, and restraining sectarian\r\nerror.\" At a moment when the eastern frontier of the empire had been\r\nbroken down by the victorious Crescent; when the crowns of Hungary\r\nand Bohemia were tottering on his brother's brow; and when, as he\r\nwrites in 1526, the wars of Italy had extracted every ducat from\r\nhis treasury, we may well suppose how sincere was his wish for a\r\nsettlement of those protracted struggles within the Alps, and for\r\na union of interests with the Holy See. That his measures little\r\naccorded with that object, and nowise tended to bring it about,\r\narose less from want of sincere intention than from an ill-judged\r\nmixture of good words and hard blows, partly dictated by his own\r\ndeficient judgment, partly by the misapprehension of his officers.\r\nThough therefore the pillage of Rome by the Colonna was a natural\r\nconsequence of his own intrigues, the regret he expressed to the\r\nPontiff that his people had been driven to it [\"_que l'on ait donné\r\nl'occasion à mes gens que tel désastre soit advenu_\"] was, no doubt,\r\nhis real feeling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anderson_\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR CHARLES V\r\n\r\n_From the picture by Titian in the Prado Gallery, Madrid_]\r\n\r\nEqually inconsistent in appearance, but natural in the circumstances,\r\nwas his conduct in reference to Bourbon's outrageous proceedings.\r\nWhen news of the sack reached Madrid, he affected great indignation,\r\nand put his court into mourning. On the 25th of July, he addressed\r\nto the magistracy of Rome a letter defending his proceedings.\r\nAfter narrating his liberation of Francis, and the various other\r\nsacrifices made by him, preliminary to such a general pacification\r\nas might enable all Christian powers to unite their arms against\r\nthe Infidel, he charged the Pope with defeating this scheme by\r\nsuddenly, and without reason, instigating an attack upon him and\r\nthe imperial dignity, whereby he was compelled from self-defence to\r\nmarch fresh forces upon Italy, in what he regarded as a worse than\r\ncivil broil. Moreover, new alliances against him having been arranged\r\nby his Holiness, and the truce actually broken, his troops had no\r\nalternative but to adopt compulsory measures. That these should, by\r\nthe blunders of his officers, have led to the siege of the city,\r\nwithout his knowledge, he deeply regretted, and gladly would shed\r\nhis best blood to repair its disasters. But great as had been the\r\nsacrifice, he consoled himself with a hope of its paving the way\r\nfor a general peace, which he would do his utmost to accelerate. In\r\nfine, he wound up with most sonorous professions of devotion to the\r\ngrandeur of the Roman name.[19]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 1677, f. 36.]\r\n\r\nThe Pontiff's natural dissatisfaction with his ambassador at Madrid\r\nwas very plainly expressed in a letter of the 20th of August, which\r\ntaxed him with undue reliance upon the Emperor's vague protestations,\r\nimputing generally to him a want of foresight preceding the calamity\r\nof Rome, and a neglect of the proper remedies for that mischief. To\r\nthis brief, Castiglione answered at considerable length, and with\r\nunnecessary diffuseness, as soon as it reached him in December.[20]\r\nThe substance of his defence is that, on every occasion during the\r\nfour years of his mission, he had laboured to establish a good\r\nunderstanding between his Holiness and Charles, and had been met\r\nwith assurances, verbal and written, of his Majesty's anxious desire\r\nto meet these views; but that the great distance, and the delays of\r\ncommunication with Rome, not only rendered it impossible to provide\r\nfor the successive exigencies as they arose, but left him entirely in\r\nthe dark as to the most important movements until too late to avert\r\nimpending mischief. Thus he had no intelligence of the truce arranged\r\nwith Lannoy on the 15th of March, till he heard of its being rejected\r\nby Bourbon. These excuses ostensibly satisfied Clement; and, however\r\ninadequate they might be deemed in ordinary cases of diplomatic\r\nblundering, they may be allowed some weight in this instance; for,\r\nalthough the Emperor could scarcely fail to anticipate from the sack\r\nof Rome new facilities for domination in Italy, in consequence of\r\nthe permanent humiliation of the papacy, history must acquit him of\r\na preconcerted plan to bring about a catastrophe which incidentally\r\nresulted from Bourbon's disobedience and the disorganisation of his\r\narmy. Indeed, had Charles been as much interested in the welfare of\r\nthe Eternal City as Castiglione himself, he would have been powerless\r\nto arrest the destroyer, whose death had removed him from all\r\nreckoning on this side of the grave, and prevented his master from\r\nsacrificing him in token of good faith. It is, however, impossible\r\nto regard without contempt the hollow professions of an autograph\r\nletter addressed by the Emperor to Clement, on the 22nd of November,\r\nwherein he congratulated his Holiness on his supposed liberation,\r\nthanking God for it \"with joy as sincere as was the grief with which\r\nI heard of your detention from no fault of mine.\" Avowing himself\r\nhis most humble and loyal son, ready to use every effort for the\r\nrestoration and increment of the apostolic dignity, he besought the\r\nPontiff to credit nothing to the contrary that might be inserted by\r\nfalse and interested suggestions.[21]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: _Lettere de' Principi_, I., 83.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: _Lettere de' Principi_, I., 71, 110.]\r\n\r\nSuch are the considerations which seem calculated, and not altogether\r\ninadequate, to account for the eccentric policy and hollow\r\nprofessions of Charles, in so far as we can gather from the strange\r\nevents thus briefly sketched. But, if we are to rely upon a different\r\nview brought forward by the Sieur de Brantôme in his anecdotes of\r\nBourbon, the advance of the imperialist army was not dictated from\r\nMadrid. In his gossiping and often apocryphal pages is detailed\r\na conversation held by him at Gaeta with a veteran, who in youth\r\nhad been with the Constable, and who imputed to that renegade an\r\nintention of seizing upon the sovereignty of Rome. His overweening\r\nvanity and unbounded ambition countenance the idea, and the way\r\nin which he is there stated to have conciliated his soldiery, by\r\npandering to their worst passions, gives colour to the charge. If it\r\nbe credited, Clement's indignation was misplaced, and Charles might\r\nhave defended his consistency at the expense of his pride, could he\r\nhave demeaned himself to acknowledge having been baffled and betrayed\r\nby his own general.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus ended the Sack of Rome. No similar calamity had befallen the\r\nHoly City since the devastation of Robert Guiscard, who, four\r\ncenturies and a half before, at the head of his Apulian Normans,\r\nlaid in ruin and ashes the most monumental portion of the imperial\r\ncapital. On this occasion, fewer remains of antiquity were exposed\r\nto destruction, but the people suffered far more severely. From four\r\nto six thousand of them fell in the first fury of the barbarians,\r\nbesides many who perished by more mature cruelties. Thirty thousand\r\nare said to have sunk under the famine and pestilence which, during\r\nmany subsequent months, ravaged the devoted city, leaving only about\r\nas many more for its entire population, which, according to Giovio,\r\nhad, ten years before, amounted to eighty-five thousand. The value of\r\nproperty pillaged and destroyed was supposed to exceed two millions\r\nof golden ducats; the amount extorted in ransoms has been stated\r\nat a nearly equal sum. So general a pauperism ensued, that regular\r\ndistributions were long continued from the papal treasury, drained as\r\nit had been. But a great revival of religious observances followed,\r\nbeing inculcated by the clergy and government, and practised very\r\ngenerally among the inhabitants, whose oblivion of such duties, and\r\naddiction to debauchery, usury, and every grovelling pursuit, had\r\nhitherto been scandalously apparent. Throughout all these scenes of\r\nmisery, the Pontiff had bewailed the misfortunes of his subjects\r\nmore than his own sufferings, and had penitently confessed himself\r\ntheir author. It was not till the 6th of October, in the following\r\nyear, that he returned to his capital, pale and thin, languid and\r\ndisheartened; and at the moment of his arrival, a preternatural storm\r\nburst over the city, succeeded by a most destructive flood. Nor were\r\nsuch omens out of season. In him had set the ancient glory of the\r\npapacy. From the moment that his predecessors, mingling in the arena\r\nof international strife, descended from arbiters to parties in the\r\nconflicts of Europe, their influence waned. When they had to canvass\r\nfor the support of temporal sovereigns, they ceased to command them.\r\nBut, after Clement was reduced to sue for personal protection to the\r\nsuccessor of one who had knelt before a pontiff, the prestige of\r\npapal power was gone, its sceptre was shivered in the dust.[22]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: The name CLEMENT has been remarked as unlucky\r\nfor the papacy. Under Clement V. the Holy See was translated to\r\nFrance; under Clement VI. the metropolitan church of the Lateran\r\nwas burnt; Clement VII. saw Rome pillaged by an army of transalpine\r\nheretics, and capitulated to them.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n     The Duke's mischievous policy--New league against Charles\r\n     V.--A French army reaches Naples--The Duke's campaign in\r\n     Lombardy--Peace restored--Siege of Florence--Coronation of\r\n     the Emperor at Bologna--The independence of Italy finally\r\n     lost--Leonora Duchess of Urbino--The Duke's military\r\n     discourses.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must now return to the confederate camp at Isola, which the Duke\r\nof Urbino broke up, after having eased his conscience by sending to\r\nFrancis I. the explanation of his views to which we have referred.\r\nThe general feeling regarding his conduct was testified by a speedy\r\nwithdrawal of many forces under his command, some deserting to the\r\nenemy, others retiring to their homes. On the 1st of June, he was\r\nat Monterosi, and thence fell back upon Viterbo and Todi, where he\r\nobtained some inglorious successes over the imperialist bands, as\r\nthey fled in disorder from plague-stricken Rome. During the autumn\r\nhis troops, which gradually diminished to a few thousands, led a\r\nlife of disreputable pillage about the valley of the Tiber; and,\r\nafter again embroiling himself in the affairs of Perugia with little\r\ncredit or success, he interfered in the succession of Camerino in\r\na way which we shall find eventually pregnant with mischief to his\r\nson. On the Pontiff's arrival at Orvieto, he hastened to wait upon\r\nhis Holiness, and put forward the Venetian commissioner to make a\r\nlaboured justification of his recent miscarriages. Clement, affecting\r\ncontentment with what was beyond redress, received him cordially, and\r\nhinted at a union of his son Guidobaldo with Caterina, daughter of\r\nhis late competitor, Lorenzo de' Medici. But ere long he reaped the\r\nfruit of his feeble policy, by hearing that he was spoken of in the\r\nmost disparaging terms by the gallant Francis I., and by the French\r\ngeneral Lautrec.\r\n\r\nStill more mortifying to him was the distrust shown by his Venetian\r\nemployers. We learn from Sanuto's Diaries that, early in May, his\r\nDuchess had repaired to Venice, with the young Guidobaldo and a\r\nsuite of forty persons, while the visits passing between her and the\r\nimperial ambassador soon became matter of unfavourable comment. On\r\nthe 29th of June, a guard of barges was placed near her residence,\r\nto intercept any attempt at escape; and on the envoy from Urbino\r\nquestioning this proceeding, the Doge said, in explanation, \"We have\r\nmuch reliance on our Captain from past experience, but what has been\r\ndone was to satisfy the vulgar.\" Hearing that his wife and son were\r\nthus under surveillance, as hostages for his good faith, the Duke, on\r\nthe 9th of July, penned a remonstrance and justification, somewhat\r\nsimilar to that which he had transmitted to the French king. It will\r\nbe found in the Appendix, No. III., and, though a most inconclusive\r\ndefence, it was well received by the Signory, and his family were\r\nso far released from constraint, that, early in August, the Duchess\r\nwas allowed to go for health to the baths of Abano. News of her\r\ndeparture from such a cause were little consolation to her lord, who\r\ndeclared that, were she to die, he should be in despair. Remembering,\r\nhowever, the fate of Carmagnola, he would not venture in person to\r\nVenice, until he had twice sent his confidential friend Leonardi\r\nto reconnoitre the state of feeling there. Reassured at length, by\r\npressing invitations from the Signory, he in the spring took ship at\r\nPesaro with a small suite, and was met upon landing by an escort of\r\ntwenty gentlemen in scarlet, who conducted him to his lodging. Next\r\nday he was admitted to the interview which he had demanded, and was\r\nreceived at the top of the great stairs by the Doge, followed by\r\nthe principal senators. After mutual embraces, the Duke was led to a\r\nseat of honour, and had audience for an hour and a half. This being\r\nconcluded, the public were admitted to see their Captain-general, who\r\nwas richly decked in diamonds, with a massive bracelet of twisted\r\ngold on his left arm, and a jewelled device in his cap. On returning\r\nto his apartment, he had from the Signory the customary compliment\r\nof confections, malmsey, and wax lights. It would be hard to say how\r\nfar he was indebted to his oratory for this happy extrication from\r\nhis difficulties; but we are told by one of his suite that many of\r\nthe nobility, who crowded to pay their respects, besought a sight of\r\nhis speech to the senate, insisting that so eloquent an oration must\r\nneeds have been written and committed to memory.[23]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Leonardi's Memoirs, Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 1023, f. 85.\r\nMost of the preceding details have been gathered from Sanuto's\r\nDiaries.]\r\n\r\nThinking it well to retire with flying colours, he next morning\r\ntook his departure; and his party, being challenged by three of the\r\npatrol for riding armed, answered by beating them to death. The\r\nsame intemperate behaviour brought him ere many days into a new\r\ndilemma with his employers. Gian Andrea da Prato, an officer of\r\nthe Republic, having somewhat disrespectfully combated his opinion\r\nas to the defences of Peschiera, received from him a severe blow\r\nin the face, tearing it with a diamond ring he happened to wear,\r\nwhich was followed up by a severe beating with his baton of command;\r\nLeonardi adding that it was well for him the Duke was unarmed. The\r\nVenetian officers, protesting against this violence as an insult to\r\nthe Signory, and as incompatible with due freedom of discussion in\r\ncouncil, sent a complaint to the senate; but the Duke's resident\r\nminister succeeded in averting their indignation by explanations.\r\nTheir satisfaction with his services under the banner of St. Mark\r\nwas further testified by presenting him with a palace worth 10,000\r\nscudi, which may fairly be taken into account as countervailing the\r\nstrictures of Guicciardini and Sismondi.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Rome being known, a new coalition was hastily patched\r\nup, wherein France, England, Venice, and Florence were parties, and\r\nto which the free cardinals, in name of the Sacred College, adhered.\r\nIts avowed object was to check the exorbitant power of Charles in\r\nItaly, and to establish Francesco Sforza in Milan, then held by\r\nAntonio della Leyva for the Emperor. A powerful French army under\r\nLautrec marched on the 30th of June, and, on its arrival in Lombardy,\r\nthe Venetians recalled most of their forces from Central Italy. On\r\nthe 4th of October Pavia was taken and miserably sacked, and Milan\r\nmight have become an easy prey had not Lautrec preferred advancing\r\nfor the Pope's liberation. But, having lost time in extorting\r\ncontributions from Piacenza and Parma, he had only reached Reggio\r\nwhen he heard of his escape from durance. Clement, though avowing\r\ngratitude for these exertions on his behalf, declined committing\r\nhimself by any overt act against the Emperor, whose troops still\r\noccupied Rome.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe year which now closed is justly characterised by Muratori as the\r\nmost fatal and lamentable for Italy that history has commemorated.\r\nThe horrors of war, which, during its course, were poured in\r\naccumulated measure upon the Eternal City, fell largely upon many\r\nother parts of the Peninsula. Four foreign armies were let loose upon\r\nher plains, to steep them in misery, and the enormities attending\r\nthe sack of Rome were repeated at Pavia, Spoleto, and a multitude\r\nof minor towns in Lombardy and Central Italy. The furies of civil\r\nbroil were meanwhile scarcely less rampant. The Campagna of Rome, the\r\nsunny shores of Naples, the towns of the Abruzzi, were ravaged or\r\nrevolutionised by the arms and intrigues of the Pontiff. Florence,\r\nSiena, Modena, Rimini, Ravenna, Perugia, and Camerino changed their\r\ngovernments, under pressure of foreign force or domestic violence.\r\nNor were the elements more propitious. Incessant rains destroyed the\r\nharvest, and laid whole districts under water. With an unusual demand\r\nupon agricultural produce, the supply was greatly curtailed. Famine\r\nreigned throughout the land, and pestilence desolated the population.\r\nThe inhabitants, reduced to general mendicity, beset the streets\r\nand highways with their squalid children. Their murmurs by day and\r\ntheir screams by night met with rare responses from passers-by as\r\nneedy as themselves; and at length, worn out with suffering, they\r\nlaid them down to die. It was during this year of general gloom that\r\nMachiavelli closed his life; and to it specially applies that passage\r\nin his _Principe_ (whether then interpolated or written long before)\r\ndescribing the prostration of his native land. \"Conquered, enslaved,\r\ndivided--without leader or law--beaten, spoiled, partitioned,\r\noverrun, and in every way ruined--she lay half lifeless, awaiting\r\nsome one to heal her wounds, to arrest the robbery, pillage, and\r\nforced taxation of her states, to heal her long-cankering sores.\"\r\n\r\nTo this hideous but faithful picture one finishing touch is wanting.\r\nAlarmed by Lautrec's advance upon Naples, the Prince of Orange at\r\nlength, on the 16th of February, gave orders for the evacuation of\r\nRome. But his army, now crumbled away to some thirteen thousand\r\nmen, refused to march without an advance of pay, for which a final\r\ncontribution of 20,000 ducats was wrested from the Camera. Not\r\nsatisfied with this, the brutal soldiery redoubled their individual\r\nefforts, by every ingenuity of torture, to screw more treasure or\r\nransom from the wretched inhabitants. But a summary vengeance awaited\r\nthem. Such of the citizens as had arms secretly left the city, and,\r\nas their relentless foes straggled heedlessly across the Campagna,\r\nladen with spoil, they, by a succession of furious charges, recovered\r\na vast quantity of the plunder, and, stripping the rapacious\r\nsoldiery of their gala dresses and rich jewels, dismissed them naked.\r\nIn this state the exasperated peasantry, headed by Napoleone Orsini,\r\nthe warlike Abbot of Farfa, set upon and massacred them without\r\nmercy. So signal was these miscreants' fate that, in two years,\r\nscarcely one of them is supposed to have survived.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter delaying for some weeks at Bologna, to abide the issue of many\r\nintricate negotiations which followed upon the Pontiff's release,\r\nLautrec advanced, by the eastern coast, to attack the kingdom of\r\nNaples. His army is estimated by Muratori at about fifty thousand,\r\nthough stated by others at a much higher amount. On the 10th of\r\nFebruary, he passed the frontier by the Tronto, and at Aquila, and\r\nelsewhere in the Abruzzi, was received with open arms by the remnant\r\nof the Angevine party. On the 12th of March, the two armies were in\r\npresence at Troia; but, neither of them being anxious for a decisive\r\nresult, no engagement followed. After ravaging most of La Puglia and\r\nCalabria, the French troops sat down before Naples, on the 29th of\r\nApril, and continued the siege during most of the summer. Once more\r\ndid that delicious land, where the ancients placed their Elysian\r\nfields, and which is the terrestrial heaven of modern Italians,\r\nprove fatal to its spoilers. Its soil, fertile in nature's choicest\r\nproducts; its bright atmosphere, redolent of beauty; its climate,\r\nconducive to luxurious gratifications; its volcanic air, stimulating\r\nto sensual indulgences; its breezes, wafting perennial perfumes--all\r\ninvited to an excess of enjoyment, enervating to the physical, as\r\nit was fatal to the moral energies of the invaders. Their cup of\r\npleasure was drugged, and Naples was avenged on her destroyers by her\r\nown poisons, which they greedily quaffed. A contagious pestilence\r\nswept their ranks, and, on the 15th of August, carried off their\r\nleader. Weakened and discouraged, the remnant shut themselves into\r\nAversa, but were soon forced to a capitulation, which being violated,\r\nmost of them were cut to pieces.\r\n\r\nTo counterbalance Lautrec's expedition, the Emperor had ordered more\r\ntroops across the Alps, and, in the beginning of May, Henry Duke of\r\nBrunswick brought fourteen thousand Germans through the Tyrol to the\r\nLago di Garda. On the first alarm of their approach, the Duke of\r\nUrbino made the most of a handful of troops under his command, to\r\nprotect the Venetian mainland territory; and his biographers give him\r\ngreat credit for defensive measures which ensured their towns from\r\nattack, and obliged the invaders to move upon the Milanese. Pavia\r\nhaving been, about the same time, surprised by della Leyva, Lodi\r\nalone remained in Sforza's hands, and before it the Duke of Brunswick\r\ndrew his lines. But the destruction of his magazines by Francesco\r\nMaria reduced his army to great straits; and a virulent epidemic\r\nhaving carried off two thousand of his men, the residue broke up and\r\nmade their way homewards, after their first assault had been sharply\r\nrepelled.\r\n\r\nIn September, the Duke of Urbino's little army was reinforced by a\r\nstrong body of Swiss infantry and French lances, led by St. Pol,\r\nand it was resolved to recover Pavia. Scarcely was the siege begun\r\nwhen news of the desperate state of the French before Naples induced\r\nSt. Pol to propose withdrawing his contingent to the succour of\r\nGenoa, which, in consequence of Andrea Doria suddenly passing over\r\nfrom the side of Francis to that of his rival, was placed in great\r\ndanger. A brief delay was obtained by the urgent representations of\r\nFrancesco Maria, who, throwing aside his accustomed sluggishness,\r\ndirected operations in person. On the sixth day he effected a breach\r\nby blowing up a bastion, which placed the city at its assailants'\r\nmercy, and it was again exposed to the horrors of a ruthless sack.\r\nThis success was, however, counterbalanced by a revolution in Genoa,\r\nthe city declaring itself independent of France, and was followed by\r\nthe fall of Savona, on the 21st of October. It might have been saved\r\nby more prompt exertions on the Duke's part, who was unjustly blamed\r\nby his French allies for its loss, being, as Paruta assures us,\r\ninterdicted by the Signory from leaving their frontier exposed.\r\n\r\nDuring the weary wars of Clement VII., the fluctuations inherent\r\nin human affairs were rarely counterbalanced by high principles\r\nor commanding genius. Confederacies formed upon narrow views and\r\nselfish calculations were neither sustained with persevering energy,\r\nnor directed by men of enlarged views and gallant bearing. Indeed,\r\ncourage itself faltered and zeal grew languid, in contests which\r\nseemed to demoralise officers and soldiery. It cannot therefore\r\noccasion surprise that all parties were equally ready to play fast\r\nand loose; that the great powers kept themselves ever open for new\r\ncombinations; and that independent captains, true to old condottiere\r\nusages, readily transferred their services to the quarter whence most\r\nsubstantial benefits were likely to accrue. Thus, after the great\r\ndiscouragement resulting to the cause of Francis, from the loss of\r\nLautrec's army and the desertion of Doria, his allies began to waver.\r\nThe Pontiff, though scarcely recovered from the alarm in which his\r\nrecent misfortunes had left him, displayed an unaccountable leaning\r\ntowards their author; and even Sforza, having to choose between two\r\nclaimants of his duchy, began to think that the best terms might\r\nbe had from the Emperor. The Venetians were as usual waiters upon\r\nprovidence; but they so overplayed the temporising game, that the\r\narrangements for a double treaty between Clement, Charles, and\r\nFrancis found them still in the field, and they were left to make\r\nhead single-handed against the imperialists. As such a contest was\r\nnecessarily a defensive one, the Duke's dilatory manoeuvres were\r\nat length well timed, and the Signory preferred thus prolonging\r\nthe struggle to restoring the territory they had gained during the\r\nwar, as a preliminary condition of peace. The Emperor had landed\r\nin August at Genoa, with a powerful fleet and army, and new levies\r\narrived from Germany. St. Pol, after drawing off his troops towards\r\nGenoa, was surprised and shamefully beaten ere he could be supported\r\nby Francesco Maria,[24] who had encamped at Cassano on the Adda,\r\nin a position that menaced Milan, and commanded supplies from the\r\nBergamese territory, whilst it effectually protected the Venetian\r\nmainland from imperialist aggression. The Duke there resisted every\r\nattempt to dislodge him, until the senate had arranged the terms of a\r\ntreaty with the Emperor, which was signed on the 23rd of December.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: In his _Discorsi Militari_, pp. 7, 8, the Duke minutely\r\ncriticises the French general's tactics, which exposed him to this\r\nshameful reverse; but the details have now little interest.]\r\n\r\nThe ostensible motives of Charles in coming to Italy were twofold;\r\nto forward arrangements for a general league against the Turks, who,\r\nafter overrunning Hungary, had laid siege to Vienna; and to have\r\nthe imperial diadem and the iron crown of Lombardy imposed upon his\r\nbrows by the Pope. Bologna was selected for the ceremony, whither his\r\nHoliness arrived in great state about the end of October, followed on\r\nthe 5th of November by the Emperor. The two potentates were lodged in\r\nthe public palace, and addressed themselves to the former of these\r\nobjects with so much success, that on the 23rd of December a treaty\r\nwas concluded, wherein were comprehended all the Italian states\r\nexcept Florence. The Lombard question was settled, Sforza being left\r\nin possession of his duchy, but hampered with ruinous payments to the\r\nEmperor in name of expenses; whilst the Venetians, besides paying\r\nheavy sums under the same pretext, had to resign their acquisitions\r\nabout Ravenna and on the Neapolitan coast. Florence was not included,\r\nin consequence of its _de facto_ government being in the hands\r\nof the democratic party, who, in 1527, had availed themselves of\r\nClement's difficulties to expel the Medici; it was now, however,\r\nreplaced under their sway by the combined arms of the Pontiff and the\r\nEmperor. After ten months of obstinate defence,--the final effort of\r\nits old republican spirit, which commands our sympathy and respect\r\nfar more than the struggles of faction that used in earlier times to\r\ndeluge its piazza in blood,--the city was surrendered on the 12th\r\nof August, 1530, and its chains were riveted by a base bastard, who\r\nseems to have had nothing of the Medici but their name. In this\r\nsiege died Philibert Prince of Orange, one of the last survivors of\r\nthe invaders of Rome. Like his comrade Bourbon, he was a renegade\r\nfrom the service of Francis I., in disgust, as was alleged, at being\r\nturned out of his palace to make way for the imperious Wolsey, and at\r\nthe ridicule to which this slight exposed him in the French court.\r\nThe title passed to his nephew René Count of Nassau, who carried it\r\nfrom Provence to Holland, and was grandfather of William III. of\r\nEngland. Their leader fallen, their occupation gone, a serious alarm\r\nspread throughout Central Italy, lest the victorious soldiery should\r\nre-enact the horrors perpetrated by Bourbon's sanguinary host. These\r\nfears, however, soon subsided; indeed a century and a quarter elapsed\r\nere that fair land was again exposed to the devastations of foreign\r\nspoilers.\r\n\r\nThese diplomatic arrangements being thus satisfactorily concluded,\r\npreparations advanced rapidly for the coronation, and many princely\r\nfeudatories of Italy flocked to witness that august function. Among\r\nthese was Francesco Maria, who, though summoned as Prefect of Rome,\r\nhad some cause to misdoubt his welcome from the Pontiff and the\r\nEmperor. The old family grudge still smouldered in the breast of the\r\nformer, and he was alleged to have lately intrigued with Charles that\r\nthe Prince of Orange, after re-establishing the Medici at Florence,\r\nshould seize upon Urbino for Ascanio Colonna, whose vague claims\r\nupon that duchy have been already explained.[25] Indeed, a rumour of\r\nthat general's march upon his states in March, 1529, had suddenly\r\nrecalled the Duke from Lombardy, in order to provide for their\r\ndefence. To the Emperor he had been uniformly opposed, rather from\r\nthe chances of war than upon any personal quarrel; yet he did not\r\nhesitate to repair to the coronation, arriving at Bologna about the\r\n1st of November, and there met with an interesting incident.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Vol. II., pp. 420, 423.]\r\n\r\nAs he approached the city with his suite he was met by about fifty\r\nGerman veterans, who addressed him in their rough transalpine tongue,\r\nand through an interpreter explained that they had come to pay to\r\nhim their reverence, having served under his father in long past\r\nwars, inquiring where their old commander had died. They were told\r\nthat it was himself that led them to victory; but, unaware how early\r\nhe had commanded armies, they demurred to this, saying, that were\r\ntheir old leader alive his beard would be blanched. The Duke having\r\nassured them that their gallantry and attachment were well known\r\nand appreciated by him, they dismissed their doubts, crowding round\r\nto kiss his hands or mantle, and accompanied him to his lodging, a\r\ncivility duly acknowledged by thanks and a suitable largess.\r\n\r\nSeveral days having passed in visits of compliment, the Emperor\r\narrived, escorted into the town by the Dukes of Urbino and Savoy,\r\nwith their brilliant staffs. Mindful only of the renown which the\r\nformer had acquired in recent campaigns, the monarch summoned him to\r\nhis side, and conversed with him in friendly familiarity. He called\r\nhim the first general in Christendom, and complimented his officers\r\nas worthy soldiers of a famous school, whose complexions bore the\r\nhonourable scars and weather-stains of good service. Duchess Leonora\r\nbecame on her arrival equally the object of imperial favour, and\r\nreceived flattering testimony to her polished and princely manners.\r\nThe purpose of these marked attentions was soon developed, in a\r\nproposal to confer upon Francesco Maria the baton, as captain-general\r\nof the imperial troops in Italy. This gratifying offer he gracefully\r\ndeclined, pleading an engagement to the Venetians, which prevented\r\nhis listening to such proposals without consent of the Signory.\r\nTo them Charles forthwith addressed his request; but received for\r\nanswer that the same considerations which induced him to make it\r\nrendered them resolute in retaining the services of a leader who\r\nfor many years had brought renown to their arms; but that, though\r\nunable to spare himself, they were ready to place him with all their\r\nforces at the disposal of his Highness. The Emperor had employed the\r\nDuchess of Savoy's intervention in this affair, who at his suggestion\r\ncultivated a great intimacy with the Duke and Duchess of Urbino,\r\nand her pleading was on one occasion enforced by Charles in person\r\nin a well-timed visit. The establishment of this lady is described\r\nby Leonardi, who was particularly struck with the easy elegance and\r\ngraceful conversation of her six girlish maids of honour, seated on\r\ncushions of tawny velvet, and gaily decked in rich jewels, plumes,\r\nand streaming ribbons, chatting merrily with her guests. The Emperor,\r\nfar from taking umbrage at his disappointment, sought Francesco\r\nMaria's opinion as to the person best fitted for commander-in-chief,\r\nwho recommended the appointment of Antonio della Leyva. Indeed,\r\nGiraldi declares that Charles \"never could have enough of his fine\r\ndiscourses or sententious remarks,\" and pressed him to name any\r\nfavour he would accept of. The Duke, thus encouraged, urged the\r\nrestoration of Sora, Arce, Arpino, and Rocca Guglielmi, which had\r\nbeen taken from him at the instigation of Leo X., a request to which\r\nCharles acceded about three years later, paying 100,000 scudi of\r\ncompensation to a Flemish nobleman who had been invested with these\r\nNeapolitan fiefs.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of February, in the chapel attached to the Palazzo\r\nPubblico, the brows of Charles were encircled with the iron crown of\r\nLombardy, which, as Muratori observes, had not yet been rendered a\r\nsacred relic by the legend of its having been formed out of a nail\r\nof the true cross. Two days after, he received the imperial diadem\r\nin the church of S. Petronio, the Duke of Urbino, as Prefect of\r\nRome, carrying the sword of state, with which the Pontiff had just\r\nconferred knighthood upon the Emperor. The populace were regaled\r\nin the Piazza with two bullocks roasted entire, whilst both the\r\ngreat fountains poured forth continued streams of wine, and silver\r\nlargess was scattered at all hands. An accident from the fall of some\r\nscaffolding, which nearly proved fatal to the hero of the ceremonial,\r\nbrought on a sharp altercation between the captain of the imperial\r\nguard and the chief magistrate of the city. To the threats of the\r\nofficer, to treat the place as he had already done the larger town of\r\nMilan, the latter replied that in Milan they manufactured needles,\r\nbut in Bologna they made swords. On the 22nd of March, Charles\r\ndeparted for Germany, in order to defend his Austrian dominions from\r\nthe Turks; and, nine days later, Clement set out in a litter for his\r\ncapital, where he arrived on the 9th of April, after spending the 6th\r\nat Urbino, on a visit to Francesco Maria.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom these transactions at Bologna there dated a new era for Italy.\r\nThe long struggle of Guelph and Ghibelline was at length come to an\r\nend--the standard of her nationality was finally struck. Succeeding\r\npontiffs were content to lean for support upon an authority which\r\ntheir predecessors had defied or resisted. It mattered little whether\r\nthat paramount influence was held by an Austrian or Spanish imperial\r\ndynasty; so long as the two Sicilies, Sardinia, and Milan owned its\r\ndominion, the freedom of the other states was merely nominal. The\r\nPeninsula was, indeed, no longer ravaged by European wars, yet the\r\nprotracted struggle did not close until the victor had riveted on\r\nher his chains. She was seldom desolated by invading armies, but she\r\nwas not the less plundered by licensed spoilers. Peace was restored\r\nto her, but independence was gone. The Reformation, too, which Leo\r\nleft a petty schism, had in ten years changed the faith of a large\r\nsection of Europe, and Rome was no longer the capital of Christendom.\r\nThe results of this change in the Church it is not the province of\r\nthese pages to notice, but, in common with other Italian feudatories,\r\nthe Dukes of Urbino felt the altered aspect of their political\r\nrelations. War was not now a profession demanding their services, and\r\nrecompensing them with glory and profit. The trade of arms had come\r\nto an end, as regarded the old condottiere system and its frightful\r\nabuses, and was modified into the more orderly machinery of standing\r\narmies on a limited scale. We shall accordingly find these princes\r\nfor the future little mixed up with the general affairs of the\r\nPeninsula, and scarcely ever taking the field, but left with ample\r\nleisure for the administration of their little principality, or the\r\ncultivation of their individual tastes. Had such been the lot of Duke\r\nFederigo or his accomplished son, their fame would scarcely have\r\nbeen dimmed, for theirs were virtues equally calculated to elevate\r\na court or illustrate a camp. But it was otherwise with the two\r\nremaining sovereigns della Rovere; and the glories of the dynasty\r\nwould suffer no diminution did we now draw our narrative to a close.\r\nYet these Dukes were not commonplace men; and, making allowance\r\nfor the age in which they lived,--when the fine gold of literature\r\nand arts had been transmuted into baser metal, and when genius had\r\nfled from a desolation which peace without freedom was powerless to\r\nreanimate,--they were not unworthy to rule in the Athens of Italy.\r\nThose readers, however, who have thus far followed our narrative must\r\ncontent themselves through its remaining chapters with characters\r\nless striking, views less general, events of narrowed interest; and\r\nmust bear in mind that the niche in the temple of Fame appropriated\r\nto Urbino, as well as that enshrining the Italian name, was earned\r\nere the coronation of Charles V. had closed the struggles of Italy,\r\nand consummated her subjugation.\r\n\r\nAfter that time, according to one of the most rational as well\r\nas eloquent of the new dreamers after Italian nationality, \"she\r\nunderwent a rapid yet imperceptible decline; yet her sky smiled\r\nbrightly as ever, her climate was as mild. A privileged land, removed\r\nfrom all cares of political existence, she went on with dances and\r\nmusic, happy in her ignorance, sleeping in the intoxication of\r\nincessant prosperity. Used to the scourge of invasion, the sons of\r\nthe south took up again their guitars, wiped away their tears, and\r\nsang anew like a cloud of birds when the tempest is over.\"[26] This\r\npicture, drawn in bitterness, but not apparently in irony, paints the\r\ndecline of Italy in colours more attractive than any we should have\r\ndared to employ; and we extract it chiefly for the sake of contrast\r\nwith the same writer's ready admission that the liberty of the old\r\nrepublics was cradled amid convulsions of faction, which eventually\r\nexhausted their forces, or stifled their independence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: MARIOTTI'S _Italy_, II.]\r\n\r\nIf the object of government be the greatest happiness of the masses,\r\nit seems, according to Mariotti, to have been more fully attained in\r\nItaly during the ages of foreign sway than in those of republican\r\nstrife. Admitting in some degree, this conclusion, we accord a more\r\nhearty approval to the character he has elsewhere given of a state\r\nof matters worse, probably, in that land than either of these\r\nalternatives,--\"that slow and silent disease, that atrabilious\r\nfrenzy--politics--which pervades all ranks, exhibiting a striking\r\ncontrast with the radiant and harmonious gaiety of heaven and earth.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur notices of the court of Urbino have been suspended during a long\r\ninterval from lack of materials. Indeed, the military duties of its\r\nhead too well accounts for this deficiency of incident, rendering\r\nhis domestic life a blank. Even the brief intervals when he could\r\nsteal from the camp to the society of his Duchess, were passed in\r\nsome neighbouring town, where she met him, or at Venice, where she\r\nmade a lengthened sojourn, partly as a safer residence during the\r\nalarm consequent upon Bourbon's invasion, but in some degree as a\r\nguarantee for her husband to the suspicious government he served.\r\nThese circumstances occasioned him prolonged absences from his state,\r\nof which his consort availed herself to prepare for him an agreeable\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nImmediately north-west from Pesaro rises the fertile slope of Monte\r\nBartolo, near the summit of which, but sheltered from the keen\r\nsea-breeze, Alessandro Sforza fixed the site of a villa called\r\nCasartole. The Emperor Frederick III., when returning from his\r\ncoronation at Rome, in January, 1469, was magnificently entertained\r\nby that Prince, and here laid the foundation of a casino, which in\r\ncompliment to him was named the Imperiale. Its dimensions were,\r\nhowever, unequal to that imposing name, for, on the death of Giovanni\r\nSforza, in 1510, it was valued at only 8000 ducats. Having devolved\r\nupon the Duke of Urbino, with the lordship of Pesaro, it was selected\r\nby the Duchess for a compliment to him, which may be best explained\r\nby the inscription she placed upon the building:--\"For Francesco\r\nMaria, Duke of the Metaurian States, on his return from the wars, his\r\nconsort Leonora has erected this villa, in token of affection, and\r\nin compensation for sun and dust, for watching and toil, so that,\r\nduring an interval of repose, his military genius may here prepare\r\nfor him still wider renown and richer rewards.\" To carry out this\r\nidea worthily, she summoned Girolamo Genga, of Urbino, one of the\r\nbest architects of his time; and under his able superintendence the\r\ncasino of the Sforza, distinguished from moderate country houses only\r\nby heraldic devices and a lofty bell-tower, was rapidly transformed\r\ninto a handsome palace, which the pencil of Raffaele Colle was\r\nemployed to decorate with its master's triumphs.\r\n\r\nThe site of this villa was admirably adapted as a residence for the\r\nsovereign of those broad lands it overlooked. It commanded every\r\ndwelling in the little city of Pesaro, though perfectly secluded\r\nfrom contact with its busy streets. The vale of the Isauro or Foglia\r\nlay in verdure before it, beyond which were the gardenlike slopes\r\nof Novilara, terminating in a varied landscape of hill and dale,\r\nwhich carried the gazer to the blue mountains of Gubbio. To the left\r\nspread the coast of Fano and Sinigaglia; to the right the high lands\r\nof Urbino were bounded by the Apennines of Carpegna and the isolated\r\nheights of San Marino. In a word, the Imperiale scanned the whole\r\nduchy of Urbino, of which it might, not inaptly, be considered the\r\neye. The attractions of this princely retreat have been described\r\nwith enthusiasm by Ludovico Agostini, who enjoyed them in their\r\nprime, and whose eulogies remain unedited in the Oliveriana Library.\r\nBut they owe to the pen of Bernardo Tasso a worthier and wider\r\ncelebrity, in his letter to Vincenzo Laureo, which sums up the\r\nadvantages of the Villa by declaring that no place in Italy united\r\nwith a temperate and healthful climate so many conveniences and\r\nenjoyable spots.\r\n\r\nOf many laboured and costly productions of human ingenuity little\r\nremains there but saddening ruins.\r\n\r\nThe lofty oaks celebrated by Agostini have yielded to the axe; the\r\ngrove which served as a game preserve has shared the same fate; the\r\nonce innumerable pines and cypresses may be counted in units; the\r\norange and lemon trees, the cystuses and myrtles have disappeared.\r\nThough even yet of imposing appearance, the building has undergone\r\npitiable dilapidations. Almost every morsel of the marble carving has\r\nbeen carried off, and fragments may be purchased from the pawnbrokers\r\nof Pesaro. The frescoes, except that representing Francesco Maria\r\nreceiving the adherence of his army, which seems the poorest in\r\nexecution, are almost totally defaced. But that the saloons, where\r\nBembo talked and Tasso sang, have been found well adapted for\r\nthe culture of silkworms, the desolation, begun a century ago by\r\nPortuguese Jesuits, continued by a rabble soldiery, and permitted by\r\nits present proprietors the Albani, might ere now have been complete.\r\n\r\nBut while the works of man have thus by man been degraded, glorious\r\nnature remains unchanged. A few hundred paces lead to the summit\r\nridge of Monte Bartolo, a spot rarely equalled even in this lovely\r\nland. To the vast prospect we have but now feebly described, there is\r\nhere added a marine panorama, extending from the headland of Ancona\r\nto the Pineta of Ravenna, and including a boundless expanse of the\r\nsparkling Adriatic. A wanderer on that attractive coast, it has been\r\nmy privilege to visit this unrivalled spot, and listlessly to survey\r\nthe swan-like sails skimming the mighty mirror, wherein was reflected\r\nthe deep indigo of an Italian sky, bounded along the horizon by that\r\npearly haze gradually dissolving towards the blue zenith, which no\r\npainter but Perugino has been able to embody.\r\n\r\nOf Duchess Leonora we know little.[*27] Unlike her predecessor,\r\nshe had no courtly pen to transmit us her praises, no Bembo or\r\nCastiglione to celebrate the beauties of her person or the graces\r\nof her mind. She enjoys, however, one advantage over her Aunt\r\nElisabetta; for in a speaking portrait by Titian, we may read much\r\nof her character, exempt from the vague flattery of such diffuse\r\neulogists. Painted at that trying age when female beauty has\r\nexchanged its maiden charms for mature womanhood, the grave matronly\r\nair, the stiff contours and set features, with more of comely dignity\r\nthan sternness in their general expression, attest fidelity in the\r\nlikeness, and tally well with what we know of her temperament, and\r\nwith the trials under which it must have been formed. There we may\r\nobserve a composure calculated to moderate the fiery temper of her\r\nlord, a self-possession fitted to sustain him through his varied\r\nadversities. Her dress handsome rather than rich, her pose indicative\r\nof quietude, the spaniel watching by her side, the small time-piece\r\non her table, are accessories adapted for one accustomed to pass\r\nthe long intervals of her husband's absence rather in reflective\r\nsolitude than in courtly pastimes.[28] To such a disposition the\r\ncares of maternity and her children's education afforded an ever\r\npleasing resource, which she shared with the Dowager Duchess, an\r\nunfailing companion and friend, whose once lively spirits had been\r\nchastened by affliction into harmony with her temperament; but of\r\nthis solace she was deprived by her death at Venice in January,\r\n1526. In the autumn of 1529, Leonora, who administered the duchy in\r\nher husband's absence, received Clement at Pesaro, on his way to\r\nthe coronation at Bologna, with a princely welcome and magnificent\r\npresents. In a letter which his Holiness took that opportunity to\r\naddress to the Duke, he expresses gratitude for these, and for the\r\nattendance of the prince, \"a youth of the highest hopes from his\r\nexcellent dispositions, his modesty, and his natural inclination\r\nto literature, as well as his many estimable qualities.\" Whilst\r\npromising much favour to Guidobaldo, he compliments his father on the\r\nmild and equitable sway whereby the Duchess maintained his state in\r\npeace and tranquillity, and concludes with an apostolic blessing on\r\nhim, his consort, and his son.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *27: Cf. LUZIO E RENIER, _Mantova e Urbino_ (Torino, 1893)\r\nand JULIA CARTWRIGHT, _Isabella d'Este_ (Murray, 1904).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Cf. Appendix XII.]\r\n\r\nReturned to his state after so long a separation, Francesco Maria\r\nfound, during the next two years, ample leisure to attend to its\r\ninternal administration, and to watch the progress of his promising\r\nfamily. The eldest of these seems to have been Donna Ippolita, for\r\nwhom he soon received, through the Marquis del Vasto, an offer of\r\nmarriage from Don Antonio d'Aragona, son of the Duke of Montalto.\r\nAt the nuptials, which were celebrated with suitable splendour, he\r\nhad a very unlooked-for guest in Ascanio Colonna, whose intrigues\r\nto supplant him in the duchy we have lately noticed, but who,\r\nfinding these hopelessly foiled by the Duke's establishment in the\r\ngood graces of the Emperor, sought a reconciliation through the\r\nbridegroom, his cousin, whom he accompanied to Urbino. This frankness\r\nwas met in a kindred spirit by his host, and their amity was cemented\r\nby a generous hospitality.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was now, perhaps, that Francesco Maria took opportunity to dictate\r\nthe results of his long experience of war, in a series of Military\r\nDiscourses, which were published fifty years later, but which,\r\nbeing evidently printed from loose and unrevised notes, are not\r\nfairly amenable to literary criticism.[29] They are but desultory\r\nand disjointed observations, carelessly jotted down, with little\r\nattention to order or style, and edited without emendation, or\r\neven intelligible punctuation. The matter abounds in truisms and\r\ncommon-places, displaying neither enlarged views nor knowledge of\r\nmankind: the style is garrulous, diffuse, and redundant. Yet, as on\r\nmatters of military skill the Duke was considered a high authority,\r\nit may not be improper here to record some of his opinions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Discorsi Militari dell'eccellentissimo Signor Francesco\r\nMaria I. della Rovere, Duca di Urbino, nei quali si discorrano molti\r\navantaggi et disadvantaggi della guerra, utilissimi ad ogni soldato.\r\nFerrara, 1583. It was edited by Domenico Mammarelli, and dedicated to\r\nSignor Ippolito Bentivoglio. There is a transcript in the library at\r\nNewbattle Abbey, a. 3, 2, and a fragment of it in the Vat. Ottobon.\r\nMSS. No. 2447, f. 135. *Cf. also _I discorsi di F.M.I. della Rovere\r\nsopra le fortificazioni di Venezia_ (Mantova, 1902). These were\r\nwritten 1537-38.]\r\n\r\nThis was his idea of a fortified town: \"It ought to stand in a plain,\r\nits citadel commanded by no eminence. The rampart-wall should be\r\nthree paces wide at base, supporting an earthern rampart of fifteen\r\nor twenty paces wide, with barbicans. This retaining wall should be\r\nin height about twenty feet, and have above it a curtain of nearly as\r\nmany. The upper part, being most exposed to be battered, had better\r\nhave an earthen facing. There ought to be a platform, rising sixteen\r\nfeet over the curtain, placed half-way between each baloard and\r\nbastion. The baloards should have guns mounted only at the sides, and\r\nbe of massive strength, from fifty to sixty paces in diameter, that\r\nthe guns may be freely wrought. Should a baloard be taken, it will\r\nstill be flanked by the adjoining platforms, a ditch drawn between\r\neach of which would in a night's time recomplete the defences. The\r\nfosse should be about twenty paces wide, and is best without water,\r\nso as to allow artificial fire to be showered down upon the enemy.\r\nThere ought to be no counterscarp, seeing it generally serves as a\r\nprotection to the besiegers; but, if there be one, it had better be\r\nonly of earth, at a low angle of elevation. Above all, there ought\r\nto be provided many secret ports for frequent sallies, and for the\r\neasy return of the men. It has been long noticed that no fortress was\r\never carried but by some oversight of its defenders, and everything\r\ndepends upon a judicious selection of positions for defence.\r\nUnquestionably a single sin suffices to send a man to the devil,\r\nwhatever be his other good works; and, in like manner, one oversight\r\nin fortification may lose the place, as happened when I took Pavia\r\nand Cremona. In short, it is all very well to play with plans and\r\nmodels, but one must see to everything on the spot.\"\r\n\r\n\"He said, in reference to the fortresses of Legnano and Verona, that\r\nit was very ill-judged in the Republic never to carry things out\r\nas they had been planned, in consequence of frequent ministerial\r\nchanges, and the system of governing from day to day, and bit\r\nby bit, without reference to any general design. By adopting an\r\nopposite method, he had completed the defences of Pesaro much more\r\nefficiently, and at a third of the outlay it would have cost any\r\none else, simply because he was the sole head and executor, and\r\nkept in view the entire works, not the individual gates, baloards,\r\nand details; and by so completing them that it must be attacked on\r\ntwo or three sides, whilst provided with ten or twelve concealed\r\nsally-ports.\" He contended that a fortress on a hill was difficult to\r\ndefend, one on a plain less so; but that the easiest and most secure\r\nwas one whose defences partly extended along the level, and in part\r\nrose upon steep ground, such as Verona, which he maintained could be\r\nmore easily held by five thousand men against eighty thousand, than\r\nmost towns by eight thousand against half that besieging force.\r\n\r\nIn conducting a siege, the Duke dwells upon the necessity of a choice\r\ninfantry, in which German solidity should be happily combined with\r\nthe active troops of Italy and Spain; yet he admits that men-at-arms,\r\nwhen dismounted, can be turned to excellent account in an assault,\r\nand that light cavalry are of obvious value. \"Above all,\" he says,\r\n\"you require a well-supplied commissariat, and regular pay, with\r\nsufficient artillery and military machines. After choosing the most\r\neligible spot for encampment, just without range of the enemy's guns,\r\nthe first thing is to provide your baggage and supplies against\r\nsudden surprise; next to open trenches for your artillery, securing\r\nyour men by a ditch wide enough for their operations, but not so\r\nbroad as to be commanded from the walls, and taking care not to let\r\ntoo many of them at once into the trenches, so as to embarrass each\r\nother. It is an immense protection to flank your trenches with lines\r\ndrawn from your principal encampment close up to the city walls,\r\nwhich must be strongly defended against the enemy's guns, and must\r\ncontain a force adequate to check their sallies, and, if necessary,\r\nto cover the trenches, or even succour your camp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Should you resort to a blockade, it is best to establish your army\r\nin one or two towns ten to fifteen miles off, taking care to secure\r\nevery intervening place. At that distance your own supplies are more\r\neasily procured, and your light cavalry can readily intercept the\r\nenemy's convoys, whilst the garrison cannot attack you, except at\r\nevery disadvantage, and without artillery.\"\r\n\r\nAs for artillery, we find a recommendation of battering guns carrying\r\nfrom thirty to one hundred pound balls, and of field-pieces and\r\nship's cannon from fifteen to twenty pounds. The gunpowder in Italy\r\nbeing bad, fifty was the average of daily discharges; but the Turks,\r\nhaving very superior powder, could fire as many as seventy times,\r\nwhich was looked upon as a stupendous performance.\r\n\r\nAnimadverting upon those tardy tactics which never anticipated a\r\nmovement of the enemy, the Duke compared them to a child applying its\r\nhand to the parts successively chastised, without attempting to ward\r\noff the next blow; yet, Fabius-like, he considered that a general's\r\ntalent was more shown in his selection of suitable posts than in the\r\nconduct of a pitched battle. Popular risings he held very cheap,\r\nbelieving them utterly contemptible when not supported by disciplined\r\ntroops, and instancing his own experience at Florence in 1527, when,\r\nwith eighty soldiers, he put down an insurrection, and maintained\r\nthe ascendancy of the Medici.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the respective merits of various nations whom\r\nhe had seen in the field, he said that \"a good Italian and a good\r\nSpanish soldier are equal. The Swiss at the outset are an excellent\r\nforce; but, in a protracted campaign, they deteriorate, and become\r\ngood for little. The Germans sustain an onset of men-at-arms most\r\nvaliantly, and, during these Italian wars, have become in other\r\nrespects expert, especially at skirmishes, either in cover or in\r\nthe open country. The Turks, being unskilled in war, have hitherto\r\nowed their victories rather to the deficiencies of their opponents\r\nthan to their own superiority. He ascribed the success of French\r\narmies against the Italians to an absurd practice of the latter, who\r\nalways fought in squadrons of twenty-five men-at-arms, each squadron\r\nengaging another, so that the battle was made up of many separate\r\nskirmishes; and, in the end, the most numerous army generally\r\ncarried the day. Charles VIII., on the contrary, formed in three\r\nbattalions,--the van, centre, and rear,--and, with his force thus\r\nconcentrated, bore down the detached tactics of his opponents. Yet\r\nthe Duke did not consider this French disposition as invariably\r\nefficacious, preferring in many cases that an army should act in one\r\nbody, even at the risk of leaving its baggage and artillery in the\r\nrear, and comparatively unprotected. But, on this and similar points,\r\nhis maxim was not to adhere to any invariable rule.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding the construction of an army, we find this passage:--\"In\r\npreparing an expedition, the commander ought to imitate the process\r\nby which nature creates a living body, forming first the heart; then\r\nthe vital members, such as the liver, lungs, blood, and brains;\r\nnext the skin; and, finally the hair and nails. In like manner, the\r\nfoundation of an enterprise should be the general, who is its heart,\r\nand in whom should be united varied capacity, with perfect rectitude\r\nand justice. Then his officers should be strenuous, experienced,\r\nand implicitly obedient, for such captains are certain to recruit\r\nsoldiers of the same stamp. Next, let him look to his commissariat\r\nand military chest, and see that his arms and accoutrements are\r\nadapted to his enemy and the country. Lastly, let him regard all\r\nextraneous and casual aid as mere skin, hair, and nails, relying\r\nmainly on his own well-disciplined troops.\" The Duke considered\r\nthat \"men-at-arms are by no means so useless as they are sometimes\r\nregarded, and that, although infantry is the basis of an army,\r\nnevertheless it would not do to have only that force in the field;\r\njust as, although in the human body it is the eye alone which sees,\r\nthe hand which works, the head which guides, yet man would not be so\r\nperfect or beautiful a creature with but eyes, hands, or head, as\r\nhe is with all these various members. Hence he would wish to have\r\nsoldiers of all sorts in his camp,--men-at-arms, light cavalry, a\r\nGerman brigade, and a full complement of Italians.\"\r\n\r\nBut whilst the theory of warfare thus occupied his thoughts, he was\r\nnot neglectful of its munitions; and it was his special concern\r\nto provide for his veterans, horses, arms, and accoutrements of a\r\nquality which gained them general admiration. After nearly three\r\nyears of peace the Venetians, fearing that their swords might become\r\nrusty, ordered a muster of their forces on the mainland, and an\r\ninspection of their frontier defences. The reviews were conducted by\r\ntheir Captain-general in person, who spent several months of 1532 in\r\nLombardy with the Duchess, leaving the government of his state in the\r\nhands of his son Guidobaldo, now eighteen years of age. From thence\r\nhe was called to Friuli, on the approach of a disorganised mass of\r\nItalian soldiery, who were returning home from the Turkish war,\r\nburning and plundering as they went. By firm and temperate measures\r\nhe kept them in check, and constrained them to resume an orderly\r\nmarch. The only immediate result to the Peninsula from campaigns in\r\nHungary was an alarm along the Adriatic coast of a Turkish descent,\r\nwhich was made a pretext by Clement for seizing upon Ancona, and\r\nannexing that republic to the papal states.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\n     Italian militia--The Camerino disputes--Death of Clement\r\n     VII.--Marriage of Prince Guidobaldo--Proposed Turkish\r\n     crusade under the Duke--His death and character.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree nearly contemporary events had lately combined to extinguish\r\nthe nationality of Italy, and those liberties which, shared in ample\r\nor more sparing measure by her many states, had till now crowned\r\nher military glories with intellectual renown. In the sack of Rome\r\nthe power of the Keys had been shaken, the prestige of the papal\r\ncity had passed away. The defence of Florence was the last effort of\r\npatriotism, and with it fell communal independence. The coronation of\r\nCharles V. laid upon the Peninsula an iron yoke of foreign despotism,\r\nwhich rendered her virtually a province of Spain. A necessary\r\nconsequence of this sad change will be to limit the field of our\r\ninvestigation, and to restrict what remains of our work to the ducal\r\nfamily and their hereditary domains, which for the future were little\r\nmore than an appanage of the Spanish monarchy. The Lords of Urbino\r\nhad hitherto been prominent among the captains of adventure, and\r\nbore a part wherever engagements were offered, or hard blows to be\r\nhad. But the condottiere system being now superseded, a new mode of\r\nwarfare and machinery of defence became indispensable. Knight-service\r\nand the romance of war were swept away by artillery; the imposing\r\n_battaglia_ of men-at-arms proved powerless when confronted by\r\nbattalions of steady infantry, or out-manoeuvred by the dashing\r\ncavalry of Dalmatia. This lesson, first taught by the Swiss in their\r\nfastnesses, had been practically demonstrated to the Italians in\r\nevery great action from the Taro to the recent Lombard campaigns, and\r\nhad been adopted by most of their leaders. It now, however, became\r\nnecessary to apply it in another sense, and, seeing that captains\r\nwere no longer to be hired with their respective followings of\r\nefficient soldiery, to organise a militia of its own for the defence\r\nof such state, upon principles which Machiavelli was among the first\r\nto recognise and explain.\r\n\r\nBefore that system came into general use, the Italian infantry was\r\nnotoriously incompetent to cope with transalpine levies, as Francesco\r\nMaria had bitterly experienced in the war of 1523-27. He therefore,\r\nin 1533, instituted a militia of his mountaineers, under the name of\r\nthe Feltrian legion, which before his death numbered five thousand\r\nmen, in four regiments, commanded by as many colonels. The object\r\nwas to make them good soldiers without ceasing to be citizens; to\r\nmaintain in readiness at small expense a military population, who\r\nwere not men of war by profession. For this purpose lists were\r\nannually taken of all males from eighteen to twenty-five, learned\r\nprofessions and infamous persons being exempted, and to them arms\r\nwere given. They were drilled and instructed in the necessary\r\nevolutions, and a proportion of them were called into active service\r\nwhen needed. On these occasions they were well paid; but, when kept\r\non the reserve, their small stipend was rendered more attractive by\r\na variety of political immunities and fiscal exemptions, including\r\nthe exclusive privilege of bearing arms. The practical result was\r\nthis,--the able-bodied population were, on the one hand, brought into\r\na sort of direct dependence on the executive, and, on the other, were\r\ntaught that the safety of the commonwealth was entrusted to their\r\nswords and sinews. It is scarcely necessary to add that this system\r\nhas been generally adopted, and that on it are still based the\r\nmilitary institutions of most continental nations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn December, 1532, the Emperor returned to Italy, and was met near\r\nVicenza by Francesco Maria, who welcomed him in his own name, and\r\nin that of the Signory. Dispensing with complimentary formalities,\r\nCharles received him at once to easy intercourse, and, requesting\r\nhis continued attendance, spent much time in conversing with him on\r\nthe art of war. At Bologna another congress was held by the Pontiff\r\nand the Emperor, in which were discussed the affairs of Italy, the\r\nproposed general council, and the matrimonial speculations of Clement\r\nfor advancement of his house. The marriage of Alessandro de' Medici,\r\nnow created Duke of Florence, was arranged with Margaret of Austria,\r\nnatural daughter of Charles; but the hand of Caterina de' Medici,\r\nwhich the latter wished to be given to Francesco Sforza, was reserved\r\nby her ambitious uncle for a French prince. Charles left Bologna on\r\nthe 28th of February, 1533, and embarked at Genoa for Spain, after\r\ngiving some hope to Francesco Maria of a satisfactory settlement of\r\nhis claims upon Sora. Clement in ten days after set out for Rome. The\r\nestrangement between these potentates, which at this meeting began\r\nto chill their intercourse, was greatly widened by the voyage of his\r\nHoliness in the following autumn to Marseilles, where he celebrated\r\nthe nuptials of Caterina with Henry, second son and successor of\r\nFrancis I. At this second congress of Bologna, Titian met the Emperor\r\nby special command; and it was perhaps on that occasion that he\r\nhad commissions for portraits of the Duke and Duchess of Urbino,\r\nwhich now ornament the Uffizi gallery. The former is engraved as a\r\nfrontispiece for this volume; of the latter we have lately spoken:\r\nboth will demand further notice in our fifty-fourth chapter, and in\r\nthe last No. of the Appendix.\r\n\r\nIn April the Duchess Leonora gave birth to a son at Mantua, who\r\nwas named after Julius II., and was destined to holy orders. His\r\nfather had at the same time a severe fit of gout; and, on his return\r\nhome, the painful duty devolved upon him of providing against the\r\nvisitation of a scarcity which then lamentably affected Italy. The\r\nclose of the year found him a suitor with the Pope in the affair of\r\nCamerino, which we shall now briefly explain.\r\n\r\nThe small state of that name in the March of Ancona had been ruled\r\nfor nearly three hundred years by the Varana family, some of whom\r\nwe have occasionally mentioned in these Memoirs. Exaggerating the\r\ndomestic atrocities, then too frequent among Italians of their rank,\r\nthey became revoltingly notorious, in 1433-4, for a complicated\r\nfratricide. Bernardo, Lord of Camerino, jealous of his brothers\r\nGiovanni and Pier-Gentile, the offspring of his father's second\r\nmarriage, had them put to death by the agency of his own sons. Ere\r\nmany months passed, his subjects, loathing the foul deed, suddenly\r\nrose against its authors. With sweeping vengeance they slew him, his\r\nbrother german Gentil Pandolfo, and his six sons, dashing the heads\r\nof the little ones against the wall. The succession was thus opened\r\nto Giulio Cesare, son of Giovanni, who, in 1451, married the only\r\ndaughter of Sigismondo Pandolfo, despot of Rimini.[*30] He lived to\r\nsee the usurpations of Cesare Borgia, and, falling into the hands\r\nof Michelotto on the capture of La Pergola, the old man perished by\r\nthe bowstring of that monster in 1502, along with his eldest son\r\nVenanzio, and two natural children. Venanzio had, in 1497, married\r\nMaria, the only sister of Duke Francesco Maria, of whom we have\r\nalready had to tell a tale of scandal, and left one son Sigismondo.\r\nHe was born in 1499, and escaped the fate of his father and uncles,\r\nfrom having been sent in infancy to Urbino. There he was educated;\r\nand we have seen him defending S. Leo, when scarcely beyond boyhood.\r\nAfter years of imprisonment and exile, his uncle Francesco Maria made\r\nan ineffectual attempt, on the death of Leo X., to vindicate his\r\nhereditary fief, from the usurpation of his paternal uncle, Giovanni\r\nMaria, its _de facto_ lord. Sigismondo sought consolation for his\r\nhard fortunes in low debauchery, until he fell in 1522 by the hand of\r\nassassins, at the supposed instigation of his usurping uncle, who, in\r\n1527, had absolution of the foul deed, and to whose career we must\r\nnow turn.[31]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *30: Cf. EDWARD HUTTON, _Sigismondo Malatesta_ (1906), p.\r\n61.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Many details regarding these transactions have been\r\ngiven, vol. I., p. 411; vol. II., pp. 36, 317, 371, 419.]\r\n\r\nGiovanni Maria, second son of Giulio Cesare Count of Camerino,\r\nwas sent to Venice on Borgia's approach, and so avoided the fate\r\nof his family. On the death of Alexander VI., being then in his\r\ntwenty-second year, he made a descent upon La Marca, and possessed\r\nhimself of his father's seigneury, in defiance of his infant nephew's\r\ntitle to it. His authority was recognised by the Holy See, at a\r\ntime when the hereditary principle was loose, and a strong hand\r\nconstituted the best claim. He found a warm supporter in Leo X.,\r\nthrough sympathy of their common hatred for the della Rovere race,\r\nand received from him the lordship of Sinigaglia and prefecture\r\nof Rome, on the deprivation of Francesco Maria, along with the\r\nadditional dignity of Duke of Camerino. After the death of Leo,\r\nSigismondo for a few months made good his authority at Camerino,\r\nuntil supplanted by the usurper, whose title was conveniently\r\ncompleted by his nephew's murder; whereupon he became _de jure_ its\r\nsovereign, and continued in undisturbed possession of his ill-gotten\r\nhonours.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Duke Giovanni Maria, in August 1527, the male heir\r\nof the fief was Ercole Varana, whose eldest son, Matteo, had been\r\ndestined by the Duke's will to become husband of his infant daughter\r\nGiulia, then but four years old. This arrangement was, however,\r\nresolutely opposed by his widow, Caterina Cibò,[*32] niece of Leo\r\nX.; and ere any steps could be taken to carry it into effect, the\r\ntown was sacked by Sciarra Colonna, who, with his son-in-law, Rodolfo\r\nVarana, a bastard of its last lord, drove Caterina and her child into\r\nthe citadel. Forgetting the double feud of Francesco Maria with her\r\nhusband and her Medicean relations, she in her extremity besought\r\nhis aid, offering to plight her daughter's hand to his son, Prince\r\nGuidobaldo. The proposal found him ingloriously inactive in Umbria,\r\nduring the negotiations for release of Clement from S. Angelo, and,\r\nreadily accepting it, he sent troops to relieve the suppliant lady,\r\nwho continued for several years to administer the state in name of\r\nGiulia, with the passive countenance of her cousin the Pontiff. But\r\nthe jealousy which rankled in the breast of his Holiness against\r\nthe della Rovere princes, fretted at an arrangement so conducive\r\nto their aggrandisement, and at the first congress of Bologna he\r\nsought to break it off. The Duke's answer, as reported by Leonardi,\r\nwas, that he would risk life and state rather than withdraw from\r\nthe engagement, and that, if driven to defensive measures, the Pope\r\nshould in the end bear the expenses of the war. With the recent and\r\ncostly failure of Leo against Urbino in their recollection, the\r\nconsistory would lend no sanction to the inclinations of their head,\r\nand so the matter rested until the return of Clement from France.\r\nFrancesco Maria then formally applied for the papal sanction to a\r\nunion of his son with the heiress of Camerino, but was put off on\r\naccount of her tender age.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *32: Cf. FELICIANGELI, _Notizie e documenti sulla vita di\r\nCaterina Cibò Varano_ (Camerino, 1891).]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there occurred an incident characteristic of these lawless\r\ntimes. Like the other Italian commonwealths, Camerino had its\r\nexiles, expelled by faction or political convulsions, and Matteo,\r\nhaving rallied a body of these, surprised the city on the 13th\r\nof October, 1534, and seized the Duchess-Regent in her palace.\r\nHis object being the abduction of Giulia, who had escaped into\r\nthe fortress, he hurried her mother, in her dressing-gown, to its\r\ngates, and commanded her to summon the castellan to surrender. She,\r\nhowever, with extraordinary hardihood and self-possession, ordered\r\nhim to fire upon the assailants; whereupon their leader drew his\r\nsword and threatened her with instant death. The heroic dame, after\r\nejaculating a brief prayer, bared her neck and told him to strike;\r\nbut Matteo, quailing before her daring spirit, and apprehensive of\r\nthe infuriated populace, hastily withdrew, carrying her prisoner. He\r\nwas speedily attacked by the citizens _en masse_, and the officer in\r\ncharge of Caterina was glad to secure his own pardon by restoring\r\nher to liberty. A new inducement thus arose for placing the heiress\r\nin the hands of one competent to protect her; yet the redoubled\r\ninstances made with the Pope for completion of her marriage were met\r\nby continued temporising, until the opportunity passed from his grasp.\r\n\r\nOn or about the 25th of September, 1534, Clement closed his life.\r\nGuicciardini, his countryman and protégé, tells us that he died\r\nhated by his court and suspected by princes, leaving a reputation\r\nrather odious than pleasing, and accounted severe, greedy, faithless,\r\nand illiberal. Muratori reviews his character more at length:--\"He\r\nwas a pontiff not destitute of political capacity; circumspect\r\nand dignified; dexterous in business, including dissimulation of\r\nevery sort, and regarded by all his contemporaries as a man of\r\ndouble-dealing. Nature and experience had amply endowed him with\r\nmany qualities befitting a temporal sovereign; but it would be less\r\neasy to detect in him those virtues becoming the Vicar of Christ,\r\nor to discover, amid the religious tempests of his times, what\r\nbenefits he conferred upon the Church, what abuses or disorders he\r\nchecked, though from him took its origin and pretext that terrible\r\nschism which yet dissevers so many nations from the true Church. He\r\nmisapplied the papacy, its powers and resources, to instigate and\r\nmaintain wars, which, besides many other mischiefs, brought upon Rome\r\na dreadful sack, and upon his own dignity a shocking degradation.\r\nStill more did he turn these to despoil his native Florence of\r\nher freedom, and to aggrandise his own family rather by princely\r\nmarriages than by honourable and discreet advancement. He died\r\ndetested by the court for his avarice and close-fistedness, and still\r\nmore loathed by the Roman people, who imputed to his policy all the\r\nmiseries that befell their far-famed city.\" His versatile conduct has\r\nbeen fully exposed in these pages:\r\n\r\n     \"With every wind that veered,\r\n     With shifted sails a several course he steered.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, with him there originated national funded debt, that system\r\nwhich has so extensively affected the political, military, financial,\r\ncommercial and monetary relations of the whole civilised world.\r\nYet, though the results of his disastrous pontificate justified\r\nas they dictated these very sweeping charges, the testimony of\r\nthe Venetian ambassadors, who describe the earlier portion of his\r\nreign, is much more favourable, at least to his motives. Whilst\r\nthey represent him as timidly slow in adopting his measures, and as\r\nwavering and undecided in following them out, they commend his piety,\r\nhis willingness to promote reforms, his conscientious observance\r\nof justice, the regularity of his habits, and the simplicity of\r\nhis tastes. Possessing neither the liberality nor the epicurean\r\npropensities of his uncle, the contrast was unfavourable to his\r\npopularity; and those who had shared with Leo the pastimes of music\r\nand the chase sneered at discussions on engineering and hydraulics,\r\nwhich occupied the leisure of Clement.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Pontiff's death was known to Francesco Maria, he sent\r\nhis son to complete his nuptials at Camerino; but, within two hours\r\nafter his arrival there, a courier brought from the Sacred College\r\na protest against the marriage of the heiress during the vacancy of\r\nthe Holy See.[33] This impediment was suggested by Cardinal Farnese\r\nin anticipation of his election, which took place as Paul III. on\r\nthe 12th of October, the very day on which the bridal ceremony was\r\ncompleted. To balance this act of questionable fidelity to the See,\r\nthe Duke, by well-timed movements, repressed attempts to assert the\r\nindependence of Perugia and Rimini, and re-establish their hereditary\r\nseigneurs. But such zeal served him little with the new Pontiff,\r\nwho at once made the Camerino succession a personal question, with\r\na view to confer that state upon his own natural son. One of his\r\nearliest acts was accordingly to visit the contumacy of Caterina, her\r\ndaughter, and son-in-law, with a stern monitory and summons to Rome,\r\ntheir disobedience of which was followed by excommunication, and by a\r\nmovement of the pontifical troops to blockade Camerino.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Cuparini's account of the war of Camerino, Vat. Urb.\r\nMSS. 1023, art. 10. Leoni says the despatch arrived after the\r\nnuptials had been solemnised.]\r\n\r\nFrancesco Maria now interposed all his influence, backed by\r\nthe imperial and the Venetian ambassadors, to induce Paul to a\r\nrecognition of Giulia as heiress under the investiture given to her\r\nfather, with remainder apparently to heirs general. Having vainly\r\nexhausted the expedients of diplomacy in this cause, he protested\r\nthat the blame should not rest upon him of hostilities rendered\r\nnecessary in his son's defence, and, sending provisions to Camerino,\r\nhe marched at the head of ten thousand men to his support. At\r\nSassoferrata he was met by a deputation of the citizens, laden with\r\npresents, who declared that though their walls were the Pope's, their\r\nhearts and substance were at his disposal. At Matelica he found his\r\nson and the ladies, before whom he passed his army in review, and\r\nmarched home again without once encountering the papal troops under\r\nGian Battista Savello. In fact, it was a war of the pen rather than\r\nthe sword, for at every step he renewed notarial protests of duty\r\nand obedience to the Church, and regularly paid the excise, as well\r\nas the price of all the stores which he took up for the use of the\r\nVarana party. Apprehending that, if too far provoked, he would be\r\nsupported by the Venetian arms and by the Emperor, the Pontiff now\r\nsuspended martial measures, and pressed the point of law on the Roman\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nThus relieved from immediate anxiety in this matter, the Duke of\r\nUrbino resolved to pay a visit of compliment to Charles V. at Naples.\r\nAfter reaching the Adriatic frontier of that kingdom, he dismissed\r\nthe strong escort which had guarded him through the ecclesiastical\r\nstate, and proceeded with a small suite. The Emperor received him\r\nwith much courtesy, and sought his counsel in the invasion of\r\nProvence, which he was preparing. Francesco Maria would gladly have\r\nreferred the Camerino affair to his arbitration, but this being\r\nrejected by the Nuncio, he obtained simply the imperial mediation,\r\nwhich proved unavailing. He on this occasion presented Charles with\r\ntwo swords of tried temper, and a finger-ring containing a repeating\r\nwatch, the latter made at Pesaro. In returning he took the route by\r\nBenevento to the Adriatic, and halting for the night at the convent\r\nof Sta. Maria degl'Eremiti, near Troia, he allowed some of his\r\nattendants to examine into a curious tradition which then obtained\r\ngeneral credit. It was said that Diomed arriving here with a company\r\nof attendants, he and most of them died within a few days, and\r\nwere duly interred; but that their souls were transmigrated into\r\na species of bird elsewhere unknown, which ever since had haunted\r\nthe marshy grounds. These were seen but rarely of an evening, and\r\ntowards morning uttered sounds like human lamentations. They flew on\r\nthe approach of any one not of Greek birth, but allowed persons of\r\nthat nation to visit their haunts familiarly. Three of the Duke's\r\nsuite having volunteered to watch, they all heard mournful voices\r\nabout three hours before dawn, a phenomenon which the narrator makes\r\nno attempt to explain.[34] Having crossed to survey the Venetian\r\npossessions at Zara, the Duke returned home in 1536, on board two\r\ngalleys of the Republic. The rest of that year was chiefly spent by\r\nhim at his post in Lombardy, protecting the Venetian mainland during\r\nthe passage of some imperial levies; but his charge was no longer an\r\nimportant one, as the long contests for Milan had been finally set at\r\nrest in the autumn of 1535, by the death of Duke Francesco Sforza,\r\nafter naming Charles V. heir of his state.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Vat. Urb. MSS., 1023, art. 1.]\r\n\r\nApulia and the Venetian possessions in the Levant being menaced\r\nin the following year by Sultan Solyman, a general confederation\r\nwas effected for the defence of Italy and its dependencies, at the\r\nhead of which were the Pope and the Emperor. The Duke of Urbino\r\nas captain-general undertook to raise five thousand men for this\r\narmament, but, the danger suddenly passing away, distracted counsels\r\nprevailed among the allies. Finally, on the 31st of January, 1538,\r\na new league was patched up, to carry into effect a suggestion of\r\nFrancesco Maria, by diverting the war into the Infidel's territory.\r\nConsidering, however, his impending difficulties with Paul III.,\r\nthe Duke obtained a joint guarantee of the contracting powers for\r\nmaintenance in his state, in confirmation of papal brieves to the\r\nsame effect dated in the preceding November. About the same time his\r\nservices to the Republic were acknowledged by the present of a palace\r\nin the street of Sta. Fosca, valued at 16,000 ducats.\r\n\r\nThe views of the allies and their captain-general for this enterprise\r\nwere vast, comprehending the siege of Constantinople and an invasion\r\nof Egypt: and the latter was indefatigable in his endeavours to\r\nput the armament upon a footing equal to such extensive designs,\r\nboth as to its numbers and material. The enterprise was invested\r\nwith the sacred character of a religious war; but whilst Francesco\r\nMaria concentrated upon it the energies of a mind in its prime, and\r\nthe exertions of a frame renovated by new specifics against his\r\nhereditary enemy the gout, the hand of death was upon him. Returned\r\nto Venice from a comprehensive survey of her defences in Dalmatia and\r\nIstria, he was attacked by sudden illness on the 20th of September.\r\nForeseeing its fatal termination, he had himself taken by sea to\r\nPesaro, which he reached on the 8th of October. Next day he showed\r\nhimself on horseback to his people, but feeling unequal to the\r\nexertion he took to bed, and gradually lost strength. On Monday, the\r\n21st, a fit deprived him of speech, yet he continued sensible until\r\nnear daybreak of the 22nd, when he expired in religious penitence,\r\nafter receiving the sacraments.\r\n\r\nAll authorities agree in attributing his death to poison, but\r\nneither Leoni nor Baldi hint at the person whose \"envy\" dictated\r\nthat base vengeance.[*35] Giovio speaks positively as to detection\r\nhaving followed upon a searching inquiry, and points at those\r\ninterested in the Camerino question as authors of the crime. Sardi\r\nand Tondini charge it upon Luigi Gonzaga, Count of Sabionetta,\r\nsurnamed Rodomonte, the nephew of Francesco da Bozzolo, a condottiere\r\nwho commanded Bourbon's cavalry at the assault of Rome, and who\r\nfacilitated Clement's flight some months thereafter. This assertion,\r\nwhich is adopted by various writers, receives some confirmation from\r\na story in the gossiping MS. we have already quoted, that Gonzaga,\r\nhaving accused Gian Giacomo Leonardi, a doctor of laws at Pesaro, of\r\ninstigating the murder, was challenged by the latter, who thereby\r\ngained the favour of Duke Guidobaldo II., and with it the countship\r\nof Monte l'Abbate, near Pesaro.[36] On the other hand, this Rodomonte\r\nis stated in _Les Genealogies des Maisons Souveraines_ to have died\r\nin 1528.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *35: Cf. VIANI, _L'avvelenamento di Francesco Maria I.\r\ndella Rovere_ (Mantova, 1902), and _La Morte di F.M. della Rovere_,\r\nin _Fanfulla della Domenica_, 23 March, 1902.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Relazione della Legazione di Urbino, Bib. Marucc. c.\r\n308.]\r\n\r\nWhoever may have been author of the foul deed, it is agreed that\r\nthe perpetrator was the Duke's Mantuan barber, who is generally\r\nsaid to have dropped a poisoned lotion into his ear. Baldi only\r\nmentions that he did it \"in a new way,\" and gives no account of the\r\nmedical examination of the body which, he asserts, took place. In an\r\nold chronicle of Sinigaglia, Guidobaldo is stated to have had the\r\nbarber torn to pieces with pincers, and quartered in the streets of\r\nPesaro.[37]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 992. Gozzi's Chronicle, Oliveriana\r\nMSS., No. 324. Also Teofiles's MS. narrative, _penes me_.]\r\n\r\nAfter a cast in plaster had been taken from his features, the body\r\nwas dressed in a quilted doublet and hose of black satin, under his\r\ninlaid armour, over which was the ducal tunic, and, above all, the\r\nmantle of crimson satin embroidered in gold, which he had worn as\r\nPrefect at the coronation of Charles V. Next evening it was borne,\r\nwith torches, by the principal courtiers, to the great hall, and\r\nthere placed upon an elevated catafalque of black and gold, on which\r\nwere arranged his ducal helmet, three magnificent head pieces, and as\r\nmany silver batons of command; five standards which he had captured\r\nbeing set round with other trophies. It was watched all night, and\r\nlay in state till the following evening, when it was coffined in\r\nthe dress just described. The same night it was taken on a litter\r\nto Urbino by torchlight, escorted by a vast following on horseback\r\nand on foot, under soaking rain. At the confines of the respective\r\nterritories it was delivered over to the authorities and clergy of\r\nthat city, preceded by mutes and mourners of various grades; among\r\nwhom was led the Duke's favourite jennet, covered with black velvet,\r\nhis ducal mail and morion being carried by a page in deep weeds.\r\nReaching the city at sunrise, the procession was joined by the\r\nchief magistrates, nobility, clergy, and citizens, and so arrived,\r\nthrough tearful crowds, at the church of Sta. Chiara, again to lie\r\nin state until evening, when it was stripped of its armour, and\r\nthere committed to the dust at the left horn of the altar. It was\r\nsubsequently deposited, by his grandson Francesco Maria II., in a\r\ntomb raised over the spot by Bartolomeo Ammanati, from the design\r\nof Girolamo Genga, which was eventually removed as inconveniently\r\ncumbering the church. The following epitaph, written by desire of the\r\nwidowed Duchess, and ascribed to the pen of Bembo, is panelled into\r\nthe wall:--\r\n\r\n\"To Duke Francesco Maria, endowed with the most comprehensive\r\ncapacity for war and peace. His hereditary states, thrice lost\r\nby violence, he thrice by valour regained, and ruled them, when\r\nreconquered, with moderation; he commanded the Ecclesiastical,\r\nthe Florentine, and the Venetian forces; finally, he was chosen\r\ngeneral-in-chief for the Turkish war, but was cut off ere it opened.\r\nLeonora, his most devoted wife, placed this to her most meritorious\r\nlord, and to herself.\"\r\n\r\nOne more ceremonial was wanting to complete the measure of respectful\r\nduty to the deceased sovereign. On the 13th [or 22nd] of November,\r\nhis obsequies were celebrated in the cathedral of Urbino. The church\r\ndecorations, the catafalque, the vast concourse of clergy, of\r\ndeputations, and of people of all classes, were such as the mournful\r\nsolemnity required, and the sincere grief of his subjects dictated.\r\nThe function was conducted by Federigo Fregoso, Archbishop of\r\nSalerno, whom we have formerly known at the court of Duke Guidobaldo\r\nI., and the funeral oration was spoken by Maestro Benedetto Milesio.\r\nAnother, by Lorenzo Contarini, was pronounced at Venice, where\r\nthe Signory ordered a celebration of his obsequies with unwonted\r\nsplendour, besides voting him an equestrian statue in bronze. This\r\nwas never executed, but another statue of him, made by Bandini\r\nfor his grandson, the last Duke of Urbino, was presented to the\r\nRepublic under touching circumstances, which we shall detail in the\r\nfifty-fourth chapter of this work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe life of Francesco Maria affords a remarkable instance of\r\nthe extremes of fortune. He was deprived of parental care at an\r\nearly age, when it was peculiarly desirable as a restraint upon\r\nhis naturally fiery temper. Soon after, he was hurried from his\r\nhereditary state, and compelled to seek safety in France. In the\r\noutset of manhood, his ungoverned passion involved him in the stigma\r\nof a sacrilegious murder. Twice was he deprived of the influential\r\nsovereignty to which he had attained, and recovered it only after\r\nyears of exile, and at a ruinous pecuniary sacrifice. The lustre of\r\na brilliant position, and of a distinguished military career, was\r\nveiled by his utter failure to save or rescue Rome. Finally, he was\r\nsnatched from life just as a new and nobler field was opening for his\r\nmartial glories. Reversing the picture, we find a youth of ardent\r\ntemperament, born to princely sway, and becoming at eighteen the heir\r\nof one uncle in an important duchy, and the favourite of another,\r\nwho, by virtue of his triple tiara, conferred upon him yet a third\r\nstate. A military hero ere he escaped from his teens, his renown\r\never extended with his age. Thirty years after his star had set, a\r\nVenetian ambassador called him the light and splendour of Italy; and\r\nnotwithstanding some palpable blunders, he is still ranked with the\r\nfirst commanders of his native land. He died when his fame was at its\r\nheight, and transmitted unquestioned to his son, that sovereignty\r\nwhich thrice had been wrested from him.\r\n\r\nIt is from posthumous influences that his reputation has suffered\r\nmost severely; and the three standard historians of his times, in\r\nItaly, England, and France, have meted him sparing justice. Without\r\nquestioning the value of Guicciardini's narrative as the fullest\r\nexposition of the age in which he lived, and the most graphic\r\nportraiture of many of its features and incidents, we must demur\r\nto the \"fearless impartiality\" too hastily allowed him in modern\r\ntimes. True, he was not, like Machiavelli, a practised intriguer,\r\nacute to detect perverted purpose, or prone to assume its existence;\r\nnor did he, like Giovio, employ the iron stylus of vengeance, or\r\nthe golden pen of flattery, as passion might prompt or venality\r\ndictate. But, born a Florentine, and favoured by the Medici, he was\r\nthe partisan of that house in the closet as in the field; and no\r\none thus shackled could write impartially of Francesco Maria della\r\nRovere. Roscoe, with similar predilections, though far less biased,\r\nhad no inducement to become champion of a sovereign whom Leo X. had\r\ntwice expelled; whilst Sismondi, enamoured of nominal republics, is\r\never ready to echo taunts or calumnies pointed at an Italian prince.\r\nThe examination of many less popular historians, and of numerous\r\nunpublished contemporary authorities, has, we trust, enabled us to\r\nplace this Duke's character and conduct in a more true light, without\r\nextenuating the manifest errors of either.\r\n\r\nThough small in person, Francesco Maria was active and well formed,\r\nwith a manly air, a quick eye, and an engaging presence. His manner\r\nand address were mild and pleasing, and his conversation was seasoned\r\nwith lively jests. He was strict in religious observances, an enemy\r\nto blasphemous language, and intolerant of those insults to female\r\nhonour with which war was then lamentably fraught. In the regulation\r\nof his army, as in the government of his state, justice was his\r\nruling principle. Of his unhappy violence of temper we have already\r\nhad too much reason to speak; it was the bane of his life, the blot\r\non his fame. Yet he was generous and forgiving, as he proved by\r\nputting his personal enemy Guicciardini on his guard against the\r\ndesigns of San Severino, Count of Caiazzo, who, having suffered from\r\nthe Florentine's captious allegations, had resolved to assassinate\r\nhim.[38]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: LEONI, p. 386.]\r\n\r\nA soldier by education, taste, and long habit, his character should\r\nbe judged by a military standard; and perhaps the best tribute to his\r\nglory consisted in the public rejoicings ordered by Sultan Solyman\r\non hearing of his untimely death. In following the narrative of his\r\ncampaigns, we have unsparingly pointed out the faults which seemed\r\nto cramp his success. They were obviously systematic, arising from\r\nan excess of that caution, which his natural prudence and foresight\r\nprompted, and which the examples of Fabius Maximus and Prospero\r\nColonna in some degree authorised. Yet we must not overlook an\r\nimportant element of consideration, in the quality of troops under\r\nhis command from 1523 to 1528. His want of confidence in them was\r\navowed, and in more than one instance it was justified, when their\r\nsteadiness was put to the test. Nor was he less fettered by the\r\nfaulty organisation of that army, made up of various contingents\r\nunder their respective leaders, without a responsible commanding\r\nofficer, and in which civilians were allowed a veto fatal to unity of\r\naction. The verdict of his contemporaries may, however, be admitted\r\nas conclusive upon his military reputation. Ruscelli tells us that\r\nhe was, by common consent, called the father and founder of the art\r\nof war, as practised in the sixteenth century; and the opinion of\r\nthe only dissentient, Guicciardini, a private enemy and no soldier,\r\nis amply balanced by that of Giovanni de' Medici, who ranked him in\r\nskilful tactics, and in the arts of command, as well as in foresight\r\nand activity, equal to the ablest generals. The testimony of Charles\r\nV. has been already given; and we are assured that after a public\r\ndisputation in Padua, sustained by men of the greatest learning, he\r\nwas voted a match to any hero of antiquity, in judgment, experience,\r\ningenuity, and military talent. Promis, with assuredly no friendly\r\nleaning, admits his great skill in military architecture, stating\r\nthat he was often consulted by the principal engineers of Italy, and\r\nespecially by Sanmichele, upon the fortifications of Corfu, regarding\r\nwhich that author attributes to him a Report to the Signory of Rome,\r\nnow in the Ambrosian Library of Milan.[39] His opinion as to the\r\ndefences of their lagoons, and principal garrisons on terra-firma,\r\nwas, on various occasions, requested by that Republic, and during his\r\ncommand in Lombardy the towns of Lodi, Crema, Bergamo, Martinengo,\r\nand Orcinovo were all strengthened after his designs. Tartagli and\r\nContriotto acknowledged their obligations to his suggestions; but\r\nPromis denies him the invention of baloards, as we have already\r\nseen, when writing of Francesco di Giorgio. The school of military\r\nengineering formed under his eye, during almost continual campaigns,\r\nnumbered many distinguished professors of that art, among whom were\r\nPietro Luigi Escriva, Gianbattista Bellucci, Nicolò Tartaglia,\r\nGirolamo Genga, Gian Giacomo Leonardi, and Jacopo Fusto Castriotto,\r\nthe last three of whom were natives of his state.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: _Trattato di Architettura di Francesco di Giorgio_,\r\nvol. II., p. 67. (Turin, 1841.)]\r\n\r\nBut let us hear the evidence of contemporaries as to his character.\r\nUrbano Urbani, then his private secretary, thus describes him on\r\nsucceeding to the dukedom:--\"He was naturally low in stature, but\r\nwell-proportioned, and of fine complexion. The short distance from\r\nhis heart to his brain rendered his disposition choleric. Ever in\r\nmovement, he was impatient of repose. Thoughtful, his ideas and\r\ndiscourse tended to lofty themes. Ready of hand, he dexterously\r\nmanaged, on horseback or afoot, the arms then in use. Of high\r\ncourage, he invariably bent his mind to objects conducive to his\r\nhonour and renown, especially in war. He was just, honest, averse\r\nto swearing, liberal, incorruptible, and no boaster. He loathed\r\nincontinence, and youthful excesses. In his household he was fond of\r\nsplendour, and he generally entertained, in his almost regal court,\r\na large attendance of distinguished gentlemen, such as Ottaviano\r\nFregoso, Ludovico Pio, Gaspare Pallavicino, Giuliano de' Medici,\r\nPietro Bembo, Baldassare Castiglione, Cesare Gonzaga (all of whom had\r\nbeen attached to his uncle Guidobaldo), Ambrogio Landriano, Febo da\r\nCevi and his brother Gherardino, Filippino Doria, Benedetto Giraldi,\r\nand others conspicuous in arms, letters, or music; among whom Baldi\r\nnames also Matteo della Branca, Carlo Gabrielli, Father Andreoni,\r\nTroiano and Gentile Carbonani, Count Gentile Ubaldini.\"[40]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 489, f. 61. See for many of these,\r\nvol. II.]\r\n\r\nHad his lot been cast in less turbulent times, it would have been\r\nhis pride to maintain about him this goodly company, although he\r\npretended not to his predecessor's literary tastes, and, if we may\r\ncredit Sanuto, was unable to follow an oration delivered in Latin,\r\non his arrival at Venice, in 1524. Yet, he was not indifferent\r\nto letters when connected with the engrossing occupation of his\r\nmind; and it was his habit, when time permitted, to have passages\r\nof ancient history read to him during several hours a day.\r\nThis relaxation was varied by discussions arising out of these\r\nprelections, which he generally directed to military points, drawing\r\nout the opinions of his officers in attendance. Hence probably were\r\nsuggested the Military Discourses, published in his name, of which we\r\nhave already spoken; and various memorials of his conversation are\r\npreserved in a manuscript, which has supplied us with the anecdotes\r\nformerly quoted.[41] These were selected as illustrative of manners,\r\nfrom notes apparently made by a bystander; the others are almost\r\nexclusively upon military tactics and fortification, in which he was\r\nquite an adept.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: See Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 1023, art. 21.]\r\n\r\nLeonardi[42] confirms what we have stated of his character, dwelling\r\nmuch on his tendency to practical views. The sketch of Cristofero\r\nCentenelli must close these remarks:--\"Though considered somewhat\r\noverbearing and hasty, he was at all times just. Even in youth,\r\nhe was singularly self-denying of personal indulgences: guarding\r\nhimself from the temptations of luxury and indolence, he sought daily\r\noccupation in the practice of arms, athletic sports, and equestrian\r\nexercises. He was liberal and magnificent, but grave and magnanimous;\r\nkind and affable to his friends, equitable and compassionate to\r\nhis subjects. His courage was fiery and indomitable; of cold and\r\nheat, fatigue, watching, and privation, he was most enduring. He\r\ncombined, to a rare degree, boldness in the field with prudence in\r\nthe council-room, avoiding equally their extremes of temerity and\r\ntimidity. To great skill in military discipline, he united uncommon\r\nperspicacity in discovering the snares of seeming friends or of open\r\nfoes: astute with enemies, he was guarded with all. His eloquence\r\ncommanded general admiration by its studied brevity, expressing the\r\nclearest views in fewest words.\"[43]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 1023, f. 85.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: _Ibid._ No. 907.]\r\n\r\nThe Duke's constant and dutiful affection to his predecessor's\r\nwidow deserves special notice. While she lived she shared his home,\r\nin prosperity or adversity, in sovereignty or in exile; and he\r\noccasionally availed himself of her prudence and popularity in the\r\nadministration of the state during his absences. An interesting\r\nmemorial of this filial affection is afforded by the following\r\nletter, which seems to have been written by Duchess Elisabetta.\r\n\r\n     \"To the most illustrious Lord, my most esteemed Son, the\r\n     Duke of Urbino, &c.\r\n\r\n     \"The chair is so beautiful that neither words nor pen\r\n     suffice to express my thanks for this proof of regard;\r\n     but most heartily, and with all the good will it merits,\r\n     I accept so handsome and gallant a gift, and I shall use\r\n     it for your sake as long as God pleases: it is not less\r\n     beautiful than dear to me. I have seen the news sent by the\r\n     Count: he would have done better to sacrifice something\r\n     than to lose all by his imprisonment. We expect you in the\r\n     morning. The Duchess kisses your hands and your mouth, and\r\n     I commend myself to you with eternal thanks.\r\n\r\n     \"YOUR MOTHER.\r\n\r\n     \"The 8th of August.\"[44]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: Oliveriana MSS. No. 375. This may, however, have been\r\naddressed by Duchess Vittoria to Francesco Maria II.]\r\n\r\nThe widowed Duchess Leonora remained at Pesaro, stricken with grief,\r\nfrom which she slowly recovered to find a solace in her children.\r\nBy her husband's will she had 28,000 scudi, besides the life-rent\r\nof his Neapolitan fiefs at Sora, which were left in remainder to\r\ntheir younger son Giulio. To each of the daughters were provided\r\n20,000 scudi. She died at Gubbio, in 1543. Her devoted affection to\r\nher husband was accompanied by much sterling worth of character;\r\nbut she was especially distinguished for that equanimity of temper\r\nwhich marks the expression of her admirable portrait in the Florence\r\nGallery.\r\n\r\nThe children of Francesco Maria were these:--\r\n\r\n     1. FEDERIGO, born in March, 1511, and died young.\r\n\r\n     2. GUIDOBALDO, his successor, born 2nd April, 1514.\r\n\r\n     3. IPPOLITA, married in 1531, to Don Antonio\r\n     d'Aragona, son of the Duke of Montalto, in Naples.\r\n\r\n     4. GIULIA, married in 1548, to Alfonso d'Este,\r\n     Marquis of Montechio, son of Duke Alfonso I. From her\r\n     descend the sovereign Dukes of Modena and Reggio.\r\n\r\n     5. ELISABETTA, married in 1552, to Alberico Cibò,\r\n     Marquis of Massa, and died in 1561. From her descended the\r\n     sovereign Dukes of Massa Carrara.\r\n\r\n     6. GIULIO, who was born at Mantua on the 8th of\r\n     April, and created by his father Duke of Sora. He was\r\n     educated for the Church, where his talents and application\r\n     to business merited the shower of preferments which his\r\n     high birth insured him, and which began by his nomination\r\n     as Cardinal of S. Pietro in Vinculis by Paul III., when\r\n     fourteen years of age. In 1548 he was made Bishop of\r\n     Urbino, a dignity which he resigned three years later, on\r\n     being appointed Legate of Rieti and Terni. In 1560 he had\r\n     the see of Vicenza, but soon exchanged it for Recanati.\r\n     In 1565, he was promoted to be Archbishop of Ravenna, to\r\n     which was added, in 1570, the see of Tusculum; and, in\r\n     1578, when within a few months of his death, he became\r\n     Archbishop of Urbino, having for some years previously\r\n     been Legate of Umbria, and governor of Loreto. In these\r\n     high posts he united to excellent business habits, and\r\n     great energy in the discharge of his duties, a taste for\r\n     magnificence, which made him popular with all classes. By\r\n     his own family he was regarded as a valuable counsellor in\r\n     every difficulty, and he greatly promoted the government\r\n     of his brother and nephew, to whom he served as a sort of\r\n     prime minister. His career of honour and utility was closed\r\n     by a premature death, on the 5th September, 1578, when but\r\n     forty-three years of age. Under his superintendence was\r\n     drawn up a code of Regulations [_Riformazioni_] of Justice,\r\n     which was published with his name in 1549. It does not\r\n     appear in what way the dukedom of Sora and Arci passed\r\n     from him, but, before the end of the century, it had been\r\n     granted by Philip II. to Giacomo Boncompagno, natural son\r\n     of Pope Gregory XIII. From his descendants, the Princes of\r\n     Piombino, that fief passed, about the end of last century,\r\n     to the Neapolitan government; and its picturesque baronial\r\n     towers at Isola, once the scene of their festive revels,\r\n     are now degraded into a woollen factory. The Cardinal left\r\n     two natural sons, who were both legitimated by Pius V.:--\r\n\r\n          1. Ippolito della Rovere, who had from his father\r\n          San Lorenzo and Castel Leone above Sinigaglia, and\r\n          was made Marquis of San Lorenzo in 1584, on his\r\n          marriage with Isabella, daughter of Giacomo Vitelli\r\n          dell'Amatrice, with 30,000 scudi of dowry. He had\r\n          issue, 1. Giulio, who was disinherited for bad\r\n          conduct; 2. Livia, born 1585, who became Duchess\r\n          of Urbino in 1599; 3. Lucrezia, who married the\r\n          Marchese Marc Antonio Lanti, and had issue.\r\n\r\n          2. Giuliano, Prior of Corinaldo, and Abbot of San\r\n          Lorenzo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK SEVENTH\r\n\r\nOF GUIDOBALDO DELLA ROVERE FIFTH DUKE OF URBINO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\n     Succession of Duke Guidobaldo II.--He loses Camerino and\r\n     the Prefecture of Rome--The altered state of Italy--Death\r\n     of Duchess Giulia--The Duke's remarriage--Affairs of the\r\n     Farnesi.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe course of our narrative seems to offer a not altogether fanciful\r\nanalogy to that of the Tiber. Issuing from the rugged Apennines,\r\nthis, with puny rill, is gradually recruited from their many valleys\r\nuntil it has gained the force and energy of a brawling torrent, and\r\nhas absorbed a goodly portion of the Umbrian waters. So, too, the\r\nformer has brought us past scenes of martial prowess and creations\r\nof mediæval policy. It has afforded us glimpses of townships where\r\ncivil institutions revived, and letters were cherished, the petty\r\ncapitals from whose courts civilisation was diffused. Carrying us\r\nacross the blood-watered and time-defaced Campagna, it has conducted\r\nus to Rome at the moment of her lamentable sack by barbarian hordes.\r\nHenceforward our history, like the river, will decline in interest.\r\nThe sluggish and turbid stream has little to enliven that dreary and\r\ndegenerate land through which it must still conduct us. This contrast\r\nwill be especially irksome in the life of Duke Guidobaldo II., who\r\nkept much aloof from the few events of stirring interest which then\r\noccurred in the Peninsula. We shall therefore hasten over it, in the\r\nhope that those who favour us with their company may find, in the\r\nincidents of his successor, a somewhat renovated interest, and may\r\nbe gratified to learn by what means our mountain duchy came to be\r\nfinally absorbed in the papal dominions, just as the tawny river is\r\nlost in the pathless sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FACSIMILES OF SIGNATURES]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe birthday of Guidobaldo II. has been variously stated; most\r\nauthorities fix it on the 2nd of April, 1514, although the customary\r\ndonative appears from an old chronicle to have been voted by the\r\nmunicipality of Urbino on the 17th of March. The Prince saw the light\r\nat a moment inauspicious for his dynasty. Under the fostering care of\r\nJulius II. it had attained its culminating point; and although his\r\nsuccessor still smiled upon the far-spreading oak of Umbria,[*45]\r\nthe intrigues of Leo X. were already preparing its overthrow. The\r\ninfant had scarcely passed his second year, when the ducal family\r\nwere driven from their states, and sought a friendly shelter at the\r\nMantuan capital. Before their five years of exile in Lombardy had\r\ngone by, Guidobaldo is said to have been sent to the university of\r\nPadua. His early education was committed to Guido Posthumo Silvestro,\r\nwho describes him as displaying, even in childhood, the spirit of his\r\nfather, and of his grand-uncle Julius II., whilst his mild temper\r\nand sweet expression were those of his mother.[46] The preceptor, a\r\nnative of Pesaro, was tempted by attachment to his early patrons,\r\nthe Sforza, to avenge them with his pen, on the invasion of the\r\nDuke Valentino, upon whom and whose race he charged, in some bitter\r\nlampoons mentioned by Roscoe, all those crimes which have become\r\nmatter of history. But years rendered him more pliant; for when\r\nanother revolution came round, the attentions he had met with at the\r\ncourt of Urbino did not prevent his resorting, on Duke Francesco\r\nMaria's exile, to the protection of Leo, or lavishing eulogy and\r\nflattery upon that Pontiff. At Rome, he enjoyed the consideration\r\nthere freely bestowed upon poets and wits, among whom Giovio assigns\r\nhim a conspicuous place; but the life of luxurious indulgence to\r\nwhich he was tempted having undermined his health, he died in 1521.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *45: The Rovere were anything but an Umbrian family, as we\r\nhave seen.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46:\r\n\r\n     \"Guidus Juliades, qui, quamquam mitis et ore\r\n     Blandus, ut ex vultu possis cognoscere matrem\r\n     Patrem animis tamen et primis patruum exprimit annis.\"\r\n\r\nSee as to Guido in ROSCOE'S _Leo X._, ch. xvii.]\r\n\r\nOur authorities, barren of interest for the domestic life of Duke\r\nFrancesco Maria,[*47] are altogether a blank as regards his children,\r\nand we know nothing of the Prince beyond the fact of his sharing his\r\nmother's virtual arrest at Venice in 1527. His early tastes seemed\r\nto have turned upon horses: in 1529, he ordered from Rome a set of\r\nhousings for his charger, with minute instructions accompanying the\r\npattern; ten years later, the Grand Duke Cosimo I. regretted his\r\ninability to find for him such horses as he had desired; and he\r\nappears to have paid 70 golden scudi for one from Naples. In 1843, I\r\nwas shown, at Pesaro, the wooden model of a beautiful little Arab,\r\nwhich had long been preserved in the Giordani family, covered with\r\nthe skin of his favourite charger, a fragment of which remained.\r\nWe have seen Guidobaldo complimented by Clement VII. in 1529,\r\nand in that year he had a condotta from Venice, for seventy-five\r\nmen-at-arms, and a hundred and fifty light horse, with 1000 ducats of\r\npay for himself, 100 for each man-at-arms, and 50 for each horseman.\r\nIn 1532, his father, on departing from Lombardy, left him regent\r\nof the duchy. The circumstances of his marriage, on the 12th of\r\nOctober, 1534, to Giulia Varana, then but eleven years of age, and\r\nher questionable succession to her paternal state of Camerino, have\r\nbeen fully detailed in our preceding chapter.[48] From 1534 till his\r\nfather's death, in 1538, he seems to have exercised the rights of\r\nsovereignty, with the title of Duke of Camerino, unchallenged by the\r\nPontiff, who had recalled his censures. But no sooner was Paul III.\r\nrelieved from the influential opposition of Francesco Maria, than his\r\ndesigns upon that principality were firmly carried out.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *47: For certain details of Court life, cf.

Dismounting in the palace-yard, he proceeded to the\r\nducal chamber, which, as well as the great hall, was hung with black.\r\nThere he dismissed the strangers to lodgings provided for them in\r\nthe town, and passed next day in grief and absolute seclusion along\r\nwith his consort, preparations being meanwhile made to traverse the\r\ncity.[49] Accordingly, on Saturday morning, mass of the Holy Spirit\r\nhaving been said by the Bishop of Cagli, who thereafter breakfasted\r\nin the palace, the citizens and populace crowded to the piazza,\r\nwhere the doctors and nobles assembled to accompany the priors.\r\nThither also came a hundred youths of good family, in doublets of\r\nsky-blue velvet, with gilt swords by their side, followed by a\r\nvast many children bearing olive-boughs. The new Duke having been\r\nmeanwhile dressed in white velvet and satin, with cap and plume of\r\nthe same colour, Captain-general Luc-Antonio Brancarini marshalled\r\nthe procession. The gonfaloniere marched first, in a jerkin of black\r\nvelvet under a long surcoat of black damask lined with crimson,\r\nbegirt with a gold-mounted sword; his cap on his head and his mace\r\nlowered. He was followed by the nobility, the doctors, and citizens;\r\nand on entering the palace they halted in the basement suite\r\ntowards the garden, which were all hung with tapestry, the windows\r\nof the great hall being occupied by the Duchess and her ladies in\r\nmagnificent attire. When all was ready, the Prince issued forth into\r\nthe Piazza, and advanced to the cathedral, followed by the officials\r\nand train. At the top of the steps he knelt on a rich carpet and\r\nbrocade cushions, whilst the bishop, chapter, and clergy came out,\r\nand with the usual ceremonies brought him into the church, and to\r\nthe high altar, before which other ceremonials were gone through,\r\nand he offered an oblation-coin of ten Mantuan ducats. Meanwhile his\r\ncharger was brought to the foot of the steps, covered to the neck\r\nwith a housing of silver tissue, and other trappings, including a\r\nwhite plume. It was led by seven lads of the chief Urbino families,\r\nBonaventura, Peruli, Passionei, Cornei, Corboli, and Muccioli, all\r\nrichly apparelled, and two of them holding goads. There was also a\r\nhorse for the Gonfaloniere with velvet harness, led by two lads.\r\nThe fore-mentioned hundred youths and numerous children having\r\nranged themselves around, the Prince and Gonfaloniere descended the\r\nsteps and mounted their steeds, and the latter, drawing his sword,\r\nproclaimed aloud 'THE DUKE, THE DUKE; FELTRO, FELTRO; GUIDOBALDO,\r\nGUIDOBALDO!' the cry being taken up and repeated by all. The cortège,\r\nmaking a circuit by Pian di Marcato, Valbona, Santa Lucia, and Santa\r\nChiara, returned to the palace, where the Duke dismounted. His\r\ncharger and mantle were then seized, as their perquisite, by the\r\nyouths, who, mounting one of their number, Antonio dei Galli, again\r\nwent through the city crying and making merry. The Duke, having taken\r\nhis seat with his consort, received the gonfaloniere, priors, and\r\ncitizens to kiss hands.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: _Correre la terra_ is the usual phrase for taking\r\nsovereign possession, like \"riding the marches\" of Scottish burghs.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\n? GUIDOBALDO II. DELLA ROVERE\r\n\r\n_From the picture by Titian in the Pitti Gallery, Florence_\r\n\r\n(_Probably once in the Ducal Collection_)]\r\n\r\n\"On the following morning, there came in envoys from various places\r\nto offer their condolence, wearing mourning robes that swept the\r\nground. The first who had audience were the gonfaloniere and priors\r\nof Urbino, and then those from San Marino. After breakfast, the other\r\ncommunities were admitted without order, in consequence of a wrangle\r\nfor precedence between Gubbio and Pesaro, Cagli and Fossombrone, and\r\nthis continued till seven o'clock in the evening. Next Monday being\r\nthe festival of San Simone, the oath of allegiance was administered\r\non Tuesday. A stage covered with black was erected between the two\r\nwindows of the great hall, on which stood a bench with a coverlet of\r\nblack velvet, and thereon an open missal, with a miniature of the\r\ncrucifixion. After breakfasting, the Duke seated himself on this\r\nstage, with Messer Stefano, one of the judges; and the deputies from\r\ncommunes being assembled, with their commissions in their hands,\r\nMesser Stefano called upon the magistrates of Urbino with about a\r\nhundred of the citizens, desiring them to swear fidelity, as was\r\nright and customary, which they did, formally placing their hands on\r\nthe crucifixion. Thereafter, the envoys of other communities were\r\nbrought up and sworn; but on account of the aforesaid wrangling,\r\nthose of Pesaro, Sinigaglia, Fossombrone, and Cagli were sent back\r\nto take the oaths at home. Next day, however, on their humble\r\npetition, those of Cagli and Fossombrone were received, along with\r\nsome other highland deputies who had come in late; but Pesaro,\r\nSinigaglia, and the vicariat, took the oaths before the vice-dukes\r\nin their respective cities. On the following Tuesday, there arrived\r\nfour envoys from Fano, and two from Città di Castello, to offer\r\ncondolence, who were honourably received; and next day came those\r\nof Camerino and Rimini, men of high station. On Thursday, Messer\r\nQuaglino, ambassador from the Duke of Ferrara, dismounted at Pesaro,\r\nto condole with the dowager Duchess, and thence proceeded with a\r\nsuite of five to Urbino, where he was lodged for three days in\r\nthe Passionei Palace, and had audience. At the same time, the like\r\nformalities were discharged by Vicenzo Schippo, who came with an\r\nescort of ten, as representative of the Duke of Mantua. On Sunday,\r\ndeputations from all parts of the duchy went to offer their duty at\r\nPesaro to the widowed Duchess.\"\r\n\r\nThe smouldering embers of the Camerino quarrel soon burst forth,\r\nwhen Paul III. found that the Emperor's influence and the arms of\r\nVenice were no longer arrayed against his grasping pretensions, and\r\nthat the weight of the struggle had devolved from a renowned warrior\r\nto an untried youth. In order to supplement the legal deficiencies\r\nof his case, the Pontiff had in 1537 conferred certain estates upon\r\nErcole Varana, on condition of his claims upon the succession of\r\nCamerino being assigned to his own grandson Ottavio Farnese; but\r\nthe death of Francesco Maria having released him from the necessity\r\nof temporising, he at once sent a body of troops into that duchy,\r\nunder Stefano Colonna or Alessandro Vitelli. The young Duke, relying\r\non the support of Venice and the Medici, was at first disposed to\r\nresist, but finding himself deserted, soon abandoned the idea. He\r\nhad in the history of his family too many examples of the perils of\r\npapal nepotism; and it was obvious that the times were past when\r\nchurch feudatories had anything to hope from single-handed contests\r\nwith their over-lord. In the certainty that to provoke this would\r\nbe to hazard all, he made up his mind to an unwilling compromise,\r\nsurrendering his wife's rights to Camerino for a full investiture\r\nof his own dukedom, and the sum of 78,000 golden scudi as a poor\r\ncompensation for her inheritance. This transaction was completed on\r\nthe 8th of January, 1539; nor was it the only mortification he was\r\ndestined to undergo from the ambition of the Farnesi. The Prefecture\r\nof Rome, although held by his father and grandfather, was a personal\r\ndignity at the disposal of the new Pope, who conferred it upon\r\nhis own grandson Ottavio. In the end of 1538, he also married that\r\nyouth, then but fifteen, to Margaret of Austria, natural daughter\r\nof Charles V. and widow of Duke Alessandro de' Medici, who had been\r\nslain by his cousin Lorenzino, within a year after his marriage. That\r\nimperious dame, who brought Ottavio a handsome dower in lands about\r\nOrtona on the Adriatic, wrought upon the weakness of Paul, until in\r\n1545, she obtained for her husband's father, Pier-Luigi, natural son\r\nof his Holiness, the sovereign duchy of Parma and Piacenza. In order\r\nto put a gloss upon this dismemberment of the ecclesiastical states,\r\nand to accommodate the whole arrangement to the modified nepotism\r\nof his age, the Pontiff stipulated for a resurrender by Ottavio to\r\nthe Holy See of Camerino and Nepi. These remained part of the papal\r\ntemporalities, whilst their Lombard duchy gave to the Farnese family\r\nan important position among the sovereign houses of Europe.\r\n\r\nAlthough the altered circumstances of Italy which humbled her\r\npride had also arrested her convulsions, these untoward events,\r\nat the outset of his reign, proved to Guidobaldo that her few\r\nremaining principalities were far from secure. To strengthen his\r\nposition became therefore a natural policy; and although neither\r\nthe Emperor nor the Venetian Signory had lent a willing ear to his\r\nrepresentations on the subject of Camerino, he sent to remind the\r\nformer of his promise to give him a company of men-at-arms, whilst,\r\nwith the Pope's permission, he accepted from the latter a two years'\r\nengagement. The terms of this condotta, which was dated in 1539,\r\nand continued in force until 1552, were one hundred men-at-arms and\r\nas many light cavalry, with 4000 ducats of _piatto_ or yearly pay,\r\nand an obligation to have in readiness ten of his father's veteran\r\ncaptains, whose monthly pay was fixed at 15 scudi in peace, and 25 in\r\nwar. Four years later he was requested by the Republic to serve them\r\nin another capacity, by complimenting Charles V. in their name on his\r\npassage into Germany, on which occasion he was accompanied by the\r\nvile sycophant Pietro Aretino.\r\n\r\nIn our fourteenth chapter, we had occasion to consider the change\r\nwhich military affairs underwent in Italy about the time of the\r\nfirst French invasion, and we have seen in Duke Federigo of Urbino\r\none of the last condottieri of the old sort. But it was not until\r\nthe fall of Rome and Florence had extinguished Italian independence,\r\nthat military adventure was entirely abolished; and it is curious\r\nto find in his grandson Duke Francesco Maria I., not only the\r\nlatest captain who gathered laurels under that system, but to see\r\nhim joining with the Pope and the Medici to exterminate those armed\r\nhordes which survived its mercenary armaments, and which, like the\r\nrestless spirits of a departed generation, troubled the repose of\r\ntheir degenerate sons.[50] Their occupation was indeed gone. Tamed\r\nby invaders whom they were powerless to resist, domestic broils no\r\nlonger demanded their services. Their forays were become intolerable\r\nin a land where peace was the price of freedom. How far the earlier\r\nadoption of Machiavelli's plans of defence might have availed against\r\nultramontane hosts were now a vain speculation; they were only\r\ndestined for trial after the sacrifice had been consummated. The\r\nnational militia suggested by him was not enrolled until there was no\r\nlonger a nationality to defend--until it was needed but as an armed\r\npolice under foreign control.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: RICOTTI, IV., p. 129, quoting Adriani Storie, lib. II.]\r\n\r\nThis new force had been embodied in our duchy under the name of the\r\nFeltrian Legion, by a proclamation dated 1st of March, 1533, and it\r\nso fully satisfied the late Duke's expectations that he gradually\r\nincreased his militia to five thousand men in four regiments. Such\r\nwas the description of troops which henceforward maintained order at\r\nUrbino, or were subsidised on foreign service. But their sinews,\r\nhardened by a rude climate and rugged homes, maintained for them the\r\nreputation gained by their ancestors; and although Duke Guidobaldo\r\nII. lived in quiet times, and pretended to no heroic aspirations,\r\nwe find him accepting of commands offered chiefly for the sake of\r\nsecuring his hardy mountaineers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe abject position in which Italy was left after the wars of Clement\r\nVII. has already been noticed. Her internal conflicts were at an end.\r\nOf those states whose struggles for independence or for mastery had\r\nduring long ages convulsed her, the lesser had been absorbed by the\r\nmore powerful, and these in their turn had bowed to foreign dominion\r\nor foreign influence. She was tranquillised but trodden down,\r\npacified but prostrate. Her history became but a series of episodes\r\nin the annals of ultramontane nations, on whom her few remaining\r\nprinces and commonwealths grew into dependent satellites. Even the\r\npopes, no longer arbiters of European policy, sought a reflected\r\nconsequence by attaching themselves to the interests of France,\r\nSpain, or the Empire. Nor were they losers by the change to the same\r\ndegree as other Peninsular powers. The papacy was indeed shorn in\r\npart of its temporal lustre. It no longer directed the diplomacy of\r\nChristendom, nor did it waste its resources upon bloody and bootless\r\ncampaigns. But as its energies were gradually weaned from general\r\npolitics, they became more concentrated upon ecclesiastical affairs.\r\nThe small speck on the horizon towards which Leo X. had scarcely\r\ndirected a look or an anxiety, was now rapidly overspreading the sky,\r\nand already excluded the rays of Catholicism from a large portion of\r\nCentral Europe. His successors, threatened with the loss of spiritual\r\nas well as temporal ascendancy, had the wisdom to make a stand for\r\nmaintenance of the former, leaving the latter to its fate. The\r\nspirit of popery from aggressive became conservative; its military\r\ntactics gave place to theological weapons. It was by Paul III. that\r\na vigorous opposition was first made to the Reformation, the primary\r\nsteps taken towards that Catholic reaction, which Paul IV. and Pius\r\nV. afterwards so successfully promoted, as not only to check the\r\nrapid progress of Protestantism, but to regain a portion of the lost\r\nground. Seconding the zeal of the old monastic orders, which had\r\nbeen revived in the Theatines,[*51] he, in 1540, recruited to it the\r\ncold clear-sighted cunning of the Jesuits. Two years afterwards he\r\nre-established the Inquisition,[*52] and in 1545 opened the Council\r\nof Trent, whose sittings were not finally closed until eighteen years\r\nlater, when it had completed that bulwark which still constitutes a\r\nstronghold of the Roman church. Extirpation of heresy henceforward\r\nbecame the pervading principle of the papacy, and the engrossing\r\ndogma of its zealots; the object for which councils deliberated,\r\npontiffs admonished, legates intrigued. For an end so sanctified no\r\nmeans were accounted base. When argument failed threats were at hand.\r\nFrom reason an appeal lay to the rack. Thus was the wavering power of\r\nthe Keys restored or confirmed over much of Europe, and an alliance\r\nwas effected between political and spiritual despotism for their\r\nmutual maintenance and common defence. The success which crowned\r\nthese new efforts far exceeded any that mere mundane aims had ever\r\nattained. The re-influx of Catholicism was in some instances more\r\nsignal, as it was more inexplicable, than had been the recent spread\r\nof the Reformation.[*53] Although fatal to freedom of thought, its\r\ninfluence proved highly favourable to morals. The revival of religion\r\nwas attended with a happy reformation of manners, after examples\r\nemanating from high places. The sins, or at least the scenes, that\r\nhad disgraced the Borgian and Medicean courts no longer met the eye,\r\nbut were replaced by a semblance of ascetic virtue. The new religious\r\norders, being of more rigid rule, tended by precept and example to\r\nrestore discipline, and to purify, at least externally, the cup and\r\nthe platter. Prelatic luxury was curtailed, brazen vice retired from\r\npublic view, and the free exercise of papal nepotism was finally\r\nrestrained by Pius V., who, in 1567, prohibited the alienation by his\r\nsuccessors of church property or jurisdictions. But in these themes\r\nour narrative has no part. The battles of orthodoxy were chiefly\r\nfought beyond the Alps; the reformed morality of the papal court was\r\nexampled in its own capital: in neither had Urbino any near interest.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *51: The Theatines were a congregation of Clerks Regular,\r\nfounded by Gaetano Tiene, a Venetian nobleman, in 1524. They are\r\nunder the rule of S. Augustin. S. Gaetano Tiene died in 1547. In 1526\r\nMatteo di Basso of Urbino founded a reform of Franciscan Observants,\r\ngiving his followers a long-pointed hood, which he believed to be\r\nof the same shape as that worn by S. Francis. These friars became\r\nknown as Cappuccini or Capuchins. At first they were merely a company\r\nof hermits devoted to the contemplative life. They remained, in\r\nfact, under the Observants till 1617. They are now a separate order\r\ngoverned by a general. They live in absolute poverty.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *52: The Inquisition was revived by a Bull of Sixtus IV.\r\nin 1478. Two years later it was reinstated in Spain by the Catholic\r\nkings. In 1526 it was established in Portugal; but it was only\r\nintroduced into Italy in 1546, at Naples, and came into Central Italy\r\nonly with many restrictions.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *53: It might seem that those parts of Europe securely\r\nwithin the Roman Empire of antiquity eventually remained Catholic.]\r\n\r\nGuidobaldo's condotta from the Signory being renewed in 1546 upon\r\nmore favourable terms (namely, 15,000 scudi of pay for his company,\r\nand 5000 of _piatto_ for himself), he was invested about midsummer,\r\nby an imposing ceremonial pompously described in the letter of an\r\neye-witness among the archives of Urbino. His jewelled cap and\r\ndiamond collar are mentioned as superb, and his sword is valued at\r\n700 scudi. After high mass in St. Mark's, the great standard being\r\nunfurled and supported by three bearers, and the baton of wrought\r\nsilver placed in his hands, the Doge thus addressed him: \"Lord Duke,\r\nwe presented to your Excellency this standard of our St. Mark the\r\nEvangelist, in the wonted form, and in token of supremacy; and we\r\npray the Lord our God that it tend to the weal and service of all\r\nChristendom, but especially to the defence of this state. We give\r\nit to your Excellency, confiding in your loyalty and prudence, well\r\nassured that you will use it with courage and faith conformable to\r\nyour deserts. And we hand to your Excellency the baton, therewith\r\ndesigning you head and governor of our forces, and transferring\r\nto you the obedience of all our military: it is our will that you\r\nbe obeyed, honoured, and respected by our several condottieri and\r\nsoldiery, as representing our Signory itself. May it please the\r\nDivine Majesty that all be well ordered, to the well-being and\r\nfurtherance of the Christian community, and of this our serene\r\nRepublic.\" The Duke replied, \"I most willingly accept, most Serene\r\nPrince, the distinction granted me by your Serenity, and with\r\nthe sure hope of maintaining the good opinion you repose in me,\r\nwhich shall be nowise disappointed. I shall ever pray our Lord God\r\ngraciously to vouchsafe me an early occasion of honourably serving\r\nyour serene government, that I may thereby prove my good will. And I\r\nfeel sure that your Serenity will have cause to be well satisfied at\r\ngiving me this rank, which, without reserve of life or fortune, like\r\none aware of his obligation to your Serenity, it will be my care so\r\nto hold as to augment my claims upon your favour.\" The function being\r\nover, the Duke was escorted by an imposing military pageant to his\r\npalace, where a splendid banquet was set out, of which, however, the\r\njealous regulations of the Republic did not permit her officials to\r\npartake.\r\n\r\nThe court having gone to spend Christmas of 1547 in the mild climate\r\nof Fossombrone, the Duke, in January, 1548, again repaired to\r\nVenice, intending to return home for carnival. On the frontier he\r\nwas met by news of his consort's serious illness, and immediately\r\nsent expresses to summon from Padua and Ferrara, Frigimiliza and\r\nBrasavolo, two famous physicians. Under them and her own doctors, the\r\nDuchess rallied for a time, but died on the 17th of February,--\"a\r\nvery religious, charitable, and lettered lady, and a great loss to\r\nthe state.\" Her body was borne by torchlight to Urbino with the\r\nusual solemnities, and, after lying in state, was entombed in Santa\r\nChiara on the 19th. The funeral service was performed at Urbino the\r\n24th of March, with due pomp, and a ceremonial preserved by Tondini.\r\nThe procession consisted of the Duchess's household, twenty-two in\r\nnumber, with thirty-nine of the Duke's; Guidobaldo and his brother;\r\nthe ambassadors of five friendly states; twenty-two principal\r\nnobility of the duchy; forty captains; the municipality of Urbino,\r\nwith seventy leading citizens; deputies from thirty-six other towns;\r\nin all, about three hundred and sixty persons. The obsequies were\r\ncelebrated in the cathedral, which was illuminated by a hundred and\r\neighty-six wax lights of four pounds each, and above two hundred\r\ntorches. The funeral oration was pronounced by Sperone Speroni, and\r\nis published among his works.\r\n\r\nAlthough, in somewhat startling contrast to these details of death,\r\nwe here introduce a letter written by the Duchess, which may interest\r\nour lady readers. It is addressed to Marchetti, her steward of the\r\nhousehold, then at Venice, and is printed in his life by Tondini:--\r\n\r\n     \"Master Steward, our well-beloved,\r\n\r\n     \"This is to inform you that, on your return with his\r\n     Excellency, our Lord and Consort, you must by all means\r\n     bring as much of the finest and most beautiful scarlet\r\n     serge, such as is made on purpose for the cardinals, as\r\n     may suffice to make us a petticoat, taking care that it be\r\n     at once handsome, good, and _distingué_. You can ascertain\r\n     the necessary quantity. Here they tell us that if the stuff\r\n     be two _braccie_ [a yard and a quarter] wide, at least\r\n     eight _braccie_ will be required, and more if narrower, say\r\n     nine or ten. See that you get full measure, and let the\r\n     quantity be ample rather than deficient, so that we may not\r\n     have to mar it for want of cloth. And if you cannot find\r\n     such serge, bring some beautiful, good, and thin Venice\r\n     cloth, being careful that it be light in texture, and that\r\n     the colour be of the most bright and lively scarlet that\r\n     can be found. Use all diligence that we be well suited and\r\n     satisfied, if you would do us a grateful service. Bring\r\n     also some of those books and rosettes, as they are called,\r\n     which are commonly made there of thin white wax tapers;\r\n     and so good health to you. From Fossombrone, the 6th of\r\n     October, 1541.\r\n\r\n     \"JULIA DUCHESS OF URBINO.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duchess had given birth to a son in 1544, but was survived only\r\nby a daughter Virginia: her marriage had been interested, and her\r\nlord lost no time in contracting another from similar motives, on\r\nthe excuse of requiring a male heir. In August he went to kiss the\r\nPope's feet at Rome, on occasion of negotiating a new matrimonial\r\nalliance with his granddaughter, Vittoria Farnese. On the 30th he\r\nreturned home, and next month again met his Holiness at Perugia.\r\nThe nuptials were interrupted by the assassination of the bride's\r\nfather, Duke Pier-Luigi, whose son had supplanted Guidobaldo at\r\nCamerino, and whose tyranny in his new state of Parma sharpened the\r\ndaggers of his outraged nobles. The ceremony, however, took place on\r\nthe 30th of January, 1548, when Vittoria, who had been previously\r\naffianced to Duke Cosimo I., was twenty-eight years of age. On the\r\n2nd of February she visited Urbino, amid many demonstrations of\r\nrespect, among which was a muster of forty lads in her livery of\r\nyellow velvet, to each of whom an allowance of seven scudi had been\r\nvoted by the city; but it was the Duke's pleasure that they should\r\npay for their own dress. Art, too, had contributed its honours,\r\nand Vasari narrates how Battista Franco aided in decorating the\r\ntriumphal arches designed by Girolamo Genga for her reception.\r\nSimilar welcome was given her at Gubbio, where the youths wore purple\r\nvelvet with white sleeves and white lilies.[*54] Coincident with,\r\nand in consequence of, this marriage, the Duke received from Paul a\r\nnew investiture of his states, and a cardinal's hat, with the title\r\nof S. Pietro in Vinculis, for his brother Giulio, who, though but in\r\nhis fifteenth year, was soon after named Legate of Perugia. On the\r\n20th of February, 1549, there was born a prince, who succeeded to the\r\ndukedom as Francesco Maria II., and the grateful people manifested\r\ntheir loyalty by customary congratulations and donatives.[55] These\r\nhappy events were, ere long, interrupted by the death of Paul III.\r\non the 10th of November, followed by that of the dowager Duchess of\r\nUrbino, on the 14th of February, thereafter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *54: Cf. PELLEGRINI, _Gubbio sotto i Conti e Duchi\r\nd'Urbino_ in _Bolletino per l'Umbria_ (Perugia, 1905), vol. XI., p.\r\n236 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 934, is an elaborate exposition of\r\nthe devices and mottoes displayed on this august occasion.]\r\n\r\nThe little state of San Marino forms a solecism in the polity of\r\nEurope, having preserved its petty limits and its purely popular\r\ngovernment during many centuries, whilst all the other republics\r\nof Italy successfully yielded to personal ambition or foreign\r\nconquest.[*56] For its independence during the ceaseless changes\r\nof the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it was debtor to the\r\nDukes of Urbino, whose aid was ever at hand when their name proved\r\nan inadequate safeguard. The nature of the protection which they\r\naccorded to that republic is shown in the subjoined document, which\r\nseems worthy of insertion from its resemblance to those letters of\r\nmaintenance usually granted about the same period by the greater\r\nbarons of Scotland, in favour of less powerful neighbours and\r\nfriends, among the minor nobility, and even the burgh communities.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *56: Cf. FATTORI, _Delle cause che hanno conservata la\r\nRepubblica di S. Marino_ (Bologna, 1887).]\r\n\r\n\"Protection under which, at the instance of the Liberty of S.\r\nMarino, pressed by its envoys, the Lord Duke Guidobaldo II. assumes\r\nthe aforesaid Liberty, its men and territory, following therein in\r\nthis the course adopted by Duke Federico, Guido I., Francesco Maria\r\nhis father, and others of his house: promising to the best of his\r\nability, and at all times, to defend, protect, and guard it against\r\nall persons whatsoever who may seek or wish to injure it, whether in\r\nrespect to its possessions, subjects, state, or pre-eminence, holding\r\nits enemies for his enemies, and its allies for his allies; and\r\nfurther, undertaking to accord to it all possible aid and favour in\r\nthe maintenance of its independence and freedom: the said envoys, on\r\nthe other part, obliging themselves to the Lord Duke, in name of the\r\nforesaid, with all their exertion and power to assist, uphold, and\r\npreserve the subjects, state, honours, and dignity of the said Lord\r\nDuke, against whatsoever person, state, or potentate who may make\r\nattempts against him; promising to hold the friends of his Excellency\r\nas their friends, and his foes as their foes, and to pay him at\r\nall times the respect due to a faithful and good protector. At the\r\nrequisition of Ser Bartolo Nursino, 20th May, 1549.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Guidobaldo's policy to maintain with the Holy See those\r\namicable relations which his second marriage had established, and\r\nhe had accordingly, on the death of Paul III., sent some troops to\r\nPerugia, in order to secure the quiet succession of Julius III. This\r\nbeing effected, he went to Rome on a visit of congratulation to the\r\nnew Pontiff, accompanied by Aretino, whose venal appetites were ever\r\non the watch for opportunities of bringing his sycophancy to a good\r\nmarket. The Pope disappointed him of the anticipated guerdon, but,\r\naware of the ready transition from adulation to slander, disarmed\r\nhis tongue of its venom by a gracious accolade, kissing the forehead\r\nof this \"scourge of princes.\" The first token of favour bestowed on\r\nthe Duke by his Holiness was his nomination as governor of Fano in\r\n1551. In the following year he spent some time at Verona with the\r\nVenetian army, accompanied by his boy, who there had an illness which\r\noccasioned him much anxiety. This command was a somewhat anomalous\r\none, with the title of Governor of the Republican forces, which he\r\nvainly negotiated to exchange for that of General. Disgusted by\r\nthis refusal, he listened to an overture from his brothers-in-law\r\nfor transferring his services to the French King. Ottavio Farnese,\r\nnow Duke of Parma, apprehending some hostile intentions from the\r\nimperialists, had applied, in 1551, to the Pope for succours, in\r\norder to guarantee his possession of that state; but, unable to spare\r\nreinforcements or money, Julius had recommended him to take his own\r\nmeasures for defence. Acting on this advice, he had recourse to\r\nHenry II., from whom he accepted a condotta, on condition of Parma\r\nbeing supplied with a French garrison. Such a step could not fail\r\nto alarm the Emperor, who, representing that Ottavio had, in fact,\r\nmade over his duchy to France, brought upon him the thunders of the\r\nVatican. The inducement offered to Guidobaldo by the Farnesi for\r\nfollowing them into Henry's service was that the King should renounce\r\nthe supposed claims upon Urbino competent to his wife Caterina de'\r\nMedici, in right of her father Lorenzo, its usurping Duke. But the\r\ndecided measures adopted by the Pontiff cut short this negotiation,\r\nand we hear no more of pretensions which were doubtless vamped up to\r\nserve a temporary purpose. Although the Pontiff was nominally a party\r\nto the petty war which ensued in Lombardy, it was, in fact, but a\r\nchapter in the prolonged struggle between the houses of Hapsburg and\r\nBourbon, with which our narrative has no concern. Another episode\r\nin the same contest was more alarming to Central Italy, and, when\r\nTuscany became involved in the strife, it seemed well for Julius to\r\nstand on the defensive. Accordingly, in January, 1553, he named\r\nGuidobaldo captain-general of the Church, who, in April, proceeded\r\nto Rome for his installation; and accompanied by a brilliant staff,\r\nreviewed the pontifical troops.\r\n\r\nSiena, originally Ghibelline, had, during the recurring convulsions\r\nof a nominally democratic government, remained in some measure\r\ndevoted to the imperialist party. But, irritated by the licence\r\nof their Spanish garrison, and alarmed at a rumoured intention of\r\nCharles V. to seize their state, and exchange it with the Farnesi\r\nfor that of Parma, the citizens, in 1552, foolishly listened to the\r\nintrigues of French emissaries, and, with the Count of Pitigliano's\r\naid, ousted their oppressors. In the campaign which followed,\r\nSiena was under French protection, whilst Florence efficiently\r\nco-operated with the imperialists against her, the Pope maintaining\r\nan armed neutrality. The duties of Guidobaldo were thus limited to\r\nan occupation of Bologna, in order to protect the ecclesiastical\r\nterritories and his own state, on the passage of French troops into\r\nTuscany. That his wishes favoured the independence of Siena appears\r\nfrom his having, at the election of Marcellus II., in April, 1554,\r\nrecommended an intervention in its favour; but it was too late, as\r\nthe city had already capitulated, and was soon after finally annexed\r\nto Florence.\r\n\r\nThe successor of Julius III., who died in March, 1555, was Marcello\r\nCervini, Bishop of Gubbio; and the Duke of Urbino congratulated\r\nhimself on seeing a personal friend mount the throne of St. Peter.\r\nBut his satisfaction was transient. Popular superstition awarded an\r\nearly death to any Pontiff who should take for title his Christian\r\nname: the fate of Adrian VI. had verified the omen; and, after\r\na reign of but three weeks, Marcellus was carried to the tomb.\r\nGuidobaldo immediately took armed possession of the Roman gates for\r\nprotection of the conclave; but the election of Cardinal Caraffa as\r\nPaul IV. passed off satisfactorily, and his energy was rewarded by a\r\nconfirmation in his command, and the restoration of the Prefecture\r\nof Rome, with reversion to his son, an honour which, though long\r\nheld by his father and grandfather, had been enjoyed for the last\r\nseventeen years by the Farnesi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\n     The Duke's domestic affairs--Policy of Paul IV.--The Duke\r\n     enters the Spanish service--Rebellion at Urbino severely\r\n     repressed--His death and character--His children.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis somewhat barren portion of our narrative may be appropriately\r\nenlivened by the marriage of Princess Elisabetta, sister of\r\nGuidobaldo, to Alberico Cibò, Prince of Massa. The bride left Urbino\r\non the 26th of September, accompanied by the Duke and Duchess, and\r\nremained at Castel Durante for two days. She was convoyed for some\r\nmiles farther by the court, and parted from her family with copious\r\ntears on both sides. That night she slept at S. Angelo, and next\r\nday reached Città di Castello, escorted by an immense train of the\r\nprincipal residents to the Vitelli Palace. There she was entertained\r\nat an almost regal banquet, with about fifty gentle dames, each more\r\nbeautiful than the other, and all richly dressed; after which there\r\nfollowed dancing, to the music of many rare instruments and choruses,\r\ntill near daybreak. Travelling in a litter by easy journeys, she\r\nreached Florence in four days, and was welcomed with magnificent\r\npublic honours. She entered the city in a rich dress of green\r\nvelvet, radiant with jewels, and passed two days there, the guest\r\nof Chiappino Vitelli, who spent 2000 scudi upon four entertainments\r\nin her honour, including a ball and masquerade. On going to court,\r\nshe was received by the Grand Duke and Duchess as a sister, with\r\nmuch kindness, and a world of professions. Near Pisa she was met by\r\nher bridegroom, at the head of a cavalcade which resembled an army\r\nmarching to the assault of the city; and his mother, though almost\r\ndying, had herself carried to the bed in which the bride had sought\r\nrepose, to embrace her with maternal affection. More acceptable,\r\nperhaps, than this singular visit, was the present received from her\r\nin the morning, of two immense pearls, and a golden belt studded with\r\ncostly jewels. The pair entered the capital next day, amid a crash\r\nof artillery, martial music, and bells, preceded by fifty youths in\r\nyellow velvet and white plumes. The festive arches delighted the\r\nnarrator, but still more the palace furniture, \"where nothing was\r\nseen but armchairs brocaded in silk and gold, and one everywhere\r\nstepped on the finest carpets.\" The community offered six immense\r\nvases, and a donative of bullocks, fowls, and wax. \"But all this is\r\nnothing to the excessive affection which the Lord Marquis bears to\r\nhis most illustrious consort: he does not merely love her, he adores\r\nher. May God continue it, and maintain them in happiness.\"[57] This\r\nkind wish had scanty fulfilment, for the Princess died nine years\r\nlater, her husband surviving to the patriarchal age of ninety-six.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: TONDINI, _Memorie di Franceschino Marchetti_, App., p.\r\n16.]\r\n\r\nIn 1556, Guidobaldo finished the citadel and fortifications of\r\nSinigaglia, which had occupied him during ten years, and which were\r\nconsidered an important bulwark against Turkish descents on the\r\nAdriatic coast. There also he instituted a college for the study of\r\ngunnery; and he commemorated the completion of these establishments\r\nby striking four medals, of which three are described by Riposati;\r\nnone of them, however, merit special notice, the beauty of Italian\r\ndies being already on the wane. The court was now for the most part\r\nresident at Pesaro, a situation excelling in amenity and convenience\r\nthe original capital of the duchy. Among its attractions may be\r\nnumbered the palace-villa of Imperiale, which has been described;\r\nbut it became necessary to provide a town residence, that in the\r\ncitadel, which had sufficed for the Sforza, being far too restricted\r\nfor the demands of growing luxury. Of the palace at Pesaro,\r\nGuidobaldo II. may be considered the entire author,[*58] and if it\r\nseem scarcely suited for the accommodation of so famed a court,\r\nwe must recollect that the golden days of this principality were\r\nalready passing away, that the military qualities of its sovereigns\r\nand people had become less gainful, and the devotion of its dukes to\r\nletters and arts was beginning to languish. Although extensive, the\r\naspect of this residence is mean, its buildings rambling. It exhibits\r\nno appearance of a public edifice except the spacious _loggia_ or\r\narcade. Over this, its single external feature, is the great hall,\r\nmeasuring 134 by 54 feet, and of well-proportioned height. Here we\r\nfind some interesting traces of the della Rovere, in those quaint\r\nand significant family devices which it was their pride unceasingly\r\nto repeat. The manifold compartments of its richly stuccoed ceiling\r\ncontain their heraldic badge, the oak-tree; the ermine of Naples; the\r\nhalf-inclined palm-tree; the _meta_, or goal of merit, and similar\r\nfancies.[59] These recur among delicately sculptured arabesques on\r\nthe internal lintels, and ornament the imposing chimney-pieces,\r\nvaried by figures of Fame strewing oak-leaves and acorns. This palace\r\nwas later the winter residence of the cardinal legates of Urbino and\r\nPesaro, of whom portraits, from the Devolution of the duchy to the\r\nHoly See, in 1626, surround the great hall. In 1845, Cardinal della\r\nGenga was the forty-eighth of this long succession.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *58: It was probably the work of Girolamo Genga (1476-1551)\r\nand his son Bartolomeo (1518-58). It is now the Prefettura. It has\r\nnever struck me as \"mean,\" but rather as being a somewhat imposing\r\nbuilding.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: See these devices explained in No. V. of the Appendix\r\nto Vol. I. The respective importance of the ducal residences is\r\nmarked by their colloquial epithets,--the _corte_ at Urbino, the\r\n_palazzo_ at Pesaro, the _casa_ at Gubbio.]\r\n\r\nPaul IV. was seventy-nine years of age when he assumed the triple\r\ntiara. His life had been one long exercise of holy zeal and ascetic\r\nobservance, and the Romans, again sunk in those habits of luxury\r\nand indulgence from which Bourbon's army had roused them, saw with\r\nlittle satisfaction the accession of one so intolerant. But they\r\nwere ill-prepared for a turbulence unparalleled during many years.\r\nHis policy leaned to the once favourite, but long dormant, idea of\r\nexpelling the Spaniards from Lower Italy; while, to the astonishment\r\nof mankind, the almost abandoned pretensions of nepotism were revived\r\nwith unflinching fierceness by this octogenarian founder of the\r\nstrictly devotional order of Theatins. A trumpery outrage on the\r\nFrench flag by the Sforza of Santa-fiore,[*60] in which the Colonna\r\nwere alleged to have participated or sympathised, supplied a pretext\r\nfor putting the latter to the ban; and their vast possessions, which\r\nin the ecclesiastical states alone numbered above a hundred separate\r\nholdings, were conferred upon the Pope's nephew, Giovanni Caraffa,\r\nCount of Montorio. The Colonna flew to arms, and, being under the\r\navowed protection of Spain, were supported by troops from Naples,\r\nagainst whom the Duke of Urbino was ordered to march; but fortunately\r\nthe ashes of civil broils were nearly cold, and peace would have\r\ncontinued undisturbed, had not Paul, in the following year, issued\r\nhis monitory against Philip II. Although the Spanish intervention\r\nin behalf of the Colonna formed an ostensible ground for this\r\naggression, its true motives are traced by Panvinio to more remote\r\nand personal considerations, dating from the viceroyalty of Lautrec,\r\nby whom the Caraffa, always adherents of France, had been harshly\r\ntreated. Reverting to the papal policy of half a century before, Paul\r\nsought to avenge this quarrel through French instrumentality, and\r\nalthough a pacification of unusual solemnity had been concluded in\r\nFebruary of this year between Charles V. and Henry II., preparatory\r\nto the former retiring from the cares of sovereignty, he contrived,\r\nby successful intrigues, to bring the two great European powers\r\nonce more into hostility, and to revive in the Bourbon King those\r\nambitious projects which had formerly brought his predecessors across\r\nthe Alps for the conquest of Naples.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *60: For all that concerns Santa Fiora and the\r\nSforza-Cesarini, see a forthcoming work by EDWARD HUTTON, with notes\r\nby WILLIAM HEYWOOD, entitled _In Unknown Tuscany_ (Methuen). It deals\r\nwith the whole history of Mont'Amiata and its castles and villages.]\r\n\r\nAnticipating this threatened danger, the Duke of Alva marched an\r\narmy of fourteen thousand men into the Comarca, which he overran\r\nin September, occupying Tivoli on the one hand, and Ostia on the\r\nother, whilst Marc-Antonio Colonna scoured the Campagna, to the\r\ngates of Rome. Guidobaldo, who appears to have been about this time\r\nsuperseded, and his truncheon of command transferred to the Pontiff's\r\nfavourite nephew, contented himself with sending a contingent of two\r\nthousand troops, under Aurelio Fregoso, for his Holiness's support.\r\nThe efforts made on all sides to conclude a harassing and useless\r\nwar, were rendered unavailing by the Pope's obstinacy and ambition;\r\nthe only terms he would agree to including an investiture of his\r\nnephew as sovereign of Siena, in compensation for the Colonna estates.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter months, a horde of northern barbarians were once\r\nmore mustered to invade unhappy Italy. Fourteen thousand Gascons,\r\nGrisons, and Germans, under command of the Duc de Guise, marched\r\nearly in the spring upon Romagna, which, though a friendly country,\r\nthey cruelly ravaged. Faenza having escaped their brutality by\r\ndenying them entrance, its citizens testified their gratitude for\r\nthe exemption, by instituting an annual triduan thanksgiving, and\r\ndotation of two of their daughters. The Duke of Urbino did his best\r\nto secure his people during the transit of this army, which crossed\r\nthe Tronto in April. It would be tedious to follow the fortunes of a\r\ncampaign in which he took no part, and which, whoever gained, was\r\nthe scourge of Italy. On the 26th of August, the Duc de Guise placed\r\nhis scaling ladders against the San Sebastiano gate, and Rome had\r\nnearly been carried by a coup-de-main. At length the representations\r\nof Venice and Florence, which had remained neutral, prevailed with\r\nhis Holiness, and, on the 14th of September, peace was restored,\r\nleaving matters much on their former footing. Riposati assures us\r\nthat during this war the French monarch would gladly have secured the\r\nservices of Guidobaldo, now free from his engagements to the Pontiff,\r\nbut that Duke Cosimo of Florence interested himself to procure for\r\nhim an engagement from Spain. This was at length arranged, in the\r\nspring of 1558, previously to which Charles V. appears to have\r\nbestowed on him the Golden Fleece, the highest compliment at his\r\ndisposal.[61]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: Some authorities represent him as receiving this Order\r\neleven years later from Charles V., but that Emperor died in this\r\nvery year. He is said to have had knighthood from the Pope in 1561.]\r\n\r\nThe terms upon which the Duke took service under Philip II. are\r\nthus stated in a letter of Bernardo Tasso. The King guaranteed him\r\nprotection for his territories against all hazards, and bound himself\r\nto supply and maintain for him a body-guard of at least two hundred\r\ninfantry, besides a company of a hundred men-at-arms, and another\r\nof two hundred light horse. He further engaged to pay him monthly\r\n1000 golden scudi for his appointments as captain-general, besides\r\nmaintaining for him four colonels and twenty captains. In return,\r\nthe Duke took an oath to serve his Majesty faithfully against all\r\npotentates, the pontiffs alone excepted. The political results of\r\nthis arrangement were strongly and painfully felt by Bernardo,\r\nwho regarded it as establishing the tranquillity of Naples, the\r\nsecurity of Tuscany, and, in a word, the Spanish domination in\r\nItaly. Inclined to the French interests (for there was no longer\r\nan Italian party in existence), he would have gladly seen the\r\nsovereign of a highland population, whose warlike sinews were not yet\r\nquite relaxed, preserve his neutrality, or rather, like his father,\r\nattach himself to the republic of Venice, which still possessed much\r\nexternal power and internal independence. Indeed, he laments the\r\nshort-sighted policy of the Signory, in omitting this opportunity\r\nof securing, as an available check upon Spanish influence, an able\r\nconfederate, and corn-growing neighbour; a blunder which was the\r\nmore unaccountable, as, in the opinion of Mocenigo, who was Venetian\r\nenvoy at Urbino many years later, the prepossessions of Guidobaldo\r\nwere even then in favour of a connection which had hereditary claims\r\nupon his preference. On the first days of May the convention was\r\npublished at Pesaro, after solemn thanksgiving to the Almighty\r\nfor a dispensation so acceptable to the Duke.[62] The importance\r\nto Spain of this condotta may be understood from a fact mentioned\r\nby Riposati, that Gubbio alone sent forth, between 1530 and 1570,\r\nthree captains-general, two lieutenants-general, six colonels, and\r\nsixty-five captains of note. Mocenigo says, there were in 1570 twelve\r\nthousand soldiers in the duchy, ready at call.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: From an account of this engagement preserved among\r\nthe Oliveriana MSS., and slightly differing from that by Bernardo\r\nTasso (II., letter 166), we learn that the pay of officers was from\r\n15 to 40 scudi a month, that of cavalry privates 5, and of infantry\r\n3 scudi. It appears to have been worth to Guidobaldo in all about\r\n35,000 scudi a year, but to have been irregularly received.]\r\n\r\nOur notices of Guidobaldo become ever more barren. In 1565 the\r\narmament of Sultan Solyman against Malta spread consternation\r\nthroughout Western Europe, and, by desire of Philip II., the Duke\r\nof Urbino sent four or five thousand troops to aid in the defence\r\nof the knights. Prince Francesco Maria asked leave to accompany the\r\nexpedition, but his father, considering his time better bestowed in\r\nvisiting courts, sent him in this year to Madrid, with commission\r\nto recover a long arrear of his own military allowances. In this he\r\nwas successful, but the sum scarcely sufficed to clear the expenses\r\nof his journey. Particulars of this visit, and of his marriage in\r\n1571, will be told from his own pen in next chapter. But there was\r\nno lukewarmness on his father's part on the question of the Cross\r\nagainst the Crescent. After the Prince returned from the naval action\r\noff Lepanto, which will also be narrated from his Autobiography,\r\nGuidobaldo prepared a Discourse on the propriety of a general war\r\nagainst the Turks, the means of conducting the proposed campaign with\r\ndue regard to the security of Italy, the preparation of adequate\r\nmunitions, and the best plan for carrying the seat of war into\r\nthe enemy's country. It is unnecessary to dwell upon a matter now\r\nso completely gone by: the paper emanates from a mind capable of\r\nenlarged views, and fully conversant with the belligerent resources\r\nand general policy of his age, as well as experienced in military\r\noperations.[63]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: Vat. Ottob. MSS. No. 2510, f. 201.]\r\n\r\nThe _Relazioni_ of the Venetian envoys supply us with some notices of\r\nUrbino about this time, and prove that the Duke's expenses were very\r\ngreat, partly from frequent calls upon his hospitality by visitors\r\nof distinction, but still more from his maintaining separate and\r\ncostly establishments for himself, the Duchess, the Prince, and the\r\nPrincess.[64] Mocenigo estimates his income from imposts, monopolies,\r\nand allodial domains, at 100,000 scudi; adding that, \"should he think\r\nproper to burden his people, this sum might unquestionably be greatly\r\naugmented, but, choosing to follow the custom of his predecessors, in\r\nmaking it his chief object to preserve the affection of his subjects,\r\nhe is content to leave matters as they are, and live in straits for\r\nmoney.\"[65] He also tells us that, though poor in revenues, he was\r\nmaster of his people's affections, who on an exigency would place\r\nlife and substance at his disposal. The accuracy of these impressions\r\nis in some degree impugned by what we are now about to relate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: That of Mocenigo, 1570, is printed by Vieussieux,\r\nsecond series, vol. II., p. 97, and in the _Tesoro Politico_, II.,\r\n169; that of Zen or Zane, 1574, in the same volume of Vieussieux, p.\r\n315.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: Of several statements as to the ducal revenue and\r\nexpenditure which I have seen, none is distinct or satisfactory. The\r\nmost detailed is in a MS. in the public library at Siena, K. III.,\r\nNo. 58, p. 240, but the sums have been inextricably blundered by the\r\ntranscriber. See Appendix VIII.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable incident in Guidobaldo's reign was an outbreak\r\nof the citizens of Urbino, dignified in its municipal history by\r\nthe name of a rebellion, which acquires a factitious importance\r\nas the only symptom of discontent that troubled the peace of the\r\nduchy, from the death of Oddantonio in 1443, to the extinction of\r\nits independence in 1631. We shall condense its incidents from the\r\ncontemporary narrative of Gian-Francesco Cartolari, who designated\r\nhimself agent of the Duke, and who, notwithstanding his official\r\nposition, writes with apparent frankness and impartiality.[66]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: Vat. Ottob. MSS. No. 3142, f. 165, and Oliveriana MSS.\r\nNo. 390, p. 63.]\r\n\r\nIn August, 1572, the Duke intimated to the council of Urbino that\r\nhe had received authority from Gregory XIII. to impose a tax of one\r\nquatrino per lb. on butchers' meat, and of two bolognini upon every\r\n_staro_ of grain and _soma_ of wine;[67] and in October he made\r\nproclamation throughout the duchy of these new imposts. It being\r\nrumoured that the envoys of Gubbio had obtained for that community\r\na suspension of the obnoxious duties, discontent began to prevail,\r\nand on the 26th December one Zibetto, a cobbler, in an inflammatory\r\nharangue, at a public assembly dignified with the name of general\r\ncouncil, declared that these were exactions under which the poor\r\ncould not exist.[*68] On his proposal, forty delegates were chosen\r\nfrom the nobility, and sworn to represent the matter to the Duke in\r\nperson. They repaired to Pesaro, and, on the 29th, had an audience\r\nto present the memorial agreed to by the council, which Guidobaldo\r\nreceived, and desired them to go home, promising that an answer would\r\nbe transmitted when he had considered their statement. They, however,\r\nstayed a week, vainly looking for his reply, during which the council\r\nmet daily at Urbino, and at length they were recalled by an express\r\nfrom the Gonfaloniere. Meanwhile a vice-duke had been sent thither,\r\nwho, on the 1st of January, 1573, published a suspension of the new\r\nimposts throughout the whole state. This concession, however, did not\r\nsatisfy the discontented, who, in another general council, accredited\r\ntwo envoys to Prince Francesco Maria, begging his intervention to\r\nprocure an answer to their memorial. Having failed in this object,\r\nand finding that troops were being secretly organised to garrison\r\ntheir city, the people of Urbino rushed to arms, closed the gates,\r\nand, having mustered above a thousand men, began to strengthen\r\nthe defences and lay in stores. The Vice-Duke being thereupon\r\nrecalled, the general council assembled daily in such numbers, that\r\nadjournments to one of the largest churches were found necessary,\r\nand the inhabitants, setting aside private rivalries, co-operated\r\nwith one mind for the public safety, mounting guard, and making every\r\nexertion to render their city tenable. The impossibility of doing so\r\nagainst the Duke's military levies being however quickly apparent\r\neven to the insurgents, an embassy of six was despatched to Rome to\r\nbeseech the Pope's mediation. Nor did the reaction stop there; a\r\ngeneral cry rose for the Prince, or his brother the Cardinal, the\r\nopportune arrival of either of whom would have ended the _émeute_.\r\nOn the 29th, however, the Duchess came with a small suite, and was\r\nreceived with cries of \"Long life to the Duke, but death to the\r\n_gabelle_!\" The efforts of the magistracy and popular leaders to\r\nmake their peace were unavailing, in consequence of their having sent\r\nrepresentations to the Pontiff, and, on the 3rd of February, the\r\nDuchess departed without effecting any arrangement, to the infinite\r\nannoyance of all parties. The envoys could get no other reply from\r\nhis Holiness but that they must go home and make submission, and they\r\nwere followed by a brief from him, enjoining them to lay down arms\r\nand seek his Excellency's unconditional pardon. As soon as this had\r\nbeen publicly read by the Gonfaloniere, the people piled their arms\r\nin the piazza, and the peasantry dispersed to their country homes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: The _staro_ or _stajo_ corresponded to a bushel; the\r\namount of a _soma_ is doubtful. A _quatrino_ is 1/5 of a _bajocco_,\r\nthat is, of a halfpenny in present value. A _bolognino_ was about\r\n7-1/3 farthings. See vol. II., p. 259.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *68: In 1562 Guidobaldo had augmented the tax on grain\r\nby leave of Pius IV. Cf. UGOLINI, _op. cit._, vol. II., p. 28, and\r\nPELLEGRINI, _Gubbio sotto i Conti e Duchi d'Urbino_ in _Boll. per\r\nl'Umbria_, vol. XI., p. 239 _et seq._, and esp. CELLI, _Tasse e\r\nRivoluzione_ (Torino, 1892), p. 39.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this surrender, Guidobaldo advanced upon the city,\r\nquartering his troops in the surrounding villages, so as to blockade\r\nit, and all the public functionaries were superseded. Dreading a\r\nsack, the citizens rushed to the monasteries with their valuables,\r\nand, about the middle of February, sent fifty of the nobles to\r\ncrave pardon of their sovereign. After waiting at Pesaro for three\r\ndays, these were admitted to tender submission on their knees,\r\nand were then placed under arrest at their inn for twenty days,\r\nnotwithstanding incessant petitions from their fellow citizens\r\nfor their release. Six of them were then committed to the castle,\r\nand from time to time other leaders were brought from Urbino to\r\nshare their imprisonment. So terrified were the insurgents by\r\nthese measures, that those most compromised fled from the duchy,\r\nand but few remained in their houses; a proclamation was therefore\r\nissued that all exiles should return home within two months, under\r\npenalties of rebellion. The property of the prisoners and exiles\r\nwas confiscated; the city was disarmed; public assemblies were\r\nprohibited; and the magistracy were discharged from their duties.[69]\r\nSuch rigorous measures having inspired a general panic, the imposts\r\nwere again proclaimed at Easter, to include retrospectively the\r\nprevious year. These severities were perhaps scarcely beyond the\r\nexigencies of the case; at all events, they cannot be justly regarded\r\nas an extreme exercise of the despotic authority which the Duke\r\nundoubtedly possessed; but those which ensued must be viewed with\r\nabhorrence, alike from their own enormity, and from their prejudicial\r\ninfluence in confounding vengeance with justice.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: The magistrates of Urbino were four in number, a\r\ngonfaloniere chosen from the city nobles, a prior to represent the\r\nmerchants, and two priors of the trades. The general council seems to\r\nhave been open to all citizens.]\r\n\r\nA judge was brought from Ferrara to sit upon the prisoners, and on\r\nthe 1st of July nine of them were beheaded in the castle at midnight;\r\ntheir bodies, after being flung out and exposed beyond the city, were\r\nhuddled together into an unconsecrated pit, until some days later\r\nthey were taken up by order of the Bishop of Pesaro, and received\r\nChristian burial. Nor was the indignation of their sovereign appeased\r\nby these revolting cruelties: others implicated were sent to the\r\ngalleys or died of hard usage. A commission sat at Urbino for two\r\nmonths to realise the estates of those attainted, whose widows and\r\nchildren were deprived of their dowries, and in some instances their\r\nvery houses were razed to the ground. The results were fatal to the\r\nwhole community, for magisterial business was suspended, the schools\r\nwere left without teachers, the town without medical practitioners,\r\ntrade of every sort at a stand. At length, in December, permission\r\nwas obtained to hold a general council, at which it was determined\r\nonce more to send ambassadors to intercede for mercy. For this\r\npurpose about eighty of the principal nobility were selected to\r\naccompany the Gonfaloniere and priors to Pesaro, their cavalcade\r\namounting to above a hundred persons on horseback. On the 27th of\r\nDecember, they were admitted to an audience in presence of the whole\r\ncourt, and the Gonfaloniere, after a very judicious speech, presented\r\nto his Excellency a petition couched in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n\"Most illustrious and most excellent Lord Duke, our especial lord\r\nand master! Inspired by a most ardent desire for your illustrious\r\nExcellency's favour and good will, and having ever felt the utmost\r\ngrief and regret for the recent events, the city of Urbino,\r\nwith entire devotion and alacrity, has resolved to send to your\r\nillustrious Excellency its magistrates, and the present numerous\r\nembassy, in order that with every possible humility, they in our\r\nname, and we likewise for ourselves, may supplicate you, with all\r\nreverence and submission, to accord us grace and pardon, entirely\r\nforgetting the provocations received, and, as our clement father and\r\nmaster, full of charity towards us, to deign willingly to comfort\r\nus, and receive us again, and restore us to your love and benign\r\ngrace; assuring your most illustrious Excellency, that this your\r\ncity will never, in fidelity, love, and obedience towards your most\r\nillustrious person and house, yield to any other in the world, and\r\nthat it is, and ever will be, most prompt at all times and occasions\r\nto expose our lives, and those of our children, and our whole goods\r\nand possessions, in your service and honour; so that, in the event of\r\nour receiving, as we desire and hope, forgiveness from your infinite\r\nbounty and magnanimity, we, the humblest and most faithful of your\r\nservants, thanking God with sincerely joyful hearts, may return,\r\nsinging in chorus--'Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who hath\r\nvisited and redeemed his people,' and may ever keep in remembrance\r\nthis trusted day of grace, and render it a gladsome festival in all\r\ntime to come.\"\r\n\r\nTo this petition the Duke returned the following gracious answer:--\"I\r\nhear with much good will and satisfaction the duty which you pay, the\r\nfree pardon which you ask, and the penitence which you exhibit, all\r\nwhich induce me to confirm to you, as I now do most willingly, the\r\nforgiveness I already have accorded: and the promise which you make,\r\nof being ever faithful and loyal to me, proves you ready to second\r\nyour words with good purposes, as I readily believe you will do. I\r\nalso promise you from henceforward entirely to forget the past, and\r\nto receive you into my pristine affection; and had it pleased God\r\nthat the warnings and persuasions which you received from my lips had\r\nbeen taken by you at first, you would have been spared many evils,\r\nannoyances, and losses, and I much displeasure. Nevertheless, take\r\ncourage, and, as I have already said, so long as you do your duty,\r\nyou will find me as loving in time to come as I have ever been, all\r\nwhich you will report to your city.\"[70]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: Vat. Ottob. MSS. No. 3141, ff. 160, 165, dated December\r\n27, 1573.]\r\n\r\nThis reply gave great satisfaction to the deputation, and after\r\nbeing suitably acknowledged by their head, all of them knelt to\r\ntheir Sovereign, the Duchess, and the Prince, kissing the hems of\r\ntheir garments in humble attitude. Next day they returned home,\r\nand summoned a general council, to which there was read a letter\r\nfrom Guidobaldo, reinstating the city in its former privileges,\r\nand removing the obnoxious imposts. Four deputies having been\r\ncommissioned to thank his Highness for these demonstrations of\r\nreturning favour, they were honourably received and entertained at\r\nPesaro. The council next voted a peace-offering of 50,000 scudi\r\ntowards paying the Duke's debts, which had been the primary root\r\nof the evil; but, in consideration of their recent sufferings, he\r\naccepted of but 20,000, payable in seven years. Although there\r\nremained some symptoms of smouldering sedition, the Duke on the\r\n14th of June suddenly started for Urbino, and was welcomed by a\r\ndeputation, and such other marks of respect as the short notice would\r\npermit. During a residence of twelve days, he renounced 8000 scudi of\r\nthe donative, and conceded several privileges to the community, whom\r\nhe did not again visit during the brief residue of his life.\r\n\r\nThe Urbino rebellion holds a place in the history of that state which\r\nneither its incidents nor its issue deserve. It originated in a sore\r\nof old standing, the Duke having for years comparatively deserted\r\nthe ancient capital of his duchy, and transferred his residence to\r\nPesaro. Influenced by this grudge, its citizens, instead of, like\r\nthe other communities, resting satisfied with his remission of dues\r\nin January, 1573, kept up an agitation, and finally piqued their\r\nsovereign by carrying their grievances to the papal throne. On the\r\nwhole, these transactions were in all respects most unfortunate, and\r\nit was long ere the duchy recovered from the heart-burnings they left\r\nbehind. The Duke then forfeited the popularity of a lifetime, and\r\nhis fame continues blackened by the scurrilous traditionary nickname\r\nof Guidobaldaccio, a usual diminutive expressing contemptuous\r\ndisparagement. Grossi says that, when too late, he regretted the\r\nharshness of his after measures; and some doubt as to his good faith\r\nin regard to an amnesty is hinted in the following letter from his\r\ncousin-german Ludovico Gonzaga, Duke of Nevers and Rethel, which I\r\nfound among the Oliveriana MSS. at Pesaro.\r\n\r\n     \"Most illustrious and most excellent Lord,\r\n\r\n     \"Your Excellency's letters of the 15th of June and 9th of\r\n     July reached me together, at the forest of Vincennes, only\r\n     on the 10th instant, along with another addressed by you to\r\n     the most serene King of Poland, which I have not failed to\r\n     deliver in person to his Majesty, with such expressions as\r\n     seemed suitably to convey your Excellency's good wishes.\r\n     With these his Majesty was much satisfied and pleased, and\r\n     he returns to your Excellency many thanks. I have not as\r\n     yet been able to obtain his answer, as he went off suddenly\r\n     to Fontainebleau, whither I now am on my way, and on my\r\n     arrival shall get it sent you as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n     \"I have read the summary of the trials of these rebels,\r\n     of whom your Excellency advises me you had nine beheaded,\r\n     as to which matter I have been glad to be informed, in\r\n     order satisfactorily to answer those who occasionally\r\n     speak of it; and also being at all times glad to learn\r\n     that your affairs go on well and to your contentment. It\r\n     is my conviction that you have acted most justly, and done\r\n     everything for clear reasons; yet, I do not omit telling\r\n     you that some people are perplexed at these events, saying,\r\n     that your Excellency having granted a general pardon to\r\n     all the conspirators, they cannot see by what right you\r\n     afterwards let justice take its course against them. This I\r\n     mention purposely that you may be informed of everything.\r\n\r\n     \"It only remains to beseech that you will deign command\r\n     my willing services, in whatever respect you consider me\r\n     useful, as this is my ardent wish; and so I sincerely kiss\r\n     your hands, praying God to grant you all happiness. From\r\n     Paris, the last of September, 1573. Your Excellency's most\r\n     devoted, and most obliged cousin,\r\n\r\n     \"LUDOVICO GONZAGA.\"\r\n\r\nThe account of these disturbances, given by the Prince in his\r\nAutobiography, is as follows: \"His father having by great liberality\r\nand magnificence deranged his finances, found it necessary to augment\r\nhis revenue, and his subjects, unused to such burdens, began to offer\r\nresistance. The Duke, not to let himself be thwarted in that way,\r\nprepared to use force; but at last matters were restored to quiet,\r\nby their humbling themselves, and receiving his pardon, not without\r\nthe punishment of some, as an example to the rest. At this juncture\r\nFrancesco Maria contrived so to conduct himself, that his father had\r\nreason to be well satisfied with his services; and the people had\r\nno cause to be discontented with him, his uniform endeavour having\r\nbeen, to the utmost of his power, to mollify the one and moderate the\r\nother, which was in the end effected.\"\r\n\r\nOf this dull reign little remains to be told. In the words of the\r\nsame Memoir,--\"Guidobaldo went to Ferrara in the autumn of 1574, to\r\nvisit Henry III. of France, who was on his way from Poland, on the\r\ndeath of his brother Charles IX. Returning to Pesaro during great\r\nheats, he fell ill, and passed to a better life on the 28th of\r\nSeptember, aged sixty. On hearing of his illness, Francesco Maria\r\nhastened to Pesaro from Castel Durante, where he generally stayed\r\nfor the hunting season, and finding his father in great suffering,\r\nhe attended him assiduously through the fatal malady. The funeral\r\nceremonies were performed with much pomp, in presence of many\r\ndeputies and ambassadors; and Giacomo Mazzoni pronounced a long and\r\nelaborate oration, commending his clemency, liberality, bravery,\r\nprudence, and other princely virtues.\" We are told by a contemporary\r\nchronicler that his illness was a quartan, which became a putrid\r\nfever, but that he bore it with patient and pious resignation,\r\nsupported by the aids of religion. His funeral took place in the\r\nchurch of Corpus Domini, at Pesaro, in conformity with his own wish,\r\nmindful perhaps, in his last moments, of his recent quarrel with\r\nUrbino, where the ashes of his ancestors were laid.\r\n\r\nThe character of this Duke, drawn by the Venetian envoys, is quite as\r\nfavourable as the few notices given us by Urbino writers. His habits\r\nwere free and social, and his liberality to friends and favourites\r\ngave him a popularity at court which extended to his subjects and\r\nsoldiery. In affairs of honour his judgment was often sought, and\r\nhis decisions generally admitted. Though seldom in the field, he was\r\nconsidered an authority on military affairs, and, without rivalling\r\nthe literary tastes of his son, he was a patron of letters, and\r\nespecially of music.[*71] The device which he selected was a goal or\r\nwinning-post, with a Greek inscription, \"To the most devoted lover of\r\nworth\"; and Ruscellai informs us that he acted up to the sentiment\r\nin encouraging merit. His hospitality is alluded to by Ariosto in\r\nRinaldo's journey to Lapidusa, and Count Litta ascribes to him the\r\ninstitution of the Pacieri, an association of both sexes for the\r\npurpose of preventing litigation. It is true that his failings of\r\ncharacter or temper were neither gilded by the military renown of his\r\nfather, nor redeemed by the pious philosophy of his son; but so far\r\nas the meagre materials within our reach have enabled us to judge,\r\nno great faults have been brought home to him either as a sovereign\r\nor as a man. Indeed, we are enabled to adduce one satisfactory\r\ninstance wherein, under circumstances peculiarly irritating to a\r\nperson of impetuous disposition, his conduct was marked with great\r\nforbearance and gentleness. His favourite undertaking of fortifying\r\nSinigaglia had been thwarted in 1556, from the obstinate refusal of\r\nmoney by a Jew, who, though sent to him for the purpose of effecting\r\na loan, resisted his urgent persuasions to conclude it.[*72] After\r\nmentioning the circumstance in a letter to his confidential favourite\r\nMarchetti, he thus continues: \"We avoided all expressions which might\r\nseem to approve of his discourse, and so left him. However, to you\r\nwe shall just say that if they won't lend, may they meet with the\r\nlike.[73] We shall seek some other course, and obtain by other means\r\nwhat is required for the operations. You may, therefore, after doing\r\nyour best for this purpose in Sinigaglia, proceed first towards La\r\nPergola, and then to Fossombrone, but there is no occasion to employ\r\nin this matter threats or severe language. On the contrary, you are\r\nonly to seek out the people, to exhort and civilly urge them to what\r\nis wanted, but of their own free will, and by no other means; and\r\nif they will not agree, you need not break out upon them, but let it\r\nstand over, that we may see what can be effected in some other way.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote *71: Cf. a letter from Angelo Colocci to the Duke, printed\r\nby MORICI, _Due Umanisti Marchigiani_ in _Boll. per l'Umbria_, vol.\r\nII., p. 152; and for Music, ROSSI, _Appunti per la Storia della Musica\r\nalla Corte di Francesco Maria I. e di Guidobaldo della Rovere_ in\r\n_Rassegna Emiliana_ (Modena, 1888), vol.

CELLI, _Le fortificazioni militari di Urbino,\r\nPesaro e Senigallia_ (Castelpiano, 1896).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: \"Tal sia di loro,\" a phrase which may perhaps only mean\r\n\"be it so.\"]\r\n\r\nIn absence of any contemporary estimate of this Duke's character,\r\nwe may cite one from the pen of a modern writer, himself a citizen\r\nof Urbino, and an enthusiastic student of its history. \"Although\r\npossessing not the marvellous sagacity, the untainted justice, the\r\nquick intelligence in public affairs, nor the other brilliant and\r\nrare virtues of his ancestors and of his son, which have rendered\r\ntheir names great, their authority respected, their memory dear and\r\npopular; he had good sense, military experience, and much fondness\r\nfor all liberal acquirements. He protected and honoured the first\r\ngeniuses of his time; and his beneficent actions were splendid even\r\nbeyond his means. Could one page be blotted from his life, too\r\nfatally memorable from its unjust and slippery policy, too detestable\r\nand disgraceful to his name; and had his manners been more affable,\r\nhis nature less impetuous and violent, his temper less overbearing,\r\nand his resolutions less inflexible; the people of Urbino would\r\nprobably have attempted no revolutionary movement, and he would have\r\nacquired much of the reputation left by his great-grandfather, and by\r\nhis estimable son.\"[74]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: Padre Checcucci, Professor of Rhetoric in the\r\nUniversity of Urbino, 1845.]\r\n\r\nFor the fine arts he seems to have cared little, and his memory has\r\nsuffered in consequence of this neglect. Angelo Bronzino is said to\r\nhave painted him during the life of his father, but the only original\r\nportrait I have ever found of him is a miniature in the Pitti Palace.\r\nBernardo Tasso was the laureate of his court, and we shall mention,\r\nin chapter L., the friendly welcome extended to that fortune-stricken\r\nbard during part of his life-long struggle. Bernardo Capello and\r\nPietro Aretino were among his guests; and Ludovico Domenichini\r\nof Piacenza, having dedicated to him an Italian translation of\r\nPlutarch's _Lives_, visited Urbino in 1555 to present the work to his\r\npatron.\r\n\r\nGuidobaldo left by his first wife one daughter,--\r\n\r\n     VIRGINIA, married in 1560 to Count Federigo\r\n     Borromeo, whose premature death is said to have frustrated\r\n     a project of his uncle, Pius IV., for investing him with\r\n     Camerino. She afterwards married Ferdinando Orsini, Duke of\r\n     Gravina, and, dying in childbed, left to her father about\r\n     180,000 scudi.\r\n\r\nThe children of his second marriage were,--\r\n\r\n     1. FRANCESCO MARIA, his heir.\r\n\r\n     2. ISABELLA, married in 1565 to Nicolò Bernardino\r\n     di Sanseverino, Prince of Bisignano, a Neapolitan nobleman,\r\n     with a fine fortune, but greatly encumbered. She was a\r\n     princess of generous and attractive character, and died in\r\n     1619 without surviving issue.\r\n\r\n     3. LAVINIA, said in the Venetian Relazione of Zane to\r\n     have been betrothed to Giacomo Buoncompagno natural son\r\n     of Gregory XIII., but the nuptials never took place. She\r\n     afterwards married Alfonso Felice d'Avalos d'Aquino,\r\n     Marquis of Guasto, son[*75] of the famous Vittoria Colonna,\r\n     and died in 1632, aged seventy-four.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote *75: This is a mistake. Vittoria Colonna had\r\n     no children. There was, however, a Marchese del Vasto, a\r\n     cousin of her husband's, whom she adopted as her son, and\r\n     to whom she frequently alluded in her poems; one of her\r\n     sonnets bewails his death.]\r\n\r\n          (From similarity of name, this princess has been\r\n          confused with her second cousin Lavinia Franciotti\r\n          della Rovere, wife of Paolo Orsini, whose intimacy\r\n          with Olympia Morata is well known to those who\r\n          trace the quickly smothered seeds of Protestantism\r\n          in Italy.)\r\n\r\nGuidobaldo left also two natural daughters,--\r\n\r\n     1. ----, married, first, to Count Antonio Landriano of\r\n     Pesaro; secondly, to Signor Pier-Antonio da Lunà of\r\n     Castella, in the Milanese.\r\n\r\n     2. ----, married to Signor Guidobaldo Renier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK EIGHTH\r\n\r\nOF FRANCESCO MARIA II.

Upon these we now turn back, and shall avail\r\nourselves to the utmost of the Memoirs he has left behind him, which,\r\nthough brief and incomplete, afford a valuable illustration of his\r\ncharacter, and an interesting addition to our few autobiographies of\r\nsovereigns. From the introductory sentence, we learn the motives by\r\nwhich they were undertaken:--\"As it is very usual for people to blame\r\nthe actions of others, and especially the proceedings of those who\r\nhave long directed the affairs of government, it has hence seemed to\r\nme right to narrate simply, truly, and briefly, the incidents that\r\nhave occurred to Francesco Maria, second of that name and sixth Duke\r\nof Urbino, in order that those who read this abstract may be aware\r\nof the actual and candid truth.\" Upon a narrative thus modestly\r\nprefaced it is unnecessary to make any critical remarks. Ere we close\r\nthis Book, their abrupt termination, before the marriage of Prince\r\nFederigo, will be sadly but sufficiently accounted for.[76]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: For the life of Francesco Maria II. our materials\r\nhave been ample. His own Memoirs, extending from his birth to the\r\nmarriage of his son, have been nearly all quoted verbatim. The\r\nautograph of this MS. I have examined in the Oliveriana Library (No.\r\n384, folio 219 to 229), but have made my translations from the only\r\nprinted edition, in the twenty-ninth volume of the _Nuova Raccolta\r\nd'Opuscoli_, known by the name Calogeriana, and published at Venice\r\nin 1776. There too will be found an account of the Devolution of\r\nUrbino to the Holy See, from the pen of Antonio Donata of Venice,\r\nby whom that negotiation was concluded on the Duke's part. In\r\nthe Magliabechiana Library at Florence (class 25, No. 76) is the\r\nautograph Diary of Francesco Maria from 1583 to 1623, which I have\r\nclosely searched. The rich MS. collections of the Oliveriana are\r\nstored with original correspondence and other documents illustrative\r\nof his reign, most of which have been looked into with scarcely\r\nremunerative labour, but among the matter there gleaned, his\r\ninstructions to his son may be deemed of especial importance.\r\nFrom a vast mass of such correspondence in these two libraries, a\r\ngeneral insight into his character and position, and those of his\r\nson, has been acquired, as well as many minute traits of both; but\r\nthe Prince's brief and unhonoured span has been illustrated in a\r\ngreat measure from collections made by Francesco Saverio Passeri, of\r\nPesaro, nephew of the naturalist Gianbattista Passeri, and printed\r\nin the twenty-sixth volume of the Calogeriana Collection. *Cf. also\r\nSCOTINI, _La Giovinezza. di F.M. II._ (Bologna, 1899).]\r\n\r\n\"To them [Duke Guidobaldo II. and Duchess Vittoria] was born at\r\nPesaro, on the 20th of February, 1549, a son, who was named Francesco\r\nMaria. Cardinal Duranti was sent by the Pope to perform the ceremony\r\nof his baptism, which was celebrated with great splendour on the 1st\r\nof May, Giacomo Soranzo acting as godfather in name of the republic\r\nof Venice. He was in infancy brought up with becoming care, and at\r\nthree years of age was carried to Venice by his father and mother.\r\nGuidobaldo was then general in the service of that state, and their\r\ntroops were chiefly stationed at Verona, whither Francesco Maria was\r\ntaken, and where he had a dangerous illness, recovered from which\r\nhe returned home. There, as he grew up, he was taught all fitting\r\nexercises of mind and body, under the successive superintendence\r\nof Muzio of Giustinopoli, Antonio Galli of Urbino, and Girolamo\r\nSimonetta of Cagli: his masters in grammar were Vincenzo Bartoli\r\nof Urbino, and afterwards Ludovico Corrado of Mantua, of literary\r\nnote. After some years, the Duke and his brother the Cardinal,\r\nhaving resolved to amuse themselves with a visit to Venice, at the\r\nfête of the Ascension, they took with them Francesco Maria, who was\r\nreceived with great favour and much made of, being admitted into\r\nthe company delle Calze.\" This was in 1564, and even thus early his\r\ntaste for painting was noticed by Titian, and celebrated in a sonnet\r\nby Verdizzotti. An establishment was maintained for him at Venice\r\napart from that of his father and uncle, and he gave many sumptuous\r\nentertainments.\r\n\r\n\"Having returned to Pesaro, and completed his sixteenth year, he\r\nhad a great wish to go forth and see the world and its usages, and\r\nmade much interest that his father should send him to some court,\r\npreferring that of the Emperor, who was then at war with the Turk. To\r\nthis his father was pleased to agree, but desired first to consult\r\nthe Catholic King (Philip II.), in whose service he was, and who\r\nin reply commended the plan, but desired that it might be carried\r\ninto effect at his own court, where the Prince would be welcomed and\r\ntreated as a son. His intentions being thus necessarily altered, at\r\nthe close of 1565, after the marriage of his sister Donna Isabella\r\nwith the Prince of Bisignano, he took his way to Spain, accompanied\r\nby many knights, particularly by Count Francesco Landriani, and\r\nPier-Antonio Lonato. Choosing the route by Genoa, he passed through\r\nFerrara to Mantua, where he stayed fifteen days by his father's\r\ndesire, who in youth long inhabited that city; and hearing of his\r\nuncle the Duke of Parma's return just then from Flanders, he went to\r\nsee him. On his arrival at Genoa he was lodged by Count Filippino\r\nDoria, his vassal in the castle of Sassocorbaro, and, after being\r\nvisited and much distinguished by the Signory, he embarked in a\r\nwar-galley of the Duke of Savoy, which, with another fully armed, had\r\nbeen sent on purpose for him, under the command of Admiral di Leini.\r\nIn it he went to Savona, the native place of his family, where he was\r\nreceived into the house of Vigeri, who were his subjects, and being\r\nstorm-stayed during eight days of the carnival, was entertained with\r\nfestivities and serenades, as is customary in that country.\r\n\r\n\"When the weather cleared, he re-embarked, and after a pleasant\r\nvoyage of a few days reached Palamos in Spain, whence he went by\r\nland to Barcelona. In that city he passed most of Lent, to give\r\ntime for an apartment being prepared for him in the palace, but got\r\nto Madrid for Easter week. He was met by the whole court and by\r\nmany grandees, especially by the Marquis of Pescara, who manifested\r\nsingular courtesy, attending to him as his own son; whence a most\r\nintimate and enduring friendship arose between them. He got the same\r\nquarters which the Prince of Florence had occupied shortly before,\r\nand his treatment was precisely similar. Next day he waited upon the\r\nKing, Queen, and Prince Royal, the Princess of Portugal, and the two\r\nsons of the Emperor [Maximilian II.], who were being educated there.\r\nBy all he was received with distinguished favour, which continued\r\nduring the two years and a half he spent at Madrid. He occupied\r\nhimself in all those noble exercises which there, more than anywhere\r\nelse, were attended to, practising military games on foot and\r\nhorseback in public, and also privately under superintendence of the\r\nMarquis of Pescara, who was then considered unequalled in them. He\r\nfrequently went out hunting with Don Carlos, by whom he was received\r\ninto much intimacy; and enjoyed a close friendship with Don John of\r\nAustria, afterwards the famed commander by sea and land. He also\r\npaid court to the ladies, and learned the sports of the jennet as\r\npractised there, from Don Pedro Enciquel, afterwards Count of Fuentes\r\nand general in Flanders.\r\n\r\n\"Some movements having occurred in Flanders, the King gave orders\r\nto proceed there, and the court, including Francesco Maria, made\r\npreparations to attend him. But the latter, wishing to see France,\r\nasked permission to take that route by land, and so to rejoin his\r\nMajesty, who was to go by sea. The King, desiring his attendance on\r\nhis person, refused his request, and so the opportunity was lost,\r\nto his great mortification, and perhaps to the no small loss of his\r\nMajesty. Subsequently occurred the imprisonment of Don Carlos, which\r\nwas thus effected by order of his own father. An hour after midnight,\r\nthe King, in his dressing-gown, holding a candle in his hand, having\r\ngone down to the Prince's room with his council of state and but one\r\ngentleman of his chamber, found him in bed. The Prince on seeing\r\nthem tried to reach the corner, where were his sword and a pair of\r\narquebuses, which he kept there always ready; but this was prevented\r\nby the Duke of Feria, who had already secured these arms. Then,\r\nrushing to his father, he exclaimed, 'So you are come to kill me?'\r\nTo this his Majesty replied, 'Not so, but because you must live as\r\nbecomes you, so be calm;' and never addressed him again. The Prince\r\nthen said, 'I see that I am taken for a madman, which I am not,\r\nthough a desperate one.' The King, having seen the doors and windows\r\nnailed up, leaving only a shutter open for light, and having desired\r\nthe arms and all such things to be taken away, returned to his\r\napartment, leaving with Don Carlos his major-domo Ruggo Mez de Silva\r\n(?) with several chamberlains and other officers of his household, a\r\nguard of Germans being stationed outside of his door; and the court\r\nwas greatly vexed thereat.\"\r\n\r\nThese details are curious, in illustration of the mysterious fate of\r\nDon Carlos, eldest son of Philip II. It seems agreed that he was of\r\na most unhappy temperament, perverse, wilful, and violent, possibly\r\ninsane. The immediate cause of the unnatural scene here described has\r\nnever been satisfactorily explained. It is generally stated that he\r\nwas discovered in treasonable correspondence with the Dutch; though\r\nothers have attributed the behaviour of his father to jealousy of an\r\nold attachment between his wife Elizabeth of Valois, and the Prince,\r\nto whom she was said to have been previously promised. The Prince's\r\narrest occurred in January 1568: it was followed by no trial or\r\npublic investigation, but in the following July he ceased to live.\r\nHis death was understood to have taken place under some judicial\r\nsanction, but whether by poison or the sword was never known. The\r\nentombment of his head separate from his body renders the second\r\nsupposition more probable.\r\n\r\nWe may here mention that, before embarking for Spain, the Prince\r\nhad, from his Cardinal uncle, the dukedom of Sora, yielding an\r\nincome of about 4000 scudi, which, however, proved quite inadequate\r\nto his expenditure. Zane, the Venetian ambassador, asserts that the\r\nlarge arrears of pay due to his father, which he was commissioned to\r\nrecover from the Spanish government, were more than absorbed by his\r\nextravagance, and that this was the reason of his recall. His own\r\nnarrative, however, is entirely silent upon this subject.\r\n\r\n\"Francesco Maria, having been at length recalled by his father, who\r\nwas anxious for the marriage of his only son and heir, took leave of\r\nthe King and Queen, and the royal family, and proceeded by Saragossa\r\nto Barcelona, where he embarked in a galley with the Marquis of\r\nPescara, then going as viceroy to Sicily. After a prosperous voyage\r\nof eight days, he reached Genoa, where he lived with Giovanni Andrea\r\nDoria, with whom he had become intimate at the court of Spain. Thence\r\nhe went to Milan for some days, and was welcomed with distinction;\r\nand then visited Madame of Austria at Piacenza; and at Parma stayed\r\nwith the Duke and his son, towards both of whom he maintained the\r\nbest intelligence and cousinship. He next passed through Bologna to\r\nRavenna, where his uncle, the Cardinal of Urbino, was archbishop, and\r\naccompanied him to Pesaro. He arrived on the 11th of July, 1568, and\r\nwas received with the greatest joy by all classes.\r\n\r\n\"After a few months, seeing that his father made no movement in the\r\naffair of his marriage, he returned to his studies, interrupted\r\nduring his absence from Italy. He read mathematics with Federigo\r\nComandino, and afterwards philosophy with Cesare Benedetti\r\n(subsequently Bishop of Pesaro), Felice Pacciotti, Giacomo Mazzoni,\r\nand Cristofero Guarimone. At the same time he kept up active exercise\r\nin arms, riding, hunting, ball, and racket.\" About this time\r\nMocenigo, the Venetian ambassador, praises his fine dispositions\r\nand pleasing manners, as well as his progress in various pursuits,\r\nespecially mathematics and fortification; but says that his eager\r\nexposure to fatigue gave rise to apprehensions for his health, which\r\nwere sadly realised. He adds that, since his return from Spain,\r\nsomething of the hauteur which characterised that nation was noticed\r\nin his manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Franz Hanfstaengl_\r\n\r\nISABELLA D'ESTE\r\n\r\n_After the picture by Titian in the Imperial Museum, Vienna_]\r\n\r\n\"Finally the Duke decided upon his marriage with Donna Lucrezia\r\nd'Este, sister of Alfonso, the last Duke of Ferrara, which took\r\nplace, though little to his taste; for she was old enough to have\r\nbeen his mother. He went for this purpose to Ferrara, where the\r\nnuptials were celebrated with great splendour, and with chivalrous\r\ngames and other festivities.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is all that we learn from the Memoirs of Francesco Maria\r\nregarding one of the most eventful moments of his life. Passeri, in\r\nhis collections for the life of Prince Federigo, mentions a rumour\r\nof his attachment to a lady at the Spanish court as the immediate\r\ncause of his recall home, and of the match with Princess Lucrezia\r\nbeing concluded; indeed, I have seen, in the correspondence of the\r\nOliveriana Library, that a certain Donna Madalena Girona was the\r\nsupposed object of that early affection. That he made no secret to\r\nhis father of his distaste at the connection laid out for him, is\r\nstated on the same authority, as well as the Duke's answer, that his\r\npeople's welfare was to be considered rather than his son's fancies,\r\nwhose youth made it the more requisite to mate him with a princess\r\nof tried prudence and staid manners. How far these epithets were\r\nborne out by Lucrezia's subsequent conduct will be presently seen;\r\nmeanwhile, the following letter, to one who long after continued an\r\nespecial friend and favourite, will show that the bridegroom gave no\r\noutward signs of his discontent.\r\n\r\n     \"To Camillo Giordani.\r\n\r\n     \"My most magnificent and well-beloved,\r\n\r\n     \"I am confident that you feel the pleasure which you\r\n     express at the conclusion which it has pleased God to\r\n     vouchsafe to my marriage with Madam Lucrezia d'Este, and\r\n     at all other like occasions of joy which happen to me; and\r\n     the duty you have in this instance paid me in your letter\r\n     has been most truly acceptable, and has my best thanks. God\r\n     ever bless you! From Pesaro, the last day of [15]69.\r\n\r\n     \"THE PRINCE OF URBINO.\"\r\n\r\nThe ceremony took place at Ferrara on the 2nd of January, 1571, and\r\non the 8th the bride was brought home to Pesaro. The people hailed\r\nher with enthusiasm, and spent largely in shows and rejoicings to\r\nwelcome her arrival, besides giving to the Duke a donative exceeding\r\n10,000 scudi. Yet Mocenigo, the Venetian ambassador accredited to\r\nthe marriage, while lauding the handsome and gracious Princess,\r\nadmits an early prepossession against her, on the part both of her\r\nnew subjects and her lord. It was the hope of a heir to the dukedom\r\nthat preponderated with the former; and, as she was many years older\r\nthan her husband, a chill of disappointment naturally mingled even\r\nwith their congratulations.[77] The same observer states it as the\r\ngeneral impression that, the Prince having compromised himself with\r\na lady in Spain, his father thought the best way of getting him out\r\nof all difficulty with that court was to match him suddenly with a\r\nprincess of high rank, whose dowry of 150,000 scudi was by no means\r\nunacceptable. Zane, another envoy from the maritime Republic a few\r\nyears later, describes the Duchess as below par in good looks, but\r\nwell-dressed: adding that difference of age accounted for the absence\r\nof affection between her and her husband.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: Tesoro Politico, II., fol. 169. Relazioni Venete, serie\r\nII., vol. II., p. 105. Litta says she was born the 16th December,\r\n1535, making her thirteen years and two months his senior. Her\r\nsister, Tasso's Leonora, was born the 19th of June, 1537.]\r\n\r\nThe following letters from the Duke and Duchess of Urbino,\r\nPrince Francesco Maria and his bride, were written in answer to\r\ncongratulations sent them on occasion of the marriage, by the\r\nCardinal de' Medici, who afterwards became Grand Duke of Florence,\r\nby the title of Ferdinand I.[78] They have been introduced here\r\nas an index to the feelings of the respective writers regarding\r\na union which turned out so unsatisfactory to all parties; but,\r\nstill more, as a specimen of the epistolary style then prevalent\r\nbetween personages of exalted rank, and of the general formality and\r\nbarrenness of interest which characterise such documents.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: Bibl.

A cloud of mystery hangs over\r\nthese transactions.\r\n\r\n\"Soon after his return to Pesaro from his marriage, the Pope,\r\nthe King of Spain, and the Venetians having [on the 20th of May]\r\nleagued together against the Turk, Don John of Austria came into\r\nItaly as commander-in-chief, and Francesco Maria, with his father's\r\npermission, set out on the 8th of July, to join him at Genoa. There\r\nhe embarked in the _Savoyard_ frigate[79] that had carried him to\r\nSpain, commanded by the same Monsignor de Leini, who had orders from\r\nthe Duke of Savoy to receive him with that affectionate courtesy\r\nwhich both he and his sovereign ever displayed towards him. Having\r\ntouched at Naples, he was there welcomed with the utmost favour and\r\ndistinction, and passed his time most agreeably. From thence the\r\nfleet sailed to Messina, where he assisted at a general council of\r\nwar, as indeed he often subsequently did.[80] Leaving Sicily, the\r\nexpedition in a few days arrived at Corfu, and on the morning of the\r\n7th of October fell in with the Turk. Don John drew up the Christian\r\nfleet in order of battle, the Proveditore Agostino Barbarigo, of\r\nVenice, having the landward squadron, and Giovanni Andrea Doria the\r\nopposite and heavier one, with Don Alvarez di Bassano as a reserve;\r\nthe centre he kept for himself, where was also Francesco Maria, in\r\nthe foresaid frigate. Here was the thick of the fight, as at this\r\npoint the two admirals met. The Turkish at first selected the frigate\r\nin which was Francesco Maria, whom he well knew, and who warmly\r\nreceived his attack; but as soon as he distinguished the flag-ship,\r\nhe turned to engage it: and, after fighting for two hours, the Turks\r\nstruck, their admiral, Pacha Ali, having been killed by an arquebus;\r\nthe others were all put to the sword; and so was this long very\r\ndoubtful victory secured to the Christians. Meanwhile the _Savoyard_\r\nfrigate fought two galleys, one ahead and the other astern, and\r\nhad enough to do, most of her company being killed or wounded. The\r\nsquadron under Barbarigo drove on shore many galleys, sinking and\r\ntaking others; but he was wounded by a splinter in the eye, of which\r\nhe soon after died. Doria had at first run out to sea, fighting all\r\nthe while; but seeing the wing exposed, he returned and made good\r\nuse of the opportunity, cutting up several galleys, and getting off\r\nuninjured. Such is an abstract of this battle, wherein Francesco\r\nMaria acquitted himself becomingly, for which Don John distinguished\r\nhim with many marks of regard, and assigned him, among other favours,\r\ntwenty-four Turkish slaves. The Admiral bearing for Sicily, he sailed\r\nfrom Corfu in a Venetian galley to Otranto, and returned home by land\r\nin November, to await orders, and rejoin the fleet the following\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: The word which I thus translate means literally a ship\r\nor galley commanded by a captain.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: The muster-roll of the armament at this time will be\r\nfound in V. of the Appendix.]\r\n\r\nThe naval engagement of which Francesco Maria has given the preceding\r\nsketch was that of Lepanto or Curzolari, where Passeri states that\r\nhe had with him a large body of his father's subjects, a fact which,\r\nalthough passed over in his own account of this his only military\r\nservice, is confirmed by Armanni, who tells us that there were in the\r\nfleet above fifty from Gubbio alone, thirty of whom were officers,\r\na circumstance on which the Prince was complimented by Don John.\r\nIt is unnecessary here to add to the Prince's details. The general\r\nresult of the engagement was most conclusive: the enemy's loss has\r\nbeen calculated at thirty thousand killed, ten thousand wounded, and\r\nfifteen thousand Christian slaves rescued from bondage, besides the\r\ndestruction or capture of six hundred sail, and a vast booty. The\r\nChristian fleet consisted of above two hundred war-galleys, besides\r\nmany other vessels of various sorts.\r\n\r\n\"On bringing his wife from Ferrara to Pesaro [in January, 1572], they\r\nwere magnificently received, and passed a gay carnival. In Lent he\r\nrepaired to Rome, after visiting the holy house of Loreto, and was\r\nthere entertained by his uncles, the Cardinals of Urbino and Farnese.\r\nPius V. insisted upon very graciously admitting him to an audience,\r\nnotwithstanding an illness of which he soon died....[81] Francesco\r\nMaria was also distinguished by his successor, Gregory XIII., but,\r\non suddenly being recalled by his father, he at once, though\r\nreluctantly, obeyed. Soon afterwards, he was attacked by a severe\r\nillness, which lasted for three months, aggravated by a false rumour\r\nof another naval engagement.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: Particulars of those intrigues in the conclave, by\r\nwhich Cardinal Buoncompagni prevailed over his rivals Morone and\r\nFarnese, are omitted, having no reference to our immediate subject.]\r\n\r\nThe part taken by the Prince in the unhappy disturbances of Urbino\r\nhas been already shown from his own pen, and that of other narrators,\r\nas well as his attendance upon his father's death-bed.[*82] We have\r\nnow, therefore, to enter upon his reign, and here again we have\r\nrecourse to his memoirs:--\"The new Duke departed from Urbino, where\r\nhe showed himself at the archiepiscopal palace in his robes of\r\nsovereignty, and then, as was usual, rode through the streets, on\r\na milk-white steed, dressed in white, and under canopy, thereafter\r\nreceiving the oaths of allegiance in the great hall of the palace:\r\nall this he repeated at Sinigaglia.\" Among the Oliverian MSS. is this\r\naccount of the ceremonial, curiously illustrative of the manners\r\nof the age:--\"After mass of the Holy Spirit had been sung, the\r\nArchbishop, Felice of Cagli, advanced to the door of the cathedral,\r\nand thence, accompanied by the Gonfaloniere, the three priors,\r\nand the people, went to bring forth the Prince from the palace.\r\nHe wore a riband and scarf of white damask; on his head a crown\r\nof pearls, from behind which there hung some bands; and on his\r\nshoulders a short cloak of white fur. When he reached the head of\r\nthe stair in the archiepiscopal palace, on which was a carpet and\r\na cushion, the Archbishop held the Cross for him to kiss. He then\r\nentered the church, and approached the high altar, on which was\r\nthe Holy Sacrament, where, after the usual devotions, accompanied\r\nwith beautiful sacred music, the Primate read certain prayers and\r\npronounced the benediction, and his Highness made offertory of a\r\npiece of ten scudi. He then retired to an adjoining chapel, and,\r\nchanging his dress, put on a mantle of white, with cap and feathers,\r\nin which he issued from the church, and mounted a handsome charger.\r\nThe Gonfaloniere preceded him on horseback, his drawn sword in his\r\nhand, calling aloud, 'Long live the Duke of Urbino!' and the people\r\nfollowed, repeating the cry. Thus they went through the city and\r\nreturned to the palace. The populace then took off his cloak; and\r\nM[aestr]o Antonio Fazino asked his cap, and received it. In like\r\nmanner he was stripped of his spurs; and his Highness then presented\r\nhis horse to the city youths, and Mo. Calber Galler mounted it. Mo.\r\nAntonio Corboli and the Cavaliere Guido Staccoli next put him on his\r\nspurs, Mo. Flaminio Bonaventura his mantle, and Mo. Antonio Fazino\r\nheld his horse. Having been by this formality elected, he went into\r\nthe great hall, where the Gonfaloniere and priors, with all the\r\ndeputies of other cities, by a formal instrument gave their oaths of\r\nallegiance, whilst he, in a letter read in his presence by Mo. Giulio\r\nVeterani, his secretary, promised to be to them a loving sovereign;\r\nafter which, all the people came one by one to kiss his hand. All\r\nthis was done with much rejoicing on the part of the public, and of\r\nhis Highness, to whom may God grant grace to rule his subjects to the\r\ncontentment of all.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote *82: Cf. CELLI, _Storia della Sollevazione di Urbino contro\r\nil Duca Guidobaldo, 1572-4_ (Torino, 1892).]\r\n\r\nThe following letter, to the young Duke upon his succession, is\r\nprinted in the correspondence of Girolamo Muzio, his preceptor, whose\r\nadvices, though somewhat long, well merit attention, totally opposed\r\nas they are in spirit to then prevailing principles of government,\r\nand anticipating opinions even in our day charily developed in Italy.\r\nIt is, above all, interesting to discover, on such satisfactory\r\nevidence, the political views which must have been inculcated on\r\nFrancesco Maria from his early years, and which bore some seed in\r\nafter life, notwithstanding the natural defects of his temper, and\r\nthe crotchets imbibed from a false philosophy. Had such counsels been\r\ngenerally given and followed, constitutional government in Italy\r\nwould now have been neither a mockery nor a bone of contention.\r\n\r\n     \"Men tried by difficulties and crosses nerve themselves\r\n     to endure them; yet, knowing how your Excellency has\r\n     long suffered from many troubles and annoyances, I shall\r\n     undertake no vain task in wishing to offer consolation in\r\n     this your new vexation and trial. I need not now say with\r\n     what grief I have heard of the late sad event, knowing\r\n     as you do how true a servant I was of his Excellency our\r\n     Sovereign. On the contrary, I shall address myself to talk\r\n     of certain considerations which appear to me beseeming the\r\n     succession you have obtained, through a long and noble\r\n     ancestry, meaning to speak to you with the freedom and\r\n     loyalty which a servant should display when his master's\r\n     interests are at stake; and upon this understanding I shall\r\n     begin.\r\n\r\n     \"I remember more than once, while conversing with the\r\n     illustrious Duchess your mother, to have lamented the\r\n     manner in which I observed the government of the state\r\n     conducted, praying the Almighty to protect you from the\r\n     risk of being expelled from it, as there would have been\r\n     no reasonable hope of the people recalling you again; a\r\n     fact of which her good sense was fully aware. It would be\r\n     long and irksome were I to repeat the various matters that\r\n     I disapproved of, but from them I can deduce certain rules\r\n     which it seems to me you ought to adopt for regulation of\r\n     your authority, and the maintenance of justice, so as to\r\n     reacquire and preserve the affection of your subjects. But,\r\n     Sire, permit me to drop ceremonious designations, in order\r\n     more readily to express my views.\r\n\r\n     \"Let it be your first care, then, to endow the magistrates\r\n     and city authorities with the ample jurisdiction which\r\n     their duties require, enjoining upon them to execute\r\n     justice without respect to persons; command also your\r\n     courtiers not to interfere in private suits, and do you in\r\n     like manner yourself forbear meddling with such, leaving\r\n     the judges to proceed therein by the usual course. Further,\r\n     should the judge be suspected by either party, let the\r\n     cause be remitted to another, or let an assessor be named;\r\n     and, to such alleged suspicion, it is no sufficient answer\r\n     that any one may be doubted by anybody. In short, it is\r\n     enough that the judges proceed to pronounce sentence in the\r\n     regular way; and for such as feel aggrieved, the common and\r\n     appropriate remedies are open. In my time the custom was\r\n     abolished--I know not at whose recommendation--of sending\r\n     causes to be inquired into by a council of skilled persons\r\n     [a jury?]; it was an excellent and much approved mode of\r\n     judging, and on that account it would be more advisable to\r\n     return to it than to leave it off. Statutory penalties have\r\n     also been changed to arbitrary ones, which has effected\r\n     great alterations; for where the statutes condemned ten,\r\n     caprice has multiplied by hundreds, with what justice I\r\n     know not. This was, indeed, by advice of certain doctors,\r\n     who declared that the Prince's will ought to be held as\r\n     law,--a diabolical sentiment, since it is not the absolute\r\n     will, but the virtuous and upright opinion of the Prince\r\n     that should be deemed law; nor do I see how any virtuous\r\n     and honest opinion can contravene statutes confirmed by\r\n     mutual agreement, and sanctioned by oaths.\r\n\r\n     \"Be specially attentive in hearing those who bring\r\n     complaints of oppression or injury received from your\r\n     ministers or courtiers, and refuse not to listen even to\r\n     such as accuse those most dear to you; on the contrary,\r\n     lend them all your ears, for in proportion as your\r\n     favourites can reckon upon you, they are likely to consider\r\n     themselves safe in committing outrages and insults. Think\r\n     not you can have about you persons who will never make a\r\n     slip, whether from love, or hatred, or dishonesty. Hear,\r\n     therefore, by all means hear, and punish him who has\r\n     either done amiss, or who has brought a false charge. And\r\n     such audiences you may give at all seasons and places,\r\n     even when going to mass, or in your moments of recreation,\r\n     without engaging yourself for a future day; for quarrels\r\n     may arise requiring prompt remedy, and which cannot wait a\r\n     future day or hour. By these means you may easily secure\r\n     the execution of justice, because there will eventually\r\n     not be many such disputes, when once, by a few examples of\r\n     severity, you have brought your magistrates, your court,\r\n     and consequently the rest of your subjects, into such\r\n     discipline that you will have few complaints to listen to,\r\n     and will be able to govern your state with little trouble.\r\n     But see in the commencement to give proof of your vigour,\r\n     that matters may subsequently proceed favourably.\r\n\r\n     \"When others have suffered injury or offence, do them\r\n     justice, punishing offenders for the general satisfaction;\r\n     for you may be sure that to visit offences committed upon\r\n     others protects yourself from the like, whilst impunity\r\n     gives security to offenders. In the matter of third\r\n     parties, clemency need not be thought of, forgiveness of a\r\n     fault being a favour bestowed, which affects the interest\r\n     of the party offended; thus, he who pardons injuries\r\n     done to me, disposes of what I alone should dispose of,\r\n     which is unjust. It may be well to remit injuries done to\r\n     yourself, for that is your own affair, and it is worthy of\r\n     a magnanimous prince to pardon when he might punish; but a\r\n     sovereign ought never to forgive offences against others\r\n     without their special consent, which cannot be freely given\r\n     if he intimates such to be his desire. Should disputes\r\n     arise among your people involving individual honour, you\r\n     must be judge of this, as much as of charges touching their\r\n     life and property. Indeed, you ought to decide judicially\r\n     as to whose reputation is intact and whose compromised; and\r\n     by chastising any unworthy action, you will at once promote\r\n     justice and give satisfaction to the injured party. I\r\n     am touching briefly upon matters which require ample\r\n     consideration, but it is enough that I moot certain points,\r\n     knowing well that you have good sense to weigh and decide\r\n     them. And now to pass to another topic.\r\n\r\n     \"You ought to calculate the amount of your revenues, and\r\n     so proportion your expenses that at the end of the year\r\n     you have rather a surplus of ten than a deficiency of one;\r\n     for a short-coming of one to-day, and another to-morrow,\r\n     and another the day following, will bring you to ruin.\r\n     Surround yourself with a court more distinguished by the\r\n     qualities than the number of its members; let it not be\r\n     larger than you can support, and see that you maintain\r\n     the mastery, letting none there gain an ascendancy over\r\n     you. Let each have his department, and be satisfied to do\r\n     his own duty well, the chamberlain not interfering with\r\n     the counsellor, nor the sewer with the secretary. See\r\n     that all have their allowances punctually. Never aggrieve\r\n     merchants, citizens, nor peasants, by laying hands upon\r\n     their effects. True generosity will satisfy first those\r\n     who have rightful claims, not squandering upon gamblers\r\n     or buffoons; and when these are satisfied, will give to\r\n     the needy, and to other works of charity. Do not, to gain\r\n     an empty name for liberality, lavish your means on costly\r\n     hospitalities towards great personages: those who have\r\n     hundreds of millions do not so, while you who scarcely have\r\n     tens would do it! Entertain the master at dinner or supper\r\n     with yourself, but let the rest go to the hotel at their\r\n     own expense, and so will you avoid vast trouble and great\r\n     expense.\r\n\r\n     \"In towns all innovations are unpopular and annoying,\r\n     but especially new imposts; you cannot do anything more\r\n     generally offensive than to raise them, nor more acceptable\r\n     than to replace on their original footing those which\r\n     have been augmented. New taxes and extraordinary escheats\r\n     seem at first sight useful, but by a providential\r\n     dispensation they absorb ordinary revenues, making\r\n     these incomprehensibly to disappear. Let all keep their\r\n     own; resort to no compulsion of property nor of person;\r\n     interfere not with marriages; seek not to reward friends\r\n     or benefit servants out of other people's means: and be it\r\n     ever graven on your memory, that princes are sent for the\r\n     people's weal, not people for the benefit of princes.\r\n\r\n     \"These few observations have occurred to me, most excellent\r\n     Sire, for your remembrance. And I have to observe generally\r\n     and in fine, that you should render yourself amiable to\r\n     your subjects, being kind, considerate, affable, and\r\n     doing your utmost to recover their pristine affection,\r\n     which appears to a great degree lost. You could not by\r\n     force maintain this state against a powerful foe: let the\r\n     attachment of your people then supplement your strength;\r\n     and it can only be acquired by justice, equity, mildness,\r\n     and clemency. In the present juncture, you might by a\r\n     single act gain, confirm, and augment the good will and\r\n     devotion of all your subjects. That act is a grand amnesty,\r\n     and restoration of exiles and emigrants, embracing all\r\n     as your children, forgetful of the past. Ah, do this,\r\n     Sire! do it; it will be a welcome favour to your people,\r\n     to your friends, to your servants. On the strength of\r\n     such generosity, you will gain the name of a benign and a\r\n     magnanimous prince; and, besides having to hope from the\r\n     Almighty an eternal reward, I can ensure your receiving\r\n     from the Pope thanks and approbation.\r\n\r\n     \"I pray God that this letter of mine may be received by\r\n     your Excellency with the same feelings as those which\r\n     dictated it, and that He would vouchsafe you a long life\r\n     and happy reign; and I kiss your hands. From Rome, the 11th\r\n     of October, 1574.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nDUKE FRANCESCO MARIA II. RECEIVING THE ALLEGIANCE OF HIS FOLLOWERS\r\n\r\n_After the fresco by Girolamo Genga in the Villa Imperiale, Pesaro_]\r\n\r\nLet us now see from his own narrative what effect these blunt but\r\nprecious counsels, and the prudent advices of his uncle Ottavio,\r\nDuke of Parma, had upon his early measures. \"His first act on\r\nassuming the government was to raze those fortifications at Urbino\r\nwhich had been made during the insurrection, and to reduce the impost\r\nlaid on by his father in his necessity; and this although the late\r\nDuke's liberality had imposed upon him many burdensome expenses\r\nto which his revenues were scarcely equal, besides heavy debts at\r\ninterest. He was thus obliged to restrict himself to the unavoidable\r\nstate expenses.\r\n\r\n\"Further, he was disappointed of those aids he looked for from the\r\nkindness of his Catholic Majesty, in whose service his father had\r\ndied, at whose court he had himself been brought up, for whom he had\r\nfought in the battle of Lepanto, and to whose service he had ever\r\nprofessed his intention steadily to adhere. But, during eight long\r\nyears his hopes dragged on without any result from that quarter,\r\nand thus was he compelled to attend closely to his private affairs,\r\nand prevented from carrying into execution an intention he had\r\nalways entertained of following the career of arms, which he was on\r\nthe point of commencing in Flanders, where he was already looked\r\nfor when he lost his father. He, however, succeeded in contenting\r\nhis subjects, and in effacing from their minds whatever bitterness\r\nremained in consequence of the recent measures; and this chiefly from\r\ntheir being aware that these events had been displeasing to him, and\r\nthat he had studied to assist their cause in so far as his parental\r\nduty permitted.\"\r\n\r\nThe moderate and self-denying measures to which the Duke thus\r\nmodestly alludes are the subject of more detailed commendation by\r\nZane, who was commissioned by the Venetians to congratulate him upon\r\nhis succession. At the moment of receiving the oaths of fidelity, he\r\nabolished those imposts which had occasioned the recent discontents.\r\nThey were five in number, all upon exciseable commodities, yielding\r\nabout 16,000 scudi to the revenue. This course he followed up\r\nby various grants and immunities to the respective cities, but\r\nespecially to Urbino. Even before his father's death he had obtained\r\na commutation there of the duties on casking wine and cheese, and\r\nof the quatrino per lb. upon butcher-meat, for an equivalent of\r\n20,000 scudi payable in ten years; but he now remitted entirely this\r\ncontribution. He restored to their property and privileges most\r\nof the outlaws and their families; he recalled the proclamations\r\ndisarming the district; and, by destroying the fortifications erected\r\nafter the rebellion, he at once relieved the people of a garrison,\r\nand demonstrated his renewed confidence in their fidelity. But what\r\nhad still happier effect, was his repeatedly visiting that capital\r\nwith but one or two attendants, in full and well-placed reliance upon\r\nthe affection of his subjects, of whom he ever spoke in public and\r\nprivate with the most affectionate regard. Himself deeply imbued with\r\nsentiments of religion, it was his aim to encourage the same among\r\nhis people. Nor was he indifferent to personal accomplishments, or\r\nto the reputation which his predecessors had established, and which\r\nCastiglione has immortalised. \"There are ever at his court some\r\npersons distinguished in arms or in letters, and it is the taste for\r\nall to cultivate a refined urbanity of manner, and to be in every\r\nrespect perfect courtiers, a fashion of old observance there, yet\r\nmore than ever in repute since the Prince visited Spain.\" But it is\r\ntime to resume the Autobiography.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nDUKE FRANCESCO MARIA II. RECEIVING THE ALLEGIANCE OF HIS FOLLOWERS\r\n\r\n_After the fresco by Girolamo Genga in the Villa Imperiale, Pesaro_]\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding this state of affairs, he discovered a conspiracy\r\nagainst his person, originating with men who had reason to apprehend\r\nthe consequences of their former proceedings. These were Pietro\r\nBonarelli of Ancona, on whom the late Duke had bestowed the countship\r\nof Orciano, with other estates and great wealth, and Antonio\r\nStati, Count of Montebello. Orciano saved himself by flight, and\r\nwas condemned in absence; the other was put upon trial, and at\r\nlength, in due execution of justice, he was beheaded, and some of\r\nhis accomplices hanged.[83] Francesco Maria, nevertheless, laboured\r\nfor the good government of his people, with due economy of his time.\r\nIn the morning he gave audience to his counsellors and secretaries,\r\nand in the evening to all who desired it, dismissing these with\r\ndespatch; and thus business went on well and rightly.\" We are told by\r\nGozze,[84] who seems to have been a contemporary, that at this period\r\nhe occupied himself much with criminal police, and exerted himself to\r\nrepress brigandage, and to reform the abuses arising from privileged\r\nsanctuaries. His rigorous perseverance in such measures, and his\r\nstern demeanour towards the nobility, acquired for him, with many,\r\na reputation for severity, which the infirmities of his temper must\r\nhave served to confirm. The only other reference to his system of\r\nadministration which the Autobiography contains, is as follows:--\"He\r\nattended assiduously to the government of his state, maintaining\r\npeace, and administering justice with integrity and impartiality. He\r\npassed the summer at Urbino, the winter between Pesaro and Castel\r\nDurante. At intervals he visited his other residences, and when he\r\nomitted doing this in person, he despatched one of the judges on a\r\nsort of circuit, who in one year went to Gubbio, Cagli, Fossombrone,\r\nand La Pergola; in another to Sinigaglia and Mondavio; and in a third\r\nto the province of Montefeltro.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: The object of this plot is stated to have been the\r\nDuke's assassination at a hunting party in the manors of Orciano, to\r\nwhich he was invited by the conspirators.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: MSS. Oliveriana No. 324.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\n     The unsatisfactory results of his marriage--He separates\r\n     from the Duchess--His court and habits--Death of the\r\n     Duchess--He remarries.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus thrown together all that the Duke has thought fit to\r\ndetail regarding the principles of his government and the early\r\nevents of his reign, we now proceed to narrate in their order, from\r\nhis Diary and from other sources, the few incidents afforded by\r\nthose peaceful and monotonous pursuits wherein many subsequent years\r\nwere passed. The first of these was of a painful domestic character,\r\narising out of the unsatisfactory terms upon which he had during\r\nseveral years been with the Duchess. That love formed no ingredient\r\nin the match has been already shown, and perhaps his speedy and\r\nvoluntary departure on a distant military expedition may be taken\r\nas a proof that his indifference did not diminish after wedlock had\r\nriveted his chains. In 1573, Lucrezia was laid up at Novilara with\r\na feverish cold, and was attended by her husband, who with great\r\nreluctance consented to her return to Ferrara, on the excuse of\r\nchange of air being requisite for re-establishment of her health. The\r\ntruth seems to have been, that her marriage appearing unlikely to\r\ngive an heir to the family, the Prince was confirmed in his original\r\ndistaste, and this is said to have occasioned some disagreeable\r\nscenes with his father, whom he blamed for having forced upon him\r\nso unfortunate an alliance. The scandal to which these probably\r\ngave rise, and the example of coldness towards her which he most\r\nassuredly set, had, no doubt, rendered her position sufficiently\r\nunpleasant, and, after exchanging it for the freedom of her brother's\r\nelegant court, it is scarcely to be wondered that she hesitated to\r\nreturn, even after her husband had succeeded to the sovereignty of\r\nUrbino. That rumour was busy with gossip and conjectures is pretty\r\nobvious, and the countenance which Muratori gives to an allegation\r\nof Lucrezia's jealousy of his supposed infidelities may be taken as\r\nthe version current at Ferrara of their mysterious non-adherence. Of\r\nthis suspicion the life and character of Francesco afford an ample\r\nrefutation, but its existence induced an endeavour on his part to\r\nbring about a better understanding with his wife.\r\n\r\nIn 1577, accordingly, he employed the Bishop of Pesaro and\r\nFather-general del Carmine to persuade her to return to his home.\r\nIn a paper of instructions for their guidance, preserved among the\r\nOliveriana MSS., he declares that the excuses she pleaded were of\r\nno weight, and could not be the real motives of her absence. In\r\nreference to pecuniary arrangements, he urges the great economy and\r\nself-denial which his father's embarrassments imposed upon him, but\r\noffers her the same establishment as his mother enjoyed, besides\r\nNovilara and its dependencies, in all about 6000 scudi a-year.\r\nBut, in consideration of the slanderous and groundless imputations\r\nagainst himself to which her absence had given rise, he intimates his\r\nintention to select for her a suitable suite of respectable persons,\r\nleaving her, however, to choose eight or ten from them to be more\r\nimmediately about her person. This negotiation having failed, the\r\naffair was next year submitted for the decision of Cardinals Farnese,\r\nSforza, and d'Este: it would appear that an amicable separation was\r\nthen determined upon; at all events, the Duchess returned no more to\r\nher husband's state.\r\n\r\nThe notice of this disagreeable topic in the diary of Francesco\r\nMaria is as follows:--\"Meanwhile the Duchess wished to return to\r\nFerrara, where she subsequently chose to remain, a resolution which\r\ngave no annoyance to her husband; for, as she was unlikely to bring\r\nhim a family, her absence mattered little. Her provision was amicably\r\narranged, and their intercourse continued uniformly on the most\r\ncourteous terms.\" In support of this last statement the following\r\nletter from Lucrezia is conclusive.\r\n\r\n     \"To the most serene Lord my Consort the Duke of Urbino.\r\n\r\n     \"My most serene Lord and affectionate Consort,\r\n\r\n     \"I could not have heard any message with more satisfaction\r\n     than that which Count Alessandro della Massa has brought me\r\n     in your Highness's name, on presenting your affectionate\r\n     letters, nor could any present have been more gratifying\r\n     than the picture which you were pleased to send me: both\r\n     on account of its subject, and as coming from your hands,\r\n     it will be ever the most valued that I possess. On all\r\n     accounts, therefore, do I kiss your Highness's hand,\r\n     recommending myself to your goodness; and I pray the Lord\r\n     to preserve you ever in all happiness. From Ferrara, 28th\r\n     of May, 1586.\r\n\r\n     \"Your most loving and obedient consort and servant,\r\n\r\n     \"LUCREZIA D'ESTE.\"\r\n\r\nThe Oliveriana MSS. contain many other letters from Lucrezia; but, as\r\nusual with such princely documents, they are more rich in mannered\r\nphrases of compliment than in those natural sentiments which form\r\nthe charm of epistolary composition, and afford a correct index of\r\nindividual character. Most of them are commendatory introductions\r\nof priests and friars, a class of acquaintances more congenial\r\nto her husband's disposition than her own, the chief foible in\r\nher character being an immoderate addiction to those festive and\r\nexciting pleasures, which, although the business of her brother's\r\ncourt, met with little encouragement at that of her consort. Her\r\nintercourse with Tasso will fall to be noticed in our fifty-first\r\nchapter, when describing the sorrows of that wayward genius. After\r\nher return to Ferrara, she interested herself in establishing at\r\nSan Matteo an asylum for wives, who, like herself, were separated\r\nby incompatibility of character. Soon after his separation from\r\nthe Duchess had been arranged, Francesco Maria paid a visit to the\r\ncourt of Tuscany, where he met with a distinguished reception, and\r\nspent fifteen days very agreeably amid the many attractions of\r\nFlorence, varied by comedies and amusements of the chase. During the\r\nensuing carnival he introduced unwonted gaiety at Pesaro, holding\r\na tournament, at which he entered the lists in person. About this\r\ntime, too, his finances were recruited by a donative of 10,000 scudi\r\ngranted to him by that city.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anderson_\r\n\r\nFRANCESCO I. DE' MEDICI\r\n\r\n_After the picture by Bronzino in the Pitti Gallery, Florence_]\r\n\r\nThe Duke's autograph Diary, from which we have recently quoted,\r\nand to which we shall frequently refer, having been carried to\r\nFlorence with his other personal effects in 1631, remains in the\r\nMagliabechiana Library (Class xxv., No. 76). It is a narrow folio\r\nvolume, like an index book, containing about two hundred pages\r\nentirely in his own hand. The entries are limited to a bare notice\r\nof facts without comment. The topics most frequently registered are\r\nthe passage of remarkable strangers through Pesaro; the births,\r\nmarriages, and deaths of persons of rank; his own periodical\r\nmovements to his various residences, and visits to other parts of the\r\nduchy; his frequent hunting parties in autumn and winter, chiefly\r\nfrom Castel Durante; his taking medicine, including regular semestral\r\npurgations in spring and autumn. His taste for the physical sciences\r\nis illustrated by noting the occurrence of earthquakes, unusual\r\nstorms, or other phenomena of nature, the recurrence of frost and\r\nsnow, of the cigala and the nightingale, of mosquitoes, and similar\r\nsigns of the seasons; also the appearance of any rare animal or\r\nmonstrous production of nature. The Journal commences in April, 1583,\r\nand is continued without interruption until March, 1623, when it\r\nterminates abruptly.\r\n\r\nThe disappointment felt by the Duke at the fruitlessness of his\r\nfamily friendship with the crown of Spain was removed by receiving,\r\ntowards the close of 1582, a military commission from his Catholic\r\nMajesty. This was the only relic of the condottiere system that\r\nsurvived the changes of the sixteenth century upon the political\r\nand military aspect of Europe. It was the intervening link between\r\nmercenary bands of the middle ages and standing armies of modern\r\ntimes. No plan could have better suited all parties. The great\r\npowers were thus enabled to command on sudden exigencies an ample\r\nforce, without waste of time or treasure. The petty sovereigns by it\r\neked out their inadequate revenues, without further burden to their\r\nsubjects than an occasional call upon the military services of those\r\nwho regarded arms as a pastime, and whose restless spirits, if not\r\nthus employed, would have been dangerous at home. The people, without\r\nabandoning the arts of peace, reaped a portion of the fruits of war.\r\nThese benefits were, indeed, purchased by a surrender of the last\r\nvestige of independence, for the salary paid to the princes in name\r\nof stipend was, in fact, the price of their political subserviency.\r\nYet it was but a nominal compromise, to sell the shadow when the\r\nsubstance had long departed; and we find the example of Spain in\r\nretaining friends throughout La Marca, for pecuniary considerations,\r\nrecommended for the imitation of Venice by one of her ambassadors\r\nabout this very time. The conditions of the Duke's service were\r\nan annual pay of 12,000 scudi, which, in 1599, was augmented to\r\n15,000, a company of men-at-arms in the kingdom of Naples, and ample\r\nprotection in all his undertakings; in return for which he was bound\r\nto provide, when called upon by Philip II., three thousand militia,\r\nand to take the field with them when his Majesty appeared there in\r\nperson. The amount of troops thus actually raised in the duchy for\r\nthe Spanish service during the next thirty years has been calculated\r\nat seven thousand two hundred men, a sufficient proof that the\r\nbenefits accruing from the arrangement were mutual. The Pope now\r\ngranted Francesco Maria the honourable prefix of \"Most Serene\" to the\r\ntitle of Highness, which he had enjoyed in common with other minor\r\nsovereigns, a distinction said to have been accorded with difficulty,\r\nand after long entreaty. The establishment of a Swiss guard is\r\nanother illustration of his partiality at this period to pomps which\r\nhe subsequently little esteemed.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, the court of Pesaro was enlivened by the\r\nPrincess Lavinia's nuptials with Felice d'Avalos, Marquis del Vasto,\r\nwhen twelve poetesses were said to have tuned their lyres at the\r\nImperiale, in honour of the joyous occasion. His marriage presents\r\nto his bride, mentioned in her brother's Diary, consisted of a\r\nnecklace of jewels, a bag or muff of sable skin--the head and feet\r\nstudded with precious stones, called a _zebellino_, and similar to\r\nthat represented in Titian's beautiful portrait of her grandmother,\r\nDuchess Leonora,--a set of fan-sticks, a gem mounted as a sun, two\r\npearls for ear-drops, a diamond cross and eagle, and an order for\r\n3000 scudi: the whole was valued at 10,000 scudi. The happy pair\r\nspent some months at the court of Urbino, while the Marquis often\r\njoined the hunting parties from Castel Durante. But the sun that rose\r\nthus brightly was soon clouded by his wretched and tyrannical temper,\r\nwhich embittered his consort's life. Many years after, she married,\r\nin her widowhood, the gallant Marquis of Pescara, her brother's\r\nlong-tried friend, and, finally, with her two daughters, sought\r\nrepose and peace in the convent of Sta. Chiara at Urbino, where\r\nshe died in 1633. In the end of 1583 the Duke began to build the\r\nVedetta, on the most commanding eminence of Monte Bartolo, which he\r\nhad obtained for this purpose from the Gerolimini convent. Of this\r\ncasino only the foundation remains, but it would seem to have been an\r\nappendage of the Imperiale palace, whither the court ascended in the\r\nsummer heats, to inhale gentle breezes from the blue Adriatic, which\r\nsparkled some hundred feet beneath. For such a purpose no spot could\r\nhave been better chosen, and the magnificent prospect, which we have\r\nelsewhere noticed without attempting to describe, renders it probably\r\nthe most attractive site in all the fair duchy.\r\n\r\nAs a further mark of favour, Philip II. of Spain sent him, in 1586,\r\nthe decoration of the Golden Fleece; and in order to confer it in\r\nmanner at once honourable and complimentary to his personal feelings,\r\nhis Majesty requested the investiture to be given him by his uncle\r\nthe Duke of Parma. That Duke was then suffering from gout, and\r\ndrawing towards his death, which occurred in the following autumn;\r\nso Francesco Maria showed respect at once for the King and for his\r\nrelation, whom he revered as a parent, by proceeding to meet him\r\nat Bologna. The two princely guests were magnificently entertained\r\nby the authorities of that city, as well as by the Cardinal Legate\r\nSalviati and the Archbishop Palotta: they were lodged in the\r\npalace of the latter, who performed high mass in the cathedral at\r\nthe investiture. The collar and girdle of the order were set with\r\nbrilliants, and were accompanied by a rich present of jewels to\r\nthe Duchess, consisting of four hundred and twenty-six pearls, and\r\na handsome necklace, girdle, two pendants, and sixty buttons, all\r\nenamelled in red and white upon gold, and studded with diamonds.\r\n\r\nAlthough, on the whole, a more popular sovereign than his father, we\r\nhave seen Francesco Maria subjected, in the early years of his reign,\r\nto seditious movements on the part of some discontented nobles. Of\r\na similar attempt in 1586, few particulars have been preserved; but\r\nthis notice of it in his Diary exhibits him as a stern dispenser of\r\njustice. \"Count Giovanni de' Thomasi was beheaded in the fortress\r\nof Pesaro for homicide, sedition, and bad service towards his\r\nmaster; he died as a Christian and a brave man, and may God pardon\r\nhis sins.\" But, though of hard, and even stern manners, the Duke\r\nretained the affection of his household, most of whom remained\r\nlong in his service. From a catalogue of the chief officers at his\r\ncourt, compiled by Lazzari, we learn the emoluments belonging to the\r\nprincipal places.\r\n\r\n                                                    _Scudi._\r\n\r\n  The superintendent of the household had yearly      1000\r\n  The master of the chamber                            400\r\n  The master of the household                          200\r\n  The gentlemen cuirassiers                            250\r\n  The chamberlains                                     224\r\n  The sewer or carver for visitors                     250\r\n  The philosopher or dilettante of poetry              300\r\n  The physician                                        250\r\n  The chaplain                                         150\r\n  The auditors or judges                               500\r\n  The eight counsellors                                400\r\n  The chief secretary                                  400\r\n  The secretary of justice                             350\r\n  The treasurer                                        250\r\n  The fiscal advocate                                  350\r\n  The captains of the guard                            232\r\n  The commandants of garrisons                         300\r\n  The castellans, besides perquisites                  150\r\n  The ambassador to Spain                             1000\r\n  The ambassador to Venice                             400\r\n  The agent in Rome                                    100\r\n\r\nFrancesco Maria had now reached the flower of manhood, and this may\r\nbe considered the most fortunate period of his reign. During the next\r\ntwelve years no untoward incident interrupted the smooth current of\r\nhis life, or the prosperity of his government. The healthful exercise\r\nof the chase constituted his favourite relaxation from the cares\r\nof state, and his Diary preserves more minute information on this\r\nthan on any other topic. He had within reach of Pesaro eighteen\r\npreserves, stocked with roe-deer, goats, foxes, hares, pheasants, and\r\npartridges, all of which were, in those days, considered fair game.\r\nThe more exciting sport of wild-boar was found in greatest perfection\r\nnear Mondolfo, and the following entry occurs in January, 1588.\r\n\"Hunted in the chase of S. Costanzo, and, in three hours, killed\r\nnine wild boars, weighing 2580 lbs., besides offal. The largest one\r\nweighed overhead 917 lbs. We cut off its head close behind the ears,\r\nand hung it in the castle window over the great street of Mondolfo;\r\nits weight was 59-1/2 lbs.\"\r\n\r\nBut red deer were the Duke's noblest and favourite sport, which,\r\nbeing only found in the highlands of his duchy, was his original\r\nattraction to Castel Durante, whence the best forest coverts were\r\neasily accessible. It was on that account selected as his chief\r\nresidence during his father's life, and continued his annual resort\r\nin autumn so long as he could follow the game. When increasing\r\nyears precluded such pastimes, we shall find that he there provided\r\nother appliances more befitting his circumstances, and that these\r\npreserved for Castel Durante a partiality which increased to the\r\nlatest hours of his life. He was in use there to spend the autumnal\r\nmonths, returning to Pesaro before the carnival, and moving to Urbino\r\ntowards midsummer. In the interval from the 7th of September, 1588,\r\ntill the end of the following January, twenty-eight hunting parties\r\nare mentioned in his Journal, at some of which wolves and smaller\r\ngame were killed. Red deer must have been in great abundance: thus,\r\nNovember, 1587, \"We killed a dozen, six of them males, the largest\r\nweighing 464 lbs., besides 380 lbs. of offal. We left Castel Durante\r\nabout noon, and returned at dusk, after losing nearly an hour in\r\nwatching a hind which took refuge in the broken ground of the Lady's\r\nPark, when fell dead the famous hound Box-cur, the only British one\r\nI had. The twelve deer weighed 2914 lbs., without offal.\" In the\r\nsubsequent season, \"hunted red deer in the valley of S. Martino\r\nwith greyhounds, but without canvas or nets. Saw twelve, and chased\r\nfive of them; but, though the dogs came up with them, they were not\r\nable to hold any.\" The park which he had inclosed in the beautiful\r\nvale of the Metauro, just out of Castel Durante, was stocked with\r\nfallow-deer: which, however, seem to have been kept chiefly for\r\nornament, though occasionally resorted to for greyhound coursing,\r\nwhen age had relaxed his limbs for the rougher mountain sport. The\r\nlast hunting party he mentions was in 1615.\r\n\r\nThough reserved in manner, and little apt to indulge his court\r\nin amusements uncongenial with his own unsocial temperament, he\r\nsometimes relaxed so far as to have dancing fêtes at the Imperiale,\r\nwhere he mentions three hundred ladies as having on one occasion\r\nbeen present. The representation of comedies was a frequent\r\ncarnival pastime. The manner of conducting these theatricals, and\r\nthe methodical punctuality of the Duke's character, are at once\r\nillustrated in the following extract. In February, 1589, \"a comedy\r\nby the late Maestro Fabio Bagnano was recited in the great hall of\r\nPesaro, beginning at 4 p.m. The first act lasted an hour and ten\r\nminutes; after which came an interlude for twenty minutes, from\r\nthe fable of Ulysses hearing his wanderings foretold by Tiresias;\r\nthen act second, in fifty minutes, with a musical interlude for ten\r\nminutes; then act third, in half-an-hour, with, for interlude, the\r\nmarriage of Eolus and Deiopeia, in twelve minutes; then act fourth,\r\nin forty-eight minutes, and its musical interlude, in seven minutes;\r\nlastly, act fifth, in thirty-eight minutes, with its interlude of the\r\ngods allotting their various dominions; but this was not finished in\r\nconsequence of a cloud which, by some mismanagement, did not descend\r\nproperly.\" Among the performances noted about this period are the\r\ncomedies of _I falsi Sospetti_ by Pino; another by the Cavaliere\r\nLudovico Odasio, _I Suppositi_; and an eclogue entitled _La Myrtia_.\r\nThe interludes between the acts were frequently moresque dances or\r\nballets representing mythological subjects, such as the fable of\r\nPrometheus, that of Calisto, the birth of Venus; varied by more\r\nfamiliar themes, as hunting the owl. In 1597, we find noticed, among\r\nother gay doings during carnival, a tournament in the great hall of\r\nPesaro, wherein ten or twelve knights ran each three courses, and\r\nwhich was followed by an exhibition of various pleasing conceits.\r\n\r\nOf Francesco Maria's literary pursuits we have various pleasing\r\nmemorials. Not satisfied with the valuable library of MSS. that\r\nhad descended to him from the Feltrian dukes, he formed another\r\nof standard printed works. Indeed, he became an assiduous book\r\ncollector; and the letters of his librarian Benedetto Benedetti,\r\nin the Oliveriana Library, are full of lists which his agents in\r\nVenice, Florence, and even Frankfort are urged to supply. In his\r\nown voluminous correspondence, we find constant offers from authors\r\nof dedications or copies of their productions, the tone of which\r\nis highly complimentary to his taste for letters. In 1603, the\r\nArchbishop of Monreale, in Spain, transmits him the regulations he\r\nproposed to prescribe in bequeathing his library to a seminary he\r\nhad founded in his diocese, expressing a hope that they might prove\r\nuseful to the Duke's collection, \"at this moment without parallel in\r\nthe world.\"[85] Instead of quoting the vague testimony of courtly\r\ncompliment, as to the use which this philosophic Prince made of\r\nthese acquisitions, let us cite the brief records of his studies,\r\npreserved in his own Diary. In 1585, \"terminated an inspection of\r\nthe whole works of Aristotle, on which I have laboured no less than\r\nfifteen years, having had them generally read to me by Maestro Cesare\r\nBenedetti, of Pesaro.\" But his reading was not limited to such\r\nspeculative topics, and we presently find him imbibing knowledge from\r\na purer source. In 1587, \"I finished my examination of the whole\r\nBible, with various commentaries, on which I have spent three years\r\nand ten months.\" Again, on the \"15th of December, 1598, completed\r\nmy second perusal of the entire Bible, which I read this time with\r\nthe commentary of Dionysio the Carthusian, occupying upon it eight\r\nyears.\" A curious inference of the contemplative character of his\r\nmind may be drawn from the devices he successively assumed as\r\nemblematic of his feelings. In youth he used a flame vanishing into\r\nair, with the motto _Quies in sublime_, \"There is rest on high:\"\r\nafter he succeeded to the dukedom, he took a terrestrial globe with\r\nthe legend _Ponderibus librata suis_, \"Self-poised.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: Bibl. Oliveriana, No. 375, vol. XI., p. 204.]\r\n\r\nThe position of Pesaro, on the principal high road to Loreto and\r\nRome, exposed it to the constant passage of travellers of all ranks.\r\nThe former was the habitual resort of Roman Catholics, to whom holy\r\nimpulses, the hope of any specific blessing, or gratitude for mercies\r\nvouchsafed, suggested an unusual devotional observance. The annual\r\nfunctions of Easter, St. Peter's day, and Christmas, besides the\r\ngreat occasional jubilees, attracted to the latter crowds of pious\r\npilgrims from all Christendom. The dukes were thus laid open to\r\nfrequent calls upon their hospitality, which the state maintained by\r\npassing visitors often rendered most onerous. Thus, in 1589, Duke\r\nAlfonso II. of Ferrara, on his way to and from Loreto, spent four\r\ndays at Pesaro, with his suite, consisting of fifty carriages, and\r\none hundred and fifty mounted attendants, at an expense to his host\r\nof 3000 scudi. All royal pilgrims did not, however, thus mingle\r\nworldly pomp with religious duties: ten years after, Ranuccio, Duke\r\nof Parma, arrived incognito, in company with three others, who wore\r\nred sack dresses, and travelled on foot. After passing the night at\r\nPesaro, they proceeded to Sinigaglia, on their way to the opening\r\nof the holy door at Rome, in the jubilee of 1600. Eighteen years\r\nlater, Francesco Maria's Diary thus notes a more interesting visit:\r\n\"9th June, 1618, the Galileo arrived at Pesaro, on his return from\r\nLoreto to Florence.\" The philosopher was then resident at the Villa\r\nSegni, near his native capital, and suffered much from the effects\r\nof a chronic illness caught in Lombardy some years previously, while\r\nsleeping with an open window. Perhaps his pilgrimage to the holy\r\nhouse may have been influenced by this circumstance.\r\n\r\n     \"'Twas he who, risking life and fame to crush\r\n     The idol-worship that enslaved mankind,\r\n     Restored its native freedom to the mind.\"\r\n\r\nIn October, 1597, the direct line of the dukes of Ferrara closed on\r\nthe death of Alfonso II., whose object had been to secure to his\r\ncousin Cesare, Marquis of Montecchio, the succession of his states,\r\nas well as his private heritage. He had been able to obtain from the\r\nEmperor a new investiture in his favour of Modena, Reggio, and Carpi,\r\nbut failed in procuring the like boon from Gregory XIV. as to the\r\nFerrarese holding. Immediately upon the vacancy, Cesare assumed the\r\ndukedom, with full consent of his people, who dreaded the descent\r\nto provincial rank which must have followed upon their annexation\r\nto the papal state. Clement VIII., who then filled the chair of St.\r\nPeter, answered a conciliatory embassy sent him by the claimant, with\r\na summons to appear at Rome, and, on his non-compliance, thundered\r\nexcommunication against him and his abettors. These decided steps\r\nwere followed up by a levy of nearly thirty thousand men, but ere\r\nthey could be brought into the field, Cesare d'Este gained some\r\npartial successes near Bologna. Finding, however, that his position\r\nwas hopeless, he availed himself of the mediation of Lucrezia\r\nDuchess of Urbino, who succeeded in reconciling him with the Legate.\r\nThe devolution of Ferrara to the Holy See was harmoniously completed\r\nin February; but the lady has been accused of sacrificing the\r\ninterests of her cousin to an old grudge against his father, and to\r\na promise of the fief of Bertinoro. She did not, however, live to\r\nreceive the bribe, and her death is thus dryly noted in her husband's\r\nDiary:--\r\n\r\n\"February 14th, I sent the Abbé Brunetti to Ferrara, to visit the\r\nDuchess, my wife, who was sick.\r\n\r\n\"---- 15th, Heard that Madame Lucrezia d'Este, Duchess of Urbino, my\r\nwife, died at Ferrara during the night of the 11th.\r\n\r\n\"---- 19, The Abbé Brunetti returned from Ferrara.\"\r\n\r\nIn his Memoirs she is the subject of still more brief remark:--\"Her\r\ndeath occurred after some years, leaving him [the Duke] executor\r\nby her will of many pious bequests.\" Considering that the largest\r\nbequest was in his own favour, a less chilling notice might have\r\nbeen bestowed! The sum she left him was 30,000 scudi: to her various\r\nattendants and servants she gave 12,000 in small legacies, and 20,000\r\namong several convents, in masses for her soul. There was also a fund\r\nto be mortified for the endowment of poor girls, half at Ferrara and\r\nhalf at Urbino, and Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini, the Pope's nephew,\r\nwas named residuary legatee, a selection which has been ingeniously\r\nascribed to the countenance bestowed by his family on Tasso, in the\r\nclosing scenes of that minstrel's troubled life.\r\n\r\nThe anxiety which had long been generally felt on the prospect of\r\na failure of the ducal family began to show itself after the death\r\nof Lucrezia. The impediment of a childless marriage having thus\r\nbeen providentially removed, men's hopes were again awakened, and\r\ntheir wishes were not long in finding a unanimous expression. When\r\nFrancesco Maria appeared in public, his ears were greeted with\r\nmurmurs from the populace, which at length broke out in enthusiastic\r\ndemands for his marriage, and _Serenissimo, moglie_, \"A wife, your\r\nHighness,\" became the universal cry.[*86] The ferment thus created\r\nwas greatly increased by a circumstance which at first sight does\r\nnot appear much connected with the welfare of the duchy. In the\r\nspring of 1598, Clement VIII., on his passage to take possession of\r\nFerrara, paid a visit to the court of Pesaro, where the magnificent\r\nreception accorded him, and the long confidential interviews he had\r\nwith the Duke, were construed by popular jealousy into preparatives\r\nfor political changes. The extinction of the reigning line would\r\ninfer a lapse of their sovereignty to the Pope, similar to that which\r\nhad just degraded Ferrara: Francesco Maria's disinclination for\r\nstate-toils had already begun to show itself: the readiness of his\r\nHoliness to secure so valuable a reversion, or even to anticipate it\r\nby providing for the Duke an honourable retreat from duties which\r\nhe considered onerous, scarcely admitted of a doubt, an appetite\r\nfor annexation being naturally whetted by the recent acquisition\r\nof territory. These ideas became a theme of discussion among the\r\nmultitudes who crowded from all quarters of the state to witness the\r\ncourtly shows at Pesaro; and when the Duke returned to the city from\r\nescorting the Pope towards Ferrara, he was met at the gate by a host\r\nof his subjects, whose loyalty and patriotism burst forth afresh in\r\ntumultuous shouts of \"_Serenissimo! moglie_.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote *86: Cf. CALOGERÀ, _Memorie concernenti Franc.\r\nMaria II._ (Venice, 1776).]\r\n\r\nThat the object of Clement's visit had been faithfully construed by\r\nthe general voice seems more than probable from the document we are\r\nabout to quote; but upon this point the Memoirs throw no light. They\r\nmerely notice his reception of the Pontiff with all distinction,\r\nand the remarkably friendly bearing of his Holiness towards himself\r\nand the Duchess mother during a day spent at their court: mutual\r\npresents passed between them, and Clement dwelt on the good service\r\nwhich his father had afforded to Duke Guidobaldo. From the Duke's\r\nDiary we learn that after meeting his Holiness on his southern\r\nfrontier, and again escorting him out of Sinigaglia, where he had\r\nslept with a suite of sixteen cardinals, he took boat and hastened\r\nto Pesaro. Next morning he proceeded to meet his visitor, who had\r\nspent the night at Fano, and welcomed him to his capital. Passing\r\nback to Rome in the end of the year, the Pope halted at Pesaro only\r\nto say mass in the cathedral; and on both occasions he was preceded\r\none day by the Holy Sacrament. In the following year the Pontiff,\r\nin acknowledgment, perhaps, of these hospitalities, accorded to his\r\nhost a dispensation, whereby the indulgences, to which the use of\r\ncertain rosary prayers and ave maria's entitled him, were united and\r\nconcentrated in a single _cavaliere_.[87]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: Rosaries, _corone_, and such were helpmates or\r\npromptuaries to prayer, differing in form and varying in supposed\r\nefficacy, according to the special privileges and indulgences\r\nbestowed on them by ecclesiastical gift. A specimen of the nature\r\nand powers of such indulgences will be found in the description of a\r\ncorona belonging to the Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1666. See Appendix\r\nVI.]\r\n\r\nThe predominant feeling of Francesco Maria, even at this period of\r\nhis life, appears to have been a selfish attachment to solitary\r\nhabits and pursuits, tempered by sincere anxiety to discharge his\r\npublic duties for the benefit of his people. An argument addressing\r\nitself to both motives readily occurred to the wily Pontiff. An\r\nimmediate abdication would secure to the Duke personal ease, and the\r\nconsequent devolution of his government to the Camera Apostolica\r\nmight be guarded by stipulations for the public weal, which such\r\nvoluntary demission alone could entitle him to dictate. The art with\r\nwhich these considerations had been urged, and the impression they\r\nmade upon the Duke, may be best gathered from a circular he addressed\r\nto the magistrates of each city in his state, curiously exemplifying\r\nhim in that character of royal philosopher which it seems to have\r\nbeen his ambition to attain.[*88]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *88: Cf. REPOSATI, _Della Zecca di Gubbio_, vol. II., p.\r\n220 (Bologna, 1772-3). The date of this letter was June 7th, 1598.]\r\n\r\n     \"Most magnificent and well-beloved,\r\n\r\n     \"Ever since we understood that you so affectionately long\r\n     for the continuation and maintenance of our house, we have\r\n     had no wish more urgent than to conform to your desires;\r\n     and although for some time past we have been always anxious\r\n     to facilitate this resolution, yet the more we consider\r\n     it, the greater do the difficulties daily appear, not only\r\n     by reason of our age and infirmities, but much more from\r\n     the obligation laid upon us to take no step that might\r\n     turn to your prejudice, as we know this would do: for,\r\n     upon weighing the advantages that would accrue to you by\r\n     being placed after our death immediately under the sway\r\n     of the Church, there cannot, in our opinion, be a doubt\r\n     that this would be most beneficial; since, besides being\r\n     rid of the present inconvenient restrictions on trade in\r\n     grain, salt, oil, and similar commodities, you might well\r\n     hope, from a sovereign so powerful as his Holiness, many\r\n     exemptions and facilities which we, however well-disposed,\r\n     cannot, with due attention to the suitable maintenance of\r\n     our rank, accord you. Wherefore, we exhort and pray you, to\r\n     take all this into your most serious consideration; and,\r\n     along with it, those suggestions which your affectionate\r\n     devotion may prompt, in conjunction with our delicate and\r\n     advanced age, as these might, at all events, render vain\r\n     the hope of a succession, or at least might occasion you\r\n     to be some day left under a minority (ever a judgment of\r\n     God upon a nation), and us to die with such pain as you may\r\n     conceive the predicament of leaving a minor would occasion\r\n     us: whereas, on the other hand, were we to remain in our\r\n     present condition, looking, so long as God may vouchsafe\r\n     us life, for no other children than yourselves, we might\r\n     the more diligently apply to the cares of our government.\r\n     It is therefore our desire that you satisfy yourselves in\r\n     this matter, and, after having prayed in all sincerity\r\n     to our Lord and Saviour for His inspiration, that you\r\n     convoke a full meeting of your usual council, excluding\r\n     all officers of our government, and that, after reading to\r\n     them this our letter, they should decide by ballot what\r\n     they judge most fitting for the common weal, having sworn\r\n     the consuls to conceal nothing of the resolution they come\r\n     to; and you shall report their decision to the Bishop of\r\n     this city, who, keeping it secret from us and all others,\r\n     shall declare only the general result of this appeal to you\r\n     and to the other principal places of our state, to whom we\r\n     write in similar terms: and the opinion so expressed we\r\n     shall, in accordance to our love towards you, endeavour\r\n     to carry into effect even at the hazard of our life,\r\n     thus appealing to the faithful attachment you have ever\r\n     displayed towards our house and ourselves, as is well known\r\n     to all, but chiefly to us.--May it, therefore, please the\r\n     blessed God so to inspire you, that these our exhortations\r\n     and commands may be executed so as to bring about the best\r\n     results, and may He preserve you.

Passeri conjectures that this result was in fact less\r\ndistasteful to Francesco Maria than the tone of his letter might\r\ninfer; and that the whole expedient was adopted in order to obtain\r\na satisfactory answer to the importunities of the Pontiff, whom the\r\nstern measures lately adopted towards Ferrara had rendered the Duke\r\npeculiarly averse to thwart, by opposition to his scheme. From the\r\nMemoirs so often quoted, we learn nothing beyond the obvious facts,\r\nthat the marriage was undertaken in compliance with urgent entreaties\r\nof the Duchess mother and of the people of Urbino, and that the bride\r\nwas his own choice.\r\n\r\nOf Cardinal Giulio della Rovere's two natural sons we have already\r\nspoken.[89] In the correspondence of Francesco Maria, there occur\r\nsome proofs of a bad understanding between him and these cousins,\r\nthe origin and circumstances of which it is unnecessary to examine.\r\nTo Ippolito Marquis of S. Lorenzo, there was born in 1585, of his\r\nmarriage with Isabella Vitelli, Princess dell'Amatrice in the\r\nAbruzzi, a daughter Livia, who was educated in the convent of Sta.\r\nCaterina at Pesaro; and on her fell the choice of Francesco Maria,\r\nas announced in the following extract of a letter to the Archduchess\r\nMaria of Austria. A selection so obviously ineligible may have been\r\ndictated in part by that shrinking from close contact with strangers\r\nwhich his reserved habits were calculated to generate, and partly too\r\nby the sad experience he had already reaped of a marriage of state\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: Above, p. 82.]\r\n\r\n\"Moved by the unremitting entreaties of my subjects, I have been\r\nforced to establish myself by a new alliance: yet as my age and other\r\nconsiderations would have prevented me from taking this resolution\r\nbut for their satisfaction, I have chosen to combine with their\r\nwishes a due consideration for my own, by selecting one of my proper\r\nblood, and brought up in this country, in whom are combined many of\r\nthe qualities suited to my views.\"\r\n\r\nOf the domestic life of Francesco Maria after his second union no\r\nrecord has been preserved to us. The circumstances in which it was\r\neffected were not such as to promise a high degree of matrimonial\r\nfelicity, to which his cold nature, advanced age, and reserved\r\ncharacter were virtually impediments. Nor could the monotonous\r\nseclusion of his habits be attractive to a youthful bride,\r\ntransported from a convent to the rank of sovereignty with few of its\r\ngauds. That she had the good sense simply to conform to her position\r\nmay be inferred from the rare occurrence of her name in the documents\r\nwhich I have inspected. The brief notices of her in her husband's\r\nDiary merely prove that they were seldom apart, and in one instance\r\nshe is mentioned as accompanying him to his favourite pastime of deer\r\nhunting. Regarding preliminaries for their marriage, that record is\r\nsilent, and the only allusion to it is in this concise phrase: \"26th\r\nApril, 1599, I married the Lady Livia della Rovere.\" But letters of\r\nthe Duchess, written long subsequently, to her granddaughter, of\r\nwhich a specimen will be introduced below, exhibit her character in a\r\nlight so amiable as to warrant our regret that it has not been more\r\nprominently brought into view, in the few materials which we possess\r\nfor this portion of our narrative.\r\n\r\nFrancesco Maria's affection to his mother would have been beautiful\r\nin any rank. Besides anxiously providing for her comfort by a\r\nsuitable establishment, he made her his friend and confidante through\r\nlife; and during his first marriage she filled at his court the place\r\nwhich in happier circumstances would have been occupied by his wife.\r\nThe ailments of her advancing years he tended with affectionate\r\nanxiety, and thus notices her decease on the 13th December, 1602,\r\nafter a long indisposition. \"Most deep was the public grief for the\r\nloss of this excellent and sainted Princess. She was beloved by\r\nall, but most by her son, who felt her death as no common sorrow,\r\nand testified both in public and in private the sincerity of his\r\nfeelings. Her funeral oration, pronounced by Leoni, was very fine,\r\nthough his praises necessarily fell far short of her real merits.\"\r\nThe Venetian Relazioni from the della Rovere court bear witness to\r\nher sound judgment and business habits, to her generous disposition\r\nand beneficent charities, as well as to the piety of her character,\r\nand the exemplary conduct observed by her household.\r\n\r\nHer remains were interred by those of her husband, with an epitaph\r\nwhich will be found in No. VII. of the Appendix, and her son appears\r\nfrom his Diary to have worn mourning for her for upwards of a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\n     Birth of Prince Federigo--The Duke's retired habits\r\n     and aversion to business--His constitution-making\r\n     experiments--His instructions to his son--The Prince's\r\n     unfortunate education and character.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the patriotism and loyalty of his people had been gratified\r\nby the gracious manner in which he had assented to their eager desire\r\nfor his marriage, yet was there wanting somewhat to the full fruition\r\nof their cherished hopes. The health of the Duchess was watched\r\nwith anxiety, and when months had passed away without the promise\r\nof an heir, apprehensions more restless than before spread over the\r\nland. In a matter beyond the limits of human will, recourse was had\r\nto the Dispenser of all events. Prayers were offered up in public\r\nand private. Vows were solemnly registered by all the towns, by\r\nconfraternities, even by village communities and private individuals,\r\nfor the erection and dedication of churches and altars, especially\r\nto S. Ubaldo, once bishop of Gubbio, who had been assumed as special\r\nprotector of that city and of the race of Montefeltro. About the\r\nbeginning of 1605, it was announced that these devotional appeals\r\nhad been crowned with success: the gloomy anticipations of the\r\ncitizens were turned to joyous hope; and so formidable to the public\r\ntranquillity did the reaction of enthusiasm appear, that orders were\r\nissued for transporting into the fortress of Pesaro all the state\r\narchives, in case any tumult or conflagration might endanger their\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nAs the Duchess's confinement drew near, the subject seemed\r\nexclusively to engross men's minds, and when her hour was reported\r\nto have arrived, the piazza in front of the palace was crowded\r\nwith an impatient multitude, who remained a day and night in eager\r\nexpectation. At length, on the morning of the 16th of May, the\r\nfestival of the patron saint Ubaldo, to whom their prayers had been\r\naddressed, about nine o'clock, the Duke appeared at a window of the\r\ngreat hall, and announced with a loud and clear voice, \"God has\r\nvouchsafed us a boy!\" The cheer of joyous triumph which rang through\r\nthe palace-yards was but an inadequate expression of the general\r\nexultation, and the precautions taken to preserve the peace proved\r\nbut too limited; for the insensate popular excitement vented itself\r\nin an attack upon the Jews' quarter, and succeeded in sacking and\r\nburning their synagogue and shops, in spite of exertions by the\r\nmilitary, who had been held in readiness to quell the outbreak.\r\nMeanwhile salvoes of artillery proclaimed the Prince's advent; and in\r\ngrateful acknowledgment of his good fortune, his father proclaimed\r\npardon to many prisoners, and favours to various classes of his\r\nsubjects. At the same time, with due regard to good order, he checked\r\nthe longer continuance of noisy and tumultuous festivity, and in\r\nparticular prohibited discharges of fire-arms under the heavy penalty\r\nof 100 scudi.\r\n\r\nAny scepticism which might have been secretly entertained of the\r\ninfant being truly a _dieu-donné_, in special answer to the thousand\r\nprayers that had been proffered to or through S. Ubaldo, was removed\r\nor silenced by his arrival on the fête of that saint whose hold on\r\nthe devotional feelings of the people was thus marvellously riveted.\r\nAmong the couriers speedily despatched over the duchy to bear boot\r\nand spur the happy news, one directed to Gubbio, the city and diocese\r\nof S. Ubaldo, was charged with a special letter from Francesco\r\nMaria.[*90] Arriving in hot haste, he found the whole population\r\nassembled in arms in the piazza, with the magistrates at their\r\nhead, to whom he delivered the welcome missive; after publication\r\nof which the multitude formed a solemn procession to the cathedral,\r\nto render thanksgivings to S. Ubaldo, its and their protector. In\r\nthat church the community of Gubbio lost no time in erecting a new\r\nchapel commemorative of the occasion, and placed on the altar a\r\npicture, in which the Madonna and Child smile benignantly on the\r\nsuppliant saints, John Baptist and Ubaldo (the former their original\r\npatron), whilst in the lower part is seen the courier's arrival with\r\nthe ducal despatch. Other places were scarcely less enthusiastic\r\nin redeeming their pious pledges, though enthusiasm seems to have\r\nbeen occasionally tempered by meaner considerations. Thus, in the\r\ncommunal records of S. Angelo in Vado, I found appeals from the Duke\r\nto quicken the tardy contribution of 500 scudi towards the erection\r\nof a votive church to S. Ubaldo; and months were spent in discussions\r\namong the magistracy how that sum was to be raised, by an assessment\r\nupon the artisans, and a duty upon butcher-meat. I know not whether\r\nwe are to regard as an economical solution of the difficulty an altar\r\npicture in the church of S. Filippo there, in which S. Ubaldo is\r\nrepresented as introducing to the Madonna and Child the young Prince,\r\nled up by S. Crescenzio, the patron of Urbino, while St. John Baptist\r\nintercedes in his behalf. Federigo seems a child about five years\r\nold, in a very richly embroidered dress, and strongly resembles a\r\nportrait of him which came into my hands from the Vatican Library,\r\nand which is here introduced.[91]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *90: Cf. PELLEGRINI, _op. cit._, in _Boll. cit._, vol.\r\n_cit._, p. 506 _et seq._ There seems always to have been an\r\nantagonism between Gubbio and Urbino, and now Gubbio could certainly\r\ncrow. She appears to have done so. See note 2, p. 506, of work\r\nquoted. The country was not quiet after the rejoicing till May 30th,\r\nthe festa being kept in all the cities. CORRADI, _Feste per il\r\nnascimento di un Principe nel sec. XVII._ in _Il Giornale di Foligno_\r\n(Foligno, 1887), No. 28 _et seq._ describes the rejoicing in Cagli.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: In 1843-6, a variety of duplicates and objects of\r\nart belonging to the Vatican Library were exchanged away, with the\r\nsanction of Gregory XVI., whilst my lamented friend Monsignore\r\nLaureani, the librarian, was forming, by that Pontiff's order,\r\nfrom very limited resources, a most interesting series of early\r\npanel pictures illustrating the progress of Christian painting.\r\nThe portrait of Prince Federigo now belongs to my friend Andrew\r\nCoventry, Esq., Edinburgh, and appears the production of a scholar of\r\nBaroccio.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the religious usages of the age, the measure of\r\ngratitude due by the sovereigns of Urbino for their long desired heir\r\nwould have remained incomplete without a pilgrimage of thanksgiving\r\nto the Madonna of Loreto. Benedetto Benedetti, librarian to the\r\nDuke, writes, on the 20th June, 1605,[92] that the Duchess was to\r\nset out next day on this holy mission, \"carrying with her a plate\r\nof solid gold, the size of a half sheet of writing paper, on which\r\nwas portrayed in oil by a young pupil of Baroccio the infant Prince,\r\nwho is one of the most lovely babes I should wish to look upon; fat,\r\nof good complexion, and comely features, his eyes large and black,\r\nunlike those of the Duke, and his mouth resembling his mother's.\"\r\nIt appears, however, from the Diary of Francesco Maria, that he\r\nhad already acquitted himself of this pious debt by attending the\r\nfestival of the Corpus Domini at Loreto on the 9th of June. On the\r\n29th the Duchess carried her son to Urbino. At the gate they were met\r\nby twelve youths in blue damask trimmed with gold, and twenty-four\r\nchildren in white and gold; and the Prince, with his nurse, was borne\r\nby these youths in a close chair to the palace, through streets\r\nembellished with fountains and other ornaments.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: Oliveriana MSS. No. 375.]\r\n\r\nThree days after the child's birth he had been privately baptised\r\nby the Bishop of Pesaro on Ascension Day, and named Federigo Ubaldo\r\nGiuseppe. His public baptism took place on the 29th November at\r\nUrbino, on which occasion his father, in deference to the loyal\r\njoy of his subjects, broke through his wonted habits of quiet and\r\nretirement, and celebrated the solemnity with a pomp more congenial\r\nto the pageant observances of Italian courts than to his own tastes.\r\nEvery community of the duchy, by special invitation, sent their\r\ndeputies, expensively arrayed, and bearing costly gifts. The states\r\nof Italy likewise were there, represented by ambassadors rivalling\r\neach other in magnificence. But chief among all was the Marquis\r\nof Pescara, envoy of Philip III. of Spain, who, before its birth,\r\nhad promised to stand godfather to the infant. We pass over the\r\nceremonial with which he was welcomed, but must pause for a little\r\nupon the spectacle of the baptism, as described in a contemporary\r\nnarrative.[93]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 818, f. 444.]\r\n\r\nFrom the houses in front of the Duomo were displayed those rich and\r\nmany-tinted hangings which add so much to the effect of an Italian\r\npageant. The short space from the palace was closed in by an awning\r\nof green, red, and white, the ducal liveries. The whole interior\r\nof the church was hung with magnificent decorations, in which were\r\nmingled tapestries and brocades, pictures and heraldic blazonry. The\r\nhigh altar was profusely furnished with statues, vases, candlesticks,\r\nall of solid silver. Into the cathedral thus prepared was seen\r\nadvancing, about two hours before mid-day, under a bright and genial\r\nsun, a most imposing procession. The principal public functionaries,\r\nand the most distinguished of the nobility, were followed by\r\ntwenty-five pages of high birth, dressed in Damascus blue. Then came\r\nrepresentatives of the seven principal cities, bearing the massive\r\nsilver vessels to be used in the ceremony. At their head walked Count\r\nAlessandro Tiane, Gonfaloniere of Urbino, conspicuous not less by\r\nhis handsome person than by the rare splendour of his costume. He\r\nwore a close-fitting dress of white, brocaded with gold and silver;\r\nhis flowing mantle of purple velvet was lined with violet and gold;\r\nand on his neck and cap was displayed a profusion of costly jewels.\r\nA scarf embroidered with pearls and precious stones suspended from\r\nhis neck a white cushion, whereon lay the babe in \"toys of quaint\r\napparel,\" which the writer attempts not to describe. The nurse,\r\nattended by sixty noble matrons arrayed in gala, closed the cortège,\r\namid the clang of artillery and martial music. The sacred rite\r\nwas administered by the Bishop of Fossombrone, and the religious\r\nfunction having been auspiciously ended, the company proceeded to a\r\nball, followed by a supper, where the grotesque taste and elaborate\r\ningenuity of Italian confectioners were lavishly displayed in the\r\ntable-ornaments.\r\n\r\nAbout seven in the evening, the guests were summoned by trumpet to\r\nthe windows and balconies to witness a triumphal representation of\r\nthe glories of Duke Federigo, whose name had that day been revived\r\nin the infant Prince. The space in front of the palace was fitted\r\nup as a vast stage laid out with woodland scenery, in the midst\r\nwhereof rose a mountain, emblematic of the Apennines. Near its\r\nsummit a cavern exhibited antique trophies and elephants, among\r\nwhich was a broken bust of Asdrubal, allusive to the defeat of the\r\nCarthaginian army near the Furlo pass. The whole was overshadowed by\r\ntwo vast oaks personifying the Duke and Duchess, under which were\r\ngrouped shepherds playing on their national instruments. Across this\r\nmimic representation of the duchy of Urbino a gorgeous procession\r\npassed with military music, in the following order. The car of\r\nFame advanced, glittering with the precious metals, and drawn by\r\nwinged horses. On its front, amid garlands of flowers, was perched\r\na black eagle crowned, the monarch of birds, and heraldic bearing\r\nof Montefeltro; and it contained figures of Fame, Time, and Truth.\r\nFame stood winged upon a globe, to which were yoked two dolphins; her\r\nrobe of gold and silver tissue was _semé_ with countless eyes, ears,\r\nand mouths, and in her hand she held a golden trumpet. Before her\r\nsat old Time, with his hour-glass; behind, Truth chanted stanzas in\r\ncompliment to the hero of two mottoes which were displayed over the\r\ncar:--\r\n\r\n     \"TO THESE AND EARTH'S MOST DISTANT LANDS ARE SHOWN\r\n     OUR FREDERICK'S GLORIOUS DEEDS, HIS HONOUR AND RENOWN.\"\r\n\r\n     \"BY MARTIAL VALOUR WERE HIS TITLES WON.\"\r\n\r\nIn the procession which followed, were borne the armorial insignia\r\nof Duke Federigo, and of the sovereigns in close alliance with him;\r\nhis various decorations of knighthood, the golden rose, the sword and\r\nbaton of the Church, and similar badges of his dignities. Then came\r\nanother car, drawn by four horses, and magnificently ornamented with\r\ncornucopias of public prosperity, intermingled with devices used by\r\nthe various Dukes, amid which sat Justice, Bravery, and Prudence.\r\nNext marched by, an imposing military pageant, with the banners and\r\nensigns of those states and cities over which Federigo had been\r\nvictorious, and with the batons of command entrusted to him by the\r\ndifferent powers whom he had served. To these succeeded a third car,\r\nstill more magnificently decked out, which was dedicated to martial\r\nglory, and bore a figure of Pallas copied from the antique; it was\r\nladen with pictures and mottoes, allusive to his principal triumphs;\r\nand over a mass of books was the legend,--\r\n\r\n     \"MINERVA'S LIBERAL ARTS HIS VICTORIES DID CROWN.\"\r\n\r\nThis lengthened procession having all passed, the various figures\r\nwho had performed in it assembled upon the stage and executed a\r\nmelodramatic ballet, which lasted till about 10 p.m.; and the\r\nceremonies of the day were wound up by a splendid display of\r\nfireworks.[94] It has been stated in most accounts of the baptism,\r\nthat the Golden Fleece was conferred on the infant by the Marquis\r\nof Pescara in name of his master Philip III. But, from the Diary of\r\nFrancesco Maria, we learn that this decoration had been transmitted\r\nto himself some weeks before, that he, as a knight of that order,\r\nmight invest the Marquis with it, which was duly done on the 1st of\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: A comparison of this stately entertainment with the\r\nceremonial at the baptism of Prince Henry of Scotland in 1594, as\r\ngiven in the _Lives of the Lindsays_, vol. I., 382, from a rare\r\ncontemporary pamphlet, shows how Italian revels influenced the\r\ncourtly displays of our ancestors, due allowance being made for the\r\ndifference of climate and the somewhat more material attractions of\r\nthe northern festivity.]\r\n\r\nThe Duke's advancing years had by this time considerably modified\r\nhis personal habits. To the pleasures of the chase succeeded the\r\nless fatiguing interests of a large breeding stud. His partiality\r\nfor animals and natural history had long induced him to give his\r\nattention to improve the race of horses, and he notes in his Diary\r\nfrequent arrivals of stock of all sorts from various quarters,\r\npurchased or received in presents. Thus, in 1588, he had fifty-four\r\nyoung horses at one time from the Duke of Savoy, and he mentions\r\npaying 300 to 500 ducats for stallions. After his second marriage,\r\nentries of this sort became more frequent, and details of hunting\r\nless so. The great breeding establishment was maintained on Monte\r\nCorciano near Cagli, where the young stock ran at grass during\r\nthe summer months; in winter they were brought down to Mirafiori,\r\nwhere those which were sufficiently advanced went into the hands of\r\nbreakers. This was a casino just without the walls of Pesaro, so\r\ncalled from a flower-garden the Duke had made there, whither rare\r\nand beautiful plants were brought from all parts at great expense.\r\nIn it too was preserved a very rich armoury collected by him, which\r\nis mentioned with admiration by Scotti in his published travels, and\r\nwhich afterwards passed to the grand-ducal family of Tuscany.\r\n\r\nBut the most marked alteration of his character was his growing\r\naversion to public business, and increasing proneness to gratify\r\nhis secluded and selfish habits by devoting an undue portion of\r\ntime to his private relaxations of study and books. The tendency to\r\nsolitude which had been gradually stealing upon him was checked for\r\na season after the birth of his son. This joyous occasion seems to\r\nhave in some degree revived the elasticity of his youthful feelings:\r\nhis visits to Pesaro were more frequent, and, in 1606, the Comedy\r\nof _L'Ingannata_ was repeatedly performed in the palace there. Ere\r\nlong, however, his mind gradually relapsed into a sort of morbid\r\nabstraction which was constitutional to him, and the retirement of\r\nCastel Durante became more and more attractive. It would indeed have\r\nbeen difficult to find a spot more congenial. Known originally as\r\nCastel del Ripa, a title appropriate to its position on a peninsula,\r\nformed by the rugged ravine of the brawling Metauro, it had been\r\ndestroyed about 1277, in a foray of the people of Urbino, whence it\r\nis distant about nine miles. Pope Martin IV. ordered it to be rebuilt\r\nby his Legate in Romagna, Guglielmo Durante, a noted canonist, who\r\ngave it his own name. Having subsequently passed in seigneury to the\r\nBrancaleoni of Mercatello, it was obtained, under the title partly\r\nof conquest, partly of inheritance, by the Counts of Montefeltro,\r\nin 1429. After that dynasty had been extinguished, it owed to papal\r\nmunificence a second re-edification in 1636, when Urban VIII. raised\r\nit to the rank of a city, suffragan to the Bishop of S. Angelo in\r\nVado; and the improvements he made upon it are commemorated by his\r\nstatue erected in the town, and by another change to its present name\r\nof Urbania.\r\n\r\nIts situation is singularly beautiful. Surrounded by wooded hills, it\r\noccupies the nearest point of the upper valley of the Metauro, which\r\nextends to the Mercatello in a stretch of rich alluvial land that\r\npleasingly contrasts with the rest of this highland province. Adapted\r\nequally for the sports of the chase, and for a peaceful retreat\r\nfrom the busy world, it was in all respects suited to the wants of\r\nFrancesco Maria, in youth and in advancing years. His usual residence\r\nwas a large palace which, entering from the street, overhangs to\r\nthe back the romantic river; and which, like many more of the ducal\r\npossessions, has passed to the Albani, and is doomed to the neglect\r\nconsequent upon absenteeism and protracted litigation. It was here\r\nprobably that he built a library, to which in 1609 he transported\r\nfrom Pesaro the many books which he had collected, leaving at Urbino\r\nthose which had been amassed by his predecessors. On the opposite\r\nbank he enclosed an extensive park, and stocked it with fallow-deer\r\nand smaller game. Within that enclosure, on the slopes of Monte\r\nBerticchio, he built, after his second marriage, another palace, and\r\nsurrounded it with a delightful garden. The park walls also included\r\nthe convent of Franciscan Observantines, which still stands about a\r\nmile to the west of Urbania; and to them perhaps may be attributed\r\nthe beginning of that monkish influence which tinged his latter\r\nyears. But they were eventually superseded in his regard by the\r\nMinims, for whom, in 1617, he purchased the church of the Madonna\r\ndella Neve, just beyond the park gate, and changed its name to that\r\nof the Crucifix. He there built for them a small convent, and invited\r\nto it twelve monks, distinguished for learning and acquirements in\r\nthose philosophic pursuits which chiefly occupied his mind. Thus, as\r\nyears advanced, did he become more and more inordinately attached\r\nto Castel Durante, where, leaving in his capital the trappings of\r\nsovereignty, he surrounded himself with a small and select suite, and\r\nsought in books and philosophic discussions, those gratifications\r\nwhich, since the chase had lost its charms, were most conducive to\r\nhis humour. Here accordingly we find him corresponding with Isaac\r\nCasaubon, as to a MS. of Polybius, which, by desire of Henry IV.,\r\nhe had forwarded for an edition then in preparation at Paris, and\r\nurging its restoration, on the plea that MSS. of such value were not\r\nremoved from the library, even for his own use.[95] It was doubtless\r\nthe same Polybius which Giunta tells us was returned by that monarch\r\nunder a military escort.[96]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: Brit. Mus., Burney MSS. No. 367, f. 64.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: MS. Albani Library at Rome.]\r\n\r\nIt being the whim of Francesco Maria to unite in his person\r\nthe opposite characters of monarch and philosopher, manifold\r\ninconsistencies were the natural consequence. In the address to his\r\nsubjects, which we have quoted in reference to his second marriage,\r\nwe have seen him dwell on the government of a minor as the greatest\r\nevil that could befall a people. Yet scarcely had he obtained the\r\nblessing of an heir than he began to devise steps for devolving\r\nprematurely upon his child the responsibility of sovereignty, and\r\nthereby releasing himself from those cares of state which reached him\r\neven at Castel Durante, and jarred upon his morbid love of seclusion\r\nand books. To this motive, at least, seem attributable the measures\r\nwhich we are now to detail, although he apparently excused them to\r\nhimself as a wise precaution, in anticipation of his own death ere\r\nhis son should have attained maturity. But, whatever may have been\r\nhis real inducement, the scheme, so novel in that age, of imparting\r\nto his subjects a share in the government, was obviously calculated\r\nto gratify his love of philosophic speculation, while it threw upon\r\nothers those duties and anxieties from which the prevailing desire of\r\nhis advancing years was to escape.\r\n\r\nHis first step towards this plan was taken in 1696, by ordaining\r\nthat the episcopal cities of Urbino, Pesaro, Gubbio, Sinigaglia,\r\nFossombrone, Cagli, and S. Leo, with the province of Massa Trabaria,\r\nshould send him a leet of their inhabitants most qualified for the\r\nadministration of affairs. Selecting one from each, he constituted\r\nthem into a council of state, to sit permanently in Urbino: on this\r\nbody he conferred the most ample powers to govern in his name, and,\r\nin the case of his death, to become the regency. In order fully to\r\nexplain this project, we quote the state documents relating to\r\nit, which have been printed by Marini in his _Saggio di S. Leo_.\r\nThese will be rendered more intelligible by premising that the\r\ninhabitants of towns were then divided into four classes,--the\r\nnobility, the merchants and wealthy citizens, the master artisans,\r\nand the operative artisans. Each of these chose their own prior, and\r\nthe prior of the nobles was the gonfaloniere, to whom, among other\r\nduties, was confided the standard in battle. These political rights\r\ndid not extend to peasants, menial servants, nor mechanics of the\r\nbaser callings.\r\n\r\n     \"To the magnificent and our well-beloved, the Gonfaloniere\r\n     and Priors of S. Leo, and to the Four, and the Parliament\r\n     of the province of Montefeltro, THE DUKE OF URBINO.\r\n\r\n     \"Magnificent and well-beloved,\r\n\r\n     \"Ever since the birth of the son whom God has vouchsafed\r\n     to us, it has been our fixed intention, in consideration\r\n     of the age we have attained, to leave behind us such a\r\n     form of government as may, during his minority, secure\r\n     your welfare, and be in conformity to your wishes; and\r\n     the desire increases with the affection which we bear to\r\n     you, and to which you are so well entitled. For this end\r\n     nothing seems more suitable than that you should govern\r\n     the commonwealth and him also. To carry our design into\r\n     execution, your council of S. Leo, uniting with the Four\r\n     and the Parliament of the province of Montefeltro, will\r\n     elect three or four well-qualified persons, without\r\n     reference to their rank or station, or to their being\r\n     members of council or parliament. From these we shall\r\n     select one, who, together with those from the other seven\r\n     communities, may represent our whole state, and give\r\n     their undivided attention to such important matters for\r\n     the general weal as shall be impartially proposed by us,\r\n     with a view to your own benefit, and that of our house.\r\n     The enclosed draft is sent to you as a foretaste of this\r\n     plan of government. Be careful, therefore, to complete\r\n     the election as soon as possible, as it is our intention\r\n     to make trial during our life of this mode of government,\r\n     and so to introduce it that, after us, it may proceed with\r\n     the more facility, and in better order, in the name of\r\n     the Almighty. From all this we feel assured that you must\r\n     perceive the great confidence which we have in you, and\r\n     which we firmly hope will much contribute to those good\r\n     results of our plan so strenuously desired by us and by\r\n     you. May the Lord God protect you.\r\n\r\n     \"From Urbino, the 24th of August, 1606.\r\n\r\n     \"FRANCESCO MARIA.\"\r\n\r\n     [_Draft enclosed in the preceding letter._]\r\n\r\n     \"The form of government by the persons elected shall be as\r\n     follows. All the Eight shall reside at Urbino, with the\r\n     same absolute rules as I myself enjoy, attending with all\r\n     diligence and loyal fidelity to the guidance of the state\r\n     and of their pupil. And, further, each of them shall make\r\n     oath before the auditors to exercise their functions in\r\n     the manner prescribed, and, in due time, to execute to the\r\n     letter my testament, and all such written memoranda as I\r\n     may leave behind me.\r\n\r\n     \"They shall have two secretaries, one for foreign affairs\r\n     and correspondence, the other for those of the interior,\r\n     and shall assemble with them twice a day, or oftener if\r\n     necessary. They shall take their seats at the same side of\r\n     the table in their respective order; and those whose rank\r\n     may have been matter of dispute shall decide by lot who is\r\n     to take precedence at first, and shall thereafter enjoy\r\n     it by turns, changing each succeeding month. They shall\r\n     observe the same order in voting and on all occasions of\r\n     meeting for public business, but at other times they are\r\n     to have no sort of rank. And this rule shall be observed\r\n     as to all questions of precedence that may arise, until it\r\n     be modified by consent or legal authority, always without\r\n     prejudice to the rights of individuals; and, if any one be\r\n     discontented therewith, the others shall be entitled to\r\n     administer the state with unimpaired authority.\r\n\r\n     \"They shall enjoin the secretaries to make minutes of all\r\n     that occurs, writing them afterwards into a book for the\r\n     purpose. The Eight, or whatever be their number, shall\r\n     discuss verbally all motions, and ballot upon them, the\r\n     resolutions supported by most balls being carried; and this\r\n     shall be specially minuted, with the signature of both\r\n     secretaries. In case of an equality of votes, the president\r\n     of the bench of auditors shall be called upon to decide the\r\n     point.\r\n\r\n     \"All their resolutions, letters, and documents shall run\r\n     in name of the sovereign, with the ducal seal, and with\r\n     signatures of the first in rank, and of the two secretaries.\r\n\r\n     \"In absence of one or more from illness, or the like lawful\r\n     cause, the others shall continue vested with the same\r\n     authority, provided there be a quorum of five; but, if\r\n     fewer, the auditors must make up that number. And, should\r\n     one die, or become permanently disabled, his place must be\r\n     forthwith filled up by election of another leet as at first.\r\n\r\n     \"The courts of law [_udienza_] shall continue to enjoy the\r\n     same authority as heretofore, but subject to the first of\r\n     the eight deputies, to whom shall be submitted memorials of\r\n     all cases for pardon, in the same way as has been hitherto\r\n     observed. By these courts shall be named the officers of\r\n     justice for the state, who, in absence of cause shown to\r\n     the contrary, shall be confirmed by the deputies, on whom\r\n     shall depend absolutely all the other officers of the\r\n     household and state.\r\n\r\n     \"And, in order that these deputies may give undivided\r\n     attention to their official duties, they shall each receive\r\n     from the treasury 300 scudi a year.\"[97]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: Vat. Ottob. MSS. No. 3184, f. 154. The salary of 300\r\nscudi was increased to 400.]\r\n\r\nFour days after date of the preceding letter, the provincial\r\nparliament of Montefeltro, and the council of S. Leo, met to\r\ndeliberate thereon, by summons from the commissioner of the province\r\nand the podestà of the town. The parliament consisted of four\r\ndelegates from the landward districts, and twenty-nine others from\r\nas many townships; the council was composed of the gonfaloniere,\r\nthree priors, and twenty-nine citizens. They elected four deputies\r\nby ballot, excluding, by a majority of black beans, two of those\r\nproposed; and, from these four, one whose election had been unanimous\r\nwas selected by the Duke as deputy to the council. Similar forms\r\nhaving been observed by the remaining cities, the council entered\r\nupon their duties on 22nd of January, 1607, and Francesco Maria\r\nresigned himself more than ever to the selfish ease of his solitary\r\nand abstracted life at Castel Durante, flattering himself (to use his\r\nown words) that \"they would inform themselves fully of all matters of\r\ninternal policy and foreign relations, and would direct these for the\r\nservice of God, and to the benefit of his subjects, and of his heir.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious and unnecessary to notice all the minute\r\ninstructions issued from time to time to the Eight on matters of\r\npolice, of patronage, or of trade. The following memorandum, however,\r\nwritten out by Francesco Maria himself for their guidance, in 1611,\r\naffords some insight into his views of general policy:--\r\n\r\n\"In order to continue hourly more fully satisfied with you, I give\r\nyou the following suggestions, which seem to me called for at\r\nthis moment. Ever have before your eyes the three objects which\r\nI have often enforced upon you--plenty, peace, and justice. The\r\nfirst of these will be secured if the old plan for plenty be not\r\nre-established, which, indeed, might be more appropriately called\r\nperpetual scarcity, as it was adopted solely for enriching six or\r\neight of the worst citizens who managed it; and should it become\r\nnecessary to purchase grain, let an advance from my funds be made\r\nto the public, always endeavouring to clear off such loans as\r\nremain undischarged. And never permit the local councils to meddle\r\nwith matters that concern them not, seeing that I, by adopting the\r\ncontrary plan for their satisfaction, fell into errors which turned\r\nout ill.\r\n\r\n\"As to maintaining peace among my subjects, this may easily be done\r\nby chastising the riotous and sowers of dissension and discord, whose\r\npunishment ought to be public and severe; above all things preventing\r\npersons of whatsoever rank to pretend to or maintain retinues of\r\nfollowers, or to domineer over others.\r\n\r\n\"Justice will be observed by insuring the prompt issue of suits,\r\nand by punishing judges when they fall into error; but especially\r\nby enforcing an inviolate observance of all orders, decrees, and\r\nproclamations; by rarely, and only from necessity, suspending the\r\nprosecution of outlaws; and by receiving few fugitives from other\r\nstates. Prevent so great an increase of lawyers and notaries, and\r\noffer obstacles to their admission. Show no undue favour to parties\r\nin suits. Vigilantly defend our authority, ever covertly assailed;\r\nbut do this by fair means, avoiding if possible open ruptures. Eschew\r\npartiality and prejudice, rigorously maintaining justice and your\r\nduty.\r\n\r\n\"In the despatch of business promptitude is requisite, avoiding\r\narrears, which occasion oversights, and lead to a wholesale\r\ntransaction of affairs, without the accuracy necessary to their\r\nbeing done well; and although full consideration and discussion\r\nbe required, there are few matters which cannot be exhausted by\r\nemploying on them one's entire energy during two hours; after\r\nwhich they should be carried into effect quickly, without further\r\ndiscourse, but with secrecy. Provided you do all these things with\r\nthat affection upon which I rely, I doubt not of their happy issue;\r\nbut I again, and for the last time, remind you that your chief\r\ncare should be the punctual execution of all my injunctions and\r\ncommands.\"[98]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: Vat. Ottob. MSS. No. 3134, f. 158.]\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the immediate effect upon the management\r\nof public affairs of the Duke's wayward conduct, its mischievous\r\ninfluence on the character of the young Prince was not long dormant.\r\nHis education was entrusted, in 1607, to the Countess Vittoria\r\nTortora Ranuccio Santinelli, whose husband was major-domo to the\r\nDuke; but the anxiety felt for a life so precious was unduly\r\nexaggerated by certain symptoms of childish delicacy, and the\r\nsystem adopted was that of unbounded indulgence, balanced by no\r\nobligation to apply himself to anything. Before he had completed\r\nhis second year, Philip III. settled upon him in reversion his\r\nfather's retaining pension of 15,000 golden scudi, and company of\r\nmen-at-arms in Naples, assuring him of ample protection. That the\r\nDuke was sensitively anxious to prepare his mind for the duties of\r\nmanhood thus crowded prematurely upon him, is interestingly shown by\r\na paper of instructions, written in the anticipation of his being\r\nleft an early orphan. To find in it maxims directly opposed to the\r\nwriter's own practice may afford scope for saddening speculation to\r\na philosophic moralist, and must have greatly detracted from their\r\ninfluence upon the boy to whom they were addressed. The length of the\r\ndocument, and its interruption to our narrative, will be excused from\r\nits importance as illustrating the character of Francesco Maria.\r\n\r\n     \"Believing that at my advanced age I cannot be much longer\r\n     with you, I have resolved to write down certain memoranda\r\n     which I consider it most necessary that you should\r\n     remember, preserving them not merely under your eye, but\r\n     impressing them deep on your heart; for by none can they be\r\n     offered you with more affection, or perhaps with greater\r\n     experience, from the affairs which I have conducted.\r\n\r\n     \"I would, therefore, desire you chiefly to endeavour\r\n     with all your might, to live in the favour of our Lord\r\n     God, devoutly honouring His holy name, and being careful\r\n     never to offend Him, firm in His most holy faith without\r\n     superstition. As to priests and monks, after securing them\r\n     in the position which is their due, do not establish with\r\n     them much familiarity beyond what your devotional duties\r\n     call for; but leave them to look to their proper business,\r\n     whilst you attend to yours without their assistance,\r\n     further than their prayers in your behalf.\r\n\r\n     \"Be not merely faithful to his Holiness the Pope, but also\r\n     obedient, doing all that in you lies for his service, and\r\n     with sincere attachment seeking to exalt the Holy See.\r\n\r\n     \"In the service of his Catholic Majesty show yourself at\r\n     all times most zealous, performing it with constancy, and\r\n     never quitting it until it becomes inconsistent with your\r\n     honour, which I feel assured it never will be. And further,\r\n     be ready to display your devotion in a befitting manner;\r\n     and should his Majesty take the field in person, fail not\r\n     to be there also, and to identify yourself with him, from\r\n     which you cannot fail to derive great reputation: remember\r\n     also, to treat all Spaniards with amiable courtesy. With\r\n     other sovereigns and princes cultivate the most friendly\r\n     terms, obliging them when opportunity offers, especially\r\n     neighbouring powers.\r\n\r\n     \"Maintain towards all, sincerity and truth with mildness;\r\n     but beware of being deluded, and for this purpose be slow\r\n     to credit any one.\r\n\r\n     \"When called upon to form any important resolution, examine\r\n     both sides of the question, and attach yourself to that\r\n     which seems safest.\r\n\r\n     \"Remember that you leave not for the morrow what can be\r\n     done on the instant; and so will your affairs generally\r\n     succeed according to your wishes. When just, your\r\n     undertakings will ever be forwarded and directed by the\r\n     Almighty; and thus will the labour be less to yourself than\r\n     if they are allowed to go on accumulating.\r\n\r\n     \"In the government of your subjects and dependants be most\r\n     decided; to your associates and well-wishers be gracious\r\n     and pleasing; towards others just and strict.\r\n\r\n     \"At the hour most convenient to yourself give daily\r\n     audience to all who seek it, hearing them patiently and\r\n     without interruption, and tolerating them even while\r\n     trifling a little. Leave the judges free from interference\r\n     in the lawful execution of their duties, dispensing mercy\r\n     where it is justly merited, and reluctant to the punishment\r\n     of death. In all but aggravated cases, commute it into\r\n     a minor penalty, especially by sending culprits to the\r\n     Venetian galleys, since this is an old usage in our family,\r\n     and as these protect our seas from pirates.\r\n\r\n     \"Choose for your service faithful and prudent nobles,\r\n     neither selfish, greedy, nor partial.\r\n\r\n     \"See that your ministers and counsellors be men who, as the\r\n     proverb goes, take the cart road, and boast not themselves\r\n     inventors of new theories, which, however specious and\r\n     fine at first sight, are most difficult in practice, and\r\n     in their issue full of mischief. Show no favour towards\r\n     rash ventures or novel expedients, but give your attention\r\n     rather to forward measures that have been determined on. Be\r\n     not anxious to make many new laws, but, on the contrary,\r\n     endeavour to condense the old ones.\r\n\r\n     \"Encourage not your relations to meddle in the affairs of\r\n     your government, lest they should in consequence arrogate\r\n     to themselves undue influence; but contrive to keep them in\r\n     good humour by honouring them yourself, and by taking care\r\n     that others respect them.\r\n\r\n     \"Visit in person, annually, your whole state; or, when\r\n     prevented from doing so, send one of your judges.\r\n\r\n     \"Be courteous to ecclesiastical dignitaries, giving them\r\n     such honours as are their due, and exacting the like in\r\n     return.\r\n\r\n     \"See that your household be discreet and in nowise\r\n     quarrelsome, and divide annually among the most deserving\r\n     of them some donative from escheated property; but I\r\n     recommend you to keep hold of all castles, and never\r\n     alienate them, unless to those who have done you some\r\n     signal and most important service.\r\n\r\n     \"Be liberal in your expenditure, but never exceed your\r\n     revenues, managing so that every year you may have\r\n     something in hand; for if you do not attend to this, you\r\n     will probably find yourself tempted by necessity to seize\r\n     upon what belongs to your subjects,--a thing you must ever\r\n     guard yourself from, as well as from any attempts upon the\r\n     honour of their wives, especially those of the nobility.\r\n\r\n     \"Be to all benignant and affable, entering freely into\r\n     conversation with men of letters or military acquirements,\r\n     and, above all, with those skilled in politics and affairs\r\n     of state.\r\n\r\n     \"Do not be too anxious to devote yourself to scientific\r\n     studies, which both preoccupy the mind from more important\r\n     subjects, and sadden it. Be satisfied with a thorough\r\n     knowledge of your native tongue, so as to read in it all\r\n     old and modern histories, and at fit times some devotional\r\n     book; but trust to acquiring knowledge of the sciences\r\n     from the discourse of their respective professors. It\r\n     is advisable to learn other languages; indeed, Spanish\r\n     is necessary, as you are in the service of his Catholic\r\n     Majesty.\r\n\r\n     \"Practise all healthful exercises, especially, ball,\r\n     hunting, and the manège. In the first of these you may\r\n     indulge almost daily; for the second, once a week is\r\n     sufficient, as it loses the entire day, and when too\r\n     frequently followed is apt to render one coarse. Make\r\n     use of the third when you feel inclined, maintaining a\r\n     small breeding stud, for which your country is admirably\r\n     adapted, with about thirty fine horses always at your\r\n     disposal. I warn you, however, not to over-exert yourself\r\n     in this or similar exercise, for excessive fatigue brings\r\n     on many infirmities, as has happened to myself. Fencing\r\n     is likewise most needful, especially that called wide\r\n     fighting, for close-quarters are dangerous, and of little\r\n     real avail. Instrumental music and singing are excellent\r\n     recreations, as well as dancing to give the body freedom.\r\n     Swimming is also an excellent preservative, especially in\r\n     travelling.\r\n\r\n     \"Do not indulge too much in sleeping. Eat and drink of\r\n     everything indifferently, without reference to diet such\r\n     as is recommended by physicians, of whom keep aloof while\r\n     you can, never calling them in until you are ill; but when\r\n     really so, obey them strictly, committing yourself first to\r\n     God, and secondly to their skill.\r\n\r\n     \"Remember, as soon as convenient, to complete your\r\n     marriage with the sister of the Grand Duke of Tuscany;\r\n     for no alliance could be found better or more entirely\r\n     suitable for this state, for our house, or for yourself.\r\n     To her, as your wife, be ever most affectionate; yet see\r\n     that she meddle not in the affairs of government, but\r\n     more particularly that she does not interfere in matters\r\n     regarding the administration of justice. Endeavour always\r\n     to maintain a most friendly footing with her family, paying\r\n     to the Grand Duke the deference due to a father, and\r\n     consulting him on every incident of importance.\r\n\r\n     \"Should God grant you more than one son, purchase for one\r\n     of them a fief, however small, in the kingdom of Naples,\r\n     and other property, yielding in all 12,000 scudi of\r\n     revenue, but give him no lands in your own state: by this\r\n     means you will found a second house, and avert the danger\r\n     in which our family was at the time of your birth. Your\r\n     other sons you may provide for by making one a churchman\r\n     with the Pope's assistance, and by giving to the rest such\r\n     savings as will in that case be very requisite. Forget not\r\n     to treat your eldest son like a brother, admitting him to\r\n     share with you the government and administration, which, if\r\n     God grant me life, I shall certainly do towards you.\r\n\r\n     \"Lastly, I assure you, that those who have been faithful\r\n     and attached to me will, if you avail yourself of their\r\n     services, be the same to you; others you may seek to attach\r\n     to you, but abandon not these.\r\n\r\n     \"Such is the little I would impress upon you, not without\r\n     difficulty and much consideration; but take courage,\r\n     and the execution of it will become easy. I give you my\r\n     paternal benediction, praying the blessed God to confirm\r\n     it.\"[99]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: Bibl. Oliveriana.]\r\n\r\nBut though it seems agreed that the seed thus kindly and carefully\r\nsown fell upon a soil not naturally ungenial, and though to much\r\nchildish beauty the Prince is stated to have joined a fine temper,\r\na remarkably quick apprehension, and an uncommon memory, he was\r\ndestined sadly to verify a remark of Dante, that,--\r\n\r\n     \"Rarely into the branches of the tree\r\n     Doth human worth mount up.\"\r\n\r\nThe good fruit of almost spontaneous growth was speedily and entirely\r\nchoked by rank weeds, fostered under an erroneous system of early\r\ndiscipline. An only child, he was deprived of playmates of his own\r\nrank, and even of the companionship of the higher nobility, for whom\r\nwere substituted those whose flattery and indulgence provoked and\r\npandered to all the worst passions of a spoiled brat; and so early\r\nand fatally was this perversion effected, that he had scarcely passed\r\nthe years of infancy ere the people, who had hailed him as a gift of\r\nHeaven, ominously deprecated his accession to power. On his eighth\r\nbirthday, he was sent by the Duke, with a suitable attendance, to\r\npay his vows at the shrine of his patron saint in the cathedral of\r\nGubbio, and to offer there a small bust of himself chased in gold.\r\nOn this occasion the aged courtiers, who assembled to do honour to\r\nhis reception, were heard to draw the most melancholy forebodings, on\r\nobserving the overbearing and fiery temper which he was at no pains\r\nto control or conceal.[*100]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *100: Cf. PELLEGRINI, _op. cit._, in _Boll. cit._ vol.\r\n_cit._, p. 509 _et seq._ who gives two contemporary accounts of the\r\nvisit of Federigo in 1618.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\n     The Prince's marriage--The Duke entrusts to him the\r\n     government and retires to Castel Durante--His dissolute\r\n     career and early death--Birth of his daughter Vittoria--The\r\n     Duke rouses himself--He arranges the devolution of his\r\n     state to the Holy See--Papal intrigues.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe anxiety of Francesco Maria for continuance of his line, and for\r\nthe maintenance of his state against the risk of a minority, led him\r\nto select a match of policy for his son while yet a mere infant. In\r\nOctober, 1608, he sent a confidential adviser, Count Francesco Maria\r\nMammiani, to attend on his behalf the marriage of Cosimo Prince of\r\nTuscany; and during its prolonged festivities, a negotiation was\r\nhappily concluded for the betrothal of Princess Claudia, youngest\r\ndaughter of the Grand Duke Ferdinand II. to Prince Federigo. The\r\ndeath of her father, soon after, did not delay the ratification of\r\nan engagement so advantageous to all parties, and on the 24th of\r\nApril following, it was publicly announced,--the united ages of\r\nthe childish couple amounting to eight years and a half, and the\r\nPrincess being the elder by eight months. In November, she sent\r\nto \"her husband\" the appropriate presents of a nicely accoutred\r\npony, a poodle taught to leap, a jackdaw, and an inkstand in the\r\nform of Mount Calvary containing various conveniences. In honour,\r\nprobably, of the same auspicious occasion, was a gift of jewels from\r\nPhilip III. of Spain to the Duke and Duchess in 1609, consisting\r\nof a girdle, necklace, and brooch of gold; the girdle containing\r\ntwenty-eight, and the necklace eighteen links, studded with a\r\nhundred and twenty-six diamonds; sixty gold buttons enamelled in\r\nwhite and red, each with three diamonds; and a string of two hundred\r\nand twenty-six pearls of various sizes.[101]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: Oliveriana MSS. No. 375, vol. XXXI., p. 62.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FEDERIGO, PRINCE OF URBINO\r\n\r\n_From the picture once in the possession of Andrew Coventry of\r\nEdinburgh_]\r\n\r\nThe long and friendly intercourse of the Dukes of Urbino with the\r\ncrown of Spain had moulded their court to a tone of Spanish gravity,\r\nand a certain severity of manner, which the cold character, reserved\r\nhabits, and strict morals of Francesco Maria had served to confirm.\r\nTo this the conduct of the youthful Prince soon offered the strongest\r\ncontrast. Wilful in all things, and impatient of control, he endured\r\nno constraint upon his gratifications. These were generally of the\r\nmost trifling and childish description; and in one respect alone,\r\nand that an unfortunate one, did he exhibit any manly quality. His\r\nprecocious gallantry was a scandal to the staid manners of the court,\r\nand proved ruinous to his own constitution. Too late was his father\r\nmade aware of follies and vices which he had allowed to attain a\r\ndangerous height; and to the counsels of his advisers, that even\r\nyet a decided check should be applied, he weakly replied, in the\r\nsubtleties of a false philosophy, that restraints now imposed would\r\nbut irritate his son, and surely lead to greater excesses so soon as\r\nthey could be removed or burst. In truth, the old man shrank from\r\nthe exertions which his interference would require, and selfishly\r\ncalculated on being removed from the scene ere the mischief was fully\r\nmatured. But, whatever may have been the Duke's motives, his refusal\r\nto interfere was quickly reported to the Prince, who, thus secured\r\nagainst control, was emboldened to new excesses.\r\n\r\nFinding that years only confirmed those vicious symptoms which the\r\nPrince had manifested from childhood, and which a bad education had\r\nnot even attempted to eradicate, his father thought fit to try the\r\nexperiment of sending him forth to see the world, where, in the\r\nintercourse of courts, and in contact with men of distinction, he\r\nmight observe those qualities which mankind deem worthy of honour,\r\nand might learn the reputation acquired by his ancestors. This plan,\r\nwhich had more good sense than most of those which Francesco Maria\r\nwas in the habit of forming, unfortunately failed, and brought about\r\nresults exactly the reverse of those which had been anticipated.\r\n\r\nOn his journey through Romagna towards Florence, Federigo's evil\r\ngenius brought him into the company of some strolling comedians\r\nreturning from Venice. Delighted with their loose manners, he threw\r\nhimself among them without reserve, and a taste for their pursuits\r\nwas formed at first sight, which disgracefully occupied the few\r\nremaining years of his life. Such is the account given by Passeri;\r\nand two entries in the Duke's Diary mention that the Prince set out\r\nto visit Florence on the 1st and returned on the 22nd of October,\r\n1616. During the following month the Grand Duke Cosimo II. arrived\r\nfrom Loreto on a visit to Pesaro, with his brother the Cardinal; they\r\ntravelled with a large suite partly in coaches and six, partly in\r\nlitters, or on horseback, escorted by a guard of cuirassiers, being\r\nin all not less than six hundred persons. The Prince met and welcomed\r\nthem at the head of a hundred mounted gentlemen, and accompanied\r\nthem on a hunting party. They stayed six days at Pesaro, and thence\r\nproceeded to Rimini, leaving many presents, among which the Grand\r\nDuke gave Federigo a beautiful little office-book in a case, worth\r\n1000 golden scudi. Regarding his youthful irregularities the Journal\r\nmaintains a uniform silence, and the few notices of amusements at\r\ncourt scarcely afford us any index of his tastes. It would seem that\r\nup to his marriage he rarely left his parents' residence. During that\r\ntime we find but two theatrical representations mentioned. In the\r\ncarnival of 1617 nine couples of knights fought within a barrier,\r\nwhere there were also two chariots, one of Pallas, the other of\r\nVenus. The following year a wild boar, caught near Mondolfo, where\r\nit had attacked various peasants, was baited in the palace-yard at\r\nPesaro with large dogs and spears; and some days thereafter the\r\nPrince, with five others of his age, held a mimic tourney in the\r\ngreat hall.\r\n\r\nThe melancholy turn which the Prince's folly had taken determined his\r\nunhappy parent at once to conclude his marriage, which, even should\r\nit unhappily fail in rescuing him from a disgraceful career, might\r\nat least secure the continuance of his family. The Princess had a\r\ncharacter for high spirit, not free from hauteur, but accompanied\r\nwith decided talent; qualities that seemed likely to influence her\r\ndestined husband, or, at all events, to maintain his dignity against\r\nthe debasing tendency of dissolute habits. An intimate alliance with\r\nso powerful and so close a neighbour was in every view politic, but\r\nespecially at a time when the duchy of Urbino had become a more\r\nthan ever desirable adjunct to the Papal States. If any further\r\ninducements were wanting to render this the most advisable marriage\r\nfor the Prince, it was supplied by the dowry of 300,000 crowns of\r\ngold. But an arrangement so eligible seemed fated at every step to\r\nbe thwarted by the unsparing hand of death. When all was ready for\r\npublishing the betrothal, the bride's father was, as we have seen,\r\ncalled away; just as the nuptials were on the eve of celebration,\r\nthirteen years later, her brother, the Grand Duke Cosimo II., died on\r\nthe 28th of February, 1621. The urgent and advantageous circumstances\r\nof the connection again superseded the formality of court etiquette,\r\nand an early day was fixed for the marriage.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of April the Prince sent on a confidential envoy with the\r\nfollowing letter to his bride[102]:--\r\n\r\n     \"To the Princess Claudia, Consort of the Prince of Urbino.\r\n\r\n     \"Most serene Highness, my Lady, and most affectionate\r\n     Consort,\r\n\r\n     \"Giordani precedes me, and will give your Highness certain\r\n     assurance of my arrival next week, by the favour of God. I\r\n     beseech your Highness to accompany me on this journey with\r\n     the favour of your good wishes and prayers; and meanwhile\r\n     I, with all my heart, kiss your hands. From Pesaro, the\r\n     16th of April, 1621.\r\n\r\n     \"Your Highness's most affectionate servant and husband, who\r\n     loves you more than himself,\r\n\r\n     \"THE PRINCE OF URBINO.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: Bibl. Oliveriana MSS. No. 396, p. 131.]\r\n\r\nThe same day Federigo went to visit his father, and on the 22nd left\r\nCastel Durante. At the Alpine frontier he was met by a guard of\r\nhonour, under whose escort he arrived on the 25th in Florence, where,\r\nafter a pompous entrance into the city, the Villa Baroncelli was\r\nassigned for his reception. The ceremony was performed on the 29th,\r\nthe respective ages of the parties being sixteen and seventeen.[*103]\r\nThe public joy felt in the duchy at a step which promised to secure\r\nthe continued succession of the ducal house, and with it the\r\nnationality of the state, was proportioned rather to the importance\r\nof those objects than to the merits of Federigo. As yet, however, his\r\nfaults had been shown to but a limited extent, and by most of those\r\nwho were cognisant of them were generally believed the exuberant\r\nbut passing growth of boyish folly, which time, and, above all, a\r\nrespectable marriage, would surely eradicate. The Duke was willing\r\nto second the manifestation of these feelings, and the festivities\r\nwherewith the event was celebrated at Pesaro were consequently very\r\nelaborate. Among the most striking novelties was a device by\r\nwhich discharges of artillery were so regulated as to harmonise,\r\nor rather to beat time with the military bands, and the great hall\r\nof the palace was fitted up as a theatre for the performance of\r\nentertainments similar to what we have lately described.[104]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *103: The ceremony was performed on the 28th February\r\nwithout any pomp. Cf. UGOLINI, _op. cit._, vol. II., p. 437.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: See p. 177.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FACSIMILES OF SIGNATURES AND MONOGRAMS]\r\n\r\nThe Prince preceded his bride, and, after passing a day with his\r\nfather at Castel Durante, reached Pesaro on the 15th of May. On the\r\n21st, she set out on her ill-fated journey, and on the 26th was met\r\nat Lamole by her husband. Although it is only within the last few\r\nyears that the Apennine range has been there opened up by a road\r\nequalling in convenience any of the celebrated Alpine passes, a\r\nhasty effort was made to render her route practicable for a carriage\r\nfrom the frontier to her new capital. In the communal records of\r\nS. Angelo in Vado, I noticed an instruction that the town should\r\nbear its portion of the repairs of the way from Borgo S. Sepolchro,\r\npreparatory to her passage, and should contribute towards the public\r\nrejoicings, triumphal arches, and other complimentary demonstrations.\r\nAmong the ingenious devices adopted in honour of the occasion, was\r\nthe construction in wood of a colossal equestrian figure of the\r\nPrince on horseback, part of which still remains in the public hall\r\nof S. Angelo. Tradition ascribes it to Frederico Zuccaro, but his\r\ndeath in 1609 places him beyond the suspicion of executing what seems\r\nto have been little creditable to the artistic skill of his townsmen.\r\nThe bridal party, after sleeping at Mercatello, proceeded by easy\r\njourneys to Pesaro, spending only a forenoon at Castel Durante with\r\nthe Duke, who, unequal to the journey, had deputed his principal\r\ncourtiers, escorted by a hundred gentlemen on horseback, to receive\r\nthe Princess on the Apennines, and conduct her home. Among the\r\ndeputations which on this occasion attended to welcome her to her\r\nfuture dominions, was one from S. Leo, the ancient capital of the\r\noriginal fief of the Feltrian race, bringing a donative of twelve\r\nsilver cups valued at 500 scudi, to whom she returned the following\r\nanswer:--\r\n\r\n     \"To the most magnificent and my much loved the Gonfaloniere\r\n     and Priors of the city of S. Leo.\r\n\r\n     \"Most magnificent and well-beloved,\r\n\r\n     \"On entering this state, I brought with me a firm\r\n     resolution impartially to favour all, but this I shall\r\n     especially observe towards you; for I have particularly to\r\n     acknowledge your affectionate devotion, and gratefully to\r\n     accept the duty you have expressed towards me by the mouth\r\n     of your deputation, and by the compliment of plate you have\r\n     given me in token of your attachment. I shall ever cherish\r\n     towards you the like good will, and a desire of usefully\r\n     testifying it. May God preserve you. From Pesaro, 19th\r\n     December, 1621.\r\n\r\n     \"Your most loving,\r\n\r\n     \"CLAUDIA, PRINCESS OF URBINO.\"[105]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: MARINI, _Saggio di S. Leo_.]\r\n\r\nWith infatuation unequalled perhaps in the long catalogue of\r\nparental errors, Francesco Maria now gave the finishing stroke to\r\na system which had trained up his only child to become the scourge\r\nof his people and the ruin of his house. We have seen him deprecate\r\na minority as a national misfortune; we have now to witness him\r\nanticipating all its evils, by voluntarily entrusting the reins to\r\none whom youth, education, inexperience, and follies combined to\r\nrender utterly inefficient for their management. That this plan had\r\nlong been cherished as a favourite speculation, may be gathered from\r\nthose instructions to his son which have been already quoted; that\r\nits most attractive feature was the escape it secured to him from\r\nthe business and duties of his station, admits not of a doubt.\r\nFlattering himself that, in providing the Prince with an honourable\r\nand eligible match, he had done his utmost to retrieve past errors\r\nand secure a prosperous future, he hurried the execution of his\r\nscheme, apprehensive perhaps that delay would render its absurdity\r\nmore glaring, or bring to light some new disqualification in\r\nFederigo. In absence of any rational explanation of such a step, it\r\nhas been supposed a secret stipulation with the Grand Duke at the\r\ntime of the marriage, but of this there is not a shadow of evidence.\r\nThe motive imputed by Gozzi, that it was a device of the Duke to\r\nprevent his son from longing for his death and for the delights of\r\nsovereignty, seems quite reconcileable with the false philosophy by\r\nwhich he so perversely regulated his general conduct. We turn with\r\ninterest to the Diary at a moment thus important to his history\r\nand that of his state, but find it here more than usually meagre,\r\nalluding neither to the fact of his abdication, its manner, nor its\r\nmotives.[106] Like King Lear, the old man already felt--\r\n\r\n     \"How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is\r\n     To have a thankless child,\"\r\n\r\nand his Memoirs abruptly conclude with the negotiation for the\r\nPrince's marriage. From Passeri's investigations, we only learn\r\nthat he one day called round him his son and principal officers,\r\nand, after addressing to both a long exhortation on the new duties\r\nabout to be devolved upon them, made over to the former the reins of\r\ngovernment.[107] Reserving for his own use one-third of the private\r\nrevenues of his family, which from various documents seem to have\r\namounted to about 300,000 crowns, he shut himself up more closely\r\nthan ever in his--\r\n\r\n                           \"Boasted seat\r\n     Of studious peace and mild philosophy.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the Oliveriana MSS. I found a list of his court taken to Castel\r\nDurante, which, though undated, probably refers to the arrangements\r\nmade at this period.\r\n\r\n  1 counsellor, 1 secretary, 5 gentlemen of the household             7\r\n  4 captains, 5 chamberlains, 4 assistant chamberlains               13\r\n  1 dwarf or hunchback, 1 watchmaker, 1 barber                        3\r\n  1 master of the wardrobe, 2 porters, 4 pages and their 2 servants   9\r\n  1 physician, 1 apothecary, 2 chaplains, 3 readers                   7\r\n  18 household servants, 10 stable servants                          28\r\n                                                                     __\r\n                                         Total                       67\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: As a specimen of the style of this most disappointing\r\nMS., and in proof of its small historical importance, I extract\r\nall the notices for August 1621, the month in which, according to\r\nPasseri, this transaction took place.\r\n\r\n\"6. News arrived of the death of the Archduke Albert, which happened\r\nat Brussels on the 13th ult.\r\n\r\n15. Vespers began to be performed in the church of S. Rocca of Castel\r\nDurante.\r\n\r\n21. A stag was killed, weighing fully 530 lbs.\r\n\r\n26. Four large English dogs coursed in the park, which belong to the\r\nPrince; they killed two fallow deer.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: It appears that on the 25th of July the Prince arrived\r\nfrom Urbino, and stayed two days, during which probably this scene\r\ntook place.]\r\n\r\nYet the theoretical tendencies of his mind had not prevented him\r\nfrom establishing, in the early portion of his reign, many practical\r\nregulations conducive to the acceleration of business, and to the\r\ndue order of public affairs. His sway had been upon the whole a\r\nmild one; and on a retrospect of two centuries, the government of\r\nhis predecessors must be pronounced to have promoted, in a degree\r\nrarely paralleled, general happiness and public decorum, and at the\r\nsame time the true glory of their state. But all this was now to be\r\nchanged, and the brilliant dynasty of Urbino was doomed to expire,\r\nexhaling a vile and loathsome odour. That court which the refined\r\ntastes of the Feltrian Dukes and the polished pen of Castiglione had\r\nrendered a model to the world, which the literature and conduct of\r\nits later sovereigns had maintained in like honourable distinction,\r\nwas about to present a melancholy spectacle of unexampled\r\ndegradation. To enumerate the debasing excesses successively\r\nintroduced by Federigo is a sad and sickening task, which it were\r\nwell briefly to go through. His fancy for music was indulged, to the\r\nexclusion of more serious avocations. His casual acquaintance with\r\nthe company of Venetian comedians was ripened into an intimacy, which\r\ngradually monopolised his time and thoughts, and was followed out\r\nwith frenzied enthusiasm. These persons, belonging then to the vilest\r\nclasses, and treated accordingly, became the Prince's associates in\r\npublic and in private. Conforming his morals to theirs, he admitted\r\nthe actresses into his palace in daring defiance of decency, and\r\nopenly established one, named Argentina, as his mistress, fêting her\r\npublicly in Pesaro, and lavishing upon her large sums. Advancing\r\nfrom one extravagance to another, this petty Nero of a petty court\r\ndelighted to bear a part in their dramatic representations before\r\nhis own subjects, generally choosing the character of a servant or a\r\nlover, as most congenial to his degraded capacity. His people, imbued\r\nwith respect for the traditionary glories of their former Dukes, and\r\naccustomed to the gravity of Spanish manners, stood in consternation\r\nat such spectacles. But they scarcely dared express their feelings or\r\nhope for redress, for, whilst he thus\r\n\r\n                       \"Moiling lay,\r\n     Tangled in net of sensual delight,\"\r\n\r\nthe Prince had adopted the most severe precautions to prevent his\r\nfather becoming cognisant of what was passing.\r\n\r\nBut, however he might succeed in blinding one who was probably too\r\nhappy to shut his eyes and ears against all that occurred beyond the\r\nlimits of his favourite park and convent at Castel Durante, those\r\nwho owed the youthful tyrant no allegiance of apprehension carried\r\nrumours of his doings to Florence. The family of the Princess anxious\r\nto interrupt a career so disgraceful to her husband, so miserable for\r\nherself, invited Federigo to visit them; and we find from the Diary\r\nso often quoted, that he went to Florence on the 12th of September,\r\nand returned on the 3rd of December, 1622.\r\n\r\nThe Princess still fondly hoped (for women's hopes when fed by their\r\nwishes die slowly) that the case was not desperate; she accordingly\r\nreceived her husband with the joy and affection of a faithful wife,\r\nand ordered a salute of a hundred cannon to welcome him back. But her\r\ntrust was doomed to a grievous disappointment. The recent restraints\r\nof a foreign residence were speedily compensated by new indulgences,\r\nmore scandalous, if possible, than before. The buffoonery he had\r\nlearned on the stage was carried into the streets, through which\r\nhe sallied in some low disguise, insulting all and sundry, and\r\nstriking them with the flat of his sword, till frequently obliged\r\nto discover himself to the astonished spectators. The time which he\r\ncould spare from such ribaldry, and from his comedians, was devoted\r\nto the stable. Besides driving his own horses, an occupation in those\r\nstately days exclusively menial, he performed about them the vilest\r\noffices of farrier and stable-boy. At length, in executing a feat,\r\nunattempted, perhaps, by subsequent Jehus, that of driving eighteen\r\nhorses in hand, he galloped over a poor child. This outrage, having\r\nreached his father, provoked him, in a fit of passionate indignation,\r\nand in forgetfulness of his abdicated powers, to pronounce sentence\r\nof exile from Pesaro against the Prince,--an order which, of course,\r\nwas not enforced. The reserved inanity of the Diary throws no light\r\nwhatever on the Duke's knowledge or feelings in regard to such\r\noccurrences, though the following notices are scarcely reconcileable\r\nwith his ignorance of one excess of his son's headstrong career.\r\n\r\n\"1623, February 24. The Duchess went to Urbino for the comedy\r\nrepresented there the following day, and returned on the 26th.\r\n\r\n\"----, ---- 27. The comedy was performed in Castel Durante.\"[108]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: The succeeding entry abruptly concludes the\r\nJournal:--\"March 7. The Prince arrived about 10 A.M., having left\r\nPesaro the preceding day, and returned there the 10th;\" probably his\r\nlast meeting with his father.]\r\n\r\nResuming Passeri's Memoir, to which, although incorrect in many\r\ndetails, we are mainly indebted for this portion of our narrative, we\r\nfind that the Prince moved to Urbino early in the summer, the company\r\nof actors forming the strength of his court, and there nightly\r\nperformed with them, amid the acclamations of a rabble audience. With\r\na view to conciliate his mother-in-law, the Grand Duchess of Tuscany,\r\nwhose interference in behalf of her insulted daughter he had too good\r\nreason to anticipate, he prepared a magnificent coach and six costly\r\nhorses as a present to her. On the 28th of June he acted as usual\r\non the stage, the part which he sustained on this occasion being\r\n(according to Galuzzi) the degraded one of a pack-horse, carrying\r\nabout the comedians on his back, and finally kicking off a load of\r\ncrockery with which he was laden. About midnight he retired to rest,\r\nworn out by this buffoonery, after giving orders for a chasse next\r\nday at Piobbico near Castel Durante. At dawn, hearing the clatter\r\nof the horses which were setting out for Florence, he rose and gave\r\nsome orders from the window in his night dress. In the morning his\r\nattendants, surprised at not being summoned, and fearing he would be\r\ntoo late to attend mass before noon, knocked in vain at his door.\r\nThree hours passed away in doubts and speculations, and at length two\r\nof the courtiers burst open the door, exclaiming \"Up, your Highness,\r\n'tis time for the comedy!\" But for him that hour was past; the\r\nwell-known and welcome words fell on an ear whose silver cord was\r\nbroken. His body was under the icy grip of death; his spirit had fled\r\nto its awful account.\r\n\r\nThe body was discovered on its back, bleeding at the nose and mouth,\r\nthe left hand under the pillow, one leg drawn up, and the mattress\r\nmuch discomposed. The Prince always slept alone, and locked himself\r\nin, without retaining any attendants in the adjoining apartment.\r\nSix strangers, with the Tuscan accent, had been observed about\r\nthe palace the day before. From these circumstances, and from his\r\nodious character, suspicions of foul play were entertained; but most\r\nof the accounts which I have seen attribute his death to apoplexy,\r\nresulting probably from premature and excessive dissipation. The\r\nbody was opened, and no traces of poison were detected; but a small\r\nquantity of water was found upon the brain, which the medical\r\nreport attributed to over indulgence in athletic sports, and to the\r\nbushy thickness of his hair, which he greatly neglected. The most\r\nprobable explanation of this catastrophe was that of the astrologer\r\nAndrea Argoli, who, after an elaborate calculation of the Prince's\r\nhoroscope, pronounced him to have died of an epileptic fit, induced\r\nby the chill of the morning air; a conclusion dictated, no doubt,\r\nby medical experience, rather than by the study of those malignant\r\nplanetary influences which the quack thought fit to quote as decisive\r\nof the question.\r\n\r\nOn the first alarm the Princess had rushed to the room, breaking\r\nthrough all opposition, and exclaiming, \"What! my Lord is ill, and\r\nam I not to see him?\" but finding him dead, she fainted. The chief\r\nanxiety of all was how to break the dire news to the \"way-worn and\r\nway-wearied\" Duke, who was suffering from a severe fit of gout, in\r\nhis wonted retirement. At length, the Bishop of Pesaro, nominally\r\nhead of the court, undertook the painful mission. Having arrived at\r\nCastel Durante, he sent in by a chamberlain a sealed note, containing\r\nthe words \"The Prince is dead.\" This the Duke at first desired to\r\nbe laid aside till later, with his other letters; but on being told\r\nthat the Bishop was in attendance, he read it without emotion,\r\nand exclaimed in Latin, \"The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away;\r\nblessed be the name of the Lord.\" This Christian stoicism might seem\r\ninexplicable, but from the context of the narrative, which states\r\nthat to the lamentations of his attendants, he without a sigh or tear\r\nsupplied consolation, assuring them that the event was irremediable,\r\nand one for which he had long been prepared; and adding, with Sancho\r\nPanza-like resignation, \"He who lives badly comes to a bad end,\r\nand one born by a miracle dies by violence.\" He then with perfect\r\nself-command gave directions necessary for the funeral, and for the\r\nexigencies of the government; and at supper ordered the reading of\r\nItalian and Spanish books of edification to be continued as usual.\r\n\r\nIn an age when omens were observed with a heathenish superstition,\r\nthe people began to take note of these before they considered the\r\nrecent event in its practical and political bearings. It was now\r\nrecollected that the journey of the Prince and Princess, on their\r\nreturn from their marriage, had been interrupted, before they reached\r\nPesaro, by an extraordinary tempest, which flooded their capital, and\r\ndelayed their public entry. On the day month preceding Federigo's\r\ndeath, a flight of brown moths passed over Urbino towards the sea,\r\ndarkening the air for hours. Again, during the fatal night, a strange\r\nand threatening cloud was seen by many to cast its gloomy shadow\r\nover that city, and, after successively assuming the forms of the\r\neagle of Montefeltro, and the tree of Rovere, to disperse and vanish\r\nin the direction of Rome. Others saw serpents and similar monstrous\r\napparitions wrestling in mid-air, and contributed their quota to the\r\nstrange saws and marvellous instances which fed the popular craving\r\nfor prodigies. It is scarcely necessary to observe that these facts,\r\nor at all events their application, had called for no remark until\r\nmen's minds were filled with the catastrophe of which they were then\r\ninterpreted as the precursors. But it may be thought singular that\r\nthose who busied themselves in finding out ominous coincidences\r\nomitted to note a circumstance chronicled by the often-cited Diary,\r\nthat, on the 21st of August, 1604, nine months before the Prince's\r\nbirth, lightning struck the Duke's chamber at Castel Durante. Thunder\r\non the left was hailed by the Roman augurs as lucky, but this\r\nvisitation seems too violent for a good omen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe honours of a royal sepulture were lavished on one whose life had\r\nbeen thus unworthy of his station; and such was the magnificence\r\ndisplayed in the trappings of death that, besides many overcharged\r\nnarratives of the funeral, portraits were multiplied of the Prince\r\nlaid out in his richly-silvered robes. He was deposited in a tomb\r\nwhich Francesco Maria had destined for himself in the grotto or crypt\r\nof the metropolitan cathedral, with an inscription to the following\r\npurport:--\r\n\r\n  In this tomb,\r\n  Prepared for himself by\r\n  Francesco Maria II., Last Duke of Urbino,\r\n  Rest the ashes of\r\n  His son Federigo,\r\n  Who was cut off by a sudden death,\r\n  On the 29th June, MDCXXIII.,\r\n  Aged XVIII. years.\r\n\r\nOn a tablet in the church of Sta. Chiara, his fate is thus touchingly\r\ncommemorated:--\"The waning day saw Federigo Prince of Urbino, in whom\r\nsank the house della Rovere, sound in health, and pre-eminent in\r\nevery gift of fortune; the succeeding dawn beheld him struck down by\r\nsudden death, on the 29th of June, 1623. Stranger! pass on, and learn\r\nthat happiness, like the brittle glass, just when brightest is most\r\nfragile.\"[109]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: See these and other monumental inscriptions of Urbino\r\nsovereigns, Appendix, No. VII.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first year of the Prince's marriage had given him a daughter,\r\nborn at Pesaro, on the 7th of February, 1622, whose advent, as we\r\nlearn from her grandfather's Diary, was marked by the appearance of\r\nthree suns in the heavens. She was baptized Vittoria, and was hailed\r\nby the Duke and his people with joyful anticipations of a fruitful\r\nunion, which were destined never to be realised. Francesco Maria's\r\nage and infirmities cut off all hopes of a new alliance, and the\r\nmale line of the Rovere race, to whom were limited the ducal dignity\r\nand state, was obviously doomed to extinction in his person. It was\r\ntrue that a similar failure of rightful heirs had, in the preceding\r\ncentury, been supplied by a substitution of the heir-general to this\r\nvery fief; but that transaction was, in fact, a new investiture,\r\ndictated by papal nepotism, and scarcely veiled under the guise of\r\na heritable title. The spirit of the papacy had, since then, been\r\ngreatly changed in the ordeal of the Reformation; and the ambition of\r\nits successive heads, purified from selfish motives, had been long\r\nconcentrated upon advancing the spiritual and temporal supremacy of\r\nthe Holy See. But here the question rested not merely on such general\r\nprinciples of law and policy. The foresight of Paul V. had interposed\r\na barrier clause in the marriage contract of Federigo, whereby the\r\nGrand Duke's solemn renunciation of all pretensions in behalf of the\r\nfemale issue of that union was distinctly recorded.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the widowed princess had rallied a little from an advent\r\nwhich, however shocking to her nerves, could not be supposed\r\nvery long to weigh upon her feelings, she despatched a courier\r\nto Florence with the news, and soon prepared to leave for ever a\r\ncountry which she had adopted with bright hopes, quickly turned to\r\nbitter experience. After paying a brief visit to the Duke, in whose\r\nhands she left her child at Castel Durante, she returned to her\r\nfamily, to forget the troubled dream of the last two years. That she\r\nsucceeded in banishing it from her thoughts may be presumed from her\r\nremarriage, three years after, to the Archduke Leopold of Austria;\r\nand it is interesting to notice that the latest jotting in the Diary\r\nof her former father-in-law, long after its regular entries had\r\nceased, runs thus:--\"On 26th March, 1626, Count delle Gabiccie was\r\nsent to Florence to visit Donna Claudia, Archduchess of Austria.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe situation into which Francesco Maria found himself thrown by the\r\nPrince's death was one requiring the support of all that philosophy\r\nwhich it had been the chief pursuit of his life to attain. His house\r\nwas desolate; his line suddenly extinguished; his sovereignty about\r\nto lapse. But these crushing blows were accompanied by aggravating\r\ncircumstances, which called for immediate exertion. The brief reign\r\nof Federigo had proved equally detrimental to his state and ruinous\r\nto himself. The government was falling to pieces, the finances\r\nwere in hopeless confusion. Thus was the literary retirement which\r\nthe Duke had thought to secure from the residue of his life rudely\r\ninterrupted, and the cares of sovereignty he had shaken off were\r\nthrown back upon him, more inextricable than ever. The good order at\r\nhome and influence abroad, from thirty-seven years of prudent and\r\npopular sway, had, in two brief years, been scattered, and there\r\nremained to the old man but the choice of recommencing the labours\r\nof a lifetime, or abandoning the reins of government now thrust back\r\ninto his unnerved hands. Judging from his dispositions and past\r\nhistory, it would not be difficult to conjecture which of these\r\nalternatives had the greater attraction; yet at this juncture, sense\r\nof duty for a time triumphed over the dictates of inclination, and\r\nFrancesco Maria showed himself every inch a monarch.\r\n\r\nAfter consulting for a few days with the Bishop of Pesaro, Count\r\nFrancesco Maria Mammiani, his favourite, and Count Giulio Giordani, a\r\nfriend of forty years' tried service, he thus matured his measures.\r\nThe papal chair being vacated by the death of Gregory XV., on the 8th\r\nof July, he sent to the College of Cardinals an official intimation\r\nof his son's death, and a full assurance of dutiful devotion. He\r\naccompanied the like notification to his subjects with an injunction\r\nfor the election of a new council of eight, to whom he proposed to\r\ncommit the administration of civil and criminal justice, for the\r\nburden of which his years were incompetent. To the widowed Princess\r\nhe made every overture which affectionate sympathy could suggest.\r\nFinally, he resumed the ducal mantle, and the functions which he had\r\nso unfortunately devolved; and, dismissing the whole administration\r\nwhich his son had employed, he entered upon the government, with\r\nthe assistance of a small but select cabinet. His first thoughts\r\nwere bestowed upon the destiny of his orphan granddaughter, and,\r\nnotwithstanding the suggestion of his counsellors, that he should\r\nkeep her as an instrument whereby the policy of neighbouring\r\npowers, who would doubtless aspire to so eligible a match, might be\r\nmade subservient to strengthen his relations abroad, he insisted\r\nupon some immediate arrangement, which would relieve him from the\r\napprehension of leaving unprotected a prize so tempting to papal or\r\nprincely ambition. The question was brought to a speedy solution by\r\na well-timed offer from the Grand Duke Ferdinand II. of Tuscany, to\r\nreceive and educate in his family his niece, and eventually to make\r\nher his consort, on condition of her being declared heiress of all\r\nthe Duke's allodial and personal property. To secure the intimate\r\nalliance and support of the Medici had, as we have seen, long been\r\nthe cherished policy of Francesco Maria, and the importance of a\r\nconnection sufficiently powerful to maintain the rights of the\r\nPrincess, in that revolution which must succeed immediately upon his\r\ndeath, was self-evident. But there was another consideration equally\r\ncogent, for, on the extinction of her father's family, nature and\r\nlaw pointed out her maternal cousin as the most suitable guardian of\r\nher childhood and education. Having decided in favour of a proposal\r\nat once advantageous to his granddaughter, and releasing him from\r\none of the greatest anxieties of his position, the Duke lost no time\r\nin sending her to the court of Tuscany, under protection of Count\r\nand Countess Mammiani. Indeed, these arrangements were all concluded\r\nwithin four months of his son's death.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of August, the conclave elected Cardinal Maffeo\r\nBarberini, of a family originally Florentine, who had only attained\r\nhis fifty-fifth year; a man respectable at once from his talents,\r\nhis habits of business, and his moral character. It was observed\r\nthat, during the sittings of the conclave, a hive of bees swarmed\r\nunder one of their windows, an incident rendered notable from\r\nthe Barberini carrying that insect in their arms. On ascending\r\nthe chair of St. Peter, the first business which occupied Urban\r\nVIII. was the important accession to the ecclesiastical state\r\npromised by the Prince of Urbino's death. There was no legal doubt\r\nthat the fief, limited to the male line of Guidobaldo II., must\r\nlapse on that of the old Duke; but the struggles whereby church\r\nvassals had formerly supplied, by steel or gold, similar defects\r\nof constitutional title, were not forgotten, and the College of\r\nCardinals looked upon the infant Princess as a subject of keen\r\ninterest.[*110] It was, therefore, not without jealousy that they\r\nlearned her sudden betrothal to so powerful a sovereign; and the\r\nPontiff's remonstrances, though avowedly grounded on the conclusion\r\nof that important transaction without enabling him to display his\r\nfriendly respect for the parties, were probably intended to keep\r\nthe arrangement open for after cavil. A brief interval supplied new\r\ngrounds for anxiety, on the arrival of a messenger from Francesco\r\nMaria with tidings of an overture on the part of the Emperor\r\nFerdinand II., directly at variance with the pretensions of the Holy\r\nSee. Ferdinand had accompanied his condolence with a proposal that\r\nthe Duke should recognise the imperial title to the countships of\r\nMontefeltro and Castel Durante on his death, as being original fiefs\r\nof the empire, and offered to renew the investiture of these in\r\nfavour of the infant heiress. But, faithful to his ecclesiastical\r\nallegiance, the Duke courteously declined availing himself of\r\na favour which seemed more likely to reawaken the slumbering\r\ncontroversies (though scarcely now the conflicts) between Guelph\r\nand Ghibelline, than to secure any available benefit to Princess\r\nVittoria. Pleading a disinclination to open up questions that might\r\ndisturb the peace of his declining years, he left it to the Emperor,\r\nwhen these should close, to transact any such arrangement directly\r\nwith the Holy See; a reply which pleased neither him nor the Grand\r\nDuke.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *110: Cf. _Memorie istoriche concernenti la devoluzione\r\ndello stato d'Urbino alla Sede Apostolica_ (Amsterdam, 1723).]\r\n\r\nThe Emperor being uncle of the Grand Duke, his proposition could\r\nnot be viewed in any other light than as an attempt to establish a\r\nlegal basis for whatever claims on the states of Urbino it might\r\nsuit the husband of Vittoria hereafter to make. It was accordingly\r\nmet by Urban with very decided measures. He delegated three prelates\r\nof tried fidelity to the circumjacent provinces of the Church, with\r\ninstructions to watch closely the affairs of the duchy, and, in case\r\nof any movement adverse to the ecclesiastical interests, to march\r\ntroops at once across the frontier. He then made a formal appeal to\r\nthe Duke, as the faithful and devoted adherent of the Holy See, to\r\nresign into its safe custody S. Leo, which, besides being considered\r\nthe most impregnable fortress in Italy, was capital of the countship\r\nof Montefeltro, and formed part of the mortgage assigned by Clement\r\nVII. to the Medici, in security for alleged debts, still unsettled\r\nsince the usurpation of Lorenzo de' Medici. This unceremonious\r\nproposition was accompanied by a distinct avowal of the Pope's\r\nresolve to make sure of the devolution to the ecclesiastical state of\r\nevery morsel of the dukedom; and an intimation that any refusal would\r\nnecessitate military demonstrations at Rimini and Città di Castello.\r\nSo decided, indeed, was his Holiness to abate nothing of the renown\r\nwhich he anticipated from effecting this important accession to\r\nthe pontifical temporalities, that he is said to have avowed his\r\nresolution to fall under the walls of Urbino, or be hanged on its\r\nbattlements, rather than yield one tittle of his demands.[*111]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *111: It is curious to note the shameless zeal, astuteness,\r\nand cunning of the papacy in this matter. I believe a work on the\r\nsubject is promised by Professor C. SCOTONI. The Pope could\r\nnot have proved his right to Urbino in any tribunal. His claim was\r\nreally more absurd than the claim of the Emperor.]\r\n\r\nBut this precipitation failed in its object. The Duke was startled\r\nby what seemed at best a harsh return for the leal and true faith\r\ntowards his ecclesiastical over-lord which had actuated his conduct.\r\nHis suspicions thus aroused placed him on the defensive in his\r\ninterviews with the legate Pavoni, whose persuasions were coldly\r\nrepelled, and whose tone of menace called up all the old man's pride.\r\nHe briefly and indignantly replied that death alone should deprive\r\nhim of a sovereignty which he was fully able to maintain; that the\r\nextinction of his family was a dispensation of God; but that the\r\nPontiff's demand was an insinuation against his good faith, which\r\nwas far beyond question; finally, that his Holiness would do well\r\nto await the close of his few remaining days, when he would obtain\r\neverything in the due course of nature. To show that he spoke in\r\nearnest, he the same night despatched a reinforcement to the garrison\r\nof S. Leo; and his jealousy being thoroughly awakened, he refused\r\nto perform the alternative which the Legate had, with modified\r\ntone, suggested as a satisfactory solution of the difficulty, by\r\nwriting a formal acknowledgment that his entire state was held under\r\nthe Church, and a promise to do no act that might compromise or\r\nprejudice her rights over it. Monsignor Pavoni, interpreting some\r\nhasty expression of the Duke into a dismissal, was about to set out\r\nfor Rome the same night; but, having remained till morning to allow\r\ntime for cooler consideration, he obtained, under the hand of his\r\nHighness, such a declaration as he had suggested. On his return, he\r\nmet Cardinal Cennino, another ambassador whom the impatient anxiety\r\nof Urban had despatched to insist with still greater urgency on the\r\noriginal terms. It were useless and irksome to follow the thread of\r\ndiplomatic intrigue now brought to bear on the poor bereaved Duke. He\r\nfelt himself demeaned even by the document which he had consented to\r\ngive; but when he found it was but a prelude to new demands,--when\r\nhe ascertained that a war establishment was ready along the\r\necclesiastical frontier to pounce upon his territory on the slightest\r\npretext,--and when he was actually called upon to administer to the\r\ngovernors of his principal fortresses, and to the officers in command\r\nof his militia, an oath ensuring their allegiance to the Pope from\r\nthe day of his own death, accompanied with a promise on his part not\r\nto appoint any one to those situations who had not taken a similar\r\noath, indignation brought on an attack of illness which had nearly\r\nput an end to all difficulties by carrying him to the grave. This\r\nnew misfortune, far from obtaining for the old man relief from these\r\npersecutions, stimulated the papal emissaries who surrounded him to\r\nfresh importunities. Urban's apprehensions were augmented by measures\r\nwhich Francesco Maria had taken for garrisoning his principal\r\nfortresses with troops from Tuscany and Naples, and by rumours of a\r\nnew intrigue for transferring the hand of Vittoria to Leopold, son\r\nof the Emperor, thus giving to the latter a direct interest in this\r\nalready involved dispute, which Philip IV. of Spain, jealous of the\r\nprospective aggrandisement of the Church, showed every disposition\r\nstill further to complicate. The Pope, in order to forward his views\r\nupon the duchy, had, without consulting the Duke, promoted Monsignor\r\nPaulo Emilio Santorio from the see of Cesena to be Archbishop of\r\nUrbino, a man of violent temper and coarse manners, whose nomination\r\nwas regarded as an insult by Francesco Maria, and who injudiciously\r\nsubstituted threats for conciliation in his intercourse with the\r\nDuke. This example was followed by subordinate agents who surrounded\r\nhis sick bed, and wore him out by alternately working on his\r\nirritable disposition, his avarice, and his superstitious belief in\r\nastrology. Every turn of his malady was watched, and reported to Rome\r\nas matter of hope or fresh anxiety, whilst his palace was beset by\r\ntroublesome and meddling spies.\r\n\r\nNor were his negotiations with the Pontiff the only sources of\r\nirritation which daily accumulated upon the unhappy Francesco Maria.\r\nThe cares of state, from which he had of late escaped, returned more\r\nirksomely than before. The brief misgovernment of the Prince had\r\nthrown upon him a greatly aggravated burden of anxiety and labour\r\nin the direction of these affairs; and his old favourites and tried\r\ncounsellors were dropping around him, just at the crisis when he most\r\nrequired their services. His constitution, impaired by years and\r\nbroken by gout, gave way under his agony of mind, and a paralytic\r\nseizure made fresh breaches upon his system. With a frame thus\r\nenfeebled, a mind thus disgusted, he sent for Antonio Donato, a noble\r\nVenetian long resident at his court, who had been at various times\r\nemployed in political affairs, and addressed him in words which his\r\nNarrative of these events has preserved to us:--\r\n\r\n\"Your Lordship sees to what a condition God has reduced me. My house\r\nhe has left unto me desolate: he has taken from me my dominion, my\r\nhealth, and my honour. I have sold myself to one skilful in profiting\r\nby my misfortunes: I am reduced to the shadow of sovereignty, and\r\ncontinually exposed to new inroads. To await death in so miserable\r\na plight is impossible, to anticipate it were a crime: unable to\r\nrecover what is gone from me, all now left me is to die without\r\ndisgrace, after living for seventy-six years with nothing to regret.\r\nTo you I would impart my ideas, that we may consider whether, by\r\nsurrendering what remains, I might mitigate my vexations. I think of\r\nentreating the Pope to send me any one he pleases, who may govern\r\nthis country, dependent upon me and by virtue of my authority, which\r\nI shall delegate to him as fully as it is vested in my person.\r\nThus may his Holiness more effectually secure the return of these\r\nstates after my death under the sway of the Church, and thus will\r\nhe be enabled to liberate me from the restraint of obligations and\r\noaths, no longer necessary when his own deputy is invested with the\r\ngovernment, leaving me, in these my last hours, time to think of\r\ndeath, and to prepare myself suitably to meet it, as I well know it\r\ncannot be distant.... And perhaps this plan, which I own is hard\r\nto digest, may be less irksome in practice than it now seems in\r\ndiscussion; for in truth, I am no longer what I once was, nor ought\r\nI at this juncture to think but of my people's peace and my own.\r\nAfter all that has occurred, this ecclesiastical governor may prove\r\nthe least annoying expedient; at all events it will free me from the\r\nirritation and slavery which past events have brought upon me.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having at first argued against the measure thus suggested,\r\nDonato was at length induced to carry the proposal formally to the\r\nPope, without previous consultation with any one else. Suspicious\r\nperhaps of so sudden a change in the sentiments of Francesco Maria,\r\nthe Sacred College raised difficulties in order to gain time for\r\ndeliberation; but when, with his wonted impatience, he proposed to\r\nrecall Donato and reconsider the matter, with a view to some other\r\nmeasure, the proffered devolution was accepted without further delay.\r\nThe papal brief to that effect was dated the 10th December, 1624,\r\nand on the 20th, the Duke executed a blank warrant, making over his\r\nwhole sovereign authority to the governor who might be named, and\r\nreserving only the empty name of his subject's allegiance.\r\n\r\nThe Devolution was effected on the following terms. Along with all\r\nsovereign rights, there were conveyed to the Holy See the various\r\nfortified places in the duchy, and the residences at Urbino, Pesaro,\r\nand S. Leo. The Camera was allowed a preference in purchasing\r\nsuch warlike instruments, ammunition, and stores, as these places\r\nmight contain, and was to pay to the Duke 100,000 scudi in name of\r\nexpenses and ameliorations. To him and his heirs were reserved the\r\nfurniture and movables in these three residences, and the whole\r\nallodial possessions of the family, including the palaces of Castel\r\nDurante, Sinigaglia, Gubbio, Cagli, Fossombrone, Novilara, and Della\r\nCarda; the _palazzetti_ or villas of Imperiale, Montebello, Monte\r\nBerticchio, Mirafiori, Velletta, and Barchetto, the three last being\r\nat Pesaro; many parks, forests, vineyards, houses, and particularly\r\nthirty-two mills. The Grand Duke of Tuscany was a party to the deed\r\nof devolution, which was executed on the 30th April, 1624, and he\r\ntherein specially renounced for himself and his family all claim\r\nto the dukedom and states.[112] The assertion of Muratori, that\r\nFrancesco Maria often regretted this step is not borne out by any\r\nauthorities I have consulted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: Oliveriana MSS. No. 324. Many documents regarding\r\nthese transactions are printed in Riposati, vol. II.]\r\n\r\nIn these arrangements the party most immediately interested had no\r\nvoice, for the consent of the governed was then little studied in\r\nsuch transactions. Though the eloquent historian of the Italian\r\nrepublics maintains, upon true Guelphic principles, the blessings\r\nof the ecclesiastical sway compared with that of the petty\r\nseigneurs,[*113] those who have read the preceding chapters may\r\nhesitate ere they apply this doctrine to the duchy of Urbino. Four\r\ntimes have we seen the people throw off the transient rule of the\r\nChurch, and recall their native princes to maintain that microscopic\r\nnationality which, to an Italian, is far dearer than personal\r\nliberty. Guicciardini admits that those who, under the princes,\r\nwere maintained in ease with little personal exertion, generally\r\nhated papal domination. But under the popular dynasty of those dukes\r\nwhose lives we have endeavoured to sketch, the loyalty implanted\r\nby selfishness was watered by affection, until its mature growth\r\novershadowed the land. The extinction of their race was therefore\r\nbewailed by a grateful people, whose degradation to provincialism was\r\nfelt as a still greater, and, in the circumstances, an irremediable\r\nmisfortune.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *113: Here I heartily agree with Dennistoun. If the people\r\npreferred the ecclesiastical sway to that of the Signori, why was the\r\nwhole state of Urbino so eager to get Francesco Maria II. married?\r\nAnd if we want another example from more recent times, why, in 1860,\r\ndid the people of Perugia turn out _en masse_ and tear down the papal\r\nfortress, leaving a desert, which they still gloat over, in its\r\nplace? The temporal rule of the Church has been bad everywhere at all\r\ntimes and in every way. That is why we have beggared her.]\r\n\r\nIt is but justice to Urban to contrast his conduct on this occasion\r\nwith the eagerness displayed by many of his predecessors for the\r\naggrandisement of their own houses, by investing them with the lapsed\r\nfiefs of the Church. The obstacles to such an arrangement were no\r\ndoubt increased by the altered spirit of the age, by the curtailed\r\ninfluence of the papacy, by the watchful jealousy of the great\r\npowers, and by numerous bulls directed against such alienations. Yet\r\nother ambitious pontiffs had trampled upon parchments, had braved\r\npublic opinion, and had deluged Italy in blood for less tempting\r\nbaits, and Muratori hints that such an attempt might, in the present\r\ncase, have been sanctioned by Spain. Whilst, therefore, we blame the\r\ndiscourteous manner in which his Holiness made the aged Duke feel,\r\nwith unnecessary acuteness, his bereaved and enfeebled position, we\r\ngive him credit for a self-denying policy becoming the head of a\r\nChristian church.[*114]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *114: This is amusing of Urban VIII., of whom Pasquino\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n     \"_Quod non fecerunt Barbari\r\n     Fecerunt Barberini._\"]\r\n\r\nThe first governor delegated by the Pope was Monsignor Berlinghieri\r\nGessi, Bishop of Rimini, who took possession on the 1st January,\r\n1625. The Duke assigned to him his palaces, and a salary of 2000\r\nscudi, paying also the other officials, and the only internal change\r\nin the government was the dismissal of the council of Eight. Indeed,\r\nthe deference shown by the people for those forms under which they\r\nhad long been governed, obtained a guarantee for their continuance\r\nduring ten years; and we are told that the chief innovation upon\r\nthem consisted in an extension of literary academies, which had been\r\ndiscouraged by Francesco Maria on an apprehension of their taking\r\na political tendency.[115] In January, 1626, the Bishop received a\r\nscarlet hat, and was succeeded as governor three years subsequently\r\nby Monsignor Lorenzo Campeggi, Bishop of Cesena, afterwards of\r\nSinigaglia who held that office until the death of Francesco Maria.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: Brit. Mus. Lib. Add. MSS. Ital. No. 8511, art. 3.]\r\n\r\nBut, though happy to escape from the personal superintendence of the\r\ngovernment,\r\n\r\n     \"The old man, broken with the storms of state,\"\r\n\r\ndid not consider himself exempted from all concern in the welfare of\r\nhis subjects. We accordingly find, in a collection of his letters\r\nmade by his secretary Babucci,[116] a very long remonstrance\r\naddressed to Cardinal Gessi regarding certain malversations in the\r\nmanagement of public affairs. His complaints were directed against\r\nabuses of patronage, by conferring places of trust upon young and\r\ninexperienced persons, especially in the army, where many officers\r\nwere rather children than soldiers; against a laxity of manners\r\nand conversation among the women, extending even to the nunneries;\r\nagainst the indiscriminate bearing of arms, which had already led to\r\nnumerous homicides, and to the extirpation of game in the preserves.\r\nTo Campeggi, the next governor, he complains, in 1628, of an\r\nincreasing expenditure with impaired revenues.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: Dr. Antonio Babucci transcribed for the press a number\r\nof letters written by the Duke after the Devolution, and dedicated\r\nthem to the Grand Duchess Vittoria. The MS. is preserved in the\r\nMagliabechiana Library, class xxv. No. 77, and fully bears out the\r\ncommendation we have given to his epistolary style at p. 213.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\n     The Duke's monkish seclusion--His Death and Character--His\r\n     Portraits and Letters--Notices of Princess Vittoria\r\n     and her Inheritance--Fate of the Ducal Libraries--The\r\n     Duchy Incorporated with the Papal States--Results of the\r\n     Devolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter his release from the cares of state, and from all anxiety as to\r\nthe fate of his subjects and of his granddaughter, Francesco Maria\r\nwas left to employ his unimpaired powers of mind on more congenial\r\ntopics. His few remaining years were passed in the society of those\r\nmonks of the order of Minims,[*117] whom he had brought to the new\r\nconvent, and who had been selected for their literary acquirements.\r\nHe made them the companions and aids of his studies, and discussed\r\nwith them such subjects as his reading suggested. Though ever\r\nrespectful of the doctrines and observances of religion, fanaticism\r\nhad no part in his character; and it is clear from his last will,\r\nand other evidence, that, in circumstances peculiarly favourable to\r\nan undue exercise of priestly influence, he kept himself free from\r\nits thraldom. Yet was he exemplary in pious preparation for the\r\nchange which his sinking frame, as well as his philosophy, taught\r\nhim to regard as at hand. To blighted hopes, parental anguish, and\r\na desolate old age, were added great bodily sufferings. Gout, to\r\nwhich he had been subject from his thirty-fourth year, had by degrees\r\nso twisted his limbs that he was fed like a child, and a fresh\r\nparalytic seizure at length completed his decrepitude. Still, amid\r\n\r\n     \"The waste and injury of time and tide,\"\r\n\r\nhis mind continued unclouded. To the end his letters maintained their\r\nclear and graceful style; and the frequent correspondence he kept up\r\nwith his granddaughter, a child in years rather than in ideas, formed\r\nthe latest link that connected his thoughts and hopes with mundane\r\nobjects. Of this correspondence, so creditable to the hearts of the\r\nwriters, a few specimens will be found at p. 220.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *117: An order not of monks but of friars, founded by\r\nS. Francis of Paola in Calabria in 1436. The rule is based on the\r\nFranciscan, and the religious are mendicants.]\r\n\r\nThe registers of the Roman convent of Minims of S. Lorenzo[*118]\r\nenable us to trace the closing scenes of the old man's feeble\r\nexistence. During the autumn of 1630 a change took place, and he was\r\nchiefly confined to bed during the subsequent winter. The rapid decay\r\nof his digestive organs was accelerated by rigid fastings during\r\nLent, in which he persisted despite of his confessor's remonstrances.\r\nFrom the debilitating effects of this discipline, exhausted nature\r\ncould not rally; but life ebbed so slowly, that four days elapsed\r\nafter extreme unction had been administered, ere his flickering pulse\r\nwas still. At length, on the 28th of April, 1631, he passed away,\r\nbewailed by his subjects, regretted by all Italy. To the citizens of\r\nCastel Durante his death was an especial bereavement. \"They wept for\r\na beloved father, the chastener of the bad, the rewarder of the good,\r\nthe stay and advocate of the poor, the protector of the orphan, the\r\nsupport of the weak and oppressed, the consoler of the afflicted, the\r\nbenefactor of all.\"[119] Thus deprived of the glorious and desired\r\nshade and shelter of their goodly OAK, which, transplanted\r\nfrom the Ligurian shores, had branched out so boldly in their\r\nmountain soil, his people saw their independence extinguished, and\r\ntheir position in provincial insignificance riveted for ever.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *118: This I know not. Their present _Casa generalizia_ is\r\nat S. Andrea delle Fratte. The basilica of S. Lorenzo is now in the\r\ncare of the Franciscans.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: CIMARELLI, _Istoria dello Stato d'Urbino_.]\r\n\r\nHe lay in state during two days, arrayed in the ducal mantle of\r\nsilver tissue lined with purple taffetas; on his head a coronet\r\nof gold surmounted the velvet cap of maintenance; the collar of\r\nthe Fleece was on his neck, the ring on his finger, the sceptre in\r\nhis hand. In these trappings of sovereignty, a last tribute to the\r\nstation which he had quitted for ever, and which none remained to\r\nfill, he was by his own desire interred. Seven years before, he had\r\nprepared for himself an unornamented tomb under the holy-water vase\r\nin the church of the Crucifixion, at Castel Durante. There he chose\r\nhis final resting-place, amid sites endeared as the scene of his\r\nyouthful sports, the relaxation of his busy manhood, the retreat\r\nof his chastened age. Thither he was escorted by a procession of\r\nfive hundred gentlemen, besides a numerous attendance of priests\r\nand monks. Each of the latter received a scudo and a pound of wax;\r\nand by one of them, Padre Ludovico Munaxho, the funeral oration was\r\npronounced. At his own desire, this prayer, from the liturgy of his\r\nchurch, was inscribed under the front, in lieu of epitaph:--\"O Lord,\r\nincline thine ear to our prayers, wherein we supplicate thy mercy,\r\nand that thou wouldst establish in peace, and in the realms of the\r\nelect, the soul of thy servant Francesco Maria II., Duke of Urbino,\r\nwhich thou hast summoned from this life, and that thou wouldst ordain\r\nit to be received into the company of thy saints, through Christ our\r\nSaviour. Amen. He died in the year of God MDCXXXI., and of\r\nhis age LXXXIII.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANCESCO MARIA II., DUKE OF URBINO\r\n\r\n_From a picture once in the possession of James Dennistoun_]\r\n\r\nThe character of Francesco Maria presented many strange\r\ncontradictions. The manifold inconsistencies of his precepts and\r\npractice have already been pointed out; and the opinions of his\r\ncontemporaries varied, not only from the estimate with a perusal of\r\nsuch memorials as I have discovered of his reign would lead one to\r\nform, but also from each other. It may be well to give the judgments\r\nof those who had best opportunities of forming just conclusions,\r\nleaving the reader to reconcile their discrepancies. Donato, his\r\nchief counsellor in the Devolution of his state, whose experience was\r\nchiefly of his latter years, writes of him as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"For sixty years did he enjoy his dukedom, ever loved but ever\r\nfeared by his subjects, and highly esteemed by foreigners. Having\r\nhad always about him the most famous literary characters of his\r\ntime, having himself mastered many sciences, and read a multitude\r\nof books, it would be difficult in a few words to do justice to his\r\nfinished knowledge, to his acute genius, to his profound memory, to\r\nhis elegant and unaffected style in speaking and in writing, to his\r\nintimate acquaintance with natural history and geography, as well\r\nas with the political relations of states. Nor was he less skilled\r\nin the more important acquirements of theology and sacred subjects,\r\nupon which he was accustomed to dispute with those whose business\r\nit was to teach these doctrines. He was a prince of great piety, of\r\nexemplary manners, of austere address. He lived as a sovereign, but\r\nspoke like a simple gentleman. His modesty veiled the pride of his\r\nstation; his strict justice obtained for him the respect due to a\r\nking; his conduct was on all occasions exemplary. Fond of despatch,\r\nhe was impatient of dilatory measures and superfluous discussions. He\r\nwould have been a paragon for princes, and worthy of undying fame,\r\nhad not the irritability which unaccountably swayed his temper, and\r\nhis violent fits of passion in matters regarding himself, hurried him\r\nunrestrained by his many virtues into numerous excesses and errors.\r\nAmong such may be accounted his throwing up the reins to his son,\r\nhis abandoning himself to the guidance of favourites, his credulous\r\nadherence to first impressions, his abhorrence of those who had once\r\nalienated his regard. Timid and suspicious from his solitary habits,\r\nhe was averse to generosity, cautious in his expenditure, but,\r\npunctual to his promises, was fully to be relied upon for an exact\r\nperformance of his word. In person he was well-proportioned, neither\r\nstout nor thin. He was a good knight, skilled in arms and equestrian\r\nexercises; he was devoted to the chase and all manly exercises;\r\nattached to persons of accomplishment and high birth.\"\r\n\r\nThus speaks his courtier Donato; and he is in the main confirmed by\r\na somewhat less favourably coloured testimony from Gozze, who seems\r\nto have been a contemporary, and whose narrative is contained in No.\r\n324 of the Oliveriana MSS. According to it, he was singularly active,\r\nskilful in all manly exercises, and particularly fond of racket\r\nand of hunting. He was hasty in temper and in speech; impatient of\r\ncontradiction, and obstinate; so cunning that one scarcely knew when\r\nhe was in favour. He had much practical good sense, but was wayward,\r\ncholeric, discontented, selfishly inconsiderate of those about him,\r\nand, having taken offence, was apt to brood over and resent it. He\r\nwas most exact in business, and habitually regular in its duties;\r\npunctual in payments, but most strict in accounting with those who\r\nmanaged his affairs. He was fond of magnificence, and maintained a\r\nnumerous court, though less brilliant than his father's. He had but\r\none favourite at a time, keeping all others at a distance; indeed,\r\nhis stern manner overawed even when his words were gracious. He\r\nwas handsome, in person scrupulously nice, but neither effeminate\r\nnor extravagant in his habits. His disposition was retired and\r\nmelancholy, and he indulged it much by reading, writing, or walking\r\nin solitude. He was ostensibly devout, and was regular in the\r\nobservance of religious duties. He spoke and wrote very well and\r\nsolidly, studying a terse and simple style. His tastes were decidedly\r\nliterary, with a partiality for the graver sciences, and he ever\r\nmaintained about him persons distinguished in letters and art.\r\n\r\nWriting at an interval of nearly a century and a half after his\r\ndeath, but with the advantage of access to many original documents,\r\nPasseri thus characterises Francesco Maria II. \"In him military\r\nskill, intercourse with courts, and scientific studies, combined to\r\nform the rare instance of a sovereign philosopher. No prince of the\r\nday was more wise, more courtly, or more attached to his people; and\r\nhis systematic government by means of excellent ministers might be\r\nadopted as a model. To men of letters he paid the greatest honour,\r\nand he willingly sought their converse; none such ever passed through\r\nPesaro whom he did not receive with distinction. It was his desire to\r\nintroduce all sorts of manufactures, that his subjects might have no\r\noccasion to send their money abroad for the purchase of necessaries;\r\nindeed, they exported silks, woollens, leather, and majolica, which\r\nproduced a large balance over their imports. The improvement of\r\nagriculture shared his anxious care, and the means he adopted to\r\neffect this merit high encomium. He wrought to advantage the iron\r\nmines of Lamole, and those of copper at Gubbio. Thus did his state\r\nbecome populous and wealthy, while lightly taxed, for the expenses of\r\nhis court were nearly limited to the income of his private estates,\r\nand to the profits derived from the importation of grain out of the\r\ndominions of the Church. He maintained a sort of standing militia of\r\nthirteen thousand men in the pay of Spain, who, in peace, pursued\r\ntheir occupations at home, but, in war, were placed under the command\r\nof that power. From this arrangement great benefit resulted; for\r\nthus had the military spirit, for which the country had always been\r\nremarkable, an ample and safe outlet, whilst the talents so developed\r\noften led to individual distinctions and promotion.\"\r\n\r\nFrom a narrative of Urbino, compiled in 1648,[120] we gather one\r\nor two anecdotes of this Duke. When irritated he used to apply\r\ncontemptuous epithets to his various cities, founded upon the\r\ntemperament he had discovered in their inhabitants. Thus he called\r\nthe people of Urbino proud and foul-mouthed; those of Pesaro,\r\ncowards; of S. Leo, Mantuan sheep; of Cagli, bum-bailiffs; of\r\nFossombrone, tax-gathers; for the citizens of Mondavio alone he\r\nreserved a compliment, saying that they were born courtiers. Though\r\nfond of letters, he ever set his face against the establishment of\r\nacademies, alleging that they might degenerate into revolutionary\r\nconventicles. To the just views which guided his political\r\narrangements the best testimony is supplied by the fact above\r\nmentioned, that his people interceded for a prolongation of all\r\nhis government institutions during the ten years succeeding the\r\nDevolution, and that, Urban having consented, these were found so\r\nwell adapted to the well-being of the province, that they remained\r\nundisturbed after that period of probation had expired.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: Maruccelli MSS. C. No. 308.]\r\n\r\nIn person, Francesco Maria was handsome, and, from being puny and\r\nstunted in childhood, grew up active and graceful, but with a\r\ncomplexion of almost effeminate beauty. He was, therefore, fortunate\r\nin having for his court painter one whose men and women, as Sir\r\nJoshua Reynolds has happily remarked, seem nourished by roses.\r\nAlthough it is improbable that Baroccio executed the swaddled effigy\r\nof him in the Pitti Gallery, there can be little question that the\r\nfour portraits we shall now mention are by that artist. One of these,\r\nin the Tribune of the Uffizi at Florence, with a repetition of equal\r\nmerit in Baron Camuccini's choice collection at Rome, represents to\r\nperfection a strikingly elegant youth in the gorgeous uniform worn\r\non his naval expedition in 1571.[*121] There is in my possession a\r\nhalf-length, with one of Ambrogio Baroccio's curious timepieces\r\nupon the table, which came from the Durazzo Gallery at Genoa; and\r\nthe head introduced above, at p. 151, done in full manhood, when the\r\ncares of sovereignty had begun to furrow his features with \"lines\r\nof anxious thought,\" was purchased by me at Pesaro, in 1843. In the\r\nAntaldi Palace there, I saw a head of this Duke ascribed to Baroccio,\r\nbut evidently done some years after his death. It is a slight\r\nsketch, thrown off at a sitting, and painfully preserving features\r\nwhereon age and sickness, sorrow and anxiety, have set their seal.\r\nPortraiture can show no contrast more startling than that time-worn\r\nfigure, with glassy eye and ghastly visage, offers to the glowing\r\ncheek and gallant bearing of the richly accoutred hero of Lepanto.\r\nBut still more melancholy the change that had come over the man,\r\nthen gladsome in youthful beauty, rising fame, and chivalrous hope,\r\nburning to enjoy the advantages of high station, to maintain and\r\ntransmit the respect and popularity of a long-honoured name.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *121: No longer in the Tribuna, but in the Sala di\r\nBaroccio. It is the painter's masterpiece [Cat. No. 1119].]\r\n\r\nWe have referred to letters of the Duke written during his last\r\nyears, as interesting expressions of his state of mind. Besides\r\nthe collection of Babucci already quoted, a considerable number of\r\nthese are preserved in two other MSS. in the same library; also many\r\nothers, addressed by her relations to the Princess Vittoria, with\r\nher answers, dated between 1627 and 1632.[122] The whole exceed\r\ntwo hundred in number, and form a series of royal correspondence\r\nequally remarkable for Christian sentiment and domestic affections.\r\nIn the following pages we give literal translations of a few of\r\nthem, which pleasingly illustrate these virtues in the Duke and\r\nDuchess, in their daughter-in-law, now remarried to the Archduke\r\nLeopold, and in the young Princess herself. By the first letter, the\r\nArchduchess announces to her daughter the birth of a brother; by the\r\nsecond, Francesco Maria intimates his confidence in the husband he\r\nhad chosen for his grandchild. In Nos. 3 and 6 the warmth of his\r\nattachment to her is gracefully tinged with the pious resignation of\r\na dying Christian. Nos. 4 and 5 relate to his making over to her his\r\nfamily jewels, a precaution, perhaps, against any difficulties that\r\nmight arise after his decease. No. 7 was his last letter, dictated\r\nabout a month before his release from sufferings. The remaining four\r\nrefer to that event, and to the affliction of his nearest relatives.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: Magliabechiana MSS., class viii., Nos. 60, 61.]\r\n\r\n     1. _The Archduchess Claudia to the Princess Vittoria._\r\n\r\n     \"My most serene and beloved daughter,\r\n\r\n     \"Now that you have obtained from God your little brother,\r\n     after, as you tell me, having prayed for him (who, when he\r\n     is grown tall, will love you well), it remains for you to\r\n     thank the same God, who is the giver of all good. You say\r\n     that you wish to have this little brother for yourself; and\r\n     I agree to humour you under these conditions: First, that\r\n     your prayers obtain for me another next year; second, that\r\n     you come hither yourself to take him, so that you may have\r\n     the pleasure of seeing me, and I you; third, that, in the\r\n     meantime, you in everything obey Madam [the Dowager Grand\r\n     Duchess] and your other superiors, and that you often pray\r\n     for the health of the Lord Duke, to whom you owe so much.\r\n     And now I and my Lord your [step] father [the Archduke\r\n     Leopold] give you our blessing, beseeching for you a divine\r\n     one much more ample and perpetual. 3rd June, 1628.\r\n\r\n     \"Your most affectionate mother,\r\n\r\n     \"CLAUDIA.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     2. _The Duke Francesco Maria to the Princess Vittoria._\r\n\r\n     \"Your Highness having now attained the age of seven, his\r\n     serene Highness the Grand Duke, your betrothed husband, has\r\n     intimated to me that, the better to secure his intentions\r\n     in your behalf from the speculations and gossip of the\r\n     public, he will forthwith voluntarily contract with you\r\n     the sacred rite of marriage. But, as I have adopted my\r\n     measures, after taking every conjuncture into account, I\r\n     cannot allow myself to suppose any purpose of drawing back\r\n     in the mind of a prince of his station, endued with virtues\r\n     which must ever render him estimable to posterity, and a\r\n     worthy grandson of the great Ferdinand.

I too have\r\n     found it bitter, partly on your account, partly from my\r\n     own obligations. But considering that the good Lord has\r\n     gone from us at an age when life began to be a burden,\r\n     and death desirable, I resign myself to the divine will,\r\n     conforming to that which He had from eternity ordained.\r\n     This surely you also have done, after the first bursts of\r\n     feeling, to which, rather than to your reason, I ascribe\r\n     your lamenting to me your bereavement of him as a loss of\r\n     all support, and your entire abandonment.

From Inspruck, the 24th May, 1631.\r\n\r\n     \"Your most affectionate mother from the heart,\r\n\r\n     \"CLAUDIA.\"\r\n\r\nPrincess Vittoria seems to have merited the affections of her\r\nrelations, so warmly expressed in these and many similar letters. On\r\narriving at her future capital, she had been placed for education\r\nin a convent, where her progress was so rapid that before she was\r\neight years old, she composed as well as penned her letters, and\r\nwithin two other years could write them in Spanish. From the period\r\nof her betrothal, she was always addressed as Grand Duchess, and her\r\nmarriage was privately celebrated in 1633, when she was under twelve,\r\nher husband being then double her age. Four years later, the public\r\ncelebration of this union took place with suitable demonstrations of\r\njoy, and in due time it produced two sons, Cosimo, afterwards Grand\r\nDuke, and Francesco Maria, Cardinal de' Medici. In her grandson, the\r\nGrand Duke Giovanni Gaston, the male line of the Medici expired in\r\n1737, when their state passed to the house of Lorraine. The portraits\r\nof Vittoria preserved in the Pitti Gallery represent her as an\r\novergrown but comely matron, of good-humoured expression. Her matured\r\ncharacter did not realise its early promise. Proud, vain, suspicious,\r\nand weak, she inherited her grandfather's predilection for the\r\nsociety of priests; and her bigotry, increasing with her years, so\r\ncontrasted with the frank and lively temperament of her husband, that\r\na separation became advisable. These faults she transmitted to her\r\nfavourite son Cosimo, under whose reign they bred many public evils.\r\nShe died in 1694, after twenty-four years of widowhood, disliked by\r\nher subjects as much as her husband had been esteemed. The Duchess\r\nLivia retired a few weeks after her bereavement to her paternal\r\nestate of Castel Leo, near Sassoferrato, where she lived in great\r\nretirement, and in religious exercises, varied by visits to Assisi\r\nand Loreto. She left her whole property to her granddaughter the\r\nGrand Duchess Vittoria.\r\n\r\nThe Duke must have taken great pleasure in will-making, as his Diary\r\nfrequently mentions his being employed in that way. At his death it\r\nwould seem that more than one valid testament was found, the general\r\nprovisions of which, as stated in a contemporary abstract,[123] were\r\nas follows:--He desired to be buried in the church of the Crucifixion\r\nat Castel Durante, and that two thousand masses should be said for\r\nhis soul. He instituted his granddaughter Vittoria his universal\r\nheir and executrix, burdened with these legacies: To his Duchess\r\nLivia, 50,000 scudi, and an annuity of 4000 scudi; to his sister,\r\nthe Marchioness del Vasto, the palace and garden at Montebello, in\r\nwhich she was living; to the Marquis of Pescara, a jewel, a gold\r\nwatch, and 2000 scudi; to the Duke of Modena, the Marquis del Vasto,\r\nand the Cardinals Farnese and de' Medici, each a gold watch; to the\r\nZoccolantine monastery in the park of Castel Durante, 50,000 scudi;\r\namong his servants 12,000 scudi; to the community of Urbino, the\r\nlibrary of MSS. and printed books in his palace there, with the\r\nCampo dei Galli under the fortress for maintenance of a librarian;\r\nto the convent of Minims, at Castel Durante, the library he had at\r\nthat residence. In case of the death of his granddaughter without\r\nissue, he substituted the Dukes of Parma, Modena, and Aiello, to his\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: Magliabechiana MSS., class viii., No. 74.]\r\n\r\nThe inheritance thus conveyed was immense. The lowest estimate I\r\nhave seen states its amount at 2,000,000 of golden scudi, though\r\nprobably somewhat impaired by a litigation which arose with the\r\nCamera Apostolica, in consequence of involved questions, as to what\r\nwere public and what allodial rights of the late Duke. It included\r\nlands in Naples worth 50,000 scudi, and estates in the duchy, which,\r\nin 1648, were computed to yield 15,000 scudi a year, besides the\r\nresidences and their dependencies, worth 4000 more.[124] The personal\r\nproperty was valued at 340,000 ducats, exclusive of family jewels\r\npreviously sent to the Princess, and of the libraries otherwise\r\nbequeathed.[125]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: Maruccelli MSS. C. No. 308. Mercurius Gallicus, 1624.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: Such particulars of the wardrobe inventory as relate\r\nto objects of art are included in the last No. of the Appendix.]\r\n\r\nThe fate of the two famous Urbino libraries deserves more special\r\ninquiry, and it is very disappointing to offer but a meagre result.\r\nThose who have glanced over our eighth chapter will be aware that\r\nthe collection of MSS. made by Duke Federigo was the wonder of his\r\nage, and the admiration of all who have celebrated the glories of\r\nhis lettered dynasty. The circumstances under which it was amassed,\r\nthe accommodation provided for it in the palace of Urbino, and the\r\nmost beautiful of its contents, have already been introduced to the\r\nreader. The losses it had sustained during the Borgian usurpation\r\nby plunder and accident were, we are assured by Paulo Maria, bishop\r\nof that metropolitan see, nearly supplied by the anxious care of\r\nsucceeding Dukes; and, though none of these appear to have been\r\nbibliomanes, literary as they were in taste, and ever surrounded\r\nby men of high acquirement, it may be supposed that their library\r\nwas from time to time recruited with works issuing from the press.\r\nBut this casual supply was inadequate to the wants of the studious\r\nFrancesco Maria II. Instead of disturbing the old library at Urbino,\r\nhe drew from all quarters to his residence at Pesaro a numerous and\r\nchoice store of printed books which he eventually transported to\r\nCastel Durante, for the amusement of his leisure hours.\r\n\r\nSuch were the two libraries separately bequeathed by the Duke's will,\r\nto which we have just referred. He left \"to the community of Urbino\r\nhis library of MSS. in that city, as well as all MSS. and drawings in\r\nthat of Castel Durante, as soon as they can be transported thither;\r\nand, in order that the said community may maintain a person to take\r\ncharge thereof, he conveyed to them certain lands for his support;\r\nexpressly enjoining that the said library shall never be removed\r\nfrom the place where it then was, nor be diminished by a single\r\nvolume, under forfeiture of their right thereto, in favour of the\r\ncompany Confraternita della Grotta of Urbino.\" The library remained\r\nunder charge of Vittorio Venturelli, a man of some literary note; but\r\nere many years had elapsed, the destination by Francesco Maria was\r\ndefeated. In 1657, the community had formal notice from Alexander\r\nVII. of his wish to transport the collection to the Vatican, \"for the\r\nincrease of its splendour, and the benefit of Christendom.\" After\r\nsome delay and hesitation, this proposal was reluctantly acceded to\r\nby the magistracy, who took the opportunity of stipulating certain\r\nfavours and immunities for the public. The chief of these were a\r\ndiminution of the contingent of interest payable by Urbino on the\r\nstate debt; exemption from certain imposts; the establishment there\r\nof educational institutions under charge of the Jesuits; the removal\r\nthither from Urbania of the Minims, with the other library left to\r\nthem by the late Duke; an annual sum for repairs of the ducal palace;\r\nthe preservation of their library in the Vatican under its proper\r\nname, and the perpetual appointment of a native of their city among\r\nthe librarians there; lastly, a surrender to the community of the\r\nproperty bequeathed for the support of their librarian. The Pope's\r\ninterference seems to have been suggested, or perhaps only excused,\r\nby a rumoured intention of the community to sell the collection to\r\nsome foreign prince. The MSS., numbering 1793 volumes, were finally\r\nsent to Rome in sixty-three cases; and a tradition is still current\r\nin Urbino that they were removed secretly, and during night, to the\r\nbitter mortification of the inhabitants, who regarded this as the\r\nlast relic of sovereignty and independence remaining to them, and who\r\nprobably esteemed it more as a monument of better days than from a\r\njust appreciation of its real value. The MSS. were assuredly worth\r\na far higher ransom than was obtained by the citizens, but there\r\ncan be little doubt that their safety and utility were enhanced by\r\nthe transfer. They were deposited in a section of the vast corridor\r\nat the Vatican, where an obscure lapidary inscription informs us\r\nthat \"in 1658, Alexander VII. added to the Vatican collection the\r\nancient MSS., of all sorts and in all languages, which formed the\r\nlibrary of Urbino, thereby insuring their preservation and proper\r\ntreatment, after compensating those who assigned over the boon.\"[126]\r\nThe printed books of this library, in number 233, were retained in\r\nUrbino.[127]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126:\r\n\r\n  Alexander VII. Pont. Max.\r\n  Antiqua omnis generis omniumque linguarum\r\n  Urbinatis bibliothecæ manuscripta volumina\r\n  Repenso cedentibus beneficio\r\n  D. tutiorem custodiam atque proprietatem\r\n  Vaticanæ adjunxit an. sal. MDCLVIII.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: Most of these particulars have been gleaned from the\r\ncommunal archives at Urbino, R. No. 30.]\r\n\r\nIt remains to trace the library at Castel Durante. In the archives of\r\nthe Convent of Minims at S. Lorenzo in Lucina, at Rome, I discovered\r\na copy of a settlement by Francesco Maria, dated 1628, in which\r\nhe leaves the Minims of the Crucifixion, at Castel Durante, \"all\r\nthe library of printed books which may be in Castel Durante,\" with\r\nthe room in which they are, and the shelving, etc.; but under an\r\nobligation \"that before taking possession thereof, they shall without\r\ndelay send to the library of Urbino, at the expense of the heir, all\r\nsuch MSS. and books of designs as may be among them.\" There is also\r\na special condition that, if these monks permit any part, however\r\nsmall, of the collection to be removed from thence or transported\r\nelsewhere, the bequest shall lapse to the Confraternita della Grotta,\r\nat Urbino; and a small provision is made for maintaining a librarian.\r\nThe active interest taken by Urban VIII. in Castel Durante (now\r\nUrbania) did not overlook the benefit which such a public library\r\nwas likely to afford to that town, and he provided for its perpetual\r\nsecurity by proclaiming ecclesiastical censures against such as\r\nshould dilapidate or carry it away.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty-seven years after the Duke's death, Alexander VII.,\r\nbeing at a loss how to furnish with books the library of his\r\nnewly-erected university, the Sapienza, at Rome, bethought himself\r\nof the collection at Castel Durante; and on the assumption of its\r\nvery limited utility there, and of the excellent purpose to which it\r\nmight be made subservient at the Sapienza, transported it thither.\r\nHe had previously obtained a sort of forced consent on the part of\r\nthe monks of the Crucifixion to this arrangement, by promising to\r\nthe convent of their order at Rome the custody of the new library,\r\nand other favours: the opposition of the Confraternita della Grotta\r\nhe had also neutralised, by purchasing their reversionary interest\r\nin the bequest. The transaction was enveloped in great secrecy, in\r\nanticipation of opposition from the grand-ducal family, or from the\r\ncitizens of Castel Durante; indeed, when the removal of the books\r\nwas begun, the latter manifested such indignation and discontent,\r\nthat about five hundred volumes were allowed to remain for their use.\r\nNotwithstanding this concession, and their unwillingness to agree to\r\nthe arrangement, the monks were for a long time greatly persecuted by\r\nthe people; their Provost fled in terror of his life, and nothing but\r\ndread of papal censures would have induced their compliance. Upon the\r\npretext that persons bound to reside in a cloister, at some distance,\r\ncould not be efficient guardians of the new library at Rome, even\r\nthe promised boon was withheld from their brethren of S. Lorenzo,\r\nwho received in compensation the lectureship of moral philosophy at\r\nthe Sapienza, along with certain exemptions affecting the internal\r\ndiscipline of their order.\r\n\r\nThe consulting catalogue of the Vatican Urbino MSS., now used by\r\nthe librarians, was compiled in 1797 by Mauro Coster, and being\r\nalphabetical, does not show the number of MSS.; but the numeration\r\nof articles exceeds 4000. In it, at No. 1388, will be found another\r\ncatalogue by Stefano Gradio, wherein the numeration of volumes, many\r\nof them containing several articles, amounts to 1361; but in the\r\ngeneral catalogue for reference, the volumes are only 1026. Under\r\nthe regulations prohibiting indiscriminate access to the Vatican\r\ncatalogues, I have not been able satisfactorily to reconcile these\r\ndiscrepancies, nor to pronounce upon the accuracy of any of these\r\ncalculations; they, however, afford sufficient data to estimate\r\nthe extent of the Urbino MSS. Their value is probably greater in\r\nreference to their number than that of any other component portion of\r\nthe Vatican collection; indeed, than any existing library except the\r\nLaurentian; but this point, too, must remain unresolved, so long as\r\nthe present restrictions are maintained.[*128]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *128: I am not able to state more accurately than\r\nDennistoun the number of volumes from the Urbino collection now in\r\nthe Vatican. Unhappily there is not a library in all Italy that\r\npossesses a catalogue fit to use. For the MSS. to-day existing in the\r\nlibrary of the University at Urbino, see _Le Marche_, An. iv., p.\r\n212.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Duke's demise seemed to be certainly approaching,\r\nUrban had directed his nephew, Prince Taddeo Barberini,\r\ngeneral-in-chief of the ecclesiastical troops, to occupy the\r\nfrontier, who, on that event, marched through the state to receive\r\nits allegiance, and thus secured its unopposed Devolution to the\r\nHoly See, to the infinite satisfaction of the Pontiff. Another\r\nnephew, Cardinal Antonio Barberini, was soon after named Legate,\r\nunder whom the ancient Dukedom passed at once into its new position\r\nas a province of the papal state. But after a few months he resigned\r\nthe appointment, and it was bestowed upon his brother, Cardinal\r\nFrancesco, who, preferring Rome as a residence, governed the province\r\nfor many years by a vice-legate. The Pontiff, in proof of his\r\npaternal affection for his new subjects, conferred a Cardinal's hat\r\non the Bishop of Gubbio, and established in that town a branch of the\r\nInquisition!\r\n\r\nThe revenue drawn by the Camera from the state of Urbino, in the\r\nyears immediately subsequent to the Devolution, fell considerably\r\nshort of the expenses; but after the imposts had been augmented, the\r\nincome, in 1648, exceeded 40,000 scudi, leaving a balance at the\r\ncredit of the government. The population was then above two hundred\r\nthousand. The change from independent to provincial rank had already\r\nbecome painfully manifest. The vaunted fidelity of the natives was\r\ndegenerated into servility of demeanour. Everywhere their eyes rested\r\non some symptom of departed grandeur. The palaces of their dukes were\r\nfalling into neglect, crumbling and grass-grown; the gardens, overrun\r\nby rank weeds, sadly recalled days of past festivity; the degraded\r\ncastles testified to an impoverished and absentee nobility. The\r\nglories of Urbino were gone.[129]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: Maruccelli MSS. C. No. 308. See App. No. VIII. for\r\nstatistical notices of this period.]\r\n\r\nBut the cup was charged with a bitterness beyond these humiliations.\r\nSurrounded by ecclesiastical provinces, the inhabitants of the duchy\r\nhad long a foretaste of their coming fate, which amply accounted for\r\nthe exultation with which they had hailed the promised continuance\r\nof the ducal line, and their sullen despair on witnessing its\r\ninevitable extinction. The Venetian Relazioni, quoted by Ranke,\r\nsupply us with the opinion of disinterested contemporaries as to\r\nthe condition of the papal state during the seventeenth century.\r\nIn 1600, its \"nobles and people would gladly cast themselves upon\r\nany sovereign whatever, to escape from the hands into which they\r\nhad fallen.\" Ten years later, the very blood of the inhabitants\r\nwas wrung from them by excessive taxation, and their enterprise\r\nwas crushed by commercial restrictions. \"The foreign traders had\r\nquitted Ancona, the native merchants were bankrupt, the gentry\r\nimpoverished, the artizans ruined, the populace dispersing.\" A\r\nyear or two after the last Duke's death, his people are described\r\nas grumbling much at the change, calling the new government a\r\ntyranny, and sneering at the priests as interested solely in\r\naccumulating wealth, and aggrandising themselves. In 1666, we have\r\nthis calamitous but probably overcoloured picture:--\"It is palpably\r\nevident that the ecclesiastical realm is quite overburdened, so that\r\nmany landholders, unable to extract enough from their possessions\r\nto meet the extraordinary public imposts, resort of necessity to\r\nthe abandonment of their estates, in order to seek fortune and\r\nsustenance in less rapacious communities. I speak not of duties and\r\ncustoms, from which nothing eatable is excepted; because the taxes,\r\ndonatives, subsidies, and other extraordinary extortions would excite\r\npity and astonishment, even if the terrible commissioners sent\r\nfrom Rome into these cities, with absolute authority to inquire,\r\nsell, carry off, and confiscate, did not exceed all belief; no\r\nmonth ever passing without a flight of griffins and harpies, in the\r\nguise of commissioners, either of the fabric of St. Peter's, or of\r\npious bequests, or of movable goods, or of archives, or of some\r\nfive-and-twenty other Roman courts, by all which the already drained\r\npurses of the helpless subjects are tortured to the last degree. And\r\nthus,--setting aside Ferrara and Bologna, to which some consideration\r\nis extended, and which are favoured by nature and art with excellent\r\nsoil, and with manufacturing industry,--all other cities of Romagna,\r\nLa Marca, Umbria, the Patrimony, Sabina, and the Campagna are utterly\r\nwretched; and, to the disgrace of the Roman government, in none of\r\nthem do woollen or silk factories exist, nor even of gold stuffs,\r\nexcept in a few such little towns as Fossombrone, Pergola, Matelica,\r\nCamerino, and Norcia, although the abundance of wool and silk might\r\nafford a most advantageous trade. The ecclesiastical territory is\r\nmerely an estate leased out to tenants, who give no thought to its\r\nimprovement, but only to extract the greatest possible amount of\r\nits produce from the unhappy land, whose scourged and arid soil\r\nwill be unable to yield more than very barren crops to succeeding\r\noccupants.... The more hateful and abhorred they find themselves,\r\nthe more merciless do they become; and dragging their hats over\r\ntheir brows, they look no one in the face. They glean all sorts of\r\ncorn into their sheaves, intent wholly upon their own interests,\r\nwithout the smallest regard to the public.\" By the end of the\r\ncentury, matters had become worse, the country being \"depopulated\r\nand uncultivated, ruined by extortions, and destitute of industry.\"\r\nThe duchy of Urbino, which, according to the preceding extract, was\r\nthe last refuge of the silk trade, had then fallen into deep decay,\r\nand the corn commerce of La Marca was clogged by export dues and\r\ninjudicious restrictions.[130]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: The state of feeling in the duchy, even under the\r\ncomparatively beneficent sway of its native pope, Clement XI., may be\r\ninferred from an incident of trifling moment. Having obtained trace\r\nof a petition or remonstrance addressed to that Pontiff among the\r\nMSS. of the Bibliotheca Borbonica at Naples, I was refused a sight\r\nof it by the Archbishop then at the head of that library, on the\r\nground of its injurious allegations against the authorities. Verily\r\nsuch overcaution may defeat its own end, by leaving an exaggerated\r\nimpression of the mischief it would veil. So Gergorovius was turned\r\nout of the Vatican Library.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anderson_\r\n\r\nVITTORIA DELLA ROVERE, GRAND DUCHESS OF TUSCANY\r\n\r\n_From the picture by Sustermans in the Pitti Gallery, Florence_]\r\n\r\nThese plaintive notes might still [1859] find not a few echoes\r\nalong the papal coasts of the Adriatic--the focus of Italian\r\ndiscontent,--over-taxation to maintain a distant government being\r\never the burden of their song. But the question is not, in truth,\r\none of financial administration. However open to stricture the\r\nfiscal details may be, when tested by sound principles, the amount\r\nof revenue raised is moderate in consideration of the wealth there\r\nlavished by beneficent nature, in a degree denied to other not less\r\nburdened districts of the Peninsula. Nor can the papal sway, however\r\nobjectionable, be in fairness regarded as otherwise than mild. But\r\ncentralisation is necessarily alien to the spirit of a people long\r\nbroken up into miniature communities, as it was formerly uncongenial\r\nto their ancestors, whose personal pride, political influence,\r\nand hopes of promotion, equally turned upon the continuance of a\r\nsectional independence. Hence the popular dissatisfaction rests\r\nas much upon traditional evils as upon existing and obvious\r\nmisgovernment. Four centuries ago there were above a dozen capitals,\r\nflourishing in the balmy atmosphere of as many gay courts, and\r\nbasking in patronage and prosperity, all within the circuit of that\r\nprovince where now a few priestly legates perform the functions of\r\nsovereignty without either the taste or the means for indulging its\r\ntrappings, and dwell in princely palaces without the habits or the\r\npopularity of their ancient lords.\r\n\r\nBut these are not matters for casual discussion. From the accession\r\nof Count Guidantonio in 1404, till the Devolution by Duke Francesco\r\nMaria in 1624, this little state had enjoyed two hundred and twenty\r\nyears of a prosperity unknown to the neighbouring communities. Her\r\nsovereigns were distinguished in arts and arms, respected abroad,\r\nesteemed at home; her frontiers were comparatively exempt from\r\ninvasion, her tranquillity unruffled by domestic broils: within her\r\nnarrow limits were reared or sheltered many of the brightest names in\r\nliterature, science, and art; her court was the mirror of refinement,\r\nher capital the Athens of Italy. Since the Devolution, she has passed\r\nan equal number of lustres in provincial obscurity and neglect.\r\nIt has been the object of this work to portray somewhat of the\r\nsplendours of that former period, though the subject would require\r\ncolours more brilliant, and a hand more skilled. Here our task must\r\nclose, for to follow her destinies to their decline and fall were one\r\nof few attractions.\r\n\r\n     \"Kingdoms are shrunk to provinces, and chains\r\n     Clank over sceptred cities, nations melt\r\n     From power's high pinnacle, when they have felt\r\n     The sunshine for a while, and downward go!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK NINTH\r\n\r\nOF LITERATURE AND ART UNDER THE DUKES DELLA ROVERE AT URBINO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX\r\n\r\n     Italian literature subject to new influences--The\r\n     academies--Federigo Comandino--Guidobaldo del Monte--The\r\n     Paciotti--Leonardi--Muzio Oddi--Bernardino Baldi--Girolamo\r\n     Muzio--Federigo Bonaventura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For a long lapse of years, Italy had been an organised body of\r\nhighly civilised states, different in their origin, laws, and\r\nconstitutions, divided by local jealousies and opposite interests,\r\nconstantly engaged in their endeavours to establish a political\r\nequilibrium by the manoeuvres of a wary and even unprincipled\r\ndiplomacy, baffled oftentimes in their ambitious schemes, and brought\r\ninto sudden collision, but still deriving new energies from their\r\nvery rivalry, and promoting, with their own, the interests of social\r\nprogress.\"[131]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: MARIOTTI'S _Italy_, II., p. 177.]\r\n\r\nIt was in a state of things thus happily described that letters and\r\nart attained their zenith of glory in the Peninsula. But the close\r\nof the fifteenth century had introduced elements of change, which\r\na fatal policy permitted to spread. Those foreign aggressions and\r\ndomestic convulsions which we have seen extirpating nationality and\r\ncrushing independence were not less destructive to mind and its\r\nefforts. A struggle of thirty-five years against her ultramontane\r\ninvaders,--a series of unavailing because ill-directed and discordant\r\nefforts,--closed with the coronation of Charles V., and left Italy\r\nfor nearly two centuries at the mercy of Spain. The states which\r\nescaped the direct miseries of that iron domination, and retained\r\na nominal independence under the papal sway or their native\r\ndynasties, sank unresisting before an influence affecting at once\r\ntheir politics, their manners, and their literature. The pride of\r\nthe Spaniard had long been proverbial, and was little susceptible\r\nof modification even in a new country. The conquered race quickly\r\nconformed to fashions which they could neither shake off nor\r\nexclude. They aped a pompous bearing that sat with singularly bad\r\ngrace upon a vanquished people, and the affectation which at first\r\nloaded their language with fulsome epithets, soon corrupted their\r\nwritings by elaborate adulation. It is difficult for those whose\r\ntaste has been formed upon the models of a less copious language to\r\njudge fairly of Italian ornamental literature, for its authors, in\r\navailing themselves of the resources at their command, are prone to\r\nlavish them too unsparingly. When tried by such a standard their\r\nprose may seem tedious or tumid verbiage, their epics may teem with\r\noverstrained hyperbole, and even their lighter poetry may appear\r\nto substitute subtle conceits and elaborate epithets for graceful\r\nease and flexibility. But these idiomatic peculiarities are but\r\nechoes of the national genius, and ought not perhaps in fairness to\r\nbe subjected to canons of criticism unknown to their authors. Yet\r\nit cannot be denied that facilities such as the language of Italy\r\naffords to flowery composition are virtually premiums on feebleness,\r\nand that decorations of style afford a tempting disguise for\r\nindolence of mind or poverty of matter. The influence of petty courts\r\nwas peculiarly and fatally favourable to such qualities. Trifling\r\nincidents there assumed an importance that justified magniloquence\r\nbefitting loftier themes, whilst the narrow views common to limited\r\ncircles found ample scope in exaggerated phrases of metaphor and\r\nhyperbole. Thus came abundance without fertility, exuberance yielding\r\nonly redundancy.\r\n\r\nAssociations and clubs for political or social objects being\r\nthen incompatible equally with the spirit of governments and the\r\nhabits of the people, men readily formed themselves into religious\r\nconfraternities or literary academies. But these academies acted as\r\ndrags upon the progress of that literature which they were instituted\r\nto promote; they clogged its chariot wheels with devices originally\r\ndictated by pedantry, and soon degenerating into puerile verbiage.\r\nFrom the draughts of inflated poetry and corrupted rhetoric which\r\nthey manufactured, every stimulating ingredient was gradually\r\nwithdrawn, while opiates were freely introduced in their stead. They\r\nthus lulled to sleep what little public spirit had survived the\r\nsubjugation of the Peninsula; and the governments of the new régime,\r\nquickly aware of their emasculating tendencies, lavished upon them\r\npatronage until they deluged the land, and stifled the energies of\r\nthe national mind in all-prevailing mediocrity. The classic spirit\r\nof the fifteenth century had originated this mischief, by diverting\r\nletters from the sphere of popular sympathy, and nourishing that\r\naffectation to which an almost exclusive study of the dead languages\r\nmust ever lead. But the evil was aggravated by Spanish influence.\r\nIngrafting frigid forms and stately phrases upon the lively\r\nintercourse of a naturally light-hearted people, it did for the\r\nmanners what pedantry had effected for the letters of Italy. Nature\r\nand originality were replaced by imitation and servility. Parodies\r\nsuppressed inspiration, compliments chilled cordiality. In both\r\ncases genius languished, epithets multiplied, and terse and vigorous\r\ndiction passed with independence to happier lands.\r\n\r\nIn all histories of Italian literature the academies occupy a\r\nconspicuous place, and we have already noticed the Assorditi of\r\nUrbino, for whom municipal vanity has asserted an origin in the\r\nreign of Duke Federigo.[132] They appear to have occasionally met\r\nas early at least as that of his successor, although not formally\r\nconstituted until about 1520. Their name, like that of most similar\r\nassociations, being probably adopted from some foolish whim, the next\r\nstep was to invent a badge suited to the humour of the times, so they\r\nassumed \"the ship of Ulysses surrounded by sirens\"; and for motto,\r\nplaying at once on sound and sense _Canitur surdis_, \"They sing to\r\nthe deaf.\" The word _assorditi_ properly means \"the deafened,\" but\r\nits signification might be stretched by punning to include absurdity,\r\nniggardness, or filth, none of them very flattering qualities to\r\nconnect with the epithet. The rolls of this fantastic association\r\nincluded many authors who were harboured at Urbino, but it is in no\r\nway identified with their reputation. Having fallen into neglect, it\r\nwas revived in 1623, and, after nearly a century of provincialism,\r\nwas once more reconstituted in 1723.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: See vol. II., p. 112.]\r\n\r\nAs these literary associations rose, their predecessors, the\r\nscholastic academies, declined. That which Lorenzo the Magnificent\r\nhad founded at his villa of Carreggi, was closed in 1522, and\r\nPlatonism having consequently waned, the Stagirite philosophy was\r\nonce more master of the field. But another and more deadly struggle\r\nawaited it. When men began to study nature and base their reasonings\r\nupon her laws, the deficiencies of their old guide were detected, and\r\nits authority was impugned. Yet the peripatetic system was too deeply\r\nfounded to be at once dismissed, and the ingenuity of its disciples\r\nwas long directed to accommodate its dogmas to modern discoveries,--a\r\nvain effort which only divided their ranks and led them into\r\ninextricable dilemmas, until Galileo appeared \"to furnish forth\r\ncreation,\" and conduct them clear of the labyrinth by a silver thread\r\nof truth. But though a new light had dawned, new snares beset the\r\nway. From bold investigation and speculative inquiry, ecclesiastical\r\nauthority and civil despotism had much to lose, nothing to gain.\r\nTheir side was therefore soon chosen. War was declared against\r\nthought, backed by the whole armoury of oppression. Where prevention\r\nfailed, persecution followed, and the censor's veto was enforced by\r\nrack and faggot.\r\n\r\nThus was it that the Reformation had but an indirect influence on\r\nthe Italian mind. The scanty seeds wafted across the Alps fell upon\r\nstony ground, and ere long withered away. But the great reaction of\r\nthe papacy was not only directed against the new truths; it waged\r\nwar upon every thing calculated to afford them a disguise under\r\nwhich they might become dangerous. The policy of pontiffs and the\r\nduty of the Inquisition tended to exclude all light, lest any rays\r\nof Protestantism should reach the faithful. During three centuries\r\nhave these efforts been continued; and when we consider the talent by\r\nwhich they have been directed, the stern ministers by whom they have\r\nbeen carried out, we well may wonder that the Italian mind has not\r\nbeen utterly debased by foreign tyranny and priestly domination. They\r\nhave sown the wind; it remains to reap the whirlwind.\r\n\r\nThe fashion for classic imitation was succeeded in Italy by an\r\nage of rhetoricians, with Bembo at their head, and the academies\r\nas their strongholds. But they either encouraged or inadequately\r\nrepressed a too fluent facility which has ever since been the\r\nblemish of their mellifluous language. In Boccalini's satirical\r\n_Ragguagli di Parnaso_, some prolix writer is condemned to a perusal\r\nof Guicciardini's narrative of the Pisan war; but, after a brief\r\nessay, he avows his preference for the galleys to pursuing, through\r\ndreary details, the siege and capture of a pigeon-house. This biting\r\njest is applicable in a far greater degree to other writers of the\r\nsixteenth century, whose cumbrous grandiloquence is often diluted\r\nby trivialities, or tinselled with factitious pomp. Yet there were\r\nsome authors of purer taste, who resisted such extravagance, and it\r\nis curious to find Caro, della Casa, and Bernardo Tasso concerting\r\nmeasures for curtailing the use of superabundant compliments. The\r\ntwo principal points of their attack were the recent substitution\r\nof the feminine pronoun in the third person singular for the second\r\nperson plural in addressing any one, and the indiscriminate use\r\nof Lordship, Excellency, Gentility, as courteous phrases, to the\r\nentire exclusion of Master and Madam. Against the former of these\r\nabuses Caro and Tasso declare open war; but, although they unite in\r\ncondemnation of the latter as still more fatal to vernacular purity,\r\nand avow themselves ready to support any onset, each shrinks from\r\nleading the charge. \"This age of ours is altogether given up to\r\nadulation. Every one, in inditing a letter, bandies 'lordship'; all\r\nexpect it when addressed. And not, forsooth, our grandees alone,\r\nbut even the middle classes and the very plebeians aspire to such\r\ndistinctions, taking affront if they receive them not, and noting\r\nas blunderers all who do not offer them the like. Most silly and\r\nrevolting does it seem to me that we should have to speak to one\r\nperson as if he were another, always talking to a sort of ideal\r\nabstraction, quite different from the individual himself. Yet this\r\nabuse is now established and general.\" Thus far Caro, to whom Tasso\r\nreplies, \"Oh the wonderful charm of Italy, which every one seeks\r\nto destroy! It sufficed not that the Goths, the Vandals, and other\r\nstrange and barbarous nations have sought, and still seek, to possess\r\nthee, and that multitudes flock hither from earth's farthest corners;\r\neven Lordships, never previously seen or known here, quitting their\r\nnative Spain, are come in swarms to sojourn among us, and have so\r\nmastered our vanity and ambition that we cannot shake them from our\r\nshoulders.\" In a subsequent letter to Claudio Tolomei, Bernardo\r\ncongratulates him on having applied the lash to such empty titles,\r\nand promises to follow his example by retrenching them all when he\r\nrevises his own letters for the press.[133] But these attempts met\r\nwith little success; redundant superlatives still lead Italian\r\nliterature, and an Italian letter is little more than a tissue of\r\nexaggerated epithets, from its address to its signature.[134]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: _Lettere di Bernardo Tasso_, edit. 1733; vol. I., pp.\r\n14-22 and 427-30.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: In proof of this I give in IX. of the Appendix a\r\nletter of introduction, of which I was bearer, from one of the most\r\naccomplished _professori_ of Rome.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFew branches of human knowledge more flourished during the palmy\r\ndays of Italian literature than the exact sciences, especially\r\nin connection with military affairs, and the elegant arts. Their\r\napplication to both objects was received with marked favour by the\r\nsuccessive Dukes of Urbino, who, for a century and a half, combined\r\nthe pursuit of arms with the patronage of art. We have seen this\r\ndone by Federigo and Guidobaldo I., for the defence of their duchy\r\nand the decoration of their capital; we now have to mention the\r\nprogress of similar studies under the della Rovere princes. During\r\nthe latter epoch, pure mathematics were brought into fashion by\r\nnumerous translations of standard Greek works into Latin or Italian,\r\na labour shared by various literati of Urbino, but especially by\r\nComandino, Baldi, and Alessandro Giorgi. This, however, but served\r\nto facilitate their practical development in pursuits more congenial\r\nto those martial dispositions for which the inhabitants of Romagna\r\nhave in all ages been noted. Whilst the revived literature of Greece\r\nand the philosophy of Plato flourished on the banks of the Arno,\r\nthe exact sciences were cultivated in the highlands of Umbria, and\r\ntook the practical turn of strengthening those fastnesses with\r\nwhich nature had provided that mountain-land. Francesco di Giorgio,\r\nof Siena, was less in request by Dukes Federigo and Guidobaldo as\r\narchitect of their stately palaces, than as the most famous military\r\nengineer of his time. Events which made their duchy the seat of\r\nrepeated invasions early in the sixteenth century, as well as the\r\nwarlike character of Francesco Maria I., maintained a demand for\r\nfortifications, and, from the school which thus grew up in his\r\ncapital, there issued a series of military architects whose fame and\r\nservices extended beyond the Alps.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first of these whom we shall mention was FEDERIGO\r\nCOMANDINO, born at Urbino, in 1509, of a noble family. His\r\ngrandfather was secretary of Duke Federigo, whose last confidential\r\ninstructions he received, when death surprised that veteran general\r\nin the fens of Ferrara. Baldi has claimed the invention of those\r\nbulwarks in fortification called _baluardi_ for his father, Gian\r\nBattista,[135] who built the walls at Urbino in the beginning of\r\nthe sixteenth century. After a liberal education, Federigo passed\r\nseveral years at the court of Clement VII., nominally as a privy\r\nchamberlain, but really to amuse with learned disquisitions the\r\nPontiff's leisure hours, on whose death he repaired to Padua, where\r\nhe devoted ten years to the study of philosophy and medicine. Having\r\ngraduated, he settled for clinical practice at Ferrara, but seems\r\nsoon to have abandoned the healing art for mathematical research.\r\nHe accompanied his sovereign, Guidobaldo II., to the camp at Verona\r\nwhen in the Venetian service, and, having gained his confidence by\r\nsuccessfully treating him in a severe illness, he was selected to\r\ninstruct him in astronomy and cosmography, as well as in military\r\ntactics and engineering. Soon, however, resuming his more abstruse\r\nstudies, under the patronage of Cardinal Ranuccio Farnese, brother of\r\nDuchess Vittoria, he was carried by him to Rome, and introduced into\r\nthe society of Annibale Caro, Fulvio Orsini, Baldassare Turrio, and\r\nCardinal Cervini, the last of whom was cut off too quickly after his\r\nelection as Marcellus II. to be able to benefit his friends. But for\r\nComandino ambition offered few temptations, and courts had no charm.\r\nIn studious retirement he devoted to the exact sciences the matured\r\npowers of a comprehensive and most retentive mind. He explored all\r\nthat classical authors were known to have left on these subjects, and\r\nrendered again accessible much that lay forgotten among the rubbish\r\nof by-gone learning. He translated, and copiously edited, Ptolemy's\r\ntreatise on the planisphere, which was published at Venice, in 1558,\r\nand, four years afterwards, gave to the world a work on the analemma,\r\nfounded upon the same author's previous and imperfect discoveries.\r\nHis labours were then transferred to the writings of Archimedes,\r\nseveral of which he printed for the first time, as well as the\r\ndissertations of Serenus and Apollonius upon conic sections, all with\r\nelaborate commentaries.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: This has also been imputed to Francesco di Giorgio, to\r\nSanmichele, and to Bartolomeo Centogatti of Urbino.]\r\n\r\nAfter spending the prime of life in these pursuits at Rome, he\r\nreturned to his native duchy, where his instructions in mathematics\r\nwere sought by Prince Francesco Maria, with whom he read and\r\nexpounded Euclid's _Elements_; and afterwards, at the request of his\r\npupil, published a Latin translation of them. It was about 1569 that\r\nhe was visited there by a young Englishman named John Dea, whose\r\nlove of the exact sciences induced him to seek so distinguished a\r\nprofessor, and who supplied him with some Arabic MSS., hitherto\r\nunknown.[136] Six years thereafter he was surprised by death, with\r\nmany unfinished works on his hands, part whereof saw the light under\r\nthe superintendence of the Marquis Guidobaldo del Monte. The life of\r\na hard student is rarely one of varied incident; and even the voluble\r\npen of his pupil Baldi has failed to illustrate that of Comandino\r\nwith interest, beyond his scholiast labours.[137] Yet severity formed\r\nno part of his social character, and he was ready at all times to\r\nrelax his toils by Epicurean indulgences, which are said eventually\r\nto have curtailed his life. To the last, however, his engrossing\r\npleasure was in books; and, although his works number more\r\ntranslations than original compositions, he is ranked by Montucla\r\namong the most able and judicious of commentators.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: GROSSI, _Uomini Illustri di Urbino_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: It is printed in the Raccolta Calogeriana, XIX., 140.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the pupils whom Comandino left in his native state was\r\nGUIDOBALDO, MARQUIS DEL MONTE, who was born of distinguished\r\nlineage, in 1544. Tiraboschi has cited, as a singular proof of the\r\nengrossing nature of his studies, the fact that his life offers a\r\nnearly total want of incident. So tranquilly did his days flow on\r\nat his castle of Monte Baroccio, amid abstruse occupations, that he\r\nseemed to have forgotten a world unconscious of his very existence,\r\nand the only memorials of his life are his works. His treatise upon\r\nPerspective successfully carried forward what had been indicated\r\nby Pietro della Francesca in the preceding century, and he was\r\nafterwards engaged upon the doctrine of Planispheres, the correction\r\nof the kalendar, and the solution of astronomical problems. But\r\nthough thus devoted to abstruse science, he spared a portion of his\r\nthoughts for its practical branches, working upon mechanics, and\r\ntranslating from Archimedes. It is unnecessary here to go into an\r\nexamination of results which modern discoveries have left far behind;\r\nthe ground has been well sifted by Montucla, whose work indicates\r\nwhatever is still of value in this class of now somewhat superseded\r\nlabours. The Marquis was addressed by Torquato Tasso in a sonnet\r\nbeginning _Miserator de' gran celesti campi_, and died early in the\r\nseventeenth century, survived by a younger brother, Francesco Maria,\r\nwho had been made cardinal by Sixtus V.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the names distinguished in Urbino for mathematical talent,\r\nthat of PACIOTTI was conspicuous. Jacopo Paciotti, who held several\r\nsituations of trust under the two first Dukes of the Rovere dynasty,\r\nwas father of three sons, all eminent proficients in the exact\r\nsciences. Felice was one of those commissioned to rectify the\r\nGregorian Kalendar, and invented an instrument for constructing\r\ndial-plates. Orazio became a military engineer, and erected\r\nfortresses for the States of the Church, for Savoy, and for Lucca,\r\nwith such reputation that his services were sought for Poland and\r\nfor the Emperor Rudolph. But the most remarkable of the family\r\nwas Francesco,[*138] who, after enjoying a liberal education, and\r\nthoroughly grounding himself in architecture under Girolamo Genga,\r\nwent to Rome, where, in 1550,[*139] he was named engineer-in-chief\r\nby Julius III. Next year, he was employed to fortify Ancona against\r\nthe dreaded descents of the Turk; but, leaving this undertaking to\r\nbe completed by Fontana, he passed in 1551, to the service of the\r\nFarnesi, and thence to that of Emanuel Duke of Savoy, with 60 scudi\r\nof monthly pay. He soon afterwards published a plan of Rome; but his\r\nattention was chiefly devoted to military architecture, in which his\r\nreputation rapidly spread. In 1558, he was employed by Philip II. to\r\nsurvey, and report upon, the principal defences of the Low Countries,\r\nfor which he was remunerated with 6000 scudi, and a massive gold\r\nchain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *138: Cf. MADIAI, _Il Giornale di Francesco Paciotti da\r\nUrbino_ in _Arch. St. per le Marche e per l'Umbria_, vol. III., p. 48\r\n_et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *139: This is the year in which the journal begins. In 1551\r\nhe tells us he left the service of the Pope to enter that of the Duke\r\nof Parma.]\r\n\r\nPaciotti was now on the ladder of royal favour, and, having\r\naccompanied Duke Emanuel to Paris, for his marriage, was decorated\r\nby Henry II. with another magnificent chain worth 1000 scudi. The\r\ngorgeous compliment, however, nearly cost him his life, for, while\r\nwearing it next day, he was set upon by two robbers, one of whom he\r\nslew, and wounded the other, a feat which procured him new marks\r\nof favour. The next ten years of his life were chiefly spent in\r\nthe service of Savoy; but he was at various times summoned for\r\nengineering purposes to Spain and Flanders. The warm personal regard\r\nin which he was held by Philip II. was proved by his winning a bet,\r\nthat he would make that proud monarch hold a light to examine his\r\nplans, and was more substantially shown by many rich presents which\r\nhe carried from that court. In consequence of recommendations from\r\nhis Catholic Majesty, he had from the King of Portugal the order\r\nof Jesus Christ; and in 1578, at the Duke of Savoy's request, the\r\nCastle of Montefabri was erected into a countship in his favour, by\r\nFrancesco Maria II. of Urbino. After for several years superintending\r\nfortifications in the papal states, and those of the Grand Duke of\r\nTuscany, he retired to his native place, and passed the remainder\r\nof his life in honourable ease, enjoying from various sovereigns\r\npensions of above 3000 scudi a year. He died in 1591, aged seventy,\r\nleaving behind him a European reputation, and three sons, in whom the\r\nmathematical talents of the family were hereditarily developed, all\r\nbeing military engineers of some note; one of them, Federigo, became\r\na Knight of Malta, and Guidobaldo was blown up by a mine, while in\r\nthe service of Charles V.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGIAN GIACOMO LEONARDI is mentioned by a recent writer[140]\r\nas \"one of those extraordinary men, so abundant in Italy during\r\nthe fifteenth and following century, who have left little fame to\r\nposterity, and who, though universally known in their day, were\r\nafter death forgotten, and overlooked by subsequent writers.\" Nor\r\nis this surprising in his case; for his distinction, gained in\r\nthe camp, was spread still wider by his diplomacy. He was at one\r\nmoment referred to on delicate points of honour between knights and\r\nsovereigns; at another consulted on questions of legal intricacy;\r\nwhilst his writings have remained unedited and unknown. They are all\r\nupon fortification and engineering, and are enumerated by Promis in\r\nhis elaborate compilation upon these subjects. His services, though\r\neagerly sought by great monarchs, were affectionately devoted to his\r\nnative princes, being long companion in arms of Francesco Maria I.,\r\nand ambassador to Venice from Guidobaldo II. He was born at Pesaro,\r\nnear which he had from the latter the countship of Monte l'Abbate in\r\n1540, with permission to bear the name and arms of della Rovere, and\r\ndied about 1560.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: _Trattato di Architettura da Francesco di Giorgio_,\r\nedited by C. Promis, Turin, 1841.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough we have been led to mention engineers in connection with\r\nmathematical science, they were in these days usually architects, and\r\nregarded as belonging to the class of artists. Ricotti informs us\r\nthat no vocation was more varied or laborious. Uniting the practice\r\nof arms with an intimate knowledge of design, their services were\r\nsought for in every part of Europe, either to plan fortresses, build\r\npalaces, cast statues, paint frescoes, execute hydraulics, or command\r\ntroops. Lazzari, in his _Uomini Illustri del Piceno_, enumerates\r\nsixteen such as conferring lustre upon Urbino, but of these we shall\r\nonly name one more. MUZIO ODDI was nobly born there, in\r\n1569. In 1595, he accompanied, as military engineer, a contingent\r\nsent by the Duke into Burgundy; and, three years after, employed his\r\narchitectural skill for the festive decorations in honour of a visit\r\nby Clement VIII. to his native city. He had less success in placing a\r\ncupola upon the cathedral there, in 1604, which was said to contain\r\n100,000 pounds of iron-work and 80,000 of lead, the weight of which\r\nbrought it down in 1789. On some indistinctly recorded charge, he was\r\nthrown into the citadel of Pesaro, and there detained many years in\r\na loathsome dungeon. Denied the use of books or writing materials,\r\nhe made for himself ink of charcoal and candle-soot, mixed with\r\nwater in a walnut-shell, and, by pasting together shreds of paper\r\nwith bread-dough, contrived to jot down mathematical treatises on\r\nsundials and the square, using for compasses a couple of twigs tied\r\ntogether. On his liberation, in 1609, he passed into Lombardy, and\r\nspent above twenty years of exile in sighing for his country; nor was\r\nit till within two years of the close of life that he was appointed\r\nmathematical professor at Urbino. He died at seventy, leaving a\r\nTreatise on Mathematics, in two volumes 4to.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBERNARDINO BALDI[*141] has a double claim upon our\r\nattention, as the most prolific writer whom the duchy has produced,\r\nand as one who devoted a large share of his literary labours to the\r\nillustration of his native state. He was born at Urbino in 1553, of\r\na family which, during several generations, had held with credit\r\nvarious important situations in the magistracy. By force of that\r\nextraordinary diligence, which continued to stimulate his entire\r\nlife, his youthful studies advanced with precocious success; yet it\r\nis singular to find him confessing that his early inclinations were\r\nall towards painting, and that his preference of his pencil to his\r\ngrammatical exercises often brought him into intimate acquaintance\r\nwith the birch. We cannot echo the observation of his biographer\r\nAffò,[*142] that this discipline may have deprived Urbino of a\r\nsecond Raffaele; but though he assuredly was gifted neither with the\r\nlofty genius nor the pervading sense of beauty which characterised\r\nhis countryman, a deep devotional feeling would doubtless have\r\ninspired his paintings. The peculiar connection which existed at\r\nUrbino between the exact sciences and the liberal arts frequently\r\nattracts our notice; and this it may have been which led the thwarted\r\npainter to turn with his accustomed energy to mathematical studies,\r\nunder Federigo Comandino, for whose edition of Euclid, published\r\nin 1572, he is said to have drawn the diagrams. It was about this\r\ntime, that, urged by his parents to choose between law and medicine\r\nfor a profession, he preferred the latter, rather, as he tells\r\nus, from its analogy with philosophical inquiries than with any\r\nspecial liking for the healing art. With these views he was sent\r\nto the University of Padua, where he brought his vast application\r\nsuccessively to bear upon logic, and ethical and physical philosophy,\r\nvaried by his favourite mathematics, and by a comprehensive cycle of\r\nGreek literature. To that seat of learning there then resorted the\r\nyouth of ultramontane lands, whose harsh language so piqued Baldi's\r\ncuriosity, and developed his prodigious philological talents, that\r\nin an inconceivably short time he mastered French and German. But\r\nthese multifarious pursuits did not suffice his versatile mind,\r\nso he enlivened them by draughts of the Castalian spring. There\r\nmay seem something ludicrous in an epic, entitled \"Artillery,\" and\r\nillustrative of gunnery practice; but a theme so ponderous for\r\npoetry was suited to the spirit of the age, as well as congenial to\r\nits author's thoughts. A visit to the mountain home of Petrarch, at\r\nArqua, gave, however, a lighter turn to his muse, and taught his\r\nnumber to flow in madrigals, to the honour of some nameless Laura of\r\nhis love or fancy, containing more borrowed classicism than inspired\r\npassion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *141: Cf. ZACCAGNINI, _La vita e le opere edite e inedite\r\ndi B.B._ (Modena, 1903); UGOLINI, _Versi e prose scelte di B.B._\r\n(Firenze, 1859); see also MADIAI, _Pierantonio Paltroni e B.B.\r\nbiografi di Federigo da Montefeltro in Le Marche_ (1902), vol. II.,\r\npp. 5-6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *142: Cf. AFFÒ, _La Vita di B.B._ (Parma, 1783).]\r\n\r\nIn 1575 he returned home, to share the last labours, and watch the\r\ndeath-bed, of his friend Comandino, and to encounter from his parents\r\nmany a remonstrance as to his neglected professional acquirements, of\r\nwhich, in the various food with which he had appeased his literary\r\ncraving at the university, he seems entirely to have lost sight. But\r\ntheir efforts were vain. The Eugubinean tables, that philological\r\nenigma, having attracted his attention, he boldly encountered their\r\nsolution, and studied Arabic as a stepping-stone to the lost dialects\r\nof Central Italy. His biographers insert Etruscan in the catalogue\r\nof his polyglot acquirements, but the tables of Gubbio remain a\r\npuzzle to antiquaries. Those who made literature a profession,\r\nbefore there existed a \"public\" to remunerate their exertions,\r\nlooked for maintenance to princes or private patrons; and in 1580\r\nBaldi gratefully accepted the offer of Don Ferrante Gonzaga, Lord\r\nof Guastalla, to instruct him in mathematics, on an allowance of\r\nten scudi a month, besides board for himself and a servant,--an\r\nappointment which made him favourably known to Cardinal (afterwards\r\nSt.) Carlo Borromeo, uncle of that prince, and to many persons of\r\nliterary reputation who frequented his miniature court. There his\r\ntime was divided between mathematical and poetic compositions,\r\nuntil, in 1586, a sudden change took place in his position by his\r\nadopting a clerical habit, at the request of Don Ferrante, in order\r\nthat he might hold the Abbacy of Guastalla, the emoluments of which\r\nyielded him about 320 golden ducats. This promotion brought out a\r\ncurious feature in the character of so hard a student, and we find\r\nhim immediately repairing to Rome, to canvass for the higher honours\r\nof a titular bishopric, on being refused which, he struggled for\r\npermission to wear some trifling distinction in his canonical robes\r\nwith pertinacity befitting a worldling rather than a philosopher.\r\nNeither was it from such a character that we should have looked for\r\na zeal in the maintenance of ecclesiastical discipline, which led\r\nhim beyond the bounds of prudence in wielding his inquisitorial\r\npowers.[*143]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *143: In Rome he pursued too his artistic studies; it was\r\nthis sojourn which inspired the _Sonetti Romani_. He seems to have\r\npassed the years 1592-1609 between Rome, Urbino, and Guastalla.]\r\n\r\nThose theological studies which usually precede ordination were\r\nin his case followed out with his wonted energy, after obtaining\r\nthe preferment to which they are generally intended to lead, and\r\nit was probably then that he added Hebrew and Chaldee to his\r\naccomplishments. But his first great undertaking, after thus gaining\r\na position of leisure and independence, was a General Biography\r\nof famous mathematicians. This he never completed for the press;\r\nbut a sort of vidimus of the three hundred and sixty lives, which\r\nit was intended to contain, was printed after his death, with the\r\ntitle _Cronica de' Mathematici_. Several minor works in science and\r\nliterature at the same time occupied his pen, among which were his\r\nDescription of the Urbino palace, his Eulogy of that state, and his\r\nHistory of Guastalla. Nor were his poetic inspirations neglected,\r\nand, besides a variety of occasional effusions, his _Nautica_, or\r\nthe Art of Navigation, was printed at Venice in 1590. We may include\r\namong his lighter labours an Essay on History, dedicated in 1611\r\nto the Duke of Urbino, and lately published by Cardinal Mai.[144]\r\nAlthough, like most similar essays, some of its observations are\r\ntrite and even trivial, the various topics are well handled, and\r\nmany useful suggestions are offered as to the best method and style\r\nfor history, the qualities requisite in its author and desirable\r\nfor its students. It would have been well had Baldi attended, in\r\nhis historical biographies, to his own recommendation, that the\r\nprolix and copious diction of Livy should be chastened by that terse\r\nand sententious manner found in Tacitus and Sallust. Nor were it\r\namiss that he had construed less literally the maxim by which Pliny\r\nthe Younger pleads for mediocrity, Content yourself to do much\r\nindifferently, if it be beyond you to do a little well.[145]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: _Spicilegium Romanum_, I., xxviii., from Vat. Urb.\r\nMSS.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: Satius est plurima mediocriter facere, si non possis\r\naliquid insigniter. Lib. V., Epist. 5.]\r\n\r\nAlthough Baldi appears to have entered the Church rather from\r\ntemporal considerations than any spiritual vocation, no priest\r\nwas ever more tenacious of rights and privileges; and it was his\r\nmisfortune to find, in the exercise of his ecclesiastical functions,\r\never-recurring misunderstandings with his clergy or the civil\r\nauthorities, and even with the superior tribunals at Rome. Through\r\nthese we shall not follow him. As early as 1590, the Duke of Urbino\r\ninterfered as a friendly counsellor to recommend him moderate\r\nmeasures; but new jars from time to time recurred, and in 1609 he\r\ncarried into effect a step which he had proposed seventeen years\r\nbefore, by resigning his benefice, under reservation of two-fifths\r\nof its income. But these wranglings penetrated not within the portal\r\nof his study, where his active mind and adamantine pen laboured\r\nassiduously, through good report and bad, upon the most incongruous\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nThe Abbot renounced his preferment on the plea of family matters,\r\nrequiring his presence in his native city, and, faithful to\r\nthis domestic duty, declined an offer from Cardinal d'Este of a\r\nsituation in his household. His own sovereign received him with that\r\nfriendship he ever extended to men of piety and literary merit,\r\nand, in 1612, sent him on a mission to congratulate the New Doge of\r\nVenice.[*146] The remainder of his life passed in peace, amid the\r\nvaried resources of an ever-busy mind, interrupted only by those\r\noccasional bereavements, whereby, as years wear on, death warns us\r\nthat our turn will also come. Besides sad breaches in his domestic\r\ncircle, Baldi had to mourn his long-attached friend Baroccio, the\r\npainter, who died in 1612. Prepared by such proofs of human frailty,\r\nhe resigned his spirit on the 10th of October, after a lingering\r\nbut lenient malady, and was carried to the tomb amid the sincere\r\nregrets of many friends and admirers.[*147] It was remarked that,\r\nin his long and minute will, he left no instructions regarding his\r\nmultifarious unpublished works, most of which passed into the library\r\nof his relations, the Albani, where they remain at Rome. His epitaph\r\nreckons his compositions at forty-eight,[*148] and the languages he\r\nknew at twelve, which Crescimbeni increases to sixteen--substantial\r\ntestimony to that avidity of application which is said to have been\r\nhabitually appeased by perusing the Fathers whilst at table, and\r\nby conning over Euclid in Arabic, as an aid to digestion. To detail\r\nand criticise the results of labours as Protean as Herculean is a\r\ntask which we cannot attempt. His diligent biographer Affò enumerates\r\nabout thirty printed works, running to above two thousand 4to pages,\r\nand seventy left in manuscript, some of which have been since\r\npublished. They may be thus classed:--\r\n\r\n                                          Printed.

VII., p. 201.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *147: He died in Urbino, October 10th, 1617.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *148: I record the more important. In 1575 he wrote a\r\npoem on _Artiglieria_, and in 1579 another on the _Invenzione del\r\nbossolo da navigare_; this was published by CANEVAZZI (Livorno,\r\nGiusti, 1901). Cf. concerning it, PROVASI in _Le Marche_ (1902), and\r\nZACCAGNINI in _Rass. Crit. d. Lett. Ital._, vol. VII., p. 166. His\r\nmasterpiece, _Nautica_, written between 1580-85, is a didactic poem\r\nin four books imitating the Georgics. Concerning it see ZACCAGNINI,\r\n_Le fonti della Nautica_ in _Giornale St. d. Lett. Ital._, vol.\r\nXL., p. 366, and PROVASI, _Contributo allo studio della Nautica di\r\nB.B._ (Fano, 1903). The _Egloghe Miste_ were dedicated to Ranuccio\r\nFarnese in 1590, and consist of nineteen poems in various metres\r\nin a Theocritan vein. Cf. RUBERTO, _Le Egloghe edite e inedite di\r\nB.B._ in _Propugnatore_ (1882), and for _Epigrammi_, RUBERTO, _op.\r\ncit. An. cit._ His youthful erotic poems were published under the\r\ntitle _Lauro_ (Pavia, 1600), and, not to speak of other volumes, the\r\n_Sonetti Romani_ appeared in _Versi e Prose_ (Venice, Franceschi,\r\n1590). His works in prose were very numerous. I note here _La\r\nDescrizione del Palazzo Ducale d'Urbino_ (_circa_ 1587), and the\r\n_Vite_ of Federigo and Guidobaldo I. of Urbino, the first published\r\nin Rome in 1820 and a bad edition of the second in Milan, 1821. He\r\nwrote also a _Cronaca_ (Urbino, 1707), a life of Federigo Comandino,\r\nthe _Encomio della Patria_, cf. ZACCAGNINI, _Uno scritto inedito\r\ndi B.B._ in _Le Marche_ (Fano), vol. I., p. 4; and the _Lettere\r\nFamiliari_, cf. POLIDORI, _Lettere di Baldi_ (Firenze, 1854),\r\nRONCHINI, _Lettere di B._ (Parma, 1873) and SAVIOTTI, _Lettere di B._\r\n(Pesaro, 1887).]\r\n\r\nOf these a number were translations, chiefly from Arabic and other\r\nOriental tongues. It is evident that his own preference lay towards\r\nhis compositions in verse, a judgment which wants confirmation if\r\ncontinued popularity be the test. Yet several of his fugitive poems,\r\nand especially some sonnets on the ruins of Rome, possess much lyric\r\nbeauty; and, though his epic on the Deluge is but a wretched attempt\r\nat novelty in versification, that on the Art of Navigation is a\r\nwork of merit for the age which produced it. Hallam, after classing\r\nit with Bernardo Tasso's _Amadigi_, as two of the most remarkable\r\nproductions of that sort then written in Italy, pronounces the\r\n_Nautica_ \"a didactic poem in blank verse, too minute sometimes, and\r\nprosaic in detail, like most of its class, but neither low, turgid,\r\nor obscure, as many others have been. The descriptions, though never\r\nvery animated, are sometimes poetical and pleasing. Baldi is diffuse,\r\nand this conspires with the triteness of his matter to render the\r\npoem somewhat uninteresting. He by no means wants power to adorn his\r\nsubject, but does not always trouble himself to exert it, and is tame\r\nwhere he might be spirited. Few poems bear more evident marks that\r\ntheir substance had been previously written down in prose.\" But what\r\nhe wanted in genius--for therein lay his great deficiency--he in\r\nsome degree supplied by wonderful versatility. Whichever of his many\r\nsubjects he took up seemed that in which he was born to excel. Of his\r\npainstaking diligence we have said much, but we may add the pertinent\r\nremark of Grossi, \"that so extensive was his reading as apparently\r\nto leave no time for writing, and yet that he wrote about as much\r\nas it seemed possible for any one to read.\" To this Tiraboschi adds\r\nthe more flattering testimony that \"his praises would be appropriate\r\nto almost each chapter of this history, for there was scarcely any\r\ndepartment of literature and science in which he did not apply\r\nhimself and attain excellence.\"\r\n\r\nBy an author so prolific, redundancy and diffuseness, the\r\nblemishes of his age, were inevitable. But in his lives of the two\r\nMontefeltrian dukes, these are conjoined with a tendency to elaborate\r\nhis details into microscopic minuteness, which weary and distract\r\nthe reader, and which, though valuable adjuncts to the testimony of\r\nan eye-witness, engender more suspicion than credit in a narrative\r\ncompiled, after a long interval, from less specific authorities.\r\nBeing, however, a shrewd observer and diligent narrator, anxious\r\nto do full justice to his subject, these works, although deficient\r\nin personal interest, and relieved by no enlarged views or general\r\napplication, fulfil the task prescribed by his patron, the last\r\nDuke della Rovere; and, were his life of Francesco Maria I. to be\r\npublished,[149] Baldi would be our standard historiographer of the\r\nduchy. In him are, indeed, wanting the qualities of a philosophic\r\nhistorian,--elevation of sentiment, variety of matter, selection\r\nof incident; but they belonged not to his age, and were scarcely\r\ncompatible with his position. The fate of Scarpi and Varchi gave\r\ntimely warning to the literary world, that historic verity might have\r\nits martyrs, as well as metaphysical speculation of religious truth.\r\nHis life of Duke Federigo, written in 1603, was printed in 1824;\r\nthat of Guidobaldo I., completed in 1615, saw the light in 1821.\r\nThe substance of these narratives had, however, been appropriated\r\nand published by Reposati, omitting imaginary conversations and\r\nsupposititious harangues. Of the degree of impartiality with which\r\nthey were compiled, an idea may be formed from the following extracts\r\nof letters addressed to their author by his sovereign, proving that\r\nhis judgment was not by any means left unfettered:--\"It has given me\r\nsatisfaction to hear all that you have written me in regard to the\r\nlife of Duke Federigo of happy memory, and I fail not to acknowledge\r\nwith pleasure your devotion and diligence. In mentioning my house,\r\nI approve of your naming it of Montefeltro rather than Feltrian,\r\nbut as to seeking out its source and foundation, I do not recollect\r\ntelling you to pass these over in silence. On the contrary, I deem\r\nit necessary to discuss this, yet not in the way I saw it treated at\r\nUrbino, attributing to it a mere bourgeois and private origin, much\r\nhumbler than its deserts. It will, therefore, be well to keep this in\r\nview, observing in your eulogies, and generally throughout the work,\r\na becoming consideration and regard for it, such as, without further\r\nhint, I look for from your sound discretion.\"--\"As to the Life of\r\nDuke Federigo, only a few days have passed since I have done looking\r\nthrough it; but we must talk it over together more than once, ere\r\nanything can be decided on.\"[150]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: Vat. Urb. MSS., No. 906.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 150: Oliveriana MSS. In 1602 the Duke instructed his\r\nresident at Venice to procure for Gian Battista Leoni access to its\r\narchives for the life of Francesco Maria I. he had commissioned him\r\nto write, which was published three years later.]\r\n\r\nHad Baldi lived among our fathers, he would have dwelt in Grub\r\nStreet, and become, by his powers of application and memory, a\r\nsuccessful book-maker; among ourselves, he would have proved valuable\r\nas a penny-per-line scribe. In Italy, his renown was, for a time,\r\nmore brilliant, but it has now passed into comparative, and not\r\nunmerited, neglect. Yet his is a name of which his native city may\r\njustly be proud, and may cherish with respectful approbation this\r\nepitaph, once proposed for his tomb:--\r\n\r\n     \"Ah! happy he who spent a lengthened span,\r\n     Not in the vulgar dreams of grovelling man,\r\n     But passed his days in living truly well;\r\n     Urbino's honour! Passenger, farewell.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the literary labourers of this age GIROLAMO\r\nMUZIO[*151] is entitled to a prominent place, more from the\r\nvariety and volume of his writings than from their actual worth. The\r\nepithet Giustinopolite, usually applied to him, is latinised from\r\nCapo d'Istria, the adopted home of his family, who were originally\r\nemigrants from Udine, and spelt their name Nuzio. He, however, was\r\nborn at Padua, in 1496, and, after receiving a good education,\r\nfinding himself dependent upon his own exertions, was fain to sell\r\nhis services of sword or pen to the highest bidder. The same rule\r\nof self-interest that actuated Italian condottieri was too often\r\nfollowed by literary adventurers in that country, conscience and\r\nglory being generally made subservient by both to a livelihood.\r\nGirolamo had a double chance, in his twofold capacity of soldier and\r\nauthor, and tells us \"that it was ever his fate to earn his bread\r\nby serving in the armies and courts of popes, emperors, kings, or\r\npetty princes; sometimes with one Italian commander, sometimes with\r\nanother; now in France, then in Upper, again in Lower Germany.\"\r\nThrough these vicissitudes it were needless to follow him. For a\r\ntime he was rival or successor of Bernardo Tasso in the promiscuous\r\naffections of Tullia d'Aragona, a lettered courtezan, and, without\r\nher sanction, published, in 1547, her Dialogue on the Infinitude of\r\nLove. In the preface he avowed a connection which occasioned him\r\nneither compunction nor shame, and which, in days when love was a\r\nscience as well as a passion, was openly shared by Varchi, Speroni,\r\nStrozzi, and Molza. Four years later a dangerous illness taught him\r\nreflection on his past ways, and brought him to a devotional frame\r\nof mind. It was about the same time that he became an inmate of the\r\ncourt of Urbino, receiving from Duke Guidobaldo the ample pension of\r\n400 scudi, with permission to \"attend to his studies, appearing only\r\nwhen he chose.\" The Duchess Vittoria countenanced him much, and he\r\nspent a good deal of time in her society, probably in consequence of\r\nhis appointment as governor to her eldest son, and of his marrying a\r\nlady of her suite. From thence he went to reside at Rome, about 1567,\r\nand died in Tuscany, in 1576.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *151: On Muzio, see GIAXICH, _Vita di Girolamo Muzio_\r\n(Trieste, 1847); MORPURGO, _Girolamo Muzio_ (Trieste, 1893), NOMI,\r\nin _Miscellanea Stor. della Valdelsa_, No. 24; NOTTOLA, _Appunti sul\r\nMuzio poeta_ (Aosta, 1895).]\r\n\r\nTiraboschi declines the task of compiling the long catalogue of\r\nhis various writings, in poetry, sacred and profane history, moral\r\nessays, and familiar letters,[*152] nor need we undertake it. A large\r\nportion of his works were directed against protestant doctrines, and,\r\nhaving reformed the habits of his somewhat stormy youth, he lent\r\nwilling and efficient aid in strangling the progress of Calvinism in\r\nItaly, after a protracted struggle, upon which the investigations of\r\nDr. M'Crie have thrown much valuable light. Muzio is alleged to have\r\nexhibited in this contest more of martial dexterity than theological\r\nacumen; but his controversial effusions, being published in Italian,\r\nand clothed in a homely slashing style, were probably supposed quite\r\nas efficacious against the progress of heretical opinions among his\r\ncountrymen, as the disquisitions of more profound theologians. It was\r\nnot, however, for the dogmas of faith alone that Muzio wielded his\r\npen. The soldier of fortune was quite as happy, and more at home, on\r\ntopics belonging to the chivalry of his profession. His treatises\r\non Duels and the Point of Honour were suited to the spirit of the\r\nage, and had in consequence a considerable run of popularity, now of\r\ncourse long ago past. The like fate has befallen his didactic poem\r\non the Art of Poetry, in the literature of his own country. What\r\nmost concerns us are his Lives of Dukes of Urbino. That of Federigo\r\nis dedicated to Guidobaldo II., and the original is deposited in the\r\nVatican Library. Having been compiled with considerable care, it\r\ncontinues our best narrative of his reign, and has been greatly drawn\r\nupon by Baldi and Riposati. The edition printed at Venice in 1605 is\r\nbut an abridgment, containing less than half the original matter. His\r\nLife of Francesco Maria I. was left unfinished, and remains unedited\r\nin the Vatican.[153]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *152: The fullest collection of his letters seems to\r\nbe that of GIOLITI, 1551. Cf. also ZENATTI, _Lettere inedite_\r\n(Capodistria, 1896).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 153: Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 1011, and No. 1023, f. 50.]\r\n\r\nWe shall mention but one more prose writer of Urbino. FEDERIGO\r\nBONAVENTURA was born in 1555, and owed to Cardinal Giulio\r\ndella Rovere a fashionable education at Rome. On his return home,\r\nthe marked favour of Francesco Maria II. was attracted by his good\r\nsense and winning manners; but finding his courtly accomplishments\r\nunequal to the profound pursuits of that young prince, he laboured\r\nassiduously to supply his own deficiencies. By close application, his\r\nprogress in Greek, mathematics, and natural philosophy was amazingly\r\nrapid; but these studies were happily blended with the business of\r\nlife, and, directing his powerful judgment to political affairs, he\r\nestablished his reputation by a work on public polity, which, for the\r\nfirst time in Italy, methodised the principles of government. These\r\ntalents his sovereign turned to account by sending him on various\r\ndiplomatic missions. Conforming in many respects to the maxims\r\ninculcated by the Cortegiano, he filled in the Duke's court somewhat\r\nthe same place which Castiglione had done in that of Guidobaldo I.,\r\nand died in 1602.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L\r\n\r\n     Italian versification--Ariosto--Pietro Aretino--Vittoria\r\n     Colonna--Laura Battiferri--Dionigi Atanagi--Antonio\r\n     Galli--Marco Montano--Bernardo Tasso.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe liquid vocables of the Italian language flow in melody with a\r\nfacility perilous to genius, fatal to mediocrity: its stream is\r\nequally apt to dilute Castalian inspiration, or to quench poetic\r\nfire. Hence the poets of Italy are far outnumbered by its versifiers;\r\nand hence among the laureates of Urbino we find but few historic\r\nnames. But, in absence of native bards, the dukes of the second\r\ndynasty attracted to their court several of those most conspicuous\r\non the Ausonian Parnassus, under whose influence a great change\r\ncame over the manner and spirit of national poetry. Hitherto their\r\npredecessors had before them two models, whose excellence is still\r\nuniversally admitted. Dante, in founding an epic literature, chose\r\nthe grandest and most difficult theme ever dared by man, and his\r\nsuccess, by immeasurably distancing his few competitors, has deterred\r\ncompetition. Petrarch addressed himself to passions and sympathies\r\nessentially earthly, and constructed a lyrical versification\r\ndemanding no sustained exertion; whose trammels sufficed, in his\r\nmelodious and pliant idiom, to stimulate ingenuity without imposing\r\nlabour; whose perfection depended rather upon elaborate polish than\r\nupon originality or vigour. Thus, while Dante continued a model,\r\nPetrarch became a snare; and hence, a \"multitude of imitators,\r\nsatisfied with copying the latter in his defects; who could easily\r\nfollow him in the choice of his subject, but not in the beauty of\r\nhis style, the variety of his knowledge, and the elegance of his\r\nimagery.\" Sonnets are indeed the most peculiarly Italian form of\r\npoetry, but they are avowedly ill-suited to the naïve expression of\r\npure and artless feelings. Their laboured strain and studied melody\r\nare adapted to an artificial cast of sentiment; they encourage\r\nexaggeration and tend to mannerism and commonplace. Singly they\r\nare charming, but \"when taken collectively we become indifferent\r\nto their unity, felicity, and grace, and accuse them of what under\r\nother circumstances we might possibly commend, their recurring\r\nmetaphors, their uniform structure, and the unfailing sweetness of\r\ntheir versification.\"[154] Yet in their complex form, a prolonged\r\nrepetition of the same rhyme tends, like the return to a simple air\r\namid difficult variations, touchingly to renew the feeling originally\r\nand pleasingly evoked; and thus is it that sonnets often possess\r\na charm of which, in their ambitious attempts, their authors were\r\nprobably quite unconscious.[155]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 154: British and Foreign Quarterly Review, xi. 376.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 155: See above, Vol. II., cap. xxv.]\r\n\r\nIt is not now our object to analyze the varied metrical arrangements\r\nto which the fertile language of Italy willingly lent itself, and\r\nwhich its minstrels,\r\n\r\n     \"A mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease,\"\r\n\r\ndelighted to mingle and multiply. Enough, in addition to the polished\r\nsonnet, to name noble canzoni, sublime odes, and tender elegies. But\r\nthe absence of ballad poetry, with its wide-circling echoes of long\r\nantecedent events and feelings, is remarkable, and has been imputed\r\nto an early addiction of the nation to prosaic habits of trade. This\r\nsolution is, however, little satisfactory in itself, and is equally\r\nat variance with the genius and the language of the people. Perhaps\r\nit would be more just to assign a diametrically opposite cause, and\r\nto seek in their vivid imaginations, and in the exuberant facility\r\nof their melodious tongue, that universality of versification which\r\ntended to depreciate its quality, or, at all events, to diminish\r\nthe estimation bestowed even on their most popular compositions.\r\nIt is accordingly in nations among whom poetry is a rare gift, and\r\nwhose idiom can embody it in terse and simple diction, that we find\r\nthose lyrics which, possessing a traditional popularity, are at once\r\nthe germ and index of national sentiment.[*156] We seek in vain\r\nfor such among the recognised literature of Italy; and though the\r\ndulcet chants of the Venetian gondolier, and the monotonous lazzaroni\r\nditties of Naples, may be deemed of that class, their infinite and\r\never-changing variety appears to divest them of the historic charm\r\nthat attaches to the chivalric redondillas of Spain, and to the\r\npensive minstrelsy of our fatherland.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *156: How could Italy have a ballad poetry full of national\r\nsentiment before she became a nation? Her living poetry then and\r\nfor centuries before, as now, is the _Rispetto_. Cf., for the\r\n_Poesie Popolari_ generally, D'ANCONA, _La Poesia Popolare Italiana_\r\n(Livorno, 1906); for the Marche especially GIANANDREA, _Canti\r\nPopolari Marchigiani_ (Torino, Loescher, 1875).]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn poetry alone did the age of the della Rovere excel that of the\r\nMontefeltri, and among the great names whom it was their pride to\r\nshelter were Ariosto and Tasso, the only ones worthy to rival those\r\nof the bards of Hell and of Love.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUPPOSED PORTRAIT OF ARIOSTO\r\n\r\n_After the picture by Titian in the National Gallery_]\r\n\r\nLUDOVICO ARIOSTO[*157] was born of noble parentage at\r\nReggio, in 1474, and, after a precocious struggle against the\r\nuncongenial legal career for which he was intended, was left by his\r\nfather to follow the bent of his genius in favour of general\r\nliterature.[*158] From an early age he had composed dramas on Thisbe\r\nand similar themes, and had secretly drilled his brothers and sisters\r\nto perform them; but when about seventeen, his youthful inclination\r\nwas gratified by accompanying Duke Ercole I. to Pavia and Milan,\r\nfor diversion, and to enact certain comedies. These boyish efforts\r\nhave not been preserved, but the Cassaria and Suppositi, composed in\r\n1494, engraft upon classic models the licentious speech of his age.\r\nThough well-born, he had the double misfortune to require a patron,\r\nand to find an ungrateful one in Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, whose\r\nferocious character and lax morals exceeded even the ordinary licence\r\nthen permitted to members of the Sacred College, and whose taste\r\nfor literature, or perhaps emulation of a prevailing fashion, led\r\nhim to favour men of genius. The services of Ariosto were invoked,\r\nas a soldier and diplomatist, when Ferrara was exposed to imminent\r\ndanger in the wars following the League of Cambray. As ambassador to\r\nJulius II. in 1512, he braved perils greater perhaps than those of\r\nthe field; but his fine temper and knowledge of the world ensured\r\nhis safety, and bespoke the regard even of that domineering Pontiff,\r\nwhose threats mellowed into favours before his conciliatory bearing.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *157: I shall not attempt to give a bibliography, however\r\nscanty, of Ariosto. He has really nothing to do with Urbino, and\r\nthe work done concerning him would fill a library. The best life\r\nafter those of Baretti, Campori, and Baruffaldi is that of Cappelli\r\nprefacing the _Lettere_ (Hoepli, Milano, 1887). The best edition\r\nof his poems is that of PAPINI (Firenze, Sansoni, 1903). For\r\n_Bibliographia Ariostesca_, see FERRAZZI (Bassano, Pozzato, 1881).\r\nFor the controversy, Ariosto-Tasso, see VIVALDI, _La Più Grande\r\npolemica del Cinquecento_ (Catanzaro, Caliò, 1895). Consult also\r\nEDMUND GARDNER, _Dukes and Poets at Ferrara_ (Constable, 1904), a\r\ncharming and a learned book.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *158: Ariosto has told us in great part his own life in his\r\n_Satire_; best edition that of Tambara (Livorno, 1903).]\r\n\r\nThe time at which he first visited Urbino is uncertain; but in\r\n1515, when the designs of Leo X. upon that duchy and Ferrara, the\r\nonly Romagnese principalities which still withstood the grasping\r\npolicy of the papacy, had given rise to anxieties in the families of\r\nd'Este and della Rovere, the Cardinal repaired to Francesco Maria\r\nI., in order to concert measures for their common safety. Ariosto\r\naccompanied him on this journey, and, having been detained at the\r\nFurlo pass by an attack of fever, which in his eighth Capitulo he\r\nmentions as dangerous, he repaired to recruit his health at Urbino,\r\nwhilst Ippolito proceeded to Rome. The greeting which met our poet\r\nat that lettered court partook of the discriminating hospitality\r\nwhich genius could ever there command; and though his own poetical\r\nreputation was as yet but dawning, his intimacy with Guido Posthumo\r\nof Pesaro was probably a claim in his behalf to special distinction,\r\nwhich the publication of his _Orlando Furioso_, before the end of\r\nthat year, firmly established. On proceeding to Rome, the favour\r\nbestowed upon him at the Vatican was not such as either to satisfy\r\nhis just anticipations, or to do credit to the Pontiff's discernment.\r\nIn his third and seventh Satires, Ariosto comments upon the long and\r\nintimate friendship of their former years, when the Cardinal de'\r\nMedici had proffered him a fraternal partiality, and vows that never\r\nagain will he rely on other men's promises, postponed from ides to\r\ncalends, and from calends to ides. The reception he at first met with\r\nmight well give confidence to his hopes; for on his presentation Leo\r\nstooped forward to press his hand, saluting him on both cheeks. But,\r\nas the Venetian envoy caustically observed, his Holiness promised\r\nlargely, but performed not. All that followed this flattering\r\naccolade was a privilege of copyright, not even gratuitously issued;\r\nand as those substantial benefits, which his merits deserved and\r\nhis position required, were vainly expected, the poet quitted Rome\r\n\"with humbled crest,\" a disappointed man. Yet he was of too kind a\r\nnature to harbour malice, as well as of a temper too easy for courtly\r\nstruggles. He returned to the quiet of his native state, content to\r\nseek some respectable employment, and avowing his indifference to\r\nscenes of wider or more varied ambition.\r\n\r\n     \"Let him who golden spur or scarlet hat affects\r\n     Serve king, or duke, or cardinal, or pope;\r\n     This suits not me, who care for neither gaud.\"[159]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 159: Part of this third Satire will be found translated in\r\nROSCOE'S _Leo X._, ch. xvi., where the demands of nepotism\r\nupon his Holiness are playfully exposed.]\r\n\r\nWhether his patron's proverbially slighting reception of a dedication\r\nof the first fruits of his epic muse proceeded from obtuseness,\r\nor, as Tiraboschi suggests, was a poor jest, it could not but be\r\nmortifying to a man of delicacy and conscious genius. Ere long a\r\nbreach occurred between them, on Ludovico declining to attend the\r\nCardinal in a distant and fatiguing embassy to Hungary.[*160] This\r\noccurred in 1517; but he was soon after admitted into the Duke\r\nof Ferrara's service with a monthly salary of seven crowns, and\r\nallowances for three servants and two horses. His first employment\r\nin this new sphere was a mission, in 1519, to condole with Lorenzo\r\nde' Medici, the usurping Duke of Urbino, on the loss of his consort\r\nMadeleine of France; but ere he reached Florence, Lorenzo's own\r\ndeath had supervened. It was on this occasion he composed his first\r\nCapitulo, where, and in his Stanze, he speaks of that prince in the\r\nusual fulsome style of courtly bards, alluding to his uncles Leo and\r\nGiuliano as\r\n\r\n     \"Twin suckers from that long descended laurel stem,\r\n     Which in its verdure decked a golden age.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote *160: Cf. Satire II., vv. 1-24, 85-93, 97-114, 217-231,\r\n238-265, and III., 1-81.]\r\n\r\nHow little the duty thus imposed upon him consisted with his own\r\ntastes may, however, be gathered from an incident characteristic\r\nof the age. The venal conduct of Duke Francesco Maria's Spanish\r\nfollowers having brought to a sudden close his attempt to regain\r\nhis patrimonial states, in the manner detailed in our thirty-sixth\r\nchapter, one of their number resented an imputation to that effect,\r\ncast upon his comrades by some gentlemen of Ferrara. A challenge was\r\nthe result, each party selecting a bravo to maintain their cause.\r\nThis duel by deputy took place on the Neapolitan territory, and, of\r\nthe combatants, who fought naked with swords, the Spaniard was left\r\ndead on the field. The victor returned to be fêted in the capital\r\nof the d'Este; and Ariosto composed his thirty-fifth sonnet upon\r\n\"Ferrara's true paladin, of truth, genius, worth, and valour, who\r\nhas cleared up the Spaniard's slippery trick upon the good Duke of\r\nUrbino, and testified to Italian bravery.\" We may well suppose the\r\nsatisfaction with which the minstrel saw this \"good Duke\" restored\r\nto his station in 1521, and may conjecture that he paid him homage\r\nin his mountain capital. A room in the ducal palace there, decorated\r\nwith his portrait, went by his name, and he was enrolled among the\r\n_Assorditi_ academicians.[161] In 1532, a few months previous to\r\nhis death, Prince Guidobaldo wrote to ask of him an unacted comedy,\r\nfor representation at Pesaro, to which he replied, regretting his\r\ninability to comply with the request, as he had long ceased to write\r\nsuch things.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: See above, pp. 255-6.]\r\n\r\nAriosto's life presents few remarkable incidents, considering the\r\nspace which his name justly occupies in the literary annals of Italy.\r\nThough honoured and complimented by the Dukes of Urbino and Ferrara,\r\nand by Leo X., he seems to have incurred few solid obligations from\r\nthese Maecenases of his age. The only promotion awarded to him was\r\nthe administration of Garfagna, a mountain-holding under the d'Este\r\nfamily, chiefly peopled by banditti, which he obtained in 1522, but\r\nresigned after three years' sad experience of the turbulent charge.\r\nHis coronation by Charles V. is apocryphal, although he is understood\r\nto have received from that Emperor a diploma as his poet laureate. He\r\ndied on the 6th of June, 1533, in his home at Ferrara, and was buried\r\nin the old church of S. Benedetto. In 1573 his body was transported\r\nto the new church, and in 1801 to the Public Library of Ferrara.\r\n\r\nIt would be foreign to the object proposed in these pages to\r\nenter fully into the merits of works so universally known, and so\r\nlittle connected with our immediate subject, as the heroic poems\r\nof Ariosto. But we have ample evidence of the popularity enjoyed\r\nby his _Orlando Furioso_, during the first half-century after its\r\npublication, in the testimony of one not likely to be partial to a\r\nsuccessful rival: \"And if the aim which a good poet ought to keep\r\nin view be that of imparting pleasure and enjoyment, it is obvious\r\nthat this was accomplished by Ariosto; for there is neither artisan,\r\nnor man of learning, nor boy, nor girl, nor old person, who is\r\nsatisfied with a second perusal of him. Are not his stanzas a solace\r\nto the jaded pilgrim, who sings them to alleviate the irksomeness\r\nof his hot and weary way? Do you not hear them chanted all day long\r\nin the highways and the fields? I believe that there have not been\r\nprinted as many copies of Homer or Virgil as of the _Furioso_, during\r\nthe time that has elapsed since that most accomplished gentleman\r\npublished his poem; and if so, as cannot be doubted, is not this a\r\nclear proof of its beauty and excellence?\"[162] We set aside the\r\nminor faults which have been found in the execution, and most gladly\r\nescape from all critical discussion of the vexed question, as to\r\nits due observance of unity and sustained action. The absence of\r\nperfections so questionable is by many accounted a charm. Nowhere\r\nhas imagination been more freely indulged, nowhere the poetic vein\r\nleft to play such fantastic tricks; but in its sallies, effort and\r\nrestraint are alike unknown. As the figures in a magic-lantern, or\r\nthe endless changes of the kaleidoscope, its phantasmagoria appear\r\nand pass by, without our being aware of the machinery which called\r\nthem up; yet, from time to time, there occur images of life so\r\nveracious, traits of nature so touching, that we are again summoned\r\nto the realities of existence and the sympathies of humanity, with a\r\nstartling effect scarcely less marvellous than the wild creations\r\nwhich precede and follow these charming episodes. Even extravagance\r\nthus ceases to be a blemish, whilst facility and freshness are\r\never multiplying new beauties. Episodes and incidents, serious or\r\ngrotesque, capriciously introduced into the poem, give it a motley\r\nand heterogeneous aspect; variety of matter and diversity of style\r\nare its familiar characteristics; and its unequal execution is,\r\nperhaps, less pardonable than the desultory character of its plan.\r\nNor is it only by its novelty that this freedom of action sustains\r\nthe interest of the work. The introduction of real personages and\r\nrecent events relieves the tedium of long continued allegory,\r\nand stamps nature and individuality on adventures in themselves\r\nextravagant and apocryphal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 162: Bernardo Tasso, Lettere, II., No. 165. In a privilege\r\nof copyright granted in very complimentary terms by Leo X., the\r\n_Orlando_ is pedantically described by Bembo as \"a work in vernacular\r\nverse regarding the feats of those called knights-errant, composed in\r\na ludicrous style, but with long study, and the laborious application\r\nof many years.\"--Bembo, _Epistolæ nomine Leonis X._, Lib. X., No. 40.]\r\n\r\nIn estimating the rank of this poet, critical judgment has too often\r\nbeen diverted from the quality of his verses to the fittingness of\r\nhis style; and in comparing him with Tasso, the argument resolves\r\nitself into a contrast between romantic and classic poetry. Upon such\r\na discussion we purpose not to enter. Ariosto found his countrymen\r\nunder the charm of old legendary histories, perpetuated by tradition\r\nfrom the days of Charlemagne and his paladins, and more recently\r\npopularised in Pulci's burlesque epic of the _Morgante Maggiore_,\r\nand by Boiardo's unfettered fancy in the _Orlando Innamorato_. He\r\nwas content to sail with the stream, spreading his canvas to the\r\nprevailing breeze, rather than to strike out another course, and\r\nsteer in search of newer attractions. This decision necessarily\r\nlimited the scope of a highly original genius to varying the details\r\nand episodes of inventions already familiarised to his readers by\r\nother less inspired pens; and it were difficult to account for his\r\nthus contentedly following their track, except from the conviction\r\nthat none else was so certain a guide to success. Domenichi and\r\nBerni, aware that Boiardo had unworthily handled his theme, were\r\ncontent to employ themselves in recasting it into more attractive\r\nshape, and Le Sage's French translation is a mere paraphrase. But\r\nAriosto chose the higher aim of taking up the story where Boiardo had\r\nleft it incomplete, and working it out in forms less exaggerated and\r\nfanciful, but far more nobly conceived, and executed with infinitely\r\ngreater polish and poetic beauty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPIETRO ARETINO[*163] has been designated by Ariosto[164]\r\n\"the scourge of princes,\" a description somewhat more just than\r\nthe epithet of \"divine,\" which is added possibly in irony; for few\r\nmen, it is hoped, have been so destitute of those high aspirations\r\nwhich form the link between human and divine nature. He has been\r\naptly compared to an ill-conditioned cur, ever ready to yelp and\r\nsnap at all who do not feed or fondle him, but to such as do, the\r\nmost fawning of his species. He was born at Arezzo in 1492, and was\r\nnatural son of one Luigi Bacci. After serving his apprenticeship\r\nto a bookbinder at Perugia, he went to push his fortunes in Rome,\r\nwhere his first remarkable productions were verses illustrating a\r\nset of engravings by Marcantonio, after designs by Giulio Romano,--a\r\nwork so scandalously offensive to decency that scarcely any copies\r\nhave escaped destruction.[*165] After the death of Giovanni de'\r\nMedici _delle bande nere_, his earliest patron, he went to Venice,\r\nand subsequently visited most of the Italian courts. His foul\r\nscurrilities and loathsome adulation were dealt out with equal\r\nreadiness, as best served his insatiable avarice and undisguised\r\nselfishness. These base qualities, tempered by tact and great\r\nreadiness, gained for him a success equally unaccountable and\r\nundeserved; he became rich, caressed, applauded, dreaded, and is\r\nsaid to have earned not less than 70,000 scudi during his career.\r\nThe popularity which his writings enjoyed among all ranks seems an\r\ninfatuation,[*166] considering their very moderate merit, and must\r\nbe viewed as symptomatic of a generally depraved taste, though no\r\ndoubt his own ineffable conceit and insolence contributed to the\r\ndelusion. \"There truly never was a man who combined such haughty\r\npresumption with equal ignorance of literature, meanness of spirit,\r\nand debauchery of morals. His style possesses no elegance or grace;\r\nindeed he seems to me one of the first to introduce those ludicrous\r\nhyperboles and extravagant metaphors that came so generally into use\r\nduring the next century. Never assuredly have I met with books so\r\nempty and useless as those of this impostor, whose baseness equalled\r\nhis profound ignorance, and the sole object of whose writings was\r\nself-interest and lucre. As to his manners, they are amply testified\r\nby his works, wherein, besides a prodigal sprinkling of obscenity,\r\nthere are mentioned the women with whom he intrigued, and the\r\nchildren these bore him; they in fact prove him destitute of moral or\r\nreligious principle; and if ever he makes a show of compunction or\r\namendment, it is but to relapse speedily into his wonted profanity.\r\nTruly such a fellow, who ought hardly to have ventured to show\r\nhimself in public, stands unequalled in presumptuous arrogance.\r\nBut the most surprising thing is to see a majority of European\r\nprinces, and not a few learned Italians, humbling themselves before\r\nhim without a blush, and rendering him a degrading tribute of gifts\r\nand eulogies. Chains of gold, considerable sums of money, pensions,\r\nand handsome presents of every sort, came in so constantly from\r\nvarious quarters, that he confesses to receiving from different\r\nprinces 25,000 scudi within eighteen years. The most amusing part\r\nof it is that these rich donations were made because he assumed the\r\nproud epithet of _scourge of princes_, on the plan, as it would\r\nseem, of threatening them with his indignation, and with attacks\r\nupon their actions in his writings; yet never was there a more\r\nsordid adulator of the great, and no work of his contains a single\r\nword against any sovereign.\" It would be difficult to select words\r\nmore graphic or more just than this description by Tiraboschi, which\r\nwe have preferred adopting, to the task of reviewing so filthy a\r\ncharacter.[*167] We shall elsewhere allude to him in connection with\r\nMichael Angelo and Titian, and other notices might be selected of\r\nhis intercourse with Duke Guidobaldo II. The self-assumed privilege\r\nof his position did not however always protect him from the merited\r\nconsequences of his meanness and malevolence. Boccalini (an author\r\nscarcely less mordent than himself, who is said to have expiated\r\nhis satiric vein by being beaten to death) calls him \"a magnet\r\nof fisty-cuffs and cudgels, whose enemies' hands, rivalling the\r\npromptitude of his own pen, had scarred him all over with as many\r\nlines as a navigator's chart.\" Among those who met him with his\r\nown weapons was Antonio Francesco Doni, a literary adventurer of\r\nFlorence, whose arrival about 1552 at the court of Guidobaldo II.\r\ninspired Aretino with jealousy which exploded in an impertinent\r\nletter. The intruder, however, maintained his ground till 1558, the\r\nyear after his opponent's characteristic death, and retaliated in a\r\nvolume published in 1556, entitled _Doni's Earthquake, overthrowing\r\nthe great beastly colossal Antichrist of our Age; a Work composed\r\nin Honour of God and the Holy Church, and in Defence of good\r\nChristians_, and dedicated \"to the infamous and rascally source and\r\nfountain of all malice, Pietro Aretino, the putrid limb of public\r\nimposture, and true Antichrist of our time.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote *163: A good edition of the _Lettere_ of ARETINO\r\nwas published under the care of Vanzolini and Bacci della Lega,\r\nin four volumes, in Bologna, 1873-75. The best edition, now very\r\nrare, of _I Ragionamenti_ is that of Florence, 1892. See also\r\nFABI, _Opere da P.A._, Milano, 1881. For his life, consult\r\nLUZIO, _P.A. nei primi suoi anni a Venezia e la corte dei\r\nGonzago_ (Torino, 1888); GAUTHIEZ, _L'Aretin_, 1492-1556\r\n(Paris, 1895); and SINIGAGLIA, _Saggio di uno studio su P.A.\r\ncon scritti e documenti inediti_ (Roma, 1892). It was, I think, Mr.\r\nClaude Phillips who wittily called Aretino not the scourge but \"the\r\nscrew of princes.\" Nevertheless, those who knew Aretino best will\r\nappreciate him most. Titian was wise enough to have him for a friend,\r\nand, indeed, he was capable of many very human and even beautiful\r\nactions, as when he would daily throw wide his doors at nightfall and\r\ntake the lost and the beggars into his house. After all, those he\r\nblackmailed were blackmailers themselves. He made even the Pope fear\r\nhim.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 164: _Orlando Furioso_, XLVI., st. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *165: These designs have lately been found and photographed\r\nand published in Paris. They are impossible, but extremely vigorous\r\nand lovely. The verses are even more terrible than the drawings, but\r\nsplendid too, with a sort of fullness of joy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *166: His writings have much of the undoubted fascination\r\nof the daily paper, but are on the whole less vulgar and probably\r\nless harmful and enervating.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *167: This is sheer hypocrisy. Aretino's intercourse with\r\nUrbino was so slight as to be easily ignored, and Dennistoun, as a\r\nfact, says next to nothing of it.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nPIETRO ARETINO\r\n\r\n_After the picture by Titian in the Pitti Gallery, Florence_]\r\n\r\nStill more pungent was the epigrammatic epitaph proposed for him by\r\nFrancesconi:\r\n\r\n     \"Arezzo's hoary libeller here is laid,\r\n     Whose bitter slanders all save CHRIST essayed:\r\n     He for such slip this reason good can show,--\r\n     'How could I mock one whom I do not know?'\"\r\n\r\nAretino, returning a Roland for his Oliver, rejoined:\r\n\r\n     \"Francescon, wretched rhymer, here is laid,\r\n     Who of all things save asses evil said:\r\n     His plea in favour of the long-eared race,\r\n     A cousinship that none could fail to trace.\"[168]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168:\r\n\r\n     \"Qui giace l'Aretino, poeta Tosco,\r\n     Che d'ognun disse male fuorchè di Christo,\r\n     Scusandosi col dir--'Non lo conosco.'\"\r\n\r\n     \"Qui giace Francescon, poeta pessimo,\r\n     Che disse mal d'ognun fuorchè del asino,\r\n     Scusandosi col dir--che egli era prossimo.\"]\r\n\r\nBut enough of such ribaldry. The writings of Aretino and his\r\nbiography are in one respect useful to the historian of his time. The\r\ndegrading views of human nature afforded by both form a contrast to\r\nthe bright luminaries which yet lingered above the horizon, whilst\r\nby their shadows they complete the verity of the picture. Favoured\r\nby fortune far beyond his deserts during life, his memory is equally\r\nindebted to art. The encomium of Ariosto has already been quoted, and\r\nthe pencil of his friend Titian has preserved his person in several\r\nportraits; one of them, which, though unfinished, is perhaps the\r\nnoblest commemorated on Vecellio's canvass, adorns the Pitti Gallery,\r\nand almost persuades us that Aretino was a gentleman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom an age too prolific in parasitical literature and in shameless\r\nmorals, there has descended to us a name radiant with genius, and\r\nunsullied in reputation. The historian of Urbino may contribute\r\na leaf to the garland which fame has hung upon the brows of\r\nVITTORIA COLONNA,[*169] for her mother was a princess of\r\nMontefeltro, and to her maternal ancestry she seems indebted for\r\nher heritage of talent. She was daughter of Fabrizio Colonna, by\r\nAgnesina daughter of Duke Federigo of Urbino, and was born in 1490.\r\nWhen but four years old she was betrothed, in conformity with the\r\nusage of her times, to a mere infant. Yet her marriage may be deemed\r\nfortunate, for her husband, Ferdinando Francesco Marquis of Pescara,\r\nwas not only a cadet of the very ancient house of Avalos, which had\r\naccompanied Alfonzo of Aragon from Spain to Naples, and had married\r\nthe heiress of Aquino and Pescara in the Abruzzi, but, among the\r\nwarriors of an era still fertile in heroes, none was more early\r\ndistinguished or promoted. He died prematurely at thirty-three,\r\nwhile in command of the imperial troops. His consort, imitating her\r\ngrandmother Battista Sforza, had learned to console the childless\r\nsolitude of his prolonged absences by habits of study, and in them\r\nfound resource amid the bereavements of a widowhood which no offer\r\nof marriage could tempt her to infringe. But though she sought not\r\nthe world or its incense, her high rank, wealth, and personal graces,\r\ngained many an admirer, whilst the elevated beauty of her poetry,\r\nthe charms of her conversation and correspondence, attracted to her\r\nthe respectful adoration of the learned. She cherished her husband's\r\nmemory with rare constancy, modifying grief by spiritual solace. In\r\nher piety there was neither blind superstition nor cold formality.\r\nDevotional exercises and religious intercourse shared her hours with\r\npoetry and literature tinged by their influence, and among her most\r\nwelcome visitors were some of those Italian divines who favoured the\r\nReformation. On this account she has been claimed as a convert to\r\nprotestantism, but upon insufficient grounds. She adhered apparently\r\nto the faith of her fathers, and was spared by a timely death, in\r\n1547, from witnessing the persecutions undergone by her friends of\r\nthe new creed.[*170] Among those to whom the sympathies of genius and\r\npiety united her was Michael Angelo, who testified his respect by a\r\nvisit to her death-bed, and his regret by a touching sonnet to her\r\nmemory.[*171] Not less gratifying was the tribute to her worth which\r\nAriosto has embalmed in seven stanzas of the Furioso, canto xxxvii.:--\r\n\r\n     \"One will choose, and such will choose, that she\r\n       All envy shall so well have overthrown,\r\n       No other woman can offended be,\r\n       If, passing others, her I praise alone;\r\n       No joys this one but immortality,\r\n       Through her sweet style, and better know I none.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote *169: For the life of Vittoria Colonna, see CAMPORI,\r\n_Vittoria Colonna_ in _Atti e Mem. della Dep. di St. Pat.\r\ndell'Emilia_, N.S., vol.

Among these was LAURA BATTIFERRI,\r\nborn at Urbino in 1522-3, whose genius has inspired the pens of Caro,\r\nVarchi, Mazzuchelli, and others; and whom by a questionable, and,\r\nas regarded her morals, a most unmerited compliment, Pietro Vettori\r\ncompared to Sappho. Following a very different model, she, like\r\nVittoria Colonna, composed many devotional pieces, often versifying\r\nthe sadder portions of sacred writ, two volumes of which were\r\npublished at Florence. Rarer perhaps, and more creditable than her\r\npoetic celebrity, was the reputation for moral worth transmitted to\r\nus in connection with her name, which she happily exchanged by her\r\nunion with Bartolomeo Ammanati, notwithstanding frowns from a high\r\nquarter. The Duchess Vittoria, proud of her talents, laid upon her\r\nan injunction not to marry out of her native state. This restriction\r\nhad the usual result; her husband was a Florentine sculptor, and it\r\nrequired all the influence of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese with his\r\nsister to obtain pardon for such flagrant disobedience.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"In 1558, there were at the court of Urbino--of old the resort\r\nof talented persons--many great and famous poets, such as Messer\r\nBernardo Capello, Messer Bernardo Tasso, Messer Girolamo Muzio,\r\nand Messer Antonio Gallo, whose whole occupation it was, like\r\nwhite gentle swans, emulously to sing, and celebrate in verse, the\r\neminent beauty, and far more eminent virtues, of the illustrious\r\nDuchess.\" With these names might be coupled Dionigi Atanagi, the\r\nwriter of this euphuism, and also Annibale Caro, Antonio Allegretti,\r\nMarco Montano, and Cornelio Lanci. Of Tasso and Muzio we elsewhere\r\nspeak. Caro and Capello were connected with the ducal family only\r\nby one or two complimentary effusions, in return for occasional\r\nhospitality. Allegretti indited an epithalamium on the marriage of\r\nDuchess Vittoria, in which, alluding to the heraldic bearings then\r\nunited, he celebrated the prudent hand of the wise shepherd (Paul\r\nIII.), who transplanted that virgin Lily into good soil under the\r\nshadow of the mighty Oak; in conclusion, he summoned the attendants\r\nto scatter acorns and _fleurs-de-lis_ before the bridal pair. Lanci's\r\ncomedies no longer \"fret and strut their hour upon the stage,\" but\r\nthey are said to deserve the praise of comparative purity in an age\r\nwhen decency was no necessary ingredient of scenic merit. Three names\r\nremain for consideration, who, as natives of the duchy, may claim a\r\nbrief notice.\r\n\r\nDIONIGI ATANAGI was born at Cagli, and, after twenty-five\r\nyears spent at the Roman court, returned, in 1557, to recruit his\r\nconstitution in his native air. He was invited to Pesaro by his\r\nsovereign, at the suggestion of Bernardo Tasso, who wished him to\r\nrevise the _Amadigi_; but there he found his health still further\r\nimpaired by mental fatigue. Several of his sonnets are addressed to\r\nmembers of the ducal family and court; one of them, inscribed to\r\nGuidobaldo II., lauds him as \"a prince and captain of invincible\r\nvalour, of wisdom superhuman, of bounty and benignity past belief,\r\nof ineffable eloquence, of incomparable liberality and magnificence,\r\na paragon of religion, the lofty stay of Italian honour and renown.\r\nBeing the natural sovereign as well as special patron and singular\r\nbenefactor of the author, whose every hope rests in him next to\r\nGod, it is his desire, in the full knowledge how much is due to his\r\nExcellency's infinite merits, to fill with heroic praises of him\r\nwhatever work he may undertake; but overwhelmed by the grandeur of\r\nthe theme, his silence is broken only by excuses for his deficiency.\"\r\nThis fulsome trash is no unfair specimen of such compositions. The\r\nfollowing invitation to Urbino, as an asylum of the Muses, is in a\r\nsomewhat happier vein, which we have endeavoured to render:--\r\n\r\n     \"Anime belle, e di virtute amiche,\r\n       Cui fero sdegno di fortuna offende,\r\n       Sì che ven gite povere e mendiche,\r\n       Come e lei piace, che pietà contende;\r\n       Se di por fine alle miserie antiche\r\n       Caldo desio l'afflitto cor v'incende,\r\n       Ratte correte alia gran QUERCIA d'oro,\r\n       Ond'avrete alimento ombra e ristoro.\r\n\r\n     \"Qui regna un Signor placido e benigno,\r\n       Ch'altro ch'altrui giovar unqua non pensa,\r\n       Cortese, e d'ogni real laude degno;\r\n       Che ciascun pasce a sua ricca mensa,\r\n       E 'n buon revolge ogni destin maligno,\r\n       Mentre le grazie sue largo dispensa\r\n       GUIDOBALDO, di principi fenici,\r\n       Che può col guardo sol far l'uom felice.\r\n\r\n     \"Qui le buone arti ed i nobili costumi,\r\n       Senno, fede e valor, fido albergo hanno;\r\n       Qui fioriscon gl'ingegni, e chiari lumi\r\n       Via più ch'il sol spargendo intorno vanno:\r\n       Qui mel le piante, qui dan latte i fiumi;\r\n       Qui pace è queta senza alcuno affanno;\r\n       Qui 'l vizio è morto, e virtù bella è viva\r\n       Beato chi ci nasce e chi ci arriva.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     1.\r\n\r\n     Ah! beauteous souls, to virtue ever prone,\r\n       Whom evil Fortune's cruel grudge offends,\r\n     Bereft of every stay, and left to groan\r\n       By her caprice, while heavy grief impends;\r\n     If in your aching hearts that grief evoke\r\n       A wish such lengthened miseries to close,\r\n     Speed 'neath the umbrage of the golden OAK\r\n       To share its genial shelter and repose.\r\n\r\n\r\n     2.\r\n\r\n     A gentle and benignant Prince there reigns,\r\n       On other's weal exclusively intent,\r\n     Courteous, and worth all praise in royal strains,\r\n       From whose well plenished table none are sent.\r\n     Each evil destiny by him disarmed,\r\n       His gracious boons are scattered widely round;\r\n     E'en by his winning glance is each one charmed,\r\n       Phoenix of princes, GUIDOBALDO crowned.\r\n\r\n\r\n     3.\r\n\r\n     Ennobling arts and noble manners here,\r\n       With wit, and faith, and courage have their home,\r\n     While genius' meteor gleams more bright appear\r\n       Than Phoebus flickering in the skiey dome.\r\n     Here honey-laden meads and milky streams\r\n       To painless peace attract, and gentle rest;\r\n     Here vice is dead, while worth resplendent seems:\r\n       Happy such duchy's native, or its guest!\r\n\r\nAmong the men of letters whom it was the pride of Guidobaldo II. to\r\nattract round him, was ANTONIO GALLI, of Urbino. His uncle,\r\nthe Cavalier Angelo, had preceded him, both in the cultivation of the\r\nmuses, and in the good graces of the Dukes, having been employed on\r\nvarious political missions by Guidantonio, Oddantonio, and Federigo;\r\nduring his leisure hours he had composed sonnets and canzonets in\r\nimitation of Petrarch, then the popular model for minor poets. For\r\nAntonio has been claimed the questionable honour of introducing\r\npastoral dramas, which long exercised a debilitating influence on the\r\nliterature of Italy, and spread from there the vitiating style to\r\nother lands. He, too, held diplomatic appointments at the courts of\r\nRome and Spain, and to the republic of Venice; and having acquired\r\nthe reputation of a man, not less of business than of letters, the\r\nDuke entrusted him with the superintendence of Prince Francesco\r\nMaria, until his death in 1551. His contemporary and friend MARCO\r\nMONTANO enjoyed his sovereign's favour without sharing any\r\npublic employments. In youth he had been secretary of Cardinal Carlo\r\nBorromeo, and afterwards addicted himself to Latin and Italian verse,\r\nwith a success sufficient to gain him applause from Baldi, and from\r\nTasso the compliment of being ranked next to Guarini among the living\r\nbards of Italy. The suffrage of these partial friends has not been\r\nconfirmed by posterity; for Montano's poetry lies forgotten, and his\r\nname is cherished only in connection with the literary history of his\r\nnative state.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the names which shed a lustre upon Urbino, in return for\r\nhospitalities received at that court, was that of BERNARDO\r\nTASSO,[*173] whose splendour would have been more conspicuous\r\nin the galaxy of Italian poets, had he not given birth to a son of\r\nyet brighter genius. The house of Tasso was of ancient descent in the\r\nBergamasque territory; but Bernardo drew his first breath at Venice,\r\nthe home of his mother, a lady of the Cornari. Of his youth we know\r\nnothing, except that he enjoyed the advantage of a liberal education,\r\nand that his morals were no exception to the lax habits of the age.\r\nAn avowed lover of the matronly Ginevra Malatesta, he sang her beauty\r\nin strains complaining of her continence; and at Rome he dangled in\r\npoverty after Tullia d'Aragona, one of those splendid examples of\r\nwasted powers and successful vice over which the philosopher puzzles\r\nwhile the historian sighs, whose talents were given to the Muses,\r\nwhose graces were devoted to Venus.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *173: Cf. PASOLINI, _I Genitori di T. Tasso_ (Roma, 1895).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BERNARDO TASSO\r\n\r\n_From a picture once in the possession of James Dennistoun_]\r\n\r\nFinding himself past thirty without either an independence or a\r\ncareer, he commenced the life of a literary courtier, for which the\r\nsocial condition of Italy under her many principalities held out\r\nconsiderable inducements. His first essay was as private secretary to\r\nCount Guido Rangone, a warrior chief of some distinction; and during\r\nthe Lombard campaign in 1526 Bernardo was sent by him on missions of\r\nimportance to the Doge of Genoa and to the Pope.[*174] He remained\r\nwith the latter on Bourbon's approach, and was commissioned by his\r\nHoliness to seek out Lannoy at Siena, and urge him to repair to\r\nRome, take command of the imperial troops, and put an end to their\r\noutrages. In this journey the speed of his Turkish charger enabled\r\nhim to escape from an assault which proved fatal to one of his\r\nattendants. Though unsuccessful in the negotiation, his dexterity\r\nrecommended him as papal envoy to the court of France, in order to\r\narrange the advance of Lautrec, whom he accompanied into Italy. After\r\nthe destruction of the French army before Naples, we find him for a\r\ntime secretary to Laura Duchess of Ferrara, and he accompanied the\r\nMarquis of Vasto on the Turkish campaign in Hungary.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *174: He went in 1528 to Paris on behalf of Conte Guido.]\r\n\r\nIt was in 1531 that he entered the service of Ferdinando or Ferrante\r\nSanseverino, Prince of Salerno, whom he attended to Africa in the\r\nexpedition of Charles V. against Tunis. His patron was a prince of\r\nample means, and of corresponding generosity to persons of literary\r\nmerit; and Tasso, having distinguished himself by several published\r\ncollections of verses, as well as by the able performance of his\r\nmore immediate duties, was rewarded by offices and pensions yielding\r\nhim about 1000 scudi a year. Finding himself thus independent at\r\nforty-six, he married Porzia de' Rossi, the beautiful, accomplished,\r\nand well-dowried daughter of a noble family in Pistoia, and settled\r\nhimself at Sorrento, where he spent the best and happiest years of\r\nhis life, and, with occasional interruptions of business and calls to\r\nthe camp, pursued his poetical studies.[*175]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *175: Cf. CAPASSO, _Il Tasso e la sua famiglia a Sorrento_\r\n(Napoli, 1866).]\r\n\r\nOn that plain which matures a tropical luxuriance of vegetation,\r\nand where nature lavishes the brightest of her varying tints,\r\nhis inspiration was developed, and the more brilliant genius of\r\nhis son imbibed its earliest impressions. The casino in which\r\nTorquato first saw the light[176] commanded a view of unparalleled\r\nbeauty;--the bright bay and its far-off islands of picturesque\r\noutline,--Naples, with its endless line of white suburbs glittering\r\nalong the shore,--Vesuvius, the marvellous workshop of volcanic\r\nwonders,--golden sunsets of unclouded glow, and mellowed combinations\r\nof mountain and marine scenery awaiting the pencil of Salvator Rosa.\r\nNor were these the only charms which the poet found in this spot. He\r\nhas celebrated in his correspondence its balmy and healthful climate,\r\nand the courteous hospitality of its inhabitants. These qualities\r\nstill attract strangers to the Piano di Sorrento, and the villa which\r\nsheltered Torquato on his escape from Ferrara is now a comfortable\r\nhotel, inviting them to gaze from its beetling cliff on the scenes of\r\nhis youthful inspiration.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 176: On the 11th of March, 1544; Bernardo was born the 11th\r\nNovember, 1493.]\r\n\r\nThe _Amadigi_ was commenced in that genial spot, and the Prince of\r\nSalerno complacently anticipated the extended reputation which it\r\npromised to his protégé. But the storm, meanwhile, gathered, which\r\nwas to sweep patron and poet from their palmy state. The Prince, by\r\nentanglements which we need not trace, found himself compromised with\r\nthe Viceroy, Don Pedro Toledo, and, from mingled alarm and pique,\r\nsacrificed his vast hereditary stake, by passing over to the French\r\nservice. This happened in 1552,[*177] and Tasso followed his fortunes\r\nwithout being involved in his treason. After accompanying him to\r\nFrance, he came, in 1554, to Rome, where he took up his abode, in the\r\nhope of soon being joined by his wife and family, and of establishing\r\nhimself there. But she was detained at Naples, for the purpose of\r\nrecovering part of her husband's property, or at all events her own\r\nfortune, which had been escheated on his flight. Her difficulties\r\nwere increased by the selfish conduct of her own relations, and\r\nat length, in the spring of 1556, she died suddenly, not without\r\nsuspicion of poison. \"I have lost,\" writes her husband, \"a woman\r\nwhose virtues and estimable qualities rendered her beloved and\r\nendeared to me as life itself, who was worthy of general admiration,\r\nand in whose bosom I had hoped peacefully to pass the closing years\r\nof my old age!\" But other cares were falling thickly around him.\r\nThough joined by his son Torquato, he could never rescue his only\r\nother child Cornelia from her maternal relations, and suffered\r\nintense anxiety for her welfare. Still nominally in the Prince of\r\nSalerno's service, and actually employed as his confidential agent,\r\nhe found himself estranged from his regard, his correspondence\r\ninterrupted, and his salary irregularly paid. Bitterly experiencing\r\nthe not unfrequent guerdon of fidelity to fallen dignitaries, he thus\r\naddressed his patron in February, 1556:--\r\n\r\n\"Your Excellency has now to learn the influence of unstable and\r\nmalignant fortune upon this your unhappy servant. You know how often\r\nyou have quoted me as an instance of happiness, saying that I had a\r\nbeautiful and virtuous wife, by whom I was beloved, and on whom I\r\ndoated; that I had the finest children, ample means, an excellent\r\nhouse well decorated, as well as comfortably furnished; and that I\r\nenjoyed the respect and good opinion of the world, as well as that\r\nmost important advantage of all, your favour. Now you may see in\r\nhow brief an interval I have fallen from that height of happiness\r\ninto the depths of misery. I have lost my means, earned, as all\r\nknow, most honourably, and with no small fatigue and peril. I have\r\nlost my independence; and, in a word, my every comfort. I have been\r\ndeprived of my dearest wife, and with her have occasioned to my\r\nunhappy children the sacrifice of their mother's dowry, and of all\r\nmy remaining prospect of maintaining them, and conducting them to\r\nthat position which every respectable and affectionate parent would\r\ndesire. But, worst of all, I perceive from obvious symptoms, that I\r\nhave forfeited your favour without having given you the slightest\r\ncause. The reason of my sinking into these misfortunes, being obvious\r\nto the whole world, should not be concealed from you. I am so\r\nsituated, that any one refusing to compassionate me must be devoid of\r\npity and all good feeling; and if you still retain the smallest share\r\nof that magnanimity, generosity, or gratitude which you were wont so\r\nhonourably to manifest to your servants, you will yet have pity on\r\nme, and will endeavour to raise me from that abyss of wretchedness\r\ninto which I have fallen in your service.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote *177: 1547.]\r\n\r\nThis sad appeal meeting with no response, he retired from the\r\nPrince's service with a nominal pension of 300 scudi, which seems\r\nnever to have been paid him. Writing to a friend, he says, \"I have\r\nthrown out into this sea of troubles many anchors of reason, to save\r\nmy tempest-tost mind from shipwreck. But I fear that, in the long\r\nrun, if not conducted into port by a favouring breeze from some\r\nbenignant prince, I may be swamped, from the cable of my constancy\r\nparting; for it is hard from prosperity and happiness to fall into\r\nmisery, and struggle with famine.\" Scared away from Rome by the din\r\nof coming war, in the renewed strife between France and Spain for the\r\ndomination of the Peninsula, and\r\n\r\n     \"Eating the bitter bread of banishment,\"\r\n\r\nhe had reached Ravenna, when an invitation arrived from Guidobaldo\r\nII., Duke of Urbino, a cousin of his late patron, whose court offered\r\nto genius just such a haven as he had hoped for. In October, 1556,\r\nhe reached Pesaro, where the Duke assigned as a residence for the\r\npoet his casino called the Barchetto, a house which still stands\r\nwithin the walls of Pesaro, surrounded by a smiling garden. Its\r\nvery limited accommodation, now used by the gardener, cannot have\r\nafforded a commodious dwelling, but such as it was, it appears to\r\nhave satisfied Bernardo, who after a few weeks was encouraged by the\r\nDuke's courtesy to send for his son, with a view to establishing\r\nhimself in that capital. His residence there somewhat exceeded two\r\nyears, during which we gather from his correspondence few incidents\r\nbeyond his literary occupations. Though avowing himself in the\r\nservice of Guidobaldo, he does not seem to have had from him either\r\nemployment or a fixed maintenance, but was probably supported by his\r\nhospitality. He now put the finishing touches to his _Amadigi_, begun\r\nfourteen years before, and repaid the favours bestowed upon him with\r\nthe usual homage of a courtly poet. Anxiously clinging to the hope\r\nof making his peace with Spain, in order to recover his own and his\r\nwife's property which had been confiscated at Naples, he obtained\r\nthe mediation of several courts in his favour, and even had recourse\r\nto the good offices of Cardinal Pole with Philip II., then husband\r\nof the English Queen Mary. In this object Guidobaldo particularly\r\ninterested himself, and it was at his suggestion that Bernardo\r\ndedicated his poem to that monarch, whose praises, with those of\r\nhis consort, had been already sung in its eleventh canto. But his\r\npearls were lavished unavailingly on one incapable of appreciating\r\neither the gift or the donor, and a long apologetic letter from\r\nGirolamo Ruscelli, which accompanied the peace-offering, remained\r\nunacknowledged.\r\n\r\nIn these times literary advertisements were unknown, but the\r\nreputation of a forthcoming work was heralded by a scarcely less\r\neffectual expedient. Passages of it were handed about in manuscript\r\namong literary circles, and criticisms were requested from the\r\nauthor's more intimate friends. Thus was it with the _Amadigi_; and\r\nBernardo has not shrunk from giving to the world the letters by which\r\nhe sought for or replied to such suggestions. Dionigi Atanagi was\r\nsummoned from Cagli by the Duke, for the purpose of making those\r\nverbal corrections which were rendered irksome to the poet by weak\r\nsight. Sperone Speroni writes to the author that, in two revisions,\r\nhe had removed the vulgarisms, roughnesses, and redundancies,\r\ncancelling above two hundred stanzas, and that, in a third reading,\r\nhe would probably delete as many more. The first conception was that\r\nof a regular epic; but the cold reception which it met with from his\r\nfriends induced Bernardo to adopt a manner more conformable to the\r\nromantic and less fettered taste of the age. In the summer of 1557\r\nhe read a canto each night, at Urbino, to the Duchess Vittoria and a\r\nselect audience. Having thus raised public anticipation, the poet was\r\nanxious to reap the fruits of his labours in honour and emolument;\r\nbut he found a double difficulty in obtaining the 500 scudi required\r\nfor the expense of an edition, and in procuring the papal licence\r\nwithout having the work submitted regularly to the censure. At\r\nlength, in 1560, it issued, by the aid of Guidobaldo, from the press\r\nof Giolito, at Venice, in which town Tasso had chiefly resided for\r\neighteen months, and where he, for a short time, acted as secretary\r\nto a literary academy, established in 1558, before which he read his\r\nEssay on Poetry. His remaining years produced few incidents. After\r\nan ineffectual overture to take service at the court of Savoy, he\r\nbecame chief secretary to the Duke of Mantua, who made him governor\r\nof Ostiglia. There he died on the 4th of September, 1569; and the\r\nepitaph penned by his son, but never placed over his ashes, runs\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n  Erected by his son Torquato to\r\n  BERNARDO TASSO,\r\n  Distinguished for the fertility and eminence\r\n  of his genius, in the relaxation of poetry\r\n  and in the affairs of princes, in both of which\r\n  he has left memorials of his industry, as\r\n  well as for the fickleness and inconstancy of\r\n  his fortunes.\r\n  He lived LXXVI. years, and died IV Sept. MDLXIX.\r\n\r\nHis bereavement was thus intimated by Torquato to the Duke of\r\nUrbino: \"On the 4th of September it pleased the Lord God to call to\r\nhimself the blessed soul of my father, whose death, although in all\r\nrespects mature, is nevertheless felt by me as most untimely, and,\r\nI am persuaded, will be very unacceptable to your Excellency, who\r\nby so many proofs of regard considered him among your most esteemed\r\nservants, and towards whom I know his especial reverence. Of this\r\nrespect, and of the infinite obligations under which he lay to your\r\nExcellency, I am most willingly the representative; and if that\r\nfavour which your Excellency ever extended for his protection, and\r\nthat of his interests, be devolved upon me, I shall deem it an ample\r\npatrimony that he has left me. And herewith praying a happy issue to\r\nall your honoured desires, I humbly kiss your hands. From Ferrara,\r\nthe 28th September, 1569.\"\r\n\r\nAn amiable disposition and agreeable manners procured for Bernardo\r\nTasso, in all the fluctuations of his career, troops of friends,\r\nincluding the brightest names of his age. In the many situations of\r\ntrust which he filled, his prudence and address, his fidelity and\r\nsincerity, acquired for him general estimation. Although his literary\r\nreputation now hangs, in a great degree, upon that of his son, his\r\ncontemporaries, who knew not what the latter had in store for them,\r\nregarded him as the first epic poet of his age, comparing him even\r\nwith Ariosto, whom he freely and avowedly imitated. To draw out some\r\nfifty-seven thousand verses on a borrowed and almost barren theme,\r\nin a style anticipated by several preceding minstrels, was an effort\r\nrepugnant to fine genius, and susceptible of no marked success. Its\r\nnecessary failing is diffuseness, varying from inflation to languor;\r\nits redeeming merit an acknowledged facility, sustained at times\r\nby fertile images, and by delicately beautiful descriptions. It is\r\ngenerally flowing, though, at times, feeble; yet is considered by\r\nPanizzi \"unquestionably the best romantic narrative from amongst\r\nthose not founded on the traditions respecting Charlemagne.\" Indeed,\r\nhis poetry, while sharing with coeval productions the blemishes\r\nof exuberant ornament and quaint conceits, is seldom surpassed in\r\npathos, and his dulcet numbers reconcile us to his faults of manner.\r\nWhat, to its author, was probably its most important quality, is now,\r\nperhaps, its greatest defect,--the profuse flattery of which it was\r\nmade the medium. \"To eat the bread of others\" was the often hard,\r\nusually degrading, tenure self-imposed on court poets; and to such, a\r\nsubject admitting of endless episodes, and the frequent introduction\r\nof existing personages, in their real characters or under transparent\r\nallegories, was a harvest of princely favour and of wealth. This,\r\nhowever, was an error of the age, which ought not to be charged on\r\nany single poet, least of all on one who had given his best and\r\nworthiest efforts to a barren soil. The fugitive poetry of Tasso\r\npartakes largely of this adulatory colouring. But, for him is claimed\r\nsuch praise as the invention of the Ode deserves; and this was deemed\r\ncreditable service to a literature which has often invested trifles\r\nwith undue importance.\r\n\r\nBernardo was a secretary ere he became a poet, and his reputation\r\nrests more surely upon his correspondence than on his verses. That\r\nrhetoric which Bembo inculcated by precept and practice had become\r\na fashion among men of literary pretension; their letters were\r\ncomposed as models of style, and manuscript or printed collections of\r\nthem were in very general circulation. Such compositions, when thus\r\nwritten for the public, wanted the freshness and simplicity which\r\nconstitute their best charm; but they gained attractions of another\r\nsort, and came to be read more for their manner than their matter. To\r\nthis class belong the letters of the elder Tasso: nitid in style, but\r\ncold in feeling, they exhibit the niceties of Italian idiom, rather\r\nthan the familiarities of Italian life. A very favourable specimen,\r\nbut too long for insertion here, is that in which he proposes to his\r\nwife the principles which ought to guide her in bringing up their\r\nchildren, and in the formation of their manners and character. Though\r\nsometimes smoothed down to commonplace, it breathes a fine spirit of\r\npaternal affection, and combines religious observance with a becoming\r\nknowledge of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI\r\n\r\n     Torquato Tasso--His insanity--Theories of Dr. Verga and Mr.\r\n     Wilde--His connection with Urbino--His intercourse with the\r\n     Princess of Este--His portraits--His letter to the Duke of\r\n     Urbino--His confinement--His death--His poetry--Battista\r\n     Guarini.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur passing notice of Italian song would be incomplete without the\r\nname of Italy's favourite bard, even had TASSO[*178] found\r\nno hospitality at Urbino, no sympathy from its Duchess Lucrezia.\r\nYet what shall we say of one whose loves and woes have filled\r\nmany volumes,--whose life, character, and motives, after baffling\r\nbiographers, and puzzling moralists, are still matter rather of\r\ncontroversy than of history, of speculation than of fact. That he was\r\nimbued with true genius, with its failings as well as its powers, is\r\nfixed by the unanimous verdict of posterity. That his misfortunes\r\nhave tended greatly to enhance the sympathising veneration which\r\nhangs around his name, may be quoted in proof of the eternal justice\r\nof Providence. The rolls of Parnassus may exhibit names more gifted,\r\nthe annals of human suffering are inscribed with greater calamities\r\nand deeper griefs, but in no other case, perhaps, have talents and\r\ntrials been more mingled together on an equally prominent stage.\r\nHis supposed persecutor was elevated enough to command the world's\r\ngaze, and upon him there accordingly has been heaped the blame\r\nof a wretchedness in a great measure self-imposed, and inseparable\r\nfrom a morbid and diseased temperament. The complaints of the poet\r\nhave been embodied in notes alternately of wailing and of fire, by a\r\npoet of a nation whom he would have deemed barbarous.[179] The charge\r\nwhich history has recorded against Tasso is to this purpose. That,\r\nwhilst a retainer of Alfonso II. of Ferrara, his heart was enslaved\r\nby that Duke's sister, Princess Leonora d'Este, and that his passion\r\nwas ill-concealed in the verses it inspired. That Alfonso having\r\nsuspected the audacious fault, harshly visited it with a series of\r\npersecutions, and finally shut him up for seven years in bedlam as a\r\nlunatic.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *178: For the life of Torquato Tasso, see SOLERTI, in\r\nthree volumes (Torino, 1895).

Precocious in all mental powers, he\r\nspoke intelligibly at six months, knew Greek and wrote verses at\r\nseven years, and at eighteen published the _Rinaldo_, a sustained\r\nand applauded epic.[*180] The reverses of his early days on which we\r\nhave already dwelt in our notice of his father, the premature loss\r\nof his mother, the injudicious liberty of thought and action allowed\r\nhim by Bernardo, and the rough criticisms to which his writings\r\nwere subjected ere his character and knowledge of mankind were\r\ndeveloped--all these tinged deeper the gloom of his constitutional\r\nsadness, and formed a training the most fatal to one of innately\r\nmorbid sensibilities. The results were obvious. Bald before his\r\ntime, his digestion enervated, subject to faintings and fevers\r\nintermittent or delirious, his health at thirty was ruined, his\r\nnerves and brain shattered. The natural consequence of his precocity\r\nwas an overweening pride in his accomplishments, which rendered him\r\njealous, touchy, and quarrelsome; and though destined from youth\r\nto wander in search of given bread, nature had neither granted him\r\nthe humble resignation required for such a lot, nor imbued him with\r\na daring spirit to rise above it. Men who live in courts must be\r\nprepared to encounter intrigues; those who publish poetry should lay\r\ntheir account with unsparing strictures; and the smaller the court,\r\nor the more prominent their poetic merits, so much the greater need\r\nhave they of forbearance and philosophy. But Tasso possessed neither;\r\nand the jealousies of Pigna and Guarini, the malice of the della\r\nCrusca critics, stung him to the quick.[*181] A slight or fancied\r\naffront, which he met with from one of the courtiers of Ferrara,\r\nthough avenged by a duel, brought his symptoms to a head.[*182] From\r\nthat moment, when in his thirty-third year, we find him a victim to\r\nthe restlessness, suspicions, fears, sad forebodings, and hopeless\r\nmisery, which afflict lipemaniacs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *180: See on the _Rinaldo_, PROTO, _Sul Rinaldo di T.T._\r\n(Napoli, 1895).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *181: Cf. D'OVIDIO, _Di una antica testimonianza circa la\r\ncontroversia della Crusca con Tasso_ (Napoli, 1894) and VIVALDI, _La\r\npiù grande polemica del Cinquecento_ (Catanzaro Caliò, 1895). SOLERTI\r\nreviewed this last in _Giornale Stor. d. Lett. Ital._, vol. XXVII.,\r\np. 426.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *182: It was in September, 1576. Tasso had in July thought\r\nhimself insulted by Ercole Fucci and his brother Maddalò; he boxed\r\nErcole's ears. Then, in September, they met him and assaulted him.\r\nThere was no duel. Only Solerti has found out the truth.]\r\n\r\nUnder such sinister influences the crisis speedily arrived. Whilst\r\nseated in the Duchess of Urbino's apartment, in her mother's palace,\r\nhe rushed with his dagger on an attendant who chanced to enter.\r\nThis, whether a premeditated assault, or an idle hallucination,\r\nseems to have been the ground on which he was, by order of Alfonso,\r\nplaced under restraint; but when the paroxysm was passed, he was\r\nreconducted to the Duke's presence with ample assurances of pardon.\r\nThe iron had, however, entered into his soul, and the idea that he\r\nwas in disgrace, owing to the malicious backbiting of foes real\r\nor imaginary, could not be driven from his mind. He retired from\r\ntheir supposed persecutions to a Franciscan convent,[*183] but,\r\nfinding in its quiet no peace for his troubled spirit, he fled in\r\ndisguise from these illusions, and, led perhaps by the bright memory\r\nof his early days, arrived on the sunny shores of Sorrento, where\r\nhe sought a refuge with his married sister. But alas! the charms of\r\nthat radiant land shed no gladsome influence on his soul. Ere a few\r\nmonths passed, he returned to Ferrara, in hopes of proving to the\r\nDuke that the crimes and the frenzy, of which he believed himself\r\naccused, were equally calumnies. In the festive and kindly reception\r\nwith which he was greeted, the wayward poet found new grounds for\r\njealousy, imagining a plot to be formed against his literary fame,\r\nby plunging him in a round of dissipation, whilst \"others\" (meaning\r\nhis patron) should reap the glory and profits due to his creative\r\ngenius. That conduct so provoking should have brought upon him real\r\nslights, in addition to his imagined wrongs, can scarcely be doubted;\r\nand, wounded at heart, he again had recourse to flight, wandering\r\naimlessly by Mantua, Padua, and Venice, to Pesaro, the refuge of\r\nhis happier youth. We shall elsewhere introduce the letter which\r\nhe there addressed to the Duke of Urbino; though it obtained him a\r\ncompassionate welcome, his new host naturally counselled his return\r\nto the home of his adoption, as the place where he was most certain\r\nto be cared for. But in a fresh access of disease, he escaped from\r\nsuch suggestions, and obeyed them not until after he had visited\r\nTurin, disguised by poverty and filth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *183: He was placed under restraint in S. Francesco, in\r\nFerrara, in fact.]\r\n\r\nIf these views of Tasso's malady[*184] are as conformable to truth\r\nas they appear to be with the representations of his biographers,\r\nthe time seems to have been now fully arrived for his seclusion,\r\nas a measure of justice to himself and of security to others. It is\r\nquite another question how far the treatment he met with at Sant'Anna\r\nwas that best suited to his symptoms. Had he lived in times when the\r\npathology of mind was more fully understood, and more ably managed,\r\nhis genius might, by timely care, have been saved from a miserable\r\nwreck; but his brain surely then required such aid as medical science\r\ncould afford. If this be granted, the defence of Duke Alfonso is\r\ncomplete, whatever might have been the discipline resorted to in the\r\nhospital. Yet it may be well to remember, from the testimony of the\r\npoor maniac, as well as of others, that the delusions which for years\r\nhad haunted him, regarding wrongs supposed to have been received\r\nfrom that sovereign and his courtiers, had given bitterness to his\r\nwords, and pungency to his pen, little in accordance with the fulsome\r\nlanguage of his age, or the haughty temper of his patron; that if\r\nthe poet was a victim of imaginary affronts, the Duke had met at his\r\nhands with real insults. But even were Alfonso's motives not those\r\nof unmixed kindness, the necessity of seclusion for Tasso cannot be\r\naffected by any such consideration, nor by the consequent aggravation\r\nof his malady from defective skill.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *184: On the whole subject of Tasso's madness, see CORRADI,\r\n_Le Infermità di T.T._ in _Memorie dell'Istit. Lombardo_ (1880),\r\nvol. XIV.; RONCORONI, _Genio e Pazzia in T.T._ (Torino, 1896); and\r\nGAUDENZI, _Studio Psicopatol. sopra T.T._ (Vercelli, 1898); and\r\nSOLERTI, _op. cit._, _supra_.]\r\n\r\nAn admission of Tasso's mental alienation was made by his intimate\r\nfriend Manso, and has been repeated by various writers; yet other\r\nbiographers, anxious to relieve their hero from the reproach of\r\nmadness, have essayed to screen him by charges of cruelty against the\r\nDuke of Ferrara. Whilst Verga's theory appears to place the poet's\r\nmalady upon its proper footing, and, by implication, to absolve his\r\npatron, that author goes a step further, and maintains that the\r\noldest and best informed authorities bear out a belief in the uniform\r\nand considerate kindness of Alfonso towards his wayward laureate, and\r\nprove that the allegations of Torquato's insanity having been but\r\nthe pretext of a stern tyrant, bent on punishing the presumption of\r\nan unworthy aspirant to his sister's love, were piquant additions of\r\nafter writers. We shall presently have a few words to add in regard\r\nto this entanglement; meanwhile, let us see the conclusion drawn by\r\nDr. Verga, from his able argument. \"We may, therefore, infer that\r\nthe Duke shut up Tasso in Sant'Anna, neither as a punishment for\r\nambitious love, or unguarded and offensive expressions, nor as an\r\nobstacle to his conferring the illustration of his genius on rival\r\ncourts, but simply because he saw that the poet's melancholy rendered\r\nhim beside himself, dependent upon skilful treatment, and perhaps\r\ndangerous to others. I repeat, in the name of common sense, that his\r\nmadness was the sole cause of his seclusion, not the effect of it, as\r\nsome would persuade us.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Neurdein Frères_\r\n\r\nLAURA DE' DIANTI AND ALFONSO OF FERRARA\r\n\r\n_After the Picture by Titian in the Louvre_]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough we have passed rapidly over those circumstances that impart\r\nto Tasso's life its romantic and mysterious interest, we must detail\r\nsomewhat more fully the various links connecting the thread of his\r\nchequered existence with the ducal house of Urbino. The arrival of\r\nhis father, Bernardo, at the court of Pesaro, in 1556, has been\r\nalready mentioned[185]; and six months later he was joined by\r\nTorquato, then completing his thirteenth year, who was permitted\r\nto share the education of the hereditary Prince, and to mingle\r\noccasionally with the accomplished circle at the Imperiale, until\r\nBernardo carried him to Venice, in 1559. On a mind of such premature\r\npowers these opportunities were not wasted, and the remembrance of\r\nthem cheered many an after hour of despondency. The homeless position\r\nand unsettled habits of his father, whose wanderings he generally\r\naccompanied, interfered somewhat with his education, which was then\r\ndirected to the law, as his future profession. But whilst supposed\r\nto be engrossed by canonists and civilians, the youth was secretly\r\ndevoting his hours of study to the muses. Fearing to avow these\r\nderelictions to his father, he imparted his boyish efforts to Duke\r\nGuidobaldo, who showed them to Bernardo in 1562, when the latter\r\ncame to offer him a printed copy of his _Amadigi_. It was not,\r\nhowever, for two years more that the paternal sanction was obtained\r\nfor publishing the _Rinaldo_, a dedication of which is said to have\r\nbeen declined by the Duke, perhaps from a fastidiousness which ere\r\nlong he had to regret. Encouraged by the unlooked-for success of\r\nthis poem, written by him in ten months at the university of Padua,\r\nTorquato began his great epic, of which he had already selected\r\nthe theme. Whilst pursuing his studies at Bologna, in 1563, he is\r\nbelieved to have transcribed the first sketch of it, under the title\r\nof \"_Il Gierusalem_,\" which is now No. 413 of the Urbino Library at\r\nthe Vatican. It is preceded by a short notice of the subject, and\r\nconsists of a hundred and sixteen stanzas, eventually incorporated\r\ninto the three opening cantos of the poem; but its variations from\r\nthe printed version are so extensive, that it has been given entire\r\nin the collected works, published at Venice, in twelve vols. 4to,\r\n1735. The dedication was this time accepted by Guidobaldo.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 185: At p. 303 above.]\r\n\r\nAt twenty-one, he first saw the court of Ferrara,[*186] which, in\r\nhonour of his marriage with the Archduchess Barbara, the magnificent\r\nAlfonso was then rendering\r\n\r\n     \"The revel of the earth, the masque of Italy.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote *186: On the Court of Ferrara, cf. CAMPORI e SOLERTI,\r\n_Luigi, Lucrezia e Leonora d'Este_ (Torino, 1888), and SOLERTI,\r\n_Ferrara e la Corte estense nella secunda meta del sec. XVI._ (Città\r\ndi Castello, 1899).]\r\n\r\nIt was in these festive scenes that the bard made acquaintance with\r\nthe Princess Lucrezia. Among the portraits in the Palace of Courtesy,\r\nwhither _Rinaldo_ was conducted, and which, by an ingenious turn of\r\nflattery, are made to represent those personages whom Tasso was most\r\ndisposed to conciliate, were those of Duke Guidobaldo and his son,\r\nwith their respective consorts. The passage may be thus literally\r\nrendered:--\r\n\r\n     \"He of expression stern and brow severe,\r\n       His mien ennobled by a royal state,\r\n     The great Francesco Maria's son, is here,\r\n       In peace superior, in the field his mate;\r\n     Beneath whose prudent sway, no peril ere\r\n       Urbino's favoured duchy shall await,\r\n     While o'er her happy vales, and golden plains,\r\n     A joyous and enduring summer reigns.\r\n\r\n     \"Such is the sire to whom our planet owes\r\n       Yon youthful gallant, with expression bright,\r\n     Second to none, a terror to his foes,\r\n       A wary leader though a dauntless knight:\r\n     On him the weight of thousand wars repose,\r\n       A thousand armies guiding to the fight.\r\n     Whoe'er is doomed to immortality\r\n     Shrined in men's hearts and mouths, HE may not die.\r\n\r\n     \"Turn your admiring gaze to yonder side\r\n       On all that heaven of loveliness can yield,\r\n     Elsewhere unmatched within Sol's circuit wide,\r\n       From whose bright beams no beauty lies concealed;\r\n     The ducal crown and robe can scarcely hide\r\n       The regal bearing on that brow revealed:\r\n     Vittoria she, from great Farnese traced,\r\n     Courteous and gentle, generous and chaste.\r\n\r\n     \"Lucrezia d'Este is yon other fair,\r\n       Whose dazzling tresses seem a treasure given\r\n     For guileless love therewith to weave a snare\r\n       And toils, purveyed by Him who rules in heaven.\r\n     Say, do Minerva and the Muses share\r\n       Praise and disparagement in portions even,--\r\n     Praise, since she them to imitate is fain;\r\n     Blame, that their rivalry with her is vain?\r\n\r\n     \"These dames, in charms and chastity compeers,\r\n       And proudly rich in every virtue rare\"--\r\n\r\nSuch compliments from a poet of promising fame could not be\r\nindifferent to one taught to prize genius as almost the equal of\r\nrank; nor were they the less acceptable to a lady of thirty-one,\r\nthat their author had barely attained manhood. She received him with\r\nher sweetest smile, and presented him to her father the Duke, and\r\nto her sister Leonora, in terms which secured him a most flattering\r\nreception. Love and chivalry were fashions of the day, cultivated\r\nin common by all who strove to shine in the brilliant atmosphere\r\nof Ferrara, and the genius of Torquato lent itself gracefully to\r\nboth. In many phases of Italian literature, it has been difficult\r\nfor posterity to decide whether the fervour of amorous poetry was\r\nkindled by successful passion, or fanned by affected sentiment. The\r\nlike mystery overhangs the love-notes which Tasso warbled in these\r\npalace-bowers. That his aspirations were not free from pedantry is\r\nproved by their, on one occasion, selecting the form of a public\r\ndisputation, after the most approved scholastic models, wherein,\r\nduring three days, he maintained against all comers, a series of\r\nabstract propositions regarding love and its developments. And though\r\nsuch singular exhibitions may sometimes have been suggested by\r\ndeeper feelings, or accepted as the incense of the heart, they were\r\ndoubtless in other cases but tournaments of gallantry, in which the\r\nname of some fair lady was adopted, to inspire the combatants to a\r\nvictory extending not beyond the lists. Equally platonic might have\r\nbeen such love-tissued lyrics as our minstrel ever and anon dedicated\r\nto the sister Princesses, without any scandal, and probably without\r\ncompromise of their purity. One of these, in supposed allusion to the\r\nfavoured sister, having been specially excepted from the sentence of\r\nposthumous destruction pronounced upon many of his fugitive pieces by\r\nthe poet when about to take a journey, must have ranked high in his\r\nestimation, and is thus translated by Glassford:--\r\n\r\n     \"Now that my charmer breathes another air\r\n       In woods and fields, how barbarous to remain\r\n       In this deserted place, where grief, and pain,\r\n       And darkness dwell, a region of despair!\r\n     Nothing is joyful here, and nothing fair:\r\n       Love grows a boor, and with the rustic train\r\n       Now feeds his flock, and now in sultry plain\r\n       Handles the scythe, or guides the pondrous share.\r\n     O, happy wood! O smiling banks and gay,\r\n       Where every beast, and every plant and stone,\r\n       Have learned the use of generous customs mild.\r\n     What shall not yield to her whose eyes alone\r\n       Can, as they lend or take their light away,\r\n       Polish the groves, and make the town a wild.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the four years which glided by in this charmed existence, the\r\nyouthful bard appears to have remained faithful to his first friend\r\nLucrezia; and it was not until her marriage to the Prince of Urbino\r\nin 1571, that the superior charms of her younger and more sedate\r\nsister effected for her that alleged conquest of his heart, which\r\nlong-continued assertions have almost established as a truth.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting could we fix the comparative encouragement\r\nwhich the bard enjoyed from the sisters, and ascertain the amount\r\nof favour severally vouchsafed him; on this much contested but\r\nconjectural ground we shall not, however, enter.[*187] Love-making,\r\nwhich is frequently a science rather than a passion, becomes\r\nalmost invariably so where its flame is habitually fed by poetry\r\nor pedantry, and such were naturally the loves of Tasso in the\r\natmosphere of a court whose polish was heightened by these\r\naccomplishments. The siren-notes of Italian song draw their melody\r\nfrom epithets calculated to soothe the ear even when they reach not\r\nthe heart, and seldom afford evidence as to which of these organs\r\nthey are meant to fascinate. This uncertainty gives life to a tribe\r\nof commentators, and has originated volumes of idle speculation as\r\nto the material existence of Laura and Beatrice, the platonic or\r\npassionate intercourse of Torquato with the Princesses of Este. The\r\nlanguage of sonnets and _canzoni_ is equally suited to express or to\r\nfeign, to indicate or to veil, heartfelt homage; and those of Tasso\r\nthus are capable of whatever interpretation best accords with the\r\ntemperament or the theory of his critics. Such, for example, are the\r\ntributes of his muse on the marriage of Lucrezia, wherein, however, a\r\nsuspicion of somewhat undue tenderness might attach to such lines as--\r\n\r\n     \"Sad as a mourning convoy seems to me\r\n     Your merry dances, and your Hymen's torch\r\n     Will to my funeral pile a flame supply.\"[188]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *187: Cf. D'OVIDIO, _Il carattere, gli amori e le sventure\r\ndi T.T._ in _Studi Critici_ (Napoli, 1879); see also CAMPORI e\r\nSOLERTI, _op. cit._, _supra_, p. 229, note *1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 188:\r\n\r\n     \"Liete danze vegg'io, che per me sono\r\n     Funebri pompe ed un istessa face\r\n     Nell'altrui nozze, e nel mio rogo è accesa.\"]\r\n\r\nIn a _canzone_ of the same date, he makes that god descend from\r\nParnassus to preside at her nuptials[189]; but the deity seems to\r\nhave turned a deaf ear to this tuneful invocation, and we have\r\nelsewhere seen that no favour of his crowned the inauspicious union.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 189: \"Lascia Imeneo Parnasso, e qui descende.\"]\r\n\r\nOn his return from France in 1572, Tasso was, by intercession of\r\nthe Princesses, received at Ferrara as a salaried courtier; and\r\nin the following spring, his pastoral drama, the _Aminta_,[*190]\r\nwas performed at the palace. Anxious to witness a representation\r\nelsewhere so universally applauded, the Princess of Urbino invited\r\nhim to Pesaro, where he recited his poem in presence of the old\r\nDuke, who hailed in him the honoured son of his former protégé.\r\nFrom thence he accompanied Francesco Maria and his consort to their\r\n_villeggiatura_ at Castel Durante, and it was then, perhaps,\r\nthat their domestic peace was most endangered by the poet. The\r\nfield-sports and manly exercises which attracted the Prince to\r\nthat secluded spot had no charm for Lucrezia, long accustomed to a\r\nlife of artificial splendour; and whilst he passed his days in the\r\nfar-spreading forests, she was exposed to the temptations of ennui,\r\nadded to the perils of opportunity. It is, therefore, not surprising\r\nthat a warmer tone pervades the _componimenti_ addressed to the\r\nPrincess in this retirement. Two sonnets, in particular, sing, in\r\ncadences of sweetest harmony, her hand imparting perfume to the\r\nscented glove, that enviously veiled, from her minstrel's greedy\r\neyes, a whiteness before which the snow would blush, and her bosom,\r\nthe garden of love, the paradise of the poet, its ripened charms\r\nsurpassing the budding beauties of early spring.[191]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *190: Cf. MAZZONI, preface to his edition of _Rinaldo e\r\nl'Aminta_ (Firenze, Sansoni, 1884).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 191: \"La man ch'avolta in odorate spoglie:\" and--\"Non son\r\nsì vaghi i fiori onde la natura.\"]\r\n\r\nTo write amatory verses on a lady of appearance as matronly as her\r\nyears, required singular tact; but Tasso boldly met the difficulties\r\nof his theme. In another sonnet, excelled by nothing in the whole\r\nrange of passionate song, after seeking for a parallel to her\r\n\"unripe\" youth in the opening rosebud, or in the unearthly beauty of\r\nthe early dawn, that gilds the mountains and scatters pearls along\r\nthe plain, he avows the flower to be most attractive when its leaves\r\nhave unfolded their odours, just as the mid-day sun outshines its\r\nmorning lustre. The same delicacy of allusion was needful in regard\r\nto both the princesses, of whom Leonora appears to have had the\r\nadvantage in looks more than in age, for she was but a year younger\r\nthan her married sister. We again avail ourselves of Mr. Glassford's\r\nparaphrase, in order to present it to such readers as are not\r\nacquainted with the charming original.\r\n\r\n     \"We saw thee in thy yet unripened green,\r\n       Like folded rose, whose damask leaf unspread\r\n       To the warm sun, still in its virgin bed\r\n       Retires and blushes in the bud unseen.\r\n     Or rather--for such earthly type is mean--\r\n       Like to Aurora, who with earthly red\r\n       Pearls the plain and gilds the mountain head,\r\n       Kindling with smiles the dewy sky serene.\r\n     Nor is thy riper year in aught less fair;\r\n       No youthful beauty in her choice attire\r\n       Can so engage, or equal charms display.\r\n     Thus sweetest is the flower when to the air\r\n       Unbosomed; thus the sun's meridian fire\r\n       Exceeds the lustre of its morning ray.\"\r\n\r\nBut these seductions did not divert Torquato from the loftier theme\r\nwhich engaged his muse. Far from the gaieties and the squabbles of\r\nFerrara, he drew a fresher inspiration from glorious nature, and\r\namong the delightful descriptions suggested by the scenery around\r\nCastel Durante are generally numbered those of the gardens of Armida.\r\nWhatever may have been the true footing on which the poet's devotion\r\nwas received by the Princess, and whatever the secret cause of her\r\ndomestic misunderstandings, her husband never showed, on this or\r\nany future occasion, jealousy of his early playmate; and in 1574\r\nTasso returned to Ferrara, laden with compliments and presents from\r\nthe august circle at Pesaro, including a jewel of price from the\r\nPrincess, which his necessities afterwards obliged him to dispose of.\r\n\r\nLucrezia had become Duchess of Urbino in 1574, and her separation\r\nfrom the Duke took place three years later, in circumstances of which\r\nwe have elsewhere spoken.[192] Released from ties in which affection\r\nhad never any part, she sought in her brother's palace distractions\r\nmore suited to her lively temperament, and renewed her intimacy with\r\nits silver-tongued laureate. Among the reasons which incline us to\r\nbelieve that this connection was chiefly sought upon her side, is\r\nthe desire which Tasso about this time manifested of exchanging the\r\nprotection of the d'Este for a residence at Rome. His intention was\r\nnot realised, for his visit to the Eternal City did not extend\r\nbeyond a month, and before the close of 1575 he was at Florence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 192: At pp. 153, 154 above.]\r\n\r\nOn returning to Ferrara in January, 1576, a new tie was created to\r\nthe reigning family, by his appointment as its historiographer, on\r\nthe death of Pigna. This was the turning point of his existence,\r\nwhence the symptoms of mental disease gradually and fatally advanced\r\nuntil June, 1577, when, after that outbreak of insanity in presence\r\nof the Duchess of Urbino, to which we have already alluded, he was\r\ninterdicted by Alfonso from corresponding with her. This command\r\nshe observed, but Leonora occasionally consoled him by letters\r\nduring his flight to Naples, of which we have spoken in tracing the\r\nprogress of his lipemania. It was in the autumn of 1578 that he\r\narrived at Pesaro, after his second flight; and, in this melodious\r\nbut unfinished _canzone_, bespoke shelter under the mighty oak [della\r\nRovere] watered by the Metauro:--\r\n\r\n     \"TO THE RIVER METAURO.\r\n\r\n     \"O thou illustrious child\r\n       Of mighty Apennine, humble though you lie,\r\n       In story brighter than thy silver tide;\r\n       O stranger fleet and wild,\r\n       To this thy friendly and protecting side,\r\n       Well pleased, for safety and repose I fly.\r\n       The lofty OAK, with mantling branches wide,\r\n       Bathed by thy stream, and from thy cisterns fed,\r\n       Shadowing the mountains and the seas between,--\r\n       Embower me with its screen!\r\n       Inviolate screen, and hospitably spread,\r\n       Thy cool recesses undisturbed and sweet\r\n       Shroud me in deepest covert, thick entwined,\r\n       So hid from blind and cruel fortune; blind,\r\n       But not for me, whom still she sees to meet,\r\n       Though far by hill or valley I should stray,\r\n       Or in the lonely way\r\n       Have passed at midnight, and with noiseless feet;\r\n       And by this bleeding side well understood,\r\n       Her aim unerring, as her shaft is good.\r\n\r\n     \"Since first I breathed this air,\r\n       Ah me! since first I met the glorious light,\r\n       Which never to these eyes unclouded shone,\r\n       I was her fatal care,\r\n       Chosen to be her mark and her despite;\r\n       Nor yet those early hurts by time outgrown.\r\n       Well to that spirit pure my words are known,\r\n       Beside whose sainted tomb my cradle stood.\r\n       Might they have laid me in the peaceful ground\r\n       When I received the wound!\r\n       Me from my mother's bosom fortune rude\r\n       Tore while a child: O yet I feel those last\r\n       Kisses and burning tears upon my cheek,\r\n       With sighs remembered; still I hear that weak\r\n       And ardent prayer, caught by the rising blast,\r\n       Then parted ever; no more face to face\r\n       Folded in strict embrace\r\n       And held by close and loving arms so fast,\r\n       Ah! but like Ilus or Camilla hied,\r\n       With steps unequal, by my father's side.\r\n\r\n     \"In banishment I grew\r\n       And rigid want, instructed by our strange\r\n       Disastrous flight to shed untimely tears,\r\n       Nor childhood's pleasure knew;\r\n       But bitterness to me of chance and change\r\n       Brought immature the bitterness of years.\r\n       Despoiled and bare, his feeble age appears\r\n       Before me still. Alas! and is my store\r\n       Of griefs become so scanty, that my own\r\n       Are not enough to moan?\r\n       That others than myself I must deplore?\r\n       But seldom, though I bid, will come the sigh,\r\n       Or from these wells the gushing water spring,\r\n       In measure suited to my suffering.\r\n       Dear father; now my witness from the sky,\r\n       Whom sick thou knowest how I moaned, and dead\r\n       Poured on thy grave and bed\r\n       My ardent heart; thee, in thy mansions high\r\n       All bliss beseems, and unalloyed with pain;\r\n       Only for me the sighs and tears remain.\"[193]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 193: GLASSFORD, p. 203.]\r\n\r\nThe morbid feeling and heart-stricken melancholy which, in the\r\nlanguage of Gibbon, \"disordered his reason without clouding his\r\ngenius,\" and which thus exaggerated the trials of his early life,\r\ngave way to another train of thought in the following letter,\r\naddressed by him, about the same time, to Duke Francesco Maria, which\r\nwe insert as the most satisfactory record left us of the friendship\r\nand protection bestowed on him by that Prince.\r\n\r\n     \"TASSO TO THE DUKE OF URBINO.\r\n\r\n     \"If any action of mine has tended to confirm the rumour\r\n     of my insanity, it surely was my directing my steps after\r\n     my flight otherwise than to the court of your Excellency.\r\n     For certainly I could not have repaired elsewhere without\r\n     some degree of danger, or at all events some indignity\r\n     and inconvenience; nor could I hope to find in any other\r\n     quarter more acquaintance with my real position, nor\r\n     greater courtesy, knowing no prince more generous, more\r\n     efficiently compassionate to my misfortunes, or more\r\n     prompt in the protection of my innocence. Hence, to pass\r\n     by an asylum near and secure, as well as suitable and\r\n     honourable, in order to make my way, without comfort, or,\r\n     at all events, with little credit, to a distant and less\r\n     safe place, was, if not a sign of folly, at least a proof\r\n     of impudence and stupidity. Notwithstanding all this,\r\n     unlike other men who blush and repent when made aware of\r\n     a blunder, I derive from my ill advised step pleasure\r\n     and comfort rather than shame and regret, because, being\r\n     conducted, not where I desired, but whither I ought to\r\n     go, and having there found the haven which I had supposed\r\n     far off, across the high seas, I clearly perceive that my\r\n     steps have been guided by wisdom from on high. And it must\r\n     be much more pleasing to me to have been brought hither\r\n     by divine Providence than by human prudence, seeing how\r\n     much the more infallible guide is the latter to the best\r\n     appointed end. And although, had I come here in reliance\r\n     on being received under your Excellency's protection, it\r\n     would have afforded me much satisfaction to find my hopes\r\n     realised, and your courtesy equal to my anticipations;\r\n     yet my gratification is certainly, and beyond comparison,\r\n     greater, seeing that you have not only anticipated, but\r\n     overmatched, my desires, and that you have at once equalled\r\n     and exceeded my expectations. I say exceeded them, because\r\n     upon the obliging demonstrations of affection and pity\r\n     which you have shown me, and on your promise to undertake\r\n     my protection, I found rather an assurance than a hope of\r\n     safety, peace, and honour. Enough, indeed more than enough,\r\n     for me, is that which you have promised. Were I to doubt\r\n     as to the rest, or look forward with such every-day hope\r\n     as one is apt to entertain regarding uncertain prospects,\r\n     I should discredit your Excellency's affection, judgment,\r\n     authority, and power, and I should prove myself unworthy,\r\n     not only of what you are about to perform, but of what you\r\n     have already done in my favour. Thus, be assured that I\r\n     live not only securely, but happily, under your protection.\r\n     On this account my regrets are less at being so fiercely\r\n     and iniquitously buffeted and beaten down by fortune, than\r\n     is my satisfaction at being raised again by the arm of your\r\n     Excellency; and were there no other way to lead me to you,\r\n     and to place me in the shadow of your favour, but this most\r\n     hard and rugged one, with its toils and persecutions, still\r\n     I should delight to arrive by it; and I account as not only\r\n     endurable, but as joyful and well-timed, those pangs which\r\n     brought me to be yours, as it was ever my wish to be, even\r\n     in my days of less adversity. It is for this reason I dare\r\n     to appropriate these famous words of Themistocles, 'I were\r\n     undone, did I not rush upon my ruin.'\r\n\r\n     \"I shall now pass by the long and melancholy tale of\r\n     my wrongs as indeed superfluous, since the little that\r\n     your Excellency has heard of my mishaps has sufficed to\r\n     move your magnanimous heart to extend me aid. Nor shall\r\n     I try to awaken in your soul any compassion beyond what\r\n     it voluntarily fostered, without artifice of mine; for I\r\n     rejoice that in this noble and courteous act my exertions\r\n     have no part, all being your own, and springing from the\r\n     greatness and compassion of your individual mind. Most\r\n     gladly should I thank your Excellency for what you have\r\n     done, and will do, in my behalf, could I invent words and\r\n     terms fit for such thanks; but what can I, or what should\r\n     I say to you? To you I neither can nor ought to use such\r\n     phrases as servants employ to their masters, benefited\r\n     to their benefactors, favoured to those who confer\r\n     obligations, because, as my misery was incomparable and\r\n     unprecedented, so it would become me to invent expressions\r\n     signifying how much I owe to your Excellency who rescues\r\n     me from it. I shall, therefore, say, that since, thanks\r\n     to you, I emerge from a condition so low, so disgraced,\r\n     so wretched, and so reduced in reputation and in the\r\n     opinion of mankind, who looked upon me as virtually\r\n     dead, I seem to have received a new health from you, by\r\n     reason whereof I acknowledge your Excellency, not only as\r\n     a prince and benefactor to whom I owe much, but it may\r\n     almost be permitted me to add, as a creator, and I seem\r\n     to say but little in avowing myself your most obliged and\r\n     highly favoured servant, if I add not _creature_.[194]\r\n     Such, accordingly, I shall formally avow myself, and in\r\n     that light I pray you for the future to regard me, and\r\n     to contrive that I am regarded by others, taking entire\r\n     possession of me and of my free will, which I fully submit\r\n     to your sway. And this I should do with all my affairs,\r\n     were it in my power; but some of them are not at my own\r\n     disposal, or they should be placed at that of him to whom I\r\n     have surrendered myself. And herewith humbly I kiss your\r\n     hands, assuring you that these words have been engraven by\r\n     me on my heart, ere they were traced upon this sheet.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 194: The letter is taken from an old transcript, No. 430,\r\nof the Oliveriana MSS., p. 210, but it has been printed at vol. IX.,\r\np. 104, of the Venetian edition of Tasso's works.]\r\n\r\nThe expectations which dictated this touching letter were amply\r\nrealised. After a reception of singular kindness, the good Duke\r\nrecommended medical advice for Tasso's now obvious malady; and an\r\nissue prescribed for his arm was dressed by the Princess Lavinia\r\ndella Rovere, whose sedulous care was rewarded in a madrigal. By such\r\nsolace his restlessness, however, prevented him from long profiting.\r\nAfter reaching Ferrara some months later, his mania broke out in\r\nmore threatening symptoms, and, on the 21st February, 1579, he was\r\nconsigned to the hospital of Sant'Anna.\r\n\r\nFrom the sadder scenes and secrets of his life it were useless to\r\nraise the veil. Even the year after he entered it, Montaigne, a\r\nshrewd and unbiased witness, whose testimony may countervail much\r\nhearsay and conjecture, found him in \"most pitiable state, surviving\r\nhimself, neglectful of his person and works.\" Seven years had worn\r\naway in pitiable isolation, when a violent fever nearly closed his\r\ndarkened existence, after which, whether from an abatement of his\r\nphrenetic symptoms, or in the hope of contributing to his physical\r\nrestoration, Alfonso sanctioned his liberation, at the request of\r\nPrince Vincenzo of Mantua, the supposed assassin of our Admirable\r\nCrichton, who undertook the watchful care which his case required.\r\nPrincess Leonora died in 1581, and, on various subsequent occasions,\r\nDuchess Lucrezia interfered with little success in his behalf, but,\r\nfrom the time of his leaving the hospital, his intercourse with her\r\nfamily was at an end. He had written from thence several letters to\r\nthe Duke of Urbino, and, after his convalescence, addressed to him a\r\nrambling discourse on his real and imaginary grievances, which shows\r\na mind still shaken, if not unhinged. But, though the kind feelings\r\nof his early playmate underwent no change, Tasso returned not to\r\nUrbino during many after wanderings, fearing perhaps to revisit, in\r\ncircumstances so altered, the scenes of his brighter days.[195] The\r\nnine remaining years of his life were, on the whole, less afflicted;\r\nfor, though ever restless in body, and often haunted by imaginary\r\nevils and visions, he enjoyed intervals of comparative serenity,\r\nespecially in his beloved Bay of Naples, and at the house of his kind\r\nfriend and biographer Manso, of which, half a century later, John\r\nMilton was the honoured guest.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 195: With that constitutional coldness we have seen in his\r\nlife, the Duke spares but one line of his Diary to notice Torquato's\r\ndeath.]\r\n\r\nHis death partook of the melancholy shade that had overhung his\r\ncareer. Declining a new invitation from Duke Francesco Maria, in\r\n1594, he brought to Rome all that mental and bodily sufferings had\r\nleft him of broken health and blighted genius, to receive the honours\r\nof a laurel crown; and, in the monastery of S. Onofrio, he awaited\r\nthe issue of arrangements which the warning voice of exhausted\r\nnature told him were made in vain. From thence he addressed to his\r\nfriend Constantini[*196] the following touching farewell:--\"What\r\nshall my Antonio say, when he hears the death of his Tasso? Nor, in\r\nmy opinion, will the news be long delayed; for I feel my end to be\r\nat hand, having found no remedy for this troublesome malady, which,\r\nadded to my many habitual ailments, is evidently sweeping me away\r\nlike an impetuous and irresistible torrent. To say nothing of the\r\nworld's ingratitude, which would prove its triumph by consigning\r\nme in penury to the tomb, the time is now past for speaking of my\r\ninveterate fortune; yet, when I think of the glory which this age\r\nwill derive from my writings, in despite of all opposition, I cannot\r\nbe left entirely unrequited. I have had myself brought to this\r\nconvent of S. Onofrio, not only because the air is commended by the\r\nfaculty more than that of any other part of Rome, but also, to begin\r\nas it were from this elevated spot, and in the conversation of these\r\nholy fathers, my celestial intercourse. Pray to God in my behalf, and\r\nrest assured that, as I have ever loved and respected you in this\r\nlife, I shall do the like towards you in a better, as is the part of\r\ntrue and unfeigned affection; and to the Divine grace I commend you\r\nand myself. From Rome, at S. Onofrio.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote *196: Cf. D'ANCONA, _T.T. ed Ant. Costantini_ in _Varietà\r\nStoriche e Letter._ (Milano, 1883), vol. I., p. 75 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nTasso's mind was habitually under devotional influences, which\r\ngrew upon him as he experienced the delusive results of his early\r\nambition, the emptiness of success, and the bitterness of failure.\r\nReligion was in him a deeply rooted sentiment; it soothed long hours\r\nof suffering, cheered the decline of life, and brightened those\r\nhopes for which the laurel crown had lost its charm. Gazing from\r\nthe convent garden over a scene of all others the most inspiring to\r\nthe poet, the most solemn to the moralist, he caught the seeds of\r\nmalaria fever. His springs of life were already dried up by twenty\r\nlong years of suffering, and, after a few days of peaceful and\r\nresigned preparation for a change that to him had no terrors, his\r\nspirit was released from its shattered tenement. He died on the 25th\r\nApril, 1595, wept by many warmly attached and pitying friends, and\r\nlamented by the citizens, who lost in his death the spectacle of his\r\ncoronation, to which they had long looked forward with an anxiety\r\nunusual even among the fête-loving populace of Rome.\r\n\r\nTasso's was a life of painful contrasts and of blighted hopes. The\r\nprospects of his childhood, bright as the sky which witnessed his\r\nbirth, were quickly shadowed by a storm of tropical violence. The\r\ncourtly favour that met his manhood proved baneful as a siren's\r\nsmiles. The greenest garland that Italy could offer to her favourite\r\nminstrel was reserved until his brow was clammy with the dews of\r\ndeath. The honours lavished on his funeral have been grudged to\r\nhis tomb. His resplendent genius was linked to the saddest and most\r\nhumbling of human afflictions. The fame for which he felt more than\r\na poet's thirst, and which he challenged as his due, was withheld\r\nby envy until no trumpet-note could reach his dull cold ear. But\r\ntime, the avenger, has rendered him tardy justice, and Torquato is\r\nthe popular bard of Italy, whilst the cumbrous pedantry of his della\r\nCrusca impugners is consigned to contemptuous oblivion.\r\n\r\nOf works so universally known as those of Tasso it would be\r\npresumptuous to offer new analyses, and superfluous to encumber our\r\npages with trite criticism. The edition of them by Rosini extends\r\nto thirty quarto volumes, a startling testimony to the copiousness\r\nof his commentators, as well as to his own wonderful fertility. His\r\npen ranged over a wide field both in prose and verse,--the former\r\nincluding essays--moral, literary, and political,--dialogues, and\r\nletters; the latter touching upon themes sacred, heroic, romantic,\r\nsylvan, pastoral, and lyric. It is, however, as an epic poet that he\r\nhas gained a niche in Parnassus, and the admiration of posterity. No\r\nrivalry could arise with Dante, in whose Vision the things of time\r\nare strangely interwoven with revelations of eternity; and his muse\r\nis of a nobler caste, though less touching character, than that of\r\nthe bard of Arqua. But it is otherwise with the fourth great name of\r\nItalian minstrelsy, and no one discusses the merits of Tasso without\r\nkeeping those of Ariosto in view. This, however, arises from habit\r\nrather than necessity. The latter name was dragged forward by the\r\ndella Crusca Academicians as a stalking-horse to mask the malice\r\nof their attacks upon the later of Ferrara's two laureates, whose\r\nsuccessive appearance on that stage alone induced a contrast for\r\nwhich their respective works were by no means adapted. The comparison\r\nthus forced upon the world has been declined by Tiraboschi, who,\r\nin the exercise of a sounder criticism, has assigned to each\r\nhis peculiar excellence. Bearing in mind that the Orlando is\r\nintrinsically a romantic poem, whilst the Jerusalem is composed upon\r\nthe epic model, there can be but little technical analogy between\r\nthem, and the beauties of the one would become blemishes in the\r\nother. The striking and unlooked-for episodes of the former, running\r\never into extravagance and burlesque, must have outraged the grave\r\nunities required in the latter, and have proved more serious faults\r\nthan any which the jaundiced optics of the academicians were able\r\nto discover. But perhaps Tasso's greatest triumph over his jealous\r\ndetractors has been the continued preference of his earlier and\r\ngreater work to his continuation of the same theme, in which he\r\nstudied to profit by their criticisms. Many Italians, among whom the\r\nromantic school took its origin and maintained its influence, have\r\npreferred Ariosto, whilst transalpine critics have more generally\r\ngiven their suffrages to the poem of Tasso, as more regular in its\r\nplan, and better preserving the elevation and the unities observed by\r\nthe best classic models.\r\n\r\nIt has been the boast of some minstrels to mould the temper of the\r\nage to the tone of their poetry. Tasso chose a less hazardous aim,\r\nand, seizing in his great epic upon a theme at once the most fertile\r\nand the most popular, gained the sympathies of all. The Crescent,\r\nonce more in the ascendant, had swept the Mediterranean, overrun\r\nGreece, and threatened Vienna. The spirit of the crusades revived.\r\nThe often-mooted movement of all Christendom in the holy cause was\r\nat length carried into effect, and victory crowned the Cross at the\r\ngreat naval conflict of Lepanto. But alas! his was the last great\r\nname in Italian poetry;[*197] and thenceforward genius fled from\r\nthe land of song, or bowed unresisting before an all-prevailing\r\nmediocrity. Morbid repetition, redundant verbiage, far-fetched\r\nfigures,--all those faults for which its liquid language afforded\r\nsuch fatal facilities, sprang up in rank deformity, and smothered\r\ngenerous inspiration. The academies sent out their many songsters,\r\nwho poured forth notes artfully sweet, but rarely thrilling; and\r\nalready\r\n\r\n     \"Their once-loved minstrels scarce may claim\r\n     The transient mention of a dubious name.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote *197: This, of course, is nonsense. Leopardi, at any rate,\r\nwas yet to come, and in our own day we have heard the eager and noble\r\nvoice of Carducci in verse that, it might seem, is not less great\r\nthan Tasso's and far more in touch with life.]\r\n\r\nNor did they merit a better fate; for their conceptions were\r\nextravagant, their imagery redundant, their execution alternately\r\nglaring and languid. Unnatural contrasts, startling conceits, ill\r\ncompensated in them for vigorous diction and the stamp of genius. Yet\r\nthe lyric muse was not utterly extinct, and from time to time its\r\nwarblings may yet be heard in the orange groves and laurel bosquets\r\nof that bright land.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGuarini's is another name shared between Ferrara and Urbino.[*198] He\r\nwas born at the former city in 1537, of a family already possessing\r\nclaims upon literary distinction during three generations, his\r\ngreat-grandfather having been Guarini of Verona. In conformity\r\nwith the custom of employing men of learning upon diplomatic\r\nmissions, he served Duke Alfonso II. at various courts, until, in\r\n1575, he undeservedly lost his favour by the failure of a quixotic\r\nnegotiation, having for its object to place the crown of Poland upon\r\nhis brows. During the seclusion which followed, he wrote the _Pastor\r\nFido_, a pastoral drama of more complex incident than had been\r\nhitherto produced, and whose refined polish and seductive strains,\r\nthough misapplied upon a factitious style, long retained their\r\npopularity. It was composed in avowed emulation of Tasso's _Aminta_,\r\nand he carried the rivalry into ducal saloons, and even ladies'\r\nboudoirs, with the results naturally to be looked for among the\r\npeppery tribe of poets. But when Torquato's hour of darkness arrived,\r\nGuarini proved himself a generous opponent, and, in the edition of\r\n1581, he did his utmost to rescue the cantos of _Gerusalemme_ from\r\nthe adulteration of unfriendly pens. When his country's subjugation\r\nhad followed upon his patron's death, he was fain to seek other\r\nservice with the Medici; and soon thereafter the Duke of Urbino wrote\r\nto Abbé Brunetti, his envoy at Venice, in the following terms: \"We\r\nshall with much pleasure look over the pastoral which the Cavaliere\r\nGuarino has reprinted with notes and engravings, for we greatly\r\nesteem his meritorious works, and are aware how much we are indebted\r\nto his affection and courtesy. You will therefore thank him in our\r\nname for his remembrance of us.\"[199] This presentation copy procured\r\nthe author a substantial reward in the following letter to Brunetti,\r\ndated some weeks later.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *198: For Guarini, consult ROSSI, _B. Guarini ed il Pastor\r\nFido_ (Torino, 1886). See also CAMPORI, in _Giorn. St. d. Lett.\r\nItal._, vol. VIII., p. 425, etc.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 199: Oliveriana MSS. 375, vol. XV. 104. The poem was his\r\n_Pastor Fido_, of which the twentieth edition, with the author's\r\nnote, appeared at Venice in 1602.]\r\n\r\n     \"Most magnificent and most reverend,\r\n\r\n     \"In consequence of deaths and other circumstances, we find\r\n     ourselves so ill provided with persons of such quality\r\n     as was Albergato, that we must find some one as soon as\r\n     may be. And recollecting the Cavaliere Guarino, who was\r\n     known and entertained by us many years ago, we should be\r\n     well pleased could we have him, provided his health be\r\n     equal to his duties, not indeed for long journeys, but for\r\n     attending upon our person, and accompanying us both in the\r\n     carriage and on horseback, advising and conversing with us\r\n     in all times and occasions. And we believe, if due means\r\n     be adopted, this affair might be arranged to our mutual\r\n     satisfaction, as we remember that, when lately quitting\r\n     Tuscany, he seemed, from what he wrote to us, not averse to\r\n     the idea of betaking himself hither, and in our answer we\r\n     in no way discouraged the plan. We have, however, chosen\r\n     to impart the matter to you, that you may manage it in\r\n     whatever way you consider most proper for appearances; and\r\n     should you think it well, we have no objection to your\r\n     even going in person to Padua, on some other pretext. As\r\n     to terms, we believe that the Cavaliere's modesty, and our\r\n     partiality towards him, would readily bring everything\r\n     to an issue; but you will give it all due consideration,\r\n     answering separately this our letter, with whatever occurs\r\n     to you on the subject.

That brief span, scarcely a\r\ngeneration of human life, not only embraced the entire artistic life\r\nof Raffaele and witnessed the finest efforts of Leonardo, Luini,\r\nBellini, Giorgione, Francia, Ghirlandaio, Fra Bartolomeo, Sodoma,\r\nPerugino, Pinturicchio, Spagna, and Salerno; it also ripened the\r\nearlier and better fruits of Buonarroti's genius, of del Sarto's too\r\nquickly degenerate palette, and of Titian's\r\n\r\n     \"Pencil pregnant with celestial hues.\"\r\n\r\nIt saw the metropolitan St. Peter's commenced, the Stanze and Logge\r\nwell advanced; it assembled in the Vatican halls the noblest band\r\nof painters ever united by one scholarship. That bright spot, the\r\nPausilippo of our pictorial journey, has been passed. Our onward way\r\nlies through dreary days of progressive degeneracy, often fitfully\r\nilluminated by its reflected lights, but more rarely gladdened by\r\ngleams of original genius, or efforts of self-forgetting zeal.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the history of painting, its stages of progress will\r\nbe readily distinguished. The Byzantine period may be regarded as\r\nits starting point of stationary conventionalism.[*200] This was\r\nfollowed by an age of sentiment, when earnest thought gradually\r\nameliorated penury of invention, and supplied intensity to\r\nexpression. To it succeeded an epoch of effort, the hand failing\r\nto realise the aims of mind,[*201] the eye awaking to truths of\r\nnature, but bewildered by their hidden meanings. Next came the age\r\nof mastery;[*202] one of difficulties surmounted and doubts made\r\nclear. But the summit when attained was speedily quitted; the period\r\nof facility was too soon one of decline. In the words of Fuseli,\r\npainters then \"uniformly agreed to lose the subject in the medium.\"\r\nMechanism became the great object, copiousness a prized merit, until\r\nmediocrity sought refuge in a multitude of figures, or fell back upon\r\ntheatrical artifice. The close of the fifteenth century was indeed a\r\ncycle of rapid progression, opening many new channels for the efforts\r\nof mind, and it was in Italy that this expansion was primarily\r\nfelt. The ultramontane invention of printing was then eagerly\r\nadopted; the cultivation of revived philosophy, and the convulsions\r\nconsequent upon foreign inroads, introduced elements of change into\r\nthe Peninsular mind as well as its politics. In nothing was this\r\nmovement more felt than in the fine arts. During early times, the\r\nideas of artists exceeded their means of expression.[*203] Yet their\r\nworks, even when trammelled by fetters, partly of limited skill, but\r\nmore of traditionary mannerism, are often fit exponents of simple\r\nthoughts, while the coincidence between the conception and style\r\nrenders solecisms of execution less startling. The forms may be timid\r\nor stiff, but they are always careful and earnest. But now a further\r\nrange has been given to individual fancy. The choice and conception\r\nof the theme, its character and composition, were alike freed from\r\nconventional trammels, and became subjective (in the German sense)\r\nrather than objective. Religion and its ritual remained the same,\r\nthe hero-worship of saints continued among its prominent features,\r\nart still furnished aids to devotion. But, as books became abundant\r\nand readers multiplied, pictures were no longer the written language\r\nof holy things for the multitude. The high mission of Christian art\r\nhad been fulfilled; its limners, less impressed with their themes,\r\nthought more of themselves; they appealed rather to the judgment\r\nthan to the feelings. They aimed at imitating nature to the life\r\nmore than at embodying transcendental abstractions.[*204] We have\r\nalready seen how the devotional inspirations of early painting, which\r\nBeato Angelico's pencil had mellowed into loveliness, attained,\r\nunder the guidance of Raffaele, to consummate beauty of form.\r\nBut the impulse that had forced pictorial art to its culminating\r\npoint allowed it no rest, and the descending path was too quickly\r\nentered. The speculative minds of its creators and its admirers\r\ncraved for novelty, for fresh themes and further powers. Elevation\r\nof sentiment or purity of design no longer sufficed,[*205] and with\r\nthe competition which ensued for the guidance of public taste, there\r\nsprang up many solecisms to degrade it. Much that was in itself\r\nvaluable was exaggerated into deformity. The knowledge of anatomy\r\nwhich enabled Michael Angelo to embody the terrible, that element of\r\ninvention which he was the first fully to develop, also tempted him\r\nto combinations outraging nature and harmony;[*206] and his style has\r\ntransmitted to our own day an influence dangerous to genius,[*207]\r\nfatal to mediocrity. Less permanent, because less healthful,[*208]\r\nwas the opposite quality, introduced by Correggio, whose grace,\r\nfounded upon artifice, degenerated under Parmegianino and Baroccio\r\ninto meretricious affectation. A third ingredient, not so perilous\r\nand more pleasing, was brought to perfection in Venice, where alone\r\ncan be appreciated the golden tints of Titian[*209] and the silvery\r\nharmony of Veronese. It is indeed remarkable that all the schools\r\nmost celebrated for colouring have arisen in maritime localities, and\r\nbeen deficient in accurate design.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *200: I do not understand what this means. The \"Byzantine\r\nperiod\" was not the starting point of anything, but rather a\r\ndecadence; and how can anything be the starting point of something\r\n\"stationary\"? Christian art comes to us in the first centuries as\r\nabsolutely dependent on Roman pagan work. It did not contrive a\r\nnew force of expression, but very happily used the old. For the\r\nhistory of art is continuous, and in Byzantine work we see merely a\r\ndecadence, not something new. The Renaissance in painting is based\r\non Roman art of pagan times in the work of the Cosmati and the\r\nCavallini, from whom in all probability Giotto learned all he could\r\nlearn. It is the same with sculpture. Niccolò Pisano is a pupil of\r\nthe ancients, a native of Apulia. The northern influence came later.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *201: Yes? In Duccio's work, for instance. But the hand\r\nof man cannot achieve anything finer than the work of these early\r\nmen--than the Annunciation of Simone Martini, for instance. That they\r\npreferred a decorative convention to a realistic does not accuse them\r\nof incompetence. Dennistoun would have said that the Japanese could\r\nnot draw. It was not that \"the hand failed to realise the aims of\r\nthe mind,\" but that the mind saw things from a standpoint different\r\nfrom ours. It is easy to talk of the \"truths of nature.\" What are\r\nthe truths of nature? It is a question of appearance, of a manner of\r\nseeing, of an attitude of mind, of soul, toward nature and toward\r\nitself. Simone Martini was as great an artist, in the true sense of\r\nthe word, as Raphael, in his own convention. Raphael's convention is\r\nstill ours, but we are already passing out of it. Is it not so?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *202: Yes; an age of realism. It is as though one preferred\r\na Roman work of the best period to a Greek work of the fifth century\r\nB.C. What came was the tyranny of the body, without the\r\nold excuse, for we no longer believed in the body; we no longer\r\nbelieved in anything but unreality. It is not that the earlier men\r\nwere \"right\" and the later \"wrong,\" but that both are equally right\r\nand wrong where right and wrong do not count since only beauty may\r\ndecide. Dennistoun speaks as he does because he could not possibly\r\nhave spoken otherwise. He is wrong not so much in what he asserts as\r\nin what he denies.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *203: Here, again, I do not understand. How can an\r\nartist's ideas exceed his means of expression?--I do not say his\r\npower of expression. What means of expression did Dante lack that\r\nMilton enjoyed, or Sophocles? In what was Donatello poorer than\r\nMichelangelo or Niccolò Pisano than either? Giotto had the same means\r\nof expression as Apelles or Leonardo, for the work he undertook, and\r\nbefore a new means of expression was invented, he could not have\r\nconceived the use of it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *204: Their aim was perhaps rather the realistic imitation\r\nof life than the expression of it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *205: They never sufficed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *206: Too strong. Michelangelo was always master of the\r\nweapons he used, however destructive they may have been to his\r\ndisciples.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *207: Nothing is dangerous to genius, not even mediocrity.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *208: This term applies to the science of medicine, not to\r\næsthetic.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *209: Titian can be seen to advantage only in Madrid,\r\nParis, Vienna, or London. In Venice he is almost absent.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anderson_\r\n\r\nMARTYRDOM OF S. AGATA\r\n\r\n_After a picture by Seb. dal Piombo, once in the Ducal Collection at\r\nUrbino, now in the Pitti Gallery, Florence_]\r\n\r\nIn a preceding portion of this work we have alluded to the\r\ninnovations of naturalism in painting, by men who introduced\r\nperspective, created chiaroscuro, cultivated design, and mastered\r\nnude action. Through their example, it not only extended a\r\npredominating influence over pictorial treatment, but quickly\r\nobtained that place as a canon of artistic criticism which it has\r\nsince continued commonly to hold. It may seem rash to impugn a\r\nprinciple so universally adopted; and if perfection in art really\r\ndepends upon an accurate imitation of nature, it would be folly to\r\ngainsay it. But the principle may be carried too far; and if we are\r\nto allow to art a nobler mission,--if we recognise in painting and\r\nsculpture a language wherein gifted men can embody, develop, and\r\nelaborately adorn the conceptions of beauty and sublimity, or it may\r\nbe the sallies of humour and the scintillations of wit that flit\r\nacross the fancy--a key whereby they can impart to their fellows,\r\nand transmit to all ages and nations, their emanations of genius,\r\ntheir poetic flashes, their benevolent sympathies, their devotional\r\naspirations,--then surely a higher standard should be applied to what\r\nare often ranked as merely imitative arts, and are tested by their\r\nsupposed fidelity as transcripts of external objects.[*210]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *210: After all, Dennistoun is on the side of the\r\nangels--though a little unctuously.]\r\n\r\nSuch views will to many seem visionary and strange heresies. Yet they\r\nare truths by which painting reached its golden era, and which, even\r\nin its decline, have been largely drawn upon. Under Louis XIV., a\r\nvile epoch of a faulty school,[*211] allegory triumphed over reality,\r\nand the best feelings of humanity were forced into masquerade. But\r\nwhat shall we think of the taste which admits such solecisms against\r\nnature, whilst objecting to the conventionalities practised by the\r\nearly Christian masters, and adopted by the purists of our own\r\nday? What, indeed, is art but a tissue of conventionalities, even\r\nwhen the imitation of external objects is its aim? Upon what laws\r\nof nature are regulated the gradations of aerial perspective, or\r\nthe receding or flattened surfaces of basso-relievo? Does not the\r\nlandscape painter, in modifying the tones of his colouring, remember\r\nthat his mimic scenes are to be enclosed in gilt frames, an appendage\r\nfor which Providence has made no provision in the real ones? But\r\nto such imitations art neither is nor ought to be confined. As the\r\nlanguage of genius, it expresses loftier themes, and none but kindred\r\nspirits can fitly judge of its style, or set bounds to its range.\r\nThe rustic who spells through Burns or Bloomfield would pause upon\r\nParadise Lost, and throw down Hamlet in despair; whilst, to the\r\npresbyterian who ornaments his walls with Knox's portrait, or the\r\nBattle of Bothwell-brig, the Last Judgment would seem unintelligible,\r\nthe Transfiguration blasphemous, the Judgment of Paris a flagrant\r\nindecency. In like manner, those who have neither imbibed the spirit\r\nof the Roman ritual, nor studied the forms of Christian art, may\r\nfully appreciate the dishevelled goddesses of Rubens, or the golden\r\nsunsets of Claude,--the glowing tints of Titian, or the transparent\r\nfinish of Teniers; but let them understand ere they sneer at those\r\nsacred paintings which for successive ages have confirmed the faith\r\nof the unlettered, elevated their hopes, and inspired their prayerful\r\nejaculations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *211: One of the sad days. Cf. vol. II., p. 95, note *1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nHOLY FAMILY\r\n\r\n_After the picture by Sustermans, once in the Ducal Collection of\r\nUrbino, now in the Pitti Gallery, Florence_]\r\n\r\nWhen the Christian mythology, which had supplied art with subjects\r\nderived from inspired writ or venerated tradition, was supplanted\r\nby an idolatry of nature content to feed spiritual longings with\r\ncommon forms copied without due selection from daily life, men no\r\nlonger painted what religion taught them to believe, but what their\r\nsenses offered for imitation, modified by their own unrestrained\r\nfancies. Painting thus became an accessory of luxurious life, and\r\nits productions were regarded somewhat as furniture, indicating\r\nthe taste rather than the devotion of patrons and artists. These\r\naccordingly followed a wider latitude of topics and treatment. In\r\nproportion as devotional subjects fell out of use, a demand\r\narose for mythological fable and allegory. Profane history,\r\nindividual adventure or portraiture, supplied matter pleasing to\r\nvanity, profitable to adulation. But while the objects of painting\r\nbecame less elevated, its mechanism gained importance; it became\r\nostentatious in sentiment, ambitious in execution. The aim of\r\nprofessors, the standard of connoisseurs, declined from the ideal\r\nto the palpable. A fresh field for exertion was thus opened up.\r\nSchools attained celebrity from their successful treatment of\r\ntechnical difficulties. Michael Angelo attracted pupils by his\r\npower in design; Titian by his mastery in colour; Correggio by his\r\nmanagement of light; while the eclectic masters of Bologna vainly\r\naspired to perfection by nicely adjusting their borrowed plumes;\r\nand the _tenebristi_ of Naples sought, by impenetrable shadows, to\r\nstartle rather than to please. A demand for domestic decoration led\r\nto further exercise of ingenuity. Landscapes, first improved by the\r\nVenetian masters as accessories, became a new province of art; and\r\ntranscripts from nature in her scenes of beauty were succeeded by\r\nthe clang of battles, the inanities of still life, the orgies or\r\ncrimes of worthless men.[*212] In architecture and in sculpture,\r\nthe departure was scarcely less remarkable from the pure style and\r\nsimple forms of the fifteenth century: a free introduction of costly\r\nmaterials and elaborate decoration deteriorated taste, without\r\ncompensating for the absence of ideal beauty. The masters of this,\r\nwhich we may distinguish as the \"newest\" manner, must accordingly\r\nbe tried by a new standard. Those of the silver and golden ages,\r\nAngelico and Raffaele, sought a simple or vigorous development of\r\ndeep feeling; the Giordani and Caravaggii, men of brass and iron,\r\nwhose technical capacity outstripped their ideas, aspired not\r\nbeyond effect. Effect is, therefore, the self-chosen test to which\r\nartists of the decline should be subjected, though it may detect\r\nin them false taste and vulgar deformity. Under their guidance,\r\nenergy was substituted for grandeur, bustle for dramatic action;\r\nwhile flickering lights and fluttering draperies ill replaced the\r\nsolidity and stateliness of earlier men. Art thus, like literature,\r\nbecame copious rather than captivating. Ambitious attempts were not\r\nwanting, but the effort to produce them was ever palpable. Ingenuity\r\nover-taxed gave birth to bewildering allegories, affected postures,\r\nstartling contrasts, exaggerated colouring, meretricious graces.\r\nNature was invoked to stand godmother to the progeny, but she\r\ndisavowed them as spurious.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *212: An undue sense of right seems to have led Dennistoun\r\nto the brink of an absurd precipice. Why should not the orgy or crime\r\nof a worthless man, make as good a picture as the orgy or crime [or\r\nthe good deeds either, for that matter] of the worthy man? Poetry\r\nsurely would seem to confound him here.]\r\n\r\nThe rapid decline of art when imitation of nature became more\r\nstrictly its object, has led to scepticism in some quarters as to\r\nthe expediency of adopting such a guide. Until human ingenuity shall\r\nattain the means of embodying and preserving perfect copies of\r\nexternal objects, it would be presumptuous to decide how far such\r\ncopies realise that standard of beauty which high art demands. The\r\ndaguerreotype and kalotype, which give the nearest known approach\r\nto such a result, are far from solving the question in accordance\r\nwith naturalist views; for, on their metallic plates and porous\r\npaper, a beautiful woman is, in general, coarsely caricatured; whilst\r\na bust of her, or a bas-relief, always retains the grace of the\r\nsculptured original, and a chalk drawing is exquisitely reproduced.\r\nWere it enough to depict with perfect precision the forms and\r\nincidents reflected on the retina, a painter would be little more\r\nthan a mechanic, in whom original genius might be almost dispensed\r\nwith. But, though he will treasure in his portfolios a judicious\r\nselection of such impressions as he can daily gather from actual\r\nlife, these, however nearly they may approach to nature and truth,\r\nare only materials of future creations. For high art,--and of such\r\nalone would we speak whilst Italy is our theme,--something more\r\nthan mere nature was undoubtedly required;[*213] yet her guidance\r\nbecame indispensable after the revolution in taste and feeling\r\nwhich dismissed mediæval traditions and types. So various, however,\r\nare the freaks of individual fancy, so fantastic the vagaries of\r\nreason uncontrolled by authority, that the new path was beset by new\r\npitfalls. The mediocrity of early masters found a refuge in mean but\r\ninoffensive commonplace; that of their successors, mistaking freedom\r\nand novelty for original genius, revelled in extravagant creations.\r\nThe acute agonies, physical and moral, which sadly consummated the\r\nAtonement for man, were figured by the former in limbs wasted as\r\nby prolonged disease, stiffened as by a lingering death: the deep\r\naffliction of the Madonna Addolorata over the Saviour's body assumed\r\nin their hands an expression of such grief as knew not the relief\r\nof tears. But the artists of the \"new manner\" gave to crucifixions\r\nanatomical accuracy developed in spasmodic writhings, and bespoke\r\nsympathy for the mother of Christ by convulsive weepings, with\r\nperchance the accessory of a pocket-handkerchief! In pictures of\r\nthis class, corporeal sufferings were rendered with horrible truth,\r\nmuscular energy was substituted for mental woe. Living in times which\r\nneeded fresh subjects as well as added powers, these painters laid\r\naside such themes as treated of the mysteries of faith, the legends\r\nof primitive times, but especially such as, demanding spiritualised\r\nfeelings in the author and the spectators, were uncongenial to both.\r\nTo a contemplative religion, untroubled by sectarian movements, had\r\nsucceeded a church militant, armed by bigotry, and struggling for\r\nexistence. The revived Catholicism of Caraffa and Ghislieri required\r\nart of a character as gloomy as itself, and commissioned works\r\nwherein the terrors of the Inquisition replaced the promises of the\r\nGospel, earthly martyrdoms supplanted celestial hopes, and pure faith\r\nwas clouded by priestcraft. Henceforward, religious representations\r\nwere reserved chiefly for church decorations, and even there they\r\nassumed an historical character, as in the miracles of our Lord, or\r\nthe acts of his apostles. Alexander VI. had decorated the pontifical\r\npalace with incidents from the Gospel; but those which Paul III. and\r\nhis successors selected for the Sala Regia commemorate the triumphs\r\nof an aggressive church in the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, and\r\nthe naval action of Lepanto. Michael Angelo, in depicting the Last\r\nJudgment, the chief glory of that pontificate, introduced Charon as\r\na prominent personage; and, with inconsistency, if possible, more\r\nglaring, Poussin has painted Moses, the type of Christ, watched in\r\ninfancy by a river-god, in classical allusion to his preservation\r\nfrom the perils of the Nile.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *213: Art does not desire more than nature, but more than\r\nan imitation of nature. The artist should create life, not imitate\r\nit.]\r\n\r\nWhilst we have thus had to consider the prevalent imitation of\r\nexternal objects as an element tending to the corruption of purist\r\nfeeling, it unquestionably enlarged the scope and stimulated the\r\nmechanism of painting. Such was the naturalism by which Raffaele,\r\nMichael Angelo, and Titian developed the comparatively feeble and\r\nstunted efforts of their predecessors into forms ennobling nature,\r\nand redolent of intelligence. But, in studying these palpable\r\nqualities, the more subtle ingredients of spirit and feeling were\r\noften overlooked; indeed, most of the creators of the new style\r\noutlived it, and saw it supplanted by a yet newer and far more\r\ndegrading naturalism, which, with few bright intervals, has continued\r\nto cramp and pervert the manner of their successors. Such were and\r\nare those painters who, on the strength of their sketches from the\r\nlife, and their studies of landscape and architecture, or with the\r\nplea of occasionally introducing portraits into sacred or historical\r\ncompositions, proclaim themselves followers of nature, whilst\r\ntheir works outrage or caricature her. There may be great anatomical\r\naccuracy, and much truth in the separate heads, combined with\r\ninventions the most unreal, movements the most constrained, mannered\r\nattitudes, draperies meagre or overloaded, and a general substitution\r\nof mean conceptions for pleasing realities. The elaborate finish\r\ninvariably found in the early masters was either bestowed upon\r\naccessories in themselves trifling, but stamping an extraordinary\r\nverity upon their works, or, as in the Sienese or Venetian schools,\r\nit was lavished upon gorgeous costumes illustrative of national\r\nmanners. But similar details in later pictures are justly considered\r\nto remove them in some degree from the category of artistic\r\nperformances to that of mere decoration, and are despised by those\r\nwho, aiming at breadth of effect, sometimes adopt the most hopeless\r\nof all affectations, that of slovenly superficiality. Whence then\r\nthis difference? and why should jewels and embroidery, that seem\r\nbeautiful in Crivelli's saints or Dello's pageants, be vulgar gewgaws\r\non recent canvasses? Merely because, in the former, _all_ is minutely\r\nworked, but all is subsidiary to the general sentiment, whilst, in\r\nthe latter, the absence of a simply pervading expression leaves each\r\nindividual detail crudely prominent; because the ancient masters made\r\neverything subservient to that one overruling feeling of the picture,\r\nwhich, in most modern works, is totally wanting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anderson_\r\n\r\nTHE KNIGHT OF MALTA\r\n\r\n_From the picture by Giorgione, once in the Ducal Collection at\r\nUrbino, now in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence_]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Dukes della Rovere of Urbino had hereditary duties as patrons\r\nof art. Popes Sixtus IV. and Julius II., the founders of their\r\nfamily, had munificently encouraged it; the antecedent princes of\r\nMontefeltro had been its generous and discriminating friends. If the\r\nlater dynasty fell short of these examples, they were not without\r\nexcuse. Though the divine Raffaele parted his mantle among many\r\npupils, no shred of it fell to his native duchy. Francesco Maria\r\nI., on succeeding to that state, found in it no lack of churches,\r\npalaces, or pictures, and little native genius meriting support; so\r\nhe was content to call Titian from Venice to portray himself and his\r\nDuchess.[*214] His two successors were less devoted to arms, and\r\nmore liberal to arts. They numbered among their subjects Baroccio\r\nand the Zuccari, who once more gave a pictorial name to Urbino, and\r\nthey judiciously divided their commissions between these natives and\r\nforeign painters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *214: Francesco Maria may have called, but Titian did not\r\ncome to Urbino. The first commission he had from the Duke was in\r\n1532, when he was asked to paint as good a portrait of Hannibal as he\r\ncould and a picture of the Nativity. They were delivered in 1534. The\r\nDuke wanted then a portrait of the Duchess, and asked Titian to paint\r\nit on his way to Naples. This journey, however, never took place.\r\nIf Titian had any sittings, it was at Murano during the Duke and\r\nDuchess's sojourn there in the autumn of 1537.]\r\n\r\nIn a former portion of this work it was our endeavour to interweave\r\nthe artistic notices which we had to offer in connection with Urbino,\r\ninto a rapid sketch of Christian painting in Umbria. Resuming the\r\nsubject, it will no longer be possible thus to generalise our views,\r\nfor the time had arrived when each aspirant selected his own course\r\nto the temple of Fame; and in glancing at the various paths which\r\nchance or fancy suggested to them, our readers must be prepared for\r\noccasional repetitions. The ground, in itself less interesting,\r\nis more beaten; and though none of the competitors approximated\r\nthe elevation gained by Raffaele, their numbers may be considered\r\nas some compensation for their comparative mediocrity. Lazzari,\r\nin his _Dictionary of Artists_ belonging to his native duchy, has\r\nenumerated, under the Feltrian dukes, five painters, one sculptor,\r\none architect, and one military engineer; while under the Princes\r\ndella Rovere, these numbers are increased to twenty painters, eight\r\narchitects, and sixteen military engineers. Of sculptors, during the\r\nlatter period, there is no account; but along with eighteen followers\r\nof mechanical arts connected with the higher branches, we find\r\nworkers in bronze, stucco, wood-carving, engravers, and makers of\r\nwatches and mathematical instruments, besides two potters and three\r\npainters of majolica. It would be not less irksome than useless to\r\nfollow all this catalogue, but we shall endeavour to throw together\r\nwhatever is generally interesting of art in Urbino, during the\r\nsixteenth century, whether by native painters, or foreigners employed\r\nby the dukes; concluding with a chapter on minor arts, especially\r\nthat of _majolica_, or earthenware, for which the duchy was long\r\ncelebrated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nJUDITH WITH THE HEAD OF HOLOFERNES\r\n\r\n_After the picture by Palma il Vecchio, once in the Ducal Collection\r\nat Urbino_]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur catalogue of artists under the della Rovere dynasty may be\r\nfittingly commenced with a name not unknown to their predecessors,\r\nthe Feltrian dukes. GIROLAMO DELLA GENGA was born at Urbino,\r\nin 1476, of respectable parents, who destined him for the woollen\r\ntrade, by which the wealth of Florence had, in a great measure, been\r\ngained. But the bent of his youthful mind was decidedly towards\r\ndesign, and his pencil so interfered with his proper business, that,\r\nafter much vain opposition, his friends yielded, and sent him, at\r\nfifteen, to the studio of Luca Signorelli. It was the mission of this\r\nable painter to engraft upon the devotional traditions of Umbrian\r\nart, imbibed from Pietro della Francesca, a novel energy of thought\r\nand pencil; and Girolamo had the advantage of aiding him upon those\r\nwonderful compositions in the duomo of Orvieto, which Michael Angelo\r\nscrupled not to imitate in his Last Judgment, as well as warmly to\r\ncommend. After attending his master during the execution of other\r\ncommissions, he passed into the school of Perugino, where he found\r\nhis precocious countryman, the young Raffaele. There he remained\r\nfor three years, devoting himself chiefly to perspective, and\r\nthence repaired to Florence to complete his education. At Siena he\r\nwas largely employed, along with Signorelli, by Pandolfo Petrucci;\r\nreturning from whence to Urbino, he formed an enduring intimacy\r\nwith Timoteo della Vite. They wrought together upon a chapel in\r\nthe cathedral, which no longer exists; but the works there assigned\r\nto Genga were chiefly scenic and decorative, from his acknowledged\r\nsuperiority in architectural perspective; and for these, the various\r\nfestive amusements then in fashion, such as pastoral dramas,\r\ntriumphal processions, cavalry trappings, and temporary arches,\r\noccasioned in that gay capital a perpetual demand, during the\r\nlatter days of Guidobaldo I., and the first years of his successor.\r\nHis invention was especially called into play to welcome Duchess\r\nLeonora to her states, and to supply scenery for the representation\r\nof Bibbiena's _La Calandra_ in 1513. These apparently mechanical\r\nperformances were not, however, irreconcileable with excellence and\r\nfame in the higher branches of art; and it was whilst thus engaged\r\nthat, during a short visit to Rome, he painted, for the oratory of\r\nSta. Caterina of Siena in the Via Giulia, an altar-piece of the\r\nResurrection, justly considered his chef-d'oeuvre.[*215] The\r\nfigure of Christ, soaring upwards amid sprawling angels, somewhat\r\nanticipates Raffaele's Transfiguration, but with a copious infusion\r\nof Michael Angelesque feeling. The latter influence predominates in\r\nthe violent attitudes and excited action of the guards, four of whom,\r\nsuddenly aroused by the supernatural event, are rushing about without\r\naim or self-possession; yet, the movement of one who awakens a still\r\nslumbering comrade is extremely natural. The Marys, approaching\r\nfrom the other side of the picture, recall Timoteo's manner. The\r\ncolour, concealed however under an accumulation of dirt, is of a\r\nsolid quality, and the chiaroscuri are skilfully managed, while the\r\ninscription, _Girolamo Genga Urbinas facieb._, satisfactorily secures\r\nits authenticity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *215: I know nothing of this oratory, and cannot find it.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nHEAD OF CHRIST\r\n\r\n_After the picture by Titian, once in the Ducal Collection, now in\r\nthe Pitti Gallery, Florence_]\r\n\r\nIn 1497, Guidobaldo had granted to the Counts della Genga an\r\nexemption from taxes, for which Girolamo showed his gratitude by\r\nsharing the exile of Francesco Maria, when deprived by the tyrannical\r\nusurpation of Leo X. He retired with his family to Cesena, where,\r\nas at Forlì and other places in Romagna, he executed various church\r\npictures of merit; of these, the Baptism of Christ, the Conversion of\r\nSt. Augustine, and one representing the Almighty, with the Madonna,\r\nand the Doctors of the Church, have found their way to the Brera,\r\nat Milan. On the Duke's restoration, he was appointed his architect\r\nand engineer, and thereafter discontinued painting, devoting himself\r\nalmost entirely to his new duties. Among the churches which he\r\nbuilt, were those of the Zoccolantines at Urbino and Sinigaglia,\r\nbut it was chiefly on the ducal palaces that he was employed.\r\nOf these, the first committed to him was the Imperiale villa,\r\nalready mentioned.[216] Vasari describes it as a \"very beautiful\r\nand well-contrived fabric, full of chambers, colonnades, courts,\r\nbalconies, fountains, and delightful gardens, which every prince\r\npassing that way goes to see; and which Paul III. visited, with his\r\ncourt, when on his way to Bologna, and was quite pleased with all\r\nhe saw.\" It would seem from his account that the most important\r\nameliorations made by Genga upon that long-neglected residence, were\r\nthe tower and internal decorations. The former remains, of handsome\r\nproportions; but its chief merit is said, by the Tuscan biographer,\r\nto have consisted in the management of a concealed wooden stair,\r\nreaching the summit in thirteen flights of steps, one hundred and\r\ntwenty feet in all. In 1543, Bembo wrote to Leonora,--\"I have visited\r\nyour Excellency's Imperiale with much pleasure, both because I\r\ngreatly wished to see it, and because it seems to me constructed\r\nwith more intelligence and true artistic science, as well as with\r\nmore antique fashions and finely contrived conceits, than any modern\r\nbuilding I have seen. I heartily congratulate your Ladyship upon\r\nit, for certainly my gossip Genga is a great and gifted architect,\r\nfar surpassing all my anticipations.\" The frescoes, illustrating\r\nhis employer's life, were distributed by him to several foreign\r\nartificers, the duchy not boasting any painter of talent since the\r\nrecent death of his friend Timoteo Vite. Among these was his pupil\r\nFrancesco Minzocchi of Forlì, who, living on the limits of the\r\nold manner and the new, succeeded in uniting many excellences of\r\nboth; yet, his works at Padua, Venice, Forlì, and Loreto, though\r\nhighly creditable, scarcely merit the exaggerated praise bestowed\r\non some of them by Vasari. That biographer's oversight, and his\r\nown modesty, have, on the other hand, done scrimp justice to\r\nRaffaele del Colle, whose attractive pencil is scarcely appreciated,\r\nnotwithstanding Lanzi's eulogy. A pupil of the incomparable Sanzio,\r\nand of Giulio Romano, he preserved a healthy style amid prevailing\r\ndeterioration; and many of his pictures still adorn the churches of\r\nCentral Italy.[217] Contemporary with these was Angelo Bronzino, who\r\nmaintained at Florence, during an age of general feebleness, the\r\nreputation transmitted by Andrea del Sarto and Pontormo. The grace\r\nof a Cupid, which he painted upon a corbel at the Imperiale, gained\r\nfor him the patronage of Prince Guidobaldo, who employed him in small\r\nproductions more congenial to his genius, including his portrait,\r\nand a harpsichord cover, both of them greatly admired, but now lost.\r\nThe landscape ornaments in the villa were entrusted to the brothers\r\nDossi, of Ferrara, or rather perhaps to Giovanbattista, the younger,\r\nand less able of them; but so total was their failure, that they\r\nwere immediately thrown down, and replaced by others from Genga's\r\ndesigns. More successful in that light style were the portions\r\ncommitted to Camillo of Mantua, whose rural decorations are praised\r\nby Vasari and Lanzi.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 216: See p. 49.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 217: He left some valuable works in the upper valley\r\nof the Metauro, now almost destroyed. Such are his Prophets and\r\nSybils in ten lunettes round the Corpus Domini at Urbania, with two\r\nNativities in the same church, one in fresco, the other on canvas.\r\nAn altar-piece, in the church of the Servites at S. Angelo in Vado,\r\nis very inferior to his Madonna and Saints in S. Francesco of Cagli.\r\nSome frescoes at Gubbio, lauded by Lanzi, and dated 1546, are among\r\nhis best works.]\r\n\r\nWe have thus far chiefly followed Vasari's authority, reconciling,\r\nas best we might, inconsistencies and errors, the result of his\r\nimperfect acquaintance with the locality. The paintings he describes\r\nat the Imperiale were probably part of Duchess Leonora's labour of\r\nlove, to welcome her lord's return from his long campaigns. But the\r\ncondition to which they are reduced, by time and unworthy degradation\r\nof the building, renders it impossible now to form an opinion of\r\nthe various hands that have wrought upon them, or to discover their\r\nrespective merits and subjects. The roofs of two saloons are occupied\r\nby small historical compositions, from the actions of Francesco\r\nMaria; but these are irrecoverably defaced. Two of them, ascribed to\r\nBronzino, are said to have represented the Duke haranguing the band\r\nof adventurers whom he collected in Lombardy, for the invasion of\r\nhis duchy in 1517; and his reception by the Venetian senate in 1523,\r\nas their captain-general. The ornaments of the remaining rooms are\r\nmerely decorative.\r\n\r\nAdditions were made by Francesco Maria to his other residences at\r\nUrbino, Pesaro, and Castel Durante; on all of which, and Gradara,\r\nGenga seems to have been employed. Him also he entrusted to build a\r\ncasino, within the walls of Pesaro, called the Barchetto, in which\r\na ruin was imitated, with a spiral stair commended by Vasari: this\r\nhouse was subsequently assigned by Duke Guidobaldo to Bernardo Tasso,\r\nas a home to himself and his son Torquato; and part of it is now\r\noccupied by a gardener. Another work of Girolamo was the reparation\r\nof the fortress at Pesaro, which, however, he undertook merely in\r\nobedience to his sovereign, military architecture being little to his\r\ntaste. In acknowledgment of these services, he had, in 1528, a grant\r\nof Castel d'Elce, with its feudal immunities, afterwards confirmed by\r\nGuidobaldo II. Some years later, he remodelled the episcopal palace\r\nat Mantua, and began an imposing church to St. John the Baptist at\r\nPesaro, which was completed by his son. Among his minor efforts in\r\nthe immediate service of the ducal family may be mentioned funeral\r\ndecorations for Francesco Maria, and a monument to him, erected by\r\nBartolomeo Ammanati of Florence, in Sta. Chiara of Urbino, but long\r\nago removed. Enriched and honoured, he spent his declining years in\r\nleisure, and died in 1551. Vasari thus testifies to his exemplary\r\ncharacter:--\"Girolamo was an excellent and honest man, of whom\r\nno evil was ever heard. He was not only a painter, sculptor, and\r\narchitect, but also a good musician, an excellent and most amusing\r\ntalker, and was full of courtesy and affection to his relations and\r\nfriends.\" Among his numerous pupils, Baldassare Lancia, of Urbino,\r\nwas distinguished as a military engineer, whilst Bartolomeo his\r\nsecond son, Bellucci of San Marino his son-in-law, and Federigo\r\nBaroccio his nephew, all ably maintained his artistic reputation. In\r\nthe person of Leo XII., one of his family has recently attained the\r\nhighest station offered to the ambition of the Roman Catholic world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBARTOLOMEO DELLA GENGA was born at Cesena in 1518, during\r\nhis father Girolamo's emigration, and was sent to Florence at\r\neighteen to study design in its various branches, under Vasari and\r\nAmmanati. At twenty-one he returned to his father, who, seeing his\r\ntalent lie towards architecture, advised him to acquaint himself at\r\nRome with the best models. His first commission on returning home was\r\nto prepare festive arches for Duchess Vittoria's reception after her\r\nmarriage. He then accompanied Guidobaldo to Lombardy, as his military\r\nengineer, and, by examining the celebrated fortresses in that\r\ncountry, added greatly to his professional experience. He at this\r\ntime refused very eligible appointments from the King of Bohemia,\r\nand subsequently from Genoa, wishing to dedicate his services to his\r\nown sovereign. Accordingly, on his father's death, he became ducal\r\narchitect, and built large additions to the palaces of Urbino and\r\nPesaro, especially the wing of the former, facing S. Domenico. He\r\nalso erected a number of churches in the duchy, and prepared plans\r\nfor a harbour at Pesaro, which were not carried into effect. Having\r\nattended the Duke to Rome in 1553, he gave some hints to Julius III.\r\nfor the new fortifications of Borgo S. Spirito.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nTHE RESURRECTION\r\n\r\n_After the banner painted by Titian for the Compagnia di Corpus\r\nDomini, now in the Pinacoteca, Urbino_]\r\n\r\nHis reputation being thus established, the Order of Malta selected\r\nhim to superintend the new defences proposed for their island, and\r\nin 1557 sent two knights on a mission to obtain the Duke of Urbino's\r\nsanction of Genga's engagement. During two months Guidobaldo resisted\r\nall importunities, and they at length succeeded only through a\r\nCapuchin friar, who, possessing his ear, represented the work as one\r\nin which all Christendom was interested. On Bartolomeo's arrival,\r\nhe had but time to prepare a series of plans for civil and military\r\narchitecture, when he was cut off by fever consequent upon exposure\r\nin the burning heat, having scarcely completed his fortieth year. Of\r\nthis family also was SIMONE GENGA, who, after fortifying many Tuscan\r\nstrongholds, carried his engineering talents to Gratz, in Austria.\r\nFrom Stephen, King of Poland, he had, in 1587, a monthly salary of\r\n76 dollars, besides allowances for four servants and as many horses,\r\nwhilst completing the defences of Varadino. Other architects of\r\nUrbino are mentioned by the Marchese Ricci as leaving structures in\r\nLa Marca, such as LATTANZIO VENTURI, who, in 1581, built the communal\r\npalace at Macerata, with an allowance of 30 scudi for his plan, and\r\n40 more for overseeing its execution. Six years later, he completed\r\nthe façade of Loreto church, in the charge of which he was succeeded\r\nby his son Venturo. His countryman, LUDOVICO CARDUCCI, having\r\naccompanied him to Macerata, was employed on various ecclesiastical\r\nedifices there, his designs for which were submitted for approval\r\nto the Duke of Urbino. From Venturo Venturi the superintendence of\r\nLoreto devolved, about 1614, upon GIOVANNI BRANCA, of S. Angelo in\r\nVado, who died there in 1645, aged seventy-four. His _Manual of\r\nArchitecture_ had passed through six editions previous to the present\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII\r\n\r\n     Taddeo Zuccaro--Federigo Zuccaro--Their pupils--Federigo\r\n     Baroccio and his pupils--Claudio Ridolfi--Painters of\r\n     Gubbio.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was just after the fatal sack of Rome had dispersed the goodly\r\ncompany of painters, who, reared by Raffaele, and linked together\r\nby the recollection of his genius and his winning qualities, gave\r\npromise of long maintaining in the Christian capital that manner\r\nwhich he had brought to perfection,--that there was born to Ottaviano\r\nZuccaro, or Zucchero, an indifferent artist of S. Angelo in Vado, a\r\nson destined to revive the pictorial reputation of Urbino. TADDEO\r\nZUCCARO saw the light in 1529, and, while yet a boy, perceiving\r\nlittle hope of excellence under such instruction as Umbria could\r\nthen afford, or of remedying the poverty of his paternal fireside,\r\nhe boldly sought a wider field of improvement and enterprise, and\r\nat fourteen found his way to Rome. The hardships which he there\r\nunderwent are touchingly described by Vasari. Aided by no friendly\r\nhand, his education was neglected, and he was driven to menial\r\nlabour for the support of a precarious existence. Wandering from one\r\nstudio to another, he earned a crust of bread by colour-grinding;\r\nand, unable to afford light for his evening studies, he spent the\r\nmoonlight nights in drawing, till sleep surprised him beneath some\r\nportico. Under this hard life his health gave way, whilst his spirit\r\nremained indomitable, and he sought rest and renewed vigour in his\r\nnative mountain air. But his thirst for improvement was not stayed\r\nby these sufferings. On his return to Rome with recruited energies,\r\nhe was received into the studio of Jacopone Bertucci of Faenza, a\r\nfollower of Raffaele, whose few independent works entitle him to more\r\nhonourable mention than has been afforded him by Vasari or Lanzi,\r\nand who united the tasteful design of that master with somewhat of\r\nLombard feeling. Taddeo subsequently aided one Daniello di Por, who\r\ncarried to Rome much of the Parmese manner, imitating Correggio and\r\nParmegianino. At eighteen he executed on his own account, on the\r\nexterior of the Mattei Palace, a series of nine events in the life\r\nof Camillus, which attracted general admiration, and established his\r\npopularity as a historical painter. These, and several other works in\r\nfresco done soon after, have been destroyed.\r\n\r\nHis rising reputation having reached Urbino, Guidobaldo II. summoned\r\nhim there, when about fifteen, to undertake the exterior decorations\r\nof a chapel in the cathedral, which had been painted by Battista\r\nFranco, and soon after carried him on his tour of inspection of the\r\nVenetian terra-firma fortresses. On his return, he was established in\r\nthe palace at Pesaro, where he painted the Duke's portrait and some\r\nother cabinet pictures. Two years thus passed away without his being\r\nable to commence the chapel, although the designs for it were well\r\nadvanced; and being dissatisfied with this loss of time, he availed\r\nhimself of his sovereign's absence at Rome to follow him thither.\r\nOrders now crowded upon him, for no contemporary painter was better\r\nqualified to supply those slight and rapidly executed works then in\r\nfashion for the external and internal decoration of Roman palaces\r\nand villas. Most of these have perished; but somewhat superior in\r\ncharacter were the incidents in the Passion, painted in 1556, in\r\nthe Church of Consolation under the Capitol. They are still in good\r\npreservation, but though cleverly conceived and carefully executed,\r\nthese merits scarcely compensate for the exaggerated mannerism of\r\ntheir sprawling attitudes and solid draperies, whilst their violent\r\nemotions are anything but devotional. From this time his brother\r\nFederigo was associated in most of his labours, and the speed with\r\nwhich their commissions were finished brought them easy gains, and\r\ngave satisfaction in an age when taste had sadly degenerated. An\r\narrangement, whereby Taddeo agreed to accompany the Duke of Guise to\r\nFrance, with a salary of 600 scudi, was interrupted by the Duke's\r\ndeath; but soon after our artist had a more important commission,\r\nfrom Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, to paint in his palace of\r\nCaprarola, near Viterbo, the heroic actions of his family. This was\r\nprecisely the class of subject for which the manner and ideas of the\r\nZuccari were most adapted, and the results were highly satisfactory.\r\nAccordingly, these paintings, engraved by Prenner in 1748, remain a\r\nstandard of that style of palatial decoration. Taddeo's allowance was\r\n200 scudi a year, for which he undertook to prepare all the cartoons,\r\nand to superintend their execution by his brother and other young\r\nartists. Among those whom he was thus enabled to bring forward,\r\nseveral, including Baroccio, were his seniors, a natural consequence\r\nof the good fortune which brought him early into repute as a clever\r\nhead-master of the contract work then in vogue. His mural paintings\r\nin the Sala Regia of the Vatican, and his sacred subjects in the\r\nchapel of S. Marcello there, were also undertakings of considerable\r\nextent, sharing his attention with Caprarola during the latter years\r\nof his life. His last work was the Assumption of the Madonna in the\r\nTrinità del Monte, upon which death surprised him in 1566, and his\r\ndust reposes in the Pantheon, near that of his more illustrious\r\ncountryman Raffaele, like whom, he died on the day his thirty-seventh\r\nyear was completed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nTHE LAST SUPPER\r\n\r\n_After the picture by Baroccio in the Duomo of Urbino_]\r\n\r\nHis brother FEDERIGO, fourteen years his junior, was brought\r\nto Rome in 1550, and committed to his charge. The advantage of an\r\nassociate on whom he could rely was immense to one whose works\r\nwere, even from youth, in a great measure, executed by others;\r\nand fraternal affection, cemented by a similarity of tastes and\r\npursuits, grew up into an identity of character and habits which\r\nextended to their respective works, and enabled the younger Zuccaro\r\nsatisfactorily to terminate the commissions which Taddeo left\r\nunfinished. Precocity was a characteristic of both; and the only\r\ninterruption to their harmony arose from the latter having retouched\r\nsome frescoes done by Federigo, when but eighteen years old, outside\r\nof a house in Rome. The quarrel having become serious, a compromise\r\nwas effected by mutual friends, on an understanding that the designs,\r\nbut not the finished works of the youth, should be submitted to his\r\nbrother's correction. During his residence in Rome, Federigo was,\r\nhowever, chiefly employed on those mural paintings which we have\r\nalready mentioned as undertaken by Taddeo; and when about twenty-two,\r\nhe spent a considerable time in Venice, painting, on his own account,\r\nin the Grimani Palace, whilst his contemporaries were still busy with\r\ntheir preliminary studies. There was even a proposal to assign to him\r\nthe façade of the great council hall, but jealousy among the native\r\nartists prevented this taking effect. He was, however, consoled by\r\nthe friendship of Palladio, who engaged him to decorate a large\r\ntemporary theatre, and whom he subsequently accompanied on a tour\r\nthrough Friuli and Lombardy. Thence he visited Florence, in time to\r\ntake part in the festive decorations which welcomed Joanna of Austria\r\nto her new capital, and, after a visit to his family, arrived at Rome\r\nearly in 1566. It was about this time he painted for Duke Guidobaldo\r\nthe Liberation of St. Peter from prison, now in the Pitti Gallery, a\r\npicture of no great intrinsic merit, though dexterous in effect; and\r\nnow, too, Verdizotti of Venice complimented his early promise in this\r\nelegant sonnet, wherein the \"tree of Jove\" means the oak, the badge\r\nof Urbino and its dukes.\r\n\r\n     \"Ecco! del glorioso arbor di Giove\r\n       Un giovinetto ramo uscir sì altero,\r\n       Ch'a speme di bei frutti ogni pensiero\r\n       Desta al fiorir de le sue frondi nove.\r\n     In lui tai gratie il ciel benigno piove,\r\n       Che simili in altrui poch'altre spero;\r\n       Gratie, per cui virtù gli apre il sentiero\r\n       Ad ogni honor, che meraviglia move.\r\n     E già le cime dei più culti allori\r\n       L'inchinan' grate, e lieto augurio danno\r\n       D'eterno pregio ai suoi giorni migliori.\r\n     Alhor l'amate ghiande illustri andranno\r\n       Di sì fin or, ch'al par de' suoi splendori\r\n       Gli alti raggi del sole ombre saranno.\"\r\n\r\nHis brother's premature death made him heir of his fame and fortune:\r\nthe latter he speedily increased, but the former he was scarcely\r\nadequate to sustain. Yet the dexterity by which he mastered, and\r\nthe rapidity wherewith, by numerous assistants, he completed works\r\nof great extent, not only obtained him the commissions which Taddeo\r\nleft imperfect, but secured him a preference for all undertakings\r\nof that description in Rome. It was upon this principle that he was\r\ncalled to Florence, to terminate the cupola of the cathedral; yet\r\nfor the abortive effect of this vast composition, which has more\r\nthan once narrowly escaped whitewash, Federigo is scarcely to be\r\nheld responsible. The irretrievably hopeless attempt of filling\r\nsuitably so immense an expanse with a figure composition, had been\r\nbegun by a better artist than himself, and the blame of so gross a\r\nblunder must lie with Vasari. Don Vincenzo Borghini suggested the\r\ntheme--Paradise allegorically treated in eight compartments, in seven\r\nof which are set forth the seven mysteries of our Lord's passion,\r\nwhile the eighth celebrates the triumph of the Romish church. The\r\nchief interest of this colossal performance lies in its monstrous\r\ncompass; containing, it is said, three hundred figures, some of them\r\nthirty feet high. Returned to Rome, he was employed by Gregory XIII.\r\non the roof of the Pauline chapel, whose walls had been decorated\r\nby Michael Angelo. The favours which fortune thus showered upon him\r\nsoothed not the petulance of an irritable temper; and the bitter\r\nsatire wherewith he caricatured some supposed enemies in a picture of\r\nCalumny, obliged him precipitately to quit the Holy City. This was\r\na congenial subject, which he often treated. Once it was done for\r\nthe Orsini of Bracciano; another of large size is noted in Pelli's\r\ncatalogue of the Urbino pictures; and there is a small one in the\r\ngallery of the Uffizi. There are some curious particulars in Gaye's\r\n_Carteggio_ of the annoyance to which this sally subjected him.[218]\r\nIn 1581, he was held to bail for 500 scudi, to answer a charge of\r\nslander which it was hoped might be founded upon the testimony of\r\nhis three assistants, who were imprisoned until they should supply\r\na key to the suspected personalities. On this emergency he sought\r\nprotection from the influence of his sovereign, and of the Grand Duke\r\nFrancesco I. of Florence, by whose mediation he made his peace, and\r\nreturned to Rome at Easter 1583. The Duke of Urbino's application was\r\nnot disinterested, being anxious to secure Federigo's services for\r\na chapel he was then building at Loreto, dedicated to the Madonna\r\ndell'Annunziata, regarding his frescoes in which we shall presently\r\nhave some observations to offer. It is unnecessary to follow his\r\nseveral journeys to foreign courts and distant countries, whence\r\nhe returned honoured and enriched. In 1574, after his flight from\r\nRome, he passed through Paris, Flanders, and Holland, to England,\r\nwhere he probably remained for some time, painting portraits; but\r\nhis works there do not seem to have been ascertained, or examined\r\nwith much criticism. Several are loosely mentioned by Walpole, and\r\nhis annotator Dalloway, one of which, representing Queen Elizabeth's\r\ngigantic porter, is said by Stirling to bear date 1580. His chalk\r\ndrawings of her and Leicester, engraved by Rogers, can scarcely be\r\nthe same mentioned by Borghini as executed in 1575.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 218: Vol. III., p. 444.]\r\n\r\nOn his return to Rome, Olivarez, ambassador from Philip II., whose\r\novertures to Paul Veronese had been unsuccessful, proposed that he\r\nshould proceed to Madrid. There he arrived in January, 1586, and,\r\nafter being received with great splendour, was immediately named\r\nking's painter, with 2000 dollars of pension, and an apartment in the\r\nEscurial. From that palace he, on the 29th of May, wrote a letter\r\ndescriptive of his first works, which merits notice as showing his\r\nopinion, and that of the age, on the fitting tone and treatment to\r\nbe followed in high religious art. \"My apartment contains excellent\r\nrooms, besides saloon and study, where his Majesty frequently deigns\r\nto come and see me work, loading me with favours. I observe you\r\ndesire now to hear something as to what I have done or am about.\r\nThere are four large pictures, for two altars of the relics, opening\r\nand closing like organ-doors, to be painted on both sides. They are\r\ndedicated to the Annunciation and to St. Jerome; and I have treated\r\nthem thus:--On opening the former is seen our Lady, somewhat startled\r\nand confused by the angel's entrance, while on the outer side I\r\nhave made her assenting to the salutation in the words, 'Behold\r\nthe handmaid of the Lord.' The exterior of St. Jerome is penitent;\r\nnot as he is usually made, simply repenting, but having that faith\r\nand hope in God without which neither abstinence nor remorse can\r\navail, together with the love, charity, and filial awe, that ought\r\never to connect us with God and our neighbour. And these I fancy as\r\ngrouped together in idea before the saint; so I have set in front\r\nof him a cross, with Christ in the last agony, in order to inspire\r\nhim with increased contrition, and at the foot thereof the three\r\ntheological virtues among clouds. On the interior of the two doors,\r\nI have depicted St. Jerome, as a doctor of the church, writing:\r\nand as companion to the idealised penitence without, I thought fit\r\nto introduce the means and aims of study, so that the saint, though\r\nwriting, is in a contemplative ecstasy, attended by three angels.\r\nTwo of them, typifying perseverance and love of study (without\r\nwhich no science can be learned, no fruit obtained), hold his book\r\nand ink-horn; the third stands at his ear, suggesting thoughts and\r\nsentences, and pointing out, on the other door, the entire subject he\r\nis writing about: I intended this one for the guardian angel, or for\r\nthat intelligence and thought, whereby all is contrived and composed;\r\nand I endeavoured to represent him as incorporeal, transparent and\r\nspiritual, a style little used on account of its difficulty. On that\r\nother door, I embodied the whole theme which St. Jerome, the most\r\nholy divine and doctor, is inditing, as to the Saviour's passion\r\nand man's redemption, dwelling specially on the considerations that\r\ninduced the Father Almighty to send his only begotten Son into the\r\nworld, to redeem mankind by his great sufferings. I imagine Charity\r\nas appearing in his vision, and saying 'It was I who moved God,\r\nand made Christ descend on earth'; to express which symbolically,\r\na saint-like matron presses one hand on her breast, and indicates\r\nwith the other a dead Christ borne by angels through the air. But\r\nwhat most pleases his Majesty and all beholders, being of peculiar\r\nmystic meaning and charming effect, is the three little Cupids who,\r\nat the feet of Charity, disport themselves with St. Jerome's lion,\r\nwhich comes forward most opportunely, his ferocity so tamed by these\r\nchildren, that he lets them pat, handle, and ride upon him, licking\r\nand fondling them the while, a clear proof that our God is not a\r\nGod of anger and vengeance, but of love, peace, charity, and grace.\r\nDuring this winter I made all the designs and cartoons for these\r\nsubjects, and have already coloured and entirely completed the first\r\nAnnunciation, and the St. Jerome writing; at present I have in hand\r\nthe Charity; and all, thank God, is to his Majesty's taste. This\r\ndone, his Majesty wishes me to commence the _retavola_ of the high\r\naltar [for the Escurial], where there will be eight great pictures in\r\noil, those others being on panel.\"[219]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 219: Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 816, f. 64-72.]\r\n\r\nIn this second commission our painter was less fortunate. The eight\r\npieces represented St. Laurence's Martyrdom, five events in the\r\nlife of Christ, the Descent of Tongues, and the Assumption. As\r\nthey rapidly advanced, aided by several youths who had accompanied\r\nFederigo from Italy, he observed with anxiety the courtiers' cold or\r\ncontemptuous silence; and, desiring to test his patron's feelings,\r\nhe presented the Nativity to Philip with the arrogant exclamation,\r\n\"Here, Sire, is all that painting can accomplish, a picture that\r\nmay be viewed closely or from a distance.\" After long gazing on\r\nthe canvas, his Majesty asked if those things in the basket were\r\nmeant for eggs. So paltry a criticism says little for the monarch's\r\nconnoisseurship, and the mortified artist was consoled by seeing his\r\nwork placed on its destined altar. Mr. Stirling informs us that,\r\nupon this failure, he was set to paint six frescoes in the Escurial\r\ncloister, which gave as little satisfaction. In order to test his\r\ncomplaints of his assistants, he was then desired to execute the\r\nConception without their aid, but with no better result. After\r\nhis departure, several portions of his _retavola_ were dismissed\r\nfrom the high altar, and most of his frescoes were defaced; but\r\nnotwithstanding these repeated disgusts, and the moderate success\r\nof two other altar-pieces mentioned by Conca, Zuccaro remained for\r\nnearly three years in Spain, and was finally dismissed with gifts\r\nand pensions exceeding the remuneration stipulated for his services.\r\nThe solution of his disappointment is simple. The artistic genius\r\nof Italy was greatly exhausted: that of Spain was a virgin soil\r\npromising many golden harvests.[220]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 220: In referring to the _Annals of the Artists of Spain_,\r\nit is a sincere pleasure to bear my feeble testimony to the merits\r\nof that excellent work. It is replete with information new to the\r\nEnglish reader, and is enriched by apt and copious illustrations\r\nselected from a wide range of literature and æsthetics.]\r\n\r\nSome letters of Federigo Zuccaro in the Oliveriana Library further\r\nillustrate the turn of thought which influenced religious art in\r\nthe end of the sixteenth century. He had been employed in 1583 by\r\nFrancesco Maria II. to decorate a chapel in the church of Loreto;\r\nit was dedicated to the Madonna, and the theme prescribed for his\r\nfrescoes was her life. The altar-picture by Baroccio represented the\r\nAnnunciation; and the scenes selected for mural paintings were her\r\nmarriage, visitation, death, assumption, and coronation. Of these\r\nthe first three belonged to a class of dramatic compositions adapted\r\nto the prevailing taste, while the others partook of the Umbrian\r\ninfluence which still lingered around that shrine. The subsidiary\r\nornaments being of course under the direction of Zuccaro, he felt\r\npuzzled how to fill up certain spaces offered by the architectural\r\narrangement, and wrote to the Duke. After consulting the chief\r\ntheological authorities among the hierarchy of Loreto what would best\r\ndevelop the \"humble and mystic\" sentiment which it was his object\r\nto sustain, the artist suggested that figures emblematic of glory\r\nand perpetuity should support the Coronation of the Madonna, as\r\nexpressing the inherent attributes of that subject. In like manner\r\nhe proposed to accompany her Death with Faith, Hope, and the Fear\r\nof God, the best supports of a death-bed; whilst the Assumption\r\nwas to have Charity on one hand, Perseverance on the other, and\r\nabove Joy, the fruit of these virtues and the foretaste of glory.\r\nAs accompaniments for the Annunciation, he submitted that there\r\nshould be two prophets or sibyls, the instruments through whom the\r\nincarnation of the Word was predicted. Giotto or Fra Angelico\r\nwould have chosen the prophets of the Old Testament; Michael Angelo\r\nwould have preferred pagan sibyls; Perugino or Raffaele might have\r\ninvoked them both; Zuccaro, painting at Loreto, thought either\r\nequally appropriate appendages to his allegorical creations.[221]\r\nYet Federigo was not altogether blinded to the barbarous tendency of\r\nthe taste around him. In writing of Milan, he says that the painters\r\nthere had in his day \"wofully diverged from the beautiful simplicity\r\nand arrangement of those living early in the century; and that the\r\nProccaccini, especially Giulio Cesare, introduced a set of scoffing\r\nheads, and certain angels so debauched looking, and devoid of all\r\nreverence in the presence of God and the Madonna, that I know not how\r\nthey are tolerated, unless it be that they are excused for the sake\r\nof many other commendable parts.\"[222]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 221: In reference to appropriate lights, Baroccio entirely\r\ncondemns the use of stained glass, as darkening the interior, and\r\ninjuring, by coloured rays, the effect of paintings. Zuccaro,\r\nhowever, recommends the introduction of a tinted armorial bearing,\r\nsurrounded by a wreath of fruits and flowers, as likely to mellow\r\nwithout obscuring the chapel.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 222: _Lettere Pittoriche_, vii., p. 513.]\r\n\r\nOf the large number of important works he executed in Venice,\r\nMilan, Pavia, Turin, and other towns of Upper Italy, we shall not\r\nattempt a catalogue, nor of his many frescoes in the Roman palaces\r\nand churches. We cannot, however, pass by an altar-picture still in\r\nthe Church of Sta. Caterina in his native town, which was carried\r\nto Paris by the French plunderers. It represents Peter, Francis,\r\nand other saints, presenting to the Madonna the Zuccaro family,\r\nconsisting of two men, a woman, and seven children--probably Taddeo,\r\nhimself, his wife and offspring; and it is inscribed \"Federigo\r\nZuccaro dedicates this monument of his affection to the intercessors\r\nof his family and birthplace, 1603.\" Besides the interest attaching\r\nto the portraits, it is a satisfactory specimen of his usual manner.\r\nA work of his brother, connected with the history of the duchy, has\r\nbeen described in a previous volume.[223]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 223: Vol. II.]\r\n\r\nAcademical instruction is considered as favourable only to mediocrity\r\nby many who maintain that genius must be cramped by the fetters of\r\nuncongenial routine, or by the prescribed duties of a conventional\r\ncurriculum. The Academy of St. Luke was, however, founded under\r\nGregory XIII., and Federigo Zuccaro was, in 1593, elected its first\r\npresident, an honour appreciated far beyond the favour of princes or\r\nthe decoration of knighthood. After inauguration, he was conducted\r\nby a crowd of artists to the palace he had built for himself on the\r\nPincian Hill, at that corner otherwise consecrated by the residences\r\nof Claude, Salvator Rosa, and Nicolò Poussin. Here he afterwards held\r\nmeetings of the Academy, where he read his discourses; and by will\r\nhe left to it that house, failing of his natural heirs. His death\r\noccurred in 1608, at Ancona, at the age of sixty-six; but the clause\r\nof remainder in favour of the Academy has never become effectual, the\r\npalace in the Via Sistina being still possessed by his descendants.\r\nIt is well known as the Casa Bertoldy, and may be regarded as the\r\ncradle of the modern German school of painting. The frescoes on which\r\nOverbeck, Cornelius, Schnorr, and Veit first essayed that elevated\r\nand pure style which has regenerated European taste, there attract\r\nmany an admirer, little aware that the basement rooms, abandoned\r\nto menial uses, contain some of the latest efforts of cinque-cento\r\ndecoration that have fair pretensions to merit. The richest of them\r\nhas its vaulted roof studded with allegorical delineations of the\r\narts, sciences, and virtues, painting being justly pre-eminent in a\r\npainter's house. The lunettes of another are crowded by portraits\r\nof the Zuccari, extending over four generations, and numbering\r\ntwenty-one heads, true to nature. The third, which was Federigo's\r\nnuptial chamber, exhibits the ceremony of his marriage, around\r\nwhich are figures of Chastity, Continence, Concord, and Felicity, in\r\nthe fashion of an age when genius had been replaced by ingenuity,\r\ngrandeur by dexterous execution.\r\n\r\nThe infirmity of Federigo's temper, to which we have already alluded,\r\nmay account for his unworthy treatment of Vasari. In the marginal\r\nnotes upon his copy of the Vite de' Pittori, now in the Royal\r\nLibrary at Paris, as well as in an original work which we are about\r\nto mention, he takes every opportunity of sneering ungenerously at\r\none whose biography of his brother, and whose allusions to himself\r\nare conceived in kind and flattering terms. Although his _Idea de'\r\nPittori, Scultori, ed Architetti_, printed in the year of his death,\r\nis supposed to be but a compend of his lectures at St. Luke's, he\r\nis believed to have intended it as a triumph over Vasari's justly\r\npopular writings. In this, however, he signally failed; it has the\r\nmysticism of philosophy without its spirit, while its pedantic\r\nsubtleties are puerile rather than profound. This, and his _Lamento\r\ndella Pittura_, are books of great rarity, but in no way merit a\r\nreprint. A mannerist with pen and pencil, the conceits of the former\r\nequal the allegories of the latter; nature and feeling are alien to\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Zuccari were little identified by their works with their\r\nnative state, and obtained less of the ducal patronage than their\r\ncontemporary Baroccio, their names have reflected much lustre upon\r\nUrbino. Yet the space which they occupied in the public view was\r\nowing to the smiles of propitious fortune,--to a happy facility of\r\nexecuting without exertion whatever commissions were offered,--to a\r\ncertain magnificence and liberality in their manner of life,--and,\r\nin the case of Federigo, to an overweening vanity, rather than to\r\nany positive artistic excellence. Their reputation has accordingly\r\nwaned, as the remembrance of such incidental qualities waxed faint,\r\nand as a distant posterity applied to them that only sure test, the\r\nmerit of their works. Nor were these the only advantages of their\r\nposition. An analogy has been deduced between Taddeo and the immortal\r\nRaffaele, not from any supposed resemblance of their pencils or\r\ngenius, but because both were natives of the same state, both painted\r\nextensively in fresco at Rome, both died when \"exactly thirty-seven,\"\r\nand both were buried in the same corner of the Pantheon. Federigo, on\r\nthe other hand, was, like Titian, invited to courts, decorated and\r\nenriched by monarchs; like Raffaele and Michael Angelo, he was an\r\narchitect and a sculptor as well as a painter; like Vasari, he aimed\r\nat a literary reputation. The works of the brothers display a marked\r\nsimilarity, a natural result of their long painting together; yet\r\ndeterioration became perceptible as their distance from the golden\r\nage increased, and the younger may be distinguished by a pervading\r\ninferiority of taste and design, but especially by a growing\r\nmannerism and laxity in his conceptions, and by the overcrowding\r\nof his subjects. To balance these deficiencies, his person was\r\nattractive, his general attainments were far more comprehensive, and\r\na longer life was granted for the enjoyment of his fortune and the\r\nextension of his fame, than fell to the lot of Taddeo. The failing\r\nmainly attributable to both was absence of style. Their inventions\r\nwere often flimsy, and their compositions, deficient in unity and\r\ndignity, are often little more than figure groups.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA necessary consequence of the low style of art which the Zuccari\r\nadopted was that, notwithstanding the number of assistants whom they\r\nconstantly employed, their school neither attained to considerable\r\nrepute among their contemporaries, nor put forth many pupils of\r\nnote; offering in this respect a marked contrast to that of their\r\ncountryman Baroccio, whose pleasing manner attracted a host of\r\nadmirers and imitators. Two natives of Pesaro, however, possess a\r\ncertain reputation in the semi-mechanical church decorations then\r\nlargely produced. They were Nicolò Trometta, generally called NICOLÒ\r\nDA PESARO, and GIAN GIACOMO PANDOLFI, the latter of whom was the\r\nearliest instructor of Simon Cantarini da Pesaro. The various works\r\nwhich these and other Zuccaristi have left in the duchy are quite\r\nunworthy of special description, and we may dismiss them with the\r\nmention of CAVALIERE DOMENICO CRESTI DA PASSIGNANO, whose chief title\r\nto fame is reflected from that of his pupils TIARINI and LUDOVICO\r\nCARACCI. Among the painters less known to fame were BIAGIO and\r\nGIROLAMO D'URBINO, both of whom were employed in the Escurial; the\r\nformer left Spain along with Federigo Zuccaro, in 1588; the latter\r\nwrought under Pelegrino Tibaldi. Ottovevenius, after spending seven\r\nyears with Federigo, carried his influence beyond the Alps, and\r\neventually numbered Rubens among his scholars.\r\n\r\nAmong the artists who repaired to Urbino at the summons of Duke\r\nFederigo, for the construction of his palace, was Ambrogio Barocci,\r\nor Baroccio, a Milanese sculptor, who established himself there, and,\r\nafter long labouring on its plastic decorations, founded a family\r\nsingularly distinguished in the higher branches of mechanical and\r\npictorial art. His two daughters were married to Girolamo and Nicolò\r\ndella Genga, and his great-grandson Federigo, upon whose biography\r\nwe must dwell at some length, had an elder brother Simone, who after\r\nstudying the exact sciences under Federigo Comandino, became the\r\nbest mathematical instrument maker that had hitherto been seen. His\r\ncousins, the Cavaliere Giovanni Battista and Giovanni Maria, were\r\nnot less famous in watchmaking, an art successfully patronised by\r\nthe Dukes delle Rovere, which we shall mention in our fifty-fifth\r\nchapter. FEDERIGO BAROCCIO was born in 1528, and initiated\r\ninto the rudiments of design by his father, who practised engraving\r\nand modelling. His early efforts having been approved by his\r\ngrand-uncle Girolamo Genga, he was placed under the tuition of\r\nBattista Franco of Venice, an indifferent painter, much employed\r\nin the majolica shops at Urbino, whose taste for designing from\r\nantique sculpture directed his pupil's attention to those effects of\r\nchiaroscuro which distinguished his matured style. After assiduous\r\nlabours in this way, he repaired to Pesaro, then his sovereigns'\r\nresidence, where were placed their accumulated treasures of art.\r\nThere he observed the works of Raffaele and Titian, under the\r\nguidance of Genga, who carefully advanced his artistic education,\r\nespecially in perspective. At twenty he went to Rome, anxious to\r\nsee the triumphs of his great countryman, which he forthwith set\r\nhimself to study. Several anecdotes are told of his modesty, which\r\nkept him in the background until chance obtained for his drawings a\r\npassing compliment from Michael Angelo, and the warm sympathy and\r\nencouragement of Giovanni da Udine, delighted to find in the youth a\r\ncountryman as well as an admirer of his former master. After imbibing\r\ninspiration from these healthful fountains, he returned home, and\r\nexecuted some church paintings. But the casual arrival of one who\r\nbrought some cartoons and crayon drawings from Parma gave a new turn\r\nto his ideas. Forgetting the grandeur of Buonarroti and the pure\r\nbeauty of Raffaele, he aimed at those meretricious graces which have\r\nborrowed from the dexterity of Parmegianino, and the luscious pencil\r\nof Correggio, a fascination unsupported by their intrinsic merits,\r\nand pregnant with mischief to art. To him, however, belongs the\r\ncredit of introducing into Lower Italy a harmonious application of\r\nlight and shade, to which his early lamp studies from sculpture may\r\nhave conduced.\r\n\r\nReturning to Rome in 1560, he found Federigo Zuccaro in the\r\nascendant, and from him received a hint as to the tendency of this\r\nmanner, which it would have been well that he had adopted. Having,\r\nat the request of Federigo, painted two children on a frieze, with\r\na fusion of colour very rarely effected in fresco, the latter,\r\nconsidering this to be overdone, retraced the outlines with a brush,\r\nimparting to them that force which was wanting to the work. Baroccio\r\ntook the reproof in good part, but profited not by it. During his\r\nfirst visit he had become known to Cardinal Giulio della Rovere, by\r\nwhose influence, probably, he procured employment at the Vatican and\r\nBelvidere, in company with Zuccaro. With the decline of their art,\r\nthe good feeling of the painters' fraternity waned, and the kindly\r\nsympathies of that glorious band, whom Raffaele had imbued with a\r\nportion of his amiable nature, no longer animated their successors.\r\nThose who saw in Baroccio one who would have raised the standard of\r\ntaste from the abandonment which immediately succeeded the dispersion\r\nof that noble school, instead of seconding his efforts poisoned him\r\nat a banquet. He survived the potion, but four years of pain and\r\nfeeble health elapsed ere he could return to his labours. When his\r\nsystem had in some degree resumed its vigour among his mountain\r\nbreezes, he was called to Perugia to paint for its cathedral the\r\nDeposition from the Cross, a work which, far from exhibiting any\r\nprostration of power, greatly surpassed his previous efforts. No\r\nscriptural theme offers greater technical difficulties, or demands a\r\nlarger share of those grand and energetic qualities in which Baroccio\r\nwas usually deficient. It is, therefore, one of his most remarkable\r\nefforts, as regards its own qualities, and the circumstances under\r\nwhich it was produced. It occupied him during three years, and was\r\nfollowed by the Absolution of St. Francis, for the Franciscans of\r\nUrbino, on which he laboured in their convent for above twice that\r\nperiod. In consideration of their poverty, he charged but a hundred\r\ngolden scudi for the work, to which they gratefully added as many\r\nflorins.\r\n\r\nIt is not our intention to give a catalogue of even his more\r\nimportant productions, although a large proportion of them were\r\nexecuted for the decoration of his native state, which his patriotism\r\ninduced him to prefer to the splendid offers made him by foreign\r\nmonarchs. Among those commissioned by his sovereign was the Calling\r\nof St. Andrew, finished in 1584, and presented to Philip II., that\r\nsaint being patron of the Spanish order of the Golden Fleece. It\r\nwas about the same time that Duke Francesco Maria dedicated to the\r\nMadonna del Annunziata, a chapel in the church of Loreto, which we\r\nhave already mentioned as decorated in fresco by Federigo Zuccaro.\r\nIts altar-picture was committed to Baroccio, the subject naturally\r\nbeing the Annunciation. This was in all respects a labour of love,\r\nthe theme being in perfect unison with his dulcet manner, and it was\r\naccordingly considered by himself his chef-d'oeuvre, a merit which,\r\nin the opinion of many, is shared by his Deposition, and, in that\r\nof Simon da Pesaro, by his Santa Michelina. Modern connoisseurs may\r\ndecide between the first and last of those three great works, as they\r\nhang side by side in the Vatican Gallery, the former of them, and\r\nthe Deposition, having been returned from Paris. The Annunciation is\r\ncertainly a very favourable and pleasing specimen of the Baroccesque\r\nmanner, but an eye versed in the criticism of sacred art must\r\ndemur to the judgment of Bellori, who found maiden humility in the\r\nVirgin, a celestial air in the angel, and spiritual character in the\r\ntinting. The principal figure is the portrait of a young lady of the\r\nCompagnoni of Macerata, whose features are equally devoid of purity\r\nand of noble expression; the colouring, though delicately beautiful\r\nin itself, is meretricious in effect, transmuting flesh into roses;\r\nand the whole sentiment of the picture is anything but devotional. On\r\nthe other hand, it is distinguished above a majority of his important\r\nworks by unity of composition, although, like most productions of\r\nhis age, the action is exaggerated and the details mannered. A\r\ncopy in mosaic was sent to replace this favourite effort, which was\r\noften reproduced by the master and his pupils. A repetition of it\r\nwas presented by Francesco Maria to the court of Spain, and another,\r\nleft unfinished, remains at Gubbio. The Santa Michelina, protectress\r\nof Pesaro, was painted for the church of S. Francesco there, and\r\nexhibits a striking deviation from this artist's wonted style. A\r\nsingle figure kneeling on Mount Calvary in ecstatic contemplation,\r\namid the war of convulsed elements, admitted of no paltry prettiness,\r\nand could scarcely fail to attain grandeur. There is, accordingly, in\r\nthe breadth of composition, and in the prevalent low neutral tone,\r\nan approach to severe art, inducing us to overlook the fluttering\r\ndraperies and girlish forms that belong to the master.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anderson_\r\n\r\nNOLI ME TANGERE\r\n\r\n_After the picture by Baroccio, once in the Ducal Collection at\r\nUrbino, now in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence_]\r\n\r\nRome possesses by a better title three other pictures deserving the\r\nnotice of those who desire to appreciate Baroccio. The Presentation\r\nof the Madonna (1594), and the Visitation, adorn the Chiesa Nuova,\r\nwhere the latter is said to have often inspired S. Filippo Neri's\r\ndevotions; the Institution of the Sacrament according to the Romish\r\nrite, in the church of the Minerva, was a present from the Duke of\r\nUrbino to Clement VIII., who conferred upon the painter a gold chain.\r\nIt is related that, in the original sketch, Satan was introduced,\r\nwhispering treason into the ear of Judas, but was afterwards omitted,\r\nin deference to his Holiness's opinion, that the Devil ought not\r\nto be represented as \"so much at ease in the Saviour's presence.\"\r\nOn occasion of the same Pontiff's visit to Urbino, in 1598, he\r\nreceived from his host a golden vase for holy water, beautifully\r\nchased, with a painting by Baroccio at the bottom, wherein the infant\r\nChrist, seated on the clouds, gives the benediction with one hand,\r\nand supports the globe with the other. This charming miniature so\r\ndelighted the Pope, that he had it removed from the benitier, and\r\naffixed to his daily office book.\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral of Urbino contains the latest of his great church\r\npictures, representing the Last Supper, as well as the St. Sebastian,\r\none of his early works, and it is interesting to contrast their\r\nrespective styles. The St. Sebastian was commissioned for 100 florins\r\nin 1557, whilst the inspirations of Rome still hovered over his\r\npalette, and imparted vigour to his already Correggesque manner. This\r\nhackneyed and generally harrowing subject is treated with pleasing\r\nnovelty, the group consisting of the saint, a graceful figure bound\r\nto a fig-tree, an imperious judge who has condemned him, and a brawny\r\narcher who carries the sentence into effect, whilst the Madonna\r\nand Child appear on high to support the martyr's faith and hope.\r\nIn the Cenacolo, the fair promise of that able production is sadly\r\nabandoned: all those great qualities of his predecessors, which he\r\nbegan by happily imitating, are there replaced by extravagance,\r\nand even harmony is absent from his multifarious tints. Of his\r\ninnumerable minor works we cannot pause to take note, and he scarcely\r\never painted in fresco. It is remarkable that, although his manner\r\nwas, even in its defects, well suited to the voluptuous character\r\nof mythological fable, and to many a scene of mundane grandeur, he\r\nlimited himself to sacred representations, almost the only exception\r\nbeing portraits. Of the latter, his most successful is Duke Francesco\r\nMaria, in rich armour, as he returned from the fight of Lepanto; it\r\nhas been deservedly honoured with a place in the Tribune at Florence,\r\nand an equally beautiful repetition adorns the Camuccini collection\r\nat Rome.\r\n\r\nThe amount of his labours is inconceivable, considering the constant\r\nsufferings which he is represented to have undergone, from an\r\nalmost total destruction of digestion, and habitual sleeplessness,\r\nconsequent upon having been poisoned at thirty-two years of age.\r\nThe large pictures we have mentioned are but few of those which he\r\nproduced, yet no artist was more painstaking. Bellori assures us\r\nthat he always prepared two cartoons and two coloured sketches,\r\ndrawing exclusively from the life, and made many studies of drapery,\r\nseparately perfecting his chiaroscuros from figures repeatedly\r\nmodelled by his own hands, ere he transferred them to his paper.\r\nSuch conscientious diligence could scarcely have been looked for in\r\nan artist whose works owe little to their outline, and may appear\r\nunnecessary to those who imitate his fusion only as a trick to mask\r\ndefective design. This peculiar quality of his colouring was likewise\r\nmatter of unwearied application, and he endeavoured to facilitate its\r\nresults by an artificial scale, corresponding to notes in music, as a\r\ntest for the gradation of his \"tuneful\" tints.\r\n\r\nThe merits of Baroccio consist in much variety and novelty of\r\nconception, in skilful management of his lights, and in the dexterous\r\nblending of strongly contrasted tints into a harmonious whole. The\r\nCorreggesque tone of his pictures admirably conformed to the soft\r\nand gentle turn of his character; but whilst his design is more\r\nexact, and his foreshortenings are more true, he wants the breadth\r\nof Correggio; though his lights are more silvery and superficially\r\nlucent, his chiaroscuro neither attains to the force nor the depth\r\nof his prototype. The peculiar beauty at which he constantly aimed\r\ndegenerates into a deformity; the almost cloying sweetness of his\r\nfaces produces in the spectator a surfeit, inducing a desire for\r\nsimpler fare. His figures are often deficient in self-possession,\r\nhis colouring in verity, his compositions in solidity and repose. In\r\na word, Baroccio shared the usual fate of eclectic painters, who,\r\ndistrusting their own resources, seek to make up a manner from the\r\ncombined excellences of their predecessors. Striving to engraft the\r\ngrace of the Parmese upon the design of the Roman school, he fell\r\ninto a flimsy mannerism, which, in straining after meretricious\r\ncharms, departs from dignity and devotional feeling.\r\n\r\nThe days were nearly over when genius loved to master several\r\nbranches of art; and it would have been better had our painter\r\nlimited his labours to the palette, and to spirited etchings from\r\nhis own compositions. At the command, however, of his sovereign,\r\nhe, in 1603, undertook to supply designs for a long-contemplated\r\nstatue of Duke Federigo; and Gaye gives us several of his letters\r\nregarding the difficulties of this commission, which baffled him for\r\nsix months. His great aim was to retain the peculiar character of the\r\nhead, without rendering prominent the unseemly defect in the eye and\r\nnose,--an object hitherto effected by portraying the old warrior only\r\nin profile. He worked chiefly from the bas-relief over the library\r\ndoor in the palace, and that at the church of S. Giovanni.[224] The\r\nexecution of his design was committed to Girolamo Campagna at Venice,\r\na sculptor of note, who cannot justly be held accountable for this\r\npoor and awkward performance. It was placed, in 1606, on the palace\r\nstairs at Urbino, where it remains.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 224: Carteggio, III., pp. 529-35. This medallion is now\r\nremoved from the library door to the first landing-place of the\r\ngreat stair. It may have been by the medallist, Clemente of Urbino,\r\nmentioned in vol. II.]\r\n\r\nBut for the misfortune of his broken health, Baroccio would have been\r\nas happy as his estimable character deserved. He was fortunate in\r\nhis temper, in his extended reputation, in his easy circumstances,\r\nin his multiplied orders, and in his many scholars. His infirmities\r\nprevented him from accepting flattering invitations to the courts of\r\nAustria, Spain, and Tuscany, but the friendship of his own sovereign\r\nnever failed him. Having fitted up in his house at Urbino a sort of\r\nexhibition room for his works, it was repeatedly visited by Francesco\r\nMaria, whose Diary not only mentions this, but notes his death and\r\nthat of his brother Simone, \"an excellent maker of compasses.\" On the\r\n1st of October, 1612, is this entry: \"Federigo Baroccio of Urbino\r\ndied, aged seventy-seven, an excellent painter, whose eye and hand\r\nserved him as well as in his youth.\" His real age seems to have\r\nbeen eighty-four, and there can be no doubt that he retained his\r\nfaculties, painting without spectacles, until struck at the last\r\nby apoplexy, a remarkable triumph of mind over protracted bodily\r\ninfirmities. Yet the deterioration of his later works, which may\r\nstill be seen at Urbino and Pesaro, sadly belies the Duke's tribute\r\nto his green old age. A list of many of those which he executed for\r\nthat kind patron will be found in the last number of our Appendix. At\r\nhis funeral in S. Francesco, a church standard, painted by himself,\r\nwith a Crucifixion, was placed at the foot of his bier: the tablet\r\ninscribed to his memory has been excluded in rebuilding the nave, but\r\nremains in the adjoining corridor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe popularity of Baroccio, both personally and as a painter,\r\nrecruited to his studio many young artists, eager to enter the path\r\nwhich he had successfully trodden. But the faults of his style were\r\nof a sort which imitation was sure to exaggerate, and the absence of\r\nsolid qualities in the master prevented the felicitous development\r\nof such talent as nature had granted to his pupils. We accordingly\r\nsearch in vain among his many scholars for a single name of eminence;\r\nand we might pass over the _Baroccisti_ without further notice,\r\nbut that a considerable proportion of them claim a passing word\r\nas natives of the duchy. ANTONIO VIVIANI, son of a baker\r\nat Urbino, was a favourite of his master, though probably not his\r\nnephew, as supposed by Lanzi. In early life, his productions imitated\r\nthose of Baroccio with great success, as may be seen at Fano and\r\nin various parts of the duchy, but on proceeding to Rome his style\r\nrapidly deteriorated. Emulating the flimsy and faulty manner of the\r\nCavaliere d'Arpino, by which high art was then fatally degraded,\r\nhe painted against time in the Vatican and Lateran palaces, as\r\nwell as on many altar commissions. These, when compared with other\r\ncontemporary trash, obtained a degree of applause which sounder\r\ncriticism is compelled to withhold from il Sordo, the nickname by\r\nwhich their author was generally known. But he sacrificed his art\r\nwithout improving his fortune; and an old age, passed in poverty, was\r\nclosed in disappointment and want. His brother Ludovico, \"wicked,\r\ngraceless, and disobedient, unworthy the name of son,\" had from his\r\nfather's will five farthings in lieu of his patrimony, and his career\r\nmaintained the prestige of this sad outset, both in his character and\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nALESSANDRO VITALE, born at Urbino in 1580, so completely caught the\r\namenity of his instructor's manner, as to be employed during his\r\nadvanced years to copy many of his works, which, with a few finishing\r\ntouches, passed as originals. ANTONIO CIMATORIO, _alias il Visacci_\r\nor the Ugly, was chiefly employed on festive and scenic decorations,\r\naided by GIULIO CESARE BEGNI of Pesaro: the latter went afterwards to\r\nVenice, and, devoting himself to better things, left not a few good\r\npictures in the March of Treviso. GIORGIO PINCHI of Castel Durante,\r\nand ANDREA LILLIO of Ancona, both approached the Baroccesque manner\r\nwith considerable success, and shared the labours of il Sordo on\r\nthe pontifical frescoes in Rome. Among those who carried the same\r\nstyle to a distance, may be named ANTONIO ANTONIANO of Urbino, who,\r\nafter aiding Baroccio with his great picture of the Crucifixion,\r\nwas sent by him with it to Genoa, and there settled. GIOVANNI and\r\nFRANCESCO, two brothers of Urbino, and probably offsets of this\r\nschool, emigrated to Spain, and painted in the Escurial, under the\r\npatronage of Philip II. FILIPPO BELLINI, a native of the same city,\r\nthough a pupil of Baroccio, adopted a more vigorous manner, but his\r\nworks are scarcely met with out of Umbria. To this catalogue it is\r\nenough to add the names of Francesco Baldelli, Lorenzo Vagnarelli,\r\nVentura Marza, Cesare Maggieri, Bertuzzi, and Porino, all born in\r\nthe duchy; and those of Bandiera and the Pellegrini of Perugia, the\r\nMalpiedi of La Marca, and the Cavaliere Francesco Vanni of Siena,\r\nthe latter of whom, though not among his scholars, so thoroughly\r\nadopted the peculiarities of Baroccio, as to be perhaps the happiest\r\nof his imitators. TERENZIO TERENZI of Urbino, known by the soubriquet\r\nof Rondinello, earned a dishonourable reputation by his successful\r\nimitations of the older masters, which he passed off as originals;\r\nand having fallen into merited disgrace with his kind patron, the\r\nCardinal of Montalto, in consequence of pawning upon him one of his\r\nforgeries as a Raffaele, he died of vexation in the first years of\r\nthe seventeenth century, aged thirty-five.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO RIDOLFI, though born in Verona in 1560, may be\r\nconsidered a subject of Urbino. His family was noble, but not rich,\r\nso adopting painting as a profession, he studied its principles under\r\nPaul Veronese, at Venice. But the temptations to idleness which\r\nbeset him at home so interfered with success that he resolved to\r\nescape from them. On his way to Rome he stayed some time at Urbino\r\nwith Baroccio, in whose glittering style he lost somewhat of the\r\nbetter manner of his early master. But his journey to the \"mother\r\nof arts and arms\" was interrupted by more powerful fascinations;\r\nfor he married a noble lady of Urbino, and settled at Corinaldo,\r\nsome miles above Sinigaglia, attracted by the beauty of its site,\r\nand fain to enjoy, in provincial retirement, exemption from the\r\njealousies and struggles which often beset artists in a city life,\r\nwhere tact or fortune are apt to confer a success denied to merit.\r\nThough he returned for a time to his native city, and painted many\r\nexcellent works in it, and in the principal towns of the Venetian\r\nstate, the charms of Corinaldo and his wife's influence induced him\r\nto spend there the greater part of a long life. He died in 1644,\r\naged, according to his namesake Carlo Ridolfi, eighty-four, or to\r\nTicozzi, seventy years. To the glowing tints of the Lombard school he\r\neventually added the merit of more accurate design; but his principal\r\nexcellences were a chastened composition, and a close attention to\r\nthe proprieties of costume, as contributing to a proper intelligence\r\nof the subject. A vast number of his productions are scattered over\r\nUmbria and La Marca, and there issued from his studio not a few\r\npupils of provincial eminence, most of whom tended considerably\r\ntowards the Baroccesque manner. Of those belonging to Urbino the most\r\nconspicuous was BENEDETTO MARINI, who, though scarcely known\r\nat home, produced many important works in Lombardy, and excelled in\r\nthe management of crowded compositions, such as his immense Miracle\r\nof the Loaves and Fishes, painted at Piacenza in 1625. Patanazzi\r\nand Urbinelli belong to a less distinguished category, and though\r\nGirolamo Cialderi is ranked with them by Lanzi, he seems referable to\r\na subsequent period.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGubbio continued in the sixteenth century to maintain a school which,\r\nthough acquiring little more than a provincial reputation, was not\r\nwithout merit. BENEDETTO NUCCI was born there about 1520,\r\nand, imbibing from Raffaelino del Colle certain inspirations of the\r\ngolden age, left in his native town many respectable church pictures.\r\nHe died in 1587, having seen his son Virgilio escape from his studio\r\nto place himself under Daniel di Volterra at Rome. Among his pupils,\r\nbut of ever progressive mediocrity, were FELICE DAMIANO\r\nand CESARE DI GIUSEPPE ANDREOLI, the latter an offset of a\r\nfamily whose eminence in the art of majolica will be mentioned in our\r\nfifty-fifth chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV\r\n\r\n     Foreign artists patronised by the dukes Della Rovere--The\r\n     tomb of Julius II. by Michael Angelo--Character and\r\n     influence of his genius--Titian's works for Urbino--Palma\r\n     Giovane--Il Semolei--Sculptors at Urbino.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would occupy a full chapter were we to trace the history of\r\nwhat Julius II. meant to have been his tomb, from the chisel of\r\nMichael Angelo Buonarroti; yet the subject is too illustrative of\r\nthat Pontiff's grandiose spirit, and of the artist's unfulfilled\r\naspirations, as well as too intimately connected with the ducal\r\nhouse of Urbino, to be overlooked. The work was commissioned by\r\nJulius himself, who, early in his pontificate, called Buonarroti\r\nfrom Florence to execute a resting-place for his ashes, which,\r\nin the words of Vasari, should \"surpass in beauty and grandeur,\r\nin imposing ornament and elaborate sculpture, all antique and\r\nimperial sepulchres.\" The vast size and colossal proportions of the\r\nfirst design were worthy of artist and patron, and cannot be at\r\nall estimated from the curtailed and aimless substitute which now\r\nchallenges our criticism. Yet there was exaggeration in the ideas as\r\nwell as the forms; the allegories were far-fetched, the adulation\r\nfulsome, and the intention obscure. Such at least is the impression\r\nleft by the descriptions of Vasari and Condivi. Without attempting\r\nto reconcile these with the sketch engraved in the Milanese edition\r\nof the former author [1811], it is enough to say that the original\r\nplan was an isolated parallelogram, with about ten statues and seven\r\ncaryatides on each façade, and a sarcophagus aloft for the Pope's\r\nbody, the estimate for all which seems to have been 10,000 ducats,\r\naugmented by his executors to 16,000. Its destined site was St.\r\nPeter's, and its utter disproportion in style and extent to that\r\ntime-worn basilicon appears to have suggested to the indomitable\r\nPontiff the vast idea of reconstructing the metropolitan church\r\nof Christendom. This more engrossing undertaking absorbed much of\r\nthe enterprise and materials destined for the tomb, so the latter\r\nremained unfinished at the death of Julius, who barely survived the\r\ncompletion of those Sistine frescoes to which he had transferred\r\nthe sculptor's reluctant labours. A new and reduced contract having\r\nbeen made by his executors for its completion, Buonarroti resumed it\r\nwith the preference due to a favourite work; but he sought in vain\r\nfor leisure to proceed with it on the accession of Leo X., who, by\r\na strange misapplication of his powers, sent him to work the marble\r\nquarries of Pietra Santa. Indeed, the executors failed to obtain\r\nimplement of his undertaking under either of the Medicean popes,\r\nalienated as these were from the della Rovere, and intent upon\r\notherwise employing the genius of their gifted countryman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nTHE COMMUNION OF THE APOSTLES\r\n\r\n_By Giusto di Gand, in the Palazzo Ducale Urbino._ (_From the Ducal\r\nCollection_)]\r\n\r\nAt length Francesco Maria I. took up the forgotten memorial of his\r\nuncle, whose over-ambition of monumental honours had meanwhile led\r\nto a total oversight of his place of sepulture. As early as 1525,\r\nwe find the Duke addressing complaints and threats to Buonarroti,\r\nwhom he charged with idleness, after receiving prepayment of his\r\nstipulated price, unaware apparently that he had been overborne by\r\nhigher authority, and thus compelled to employ himself on commissions\r\nless germane to his feelings and tastes. A misunderstanding in regard\r\nto the sums so advanced further complicated this unfortunate affair,\r\nwhich was throughout fraught with disappointment and annoyance to\r\nMichael Angelo. It slept on till 1532, when a further modification\r\nwas made of the plan to a single façade whereon six statues\r\nwere to be placed; but amid competing calls upon his \"fearless and\r\nfurious\" chisel or pencil, little progress was made in the next ten\r\nyears. Irritated by continual exercise of the papal control, such as\r\nhis independent spirit could ill brook, fretting at the uncongenial\r\nlabours often thrust upon him, and galled by repeated allegations\r\nagainst his gratitude and his integrity, Buonarroti turned his eyes\r\nto Urbino, as a home where his genius would be appreciated without\r\nsacrificing his freedom of action, and took steps to retire thither\r\nand redeem his pledge to the Duke. But in Paul III. he had a yet more\r\nexacting task-master, from whom there was no escape, and in November,\r\n1541, Cardinal Ascanio Parisani wrote to Duke Guidobaldo that the\r\nPope having commissioned the sculptor to paint the Last Judgment,\r\nwhich would occupy his undivided attention during several years, to\r\nthe exclusion of the monument, he had to propose, at the instance of\r\nhis Holiness, a new arrangement, whereby the statues for its reduced\r\ndesign, so far as not already finished by Michael Angelo, were\r\ncommitted to other artists, working upon his models and under his\r\neye. Yielding gracefully to the necessity of the case, the Duke wrote\r\nthe following letter.[225]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 225: There is a copy of it in the Magliabechiana Library,\r\nclass viii., No. 1392, to which Gaye has from other sources supplied\r\nthe date of 6th March, 1542. Carteggio, II., 289-309. From him,\r\nCiampi, Vasari, and Condivi, we have condensed the very confused\r\ndetails respecting the monument of Julius which have come down to us.]\r\n\r\n     \"Most excellent Messer Michelangiolo,\r\n\r\n     \"His Holiness having deigned to [inform] me of his urgent\r\n     desire to avail himself for some time of your labours,\r\n     in painting and decorating the new chapel he is making\r\n     in the Apostolic Palace, and I, esteeming and gratefully\r\n     acknowledging all service and satisfaction given to his\r\n     holiness as bestowed on myself, in order that you may\r\n     more freely give your mind to that matter, am perfectly\r\n     content that you place on the tomb of my uncle of blessed\r\n     memory, Pope Julius, those three statues already terminated\r\n     entirely by your hand, the Moses included. And in order,\r\n     as nearly as possible, to perfect the whole in terms of\r\n     our last stipulations, which, as I am informed, you are\r\n     anxious and ready to do, [I consent] that you commit the\r\n     execution of the other three statues to some good and\r\n     esteemed master, but after your own designs and under your\r\n     superintendence; relying confidently, from your good-will\r\n     to his sacred memory and to my house, that you will bring\r\n     the work to a satisfactory issue, and so contrive that it\r\n     shall be deemed most laudable, and in all respects worthy\r\n     of you. Such a result will fully satisfy me; and I again\r\n     beseech you to see to this, as conferring on me a special\r\n     obligation; offering myself at all times [ready] for all\r\n     your commands and pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nUnder this final alteration of his contract, Michael Angelo forthwith\r\nassigned to Raffaele da Montelupo the execution of his designs for\r\na Madonna with a Child in her arms, and for a prophet and a sibyl\r\nseated, at the price of 400 scudi; employing at the same time two\r\ndecorative stonecutters upon the ornamental details of the façade,\r\nat a cost of 800 more. The statues from his own hand were to be\r\nMoses, and two caryatides holding captives, who had been introduced\r\ninto the first plan, as allegorical of the cities in Romagna subdued\r\nby Julius. But, finding these too large for the reduced design, he\r\nproposed to substitute for them two other figures from his chisel,\r\nalready far advanced, and which he would entrust to be finished by\r\nothers at a cost of 200 scudi, his Moses being destined to stand\r\nbetween them. All this is stated by him in a petition to the Pope\r\nof 20th July, 1542. The two substituted statues were finished by\r\nBuonarroti, and, in the documents printed by Gaye, are named\r\nby him Active and Contemplative Life. This, however, is a free\r\ninterpretation of the allegory, the figures being, according to\r\nVasari, Leah and Rachel. The recumbent Pope was the wretched work of\r\none Maso di Bosco or Boscoli; and the prophet and sibyl by Montelupo\r\nare said to have greatly dissatisfied Michael Angelo. The two\r\nrejected caryatide prisoners found their way to Paris in the time\r\nof Francis I., and remain in the Louvre; another similar is in the\r\ngreat hall of the Palazzo Vecchio, at Florence; and some grandiose,\r\nhalf-blocked ideas, still to be seen here and there, whose rough\r\npower identifies them with Michael Angelo, may have belonged to his\r\noriginal plan. About the beginning of 1545, forty years after it had\r\nbeen undertaken, the work was placed in the Church of S. Pietro in\r\nVincoli, of which Julius had been Cardinal-presbyter. Though meant\r\nas his tomb, it is but his monument; for the bones of that imperious\r\nhigh priest have found a fitter resting-place in the grandest of\r\nChristian fanes, his own creation, and best memorial. Few works of\r\nart have occasioned greater variety of opinion. In his Lectures,\r\nFuseli has exposed several of his defects, and the impression it most\r\nfrequently leaves upon the spectator is thus aptly expressed by him\r\nin an Italian letter to the translator of Webb on the Beautiful:--\r\n\r\n\"In the Moses, Michael Angelo has sacrificed beauty to anatomical\r\nscience, and to his favourite passion for the terrible and the\r\ngigantic. If it be true that he looked at the arm of the famous\r\nLudovisi satyr, he probably, also, studied the head, in order to\r\ntransfer its character to the Moses, since both of them resemble that\r\nof an old he-goat. There is, notwithstanding, in the figure a quality\r\nof monstrous grandeur which cannot be denied to Buonarroti, and\r\nwhich, like a thunder-storm, presaged the bright days of Raffaele.\"\r\n\r\nThis monument must ever be regarded as but the epitome of a grand\r\ndesign, curtailed without scale or measurement, deformed by colossal\r\nportions from the original in combination with dwarfish details of\r\nits pigmy substitute, marred by incomplete allegories, and eked\r\nout by supposititious figures. Yet few will leave the spot without\r\nanother glance at the tremendous Moses, nor will any connoisseur\r\navert his gaze until the awful majesty of that one statue has\r\neclipsed the petty incongruities of its location. It is among those\r\nrare creations of man's mind which, rising above the standard\r\nof human forms and human sympathies, demand a loftier test. The\r\npervading sentiment alone challenges our intellectual regard, and\r\nbespeaks our verdict; yet with playful prodigality, the artist has\r\nlavished an ivory finish upon its details, without detracting from\r\nthe sublime character of the irate lawgiver.[226]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 226: A favourite workman of Buonarroti, often met with\r\nunder the patronymic Urbino, was Francesco Amadori di Colonello, of\r\nCastel Durante, who lived with him from 1530 to 1536. See GUALANDI,\r\n_Nuovo Raccolta di Lettere sulla Pittura_, I., 48-52.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough this work is the only link directly connecting Michael\r\nAngelo with the ducal house of Urbino, we may be allowed a passing\r\ntribute to that genius which has hammered huge rocks into colossal\r\ncompositions, and embodied themes the most difficult in forms the\r\nmost daring. Of the simple element of beauty we, indeed, find in him\r\nfew traces. Gentleness and pathos had no place either in his wayward\r\nspirit or in his works.[*227] Discarding the beau-ideal aimed at\r\nin antique sculpture, where movement was restrained by the observance\r\nof form, and passion modified to the measure of fair proportion, he\r\neither startled by impossible postures, gnarled limbs, and sturdy\r\ndeformity, or, in the words of Fuseli, \"perplexed the limbs of\r\ngrandeur with the minute ramifications of anatomy.\" Hence, when tried\r\nby the rules of art, many of his creations are found wanting; when\r\nsubmitted to the standard of pure taste, their faults become glaring.\r\nIn straining to shake off the trammels of manner, he often fell into\r\nmannerism the most infelicitous; and the impression too commonly left\r\non the spectator is that of energy wasted and talent misapplied. But\r\nhis mind was of that lofty cast which, soaring above common themes,\r\nand spurning conventional restrictions, substituted power for beauty,\r\nand challenged our wonder rather than our approbation. Awed by the\r\nsublimity of his ideas, we overlook their inadequate development,\r\nuntil, descending to details, we impugn the unfinished sketch, and\r\nhalf-chiselled marble, painfully reminded that superhuman gifts are\r\noften marred by very ordinary weaknesses.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *227: No? Consider then the Pietà of S. Pietro in Vaticano,\r\nthe unfinished Pietà of S. Maria del Fiore. All that Dennistoun says\r\nof Michelangelo is full of misunderstanding. For instance, he never\r\n\"startles\" though he may terrify one. It would be ridiculous to\r\ndefend him. His work is beautiful, with the beauty of the mountains\r\nin which he alone has found the spirit of man. His figures, half\r\nunveiled from the living rock, are like some terrible indictment\r\nof the world he lived in: an indictment of himself too, perhaps,\r\nof his contempt for things as they are; it is in a sort of rage at\r\nits uselessness that he leaves them unfinished. In him the spirit\r\nof man has stammered the syllables of eternity, and in its agony\r\nof longing or sorrow has failed to speak only the word love. All\r\nthings particular to the individual, all that is small or of little\r\naccount, that endures but for a moment, he has purged away, so\r\nthat life itself may make, as it were, an immortal gesticulation\r\nalmost monstrous in its passionate intensity--a shadow seen on the\r\nmountains, a mirage on the snow.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anderson_\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI AND FEDERICO, ELECTORS OF SAXONY\r\n\r\n_After the Portraits by Cranach, once in the Ducal Collection at\r\nUrbino, now in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence_]\r\n\r\nNo one, perhaps, fully aware of Michael Angelo's celebrity, ever\r\nlooked for the first time upon one of his principal works without\r\na shade of disappointment. Inventions appealing to the intellect\r\nwithout sympathy from the feelings,--attitudes struggling with\r\ndifficulty rather than aiming at elegance,--muscular masses, rugged\r\nas the blocks from which they are rudely hewn; such things surpass\r\nthe comprehension of superficial observers, and disenchant common\r\nminds. Yet there is a spell around all of them which arrests the most\r\ncareless, and recalls the most disappointed, and the longer they\r\nare examined, especially by persons of cultivated understanding,\r\nthe more certain will be the final tribute to their transcendent\r\nqualities, the more unreserved the avowal that their author stands\r\nout among the foremost geniuses whom the world has seen. Feebleness\r\nor insipidity had no place in his conceptions, and no individual\r\never left the impress of his vigorous mind upon so many various\r\narts. He was a poet of no mean pretensions. His architecture is as\r\nsuccessful as bold. It is difficult to say whether his frescoes\r\nor his sculptures are the more admirable. Even his oil paintings\r\nare worthy of more notice than they have met with; and, the few\r\nascertained specimens display a mastery of finish little to be looked\r\nfor from their wayward and impetuous author, and develop in their\r\nexecution, as well as in their design, an extraordinary pictorial\r\nscience. The trite assertion that he never painted but three easel\r\npictures seems fully negatived by the mechanical perfection which,\r\nnotwithstanding a certain languor of colouring and flatness of\r\nsurface, these exhibit, and which must have been gained by extensive\r\npractice. In his house, even a miniature on parchment is shown as\r\nhis work; and not a few tiny productions in bronze and ivory bear\r\nthe stamp of his invention, if not of his hand. These were probably\r\nlabours of those early days when, with equal verity and shrewdness\r\nthe Gonfaloniere Soderini recommended him to the Roman court as \"a\r\nfine young man, unequalled in his art throughout Italy, or perhaps\r\nthe world. He will do anything for good words and caresses; indeed,\r\nhe must be treated with affection and favour, in which case he will\r\nperform things to astonish all beholders.\"[228] In the sacristy of\r\nS. Lorenzo, at Florence, these anticipations were amply realised on\r\nthe monuments of two of the Medici, with whom an earlier portion of\r\nthese pages has made us acquainted. These works were, however, no\r\nlabour of love to the sculptor, whose sympathies had been alien to\r\nthat race from the days when Pietro ceased to walk in the ways of\r\nhis fathers. Accordingly, their greatest fault is, that the artist\r\nabsorbs our interest almost to the exclusion of the personages\r\ncommemorated, to whom the allegorical compositions appear to have\r\nno reference. It is, indeed, only their portraits that recall the\r\npurpose of the monuments. That of the elegant and gentle Giuliano\r\nawakens no association that might not be suggested by the statue\r\nof some nameless warrior of the classic age. More appropriate is\r\nthe bearing of Lorenzo, the usurper of Urbino. The stern gloom that\r\nbroods over his casque, and shadows his repulsive features, scowling\r\nupon the world from whose sympathies he seems a voluntary alien,\r\nis an enduring index of his unamiable character. But it is in the\r\nSistine chapel that Buonarroti sits pre-eminent. Who that stands\r\nbeneath its grand frescoes can doubt the daring, the originality, and\r\ngrasp of his genius, who triumphantly called into existence forms and\r\nmovements before which ordinary minds shrink into pigmy dimensions?\r\nYet, who that observes the rapid decline of the Michael-Angelesque\r\nschool into mannered contortion and extravagant caricature, can\r\nquestion its mischievous influence, or the danger of opening up\r\nsuch fields to uninspired labourers? On both sides of the Alps, its\r\nfollowers or imitators, mistaking extravagance for energy, manner\r\nfor power, and servilely substituting exceptional attitudes for the\r\nsublimity of nature and the dignity of repose, have copied his design\r\nwithout imbibing his spirit, and have embodied feeble conceptions in\r\npreposterous forms.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 228: See Gaye, _Carteggio_, II., 83-109, sub anno 1506.]\r\n\r\nFreely have we spoken of a name to whom all honour is due, whose\r\nfailings may be noted as a warning, without diminishing our respect\r\nfor his manifold attainments. Our readers may appreciate his success\r\nas a poet through Mr. Glassford's felicitous version of a sonnet\r\nworthy the noblest of art's disciples.[*229]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *229: Cf. J.A. SYMONDS, _The Sonnets of Michelangelo_.]\r\n\r\n     \"Now my fair bark through life's tempestuous flood\r\n       Is steered, and full in view that port is seen,\r\n       Where all must answer what their course has been,\r\n       And every work be tried, if bad or good.\r\n     Now do those lofty dreams, my fancy's brood,\r\n       Which made of ART an idol and a queen,\r\n       Melt into air; and now I feel, how keen!\r\n       That what I needed most I most withstood.\r\n     Ye fabled joys, ye tales of empty love,\r\n       What are ye now, if twofold death be nigh?\r\n       The first is certain, and the last I dread.\r\n     Ah! what does Sculpture, what does Painting prove,\r\n       When we have seen the Cross, and fixed our eye\r\n       On Him whose arms of love were there outspread!\"\r\n\r\nThe home patronage of the della Rovere dukes was, however, by no\r\nmeans limited to their subjects, and TITIAN[*230] enjoyed\r\nhigh favour from the first two sovereigns of that dynasty. The\r\ncoronation of Charles V., in 1532, having attracted to Bologna a\r\nconcourse of distinguished persons, Titian, then in his fifty-fifth\r\nyear, was honoured by an imperial invitation to join the throng. The\r\nmonarch, himself reputed no mean craftsman, delighted to pass what\r\ntime he could snatch from business, in conversing with the painter,\r\nand observing his progress, till one day, having picked up a fallen\r\npencil, he returned it, saying, \"Titian deserves to be waited on by\r\nan Emperor.\" The Duke of Urbino, who may have known the Venetian\r\nin his native city, was among the sovereigns and cardinals whose\r\ncommissions on that occasion contended for preference, and but a\r\nshort time, probably, elapsed ere his own and his consort's portraits\r\nwere produced,[*231] although Vasari and Ridolfi have erroneously\r\nfixed their date in 1543, five years after Francesco Maria's death.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *230: For Titian, consult GRONAU, _Titian_ (Duckworth,\r\n1904). By far the best handbook on the painter.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *231: As before stated, the first works that Titian painted\r\nfor Francesco Maria were a portrait of Hannibal, a Nativity, a figure\r\nof our Lord. The Duke writes him concerning them in 1533 as follows\r\n(cf. GRONAU, _op. cit._, p. 91):--\r\n\r\n     \"Dearest Friend,--\r\n\r\n     \"You know through our envoy how much we wish for pictures\r\n     ... and the longer we have to wait the more eager we are to\r\n     have them ... and so we beg you to satisfy us as soon as\r\n     possible. Finish at least one of the pictures, that we may\r\n     rejoice in something by your hand.\"\r\n\r\nThe portraits were begun in 1536, in which year (October) Aretino\r\nwrote a sonnet on that of the Duke. They were finished early in 1538.\r\nOf the earlier pictures, the figure of Christ is probably that in the\r\nPitti Gallery (228); the others apparently have perished.\r\n\r\nIn 1536 the Duke wrote again asking for a _Resurrection_ for the\r\nDuchess, and begging Titian to finish the \"picture of a woman in a\r\nblue dress as beautifully as possible.\" This latter is probably the\r\n_Bella_ of the Pitti Gallery (18), which some have thought to be\r\nEleonora Gonzaga, Francesco Maria's wife. She was then forty-three\r\nyears old, and her portrait was painted at this time by the same\r\nmaster (Uffizi, 599) as a companion for that of the Duke (Uffizi,\r\n605).\r\n\r\nDuke Guidobaldo, while yet but Duke of Camerino, had sat to Titian,\r\nand had bought from him the picture of a \"Nude Woman\" (GRONAU, _op.\r\ncit._, p. 95). In March, 1538, he sent a messenger to Venice, who\r\nwas instructed not to leave the city without them. He got one, but\r\nthe other had not been delivered in May of that year. The Duke wrote\r\nto him to beware lest it passed elsewhere, \"for I am resolved to\r\nmortgage a part of my property if I cannot obtain it in any other\r\nway.\" This picture was probably the _Venus_ of the Tribune (Uffizi,\r\n1117) who is so like the _Bella_. Now if we are right in supposing\r\nthe pictures alluded to in the letters--the lady in the blue dress\r\nand the nude woman--are the pictures we know (which came from\r\nUrbino), it seems obvious that they cannot have been portraits of the\r\nDuchess. And, again, we have the Duchess's portrait painted at this\r\ntime, in which we see a woman of forty-three, which was in truth her\r\nage.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1539, Guidobaldo, Duke of Urbino now, received three\r\nportraits, of the Emperor, the King of France, and the Turkish\r\nSultan, from Titian. Vasari speaks of them, but they have been lost.\r\nIn 1542-44 he painted a banner for the Brotherhood of Corpus Domini\r\nat Urbino--the Resurrection and the Last Supper. The pictures were\r\nshortly afterwards framed, and are now in the Urbino Gallery (10).\r\nThen in November, 1546, Duchess Giulia Varana of Urbino writes\r\nimpatiently to Titian, sending at the same time some sleeves he had\r\nasked for, and hoping that he will not delay longer to finish \"our\r\nportraits\" (GRONAU, _op. cit._, p. 99). And letters of Aretino in\r\n1545 confirm the fact that Titian was painting portraits of the Duke\r\nand Duchess. Then in February, 1547, one of the courtiers of Urbino\r\nsent Titian a dress of the Duchess, adding that \"a handsomer one\r\nwould have been sent if he had not wished for one of crimson or pink\r\nvelvet\"; a damask one was sent of the desired colour. The portrait by\r\nTitian in the State Apartments of the Pitti Palace, discovered only a\r\nfew years ago, is said to be of Catherine de' Medici, by Tintoretto.\r\nIt is, however, certainly Titian's (GRONAU, _op. cit._, p. 100),\r\nand is probably the missing portrait of the Duchess Giulia. It is\r\nunfinished, and the dress is of rose colour. It is one of his finest\r\nportraits.\r\n\r\nThere were two portraits at least of Guidobaldo by Titian, one\r\nof 1538 and one of 1545; one of these is said to have been in\r\nFlorence in the seventeenth century. Gronau suggests that the \"Young\r\nEnglishman\" of the Pitti Gallery (92), the finest portrait even\r\nTitian ever painted, may be one of them. But I cannot persuade myself\r\nthat that figure is other than English. Yet if it be, it might well\r\ncompanion the Bella.\r\n\r\nIn 1545 Titian, on his way to Rome, travelled by Ferrara and Pesaro,\r\nwhere Guidobaldo, who had accompanied him, entertained him and made\r\nhim many presents, sending a company of horse with him to Rome. There\r\nfollows an interval of twenty years, in which their friendship seems\r\nnot altogether to have been forgotten. Then between 1564 and 1567\r\nTitian painted several pictures for Guidobaldo, among them a \"Christ\"\r\nand a \"Madonna\"; in 1573 he apparently had another commission. It is\r\nimpossible to say what these pictures may have been.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anderson_\r\n\r\nLA BELLA\r\n\r\n_After the picture by Titian in the Pitti Gallery. Florence. Supposed\r\nportrait of Duchess Leonora_]\r\n\r\nFew of Titian's likenesses have been more lauded than the Duke's,\r\nboth as regards truth and execution; but we shall quote only the\r\ntestimony of Aretino, who knew well the painter and his subject.\r\n\"In gazing upon it, I called Nature to witness, making her confess\r\nthat Art was positively metamorphosed into herself; and to this,\r\neach wrinkle, each hair, each spot bears testimony, whilst the\r\ncolouring not only exhibits vigour of person, but displays manliness\r\nof mind. The vermilion hue of that velvet drapery behind him is\r\nreflected in the lustrous armour he wears. How fine the effect of his\r\ncasquet-plumes, reproduced on the burnished cuirass of the mighty\r\ngeneral! Even his batons of command are perfect nature, chiefly that\r\nof his own adventure, thus budding on the faith of his renown, which\r\nbegan to shed its glories in the war which humbled his private foe.\r\nWho would assert that the truncheons confided to him by the Church,\r\nVenice, and Florence, were not of silver?\"[232] In Aretino's letter\r\nwere enclosed two sonnets on the portrait and its companion; they\r\nwill be found in the Appendix, No. XI., together with one in which\r\nBernardo Tasso appeals to Titian for a likeness of his lady-love.\r\nAretino's lines regarding the Duke may be thus literally rendered:--\r\n\r\n     \"Fear on the crowd from either eyebrow falls;\r\n     Fire in his glance, and pride upon his front,\r\n     The spacious seat of honour and resolve.\r\n     Beneath that bust of steel, with arm prepared,\r\n     Burns valour, prompt all peril to repel,\r\n     From sacred Italy, that on his worth relies.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 232: The style of Aretino was often rugged, wayward, and\r\nunintelligible, like his character. He seems to imagine that, of the\r\nthree batons placed behind the Duke, one, bearing acorns and oak\r\nleaves, alludes to his successful campaigns on his own account, for\r\nrecovery of his states. _Lettere Pittoriche_, I., App. No. 29. The\r\nforce of colour peculiar to this, above all Titian's works, cannot be\r\nfully given by the burin, especially not by the _mezza macchia_ style\r\nin which it has been engraved for this volume. Our frontispiece,\r\nthough accurate as a likeness, is accordingly among the least\r\neffective illustrations in our work. No other original portrait of\r\nthe Duke has fallen under my observation; and if the slight youthful\r\nfigure introduced by Raffaele into the Disputa and School of Athens\r\nreally was meant for him, no resemblance can be traced in it.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anderson_\r\n\r\nTHE VENUS OF URBINO\r\n\r\n_Supposed portrait of the Duchess Leonora, after the picture by\r\nTitian in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence. Once in the Ducal Collection_]\r\n\r\nThe other sonnet, descriptive of Leonora's likeness, alludes to\r\nthe master's harmonious tints as figuring varied charms met in her\r\ncharacter, such as humility of disposition, decorum in dress and\r\nmanners, sustained by a dignified expression. In her features, beauty\r\nunited with modesty, a rare combination; and grace was enthroned on\r\nher eyebrows. Prudence presided over her becoming silence, and other\r\nexcellent qualities marvellously adorned her forehead. Nor are these\r\npraises exaggerated. Those who attentively observe this portrait in\r\nthe Uffizi Gallery will readily acknowledge that, although, perhaps,\r\nmore elaborated in its details than any other from the master's hand,\r\nhis pencil never attained greater breadth, nor embodied high art in\r\nmore severe character.[233]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 233: The _zebellino_ on the Duchess's knee was the\r\nfashionable bag or reticule of that day, made of an entire\r\nsable-skin, the animal's head, richly jewelled, forming its clasp.\r\nGiulia della Rovere d'Este commissioned such a one from a jeweller at\r\nBologna in 1555, and paid him forty-six dollars to account.]\r\n\r\nThe connection thus formed by Titian with the house of Urbino was\r\nmaintained after the accession of Duke Guidobaldo, through whom Paul\r\nIII. invited him to Bologna in 1543, where he painted that Pontiff\r\nwith his wonted success. About the same time the Duke commissioned\r\nfrom him a likeness of himself, which was finished two years later.\r\nThe misfortune sustained by its disappearance may be appreciated\r\nfrom the words of Aretino, who, writing to Guidobaldo, says, \"For he\r\nhas so embodied in his colours the very air you breathe, that in the\r\nsame attitude as you at this instant appear to others at Vicenza, we\r\nnow behold you in Venice, where we circle, bow, and pay court to you,\r\njust as do your suite who are in waiting upon you there.\" Vecellio\r\nlived among men whose talents, and fame, and forms, and dress\r\ndeserved commemoration; and to such he did justice, for painter and\r\nsitters were worthy of each other, conferring a mutual and enduring\r\nillustration. His pencil, and those of his followers, were singularly\r\nhappy in preserving individual character, although wanting in\r\nideality and intense expression. But their great excellence displayed\r\nitself in the representation of voluptuous scenes, adapted alike to\r\ntheir glowing tints and the taste of their countrymen.\r\n\r\nIn 1545, Titian repaired to Rome, at the request of Cardinal\r\nAlessandro Farnese, visiting Urbino[*234] on the way, and receiving\r\nseveral commissions which he could not stay to execute. Setting\r\nforward on his journey, he was conducted by Guidobaldo in person to\r\nPesaro, and thence by an escort to Rome. The impression left upon\r\nthe painter in this passage is thus described to the Duke, by his\r\nfriend Aretino:--\"Titian writes me, 'Worship the Lord Guidobaldo,\r\ngossip!--worship him, I say, gossip! for no princely bounty\r\ncan compare with his.' And these exclamations are his grateful\r\nacknowledgment of the mounted escort of seven attendants which your\r\nExcellency provided for him, with good company, and all paid; over\r\nand above the ease wherewith, amid caresses, honours, and gifts, you\r\nmade him feel quite at home. I was, indeed, melted by the account he\r\ngave me of your marvellous efforts to benefit, honour, and welcome\r\nhim.\" We have, to the like purpose, the less exceptionable testimony\r\nof Bembo, who, on the 10th of October, wrote to Girolamo Querini: \"I\r\nmust add that your old friend Maestro Tiziano is here, who represents\r\nhimself as much beholden to you.... The Lord Duke of Urbino has\r\ntreated him with exceeding kindness, retaining him about his person,\r\nand bringing him as far as Pesaro, and thence forwarding him thither,\r\nwell mounted and attended, for all which he acknowledges himself\r\nunder great obligations.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote *234: Apparently he only went to Pesaro. Cf. note *2, p.\r\n390.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anderson_\r\n\r\nSLEEPING VENUS\r\n\r\n_After the picture by Giorgione in the Dresden Gallery, after which\r\nthe Venus of Urbino was painted_]\r\n\r\nVasari mentions, as executed by Titian for the court of Urbino,\r\nportraits of Popes Sixtus IV., Julius II., and Paul III.; of Charles\r\nV., Francis I., Sultan Solyman, and the Cardinal of Lorraine. I\r\nhave not succeeded in tracing any of these with certainty, but two\r\nhalf-lengths of beautiful women, added to the list by Ticozzi, may\r\nprobably be the Flora[*235] now in the Uffizi Gallery, and the Bella\r\nin the Pitti Palace: their features exhibit considerable analogy\r\nwith each other, and with the former of two pictures we are now\r\nto describe. In the last number of the Appendix we shall rectify\r\nvarious errors regarding Titian's two celebrated Venuses in the\r\nTribune at Florence. One of them, painted for Guidobaldo II., has\r\nno proper right to that title, being correctly called in the old\r\nUrbino inventories, \"a naked woman lying.\" She is stretched at full\r\nlength along a bed, on which is a linen sheet, with a green curtain\r\nabove. A tiny spaniel crouches at her feet, and two waiting-maids\r\nare searching in a chest near an open balcony, for garments\r\nwherewith to veil her all-exposed charms. The languor of her eye,\r\nthe listless attitudes into which her limbs have dropped, personify\r\nvoluptuousness, and express a mind quietly gloating over the past. A\r\ncertain harmony and warmth of tone, fused throughout the vast surface\r\nof delicate flesh-tints and snowy linen, over which broad daylight\r\nstreams without shadow, are worthy of our highest admiration; and the\r\nrelief given to the figure, with little aid from the chiaroscuro, is\r\nprobably unrivalled. The companion picture, which was not, however,\r\nexecuted for Urbino, represents an equally nude figure on a couch\r\nof purple damask, near a balcony opening upon a distant landscape.\r\nThe boy of love, archly toying upon her bosom, decides the subject\r\nto be Venus; and her glowing eye-ball expresses the ardour that\r\nthrills through her veins. The full and solid flesh is true to those\r\ndeveloped forms which, still characterising the women about Treviso,\r\nformed the standard of female perfection in Titian's studio; and\r\nalthough the skill with which they undulate, softened by chiaroscuro,\r\ndemands all praise, there may yet be some who, dissenting from such\r\nan ideal of beauty, wish this mortal mould had been refined into the\r\nsymmetry of that \"perfect goddess-ship\" which close by \"loves in\r\nstone.\" Having thus noticed these nudities, it may be well to add,\r\nthat the shameless Aretino, while boasting of his own unrestrained\r\ndebaucheries, bears testimony to the purity of Titian's morals, and\r\nthe habitual control under which his passions were maintained.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *235: It seems unlikely that the _Flora_ was ever in\r\nUrbino. At any rate, in the seventeenth century it was in the\r\ncollection of the Spanish ambassador at Amsterdam (cf. GRONAU, _op.\r\ncit._, p. 289).]\r\n\r\nAs an antidote, perhaps, to so sensual a production, Titian sent\r\nto Urbino, with his Venus, a picture offering the utmost contrast\r\nin sentiment and artistic treatment. It was the first of those\r\nMagdalens,[*236] frequently repeated by him with slight variations,\r\nof whom not a few school copies may be seen passing for originals.\r\nRidolfi tells us that he caught the idea from an antique sculpture,\r\ntransforming it into a penitent daughter of sin. Yet he has treated\r\nit according to those ideas of female beauty which it was the\r\npeculiar province of the Venetian school to develop, and which in\r\nItaly have passed into the proverbial phrase of _un bel pezzo di\r\ncarne_, meaning a buxom dame. To borrow the words of Ticozzi, \"he\r\nhas represented a noble lady, who, while yet in her prime, had\r\nabandoned the delights and delicacies of her station. With due regard\r\nto her past position, he has lavished upon her the beauties of form\r\nand complexion; her repentance he has characterised with the most\r\ndevoted expression of which art is capable.\" The ascetic sentiment\r\nprevailing in this work is well adapted to the sympathies of the\r\nRoman Church, among whose followers it has ever been more a favourite\r\nthan with Protestant amateurs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *236: Pitti Gallery, No. 67. We know nothing of this\r\npicture save that it must have been painted about 1530-35, and that\r\nVasari saw it in the Guardaroba of the Palace of Urbino.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTRAIT OF HIS WIFE, BY LUCAS CRANACH\r\n\r\n_From the picture in the Roscoe Collection, Liverpool. Possibly\r\nmodelled on the Venus of Urbino_]\r\n\r\nOur notice of Titian in connection with the court of Urbino, may be\r\nclosed by a letter, which, in the servile phrase of this century,\r\nventures thus to dun Guidobaldo for payment of a picture sent him\r\nfive months before:--\r\n\r\n     \"To the most illustrious and most excellent Lord, the Lord\r\n     Duke of Urbino.\r\n\r\n     \"Most illustrious and most excellent Lord,\r\n\r\n     \"Very many days have now passed since your most illustrious\r\n     Excellency desired that I should be advised how your\r\n     [servant] Agatone ought to have remunerated me for the\r\n     picture which I sent to your most illustrious Excellency.\r\n     Which he not having done, although six months are nearly\r\n     elapsed since the 10th of March, but having only put me off\r\n     with words, I have chosen to take the step of informing\r\n     your illustrious Excellency by these lines, that your\r\n     boundless liberality may aid my necessity, though I admit\r\n     that I may thereby appear wanting in modesty. I know\r\n     that your illustrious Excellency, occupied by important\r\n     affairs, cannot have your mind distracted by such trifles,\r\n     yet I consider it my duty respectfully to let you know my\r\n     difficulty; and beseeching you to retain me in your wonted\r\n     favour, I humbly kiss your most distinguished hands. From\r\n     Venice, the 27th of October, 1567. Your most illustrious\r\n     Excellency's most humble servant,\r\n\r\n     \"TITIANO VECELLIO.\"\r\n\r\nIn one of his visits to Venice, about 1559, Guidobaldo, chancing to\r\nenter a church of the Crociferi, where a youth was engaged in copying\r\nthe St. Laurence of Titian, he entered into conversation with him,\r\nand subsequently returned more than once to observe his progress.\r\nOn one of these occasions, while the Duke was hearing mass at a\r\nneighbouring altar, the young artist seized the opportunity to sketch\r\nhis likeness, which was shown him by an attendant. Pleased with its\r\nsuccess, and with the painter's manners, he invited him to enter his\r\nservice. The object of this casual patronage proved not unworthy of\r\nit. He was JACOPO PALMA the younger, a name already known to art;\r\nfor his grandfather, who bore it, had distinguished himself among\r\nthe scholars of Giorgione and Titian; and his aunt, Violante, was\r\nmistress and favourite model of the latter. Palma Giovane, then in\r\nhis sixteenth year, accompanied the Duke to Pesaro, where he employed\r\nhis pencil in copying works of Raffaele and Titian. The only anecdote\r\npreserved of his residence in the court of Urbino proves that he\r\ncontinued to enjoy his patron's favour; for, in a dispute with the\r\nhouse-steward as to his luncheon, the latter was ordered to treat\r\nthe youth with more consideration. In order to obtain for him every\r\nadvantage, the Duke sent him to the charge of his brother, Cardinal\r\ndella Rovere, at Rome. After there diligently studying antique\r\nmarbles, with the works of Michael Angelo and those of Polidoro di\r\nCaravaggio, Palma, at twenty-four, returned to Venice. On his way,\r\nhe paid a visit of thanks to Guidobaldo, and by his works removed\r\ncertain unfavourable impressions made by unfriendly detractors in\r\nhis absence. Of those which he may have executed for this court, no\r\naccount has reached us, beyond a notice that Francesco Maria II.\r\npaid him, at Venice, 1591, 86 scudi for a Madonna and a St. Francis,\r\nwhich do not, however, appear in the wardrobe inventories. He painted\r\nfor the metropolitan cathedral at Urbino the Discovery of the Holy\r\nCross, a picture praised by Lanzi beyond its merits; and for Pesaro,\r\na S. Ubaldo, and the Annunciation.\r\n\r\nAnother Venetian, patronised by Guidobaldo, was GIANBATTISTA\r\nFRANCO, surnamed _il Semolei_, who was brought to Urbino on\r\na recommendation of Girolamo Genga, in order to paint the choir\r\nof the cathedral. He there treated the favourite Umbrian theme of\r\nthe Coronation of the Madonna in a manner utterly at variance with\r\nthe old feeling, taking as his prototype the Judgment of Michael\r\nAngelo, of whom he was a devoted and assiduous imitator. This work\r\nhaving been destroyed by the fall of the roof in 1789, we shall\r\ncontent ourselves with the description of Vasari, who had seen it,\r\nand whose leaning must have been favourable to a work produced under\r\nsuch influence. \"And so, in imitation of Buonarroti's Judgment, he\r\nrepresented in the sky the glorification of the saints, scattered on\r\nclouds over the roof, with a whole choir of angels around our Lady,\r\nin the act of ascending to heaven, where Christ waited to crown her,\r\nwhilst a number of patriarchs, prophets, sibyls, apostles, martyrs,\r\nconfessors, and maidens, in varied groups and attitudes, manifested\r\ntheir joy at the arrival of the glorious Virgin. This subject might\r\nhave afforded to Battista an excellent opportunity of proving his\r\nability, had he adopted a better plan, not only in the practical\r\nmanagement of his fresco, but in conducting his entire theme with\r\nmore judicious arrangement. But in this work he fell into his usual\r\nsystem, constantly repeating the same faces, figures, draperies, and\r\nextremities. The colouring was likewise utterly destitute of beauty,\r\nand everything was strained and puny. Hence the work, when finished,\r\ngreatly disappointed the Duke, Genga, and every one, much having been\r\nexpected from his known capacity for design.\" Several easel pictures\r\nof his, in the sacristy of the Duomo, are weak in composition and\r\npoor in colour; but one of St. Peter and St. Paul, before the Madonna\r\nand Child, is an exceedingly grandiose production, in the Buonarroti\r\nstyle. We shall have further occasion to speak of this artist in\r\nour next chapter. He was born about 1498, and lived to the age of\r\nsixty-three; but aware of his deficiencies as a painter, he betook\r\nhimself in a great measure to engraving, for which his accuracy as a\r\ndraftsman well qualified him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn absence of native sculptors of eminence, the plastic art never\r\nwas much cherished in our duchy, and few commissions were given,\r\nexcept for decorative or monumental purposes. The festive arches\r\non Duchess Vittoria's marriage were probably designed by Tiziano\r\nAspetti, a bronzist of Upper Italy. Her husband having acquired a\r\nLeda by Bartolomeo Ammanati of Florence, he was called to Urbino, to\r\nconstruct a memorial for Francesco Maria I. It does not, however,\r\nappear to have been successful, and being quite disproportioned to\r\nthe little octangular church of Sta. Chiara, of which it occupied the\r\ncentre, it was removed after the Devolution, and probably destroyed.\r\nSEBASTIANO BECIVENNI of Mercatello, was celebrated as a\r\ndecorative sculptor, and his dexterity is attested by two pulpits\r\nin the duomo at Arezzo, dated 1563. In 1581, Francesco Maria II.\r\ncommissioned two small statues from John of Bologna, and in the\r\nfollowing year his minister at Rome wrote, proposing to send him a\r\nminiature painter from thence, at a monthly salary of ten golden\r\nscudi, besides board and travelling expenses. Late in life, he had\r\nhis own and his father's portraits executed in mosaic by Luigi\r\nGaetano at Venice. The statue of Duke Federigo, which we have already\r\nmentioned as modelled by Baroccio, was executed for this Duke by\r\nGirolamo Campagna of Venice, and one of his grandfather, attired\r\nas a Roman warrior, leaning on his baton of command, and resting\r\nupon a stump, was the work of Giovanni Bandini of Florence, an\r\neminent scholar of Bandinelli. After his sovereignty had virtually\r\npassed from the bereaved Duke, he disposed of this memorial of its\r\nbrighter days in a touching letter to the Doge of Venice, which\r\nfinely illustrates the resignation beautifully exemplified in all the\r\ncorrespondence of his latter years:--\r\n\r\n     \"Most serene Prince,\r\n\r\n     \"My grandfather, the Lord Duke Francesco Maria, was during\r\n     life honoured by your serene state with such high authority\r\n     and dignities, that, even after his decease, its esteem\r\n     and favour have ever been specially exhibited towards\r\n     his posterity and race; in these, now about to close in\r\n     my person, your Highness will lose a line of supporters\r\n     whose services are well known to you. Yet, being unwilling\r\n     that these good offices should pass entirely from memory,\r\n     I have resolved to present to the serene Republic and\r\n     your Highness, the statue which I erected in testimony of\r\n     dutiful respect to my said grandfather; for nowhere can\r\n     it be more fittingly placed than in your renowned city.\r\n     I therefore herewith send it to you, and with the more\r\n     pleasure from knowing that your state will gladly receive\r\n     the portrait of one who so faithfully served it, and who,\r\n     though no longer able to do so directly, will, virtually\r\n     and by example, demonstrate how your Republic ought to\r\n     be served. It will, at all events, afford irrefragable\r\n     evidence of his attachment to that cause for which he would\r\n     have desired longer life, and will prove a sure token of\r\n     my unbounded devotion to your Highness, which, indeed, I\r\n     cannot more fittingly demonstrate: beseeching, however,\r\n     that your Highness will regard this act as a solemn\r\n     testimony of the old and continued love of my house for\r\n     your distinguished state, which God preserve as long as my\r\n     unbounded wishes; and so I kiss your Highness's hands with\r\n     devoted affection.\r\n\r\n     \"Your Highness's most devoted son and servant,\r\n\r\n     \"FRANCESCO MARIA DELLA ROVERE, DUKE.[237]\r\n\r\n     \"From Castel Durante, this ..., 1625.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 237: _Carteggio d'Artisti_, vol. III., 540.]\r\n\r\nThe statue now stands in the court of the Doge's ducal palace, thus\r\ninscribed: \"To Francesco Maria I., Duke of Urbino, leader of the\r\narmies of this Republic; erected at Pesaro, and recommended to the\r\naffectionate care of Venice by Francesco Maria II., when bereaved of\r\nprogeny.\" The original inscription ran thus: \"To Francesco Maria,\r\nan eminent general, leader of the armies of the holy Romish Church,\r\nthe Florentine republic, the Venetian state, and the princes of the\r\nLeague against the Turks, and of his own troops; the conqueror,\r\nsubduer, and sustainer of potentates at home and abroad; his\r\ngrandson, Duke Francesco Maria II. had this erected.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV\r\n\r\n     Of the manufacture of majolica in the Duchy of Urbino.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe influence of beauty upon arts usually considered as mechanical,\r\nand the exercise of creative talent upon substances of a common or\r\ntrifling character, are equally proofs of a pervading refinement.\r\nIt was accordingly a striking feature of Italy in her golden days,\r\nthat nearly every sort of handiwork felt that influence, and in\r\nits turn served to maintain public taste at an elevated standard.\r\nTo uncultivated or unobservant minds it may seem ridiculous to\r\nappreciate the state of high art in a country from the forms of\r\nculinary utensils, the colouring of plates, or the carving of a\r\npeach-stone; yet the elegance of Etruscan civilisation is nowhere\r\nmore manifest than in household bronzes; the majolica of Urbino\r\nhas preserved the designs and the feeling of Raffaele; the genius\r\nof Cellini did not spurn the most homely materials. The architects\r\nof the Revival were often sculptors; its engineers constructed\r\nclocks; while painters then exercised the crafts of jewellery\r\nand wood-gilding, or lent their pencils to beautify the potter's\r\nhandiwork. Our undertaking would accordingly be incomplete without\r\nsome notice of majolica, or decorative pottery, which under the\r\npatronage of her princes brought fame and wealth to the duchy of\r\nUrbino.[238]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 238: We have had frequent occasion to notice the\r\nencouragement given at Urbino to the exact sciences, and the\r\nconsequent success of those arts most depending upon them. Thus\r\nthe Baroccio family were celebrated for the accuracy of their\r\nmathematical instruments and timepieces, while watchmaking attracted\r\ngreat attention from all the della Rovere dukes. Their family\r\nportraits very generally exhibit a table-clock of some eccentric\r\nform, and their gifts to princes and royal personages were often\r\nchronometers made in their state. One of these, sent to Pius V.,\r\nexhibited the planetary movements and other complex revolutions of\r\nthe solar system; another, worn by his Holiness in a ring, marked\r\nthe hours by gently pricking his finger. In 1535, Francesco Maria I.\r\npresented to Charles V., at Naples, a ring wherein a watch struck\r\nthe hours; and many similar notices occur in the correspondence of\r\nhis grandson, the last Duke. Guidobaldo II. was especially fond of\r\nsuch mechanical curiosities. Having received from one Giovan Giorgio\r\nCapobianco of Vicenza, the Praxiteles of tiny chiselling, a ring\r\nwhich held a watch, whereupon were engraved the signs of the zodiac,\r\nwith a figure that pointed to and struck the hours--he interfered to\r\nsave the artist's life, when condemned to death for an assassination\r\nat Venice. In gratitude for this favour, the latter made for the\r\nDuchess a silver chessboard contained in a cherry-stone; nor should\r\nwe omit to add that he displayed the same ingenuity on a wider field\r\nas an architect and engineer. So, too, Filippo Santacroce, of Urbino,\r\nand his sons, are celebrated by Count Cicognara for their minute\r\ncarvings on gems, ivory, and nuts.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest work on the ceramic art is that of Giambattista Passeri\r\nof Pesaro, who was born about a hundred and fifty years since,\r\nand whose inquiries into geology and antiquities attracted him\r\nto a subject cognate to them both. While studying the fossils of\r\nCentral Italy, the transition was not difficult to their fictile\r\nproducts; and after vainly endeavouring to methodise the pottery\r\nof Etruria and Magna Grecia, he tried the same good office with\r\nbetter success upon the majolica of his native province.[239] Nor\r\nis his theme of so narrow an interest as might on a superficial\r\nview be supposed. The existence of pottery has frequently proved a\r\nvaluable aid to historical research; and even now our surest test\r\nof Etruscan refinement is supplied by the painted vases exhumed\r\nfrom the sepulchres of an almost forgotten race.[240] It is not,\r\nhowever, important merely as affording landmarks useful in tracing\r\nthe civilisation of nations; for, by combining taste with ingenuity,\r\nit gives to materials the most ordinary and almost fabulous value,\r\nthereby constituting one of the notable triumphs of mind over matter,\r\nand largely promoting the advance of intellectual culture. Even\r\nin early stages of national improvement, the plastic art, after\r\ncontributing to the necessities of life, has often been the first to\r\ninspire elegance or embody true principles of form and afterwards\r\nof colour. Dealing with a substance readily found and easily\r\nmanipulated, wherein nature might be imitated or fancy developed,\r\nit was the precursor of sculpture, the patron of painting, and the\r\nhandmaid of architecture.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 239: The subject has since met with more attention, but\r\nno other work has been expressly dedicated to it. We may refer to\r\nVASARI, LANZI, and GAYE, _passim_; RICCI, _Notizie delle Belle\r\nArti in Gubbio_; _Kunstblatt_, No. 51; MONTANARI, _Lettera interno\r\nad alcune Majoliche dipinte nella collezione Massa_ in _Giornale\r\nArcadico di Roma_, XXXVII., 333; BRONGNIART, _Traité des Arts\r\nCeramiques_; MARRYAT, _History of Pottery and Porcelain_. It is\r\nboth an advantage and a pleasure to refer readers unacquainted with\r\nthis interesting art, to the charming and accurate representations\r\nof azulejo, Robbian ware, and majolica, given in the last of\r\nthese works. It is greatly to be desired that Mr. Marryat may, in\r\ncontinuation of his subject, and with access to English collections\r\nunknown to me, supply much information which this slight sketch\r\ncannot include.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 240: We enter not upon the contested question of the origin\r\nof these productions; wherever made, they prove the taste of those\r\nwho owned and appreciated them. Besides, the ruder varieties were\r\ncertainly indigenous to Central Italy from an early period. Neither\r\nneed we trace the analogy between majolica and enamel. The latter was\r\nnot unknown to the ancients, though brought by them to no ornamental\r\nperfection. During the dark ages, it was used as an accessory of\r\nmetal sculpture for many purposes of religious art, and was even\r\nintroduced into large works, such as bronze doors. The splendid\r\nreliquary at Orvieto, enamelled on silver at Siena by Ugolino Vieri\r\nin 1338, as well as the _paliotti_ of Florence and Pistoja executed\r\nin that and the following centuries, show to what perfection this art\r\nhad attained, ere the painting of porcelain was practised in Italy.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAIOLICA\r\n\r\n_A plate of Urbino ware of about 1540 in the British Museum_]\r\n\r\nThe earthenware made in Central Italy was usually called _majolica_,\r\nin our spelling maiolica. The derivation of its etymology, from\r\nthe island of Majorca, seems no mere superficial inference from\r\nsimilarity of sounds. Its peculiarity was a glaze, which, besides\r\ngiving a vehicle for colour, remedied the permeable quality of\r\nancient pottery. Such a glazed surface had long been known to the\r\nSaracens, and was imported by the Moors into Spain and the Balearic\r\nIsles, in the shape of gaily-tinted tiles, arranged in bands or\r\ndiaper on their buildings. To these succeeded _azulejos_, generally\r\nof blue in various shades, which were mosaicked into church walls in\r\nvarious historical compositions, from designs which Mr. Stirling\r\nascribes to Murillo's pencil. The conquests or commerce of the\r\nPisans imported this fashion, at first by incorporating concave\r\ncoloured tiles among brickwork, afterwards, at Pesaro, by the use of\r\nencaustic flooring. Nor can we exclude from view that the earliest\r\nItalian ware has decorations either in geometrical patterns, or with\r\nshamrock-shaped foliations of a character rather Saracenic than\r\nindigenous, and more indicative of moresque extraction than were the\r\napocryphal armorial bearings of Spain and Majorca, at a period when\r\nsuch insignia were often borrowed as mere ornaments, in ignorance of\r\ntheir origin and meaning. The fabric thus introduced spread over most\r\nof Central Italy, and between 1450 and 1700 was largely practised\r\nat the towns of Arezzo, Perugia, Spello, Nocera, Città di Castello,\r\nFlorence, Bologna, Ferrara, Ravenna, Rimini, Forlì, and Faenza\r\n(whence its French name _fayence_), Pesaro, Urbino, Fermignano,\r\nCastel Durante, and Gubbio, as well as at various places in the\r\nAbruzzi.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another quarter to which vitrified or encaustic\r\nware may be ascribed, in so far at least as regards improved methods\r\nand more important results. Luca della Robbia[*241] was born at\r\nFlorence in 1399, and from being a jeweller, took to modelling\r\nstatues and bas-reliefs in clay. Annoyed by the fragile nature of\r\nthese, and perhaps by the doubtful success of _terra cotta_, he\r\ndiscovered a mode of glazing the surface of his beautiful works,\r\nwith, it is said, a mixture of tin, _terra ghetta_ (from the lake of\r\nThrasimene), antimony, and other mineral substances. The secret of\r\nthis varnish was transmitted in the inventor's family until about\r\n1550: it ended in a female, with whose husband, Andrea Benedetto\r\nBuglione, it died. Recent attempts to revive the art at Florence\r\nhave proved but partially successful, and wholly unremunerative;\r\nindeed, the mechanical difficulties exceed those of sculpture,\r\nincluding the separation of the work into sections before drying\r\nand burning it, and its eventual reunion into one piece. Although\r\nneither mild nor equal, the climate at Florence does not seem to\r\ninfluence the Robbian fabrics in the open air, but they have suffered\r\nfrom the frosts and snows of our duchy, where several are broken or\r\nblistered, such as the lunette of S. Domenico at Urbino. By much\r\nthe finest specimen I know there remains [1843] in the desecrated\r\noratory of the Sforzan palace [of 1484] at Gradara; it may be by\r\nAndrea della Robbia, and represents an enthroned Madonna and Child,\r\nnearly life-size, with attendant saints, the predella complete, and\r\nthe whole a fine monument of Christian art. Originally, the plastic\r\nsurface of Robbian ware was of a uniform glistening white, which,\r\nthough cold in effect, is very favourable to the pure religious\r\nsentiment at which it generally aimed. The eyes were then blackened,\r\nin order to aid expression. Next, the pallid figures were relieved\r\nagainst a deep cerulean ground. The followers of Luca added fruits\r\nand flowers, wreathed in their proper colours. Agincourt justly\r\nregrets that these men were led into such innovations by a desire\r\nfor mastering difficulties, and the ambition of adding to sculpture\r\nthe beauties of painting; for when colour is given to draperies, the\r\neye is ill-reconciled to an addition which seems to transfer such\r\nproductions from the category of high art to the level of waxwork. By\r\na further modification, the flesh parts were left unglazed, bringing\r\nthe warm tone of terra cotta to harmonize with the coloured costumes,\r\narchitecture and backgrounds being still usually white or deep\r\nblue. Passeri, however, asserts for this coloured glaze an earlier\r\ndiscovery in his own province, where pottery was certainly made in\r\nthe fourteenth century. But it is generally admitted that the art of\r\ncombining with it lively colours was greatly improved after Pesaro\r\nhad passed under the Sforza. In 1462, Ventura di Maestro Simone dei\r\nPiccolomini of Siena established himself there, along with Matteo\r\ndi Raniere, of a noble family at Cagli, in order to manufacture\r\nearthenware, and may have directed attention to the productions of\r\ndella Robbia, who had already been employed at Rimini by its tyrant,\r\nSigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *241: For all that concerns the Della Robbia, cf. MAUD\r\nCRUTTWELL, _Luca and Andrea della Robbia and their School_ (Dent,\r\n1904).]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn account of majolica[*242] ought to contain the various places\r\nnoted for its manufacture, the peculiar qualities distinguishing\r\ntheir respective productions, the methods by which these qualities\r\nwere given, and the artists most successful in producing them. But on\r\nmost of these points we are left in great ignorance, which my limited\r\nobservation has not enabled me to dispel. All I can offer is a list\r\nof the manufactories and artists, classed to the best of my power,\r\nand preceded by a few very general notices of the process.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *242: The finest collection of Italian majolica in\r\nthe world is probably that in Pesaro in the possession of the\r\nMunicipality.]\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier Cipriano Picolpasso, of Castel Durante, doctor in\r\nmedicine and majolica-painter under Duke Guidobaldo II., left a MS.\r\nprofessing to record the secrets of his art; but Passeri, after\r\nexamination, pronounces his revelations trite, and his historical\r\nnotices barren. It is, however, agreed that Pesaro was the first site\r\nwithin the duchy of Urbino where the fabric attained celebrity, and\r\nthat its earliest efforts were called _mezza_ or \"half\" majolica.\r\nThis is distinguished by a coarse gritty fracture, of dirty grey\r\ncolour, and a glaze which does not take much lustre or transparency.\r\nIt is generally in the form of plates, many of them huge, all\r\nclumsily thick, and frequently of a dingy, ill-vitrified yellow on\r\nthe back. The lustre on the front is rather pearly than metallic; but\r\nprismatic, or even golden, iridescence is met with. These productions\r\nare assigned, by Passeri and others, to the fifteenth century; but\r\nthe arms of Leo X. appear on one in the mediæval exhibition of\r\n1850 (No. 543, belonging to Mr. S. Isaacs), and on another in the\r\nHotel Cluny, at Paris; while, in the museum of the Commendatore\r\nKestner, Hanoverian minister at Rome, is a third, designed after\r\nMarc Antonio. The \"fine\" majolica attained its greatest perfection\r\nat Urbino between 1530 and 1560, and it was prized chiefly for\r\nthe perfect vitrification and transparency of its varnish, the\r\ncomparative thinness and whiteness of the texture, the brilliant\r\ncolouring, and masterly design. Gubbian pottery combined in some\r\ndegree the qualities of half and fine ware, but excelled all others\r\nin metallic and prismatic glaze.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAIOLICA\r\n\r\n_A plate of Castel Durante ware of about 1524_\r\n\r\n\"The divine and beautiful Lucia\"]\r\n\r\nWe shall not encumber our pages with conjectural or vague hints as\r\nto the processes of these interesting fabrics. Iridescent lustre\r\nobliquely reflected, and a white glaze of dazzling transparency,\r\nwere the objects respectively aimed at. The former was attained\r\nby preparations of lead, copper, silver, and gold; the latter was\r\nimparted by dipping the half-baked pottery into a white varnish, over\r\nwhich, while moist, the subject was rapidly painted, correction or\r\nretouching being incompatible with the immediate absorption of its\r\ncolours, which, apart from accidental fusion of tints, and flaws\r\nin the furnace, abundantly accounts for the frequent inaccuracy\r\nof design. The metallic lustre depended a good deal on lead, the\r\nwhiteness on a free use of tin.\r\n\r\nThose early plates of Pesaro were very rarely signed by their\r\nartists; but one in the Hague Museum bears a cipher resembling\r\nC.H.O.N., whilst another, quoted by Pungileoni, has a mark composed\r\nof G.A.T. interlaced. In 1478, Sixtus IV. wrote his acknowledgments\r\nto Costanzo Sforza for a present of \"_Vasa fictilia_, most elegantly\r\nwrought, which, for the donor's sake, are prized as if of gold or\r\nsilver rather than of earthenware.\"[243] In a similar letter, Lorenzo\r\nthe Magnificent thanked [Roberto] Malatesta, observing that \"they\r\nplease me entirely by their perfections and rarity, being quite\r\nnovelties in these parts, and are valued more than if of silver,\" the\r\ndonor's arms serving daily to recall their origin.[244] Passeri gives\r\na curious proclamation by the Lord of Pesaro, in 1486, narrating\r\nthat, for good favour to the citizens, and considering a fabric of\r\nearthen vases to have been of old practised in that city, superior,\r\nby general admission, to all others produced in Italy, and that\r\nthere were now more workshops than ever,--importation of any species\r\nthereof from foreign parts was prohibited, on pain of confiscation\r\nand fine, half to the informer, oil and water jars only excepted; and\r\nfurther that, within eight days, all foreign vases should be sent\r\nout of the state. In 1510, majolica was numbered among the trades of\r\nPesaro, and in 1532, Duke Francesco Maria confirmed the protection\r\nfor it which we have just cited. I have not met with the patent for\r\n\"application of gold to Italian faience,\" quoted by Mr. H. Rogers as\r\ngranted, in 1509, to Giacomo Lanfranco of Pesaro, by Duke Guidobaldo,\r\nwho, by the way, was then dead.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 243: Archiv. Dipl. Urbinate at Florence [1845].]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 244: GAYE, _Carteggio_, I., p. 304. He was probably Roberto\r\nMalatesta, who served the Florentines in 1479, and died 1482; so\r\nGaye's date of 1490 seems erroneous.]\r\n\r\nIt may have been soon after this date that \"fine\" superseded \"half\"\r\nware in the potteries of Pesaro, where the art obtained a new\r\nstimulus on transference hither of the court by Duke Guidobaldo\r\nII. Thereafter it is impossible to distinguish earthenware issuing\r\nfrom these establishments from that of Urbino, their quality\r\nbeing similar, and the artists in many cases identical; but by\r\nthat Prince's patronage it unquestionably attained its greatest\r\nperfection. A petition by certain makers of Pesaro for protection, is\r\ngiven in X. of the Appendix, as illustrating then received principles\r\nof trade, as well as of this fabric. It bears date in 1552; and\r\nin 1569, the Duke granted to Giacomo Lanfranco, of that city, a\r\npatent for twenty-five years, guarded by 500 scudi of penalty, for\r\nhis inventions in applying gold to vases, and in constructing them\r\nof great size (exceeding the capacity of two _some_), of antique\r\nforms, and wrought in relievo. As a further encouragement, he and\r\nhis father Girolamo were exempted from every impost or tax, and from\r\nmill-dues on grinding ten _some_ of grain annually. Proud of the\r\nreputation of his native pottery, Guidobaldo was in the habit of\r\npresenting services of majolica to foreign princes and personages,\r\nwho again often sent commissions to be executed in the duchy, bearing\r\ntheir arms. A double service was, according to Vasari, given by him\r\nto Charles V.; and another to Philip II., painted by Orazio Fontana\r\nfrom Taddeo Zuccaro's designs; while Passeri mentions a set presented\r\nto Fra Andrea of Volterra, each piece inscribed _G.V.V.D. [Guid\r\nVbaldonis Urbini Ducis] Munus, F. Andreæ Volaterano_. I found in\r\nthe Oliveriana MSS. a letter addressed to his brother the Cardinal\r\nof Urbino, describing a _buffet_ for Monsignor Farnese, with its\r\ninventory, which will be found at XI. of the Appendix. The most\r\nimportant, however, of the ducal commissions was a very numerous set\r\nof jars, of many sizes and shapes, for the use of his laboratory\r\n[_spezeria_], a fashion imitated by other dilettanti. Blue, yellow,\r\nand green are their prevailing hues; they are always labelled with\r\nthe name of some drug or mixture, and occasionally have a portrait or\r\nother subject. The original set was gifted by Francesco Maria II. to\r\nthe treasury of Loreto, where about three hundred and eighty of them\r\nstill serve their original purpose, many duplicates being met with in\r\ncollections. Specimens will be found engraved by Bartoli, and in Mr.\r\nMarryat's beautiful volume; the offers of various crowned heads to\r\nreplace them by others of gold and silver, are well-known travellers'\r\ntales, but in truth they are far from choice specimens.\r\n\r\nLike other branches of fine art, majolica-painting showed an early\r\npreference for sacred themes; but the primitive plates of Pesaro bear\r\neffigies of saints much more frequently than scripture histories,\r\nor doctrinal representations. Then came in a fashion for portraits\r\nof living or historical persons, including warriors, high-born\r\ndames, and classical heroes, inscribed with their names. These\r\npaintings are all flat and lifeless, with scarcely an attempt at\r\nrelief, or graduated tints; the ornaments are rude, inclining to\r\nMoorish, and totally different from what is called arabesque. From\r\nthe della Robbian influence were probably borrowed plates brimming\r\nwith coloured fruits in relievo, a variety of little interest, but\r\nreminding us of similar French productions in a later period. In the\r\nsixteenth century, the mania of classicism, elsewhere discussed,[245]\r\nmuch affected majolica; and in its designs, although events of the\r\nOld Testament were not abandoned, saintly legends gave place to\r\nscenes from Ovid and Virgil. For behoof of the unlettered curious,\r\nthe incident was shortly, often clumsily, described in blue letters\r\non the back, with a reference to the text. In a few cases (perhaps\r\nof _amatorii_ or nuptial gifts), I have found the very finest\r\nproductions degraded by grossly indecent designs; in more numerous\r\nones groups of nude figures disport themselves in the manner of\r\nGiulio Romano. Those in which Raffaelesque arabesques prevail,\r\nbelong chiefly to the latter portion of Guidobaldo's reign. From\r\nthat time the fabric decayed rapidly, owing partly to a general\r\ndecline of æsthetic taste, partly to the impaired state of that\r\nDuke's finances, and the indifference of his successor. Even after\r\nhistorical compositions were neglected, considerable dexterity was\r\ndisplayed in painting trophies, arms, musical instruments, utensils,\r\nmarine monsters, children, grotesques, birds, trees, flowers, fruits,\r\nand landscapes, designs of that class being easily repeated and\r\ntheir inaccuracies passing for studied extravagance. But the drawing\r\ngot worse, the colouring more feeble, as good artists dropped off,\r\ncarrying with them their sketches, and superseded by engravings from\r\nSadeler and other Flemings, whose vile taste contributed to lower\r\nthe standard of better times.[246] Public favour, ever capricious,\r\nwas successfully wooed by the oriental porcelain, which now found\r\nits way among the higher ranks, while the augmented supply of silver\r\nencouraged a more extended use of plate. Thus discredited, the\r\nmanufacture progressively deteriorated, until, in 1722, the stoneware\r\nof Urbania was of the most ordinary description, the efforts of\r\nCardinal Legate Stoppani to reinstate a better fabric having totally\r\nfailed; and thus neglected, the most beautiful productions of its\r\nhappier time were dispersed, or passed to the meanest uses, from\r\nwhich another whim of fashion, as much as the revival of a better\r\ntaste, has suddenly rescued them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 245: See vol. II.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 246: In 1845, the Canon Staccoli at Urbino showed me a\r\nplate equally feeble in design and colour, signed _F.M. Doiz Fiamengo\r\nfecit_, a proof that it was no despised production of the time.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAIOLICA\r\n\r\n_A plate of Urbino ware about 1535. (The arms are Cardinal Pucci's)_]\r\n\r\nMuch of what has been said of the fine majolica of Pesaro is\r\napplicable to that ascribed to Urbino, most of which appears to\r\nhave been made in the neighbouring towns of Fermignano, Gaifa, and\r\nCastel Durante (now Urbania), the alluvial washings of the Metauro\r\nbeing peculiarly adapted for the purest white glaze. Yet Pungileoni\r\nhas wormed out of some old notarial protocols the names of Mo.\r\nGiovanni di Donnino in 1477, and of Mo. Francesco in 1501,\r\nboth designed of Gardutia, potters (_figuli_) at Urbino. He also\r\nestablishes that coloured figures were executed there in vases in\r\n1521. Passeri denies that those ruby and gold colours for which we\r\nshall find Gubbio celebrated, and which certainly were known in the\r\nworkshops of Pesaro, ever came into use at Urbino,--a conclusion\r\nwhich we shall have occasion to correct. Indeed, this secret of\r\nmetallic iridescence is said to have been known at Florence, and\r\nI have seen a plate of golden lustre bearing the emblem of the\r\nwoolstaplers' guild [_arte della lana_]; but if such manufactory\r\nexisted, I have found no notice of it, and the still flourishing\r\none of Ginori in the Val d'Arno pretends to no such antiquity. I\r\nwas shown at Florence a tile, on which Annibale Caracci's Galatea\r\nwas represented with great accuracy of design, but poor and hard in\r\ncolour, signed \"_Ferdinand Campani, Siena, 1736_.\" In the latter town\r\nthere is said to have been a fabric known by the name of _Terchi_;\r\nthe analogous one, near Fermo, in the Abruzzi, called _Grue_, sent\r\nforth, I believe, most of those tiles, small plates, or cups and\r\nsaucers,--ornamented with landscapes of tolerable design, but tinted\r\nin sickly yellow or blue, and totally devoid of style,--which abound\r\nin Lower Italy.\r\n\r\nThe prismatic glaze, especially of gold and ruby colour, was\r\nunequalled in those plates painted at Gubbio by Maestro Giorgio\r\nAndreoli, who appears to have come hither from Pavia with his\r\nbrothers Salimbeni and Giovanni. His name was there enrolled among\r\nthe nobility in 1498, but the dates affixed to his plates extend from\r\n1518 to about 1537. He had previously executed several plastic works\r\nof the nature of della Robbia's figures, the principal of which was a\r\nMadonna del Rosario altar-piece for the Domenican church, which has\r\nbeen enthusiastically described in No. 928 of the London _Athenæum_.\r\nIt was torn down by the French in their wonted course of rapine, and,\r\nto the disgrace of the local authorities of Gubbio, lay neglected\r\nfor several years after the peace, until purchased for the Steidl\r\nInstitut at Frankfort. The only other of his productions remaining\r\nat Gubbio is a life-sized statue of St. Anthony in the same church,\r\nquite inferior as regards design and religious feeling to those of\r\nthe Tuscan sculptors, and which, though coloured, has no metallic\r\nlustre. He is said by Passeri to have lived until 1552; and of his\r\nfamily, who long occupied an honourable station in their native city,\r\nonly a son, Cencio, followed his father's profession. I have seen\r\na plate of this school at Mr. Forrest's, 54 Strand [1850], rudely\r\nsigned with G; others have R, perhaps il Rovigese, whom I shall\r\npresently mention. Mo. Prestino da Gubbio wrought about 1557, but\r\nthe latest date I have seen with metallic lustre and the Gubbian mark\r\nis 1549, on which the iridescence was extremely feeble.\r\n\r\nPasseri's assertion, that the Gubbian glaze was borrowed from the\r\nhalf-majolica of Pesaro, may be correct; but we might, perhaps,\r\nmaintain for it a date as early as 1474, on the authority of a\r\nbeautiful small plate possessing its peculiarities, and exhibiting\r\nDuke Federigo's name and profile in relief, within a coloured border\r\nof oak-leaves also in relief, made, possibly, on occasion of his\r\nalliance with the della Rovere, by marriage of the Lord Prefect with\r\nhis daughter in that year. This interesting memorial is No. 2286 of\r\nthe Mediæval Gallery at the Louvre. In Mr. Marryat's choice cabinet\r\nis a half-ware plate, bearing on the back a monogram, which that\r\ngentleman supposes of Maestro Giorgio's early period, before he had\r\ndiscovered the mode of obtaining iridescent varnishes. It displays\r\na group of nude figures in pale greyish tints, without any approach\r\nto brilliant colouring. His usual signature was dashed off with a\r\nmetalliferous brush on the back, _Mo. Go. da Vgubio_, with\r\nthe date, as at No. 11 of the same facsimiles, from a plate in my\r\npossession. Such pieces are rare, and highly prized; their subjects\r\nare usually saints, classical groups, or grotesques, vases being\r\nvery seldom met with. A branch of this fabric is said to have been\r\nseated at Nocera; and several, with bright red and blue tracery\r\non a gold metallic ground, dated 1537-8, in the choice cabinet of\r\nSignor Serafino Tordelli at Spoleto [1845], are supposed by him of\r\nthat fabric. Among other exquisite specimens, he has one by Maestro\r\nGiorgio, 1529, rivalling the finest miniature, and representing\r\nArchimedes measuring a globe, in front of the Communal Palace at\r\nGubbio.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus much regarding the various manufactories of majolica connected\r\nwith Urbino. The forms and purposes to which it was turned were\r\nvery various. The first plates of Pesaro, chiefly of great size\r\n[_bacili_], were probably for table use, but a variety of them,\r\ncalled _amatorii_, were either tender souvenirs or marriage gifts.\r\nThese usually had the lady's portrait, with the complimentary epithet\r\nof Bella, as in this example now in my possession; at other times\r\nunited hands and a transfixed heart, with a motto of affection,\r\nmoralising, or banter. Several such have been described by Passeri,\r\nMarryat, and others, but I shall add a few which have come under my\r\nobservation. 1. At Florence: _Francesca bella a paragon di tutti_,\r\n\"Frances, of beauty comparable to any one.\" 2. At Rome: _Nemo sua\r\nsorte contentus erat_, \"Each has something to grumble about.\" 3. Sir\r\nThomas B. Hepburn; a lady holding a gigantic pink: _Non è sì vago\r\nel fiore che non imbiacca o casca_, \"There is no flower so lovely\r\nbut fades or droops.\" 4. Rome; a dame of rueful countenance: _Sola\r\nmiseria caret invidia_, \"Only the miserable escape envy.\" 5. Pesaro,\r\nMassa collection: _Per dormire non si acquista_, \"The indolent get\r\nnothing.\" 6. Florence: _Chi bien guida sua barcha sempre emporto_,\r\n\"Who steers well his bark, always makes the harbour.\" 7. Pesaro:--\r\n\r\n     _S'il dono è picolo e di pocho valore,\r\n     Basta la fedel povere se redore._\r\n\r\n     \"If small the gift and scant of merit\r\n     A poor slave's faith,--enough, you share it.\"[247]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 247: The rules of syntax are in these often overstepped,\r\nand conjecture left to eke out the sense. My reading is literal,\r\nof _basta la fe del povere sevedore_, which is intelligible, and\r\nrhymes, as is not the case with _basta la fede, e 'l povere se vedo_,\r\nthe version of Passeri. This author tells us of a certain coy or\r\nmischievous Philomela who pierced her lover's present with holes\r\nand made of it a mouse-trap! Also of an exquisite Gubbian plate,\r\nportraying the _Daniella Diva_, who displays a wounded heart with the\r\nlegend _Oimè!_ \"Ah me.\" A drug-bottle in Mr. Marryat's collection,\r\nand engraved in his work, has the portrait of a lady whose squint is\r\ngiven to the life.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAIOLICA\r\n\r\n_Plate of Castel Durante ware about 1540, with a portrait medallion\r\nwithin a border of oak leaves. This pattern was called \"Cerquata\" or\r\n\"al Urbinata,\" the oak being the badge of the Rovere house_]\r\n\r\n8, 9. Florence, and evidently nuptial presents: _Per fin che vivo, io\r\nsempre t'amerò_, \"While I live, you I love\"; the other, a bridegroom\r\nand bride exchanging a hearty kiss. Most of these portrait-plates\r\nwere deep, and are said not to have been delivered empty. Brides\r\nreceived them brimming with jewels; for dancing partners they were\r\nfilled with fruits and confections; to a lady in childbed was\r\npresented a salver containing the sort of chamber service called in\r\nFrench a _déjeûner de marié_, appropriately decorated with infant\r\nlegends of gods and heroes; at children's balls, were given tiny\r\nplates of sugar-plums, whereon a dancing Cupid sounding his cymbal\r\nwas often painted. 10. Massa collection,--this has a sadder import:\r\n_Un bel morire tutta la vita onora_, \"A beautiful death confers\r\nillustration on a lifetime,\" was, no doubt, in memory of some\r\nvenerated friend, and might have been used to serve her funeral\r\nmeats.[248]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 248: In order to finish our notice of mottoes, a few others\r\nmay be here added. 11. Massa collection; a female portrait, on whose\r\nbreast are the arms of Montefeltro: _Viva, Viva il Duca di Urbino_.\r\n12. Rome, Kestner Museum; another female portrait: _Ibit ad geminos\r\nlucida fama pollo_ (?). 13. Kestner Museum and that at the Hague;\r\nSt. Thomas probing the Saviour's wound: _Beati qui non viderunt et\r\ncrediderunt_, \"Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have\r\nbelieved.\" 14. Spoleto, Tordelli collection; a beautiful female\r\nresisting a crowd of armed soldiery: 1540. _Italia mesta sottosopra\r\nvolta, como pei venti in mare le torbid'onde, ch'or da una parte\r\net hor da l'altra volta._ \"1540. Dejected Italy, tossed like the\r\nwind-lashed waves, turning now hither now thither.\" 15. Rome,--satire\r\non the sack of Rome; a warrior in antique armour strikes with a\r\ntwo-handed sword at a naked woman stretched in a lascivious posture,\r\nbehind whom five others tremblingly await their fate: it is inscribed\r\nbehind, 1534. _Roma lasciva dal buon Carlo quinto partita a mezza.\r\nFra Xanto a. da Rovigo, Urbino._ \"Rome, the wanton, cut up by the\r\ngood Charles V.; by Brother Xante of Rovigo, at Urbino.\" This plate,\r\nglowing with iridescence, contradicts Passeri's opinion (already\r\nquoted) that stanniferous glaze was never practised in the Urbino\r\nworkshops, as does the tile introduced three pages below. 16. Rome;\r\na grandly draped female, sitting in desolation over a dead child:\r\n_Fiorenzo mesta i morti figlii piange_, \"Disconsolate Florence weeps\r\nfor her lifeless offspring,\" in the plague visitation of 1538. Though\r\nwith the most brilliant ruby and gold lustre I ever saw, it has in\r\nblue the cipher X, probably also of Xante in Urbino.]\r\n\r\nBut to return to the uses of this pottery. Those who have observed\r\nthe rich effect of the majolica sparingly displayed in the late\r\nMediæval Exhibition at the Adelphi [1850] may readily admit that, on\r\na buffet lit up by Italian suns, its glowing tints and attractive\r\nforms were no mean substitute for the as yet scarce precious metals.\r\nIngenuity was taxed to invent designs and adaptations of an art in\r\nwhich fashion ran riot:--Tiles for floors or panelling; vases of\r\nmere ornament; beakers; epergnes; wine-coolers; perfume-sprinklers;\r\nfountains, whence there flowed alternately, as if by magic, water\r\nor wine of nine varieties at the bidding of the bewildered guests;\r\nwine-cups clustered with grapes, through an orifice in which the\r\nliquor was sucked, anticipating the American device for discussing\r\nsherry-cobbler. Of drug-bottles and pots we have spoken. Sauce-boats,\r\nsalt-cellars, and inkstands gave rise to endless caprices, in the\r\nguise \"of beasts, and of fowl and fishes\"; and to these may be added\r\nfigure-groups of saints, grotesque characters and animals, fruits,\r\ntrees, and pilgrims' bottles.\r\n\r\nIn the decorations there was generally a consistency, too often lost\r\nsight of by modern artificers. Thus, toilet-basins were painted with\r\nmarine deities, water-nymphs, or aquatic allegories; fruit-stands\r\nwith fruit and vintages; wine-cups with vine-festoons. Among the\r\noddities may be mentioned tiny tea-cups, into the paste for which was\r\nmingled a portion of dust carefully gathered in sweeping out the holy\r\nhouse at Loreto, their sanctity being vouched by the inscription,\r\n_Con pol. di S.C._, \"With dust from the Santa Casa.\" The effigy of\r\nthe Madonna of Loreto is often affixed, in colour and design on a\r\npar with the superstition. A pair of these was shown at the Mediæval\r\nExhibition of 1850, No. 562 of the catalogue, belonging to a Mrs.\r\nPalliser.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving thus considered the various sites and sorts of Urbino\r\nmajolica, its processes and purposes, we shall mention some of the\r\nartists employed upon it. Of these there were two classes, the potter\r\nwho mixed and manipulated, modelled and moulded clay-clod into an\r\narticle of convenience or luxury, and the painter whose pencil\r\nrendered it an object of the fine arts; latterly, however, these\r\nbranches were combined, and were carried on by a class of artificers\r\ncalled _vasaii_ or _vasari_, and _boccalini_, according as vases\r\nor bottles prevailed in their workshops. The little that has come\r\nto our knowledge regarding those by whom the early Pesarese and\r\nGubbian ware was fashioned and decorated will be found in a former\r\npage. The latter makers of Pesaro and Urbino have more frequently\r\nleft us the means of identifying their performances in monograms\r\nor signatures, usually inscribed in blue characters on the back\r\nof plates. But before considering these, we may dispose of the\r\nvulgar error which has given Raffaele's name to Italian porcelain.\r\nSuperficial or romancing writers have often seriously repeated, with\r\npurely fictitious additions, Malvasia's petulant sneer, which he\r\nwas fain quickly to retract, that the great Sanzio was a painter of\r\nplates; others have, without better grounds, made him assistant to\r\nhis father, a potter. There is however nothing connecting him with\r\nthe ceramic art beyond a loose notice by Don V. Vittorio, in his\r\n_Osservazioni Sopra Felsina Pittrice_ (pp. 44, 112-14), of a letter\r\nfrom Raffaele referring to designs supplied by him to the Duchess\r\nfor majolica. That he did supply such drawings is possible, though\r\ndiscredited by Pungileoni, and, if true, it in no way compromises his\r\nstatus, at a period when high art lent a willing hand to decorate and\r\nelevate the adjuncts and appliances of domestic life. This much is\r\ncertain, that compositions emanating from Sanzio and his school were\r\nemployed in ornamenting porcelain during the sixteenth century, but\r\nthey were doubtless obtained from his pupils, or from the engravings\r\nof Marc Antonio. Such is the title here introduced from the original\r\nin my possession (8-1/2 inches by 7), which is one of the most\r\nRaffaelesque I have met with, and which, though not signed, displays\r\nthe colouring practised by Fra Xanto, the blue and green being deep\r\nand well marked, the orange and yellow of the clouds and curtain in\r\nmetallic iridescence.\r\n\r\nIn this, as in most instances, the design is somewhat marred by the\r\ncolours having run when laid on, or during vitrification. The mistake\r\nas to Sanzio has been partly occasioned by confusion with Raffaele\r\ndel Colle, who painted at the Imperiale, and is said by tradition\r\nto have contributed sketches for the Pesarese workshops, and also\r\nwith another Raffaele Ciarla, who seems to have been a potter,\r\nabout 1530-60. Battles, sieges, and mythological figures resembling\r\nthe vigorous inventions of Giulio Romano, are not unfrequent; and\r\nin the Kestner Museum, I have observed several plates of choice\r\ndesign and Raffaelesque character, especially the Fall and Expulsion\r\nof our first Parents, and the Gathering of Manna. But these are\r\nsatisfactorily accounted for by Passeri's statement, that, with a\r\nview to improve a native manufacture which brought to his state both\r\nestimation and wealth, Duke Guidobaldo II. took infinite pains in\r\ncollecting a better class of drawings and prints from celebrated\r\nmasters, on the dispersion of which, in consequence of their being\r\nsought for by collectors, the pictorial excellence of majolica\r\nrapidly declined. The first symptom of decay was the substitution\r\nof monotonous arabesques, weak in colour and repeated from the type\r\nintroduced by Raffaele, in place and figure groups and other subjects\r\nrequiring composition and design.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPremising that we cannot now distinguish exactly between potters and\r\nthe painters, where these cognate occupations chanced to be divided,\r\nand that the same persons occasionally wrought at various places in\r\nthe duchy, we shall supply a notice of the names we have met with in\r\nconnection with the workshops of Pesaro, Urbino, and Castel Durante,\r\nduring the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nTerenzio Terenzi painted vases and plates at Pesaro, one of which\r\nhe signed \"Terenzio fecit, 1550,\" but his usual mark was T. Another\r\nis inscribed, \"Questo piatto fu fatto in la Bottega de Mastro\r\nBaldassare, Vasaro da Pesaro e fatto per mano de Ferenzio fiolo di\r\nMastro Matteo Boccalaro.\" He was doubtless the person who, under\r\nthe surname of Rondolino, became notorious at Rome for his clever\r\npictorial forgeries of the great master's works, although said by\r\nTicozzi to have been born at Pesaro in 1570. The signature \"Mastro\r\nGironimo, Vasaro in Pesaro, J.P.\" occurs from 1542 to 1560, and to\r\nhim Mr. Marryat ascribes, on what authority I know not, the mark\r\nA.O. connected by a cross, which Passeri quotes as of another artist\r\nin 1582; the letters I.P. that gentleman reads _in Pesaro_. This\r\nGirolamo Lanfranco was a native of Gabicce, near Pesaro, and died in\r\n1599, leaving sons Girolamo and Ludovico. In his favour, and that of\r\nhis son, were granted the privileges already referred to, as dated\r\n1552 and 1569.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the workshops of Urbino, we have these names.\r\nGiovanni and Francesco di Donnino had a commission for a set of vases\r\nfor Cardinal Capaccio. _Fra Xanto. a. da Rovigo in Urbino_ signed\r\nplatters of great size and beautiful design, about 1532-4, some\r\nof which show a very fine metallic and prismatic lustre. The mark\r\nX, occurring on pieces of that quality, does not, however, always\r\nrefer to him. A splendid plate in Mr. Marryat's rich collection,\r\ncommemorative of the taking of Goletta, in Africa, by Charles V.,\r\nis inscribed _In Urbino nella botteg di Francesco de Silvano, X.\r\nMDXXXXI._; and a Judith of great beauty, in the Tordelli\r\ncabinet, signed F.X. 1535, is, no doubt of that master. Contemporary\r\nand very analogous are plates with an iridescence rivalling that of\r\nMaestro Giorgio, signed _Mastro Rovigo di Urbino_, or _Da Rovigiese_:\r\nof this artist, probably the countryman of Xanto, we know nothing,\r\nbut he may be the same who signs Gubbian plates with R. Equally\r\nlittle can we say as to Giulio of Urbino, who is mentioned as working\r\nfor the Duke of Ferrara, about 1530; or of Cesare da Faenza, then\r\nemployed in the shop of Guido Merlini, of Urbino. Much more noted\r\nare the Fontana family, originally of Castel Durante. From thence\r\nGuido, son of Nicolò, emigrated to the capital, where his son Orazio\r\npainted many of the finest productions of the reign of Guidobaldo\r\nII., including the best vases of his laboratory, his usual mark being\r\nthis, meaning _Orazio Fontana Urbinate fece_. Among the treasures and\r\ntrash of Strawberry Hill was a very large vase, with serpent handles,\r\nand designs ascribed to Giulio Romano, inscribed _Fate in botega di\r\nOrazio Fontana_.[249] A plate described by Passeri, has the story of\r\nHoratius Cocles, with the motto _Orazio solo contra Toscana tutta,\r\nfatto in Pesaro 1541_, which appears to be a _jeu de mots_ intended\r\nby Fontana as a challenge to the rival fabrics of Tuscany.[250] For\r\nhim has been claimed the invention of Gubbian glaze; while others\r\nsay his discovery was a mode of preventing the mixture of colours\r\nduring vitrification. He died in 1571, his labours having been shared\r\nby a brother Camillo, who carried the art to Ferrara, and a nephew\r\nFlaminio, who settled in Florence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 249: A magnificent pair of triangular fonts in the same\r\ncollection brought at the sale 168_l._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 250: The ancestors of Giorgio Vasari were surnamed from\r\ntheir occupation of vase-makers (_vasari_), at Arezzo. The Ginori\r\nestablishment near Florence is comparatively modern.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: O F V F]\r\n\r\nAmong the pupils of Orazio was Raffaele Ciarla, whose name we have\r\nnoticed as confused with that of Raffaele Sanzio, and who painted\r\na buffet of porcelain, after designs by Taddeo Zuccaro, which his\r\nsovereign presented to Philip II. of Spain. He wrought between 1530\r\nand 1560. Gianbattista Franco, a Venetian painter of whom we have\r\nlately spoken, was invited by Duke Guidobaldo II., about 1540, to\r\nsupply designs for majolica, in consequence of his reputation for\r\nclever drawings in the dangerous style of Michael Angelo. The loss of\r\nhis cupola for the cathedral at Urbino is not to be regretted; but in\r\na humbler sphere he acquitted himself better, and some of the vases\r\nin the laboratory bear his signature, B.F.V.F., _Battista Franco\r\nUrbinas fecit_. Among the latest artists was Alfonso Patanazzi, who\r\nwas born at Urbino of a noble family, and died in 1694; but his\r\nproductions (signed in full, or with his initials) have no artistic\r\nmerit whatever.\r\n\r\nIt remains to mention those who wrought chiefly at Castel Durante,\r\nor, as it was named after the Devolution to the Holy See, Urbania.\r\nThe Chevalier Cipriano Picolpasso, from being a professor of the\r\nhealing art, took to pottery about 1550, and left a MS. account\r\nof some of the secrets of that fabric and of its glazes, which\r\nwas used by Passeri for his work. Mr. Marryat considers that he\r\nwas peculiarly successful in painting trophies. Guido di Savino\r\nis said to have carried the art from Castel Durante to Antwerp;\r\nand he or Guido Fontana may be author of a plate, in the Soane\r\nMuseum, of the Fates, signed _In botega di Mo. Guido Durantino\r\nin Urbino_. To either of them I am disposed to assign the monogram,\r\nNo. 12, of our 18th plate of facsimiles, which Mr. Marryat reads as\r\nCastel Durante, but which seems to me a G.D., for Guido Durantino.\r\nAlessandro Gatti, of that place, had three brothers, Giovanni,\r\nTiseo, and Luzio, whom Picolpasso mentions as having emigrated to\r\nCorfu, and there established the same fabric. Cardinal Stoppani,\r\nLegate of Pesaro, in last century, made some ineffectual attempts\r\nto restore the manufacture at Urbania, and the only pottery now\r\nproduced in the duchy is of the most ordinary white stoneware. It\r\nwould be interesting to know the scale of remuneration for mere\r\nartistic varieties of majolica, but the prices given by Passeri, from\r\nPicolpasso's MS., refer only to the more ordinary and mechanical\r\ndesigns, such as grotesques with monsters, arabesques, trophies\r\nwith armour, fruit, flowers, and foliage; of these the first was\r\nthe most costly, the last the cheapest, varying from two Roman\r\nscudi to about two and a half pauls per hundred. Supposing money\r\nin 1560 to have been six times its present value in Italy, these\r\nsums may be considered equal to fifty shillings and six shillings\r\nrespectively.[251]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 251: Pungileoni quotes a demand made in 1683 of 50 scudi\r\n(about 11_l._) for a plate reputed to have been painted by Raffaele;\r\nthis, at thrice the present money value, would give 32_l._ as its\r\nprice.]\r\n\r\nIn Italy, the collection of majolica made by the Chevalier Massa, at\r\nPesaro, is specially worthy of notice, and contains specimens of most\r\nvarieties made in the duchy. It was chiefly got together between 1825\r\nand 1835 when these were still abundant and little sought after; but\r\nthe district was nearly cleared of them about twelve years since, by\r\nan agent of Parisian dealers. The Chevalier, who was in extreme old\r\nage in 1845, had bequeathed his majolica--consisting of about five\r\nhundred pieces, with a few indifferent pictures--to his native town,\r\nunless he could, during life, sell the whole for about 1000_l._,\r\ndestined by him to charitable purposes. Another numerous collection\r\nis that of Signor Mavorelli, at La Fratta, near Perugia. The small\r\nbut choice cabinet of Signor Serafino Tordelli, at Spoleto, has\r\nalready been mentioned. Specimens may still be picked up in Rome,\r\nFlorence, Paris, and London; but perhaps the most specimens are in\r\nthe hands of English amateurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\n(Page 21)\r\n\r\nCORRESPONDENCE OF CLEMENT VII. WITH DUKE FRANCESCO MARIA BEFORE THE\r\nSACK OF ROME, 1527\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several brieves preserved in the Archivio Diplomatico at\r\nFlorence, affording evidence of the Pope's feeble and inconsistent\r\npolicy. His missive, announcing to the Duke the truce with Lannoy,\r\nwas dated the 16th of March, and was followed by one of the 20th of\r\nApril, which we shall here translate:--\r\n\r\n     To our beloved Son, the noble Francesco Maria, Duke of\r\n     Urbino, Captain-general of the Venetians.\r\n\r\n     Beloved Son, health and apostolic benediction!\r\n\r\n     We have written but once to your nobility since coming to\r\n     this armistice with the enemy, for, matters not being yet\r\n     fully settled, we had nothing certain to apprise you of.\r\n     But we understood that, by the letters of our dear son\r\n     and lieutenant, Francesco Guicciardini, you were already\r\n     made aware of all we could have asked of you, and had by\r\n     your own good conduct anticipated it, which is to us most\r\n     pleasing and acceptable, and daily more realises our hopes\r\n     of you. As to this suspension of arms, we stooped to it\r\n     more readily from being destitute of means or assistance,\r\n     and from measuring the inclinations of others by our own\r\n     pacific dispositions. But now that our enemies' conduct\r\n     seems rather to abuse our clemency and moderation than to\r\n     approach any equitable course, we do not well see how we\r\n     can safely come to any terms with them. Thus, induced by\r\n     necessity, and by your worth and good will, as well as\r\n     cheered by the entire justice of our cause, we desire to\r\n     make your nobility aware that we have utterly dismissed\r\n     from our mind all truce with adversaries so perfidious, and\r\n     are willing and ready rather to hazard any peril of war\r\n     than submit to such unworthy and iniquitous conditions;\r\n     yet, believing victory much more imminent than danger, we\r\n     trust that their obstinacy and insolence will be easily put\r\n     down, provided your forces can timeously coalesce with our\r\n     own, and you exercise all zeal and caution in effecting\r\n     this. We therefore not only exhort your nobility to this,\r\n     but we fully rely on your doing it, as matter at once of\r\n     duty and propriety, and from your disposition in favour\r\n     of the Italian liberties and the dignity of ourselves and\r\n     this Holy See. We, on our part, shall maintain towards\r\n     our beloved sons, the Venetian government, that firm\r\n     attitude which shall satisfy all of our constancy, things\r\n     being now come to such a pitch that we must either sink\r\n     dishonoured on failure of your aid and support, or by your\r\n     help shall emerge with credit. As regards our paternal\r\n     and affectionate concern for your personal dignity and\r\n     interests, we can add nothing to the promises already made\r\n     you by letters and envoys, which we shall amply carry\r\n     out. Let your nobility, therefore, go on as you have so\r\n     well begun, nor relax until we and you and all Italy be\r\n     rid of all these barbarian excesses. After perusing these\r\n     brieves, your nobility will forward them to the Doge and\r\n     Signory of Venice, for, news of the enemy's obstinacy and\r\n     faithlessness reaching us by express at midnight, we had to\r\n     write to your nobility before we could communicate anything\r\n     to their ambassador.\r\n\r\n     Given at St. Peter's, Rome, under the fisher's signet, the\r\n     20th April, 1527, in the fourth year of our pontificate.\r\n\r\n     BLOSIUS.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd and 30th the Pope wrote again, but in general terms,\r\nand referring for details to the accredited bearer and to former\r\ndespatches. He exhorted the Duke, in formal and measured phrase, to\r\ndo his utmost towards fulfilling the expectations reposed on him and\r\nthe Venetians, upon whom were based all the Pontiff's hopes; but\r\nneither in letter nor spirit do these brieves indicate any perception\r\nof the extreme hazards of his position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II\r\n\r\n(Page 21)\r\n\r\nTHE SACK OF ROME\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _Letter from the Bishop of Modula to the Generals of the\r\nLeague._[252]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 252: Sanuto Diarii MSS. Bib. Marciana, xlv. f. 132.]\r\n\r\n     Most illustrious Lords of the League,\r\n\r\n     Let your most illustrious Lordships speed on quickly\r\n     without loss of time, seeing by these presents that the\r\n     enemy have carried the Borgo, though our Lord and all Rome\r\n     were well fortified. Monsignor de Bourbon is dead of an\r\n     arquebus-shot below the abdomen, and a man has just come\r\n     in who happened to aid in carrying off his body. More\r\n     than three thousand of the enemy have fallen. Let your\r\n     Lordships, then, press on, for the enemy are in the utmost\r\n     disorder; quickly, quickly, without loss of time. Your\r\n     servant,\r\n\r\n     GUIDO, BISHOP OF MODULA.\r\n\r\n     From Viterbo, the 7th of May, 1527, 3 P.M.\r\n\r\n     To the most illustrious Lords, the Duke of Urbino and the\r\n     Marquis of Saluzzo, Captains of the League.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Letter from Scipione ... to Alessandro Moresino, alias\r\nVenezianello, Master of the Chamber of the Prince Guidobaldo, dated\r\nat Urbino, 20th of May, 1527, narrating the destruction of Rome._\r\n\r\n     Most dear as an honoured brother,\r\n\r\n     I wish I were fitter than at present, and more easy\r\n     in mind, to write you of the strange, horrible, and\r\n     atrocious event befallen the wretched, miserable, and\r\n     ill-fated city of Rome. Although I feel assured that,\r\n     from different advices, you will have had partial, if not\r\n     full accounts, nevertheless, that I may not fail in duty,\r\n     I have thought it best to inform you of all I have yet\r\n     heard, notwithstanding that I tell it with aching heart and\r\n     tearful eye.\r\n\r\n     I therefore inform you that eight days ago last Monday,\r\n     being the 18th inst., about 22 o'clock [half-past 5\r\n     P.M.], the Spanish imperial army presented itself\r\n     at the bastion of the gate. Their object was to make trial,\r\n     and see how and by whom it was guarded, not having courage\r\n     to attack; but after consulting together, and deciding\r\n     to assault, and even to make their way into the city,\r\n     they took some food, and then suddenly and all in a mass\r\n     attempted with furious impetuosity to force the bastion,\r\n     which is said to have been ill guarded, there being but\r\n     four thousand regular infantry in Rome. In this attack,\r\n     both sides behaved with great bravery, and were supposed\r\n     to have lost about one thousand men, including the flower\r\n     of the Spaniards. Bourbon, observing the slaughter and\r\n     immense confusion, rushed on with all the lansquenets.\r\n     The castle maintained a fire of artillery as they best\r\n     could; but the air being obscured by a dense fog, they\r\n     could not see the effect of it, and battered down a piece\r\n     of wall.[253] Through it, and by storming the bastion, the\r\n     Imperialists entered, and there Bourbon met his death from\r\n     an arquebus-shot, which passed quite through his belly.\r\n     The papal troops, unable to offer more resistance, fled\r\n     towards the castle, into which most of them were admitted,\r\n     especially those who arrived first. It is rumoured,\r\n     but not confirmed, that the Lord Stefano Colonna, who\r\n     commanded the guard at that bastion, capitulated. Next day,\r\n     being Tuesday, the enemy, though within the town, made\r\n     no aggressions, but proceeded cautiously, dreading some\r\n     ambush. Having, however, assured themselves that there was\r\n     no cause for mistrust, they began to spread over the city,\r\n     and to plunder the monasteries, nunneries, and hospitals,\r\n     with great slaughter of those found therein. The hospital\r\n     of San Spirito was destroyed, and the patients were thrown\r\n     into the Tiber, after which they commenced attacking the\r\n     palaces of cardinals and gentlemen, with much bloodshed and\r\n     cruelty; and I have been told this morning by Francesco,\r\n     son of Battista Riceco, that one Maestro Jacomo, the first\r\n     perfumer in Rome, is come to his house, having escaped\r\n     with four other chance companions, whom, being a very old\r\n     friend, he has thought it necessary to receive kindly in\r\n     his house; and he learned from him as certain, having been\r\n     witness to it, that the lansquenets, that inhuman and\r\n     villainous race of Lutheran infidels, slew without mercy\r\n     those of all ages, sexes, and conditions whom they found in\r\n     the streets; also, that they attacked Cardinal Cesarini's\r\n     palace, wherein were many Roman gentlemen, guarded by two\r\n     hundred infantry; and having stormed it, put them all to\r\n     the sword, it being uncertain if the Cardinal himself were\r\n     there. Thence they proceeded to the Spanish Archbishop\r\n     of Cosenza's palace, wherein were some five hundred of\r\n     his countrymen, men of credit inhabiting Rome, who had\r\n     retired thither as to a place of safety; but all, without\r\n     exception, were cut to pieces. They next went to the house\r\n     of Messer Domenico de' Massimi, a Roman gentleman, who had\r\n     there his wife and two children, with many noble persons\r\n     of the city of all ages, every individual of whom were\r\n     slain--men, women, children, servants, maids; and it was\r\n     the same in many others, whose names I do not remember,\r\n     so that the dead bodies lie in heaps in the houses and\r\n     palaces of the nobility, each day getting worse. Fancy the\r\n     affliction of the poor ladies, seeing husbands, brothers,\r\n     children massacred before their eyes, without the power of\r\n     aiding them, and worse still, they were themselves killed\r\n     next moment. It is not believed that had the Turk come on\r\n     such an enterprise, his barbarity would have equalled that\r\n     daily, continuously, and perseveringly practised by these\r\n     ruffians. I cannot imagine a greater purgatory or hell than\r\n     to hear the weeping and lamentation there must be in that\r\n     afflicted city.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 253: This letter, though inaccurate in several\r\n     details, the author writing at a distance from the events,\r\n     affords curious evidence of the consternation generally\r\n     occasioned by the sack of Rome.]\r\n\r\n     But I forgot that he told me they were barricading the\r\n     Marchioness of Mantua's palace, as he left Rome, in which\r\n     were her Excellency, with many Roman ladies, who had fled\r\n     there as to an asylum, but the result was not known. He\r\n     also said that the _Bande nere_ of the late Lord Giovanni\r\n     de' Medici were to have from the Pope double pay for\r\n     their services, which his Holiness refusing, a part of\r\n     them remained in Rome, and the rest went off in disgust\r\n     and joined the Spaniards in plundering, being the foremost\r\n     to assault that bastion which was defended by their\r\n     comrades, and having, in fact, secured the Imperialists\r\n     their victory, as without them neither the lansquenets nor\r\n     Spaniards had ever got into the city.\r\n\r\n     The Pope is in the castle, with many cardinals and other\r\n     persons of station: they are said to have a year's\r\n     provisions, with ample ammunition and artillery. This\r\n     Maestro Giacomo says he heard that the Imperialists,\r\n     dubious of succours, thought of fortifying the bridges,\r\n     with the intention of holding their ground against any\r\n     who might annoy them. As yet the lansquenets have made\r\n     no prisoners, but the Spaniards have pillaged immensely,\r\n     and taken vast numbers of men, women, priests, and people\r\n     of all sorts, so that there is, from Rome to Naples, an\r\n     uninterrupted stream of baggage and prisoners sent by\r\n     them. He also mentions that the chief of Colonna most\r\n     courageously charged the lansquenets, crying Colonna!\r\n     Colonna! but after a great fray, he was beaten and his\r\n     followers killed, whereupon Pompeo Colonna, thinking to\r\n     elevate himself and put down his enemies, fled away, and\r\n     neither he nor any of his house have been since heard of.\r\n     It was reported that four soldiers were killed in entering\r\n     the castle, but this is since contradicted. Cardinal del\r\n     Monte and many more cardinals are missing, and it is not\r\n     known if they got in there, or are dead, or taken, or\r\n     escaped. It is suspected that these anti-Christian dogs\r\n     will put all Rome to flames; and we may anticipate that\r\n     after suffering all this rapine, pillage, slaughter,\r\n     and captivity, it will soon have to endure a grievous\r\n     pestilence, from the number of dead bodies left in the\r\n     palaces and houses, which no one removes for burial, and\r\n     which are putrefying in masses, so that no one can enter,\r\n     on account of the stench, without inhaling infection. It\r\n     is also said that, a day or two ago one of the Pope's\r\n     chamberlains was secretly sent by his Holiness from the\r\n     castle in the night to our Duke [of Urbino], to inform him\r\n     of the state of matters, and to exhort him and the other\r\n     captains of the League to push on with the army to his\r\n     aid; and that all these other leaders having repaired\r\n     to consult with his Lordship, they unanimously resolved\r\n     to press forward. We hear that his Excellency is to-day\r\n     at Orvieto, and will reach Viterbo to-morrow; also that\r\n     he will make a general levy, and give bounty to all who\r\n     will enlist. His Excellency has written the Governor a\r\n     very affectionate letter, praying him to exhort all those\r\n     here who have been soldiers to go in search of honourable\r\n     service, with money and all they may require. The Governor\r\n     has circulated copies of this letter throughout the state,\r\n     and has made proclamation, so that they are embodying many\r\n     men to join his Excellency. On Saturday, Vincenzo Ubaldino\r\n     and Pier-Matteo di Thomasello will start from this with a\r\n     fine and good detachment. I am sorry not to be able to send\r\n     you a copy of this letter, which it would really have done\r\n     your heart good to read. You could hardly believe how much\r\n     vexation this misfortune to Rome has caused here; and when\r\n     people of station discuss it, as they often do, I assure\r\n     you I have seen them weep as freely as if it were their\r\n     own. All that I have related I tell you just as I heard it\r\n     from others. I would I were speaking untruths, and that it\r\n     were all false; but I shall say no more. The Lady Madonna\r\n     Emilia sends you hearty commendations, and reminds you not\r\n     to give yourself such airs as to forget her. From Urbino,\r\n     the 20th May, 1527. Entirely your brother,\r\n\r\n     SCIPIONE ARRIS....\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Letter from Mercurino da Gattinara, Commissary of the Imperial\r\nArmy during the sack of Rome, wherein he informs the Emperor of the\r\nentrance into that city, of the slaughter and havock inflicted, and\r\nof the arrangement made through him with Clement VII., and how during\r\nfour successive days he repaired to the Castle of St. Angelo to\r\nnegotiate with the Pope and thirteen cardinals there inclosed._[254]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 254: Vat. Ottob. MSS. No. 2607.]\r\n\r\n     Most sacred Cæsar,\r\n\r\n     I have this written in Italian by another hand, being\r\n     unable to do so with my own in consequence of meeting with\r\n     an accident, as I shall presently explain. I have to inform\r\n     your Majesty that Monsieur di Borbone, being near Florence\r\n     and Siena with his army, and understanding that the former\r\n     of these cities was well fortified, and contained the\r\n     forces of the League ready to defend it, rendering a siege\r\n     impossible, or at all events so protracted as to endanger\r\n     your Majesty's troops from want of provisions and other\r\n     stores, whilst the lack of pay risked their disbanding\r\n     and losing all;--aware, on the other hand, that Rome had\r\n     been disarmed, and that to seize and bring it and the\r\n     Pontiff to great straits was to gain everything, or at all\r\n     events would prove a measure so useful and advantageous\r\n     as to content your Majesty;--it appeared to him better to\r\n     abandon his designs upon Florence, and, advancing by forced\r\n     marches, to beleaguer Rome, thereby anticipating the army\r\n     of the League, and preventing them from succouring it,\r\n     for which purpose he determined to leave his artillery in\r\n     Siena. Accordingly, when this was decided, the confederates\r\n     being in Florence, and we thirty miles on this side of it,\r\n     we advanced with the utmost diligence, doing twenty or\r\n     four-and-twenty miles a day, which was something quite new\r\n     for the army, so numerous, so distressed by past fatigues,\r\n     and by recent and actual hunger.[255] Thus, on Saturday\r\n     the 4th instant, it was quartered at Isola, seven miles\r\n     from Rome. M. di Borbone and his officers were astonished\r\n     that the Pope and cardinals should await the army and the\r\n     threatened danger, whilst Rome was incapable of defence,\r\n     without submitting some proposal by envoy or letter, or\r\n     even answering a despatch sent to his Holiness by M. di\r\n     Borbone and the Viceroy as to the terms of agreement. Some\r\n     of your Majesty's good servants suggested that were the\r\n     army under the walls it was doubtful if they could carry\r\n     them, from want of artillery, in which event their own\r\n     destruction would follow; on the other hand, that in case\r\n     of taking the city it would be sacked, which could be no\r\n     good service to your Majesty, as its plunder would occasion\r\n     the army to disperse, the Spaniards and Italians straggling\r\n     towards Naples, or, should they not break up, they might\r\n     demand immense arrears of pay, which not being discharged\r\n     from want of means, everything would fall into confusion.\r\n     For these reasons they recommended Borbone so to dispose\r\n     his forces as to keep matters open for arrangement with the\r\n     Pope. Of this advice he openly approved, desirous of any\r\n     plan which should provide pay for the army. He, however,\r\n     declared that he would not abstain from annoying the\r\n     enemy, nor allow them time to provide for their interests,\r\n     alleging that the Admiral [Bonnivet] of France, from not\r\n     having taken Rome when he could, in order to save it from a\r\n     sack, was unable afterwards to do so, it being defended by\r\n     the Lord Prospero Colonna: also that, on another occasion,\r\n     when Monsieur di Chaumont beleaguered Bologna, Fabrizio\r\n     Colonna threw in succours whilst the French general was\r\n     treating with Julius II., who thereupon broke off the\r\n     parley: finally, that it became a pontiff rather to seek a\r\n     capitulation than to wait until it was demanded of him.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 255: As a specimen of the very loose diction even\r\n     of public despatches in this age, and of the obstacles\r\n     which a translator has to encounter, we shall render\r\n     literally the next sentence, or rather half page, sentences\r\n     not being divided in the original. \"And so the fourth\r\n     day of the present month of May, which was Saturday, the\r\n     foresaid army made his lodgment at seven miles from Rome,\r\n     in a place which is called the Isle; Monsieur di Borbone\r\n     and all the principal persons were filled with much\r\n     wonder that the Pope and so many cardinals and all Rome,\r\n     being disarmed, should wait for such an army and great\r\n     danger, without sending to the said Monsieur di Borbone\r\n     an ambassador to make some parley, nor letters, or answer\r\n     to his letters which the said M. di Borbone had formerly\r\n     written, and the Viceroy, to his Holiness about the affair\r\n     of the agreement.\"]\r\n\r\n     Monsieur di Borbone accordingly decided on approaching the\r\n     walls, and on Sunday morning the 5th we made a lodgment\r\n     within [beyond?] St. Peter's palace, hard by the monastery\r\n     of S. Pancrazio. Yet he did not neglect addressing a\r\n     letter to the Pontiff on that morning, exhorting him to\r\n     make a favourable capitulation rather than abide the\r\n     unpleasant alternative. It was at the same time suggested\r\n     whether it might not be well for him to repair to his\r\n     Holiness; but considering that he could not go for want of\r\n     a safe-conduct, it seemed better for him to remain; he,\r\n     however, sent the letter by a trumpet, whom the enemy did\r\n     not allow to pass, the missive remaining in their hands,\r\n     and we know not whether it reached the Pope; at all events,\r\n     no answer ever came, which was demanded before half-past\r\n     seven P.M. of that day, after which it would be no\r\n     longer possible to restrain the army. For these reasons,\r\n     as evening approached, it was resolved to get the ladders\r\n     all prepared for an assault the following morning on the\r\n     Borgo towards the furnaces, where the wall was considered\r\n     very weak. And so the assault was given on Monday morning\r\n     the 6th of May in this year 1527, when by an unlucky\r\n     chance the Lord di Borbone was hit in the abdomen towards\r\n     the right thigh, of which wound he presently died. Yet\r\n     notwithstanding this accident, which was not at once\r\n     known to the army, the undertaking was carried through,\r\n     and the Borgo was plundered that morning. The Pope, with\r\n     most of the cardinals and court, were in the castle, but\r\n     on hearing what had occurred they hastily retired to the\r\n     castle of S. Angelo. Meanwhile our soldiery sacked the\r\n     whole Borgo, and slew most of the people whom they found,\r\n     taking a few prisoners. The enemy's forces then in the city\r\n     are supposed not to have exceeded three thousand, unused\r\n     to arms, so that it was scarcely defended; the dense fog\r\n     which prevailed during that day was likewise inopportune,\r\n     preventing them seeing each other; and the struggle did not\r\n     last in all above two hours. We afterwards learned that\r\n     the Pope and the citizens, relying upon the assurances of\r\n     Renzo da Ceri, considered both Rome and the Borgo to be\r\n     impregnable without artillery, and looked for support from\r\n     the confederate army.\r\n\r\n     The Pontiff being thus within the castle, and such of the\r\n     citizens as were armed having joined their handful of\r\n     troops for defence of the bridges and of the Transtevere\r\n     quarter, the Borgo was occupied by a large portion of our\r\n     army, and its leaders were assembled in council, when there\r\n     arrived the Portuguese ambassador to say that some Romans,\r\n     his neighbours, had, with the Pope's sanction, urged him\r\n     to make terms. The answer given him was that the council\r\n     would be ready to treat, so soon as the Pope had placed\r\n     in their hands the Ponte Molle and Transtevere, to which\r\n     proposal no reply was returned during that day. A brigade\r\n     of our troops having carried the Transtevere, and possessed\r\n     themselves of the Ponte Sisto and Sta. Maria, the whole\r\n     army passed into the city early on that evening of the\r\n     6th. As the inhabitants in general relied on its being\r\n     defended, none of them had fled or removed their property,\r\n     so that no one of whatever nation, rank, condition, age,\r\n     or sex escaped becoming prisoners--not even women in the\r\n     convents. They were treated without distinction according\r\n     to the caprice of the soldiery; and after being plundered\r\n     of all their effects most of them were compelled by\r\n     torture or otherwise to pay ransom. Cardinals Cesarini,\r\n     della Valle, and di Siena, being imperialists, considered\r\n     themselves safe, and remained in their houses, whither\r\n     also there retired Cardinal ..., Fra Giacobatio, and many\r\n     friends with their women and valuables; but finding no\r\n     sanctuary there, they had to compound with certain captains\r\n     and soldiers for security of their persons and property;\r\n     notwithstanding which, these houses were completely\r\n     pillaged three or four days afterwards, and they had enough\r\n     to do to save their lives. Some women who had carried all\r\n     their earthly possessions to Cardinal Colonna's residence\r\n     were left with but a single cloak and shift. Cardinals S.\r\n     Sisto and della Minerva, who stayed at home, are still in\r\n     the soldiers' power, being too poor to pay their ransom.\r\n     All the church ornaments are stolen, the sacred utensils\r\n     thrown about, the relics gone to destruction--for the\r\n     troops in abstracting their precious receptacles heeded\r\n     these no more than as many bits of wood: even the shrine\r\n     of the _sancta sanctorum_ was sacked, although regarded\r\n     with peculiar reverence. St. Peter's church and the papal\r\n     palace from top to bottom have been made into stables.\r\n     I feel confident that your Majesty as a Catholic and\r\n     most Christian emperor will feel displeasure at these\r\n     gross outrages and insults to the Catholic religion, the\r\n     Apostolic See, and the city of Rome. In truth, every one\r\n     is convinced that all this has happened as a judgment\r\n     from GOD on the great tyranny and disorders of\r\n     the papal court; but however this may be, there has been\r\n     vast destruction, for which no redress can be had but from\r\n     your Majesty's arm and authority. This army has no head,\r\n     no divisions, no discipline, no organisation, but every\r\n     one behaves according to his own fancy. The Lord Prince\r\n     of Orange and Giovanni di Urbino, with the other leaders,\r\n     do what they can, but to little purpose; for in entering\r\n     Rome the lansquenets have conducted themselves like true\r\n     Lutherans, and the rest like actual.... Most of the troops\r\n     are enriched by the enormous booty, amounting to many\r\n     millions of gold. A majority of the Spaniards will, it is\r\n     supposed, retire to Naples with their spoil.\r\n\r\n     But to resume our narrative. On the morning after our\r\n     entry, being Tuesday the 7th, the Pope wrote a letter\r\n     to our leaders, praying them to send me to his Holiness\r\n     to hear certain proposals. By their order I went into\r\n     S. Angelo, where I found thirteen cardinals in great\r\n     affliction, as was natural in the circumstances. His\r\n     Holiness in their presence told me, that since fortune, on\r\n     which he too much relied, had brought him to this pass,\r\n     he would not think of any resistance, but was content to\r\n     place his own person and that of the cardinals, and his\r\n     state, in your Majesty's hands, and that he desired me to\r\n     mediate with the captains for some favourable arrangement.\r\n     I did my best to comfort his Holiness and the cardinals,\r\n     showing them how satisfied they must be that your Majesty\r\n     never intended to injure either his Holiness or the\r\n     Apostolic See; but that great blame attached to them,\r\n     seeing they might, on certain fair conditions and by a\r\n     sum of money, have prevented our army from approaching so\r\n     near, which would have averted the destruction of Rome;\r\n     since, however, GOD had so willed it, that his\r\n     plan seemed to me good, of placing himself in the hands\r\n     of your Majesty, as there was no remedy or redress to be\r\n     looked for but from that quarter. Taking upon me the charge\r\n     imposed by my office as mediator, I passed several times\r\n     between the council of war and the Pontiff, and succeeded\r\n     in the course of four days in concluding a capitulation,\r\n     which is generally considered reasonable and advantageous\r\n     to your Majesty's service, as to which I shall only say\r\n     that your Majesty will judge, after seeing its terms\r\n     and learning its progress. There arose on our side an\r\n     obstacle to prevent the execution of this agreement, which\r\n     was the bad discipline of the Germans, who took a fancy\r\n     not to quit Rome, nor confirm any truce, until they had\r\n     received all arrears of pay, amounting, according to their\r\n     calculation, to 300,000 scudi. But as the Pope could put\r\n     down but 100,000 scudi, even after selling everything\r\n     within the castle, of his own valuables and those of the\r\n     cardinals and prelates, and the church ornaments, the\r\n     affair could not be brought to a happy issue, so much so\r\n     that I greatly feared the brutality of these Germans and\r\n     the blunders of others would have lost all the fruits of\r\n     our enterprise, especially as the army of the League is\r\n     supposed not to be more than twenty or twenty-five miles\r\n     distant, and as some of their detachments have already\r\n     tried to carry off his Holiness by night. After several\r\n     days had passed in disputing with the lansquenets, the\r\n     expedient was adopted of handing them over all the cash\r\n     produced by the Pontiff--the Prince of Orange and other\r\n     captains undertaking that they should be paid [the balance]\r\n     out of the first moneys raised, and Parma and Piacenza\r\n     being consigned in security. I was obliged to concede\r\n     to them these conditions, in order to carry through the\r\n     capitulation, and so secure the benefit of our enterprise,\r\n     as well as to elude their anxiety to get the Pope and\r\n     cardinals into their clutches, upon which they were greatly\r\n     set. And this arrangement is really of such importance that\r\n     most of your Majesty's servants are willing to undertake\r\n     any obligation towards these lansquenets, in order to\r\n     ensure the Pope's and cardinals' safety. There is still\r\n     some hitch about raising the 100,000 scudi, but we trust\r\n     means will be found; meanwhile, it has been resolved to\r\n     throw three hundred infantry into the castle to-morrow,\r\n     under some leader, to secure it and all in it; and we shall\r\n     see gradually to get the rest brought about.\r\n\r\n     In return for my toils, anxieties, and services, I was\r\n     wounded from an arquebus in S. Angelo on the fourth day,\r\n     whilst approaching the castle to treat with the Pope.\r\n     The ball passed through my right arm, which prevents me\r\n     from writing, but I hope in time to get over it. And\r\n     notwithstanding this accident befallen me, from no fault\r\n     of his Holiness, whilst on your Majesty's service and in\r\n     so righteous a work, I shall endure it all patiently, in\r\n     the hope that your Majesty will consider my exertions, and\r\n     the losses sustained by me in limb and estate, and out of\r\n     your clemency and compassion will not omit some fitting\r\n     recompence.\r\n\r\n     After writing the above on the 19th inst., I returned to\r\n     the castle to conclude the arrangements with the Pope and\r\n     cardinals, and complete the convention; and in consequence\r\n     of certain articles being added regarding the entry of our\r\n     people into S. Angelo, I sought to remodel the treaty.\r\n     The Lord Vespasiano Colonna, and the Abbot of Nigera\r\n     accompanied me; and after protracted discussion with the\r\n     Pontiff regarding the difficulty of raising the 100,000\r\n     scudi, we had recourse to certain merchants who, on a\r\n     guarantee from his Holiness and the cardinals, promised to\r\n     make up a balance of 20,000 wanted to complete that sum.\r\n     This point being settled, I insisted on reforming the\r\n     treaty, and that your Majesty's troops might on that very\r\n     day take possession of the fortress, as had been agreed\r\n     on. But his Holiness endeavoured all day to postpone this\r\n     on various pretexts, and at length, when pressed by us to\r\n     decide, as we would wait no longer, he replied, \"I shall\r\n     speak frankly; having advices that the confederate army\r\n     is at hand to relieve me, I desire, meanwhile, that you\r\n     give me a limited time to await their succours, on the\r\n     expiry of which I shall perform all the stipulations of the\r\n     capitulation. Nor is this any unreasonable request, as I\r\n     shall be satisfied with six days, and as similar conditions\r\n     are never refused to any fortress about to surrender.\"\r\n     I replied to the Pontiff and the cardinals, that your\r\n     Majesty's army had little apprehension of any such\r\n     succours, being always victorious; but that his Holiness\r\n     would do well to consider how your Majesty's captains,\r\n     on receiving such an answer, would conclude him and the\r\n     cardinals to have been merely trifling with them to gain\r\n     time: indeed, I was satisfied that they would consider it\r\n     a positive rupture, and would suddenly assault the castle,\r\n     and storm it so furiously that these, or even better terms,\r\n     would no longer be listened to, leaving no opportunity for\r\n     repentance or remedy short of the final destruction of the\r\n     Holy See. On hearing these views, the Pope and cardinals\r\n     were greatly bewildered, apprehending that they would be\r\n     realised should they wait for relief, and in this dilemma\r\n     remained gazing on each other, but asked a quarter of an\r\n     hour for consultation. Eventually there arose a wrangle\r\n     among the cardinals, those of the French faction wishing\r\n     to await succours at all hazards; so the Pontiff excused\r\n     himself from settling the matter according to his own wish,\r\n     ever urging a delay of six days. I believe the authors of\r\n     this opposition to have been Alberto da Carpi, the Datary\r\n     Orazio Baglione, Gregorio Casale the English ambassador,\r\n     and such like.\r\n\r\n     Having retired from the castle with Lord Vespasiano and\r\n     the Abbot, we related everything to our leaders, whereupon\r\n     it was decided to open that very night a trench round\r\n     the fortress, the whole army turning out under arms. It\r\n     was found no easy matter to muster them, all being idle\r\n     and intent on pillage; nor would they quit the houses,\r\n     especially the lansquenets, who at first thought it a mere\r\n     trick to get them out. At length, after great exertions,\r\n     the enemy being ascertained but seven miles off, all ran\r\n     to arms, and your Majesty's army was well disposed for\r\n     battle: indeed, I suspect the enemy found their calculation\r\n     disappointed, that most of our soldiery having become rich,\r\n     would no longer flock to their standards. Some Spanish and\r\n     German troops are expected; but I know not if they will\r\n     arrive in time, as the trench is already made, so that\r\n     neither Pope nor any one else shall escape.\r\n\r\n     Such is the present state of your Majesty's affairs, and I\r\n     trust they will ever have successful issue. Yet it is true\r\n     that, after the death of M. di Borbone, great confusion\r\n     occurred in the army, as no one knew whom to acknowledge as\r\n     its chief. I think that had he lived, Rome would, perhaps,\r\n     not have been sacked, and matters might have taken a\r\n     better course and result for your Majesty's interests. Yet\r\n     GOD so willed it, and we need not talk of what\r\n     cannot now be helped. But my affectionate duty to your\r\n     Majesty requires me to report certain things requiring from\r\n     your Majesty the oversight of a captain-general; of the\r\n     individual I say nothing, not wishing presumptuously to\r\n     name any one. On M. di Borbone's death, the day we entered\r\n     Rome, the captains and counsellors in the army discussed\r\n     giving its command to the Viceroy of Naples, then at Siena.\r\n     The Prince of Orange remarked that he had acknowledged\r\n     the authority of di Borbone, but would not submit to the\r\n     Viceroy. It being suggested by some that the Duke of\r\n     Ferrara was coming as your Majesty's captain-general, the\r\n     Prince replied, that on his arrival, he would acknowledge\r\n     him, but that meanwhile, no one being commissioned by your\r\n     Majesty, he neither would set himself up as captain, nor at\r\n     all permit others to be so without your Majesty's command.\r\n     These words he addressed to Giovanni d'Urbino, who then,\r\n     and on subsequent occasions, modestly remarked that he was\r\n     content to acknowledge the Prince, with other complimentary\r\n     phrases. Now the Prince has taken the notion of being\r\n     himself captain-general, and thus affairs are conducted in\r\n     his name, not, however, with that title, but as the first\r\n     person in the army, being much liked by the Germans. Your\r\n     Majesty will do as seems best.\r\n\r\n     One thing requires your Majesty's careful consideration,\r\n     namely, how this city of Rome is to be governed, and\r\n     whether or not anything of the Apostolic See is to be\r\n     retained. I shall not conceal the opinion of some that it\r\n     should not be entirely abolished; for if that See were\r\n     transported elsewhere, it seems certain that it will be\r\n     utterly ruined, seeing that, in that case, the King of\r\n     France will set up a patriarch in his realm, refusing\r\n     obedience to the Apostolic See, the English and Spanish\r\n     Sovereigns doing the like. But this should be seen to\r\n     without delay, otherwise the professional men and notaries\r\n     will all be gone, and Rome will be quite reduced, as they\r\n     will lose both their appointments and their practice.\r\n     The Pope and those cardinals with him, told me that your\r\n     Majesty should make provision for this, otherwise all would\r\n     be lost. Your Majesty will act in this for the best.\r\n\r\n     There are three other points to which it is necessary that\r\n     your Majesty should attend by anticipation. One is, what\r\n     would your Majesty wish done, should his Holiness and\r\n     those cardinals go to Naples as has been proposed; ought\r\n     they to be taken to Spain or not? Another is, what if the\r\n     Pope should escape from the castle by aid of the enemy?\r\n     In the third place, should it come to an assault and the\r\n     Pontiff unluckily fall? It is my belief, however, that, on\r\n     expiry of the six days which he has demanded, and which\r\n     are already running, he, on finding no efficient succour,\r\n     will again come to parley and propose a capitulation. Yet\r\n     I have my misgivings lest your Majesty's interests should\r\n     be crossed by the fury of the lansquenets, who declare they\r\n     must get hold of him. But your Majesty's faithful servants\r\n     will not cease to consider how these interests can be\r\n     promoted; and now that the Lord Marquis del Vasto, the Lord\r\n     Don Ugo, with Marcone, are coming, perhaps their advice\r\n     will put things into better train.\r\n\r\n     I have resolved to discharge my duty by informing your\r\n     Majesty of these occurrences, but would to God I could\r\n     have despatched a courier to your Majesty daily as they\r\n     proceeded. Four days ago the Cardinal and others of the\r\n     Colonna were not in the neighbourhood, but he is since\r\n     arrived, with Lords Vespasiano and Ascanio, who do their\r\n     best in your Majesty's behalf.\r\n\r\n     The above I have retained until the 24th of May, and as\r\n     no courier is gone, I shall here note what has since\r\n     happened. Your Majesty must know that on the Pope declining\r\n     to accept the capitulation which I have mentioned above,\r\n     your Majesty's captains and counsellors began diligently to\r\n     surround the castle with trenches, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX III\r\n\r\n(Page 22)\r\n\r\nTHE DUKE OF URBINO'S JUSTIFICATION, 1527.[256]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 256: Sanuto Diarii, xlv. 352.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe print this document with hesitation, and solely from its being the\r\nDuke's own and formal defence against very serious charges; which,\r\nhowever, it leaves untouched. It is a futile attempt to evade these\r\nby feeble and puling recrimination; to distract attention from their\r\ntrue merits by circumlocutions and reiterations, which our version\r\nhas somewhat condensed. The original is one unbroken sentence, rudely\r\nconstructed, apparently of purpose to mystify the reader.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter of the Lord Duke of Urbino, Captain-general to the Signory of\r\nVenice, dated under Monteleone, 9th July, 1527._\r\n\r\n     By your Sublimity's letters to the most illustrious lord\r\n     Proveditore Pisani, and from my ambassador accredited\r\n     to you, I have learnt, to my infinite dissatisfaction\r\n     and surprise, the suspicions entertained by you lest\r\n     the illustrious lady Duchess, my consort, and my son\r\n     should secretly leave Venice, and the doubts of my good\r\n     faith which you by implication exhibit in denying them\r\n     permission to quit the city; regarding which it seems\r\n     necessary first to recapitulate to your Signory what I had\r\n     formerly charged my resident to explain to you, to this\r\n     effect. Since, from the very outset of this war, it has\r\n     generally happened to me not to accomplish my intentions\r\n     for your service and my own honour, and to be blamed for\r\n     failures resulting from the occurrence of impossibilities,\r\n     or from the blunders of others, whilst with mind and\r\n     body I was exclusively occupied on what might prove\r\n     advantageous and creditable,--I determined, for these\r\n     and other considerations which, out of modesty, I omit,\r\n     seeing the bad success with which I had, on this occasion,\r\n     borne arms, to yield to my evil fortune on the expiry of\r\n     my engagement; which I considered to be clearly ended at\r\n     the close of three years; nor again to expose my honour\r\n     to question, from no fault of mine. And, on this account,\r\n     I have all along and often said I would not continue,\r\n     which may be attested by all the commissioners employed\r\n     by your Serenity in this war, to whom, as to many others\r\n     you are accustomed to credit, I repeatedly stated this.\r\n     Passing over for the present the good reasons, already well\r\n     known to your Sublimity, which induced me to forget all\r\n     this, and treat of a re-engagement, with the disposition\r\n     to remain on,--as well as those considerations which,\r\n     renewing the first impressions, made me again deliberately\r\n     fall back upon my project, yet with the full intention\r\n     not to abandon the cause of your Sublimity, unless the\r\n     expected succours should arrive, or until I had placed it\r\n     in safety, even should this necessitate my staying long\r\n     after the conclusion of my service; thinking also that,\r\n     I having no opposite interest, the enemy ought to let me\r\n     rest in my intention, and in a firm resolution neither to\r\n     take up arms, nor otherwise act against your Sublimity\r\n     and your interests; nevertheless, considering that, were\r\n     I to quit you at the close of three years, from all these\r\n     and numerous other reasons, which might probably occasion\r\n     me annoyance, I might be exposed to the surmise of having\r\n     acted, not from such motives, but that, on observing the\r\n     success of the other side, I wished, by attaching myself\r\n     to a prosperous cause, to evade adversity; and my chief\r\n     object ever being to preserve my honour intact, not only\r\n     from stain, but even from suspicion;--on these accounts,\r\n     and from the difficulty that arose as to finding myself at\r\n     freedom in regard to the two years of _beneplacito_,[257] I\r\n     decided to serve, in order not to expose my honour to any\r\n     reflection. Yet, in addition to all that passed in private\r\n     between the Proveditore and myself, when I told him I would\r\n     and should serve your Sublimity without further demands,\r\n     and that he might freely dispose of me, I, even in the\r\n     public council, stated my views as to maintaining these\r\n     bands, and constituting them the mainspring of the war. For\r\n     the whole of which considerations, I declared that I would\r\n     serve your Sublimity, without regard to life or anything\r\n     else, as I have uniformly done, in order more fully to\r\n     satisfy all the Lords of Council that what I proposed I\r\n     was, and more than ever am, anxious to do, in conjunction\r\n     with them. And if the dates of letters be examined, it\r\n     will be distinctly seen that each of these circumstances\r\n     occurred much before I had heard, or could have heard, a\r\n     word as to any doubt or distrust of me being exhibited,\r\n     which, in my opinion, ought not to be, even were I to take\r\n     my leave. Thus I had no apprehension; yet, as my intention\r\n     of so acting was founded on what might fairly be done, I\r\n     did not suppose that by your Sublimity it would have been\r\n     not only opposed, but even gainsaid, in restoring to me\r\n     my son when I should ask him of you, as I meant to do. In\r\n     such case you might well consider that, even had I any\r\n     intention to fail you,--a thing you could not and ought not\r\n     to suppose from my former life,--you would have known how\r\n     to adopt, and would have adopted, measures suitable to such\r\n     intentions, and not so frequently have said and reiterated,\r\n     chiefly to the agents of your Sublimity, that you wished\r\n     me to be gone; and this after I had voluntarily given into\r\n     your hands my lady consort and my son, when there was, and\r\n     could be, no obligation to do so beyond the suggestions of\r\n     my thorough sincerity. And, with a view to establish this,\r\n     I lately offered you three proposals,--first, my person,\r\n     which is here at your Sublimity's disposal in your service;\r\n     second, my son, who is now in your hands; third, my state,\r\n     with its fortresses, which I willingly would offer your\r\n     Sublimity, to be kept, along with myself, in your service\r\n     and disposal, as full guarantee and security; although I\r\n     know not what better satisfaction you can require besides\r\n     my free action, whereby I so long and often have manifested\r\n     my disposition. And most clear, in my opinion, are the\r\n     many reasons which freely induced me; all of which, and\r\n     more too, were they not already so known, I am prepared to\r\n     maintain in case of need. Hence my modesty, serene Prince,\r\n     will not, in these circumstances, let me stop to say how\r\n     great a wrong I suffer; yet to no one, not even to your\r\n     Sublimity, have I given cause or occasion to depreciate my\r\n     good faith, which was, is, and ever shall be, most sincere.\r\n     And, although it be considered impossible that you can do\r\n     anything without that wisdom which becomes your dignity, I\r\n     nevertheless have grounds for complaint, and am exceedingly\r\n     vexed that my ill luck has been so in the ascendant\r\n     as,--after all the efforts and perils of my life, and the\r\n     loss of so many followers in your service, for which I have\r\n     heeded no calamities,--instead of the gratitude which I\r\n     might reasonably have promised myself from you, to occasion\r\n     such marked dishonour; so that, ever since my birth, I may\r\n     say that my life has been passed in ceaseless travails\r\n     and difficulties. And, if you have thought fit to believe\r\n     any malicious and spiteful fellow, I ought not to be the\r\n     victim, though he be an astute and wily foe, who, well\r\n     aware that I maintained myself to be at liberty, and very\r\n     often declared myself unwilling to remain, has spread some\r\n     rumours against me, reckoning that, if in nothing else, he\r\n     would, at all events, have the satisfaction of circulating\r\n     that distrust of me which is already apparent, although I\r\n     ought not on that account to be slandered. I do, therefore,\r\n     with the greatest possible urgency, beseech you to\r\n     investigate the truth; and, if I be blameable, to visit me\r\n     with such punishment as I merit; or, if found innocent, to\r\n     liberate me, by a suitable public acknowledgment, from the\r\n     stigma under which I lie. And, commending myself to your\r\n     favour, I remind you that all these past thoughts of mine\r\n     arose from no private interest of my own, but from despair\r\n     at being unable, by no fault of mine, to do what your\r\n     service and my honour demanded, and at being prevented, by\r\n     past circumstances, from effecting what I had previously\r\n     hoped to accomplish, although no exertions of mind or body\r\n     were wanting on my part. From beneath Monteleone, the 9th\r\n     of July, 1527.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 257: A _condotto_, or military engagement, was usually\r\nfor so many years certain, and one or two more at the option or\r\n_beneplacito_ of parties.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX IV\r\n\r\n(Page 27)\r\n\r\nSKETCH OF THE NEGOTIATIONS OF CASTIGLIONE AT THE COURT OF MADRID,\r\n1525 TO 1529, COMPILED FROM THE ABBÉ SERASSI'S PREFACE TO VOL. II. OF\r\nCASTIGLIONE'S LETTERS, AND CORRECTED FROM AUTHENTIC SOURCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn his arrival at Madrid, in March, 1525, Castiglione found the\r\nEmperor and his ministers much disposed for peace; but matters\r\nsoon assumed a totally different aspect, on news of the victory of\r\nPavia, which, by annihilating the army of Francis, and leaving him\r\na prisoner, established the supremacy of Charles, and placed him in\r\na position to dictate terms. This event modified the policy of the\r\nItalian princes, and especially that of the Pope, who, naturally\r\nirresolute, knew not what part to take, unwilling to abandon his\r\navowed neutrality, yet seeing no security in standing aloof from a\r\npower so dominant as that of the Emperor. On the whole, he thought\r\nit safest to come to a provisional arrangement with Don Carlos de\r\nLannoy, Viceroy of Naples, giving him 100,000 ducats for payment of\r\nhis troops, as the price of his aid in recovering for the Church\r\nReggio and Rubbiera, which the Duke of Ferrara had seized on the\r\ndeath of Adrian VI. He at the same time named as his legate to the\r\nleading powers of Christendom, for the purpose of concluding a\r\ngeneral peace, Cardinal Giovanni Salviati, who proceeded to Madrid to\r\nattend the conferences for the liberation of Francis and the security\r\nof Italy. In consort with Castiglione, the Legate urged that an\r\nenvoy should be forthwith despatched to Rome and Venice, in order\r\nto remove those suspicions of the Emperor's design to make himself\r\nmaster of the entire Peninsula, which had arisen in consequence of\r\nthe Marquis of Pescara taking possession of the chief fortresses of\r\nthe Milanese, and besieging Francesco Sforza in his capital, on a\r\npretext of his plotting with the other princes to drive the Spaniards\r\nout of Lombardy, and to deprive them of Naples; it being obvious that\r\nonce established in these provinces, Charles would be paramount in\r\nItaly. As to the liberation of Francis, they could get nothing beyond\r\nprofessions of the utmost moderation, that matter being secretly\r\nnegotiated by the Viceroy.\r\n\r\nThe Pontiff, getting no satisfaction on these points, began to lend\r\nan ear to a proposed league of France, England, and Venice; but, when\r\non the point of subscribing it, he, to the infinite disgust of his\r\ncolleagues, postponed his signature on a rumour that the Commendatore\r\nHerrera was at Genoa, on his way to offer very acceptable proposals;\r\nat length, however, finding that these reports were but opiates\r\nto set him asleep, he was induced to join the confederation,\r\nnotwithstanding entreaties and promises of the imperial ambassador.\r\nThis league filled Charles with indignation, as he fully understood\r\nit to be directed against himself, though masked by a condition\r\nsanctioning his adherence to it. But his rage was immoderate on\r\nreceiving, through Castiglione, a papal brief, which justified the\r\nconfederacy as necessary for the safety of Italy and the Holy See,\r\nand complained generally of the measures of his ministers, specifying\r\nvarious instances wherein they had ill responded to the pacific and\r\naffectionate dispositions entertained by his Holiness towards their\r\nmaster. Stung to the quick by a despatch which laid bare the secret\r\ntricks of their paltry intrigues, they persuaded the Emperor to\r\nreturn a sharp answer, appealing to a general council whatever steps\r\nClement might have recourse to against him, which they represented as\r\nlikely to endanger his possession of Naples, and even his tenure of\r\nthe imperial crown. Castiglione, who enjoyed high personal favour,\r\nwas able by dexterous representations to extract from Charles himself\r\nthe hope of a milder reply, and meanwhile had from him authority to\r\nassure the Pontiff of his friendly intentions, and of his resolution\r\nto comport himself as a humble and liege son; and these favourable\r\ndispositions were the more readily effected, as he had received from\r\nthe wavering Pontiff a revocation of the offensive brief the very day\r\nafter it had been delivered. It was, therefore, with dismay that,\r\nwhen shown the secretary's answer, he found it in the utmost degree\r\nbitter and spiteful; and hurrying to the Emperor, he complained of\r\nthe disrespect thus shown to his Majesty's wishes in an affair of\r\nsuch moment, protesting that he neither could write to his master\r\nwhat his Majesty had already instructed him, without belying the\r\nwhole negotiation, nor could he, after such treatment, rely upon or\r\nreport those favourable dispositions which his Majesty had hitherto\r\nprofessed. Charles replied that his real intentions were conformable\r\nto his previous professions, although he had been advised by his\r\nministers to write in such terms as might justify and secure himself,\r\nin the face of such groundless imputations as had been made in the\r\nobjectionable brief; adding the most solemn abjurations, that, if\r\nhis Holiness comported himself peaceably towards all, he should\r\never continue a good and obedient son. In an autograph letter to\r\nthe Nuncio, he reiterated this explanation of his answer, with a\r\nhope that the Pope would not take offence at its contents, and an\r\nassurance that Castiglione would never be belied by him. The document\r\nwhich the diplomatist had the tact thus to obtain, is relied upon\r\nby his biographers as a satisfactory negative to the suspicions of\r\nVarchi, that he betrayed the Pontiff and the Church, during his\r\nvexatious relations with the Spanish court.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Francis having been released, on terms which he was unable\r\nas well as unwilling to execute, and his sons consequently remaining\r\nas hostages, the new League proceeded with hostilities against the\r\nImperialists in Lombardy, and took Lodi, whilst their ambassadors\r\nstill negotiated at Madrid for the Emperor's adherence to their\r\nconfederation, and for release of the French princes. This farce of\r\narmed protocolising was further complicated by various by-plots, and\r\nby endless jealousies and misunderstandings among these diplomatists,\r\nso that the Spanish ministry found no difficulty in protracting it\r\nby a succession of petty cavils, in the hope of some favourable news\r\nfrom the seat of war. Such was the state of matters when the first\r\nsack of Rome by Don Ugo da Moncada and the Colonna, in September\r\n1526, reached the imperial court, and along with it the hurried\r\ntruce imposed upon Clement. Charles, affecting great indignation,\r\nimmediately sent to the Pope Cesare Fieramosca, his master of horse,\r\nto disown the proceedings of Moncada, and to lavish professions for\r\nthe peace and welfare of Italy, the only effect of which was to\r\nlull the facile and nerveless Pontiff into a fatal security, rudely\r\ndispelled by the assault of Bourbon on the heights of the Vatican.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX V\r\n\r\n(Page 140)\r\n\r\nACCOUNT OF THE ARMADA OF THE MOST SERENE DON JOHN OF AUSTRIA, DRAWN\r\nUP AT MESSINA THE LAST OF JULY, 1571.[258]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 258: Vat.

But\r\nalthough, under the genial sun and favouring circumstances of Italy,\r\nman has in various ages advanced beyond his fellows in mental culture\r\nand social development, the science of maturing the capabilities\r\nof his position, and of marking their progression, is of modern\r\ngrowth. The duties of rulers and subjects consisted until lately in\r\ndefence of the common weal against obvious dangers: the promotion\r\nof its general prosperity, and the registration of its gradual\r\nameliorations, were no part either of scientific government, or of\r\nindividual study. Accordingly, the lights thrown upon statistics,\r\nby historians and general writers in the best days of Italian\r\nsplendour, are too few and flickering to guide us to important\r\nfacts; and, though we may familiarise ourselves with the Athenian\r\ncourt of Duke Guidobaldo I., its manners and its gossip,--though we\r\nmay recall from the ample description of many authors the stately\r\ndecorations of its palaces, the pageantry of its processions, the\r\nbrilliancy of its revels,--we are left in total ignorance of the\r\ninternal state of the country, of its resources and industry, of\r\nthe numbers and the condition of its inhabitants, of the financial\r\nposition of its government. It is not till late in the sixteenth\r\ncentury that we meet with some materials, which,--though meagre and\r\ninaccurate, and too often bearing the double impress of carelessness\r\nand contradiction,--enable us to form some tangible estimate as to\r\nthese points.[259] Here, as in most cases, recording the impartial\r\nevidence of watchful observers, the Venetian Relazione are of\r\nconsiderable value. Those of Mocenigo and Zane, ambassadors at Urbino\r\nin 1570-74, have been already drawn upon in this work, but it is\r\nchiefly from the latter that we have gathered the following notices.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 259: From a league between Count Antonio, of Urbino, and\r\nBarnabo Visconti, of Milan, in 1376 (MSS. Oliveriana, No. 374,\r\nvol. I., p. 1), we gather an isolated notice. Free import from the\r\nterritory of Urbino into Florence was stipulated for all sorts of\r\ngrain, fruit, and vegetables, the customary duties being paid upon\r\nwheat, oats, and barley.]\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the sixteenth century the revenues of the duchy\r\ndid not exceed 40,000 scudi, and by the terms of its investiture the\r\nimposts could not be raised without papal sanction. This restriction\r\nhaving been removed upon the marriage of Duke Guidobaldo II.'s\r\ndaughter to the nephew of Pius IV., that prince promptly availed\r\nhimself of his new prerogative, augmenting them gradually to about\r\ndouble that amount. The reductions consequent upon the Urbino\r\ninsurrection brought down the state revenues to about 60,000 scudi,\r\nand in 1570 Mocenigo estimates the whole income, including the\r\nallodial estates, at 100,000 scudi, adding an opinion that it was\r\ncapable of being much increased. Of the 60,000 scudi, one-sixth part\r\nwas derived from the salt, and two-sixths from licences granted for\r\nthe export of corn [_tratte_], the remaining half being drawn from\r\nsmall taxes upon the townships, to which the rural population do\r\nnot appear to have directly contributed. The corn-trade was carried\r\non coastwise from Sinigaglia, amounting in ordinary years to about\r\n150,000 _staji_ or bushels of wheat, partly smuggled from the papal\r\nterritory, which chiefly went to supply Venice and its dependencies.\r\nThe palpable inadequacy of these resources was eked out by pay and\r\nallowances drawn by the last dukes from the Venetian Republic, the\r\nChurch, or the King of Spain. The _cense_ or annual payment to the\r\nCamera Apostolica under the investiture is variously stated at from\r\n2190 to 2907 scudi, falling due on St. Peter's day.\r\n\r\nWith these Venetian Relazioni, a document of much apparent interest\r\nhas been printed in the _Archivio Storico_, under the title of\r\n\"Balance of income and expenditure in the state of Urbino.\"[260]\r\nOn nearer inspection, however, its value falls far short of its\r\npromise, for the entries are so confused, and the arithmetical\r\nsummations so incorrect, as to destroy nearly all confidence either\r\nin the details or the general results. Still it seems to have\r\nestablished a few facts throwing light upon the resources of the\r\nduchy in the last years of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 260: Series II., vol. II., p. 337, from a MS. in the\r\nSiena Library, K. iii. 58: it is dated 1579, but contains posterior\r\nentries.]\r\n\r\nThe revenues may be thus classified:--1. Those of twelve towns, five\r\nsmaller places, and the province of Montefeltro, derived from various\r\ntaxes,[261] duties on butcher-meat, salt, wine, straw, weighhouse\r\nduties on grain and other provisions, and on merchandise, passenger\r\ntoll at Pesaro, rents of houses and inns, tax on the Jews (producing\r\n953 scudi), and a variety of minor imposts varying in different\r\nplaces. The customs of Pesaro yielded 1226 sc.; those of Sinigaglia\r\n160, besides 436 for pot dues, and 6000 for grain and vegetables\r\nshipped for exportation. 2. Income from manufactures[262] in various\r\ntowns, stated at 5712 sc. 3. The salt duties, or perhaps monopoly,\r\n5407 sc. 4. Revenue from mills, payable in wheat (_grano_) at 4 sc. a\r\n_soma_, 5832 sc. 5. Value of barley and oats (_spelta_) contributed\r\nby various communities, 1020 sc. 6. Mountain rents, 610 sc. 7.\r\nDonatives paid in wine, wood, and straw, to the value of 630 sc. 8.\r\nProduce of allodial lands, in wheat, oats, barley, beans, lupines,\r\npeas, vetches, buckwheat, flour, hay, straw, hemp, lint, wine,\r\nwalnuts, wool, cheese, pigeons, and waterfowl, to the gross amount of\r\n7321 sc. The return of expenditure is too vague and confused to be\r\nof any use, but it contains provisions to the Duchess, amounting to\r\nabout 7000 sc. From these returns the Venetian estimates would appear\r\nto be understated, and a contemporary writer, whose anonymous Reports\r\nupon the Italian principalities issued from the Elzivir press, sets\r\ndown its revenues in 1610 at above 200,000 scudi, of which 8000 were\r\npaid as cess to the Camera Apostolica. The imposts were considered\r\nlight, for the soil was in many parts productive, and grain was\r\nexported largely from it and the adjoining Marca, at the port of\r\nSinigaglia. The Duke's treasure in S. Leo is reckoned at 2,000,000\r\nof scudi, a palpable error for 200,000. In 1024, the _Mercurius\r\nGallicus_ estimates the revenues of the duchy at 300,000 scudi,\r\nbesides allodial lands, and estates in Naples amounting to 50,000\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 261: The word used is _colte_, which might mean crops.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 262: _Fabbriche_ might mean only shops.]\r\n\r\nIn regard to population, the estimate of Zane is 150,000, the\r\nmajority of whom devoted themselves to agriculture and arms,\r\ncommercial industry being almost unknown. He calculates the\r\nmilitary force at 10,000 men, half of them being trained, and about\r\nthree-fourths ready for foreign service; and he dwells upon the\r\nbenefit which his Republic might derive from conciliating a state\r\nwhence such a force could on any exigency be quickly obtained,\r\nwithout the necessity of seeking free passage from any other power.\r\nThe report of 1610, which evidently verges upon exaggeration, gives\r\nthe fighting men at 20,000, nearly all infantry. In 1591, as we learn\r\nfrom an original MS.,[263] the military force of the duchy amounted\r\nto 13,313 men, of whom 8300 carried arquebuses, and 3783 wore\r\nmorions. From the same authority is taken the following tabular view\r\nof the whole population, classed under townships, and amounting in\r\n1598 to 115,121 souls.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 263: Vat. Urb.

Since the Devolution, population had increased, and the\r\nlast census of the legation, nearly corresponding with the duchy,\r\ngave 220,000 souls within an area of 180 square leagues, the city of\r\nUrbino containing 7500, besides 4500 in the adjacent district.\r\n\r\nIn 1574, few or none of the nobility drew from their estates a rental\r\nexceeding 3000 scudi, but there were many burgesses owning from 300\r\nto 400 a year. The few merchants were chiefly foreigners. Most of the\r\nsmall towns had been dismantled of their fortifications, only some\r\nfifty having them kept in repair, of which about twenty belonged to\r\nas many petty feudatories.\r\n\r\nA writer soon after the Devolution states the Duke's revenues at\r\n100,000 to 120,000 scudi, including 20,000 of Spanish subsidy, as\r\nmuch of allodial income, and 30,000 from escheats, penalties, and the\r\nport duties of Sinigaglia, whence a great grain trade was carried on\r\nby the Venetians out of the Marca.[265] Some years after the duchy\r\nhad lost its independence, although this export was then prohibited\r\nby Urban VIII., and notwithstanding the loss of the allodial estates,\r\nthe Camera drew above 100,000 scudi from direct and fiscal taxation.\r\nThe militia at that time numbered 8000 infantry and 500 cavalry,\r\nbesides the garrison of Sinigaglia. The _fattorie_, or allodial\r\nfarms, yielded to the Duke 14,000 scudi when leased, but afterwards,\r\nwhen administered on his account, they produced 18,000: the income\r\nfrom mills was about 6000; that of S. Leo 10,000, of which above 6000\r\nwere spent in maintaining the place.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 265: Vat. Ottob. MSS., No. 3135, f. 279.]\r\n\r\nSome idea may be formed of the provisions for administering justice\r\nfrom a narrative compiled after the Devolution, but which expressly\r\nstates the arrangements for this purpose to be the same as adopted\r\nby the Dukes.[266] The judges were entitled vicars or captains,\r\npodestàs, commissaries, and lieutenants, and were removable at\r\npleasure. The vicars or captains resided in certain small towns,\r\nand were notaries, who acted as judges and clerks within their\r\nassigned bounds. Their jurisdiction extended to all cases of injury\r\nor quarrel, which they were bound to decide according to the\r\nrespective municipal statutes, or, in absence of such, according\r\nto those of Urbino. In civil causes they were limited to a certain\r\namount; above which, recourse was had to the judge of the chief\r\ndistrict town. They had no proper criminal jurisdiction, but were\r\nbound to report all accidents to the sovereign, who frequently\r\nremitted to them to examine into slight delicts; those inferring\r\ncorporal punishment being sent to a doctor, under whom the vicar\r\nacted as clerk. The podestàs were judges-ordinary in all civil and\r\ncriminal cases within their bounds: and where there was no resident\r\ncommissary or lieutenant, the public administration and police were\r\nintrusted to them; to each of them there was assigned one clerk for\r\ncriminal cases, called _maleficj_, and named by the Duke, and two for\r\ncivil causes chosen by the community. The system of appeal from one\r\nof these courts to another, being founded upon local reasons, was\r\ncomplicated, and need not be detailed. The court of final resort in\r\ncivil matters was the Collegiate Rota of Urbino, over which thirteen\r\njudges presided, five of whom were necessarily ecclesiastics. They\r\nheld office for life, and vacancies were filled up by the sovereign\r\nfrom a leet of three voted by the remaining number. They sat twice\r\na week, five being a quorum; and they had also the review of\r\necclesiastical causes, in which, however, the lay members had only a\r\nconsultive voice. In certain suits their decision might be brought\r\nunder review of the sovereign.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 266: _Ibid._, f. 277, 321.]\r\n\r\nThere were likewise three auditors, who had no ordinary jurisdiction,\r\nbut sat daily in presence of the sovereign as an executive council,\r\nto whom all criminal matters were reported by the magistracy. Their\r\nsalaries after the Devolution were 400 scudi a year. They were also\r\nbound to take cognisance of all fiscal affairs, and of all complaints\r\nbrought before them, and they were charged with the interests of\r\nwidows and orphans, and generally with all matters voluntarily\r\nbrought before them by consent of parties. After the Devolution,\r\ntheir salaries were 400 scudi a year; that of the fiscal advocate,\r\n384; and of the secretary of justice, 320. The income of the judges,\r\nwhom we have already mentioned as located in the towns and villages,\r\nvaried from half a scudo yearly to 240 scudi, the latter being the\r\npay of the Captain of Urbino. The lower class of these officers were\r\nall notaries, but, after allowing for professional gains and fees,\r\nsuch remuneration was disgracefully small, especially as it was paid\r\nin the ducal money, which had become depreciated to two-thirds of the\r\ncurrency value in the papal states. The pay of the legate was 1400\r\nscudi, that of the vice-legate 600, besides about 1200 of fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX IX\r\n\r\n(Page 391 note *1)\r\n\r\nTWO SONNETS BY PIETRO ARETINO ON TITIAN'S PORTRAITS OF DUKE FRANCESCO\r\nMARIA I.

DUKE OF URBINO, BY CERTAIN MAJOLICA-MAKERS\r\nIN PESARO\r\n\r\n\r\nMost illustrious and most excellent Lord Duke,\r\n\r\nTo your most illustrious Lordship have recourse these devoted\r\npetitioners, Mo. Bernardin Gagliardino and Co., Mo. Girolamo\r\nLanfranchi, Mo. Rinaldo and Co., all makers of vases and bottles,\r\ncitizens and inhabitants of Pesaro; Mo. Piermateo, and Mo. Bartolomeo\r\nPignattari, citizens and indwellers of Pesaro; and all the others who\r\ninhabit the county of Pesaro;--setting forth how they find themselves\r\ncontinually, from year's end to year's end, subject to all sorts\r\nof burdens and imposts, exacted on real and personal property, and\r\npaying it with the sweat of their labour. They greatly complain\r\nhow it seems to them wrong that strangers of their craft come into\r\nthis city and district with similar productions, to take bread out\r\nof their hand, at all seasons of the year, a thing not allowed to\r\nthemselves in other countries. For which causes they propose to your\r\nmost illustrious Lordship the following articles for your signature.\r\n\r\nFirst, that your Lordship would concede to them that no one, stranger\r\nor townsman, shall, on any pretext, sell, or export for sale from the\r\ncity and district, earthen vases of whatever sort, excepting covered\r\npans and oil-pitchers, or other vessels exceeding the size of a\r\n_medrio_; declaring always that, at the fair, all may sell any kind\r\nof vases, but at no intermediate time, on pain of forfeiture, and a\r\npenalty of ten lire of Bologna for each offence, one-half to your\r\nillustrious Lordship's chamberlain, one-fourth to the informer, and\r\nthe rest to the party enforcing it; always excepting figured vases\r\nof Urbino, and white ones from Urbino and Faenza.\r\n\r\nIt is farther desired that no inhabitant, not engaged in this art in\r\nthe city or district, be permitted to purchase foreign productions\r\nfor resale, except those imported during the fair; always under the\r\nlike penalties on contravention hereof.\r\n\r\nAnd, in order to satisfy your Lordship that no inconvenience may\r\narise to the city from this, they bind themselves henceforward to see\r\nthat it be constantly supplied with such vases as are required, and\r\nusually made therein, and especially with figured vases of beautiful\r\nand stately character, and this for the customary prices, these being\r\nin nowise altered; and, in case of their departing from this, your\r\nExcellency shall be free to cancel these articles....\r\n\r\nConfirmed and enjoined as asked, but during our pleasure.\r\n\r\nPesaro, 27th April, 1552.\r\n\r\n_Passeri_, p. 34.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XI\r\n\r\n(Page 411)\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM THE ARCHBISHOP OF URBINO TO CARDINAL GIULIO DELLA ROVERE,\r\nREGARDING A SERVICE OF MAJOLICA\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the most illustrious and most reverend Lord, my singular Lord and\r\npatron, the Lord Cardinal of Urbino in Ravenna.\r\n\r\nMost illustrious and most reverend Lord, my singular Lord and patron,\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Urbino, I ordered of Mo. Horatio [Fontana], _vasaro_,\r\nthe service [_credenza_] commissioned by your most affectionate and\r\nmost reverend Lordship, for the most illustrious Monsignore Farnese.\r\nAnd, as there will be so many vases done with grotesques, in addition\r\nto the white ones (as per inclosed list), I could not manage it for\r\nless than thirty-six scudi, which, if I am not mistaken as to what he\r\ngets from others, is very good treatment. All the white pieces will\r\nhave on the reverse the arms of Farnese in small, and I feel certain\r\nthat the service will give satisfaction. He promises to deliver it\r\nfinished in little more than a month, and, as an inducement to serve\r\nyou well, as I trust he will do, I have, at his request, advanced\r\nhim some money. If your illustrious Lordship please, let M. Ludovico\r\nPerucchi be written to, that he may pay the above-mentioned sum on\r\naccount of this. As soon as finished, I shall get Horatio to pack it\r\nwell, in order to go safely, and shall despatch it to Rome in such\r\nway as you shall direct. And, having no more to say, I remain humbly\r\nkissing your hands, and commending you to our Lord God, that, in his\r\nfavour, he ever give you all your desires. From Urbino, the 2nd of\r\nMarch, 1567.\r\n\r\nYour most illustrious and most reverend Lordship's most humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nYOUR ARCHBISHOP.\r\n\r\n\r\n_List of white pieces with arms on the reverse._\r\n\r\n  1 large cistern.\r\n  1 large bason, and 1 bottle.\r\n  1 barber's bason, and small brush.\r\n  6 great, and 12 middling dishes.\r\n  6 large and 6 middling comfit dishes.\r\n  2 vases for vinegar and oil, 4 salts.\r\n  36 dishes, 50 smaller ditto.\r\n  50 plates, 24 ditto [_piadene_].\r\n\r\n\r\n_With Grotesques._\r\n\r\n  1 large cistern.\r\n  1 bason and bottle.\r\n  4 cups on raised stands.\r\n  1 barber's bason and brush.\r\n  2 salts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XII\r\n\r\nCOLLECTIONS OF ART MADE BY THE DUKES OF URBINO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extent and value of the works of arts amassed by a series of\r\nsovereigns, who, during nearly two centuries, were continuously\r\npatrons of arts in its best days, cannot be uninteresting topics of\r\ninquiry, and fall within the scope of these volumes, as an important\r\ntest of the knowledge and taste of the collectors. The beautiful\r\nobjects which Castiglione and others include among the attractions of\r\nthe palace at Urbino have thus acquired an almost classic importance,\r\nand to identify them with those now familiar to the travelled amateur\r\nwere a pleasing result. Much more would it be so could we realise an\r\ningenious theory put forward in the _Quarterly Review_,[267] that, by\r\nascertaining what were the pictures first offered to the enthusiastic\r\ngaze of the youthful Raffaele, we might even now trace those early\r\nimpressions of beauty which, reproduced by his fine genius and taste,\r\nhave been unanimously adopted as standards of pictorial perfection.\r\nThis gratifying hope is, however, delusive. To the ravages of two\r\ninvasions, succeeded, in both instances, by military usurpation, may\r\nperhaps be imputed the disappearance of almost every picture which\r\ncould have existed in the palace previously to 1521, for very few\r\nsuch were found there on the extinction of the ducal house in 1631.\r\nIn order to throw every possible light upon this matter, I have\r\nspared no researches at Urbino, Pesaro, and Florence, and, from a\r\nvariety of inventories, I have collected the facts which are now to\r\nbe stated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 267: Vol. LXVI., pp. 3-10.]\r\n\r\nThe principal sources of this information have been, _First_, a\r\nlist of \"good pictures,\" brought to Florence, in 1631, from the\r\nwardrobe of Urbino. It is in the archives of the Gallery degli\r\nUffizi, at Florence, in the autograph of Pelli, and is obviously the\r\ndocument frequently referred to by him in his Galleria di Firenze.\r\n_Second_, a note of the objects of art in the Urbino inheritance, as\r\ninventoried by Bastiano Venturi in 1654. This is in a folio volume of\r\ninventories, preserved in the wardrobe archives of the Pitti Palace,\r\nand includes the succession of Duchess Livia, as well as that of her\r\nhusband, the last Duke of Urbino. _Third_, selections from a full\r\ninventory of the wardrobe of Urbino, dated in 1623, and now No. 386\r\nof the MSS. in the Oliveriana Library at Pesaro. Of these documents,\r\nthe first is, unquestionably, of most importance as to the identity\r\nand value of the objects enumerated; and the last, having been\r\ncompiled by a person unacquainted with art, cannot be much depended\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nWe may, however, estimate the extent of the collections in the\r\ndifferent palaces of Francesco Maria II. from the Venturi inventory,\r\nand from another dated in 1623, which is No. 460 of the Oliveriana\r\nMSS. In the latter there are enumerated as at Pesaro (besides a\r\nseries of sixty-two portraits in the gallery, sixty-nine maps,\r\nand a hundred and thirty-five plans of cities) eight hundred and\r\nforty-three pictures. This large amount includes apparently all\r\nthe framed engravings, embroideries, and miniatures; and a great\r\nproportion were portraits of the ducal family and their connections.\r\nThe small number which have the painters' names assigned to them\r\nrenders this, the fullest list, of little interest. In the same\r\npalace are mentioned sixty-four pieces in marble, chiefly busts;\r\nand in various other palaces and chapels were some other pictures,\r\nseemingly of minor importance. The Venturi catalogue enumerates only\r\nninety pictures, seventy miniatures in oil, eleven embroideries,\r\ntwenty-nine tapestries, eighty bronzes, enamels, and carvings, and\r\nfifty-one works in marble and stone. These seem to have been the\r\nprincipal objects reserved out of the inheritance, the remainder\r\nhaving probably been given away or sold at Pesaro and Florence. This\r\nselection bears evidence of care and connoisseurship; but that of\r\nPelli having the best pretensions to these qualities, the pictures\r\nit names are fully given in the first of the lists here subjoined,\r\nending with No. 50. In the two subsequent ones, from Nos. 51 to\r\n95, are included all other Urbino pictures of any moment which I\r\nhave been able to glean from the inventories now described, and from\r\nother sources. To each picture is added such information regarding\r\nits identity as extended inquiry and observation have enabled me\r\nto hazard. Imperfect as it is, it will interest those who visit\r\nFlorence, and may save them from very troublesome and often fruitless\r\ninquiries, which occupied me for many weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. PELLI'S LIST OF THE URBINO PICTURES.\r\n\r\nRAFFAELE.\r\n\r\n1. MADONNA, CHRIST, AND ST. JOHN BAPTIST, on panel. Pelli\r\nin a marginal note states this to be the _Madonna della Seggiola_,\r\nalthough he admits that a different extraction is by some assigned\r\nto that masterpiece. No picture thus described appears in the Pesaro\r\ninventories; that of Venturi mentions one such, but calls it a copy\r\nafter Raffaele. The Madonna della Seggiola, now No. 151 of the Pitti\r\nGallery, is said by Passavant to have been in an inventory of the\r\nTribune, dated 1585, of course long antecedent to the Devolution of\r\nUrbino.\r\n\r\n2. MADONNA, CHRIST, ST. JOHN BAPTIST, AND ANOTHER FIGURE, on\r\npanel, large. In the Pesaro inventory, the Christ is said to be in\r\narms; in the Venturi, two pictures are noted of the Madonna, Christ,\r\nSt. John Baptist, and St. Elizabeth, but both are called copies\r\nof Raffaele. No work now in the Florence galleries answers this\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n3. HIS OWN PORTRAIT on panel. It is described but not named\r\nby Venturi, and unquestionably is the small picture now among the\r\nportraits of painters in the Uffizi, No. 288. (See above, vol. II.,\r\np. 223.)\r\n\r\n4, 5. JULIUS II., on panel, and THE SAME on paper.\r\nOf this famous portrait several repetitions contest the palm of\r\noriginality. The two best probably are those in the Pitti, No. 79,\r\nand in the Tribune, both on panel; the former, perhaps, has the\r\nadvantage in breadth and mellow colouring, and I have heard the\r\nlatter ascribed by Italian connoisseurs to a Venetian pencil.[*268]\r\nConsidering the relationship and intimacy of the Pope with the Dukes\r\nof both dynasties, there can be little doubt that they possessed an\r\noriginal likeness, as well as the original cartoon mentioned above.\r\nThe latter has passed into the Corsini Gallery, at Florence, and is\r\nadmirable in bold character as well as in preservation. The pricked\r\noutlines attest its having been used more than once; and the first\r\npainting from it is understood to have been presented by his Holiness\r\nto the Church of the Madonna del Popolo, at Rome, a fane greatly\r\nfavoured by the della Rovere. The Pesaro list includes the cartoon,\r\nand Venturi the panel portrait, which, according to the annotator of\r\nthe last edition of Vasari (Florence, 1838), was that in the Tribune,\r\nthe head alone of the Pitti one being, in his opinion, by Raffaele,\r\nthe rest by Giulio Romano. Passavant, however, adjudges the palm\r\nof merit and originality to its rival in the Pitti collection, and\r\nconsiders it the Urbino picture.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *268: The Pitti portrait is an inferior replica of that in\r\nthe Tribune of the Uffizi.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTITIAN.\r\n\r\n6, 7. DUKE FRANCESCO MARIA I., and his DUCHESS\r\nLEONORA, on canvas. These are justly considered among the\r\nchoicest portraits of this master, but are painted in very different\r\nstyles, the Duke being treated with extraordinary freedom, the\r\nDuchess in a severe and somewhat hard manner, suited to her stiff\r\nmatronly air. They ornament the Venetian room at the Uffizi, Nos.\r\n605 and 599, and the former supplies a frontispiece to this volume.\r\nAnother portrait of him from the same hand is mentioned in Pelli's\r\nnote. (See above, pp. 48, 58, 371-3.)\r\n\r\n8. DUKE GUIDOBALDO [II.] Of this portrait I find no trace,\r\nthough it is named in the Pesaro list, and may be that described by\r\nVenturi as in an antique dress.[*269]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *269: Gronau thinks this portrait may be the so-called\r\n\"Young Englishman\" of the Pitti Gallery (No. 92). Cf. GRONAU, _op.\r\ncit._]\r\n\r\n9. HANNIBAL OF CARTHAGE, on canvas. Mentioned in the Pesaro\r\ninventory, but not now known.\r\n\r\n10. MADONNA, CHILD, ST. JOHN BAPTIST, AND ST. ANNA, on\r\npanel, large. No trace of this picture appears in any inventory, or\r\nFlorentine gallery.\r\n\r\n11. THE NATIVITY, on panel. Not mentioned elsewhere; it or\r\nthe following may be the picture painted with a moonlight effect, now\r\nNo. 443, of the Pitti Gallery; or that described by Venturi as \"a\r\nwoman swaddling an infant.\"[*270]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *270: This picture is not by Titian, but by Marco Vecellio.]\r\n\r\n12. QUEM GENUIT ADORAVIT, on panel; or the Madonna adoring\r\nher Child. This I have nowhere been able to identify. (See the\r\npreceding No., and also below, No. 20.)\r\n\r\n13. MADONNA DELLA MISERICORDIA, on canvas. The Pesaro\r\nlist tells us it came from the Imperiale villa, and contained the\r\npainter's portrait, with many figures. It is No. 484 of the Pitti\r\ncollection, where it is assigned to Marco di Tiziano, the cousin and\r\nfavourite pupil of Titian. Following the usual type, this \"Madonna of\r\nMercy\" is represented as a gigantic female, whose outstretched arms\r\ninfold under her ample mantle of compassion, six men, five women, and\r\ntwo children; the eldest of the group is evidently Titian, and the\r\nrest are, no doubt, members of the Vecelli family. The picture was\r\nprobably votive, in commemoration of some signal mercy vouchsafed to\r\nhis house.\r\n\r\n14. THE SAVIOUR, on panel. A half-length figure in profile,\r\nperhaps the finished study for some large composition. It is noted in\r\nall the inventories, and was carried by the French to Paris, but is\r\nnow in the Pitti Palace, No. 228.\r\n\r\n15. ECCE HOMO, on panel. Also included in all the\r\ninventories, and probably the picture No. 330 of the Pitti Gallery,\r\nwhere it is called in the manner of Sebastian del Piombo.[*271]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *271: This picture no longer hangs in the Pitti Gallery.]\r\n\r\n16. MAGDALEN, on panel. This is now No. 67 in the Pitti\r\ncollection; a half-length, half-nude penitent, with variations from\r\nthe frequent repetitions of the same subject by this master; her eye,\r\nno longer tearful, is upraised with an expression of joyful hope: the\r\npenitent is at peace. (See above, p. 375.)\r\n\r\n17. JUDITH, on canvas. In the Pesaro inventory it is\r\ndescribed as on panel, and both there and in Pelli's note it is\r\nascribed to Titian _or_ Palma Vecchio, whilst Venturi assigns it to\r\nPordenone. It is now in the Venetian room of the Uffizi, with the\r\nname of Pordenone, and is on panel.[*272]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *272: No. 619, Uffizi, I suppose. It is by Palma Vecchio.]\r\n\r\n18. NAKED WOMAN LYING, large, life-size, on canvas. All\r\nwho have visited the Tribune of the Uffizi Gallery are acquainted\r\nwith two companion full-length pictures of nude females, which are\r\nconspicuous among its treasures of art. Both are called Venus; but\r\nthough one has the unquestionable accompaniment of a Cupid, with a\r\nlandscape behind, the other contains no attribute of the amorous\r\ngoddess, but is the portrait of a lovely woman laid uncovered on\r\nher bed, whilst two attendants in the back part of the room prepare\r\nher dress. To the latter, therefore, the above description, which\r\nis alike in all the Urbino inventories, must unquestionably apply;\r\nand it thus affords us an easy solution of the doubts as to which\r\nof the two pictures came from Urbino, originating in the confused\r\nand incorrect descriptions of Ridolfi and Vasari. The popular idea\r\nis that Titian here portrayed a mistress or favourite of Duke\r\nGuidobaldo of Urbino; but Cigognara has adopted the conjecture that\r\nin her features may be traced an idealised likeness of his mother\r\nLeonora. We must reject an idea so outraging her well-known modesty\r\nof demeanour; and upon comparing the sweetly sensual countenance of\r\nthe naked beauty with the almost stern dignity of that Duchess, as\r\nrepresented in her portrait, No. 7 of this catalogue, the resemblance\r\nseems limited to an oval face and auburn complexion. The spaniels\r\nwhich attend on both ladies, introduced in these pictures, though of\r\nthe same breed, are certainly different animals. Greater probability\r\nattaches to a notion that the nude female's features agree with those\r\nof the Bella and the Flora of Titian, described in the next number of\r\nthis list; and as both of these came from Urbino, we may conjecture\r\nthat all three were painted from some noted beauty of that court.\r\nAnother supposition, has, however, been adopted by Mrs. Jameson, that\r\nthe original was Violante Palma, Titian's first love, and a favourite\r\nmodel in his school. The Tribune picture is generally admitted to be\r\nthe finest of Titian's so-called Venuses, and has been even assigned\r\nthe same place among paintings as the Medicean Venus holds in\r\nsculpture. (See above, p. 374).\r\n\r\n19. ANOTHER PORTRAIT OF THE SAME NAKED WOMAN, BUT DRESSED,\r\nmore than half-length. This is considered to be the attractive\r\npicture so universally admired under the name of Titian's\r\nBELLA, of the Pitti collection, in which gorgeous costume\r\nand rich beauty seem carried to the utmost point. It does not appear\r\nin the other Urbino inventories, but in that of Venturi we find a\r\nSEASON on canvas by Titian, which I apprehend to be the\r\nfamed FLORA, now an ornament of the Venetian room at the\r\nUffizi, and stated in the Reale Galleria di Firenze (edition 1817) to\r\nhave come from Urbino, and to be a half-length, half-nude, portrait\r\nof the same model who sat for No. 18 of this catalogue. The title of\r\nQueen Cornara of Cyprus sometimes given to the Bella is palpably one\r\nof those misnomers so unpardonably common in picture galleries.\r\n\r\n20. MADONNA, CHILD, AND TWO ANGELS, Baroccio after Titian.\r\nOf this picture an original by Titian on panel is in Venturi's\r\nlist, as well as a copy of it on canvas. I have not been able to\r\nfind either; but the original may be that entered at No. 12 of this\r\ncatalogue.\r\n\r\n21. MADONNA, ST. JOHN, AND ST. ELIZABETH, large, on panel, a\r\nfine copy. I have not succeeded in tracing the work.\r\n\r\n\r\nGIORGIONE.\r\n\r\n22. PORTRAIT of an armed soldier, supposed to be\r\nUGUCCIONE DELLA FAGGIOLA. Not traced.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN DEL PIOMBO.\r\n\r\n23. ST. AGATHA, large, on panel. It appears in all the\r\ninventories, and was one of the most important pictures in the Urbino\r\nsuccession. Representing the horrible dismemberment of the martyred\r\nsaint, the subject is most revolting, but in energy of treatment\r\nand power of colouring, it ranks among the chef-d'oeuvres of the\r\nmaster, whose name it bears, with the date, Rome 1520. It now adorns\r\nthe Pitti Palace, No. 179, after having visited Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALMA VECCHIO.\r\n\r\n24. THE SAVIOUR, on canvas. Not found.\r\n\r\n25. THE MADONNA, large on canvas. Not found.\r\n\r\n26. ST. FRANCIS, large, on canvas; not found. None of these\r\nthree pictures appear in the other lists.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BASSANI.\r\n\r\n27. A SUPPER. This was, doubtless, the Cenacolo, No. 446 in\r\nthe Pitti Gallery, assigned to Leandro Bassano.\r\n\r\n28, 29. THE BUILDING AND ENTERING OF THE ARK. These are,\r\nprobably, the companion pictures in the corridor of the Uffizi,\r\nwhich seem poor copies, though ascribed to Francesco. Of the latter,\r\nrepresenting the Deluge, there is on the same wall a large and fine\r\nreplica with his name, and a picture of animals entering the ark with\r\nthe name of Jacopo.\r\n\r\n30. COMPOSITION OF FIGURES AND ANIMALS. It is stated by the\r\nPesaro list to have come from the chapel in the lower gardens of\r\nthat city, and may have been the large picture of the Rich Man and\r\nLazarus, now in the corridor of the Uffizi, where it bears the name\r\nof Francesco.\r\n\r\n31-34. FOUR PICTURES. As there are fourteen pictures of the\r\nBassani in the Uffizi, and five in the Pitti, besides those noticed\r\nabove, and several portraits, it would be idle to attempt identifying\r\nthese four. All these eight works of this family are noted in the\r\nPesaro list, but omitted in Venturi's.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAROCCIO.\r\n\r\n35. PORTRAIT OF S.A.S. This is probably to be read SUA\r\nALTEZZA SERENISSIMA FRANCESCO MARIA II., the last Duke of\r\nUrbino, now an ornament of the Tribune. It is a half-length on\r\ncanvas, in armour richly inlaid in steel and gold, his helmet by\r\nhis side and a scarf across his shoulder, being, as we learn from\r\nthe Pesaro list, the uniform in which he returned from his naval\r\nexpedition; a circumstance which fixes the date in 1572, when the\r\nDuke was in his twenty-third, and the painter in his forty-fourth,\r\nyear. Nothing can surpass the fluid harmony and pellucid colouring\r\nof this picture, equally remarkable for breadth and high finish, but\r\nthe feeble design apparent in the arms renders it impossible to give\r\nby the burin a favourable impression of its merit. I have therefore\r\npreferred engraving for this work a much less brilliant portrait\r\nobtained by me at Pesaro. A repetition of the Tribune picture, less\r\nclear but still more charming, graces the select gallery of Baron\r\nCamuccini at Rome.\r\n\r\n36. VISITATION OF THE MADONNA, on canvas, painted, according\r\nto the Pesaro inventory, for the chapel there, on the visit of Pope\r\nClement VIII. in 1598. It has disappeared.\r\n\r\n37. MAGDALEN, on canvas. There are two pictures of this\r\nsubject, and another in the Venturi list, one on panel, one on\r\ncanvas, the latter of which is described as \"the Magdalen in the\r\nWilderness.\" I have not found either of them; but a Magdalen in\r\ndevotion with Christ, upon canvas, is noted in the Pesaro inventory,\r\nand may probably be the large and fine picture now in the Sala di\r\nBaroccio at the Uffizi, known as _Noli me tangere_, in which the\r\nSaviour appears to the Magdalen after His resurrection.\r\n\r\n38. MADONNA, ST. FRANCIS, AND ST. UBALDO, on canvas,\r\nunfinished. No doubt one of the votive pictures commissioned on the\r\nbirth of Prince Federigo. (See above.) It has disappeared.\r\n\r\n39. PORTRAIT OF MAESTRO PROSPERO, a Franciscan monk,\r\nhalf-length, on canvas; called by Venturi a Minim Observantine friar.\r\nNot identified.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ZUCCARI.\r\n\r\n40. PORTRAIT OF DUKE GUIDOBALDI [II.] IN ARMOUR, HIS HAND UPON A\r\nDOG'S HEAD. In the Pesaro inventory it is said to be on panel;\r\nin that of Venturi it is ascribed to Baroccio. It has disappeared,\r\nbut a bad copy is preserved in the Albani Palace at Urbino.\r\n\r\n41. ST. PETER IN PRISON, large. This picture is engraved at\r\nNo. 373 of the folio work on the Pitti Gallery, and is said by Vasari\r\nto have been painted for Duke Guidobaldo II., by Federigo Zuccaro\r\nwhen about twenty-three years of age. It ranks among his best works;\r\nfor though the idea is borrowed from Raffaele's fresco, the treatment\r\nand the effect of chiaroscuro are original and good. The heavy grated\r\nwindow and the monotonous colouring are however injurious to the work.\r\n\r\n42. HEAD OF ST. FRANCIS, on canvas. Lost, unless it be\r\nthe Vision of the Saint in a wide landscape, on panel, No. 482 of\r\nthe Pitti Gallery, where it is called anonymous. The Pesaro list\r\ndescribes him as in a landscape, by Federigo Zuccaro.\r\n\r\n43. CALUMNY, large, by Federigo, unnoticed in the other\r\ninventories, and undiscovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nMASCHERINO.\r\n\r\n44. CHRIST WITH NICODEMUS, NICOLAS, AND TWO ANGELS, on\r\ncanvas. Of this I can ascertain nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nANONYMOUS.\r\n\r\n45. POPE SIXTUS IV., on panel. The Venturi inventory notes a\r\nsimilar anonymous portrait, by Baroccio, and one on panel of a Pope\r\nby Titian. This and the following number may be the portraits quoted\r\nas Titian's by Vasari.\r\n\r\n46. POPE PAUL III., on panel. Perhaps No. 297 in the Pitti\r\nPalace, where it is ascribed to Paris Bordone, and of which I have\r\nseen several good repetitions. The Venturi inventory contains another\r\npanel portrait of an anonymous pope by Titian.\r\n\r\n47. DUKE FRANCESCO MARIA I. IN ARMOUR, on canvas. Perhaps a\r\ncopy of No. 6, above.\r\n\r\n48. DUKE GUIDOBALDO, on panel; unknown. Possibly the\r\noriginal of the likeness engraved for this work of Guidobaldo II.\r\n\r\n49. A LADY IN A DARK ANTIQUE DRESS, WITH A SHELL IN HER\r\nHAND, on canvas. Of this nothing is known.\r\n\r\n50. MAGDALEN NEARLY NAKED, on canvas, described in the\r\nPesaro list as reading a book. Not found.\r\n\r\nHaving now gone through Pelli's note of selected pictures, we shall\r\ncomplete our materials for estimating the Urbino collections, by\r\nadding such other works as are mentioned in the Venturi and Pesaro\r\ninventories.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. VENTURI INVENTORY.\r\n\r\nRAFFAELE.\r\n\r\n51. THE DUKE OF URBINO, A PROFILE IN HALF-ARMOUR, on canvas.\r\nThis was probably the portrait mentioned by Bembo in a letter,\r\nwherein he speaks of it as a much less successful likeness than that\r\nof the poet Tibaldeo.\r\n\r\n52. MARRIAGE OF THE MADONNA, a copy on canvas, no doubt\r\nfrom the fine picture now in the Brera at Milan, which was painted\r\nfor the church of S. Francesco, at Città di Castello.\r\n\r\n53. LUCREZIA, copy on panel. Of this neither the original\r\nnor the copy are known.\r\n\r\n\r\nTITIAN.\r\n\r\n54. MADONNA, CHRIST, ST. JOSEPH, AND ST. ELIZABETH, on\r\npanel. Not identified.\r\n\r\n55. MADONNA, CHRIST, AND ST. JOHN BAPTIST, on panel. Not\r\nidentified.\r\n\r\n56. PORTRAIT OF A FOREIGN LADY, small, on panel. Not found.\r\n\r\n57. PORTRAIT OF A MAN IN AN ANTIQUE DRESS, on panel. Not\r\nidentified.\r\n\r\n58. A MAN ARMED WITH A MORION AND SHIELD, on canvas, _after_\r\nTitian. Not identified.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAROCCIO.\r\n\r\n59. MADONNA WITH CHRIST IN HER ARMS, ST. AUGUSTIN, AND ST.\r\nFRANCIS, on canvas. Not found.\r\n\r\n60. CHRIST IN A CRADLE, MADONNA, ST. JOHN, AND ST.\r\nELIZABETH, on canvas. Not found.\r\n\r\n61. ST. FRANCIS, on panel. Not found.\r\n\r\n62. A MAN WITH A CHEMISETTE, on canvas; probably the\r\nhalf-length of Duke Francesco Maria II., with six gold buttons,\r\nmentioned in the Pesaro inventory, and of which No. 162 of the Pitti\r\ncollection seems a finished head study on paper.\r\n\r\n63. MARCHESE IPPOLITO DELLA ROVERE, on canvas. Not found.\r\n\r\n64. MONSIGNORE GIULIANO DELLA ROVERE, on canvas. Not found.\r\n\r\n65. THE SAVIOUR WITH THE GLOBE IN HIS HAND, _after_\r\nBaroccio. Now No. 101 in the Pitti Palace, where it is called _by_\r\nBaroccio. A poor picture.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\n\r\n66. A WOMAN IN AN ANTIQUE DRESS, on panel. This may refer to\r\nANTONELLO DI MESSINA. Not found.\r\n\r\n67. PETRARCH AND LAURA painted bookwise. This is doubtless a\r\nblundering description of the heads of DUKE FEDERIGO and DUCHESS\r\nBATTISTA of Urbino, by PIETRO DELLA FRANCESCA, placed like a diptych\r\nor book in the same frame. They have been engraved at Volume I., p.\r\n120, of this work, from the originals among the miscellaneous Italian\r\npictures in the Uffizi.\r\n\r\n68. A FRANCISCAN FRIAR TEACHING MATHEMATICS TO ANOTHER\r\nPERSON, on panel. This is ascribed to Ghirlandajo or Signorelli,\r\nbut the subject makes it more probably a work of PIETRO DELLA\r\nFRANCESCA, court painter to Duke Federigo. I have found no such\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n\r\nGIORGIONE.\r\n\r\n69. A DUKE OF URBINO, on canvas. Probably Guidobaldo I., but\r\nunfortunately lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLBEIN.\r\n\r\n70.

VIRTUE EXPELLING THE VICES. Not found.\r\n\r\n80-88. Six DUKES OF URBINO and three POPES; all\r\nsmall pictures on canvas.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. PESARO INVENTORY\r\n\r\nRAFFAELE.\r\n\r\n89.

A group treated with great breadth,\r\nand coloured with much delicacy.\r\n\r\nThe following pictures, in the Pitti palace, though not in the Urbino\r\ninventories, are closely connected with the family della Rovere, and\r\nthe first of them must have come from thence.\r\n\r\n96. PRINCE FEDERIGO, by BAROCCIO, on canvas, No.\r\n55. The babe lies in his cradle swaddled, his dress and coverlet\r\nembroidered in flowers and gold; inscription above, FEDERIGO PRIÑ\r\nD'URB'O QUANDO NACQUE 1605.\r\n\r\n97. VITTORIA DELLA ROVERE GRAND DUCHESS OF TUSCANY, by\r\nSUSTERMANS, on canvas, No. 116. She is in the character\r\nof the Vestal Tuccia, with a sieve under her arm, full of water; a\r\nhalf-length figure, stout and comely, with a pleasant expression.\r\n\r\n98. THE GRAND DUCHESS VITTORIA, HER HUSBAND, AND HER SON COSMO III.,\r\nby SUSTERMANS, on canvas, No. 231. This picture is called in the\r\ncatalogue a Holy Family; but though the grouping of the figures\r\nappears borrowed from some such composition, there seems no real\r\nground for this alleged impiety. They are half-lengths; the Grand\r\nDuchess has a darker complexion, and is somewhat older than in the\r\npreceding number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDENNISTOUN'S LIST\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES FOR THE WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following List, though by no means containing all the books which\r\nhave been looked into or consulted (especially numerous periodicals),\r\nwill afford a general idea of the authorities upon which this work\r\nhas been founded. The MSS. specially noted are, however, but a small\r\nportion of what has been examined, in a variety of Archives, and in\r\nthe Vatican, Minerva, Angelica, Gerusalemme, S. Lorenzo in Lucina,\r\nand Albani libraries at Rome; in those of the Borbonica and S. Angelo\r\nin Nilo at Naples; in the Laurentiana, Magliabechiana, Riccardiana,\r\nMaruccelli, and Pitti at Florence; in those of the University and S.\r\nSalvadore at Bologna; and in the public libraries of Pesaro, Perugia,\r\nRimini, Cesena, Siena, Volterra, and Monte Cassini. In the Oliveriana\r\nat Pesaro alone, upwards of one hundred MS. volumes yielded notices\r\nof interest. The MSS. in the British Museum have also been freely\r\nconsulted, and not without fruit.\r\n\r\n  Affò, Vita di M.

Indeed, some of his\r\nEastern romances are written with biblical candour. \"I have sought\r\ntruth strenuously,\" he tells us, \"I have met her boldly. I have never\r\nturned from her even when she wore an unexpected aspect.\" Still, it\r\nis believed that the day has come for giving English versions of all\r\nhis imaginative works, and of his monumental study JOAN OF ARC, which\r\nis undoubtedly the most discussed book in the world of letters to-day.\r\n\r\n¶ MR. JOHN LANE has pleasure in announcing that he will commence\r\npublication of the works of M. ANATOLE FRANCE in English, under\r\nthe general editorship of MR. FREDERIC CHAPMAN, with the following\r\nvolumes:\r\n\r\n  THE RED LILY\r\n  MOTHER OF PEARL\r\n  THE GARDEN OF EPICURUS\r\n  THE CRIME OF SYLVESTRE BONNARD\r\n  THE WELL OF ST. CLARE\r\n  THE OPINIONS OF JEROME COIGNARD\r\n  JOCASTA AND THE FAMISHED CAT\r\n  BALTHASAR\r\n  THE ASPIRATIONS OF JEAN SERVIEN\r\n  THE ELM TREE ON THE MALL\r\n  MY FRIEND'S BOOK\r\n  THE WICKER-WORK WOMAN\r\n  THAÏS\r\n  AT THE SIGN OF THE QUEEN PÉDAUQUE\r\n  JOAN OF ARC (2 vols.)\r\n\r\n¶ All the books will be published at 6/- each with the exception\r\nof JOAN OF ARC, which will be 25/- net the two volumes, with eight\r\nIllustrations.\r\n\r\n¶ The format of the volumes leaves little to be desired. The size\r\nis Demy 8vo (9 × 5-3/4 in.), that of this Prospectus, and they will\r\nbe printed from Caslon type upon a paper light in weight and strong\r\nin texture, with a cover design in crimson and gold, a gilt top,\r\nend-papers from designs by Aubrey Beardsley and initials by Henry\r\nOspovat. In short, these are volumes for the bibliophile as well as\r\nthe lover of fiction, and form perhaps the cheapest library edition\r\nof copyright novels ever published, for the price is only that of an\r\nordinary novel.\r\n\r\n¶ The translation of these books has been entrusted to such competent\r\nFrench scholars as MR. ALFRED ALLINSON, HON. MAURICE BARING,\r\nMR. FREDERIC CHAPMAN, MR. ROBERT B. DOUGLAS, MR. A.W. EVANS, MRS.\r\nFARLEY, MRS. JOHN LANE, MRS. NEWMARCH, MR. C.E. ROCHE, MISS WINIFRED\r\nSTEPHENS, and MISS M.P. WILLCOCKS.\r\n\r\n¶ As Anatole Thibault, _dit_ Anatole France, is to most English\r\nreaders merely a name, it will be well to state that he was born in\r\n1844 in the picturesque and inspiring surroundings of an old bookshop\r\non the Quai Voltaire, Paris, kept by his father, Monsieur Thibault,\r\nan authority on eighteenth-century history, from whom the boy caught\r\nthe passion for the principles of the Revolution, while from his\r\nmother he was learning to love the ascetic ideals chronicled in the\r\nLives of the Saints. He was schooled with the lovers of old books,\r\nmissals and manuscripts; he matriculated on the Quais with the old\r\nJewish dealers of curios and _objets d'art_; he graduated in the\r\ngreat university of life and experience. It will be recognised that\r\nall his work is permeated by his youthful impressions; he is, in\r\nfact, a virtuoso at large.\r\n\r\n¶ He has written about thirty volumes of fiction. His first novel was\r\nJOCASTA & THE FAMISHED CAT (1879). THE CRIME OF SYLVESTRE BONNARD\r\nappeared in 1881, and had the distinction of being crowned by the\r\nFrench Academy, into which he was received in 1896.\r\n\r\n¶ His work is illuminated with style, scholarship, and psychology;\r\nbut its outstanding features are the lambent wit, the gay mockery,\r\nthe genial irony with which he touches every subject he treats. But\r\nthe wit is never malicious, the mockery never derisive, the irony\r\nnever barbed. To quote from his own GARDEN OF EPICURUS: \"Irony and\r\nPity are both of good counsel; the first with her smiles makes life\r\nagreeable, the other sanctifies it to us with her tears. The Irony\r\nI invoke is no cruel deity. She mocks neither love nor beauty. She\r\nis gentle and kindly disposed. Her mirth disarms anger and it is she\r\nteaches us to laugh at rogues and fools whom but for her we might be\r\nso weak as to hate.\"\r\n\r\n¶ Often he shows how divine humanity triumphs over mere ascetism, and\r\nwith entire reverence; indeed, he might be described as an ascetic\r\noverflowing with humanity, just as he has been termed a \"pagan,\r\nbut a pagan constantly haunted by the pre-occupation of Christ.\"\r\nHe is in turn--like his own Choulette in THE RED LILY--saintly\r\nand Rabelaisian, yet without incongruity. At all times he is the\r\nunrelenting foe of superstition and hypocrisy. Of himself he once\r\nmodestly said: \"You will find in my writings perfect sincerity (lying\r\ndemands a talent I do not possess), much indulgence, and some natural\r\naffection for the beautiful and good.\"\r\n\r\n¶ The mere extent of an author's popularity is perhaps a poor\r\nargument, yet it is significant that two books by this author are\r\nin their HUNDRED AND TENTH THOUSAND, and numbers of them well\r\ninto their SEVENTIETH THOUSAND, whilst the one which a Frenchman\r\nrecently described as \"Monsieur France's most arid book\" is in its\r\nFIFTY-EIGHTH THOUSAND.\r\n\r\n¶ Inasmuch as M. FRANCE'S ONLY contribution to an English periodical\r\nappeared in THE YELLOW BOOK, vol. v., April 1895, together with the\r\nfirst important English appreciation of his work from the pen of the\r\nHon. Maurice Baring, it is peculiarly appropriate that the English\r\nedition of his works should be issued from the Bodley Head.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  ORDER FORM\r\n\r\n  _________________________________________________ 190\r\n\r\n  _To Mr._ _________________________________________\r\n                    _Bookseller_\r\n\r\n  _Please send me the following works of Anatole France\r\n  to be issued in June and July:_\r\n\r\n  THE RED LILY\r\n  MOTHER OF PEARL\r\n  THE GARDEN OF EPICURUS\r\n  THE CRIME OF SYLVESTRE BONNARD\r\n\r\n  _for which I enclose_ _______________________________________\r\n\r\n      _Name_ _____________________________________________________\r\n\r\n      _Address_ __________________________________________________\r\n\r\n  JOHN LANE, PUBLISHER, THE BODLEY HEAD, VIGO ST.

Lenotre is perhaps the most\r\n     widely read of a group of modern French writers who have\r\n     succeeded in treating history from a point of view at\r\n     once scientific, dramatic and popular. He has made the\r\n     Revolution his particular field of research, and deals not\r\n     only with the most prominent figures of that period, but\r\n     with many minor characters whose life-stories are quite as\r\n     thrilling as anything in fiction. The localities in which\r\n     these dramas were enacted are vividly brought before us in\r\n     his works, for no one has reconstructed 18th century Paris\r\n     with more picturesque and accurate detail. \"The Daughter of\r\n     Louis XVI.\" is quite equal in interest and literary merit\r\n     to any of the volumes which have preceded it, not excepting\r\n     the famous Drama of Varennes. As usual, M. Lenotre draws\r\n     his material largely from contemporary documents, and among\r\n     the most remarkable memoirs reproduced in this book are\r\n     \"The Story of my Visit to the Temple\" by Harmand de la\r\n     Meuse, and the artless, but profoundly touching narrative\r\n     of the unhappy orphaned Princess: \"A manuscript written by\r\n     Marie Thérèse Charlotte of France upon the captivity of the\r\n     Princes and Princesses, her relatives, imprisoned in the\r\n     Temple.\" The illustrations are a feature of the volume and\r\n     include the so-called \"telescope\" portrait of the Princess,\r\n     sketched from life by an anonymous artist, stationed at a\r\n     window opposite her prison in the tower of the Temple._\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE STORY OF MY LIFE: an Autobiography by ALICE M.\r\nDIEHL, Novelist, Writer, and Musician.

James\r\n     Weale, then resident at Bruges, began that long series of\r\n     patient investigations into the history of Netherlandish\r\n     art which was destined to earn so rich a harvest. When\r\n     he began work Memlinc was still called Hemling, and was\r\n     fabled to have arrived at Bruges as a wounded soldier.\r\n     The van Eycks were little more than legendary heroes.\r\n     Roger Van der Weyden was little more than a name. Most of\r\n     the other great Netherlandish artists were either wholly\r\n     forgotten or named only in connection with paintings with\r\n     which they had nothing to do. Mr. Weale discovered Gerard\r\n     David, and disentangled his principal works from Memlinc's,\r\n     with which they were then confused. During a series of\r\n     years he published in the \"Beffroi,\" a magazine issued by\r\n     himself, the many important records from ancient archives\r\n     which threw a flood of light upon the whole origin and\r\n     development of the early Netherlandish school. By universal\r\n     admission he is hailed all over Europe as the father of\r\n     this study. It is due to him in great measure that the\r\n     masterpieces of that school, which by neglect were in\r\n     danger of perishing fifty years ago, are now recognised as\r\n     among the most priceless treasures of the Museums of Europe\r\n     and the United States. The publication by him, therefore,\r\n     in the ripeness of his years and experience, of the result\r\n     of his studies on the van Eycks is a matter of considerable\r\n     importance to students of art history. Lately, since the\r\n     revived interest in the works of the Early French painters\r\n     has attracted the attention of untrained speculators to\r\n     the superior schools of the Low Countries, a number of\r\n     wild theories have been started which cannot stand upright\r\n     in the face of recorded facts. A book is now needed which\r\n     will set down all those facts in full and accurate form.\r\n     Fullness and accuracy are the characteristics of all Mr.\r\n     Weale's work._\r\n\r\nVINCENZO FOPPA OF BRESCIA, FOUNDER OF THE LOMBARD SCHOOL, HIS LIFE\r\nAND WORK.

In the\r\n     Milanese district it was practically dominant for over\r\n     a quarter of a century, until the coming of Leonardo da\r\n     Vinci thrust Foppa and his followers into the shade, and\r\n     induced him to abandon Pavia, which had been his home for\r\n     more than thirty years, and to return to Brescia. The\r\n     object of the authors of this book has been to present a\r\n     true picture of the master's life based upon the testimony\r\n     of records in Italian archives; all facts hitherto known\r\n     relating to him have been brought together; all statements\r\n     have been verified; and a great deal of new and unpublished\r\n     material has been added. The authors have unearthed a large\r\n     amount of new material relating to Foppa, one of the most\r\n     interesting facts brought to light being that he lived\r\n     for twenty-three years longer than was formerly supposed.\r\n     The illustrations will include several pictures by Foppa\r\n     hitherto unknown in the history of art, and others which\r\n     have never before been published, as well as reproductions\r\n     of every existing work by the master at present known._\r\n\r\nCÉSAR FRANCK: A Study.
