He was seventeen\r\n    years old at that time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nMy Birth and Earliest Years in Kalamba\r\n\r\n\r\nI was born on Wednesday, the nineteenth of June, 1861. It was a few\r\ndays before the full of the moon. I found myself in a village. I had\r\nsome slight notions of the morning sun and of my parents. That is as\r\nmuch as I can recall of my baby days.\r\n\r\nThe training which I received from my earliest infancy is perhaps\r\nwhat formed my habits. I can recall clearly my first gloomy nights,\r\npassed on the azotea of our house. They seem as yesterday! They were\r\nnights filled with the poetry of sadness and seem near now because\r\nat present my days are so sad. On moonlight nights, I took my supper\r\non the azotea. My nurse, who was very fond of me, used to threaten\r\nto leave me to a terrible but imaginary being like the bogey of the\r\nEuropeans if I did not eat.\r\n\r\nI had nine sisters and a brother. Our father was a model parent. He\r\ngave us the education which was suitable in a family neither rich\r\nnor poor. He was thrifty. By careful saving, he was able to build\r\na stone house. He also bought another house; and he put up a nipa\r\ncottage on our plot of irrigated ground. The cottage was shaded by\r\nbananas and trees.\r\n\r\nAt nightfall, my mother had us all say our prayers together. Then\r\nwe would go to the azotea or to a window to enjoy the moonlight;\r\nand my nurse would tell us stories. Sometimes sad and sometimes gay,\r\nnurse's stories were always oriental in their imagination. In these\r\nstories, dead people, gold, and plants on which diamonds grew were\r\nall mixed together.\r\n\r\nWhen I was four years of age, my little sister Concha died, and for\r\nthe first time I cried because of love and sorrow. Till then I had\r\nshed tears only for my own faults, which my loving, prudent mother\r\nwell knew how to correct.\r\n\r\nI learned to write in my own village. My father looked after my\r\neducation. He paid an old man, who had been his schoolmate, to teach\r\nme the first steps in Latin. This teacher lived in our house till he\r\ndied, five months later. He had been in almost perfect health and it\r\nwas at the moment of death that he received extreme unction.\r\n\r\nIn June of 1868, I went to Manila with my father. That was just after\r\nthe birth of Trinidad, the third sister younger than myself. We went in\r\na casco which turned out to be a clumsy boat. I shall not try to tell\r\nhow happy I was at each new stop on the banks of the Pasig. Beside\r\nthis same river, a few years later, I was to be very sad. We went\r\nto Cainta, Taytay, and Antipolo, and then to Manila. In Santa Ana I\r\nvisited my eldest sister, Saturnina, who at that time was a student\r\nin La Concordia College. Then I returned to my village and remained\r\nuntil 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMy Schooling in Biñan\r\n\r\n\r\nBiñan is a town about one and one-half hour's drive from my own town,\r\nKalamba. My father was born in Biñan, and he wished me to go there to\r\ncontinue the study of Latin, which I had just begun. He sent me over\r\none Sunday in the care of my brother. The parting from my family was\r\ntearful on the side of my parents and my sisters, but I was nine years\r\nold and managed to hide my own tears. We reached Biñan at nightfall. We\r\nwent to an aunt's house where I was to live. When the moon came up,\r\na cousin took me around the town. Biñan appeared to me large and\r\nwealthy but neither attractive nor cheerful.\r\n\r\nMy brother left me after he presented me to the schoolmaster, who,\r\nit seemed, had been his own teacher. The schoolmaster was a tall,\r\nthin man with a long neck and a sharp nose. His body leaned slightly\r\nforward. He wore a shirt of sinamay that had been woven by the deft\r\nfingers of Batangas women. He knew Latin and Spanish grammar by heart;\r\nbut his severity, I believe now, was too great. This is all that I\r\nremember of him. His classroom was in his own house, only some thirty\r\nmeters from my aunt's home.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered the classroom for the first time, he said to me:\r\n\r\n\"You, do you speak Spanish?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little, sir,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know Latin?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little, sir,\" I again answered.\r\n\r\nBecause of these answers, the teacher's son, who was the worst boy in\r\nthe class, began to make fun of me. He was some years my elder and\r\nwas taller than I, yet we had a tussle. Somehow or other, I don't\r\nknow how, I got the better of him. I bent him down over the class\r\nbenches. Then I let him loose, having hurt only his pride. After this,\r\npossibly because of my small size, my schoolmates thought me a clever\r\nwrestler. On going from the class one boy challenged me. He offered\r\nme my hold, but I lost and came near breaking my head on the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nI do not want to take up time with telling about the beatings I\r\ngot, nor shall I attempt to say how it hurt when I received the\r\nfirst ruler blow on my hand. I used to win in the competitions,\r\nfor no one happened to be better than I. I made the most of these\r\nsuccesses. But in spite of the reputation I had of being a good boy,\r\nrare were the days in which my teacher did not call me up to receive\r\nfive or six blows on the hand. When I went out with my companions,\r\nthey jokingly called me nicknames. But individually they used to\r\nbe so kind to me that I thought little of their teasings. A few of\r\nthem were very good and always treated me well. Among these few was\r\na second cousin of mine. Later, some of them were my schoolmates in\r\nManila and then it became my turn to tease.\r\n\r\nNear the house of my teacher, Justiniano Aquin Cruz, lived his\r\nfather-in-law, generally called Juancho. Juancho was an aged artist\r\nwho let me help him with his paintings. I had already such a liking\r\nfor this art that our schoolmates called José Guevarra, another pupil,\r\nand myself the class painters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMy Daily Life in Biñan\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of us lived in the same house. There were my aunt, two cousins,\r\nand three half-cousins. My aunt was a very old lady, over seventy. She\r\nused to sit on the floor and read the Bible in Tagalog. One cousin\r\nwas a maiden lady who liked very much to go to confession and to do\r\npenances. The other cousin, her brother, was a widower.\r\n\r\nOne of the half-cousins was something of a tomboy. She was quick to\r\nanger but frank and true-hearted. At times, we young folks played\r\nin the street at night. Our elders did not permit us to play in the\r\nhouse. The tomboy was two or three years older than I and taught me\r\ngames. She always treated me as if I were her brother.\r\n\r\nMy manner of life was simple. I heard mass at four if there were a\r\nservice so early, or studied my lessons at that hour and went to mass\r\nafterwards. Then I went out in the yard and looked for mabolos. Then\r\ncame breakfast, which generally consisted of a plate of rice and two\r\ndried sardines. There was class work till ten o'clock and after lunch a\r\nstudy period. In the afternoon, there was school from two o'clock until\r\nfive. Next, there would be play with my cousins for a while. Study\r\nand perhaps painting took up the remainder of the afternoon. By\r\nand by came supper, one or two plates of rice with a fish called\r\nayungin. In the evening we had prayers and then, if it was moonlight,\r\na cousin and I would play in the street with the others. Fortunately,\r\nI was never ill while away from home. From time to time, I went to my\r\nown village. How long the trip seemed going, and how short coming back!\r\n\r\nMany things happened which it would be tiresome to read. Finally,\r\nthere came a letter from my sister Saturnina which announced that the\r\nsteamer Talim would stop for me on a certain day. I said good-bye\r\nto my numerous friends and teacher. To my teacher, I expressed my\r\nsadness in leaving and my gratitude for his instruction. Although\r\nhe had punished me frequently, he did so, I now think, out of the\r\nkindness of his heart; and his heart was heavy when he did it.\r\n\r\nI left Biñan on Saturday afternoon, the seventeenth of December,\r\n1870. I was then nine years old. For the first time, I saw what a\r\nsteamer really was. It seemed to me most beautiful and in every way\r\nadmirable. But I heard my cousin, who was with me, make remarks to\r\nthe banquero that were not complimentary to her speed. I was the only\r\npassenger from Biñan. Two sailors put my baggage into a cabin. Then I\r\nwent to inspect it. I thought I was going to be without a cabin-mate,\r\nbut a Frenchman, Arturo Camps, who was a friend of my father, looked\r\nafter me. The journey seemed very long, but finally we arrived\r\nat Kalamba.\r\n\r\nOh! how glad I was to see the shore! At once I wanted to jump\r\ninto the first banca. A deckhand took me in his arms and put me\r\ninto the captain's boat. Then the Frenchman came and four sailors\r\nrowed us ashore. It is impossible to describe my joy when I saw a\r\nservant waiting for us with a carriage. I jumped in and soon found\r\nmyself again in our home, happy in the love of my family. Here end\r\nmy recollections of that period of mingled sadness and gladness,\r\nin which, for the first time, I came to know anybody of foreign birth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nThe Injustice Done My Mother\r\n\r\n(This chapter and the next one, Rizal wrote in 1879. At that time he\r\nwas eighteen years old.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSome days after my return to Kalamba, my parents decided that I\r\nshould remain, and that later, I should go to Manila. I wanted to\r\nstudy with a teacher of the town, even though I could learn no more\r\nthan multiplication, so I entered the village school.\r\n\r\nAt this time, an uncle of mine, Don José Alberto, returned from\r\nEurope. He found that during his absence, his wife had left his\r\nhome and abandoned her children. The poor man anxiously sought his\r\nwife and, at my mother's earnest request, he took her back. They\r\nwent to live in Biñan. Only a few days later the ungrateful woman\r\nplotted with a Guardia Civil officer who was a friend of ours. She\r\naccused her husband of poisoning her and charged that my mother was\r\nan accomplice. On this charge, the alcalde sent my mother to prison.\r\n\r\nI do not like to tell of the deep grief which we all, nine sisters\r\nand brothers, felt. Our mother's arrest, we knew, was unjust. The\r\nmen who arrested her pretended to be friends and had often been\r\nour guests. Ever since then, child though I was, I have distrusted\r\nfriendship. We learned later that our mother, away from us all and\r\nalong in years, was ill. From the first, the alcalde believed the\r\naccusation. He was unfair in every way and treated my mother rudely,\r\neven brutally. Finally, he persuaded her to confess to what they wished\r\nby promising to set her free and to let her see her children. What\r\nmother could resist that? What mother would not sacrifice life itself\r\nfor her children?\r\n\r\nThey terrified and deceived my mother as they would have any\r\nother mother. They threatened to condemn her if she did not say\r\nwhat they wished. She submitted to the will of her enemies and\r\nlost her spirit. The case became involved until the same alcalde\r\nasked pardon for her. But this was only when the matter was before\r\nthe Supreme Court. He asked for the pardon because he was sorry\r\nfor what he had done. Such was his meanness that I felt afraid of\r\nhim. Attorneys Francisco de Marcaida and Manuel Masigan, Manila's\r\nleading lawyers, defended my mother and they finally succeeded in\r\nhaving her acquitted. They proved her innocence to her judges, her\r\naccusers and her hosts of enemies. But after how much delay?--After\r\ntwo and a half years.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile my father decided to send me to Manila with my brother\r\nPaciano. I was to take the entrance examinations for the secondary\r\ncourse in the Ateneo Municipal. I arrived in Manila on June 10th,\r\n1872. I found out for the first time what examinations were like. My\r\nexaminations were in Christian doctrine, arithmetic and reading,\r\nin San Juan de Letran College. They gave me a passing mark and I\r\nreturned to my home. A few days later came the celebration of the\r\ntown festival, after which I went to Manila. But even then, I felt\r\nthat unhappiness was in store for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nA Student in Manila\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I had hoped, I was taken to the Jesuit priest at that time in charge\r\nof the Ateneo Municipal. He was Father Magin Fernando. At first he\r\nwas unwilling to admit me. One reason was I had come late. Other\r\nreasons were that I did not seem strong and was very small for my\r\nage. I was then eleven. But later, Doctor Manuel Xeres Burgos, a\r\nnephew of the ill-fated Padre Burgos, spoke in my favor; and Father\r\nFernando admitted me.\r\n\r\nI dressed myself in the uniform like the other students, wearing a\r\nwhite coat, or americana, and a necktie, and entered the chapel of the\r\nJesuit Fathers to hear mass. What fervent prayers did I address to God!\r\n\r\nAfter mass, I went to the classroom. There I saw a number of boys,\r\nSpanish, mestizos and natives, and a Jesuit teacher. Father José Bech,\r\nthe teacher, was a tall man, thin and somewhat stooping, but quick in\r\nhis movements. His face was thin and pale, yet lively. His eyes were\r\nsmall and sunken, his nose sharp and Grecian. His thin lips curved\r\ndownwards. He was a little eccentric, sometimes being out of humor\r\nand intolerant; at other times amusing himself by playing like a child.\r\n\r\nSome of my schoolmates were interesting enough to warrant mentioning\r\nthem by name. Florencio Gavino Oliva, a young man from my own province,\r\nhad great talent but he did not work steadily. The same thing was\r\ntrue of Moisés Santiago, a mathematician and a penman. It was also\r\ntrue of Gonzalo Manzano, who then held the position of \"Roman Emperor.\"\r\n\r\nIn Jesuit colleges they divide the boys into two groups or\r\n\"empires,\"--one Roman and the other Greek. These two \"empires\" are\r\nalways at war. The boys of one \"empire\" always want to outdo those of\r\nthe other empire in all kinds of contests. Each group has a leader\r\nwho is called \"Emperor.\" The \"Emperor\" wins his place by doing the\r\nbest work and standing the highest of anyone in his group. I was put\r\nat the end of the line. I could scarcely speak Spanish, but I already\r\nunderstood it.\r\n\r\nAfter the religious exercises, I went out and found my brother waiting\r\nto take me to my lodgings, which were about twenty-five minutes'\r\nwalk from the college. My brother did not wish to leave me in the\r\nWalled City, which seemed very gloomy to me.\r\n\r\nI lodged in a small house on Calle Caraballo, near an estero. The house\r\nconsisted of a dining room, a sala, a bedroom and a kitchen. An awning\r\ncovered the small space between the door and the steps. My landlady\r\nwas a maiden lady called Titay, who owed our family three hundred\r\npesos. Her mother, a good old woman, lived with her. There were besides\r\na crazy woman, quite harmless, and some Spanish mestizos in the house.\r\n\r\nI must not speak of my sufferings, or of my troubles and pleasures. I\r\nshall record only what happened in school during that year. By the\r\nend of the first week, I was going up in the class. Then I began to\r\nspend the siesta-time studying at Santa Isabel College. For this,\r\nI paid three pesos a month. I went there with Pastor Millena, a boy\r\nof my own age. A month later, I was \"Emperor\".\r\n\r\nHow pleased I was when I won my first prize, a religious\r\npicture! In the first quarter I gained another prize, with the\r\ngrade \"Excellent.\" After that I did not care to apply myself. I\r\nhad foolishly become dissatisfied because of something my teacher\r\nsaid. Unfortunately, this continued until the end of the year and I\r\ngained only second place in all my subjects. This gave me the grade of\r\n\"Excellent\" but without any prize.\r\n\r\nI spent the vacation at home and went with my eldest sister, Nening,\r\nto Tanawan, for the town festival. This was in 1873. But our pleasure\r\nwas marred by the fact that our mother was not with us. I had gone\r\nalone to see my mother without first sending word either to her or to\r\nmy father. This was at the close of the term in which I held second\r\nplace. I thought with what joy I would surprise her. Instead, we wept\r\nin each other's arms. We had not seen each other for more than a year.\r\n\r\nAfter vacation was over, I returned to Manila and enrolled in the\r\nsecond year. Then I hunted lodgings in the Walled City. It was too\r\ntiring to live so far away. I found a place at 6 Calle Magallanes\r\nin the house of an elderly widow, Doña Pepay. Her daughter, also a\r\nwidow, lived with her. The name of the daughter was Doña Encarnación,\r\nand her four sons were José, Rafael, Ignacio, and Ramón.\r\n\r\nNothing worth telling happened that year. My professor was the same\r\nas in the previous year; but I had different schoolmates. Among them\r\nI found three who had been with me in Biñan. At the end of this year,\r\nI won a medal and returned to my town.\r\n\r\nI again went alone to visit my mother in prison. Like another Joseph,\r\nI prophesied to her from a dream that her release would take place\r\nwithin three months. This prediction happened to come true.\r\n\r\nAt this time, I began to devote my leisure to reading novels. Years\r\nbefore, I had read one, but it was not with any great interest. Imagine\r\nhow a romantic youngster of twelve would delight in the Count of Monte\r\nCristo! Under the pretext that I should have to study general history,\r\nI persuaded my father to buy me a set of Cesar Cantu y Diós' histories.\r\n\r\nI gained much by reading them. In spite of my only half applying\r\nmyself and of my indifferent Spanish, I was able to win prizes in\r\nthe quarterly examinations. I should have gained the medal if I had\r\nnot made some slips in Spanish, which I spoke very poorly. This gave\r\nthe place to a Spanish lad who spoke his mother tongue better than\r\nI could. Thus, then, I finished my third year.\r\n\r\nWhen I next returned to Manila, I found my former landlady's house\r\nfull. I had to take a room in the house with my brother, Paciano\r\nMercado, in company with a boy from my town named Quintero. My life\r\nwas not so free as formerly, for I was under close supervision. The\r\nregular hours, however, were better for me. I prayed and played with\r\nmy landlord's children.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A portrait of General Paciano Rizal-Mercado should appear here,\r\n    but he has never had his picture taken. In September, 1896,\r\n    he was cruelly tortured in an unsuccessful endeavor to get\r\n    him to sign a statement that his brother was the leader of the\r\n    rebellion. Rizal's last letter, from the Fort Santiago death-cell,\r\n    tells how much the younger brother owed to the elder:\r\n\r\n    \"My dear brother: Now that I am about to die, it is to you that\r\n    I write my last letter. I am thinking of how you worked to give\r\n    me my career....\r\n\r\n    ... I believe that I have tried not to lose my time ... I know\r\n    how much you have suffered for my sake. ... I assure you, brother,\r\n    that I die innocent of this crime of rebellion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA little later my mother was proved innocent and she was set free. She\r\ncame to embrace me as soon as she was free. After the vacation, in\r\nthat memorable year of my mother's release, I again had my lodgings\r\nin the Walled City. The house was in Calle Solana and belonged to a\r\npriest. My mother had not wanted me to return to Manila, saying that\r\nI already had sufficient education. Did she have a presentiment of\r\nwhat was going to happen to me? Can it be that a mother's heart gives\r\nher double vision?\r\n\r\nMy future profession was still unsettled. My father wanted me to\r\nstudy metaphysics, so I enrolled in that course. But my interest was\r\nso slight that I did not even buy a copy of the textbook. A former\r\nschoolmate, who had finished his course three months before, was\r\nmy only intimate friend. He lived in the same street as I did. My\r\ncompanions in the house were from Batangas and had only recently\r\narrived in Manila.\r\n\r\nOn Sundays and other holidays, this friend used to call for me and we\r\nwould spend the day at my great-aunt's house in Trozo. My aunt knew\r\nhis father. When my youngest sister entered La Concordia College, I\r\nused to visit her, too, on the holidays. Another friend had a sister\r\nin the same school, so we could go together. I made a pencil sketch\r\nof his sister from a photograph which she lent me. On December 8th,\r\nthe festival of La Concordia, some other students and I went to the\r\ncollege. It was a fine day and the building was gay with decorations\r\nof banners, lanterns and flowers.\r\n\r\nShortly after that, I went home for the Christmas holidays. On\r\nthe same steamer, was a Kalamba girl who had been a pupil in Santa\r\nCatalina College for nearly five years. Her father was with her. We\r\nwere well acquainted but her schooling had made her bashful. She\r\nkept her back to me while we talked. To help her pass the time, I\r\nasked about her school and studies but I got hardly more than \"yes\"\r\nand \"no\" in answer. She seemed to have almost, if not entirely,\r\nforgotten her Tagalog. When I walked into our house in Kalamba,\r\nmy mother at first did not recognize me. The sad cause was that she\r\nhad almost lost her sight. My sisters greeted me joyfully and I could\r\nread their welcome in their smiling faces. But my father, who seemed\r\nto be the most pleased of all, said least.\r\n\r\nThe next day we were expecting friends from Manila to arrive, on\r\ntheir way to Lipa. But the steamer landed its passengers at Biñan\r\nbecause of a storm. So I saddled a pony and rode over there to meet\r\nthem. My horse proved to be a good traveler and when I got back to\r\nKalamba I rode on, by the Los Baños road, to our sugar mill. There\r\nI tied the horse by the roadside and for a time watched the water\r\nflowing through the irrigation ditch. Its swiftness reminded me of\r\nhow rapidly my days were going by. I am now twenty years old and\r\nhave the satisfaction of remembering that in the crises of my life\r\nI have not followed my own pleasure. I have always tried to live by\r\nmy principles and to do the heavy duties which I have undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FIRST READING LESSON\r\n\r\nThis tells how he himself became an intelligent student. It was\r\nprobably written while he was studying the schools of Saxony. These\r\nwere the models for America so that the present educational system\r\nhere is along the lines he advocated. As a child he had written a poem,\r\n\"By Education the Fatherland Gains in Splendor\".\r\n\r\n\r\nI remember the time when I had not seen any other river than the\r\none near my town. It was as clear as crystal, and joyous, too, as\r\nit ran on its course. But it was shaded by bamboos whose boughs bent\r\nto every breeze as if always complaining. That was my only world. It\r\nwas bounded at the back by the blue mountains of my province. It was\r\nbounded in front by the white surface of the lake. The lake was as\r\nsmooth as a mirror. Graceful sails were to be seen everywhere on it.\r\n\r\nAt that age, stories pleased me greatly and, with all my soul, I\r\nbelieved whatever was in the books. There were good reasons why I\r\nshould. My parents told me to be very careful of my books. They urged\r\nme to read and understand them. But they punished me for the least lie.\r\n\r\nMy first recollection of reciting my letters reaches back to my\r\nbabyhood. I must have been very little then, for when they rubbed the\r\nfloor of our house with banana leaves I almost fell down. I slipped\r\non the polished surface as beginners in skating do on ice. It took\r\ngreat effort for me to climb into a chair. I went downstairs step by\r\nstep. I clung to each round of the baluster.\r\n\r\nIn our house, as in all others in the town, kerosene oil was unknown. I\r\nhad never seen a lamp in our town, nor a carriage on our streets. Yet\r\nI thought Kalamba was a very gay and lively town. One night, all the\r\nfamily, except my mother and myself, went to bed early. Why, I do\r\nnot know, but we two remained sitting alone. The candles had already\r\nbeen put out. They had been blown out in their globes by means of\r\na curved tube of tin. That tube seemed to me the finest and most\r\nwonderful plaything in the world. The room was dimly lighted by a\r\nsingle light of coconut oil. In all Filipino homes such a light burns\r\nthrough the night. It goes out just at day-break to awaken people by\r\nits spluttering.\r\n\r\nMy mother was teaching me to read in a Spanish reader called \"The\r\nChildren's Friend.\" This was quite a rare book and an old copy. It\r\nhad lost its cover and my sister had cleverly made a new one. She had\r\nfastened a sheet of thick blue paper over the back and then covered\r\nit with a piece of cloth.\r\n\r\nThis night my mother became impatient with hearing me read so poorly. I\r\ndid not understand Spanish and so I could not read with expression. She\r\ntook the book from me. First she scolded me for drawing funny pictures\r\non its pages. Then she told me to listen and she began to read. When\r\nher sight was good, she read very well. She could recite well, and she\r\nunderstood verse-making, too. Many times during Christmas vacations,\r\nmy mother corrected my poetical compositions, and she always made\r\nvaluable criticisms.\r\n\r\nI listened to her, full of childish enthusiasm. I marveled at the\r\nnice-sounding phrases which she read from those same pages. The phrases\r\nshe read so easily stopped me at every breath. Perhaps I grew tired\r\nof listening to sounds that had no meaning for me. Perhaps I lacked\r\nself-control. Anyway, I paid little attention to the reading. I was\r\nwatching the cheerful flame. About it, some little moths were circling\r\nin playful flights. By chance, too, I yawned. My mother soon noticed\r\nthat I was not interested. She stopped reading. Then she said to me:\r\n\"I am going to read you a very pretty story. Now pay attention.\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing the word \"story\" I at once opened my eyes wide. The word\r\n\"story\" promised something new and wonderful. I watched my mother\r\nwhile she turned the leaves of the book, as if she were looking for\r\nsomething. Then I settled down to listen. I was full of curiosity and\r\nwonder. I had never even dreamed that there were stories in the old\r\nbook which I read without understanding. My mother began to read me\r\nthe fable of the young moth and the old one. She translated it into\r\nTagalog a little at a time.\r\n\r\nMy attention increased from the first sentence. I looked toward the\r\nlight and fixed my gaze on the moths which were circling around it. The\r\nstory could not have been better timed. My mother repeated the warning\r\nof the old moth. She dwelt upon it and directed it to me. I heard her,\r\nbut it is a curious thing that the light seemed to me each time more\r\nbeautiful, the flame more attractive. I really envied the fortune of\r\nthe insects. They frolicked so joyously in its enchanting splendor\r\nthat the ones which had fallen and been drowned in the oil did not\r\ncause me any dread.\r\n\r\nMy mother kept on reading and I listened breathlessly. The fate of\r\nthe two insects interested me greatly. The flame rolled its golden\r\ntongue to one side and a moth which this movement had singed fell into\r\nthe oil, fluttered for a time and then became quiet. That became for\r\nme a great event. A curious change came over me which I have always\r\nnoticed in myself whenever anything has stirred my feelings. The flame\r\nand the moth seemed to go farther away and my mother's voice sounded\r\nstrange and uncanny. I did not notice when she ended the fable. All\r\nmy attention was fixed on the fate of the insect. I watched it with\r\nmy whole soul. I gave to it my every thought. It had died a martyr\r\nto its illusions.\r\n\r\nAs she put me to bed, my mother said: \"See that you do not behave\r\nlike the young moth. Don't become disobedient, or you may get burnt\r\nas it did.\" I do not know whether I answered or not. I don't know\r\nwhether I promised anything or whether I cried. But I do remember\r\nthat it was a long time before I fell asleep. The story revealed to me\r\nthings until then unknown. Moths no longer were, for me, insignificant\r\ninsects. Moths talked; they knew how to warn. They advised, just like\r\nmy mother. The light seemed to me more beautiful. It had grown more\r\ndazzling and more attractive. I knew why the moths circled the flame.\r\n\r\nThe advice and warnings sounded feebly in my ears. What I thought\r\nof most was the death of the heedless moth. But in the depth of my\r\nheart I did not blame it. My mother's care had not had quite the\r\nresult she intended.\r\n\r\nYears have passed since then. The child has become a man. He has\r\ncrossed the most famous rivers of other countries. He has studied\r\nbeside their broad streams. He has crossed seas and oceans. He\r\nhas climbed mountains much higher than the Makiling of his native\r\nprovince, up to perpetual snow. He has received from experience\r\nbitter lessons, much more bitter than that sweet teaching which his\r\nmother gave him. Yet, in spite of all, the man still keeps the heart\r\nof a child. He still thinks that light is the most beautiful thing\r\nin creation, and that to sacrifice one's life for it is worth while.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY CHILDHOOD IMPRESSIONS\r\n\r\n    One of numerous rough drafts evidently written for\r\n    practice. Published as \"Mi Primer Recuerdo,\" in El Renacimiento,\r\n    Manila, February 2, 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\nI spent many, many hours of my childhood down on the shore of the lake,\r\nLaguna de Bay. I was thinking of what was beyond. I was dreaming of\r\nwhat might be over on the other side of the waves. Almost every day,\r\nin our town, we saw the Guardia Civil lieutenant caning and injuring\r\nsome unarmed and inoffensive villager. The villager's only fault was\r\nthat while at a distance he had not taken off his hat and made his\r\nbow. The alcalde treated the poor villagers in the same way whenever\r\nhe visited us.\r\n\r\nWe saw no restraint put upon brutality. Acts of violence and\r\nother excesses were committed daily. The officers whose duty it\r\nwas to protect the people and keep the public peace were the real\r\noutlaws. Against such lawbreakers, our authorities were powerless. I\r\nasked myself if, in the lands which lay across the lake, the\r\npeople lived in this same way. I wondered if there they tortured\r\nany countryman with hard and cruel whips merely on suspicion. Did\r\nthey there respect the home? Or over yonder also, in order to live\r\nin peace, would one have to bribe tyrants?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPANISH SCHOOLS OF MY BOYHOOD\r\n\r\n    From the introduction which Doctor Rizal put to his Spanish\r\n    version of an article on \"The Transliteration of Tagalog\". His\r\n    advocacy of the English style used in other Malay countries\r\n    as more akin to the genius of Filipino dialects was considered\r\n    extremely unpatriotic by most Spaniards.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou perhaps attended a village Spanish school to learn your\r\nletters. Possibly, you have had to teach the letters in Spanish to\r\nothers smaller than yourself. In either case, you must have noticed\r\nwhat I have, that children find great difficulty in mastering certain\r\nsyllables. These are ca, ce, ci, co, ga, ge, gua, gui, etc. It is\r\nbecause Filipino children do not understand the reasons for such\r\nirregularities. Nor do they know the cause for the changes in value\r\nof the sounds of certain consonants.\r\n\r\nIn the old times, blows fell like rain. Many pupils were whipped every\r\nday. Sometimes the schoolmaster broke the ferule and sometimes he\r\nbroke the children's hands. The first pages of their primers fell to\r\npieces from long and hard use. The children cried. Even the monitors\r\nhad to suffer at times. Yet those syllables which cost the children\r\nso many tears are of no use to them.\r\n\r\nThose syllables are necessary only in the learning of Spanish,\r\nwhich language in my time only three boys in a thousand ever really\r\nlearned. These three learned it in Manila, by hearing Spanish spoken,\r\nand by committing to memory book after book. I often wondered what\r\nwas the use of learning it at all when in the end one spoke only\r\nTagalog. But I kept my wonder to myself. I felt that to try to make\r\nreforms in the Philippines at that time would be to embark on a\r\nstormy voyage.\r\n\r\nAfter I grew up, I had to write letters in Tagalog. I was shocked at\r\nmy ignorance of its spelling. I was surprised, too, to find the same\r\nword spelled differently in the different works which I consulted. This\r\nproved to me how foolish it was to try to write Tagalog in the Spanish\r\nway. The spelling in use today by all Filipino scholars is a great\r\nimprovement over the old style. I want to place the credit for this\r\nchange where it belongs. These improvements are due to the studies\r\nin Tagalog of Dr. T. H. Pardo de Tavera alone. I have only been one\r\nof the most zealous champions of the change from the Spanish style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TURKEY THAT CAUSED THE KALAMBA LAND TROUBLE\r\n\r\n    This account was given Captain Carnicero, the Spanish commander\r\n    of the Dapitan district where Rizal was in exile, in 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy father was a friend of the owners of the Kalamba\r\nestate. He was intimate, too, with the manager in charge of the\r\nplantation. Frequently, important visitors came to the plantation\r\nhouse. Then the manager asked my father for whatever he needed. He\r\nvery often asked for a turkey, and my father gladly gave it to him. The\r\npoultry yard at our house was always full of turkeys because my father\r\nwas a fancier of these fowls.\r\n\r\nBut one season there came some epidemic and almost all the turkeys\r\ndied. Only a few pairs, which were being kept for breeding, were\r\nleft. Just at this time the manager one day sent for the customary\r\nturkey. Naturally my father had to tell the messenger that he had no\r\nturkeys to spare, because the greater part of them had died. This reply\r\nmade the manager furiously angry. He wound up his abuse by saying,\r\n\"You will pay for this in the end!\" A few days later my father received\r\na note from the manager, saying that he was going to raise the rent on\r\nthe land which my father occupied. He said the rent would be one-third\r\nmore than father was then paying.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this decision was clear. It was because my father had\r\nrefused to give the manager the turkey. The proof of this was that\r\nno other tenant received any such notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFather paid this increase on the day set, without a single word of\r\nprotest, being among the first to pay. But after a few months, there\r\ncame another note. In it the manager gave notice that the rent would\r\nbe doubled. This, he said, was because my father was growing rich\r\nfrom the rented land where he had installed machinery for making sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy father could not pay this price. Then he was summoned to appear\r\nin court; and finally the alcalde ordered him to leave the land. So\r\nhe lost his houses and machinery, all because of a turkey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM JAPAN TO ENGLAND ACROSS AMERICA\r\n\r\n    From letters written en route to his friend Mariano Ponce and\r\n    first published in Manuel Artigas' Biblioteca Nacional Filipina,\r\n    Manila, June, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn February 28th, 1888, I arrived in Yokohama. A few moments after\r\nreaching the hotel, I received the card of the official in charge at\r\nthe Spanish legation. I had not even had a chance to brush up when he\r\ncalled. He was very pleasant and offered to assist me in my work. He\r\neven invited me to live at the legation, and I accepted. If, at the\r\nbottom, there was a desire to watch me, I was not afraid to let them\r\nknow all about myself. I lived at the legation a little over a month,\r\nand traveled in some of the nearby provinces of Japan. At times,\r\nI was alone; at others, with the Spanish official himself, or with\r\nthe interpreter. While there, I learned to speak Japanese, and made a\r\nslight study of the Japanese theatre. After many offers of employment,\r\nwhich I refused, I sailed at last for America, about April 13th.\r\n\r\nOn the steamer, I met a half-Filipino family, the wife being a\r\nmestiza, the daughter of an Englishman named Jackson. They had with\r\nthem a servant from Pangasinan. The son asked me if I knew \"Richal,\"\r\nthe author of Noli Me Tangere. Smiling, I answered that I did; and,\r\nas he began to speak well of me, I had to make myself known and say\r\nthat I was the author. The mother paid me compliments, too. I made\r\nthe acquaintance of a Japanese who was going to Europe. He had been a\r\nprisoner for being a radical and editor of an independent newspaper. As\r\nthe Japanese spoke only Japanese, I acted as interpreter for him\r\nuntil we arrived in London.\r\n\r\nDuring this voyage I was not seasick.\r\n\r\nI visited the larger cities of America, where I saw splendid\r\nbuildings. The Americans have magnificent ideals. America is a homeland\r\nfor the poor who are willing to work.\r\n\r\nI traveled across America, and saw the majestic cascade of Niagara. I\r\nwas in New York, the great city, but there everything is new. I went\r\nto see some relics of Washington, that great man whom I fear has not\r\nhis equal in this century.\r\n\r\nI embarked for Europe on the \"City of Rome\", said to be the second\r\nlargest steamer in the world. On board, a newspaper was published up\r\nto the end of the voyage.\r\n\r\nI made the acquaintance of many people. They wondered at my taking\r\nabout with me a foreigner who could not make himself understood. The\r\nEuropeans and Americans were astonished to see how I got along with\r\nhim. I could speak to every one in his own language and understand\r\nwhat he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEPORTATION TO DAPITAN\r\n\r\n    First published in the Biblioteca National Filipina, Manila. The\r\n    account was secretly sent by Rizal to his friends very shortly\r\n    after his arrival at his place of exile. The reference to the\r\n    school is from a letter to Doctor Blumentritt.\r\n\r\n\r\nI arrived in Manila the 26th of June, 1892. It was on a Sunday,\r\nat 12 o'clock, noon. A number of carbineers, including a major, met\r\nme. A captain and a sergeant of the Guardia Veterana were there in\r\ncivilian clothes. I disembarked with my luggage, and they inspected\r\nit at the custom house.\r\n\r\nFrom there, I went to the Oriente Hotel. I occupied Room No. 22,\r\nwhich overlooks the Binondo Church.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, at four, I presented myself to His Excellency,\r\nGovernor-General Despujol. He told me to return at seven in the\r\nevening and I did so. He granted my petition for the liberty of my\r\nfather, but not for the liberty of my brother and sisters. He told\r\nme to return on Wednesday evening at half past seven.\r\n\r\nFrom there, I went to see my sisters. First I saw my sister Narcisa,\r\nafterwards Neneng (Saturnina). On the following day, Monday, at\r\nsix o'clock in the morning, I was at the railway station, bound for\r\nBulacan and Pampanga. I visited Malolos, San Fernando, and Tarlac. On\r\nthe return I stopped at Bacolor, reaching Manila on Tuesday at five\r\no'clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nSeven-thirty on Wednesday saw me with His Excellency. But not even\r\nthen did I get him to revoke the deportation decrees. Still he gave me\r\nhope for my sisters. As it was the festival of Saints Peter and Paul,\r\nour interview ended at 9:15. I was to present myself on the following\r\nday, at the same hour.\r\n\r\nThat day, Thursday, we spoke on unimportant matters. I thanked him\r\nfor having revoked the order to banish my sisters and told him that\r\nmy father and brother would come by the first mail-steamer. He asked\r\nme if I wished to return to Hongkong and I answered, \"Yes\". He told\r\nme to come again on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nWednesday he asked me if I persisted in my intention of returning\r\nto Hongkong. I told him that I did. After some conversation he said\r\nthat I had brought political circulars in my baggage. I replied that\r\nI had not. He asked me who was the owner of the roll of pillows and\r\npetates with my baggage. I said that they belonged to my sister. He\r\ntold me that because of them he was going to send me to Fort Santiago.\r\n\r\nDon Ramón Despujol, his nephew and aide, took me in one of the palace\r\ncarriages. At Fort Santiago Don Enrique Villamor, the commander,\r\nreceived me. He assigned me to an ordinary room containing a bed,\r\na dozen chairs, a table, a washstand, and a mirror. The room had\r\nthree windows. One, without bars, looked out on a court; another\r\nhad bars, and overlooked the wall and the beach; the third served\r\nalso as a door and had a padlock. Two artillerymen were on guard as\r\nsentinels. They had orders to fire on anyone who tried to make signs\r\nfrom the beach. I could not talk with anyone except the officer of\r\nthe guard, and I was not allowed to write.\r\n\r\nDon Enrique Villamor, the commander of the fort, gave me books from\r\nthe library.\r\n\r\nEach day the corporal of the guard proved to be a sergeant. They\r\ncleaned the room every morning. For breakfast, I had coffee with milk,\r\na roll, and coffee-cake. Lunch was at 12:30, and consisted of four\r\ncourses. Dinner was at 8:30, and was similar to the lunch. Commander\r\nVillamor's orderly waited on me.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 14th, about 5:30 or 6 p. m., the nephew notified me\r\nthat at ten o'clock that night I should sail for Dapitan. I prepared\r\nmy baggage, and at 10 was ready, but as no one came to get me, I went\r\nto sleep. At 12:15, the aide arrived with the same carriage which had\r\nbrought me there. By way of the Santa Lucia gate, they took me to the\r\nMalecon, where were General Ahumada and some other people. Another\r\naide and two of the Guardia Veterana were waiting for me in a boat.\r\n\r\nThe \"Cebu\" sailed in the morning at nine. They gave me a good stateroom\r\non the upper deck. Above the doors could be read \"Chief\". Next to my\r\ncabin was that of Capt. Delgras, who had charge of the party.\r\n\r\nTen from each branch of the military service were in the party. There\r\nwere artillery, infantry of the 70th, 71st, 72nd, 73rd, and 74th\r\nregiments, carbineers, cavalry and engineers, and Guardia Civil. Of\r\nartillerymen there were at least twelve.\r\n\r\nWe were carrying prisoners loaded with chains, among whom were a\r\nsergeant and a corporal, both Europeans. The sergeant was to be shot\r\nbecause he had ordered his superior officer, who had misbehaved while\r\nin Mindanao, to be tied up. The soldiers who obeyed orders and tied\r\nthe officer up were given twenty years' imprisonment; and the officer\r\nhimself was dismissed from the service because he had let them tie\r\nhim up.\r\n\r\nI ate in my stateroom, the food being the same as the officers had. I\r\nalways had a sentinel and a corporal on guard. Every night, Captain\r\nDelgras took me for a promenade on deck till 9 o'clock.\r\n\r\nWe passed along the east coast of Mindoro and the west coast of\r\nPanay. We came to Dapitan on Sunday, at seven in the evening. Captain\r\nDelgras and three artillerymen accompanied me in a boat rowed by\r\neight sailors. There was a heavy sea.\r\n\r\nThe beach seemed very gloomy. We were in the dark, except for our\r\nlantern, which showed a roadway grown up with weeds.\r\n\r\nIn the town we met the governor, or commandant, Captain Ricardo\r\nCarnicero. There was also a Spanish ex-exile, and the practicante,\r\nDon Cosme. We went to the town hall, which was a large building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy life now is quiet, peaceful, retired and without glory, but I\r\nthink it is useful too. I teach reading, Spanish, English, mathematics\r\nand geometry to the poor but intelligent boys here. Moreover I teach\r\nthem to behave like men. I have taught the men how to get a better\r\nway of earning their living and they think I am right. We have begun\r\nand success is crowning our trials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVICE TO A NEPHEW\r\n\r\n    Written from Dapitan. Rizal took great interest in the education\r\n    of his sisters' children and in Germany had made for them a\r\n    translation into Tagalog of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy\r\n    tales. This he embellished with many appropriate drawings and\r\n    wrote out very plainly, making a book of eighty pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that I ought to mention to you a slight error which I have\r\nnoticed in your letter. It is a little error which many in society\r\nmake.\r\n\r\nOne should not say, \"I and my sisters greet you,\" but \"My sisters and\r\nI greet you.\" Always you have to put yourself last. You should say:\r\n\"Emilio and I,\" \"You and I,\" \"My friend and I,\" and so on. For the\r\nrest, your letter is well written. In it you express your thoughts\r\nclearly. You use only the necessary words, and your spelling is good.\r\n\r\nKeep on advancing. Learn, learn and think much about what you\r\nlearn. Life is a very serious matter. It goes well only for those\r\nwho have intelligence and heart. To live is to be among men, and to\r\nbe among men is to strive.\r\n\r\nBut this strife is not a brute-like, selfish struggle,--nor with men\r\nalone. It is a strife with men, and at the same time with one's own\r\npassions. It is a struggle with the proprieties, with errors, with\r\nprejudices. It is a never-ending striving, with a smile on the lips\r\nand the tears in the heart.\r\n\r\nOn this battlefield, man has no better weapon than his intelligence. He\r\npossesses no more force than he has spirit. Bring out your\r\nintelligence, then, and improve it. Strengthen and educate yourself\r\nthat you may be prepared for the struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFILIPINO PROVERBS\r\n\r\n    The Proverbs and the Puzzles were published, with comments here\r\n    omitted, in Truebner's Oriental Magazine, London, June and July\r\n    issues of 1889.\r\n\r\n    Rizal's own English.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

It makes us see our weaknesses\r\nso that we may correct them.\r\n\r\nThere are three ways in which one may accompany the course of progress:\r\nin front of, beside, or behind it.\r\n\r\nWhere are the young men who will consecrate their best years, their\r\nambitions and their enthusiasms to the welfare of their native land?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIANG MAKILING\r\n\r\n    (This story is a favorite in my town.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMariang Makiling was a young woman. She lived somewhere on the\r\nbeautiful mountain Makiling, between Laguna province and Tayabas\r\nprovince. No one knew just where or how she lived. Some said she\r\nlived in a beautiful palace surrounded by gardens. Others said she\r\nlived in a poor hut made of nipa and bamboo.\r\n\r\nMaria was tall and graceful. Her color was a clear, pure brown,\r\nkayumanging kaligatan, as the Tagalogs say. Her eyes were big\r\nand black. Her hair was long and thick. Her hands and feet were\r\nsmall and delicate. She was a fairy-like creature born under the\r\nmoon-beams of the Philippines. She flitted in and out among the woods\r\nof Makiling. She was the ruling spirit of the mountain; but she seldom\r\ncame within sight of man.\r\n\r\nHunters sometimes saw Maria on the night of Good Friday when they\r\nwent out to trap deer. She would be standing motionless on the\r\nedge of some great cliff. Her long hair floated in the wind. She\r\nsometimes approached them. She would salute them gravely, then pass\r\non and disappear among the shadows of the trees. They never dared to\r\nquestion her, to follow her, or to watch her.\r\n\r\nShe liked best to appear after a storm. Then she would scurry over the\r\nfields bringing back life to the fallen plants, and setting everything\r\nto rights. The trees straightened up their wind-blown trunks. The\r\nstreams went back into their beds. All signs of the storm disappeared\r\nas she passed.\r\n\r\nMariang Makiling had a very good heart. She used to lend the poor\r\ncountry folk clothing or jewels for weddings, baptisms and feast\r\ndays. All she asked in return was a pullet as white as milk. It had\r\nto be a dumalaga; that is, one that had never laid an egg.\r\n\r\nSometimes she appeared as a simple country girl and helped the poor\r\nold women to pick up firewood. Then she would slip gold nuggets,\r\ncoins and jewels into their bundles of wood.\r\n\r\nA hunter was one day chasing a wild boar through the tall grass and\r\nthorny bushes. Suddenly he came to a hut in which the animal hid. A\r\nbeautiful young woman came out and said:\r\n\r\n\"The wild boar belongs to me. You have done wrong to chase it, but\r\nI see that you are very tired. Your arms and legs are covered with\r\nblood. Come in and eat. Then you may go on your way.\"\r\n\r\nThe man was charmed by the beauty of the young woman. He went in and\r\nate everything she offered him. But he was not able to speak a single\r\nword. Before the hunter left, the young woman gave him some pieces of\r\nginger. She told him to give them to his wife for her cooking. The\r\nhunter thanked her and put the roots inside the crown of his broad\r\nhat. On the way home his hat felt heavy. So he took out a number of\r\nthe pieces and threw them away. He was surprised and sorry the next\r\nday when his wife discovered that what they had taken to be ginger\r\nwas solid gold. The supposed roots were bright as rays of sunshine.\r\n\r\nBut Mariang Makiling was not always kind and generous to the\r\nhunters. Sometimes she punished them.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon two hunters were coming down the mountain, carrying\r\nsome wild boars and deer which they had killed during the day.\r\n\r\nThey met an old woman who begged them to give her a quarter. They\r\nthought that was too much to give, so they refused. The old woman said\r\nthat she would go and tell the mistress of those animals, and she\r\nleft them. This threat made the hunters laugh heartily. When night\r\nhad fallen and the two were near the plain, they heard a distant\r\nshout--very distant, as though it came from the top of the mountain:\r\n\r\n\"There they go-o-o--o!\"\r\n\r\nThen another even more distant cry replied:\r\n\r\n\"There they go-o-o--o!\"\r\n\r\nThat cry surprised both the hunters, who could not account for it. On\r\nhearing it, the dogs stuck up their ears. They uttered low growls\r\nand drew nearer to their masters. In a few minutes the same cry was\r\nheard again, this time from the mountain-side. On hearing it, the\r\ndogs thrust their tails between their legs and came close to their\r\nmasters. The men stared at each other without saying a word. They\r\nwere astonished that the one who uttered the cry could travel so far\r\nin such a short time. When they reached the plain, the fearful cry\r\nwas heard again. This time, it was so clear and distinct that both\r\nlooked back. In the moonlight, they could see two strange, gigantic\r\nshapes coming down the mountain at full speed. Both hunters ran as\r\nfast as they could with such heavy loads. Still the strange creatures\r\ncame nearer.\r\n\r\nThe men, coming to a spring called bukal, threw down their burdens,\r\nand climbed a tree; and the dogs fled toward the town. The monsters\r\ncame up, and in a few seconds devoured the wild boars and deer and went\r\nback toward the mountain. Only then, did the hunters recover. The more\r\ncourageous took aim but his gun missed fire and the monsters escaped.\r\n\r\nNo one ever knew whether Mariang Makiling had parents, brothers and\r\nsisters, or other kin. Such persons spring up naturally, like the\r\nstones the Tagalogs call mutya. No one ever knew her real name. She\r\nwas simply called Maria. No one ever saw her enter the town or take\r\npart in any religious ceremony. She remained ever the same. The\r\nfive or six generations that knew her always saw her young, fresh,\r\nsprightly, and pure.\r\n\r\nFor many years now no one has seen her on Makiling. Her vapor figure\r\nno longer wanders through the deep valleys. It no longer hovers over\r\nthe waterfall on the serene moonlight nights. The melancholy tone\r\nof her mysterious harp is no longer heard. Now lovers are married\r\nwithout getting from her either jewels or presents. Mariang Makiling\r\nhas disappeared.\r\n\r\nSome blame the people of a certain town who not only refused to give\r\nher the customary white pullet but even failed to return the jewels\r\nand clothing borrowed. Others say that Mariang Makiling is offended\r\nbecause some landlords are trying to take half of the mountain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHRONOLOGY OF THE LIFE OF JOSÉ RIZAL\r\n\r\n\r\n1848, June 28.--Rizal's parents married in Kalamba, La Laguna:\r\nFrancisco Rizal-Mercado y Alejandra (born in Biñan, April 18,1818)\r\nand Teodora Morales Alonso-Realonda y Quintos (born in Sta.

Rizal's\r\nallegory, \"The Council of the Gods\" was preferred by the judges,\r\nall Spaniards. But when the envelopes containing the contestants'\r\nnames were opened, there was objection to giving first prize to a\r\nFilipino when prominent Spaniards had taken part in the contest. Rizal\r\nsays that he was hissed off the stage when he appeared in answer to\r\nthe reading of his name. Manila newspapers of that period dared not\r\nspeak of the incident openly but there were several veiled allusions\r\nto it. One writer sarcastically said that medical students should be\r\nforbidden to write poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE GODS\r\n\r\n\"We gods and goddesses, met on Mount Olympus, find that the greatest\r\nthree authors in the world's history are of equal merit. So in justice\r\nequal respect must be paid them. To Homer we award fame's trumpet,\r\nto Vergil the lyre of glory, and to Cervantes the laurel wreath of\r\nimmortal honor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PHILIPPINE YOUTH\r\n\r\n\r\n      \"Hold high the brow serene,\r\n    O youth, where now you stand;\r\n    Let the bright sheen,\r\n    Of your grace be seen,\r\n    Fair hope of my Fatherland!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst verse of the winning poem, won by Rizal at the age of 17 in\r\na public competition open to \"Indians and Mestizos\". By these two\r\nnames, the Spaniard called, and divided, the Filipinos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY LAST THOUGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, beloved Fatherland, thou sunny clime of ours,\r\nPearl of the Orient Ocean, our lost Paradise!\r\nFor thee my life I give, nor mourn its saddened hours;\r\nAnd were't more bright, strewn less with thorns and more with flowers,\r\nFor thee I still would give it, a welcome sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRIZAL'S \"HYMN TO LABOR\"\r\n\r\nWords by José Rizal\r\n\r\n(Arranged from Chas.
