It has been his object to give as faithful a picture as possible\r\nof the physical aspect and natural productions of the country, together\r\nwith cursory remarks on the character, habits, and condition of the\r\ndifferent races, whether indigenous or otherwise, of which the population\r\nof those parts he visited is now composed. It is seldom that he has\r\ntrusted to information received from others on those points; and he\r\nhopes that this fact will be considered a sufficient reason for his not\r\nentering into desultory details more frequently than he has done.\r\n\r\nAmple opportunities were offered for studying the objects he had in view,\r\nof which he never ceased to avail himself. Besides visiting many places\r\nalong the coast his journeys in the interior were numerous; and, although\r\nhe never ventured, like Waterton—whose veracity is not to be doubted—to\r\nride on the bare back of an alligator, or engage in single combat with\r\na boa constrictor, yet he had his full share of adventure, particularly\r\nduring his last journey, which extended, north to south, from near the\r\nequator to the twenty-third degree of south latitude; and east to west,\r\nfrom the coast to the tributaries of the Amazon. The privations which the\r\ntraveller experiences in these uninhabited, and often desert countries,\r\ncan scarcely be appreciated by those who have never ventured into them,\r\nwhere he is exposed at times to a burning sun, at others to torrents of\r\nrain, such as are only to be witnessed within the tropics, separated\r\nfor years from all civilized society, sleeping for months together in\r\nthe open air, in all seasons, surrounded by beasts of prey and hordes\r\nof more savage Indians, often obliged to carry a supply of water on\r\nhorseback over the desert tracks, and not unfrequently passing two or\r\nthree days without tasting solid food, not even a monkey coming in the\r\nway to satisfy the cravings of hunger. Notwithstanding these, however,\r\nand one serious attack of illness, his enthusiasm carried him through all\r\ndifficulties, and they have in some measure been repaid by the pleasure\r\nwhich such wanderings always afford to the lover of nature, and by the\r\nnumber of new species which he has been enabled to add to the already\r\nlong list of organized beings.\r\n\r\nThe Author has only further to add, that the notes from which the\r\nNarrative has been drawn up, were, for the most part, written during\r\nthose hours, which, under other circumstances, should have been devoted\r\nto sleep; and that the Narrative itself was principally compiled from\r\nthem, during a voyage from England to the Island of Ceylon.\r\n\r\n    Kandy, Ceylon, January 1st, 1846.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript of Mr. Gardner’s ‘Travels in Brazil’ having been\r\ntransmitted from Ceylon, and printed during his official residence\r\nin that island, the Publishers feel desirous of expressing the great\r\nobligation they are under to John Miers, Esq., in the absence of the\r\nAuthor, for his valuable assistance in correcting the technical,\r\nbotanical, and Brazilian proper names, whilst passing through the press;\r\nthey also desire to record their sense of the kind services rendered by\r\nRobert Heward, Esq., co-operating with Mr. Miers in reading the proofs.\r\n\r\n    London, October 1st, 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    Page.\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                           RIO DE JANEIRO.\r\n\r\n    Motives for visiting Brazil—Voyage from England—Arrival at Rio\r\n    de Janeiro—Description of the City—Its Environs—Geological\r\n    Character of its Neighbourhood—Its Climate—Its\r\n    Inhabitants—State of Slavery in Brazil—General good treatment\r\n    of Slaves—Different Mixed Races—Excursion to the Mountains\r\n    surrounding the Capital—Its Botanical Garden—Museum of Natural\r\n    History                                                            1\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n          JOURNEY TO AND RESIDENCE IN THE ORGAN MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n    Principal Summer Resort of the English Residents—Journey from\r\n    Piedade to Magé and Frechal—Ascent of the Mountains—Description\r\n    of Virgin Forests—Mr. March’s Plantation in the Serra—Treatment\r\n    of his Slaves—Case of One bitten by a venomous Snake—Limb\r\n    amputated by the Author—Mode of Treatment in such cases among\r\n    the Natives—Charms—Tapir-Hunting in the Mountains—Beasts,\r\n    Birds, and Reptiles found there—Visit to a Brazilian\r\n    Fazendeiro—To Constantia—Ascent of the loftiest Peaks—Vegetable\r\n    Productions in those elevated regions—Pleasant Sojourn on the\r\n    Estate                                                            28\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                        BAHIA AND PERNAMBUCO.\r\n\r\n    Departure from Rio de Janeiro—Arrival at Bahia—Description of\r\n    that City—Voyage to Pernambuco—Jangadas—Description of the City\r\n    and Environs of Pernambuco—The Jesuits—The Peasantry—Town\r\n    of Olinda—Its Colleges and Botanic Garden—Visit to the\r\n    Village of Monteiro—The German Colony of Catucá—The Island of\r\n    Itamaricá—Pilar—Salt Works of Jaguaripe—Prevalent Diseases in\r\n    the Island—Its Fisheries—Peculiar Mode of Capture                 55\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                 ALAGOAS AND THE RIO SAN FRANCISCO.\r\n\r\n     The Author’s Motive for this Excursion—Voyage to the\r\n    Southward—Description of the Coast and Observations on the\r\n    great Restinga—Reaches Barra de S.

Hooker, then\r\nprofessor of that science in the University of Glasgow, aware of my\r\nwishes, strongly recommended a voyage to some part of South America; and\r\nBrazil was fixed on as the best field for my researches, as the vegetable\r\nproductions of that immense empire were then less known to the English\r\nbotanist than those perhaps of any other country of equal size in the\r\nworld. It was true that it had been visited both by German and French\r\nnaturalists, but no Englishmen, with the exception of Cunningham and\r\nBowie, and the intrepid Burchell, had penetrated into the interior; whole\r\nprovinces, particularly in the north, still lay open as virgin fields for\r\nthe investigations of some future traveller; and these I was desirous to\r\nexplore.\r\n\r\nThe preparations necessary for such an undertaking having been completed,\r\nI left Glasgow on the 14th of May, 1836, and on the 20th of the same\r\nmonth embarked at Liverpool, on board the barque Memnon, bound for Rio de\r\nJaneiro, the capital of Brazil. The voyage across the Atlantic to South\r\nAmerica has been too often described for me to say more than that we had\r\na fair share of calms and squalls, of bright skies and brilliant sunsets,\r\nof sharks and whales, flying fishes, and phosphorescent waves. A tedious,\r\nbut not unpleasant voyage, brought us in sight of land on the 22nd of\r\nJuly. When day broke, Cape Frio, as had been predicted by the captain,\r\nwas seen, bearing N.N.E., about twenty-five miles distant. This Cape is\r\nabout seventy miles to the eastward of Rio de Janeiro, and a range of\r\nhigh undulating hills stretches between them, covered to their topmost\r\nridge with trees. On their summits, numerous Palms, with their slender\r\nshafts surmounted by a ball-like mass of leaves, rising far above the\r\nother denizens of the forest, and standing boldly out in relief against\r\na beautiful blue sky, give a marked character to the scene, and silently\r\nproclaim to the European his approach to a world the vegetation of which\r\nis very different from that of the one he has so recently left. The winds\r\nwere light all day, and as we sailed close along the coast, my eye,\r\nthrough the medium of the ship’s telescope, was constantly surveying the\r\nwild but beautiful scene, and in imagination I was already revelling amid\r\nits multiform natural productions.\r\n\r\nIt was long past noon before we reached the entrance to the Bay of Rio,\r\nwhich is very remarkable for the number of conical hills and islands\r\nwhich are to be seen on both sides of it. One of these hills is the\r\nwell-known Pão d’Açucar, so called from its resemblance to a sugar-loaf.\r\nIt is a solid mass of granite, rising to the height of about one thousand\r\nfeet, and destitute of vegetation, with the exception of a few stunted\r\nshrubs on its eastern declivity. Seen from a great distance at sea, it\r\nis an admirable land-mark for ships making the port. Passing through the\r\nmagnificent portal, we came to an anchor a few miles below the city, not\r\nbeing allowed to proceed further till we were visited by the authorities.\r\nIt is quite impossible to express the feelings which arise in the mind\r\nwhile the eye surveys the beautifully varied scenery which is disclosed\r\non entering the harbour—scenery which is perhaps unequalled on the face\r\nof the earth, and on the production of which nature seems to have exerted\r\nall her energies. Since then I have visited many places celebrated for\r\ntheir beauty and their grandeur, but none of them have left a like\r\nimpression upon my mind. As far up the Bay as the eye could reach, lovely\r\nlittle verdant and palm-clad islands were to be seen rising out of its\r\ndark bosom, while the hills and lofty mountains which surround it on all\r\nsides, gilded by the rays of the setting sun, formed a befitting frame\r\nfor such a picture. At night the lights of the city had a fine effect;\r\nand when the land-breeze began to blow, the rich odour of the orange\r\nand other perfumed flowers was borne seaward along with it, and, by me,\r\nat least, enjoyed the more from having been so long shut out from the\r\ncompanionship of flowers. Ceylon has been celebrated by voyagers for\r\nits spicy odours, but I have twice made its shores with a land breeze\r\nblowing, without experiencing anything half so sweet as those which\r\ngreeted my arrival at Rio.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, the 23rd of July, I first put foot on the\r\nshores of the great continent of the new world. If the aspect of the\r\ncountry, and the nature of the vegetation were so different from those of\r\nthe old country, how much more strange were the human beings which first\r\nmet my sight on landing. The numerous small boats and canoes which ply\r\nabout in the harbour, are all manned with African blacks; the long narrow\r\nstreets through which we passed were crowded with the same race, nearly\r\nnaked, many of them sweating under their loads, and smelling so strongly\r\nas to be almost intolerable. Scarcely a white face was to be seen. The\r\nshops, in the most of which both the doors and windows are thrown open\r\nduring the day, seemed to be attended to by mulattos, or by Portuguese\r\nof nearly as dark a hue. Seen from the ship in the morning, the city had\r\na most imposing appearance, from its position, and the number of its\r\nwhite-washed churches and houses; but nearer contact with it dispelled\r\nthe illusion. The streets are narrow and dirty, and what with the stench\r\nfrom the thousands of negroes which throng them, and the effluvia from\r\nthe numerous provision shops, the first impressions are anything but\r\nagreeable. I could not help recalling to mind the lines in ‘Childe\r\nHarold,’ which Byron has applied to the capital of the mother country:—\r\n\r\n    “But whoso entereth within this town,\r\n    That, sheening far, celestial seems to be,\r\n    Disconsolate will wander up and down,\r\n    ’Mid many things unsightly to strange ee;\r\n    For hut and palace show like filthily:\r\n    The dingy citizens are reared in dirt.—”\r\n\r\nThe city of Rio occupies part of an irregular triangular tongue of\r\nland, which is situated on the west side of the Bay, about three miles\r\nnorthward from the entrance. The ground on which it stands is, for the\r\nmost part, level, but towards the north, the west, and the south-east,\r\nit is bounded by a series of hills. The long narrow streets run at\r\nright angles to each other, by which the houses are thrown into great\r\nsquare masses. The new town stretches out in a north-west direction,\r\nand is separated from the old one by a large square called the Campo de\r\nSanta Anna. Beyond it a narrow branch of the Bay runs inland, to the\r\nleft of which is the extensive suburb of Catumbi, and farther on those\r\nof Mataporco and Engenho Velho. Besides the Campo de Santa Anna there\r\nare two other large squares, one before the theatre, and another at the\r\nlanding-place, in which is situated the palace formerly occupied by the\r\nViceroys. The Royal Palace of S. Cristovão, the residence of the Emperor,\r\nis a great and irregular mass of building, situated a little way beyond\r\nthe new town.\r\n\r\nNot only are the streets narrow and dirty, but they are also badly\r\nlighted and worse paved, notwithstanding the city is immediately\r\nsurrounded by mountains of the most beautiful granite. The houses are\r\nvery substantially built, for the most part of granite, consisting\r\nprincipally of only two or three stories. It contains several fine\r\nchurches, but few of them are so situated as to be seen to advantage.\r\nThat of Nossa Senhora da Gloria is one of the most conspicuous, being\r\nplaced on a rounded hill of the same name, that juts into the sea between\r\nthe city and the Praia de Flamengo. Besides the churches there are many\r\nother public buildings, among which may be mentioned the Monastery of\r\nSan Bento, near the harbour, the Convent of Santa Thereza on the brow\r\nof a hill, beside the noble aqueduct by which the water for the supply\r\nof the city is conveyed from the mountains, a Mint, an Opera House, a\r\nTheatre, a public Library, which is said to contain about one hundred\r\nthousand volumes, a Museum of Natural History, a Medical School, two\r\nHospitals, and, what the inhabitants boast very much of, the Camara\r\ndos Senadores, which is equivalent to our House of Lords. It is a very\r\nhandsome building, which was erected a few years ago on the north side\r\nof the Campo de Santa Anna. Scattered through the city there are some\r\nfine fountains, to which water is conveyed by an aqueduct. One of them\r\nis in the palace square, for the supply of the ships in the harbour. The\r\naqueduct itself is upwards of six miles in length, and is terminated\r\ncity-wards by a magnificent row of double arches.\r\n\r\nFrom an eminence within the city, called the Castle Hill, a fine view\r\nboth of the city and bay is obtained. It also commands a delightful\r\nprospect of the country on the opposite side of the bay, with the city\r\nof Nitherohy, or Praia Grande, in the foreground, and the lofty Organ\r\nmountains towering in the distance to the left. There are many parts\r\nof the country in the immediate neighbourhood of Rio, which remind a\r\nScotchman of some of the highland scenery of his native country, but\r\nwith this difference, that, whilst there the mountains are bleak and\r\nbarren, here they are covered to their summits with a luxuriant tropical\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nThe great desire of the inhabitants seems to be to give a European air\r\nto the city. This has already been accomplished to a great extent,\r\npartly from the influx of Europeans themselves, and partly by those\r\nBrazilians who have visited Europe, either for their education or\r\notherwise. It is but seldom now that those extraordinary dresses, both\r\nof ladies and gentlemen, which we see represented in the publications\r\nof those travellers who visited Rio, even in the early part of the\r\npresent century, are to be seen in the streets. A few old women only,\r\nand those mostly coloured, are observed wearing the comb and mantilla;\r\nand the cocked hat and gold buckles are also all but extinct. Now, both\r\nladies and gentlemen dress in the height of Parisian fashion, and both\r\nare exceedingly fond of wearing jewellery. One of the finest streets in\r\nthe city is the Rua d’Ouvidor, not because it is broader, cleaner, or\r\nbetter paved than the others, but because the shops in it are principally\r\noccupied by French milliners, jewellers, tailors, booksellers,\r\nconfectioners, shoe-makers, and barbers. These shops are fitted up with\r\nan elegance which the stranger is quite unprepared to meet. Many of them\r\nare furnished with windows formed of large panes of plate glass, similar\r\nto those which are now so common in every large town in Great Britain.\r\nIndeed, it is the Regent Street of Rio, and in it almost any European\r\nluxury can be obtained.\r\n\r\nA few years ago omnibusses were started to run from the city to the\r\ndifferent suburbs. Small steamers ply regularly between Rio and the city\r\nof Nitherohy on the opposite side of the bay, and one runs daily to\r\nPiedade at the head of it. There is a yearly exhibition of the fine arts,\r\nin which are exposed many tolerable pictures, both by native and foreign\r\nartists. Music is very much cultivated, and the piano, which at the time\r\nwhen Spix and Martius visited Rio, in 1817, was only to be met with in\r\nthe richest houses, has now become almost universal. The guitar was\r\nformerly the favourite instrument, as it still is all over the interior.\r\nThere are excellent schools for the education of boys; and boarding\r\nschools have been established for young ladies, which are conducted on\r\nthe same principles as those of a similar nature in England. Being the\r\ncapital of the empire, and there being residents at the court from most\r\nof the European nations, Rio is the scene of much greater gaiety than\r\nis generally supposed by those who have never visited it. But as all\r\nthese matters have been more learnedly “discoursed of” than I profess to\r\nbe able to do, I shall pass over in silence the levees, the opera, the\r\ntheatres, whether French or Portuguese, and the balls, public as well as\r\nprivate, which engross quite as much of the attention of the fashionable\r\nworld here as elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOf the many European merchants established here, who for the most part\r\nare English, few reside in the city, most of them having country houses\r\nin the suburbs. One of the most fashionable resorts is a lovely spot\r\nabout two miles out, called Botafogo. There the houses are built along\r\nthe semicircular shore of a quiet bay, which is nearly surrounded by\r\nhigh hills. Immediately behind the houses, and almost overhanging them,\r\nstands a very remarkable mountain called the Corcovado, which rises to\r\nupwards of two thousand feet above the level of the sea, about two-thirds\r\nof its eastern face being a perpendicular precipice. Many other European\r\nresidences are situated in Catete and on the Praia de Flamengo, between\r\nBotafogo and the city; and in the Larenjeiras valley, which stretches up\r\nfrom Catete towards the mountains; others exist at the opposite extremity\r\nof the city, in the district of Engenho Velho.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing wanting in the neighbourhood of Rio which no large\r\ncity should be without—a public drive. This, I find in India, is a point\r\nparticularly attended to, whenever, even a few, Europeans are located\r\ntogether. At Rio, those who wish to take a morning or an evening drive,\r\ncan only do so on the public roads, which are only fit for carriages to\r\nrun on for a few miles out of the city. There is, indeed, quite close\r\nto it what is called the Passeio Publico, a large garden with shady\r\nwalks, but it is only intended for those who walk. Of an evening, when\r\nthe weather is fine, it is much frequented by the citizens. The Botanic\r\nGarden, which is about eight miles distant from the city, is a place of\r\ngreat resort.\r\n\r\nOn landing, I took up my residence at an Italian hotel, in one of the\r\nprincipal streets, but as this was not a place fitted to my pursuits, as\r\nsoon as all my luggage was landed, I removed to the boarding-house of an\r\nold English lady, who had then been about thirty years in the country.\r\nIt was about three or four miles from the city, situated in a beautiful\r\nvalley which stretches from the suburb of Engenho Velho towards the\r\nCorcovado mountain, and called Rio Comprido, from a small stream so named\r\nwhich runs through it. Here I had my head-quarters for about five months,\r\nand during that period my excursions extended in all directions round the\r\ncity. Frequent visits were made to the mountains, which are all covered\r\nwith dense virgin forests—to the humid valleys—to the swampy tracts which\r\nlie to the north of the city—to the sea-shores—and to the islands in the\r\nbay. From these rambles there resulted a rich botanical harvest, besides\r\nnumerous specimens belonging to other branches of natural history. But as\r\nan eternal spring and summer reign in this happy climate, and as almost\r\nevery plant has its own season for the production of its flowers, every\r\nmonth is characterized by a different flora. It is, then, scarcely to be\r\nexpected that a residence of but a few months can afford more than a very\r\npartial knowledge of its vegetable riches.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the country around Rio is essentially granitic, all the\r\nrocks being of that nature to which the name of Gneiss-granite has been\r\napplied, from their possessing decided marks of stratification. The\r\nmountains generally run in chains having no particular direction, and are\r\nof all sizes, from slight eminences to mountains which rise from 2,000 to\r\n3,000 feet above the level of the sea. The loftier of these mountains,\r\nsuch as the Peak of Tejuca, the Corcovado, and the Gavea, have their\r\nsouth-east sides bare and precipitous, while those to the northward have\r\na gradual ascent, and are wooded to their summit. Notwithstanding the\r\nenormous length of time which the sides of these mountains have been\r\ncovered with their mighty forests, the alluvial layer of soil which rests\r\non them is very thin. This, however, may be accounted for by the heavy\r\nrains washing it, as well as the materials from which it is formed, down\r\ninto the valleys, where the alluvium is often found to be many feet\r\ndeep. Hence it is that the deep valleys which intersect the mountain\r\nranges are the principal seats of agricultural industry; and some of\r\nthem, particularly in the vicinity of the city, are thickly studded with\r\nhabitations, surrounded with plantations of Coffee, Oranges, Bananas,\r\nand Mandioca. Many of the lower hills near the city are now also cleared\r\nand planted with Coffee, but the plantations were too young when I\r\nleft to form any idea of their success at so low a level. Beneath the\r\nalluvium there is a bed of reddish-coloured clay, which is very tenacious\r\nwhen wet. It is often from thirty to forty feet in thickness, and is\r\nnot peculiar to the province, as I have met with it in every part of\r\nBrazil where I have travelled. It frequently contains numerous boulders,\r\nconsisting of rounded, as well as angular, fragments of Gneiss, Granite,\r\nand Quartz, and is often inter-stratified with various beds of sand\r\nand gravel. It is obvious then from these observations, that the soil\r\naround Rio itself is not generally rich. Indeed, the first thing which\r\nstrikes a stranger on his arrival, is the apparent poverty of the soil\r\ncontrasted with the richness of the vegetation. But for the humidity of\r\nthe atmosphere, the heavy dews of the dry season, and the rains of the\r\nwet, combined with the heat of a tropical sun, the greater part of the\r\ncountry immediately surrounding Rio would not be worthy of cultivation.\r\nThe very small quantity of soil which suffices for some plants is\r\nquite astonishing to a European. Rocks, on which scarcely a trace of\r\nearth is to be observed, are covered with _Vellozias_, _Tillandsias_,\r\n_Melastomaceæ_, _Cacti_, _Orchideæ_, and _Ferns_, and all in the vigour\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Rio has been very much modified by the clearing away of\r\nthe forests in the neighbourhood. Previous to this, the seasons could\r\nscarcely be divided into wet and dry as they are at present. Then rains\r\nfell nearly all the year round, and thunder-storms were not only more\r\nfrequent, but more violent. So much has the moisture been reduced, that\r\nthe supply of water for the city has been considerably diminished, and\r\nthe government has, in consequence, forbidden the further destruction of\r\nthe forests on the Corcovado range, towards the sources of the aqueduct.\r\nDuring the months of May, June, July, August, and September, the climate\r\nis usually delightful, being the dry as well as the cool season. The mean\r\ntemperature of the year is 72°. Although frequent showers fall during the\r\ndry season, yet they are not to be compared with the continued rains of\r\nthe other, which generally commence in October. The rainy season sets in\r\nwith heavy thunder-storms, which are of most frequent occurrence in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nThe population of Rio consists principally of Portuguese and their\r\ndescendants, both white and coloured; those only born in the country are\r\nstyled Brazilians; and ever since its independence as an empire in 1820,\r\na very bad feeling has existed between them and those who are natives of\r\nPortugal. But this feeling is less common among the higher than the lower\r\norders, and is, perhaps, more strongly marked in the inner provinces than\r\non the coast. Wherever any riot, or any attempt to revolt takes place\r\nin the interior—and such occurrences are now, unfortunately, but too\r\ncommon—the poor Portuguese are the first to fall victims, being butchered\r\nwithout mercy, and robbed of all they possess. Notwithstanding the ill\r\nusage they receive, hundreds of them arrive yearly to push their fortune\r\nin the country, which, at one time, formed the richest gem in the crown\r\nof Portugal. Many of those who call themselves white in Brazil, scarcely\r\ndeserve the title, as few of those families who have been long in the\r\ncountry, have preserved the purity of the original stock. The inhabitants\r\nof Rio are in general short and slightly made, and form a great contrast\r\nto the tall and handsome inhabitants of the Provinces of San Paulo and\r\nMinas Geräes, and even those of several of the northern provinces. The\r\nBrazilian wherever he is met with is always polite, and but very seldom\r\ninhospitable, especially in the less frequented parts of the country. He\r\nis much more temperate in his drinking than in his eating, and much more\r\naddicted to snuff-taking as well as to smoking: hence the prevalence of\r\ndyspeptic and nervous complaints among them. Marriage is less common in\r\nBrazil than in Europe, a fact which accounts for the greater laxity of\r\nmorals which exists here among both sexes. The women are generally short,\r\nand when young are pretty agreeable, but as they increase in years\r\nthey mostly get very corpulent, from their living well and taking but\r\nlittle exercise. In Rio and the other large towns, they always make their\r\nappearance when strangers call, but such is not the case in most parts\r\nof the interior; there they still remain shy, but with an abundance of\r\ncuriosity. I have lived for a week at a time in houses where I was well\r\naware there were ladies, without ever seeing more of them than their dark\r\neyes peering through the chinks about the doors of the inner apartments.\r\nIn the distant province of Goyaz, Matto-Grosso, and Piauhy, nearly all\r\nclasses of them are as much addicted to the use of the pipe as the men.\r\nIt is but very seldom that native Indians are to be seen in Rio; I was\r\nseveral months in the country before I saw one. The brown boatmen, in the\r\nharbour, who have been taken for Indians, are, as Spix and Martius have\r\nalready observed, mulattoes of various shades of colour.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written on slavery as it exists in Brazil. It is a subject\r\nof great importance, and demands a much greater amount of observation\r\nthan has generally occurred to those who have written on it at greatest\r\nlength. Those have mostly been voyagers, _en passant_, who have derived\r\ntheir knowledge from others, and not from personal observation. The most\r\nridiculous stories are told by the European residents to strangers on\r\ntheir arrival, as I well know from personal experience. One of the more\r\nrecent works on Brazil, which on its appearance was the most accredited\r\nin Europe, is, perhaps, the least to be depended on. I have good\r\nauthority for stating that the author noted down every statement that was\r\nmade to him, however extraordinary, without the slightest examination as\r\nto its truth. More than one individual has informed me, that at dinner\r\nparties, they have heard persons present, who were more famed for their\r\nwit than their veracity, cramming him with information about Brazil,\r\nwhich, in truth, was worse than no information at all; but everything\r\nseemed to be acceptable, and was immediately entered in his note-book.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1825, Humboldt estimated the entire population of Brazil at\r\nabout 4,000,000; of this number he calculated that 920,000 were whites,\r\n1,960,000 negroes, and 1,120,000 mixed races and native Indians. Here\r\nthe proportion of the coloured races to the white is about three to\r\none. Later estimates give an entire population of 5,000,000; and the\r\nproportion of the coloured race to the whites stands as four to one. It\r\nwas supposed at the time when the law was passed to render illegal the\r\nintroduction of new slaves, that the proportional number would speedily\r\ndecline. Had this law been strictly observed, such would, no doubt,\r\nhave been the case, as it is well known that the number of births falls\r\nfar short of the deaths among the slave population in Brazil. This does\r\nnot arise from their ill usage, as some writers have supposed, but from\r\nthe well-known fact that a greater proportion of males than of females\r\nhas at all times been introduced to the country. On some estates in the\r\ninterior the proportion of females to males is often as low as one to\r\nten. In the Diamond District, in particular, females are very scarce.\r\nThe law, however, has not been attended to, and the consequence of\r\nincessant introduction is, that the number of slaves in the country has\r\nnot declined. During the five years which I spent in Brazil, I have good\r\nreason for believing that the supply was always nearly equal to the\r\ndemand, even in the most distant parts of the empire.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the vigilance of the cruisers both on the coast of Brazil\r\nand that of Africa, it was well known to every one in Rio, that cargoes\r\nof slaves were regularly landed even within a few miles of the city;\r\nand during several voyages which I have made in canoes and other small\r\ncraft along the shores of the northern provinces, I have repeatedly\r\nseen cargoes of from one to three hundred slaves landed, and have heard\r\nof others. There are many favourite landing-places between Bahia and\r\nPernambuco, particularly near the mouth of the Rio San Francisco. Again\r\nand again, while travelling in the interior, I have seen troops of new\r\nslaves of both sexes, who could not speak a single word of Portuguese,\r\nvarying from twenty to one hundred individuals, marched inland for sale,\r\nor already belonging to proprietors of plantations. These bands are\r\nalways under the escort of armed men, and those who have already been\r\nbought, are not unfrequently made to carry a small load, usually of\r\nagricultural implements. There is no secrecy made of their movements,\r\nnay, magistrates themselves are very often the purchasers of them. It is\r\nlikewise well known that the magistrates of those districts where slaves\r\nare landed, receive a certain per-centage on them as a bribe to secrecy.\r\nThe high price which they bring in the market, is a very great temptation\r\nto incur the risk of importing them. It is said that if only one cargo be\r\nsaved out of three, that one will cover the whole expenses, and leave a\r\nhandsome profit besides.\r\n\r\nPrevious to my arrival in Brazil, I had been led to believe, from the\r\nreports that have been published in England, that the condition of the\r\nslave in that country was the most wretched that could be conceived; and\r\nthe accounts which I heard when I landed—from individuals whom I now find\r\nto have been little informed on the point—tended to confirm that belief.\r\nA few years’ residence in the country, during which I saw more than has\r\nfallen to the lot of most Europeans, has led me to alter very materially\r\nthose early impressions. I am no advocate for the continuance of slavery;\r\non the contrary, I should rejoice to see it swept from off the face of\r\nthe earth—but I will never listen to those who represent the Brazilian\r\nslave-holder to be a cruel monster. My experience among them has been\r\nvery great, and but very few wanton acts of cruelty have come under my\r\nown observation. The very temperament of the Brazilian is adverse to its\r\ngeneral occurrence. They are of a slow and indolent habit, which causes\r\nmuch to be overlooked in a slave, that by people of a more active and\r\nardent disposition, would be severely punished. Europeans, who have this\r\nlatter peculiarity more strongly inherent in them, are known to be not\r\nonly the hardest of task-masters, but the most severe punishers of the\r\nfaults of their slaves.\r\n\r\nIn Brazil, as in all other countries, there is more crime in large\r\ntowns than in the agricultural districts. This arises from the greater\r\nfacilities which exist in the former for obtaining ardent spirits; yet,\r\namong the black population, intoxication is not often observed, even\r\ndense as it is in Rio de Janeiro. It was on a Sunday morning that I\r\narrived in Liverpool from Brazil, and during the course of that day I\r\nsaw in the streets a greater number of cases of intoxication, than, I\r\nbelieve, I observed altogether among Brazilians, whether black or white,\r\nduring the whole period of my residence in the country. In the large\r\ntowns the necessity for punishment is of frequent occurrence. The master\r\nhas it in his own power to chastise his slaves at his own discretion.\r\nSome, however, prefer sending the culprit to the Calabouça, where, on\r\nthe payment of a small sum, punishment is given by the police. Many\r\nof the crimes for which only a few lashes are awarded, are of such a\r\nnature that in England would bring upon the perpetrator either death or\r\ntransportation. It is only for very serious crimes that a slave is given\r\nup entirely to the public tribunals, as then his services are lost to the\r\nowner, either altogether, or at least for a long period.\r\n\r\nOn most of the plantations the slaves are well attended to, and appear to\r\nbe very happy. Indeed, it is a characteristic of the negro, resulting no\r\ndoubt from his careless disposition, that he very soon gets reconciled to\r\nhis condition. I have conversed with slaves in all parts of the country,\r\nand have met with but very few who expressed any regret at having been\r\ntaken from their own country, or a desire to return to it. On some of the\r\nlarge estates at which I have resided for short periods, the number of\r\nslaves often amounted to three or four hundred, and but for my previous\r\nknowledge of their being such, I could never have found out from my\r\nown observations that they were slaves. I saw a set of contented and\r\nwell-conditioned labourers turning out from their little huts, often\r\nsurrounded by a small garden, and proceeding to their respective daily\r\noccupations, from which they returned in the evening, but not broken and\r\nbent down with the severity of their tasks. The condition of the domestic\r\nslave is, perhaps, even better than that of the others; his labour is\r\nbut light, and he is certainly better fed and clothed. I have almost\r\nuniversally found the Brazilian ladies kind both to their male and female\r\ndomestic slaves; this is particularly the case when the latter have acted\r\nas nurses. On estates, where there has been no medical attendant, I have\r\noften found the lady of the proprietor attending to the sick in the\r\nhospital herself.\r\n\r\nSlaves, however, are variously inclined; from the very nature of a\r\nnegro—his well-ascertained deficient intellectual capacity—the want of\r\nall education—the knowledge of his position in society, and the almost\r\ncertainty of his never being able to raise himself above it—we need not\r\nwonder that there should be among them some who are restless, impatient\r\nof all control, and addicted to every vice. It is the frequent necessity\r\nwhich arises for the punishment of the evil-disposed, that has led to\r\nthe supposition of the indiscriminate and universal use of the lash. If\r\nthe intellectual capacity of the negro be contrasted with the native\r\nIndian, it will not be difficult, on most points, to decide in favour of\r\nthe latter. It is no small proof of the deficient mental endowment of\r\nthe negro, that even in remote parts of the empire, three or four white\r\nmen can keep as many as two or three hundred of them in the most perfect\r\nstate of submission. With the Indian this could never be accomplished,\r\nfor they too once were allowed to be held as slaves, and even still are,\r\non the northern and western frontier, although contrary to law. The\r\nIndian has the animal propensities less fully developed than the negro;\r\nhence he is more gentle in his disposition, but at the same time, is much\r\nmore impatient of restraint.\r\n\r\nThe character and capacity of the negro vary very much in the different\r\nnations. Those from the northern parts of Africa are by far the finest\r\nraces. The slaves of Bahia are more difficult to manage than those of any\r\nother part of Brazil, and more frequent attempts at revolt have taken\r\nplace there than elsewhere. The cause of this is obvious. Nearly the\r\nwhole of the slave population of that place is from the Gold Coast. Both\r\nthe men and the women are not only taller and more handsomely formed than\r\nthose from Mozambique, Benguela, and the other parts of Africa, but have\r\na much greater share of mental energy, arising, perhaps, from their near\r\nrelationship to the Moor and the Arab. Among them there are many who both\r\nread and write Arabic. They are more united among themselves than the\r\nother nations, and hence are less liable to have their secrets divulged\r\nwhen they aim at a revolt.\r\n\r\nTo sum up these observations, I have had ample opportunity, since I\r\nleft South America, for contrasting the condition of the slave of that\r\ncountry with that of the coolie in the Mauritius and in India, but more\r\nparticularly in Ceylon; and were I asked to which I would give the\r\npreference, I should certainly decide in favour of the former, although,\r\nat the same time I could not but exclaim with Sterne, “still, Slavery!\r\nstill thou art a bitter draught!”\r\n\r\nA general rise of the black population is much dreaded in Brazil, which\r\nis not unreasonable, when the great proportion it bears to the white is\r\ntaken into consideration. Were they all united by one common sympathy,\r\nthis would have happened long ago, but the hostile prejudices existing\r\namong the different races of Africans, have hitherto prevented it. In\r\nthe northern and interior provinces, considerable encouragement to their\r\ninsubordination has been offered, by the general feeling that animates\r\na large proportion of the free class, who are mostly of mixed blood,\r\nand who desire to throw off the yoke of monarchy and replace it by a\r\nrepublican form of government, a feeling which I know to be general, not\r\nonly among the lower orders, but among the magistrates, priests, officers\r\nin the army, and owners of landed property, and hence I believe the time\r\nis not far distant, when Brazil will share the fate of the other South\r\nAmerican states. In such an event the white population will be sure to\r\nsuffer from the savage rapacity of the mixed races, especially those who\r\nhave African blood in them: for it is to be remarked, that the worst\r\nof criminals spring from this class, who inherit in some degree the\r\nsuperior intellect of the white, while they retain much of the cunning\r\nand ferocity of the black; they are mostly free, and bear no good will\r\ntowards the whites, who form the smaller part of the entire population.\r\nIt should be observed, however, that in the class of wealthier landed\r\nproprietors and commercial men, who have received the benefits of\r\na more liberal education, especially those nearer the capital, and\r\nthose belonging to the provinces along the coast, this tide of public\r\nopinion, that at one time nearly threatened the ruin of the empire,\r\nhas been in a great measure arrested, and many of those who formerly\r\nadvocated republican principles, are now the staunchest supporters of the\r\nconstitutional monarchy, convinced of its being the strongest guarantee\r\nthey can have for the security of their lives and property, and the\r\ndevelopement of the industry and resources of the empire.\r\n\r\nIn Brazil the mixed races receive different names from those in the\r\nSpanish territories. The offspring of Europeans and negroes are called\r\n_Mulattos_; those of Europeans and native Indians, _Mamelucos_; those\r\nof the negro and Indian, _Caboclos_; while those which spring from the\r\nmulatto and negro are called _Cabras_; the term _Creole_ is applied to\r\nthe offspring of the negroes.\r\n\r\nI considered myself fortunate, shortly after my arrival at Rio, to make\r\nthe acquaintance, and gain the friendship, of a family that had already\r\ntravelled in distant parts of South America. It is only he who, day after\r\nday, is pursuing his solitary rambles through the dark forests, in the\r\nshady glens, on the mountain summits, or by the surf-beaten shores of\r\nsuch a country as Brazil, where all is new, and all is strange, who can\r\nfully estimate the privilege of being received with welcome into a family\r\nwhose leisure hours are devoted to pursuits similar to his own. Many of\r\nmy excursions in the vicinity of Rio, were undertaken in company with\r\nthese friends, and to their local knowledge of the country I owe some\r\nof my finest botanical acquisitions. To them, as well as to most of the\r\nEnglish residents at Rio, I am indebted for many attentions during the\r\ndifferent periods of my residence in that neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nIn order to present some general idea of the splendid scenery of the\r\ncountry, and the leading features of this part of Brazil, I will give an\r\naccount of some of these excursions. There is a path by the side of the\r\ngreat aqueduct which has always been the favourite resort of naturalists\r\nwho have visited Rio; and there is certainly no walk near the city so\r\nfruitful either in insects or plants. The following notes were made on\r\nthe return from my first visit along the whole length of the aqueduct.\r\nAfter reaching the head of the Laranjeiras valley, which is about two\r\nmiles in extent, the ascent becomes rather steep. At this time it was\r\nabout nine A.M., and the rays of the sun, proceeding from a cloudless\r\nsky, were very powerful; but a short distance brought us within the\r\ncool shade of the dense forest which skirts the sides of the Corcovado,\r\nand through which our path lay. In the valley we saw some very large\r\ntrees of a thorny-stemmed _Bombax_, but they were then destitute both of\r\nleaves and flowers, nearly all the trees of this tribe being deciduous.\r\nThere we also passed under the shade of a very large solitary tree which\r\noverhangs the road, and is well known by the name of the Pao Grande. It\r\nis the _Jequetibá_ of the Brazilians, and the _Couratari legalis_ of\r\nMartius. Considerably further up, and on the banks of a small stream that\r\ndescends from the mountain, we found several curious _Dorstenias_, and\r\nmany delicate species of Ferns. We also added here to our collections\r\nfine specimens of the Tree-fern (_Trichopteris excelsa_), which was the\r\nfirst of the kind I had yet seen. The forests here exhibited all the\r\ncharacteristics of tropical vegetation. The rich black soil, which has\r\nbeen forming for centuries in the broad ravines from the decay of leaves,\r\n&c., is covered with herbaceous ferns, _Dorstenias_, _Heliconias_,\r\n_Begonias_, and other plants which love shade and humidity; while above\r\nthese rise the tall and graceful Tree-ferns, and the noble Palms, the\r\nlarge leaves of which tremble in the slightest breeze. But it is the\r\ngigantic forest trees themselves which produce the strongest impression\r\non the mind of a stranger. How I felt the truth of the observation of\r\nHumboldt, that, when a traveller newly arrived from Europe penetrates for\r\nthe first time into the forests of South America, nature presents itself\r\nto him under such an unexpected aspect, that he can scarcely distinguish\r\nwhat most excites his admiration, the deep silence of those solitudes,\r\nthe individual beauty and contrast of forms, or that vigour and freshness\r\nof vegetable life which characterize the climate of the tropics.[1] What\r\nfirst claims attention is the great size of the trees, their thickness,\r\nand the height to which they rear their unbranched stems. Then, in place\r\nof the few mosses and lichens which cover the trunks and boughs of the\r\nforest trees of temperate climes, here they are bearded from the roots to\r\nthe very extremities of the smallest branches, with Ferns, _Aroideæ_,\r\n_Tillandsias_, _Cacti_, _Orchideæ_, _Gesnereæ_, and other epiphytous\r\nplants. Besides these, many of the larger trunks are encircled with the\r\ntwining stems of _Bignonias_, and shrubs of similar habit, the branches\r\nof which frequently become thick, and compress the tree so much, that it\r\nperishes in the too close embrace. Those climbers, again, which merely\r\nascend the trunk, supporting themselves by their numerous small roots,\r\noften become detached after reaching the boughs, and, where many of them\r\nexist, the stem presents the aspect of a large mast supported by its\r\nstays. These rope-like twiners and creeping plants, passing from tree to\r\ntree, descending from the branches to the ground, and ascending again to\r\nother boughs, intermingle themselves in a thousand ways, and render a\r\npassage through such parts of the forest both difficult and annoying.\r\n\r\nHaving reached, by mid-day, the level on which the water of the aqueduct\r\nis brought from its source, we continued our walk along it for upwards\r\nof two miles. Our progress, however, was slow, from the number of new\r\nobjects continually claiming our attention. In damp shady spots by\r\nthe side of the aqueduct we found the common water-cress (_Nasturtium\r\nofficinale_) of Europe, which is one of the few plants that are truly\r\ncosmopolite; and on the rocks grew some little European mosses, which,\r\nbeing old acquaintances, recalled pleasing thoughts of home. Numerous\r\nferns, and many strange-leaved _Begonias_ grew along the side of the\r\nlittle stream. While collecting specimens of a moss, I had a providential\r\nescape from a poisonous snake: I caught it in my hand along with a\r\nhandful of the moss, which was soon dropped when I perceived what\r\naccompanied it. Venomous snakes are not uncommon in the province of Rio\r\nde Janeiro; but accidents do not so often result from them as might be\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\nAbout seven o’clock P.M., we regained the spot where we had left the\r\nservants, the horses, and the materials for our dinner; and by the time\r\nwe had partaken of this repast, darkness had already set in. As the road\r\nis by no means of easy descent, even by day, we should not have thought\r\nof remaining so long, had we not been certain of moonlight. During the\r\nhalf hour we delayed for the rising of the moon, we listened to the\r\nsounds produced by the various animals which are in a state of activity\r\nat this hour of the evening. Pre-eminent above all the others, is that\r\nemitted by the blacksmith frog; every sound which he produces ringing in\r\nthe ear like the clang of a hammer upon an anvil, while the tones uttered\r\nby his congeners strikingly resemble the lowing of cattle at a distance.\r\nBesides these, the hooting of an owl, the shrill song of the cicada, and\r\nthe chirping of grasshoppers, formed a continued concert of inharmonious\r\ntones; while the air was lighted up by the fitful flashes of numerous\r\nfire-flies.\r\n\r\nWhen the moon rose we continued our journey, but the lowering clouds,\r\ntogether with the dark shade of the overhanging trees, prevented our\r\nderiving much advantage from its light. When we emerged from the forest\r\nand gained a glimpse of the horizon, everything betokened an approaching\r\nstorm. Towards the north lay a mass of the darkest clouds, whence\r\nstreamed, from time to time, sheets of the most brilliant lightning. This\r\ncontinued till we reached home, shortly after ten o’clock, and we were\r\nscarcely seated when the storm broke forth in all its fury, accompanied\r\nwith a deluge of rain.\r\n\r\nFrom various parts of the watercourse fine views of the low country\r\nare obtained. The finest, perhaps, is that which discloses the Lake of\r\nRodrigo Freitas. We looked, as it were, through a large portal; on the\r\nleft is the Corcovado, covered with a dense forest of various tinted\r\nfoliage, and on the right, the nearly perpendicular face of another\r\nmountain, covered with a few _Cacti_ and other succulent plants, but\r\nrichly wooded towards the summit. From this point there runs a large wide\r\nvalley, at the bottom of which lies the Botanic Garden, and still further\r\non, the lake. On the flat grounds by the shores of the lake are a number\r\nof cottages, surrounded by cultivated fields. Immediately beyond these is\r\nthe sea-shore, with its broad belt of white sand on which a heavy surf\r\nis always breaking. All beyond, with the exception of a small island or\r\ntwo to the left is the great Southern Atlantic Ocean, bounded by the blue\r\nsky. In the course of our walk we often sat down to rest ourselves, and\r\nto enjoy, in the silence and repose which surrounded us, the romantic\r\nprospects which were constantly presenting themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Corcovado mountain offers a rich field to the botanist. I frequently\r\nvisited the lower portions, but only once ascended to the summit.\r\nThe ascent is from the N.W. side, and although rather steep in some\r\nplaces, may be ridden on horseback all the way up. Some of the trees\r\non the lower parts of it are very large. The thick underwood consists\r\nof _Palms_, _Melastomaceæ_, _Myrtaceæ_, _Tree-ferns_, _Crotons_, &c.;\r\nand beneath these are many delicate herbaceous ferns, _Dorstenias_,\r\n_Heliconias_, and, in the more open places, a few large grasses. Towards\r\nthe summit the trees are of much smaller growth, and shrubs belonging\r\nto the genus _Croton_ are abundant, as well as a small kind of bamboo.\r\nThe summit itself is a large mass of very coarse-grained granite. In\r\nthe clefts of the rocks grow a few small kinds of Orchideous plants,\r\nand a beautiful tuberous-rooted scarlet-flowered _Gesneria_. From\r\nthis point a magnificent panoramic view of the bay, the city, and the\r\nsurrounding country is obtained. The temperature at this elevation is\r\nso much reduced, that it is not difficult to fancy one’s self suddenly\r\ntransported to a higher latitude. A strong breeze was blowing, and just\r\nbefore leaving, the top of the mountain became enveloped in one of those\r\ndark clouds which so frequently hang over it towards the beginning of the\r\nrainy season.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting journey made during my stay at Rio, was to the\r\nTijuca mountains, whither I was accompanied by a friend, and where we\r\nremained ten days. Instead of the direct road from Rio, we preferred\r\nthe worst and more circuitous one which leads along the shore. Near the\r\nsea, and about fifteen miles distant from the city, rises the Gavea, or\r\nTopsail Mountain, so called from its square shape, and well known to\r\nEnglish sailors by the name, of Lord Hood’s Nose. It has a flat top, and\r\nrises about two thousand feet above the level of the sea, to which it\r\npresents a nearly perpendicular precipitous face. We remained a night\r\nat the house of a Frenchman, who possessed a small coffee estate. The\r\ncoffee is planted on the rocky sloping ground which lies between the\r\nbase of the mountain and the sea. The situation is cool, and possesses\r\na moist climate. Among the loose rocks at the foot of the mountain we\r\nmade a fine collection of beautiful land-shells, and on the rocks by the\r\nsea-shore, we found the beautiful _Gloxinia speciosa_, which is now so\r\ncommon in the hot-houses of England, growing in the greatest profusion,\r\nand covered with flowers. Along with it grows a kind of wild Parsley,\r\nand twining among the bushes, a new kind of Indian cress (_Tropæolum\r\northoceras_, Gardn.). On the face of the mountain, at an elevation of\r\nseveral hundred feet, we observed some large patches of one of those\r\nbeautiful large-flowered Orchideous plants which are so common in Brazil.\r\nIts large rose-coloured flowers were very conspicuous, but we could not\r\nreach them. A few days afterwards we found it on a neighbouring mountain,\r\nand ascertained it to be _Cattleya labiata_. Those on the Gavea will long\r\ncontinue to vegetate, far from the reach of the greedy collector.\r\n\r\nThe road, after winding round the Gavea, terminates at a small salt water\r\nlake, which passengers, who follow this route, are obliged to cross, or\r\nrather to pass from one end to the other, in consequence of the flank\r\nof a high hill which runs into it, and prevents a passage along its\r\nmargin. We passed the lake in a rotten leaky canoe, and saw on the face\r\nof the steep rocks many curious plants which we could not reach. The\r\npath which led to the house where we were to take up our quarters, lay\r\nfor about two miles through a flat meadow-land, partly in its original\r\nstate, and partly planted with Indian corn, Mandiocca, and Bananas. We\r\npassed many small habitations belonging to poor people of colour, mostly\r\nfishermen. Before reaching the foot of the mountain over which the road\r\nleads to Tijuca, we passed a migrating body of small black ants. The\r\nimmense number of individuals comprising it may be imagined from the\r\nfact, that the column was more than six feet broad, and extended in\r\nlength to upwards of thirty yards. The ground was completely covered\r\nwith the little creatures, so closely were they packed together. The\r\nnatural history of ants has as yet been but little studied, particularly\r\nwith regard to the enumeration of species. They are more numerous than\r\nnaturalists are aware of. In those parts within the tropics where\r\nhumidity prevails, they are neither so varied in species, nor so abundant\r\nin individuals, as in drier districts. While residing at Pernambuco, I\r\nremember taking notice of all the species I met with in the course of a\r\nsingle day, and they amounted to about twenty-five.\r\n\r\nBefore ascending the hill we visited the falls of Tijuca, which are only\r\nat a short distance from the road. The crystal water of a large rivulet\r\nfalls over two successive gently inclined masses of rock, upwards of one\r\nhundred feet high. It rather glides in a broad broken sheet than falls,\r\nand is received in a large pool below. This cascade reminded me of those\r\nwhich are so often to be met with in the wooded glens of Scotland. By\r\ndusk, after gradually ascending the mountains, we reached the house;\r\nit is situated in an old coffee plantation, belonging to a Brazilian\r\nnobleman, but it was then rented by a party of young English merchants\r\nin Rio, who used it as a holiday resort, and, by the kindness of one of\r\nthem, we were allowed to remain at it for a few days.\r\n\r\nEarly on the following morning we made an excursion to a mountain called\r\nthe Pedra Bonita, immediately opposite the Gavea. In our way thither we\r\nvisited the coffee plantations of Mrs. Moke, and Mr. Lescene. They adjoin\r\neach other, and were then considered the best managed near Rio. The great\r\ncoffee country is much farther inland, on the banks of the Rio Parahiba.\r\nThe trees are planted from six to eight feet apart. Those plants which\r\nhave been taken from the nursery with balls of mould round their root are\r\nfound to bear fruit in about two years, whereas those which have been\r\ndetached from the earth do not produce till the third year, and a greater\r\nproportion of the plants die. They are planted when about a foot high,\r\non the slopes of the hills, in the alluvial soil from whence the virgin\r\nforest has been cleared. They are only allowed to grow to the height of\r\nfrom ten to twelve feet, so that the crop may lie within reach. Till the\r\ntrees are in full bearing, one negro can take charge of, and keep clean,\r\ntwo thousand plants: but afterwards only half that number is allotted\r\nhim. Large healthy coffee trees have been found to produce as much as\r\nfrom eight to twelve pounds of coffee; the average produce, however,\r\nvaries from a pound and a half to three pounds. When the berry is ripe,\r\nit is about the size and colour of a cherry; and of these berries a\r\nnegro can collect about thirty-two pounds daily. In the course of the\r\nyear there are three gatherings, but the greater part of the crop ripens\r\nduring the dry season. The berries are spread out to dry in the sun,\r\non large slightly convex floors; the dry shell is afterwards removed,\r\neither by mills, or by a series of large wooden mortars. It is only in\r\nsome few estates in Brazil that the pulper is seen, which is so commonly\r\nused in the West Indies and Ceylon, for taking off the pulp from the\r\nfresh berries. Nothing is more beautiful than a coffee plantation in full\r\nbloom; the trees come into flower at the same time, but the blossoms do\r\nnot last more than twenty-four hours. Seen from a distance the plantation\r\nseems covered with snow; and the flowers have a most delightful fragrance.\r\n\r\nBy the side of a stream which flows through the valley where these\r\nplantations are, we noticed a nettle-like tree, with a stem eight inches\r\nin diameter, and nearly twenty feet high, which proved to be a new\r\nspecies of _Bæhmeria_ (_B. arborescens_, Gardn.). For a considerable\r\nway our ascending path was bordered with bitter orange trees, the shade\r\nafforded by which was no less acceptable than their fruit was grateful;\r\nfor the juice though a little bitter is not disagreeably so. Both here,\r\nand in many other parts about Rio, this bitter kind of orange grows\r\napparently wild; it is called the wild orange by the Brazilians (_Laranja\r\nda Terra_), but it is certainly not indigenous. Thence, we came to a\r\ntract where the original forest having been felled, was replaced by a\r\nthick wood of young trees, consisting chiefly of arborescent _Solanums_,\r\n_Crotons_, _Vernonias_, &c., while great numbers of _Cecropia peltata_\r\nand _palmata_ reared their heads above the rest, conspicuous at a great\r\ndistance from their white bark, their large lobed leaves, the snowy\r\nunder-surface of which, when agitated by the wind, gives the tree the\r\nappearance of being covered with large white blossoms.\r\n\r\nNear the summit of the Pedra Bonita, there is a small Fazenda, or farm,\r\nthe proprietor of which was then clearing away the forest which covers\r\nit, converting the larger trees into charcoal. From the massive trunks\r\nof some of them which had just been felled, we obtained some very pretty\r\nOrchideous plants, and several of the larger denizens of the forest,\r\nfound to belong to the natural orders _Melastomaceæ_, _Myrtaceæ_,\r\n_Compositæ_, and _Leguminosæ_. The ascent of the Pedra Bonita is made\r\nfrom the north side. Immediately on emerging from the forest, and\r\nattaining the summit, a most magnificent view of the surrounding country\r\npresented itself. It was then nearly sunset, so we had but little time\r\nfor botanizing. We only saw enough to convince us that the vegetation\r\nof the top of this mountain had a very different character from those\r\nof any others we had visited near Rio: resembling more, as I have since\r\nascertained, that of the mountains of the interior. A few days afterwards\r\nwe made another journey to it, but on this occasion the whole mountain\r\nwas enveloped in clouds, the minute globules of which they were composed\r\nbeing distinctly visible, as they swept past under the influence of a\r\nstrong breeze which was blowing from the north. A great part of the top\r\nwe found to be covered with the beautiful lily-like _Vellozia candida_,\r\non the branches of which grew a pretty _Epidendrum_, with rose-coloured\r\nflowers. Along with the _Vellozia_ grew two beautiful subscandent\r\nspecies of _Echites_,[2] one with large dark violet-coloured flowers,\r\nthe other with white ones of a similar size. They both exhale an odour\r\nnot unlike that of the common primrose, but more powerful. On the edge\r\nof a precipice on the eastern side, we found, covered with its large\r\nrose-coloured flowers, the splendid _Cattleya labiata_, which a few days\r\nbefore we had seen on the Gavea.\r\n\r\nThe following year, on my return from the Organ Mountains, I again\r\nvisited this spot, and found that a great change had taken place. The\r\nforest, which formerly covered a considerable portion of the summit,\r\nwas now cut down and converted into charcoal; and the small shrubs and\r\n_Vellozias_ which grew in the exposed portion, had been destroyed by\r\nfire. The progress of cultivation is proceeding so rapidly for twenty\r\nmiles around Rio, that many of the species which still exist, will in\r\nthe course of a few years, be completely annihilated, and the botanists\r\nof future times who visit the country, will look in vain for the plants\r\ncollected by their predecessors.\r\n\r\nOther excursions to the islands in the bay, and to Jurujuba, on the\r\nopposite side of it, were also productive of many interesting species\r\nof plants. It was at the latter place, on dry bushy hills, that I first\r\nsaw the really beautiful _Buginvillea spectabilis_ growing wild. It\r\nclimbs up into the tops of the bushes and trees near which it grows, and\r\nthe brilliant colour of the flowers, which it produces in the greatest\r\nprofusion, renders it conspicuous in the woods at a great distance. This,\r\nas well as the equally beautiful _Bignonia venusta_, are much cultivated\r\nas ornamental climbers in the suburbs.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Rio, I visited the Botanic Garden, and the Museum of\r\nNatural History. The former, as has already been observed, is situated at\r\nthe foot of a valley near the sea, about eight miles to the south-west of\r\nthe city. It is more a public promenade than a Botanic Garden, for, with\r\nthe exception of a few East Indian trees and shrubs, and a few herbaceous\r\nEuropean plants, there is but little to entitle it to that name. Of the\r\nimmense number of beautiful plants indigenous to the country, I saw but\r\nfew. The European botanist is, however, well recompensed for his visit,\r\nby the sight of some large Bread-fruit trees and the Jack, with its\r\nmuch smaller entire leaves, and monstrous fruit pendent from the stem\r\nand large branches. There are also some fine Cinnamon and Clove trees.\r\nNear the centre of the garden several clusters of Bamboos, with stems\r\nupwards of fifty feet in height, give it a marked tropical character. The\r\navenue which leads up from the entrance, is planted on each side with\r\nthe pine-like _Casuarina_. It is on a piece of ground, about an acre in\r\nextent, on the left hand side of this avenue, that the Tea plants grow\r\nwhich were imported from China by the grandfather of the present Emperor.\r\nIt was thought that the climate and soil of Brazil would be suitable for\r\nits cultivation, but the success of the experiment has not equalled the\r\nexpectations which were formed of it, notwithstanding that the growth of\r\nthe plants, and the preparation of the leaves, were managed by natives\r\nof China accustomed to such occupations. In the province of San Paulo a\r\nfew large plantations of Tea have been established; that belonging to the\r\nex-regent Feijó, containing upwards of 20,000 trees. The produce is sold\r\nin the shops at Rio, and in appearance is scarcely to be distinguished\r\nfrom that of Chinese manufacture, but the flavour is inferior, having\r\nmore of an herby taste. It is sold at about the same price, but it is\r\nnow ascertained that it cannot be produced, so as to give a sufficient\r\nrecompense to the grower, the price of labour being greater in Brazil\r\nthan in China. To remunerate, it is said that Brazil Tea ought to bring\r\nfive shillings per pound.\r\n\r\nThe National Museum of Natural History was founded by Don John the Sixth.\r\nIt gives but a poor idea of the vast stores of animated nature which\r\nexist in the country. Like many other Museums, more attention has been\r\ngiven to the cases than to their contents. The collection is contained\r\nin a building of moderate size, in the Campo de Santa Anna. There are\r\nsome eight apartments which visitors are allowed to enter: one of these\r\nis devoted to the dresses, ornaments, arms, &c., of the aborigines of\r\nBrazil; another contains a number of cases of stuffed birds, foreign as\r\nwell as indigenous, badly prepared, and but few of them named; another\r\nhas a few mummy cases ranged along one side of it, from one of which\r\nthe body has been taken and placed in a glass case; the bindings have\r\nbeen unrolled from the head and feet, and both these parts are fully\r\nexposed. There are also in this room a very limited collection of coins\r\nand medals, and a few paintings, one of which is a full-length portrait\r\nof the founder. Another apartment contains a few cases of quadrupeds,\r\nchiefly monkeys. Two rooms are allotted to a collection of minerals,\r\nwhich is the most extensive as well as the most interesting portion of\r\nthe contents of the institution; the specimens are mostly European. The\r\nMuseum is thrown open to the public every Thursday, from ten till four\r\no’clock, and appears to be well frequented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nJOURNEY TO AND RESIDENCE IN THE ORGAN MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n    Principal Summer Resort of the English Residents—Journey from\r\n    Piedade to Magé and Frechal—Ascent of the Mountains—Description\r\n    of Virgin Forests—Mr. March’s Plantation in the Serra—Treatment\r\n    of his Slaves—Case of One bitten by a venomous Snake—Limb\r\n    amputated by the Author—Mode of Treatment in such Cases among\r\n    the Natives—Charms—Tapir-Hunting in the Mountains—Beasts,\r\n    Birds, and Reptiles found there—Visit to a Brazilian\r\n    Fazendeiro—To Constantia—Ascent of the loftiest Peaks—Vegetable\r\n    Productions in those elevated regions—Pleasant Sojourn on the\r\n    Estate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe collections which had accumulated during the period of my residence\r\nin the vicinity of Rio de Janeiro, having been put into a proper\r\nstate and sent to England, I made arrangements for visiting the Organ\r\nMountains. The peaks which receive this appellation form part of a\r\nmountain range, situated about sixty miles to the north of Rio, which,\r\nbranching out in various directions, stretches from about Bahia, in lat.\r\n12° S., to S. Catharina, in lat. 29° S. The name (Serra dos Orgãos)\r\nbestowed on them by the Portuguese, originated in a fancied resemblance\r\nwhich the peaks, rising gradually one above the other, bear to the pipes\r\nof an organ. About ten years before my visit a Sanatorium, or health\r\nstation, had been established on this range, at about 3,000 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea, in a beautiful valley behind the higher peaks. A\r\nlarge tract of country there belongs to Mr. March, an English gentleman,\r\non which he has a farm for the breeding of horses and mules, and a large\r\ngarden, from which the Rio market is regularly supplied with European\r\nvegetables. On this property a number of cottages have been erected,\r\nwhich are resorted to by the families of the English residents at Rio\r\nduring the hot months. He also receives boarders into his own house, and\r\nit rarely happens that the place is without visitors. About one-third of\r\nthe journey has to be performed by water, the other is accomplished on\r\nmules, which are sent down from Mr. March’s farm (Fazenda).\r\n\r\nAs Mr. March happened to be in Rio at the time I purposed visiting the\r\nmountains, we started together, on the 24th of Dec., along with two\r\nor three English merchants, who were going up to spend the Christmas\r\nholidays with their families. It was mid-day before we could leave\r\nthe city, and, under the influence of a strong sea-breeze, we reached\r\nPiedade, the landing-place, at half-past three o’clock, the distance\r\nbeing about twenty miles. The boat in which we embarked belongs to a\r\nclass which is very common in the harbour, and much employed in conveying\r\ngoods to the head of the bay, and produce from the interior, from thence\r\nto Rio. They are also much made use of by pleasure parties frequenting\r\nthe islands and opposite shores of the bay. They are called Faluas, and\r\nare manned by six rowers, and a steersman who is called the Patrão. The\r\nlatter is very frequently the owner, and most of them are natives of\r\nPortugal. They have two masts, each of which carries a large sail; the\r\nstern part is covered over and enclosed with curtains. The negroes who\r\nman these boats are generally strong muscular men. Seated on one thwart,\r\nthey place their feet against another, and rise up at each stroke of the\r\noar, keeping time to a melancholy chant all the while they are pulling.\r\nThese boats can be hired for an entire day at about eighteen shillings.\r\n\r\nThe day was a most delightful one, the sun shining out brightly from a\r\nclear sky, and the air cooled by the fresh sea-breeze. We passed close\r\nto the Ilha do Governador, which is the largest island in the bay. It\r\nis about eight miles in length, but narrow in proportion, and thinly\r\ninhabited. Shortly before my arrival in the country, an Englishman\r\ncommenced a soap and candle manufactory on it, both of which articles\r\nbring the same price in Rio as those imported from Europe. The muddy\r\nshores of this island, as well as those of the whole bay, abound with\r\ncrabs of all sizes, and every variety of colour, from nearly black to a\r\nbright scarlet. On one occasion when I visited the island, I observed\r\nwithin a very short space about eight species. They are gregarious, and\r\neach kind inhabits a distinct colony; they burrow in the mud, under the\r\nshade and among the roots of the mangrove and other shore-loving trees.\r\nIt was here that I first saw the apparent anomaly of trees bearing crops\r\nof oysters. These animals, when young, attach themselves to the lower\r\npart of the trunks, and long pendulous roots, of the mangrove and other\r\ntrees, which grow in the sea even to low-water mark. The oysters are\r\nsmall and not well-flavoured. Others are found in the bay of enormous\r\nsize, some of their shells, which I collected as specimens, measuring\r\nupwards of a foot in length. Near the head of the bay there are many\r\nlittle islands, some of which are inhabited, and present the agreeable\r\nprospect of cultivation, while others are little more than masses of\r\nrock, among the clefts of which grow a few stunted shrubs, and grotesque\r\nprickly pears.\r\n\r\nAt Piedade, mules from Mr. March’s Fazenda were waiting for us and our\r\nluggage, and, after a short stay for the arrangement of the latter, we\r\nbegan the land part of our journey. At Piedade, which only consists of a\r\nfew scattered houses, a large hotel was being erected by Col. Leite, a\r\nBrazilian gentleman, who, at his own expense, was then making a new road\r\nacross the Organ Mountains, to join the one which leads to the mining\r\ndistricts from Porto de Estrella, another landing place at the head of\r\nthe bay. The latter place has hitherto been the common harbour between\r\nRio and the interior. The Colonel, however, expects that his new road\r\nwill ultimately be preferred, as it is much shorter. Four years after\r\nwhen I again visited this part of the country, I found that this road\r\nwas still in an unfinished state. To save the expense of an engineer he\r\nhad traced the road himself, and the consequence was, that it afterwards\r\nrequired many alterations. The road from Piedade to Magé, a small town\r\nabout four miles distant, leads through a flat, sandy, and, in several\r\nplaces, marshy plain, abounding with low trees and beautiful flowering\r\nshrubs. The hedges were covered with numerous climbers, one of them a\r\nsmall sweet-flowered kind of Jasmine, the only one which has hitherto\r\nbeen found in a wild state on the continent of America. In moist places,\r\n_Dichorizandra thyrsiflora_, with its spikes of azure blossoms, was\r\nnot uncommon, while the sandy fields were covered with a large kind of\r\n_Cactus_, among which many plants of the aloe-like _Fourcroya gigantea_\r\nwere to be seen throwing up their flowering stems to a height of thirty\r\nand forty feet.\r\n\r\nThe town of Magé is rather prettily situated on the banks of the\r\nMagé-assú, one of the many small rivers which take their rise in the\r\nOrgan Mountains, and fall into the head of the bay. It contains a neat\r\nchurch, and a number of well-furnished shops. The river is navigable, for\r\ncraft of a small size, about eight miles from its mouth. A considerable\r\nquantity of Farinha de Mandiocca (Cassava) is exported from this place to\r\nRio. Its low situation, and the surrounding swamps, render it unhealthy\r\nat particular seasons; intermittent fevers are here common, and they\r\nfrequently terminate in others of a more malignant nature. From Magé to\r\nFrechal, the place where we slept for the night, the distance is about\r\nfourteen miles. The road still continued flat, but wound round many low\r\nhills, the sides of which are covered with plantations of Mandiocca. We\r\nmet several troops of mules coming down from the interior, loaded with\r\nproduce. Unaccustomed to such a mode of transport, the European looks\r\nwith astonishment at the great number of animals which are here required\r\nto carry what, in his own country, would scarcely form a load for one.\r\nLoaded mules start daily from Rio, Piedade, and Porto d’Estrella, to\r\nmake journeys into the interior of from five hundred to two thousand\r\nmiles and upwards. They seldom travel above twelve or sixteen miles a\r\nday, and the load allowed to each varies from six to eight arrobas of\r\nthirty-two pounds each. The loads are protected from the weather by\r\ndried ox-hides, which are strapped lightly over them. Frechal is a small\r\nvillage, consisting of a few scattered houses, and situated about two\r\nmiles from the foot of the mountains. The place at which we put up for\r\nthe night is a large kind of public house (Venda), where there is an open\r\nroom for the accommodation of travellers; around this room a number of\r\nbeds are arranged, which gives it very much the appearance of a hospital\r\nward. Here, unlike most other places of the same kind between Rio and the\r\nmining districts, a very comfortable meal may always be obtained.\r\n\r\nNext morning by break of day we again continued our journey. At about\r\ntwo miles from Frechal the ascent of the mountains begins. From thence\r\nto Mr. March’s Fazenda, which stands at an elevation of upwards of 3,000\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, is twelve miles. During the whole way\r\nthe road is very bad, and in many places so steep, that it is with\r\nconsiderable difficulty the mules make their way up it. Indeed, to one\r\nunused to travel on such paths, which have more the appearance of the\r\nbed of a mountain torrent than a road for beasts of burden, many parts\r\nof it appear impassable; but he is soon undeceived by the slow yet sure\r\nmanner in which the mules pass along the worst portion of it, especially\r\nif left entirely to themselves. The whole length of the road is through\r\none dense forest, the magnificence of which cannot be imagined by those\r\nwho have never seen it, or penetrated into its recesses. Those remnants\r\nof the virgin forest which still stand in the vicinity of the capital,\r\nalthough they appear grand to the eye of a newly-arrived European,\r\nbecome insignificant when compared with the mass of giant vegetation\r\nwhich clothes the sides of the Organ Mountains. So far as I have been\r\nable to determine, the large forest trees consist of various species of\r\n_Palms_, _Laurus_, _Ficus_, _Cassia_, _Bignonia_, _Solanum_, _Myrtaceæ_,\r\nand _Melastomaceæ_. In temperate climates natural forests are mostly\r\ncomposed of trees which grow gregariously. In those of tropical countries\r\nit is seldom that two trees of a kind are to be seen growing together,\r\nthe variety of different species is so great. Many of the trees are of\r\nimmense size, and have their trunks and branches covered with myriads\r\nof those plants which are usually called parasites, but are not so in\r\nreality, consisting of _Orchideæ_, _Bromeliaceæ_, _Ferns_, _Peperomiæ_,\r\n&c., which derive their nourishment from the moisture of their bark, and\r\nthe earthy matter which has been formed from the decay of mosses, &c.\r\nMany of the trees have their trunks encircled by twiners, the stems of\r\nwhich are often thicker than those they surround. This is particularly\r\nthe case with a kind of wild fig, called by the Brazilians, Cipo\r\nMatador. It runs up the tree to which it has attached itself, and at\r\nthe distance of about every ten feet throws out from each side a thick\r\nclasper, which curves round, and closely entwines the other stem. As both\r\nthe trees increase in size, the pressure ultimately becomes so great,\r\nthat the supporting one dies from the embrace of the parasite.\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of wild fig-tree, with an enormous height and\r\nthickness of stem, to which the English residents give the name of\r\nButtress-tree, from several large thin plates which stand out from the\r\nbottom of the trunk. They begin to jut out from the stem at the height\r\nof ten or twelve feet from the bottom, and gradually increase in breadth\r\ntill they reach the ground, where they are connected with the large roots\r\nof the tree. At the surface of the ground these plates are often five\r\nfeet broad, and throughout not more than a few inches thick. The various\r\nspecies of _Laurus_ form fine trees; they flower in the months of April\r\nand May, at which season the atmosphere is loaded with the rich perfume\r\nof their small white blossoms. When their fruit is ripe, it forms the\r\nprincipal food of the Jacutinga (_Penelope Jacutinga_, Spix), a fine\r\nlarge game bird. The large _Cassiæ_ have a striking appearance when in\r\nflower; and, as an almost equal number of large trees of _Lasiandra\r\nFontanesiana_, and others of the _Melastoma_ tribe, are in bloom at the\r\nsame time, the forests are then almost one mass of yellow and purple from\r\nthe abundance of these flowers. Rising amid these, the pink-coloured\r\nflowers of the _Chorisia speciosa_—a kind of silk cotton-tree—can be\r\neasily distinguished. It is also a large tree, with a stem, covered with\r\nstrong prickles, from five to eight feet in circumference unbranched\r\nto the height of thirty or forty feet. The branches then form a nearly\r\nhemispherical top, which, when covered with its thousands of beautiful\r\nlarge rose-coloured blossoms, has a striking effect when contrasted with\r\nthe masses of green, yellow, and purple of the surrounding trees.\r\n\r\nMany of these large trunks afford support to various species of climbing\r\nand twining shrubs, belonging to the natural orders _Bignoniaceæ_,\r\n_Compositæ_, _Apocyneæ_, and _Leguminosæ_, the stems of which frequently\r\nassume a very remarkable appearance. Several of them are often twisted\r\ntogether and dangle from the branches of the trees, like large ropes,\r\nwhile others are flat and compressed, like belts: of the latter\r\ndescription I have met with some six inches broad, and not more than\r\nan inch thick. Two of the finest climbers are the beautiful large\r\ntrumpet-flowered _Solandra grandiflora_, which, diffusing itself among\r\nthe largest trees of the forest, gives them a magnificence not their own;\r\nand a showy species of Fuchsia (_F. integrifolia_, Cambess.),[3] which is\r\nvery common, attaching itself to all kinds of trees, often reaching to\r\nthe height of from sixty to one hundred feet, and then falling down in\r\nthe most beautiful festoons.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the mountains the underwood principally consists of shrubs\r\nbelonging to the natural orders _Melastomaceæ_, _Myrtaceæ_, _Compositæ_,\r\n_Solanaceæ_, and _Rubiaceæ_, among which are many large species of\r\nherbaceous ferns, and a few palms. About the middle, palms and tree ferns\r\nabound, some of the latter reaching to the height of not less than forty\r\nfeet. These trees are so unlike every other denizen of the forest, so\r\nstrange in appearance, yet so graceful, that they have always attracted\r\nmy attention more than any other, not even excepting the palms. At an\r\nelevation of about 2,000 feet, a large species of bamboo (_Bambusa\r\nTogoara_, Mart.) makes its appearance. The stems of this gigantic grass\r\nare often eighteen inches in circumference, and attain a height of\r\nfrom fifty to one hundred feet. They do not, however, grow perfectly\r\nupright, their tops forming a graceful curve downwards. Throughout the\r\nwhole distance, the path was lined on each side with the most beautiful\r\nherbaceous plants and delicate ferns.\r\n\r\nWe reached Mr. March’s Fazenda early in the forenoon. His estate embraces\r\nan extent of country containing sixty-four square miles. The greater\r\npart of it is still covered by virgin forests; that which is cleared,\r\nconsists of pasture land, and several small farms for the cultivation of\r\nIndian corn, French beans, and potatoes. Plentiful crops are yielded of\r\nthe two former, but the produce of the latter is neither so abundant nor\r\nso good as in England. He has also near his house a large garden, under\r\nthe management of a French gardener, in which nearly all the European\r\nfruits and vegetables grow tolerably well. The peach, the olive, the\r\nfig, the vine, the apple, the quince, the loquat, the pear, the orange,\r\nand the banana, may be seen growing side by side, and all, with the\r\nexception of the two latter, bearing abundance of fruit. The orange and\r\nthe banana also bear, but the cold seldom allows the fruit to come to\r\nperfection. The strawberry yields but little fruit, and the gooseberry\r\nnone at all. The apples are quite equal to any I have tasted in England,\r\nbut the peaches are very inferior; bushels of them are given to feed the\r\npigs. The figs are delicious, especially a variety which produces small\r\ngreen-coloured fruit. Excellent crops of cauliflower, cabbage, asparagus,\r\nartichokes, turnips, carrots, peas, onions, &c., are freely produced, and\r\nsent weekly to the city. The most fertile part of the estate is a large\r\nvalley, situated between the higher chain of the Organ Mountains and a\r\nsmaller range which runs nearly parallel with it, and many of the smaller\r\nvalleys, which run up to the peaks themselves, are cultivated; these are\r\nall well watered with small streams of cool and limpid water.\r\n\r\nAt this elevation the climate is very much cooler than it is at Rio,\r\nthe thermometer in the months of May and June sometimes falling as low\r\nas 32° just before daybreak. The lowest at which I observed it myself,\r\nwas on the 26th of May, when, at 8 o’clock A.M., the mercury indicated\r\n39°. The highest to which it rose during the six months I resided on the\r\nmountains, was on the 23rd of February, when the mercury stood at 84° at\r\nnoon. The hot season is also the season of the rains, and violent thunder\r\nstorms occur almost daily, during the months of January and February.\r\nThey come on with great regularity about four o’clock in the afternoon,\r\nand when they pass over, leave a delightfully cool evening. Like the\r\nmountains near Rio, the whole of the Organ range consists of granite. The\r\nalluvial soil is very deep and rich in the valleys, and underneath it\r\nthere exists the same red-coloured argillaceo-ferrugineous clay which is\r\nso common at Rio.\r\n\r\nIt being Christmas-day on which we arrived, and a great holiday, we found\r\nthe whole of the slaves belonging to the estate, amounting to about one\r\nhundred, dancing in the yard before the house, and all attired in new\r\nsuits of clothes, which had been sent out to them the day before. In\r\nthe evening, a party of the best conducted, principally creoles, were\r\nadmitted into the verandah of the house, where I had a good opportunity\r\nof witnessing their dances—some of them not being very delicate. One\r\nof the best was a kind of dramatic dance, of which the following is\r\na programme. Near the door of a house belonging to a Padre (priest),\r\na young fellow commences dancing and playing on the viola, a kind of\r\nguitar. The Padre hears the noise, and sends out one of his servants to\r\nascertain the cause. He finds the musician dancing to his own strains,\r\nand tells him that he is sent by his master to enquire why he is thus\r\ndisturbed. The musician tells him that he is making no disturbance at\r\nall, but only trying a new dance from Bahia, which he saw the other day\r\nat Diario. The servant asks if it is a good one: “Oh, very good,” replies\r\nthe other, “will you not try it?” The servant claps his hands, cries\r\n“Let the Padre go sleep!” and immediately joins in the dance. The same\r\nthing is repeated till the Padre’s servants, men, women, and children,\r\namounting to about twenty, are dancing in a circle before the house. Last\r\nof all the supposed Padre himself makes his appearance in a great rage,\r\ndressed in a large Poncho for a gown, a broad-brimmed black straw hat,\r\nand a mask with a long beard to it. He demands the cause of the noise,\r\nwhich, he says, prevents him from enjoying his dinner. The musician\r\ntells him the same story that was told to his servants, and after much\r\npersuasion, gets him to join in the dance also. He dances with as much\r\nzeal as any of them, but, watching his opportunity, he takes out a whip\r\nwhich he has concealed under his gown, and, lashing the whole of them\r\nout of the apartment, finishes the performance. A stricter discipline is\r\nkept up among the slaves on this estate, than on any of the same size I\r\nhave been on in Brazil, but, at the same time, they are carefully and\r\nkindly attended to. There is a hospital for the sick, and Mr. Heath, the\r\nmanager of the estate, has had great experience in the treatment of those\r\ndiseases to which negroes are liable.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are not so many kinds of venomous snakes in Brazil as is\r\nsupposed even by the inhabitants, yet accidents frequently occur from\r\ntheir bites to those slaves who are engaged in the plantations. In the\r\nwhole course of my travels in Brazil, I did not meet with more than half\r\na dozen kinds, which, from examination, were found to have poison fangs.\r\nSome of these are, however, very numerous in individuals. In the province\r\nof Rio, and in the southern provinces generally, the Jararáca, (_Bothrops\r\nNeuwiedii_, Spix.) a genus nearly allied to that which the Rattle Snake\r\nbelongs to, is perhaps the most common. When full grown it is usually\r\nabout six feet long. It is frequently met with in plantations, and in\r\nbushy and grassy places by the sides of woods, but is scarcely ever found\r\nin dense forests. That which is most abundant in the central and northern\r\nprovinces, is a true Rattle Snake (_Cascavel_), but most probably a\r\ndistinct species from that of North America. On the day previous to my\r\narrival at Mr. March’s, one of his female slaves, about thirty-two years\r\nof age, and the mother of four children, whilst weeding Indian corn on\r\na plantation about eight miles distant from the house, was bitten on\r\nthe right hand, between the bones of the fore-finger and thumb, by a\r\nJararáca. The accident took place about eight o’clock in the morning, and\r\nimmediately after she left to return home, but only reached half way,\r\nwhen she was obliged to lie down from excessive pain and exhaustion. At\r\nthis time she said the feeling of thirst was very great. Some slaves\r\nbelonging to the estate happening to be near, one of them rode off to\r\ninform Mr. Heath. When he arrived, he found the arm much swollen up to\r\nthe shoulder, beneath which he applied a ligature. From a cottage in the\r\nneighbourhood he got a little hartshorn, some of which he applied to the\r\nbite, and caused her to swallow about a tea-spoonful in water. Being in a\r\nstate of high fever, he took about a pound of blood from her, after which\r\nshe became faintish. She was then removed to the Fazenda, and had two\r\ngrains of calomel administered to her, and about an hour after a large\r\ndose of castor oil.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw her on the following day, she still complained of excruciating\r\npain in the hand and arm, to relieve which a linseed-meal poultice was\r\napplied. The pulse being 130, and full, about another pound of blood\r\nwas taken from the other arm. Next day a number of little vesicles\r\nmade their appearance on the back of the hand and a little above the\r\nwrist, which, when opened, discharged a watery fluid. For the next two\r\ndays she continued to suffer much pain, to relieve which poultices\r\nwere constantly applied. More vesicles formed, and the cuticle began\r\nto peel off in the vicinity of the bite. On the morning of the 29th,\r\nthat is, on the fourth day after the accident, when the poultice was\r\nremoved, she complained of no pain at all in her hand, and on careful\r\nexamination I found that gangrene had taken place, all below the wrist\r\nbeing dead. From the state of the arm, there was every appearance of the\r\nmortification extending. On making an incision into the living portion\r\nabove the wrist, a considerable quantity of a very fœtid whitish watery\r\nfluid discharged itself; and, on pressing the arm between the finger and\r\nthumb, a crepitation was felt from the air which had generated beneath\r\nthe integuments. She was now very weak, the pulse 136, small and feeble,\r\nand she appeared to be fast sinking. Amputation being the only means that\r\nseemed to offer her a chance of recovery, I decided at once to take off\r\nthe arm. As the crepitation extended to a few inches above the elbow, and\r\nthe swelling itself to the shoulder, I determined to take it off as close\r\nto the latter as possible. As there was no room for the application of\r\nthe tourniquet, I got Mr. Heath to apply pressure with a padded key over\r\nthe artery where it passes under the clavicle, and Mr. March held the arm\r\nwhile I performed the operation. A good deal of blood was lost before I\r\ncould secure the artery, which had to be done before the bone was sawn\r\nthrough. In a fortnight after, the stump had nearly healed up, and she\r\nwas walking about the room. Four years afterwards I again saw her, and\r\nher general health had not suffered in the least, but she had become\r\nextremely irritable and ill-tempered.\r\n\r\nNeither the natives nor the inhabitants have any remedy for snake\r\nbites, in which they put implicit faith. This I found out from their\r\nfrequently applying to me for medicine, after their own resources had\r\nbeen completely exhausted. When an accident of this nature happens, the\r\npatient, in the interior particularly, is generally put under the charge\r\nof a class of people called Curadores, who apply their remedies with many\r\nmysterious ceremonies. The first operation of the Curador is to suck the\r\nwound, which, if immediately had recourse to, I believe to be the next\r\nbest thing to excision or cauterization. The patient is then put into a\r\ndark room, and care is taken that he is not exposed to currents of air.\r\nOne of the remedies which they believe to be the most efficacious, is\r\nthat which is well known in Minas and the other inland provinces, by the\r\nname of Black Root (_Raiz Preto_), and Snake Root (_Raiz de Cobra_). It\r\nis the root of a common shrub, now well known to botanists by the name of\r\n_Chiococca anguifuga_. It has a pungent disagreeable smell, not unlike\r\nthat of the common Valerian. Decoctions of this are given to drink, and\r\npoultices of it are applied to the wound. The _Raiz Preto_ acts as a\r\nviolent emetic and purgative, and also induces copious perspiration. If\r\nit operates freely in this manner, they augur favourably of the patient’s\r\nrecovery. Besides this plant they use many others. Snakes have generally\r\na disagreeable musky smell, and it is a common opinion among the people,\r\nthat any plant possessing one similar is sure to be valuable in the cure\r\nof their bites.\r\n\r\nIn the province of Pernambuco, I found that a common method of cure\r\nwas to give the patient rum to drink, till he was in a perfect state\r\nof intoxication; and this they affirm is very frequently a successful\r\nremedy. But the most extraordinary method of cure which I have ever heard\r\nof, is one which was communicated to me by a farmer (Fazendeiro), who\r\naccompanied me to Rio on my return from the mountains. Only three days,\r\nhe said, before he left his estate, one of his oxen was bitten on the leg\r\nby a Jararáca, but having immediately applied his remedy, it became as\r\nwell as any of the others before he quitted home. This remedy consists\r\nof the following well-known Latin acrostic, or, as he termed them,\r\nmagical words:—\r\n\r\n    S. A. T. O. R.\r\n    A. R. E. P. O.\r\n    T. E. N. E. T.\r\n    O. P. E. R. A.\r\n    R. O. T. A. S.\r\n\r\nEach line is to be written separately on a slip of paper, and then\r\nrolled into the form of a pill, the whole five to be given as soon as\r\npossible after the person or animal has been bitten. He also gave me\r\nquite as ridiculous a remedy for the cure of drunkenness. This was to\r\nplace a piece of bread in the arm-pits of a dying man, and allow it to\r\nremain there till he was perfectly dead. The smallest portion of this\r\nbread, he affirmed, given, without their knowledge, to those addicted to\r\nintemperance, would produce a perfect cure.\r\n\r\nCatesby mentions that in North America he has seen death result from\r\nthe bite of a Rattle Snake in less than two minutes; I have also heard\r\nof death taking place very shortly after the bite in Brazil, but I have\r\nnever actually seen it in less than ten or twelve hours. In those cases\r\nwhere the poison acts so quickly, it must be so strong as to destroy\r\nthe nervous energy at once. In those in which the patient lingers\r\nfor one or more days, death generally takes place from inflammation\r\nand mortification of the subcutaneous cellular substance. During the\r\ncourse of my journeys in the interior, I met frequently with persons\r\nwho had recovered from severe snake bites, but almost all of them had\r\nbroken constitutions, and suffered from ulcerated limbs. From all that\r\nI have seen, I candidly confess, that I have no faith in any medicine\r\nintended to act as a specific for a snake bite, whether used internally\r\nor externally. I do not of course allude to those which are usually\r\napplied for the reduction of inflammation and fever, as under any mode of\r\ntreatment they cannot be withheld. A ligature attached above the wound,\r\nand instant incisions into the wound itself, and the application of a\r\ncupping-glass, which, in the shape of a wine glass, is always at hand,\r\nare more to be depended on than any other external remedial agency.\r\n\r\nMy first journey of any length into the virgin forest here, was made in\r\ncompany with M. Lomonosof, the Russian minister at the court of Brazil,\r\nand Mr. Heath. M. Lomonosof was desirous to witness a Tapir (_Anta_)\r\nhunt, that animal being very common on this range. It is the largest\r\nSouth American quadruped, but is not of greater size in the body than a\r\ncalf about six months old, and it stands upon much shorter legs. We left\r\nthe Fazenda about half-past six o’clock in the morning, and entered the\r\nforest at about three miles to the north of it. We were accompanied by\r\nfour negroes, and took provisions with us for two days. We had also our\r\nguns and six good dogs. For the first mile and a half we had a tolerable\r\npath, leading through a forest of fine trees, with very little underwood\r\nexcept young palms, hundreds of which were cut down by the blacks who\r\nwere clearing the way for us. In going up the valley we crossed and\r\nrecrossed a small river, called the Imbuhy, several times, on the banks\r\nof which I added largely to my botanical collections. The most difficult\r\npart of our path was about half a mile which had to be cut through a\r\nthick forest of bamboos. Having accomplished this, we came upon an old\r\ntrack of a tapir. It was about two feet broad, well beaten, and had foot\r\nmarks of the animal on it, but they were several days old. This path led\r\nus through a densely wooded part of the forest, to one which was less so,\r\nthe larger trees being fewer, but instead, an abundance of shrubs and\r\nlarge herbaceous plants. We here came upon several paths, which we found\r\nled to a deep pool in the river, and evidently a place which the tapir\r\nrepairs to for the purpose of drinking and bathing. While Mr. Heath was\r\nendeavouring to get the dogs upon a recent track, I occupied myself in\r\ncollecting a number of curious plants, which grew on a sloping bank by\r\nthe side of the stream. It now began to rain, and the dogs not having\r\ngone out, we again crossed the river, and proceeded up the valley about\r\na mile further. From thence one of the dogs set off, but returned in\r\nabout a quarter of an hour without having turned up anything. It was now\r\nnearly four o’clock in the afternoon, and the rain was beginning to fall\r\nheavily; we therefore sought for a place where we might encamp for the\r\nnight, as we were ten miles distant from the Fazenda, and M. Lomonosof\r\nwas too much fatigued to be able to return. The place we selected was\r\nunder the shade of some large trees, near which grew abundance of the\r\nsmall cabbage palm (_Euterpe edulis_, Mart.), the terminal bud of which\r\nis so much made use of as a vegetable by the Brazilians. A hut was soon\r\nerected, and thickly thatched over with the leaves of this palm. At first\r\nwe were dreadfully annoyed by mosquitoes and a little sand-fly, but the\r\nkindling of a large fire in front of our hut soon dispersed them. Palm\r\nleaves were spread upon the floor for our bed, and we had a small log of\r\nwood for a pillow. It rained heavily all night, but we did not suffer\r\nfrom it. We got up next morning by break of day, and prepared to return\r\nhome, as it still continued to rain. I was somewhat amused at the vessel\r\nin which the blacks cooked their breakfast. It was a pot made from a part\r\nof the thick stem of a bamboo, the bottom being formed by the division\r\nwhich occurs at each joint. It is placed upright on the fire, and so long\r\nas it contains water will not burn through. Among the many uses to which\r\nthe bamboo may be put, that is one which I never heard of before nor have\r\nseen since. After a slight breakfast we commenced our journey homewards;\r\nbut before getting out of the forest, M. Lomonosof, little accustomed\r\nto a hunter’s life, became so exhausted from fatigue, that it was with\r\ndifficulty he reached the place where horses had been ordered to be sent\r\nto await our return.\r\n\r\nThe animals which inhabit the vast forests of the Organ mountains are,\r\nperhaps, no less various than the forms of the vegetable creation.\r\nFormerly the Ounce, or Jaguar (_Felis Onca_), used to be common, but\r\nnow it is only occasionally that its roar is heard at night, or that\r\ncattle or sheep suffer from its depredations. The black variety, to\r\nwhich the Brazilians give the name of Tiger, is still more rare. The\r\nwoods, however, abound with a very pretty species of wild cat (_Felis\r\npardalis_). Monkeys are very numerous. In the morning the forests resound\r\nwith the unearthly howling of the Barbado (_Mycetes barbatus_), which\r\nis as large as an ordinary dog; they live in bands of many together.\r\nThere are several others quite as large, but they are seldom to be seen.\r\nThe grey Marmoset, which is so common in the forests of the northern\r\nprovinces, is not to be met with here, but another, and perhaps a still\r\nmore beautiful species is occasionally found. It is the _Jaccus auritus_.\r\nIt is easily distinguished from all the other species by its nearly\r\nuniform dark colour, and the pencils of long white hairs which come out\r\nfrom its ears. The Sloth (_Acheus Ai_) is also occasionally found feeding\r\non the leaves of the _Cecropia peltata_, which form his favourite food.\r\nOne which I had for some time in captivity, was of a timid and fretful\r\ndisposition. Like most other animals in which the brain is small in\r\nproportion to the development of the nervous system, it is very tenacious\r\nof life. Although more tardy in its movements than most quadrupeds of\r\nits size, it passes with considerable rapidity from branch to branch,\r\nfrom which in its progress it always hangs by the legs and feet. It owes\r\nmuch to Waterton, for being the first to remove the stigma which Buffon\r\nand others put upon its character. In the river which flows through the\r\nvalley, the Brazilian Otter (_Lutra Brasiliensis_), and the Capybara\r\n(_Hydrochærus capybara_), are still occasionally to be met with. A pretty\r\nlittle deer (_Cervus nemorivagus_) frequently attracts the sportsman to\r\nthe woods, as do also the two species of Pecari (_Dicotyles labiatus_\r\nand _torquatus_), which are so common all over the intertropical parts\r\nof South America. A kind of Opossum (_Didelphis Azaræ_) is as much the\r\npest of the fowl-house as the fox is in Europe. It is very tenacious of\r\nlife, getting up and running away when every bone in its body appears to\r\nbe broken by the blows which have been inflicted on it. In the woods an\r\nArmadillo (_Tatusia peba_) is not uncommon, the stewed flesh of which\r\nmakes excellent food; and in the forests a prehensile-tailed kind of\r\nPorcupine (_Sphigurus spinosus_) is also often met with; they both burrow\r\nin the ground. The great Ant-bear (_Myrmecophaga tamandua_) is rarely,\r\nthough occasionally, to be met with. Along with the monkeys, a little\r\nbrown squirrel is often to be seen sporting among the branches of the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nBesides the numerous fly-catchers and other small birds, the wild\r\npigeons, the flocks of parroquets and parrots, the hawks, owls, and the\r\nvarious species of Toucans, remarkable for their brilliant colours,\r\nand the great size of their bills, there are several large birds which\r\nare much sought after by the sportsman. These are the Jacú, Jacutinga,\r\nJacubemba, Jacuassú, all gallinaceous birds, belonging to the genus\r\n_Penelope_; two species of Quail, the Macúcu (_Tinamus macaco_), and the\r\nNhambú (_Pezus niamba_); and, lastly, a Partridge (_Perdix Guianensis_),\r\nthe Capoeira of the Brazilians. Of reptiles there are numerous snakes,\r\nmany of which are beautifully coloured, a vast variety of lizards, and\r\ninnumerable hordes of frogs and toads of all sizes, from the small tree\r\nkind not more than an inch long, to those marsh ones which are nearly\r\nlarge enough to fill a hat. Till one gets accustomed to the sounds which\r\nthey produce, particularly previous to rain, they are almost deafening.\r\nDuring the day the air is full of beautiful butterflies of all colours,\r\nnow flying from flower to flower, and now alighting on the moist sandy\r\nbanks of pools and small streams in countless numbers. The large nests\r\nof wasps hang from the boughs of the trees, and smaller ones are often\r\nhidden among the leaves and small branches of shrubs, the inhabitants of\r\nwhich, when disturbed, rush out and inflict summary punishment on the\r\nunhappy transgressors. In open places the leaves and flowers of bushes\r\nand other plants, abound with Diamond and other beetles; while at night\r\nthe air is lighted up with fire-flies of various sizes, which, from their\r\nbrilliancy, give the idea that part of the stars have fallen from the\r\nfirmament, and are floating about without a resting place.\r\n\r\nWhile I resided at Mr. March’s I frequently paid a visit to a Brazilian,\r\nJoaquim Paulo by name, who has a small estate about ten miles distant.\r\nMy first visit was made along with Mr. Heath, and as we arrived shortly\r\nbefore dinner, we were invited to partake of that meal. This I was not\r\ndispleased at, as it gave me an opportunity of witnessing the internal\r\neconomy of a Brazilian country-house, never having been in one before.\r\nThe dinner was substantial and clean, but every dish was, according to\r\nthe custom of the country, highly seasoned with garlic. The table was\r\ncovered with a clean cloth, on one end of which was laid a heap of ground\r\ncassava root (_Farinha de Mandiocca_), and on the other a heap of ground\r\nIndian corn (_Farinha de Milho_). On one of these heaps was placed a\r\nlarge dish of boiled black French beans (_Feijoens_), with a large piece\r\nof fat pork (_Toucinho_) in the midst of them; while on the other was\r\nlaid a dish of stewed fowl. We had also roast pork and blood sausages.\r\nFrom these dishes and heaps every one helped himself. As a vegetable\r\nwe had a dish of cabbage-palm (_Euterpe edulis_), which is very tender\r\nand delicious, tasting not unlike asparagus. During dinner we were each\r\nfurnished with a cup of Lisbon wine; and after it we had various kinds\r\nof sweet-meats. Besides ourselves, there were only our host and two of\r\nhis sons. Indeed, his wife and daughters I did not see till I had been\r\nseveral times at the house. The two girls were rather pretty, but they\r\ncould neither read nor write. The father would not allow them to learn\r\neither, from fear that they would take to the reading of novels, and the\r\nwriting of love-letters. He was himself a most inveterate huntsman, being\r\nalmost always in the woods in pursuit of game. He was a capital shot, and\r\nhad killed more tapirs with his own hand than any one in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nI also visited occasionally a coffee plantation called Constantia, about\r\nfifteen miles distant from Mr. March’s, belonging to M. De Luze, a\r\nSwiss, who had been many years in the country. It is situated in a flat\r\nvalley surrounded by sloping hills, and is one of the most lovely spots\r\nI have ever seen. In the neighbourhood of it there are two other coffee\r\nplantations belonging to Germans, but they have all ascertained that the\r\nelevation is too great for the successful cultivation of coffee. Since\r\nthen M. De Luze has sold his estate to Mr. March, and bought a larger\r\none, in a fine coffee country on the banks of the Rio Parahiba. In the\r\nlatitude of Rio, coffee does not succeed at a much greater elevation than\r\n2,000 feet. At Mr. March’s the bush grows well, but it never ripens its\r\nfruit properly.\r\n\r\nThe most distant journey I made, was to an estate about twenty miles\r\nnorth of Mr. March’s Fazenda. About the middle of April, Mr. Heath\r\nreceived a note from the lady to whom it belongs, Dona Rita Thereza da\r\nRoza, asking him as a great favour to ride over and take me along with\r\nhim to see her little daughter, who a few days before had been attacked\r\nwith apoplexy and paralysis. On the following day it was our intention\r\nto have gone, but heavy rains, which came on and flooded the rivers,\r\nprevented us from starting till the succeeding day. Mr. March’s house\r\nbeing at the south end of his estate, we had to pass along the whole\r\nlength of it, a distance of about eight miles. After leaving it our road\r\nled over a very high hill; it was steep, and the soil being a kind of red\r\nclay, was so slippery in consequence of the heavy rains which had lately\r\nfallen, that our mules had considerable difficulty in getting up. The\r\ndeclivity on the other side was nearly as bad. From this place the road\r\npassed for the most part through large fields of Indian corn, which was\r\nthen nearly ripe for collecting, and several small patches of rice in the\r\nmoist flat places. When we arrived at the house of the lady, we learned\r\nthat the daughter had died the evening before. We were shown the body,\r\nwhich had been put into a coffin, and placed in a neat little chapel\r\nbelonging to the estate, and in which it was to be buried. The interment\r\nwas to take place on the arrival of the Padre, who had to be brought from\r\na distance of forty-eight miles, and was hourly expected. The child was\r\nonly eight years of age, but had been long unwell. We had to remain to\r\ndinner, and, as many relations and neighbours were present, the party\r\nwas a large one. Until dinner was ready, the eldest daughter, a rather\r\nplain girl, was amusing herself by swinging to and fro in a hammock,\r\nwhich was slung in one corner of the dining-room. As an instance of the\r\nearly age at which women marry in Brazil, I may mention that we were\r\ninformed by the lady herself, that she was married at ten years of age,\r\nand was a mother before she had completed her eleventh year. She was then\r\nforty-five years old, and had had no less than twenty-five births, ten\r\nof which were miscarriages. We were received with much kindness, and she\r\nexpressed herself very grateful for my visit.\r\n\r\nAs the Organ Mountains rise to an elevation of about four thousand feet\r\nabove Mr. March’s house, I had long been desirous to spend a few days\r\namong the high peaks, for the purpose of making collections of their\r\nvegetable productions. The only botanists who had visited Mr. March’s\r\nestate before me were Langsdorff, the celebrated voyager, and at\r\nthat time Consul-General for Russia in Brazil, Burchell, the African\r\ntraveller, and a German of the name of Lhotsky. The former explored the\r\nvegetation in the neighbourhood of the Fazenda, during a stay of a few\r\nweeks, about twelve or thirteen years before my visit; Mr. Burchell\r\nremained six weeks, nine or ten years before; and Lhotsky, two or three\r\nweeks only, about five years later. None of them botanized higher than\r\nthe level of Mr. March’s house, and the knowledge of this fact made me\r\nthe more anxious to explore a field which promised so much novelty. I\r\nhad fixed on the early part of April for going up, but the whole of that\r\nmonth was so wet, that I was prevented at that time from putting my\r\ndesign into execution. May, however, having set in fine, I started on\r\nthe morning of the 6th, accompanied by four negroes. One of them, “Pai\r\nFelipe,” a creole upwards of sixty years of age, was to act as guide.\r\nThis old fellow was one of the most active, not only of blacks, but of\r\nany individual of his years I have ever seen. From his infancy he had\r\nbeen accustomed to the woods, and was one of the best hunters on the\r\nestate. The other three were to carry provisions, and to assist in taking\r\nhome my collections. We entered the forest at about a mile to the north\r\nof Mr. March’s house, and our road for that day was nearly due west. Two\r\nyears before, an English merchant from Rio ascended, from mere curiosity,\r\nto within a few hundred feet of the summit, guided by the same old black\r\nwho accompanied me. For the first few miles we were able to keep the road\r\nwhich he had made, but from the rapid growth of the bamboos and underwood\r\nthrough which it had been cut, it was as difficult to force our way as if\r\nno path had ever been made. Our progress was but slow, it being necessary\r\nfor one of the blacks to go on before in order to cut a pass. Some of\r\nthe bamboos were of immense size; I measured several about six inches in\r\ndiameter, and their height could not be less than eighty or a hundred\r\nfeet. The internodes are generally filled with water, obviously secreted\r\nby the plant itself. Prince Maximilian, in his travels, speaks of this\r\nfluid as forming a most delicious beverage to hunters and others in the\r\nwoods. I have frequently tasted it, but always found it so nauseous that\r\nthe most urgent thirst alone would compel me to drink it.\r\n\r\nNear the entrance of the wood we passed a large species of _Copaifera_,\r\nthe lower part of the stem of which had been pierced for the purpose\r\nof obtaining the balsam which those trees exude. For miles our route\r\nlay nearly parallel with a small river, along the banks of which grew\r\nsome very large trees; among them I observed a species of _Laurus_,\r\nand another of _Pleroma_, both in flower. The underwood consisted of a\r\ngreat variety of shrubby _Melastomaceæ_, _Myrtaceæ_, _Rubiaceæ_, and\r\nsuffruticose species of _Begonia_. In other places elegant tree-ferns\r\nabounded, their stems often covered with little delicate species of the\r\nsame tribe, or air-plants bearing beautiful flowers. Pretty herbaceous\r\nferns and handsome-flowered _Begonias_ were trodden down at every\r\nfootstep. The stems of the large trees were covered with _Bromelias_,\r\n_Tillandsias_, _Orchideæ_, ferns, and a climbing species of _Begonia_.\r\nOccasionally a large plant of _Cactus truncatus_ was to be seen hanging\r\nfrom rocks or from the stem of some large tree, covered with hundreds of\r\nbeautiful pink blossoms. In crossing over a hill about five hundred feet\r\nhigh, which stands in the valley we were now passing through, I found the\r\ntop of it literally covered with various kinds of Orchidaceous plants,\r\nbut with the exception of the beautiful little _Sophronites grandiflora_,\r\nwhich was then in flower, all had been previously met with at a lower\r\nelevation. It was here, likewise, that I first met with _Luxemburgia\r\nciliosa_, a fine shrub producing large corymbs of lemon-coloured flowers,\r\nand belonging to the violet tribe. On this hill I likewise observed two\r\nkinds of bamboo, different from the large kinds in the woods below. One\r\nof them had the internodes considerably shorter in proportion to the size\r\nof the plant, and was altogether much smaller. The other species was\r\nstill less, its stem not being more than half an inch in diameter, but\r\ncontinuing of that thickness to a height of fifteen or twenty feet. The\r\ngetting through these was the most difficult part of our day’s journey.\r\n\r\nAt 4 o’clock P.M., we reached a place by the side of a small stream,\r\nwhere I determined to remain for the night; and, while the blacks were\r\noccupied in cutting wood for a fire and in preparing dinner, I took a\r\nwalk up the course of the little stream. As I estimated this spot to be\r\nat an elevation of about 4,500 feet, I naturally expected a vegetation\r\ndifferent from that in the valley below. The first plant that attracted\r\nmy attention was what I imagined to be a fine individual of _Cereus\r\ntruncatus_, in full flower, hanging from the under side of the trunk of\r\na large tree that was bent over the stream, but on getting possession of\r\nit, it proved to be a new, and, perhaps, a still more beautiful species.\r\nI have named it _Cereus Russellianus_, in honour of His Grace the late\r\nDuke of Bedford, one of the most liberal supporters of my mission to\r\nBrazil: it has since been introduced to the hot-houses of England. A\r\nlittle way further up the stream, by the side of a small waterfall,\r\nand on a slanting bank near it, grew great abundance of a fine dark\r\nred-flowered _Amaryllis_. This spot is one of the most charming I have\r\never seen. The bed of the stream is about ten feet broad, but it is\r\nonly during heavy rains that the water covers this space; at this time\r\nthe stream was little more than perceptible. The water falls over three\r\nsuccessive shelves of granite, each about eight feet high, the faces of\r\nwhich are covered with mosses. Along the stream at the bottom of the\r\nfall there are several middle-sized trees, the branches of which are\r\nfestooned with the long branches of a _Fuchsia_, loaded with splendid\r\ncrimson flowers. By the side of the fall there are several bushes of a\r\nlarge-flowered _Pleroma_, and, along with them, a few of a red-blossomed\r\n_Esterhazya_, and a broad thick-leaved species of _Clusia_ (_C.\r\nfragrans_, Gard.), loading the atmosphere with a delightful odour arising\r\nfrom its large white blossoms; beneath these grow the _Amaryllis_, an\r\n_Eryngium_, several _Tillandsias_, and many _Ferns_. Having gained the\r\nupper part of the fall, I found a space, extending to a considerable\r\ndistance on each side and for some way up the mountain, destitute of\r\ntrees—nothing but bare portions of rock, with occasional masses of\r\nlow shrubs and herbaceous plants. Among the _Orchideæ_, the beautiful\r\n_Zygopetalon Mackaii_ and the odoriferous _Maxillaria picta_ were not\r\nthe least common. Darkness now beginning to set in, I returned to the\r\nencampment, where I found a large fire lighted; the evening was so fine\r\nthat I considered the erection of a hut unnecessary, and lay down about\r\neight P.M., on a few palm leaves by the fire, with my Poncho round me, to\r\npass the night.\r\n\r\nWhen I arose next morning at daybreak, I found the thermometer at 46°.\r\nWhile breakfast was preparing I again went out to botanize, but added\r\nlittle more than a few Ferns to my collection of the previous evening.\r\nOur journey to the place where we slept was of very gradual ascent; we\r\nhad now to commence the _ascent proper_ of the peaks. Leaving behind all\r\nthat was not actually necessary to be taken along with us, we began our\r\njourney by passing the waterfall, and walking up the bed of the stream,\r\nalong the gently sloping face of a granite rock; the ascent of several\r\nparts of this was rather difficult, having to crawl up on our hands\r\nand knees; after half an hour’s hard work we reached a comparatively\r\nflat wooded spot. On the steep part I collected, in moist places, an\r\n_Eriocaulon_, a small _Sun-Dew_, and a new genus belonging to the\r\n_Gentian_ tribe; among these grew also the curious _Burmannia bicolor_.\r\nIn passing through the wood above mentioned, I saw plenty of my new\r\n_Cactus_ growing on the stems of the larger trees, whilst the rocks were\r\ncovered with _Gesnerias_, and different kinds of _Orchidaceous_ plants.\r\nEmerging from the wood we encountered another steep rocky place, almost\r\nentirely covered with a large pine-apple-like _Tillandsia_, above which\r\nrose a few plants of a fine large scarlet-flowered shrubby _Salvia_ (_S.\r\nBenthamiana_, Gardn.), and a pale-blossomed _Virgularia_. On a nearly\r\nbare portion of the rock, grew several patches of a large herbaceous\r\nplant, belonging to the tribe of the _Gentians_; it grows from a foot\r\nto two feet high, with thick succulent glaucous leaves, the upper ones\r\nconnate, and from out of which proceed about half a dozen pedicels,\r\neach bearing a single large flower, the calyx of which is much inflated\r\nand tinged with purple; it is the _Prepusa connata_, Gardn. The only\r\npreviously known species was found by Martius, on a large mountain range\r\nbetween the Diamond country and Bahia; a third was afterwards discovered\r\non the very summit of the Organ Mountains. Passing this place, we again\r\nentered a wooded tract, where we found many Tapir paths, as we had\r\nalso done the day previous in the woods through which we passed, which\r\nrendered our progress much quicker than it otherwise would have been,\r\nas the branches above only require to be cut away to make a good road.\r\nJudging from the abundance of the tracts which we here met with, the\r\nTapir must be a very common animal in this remote and solitary part of\r\nthe mountains; here they are as yet out of the reach of the hunter, who\r\ncommits great havock among those which inhabit the lower woods, and there\r\nis also abundance of herbage to supply them with food. In passing through\r\nthis wood, one of the blacks shot a _Jacutinga_ (_Penelope Jacutinga_,\r\nSpix), and I collected specimens of a few Orchidaceous plants, and a\r\nlarge yellow-flowered _Senecio_.\r\n\r\nLeaving the wood we came upon a slanting _Sphagnum_ bog, in which\r\ngrew some very alpine-looking shrubs; these consisted chiefly of a\r\nProteaceous-like _Baccharis_, a _Vaccinium_, an _Andromeda_, the\r\n_Lavoisiera imbricata_, remarkable for its large flowers and small\r\nleaves, and a _Pleroma_; among the moss, an _Eriocaulon_, and a handsome\r\n_Utricularia_ with large cordate leaves and purple flowers, grew in\r\ngreat profusion. Judging from the top of the mountain, we were now at\r\nan elevation of nearly 6,000 feet. Leaving it, we commenced a very\r\nsteep ascent covered principally with low shrubs; we continued our way\r\nfor about an hour through this stunted vegetation, making but slow\r\nprogress, although we were much facilitated by having the path of the\r\nTapir to crawl up. By following this track we reached a point from which\r\na beautiful prospect of the low country was obtained, particularly to\r\nthe eastward, where, as far as the eye could reach, it was one mass of\r\nconical-shaped hills, only one ridge rising to any considerable height\r\nabove the rest; the point we had attained was the summit of one of the\r\nmany peaks which form the upper range of the Organ Mountains. At about a\r\nquarter of a mile distant stood what I then believed to be the highest\r\npeak, and certainly not more than three or four hundred feet above us;\r\nbut between the two peaks lay a deep densely-wooded ravine. It being now\r\npast two o’clock in the afternoon, it was too late to think of ascending\r\nthat day, so I determined to remain where we were for the night, and\r\nattempt it next day, but the blacks refused to do so, on account of no\r\nwater being nearer than a little above where we had slept the previous\r\nnight. As I could not force them to remain, I was, much against my will,\r\nobliged to abandon all idea of reaching the summit at this time. Not\r\nhaving a barometer with me, I endeavoured to ascertain the boiling point\r\nof water, but in doing so, broke the tube of the thermometer. Four years\r\nlater, during a visit of six days to the peaks, I was more fortunate;\r\nof that excursion an account will be found in a subsequent part of the\r\npresent work. The summit of the peak on which we now were, was quite a\r\nlittle flower-garden; a pretty _Fuchsia_, in full flower, was trailing\r\nover the bare rocks; in their clefts grew a handsome _Amaryllis_, and\r\non all sides numerous flowering shrubs. The coolness of the air and the\r\nstillness were quite refreshing; not a sound was to be heard; and the\r\nonly animals to be seen were a few small birds, so tame that they allowed\r\nus to come quite close to them. After partaking of a slight repast we\r\ncommenced our downward journey, and reached our encampment just as night\r\nwas setting in. Next day, following the route by which we had come, we\r\narrived at the Fazenda about four o’clock in the afternoon, groaning\r\nunder our loads.\r\n\r\nAbout a week after our return, I made another visit to the place where\r\nwe had formerly encamped; my object was to obtain additional specimens\r\nof the many new plants which I had found in the neighbourhood. On this\r\noccasion I was again accompanied by “Pai Felipe” and the other three\r\nblacks; we left the Fazenda at eight o’clock in the morning, and reached\r\nour sleeping place about three in the afternoon. On the following day\r\nI occupied myself with making excursions in various directions; during\r\nthese walks I collected great plenty of _Cereus Russellianus_. This plant\r\noffers a good example of nearly allied species representing each other\r\nin different regions of the same mountain; during the many times that I\r\npassed through the woods, on my journey to and from the peaks, I always\r\nfound _Cereus truncatus_ confined to the dense virgin forests below the\r\nelevation of 4,500 feet, while from this point to nearly the summit of\r\nthe mountains, _Cereus Russellianus_ alone was seen, enjoying a more\r\nopen and a cooler region. The day was one of the most delightful that I\r\never remember to have witnessed, quite like one of the finest days of\r\nan English summer; the sky was clear and unclouded, and the atmosphere\r\nbeing free from that haze which often, in the finest weather, renders the\r\nview of distant objects indistinct, allowed us to obtain a perfect and\r\nwell-defined prospect of the high mountains far to the eastward. Having\r\ngot all my specimens put into paper, I lay down to sleep shortly after\r\nseven o’clock, little dreaming what a miserable night I was to spend. I\r\nhad just fallen asleep by the fire, on my bed of palm leaves, when I was\r\nsuddenly aroused from my slumber by a deluge of rain pouring down; one\r\nof those sudden and heavy thunder-storms, which are never witnessed in\r\ntemperate climes, was passing over us. Had we been in an open place, we\r\nmight have seen it approaching and been able to form some kind of shelter\r\nbefore it came on, but the tops of the trees by which we were covered\r\nprevented this. I never was out in such weather; the flashing of the\r\nlightning, the rolling of the thunder, which was breaking immediately\r\nover us, the roaring of the wind among the trees, and the falling of\r\nrotten branches, all combined to render the scene terrific. In a few\r\nminutes our large fire was extinguished, and the place swimming with\r\nwater; although I was covered with a thick Poncho, it was but a poor\r\nprotection for such a night. In half an hour the small stream beside us,\r\nwhich during the day had only a few inches of water, came roaring down\r\nlike a cataract. To add to our misery, the night was pitch dark, so that\r\nwe could not see to remedy our situation. What a night I spent may be\r\nimagined, when I mention that I sat from half-past seven in the evening\r\ntill nearly three o’clock in the morning, under an incessant deluge of\r\nrain; a more perfect picture of patience, I flatter myself, could not\r\nbe witnessed. About three it began to abate, and being in a shivering\r\ncondition from the cold and wet, we made several attempts to kindle a\r\nfire, but without success: everything was too wet to burn, and we were\r\ntherefore obliged to content ourselves without one. By seating myself\r\nat the root of a tree, and leaning my back against it, I managed, at\r\nfour different times, to obtain about an hour’s sleep, but constantly\r\nawoke cold and shivering. Never was I so glad as when the first rays of\r\ndaylight were seen streaming through the trees; and, as soon as we could\r\nsee, we lost no time in preparing to return home. Shortly after we did\r\nstart, it began to rain, and continued till we reached the Fazenda, at\r\ntwo o’clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of my six month’s residence on the Mountains, the\r\ncottages were generally crowded with visitors. There was, consequently,\r\nmuch gaiety, it being seldom that an evening party was not held at one\r\nor the other of them, where nearly the whole of the residents assembled.\r\nThen there were frequent Pic-nic parties to different distant parts of\r\nthe estate, and, when the weather permitted, delightful evening rides. In\r\nthis manner many of my leisure hours, which otherwise must have passed\r\naway very dully, were most agreeably spent. Indeed, I still look back\r\nupon these few months as one of the most happy periods of my life, for\r\nindependently of those pleasant pastimes, I was daily occupied with a\r\nfavourite pursuit, and that, too, in a field which was all but new.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nBAHIA AND PERNAMBUCO.\r\n\r\n    Departure from Rio de Janeiro—Arrival at Bahia—Description of\r\n    this City—Voyage to Pernambuco—Jangadas—Description of the\r\n    City and Environs of Pernambuco—The Jesuits—The Peasantry—Town\r\n    of Olinda—Its Colleges and Botanic Garden—Visit to the\r\n    Village of Monteiro—The German Colony of Catucá—The Island of\r\n    Itamaricá—Pilar—Salt-works of Jaguaripe—Prevalent Diseases in\r\n    the Island—Its Fisheries—Peculiar Mode of Capture.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the tenth of June, 1837, I arrived in Rio from the Organ Mountains,\r\nand during the remainder of that month, July, August, and the early\r\npart of September, occupied myself in arranging and packing the\r\ncollections brought down with me, and in making a few excursions in the\r\nneighbourhood. Having at length despatched everything for England, I took\r\na passage for Pernambuco in H.M. Packet Opossum, being now desirous to\r\nexplore the northern provinces. We sailed from Rio on the fifteenth of\r\nSeptember and after a passage of thirteen days, during which we had much\r\nbad weather and contrary winds, reached Bahia. At three o’clock P.M., on\r\nthe twenty-eighth, we came to an anchor in the bay opposite the city, and\r\nabout a mile distant from it. As the land along this part of the coast\r\nrises only a few hundred feet above the level of the sea, it is not seen\r\nat so great a distance as the high lands are at Rio. In sailing up the\r\nbay, we kept pretty close to the shore, and I could not help remarking\r\nthe great luxuriance of the vegetation. Cocoa-nut trees and other large\r\npalms are very abundant, and the mango trees are both larger and more\r\nnumerous than those about Rio. The city of Bahia, when first seen, has a\r\nvery imposing appearance, the greater part of it being built on the face\r\nof a hill, which rises about 500 feet above the sea, and the houses,\r\nmost of which are of several stories, are all white-washed externally.\r\nThe effect is much heightened by the great number of banana, orange, and\r\ncocoa-nut trees which are intermingled with the houses, the dark green\r\nleaves contrasting well with the white, and affording a pleasant relief\r\nto the eye. The Packet being allowed to remain here forty-eight hours,\r\nfor the preparation of the mails for Pernambuco and England, I went on\r\nshore shortly after our arrival, with some of the other passengers.\r\n\r\nThe city of Bahia, sometimes called San Salvador, is situated in the\r\nbay which is known by the name of “Todos os Santos.” It is divided\r\ninto an upper and a lower town; the lower is built on the narrow slip\r\nof land that lies between the sea and the rising ground on which the\r\nupper town stands. It consists chiefly of one long street, which is\r\nboth narrow, badly paved, and dirty. The houses are mostly high, and\r\nthose adjoining the shore project considerably into the sea. After\r\nviewing this commercial portion of the city, we proceeded to the upper\r\ntown. As the streets which form the communication between them are too\r\nperpendicular to allow the use of carriages, those who do not choose to\r\nwalk are carried in a kind of covered chair slung on a pole, which is\r\nborne on the shoulders of two negroes. These “Cadeiras” are commonly used\r\nboth by ladies and gentlemen, and can always be hired in the streets.\r\nWe, however, preferred walking, and after passing through some of the\r\nprincipal streets, and visiting the inside of one of the large churches\r\nwe strayed out a little way into the country, delighted with the rich and\r\npleasing aspect which it afforded. In the evening we visited the reading\r\nroom of the Literary Society, where we found a few of the newspapers,\r\nand many of the literary and scientific journals of France, England, and\r\nthe United States. After a short stay, we went to a large hotel opposite\r\nthe theatre, where we took up our quarters for the night; but, what with\r\nthe uncomfortable beds, the rattling of dice, and the still louder clink\r\nof dollars, in an apartment immediately below us, which continued till\r\nnearly four o’clock in the morning, our night’s rest was not of the most\r\nrefreshing nature.\r\n\r\nOn the forenoon of the following day, we visited a convent towards the\r\nwest end of the city, where the nuns make artificial flowers for sale,\r\nfrom the feathers of birds. We were shown into a small room, separated\r\nfrom the body of the building by a thick wall, through which the traffic\r\ntakes place by means of a large grated window. We were soon surrounded\r\nby wreaths of all kinds and colours suited for head dresses, either\r\nsent round to us in baskets, or pushed, one by one, through the grating\r\non a stick. It is the duty of each nun in her turn to officiate as\r\nsales-woman, whenever purchasers visit the convent, the flowers being\r\nbrought to her by the servants of the establishment, who are either black\r\nor brown girls; the one upon whom this duty fell at the period of our\r\nvisit was neither young nor beautiful, and destroyed all my romantic\r\nnotions regarding nuns and nunneries. Several purchases were made by my\r\ncompanions with a view of taking them as presents to England.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the convent, I hired a boat in order to proceed a few miles\r\nfurther up the bay, and landed on a peninsula called Bomfim, across which\r\nI walked, accompanied by one of the two blacks belonging to the boat,\r\nthe distance being rather less than two miles. After leaving the shore,\r\non which grew _Sophora tomentosa_ and _Eugenia Michelii_, two shrubs\r\ncommon all along the coast of Brazil, I passed through a marsh containing\r\nseveral species of plants that were new to me. Beyond this, the road\r\npassed through a dry sandy hollow, in which not a breath of air was to\r\nbe felt, and the rays of the mid-day sun, reflected from the white sand,\r\nhad so heated the atmosphere, that I was almost suffocated before I could\r\nreach a little eminence at the other end of it. Here, also, I enriched my\r\ncollections, and still further on I found the thistle-like _Ampherephis\r\naristata_ growing commonly by the road-sides; and some large pools in a\r\nmarsh, under the shade of a thicket of giant palms, were quite covered\r\nover with _Pistia stratiotes_, a plant nearly related to the Duck-weeds\r\nof England, but of a much larger size; other pools were gay with the\r\nyellow flowers of _Limnanthemum Humboldtianum_. After reaching the shore\r\nI walked along it a little way, and then returned to the boat by a\r\ndifferent route. In passing through a swampy place at the foot of a hill,\r\non which a large church stands, I found a few specimens of the beautiful\r\n_Angelonia hirsuta_, with its long spikes of large blue flowers. I\r\nafterwards met with several new species of this fine genus, some of\r\nwhich, raised from seeds sent home by me, are now common in hot-houses.\r\n\r\nDuring this walk I observed some very large mango trees, many of them\r\ntwice the size of those growing about Rio. These trees have a handsome\r\nappearance when seen at a distance, surrounding the numerous white-washed\r\ncountry houses; the trunk, which is often of great thickness, seldom\r\nrises above eight or ten feet above the ground, when it branches into\r\nmany widely-spreading ramifications, which rise to a great height, and\r\nare so densely covered with leaves as to be impenetrable to the burning\r\nrays of the sun, thus forming a most agreeable and luxuriant shade. At\r\nthree o’clock we returned to the boat, well loaded with my day’s spoil.\r\nIn the evening I dined with a gentleman to whom I brought letters from\r\nRio, and there met a young Scotchman, who invited me to sleep at his\r\nhouse. Next morning he accompanied me a short way into the country; we\r\nstarted a little before six o’clock, walked to the distance of about\r\nsix miles, and reached the city again by a different route before ten.\r\nThe country inland, so far as I could observe, forms a sort of elevated\r\ntable-land of a gently undulating nature, and the appearance of the\r\nvegetation bespeaks great richness of soil. Besides great plenty of large\r\nmango trees, I observed many jacks (_Artocarpus integrifolius_) of almost\r\nequal size, the trunks and large branches of which were loaded with\r\ntheir large yellow-coloured fruit. This tree is very much cultivated in\r\nthis part of Brazil, and, I was told, that a few years before my visit,\r\nduring a scarcity of provisions in the province, its fruit, which is\r\nyielded in the greatest abundance, was the means of preventing a famine\r\namong the black population. On our return to the city, we passed a small\r\nvillage close by the sea, the inhabitants of which, principally blacks,\r\nare mostly occupied in whale fishing, the sperm whale being rather\r\nplentiful on this part of the coast. On entering the bay, we observed a\r\nnumber of whale boats going out, manned by negroes. On visiting Bahia,\r\none circumstance which forcibly strikes the attention of a stranger,\r\neven coming from the other provinces of Brazil, is the appearance of the\r\nblacks met with in the streets; they are the finest to be seen in the\r\ncountry, both men and women being tall and well-formed, and generally\r\nintelligent, some of them even, as I have elsewhere observed, being\r\ntolerable Arabic scholars. They have nearly all been imported from the\r\nGold Coast, and, not only from their greater physical strength and\r\nintelligence, but from being united among themselves, they are more\r\ninclined to insurrectionary movements than the mixed races in the other\r\nprovinces. Only a fortnight after I left Bahia a serious insurrection\r\ntook place, headed, indeed, by white Brazilians, but supported by most of\r\nthe black population; they kept possession of the city for many months,\r\nnor were they fully dispossessed of it till after the destruction of much\r\nlife and property.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st, at 3 o’clock in the afternoon, we set sail for Pernambuco.\r\nOn the second night after we left, while I was walking the quarter-deck\r\nwith the captain, the watch forward reported a sail close on the\r\nweather-bow; the crew were immediately piped to quarters, and in less\r\nthan five minutes were all on deck ready for action. Shortly afterwards\r\nwe saw the vessel pass us at some distance and disappear. As these\r\npackets generally carry home a large amount of specie to England, it\r\nwas not without reason that the captain prepared himself for what might\r\nhappen, especially on a coast where suspicious craft are not unfrequently\r\nhovering about. There was something exciting in this little incident, and\r\nit afforded matter for conversation on the following day.\r\n\r\nAfter a passage of nine days, land was descried early in the morning from\r\nthe mast-head, and in the course of a few hours we could see it from\r\nthe deck, rising above the horizon like a long black cloud. On nearing\r\nthe coast, it presented a very flat and barren-like aspect, forming a\r\ngreat and unpromising contrast to the magnificent entry to the bay of\r\nRio de Janeiro. The town being built nearly on a level with the sea, we\r\ncould only obtain a view of that portion of it which immediately skirts\r\nthe shore, the houses and the cocoa-nut trees appearing above the\r\nhorizon. No part of the coast within many leagues of Pernambuco rises\r\nto any height, except that whereon the old town, called Olinda, stands,\r\nand which is situated about three miles north of Recife, the name of\r\nthe seaport. While standing in for the harbour, we passed a number of\r\nfishing-boats, of a very peculiar construction; they are called Jangadas,\r\nand formed of four, or more, logs of wood lashed together, having a mast\r\nand a very large sail, a fixed stool-like seat, but no bulwarks, so that\r\nthe waves constantly break over them; they sail with remarkable speed,\r\nand often venture to a great distance from land. A few of the same craft\r\nmay be seen at Bahia, but none at Rio. The light wood of which they are\r\nformed is obtained from a species of _Apeiba_, a genus allied to our own\r\nLinden-tree. We anchored in the outer roads about 12 o’clock, and after\r\nthe lapse of an hour and a half, a pilot came on board, and conducted\r\nus into the harbour, which is quite a natural one, being formed by a\r\nreef that runs along the coast, at a little distance from the shore;\r\nthe entrance is through a breach, upon the south side of which is a\r\nlight-house and a small fort. A very heavy swell runs outside the reef\r\nand breaks over it, but there is always calm water within; and at full\r\ntide it is sufficiently deep to float the largest merchant vessels that\r\nvisit the port.\r\n\r\nThe town of Pernambuco has few recommendations to those who are not\r\nengaged in business. The houses are higher than those at Rio, the\r\nstreets for the most part still more narrow, and certainly quite as\r\ndirty. In nearly all the towns and cities of Brazil, rain is the only\r\nscavenger, and by it the streets are kept tolerably clean in such of\r\nthem as are built on declivities, but this, unfortunately, is not the\r\ncase with Pernambuco; in the wet season, the streets are full of mud\r\nand water, and in the dry, the mud is converted into clouds of dust. It\r\nhas always appeared extraordinary to me that epidemic diseases do not\r\nprevail to a much greater extent than they do under such circumstances.\r\nThe town consists of three great divisions: that in which the principal\r\ntrade is carried on, is situated on a narrow neck of land, which runs\r\ndown between the sea and a river from Olinda, and is called Recife;\r\nanother principally occupied with shops, and containing the palace of\r\nthe President, is built on an island, and is known by the name of St.\r\nAntonio; the third, called Boa Vista, consisting principally of one long\r\nstreet, is constructed on the mainland, and is by far the finest part of\r\nthe whole. These are all connected by means of two wooden bridges.\r\n\r\nAs Pernambuco is situated on the most eastern part of the American\r\ncontinent, it is fully exposed to the influence of the trade winds\r\nall the year round, and hence enjoys a cool climate; it is considered\r\nmore healthy than either Rio or Bahia. Except two or three churches it\r\ncontains but few public buildings, and, at the period of my visit, it had\r\nnot a single hotel of any description. The Palace in which the affairs\r\nof the provincial government are now carried on, was in former times the\r\nJesuits’ College, and stands on the banks of the river; it is a large\r\nbuilding of gloomy appearance, with walls of enormous thickness. When it\r\nwas erected by these enterprising and charitable men, they little dreamed\r\nthat their career was to terminate at so early a period as it did. It\r\nis handed down from father to son, particularly among the middle and\r\nlower classes of Brazil, that the destruction of Jesuitical power was a\r\nsevere loss to the well-being of the country. There are of course but\r\nfew alive now who formed the Company of Jesus, but the memory of them\r\nwill long remain; I have always heard them spoken of with respect and\r\nwith regret. What different men they must have been from the degraded\r\nrace who now undertake the spiritual welfare of this nation! It is a hard\r\nthing to say, but I do it not without well considering the nature of the\r\nassertion, that the present clergy of Brazil are more debased and immoral\r\nthan any other class of men. However much the Jesuits were slandered and\r\npersecuted from the jealousy of those who envied the respect in which\r\nthey were held by their flocks, and the confidence which they reposed in\r\nthem, enough of the good still remains to shame those who have succeeded\r\nthem. More than one nation of Indians in Brazil, which, in the time of\r\nthe Jesuits, had renounced their savage life and become Christians, have,\r\nsince their suppression, returned to the condition from which, at so\r\nmuch risk and with so much labour, they had been redeemed. Whatever were\r\nthe motives of the Jesuits, they are judged of in Brazil, not by them,\r\nbut by their good works.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the town of Pernambuco resemble very much those\r\nof Rio, but there is a great difference in the appearance of the\r\ncountry people, which here, as elsewhere, are easily distinguished\r\nfrom the citizens. Those seen in the streets of Rio de Janeiro are\r\na tall handsome race of men, mostly from the mining districts, or\r\nthe more southerly province of San Paulo; their dress consists of a\r\nlinen jacket and trowsers, generally of a blue colour, brown leather\r\nboots, which are firmly tied round the leg a little above the knee,\r\nand a very high crowned broad-brimmed white straw hat. Those, on the\r\ncontrary, who frequent the city of Pernambuco, are a more swarthy and\r\nmore diminutive race, but still far superior in appearance to the puny\r\ncitizens. There are two classes of them, the Matúto and the Sertanejo:\r\nthe Matútos inhabit the low flat country, which extends from the coast\r\nup to the high land of the interior, called the Sertão, or desert,\r\nwhich gives name to, and is inhabited by, the Sertanejos. The dress of\r\nboth for the most part, but of the latter in particular, consists of a\r\nlow round-crowned broad-brimmed hat, jacket, and trowsers, made of a\r\nyellowish brown-coloured leather, that manufactured from the skin of the\r\ndifferent kinds of deer being preferred; in place of a waistcoat they\r\nvery frequently wear a triangular piece of the same kind of leather,\r\nfastened round the neck and middle by cords of the same material. The\r\nboots in use in the province of Rio are unknown here, and either shoes or\r\nslippers, also of brown leather, are worn instead. The Matúto generally\r\ndispenses with the leather trowsers and shoes, using in place of them a\r\npair of wide cotton drawers, which reach only a little below the knee,\r\nthe legs remaining bare. Cotton and hides are the principal articles\r\nbrought from the interior, and horses are the only beasts of burden,\r\nmules being as rarely used for that purpose here, as horses are in the\r\nsouthern provinces. Each horse carries two large bales of cotton as well\r\nas the driver, who places himself between them, stretching his legs\r\nforward on a level with his seat.\r\n\r\nUpon landing in Pernambuco, I found Dr. Loudon, a Scotch physician\r\nresident in that city, awaiting my arrival, who kindly invited me\r\nto remain with him during my stay; and as he had then been sixteen\r\nyears in the place, and was acquainted with most of the influential\r\npeople, both foreign and Brazilian, I derived much advantage from his\r\nfriendship, more particularly so, as he was very partial to the pursuit\r\nof natural history. Shortly after my arrival I delivered the letters\r\nof recommendation given me by Mr. Hamilton, the British Minister at\r\nthe court of Rio, to Mr. Watts, the Consul, who obligingly offered to\r\nintroduce me to the President of the province, Senhor Vicente Thomaz\r\nPires de Figueredo Comargo. The permission to wait upon his Excellency\r\nhaving been given a few days afterwards, I accompanied Mr. Watts to\r\nthe palace, together with Dr. Loudon, who was a personal friend of the\r\nPresident. He received me with great kindness, and when the object of\r\nmy visit to the country was explained to him, he promised to afford all\r\nthe assistance in his power, and, in the meantime, gave me a letter to\r\nDr. Serpa, the Professor of Botany and Curator of the Botanic Garden at\r\nOlinda.\r\n\r\nI was accompanied in my visit to Olinda by Mr. Nash, a young Englishman,\r\nto whom I was indebted for many acts of kindness during my visit at\r\nPernambuco. There are three routes to Olinda from Recife; one along\r\nthe shore, which is seldom taken on account of the loose sandy nature\r\nof the soil, and the complete exposure of the traveller to the sun.\r\nAnother is by canoes, up the stream before mentioned by which the surplus\r\nwater from a large lake behind Olinda is discharged into the sea; this\r\nstream runs parallel with the shore, from which it is separated by a\r\nhigh sand-bank, and is fringed on each side by a strip of mangroves,\r\nthe mud in which they grow emitting at low tide a very disagreeable\r\neffluvium, and abounding in crabs of various sizes and colours, while\r\nclouds of mosquitos always hover around and harbour among the branches.\r\nThe third route, which we pursued, runs parallel with the river, at a\r\nconsiderable distance inland. This road is quite level, and at both ends\r\nare seen several fine country houses, though much of it passes through\r\nuncultivated, and often marshy land. Occasionally it is enclosed by\r\nMimosa hedges, in which is seen a slender kind of Jasmine (_Jasminum\r\nBahiense_, DC.), whose white flowers at the early hour we passed were\r\nperfuming the air with their delightful fragrance. The road-side was gay\r\nwith the large pale yellow flowers of _Turnera trioniflora_, and the\r\ndelicate pink heads of a sensitive plant. Several different kinds of this\r\nlatter plant grow very abundantly all over the northern parts of Brazil.\r\nShelley has truly said, that\r\n\r\n    “The sensitive plant has no bright flower,\r\n    Radiance and odour are not its dower,”—\r\n\r\nyet there are few in the whole range of the vegetable kingdom, which are\r\nso much an object of curiosity to all observers, or of so much interest\r\nto the physiologist. On approaching Olinda, I was delighted to find the\r\nsurface of the lake—which abounds in alligators—covered with thousands\r\nof the splendid large white blossoms and broad floating leaves of a\r\nwater-lily (_Nymphæa ampla_, DC.), and intermingled with them, the yellow\r\nflowers of _Limnocharis Commersonii_, and a large _Utricularia_.\r\n\r\nThe Botanic Garden is situated in a hollow, behind the town of Olinda,\r\nand, though of considerable size, has only a portion of it under\r\ncultivation; the residence of the Professor stands nearly in the centre.\r\nWe found Dr. Serpa in his study, a rather large apartment, which he uses\r\nalso as a lecture-room; he appeared to be about sixty years of age, and\r\nwe were impressed with his agreeable manners and intelligence. Besides\r\nhis other duties, he had the principal medical practice in Olinda. A\r\nfew French works on Botany, Natural History, Agriculture, and Medicine,\r\ncomposed the chief part of his limited library. It was here that I first\r\nsaw the ‘Flora Fluminensis,’ a work published at the expense of the\r\nBrazilian government. The drawings from which the plates were executed,\r\nwere prepared at Rio de Janeiro about the end of the last century, under\r\nthe direction of a Jesuit of the name of Vellozo. It cost £70,000, and,\r\nto use the words of Dr. Von Martius, is “a strange publication, which\r\nmay be held up as an example of an ill-advised literary undertaking,\r\nand on so great a scale that it ought never to have been commenced.\r\nEleven huge volumes, with about fifteen hundred plates, constitute\r\nthis bulky work, whose usefulness is, alas! not in proportion to the\r\nexpense it occasioned.”[4] The Doctor accompanied us in a walk round the\r\nGarden, which I found to contain little worthy of notice; a few European\r\nmedicinal plants, struggling for existence, and some large Indian trees,\r\nbeing its principal productions; among the latter, however, were fine\r\nspecimens of the Mango, Tamarind, Cinnamon, and the Date-Palm. He had\r\nlately received from the interior, plants of a species of Ipecacuanha,\r\nthe roots of which form an article of export from Pernambuco, and the\r\nliving specimens which I obtained from him are now growing freely in the\r\nstoves of the Glasgow Botanic Garden. They appear different from the\r\none figured and described by St. Hilaire, from the south of Brazil, and\r\nwill, I suspect, prove to be a distinct, though nearly related species.\r\nLeaving the garden, we walked a little way into the country, where I\r\nhoped to meet with something more interesting; and in this expectation I\r\nwas not disappointed, as many new plants were added to my collections. On\r\nthe dry bushy hills in this neighbourhood a wild fruit-tree grows very\r\nplentifully; it is the Mangába of the Brazilians, and the _Hancornia\r\nspeciosa_ of botanists; it is a small tree belonging to the Natural\r\nOrder _Apocyneæ_, the small leaves and drooping branches of which give\r\nit somewhat the resemblance of the weeping birch. The fruit is about the\r\nsize of a large plum, of a yellow colour, but streaked a little with red\r\non one side, and the flavour is most delicious.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we returned to Olinda, to dine with another gentleman\r\nto whom I also carried letters, Senhor da Cunha. He had been educated\r\nin England, and was an intelligent man. After dinner we walked out to\r\nsee the town, which is very pleasantly situated on an eminence not far\r\nfrom the sea. It is a place of considerable size, and in the olden time\r\nmust have been a stirring one, particularly as regards the clergy,\r\njudging from the number of churches, convents, monasteries, &c. It has\r\nnow, however, a deserted and desolate appearance, many fine houses being\r\nuntenanted and falling to decay, and the streets are grown over with\r\ngrass and weeds. On the outskirts of the seaward side of the town, there\r\nare the ruins of a large monastery, which we went to see on account of\r\na hermit who had lived there upwards of seventeen years. We found it to\r\nbe a very large building, consisting of a church in the centre, still\r\nin use, and two wings, containing the apartments formerly inhabited\r\nby the friars, which are fast running into decay, particularly those\r\nin the south wing. The north wing is in much better repair, having a\r\nfew good rooms, which are inhabited by some of the students attending\r\na theological and medical school, established in Olinda. Along the\r\ncorridors, and in some of the larger rooms, are still a few paintings,\r\nbut in a state of much decay. While surveying this great fabric, we could\r\nnot help thinking of the contrast it now offers to the times, not long\r\ngone by, when its walls re-echoed to the footsteps and prayers of the\r\ndevotees of a religion, which was then in a much more flourishing state\r\nthan it now is, over nearly the whole of the empire of Brazil.\r\n\r\nIt was among the ruins of the south wing that the hermit lived. We\r\nvisited the room in which he was said to be generally found, but he\r\nwas not there. We then passed through a small court nearly choked with\r\nrubbish, and entered a large dark room, partly filled with old bricks\r\nand lime. Upon the floor of this wretched apartment we found him lying,\r\npresenting a most miserable appearance. His only covering consisted of a\r\npiece of thin black cloth wrapped round his body, his head, arms, legs,\r\nand feet being bare. He appeared to be about sixty years of age, but his\r\nlong grey hair and beard made him look older, perhaps, than he really\r\nwas. He was moaning and otherwise seemed to be in great agony, and it\r\nwas with some difficulty he told us that two days before, while walking\r\nacross the floor of the room above, it gave way, and he was precipitated\r\nto the place where we found him extended, and from which he was unable\r\nto move. We tried to raise him, but the slightest movement gave him\r\nexcruciating pain. As some of his bones seemed to be broken, a young\r\nman who had accompanied us, went off immediately to procure assistance,\r\nand have him taken to the hospital. All the information I could obtain\r\nrelating to this unfortunate being, was that at one time, he had been\r\nan officer in the army, and was now doing penance for a murder he had\r\ncommitted in his youth. We also visited a convent, the nuns belonging\r\nto which prepare preserved fruits for sale. Unlike the one I visited at\r\nBahia, we could only speak to, not see, those who were within. The fruit\r\nwas put upon a shelf of a revolving kind of cupboard, and in this manner\r\nsent out to us; the money and empty plates were returned in the same way.\r\nLike all the preserves I have met with in the country, those we had here\r\nwere spoiled with too much sugar.\r\n\r\nFor the first few days, my walks did not extend much beyond the suburbs\r\nof the town. The country being quite flat, the soil sandy, and the dry\r\nseason having commenced, the herbaceous vegetation in the more exposed\r\nsituations was beginning to suffer for want of rain. For many miles\r\nround the town, the Cocoa-nut and other large Palms grow in the greatest\r\nprofusion, mixed with fine trees of the Cashew-nut, then loaded with\r\ntheir curious and refreshing fruit of a yellow or reddish colour, and the\r\nJack, the Bread-fruit, and the Orange. Much attention, I observed, is\r\npaid to the gardens attached to the houses near the town, many of them\r\nbeing tastefully laid out, and adorned with beautiful shrubs, partly\r\nBrazilian and partly of Indian origin. The Mimosa and other hedges, as\r\nabout Rio, are festooned with climbers, among which the Cow-itch plant\r\n(_Stizolobium urens_) is the most abundant. There is also in many places\r\na large species of Dodder (_Cuscuta_), which climbs over the hedges\r\nwith its long yellow cord-like branches, and gives them a most singular\r\nappearance. The sea-coast yielded me many curious plants, particularly\r\none part of it about eight miles to the southward of the town, where the\r\nsoil for some distance inland is very sandy and covered with shrubs.\r\nThere I found in great plenty a new kind of those curious mossy Cacti\r\n(_Melocactus depressus_, Hook.); it was but a small one, being only\r\nabout four inches high, and eighteen in circumference.\r\n\r\nAbout a fortnight after my arrival at Pernambuco, Dr. Loudon removed to\r\nhis country house, situated on the banks of the Rio Capibaribe, about\r\nfour miles west from Recife; and, as the country round it was chiefly\r\nuncultivated, this afforded more ample scope for my researches. The Rio\r\nCapibaribe, which empties itself into the harbour at the Recife, is of\r\nsmall size, and is navigable only for canoes to a distance of about ten\r\nmiles from the town. The navigation for six miles, as far as Monteiro,\r\nis very pleasant, and the scenery is rendered more agreeable by the\r\nnumber of villas, surrounded by gardens, which are scattered along its\r\nbanks. Many of these houses are inhabited during the fine or dry season\r\nonly, when most of the wealthy citizens resort to them for the benefit\r\nof bathing in the river; for, in hot climates, fresh water is preferred,\r\nas bathing in salt water generally produces great irritation on the\r\nsurface of the body, from the salt crystallizing there, unless washed\r\noff with fresh water. For the purpose of bathing, each house has a large\r\nshed projecting into the river, the tops and sides of which are covered\r\nwith cocoa-nut leaves. They are mostly rebuilt every year, as they are\r\ngenerally carried away by the floods in the rainy season.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty miles to the westward of Pernambuco, there is a small German\r\nColony called Catucá; it was established about eighteen years before, at\r\na period when a German regiment, which had been in the service of the\r\nBrazilian government, was here disbanded, but it is now fast dwindling\r\ninto decay. The few families residing there gained a livelihood by the\r\nmanufacture of charcoal, which they carried to town for sale. Being\r\ndesirous of spending a day or two at this place, I started early one\r\nmorning in the beginning of November, accompanied by Mr. White, a young\r\ngentleman whom I had previously met on the Organ mountains. We were\r\nguided by two Germans who were returning from Pernambuco, and their\r\nhorses carried our luggage. Our route for about two hours was through\r\na flat country, principally planted with mandiocca, although a great\r\npart of it was still uncleared, only the large trees having been cut\r\ndown: a few of those remaining rose high above their fellows of the\r\nwood, and agreeably diversified the landscape. After passing through\r\nthis cultivated country, and ascending a slight eminence, we entered\r\nthe virgin forest. Previously the road had been of a sandy nature, but\r\nnow we found it to consist of hard red clay. Many of the trees were\r\nvery lofty, although they do not commonly attain the stature of those\r\nin the Province of Rio, nor have their trunks the same circumference.\r\nAmong the shrubs that grew below them, I observed a few _Melastomaceæ_,\r\n_Myrtaceæ_, and _Rubiaceæ_. Here everything betokened a drier atmosphere,\r\nand a more arid soil than at Rio. There were no _Ferns_, _Begonias_,\r\n_Pipers_, or _Orchidaceous_ plants. On the stems and branches of the\r\nlarger trees a few _Bromeliaceæ_ and _Aroideæ_ were alone to be seen.\r\nAfter riding for about an hour through this forest, we reached the\r\ncleared valley containing the cottages of the colonists, several of which\r\nwe passed before reaching the one in which we remained. These cottages\r\nare generally of small size, although much superior in cleanliness\r\nand neatness of arrangement to those belonging to the same class of\r\nBrazilians. At night we slung our hammocks in a small apartment, and\r\nenjoyed a sound sleep till morning.\r\n\r\nMy friend being desirous of having a few days’ shooting in the woods with\r\none of the Germans, I determined to accompany them, in the hope of making\r\nsome additions to my botanical stores. We set off early, entering the\r\nwood about a mile from the cottage. Here, as in similar situations near\r\nthe town, I observed a great deficiency of herbaceous vegetation, and in\r\na walk of about two hours collected only a few Ferns. In passing through\r\nthis wood, we saw an enormously large tree, a species of _Lecythis_; the\r\nground beneath it was covered with its curious pot-like capsules nearly\r\nas large as a man’s head, their resemblance to a pot being much increased\r\nby the large lid which falls off from the top of each when the seeds\r\nwithin are ripe. Most of those we saw were empty, the nuts having been\r\ntaken out by the monkeys, who are very fond of them. Leaving this wood,\r\nwe suddenly came upon another cleared valley, containing the ruins of\r\nseveral cottages; this, we were told, had been the first site of the\r\nsettlement, but as the colonists were forbidden to cut any more wood in\r\nthat direction, they moved their quarters to the place before mentioned.\r\nNear these dismantled dwellings we found abundance of pine-apples, and\r\nrefreshed ourselves with some which were ripe, sheltering ourselves from\r\nthe sun under the shade of an out-house which had formerly served as a\r\nplace for the preparation of farinha from the Mandiocca root. Near this\r\nplace I found two beautiful trees, one of them a species of _Vochysia_,\r\ncovered with long spikes of bright yellow flowers, and the other the\r\nsplendid _Moronobea coccinea_, literally covered with its globular\r\ncrimson blossoms. In returning I collected specimens of a yellow-flowered\r\n_Palicourea_, called Mata Rato, not, however, the same plant which is\r\nknown at Rio by the name of Erva do Rato. It proves, notwithstanding,\r\nthat poisonous qualities are attributed to different plants of the same\r\ngenus in different parts of the country.\r\n\r\nClose to the main land, and about thirty miles north from Pernambuco,\r\nthere is a small island called Itamaricá, which on account of its fine\r\nclimate and soil, and the abundance and superiority of the fruit produced\r\nthere, is designated the garden of Pernambuco. I was desirous of visiting\r\nthis place before leaving the province, and with this intention I started\r\nabout the middle of December, and considered myself fortunate in having\r\nas a companion Mr. Adamson, a young gentleman who had been some years in\r\nthe country, and was fond of botanical pursuits. To make the voyage, we\r\nhad to hire a Jangada, one of the raft boats so common on this part of\r\nthe coast; it was manned by a crew of three men. To a stranger it appears\r\na very singular kind of craft, and had I not been well assured that,\r\nprimitive as their construction seems, they are perfectly safe, I should\r\nhave felt some hesitation in embarking on one of them.\r\n\r\nHaving got our luggage properly placed on its elevated platform, so\r\nas to be out of the reach of the water, which continually washes over\r\nthese rafts, we commenced our voyage. The wind almost constantly blows\r\nat that season from the north-east, and consequently was nearly right\r\nagainst us, rendering it necessary to beat up between the reef and\r\nthe shore; the intermediate distance varying from a quarter of a mile\r\nto two miles, all the way from Recife to the island. By four o’clock\r\nin the afternoon, finding that the unfavourable wind prevented our\r\nperforming more than half the voyage, we determined to land at a small\r\nfishing village called Pao Amarello, and there pass the night. It was\r\nnot without some difficulty that we obtained a shelter wherein we could\r\nsling our hammocks; after meeting with several refusals, the owner of a\r\nsmall public-house (Venda) pointed out an empty hut made of cocoa-nut\r\nleaves, and permitted us to take possession of it for the night. Hither,\r\ntherefore, we moved our luggage, and after a supper of stewed fish and\r\nfarinha, slept soundly till daybreak. After getting up, we took a walk\r\na little way into the country; the soil we found to be sandy, and the\r\nherbaceous vegetation completely scorched up by the drought. At this\r\nplace the reef is about a mile distant from the shore, and is distinctly\r\nperceptible along its whole line, both at high and low water, for\r\nalthough the ebb tide leaves the rocks quite bare, the surf marks its\r\nposition even at the highest flow. The wind having now shifted more to\r\nthe eastward, we were enabled after breakfast to proceed on our voyage,\r\nand as we made much more rapid progress than on the preceding day, we\r\nreached the island at noon, and landed on the eastern side of it at\r\nPilar, the principal town.\r\n\r\nWe carried with us two or three letters of introduction, and the first\r\nwe delivered obtained us quarters. The name of our host was Alexander\r\nAlcantará, the proprietor of a large salt-work, of which there are\r\nseveral on the island. His house, like nearly all the others we saw,\r\nwas of one story, the walls consisting of a frame-work of wood, the\r\ninterstices of which were filled up with a kind of clay, and the roof\r\nwas covered with tiles; there were four good rooms in it, all floored\r\nwith boards; it was delightfully situated near the sea, and surrounded\r\nby cocoa-nut trees. In the afternoon we were taken by our host to see\r\nhis salt-works, which were established in a valley into which the tide\r\nflows at high water. The water from which the salt is made, is kept\r\nin large reservoirs, whence it is from time to time made to flow into\r\npits, where it is allowed to evaporate. At this place, which is called\r\nJaguaribe, there are twenty-four distinct manufactories, belonging to as\r\nmany individuals. The place where the water is evaporated is divided into\r\nsmall compartments, measuring sixteen feet by twelve. In that belonging\r\nto Senhor Alcantará, there are one hundred and twenty such compartments;\r\ninto each of these, two inches of water is allowed to flow from the large\r\nreservoir, and in eight days this is completely evaporated. It yields\r\nhim, altogether, annually, about four hundred alqueires of salt, each\r\nalqueire weighing eight arrobas, and each arroba thirty-two pounds. Three\r\nqualities are produced, the best being used for domestic purposes, a\r\nmiddle sort for curing fish and an inferior kind used principally to salt\r\nhides. On an average it brings about 2_s._ 6_d._ an alqueire, so that his\r\nwhole income from this source is only about 50_l._ a year. Besides the\r\nmanufactories at this place, there are others in different parts of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nThe island, which is separated from the main land by a strait about half\r\na league broad, is nearly three leagues in length, and from one and\r\na half to two in breadth. It contains only two small villages, viz.,\r\nItamaricá, situated on a height near the sea, on the south-east side,\r\ncontaining only about twenty houses; and Pilar, the place at which we\r\nlanded, formed of a few irregular streets, and containing about eighty\r\nhabitations. The whole number of houses in the island, we were told,\r\namounted to three hundred, and the entire population to about two\r\nthousand. Although there are many very comfortable looking dwellings, yet\r\nthe mass of the houses have a poor appearance, being either formed of\r\nwicker-work and mud, or of cocoa-nut leaves. As fishing is the principal\r\noccupation of the inhabitants, their houses are generally near the\r\nshore. The fish are mostly taken in pens (currals) that are constructed\r\nof stakes a little beyond low-water mark. Another source of income to\r\nthe inhabitants, is the cocoa-nut trees, which form a dense deep belt\r\nround the upper part of the island; both the fish and nuts are taken\r\nto Pernambuco for sale. In the interior of the island there are three\r\nsugar plantations; and several of the more wealthy of the inhabitants\r\ncultivate grapes and mangoes to a considerable extent, both of which\r\nsell well in Pernambuco, bringing a better price than those cultivated\r\nelsewhere in the province. Good grapes I bought at tenpence a pound,\r\nbut they give the cultivator a great deal of trouble, as the vines are\r\nsure to be attacked by a large brown ant, and stripped of their leaves\r\nin a single night, unless care be taken to have the lower part of the\r\nstem isolated by water. The whole of the province of Pernambuco is much\r\noverrun by these insects. During the time of our visit the mangoes were\r\njust getting into season, and I found them to be very much superior in\r\nflavour to any I had previously tasted; they are much smaller than those\r\ncultivated near Pernambuco, and very much resemble peaches in colour.\r\n\r\nDuring the few days we remained on the island we made many excursions\r\nthrough it in all directions; instead of the almost uniformly level\r\ncharacter of the country in the vicinity of Pernambuco, here there is\r\na gentle undulation of hill and dale. There is not much large timber,\r\nthe wooded portions generally consist of small trees and shrubs, which\r\ngive to many parts of the island an aspect more like that of an English\r\norchard, than an uncultivated equatorial region; some of the views we\r\nobtained from the hills, if not grand, were at least pleasing. Though\r\nthere are both a priest and a lawyer on the island, there is no medical\r\nman; and as soon as I was known to be one, my assistance was solicited\r\nfrom all quarters. The first individual I was requested to visit, was a\r\nman with a large abscess in the neck, from the suppuration of the right\r\nsubmaxillary gland; he could neither speak nor swallow, and his relatives\r\nthought him on the point of death. I opened the abscess, which gave him\r\ninstant relief, and next day when I called, he was sitting up, and able\r\nto overwhelm me with thanks for what he conceived to be a miraculous\r\ncure. This case so established my reputation, that I had more medical\r\npractice than I desired. Two of my patients were in the last stage of\r\nconsumption, but by far the greater proportion of the cases resulted from\r\nintermittent fever, chiefly arising from derangement of the digestive\r\norgans, accompanied with enlargement of the spleen. Consumption is rare\r\nin Brazil: during the whole of my travels I did not meet with more than\r\nhalf a dozen cases. As I would receive no fees, many presents of fish,\r\nfowls, and fruit were sent me.\r\n\r\nI have said that the chief occupation of the inhabitants is fishing, and\r\nthat the fish are nearly all taken in pens (currals). These enclosures\r\nare very common all along the coast of Pernambuco, and of the following\r\nshape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey are made of strong stakes, driven firmly into the ground at the\r\ndistance of a few feet from each other, the interstices between them\r\nbeing afterwards filled up by small straight rods closely tied together.\r\nThe straight line of rods is sometimes nearly a quarter of a mile in\r\nlength, and runs out away from the shore; it answers the purpose of\r\nguiding the fish into the enclosures at the farthest end of it.\r\n\r\nThe day before we left the island, we accompanied our host to visit the\r\ncurral belonging to him, in order to witness the method of taking fish;\r\nthey are only visited at low water. We went in a canoe to the entrance\r\nof the innermost enclosure; our host then stripped himself, as did also\r\nanother person who accompanied us, and entered the inner enclosure,\r\ntaking with them a small net a little deeper than the water, with a short\r\npole fixed to each end of it. One of the men then fixed one of the poles\r\nperpendicularly close to one side of the entrance to the enclosure, while\r\nthe other began to unfold the net, closing with it the entrance so as to\r\nprevent the escape of the fish; he then walked round by the side of the\r\nenclosure till he reached the other person, when the net was rolled up,\r\nthus enclosing in it all the fish contained in the curral, which amounted\r\nto about a dozen very fine ones. We were informed that at this season\r\nvery few are taken; so few, indeed, that they are scarcely sufficient\r\nfor the consumption of the families to whom the currals belong; in the\r\nrainy season, however, they are taken so abundantly, that boat-loads of\r\nthem are sent to the Pernambuco market. We returned to Recife in a large\r\ncanoe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nALAGOAS AND THE RIO SAN FRANCISCO.\r\n\r\n    The Author’s Motive for this Excursion—Voyage to the\r\n    Southward—Description of the Coast and Observations on the\r\n    great Restinga—Reaches Barra de S.

This part of the country, which I was strongly recommended\r\nto visit by Von Martius and others, on account of its botanical riches,\r\nis distant from Pernambuco about 1,200 miles, and nearly directly west\r\nfrom it. Although I was desirous to begin this journey I was advised by\r\npersons well acquainted with the interior of the country not to undertake\r\nit towards the end of the rainy season, on account of the difficulty\r\nof finding grass and water for the horses after the period when every\r\nthing has been scorched up by the burning sun of the dry season. Nor\r\nis the period of the rains less exceptionable for the undertaking of a\r\nlong journey, since, during the four months which it generally lasts,\r\nthere are scarcely two consecutive dry days. It was now about the end of\r\nJanuary, and as the period of my entering upon my proposed expedition\r\nwould not be sooner than the end of June or beginning of July, to pass\r\nthe intervening time I determined to visit Maceio, a small seaport town\r\nin the province of Alagoas, about half-way between Pernambuco and Bahia;\r\nand from thence to make an excursion to the Rio San Francisco, and, if\r\npossible, up that river to the great falls of Paulo Affonço. As no other\r\nconveyance was to be had for Maceio, I was obliged to take a passage in a\r\ncanoe which was going down laden with goods.\r\n\r\nIt was about three o’clock in the afternoon of the 30th of January, 1838,\r\nbefore I could obtain my passport, upon which I immediately embarked,\r\nand after undergoing the necessary examination at a custom-house boat,\r\nwe got outside the reef, and ran down before the north-east trade-wind\r\ntill seven o’clock P.M., when we came to an anchor for the night, in a\r\nsmall sandy bay about four leagues to the south of Pernambuco. During\r\nthe passage, we several times ran foul of the stakes of fishing pens,\r\nwhich are common along the coast. I may here describe the nature and\r\nappearance of the craft in which I was embarked; it was about forty feet\r\nlong and three feet broad, being the trunk of a large tree hollowed out;\r\na few feet at each end of it were decked over, and the little cabins so\r\nformed were filled with parcels and provisions; when empty they served\r\nas sleeping berths for the crew, which consisted of the master and two\r\nmen. It had a single, long, slender mast, to which a triangular sail was\r\nfixed, the lower part of which was stretched out by a long boom; a little\r\nbelow the gunwale on each side were lashed two logs of light buoyant\r\nwood, nearly as long as the canoe, of the same kind of which jangadas\r\nare made; while these enable her to carry more cargo, they serve also to\r\nprevent her from upsetting, and give a place to walk upon, as the cargo,\r\nin our vessel, rose two feet above the body of the canoe. It may well\r\nbe imagined that there was but little comfort in such a conveyance, as\r\nI was obliged to sit constantly upon one of my trunks, with no other\r\nshelter from the sun and rain than that afforded by an umbrella. On the\r\nshore, close to where we anchored, two large fires were burning, by\r\nthe light of which we saw several people and three or four huts. I was\r\nanxious to land here, to obtain, if possible, a place to sleep on, but\r\nthe master said he would not go on shore, as he was not on good terms\r\nwith some of the inhabitants, and did not choose to risk himself among\r\nthem. After supping, therefore, with the crew on oranges, farinha,\r\nand boiled salt-fish, I wrapped myself in my poncho, and lay down on\r\nmy trunks, and slept, but certainly not comfortably, till morning. At\r\ndawn of day we again got under way, and about eight A.M., passed Cape\r\nSt. Augustino, a rocky point, behind which the land rises from one to\r\ntwo hundred feet above the level of the sea; this is eight leagues to\r\nthe south of Pernambuco, the intervening country being one continued\r\nflat. During the whole of the day we ran down very close to the shore,\r\nalways keeping between it and the reef. The country is of an undulating\r\nhilly nature, wooded with small verdant trees and shrubs, many of the\r\nlatter covered with flowers. The beauty of the coast, although a little\r\nmonotonous, was, notwithstanding, some recompense for a day of continued\r\nexposure to the sun. At eight o’clock in the evening we again came to an\r\nanchor, at a place where the master was well known; here we landed, and\r\nI found that my quarters for the night were to be a smith’s work-shop;\r\nnext day, however, I ascertained that it was the best house in the place,\r\nbeing formed of wicker-work and mud, while the others were composed of\r\nstakes and cocoa-nut leaves. The following morning the master of the\r\ncanoe took me to the house of a relation, about two miles further along\r\nthe shore, where we met with a kind reception. As some of the cargo of\r\nthe canoe had to be landed here, and more taken in, we remained here\r\nall day, which I did not regret, as it rained heavily till night; on\r\nthis account I was prevented from making an excursion into the country,\r\nalthough I did not perhaps lose much, as, in one short walk, I found\r\nnearly the whole herbaceous vegetation burnt up. The land here rises\r\nhigher than at any other place between Pernambuco and Maceio, the faces\r\nof several low hills, exhibiting a kind of coarse grained sandstone rock,\r\nexactly of the same nature as the reef which runs for several hundred\r\nmiles along the coast both to the north and south of Pernambuco. This\r\nreef, which is covered with small shells and coralloid substances, Mr.\r\nDarwin supposes either to have been formed by a bar of sand and pebbles\r\nformerly existing below the water, which was first consolidated, and\r\nthen elevated; or by a long spit of sand, running parallel to the coast,\r\nhaving had its central part consolidated, and afterwards, by a slight\r\nchange in the set of currents, having the loose matter removed, so as\r\nonly to leave the hard nucleus. Neither of these suppositions, I feel\r\nfully satisfied, accounts for the origin of the reef, because, at the\r\nplace where we now were, I could trace, at low water, a rocky connection\r\nbetween the reef and the rocks of which the hills were composed. It is\r\nmore probable that the reef owes its origin to the decay of the rock\r\nbetween it and the shore, but in what manner I will not attempt to\r\nexplain. This sandstone, as I will hereafter show, belongs to the lower\r\nseries of the chalk formation.\r\n\r\nWe slept at the house of the relation of the master of the canoe, who was\r\na tailor by trade, and an acknowledged poet and wit: in the society of\r\nwhom and his family, consisting of several sons and daughters, the time\r\npassed away most agreeably. Early in the morning of the following day we\r\nagain pursued our voyage, keeping, as before, close along the shore, and\r\nat about two o’clock P.M., we arrived at Barra de S. Antonio Grande, a\r\nsmall village about nine leagues to the north of Maceio, consisting of\r\nabout one hundred houses, the greater part of which are made of cocoa-nut\r\nleaves, and are mostly situated on a projecting point of flat land,\r\nbounded on one side by the sea, and on the other by a small river of the\r\nsame name as the village, both deriving their appellation from a large\r\nbar of white sand which stretches across the mouth of the river at some\r\ndistance from the shore. The inhabitants live principally by fishing, but\r\nI was informed on my arrival at Maceio, that it is a place much resorted\r\nto by slave vessels for the delivery of their cargoes, and it certainly\r\nappears to be well suited for such a purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I took a walk a little way along the banks of the river,\r\nbut did not find much to interest me; like all other sandy parts along\r\nthe coast, the vegetation here consists of low shrubs mixed with a few\r\nsmall trees; _Schinus terebinthifolius_ being by far the most common. One\r\nof the most striking vegetable productions near the village is a large\r\nwild fig-tree growing close to the river, beneath the shade of which\r\nfour large canoes, larger than the one in which I arrived, were being\r\nconstructed; this also forms a rendezvous for the gossips of the village,\r\nwho assemble there in the afternoon, beneath its wide-spreading branches\r\nwhich reach nearly to the ground, thus shading them from the sun. The\r\nleaves of the tree are about six inches long and three broad, with fruit\r\nabout the size of a large gooseberry. In the evening I strolled through\r\nthe village, and found that nearly all the inhabitants had turned out of\r\ntheir houses to enjoy the beautiful moonlight and the delightfully cool\r\nevening breeze; many of them were squatted on the bare ground, some were\r\nlounging on mats, while others were stretched out on cocoa-nut leaves.\r\nIn most of these groups, one or more of the individuals, generally young\r\nmen, were amusing the others by playing lively airs on the guitar. As the\r\nmaster of the canoe belonged to the village, I was invited to sleep at\r\nhis house, but as he could not afford me a bed, I was obliged to repose\r\non a hide in the corner of a small room; scarcely, however, had I fallen\r\nasleep when I was awakened by legions of hungry bugs, that came pouring\r\nout from the cracks in the mud walls; unable to endure this torment I\r\ngot up, and taking-the materials which formed my bed outside the house,\r\nI shook them well, and spreading them in the open air, I slept there\r\ncomfortably till morning. This was the only time during the whole of my\r\ntravels that I was annoyed to any extent by this insect, which is not\r\nnearly so common, or so abundant as the flea.\r\n\r\nNext day, Feb. 4th, we left Barra de San Antonio Grande about mid-day,\r\nand reached Maceio at five o’clock in the evening. Shortly afterwards\r\nI delivered the letters of introduction I had brought with me from\r\nPernambuco to Mr. Burnet, the only British merchant in the place, who\r\nkindly invited me to remain with him during my stay. The town of Maceio\r\nis of considerable size, containing about 5,000 inhabitants; previous\r\nto the independence of Brazil, when the Portuguese were expelled by the\r\nBrazilians, the population amounted to upwards of 7,000, and as these\r\nwere the principal capitalists, the trade of the place has declined\r\nconsiderably ever since. The town itself stands on a platform about\r\nfifty or sixty feet above the level of the sea, and distant from it\r\nabout a quarter of a mile; but at a little more than a mile to the\r\nnorth-east, there is a small village called Jaragua, close to the sea,\r\nwhere there are two wharfs for the loading and unloading of goods, and\r\na custom-house. The bay of Maceio is of considerable size, forming a\r\nkind of semicircle, and offering good anchorage for shipping. Formerly\r\nmuch cotton and sugar were shipped from this port in British bottoms,\r\nbut now scarcely more than two or three English vessels visit it in the\r\ncourse of the year, the greater part of this produce being sent either\r\nto Bahia or Pernambuco. The country round Maceio is not so monotonous\r\nand flat as that around Pernambuco; low undulating ridges of hills\r\nreaching close to the sea, covered with a vegetation of low trees and\r\nshrubs. During several walks which I took in the vicinity, in company\r\nwith a young Scotchman who had been sometime resident there as a medical\r\npractitioner, I made many additions to my botanical collections,\r\nparticularly on a flat sandy tract to the north-east of the town. Among\r\nthese I may mention a fine _Diospyros_, a curious _Eriocaulon_, _Marcetia\r\ntaxifolia_, an _Eschweilera_ different from that found at Pernambuco,\r\nand a _Melocactus_. Maceio is considered more unhealthy than Pernambuco\r\nor Bahia, ague being of very frequent occurrence, particularly at the\r\nbeginning of the rainy season.\r\n\r\nThe Rio San Francisco being only thirty-two leagues to the southward\r\nof Maceio, and learning that it was navigable, without interruption,\r\nfor upwards of a hundred miles, I resolved to visit it. A Portuguese\r\ngentleman, however, to whom I was directed for information on the\r\nsubject, having, a few years before, made the voyage up to the great\r\nfalls (Cachoeira de Paulo Affonço), informed me that as it was then the\r\nseason at which the river rises to its greatest height, the head waters\r\nbeing far to the south, he would not advise me to undertake the voyage,\r\nin consequence of the dangerous navigation at the period of the floods,\r\nas well as from the little chance there would be of my adding much\r\nto my collection, from the dried up state in which I should find the\r\nvegetation, owing to the long continued drought. Still I determined to\r\ngo, as nothing better presented itself to pass the time, and hitherto,\r\nmoreover, I had always found the difficulties of travelling much less\r\nthan they were represented to be. I considered myself fortunate in being\r\nable to hire, as a servant, the black who accompanied the gentleman above\r\nalluded to.\r\n\r\nHaving made the necessary preparations for the voyage, I engaged a\r\njangada to take me along the coast to the mouth of the river, and left\r\nMaceio at five o’clock A.M., on the morning of the 15th of February. I\r\nintended to leave at eleven o’clock the night before, at the rising of\r\nthe moon, but when I reached the beach with my luggage, the owner of the\r\njangada was nowhere to be found, although he had faithfully promised to\r\nbe waiting for me. I immediately sent Pedro, my black servant, in search\r\nof him, who soon afterwards returned unsuccessful; and I had no resource\r\nbut to walk backwards and forwards on the beach till shortly before five\r\no’clock in the morning, when he made his appearance. On questioning\r\nhim about his absence, he told me with the greatest coolness, that as\r\nI did not arrive exactly when the moon rose, he thought I should not\r\ncome till morning, and that, in order to pass the time, he had gone out\r\nto fish. Having at length embarked, we soon lost sight of Maceio under\r\nthe influence of a strong north-east wind, and, coasting along a flat\r\nshrubby shore, we arrived at night at the mouth of a small river, on the\r\nsouth bank of which, about a mile up, there is a little village called\r\nBatel. At this place, which is twenty leagues distant from Maceio, we\r\nremained for the night. I preferred sleeping in the jangada to one of the\r\nsmall cocoa-nut-leaf cottages that was offered to me, but I had reason\r\nto repent of having done so. It was full tide when we arrived at the\r\nvillage, and the jangada was brought close to the shore, so that when\r\nthe tide ebbed it was left dry. I did not then recollect that all muddy\r\nshores covered with mangroves, particularly at the mouths of rivers,\r\nabound with mosquitos, but I was soon reminded of the fact by being awoke\r\nabout midnight with my face and hands smarting and swollen from the bites\r\nof those annoying insects. As I slept in my clothes without any covering,\r\nI was obliged to shield my face with my pocket-handkerchief, and thrust\r\nmy hands into my pockets. Although I was thus in some measure protected\r\nfrom their bites, it was long before I could again fall asleep, from the\r\ncontinued humming noise, almost as loud as that of bees, which they were\r\nmaking around me. When I got up at daybreak, after a restless night, I\r\nfound that besides the mosquitos, I was surrounded by thousands of a\r\nsmall black sand-fly (_Merohy_), not much larger than a grain of fine\r\ngunpowder, but whose bites are no less irritating than those of their\r\nlarger congeners. The morning tide, we found, did not rise so high as it\r\ndid on the previous evening, and it was with some difficulty that the\r\njangada was floated into deep water, which was not effected till nearly\r\nnine o’clock, A.M. In crossing the bar at the mouth of the river, we had\r\nto pass through a line of small breakers, three of which swept over the\r\nelevated platform on which I was sitting, and drenched me to the skin,\r\nthereby rendering the remainder of the voyage very uncomfortable. It was\r\none o’clock, P.M., when we reached a little village called Peba, which\r\nis situated on the coast, about five leagues to the north of the mouth\r\nof the Rio San Francisco: this was the termination of my sea-voyage, as\r\nthe heavy surf which breaks over the shallow bar of that river will not\r\nallow jangadas to enter it. The village is situated a little way inland,\r\nand is hidden from the sea by a high embankment of sand, which at this\r\nplace is very much drifted by the wind; it is, however, recognised at\r\na considerable distance, from the number of tall cocoa-nut trees which\r\ngrow near the shore. I was here particularly struck with a fact which\r\ngoes a great way to explain the phenomenon of the stem of a fossil tree\r\nbeing found passing through several strata of sandstone rock. Many of the\r\ncocoa-nut trees have their stems embedded to the depth of fifty feet and\r\nupwards in the embankment of sand which stretches along the shore, and\r\nin many places is several hundred feet broad; some of them, indeed, are\r\nso deeply embedded, that the nuts can be gathered without climbing the\r\ntree. Now as this sand has accumulated at different periods, particularly\r\nduring the prevalence of the north-east trade-wind, it must present, if\r\never it becomes hardened, a vast number of irregularly horizontal beds,\r\nthrough which the stems of the palms will be found to pass.\r\n\r\nFrom a fisherman, whom I met on the shore, I obtained permission to\r\noccupy an empty hut till the next day. While seated on the trunk of\r\na tree, which was lying on the beach at high-water mark, I observed\r\nthat on the shore here, as well as along the coast, crabs of various\r\nsizes abounded; and, as I had to wait until my luggage was landed and\r\ncarried to the hut, I amused myself by watching the operations of a\r\nsmall species, belonging to the genus _Gelasimus_ that was either making\r\nor enlarging its burrow in the sand. About once in every two minutes\r\nit came up to the surface with a quantity of sand enclosed in its left\r\nclaw, which, by a sudden jerk, it ejected to the distance of about six\r\ninches, always taking care to vary the direction in which it was thrown,\r\nso as to prevent its accumulation in one place. Having a few small\r\nshells belonging to a species of _Turbo_ in one of my jacket pockets, I\r\nendeavoured to throw one of these into its hole, in order to see whether\r\nit would bring it up again or not; of the four that were thus thrown, one\r\nonly entered the hole, the others remaining within a few inches of it.\r\nIt was about five minutes before the animal again made its appearance,\r\nbringing with it the shell which had gone down, and carrying it to the\r\ndistance of about a foot from its burrow, it there deposited it. Seeing\r\nthe others lying near the mouth of the hole, it immediately carried them,\r\none by one, to the place where the first had been laid down, and then\r\nreturned to its former labour of carrying up sand. It was impossible not\r\nto conclude that the actions of this little creature, which holds so low\r\na station in the chain of beings, were the result of reason, rather\r\nthan of blind instinct by which the actions of the inferior animals\r\nare generally thought to be guided, for man himself, under the same\r\ncircumstances, could not have acted with more judgment.\r\n\r\nOn the day following our arrival at Peba, I made arrangements with the\r\nowner of an ox-cart to take me with my luggage to Piassabassú, a little\r\nvillage situated on the north bank of the Rio San Francisco, and about\r\ntwo leagues distant from its mouth. He promised to come early in the\r\nforenoon, but, much to my annoyance, did not make his appearance till\r\nfive o’clock in the afternoon, shortly after which we started. We kept\r\nalong the sandy shore for about two miles, then went a little inland\r\nand continued our route in a direction nearly parallel to the shore\r\nthrough a flat, sandy, bushy country, in which _Mouriria Guianensis_,\r\nAubl., and several species of _Lauraceæ_, were very abundant. It was\r\nindeed dark during the greater part of the journey, but on my return\r\nI had ample opportunity of observing the nature of the vegetation. I\r\nwas not at all sorry, after we had once started, that we had been thus\r\ndelayed, as travelling in this country is far more pleasant in the\r\nevening than during the heat of the day. Our cart was of a very primitive\r\nconstruction, similar to that seen everywhere in the interior of Brazil,\r\nand little different from that used by the Romans. It consisted of a rude\r\nframe, supported on two wheels about five feet in diameter, constructed\r\nof solid plank; and was drawn by six oxen, yoked in pairs, goaded on by\r\ntwo drivers, each carrying a slender pole about ten feet long. One of\r\nthe drivers goes before to lead the way, while the other urges on the\r\noxen with his long pole. The axles are never greased, and the creaking\r\nnoise they continually make, which we heard at a great distance, is most\r\ndisagreeable; the reason given for not greasing them is, that the cattle\r\nare so accustomed to the noise that they would not go on without it. It\r\nwas ten o’clock at night when we arrived at the end of our journey, and\r\nas there was no place where a stranger could put up, and being without\r\nintroduction to any resident in the village, I was taken by our conductor\r\nto the house of one of his acquaintances, where the only accommodation\r\nto be obtained was in a small and very dirty apartment in the hut, which\r\ndid not much signify, as I slept in my own hammock.\r\n\r\nPiassabassú is a small village, where the greater part of the houses\r\nsurround a large square with a church in its centre; these are nearly\r\nall of one story, and, being white-washed on the outside, they present\r\na cleanly appearance. Many of those situated nearest to the river, were\r\nabandoned on account of its flooded state, being then higher than it had\r\nbeen since the year 1793, when the inundation reached to a still greater\r\nheight. On the morning after our arrival at this place I hired a canoe\r\nto convey me to the Villa do Penêdo, seven leagues further up the river.\r\nWe started at eleven o’clock, A.M., but the current was so strong that\r\nthe canoe was obliged to keep close along shore to be able to make way\r\nagainst it; a small sail, by which we were propelled, was often barely\r\nsufficient to keep us from being carried downwards; at such times our\r\ntwo men were forced to use their paddles. At Piassabassú the river is\r\nabout two leagues broad, but the opposite side cannot be seen on account\r\nof a large island which stands in the middle of the stream; it was only\r\nafter we had proceeded upwards about half a league, that I first saw the\r\nwhole breadth of this magnificent river. The country, for about three\r\nleagues, is flat on both sides, which the present flood had inundated\r\nto a considerable extent. We passed large fields of sugar-cane, where\r\nnothing was to be seen but the tops of the leaves, which, waving in the\r\nstream, gave them the appearance of verdant meadows; where trees existed,\r\nnothing but their upper branches were visible, and almost every house\r\nthat we passed had only its roof appearing above the water. The river\r\nbegins to rise in the month of October, which is the commencement of the\r\nrainy season in the southern provinces, the sources of its origin, and\r\ncontinues to do so until the end of March. At about five leagues from the\r\ncoast, the country, on the south side of the river, slightly rises, and\r\nfrom thence to Penêdo it is of an undulating character, but the opposite\r\nside still continues flat. After pursuing our course upwards about two\r\nleagues on the north, we crossed over to the southern bank, in order to\r\nobtain advantage of the breeze. A few sugar plantations exist on both\r\nsides, but the vacancies in the forests made by the cultivated spots are\r\nscarcely apparent. By the force of the stream, particularly in certain\r\nturns of the river, the banks were greatly encroached upon by a continual\r\nprocess of undermining, and we saw great masses of earth falling in, the\r\ntrees which grew thereon being floated down by the current. We did not\r\ncome in sight of Penêdo till within a league of it, when, turning round\r\na high rocky wooded point on the south side, the white houses were seen\r\nbrightly lighted up by the rays of the sun, which was then just setting\r\nnearly opposite to the town. Shortly afterwards we distinguished Villa\r\nNova, a small town situated about half a league below Penêdo, but on the\r\nsouth side of the river. As the Rio San Francisco divides the province of\r\nAlagoas from that of Sergipe, it will be seen that the Villa do Penêdo is\r\nin the former, while Villa Nova is in the latter.\r\n\r\nIt was too late when we landed, to deliver the letters of introduction\r\nwhich I brought from Maceio, and, as the boatmen would not remain till\r\nmorning, I sent my man Pedro to look out for a house in which I might\r\nlodge for the night. After being away for more than an hour he returned,\r\nand told me that he had much difficulty in finding one, owing to almost\r\nevery house being crowded by the many families driven out of their homes\r\nby the flooded state of the river. I should have preferred an empty\r\nhouse, but as this was not attainable, I caused my luggage to be taken\r\nup to the only one Pedro could procure, which I found belonged to a\r\nyoung girl, who lived alone in it, following a profession which is not\r\nconsidered so disreputable in Brazil as in most other countries. In\r\na small apartment of this house we therefore passed the night in our\r\nhammocks, which were slung from one side of the room to the other. During\r\nthe voyage up the river I saw several large reeds in flower, and great\r\nplenty of a large yellow-flowered _Jussiæa_. A little way below Penêdo,\r\n_Machaonia spinosa_ grew abundantly, forming a good sized spiny shrub,\r\nhaving large panicles of small white flowers, called by the Brazilians,\r\nEspinha branea: of this I collected specimens, as well as of a species\r\nof _Oxypetalum_, bearing large umbels of sweet smelling flowers, not\r\nunlike those of _Hoya carnosa_.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning I delivered the letters of recommendation I\r\nhad with me from Maceio. One of these was to the chief magistrate of\r\nthe district (the Juiz de Direito), Dr. Manoel Bernardino de Souza\r\nde Figueiredo, by whom I was most cordially received, and invited to\r\nreside with him till an opportunity occurred for proceeding further up\r\nthe river. I returned immediately to my lodging in quest of my luggage,\r\nbut before this could be dispatched the Juiz returned my visit, and,\r\non discovering my poor quarters, he expressed much regret that I had\r\nnot proceeded directly to his house on my arrival. One of the greatest\r\ninconveniences that a traveller meets with in Brazil, is the difficulty\r\nof finding accommodation, for in none of the towns or villages throughout\r\nthis vast empire, does there exist an inn of any kind except in the\r\nprincipalities of Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, and one or two others in the\r\nmining districts, and even these are kept by foreigners. It will be long\r\nbefore such conveniences come into general use, for the Brazilians when\r\nthey travel, always carry with them their own servants, provisions,\r\ncooking apparatus, and beds; and it seldom happens that an empty house of\r\nsome description or other is not to be had in any village during their\r\njourney: should they fail to do so, during the dry season they content\r\nthemselves by encamping under some large trees, slinging their hammocks\r\nfrom one branch to another. It was in this manner that I afterwards\r\nwas forced to travel, often being for months together without sleeping\r\nunder a roof. The Brazilians are particularly attentive to any stranger\r\nrecommended to them, and, during the whole of my wanderings, I seldom\r\nwent from one place to another without letters, nor do I remember a\r\nsingle instance in which I was not courteously received by those to whom\r\nthey were addressed.\r\n\r\nThe Villa do Penêdo, so called because it is situated upon an\r\nelevated rocky point, on the north bank of the river, is about thirty\r\nmiles from its mouth. The rock on which it stands is a fine-grained\r\nyellowish-coloured sandstone, the strata of which incline from east to\r\nwest. The streets are irregular but the houses are very substantial,\r\nthe principal ones being of two stories, and are for the most part\r\nbuilt of the same stone as that on which the town stands. It contains\r\nabout 4,000 inhabitants, the greater part of whom are very poor. There\r\nare no less than six large and substantially built churches, to one of\r\nwhich is attached a convent of Franciscan Friars, called Nossa Senhora\r\nda Corrente, but it contains only three brethren. In the Comarco,\r\nor district of Penêdo, sugar and cotton are the principal articles\r\ncultivated, the greater part of the plantations being situated on the\r\nmargin of the river, below the town. Mandiocca, french-beans, and rice\r\nare raised in sufficient quantities but only for consumption. Formerly\r\ncattle were reared to some extent in the more inland parts of the\r\ndistrict, but this source of production has failed in consequence of the\r\noccasionally excessive drought, and also because of the abundance of\r\na tick (_Carrapato_), which sometimes proves so great a plague that a\r\nfarmer loses his whole stock in a single season. During the Portuguese\r\ndynasty, Penêdo was a flourishing place, but is now rapidly falling into\r\ndecay. The following census of the whole Comarco, which was taken in the\r\nyear 1837, I owe to the kindness of the Juiz de Direito, and I consider\r\nis worthy of being quoted, to show the proportion which the different\r\nraces bear to each other in this part of the country.\r\n\r\n    Whites           22,045.\r\n    Free Mulattos    32,694.\r\n    Mulatto Slaves    4,531.\r\n    Free Blacks      10,113.\r\n    Black Slaves     10,876.\r\n    Native Indians    2,331.\r\n                     ------\r\n      In all         82,590.\r\n\r\nThree days after my arrival at Penêdo, we heard that an empty canoe was\r\ngoing up as far as the river was navigable, and accordingly I engaged a\r\npassage for a small sum. Having made all the requisite preparations for\r\nmy voyage, I left Penêdo at one o’clock, P.M., on the 22nd of February,\r\ncarrying with me letters to some of the principal inhabitants of the\r\ndifferent places at which we were likely to stop. The canoe in which\r\nwe embarked was a very large one, being about forty feet long and four\r\nbroad. It is seldom that a single tree is of sufficient dimensions to\r\nform a canoe of this size, but when such is not the case, they hollow out\r\nthe largest they can find, sawing it in two through the middle from stem\r\nto stern, and then give it the requisite breadth by the addition of one\r\nor more widths of planks between the two halves: in this same manner our\r\ncanoe was constructed. One end of the bow, for the length of ten feet,\r\nwas thatched over with cocoa-nut leaves like the roof of a house, which\r\nthus served both as a place of shelter from the sun during the day, and\r\nas a sleeping berth by night. It had only one mast, which carried two\r\nlarge triangular sails of a very coarse cotton cloth, manufactured in\r\nthe country, and these were stretched out on each side by a long boom.\r\nThe sea-breeze generally reaches Penêdo about mid-day, blowing right up\r\nthe river, and, with the sails spread out in this wing-like fashion,\r\nwe went up the stream with great rapidity, notwithstanding that the\r\ncurrent against us was very strong. As it is dangerous for small canoes\r\nto navigate the river when it is flooded, two of them are lashed side by\r\nside, and thus united, they form what is called an Ajojo. At six o’clock\r\nin the evening we reached the village of Propiá, situated on the south\r\nside of the river, and seven leagues distant from Penêdo. It contains\r\nabout 250 houses, mostly small, and built of wicker work and mud; many of\r\nthose in the street parallel with the river were half full of water, and\r\nconsequently abandoned; such, also, we observed to be the case with many\r\nhouses which we passed during our voyage.\r\n\r\nThe most striking objects of vegetation which I observed on the banks\r\nof the river, were many trees of considerable size, belonging to the\r\nnatural order _Leguminosæ_, bearing large spikes of light-purple flowers;\r\nabundance of a curious kind of _Cactus_, reaching to the height of\r\nfrom twenty to thirty feet, the great fleshy and naked arms of which,\r\nstand out like the branches of an enormous chandelier. A most striking\r\ndifference was to be observed between the verdure of that part of the\r\ncountry which, for upwards of four months, had been under water, and\r\nthe more elevated parts, on which no rain had fallen for nearly six\r\nmonths. The latter had more the appearance of the deciduous woods of\r\nEurope in winter, than such as grow within the tropics are generally\r\nsupposed to present. It was only here and there, that a tree was to be\r\nseen covered with leaves, all the others having lost their foliage, owing\r\nto the excessive and long continued drought. In sailing up the river,\r\nthe prospect would have been dreary, had it not been for the broad belt\r\nof arboreous vegetation that clothed its margins. The country between\r\nPenêdo and Propiá is of a low hilly character, but about two leagues\r\nabove the former place, a rather high ridge of mountains is seen on the\r\nnorth side, about eight leagues from the river, called Serra de Priáca;\r\nand about four leagues further up, a high conical mountain called the\r\nSerra de Maraba is seen, rising from the surrounding flat country like\r\na pyramid, in a N.N.W. direction, about six leagues distant. A market,\r\nor fair, is held at this village every Saturday, and as the owner of the\r\ncanoe wished to make some purchases for his return cargo, I was detained\r\nhere two days. On the morning after our arrival, I walked a little way\r\ninto the country behind the town, but found the vegetation so completely\r\nscorched up, that not a green thing was to be seen. I then directed my\r\nsteps to the bank of the river, and collected specimens of two species of\r\n_Cæsalpinia_, which were beautifully in flower, as well as a low shrubby\r\nspecies of _Croton_, which is very common, its wood, when broken, having\r\na fragrant smell not unlike that of a _Calycanthus_.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for the fair created some bustle, as during the whole\r\nof the previous day, particularly towards evening, canoes continued to\r\narrive from all quarters with articles for sale; and from the inland\r\npart of the country numbers of horses came into the village laden with\r\nmerchandize. As I slept in the canoe, which was moored amidst a number\r\nof others, I was awoke early on the morning of the fair, by the noise of\r\na motley multitude of men, women, and children of all colours, from the\r\ndeep black African, to the scarcely white inhabitants of Brazil. The\r\nplace where the market is usually held being then under water, the crowd\r\nhad assembled on an elevated part of the river bank towards the west end\r\nof the town, opposite to which all the canoes were made fast alongside\r\neach other. As soon as I was dressed, I took a walk through the crowd\r\nto observe the kind of goods exposed for sale, and as might be expected\r\nI found them extremely various, consisting, principally, of articles of\r\nfood and dress. Among others of inferior note may be particularized the\r\nfollowing as being the most abundant:—Farinha de Mandiocca, dried beef,\r\nlarge fish, mostly sturgeon, from the river, dried in the sun, sugar\r\nin large loaves shaped like cheeses, or in smaller ones in the form of\r\nbricks, molasses in large leathern bottles, fresh beef, bananas, soap,\r\nshoes, English cotton, cloth and prints, ropes made from the fibre of\r\nnative plants, tobacco, planks and posts for house building, earthen-ware\r\ncooking utensils, and water pitchers, brought by the Indians, leather,\r\nhides, rum, &c.\r\n\r\nThe great variety in the style of dress adopted by these people, is the\r\nfirst thing to strike the eye of a stranger. The better classes wear\r\neither light jackets and trowsers, or shirt and trowsers only, over\r\nwhich they put a long dressing-gown of printed cotton, to which is added\r\nduring the cool of the morning and evening, a cloak of Scotch tartan.\r\nThey seldom wear stockings, but have their bare feet thrust into a pair\r\nof brown leather slippers. The country people generally wear a broad\r\nbrimmed hat made of leather, and sometimes a leathern jacket; but most\r\ncommonly their only covering consists of a pair of thin cotton drawers,\r\nwhich reach a little below the knee, and a shirt of the same stuff\r\nhanging loose outside of them. The negroes usually dress in the same\r\nmanner as the whites, but the women have much more taste than the men,\r\nmany of whom appear literally in rags, though apparently as happy in this\r\nattire, as if they were of the best description. I observed here more of\r\nthe aboriginal inhabitants of Brazil, than I had seen at one time before;\r\nmany of them bore evident signs of having a mixture of white, and others\r\nof black blood in their veins, but not in sufficient quantity to destroy\r\nthe peculiar obliquity of the eyes, and the lank black hair of the\r\nAmerican race.\r\n\r\nIt was about three o’clock in the afternoon before we could leave Propiá,\r\nand at eight we arrived at Traipú, another small village situated on\r\nthe north bank of the river, about seven leagues further up. At half\r\na league from Propiá we passed a small village called Collegio, and\r\nat a further distance of two leagues and a half a still smaller one,\r\ncalled San Bras, both situated on the north side of the stream. As far\r\nas the latter village, the appearance of the country on both sides of\r\nthe river bears much the same appearance as that above Penêdo, but at\r\na distance of a about a league above San Bras, it becomes much higher,\r\nthe undulating ridges of hills reaching close to the water in many\r\nplaces, thus diminishing the breadth of the stream, and, consequently,\r\nincreasing the rapidity of the current. The highest part of the country\r\nis a hill opposite Traipú, the termination of a range called the Serra de\r\nTabangá. The effects of the drought on the vegetation were still greater\r\nhere than further down; as far as the eye could reach, nothing like a\r\nforest was to be seen, both the hills and valleys being thinly covered\r\nwith small trees and shrubs, and all, with a few solitary exceptions,\r\ndenuded of their foliage. On the surface of the ground itself there was\r\nno herbaceous vegetation, the red coloured soil alone being seen through\r\nthe withered bushes. Here and there along the banks a few houses exist,\r\nbut none were to be observed inland. The only objects that relieved the\r\neye in this desert-like region, were the green bushes which grew along\r\nthe inundated banks, and the grotesque _Cacti_ abounding in dry rocky\r\nplaces. The latter are the most conspicuous objects that meet the eye\r\nof a voyager; some of their trunks are of immense thickness, and their\r\nbranching tops reach to a great height above the surrounding vegetation.\r\nThese are certainly the most remarkable looking plants of the many which\r\nclothe the surface of our globe, their huge fleshy branches seeming more\r\nthe work of art than of nature. It is only plants such as these, that\r\nare able to retain their verdure during the long droughts to which the\r\ncountry here is subjected. On the rocky places where these grow, there\r\nare also many _Bromeliaceous_ plants, which in spite of the want of rain,\r\nnot only grow luxuriantly but produce their large red clusters of flowers\r\nin the greatest perfection. The rocks on which these plants vegetate\r\nare of gneiss, in thin layers of a dark colour, full of small garnets,\r\nand cropping out at a very obtuse angle towards the south. We remained\r\nfor the night at Traipú, and at nine o’clock next morning resumed our\r\nvoyage, but as the wind was very high, we could make no way against the\r\ncurrent; at about half a league from the place of our departure we were\r\nobliged to halt for some hours on the north bank of the river. This\r\nafforded me an opportunity of landing, when I made a few additions to\r\nmy collections. Among these was a species of _Azolla_, which existed in\r\nthe greatest abundance, in a flat muddy place that was slightly flooded.\r\nHere also I met with some of the largest _Cacti_ I have ever seen; one\r\nin particular was of enormous size, the stem measuring upwards of three\r\nfeet in circumference, and unbranched to the height of about ten feet;\r\nits entire height could not be less than between thirty and forty feet.\r\nThis and other large kinds of _Cactus_ are called by the inhabitants\r\nof this part of the country Sheeke-sheeke, and their fleshy stems and\r\nbranches, after being stripped of their back and spines, are roasted\r\nand eaten in times of scarcity; under similar circumstances they are\r\ngiven raw to cattle. A little below this place on the south side of the\r\nriver, we passed an old gold-working, situated on the side of a low hill\r\nthrough which a small ravine passes. It seemed to have been a long time\r\nsince it had been worked, as the heaps of soil which had been thrown out,\r\nwere covered with the low shrubby vegetation peculiar to the district.\r\nContinuing our voyage, towards sunset we came in sight of a small island,\r\ncalled Ilha dos Prazeres, on the top of which there is a church of the\r\nsame name. Opposite this island, on the north side, we passed the mouth\r\nof a small river, called the Rio de Panêma, which takes its rise in the\r\nSertão of the province of Alagoas. On the upper side of the mouth of\r\nthis river there is a little hamlet, consisting only of a few houses,\r\ncalled Barra de Panêma. A little further up we crossed over to the\r\nsouth side, to land an old negro who had accompanied us from Propiá,\r\nand it was with much regret that we were obliged to come to an anchor\r\nfor the night a little way above this place, for the river here takes a\r\nturn to the northward, and although there was a strong breeze, we could\r\nnot succeed in getting our canoe into a position to enable us to avail\r\nourselves of the favourable wind, notwithstanding the best efforts of our\r\ncrew, which consisted of three men, assisted by myself and servant; an\r\nexposure of our vessel to a side wind would have upset her, and she was\r\ntoo unmanageable to attempt rowing.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, before breakfast, I took a walk to a high\r\nridge of gneiss rocks, which is at a little distance from the river, and\r\nfound a variety of different kinds of _Cacti_. One of these was a great\r\n_Melocactus_ much larger than the one which is so common near Pernambuco;\r\nit grows in fissures of the rock where scarcely any soil exists, and its\r\ntough roots penetrate to such a depth, that they can with difficulty be\r\nwithdrawn; living specimens of this (_Melocactus Hookerianus_, Gardn.)\r\nwhich I sent home, now exist in the collections at Kew and Glasgow. While\r\nlying in the canoe, waiting for the breeze, I heard a splashing noise in\r\nthe water as of heavy rain, but on looking over the side, I found it to\r\nbe produced by hundreds of small fish; so abundant were they, that having\r\nno hook, I had recourse to a bent pin fixed to the end of a thread, and\r\nthus in a few minutes I caught above thirty of them. I found them to\r\nbelong to the tribe _Salmonidæ_, of which they form a very diminutive\r\nspecies, measuring from two to three inches in length, and from an inch\r\nto an inch and a half in depth; they are called by the Indians Piába;\r\nthe two lower thirds of their depth is of a silvery-white, while the\r\nupper third is of a pale lead colour, being in general appearance not\r\nunlike a herring in miniature; they are extremely voracious and abundant,\r\nespecially in shallow water, where they are caught in numbers by\r\nchildren; they make an excellent dish when stewed. From a young man who\r\nwas fishing in a shallow part of the river with a hand-net, I obtained a\r\nfew other kinds of fish, and among them one which is very much dreaded\r\nby the inhabitants of the banks of nearly all the lakes and rivers in\r\nthe northern provinces; it is called Piranha by the Brazilians, and is\r\nalso one of the _Salmonidæ_, belonging to the genus _Serasalmo_. It is\r\ncommonly about a foot in length, but sometimes is as much as two feet\r\nlong, being very much compressed laterally, and very deep; the back is of\r\na dark brownish colour, and the belly yellowish white, both being thinly\r\nmarked with reddish spots; the lower jaw projects a little beyond the\r\nupper, and both are armed with about fourteen flattish triangular-shaped\r\nteeth, upwards of a quarter of an inch in length, and very short. It is\r\nmost voracious, and is consequently caught with difficulty. Many people\r\nare often severely injured by them whilst bathing, and I have repeatedly\r\nbeen shown the scars left by their bites. It is said that ducks\r\nfrequently lose their legs, in consequence of their voracity, and it is\r\neven asserted that where they abound, cattle have been known to perish\r\nfrom their attacks, when going into the water to cool themselves, or to\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\nWe resumed our voyage again about eleven o’clock in the morning, and at\r\nonce reached Lagoa Funda, a small village on the north side of the river,\r\nthe distance being about two leagues. It contains but very few houses,\r\nand takes its name from a large deep lake which runs westward from it, in\r\na direction parallel with the river. During this voyage we came in sight\r\nof a range of mountains called the Serra Pão de Assucar, bearing N.N.W.\r\nof us; it terminates abruptly towards the W.S.W., and slopes gradually\r\nthence to the E.N.E. and is by far the highest range in the district.\r\nThe country around us was now beginning to assume a verdant appearance,\r\nseveral showers of rain having lately fallen. Shortly after our arrival\r\nat this place, owing to the loss of the wind, we were obliged to remain\r\ntill five o’clock in the afternoon; when the sea breeze reached us, we\r\nagain started, and were enabled by half past six o’clock to reach another\r\nsmall village called San Pedro. This is situated on an island of the same\r\nname, which is about half a league long by a quarter of a league broad,\r\nbeing flat, with a sandy soil; the upper end where the village stands,\r\nis open, while the opposite extremity is densely wooded with bushes and\r\nsmall trees.\r\n\r\nI passed the night in the canoe, but could get little sleep owing to the\r\nmosquitos which were very abundant. Early in the morning, I took a walk\r\nover the island, and gathered a few plants; during the day the heat was\r\nmost intolerable, the thermometer in the shade about noon, indicating\r\n99½°, and as there was not the slightest breath of wind, the oppressive\r\nsensation amounted almost to suffocation, the air feeling as if it came\r\nfrom the mouth of an oven. Not a soul was to be seen out of doors, and\r\nthe few goats and pigs on the island, as well as the dogs, sought the\r\nshade of a few trees of _Zizyphus_ which grow by the side of the river\r\nnear the village. Everything was as still as midnight, the songs of the\r\nsmall birds which I had listened to with delight during my morning’s\r\nwalk, and the loud shrill cry of the Gavata, a large water bird, as\r\nwell as the monotonous one of the Bem-te-ve, were now no longer heard,\r\neven the trees were motionless, and the mighty mass of yellow water in\r\nthe river rolled slowly down unruffled by a breeze; all was indeed so\r\nstill, that one could scarcely help thinking that life had ceased to\r\nexist. Having slung my hammock under a _Zizyphus_ tree, I remained in\r\nit till the rays of the sun became less powerful. It was six o’clock\r\nin the evening before the sea breeze reached the island, and it being\r\nthen too late to proceed on our voyage, we remained where we were for\r\nthe night. The sun had no sooner set, and the breeze become more fresh,\r\nthan the greater number of the inhabitants left their houses, and seated\r\nthemselves either at their doors or by the side of the river, to enjoy\r\nthe delicious coolness of the evening air; of course I followed their\r\nexample, and it was near midnight before I retired to rest.\r\n\r\nThe number of families on the island amounts to about forty, and they\r\nare for the most part civilized Indians. On the evening of our arrival I\r\nwas presented to their captain, an old man dressed in a leather hat, a\r\npair of coarse cotton drawers, a shirt of the same material, and a pair\r\nof leather sandals on his feet, who was sitting under a _Zizyphus_ tree\r\nrepairing a fishing net. From him I learned that the Indians on the\r\nisland are decreasing gradually in number, and he sighed when he told\r\nme that the day was not far distant when his race would become extinct,\r\nor at least be amalgamated with the other inhabitants. Those who still\r\nremain unmixed, are short in stature and of a stout make; in disposition\r\nthey appeared gentle and obliging. I observed a church in the village,\r\nbut during my visit the priest was absent on the main land.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 28th, the second since our arrival, I again took a\r\nwalk over the island, and in the centre found a large tract covered with\r\na very prickly species of _Opuntia_, covered with the Cochineal insect.\r\nI also collected several species of _Viscum_ and _Loranthus_, growing on\r\nthe branches of _Mimosa_ and _Zizyphus_ trees; while the sandy shores\r\nof the south side of the island yielded me abundance of _Ehrenbergia\r\ntribuloides_, Mart., and a Lupin-like kind of _Zornia_. The morning was\r\ncomparatively cool, but the day was calm and sultry, the thermometer\r\nstanding at 96° in the shade. As it was again six o’clock in the evening\r\nbefore the breeze set in, we were once more detained. The setting in of\r\nthe breeze was accompanied with a curious appearance in the atmosphere;\r\nthe sun was setting in the west with a fiery redness, surrounded by a\r\nmass of red coloured clouds, while from the eastward was seen approaching\r\nan immense body of vapour; this, from the distance at which it was seen,\r\nhad more the appearance of smoke issuing from some great conflagration.\r\nThis body came slowly on before the wind till at last it reached us, and\r\nwe could see the small vesicles of which it was composed rolling past.\r\nThe wind for about five minutes was so hot that every one was glad to\r\ntake shelter from it, but it soon acquired its usual refreshing coolness.\r\nOn inquiring of the old captain whether such a phenomenon was often\r\nobserved, he told me that it was of frequent occurrence at the beginning\r\nof the rainy season, and added, that long experience had taught him it\r\nwas always the forerunner of a great storm (_hum temporal_.)\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the first of March, we left the island, about\r\nhalf-past five o’clock in the evening, and had not been gone an hour\r\nbefore the sky towards the N.E. became darkened with a mass of black\r\nclouds, the sure harbinger of a coming storm. We were then nearly in the\r\nmiddle of the river, which was about a league broad; and as the storm was\r\napproaching with great rapidity, the master of the canoe gave instant\r\norders to run her in to the north shore, but before we had reached the\r\ndistance, we were overtaken by a gust of wind which laid her nearly on\r\nher broadside. A considerable quantity of water was shipped, and the crew\r\nlost all command of themselves, one crying to do this, and another that,\r\nwithout anything being done. The lower part of the sail on the lee side\r\nwas in the water keeping the edge of the canoe down, and had it not been\r\nfor my exertions and my man Pedro’s assistance, in seizing hold of the\r\nrope by which the extreme point of the long boom is drawn up to the mast\r\nhead, and thus raising it out of the water, the canoe, to a certainty,\r\nwould have filled, and we should all have been inevitably drowned. Still\r\nwe were at some distance from the river bank, and the storm was setting\r\nin with all its fury, the waves were dashing over the weather gunnel,\r\nwhile the lee side was taking in great quantities of water. In the\r\nmeantime the sails had been stowed away, and seeing the danger of keeping\r\nher broadside any longer to the wind, the master gave orders to run her\r\nover to the other side of the river before the wind. We thus steered\r\nin an oblique direction nearly three miles before we reached the south\r\nside, and during this fearful interval the wind, the rain, thunder and\r\nlightning were such as I had never before been exposed to. It was now\r\nquite dark, but the vivid flashes both of forked and sheet lightning gave\r\na light, from time to time, as brilliant nearly as noon-day. The canoe\r\nran aground among some small trees to two of which she was made fast; the\r\nrain continued to fall in torrents for nearly two hours, and from our\r\nunavoidable exposure to its influence we were all drenched to the skin.\r\nWhen the storm had entirely exhausted itself, we found that the wind had\r\ndied away also, and as we could not resume our voyage, we determined to\r\nreturn with the current to the island of San Pedro. This we accordingly\r\ndid, and had to remain in our wet clothes during the greater part of the\r\nnight. In going down I observed a number of large meteors passing from\r\nthe N.E. to the S.W. following the course of the storm.\r\n\r\nThe two following days were again calm, with heavy thunder-storms in\r\nthe evening, so that we were compelled to remain all this time on the\r\nisland. A more serious event, however, now occurred to detain me among\r\nthe Indians. The day after the storm before mentioned, I found myself\r\nfeverish and unwell, and two days after this I was severely attacked\r\nwith dysentery, which is of frequent occurrence at this season, caused\r\nno doubt by the sudden transitions of temperature. In the meantime a\r\nfavourable breeze had sprung up, and as I was far too ill to proceed,\r\nthe canoe was obliged to sail without me; I was thus left behind in\r\nan old hut, the floor of which was still wet from having been a short\r\ntime before overflowed by the river. In this place I was confined to\r\nmy hammock for five days, during which time I was so ill that I never\r\nexpected to recover; from being in robust health, I was in the course\r\nof a few days reduced to a mere shadow, with scarcely the power, when\r\nI did get out of my hammock, to drag one leg after the other. I felt\r\nseverely the want of my medicine-chest, which I had left behind at\r\nMaceio, not wishing in this excursion to encumber myself with luggage; my\r\nonly resource, therefore, was to trust to the remedial agents employed\r\nby the people themselves. This I found to consist in the use of castor\r\noil, which is commonly made on the island, and afterwards a drink, _ad\r\nlibitum_, of strong lemonades of vinegar and white sugar. There was\r\nonly one venda in the village, in which the latter materials were to\r\nbe obtained, but where, strange to say, the only other purchaseable\r\narticle was rum. Nothing in the shape of provisions was to be had for any\r\nconsideration, and as our long stay here had completely exhausted our\r\nstock, both Pedro and I were almost reduced to a state of starvation. Not\r\neven a particle of farinha was to be had, and had we not been supplied\r\nwith a fowl or two by an old Indian woman, who attended very kindly upon\r\nme during my illness, we should have been miserably destitute. While\r\nstill confined to my bed, I sent Pedro to another small village a few\r\nleagues further up the river, to purchase, if possible, some provisions,\r\nbut he returned altogether unsuccessful. My chief regret was for this\r\npoor fellow, for he was well and felt the pangs of hunger far more keenly\r\nthan I did. In the meantime a canoe fortunately arrived at the island\r\nwith a little farinha for sale, of which I bought as much, at four times\r\nthe usual price, as would suffice to take us back again to Penêdo,\r\nfor I had now renounced all idea of going further up the river. The\r\npoor inhabitants of the island were themselves literally in a state of\r\nstarvation, their principal food being the fruit of _Geoffroya superba_,\r\nthe produce of a small tree growing rather abundantly on the south side\r\nof the island. It reaches to the height of nearly twenty feet, and\r\nproduces a fleshy drupe about the size of a walnut; it is called _umarí_\r\nby the Indians. In almost every house, whether Indian or Brazilian, I\r\nobserved a large pot of this fruit preparing, either indoors over a fire\r\nmade on the floor, or on the ground under a tree in the neighbourhood\r\nof the house. As soon as they are nearly ready, groups of children in a\r\nstate of nudity, and half naked men and women seat themselves around the\r\npot, each furnished with two stones, a larger and a smaller one, for the\r\npurpose of breaking the nut after they have devoured the outward fleshy\r\npart; the taste of the kernel is not unlike that of boiled beans. Fish\r\nis in general the staple food of these people, but it is difficult to\r\nprocure when the river is much flooded.\r\n\r\nAt the west end of the village there is a large wide-spreading _Zizyphus_\r\ntree standing alone, and as these trees retain their dense covering of\r\nleaves all the year round, their shade is sought after both by men and\r\nanimals during the excessive heat of the day. Under that of which I now\r\nspeak were to be seen a number of villagers of both sexes, the women\r\nsquatting on mats spread on the ground, and occupied in spinning with\r\na distaff a coarse kind of cotton yarn used principally as wicks for\r\ntapers, which they make of a brown coloured native wax. The men are much\r\nless industrious than the women, being generally to be seen standing\r\nabout in a state of idleness, or swinging in their hammocks either in\r\ntheir houses or beneath the shade of a tree. Under the large _Zizyphus_\r\ntree several hammocks are hung up every morning, and they are seldom\r\nunoccupied. On Sundays the women lay aside their spinning apparatus,\r\nbut immediately after mass, groups of them may be seen playing cards,\r\nat which they continue during the whole day; as they do not play for\r\nmoney, they use only french beans as counters. Until I gained sufficient\r\nstrength to leave the island, I also spent much of my time under the\r\nshade of this tree, either listening to the conversation of these people,\r\nor answering the thousand and one questions put by them respecting my\r\nown and other distant countries. These questions were often sufficiently\r\nridiculous, and I could often perceive that my answers were considered\r\nstretches of the long bow, although they were too polite to say so;\r\nnor was it only among the poor islanders of San Pedro, that I observed\r\nthis to be the case, for the same often occurred among those who were\r\nconsidered well educated people. I remember once to have been conversing\r\nwith the President of one of the inland provinces about Steam Navigation,\r\nand on telling him that many of the English Steam-boats were now entirely\r\nconstructed of iron, he did not say he did not believe me, but simply\r\nremarked “that in Brazil, when iron was put into the water it always\r\nsank.”\r\n\r\nOn the twelfth of March I took leave of my Indian friends, and embarked\r\nin a canoe which I hired to take me down to Penêdo, having been exactly\r\na fortnight on the island. We reached that place on the morning of the\r\nfourteenth, when I received a kind welcome from my friend the Juiz de\r\nDireito. I landed several times during the passage, for the purpose of\r\nmaking collections of living plants of the different kinds of _Cacti_,\r\nwhich grow in great abundance on the banks of the river, wherever they\r\nare rocky. At one of the places where we stopped, I observed several\r\nfine trees of _Peltophorum Vogelianum_, Benth. This tree, which belongs\r\nto the natural order _Leguminosæ_, reaches to the height of about forty\r\nfeet, and has a great branching top: the leaves are large but very much\r\nsubdivided, and very graceful, having more the appearance of the frond\r\nof a fern, than the leaf of a tree. The racemes of flowers which grow\r\nat the ends of the branches, are often more than a foot long, and the\r\nflowers are of a beautiful golden colour; at a distance it presents a\r\nmore magnificent appearance, than almost any other tree I have seen. The\r\ncanoe was carried down the stream by the force of the current, but in\r\nthe afternoon, and during the greater part of the night, the sea breeze\r\nblew so strong as to impede our progress. The boatmen, however, adopted\r\na plan to overcome this, which I have never seen elsewhere, nor even\r\nheard of, and I will therefore explain it in a few words. Landing at a\r\nplace where the trees grew in abundance, the men set to work, and cut\r\noff a considerable number of branches, which were tied tightly together\r\nwith cords, one end of a long rope was made fast round its middle, while\r\nthe other end was secured to the canoe. They then steered for a part of\r\nthe river where the current was strong, and threw the bundle overboard,\r\nwhich being heavy from its green state, floated just below the surface\r\nof the water, and in this manner being entirely out of the influence of\r\nthe wind, it received the whole force of the current, by which means the\r\ncanoe was dragged down at a rate little inferior to that by which we\r\ndescended during the calm of the day.\r\n\r\nI remained at Penêdo eight days, and, thanks to the very great kindness\r\nI received from the Juiz de Direito, my health rapidly improved, and\r\nI was enabled to make several little excursions in the neighbourhood.\r\nThe Juiz is one of the few Brazilians I came in contact with, for whom\r\nI entertain feelings of esteem and respect. I found him to be a man of\r\ngreat intelligence, and well educated, having studied at the University\r\nof Coimbra. Even among the litigious Brazilians he was respected as a\r\njudge; and, indeed, both his opinions and actions were those of a mind\r\ndeeply imbued with benevolence. At Coimbra he had paid some attention\r\nto the study of Botany, to which he was still partial, but more to\r\nthe theoretical that to the practical department. He had made the\r\nacquaintance of M. Reidel and Dr. Natterer, both of whom had lived with\r\nhim some years before, when he was residing in Pará. In the society of\r\nthis excellent man, as well as in that of his brother, a priest who was\r\nthen on a visit to him from Bahia, in the perusal of his books, and in\r\nvisiting some families in the town, my time passed away very agreeably.\r\n\r\nOne day I went to Villa Nova, to visit a Colonel Bento Mello Pereira,\r\nthe owner of a large sugar plantation. After receiving an invitation to\r\nreturn to dinner, I walked over to view his plantation, which was about\r\ntwo miles distant, but did not meet with much to reward my toil, for the\r\nsun was hot, and the country dry and sandy. I reached his house again\r\na little before two o’clock, that being the dinner hour, where I found\r\nthat two other persons, both belonging to the place, had been invited\r\nalso. The dinner was both substantial and excellent, being served up\r\nwith some degree of ostentation. We had a slave to wait upon each of us,\r\nand before beginning, a little black fellow supplied us with water from\r\na large silver ewer in a silver basin to wash our hands, bearing round\r\nhis shoulders a long towel with which to dry them. After dinner he took\r\nme to see a vessel he was building a little above the town; it was about\r\none hundred and fifty tons burden, and nearly ready for launching. He\r\nintended her to trade along the coast, but principally to convey sugar\r\nto Bahia; the planking consisted of _Pao Amarello_ and _Oiti_, said to\r\nbe the two best woods for ship-building in the north of Brazil. I do not\r\nknow to what genus the _Pao Amarello_ belongs, but the _Oiti_ is the\r\n_Moquilea tomentosa_ of Bentham, first described from specimens which I\r\nforwarded to him from Pernambuco.\r\n\r\nA proposal has recently been made to establish a communication by steam\r\nnavigation, between the coast and the interior central provinces of\r\nBrazil, by means of the Rio de San Francisco. Upon a mere inspection of\r\nthe map of this portion of the Empire, it would seem that every facility\r\nfor this specious proposition has been offered by nature; an easy, cheap,\r\nalthough somewhat circuitous water conveyance leads directly from the\r\nsea on the confines of the province of Pernambuco into the heart of\r\nthe inland, rich, and comparatively well-populated mining and diamond\r\ndistricts, which are separated from the great markets of Rio de Janeiro\r\nand Bahia by lofty mountain barriers, always difficult of access, and\r\nwhere the means of transport are tedious and costly. I have great doubts\r\nwhether this plan will ever be carried into effect, in support of which\r\nopinion I will adduce three very substantial reasons.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the bar at the mouth of the river is about two\r\nleagues broad, is always covered with a heavy surf, and has seldom more\r\nthan four feet of water on it. In the second place, at the falls of\r\nPaulo Affonço there is a series of rapids and falls about sixty miles in\r\nlength, forming a serious obstacle to the progress of any navigation.\r\nIn the third place, there is a very limited population throughout the\r\nintervening country, which is not likely to increase, owing to the desert\r\nnature of the greater portion of the interior; from these causes the\r\namount of produce likely to be taken to the coast must, consequently, be\r\nvery small indeed, so that the enterprize would not be likely to succeed\r\nin a pecuniary point of view, even were it otherwise practicable. Were\r\nthe interior of the middle portion of Brazil as fertile as is generally\r\nsupposed to be by those who have never visited it, hopes might be\r\nentertained of its becoming hereafter a rich agricultural district, such\r\nas the belt of country along the coast is found to be; in that case some\r\ngreat national undertaking for rendering communication more easy, might\r\nbe looked for; but while it exists as a dry arid tract scarcely fit\r\nfor the rearing of cattle, it is not at all likely that any Brazilian\r\nat least will sink his money in attempting to render the San Francisco\r\nnavigable. A company of Englishmen may probably be induced in periods of\r\ninfectious speculation to venture upon this attempt, for some of the late\r\nill-concerted schemes in Brazil have been far more absurd; in testimony\r\nof which we may instance that monument of folly, the Rio Doce Company.\r\n\r\nThe North Americans, particularly those of the back settlements, are\r\ncelebrated for their inquisitiveness; but this seems to be a very general\r\nfailing with all those who are shut out from frequent intercourse with\r\nstrangers. A curious instance of this feeling occurred a few days after I\r\nreturned to Penêdo. I had brought letters from Maceio to a gentleman who\r\nlived here with a married brother, they were among the most respectable\r\npeople in the place. Although not yet eleven o’clock, I found the lady,\r\na remarkably fine and good-looking woman, with her husband busily engaged\r\nat cards, she lying in a hammock, while he was seated on a chair beside\r\nher; she had recently been smoking, an almost universal accomplishment\r\namong the ladies of the interior, as a long pipe was lying near her, and\r\nthe floor beneath bore strong indications of excessive expectoration. I\r\nwas desired to be seated, and was immediately inundated with a flood of\r\nquestions from the good lady who possessed great volubility of tongue.\r\nAmong a host of others I may enumerate the following. What countryman are\r\nyou? What is your name? How old are you? Are you a medical man? Are you\r\nmarried? Are your father and mother alive? What are their names? Have you\r\nany sisters? What are their names? Have you any brothers? What are their\r\nnames? Have all your countrymen blue eyes? Have you churches and priests\r\nin your country? Do oranges and bananas grow there? &c., &c. If, however,\r\nshe was inquisitive about my concerns, she was not less disposed to\r\ntell me much that related to herself. Thus she informed me that she was\r\nmarried when she was nineteen years of age, that she was now five years\r\nmarried, and in that time had presented her husband with a yearly gift,\r\nall of whom were alive with the exception of one. Her husband, she said,\r\nwas thirty-six years of age, and she desired me to feel his pulse, as he\r\nwas always complaining of bad health. I soon discovered his complaint\r\nto be indigestion, one of the most frequent ills that Brazilians are\r\nsubject to, arising, no doubt, from the enormous quantities which they\r\neat, and that generally not of the most digestive materials, as well as\r\nfrom the heavy late suppers which they indulge in. I had then to feel\r\nher pulse in turn, and she seemed much pleased when I told her it was an\r\nexcellent one. I afterwards became very intimate with them, and spent\r\nmany agreeable hours in their society; their brother to whom I brought\r\nthe letters was a lawyer, and a well-educated and intelligent man.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 21st I bade adieu to the Juiz, and my other\r\nfriends in Penêdo, and between eight and nine o’clock in the evening\r\nembarked in a canoe which I had hired to take me down to Piassabassú,\r\nwhich we reached after a sail of little more than four hours. As I knew\r\nof no house to go to, I was obliged to pass the remainder of the night\r\nin the canoe, tormented by mosquitos, which were in such abundance that\r\nlong ere morning I was forced to go on shore, and walk up and down till\r\ndaylight. The house in which I slept when I passed through the village\r\nbefore, was now empty, but I was allowed to occupy it, and as I could not\r\nget a cart to convey me to Peba before the following evening, I had to\r\nremain here a longer time than I intended. This interval I devoted to a\r\nfew botanical excursions in the neighbourhood, and thereby added several\r\nnew plants to my collections. On reaching Peba, I again had the use of\r\nthe little hut which I formerly occupied, and was obliged to remain\r\nthere two days before I could hire a jangada to take me to Maceio; that\r\nwhich I engaged was a fine large one that had never been to sea; and on\r\nthe morning of the 26th, having got all my collections and luggage put\r\non board, we began our voyage. Peba I found to be nearly, if not quite,\r\nas poor a place as the Ilha de San Pedro, and not a single article of\r\nprovision could be purchased there. Its inhabitants are principally\r\nfishermen, and their chief food is fish and farinha; a want of success\r\nin the fishery and a bad crop of mandiocca had thrown them quite into a\r\nstate of starvation. On the evening before we started, Pedro contrived\r\nsomewhere to purchase a chicken; and when we embarked, our whole stock\r\nof provisions consisted of one of its wings, and a few green cocoa-nuts.\r\nBefore we left, the owner of the canoe sent to Piassabassú to purchase\r\nfarinha or French beans, as sea stock for his men, but neither were\r\nto be procured; the crew, therefore, consisting of three men, had to\r\ncontent themselves with only a few green cocoa-nuts. It rained the whole\r\nof the first day, but the elevated part of the jangada on which I lay,\r\nbeing well roofed over with cocoa-nut leaves, I suffered but little\r\ninconvenience in consequence. At night we did not put in to shore, as\r\nis usual with these crafts, the men being as anxious as myself to reach\r\nMaceio, but the wind being light, we could not make much progress. During\r\nthe succeeding day the winds were again light, but having freshened\r\ntowards evening we reached Maceio about 8 o’clock P.M.; the surf,\r\nhowever, running so high along the beach that I would not allow the\r\njangada to run ashore, as by doing so my collections would have been\r\ncompletely spoiled. The crew wished me to remain on board till the tide\r\nwent out, but I had suffered too much from hunger during the voyage,\r\nto think of staying any longer; so leaping into the water with Pedro,\r\nimmediately after a large wave had passed us, we followed it, and reached\r\nthe shore before another had time to overtake us, but not without being\r\ncompletely drenched. Leaving everything on board to be landed next day, I\r\nimmediately set off for the house of Mr. Burnett, about a mile distant,\r\nand arrived just in time for tea, when, after changing my clothes I made\r\na most comfortable meal, being the first I had enjoyed for two days.\r\n\r\nWishing to see the city of Alagoas, the capital of the province, I\r\nmade arrangements for visiting it, and started from Maceio on the\r\n31st of March. This city is situated on the south side of a large\r\nlake, which runs inland about forty miles, and is about twenty miles\r\ndistant from Maceio. There is a narrow entrance to the lake from the\r\nsea, about two leagues to the south of the latter place; but still\r\nfurther to the southward, there is another inlet from the sea, which\r\nruns northward to within a mile of the town, and by means of a small\r\ncanal which has been cut, canoes can now approach within a very short\r\ndistance of the houses. Accompanied by a young countryman, I embarked\r\nin a light canoe about midnight, with the view of reaching Alagoas\r\nearly in the morning, and thus escape exposure on the water during the\r\nheat of the day. My man Pedro was our only navigator, who used a long\r\npole, the mode usually adopted for propelling canoes, as the lake is\r\nextremely shallow. As soon as we were fairly afloat on the canal, we\r\nlaid down in the bottom of the canoe to sleep, but failed to do so,\r\nin consequence of the myriads of mosquitos and sand-flies that almost\r\nfill the atmosphere among the mangroves which abound along the muddy\r\nshores. At eight o’clock in the morning we came in sight of the city,\r\nwhich is built upon a somewhat elevated situation, and as the houses\r\nare rather large, and intermingled with numerous churches, and lofty\r\nmango trees, it has really an enchanting appearance when seen in the\r\ndistance. In about an hour afterwards we landed, and as I had brought no\r\nletters of recommendation, I despatched Pedro to look out for a house\r\nwhere we could remain till morning, but he returned after being an hour\r\nabsent, with the intelligence that none was to be obtained. This did\r\nnot annoy me much, as we found an old house close to where we landed,\r\nwhere I proposed to remain, especially as the weather was fine, the only\r\nshelter we required being shade. Just, however, as we were about to\r\nremove our luggage thither, the owner of an adjoining house perceiving\r\nthat we were strangers, invited us to take up our quarters with him,\r\nan invitation which we readily accepted, as it would be not only more\r\ncomfortable, but would allow us greater freedom to walk about. Like most\r\nother Brazilian cities in which I have been, Alagoas looks better from\r\na distance than on close inspection; and as in the instance of Penêdo,\r\nit has all the appearance of having once been a much more flourishing\r\nplace than it now is, the expulsion of the Portuguese having given its\r\nindustry a death blow, from which it is not soon likely to recover. The\r\nhouses are for the most part built of stone, and many of them are what\r\nare called _Sobrados_, that is, consist of more stories than one, but\r\nmany of them are falling into decay; even the principal streets are\r\novergrown with grass and other weeds, and have a deserted appearance.\r\nThe finest buildings are the churches and convents; of the former there\r\nare eight, and of the latter two in number. It being the seat of the\r\nprovincial government, the President resides there, but as Maceio is the\r\nchief place of trade, there is also a government house in that town for\r\nhis accommodation, when he visits it, as he frequently does, for the\r\ntransaction of business. The population of Alagoas amounts to about 6000.\r\nOn one or two occasions that I walked through the principal streets I\r\nsaw very few people, and they for the most part were bare-footed, ragged\r\nmulatto and Indian soldiers, two of whom were keeping guard at the house\r\nof the President.\r\n\r\nThe chief productions of the country around Alagoas are sugar, cotton,\r\nand a little mandiocca. At the time of my visit great complaints were\r\nmade of the scarcity of provisions, but it is impossible to feel much\r\ncommiseration for the starving condition of the poor people, when it\r\nis known that it is entirely owing to their own want of industry that\r\nsufficient crops of mandiocca are not raised, not only for their own\r\nconsumption, but for exportation to other parts of the country. There is\r\nabundance of ground around the city lying waste, which is well adapted\r\nfor the growth of this plant, and but little labour suffices for its\r\ncultivation, but the indolent disposition of the people is such, that,\r\nwith all the advantages which the country offers, they are contented to\r\nobtain just sufficient for immediate use and seldom look forward to the\r\nfuture. Towards the head of the lake, the country is said to be much\r\nricher than it is near the city, and it is in that direction that the\r\nlargest and most productive sugar and cotton plantations are seen. The\r\nlake is not of sufficient depth to admit of vessels of any size, all\r\ntraffic between the sea and the city is carried on in large canoes, and\r\na small class of flat-bottomed sailing vessels called Lanchas. Opposite\r\nthe city the lake is about a league broad, the water is quite fresh, and\r\nyields abundance of fine fish, which forms the chief part of the animal\r\nfood of the inhabitants, to whom it is sold at a very cheap rate. Much\r\nfine timber is floated down the lake from the upper parts of the country\r\nfor exportation along the coast; the two wooden bridges at Pernambuco are\r\nfor the most part constructed of it.\r\n\r\nDuring my rambles in this neighbourhood, I found several species of\r\nplants which I had not previously met with. In a small stream of\r\nbeautifully clear water the curious _Cabomba aquatica_, Aubl., grows\r\nabundantly, which to the Botanist is a most interesting plant, as,\r\nboth in habit and structure, it forms a transition link between the\r\n_Ranunculus_ family and that of the water lilies. In the same stream\r\nI likewise collected specimens of a _Marsilæa_, a pale blue flowered\r\n_Pontederia_, and a large white flowered _Nymphæa_ different from that\r\nwhich grows in the lake at Olinda. In brackish water a little above\r\nMaceio, a _Potamogeton_ grows in vast quantities, which on comparison,\r\ndoes not seem to differ from the British _P. pectinatus_. We returned\r\nto Maceio by daylight, and I observed that the shores abound with\r\nMangroves, principally _Rhizophora Mangle_, which reaches here to a much\r\ngreater size than I have elsewhere seen it, some of the trees being, at\r\nleast, thirty feet high, with stems proportionally thick; it presents a\r\ncurious appearance, the large roots supporting the stems at the height\r\nof several feet above the water, and curving outwards and downwards; if\r\nthe real top were not seen, we could almost fancy that the tree had been\r\nreversed; the long pendent radicles of the seeds are also remarkable, as\r\nthey are thrown down to the ground while the fruit is yet attached to the\r\nparent plant. The wood of this tree is very much used as fuel, it burns\r\nextremely well in the green state; at Maranham little else is used for\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 20th of April I left Maceio, in a little vessel\r\nloaded with cotton, and arrived at Pernambuco on the evening of the 24th,\r\ntaking Pedro with me, he having agreed to accompany me on my projected\r\njourney into the interior. The only thing which I observed worthy notice\r\non the passage, was a mode of fishing that was new to me. Towards the\r\nevening of the third day, while running along between the reef and the\r\nshore, the vessel grounded on a sand bank, the tide being then about\r\nhalf ebb. Having laid down to sleep on the deck, I awoke about nine\r\no’clock, and was surprised to see a great number of lights moving quickly\r\nbetween the shore and the reef, and extending as far as I could see. Our\r\nboatmen were at this time sound asleep, but as the tide was now out,\r\nand the ground around us dry, I made for the nearest lights, and found\r\nthem to belong to a man and boy, both of whom were naked, each having a\r\nlighted torch in his left hand, a long sword-knife in the right, with a\r\nsmall basket suspended round the neck by a thick piece of cord. I soon\r\ndiscovered they were engaged in killing the small fish which the tide\r\nhad left in the shallow pools of water inside the reef. They walked\r\nsomewhat quickly along, holding the flaming torch pretty close to the\r\nwater, by which means the fish, not above three inches long, were very\r\ndistinctly perceived, and when seen, immediately struck with the sword,\r\nquickly picked up, and put into the basket. This man told me that all\r\nhe expected to get, would scarcely suffice for the supper of the four\r\nindividuals comprising his family. As the tide came in, the lights were\r\nseen receding towards the shore, and gradually becoming extinct. The\r\nmaterial of which the torches are made, is the wood of a fine large\r\narborescent species of _Bignonia_, to which the Brazilians give the name\r\nof _Pao d’Arco_, from the circumstance of its being used by the Indians\r\nto make their bows. They split this wood into thin splinters, a number\r\nof which are tied together, and when lighted, it burns with a very clear\r\nflame. Before castor oil was so much cultivated as it now is, this kind\r\nof light was extensively used by the country people, even in their\r\nsugar-houses and other works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCEARA.\r\n\r\nPERNAMBUCO TO CRATO.\r\n\r\n    The Author leaves Pernambuco in a Coasting Vessel—Description\r\n    of the Voyage—Touches at Cape San Roque—Arrives at\r\n    Aracaty—Seaport of Province of Ceará—Town described—its\r\n    Trade—Whole Province subject to great droughts—Commencement of\r\n    Journey into the Interior—Passes Villa de San Bernardo—Arid\r\n    nature of the Country—Catingas—Arrives at Icó—Town\r\n    described—Journey continued—Villa da Lavra de Mangabeira—Gold\r\n    washings abandoned—Country begins to improve—Reaches the\r\n    Villa do Crato—Town described—Low state of morals among the\r\n    Inhabitants—Sugar Plantations—Mode of Manufacture—Coarse\r\n    kind of Sugar formed into Cakes called Rapadura, in which\r\n    state it is used throughout the Province—State of Cultivation\r\n    in the Neighbourhood—Productions of the Country—Serra de\r\n    Araripe—Different kinds of timber—Wild fruits—Wandering Tribes\r\n    of Gypsies frequent—Great religious Festival—Climate—Diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn my return to Pernambuco from Maceio, Dr. Loudon kindly afforded me\r\nthe use of his country residence, he having removed into the town, and\r\nI remained here from the end of April to the beginning of July. At the\r\ntime of going there, the rainy season had just set in, when I observed\r\nthe very striking effect which a few showers had already produced on the\r\nvegetation. Three months before, I had left the whole herbage scorched\r\nand withered while the trees had a brown and sickly appearance; now all\r\nwas fresh and verdant; grass and other herbaceous plants were covering\r\nthe face of the earth, and bursting into bloom; and the shrubs and trees\r\nhad assumed their summer dress, the deep green of the leaves harmonizing\r\nwell with their various coloured flowers. The rainy season is here\r\ngenerally expected to commence about the middle or end of April, and\r\ncontinues till about the middle of August. At first, the rains fall in\r\nheavy showers, accompanied with thunder and lightning, but ultimately\r\nthey become more frequent, lasting for half or an entire day, or even\r\nseveral successive days, with but very short intermissions; the longest\r\nperiod I knew it to rain without cessation, being thirty-six hours. At\r\nthis season from the flatness of the country, the roads are so completely\r\nflooded, that it is impossible to move out on foot; and the atmosphere is\r\nso thoroughly saturated with moisture, that everything acquires a coating\r\nof blue mould; even books get so damp, that, unless exposed to the first\r\nsun-shine, they become musty and are spoiled.\r\n\r\nAs it was impossible to stir much abroad, I occupied myself with\r\narranging and packing my collections from Alagoas, in making preparations\r\nfor my inland journey, and in dissecting and examining the structure of\r\nnumerous animals found in the neighbourhood. I also made it my endeavour\r\nto ascertain which was the best route for the journey I had in view.\r\nThose who had visited the interior strongly recommended me to proceed by\r\nsea to Aracaty, a town in the province of Ceará, about two and a half\r\ndegrees to the North of Pernambuco, and to start inland from that port,\r\nthe roads being rather better than those leading from other parts of the\r\ncoast, and horses cheaper. I therefore determined to adopt this plan,\r\nand in the end found no cause to repent having done so. I received the\r\nbest information from two Portuguese merchants, named Pinto, who resided\r\nat Icó, a large town in the interior of the province of Ceará, and who\r\nhad come to Pernambuco to purchase goods, which they are in the habit of\r\ndoing once in every two or three years: they were the most influential\r\npeople in that quarter, and I considered myself fortunate in making their\r\nacquaintance. In order to convey their goods to Aracaty, they had hired\r\na small schooner, and accordingly I engaged a passage for myself and\r\nservant in the same vessel. A few days before we sailed, I called with\r\nMr. Goring, H.B.M. Vice Consul, upon the Vice-President of the province,\r\nSenhor Francisco de Paulo Cavalcante d’Albuquerque, (the President\r\nbeing then absent at Rio,) with the view of obtaining my passport; we\r\nwere kindly received, but with less frankness than when I visited the\r\nlate President Camargo; Senhor Albuquerque is a man of considerable\r\nproperty, and belongs to one of the first and oldest families in the\r\nnorth of Brazil. Besides the passport, he sent me the next day letters of\r\nrecommendation to the Presidents of Ceará and Piauhy.\r\n\r\nAfter a delay of several days, I embarked at noon on the 19th of July,\r\nin the Maria Luiza, a schooner of about one hundred tons burden; she\r\nwas deeply laden, the cabin and deck, as well as the entire hold, being\r\ncrammed with goods. We had, altogether, seventeen passengers on board,\r\nbesides an equal number of negro servants or slaves; all brought much\r\nluggage with them, so that the whole of the after-deck was completely\r\ncovered with trunks and packages heaped on each other, the only clear\r\nspace left being that requisite for the steersman; on each side were two\r\nkennel-like boxes, which served as the sleeping berths of the two Pintos,\r\nall the other passengers being obliged to make the best provision for\r\nthemselves upon deck in the open air, for there was no accommodation\r\nwhatever below, even for taking meals, every one, therefore, looked\r\nout for the most convenient corner to sit or lie down in. I could find\r\nno better quarters than those upon my own trunks, one of which being\r\nmuch higher than the other, offered a miserably hard couch, on which\r\nI was obliged to sleep at night. This was rendered still worse by the\r\nbad weather, for no sooner had we quitted the harbour than it began\r\nto rain heavily, from which no shelter could be obtained, except that\r\nafforded by my poncho and umbrella, which did not long prevent me from\r\nbeing completely drenched. The misery of my situation may therefore be\r\nwell imagined, and if some of my previous voyages were disagreeable,\r\nthis was wretched in the extreme. My suffering was much aggravated by\r\nsea-sickness, from which I had always been quite free, but I experienced\r\nmuch inconvenience from this cause during the first two days, arising\r\nprincipally from too close contiguity to my fellow-passengers; under\r\nany circumstances there is no malady that so entirely prostrates both\r\nmind and body, but in my present position, sometimes exposed to the\r\nburning rays of the sun, at others to heavy rains without the power\r\nor means of sheltering myself from their influence, this feeling was\r\ngreatly aggravated. By the evening of the second day, I found myself so\r\nmuch recovered as to be able to sit up, and on the following morning to\r\neat a little, my only food having been hitherto a few oranges, the most\r\ngrateful of all things to a sick person. Many of my companions did not\r\nfare so well, as they continued to suffer till the end of the voyage.\r\n\r\nFor my passage and that of my black servant I paid twenty-six mil-reis,\r\nabout three pounds five shillings sterling, which included provisions.\r\nThese were regularly served out three times a day by the captain from\r\nthe top of the companion, and on these occasions, I was always greatly\r\namused at the scenes which took place; every one rushed forward for his\r\nportion, and sometimes groups of twos, threes, and fours were to be seen\r\neating with their fingers out of the same dish. There were only a few\r\nknives and forks, not nearly sufficient for the number of passengers, and\r\nthese fell always to the share of those first served. Our food consisted\r\nfor the most part of minced dried beef boiled with rice, to which was\r\nadded morning and evening a cup of tea, and at dinner a bottle or two of\r\nmiserable red wine.\r\n\r\nOne of my fellow-passengers was too remarkable a person not to be made\r\nmention of; he was an active, slender little fellow, about thirty years\r\nof age, rather well dressed, his physiognomy denoting a remarkable\r\ndevelopment of the organ of language, a qualification which I found fully\r\nconfirmed in him; he seemed to be well known to the other passengers,\r\nbeguiled much of the tedium of the voyage by his amusing and extravagant\r\nstories, for which he possessed great talent, and seldom have I listened\r\nto one whose powers were greater in this respect. He was often called\r\nupon for a song, on which occasion he was accompanied by a young man who\r\nplayed well on the guitar. He told me that he was a native of Pernambuco\r\nand had visited Lisbon, and all the sea-ports between Buenos Ayres and\r\nParà, and he described many of the adventures that befell him on several\r\nof these occasions. In recounting these tales he generally seated himself\r\ncross-legged on the companion, and as he proceeded, his listeners were\r\nkept in one continued roar of laughter. The adventures of Gil Blas\r\nwere nothing compared with his, and it is not improbable that many were\r\nmanufactured for the occasion.\r\n\r\nAbout noon of the second day we passed Cape St. Roque, and in the evening\r\ncame to anchor in a small bay inside the reef, within a short distance\r\nof a suspicious-looking schooner, which I have no doubt came in here\r\nto land a cargo of slaves, as there was no likelihood of her being in\r\nthis solitary place for any other purpose. Early next morning we again\r\ngot outside the reef, and continued our voyage, running before the S.E.\r\ntrades which were blowing very freshly at the time. The weather now\r\nbecame much finer, and I could enjoy the cool fresh breeze, and observe\r\nthe nature of the coast, to which we often approached so closely as to be\r\nwithin little more than gunshot of it; with the exception of a few white\r\nsand hills, destitute nearly of vegetation, it appeared extremely flat.\r\nAbout noon of the third day we made the bar of Aracaty, but as it was\r\nthen low water, and too shallow to allow us to enter, we had to stand off\r\ntill four P.M., when a pilot came on board who steered us into the smooth\r\ndeep water in the mouth of the river inside the bar, where we came to\r\nanchor for the night, and were visited by a custom-house officer, who was\r\nmore particular in examining my luggage than that of any other passenger.\r\nWhen this was finished, and I had exhibited my passport, I was allowed to\r\nhire a boat to convey me to the town, situated twelve miles farther up\r\nthe river, as the vessel could not get up till the following day.\r\n\r\nThe river on which the town of Aracaty stands is called the Rio\r\nJaguaribe, and a little above the bar it is about a mile broad. For a\r\nconsiderable distance the western bank is comparatively high, but the\r\neastern side is flat all the way up to the town. The lower part of the\r\nwestern bank is rather thickly wooded with small trees, but on both sides\r\nthe shores are covered with mangroves. About a league and a half below\r\nthe town, great numbers of the Carnahuba palm (_Corypha cerifera_, Mart.)\r\nmakes its appearance. This palm, of which I afterwards passed through\r\nimmense forests, reaches to the height of from twenty to forty feet, and\r\nbesides being the most abundant, is one of the most beautiful of its\r\nsize. The stems of the younger plants are generally covered all over\r\nwith leaves, but as they get older the lower ones drop off, leaving only\r\na tuft at the top, which is so arranged as to form a perfect ball. The\r\nleaves are fan-shaped, and not at all unlike those of the fan palm of the\r\nsouth of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe town of Aracaty stands on the east side of the river, and consists\r\nprincipally of one long broad street. It contains four fine churches,\r\nand the houses are generally of two stories. The population amounts to\r\nabout 5000, the mass of whom are very poor. A considerable quantity of\r\ndried beef was formerly prepared here for exportation to other parts of\r\nBrazil, but this trade has fallen off very much, cotton and hides being\r\nnow the principal articles of export. Of the former about 5000 bags, or\r\n25,000 arrobas of thirty-two pounds each, are exported annually, and of\r\nthe latter about 2000. But little cotton is cultivated near the coast,\r\nthe greater part of it, as well as the hides, being brought from the\r\ninterior; the transport of these is effected at the end of the rainy\r\nseason in large waggons, which are generally drawn by twelve oxen. During\r\nthe time of the rains, the roads are impassable, and in the dry season,\r\nneither water nor grass can be procured for the cattle. The river runs\r\nclose to the town, and at the end of the rainy season, when I was there,\r\nwas somewhat less than a quarter of a mile broad; but during the height\r\nof the rains, it often rises twelve feet above its ordinary level, and\r\nthen overflows the town. With the exception of a hill situated two and\r\na half leagues to the S.W. of the town, and which rises six or eight\r\nhundred feet, and a few sand hills near the coast, the country all round\r\nis so flat, that the horizon is about as level as that of the sea. The\r\nhouses are built of a frame-work made of the stems of the Carnahuba\r\npalm filled up with brick. The stem of this useful tree is used by the\r\ninhabitants for almost every purpose to which wood can be applied; it is\r\nso durable that the lower part, particularly of the full grown stems,\r\nlasts for many years, even when exposed to the weather; hence all the\r\nenclosures for cattle are made of them, for which purpose they are\r\nlongitudinally split. The leaves are used for a variety of purposes,\r\nsuch as thatch, pack-saddles, hats, &c.; they also yield a kind of wax,\r\nobtained from the young leaves, which are covered with a glaucous bloom,\r\nby shaking them after they have been detached from the tree. Each yields\r\nabout fifty grains of a whitish powder, and when a considerable quantity\r\nof it has been obtained, it is put into a pot and melted over the fire.\r\nSome years ago, a large quantity of this was sent to Lisbon, but was not\r\nfound to answer any useful purpose; by the Brazilians it is sometimes\r\nused to adulterate common wax. In times of scarcity the young leaves are\r\nchopped up, and given to horses and cattle to eat, and the people prepare\r\nfor themselves a kind of farinha from the inside of the young stems.\r\nThe rains generally begin here in February, and end about the beginning\r\nof June. The whole province is sometimes liable to great droughts\r\n(_seccas_), the last of which occurred in the year 1825, during which\r\nno rain fell at all. The distress resulting from this calamity was very\r\ngreat, and the people still speak of it with the utmost horror; nearly\r\nall the horses and cattle were exterminated, and the loss of human life\r\nwas very great, it being estimated that 30,000 of the inhabitants of the\r\nprovince perished. Great numbers of these died while attempting to reach\r\nthe coast; wild as well as domestic animals fell victims to the want of\r\nwater and food: these droughts have been observed to occur periodically.\r\nAracaty was, during my visit, supplied with water of tolerable quality\r\nfrom a well near the town, but it was expected shortly to have an\r\nexcellent supply from a spring about a league distant; the individual who\r\nundertook to procure this was Senhor Maya, a native of Gibraltar, who has\r\nbeen settled for many years at Aracaty; having received a privilege from\r\ngovernment, he laid a brick channel for the water to run in, and as the\r\nspring is considerably lower than the town, he was erecting a force-pump\r\nfor the purpose of raising it; the water from the well near the town, was\r\nsold through the streets in small barrels carried on low carts, which\r\nwere often drawn by sheep. Senhor Maya expects to remunerate himself by\r\nthe sale of the produce of his labour, which will certainly, from its\r\nsuperior quality, obtain preference.\r\n\r\nAs at Maceio, there is only one British merchant resident at Aracaty,\r\nMr. Miller, to whom I had letters from Pernambuco, and in whose house I\r\nwas hospitably entertained during the fortnight I remained here. I had\r\nalso letters to several respectable Brazilians, from whom I likewise\r\nreceived many kind attentions, not the least of which were letters to\r\ntheir friends in the interior. Besides making the necessary preparations\r\nfor my journey, I made a few excursions in the neighbourhood, and thereby\r\nobtained specimens of most of the plants which were then in flower, among\r\nthese was a very pretty species of _Angelonia_ (_A. arguta_, Benth.).\r\nAs the Senhores Pinto were sending their goods to Icó in waggons, they\r\nobligingly allowed me to despatch, by this opportunity, all the heaviest\r\nportions of my luggage. I thus only required to purchase two horses at\r\nAracaty, and these, two of the best travelling ones that were to be had,\r\ncost only four guineas each. Having agreed to accompany the Pintos to\r\nIcó, we started on horseback from Aracaty, on the morning of the 3rd of\r\nAugust, in the midst of a heavy shower of rain, which, however, soon\r\nceased. After riding through a dense forest of Carnahuba palms on a\r\nperfectly level sandy road, we crossed the river at the distance of about\r\ntwo leagues and a half from the town. The ford is called the Passagem\r\ndas Pedras, from the rocky nature of the bed of the river. These rocks\r\nI found belonged to the gneiss series, with the strata nearly vertical,\r\nthe little inclination which they had, being towards the west in the\r\ndirection of the hill already alluded to, called the Serra d’Areré,\r\nabout half a mile distant. At nine o’clock we halted to breakfast in a\r\nlarge shed (_rancho_) by the road-side, and there we remained till the\r\nafternoon, for in travelling in the north of Brazil, where the heat is\r\nvery great, the animals are always allowed to rest during the middle\r\nof the day, which is not the case in the south, where the whole day’s\r\njourney is made at one stretch. The country during our morning’s ride\r\nstill continued flat, but in many places instead of being sandy, is\r\ncovered with gravel and boulders of various sizes, the largest of the\r\nlatter being about four feet in diameter, all more or less rounded,\r\nand consisting of granite, gneiss, and quartz. The great mass of the\r\nvegetation consisted of Carnahuba palms and a few small trees which\r\ngrew among them, the most common of which is a species of _Patagonula_,\r\ncalled by the Brazilians _Pao branco_, from the white nature of its\r\nwood, which is chiefly employed as fuel. As we passed along, we raised\r\nnumerous flocks of pigeons, some of which were not larger than sparrows,\r\nwhile others were the size of our domestic ones; and sporting among the\r\nleaves of the palms we observed several species of parrots and paroquets,\r\nbesides a variety of beautiful small birds, one species being very\r\nnumerous much resembling the common canary. The notes of these birds\r\nwere of course as varied as their kinds, that of the parrot tribe being\r\nparticularly disagreeable, not unlike that of the English rook, but the\r\nsound which most particularly caught my ear, was the monotonous and\r\ndistinct cry of the Bem-te-ve, a bird about the size, shape, and colour\r\nof the thrush. This name has been given to it from the resemblance of its\r\nnote to the Portuguese signifying “I see you well,” which it repeats in\r\nquick succession. Resuming our journey at three o’clock in the afternoon,\r\nand travelling through the same sort of country, we passed a small town\r\ntowards dusk, called Villa de San Bernardo, which is ten leagues from\r\nAracaty. It is built in the form of a square, the west side of which is\r\nprincipally occupied with a handsome church; and as it stands in the\r\nopen plain (_vargem_) which is studded with occasional wide-spreading\r\n_Zizyphus_ trees and Carnahuba palms, and as all the houses are\r\nwhite-washed, it offers an imposing appearance when seen at a distance.\r\nAbout half a league beyond this town, we stopped for the night at a small\r\nhouse by the road-side; all the houses in this part of the country, which\r\nare not actually in towns, have a large veranda (_copial_) in front, and\r\nit is under this that travellers generally ask leave to rest for the\r\nnight, there being hooks fixed from which hammocks can be suspended. As\r\nsoon as the loads were taken off the cargo horses, and the saddles from\r\nthose we had ridden, they were sent to graze in the neighbourhood, where\r\nthey were left with their fore-feet strapped pretty closely together, in\r\norder to prevent them from straying.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning by the light of a beautiful and clear moon we resumed\r\nour journey, but had not gone more than two leagues when I was prevented\r\nfrom accompanying my companions further by an awkward mistake made by my\r\nservant. In the hurry of departure, in the place of one of my horses, he\r\nhad caught another of the same size and colour, belonging to some one\r\nelse, and it was not till daylight had fairly set in that the mistake\r\nwas discovered. I had now to call a halt, and getting my trunks, &c. put\r\nunder the veranda of an old house, I despatched Pedro in search of my\r\nown animal. About two o’clock he returned bringing it with him, but as I\r\nfound myself somewhat indisposed I determined not to proceed further that\r\nnight. As there was no inhabited house near, we remained at the ruined\r\ndwelling, which my health did not allow us to leave for two days. As the\r\nroad on which we proceeded is the highway to the interior of the province\r\nof Ceará, as also to the middle parts of the province of Piauhy, many\r\ntravellers passed our encampment. Waggons loaded with cotton and hides\r\nwere going downwards, while others, as well as troops of horses, were\r\npassing upwards loaded with European goods and salt, the latter being\r\na scarce and dear article in the interior. When afterwards I travelled\r\nthrough some of the most desert and least inhabited parts of the inland\r\nprovinces, there were two articles which were always asked for on my\r\narrival at any habitation, first, gunpowder, and then salt; some of the\r\npoor beings scarcely taste the latter from one year’s end to the other,\r\ntheir animal food being preserved by simply drying it in the sun, after\r\nit has been cut into thin slices. I had always to carry a stock of salt\r\nwith me, and not unfrequently it has cost me as much as three shillings a\r\npound, at the same time that I could purchase an entire fat ox for about\r\nten shillings. To the European who is accustomed to travel without need\r\nof arms, and in comparative security, the appearance of the swarthy and\r\nbrigand-like travellers here met with, each armed with horse pistols,\r\nsword, dagger, knife, and gun, afford no favourable idea of the morals\r\nof these people. Murders and robberies are frequent among them, it being\r\nseldom that the one is committed without the other, when they always\r\noccur by treachery. From all I have seen and heard, I do not believe that\r\none instance can be recorded of a Brazilian boldly facing another and\r\nasking him for his purse; one reason for this may be that each is aware\r\nthat the other is armed with a knife, and hence he avoids coming within\r\nreach of it. Most of the very many murders which are committed in Brazil,\r\nare the result either of jealousy or of political hatred.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the afternoon of the 6th that I found myself sufficiently\r\nrecovered to leave our solitary encampment, when we resumed our journey\r\nat a slow pace till after eleven at night. The moon had risen about\r\nsix, and shone with a brilliancy such as I have seldom witnessed; this\r\ntogether with the coolness of the evening, renders travelling after\r\nsunset very agreeable, although to the naturalist it is not the most\r\nprofitable. During the whole of my extensive journies I made it a rule\r\nnever to travel at night, unless through a decidedly desert country, in\r\norder that nothing of interest should be overlooked. The seven leagues\r\nwhich we accomplished this evening was through a country of much the\r\nsame barren nature as that we had already gone over, with the exception\r\nof one low range of hills covered with small trees and shrubs; on the\r\nlevel portion scarcely anything was to be seen but Carnahuba palms, Pao\r\nBranco, a _Zizyphus_, and a species of _Aspidospermum_, a small tree that\r\ngrows gregariously and to which the inhabitants give the name of Pereira;\r\nthe bark of it is very bitter, and its infusion is used to destroy\r\nlice, and other vermin infecting cattle. We passed through several\r\nlarge open gravelly spaces (_vargems_), nearly destitute of trees, and\r\nthe herbaceous vegetation that had sprung up during the rains was now\r\nnearly parched up. The stillness of the night was only broken by the\r\ncries of a small species of goatsucker (_Caprimulgus_), that was flying\r\nabout in great numbers. We rested for the night under the veranda of a\r\nhouse close to the road-side, in approaching which we passed through a\r\nflock of several hundred sheep, being the greatest number I have seen\r\ncollected together in any part of the country, but the excessive heat of\r\nthe climate had wrought a remarkable change in their appearance, their\r\nskin being wholly destitute of wool and replaced by a short hair, not\r\nunlike that of a cow. In the same manner goats lose the long hair natural\r\nto them in cold countries, which proves how much the economy of animals\r\ncan suit itself to change of circumstances. On the following morning we\r\ntraversed a country still abounding with the elegant Carnahuba palm, and\r\nnumerous small fresh-water lakes, teeming with wild ducks and other kinds\r\nof water-fowl, and arrived at a place where there are several houses near\r\nto the Rio Jaguaribe, in the neighbourhood of which some small trees of\r\n_Cochlospermum serratifolium_, DC., were beautifully in flower, their\r\nlarge golden blossoms gleaming in the sun like oranges; here I found that\r\nin consequence of the pack-saddles being too narrow, the back of the\r\ncargo horse was so much galled, that it could no longer carry its load,\r\nin consequence I was obliged to hire another from a person whom I met\r\ngoing up to Icó with loads of salt, and who had some spare animals with\r\nhim. The weather being fine, I preferred taking up my quarters under the\r\nshade of a broad-spreading wild fig tree standing some distance from any\r\nhabitation, although I was invited by the owner of one of the houses to\r\naccept the accommodation it afforded.\r\n\r\nAs the person whose horse I had hired could not leave till the following\r\nday, I was obliged, against my will, to await his convenience. Soon\r\nafter my arrival I sent Pedro to purchase some milk for breakfast, and\r\nhe returned with a large basinful, for which he said the people would\r\nnot take money; and in the course of the forenoon I had similar presents\r\nsent to me from two other persons. During the season of the rains, and\r\nfor a few months afterwards, milk is very abundant, and of excellent\r\nquality, but it is nowhere to be procured except in large towns, during\r\nthe last four or five months of the dry season. The inhabitants prepare\r\na little cheese, but have no idea of making butter; the milk remaining\r\nafter breakfast, for they milk their cows only in the morning, is allowed\r\nto stand till night, when from the heat of the day it becomes curdled;\r\nthis dish, of which they are very fond, is generally sweetened with a\r\nkind of unclarified sugar, to which they give the name of _Rapadura_,\r\nand which is brought from the country above Icó; it is formed into cakes\r\nabout six inches long, three broad, and two thick; during a long time\r\nI was obliged to use this as a substitute for sugar, but although at\r\nfirst not very agreeable, I at length became so fond of it as to prefer\r\nit to sugar itself, and such I found to be the case with the people in\r\nthis part of the country; I have repeatedly seen them make a meal of a\r\nlump of this with a little farinha. The greater part of the inhabitants\r\nof the district through which we were journeying, are rearers of cattle\r\n(_criadores de gado_), but none of them possess such immense herds\r\nas I afterwards found to exist in the provinces of Piauhy and Goyaz.\r\nProvisions were here very cheap, in consequence of the small demand for\r\nthem; an ox could be purchased for about twenty-five shillings, and a\r\nsheep or a goat for four or five; Pedro bought a fowl in fine condition\r\nfor about twopence halfpenny, and eight eggs for a penny. I observed\r\nvery few cotton plantations, as these people grow it only for their own\r\nuse; they also cultivate a little mandiocca, the root of which produces\r\na kind of cassava, well-known all over Brazil under the name of farinha;\r\nthis, together with dried beef (carne secca), forms their chief food;\r\nthe farinha is either used in its dry state, when it is much of the\r\nconsistence of saw dust, or is made up into a kind of pudding called\r\nPirão, by mixing it with boiling water, or with milk when that article is\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\nOn the first day’s journey with our new companion we travelled about\r\nseven leagues, five of which were accomplished in the morning, and two\r\nin the evening. The Villa de Icó is in a southerly direction, bearing a\r\nlittle to the west of Aracaty, the distance between them being about two\r\nhundred and forty miles. The Senhors Pinto accomplished the journey in\r\nfive days and a half, but it took me three days longer; which delay I\r\ndid not regret, as I travelled more at my ease, and was enabled to make\r\ncollections by the way, that I could not have done had I accompanied\r\nthem. On this day’s journey I observed that the country was gradually\r\nrising; where visible, the soil consisted of a reddish coloured clay,\r\nbut many large tracts were covered with gravel which gave them the\r\nappearance of having been at one time the bed of an immense river. In\r\nother places beds of gneiss, forming elevated ridges were seen cropping\r\nout, the strata being nearly vertical. About half an hour after we began\r\nour journey, we passed a large lake on the left side of the road, called\r\nLagoa grande; it is about a league long, and nearly as much broad, and\r\nabounds in fish and wild duck. Carnahuba palms were now becoming less\r\nfrequent, but they were succeeded by a vegetation of a very opposite\r\ncharacter; in situations somewhat sandy, a dwarf kind of _Cassia_ often\r\noccurs, as well as two or three species of _Croton_, but these, in common\r\nwith the herbaceous vegetation, were already much scorched up; in the\r\ngravelly places the principal production is a beautiful erect species\r\nof _Evolvulus_ about a foot high, with small leaves and numerous blue\r\nflowers, giving it much the appearance of the common flax. On the more\r\nelevated tracts, woods are seen consisting of low trees and shrubs,\r\nprincipally a subarboreous species of _Mimosa_, and a _Combretum_; these\r\nwoods are nearly all deciduous, the heat and drought producing the same\r\neffect on their foliage, as the cold in northern regions, these are\r\ncalled by the inhabitants _Catingas_; no large trees are to be seen, but\r\nin the more open parts of the country, a low wide-spreading species of\r\nthe _Chrysobalanaceous_ tribe is not uncommon, affording shade not only\r\nto travellers, but to the cattle which pasture in those districts; it was\r\nunder one of these trees that we halted during the heat of the day, and\r\ndined on part of a large green lizard that I shot the evening before.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of our journey was through a country very similar to that\r\njust described; but a low evergreen _Zizyphus_ tree, and a few large\r\nspecies of _Cactus_ now gave a different character to the landscape.\r\nOn the afternoon of the 12th the appearance of the country was still\r\nfurther diversified by our approach to a mountain range about sixteen\r\nleagues in length, running in a direction from S.W. to N.E.; this is\r\ncalled the Serra de Pereira, a name derived from the number of trees\r\nof that name said to grow on it. The appearance of this high land was\r\na great relief to the eye, after having been so long accustomed to a\r\nnearly level country. On the same evening I saw for the first time a\r\ntroop of oxen with loads on their backs; there were about a dozen of\r\nthem, all large and well fed animals, going down to Aracaty with dried\r\nhides; such a sight was afterwards not uncommon. The further we proceeded\r\ninland, the greater appeared to be the effect of the drought; and in\r\nconsequence of this I added but little to my botanical collections; but\r\namong the few plants that were in flower I observed a very fine species\r\nof _Angelonia_ (_A. biflora_, Benth.) bearing long spikes of large bluish\r\ncoloured flowers, and which is now common in English gardens, raised\r\nfrom seeds which I sent home. So little are the birds here annoyed by\r\nman, that flocks of pigeons of various sorts, parrots, paroquets, &c.,\r\nremained without stirring on the branches of the small trees under which\r\nwe passed; and cranes of different species as well as many other water\r\nbirds, did not move from the margins of the small lakes till the horses\r\nnearly approached them; the same was nearly the case with two kinds of\r\nravens, called by the inhabitants Gavião and Gavião vermelho; these\r\nlatter exist in great numbers living upon what carrion they may pick up.\r\nWhile we were resting during the heat of the day, I frequently took my\r\ngun to shoot parrots and pigeons, which we stewed for dinner, and were\r\nmore relished than our usual fare of dried beef, although the flesh of\r\nparrots is both brown, dry, and tough. Some of the pigeons, as before\r\nobserved, are not larger than sparrows, and one of these which frequently\r\nalights on the roofs of houses, may be heard, particularly during the\r\nmorning, calling out most distinctly “Fogo pegou, Fogo pegou” for hours\r\ntogether; in Portuguese this means “the gun missed fire,” an apparently\r\nteazing exclamation of the bird, not unaptly applied to the guns of the\r\ncountry people which seldom take effect. This I suspect is the same bird\r\nthat Waterton speaks of under the name of “Will-come-go.” Shortly before\r\nwe reached the Villa de Icó, we met a party of ladies and gentlemen, on\r\nhorseback, and I was not a little surprised to see the manner in which\r\nthe former were mounted, _en cavalier_, which, in nine cases out of ten,\r\nis the way in which females travel in the interior.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at Icó my friends the Pintos had kindly procured an\r\nuninhabited house for my reception; in consequence of the breaking\r\ndown of the waggon which was bringing up my trunks, &c., and other\r\nunforeseen causes, I was detained at this place three weeks, which I\r\nthe more regretted, as my time could be turned to no useful account,\r\nin consequence of the drought that prevailed in the neighbourhood. The\r\ntown of Icó, one of the most important in the interior of the province\r\nof Ceará, is situated in a plain on the east of the Rio Jaguaribe, which\r\nhere, however, takes the name of Rio Salgado; it is said to contain about\r\n6000 inhabitants; the plain is one of considerable size, being bounded on\r\nthe east by the Serra de Pereira, and on the west by a much lower range\r\nof hills. The town consists of three principal streets, running nearly\r\nnorth and south, intersected by a number of smaller ones. The houses\r\nare all built of brick, no timber of sufficient size being found in the\r\nneighbourhood; with the exception of about half a dozen, they are all\r\nof one story, and white-washed with a kind of chalk found abundantly in\r\nthe hilly country thirty leagues to the westward. The principal street\r\nis broad, and contains some well-furnished shops; it presents four\r\nhandsome churches, a substantial jail, and a market-place, in which\r\nfresh beef, dried beef, farinha, salt, rapadura, gourds, pine-apples,\r\nmelons, water-melons, oranges, and limes, are every day exhibited\r\nfor sale; the whole of these fruits are brought from a distance, the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of the town producing nothing whatever, the whole\r\ncountry being dry and arid, except during the wet season, which only\r\nlasts about four months. At a short distance are seen a number of those\r\nlow deciduous woods called _Catingas_, but even these were destitute\r\nof leaves, and there was nothing within sight deserving the name of a\r\ntree; the river also, which during the rains is of considerable size,\r\njudging from the appearance of its bed, was now dry in many places, deep\r\npools only being left here and there, abounding with several sorts of\r\nfish, which, however, are soon exhausted. Notwithstanding the number\r\nof inhabitants which this place contains, it cannot boast of a single\r\nmedical practitioner, but there are two apothecaries, whose shops\r\nare well stocked with medicines. The greater part of the inhabitants\r\nare shopkeepers, who supply the interior with articles of European\r\nmanufacture, receiving produce in return, which they send down to the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nA few days after I arrived here I was visited by most of the respectable\r\ninhabitants of the place, and as their calls were shortly returned, I\r\nsoon gained an extensive acquaintance. One of my most frequent visitors\r\nwas an old priest, who was very inquisitive regarding all that related to\r\nEngland; one of his first questions was whether I was baptized or not,\r\nand in what faith? and when I told him I was a Protestant, he replied,\r\n“Ah! then you are a Pagan.” Such was his ignorance! and this I found to\r\nprevail with nearly all the inferior priests I met in the interior of the\r\nnorthern provinces, and I had great difficulty in convincing him that\r\nthe fundamental principles of our respective religions were alike; after\r\nthis, whenever I was interrogated as to my religious faith, I answered\r\nby simply saying I was a Christian, which entitled me to respect. When\r\nit became known that I was a medical man I had numerous applications\r\nfor advice. The most common complaints here, as elsewhere in Brazil,\r\nare chronic disorders of the digestive organs, which often terminate in\r\ndropsy and paralysis; dysentery, pleurisy, and ophthalmia are likewise\r\nnot unfrequent, particularly during the dry season, produced, no doubt,\r\nby the great difference of temperature between night and day, which more\r\nreadily takes effect on these people owing to the very thin dresses which\r\nthey wear; in no case did I see flannel worn next the skin, which is the\r\nbest preventive against sudden change of temperature. One of my patients\r\nwas the wife of one of my Portuguese friends, who was attended by her\r\nmother, and although her complaint was a dangerous malady of which she\r\nafterwards died, the greatest source of regret her parent expressed was\r\nthe state of leanness to which her daughter was reduced, plumpness being\r\nconsidered the chief point of beauty in the Brazilian fair. One of the\r\ngreatest compliments that can be paid a lady, is to tell her that she is\r\nbecoming daily fatter and more beautiful (_mais gorda e mais bonita_),\r\nindeed the greater portion of them soon acquire a tendency to become so,\r\nfrom the sedentary life they all lead.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining about a fortnight I made preparations to leave Icó, as\r\nI wished as soon as possible to get up to Crato, another town about\r\none hundred and twenty miles to the S.W., situated at the foot of the\r\nmountains which divide the provinces of Ceará and Piauhy, where I was\r\nassured I should meet with abundance to reward my researches, as the\r\ngeneral temperature was much cooler, and the country well watered with\r\nsmall streams from the mountains. I purchased two additional horses,\r\nengaged an experienced guide, and procured whatever was necessary\r\nfor the journey, when the following incident occurred to prevent my\r\ndeparture. The day before that fixed for our journey, one of my new\r\nhorses disappeared from the pasture in which it was feeding, if, indeed,\r\na little dried up grass could be so called; as horse-stealing is a\r\nvery frequent crime in Brazil, I strongly suspected that some one had\r\nmade free with my animal, but I was assured it had only strayed into a\r\nneighbouring _Catinga_ and would soon be found. I immediately despatched\r\nPedro and another man well acquainted with the country, in quest of it,\r\nbut after two days’ search they could bring me no satisfactory tidings.\r\nHaving lost all hopes of regaining it, I was about to purchase another,\r\nwhen a man, who had been searching for two of his own stray animals,\r\ntold Pedro he had seen one answering the description of mine on the\r\nSerra de Pereira, about three leagues distant; upon this Pedro and his\r\ncompanion were again despatched in that direction, when they returned in\r\nthe evening bringing it with them; they found it on an elevated table\r\nland feeding along with an immense number of the American Ostrich (_Rhea\r\nAmericana_). This was the first of a series of annoyances I met with\r\nduring my future travels, from my horses either straying or having been\r\nstolen; an animal is frequently taken away by some one who wishes to\r\nmake a short journey, so that after a day or two it will be found in the\r\nplace whence it was taken; at other times they are removed and hidden\r\nfor a few days, for the purpose of claiming a reward; and though I was\r\nfrequently well assured of this imposition, I never refused to pay the\r\nmoney, knowing I should otherwise be worse off. All being now again ready\r\nfor leaving Icó, I took leave of all my friends, who gave me their hearty\r\nwishes for a prosperous journey. The evening before my departure many\r\nlittle presents were sent for my use during the journey, such as little\r\njars of sweet-meats, biscuits of various sorts, prepared from ground\r\nrice and Indian corn, roasted fowls, &c.; a custom I found to be almost\r\nuniversal in the north of Brazil.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the second day after leaving Icó, we arrived at the\r\nVilla de Lavra de Mangabeira, which is about ten leagues distant. A\r\nlittle beyond Icó the road becomes very rough, frequently ascending and\r\nagain descending over rocky paths, on which account it is no longer\r\nserviceable for the transit of waggons, all further traffic into the\r\ninterior being now effected either on horseback or, strange as it may\r\nappear, upon oxen. The diversity of hill and dale renders this part of\r\nthe journey less monotonous, and although the herbaceous vegetation was\r\nmuch destroyed by the heat, the greater part of the trees, which are both\r\nlarge and more numerous, still retained their leaves; the most abundant\r\ntree that I observed was called by the inhabitants Aroeira; it is a\r\nspecies of _Schinus_, perhaps _S. Aroeira_, St. Hil., and reaches to the\r\nheight of thirty or forty feet; as the stem grows very straight, it is\r\nmuch used in house-building; at this time it was destitute of leaves, but\r\nfrom the ends of its branches were suspended clusters of small fruit of\r\na dark colour, giving it very much the appearance of the European alder\r\nwhen covered with its dark-brown catlins. The other trees consist chiefly\r\nof large _Acacias_ and _Mimosas_, _Bignonias_ of considerable size\r\ncovered with yellow and rose coloured flowers, a _Triplaris_, and, the\r\nmost beautiful of all, a large _Jacaranda_, the wide-spreading branches\r\nof which were densely covered with great panicles of beautiful large blue\r\nflowers, not unlike those of the no less splendid _Gloxinia speciosa_;\r\namong these sometimes appear a few solitary Carnahuba palms, but in\r\nhollow sheltered places they often occur in groups; large _Cacti_ are not\r\nuncommon, and we passed over some elevated open shrubby tracts abounding\r\nin a species of _Krameria_.\r\n\r\nThe Villa de Lavra de Mangabeira is situated on the banks of the Rio\r\nSalgado, and contains about eighty or a hundred houses, all small, and\r\nmany of them falling to decay. Gold is found in the neighbourhood, in a\r\ndark coloured alluvial soil a little below the surface; from time to time\r\nwashings have been established, which have never yielded satisfactory\r\nresults; the most extensive of these was undertaken about two years\r\nbefore my arrival. The president of the province and some others having\r\nformed themselves into a company, sent for two English miners to conduct\r\nthe operations; they continued their labours to within two months\r\npreviously, when the work was abandoned. About a year afterwards I met\r\nwith one of these miners in a far distant part of the country, and from\r\nhim I learned that the gold exists in too small quantities to repay the\r\ncost of its extraction; scarcity of water at times was also another\r\ndrawback. Here I found, growing in vast quantities on the sandy margins\r\nof the river, a species of _Grangea_, which is a powerful bitter, used\r\nby the natives as an infusion in dyspeptic cases in the same manner as\r\ncamomile, which, indeed, it much resembles, and to which they give the\r\nsame name (_macella_).\r\n\r\nWe left Lavra on the afternoon of the same day on which we arrived, and\r\nhalted for the night at a small house near the river. On the following\r\nmorning as we were advancing quietly, one of the horses struck its load\r\nagainst a tree, by which means it was thrown off; thus disencumbered it\r\nran away at full speed among the trees, and was soon followed by the\r\nremainder, who in like manner quickly rid themselves of their cargoes;\r\nan hour was thus lost in recapturing and replacing the loads, and even\r\nwhile this was doing, one of the animals laid down and began to roll,\r\nfirst breaking the cords by which his burden was held on, and thus a\r\nsecond time freeing himself. I mention this, as an instance of one of\r\nthe many annoyances to which a traveller in such countries is liable; in\r\nthese respects horses are more unmanageable than mules. In the northern\r\nprovinces of Brazil, however, the latter animals are very seldom seen,\r\nnotwithstanding they have been frequently tried, large troops of them\r\nhaving been brought from the south. All being finally arranged, we\r\ncontinued our journey, and about mid-day arrived at a house on the bank\r\nof the river, near the road-side, where I asked permission as usual to\r\npass the middle of the day, but we were told we should meet with better\r\naccommodation half a league further on; this was the first time I met\r\nwith a refusal, and I can only recollect one similar instance during all\r\nmy travels. After proceeding about a league without the appearance of\r\nany house, we halted under some large trees close to the river, where I\r\ndetermined to remain for the night, as the horses had undergone a long\r\nmorning’s journey. In the evening I took a walk in the neighbourhood,\r\nbut met with nothing new except a species of _Mikania_ clinging among\r\nthe branches of a _Mimosa_; and a few shells in the bed of the river.\r\nBetween this place and Lavra, the course of the river is very tortuous,\r\nand being now very nearly dried up, I observed that the inhabitants\r\nhad planted melons, water-melons, gourds, &c. in it; bananas were now\r\nbeginning to be cultivated, and almost every house had its own little\r\ncotton and tobacco plantation. Every where _Argemone Mexicana_, the\r\nCardo Santo of the Brazilians, grows in great plenty, the large yellow\r\npoppy-like flowers being very beautiful; a handful of the leaves of\r\nthis plant, together with about a quarter of an ounce of the ripe seeds\r\ninfused, is used as a draught in jaundice. It was a beautiful evening\r\nwhen I retired to my hammock, which was suspended between two trees,\r\nbut I had not been long asleep when I was awoke by a strange rattling\r\nnoise among the leaves, that I soon found to be caused by a heavy shower\r\napproaching from the south, which shortly fell upon our encampment in\r\ntorrents; we were unprepared for such an occurrence, it being then the\r\nheight of the dry season, and were quickly drenched; my hammock soon\r\nbecame too uncomfortable to lie in, so I got up, wrapt myself in my\r\nponcho, and sat down on one of the pack-saddles by the extinguished fire;\r\nunfortunately I had no umbrella to afford any shelter, having lost it two\r\ndays before, at a place where I had dismounted to collect some beetles.\r\nThe rain continued for about two hours, and not being able to go to bed\r\nagain, every thing being soaked, I was obliged to remain seated in this\r\nposition till daybreak, when, after arranging all our humid articles in\r\nthe best manner, we proceeded on our journey. The morning though cloudy\r\nwas dry, and there was a feeling of freshness in the atmosphere such\r\nas I had not felt since we left the coast; we travelled for nearly a\r\nleague before we came to a house, so that instead of being only half a\r\nleague distant from where we were refused accommodation on the previous\r\nday, I found it was nearly two; we went on two leagues further, without\r\nmeeting another habitation, so we halted during the middle of the day\r\nbeneath some large Jatobá (_Hymenæa_) trees. This part of the country\r\nis very thinly populated; the greater part of the soil being of a\r\ngravelly nature, is neither adapted for cultivation, even were water\r\nabundant, nor for feeding cattle. It is besides very hilly, some of the\r\nranges being the highest we had yet passed over; from the top of one of\r\nthe elevations I obtained a fine view of the undulating thinly-wooded\r\ncountry below; scattered here and there were to be seen large pink\r\nor yellow _Bignonias_, or the azure-blossomed _Jacaranda_, raising\r\ntheir magnificent diadems above the other denizens of the wood; and an\r\noccasional plant of _Cochlospermum serratifolium_, loaded with its large\r\nand beautiful yellow flowers, attracts the attention of the traveller.\r\nThe rocks which I observed during this ride were of a grey coloured\r\nclay-slate.\r\n\r\nWe had not travelled more than half a league in the afternoon, when\r\nwe were again overtaken by rain, and although the shower lasted but\r\nhalf an hour, it was so heavy, that in a short time water was rushing\r\nover the roads, running like streams, and where they were of a clayey\r\nnature, especially on the declivity of the hills, they became very\r\nslippery. Having carried my poncho beneath my saddle, I put it on, when\r\nmy appearance caused no little astonishment to some countrymen who\r\npassed us, that article of dress being quite unknown among them. It is,\r\nhowever, far superior to their leathern jackets, which are not only\r\nuncomfortably warm, by confining the natural exhalations from the body,\r\nbut soon become soaked in case of rain, and are long drying, whilst with\r\nthe poncho and my long boots I was nearly dry when the rain ceased.\r\nThe rocks seen in the latter part of this day’s journey were a rather\r\ncoarse-grained white sandstone, similar to those I met with on the coast\r\nbetween the Rio de San Francisco and Pernambuco. In many places this\r\nrock was exposed to a considerable extent, its only vegetation being\r\na few species of _Cactus_ and _Bromelia_. In the wooded portions, the\r\natmosphere was loaded with the rich perfume of the flowers of the Cashew\r\ntree (_Anacardium occidentale_), which grew in great profusion. This\r\nwas the first time I met with this tree at any distance from the coast,\r\nbut I afterwards found it was not uncommon in the interior. The fruit,\r\nhowever, or rather the thickened peduncle which forms the esculent part,\r\nis small, not being much larger than a cherry. Towards dusk we halted at\r\na place where there were two houses, but we could not be accommodated in\r\nconsequence of two large troops having taken up their quarters before our\r\narrival. As the next habitation was nearly two leagues further, and as\r\nthe roads were said to be bad, I decided on remaining here and encamping\r\nunder a wide-spreading _Cæsalpinia_ which grew close by the road-side.\r\nShortly after I had arranged everything for the night, a permission\r\ncame from one of the houses to sling my hammock there, but I declined\r\nthis invitation, not considering it prudent to separate myself from my\r\nluggage; this step was rendered the more necessary in consequence of a\r\nquarrel between Pedro and the guide; the latter was recommended to me\r\nas a very useful person for the journey, but he turned out to be a lazy\r\ntalkative fellow, quite the reverse of Pedro, who was both active and\r\nintelligent. The quarrel originated from the guide’s refusing to attend\r\nto some duty while the horses were unloading, and, notwithstanding my\r\ninterference, it ran so high that they threatened to stab each other,\r\nthe usual way of settling disputes in this lawless country; on taking\r\nthe horses to pasture they were still talking furiously, and I felt not\r\na little uneasy till they returned. The evening was dark and had all the\r\nappearance of rain, but when the moon rose, it cleared up, and became a\r\nbeautiful night. My hammock and poncho were both too wet to sleep in, so\r\nI had to lie down on the top of two trunks for my bed, with my saddle for\r\na pillow, near a large fire we had previously kindled.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, the eighth of September, we continued our\r\njourney, and at eleven o’clock halted under some trees by the river\r\nside. Our route was through a richer country than any I had yet seen in\r\nthe province, it being well wooded with large trees, the greater part\r\nof which were in leaf; near the houses, which appeared more numerous\r\nthan hitherto, grew large plantations of cotton, tobacco, sugar-cane,\r\nand mandiocca. On the branches of a large tree by the road-side I\r\ncollected the first Orchideous plant I had seen during the journey; a\r\nlong round-leaved kind of _Oncidium_. The tree on which it grew was the\r\nUmari (_Geoffroya superba_), but only on the under side of the branches,\r\nthe long leaves hanging down like so many whips, intermingled with its\r\nlarge panicles of yellow flowers. It is called by the natives of the\r\nSertão “Rabo de Tatú,” from the resemblance of the leaves to the tail\r\nof the armadillo. Shortly after we halted, I went out with my gun in\r\nsearch of something for my dinner, but could find only parroquets, which\r\nwere very numerous, flying from tree to tree, and keeping up an almost\r\ncontinual cry of Parroquet—Parroquet. I fired at some which were seated\r\non a tall tree, and one of those which fell being only wounded, kept up\r\na continued scream whenever I attempted to approach it; this being heard\r\nby its companions, several hundreds of them again returned to the tree,\r\nand having once more fired among them, they were again brought back by\r\nthe screams of the dying, nor did they cease to re-appear in the same\r\nmanner till I had killed more than was sufficient for us all to eat. On\r\nthe afternoon of this day we travelled about two leagues, and rested at\r\na small sugar plantation (Engenho de Rapadura). It being the day of San\r\nGonzalvo, the people were dancing and making merry before the house; I\r\nobtained leave from the owner to let me pass the night in the mill, two\r\nsides of which were open. On alighting from my horse I laid down my straw\r\nhat, containing a silk pocket-handkerchief, on an old log of wood, close\r\nto the owner of the mill, but in less than half an hour afterwards, when\r\nall my things had been moved inside the boiling-house, the handkerchief\r\nhad disappeared: no one except my own men and the proprietor had been\r\nnear us, so that I had every reason to believe the latter had pilfered\r\nit, but I did not think proper to take notice of it. This was not the\r\nonly theft committed here before the morning, for when the horses were\r\nbeing loaded, Pedro discovered that a sack containing my large botanical\r\ntin box, and a sheep-skin bag, containing all belonging to him, were not\r\nto be found; it had been taken away from my luggage close to my hammock,\r\nwhile we were asleep. The poor fellow, as might be expected, was greatly\r\nannoyed at his loss, and it was fortunate, that previously to leaving\r\nIcó I had removed a number of my most useful articles from the box to\r\none of my trunks; I had just discovered my loss, when the owner came\r\ndown to consult me concerning a complaint under which he laboured, but\r\nI was too much exasperated to accede to his wishes; he expressed much\r\nregret for our loss, and said it was the first time any traveller had\r\nbeen pilfered who had put up at his house. We had not proceeded on our\r\njourney more than a quarter of a league, when Pedro told me he would\r\nreturn to the mill and endeavour to recover his clothes, from which I\r\ncould not dissuade him; the guide and I, therefore, went on alone, and at\r\na distance of three leagues, halted under the shade of a large tree near\r\nsome small houses. Pedro returned at two in the afternoon bringing his\r\nbag with him, and my botanical box, but not the handkerchief; upon his\r\narrival, he took me aside, and told me that just before returning in the\r\nmorning, a thought struck him that our guide might have been the thief,\r\nand if so, that the things would be hidden somewhere near the sugar-mill;\r\nit was this conviction that induced him to return, and the result proved\r\nthat he was right, for, after an hour’s search, in which he was assisted\r\nby the people of the place, he discovered my box hidden among some\r\nbushes, and his bag buried under the earth at a little distance. I have\r\nno doubt that the guide was the thief of all the articles, and had hidden\r\nthem until his return to Icó. He looked rather confused when Pedro\r\nreturned, and my first thought was to give him an immediate dismissal\r\nwithout payment, but upon reflection I resolved to take no notice of\r\nthe matter, knowing the revengeful nature of these people; I was sorry,\r\nhowever, for the incautious manner in which I had treated the proprietor\r\nof the mill. The large tree under which we had rested was the first I had\r\nseen of a kind that is very common about Crato; it is called Visgeira\r\nby the inhabitants, and is the _Parkia platycephala_ of Bentham; it has\r\na very thick stem, and wide-spreading branches, which in some instances\r\nnearly reach the ground; the wood is soft and brittle, and consequently\r\nnot of much value.\r\n\r\nOn the same evening, after a journey of two leagues and a half we reached\r\nVilla de Crato; the road all the way was level and sandy, the country\r\non the south side was well wooded with large trees, while the north,\r\nwhich is much flatter, was principally planted with sugar-cane, and\r\nseveral houses were seen at very short intervals, each with a mill and a\r\nboiling-house attached to it, for the purpose of converting the juice of\r\nthe cane into Rapadura. The Carnahuba is here replaced by another kind\r\nof palm called Macahuba (_Acrocomia sclerocarpa_, Mart.), which rises\r\nto about the same height, but has pinnated leaves, and a stem which,\r\ninstead of being the same thickness throughout, swells out considerably\r\nabove the middle, and is exactly the same species as one very common\r\nabout Pernambuco; along with this grows another species much resembling\r\nthe cocoa-nut in its height and foliage, but with a much thicker stem;\r\nthe nuts which are about the size of apples, are produced in large\r\nclusters; it is a species of _Attalea_, and is here called Palmeira.\r\nIt is impossible to express the delight I experienced on entering this\r\ncomparatively rich and smiling district, after a ride of more than three\r\nhundred miles through a country which at that season was little better\r\nthan a desert; the evening was one of the most beautiful I ever remember\r\nto have seen, the sun was setting in great splendour behind the Serra\r\nde Araripe, a long range of hills about a league to the westward of the\r\nVilla, but the freshness of this region seemed to deprive its rays of\r\nthat burning heat which shortly before sunset is so oppressive to the\r\ntraveller in the lower country. The beauty of the night, the cool and\r\nreviving feeling of the atmosphere, and the richness of the landscape, so\r\ndifferent from what I had lately seen, all tended to produce a buoyancy\r\nof spirit such as only the lover of nature can experience, and which\r\nI vainly wished might prove enduring, as I felt not only at ease with\r\nmyself, but “at peace with all below.”\r\n\r\nIt was dark before we entered the Villa, but I soon found the house of a\r\nrespectable shopkeeper, Senhor Francisco Dios Azede e Mello, to whom I\r\nbrought letters of recommendation. I was requested to enter the sitting\r\nroom, where I found myself in the midst of more than a dozen ladies,\r\nall squatting on the floor on mats, and among them was the lady of the\r\nhouse, who, as usual, put many questions to me respecting myself and\r\nmy country; I discovered that these visitors had come to condole the\r\nlady on the loss of her husband’s father, who had died on the previous\r\nday. Although within the more respectable houses in the Sertão, as the\r\ninterior is called, chairs are to be seen in their principal room, they\r\nare seldom made use of, as the hammock (rede) is the favourite seat of\r\nthe women, who are seldom out of it except at meal-time; in it, as upon\r\nthe mat, they sit upright with their legs folded beneath them, and their\r\nprincipal occupation during the day is smoking, eating sweet-meats, and\r\ndrinking cold water; it is generally slung so as to reach within about\r\na foot and a half of the ground, when it answers all the purposes of a\r\nsofa, and often more than one person may be observed seated on the same\r\nhammock; at night it is commonly preferred to a bed, for which purpose,\r\non account of its being much cooler, it is very generally used, and for\r\nwhich I can vouch from my own experience, as for three years I seldom\r\nslept out of one. They are generally made of a sort of strong cotton\r\ncloth manufactured by the inhabitants, and are either white, or white and\r\nblue, this colour being given by a dye which they prepare from a kind\r\nof wild indigo plant that grows abundantly in the neighbourhood; they\r\nare always made broader than long, which allows a person to lie in them\r\ndiagonally, and hence more horizontally than if they were narrower; they\r\nhave the advantage, however, of requiring no bedding, further than a thin\r\nblanket for a covering in the cool season, or a sheet in hot weather.\r\nBefore I left Icó, one of the Pintos wrote to Senhor Mello asking him to\r\nprocure a house for me on my arrival in Crato, but the only one he could\r\nobtain was a little dwelling attached to a shop, neither being in very\r\ngood condition: however, it answered my purpose very well for the time,\r\nbut I was obliged to look out for another residence in about six weeks,\r\nwhen it was required to be pulled down, in order that a new one might be\r\nerected in its stead; with some trouble I found two rooms which I hired\r\nat the rate of about five shillings a month, and where I remained till I\r\nleft the place. My only furniture consisted of two chairs which Senhor\r\nMello had the kindness to send me, an old packing-box that served as a\r\ntable, and of course my hammock was my bed. The day after my arrival\r\nat Crato a report was spread through the town that I was a travelling\r\nmerchant who had arrived there with goods for sale, and in the course\r\nof the day I had numerous visits from ladies who wished to look over my\r\nmerchandize, and who were not a little astonished when I told them I had\r\nnone; this was not the only time I was mistaken for a merchant, indeed\r\nafter leaving Crato the same mistake occurred at almost every house and\r\nvillage I arrived at, which is not surprising, as the number of people\r\nwho travel in the interior from house to house, and from town to town,\r\neither selling European goods, or exchanging them for horses or cattle,\r\nis very great.\r\n\r\nThe Villa de Crato is situated thirty-two leagues to the S.W. of\r\nIcó, and nearly in the same parallel as Pernambuco, from which it is\r\ndistant in a direct line about three hundred miles; it is a small and\r\nsufficiently miserable town, being one third the size of Icó. It is\r\nvery irregularly built, and the houses, with only one exception, are\r\nof a single story; it contains two churches and a jail, but one of the\r\nformer has never been finished, and has remained so long in this state,\r\nthat it has all the appearance of one that has fallen into decay. The\r\njail is likewise in so ruined a state as scarcely to deserve the name\r\nof a prison, although there are generally a few criminals confined in\r\nit; it was guarded by two soldiers who performed their duty so easily,\r\nthat in passing I seldom saw them otherwise occupied than either in\r\nplaying cards or sleeping in the shade of the building; a serjeant\r\nwho was confined during my stay in this place for disobedience to his\r\nofficer, was known almost every night to get out by one of the windows,\r\nwhich have only wooden bars, when after sleeping in his own house,\r\nhe returned to spend the day in prison. The whole population amounts\r\nprobably to about two thousand, the greater part of whom are either\r\nIndians or their mixed descendants; the more respectable portion of the\r\ninhabitants are Brazilians, who for the most part are shopkeepers; but\r\nhow the poorer races gain a livelihood I am at a loss to determine. The\r\ninhabitants of this part of the province, who are generally known by\r\nthe Indian appellation of Caryrís, are celebrated throughout Brazil for\r\ntheir lawless character; it formerly used to be, and still is, though\r\nnot to the same extent, a place of refuge to murderers and vagabonds of\r\nall sorts from other parts of the country, and although it contains a\r\njustice of the peace, a Juiz de Direito, and other officials of the law,\r\nthey possess but little power, and even if that little be exercised,\r\nthey run great risk of falling under the knife of the assassin; several\r\nmurderers were pointed out to me, who walked about quite openly. The\r\nprincipal danger to which they are exposed, is from the friends of the\r\nperson they have murdered, who follow them to a great distance, and lose\r\nno opportunity of seeking their revenge. The state of morality generally\r\namong the inhabitants of Crato is at a very low ebb, card playing is\r\nthe principal occupation during the day, when in fine weather groups of\r\nall classes, from those called the great people (gente grande) to the\r\nlowest, may be observed seated on the pavement on the shaded side of the\r\nstreet deeply employed in gambling; the more respectable generally play\r\nfor dollars, the poorer either for copper money, or more commonly make\r\nuse of spotted beans in lieu of counters; quarrels on these occasions\r\nare of course very common, which are not unfrequently settled with the\r\nknife. Scarcely any of the better class live with their wives: a few\r\nyears after their marriage, they generally turn them out of the house\r\nto live separately, and replace them by young women who are willing to\r\nsupply their place without being bound by the ties of matrimony. In this\r\nmanner these people have two houses to keep up: among others who are\r\nliving in this condition I may mention the Juiz de Direito, the Juiz dos\r\nOrfãos, and most of the larger shopkeepers; such a state of immorality\r\nis not to be wondered at, when the conduct of the clergy is taken into\r\nconsideration, the vicar (vigario), who was then an old man between\r\nseventy and eighty years of age, is the father of six natural children,\r\none of whom was educated as a priest, afterwards became president of the\r\nprovince, and was then a senator of the Empire, although still retaining\r\nhis clerical title. During my stay in Crato he arrived there on a visit\r\nto his father, bringing with him his mistress, who was his own cousin,\r\nand eight children out of ten he had by her, having at the same time five\r\nother children by another woman, who died in child-bed of the sixth.\r\nBesides the vigario there were three other priests in the town, all of\r\nwhom have families by women with whom they live openly, one of them being\r\nthe wife of another person.\r\n\r\nI lived about five months among these people, but in no other part of\r\nBrazil, even during a much shorter residence, did I live on less terms\r\nof intimacy with them or make fewer friends; besides Senhor Mello,\r\nthe only individual whose house I visited frequently, was another son\r\nof the old vicar, Capitão João Gonzalvez, who was the proprietor of a\r\nsugar (Rapadura) plantation, about two leagues below the town. I first\r\nmade his acquaintance from his having consulted me about his wife, who\r\nwas labouring under chronic ophthalmia; he was a man of an amiable\r\nand excellent disposition, and I still look back with pleasure on the\r\nhours spent in his house. The eyes of the lady improved much under my\r\ntreatment, and as she was very communicative and good-natured, we had\r\nmany long conversations about the manners and customs of our respective\r\ncountries. The family consisted of two daughters, one of whom was\r\nmarried, and lived at a place I afterwards visited about sixteen leagues\r\ndistant, the younger one, a fine girl about sixteen years of age, was\r\nvery shy in making her appearance, so that I did not see her during my\r\nfirst two or three visits; but as her mother afterwards told me, her\r\ncuriosity to see and speak with an Englishman, at length completely got\r\nthe better of her reserve, so that afterwards she always appeared when\r\nI was there. She was then about to be married to a younger brother of\r\nher sister’s husband, having been betrothed to him for many years: it is\r\nindeed seldom that the daughters of respectable families are allowed the\r\npower of choosing a husband for themselves, the parents always taking\r\ncare to make the arrangements in such cases.\r\n\r\nAt this plantation I had often an opportunity of seeing the manner in\r\nwhich Rapadura is made; the expression and boiling of the juice are\r\nperformed at the same time; the mill is of very clumsy construction,\r\nconsisting of a frame-work containing three vertical wooden rollers\r\nthrough which the cane is passed to express the juice, which is collected\r\nin a receiver below, where it runs into a trough that had been hollowed\r\nout of a large tree. The cane requires to be passed three times through\r\nthe mill before the whole of the juice is expressed: from this trough\r\na portion of the juice is conveyed from time to time into small brass\r\nboiling pans, of which there were nine, all placed close beside each\r\nother over small openings in the top of an arched furnace, and during the\r\ndifferent stages of the operation, as the evaporation proceeds, the juice\r\nis poured from one pan into the other, till in the last it acquires the\r\ndesired consistency; it is then transferred into a large tub, hollowed\r\nout of solid wood, called a Gamella, and allowed to cool for some time,\r\nwhen it is finally run out into wooden moulds about the size and shape\r\nof our common bricks, although some are made about half this size; after\r\nbeing removed from the moulds, they are allowed to harden for some days,\r\nwhen they are fit for the market; the larger size sell at Crato for about\r\na penny each, in Icó for three halfpence, and in Aracaty for twopence\r\neach.\r\n\r\nSugar cane, mandiocca, rice and tobacco are the principal articles\r\ncultivated in Crato. The ordinary tropical fruit trees grow in and around\r\nthe town, such as the orange, the lime, the lemon, the banana, the\r\nmango, the papáw, the jack, the bread-fruit, and the cashew; grapes,\r\npine-apples, melons and water-melons are also commonly cultivated; these\r\nfruits are sold very cheap, thus, oranges a penny per dozen, pine-apples,\r\nlarge and of a fine flavour, twopence each, and large melons may be had\r\nat the same price. The country gradually rises from Crato towards the\r\nS.W. till it reaches the base of the Serra de Araripe, an elevated\r\ntable-land forming a semicircle round the undulatory plain in which\r\nthe town is situated; this Serra is from one and a half to two leagues\r\ndistant from Crato, and from the numerous springs that rise from its\r\nbase, may be attributed the great fertility of this part of the Sertão,\r\nthe small streams from which are diverted in a thousand directions\r\nfor the purpose of irrigation. At present but a small portion of this\r\nfertile district is cultivated, although it would amply repay such\r\nlabour; the vicinity being but thinly peopled, and the habits of the\r\nnatives extremely indolent; with very little trouble they can raise all\r\nthat is necessary to support life, and seem to care for nothing beyond\r\nthis. Their dress is of the most simple description, and consequently\r\nnot expensive; when, however, the population becomes more numerous,\r\nand civilization shall have multiplied their wants, this district will\r\nassuredly prove a rich and valuable part of the province; the greatest\r\ndrawback to it is the want of any other than land communication with\r\nthe coast. The union of the little streams which flow from the Serra\r\nde Araripe forms a rivulet that passes close to the town of Crato, and\r\naffords an abundant supply of excellent clear water to the inhabitants at\r\nall seasons; it offers also some deep pools that serve as bathing places,\r\na luxury in which they are very fond of indulging, especially during the\r\nhot season.\r\n\r\nDuring my residence at this place I made many excursions in the\r\nneighbourhood, but the Serra de Araripe proved the best field for my\r\nresearches, I spent several days at different times, in exploring its\r\nravines, sides, and summit, every trip yielding me large supplies of\r\nnew and rare plants. The greater portion of the wooded districts around\r\nCrato consists of deciduous trees and shrubs, forming what are called\r\nCatingas, but in low moist localities, and along the base of the Serra, a\r\ngreat many of the trees are evergreen; one of the most common denizens\r\nof the Catingas is the _Magonia glabrata_, St. Hil., which is here truly\r\ngregarious, covering large tracts for miles to the exclusion of almost\r\neverything else; in general it is a tree from thirty to forty feet high,\r\nbut at full growth it often attains a much greater stature. Like many\r\nof the other inhabitants of the Catingas, its flowers appear before the\r\nleaves, they are in large panicles, of a greenish yellow colour, and of\r\nvery sweet scent. It is called Tingi by the natives, who apply it to\r\nmany useful purposes; an infusion of the bark of the root is employed\r\nto poison fish, and that of the stem to cure old ulcers. The fruit is\r\na large dry triangular capsule filled with broad flat seeds, from the\r\nkernels of which a kind of soap is manufactured; the manner in which they\r\nmake it is this. After having taken off the brown membrane which covers\r\nthe seeds, they are put into a tub of water to steep for some time, when\r\nthe cotyledons begin to swell and soften, the thin skin which still\r\ncovers them is easily taken off, and they are then put into a pot along\r\nwith a small portion of tallow; by boiling and stirring them they soon\r\nform a homogeneous mass, which, when cool, is said to answer very well\r\nfor washing clothes. Another tree which grows in similar situations, is\r\na species of _Caryocar_, that presents a fine appearance when covered\r\nwith its large corymbs of yellow flowers; the fruit, which was not ripe\r\nduring my stay, is said to be excellent when cooked, and its hard wood\r\nis of great use as timber in the construction of mills. The Visgeira,\r\nalready mentioned, and the Timbahuba, are also two large trees of the\r\nneighbourhood; the latter belongs to the _Mimosa_ tribe, producing large\r\nround heads of yellowish flowers, and a broad legume curved round so as\r\nto resemble a horse-shoe. A kind of small deer that much frequents the\r\nwoods is very fond of this fruit, and is often watched for at night at\r\nthe season when the fruit falls, being discovered by the rattling noise\r\nwhich the seeds make within the pod when trodden upon. The Jatobá, a\r\nspecies of _Hymenæa_, is another large tree of common occurrence, as\r\nalso the Augelim, a large and beautiful species of the genus _Andira_;\r\ntwo _Bignonias_ of considerable size are also common in the distant\r\nwoods, one with purple, the other with yellowish flowers, but owing to\r\nthe durability and hardness of their timber, which is much sought after\r\nby the natives for the construction of mills and carts, they are not\r\nallowed to attain any great size near the town of Crato. Besides these\r\nthere are many other trees of smaller size, among which may be mentioned\r\nthe Pao de Jangada (_Apeiba Tibourbou_), and one of frequent occurrence,\r\nand conspicuous from its large prickly capsules; on the coast its wood\r\naffords the material for the raft-boats before described, so commonly in\r\nuse there. A species of _Byrsonema_, a _Callisthene_, a _Gomphia_, and a\r\n_Vitex_, are all remarkably beautiful when in blossom. When planks are\r\nrequired in most, indeed I may say in all parts of the Sertão, there is a\r\nsad waste of timber, for to obtain one an entire tree is chopped on both\r\nsides until it is reduced to the exact size required.\r\n\r\nA number of wild fruits are found in the Catingas, among these are the\r\nMangába, already spoken of as very common about Pernambuco, the Guava,\r\nthe Araça, and also, but only on the top of the Serra, a nearly allied\r\nspecies called Marangaba; it is the _Psidium pigmeum_ of Arrudo, a shrub\r\nfrom one to two feet high, the fruit of which is about the size of a\r\ngooseberry, and is greatly sought after on account of its delicious\r\nflavour, which resembles that of the strawberry. The woods in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of the town produce a fruit called Pusá, which\r\nbelongs to a new species of _Mouriria_ (_M. Pusá_, Gardn.); it is about\r\nthe size of a small plum, of a black colour, and resembles very much in\r\ntaste the fruit of the Jaboticaba (_Eugenia cauliflora_, DC.) of the\r\nsouth of Brazil; when in season it is brought to the town and carried\r\nthrough the streets for sale by the Indians. The Cashew is also very\r\ncommon, but the eatable portion of the fruit is smaller and not so well\r\ntasted as that which grows along the coast.\r\n\r\nOne day, near the Serra de Araripe, I passed an encampment of Gipsies\r\nconsisting of about a dozen men, women, and children; these people are\r\nnot uncommon in the interior of Brazil, for I either met with them,\r\nor heard of them in almost every town I visited; they are generally\r\ndisliked by the common people, but are encouraged by the more wealthy,\r\nas was the case on the present occasion, for they were encamped beneath\r\nsome large trees near the house of a major in the National Guards, who\r\nis the proprietor of a large cane plantation at the foot of the Serra;\r\nalthough of a darker colour, they have quite the same features as the\r\nGipsies of Great Britain, many both of the young men and women being very\r\nhandsome; they seldom come near the large towns of the coast, preferring\r\nmore thinly inhabited, and consequently more lawless districts; they\r\nwander from farm to farm, and from village to village, buying, selling,\r\nand exchanging horses and various articles of jewellery; like those of\r\nEurope they are often accused of stealing horses, fowls, or whatever\r\nthey can lay their hands upon; the old women tell fortunes, in which\r\nthey are much encouraged by the young ladies of the places they visit.\r\nAlthough they speak Portuguese like the other inhabitants of the country,\r\namong themselves they always make use of their own language, always\r\nintermarry, are said to pay no attention to the religious observances\r\nof the country, nor to use any form of worship of their own; they are\r\ncalled Ciganos by the Brazilians. Just about the time that the Gipsies\r\nmade their appearance near Crato, one of my horses was missed from its\r\npasturage, and it was strongly suspected they had carried it off, but in\r\nthis instance at least they were wrongly accused, for I have good reason\r\nto believe that the person who made free with it, was a Fazendeiro who\r\nwas very anxious to purchase it from me only a day or two before it was\r\nstolen, just as he was on the eve of returning from Crato to his Engenho\r\nmany leagues to the westward. As it had my own brand upon one of its\r\nhind legs, and as it was well known about the neighbourhood that it had\r\ndisappeared, I was assured by the justice of the peace that it would\r\nultimately be found, and he was right, for about six weeks afterwards,\r\nit was found in a wood about three leagues from the town, but instead of\r\nbeing an animal in fine condition, it was now little better than skin\r\nand bone. The person who took it was one Josè Pereira de Hollanda, a man\r\nwhose character was not held in much estimation, and by whom it had been\r\nused to hunt down cattle on his estate.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay in Crato the festival of our Lady of Conception was\r\ncelebrated; great rejoicings were kept up for nine days previously, the\r\nexpenses of which were defrayed by the different individuals appointed to\r\nconduct it; during the whole period of the Novena, as it is called, the\r\nfew soldiers stationed in the town kept up an almost continued fire, both\r\nday and night; so that with this, and the processions, illuminations, and\r\ndischarges of fireworks, and of small cannon in front of the church, the\r\nVilla was one continued scene of uproar. As the last night was said to\r\nbe the finest of all, I went about seven o’clock to the church, before\r\nwhich a number of flags were flying on poles, and two large bonfires\r\nblazing; on the terrace before the sacred edifice, an immense crowd\r\nhad assembled, and about half a dozen soldiers were from time to time\r\ndischarging their muskets; at a little distance, a band of musicians\r\nwere playing, consisting of two fifers and two drummers, but the music\r\nthey produced was of the most wretched description; there was also a\r\ndisplay of fireworks quite in keeping with the music. The church inside\r\nwas brilliantly illuminated and almost full, but I was surprised to see\r\nthat nearly the whole of the congregation consisted of females; they were\r\nall dressed in white, or at least with a white kind of mantilla over\r\nthe head and shoulders. On the following day a little before dusk, a\r\nlarge procession, consisting entirely of men, passed through the various\r\nstreets, figures of the Virgin and her Son being carried in great pomp;\r\nthe three priests of the Villa, together with the Visitador, or deputy of\r\nthe Bishop, who was then on his usual triennial tour through the villages\r\nand towns of the province, walked under a scarlet canopy. The whole\r\naffair was wound up on the succeeding afternoon (Sunday) by exhibitions\r\non the tight-rope, and a dance of masqueraders, in front of the church.\r\n\r\nThe mean temperature of Crato is much lower than that of Icó; it is not\r\nconsidered so healthy as the latter place, for the heat of the day is\r\nnearly as great, although the nights are much colder. Ophthalmia is truly\r\nendemic, and, during some part of the year, few escape its effects: I had\r\nan attack which confined me to the house for several days. Many persons\r\nsuffering from the disease in its chronic state, consulted me, and I\r\ngained no little reputation from having either cured or much alleviated\r\nthe symptoms in most of the cases that presented themselves, even when\r\nthe complaint had been of long standing; blindness is a very common\r\nresult, and nowhere have I seen a greater number of blind people than\r\nin this district. Secondary syphilitic complaints are also very common,\r\nand many are the miserable wretches which they have here produced; in\r\nsuch cases, mercury is very seldom employed for the primary symptoms,\r\nthese being generally cured by a species of _Croton_, commonly known by\r\nthe name of Velame; it is used both externally and internally with some\r\neffect, but under this treatment sooner or later the secondary symptoms\r\nmake their appearance, under some one or other of their protean forms.\r\nA residence of but a short time in the interior of Brazil, would soon\r\nconvince those medical men who would cure these complaints without\r\nmercury, of the danger of such treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nCEARA CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n    Reasons for delaying journey into the Interior—Visits,\r\n    meanwhile, different places in the Vicinity of Crato—Crosses\r\n    the Serra de Araripe—Reaches Cajazeira—Arrives at Barra do\r\n    Jardim—Description of that Town and Neighbourhood—Meets with\r\n    an interesting deposit of Fossil Fishes—Geological character\r\n    of the Country—Detects a very extensive range of Chalk\r\n    formation—First discovery of such Beds in South America—The\r\n    accompanying formation described—This range of Mountains\r\n    encircles the vast Plain comprising the Provinces of Piauhy\r\n    and Maranham—Arrives at Maçapé—Great Religious Festival\r\n    on Christmas Day—Meets with an Accident—Visits also Novo\r\n    Mundo—Discovers other deposits of Fossil Fishes near these\r\n    places—Vegetable productions along the Taboleira—Different\r\n    Tribes of uncivilised Indians in that Neighbourhood—Curious\r\n    account of the Fanatical Sect of the Sebastianistas—Their\r\n    extravagant belief—Commit human sacrifices—Their destruction\r\n    and dispersion—Returns to Crato.\r\n\r\n\r\nI found on my arrival at Crato that it would be necessary to remain there\r\nlonger than I had previously anticipated, owing to the desert state of\r\nthe country, in the dry season, between it and Oeiras, the capital of the\r\nprovince of Piauhy, at which time water and grass are so scarce, that\r\nonly those well acquainted with the country would undertake this journey:\r\nI was, therefore, strongly recommended to defer leaving Crato till the\r\nrains should set in, to which advice I was the more willing to listen,\r\nfinding that district a very good field for my botanical researches,\r\nand knowing well, moreover, that a journey to Oeiras at that time would\r\nyield very little. It was now the beginning of December, and the rains\r\nwere not expected to set in till the beginning of February. Having pretty\r\nwell exhausted the neighbourhood of Crato, I determined to visit in the\r\ninterim a small town about sixteen leagues distant, called Villa da\r\nBarra do Jardim, being the more desirous to spend some time at that place\r\nin order to search for a deposit of fossil fishes which were reported\r\nto exist in the neighbourhood. My friend Capitão João Gonsalvez gave me\r\nletters to his relation Capitão Antonio da Cruz, the principal person in\r\nthe place, and on the afternoon of the eleventh of December I left Crato.\r\nThe road for the first five leagues runs nearly eastward along the Serra\r\nde Araripe, and after having accomplished four of them we halted for the\r\nnight, about eight o’clock, at a little village called Cajazeira; on\r\nenquiring for a place where we might pass the night, it being then quite\r\ndark, we were directed to a shed used for the preparation of farinha,\r\nwhich, besides being open all round, was but indifferently roofed; this,\r\nhowever, proved a better shelter than a large tree under which we first\r\nthought of encamping, for about midnight we were awakened by a tremendous\r\npeal of thunder that broke right over us. The storm continued with more\r\nor less violence for nearly half an hour, and was followed by a very\r\nheavy shower of rain, which caused me no inconvenience as my hammock\r\nwas slung under a comparatively well-roofed part, although Pedro and\r\nthe guide were soon obliged to change their quarters. On our arrival\r\nwe found the village illuminated with several bonfires, and there was\r\nalso much firing and other rejoicings, occasioned by the presence of the\r\nVisitador who reached this place during the day, intending to proceed to\r\nBarra do Jardim on the following morning. It was seven o’clock before\r\nwe could resume our journey, and in an hour’s time we reached the foot\r\nof the Serra with the view of crossing it, but we first halted for a\r\nshort time in order to take some breakfast, being informed that neither\r\nhouses nor water were to be met with during the next eight leagues of\r\nthe journey. At a distance of half an hour’s ride from Cajazeira we met\r\na number of well-dressed horsemen, one of whom, finding on enquiry that\r\nI was the English Botanist about to visit Jardim, told me that his name\r\nwas Gouvea; that he had heard of my intended visit from his friends in\r\nCrato, to which place he was then going, intending to return in the\r\ncourse of a few days. From him I also learned that his companions had\r\ncome to meet the Visitador, and escort him to Jardim; in half an hour’s\r\ntime they all passed us on their return, in company with the prelate, and\r\nsoon afterwards the Visitador’s troop overtook us, consisting of eight or\r\nnine horses, one of which was loaded with water for the journey across\r\nthe Taboleira, as all elevated flat tracts are called in the interior.\r\nThe water was carried in large leathern bags, and as I had not as yet\r\nprovided myself with such an apparatus, I was contented with purchasing\r\na number of oranges, and a few pieces of sugar cane, as very palatable\r\nsubstitutes, and on a short journey easily carried. The Serra is scarcely\r\nso high here as it is at Crato, but the ascent is very rugged, and in\r\nseveral places very steep. About half an hour after we descended the\r\nSerra we passed the Visitador and his party, all lying under the shade\r\nof a large tree, eating the fruit of the Mangába which grew abundantly\r\naround them: he kindly invited me to remain and partake of his breakfast,\r\nfor which he was awaiting the arrival of his troop, but I declined his\r\nkind offer as I was anxious to cross the Serra without halting. It\r\noccupied a ride of nearly six hours to traverse this table land, which\r\nis perfectly level all the way; it is thinly studded with small trees,\r\nwhich give it very much the appearance of an English orchard; the soil\r\nwas thickly covered with long grass, which was now dried up like hay;\r\nin many places it had been set fire to, and large tracts burned, which\r\nI afterwards found to be a very common practice in the open campos of\r\nBrazil towards the end of the dry season, in order that after the first\r\nrains a good crop of new grass may thus be obtained; it is, indeed,\r\nastonishing to witness the rapidity with which it then springs up. The\r\nvegetation on this Taboleira I found to be so very similar to that on\r\nthe top of the Serra at Crato, that with the exception of a single\r\nspecimen of a shrubby species of _Cassia_, I did not meet with anything\r\nI had not before collected; on the ascent of the Serra, however, I found\r\na new species of _Rollinia_ in flower. It was not till we had reached\r\nnearly the extremity of the Taboleira, that I came in sight of the valley\r\nin which the Villa da Barra do Jardim is situated, from the rich and\r\nverdant appearance of which it takes the name of Jardim, or Garden. The\r\nSerra being lower on the south than on the north side, the descent is\r\nmuch easier, and the road is also better.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Villa, which is nearly a league from the foot of the\r\nSerra, I found that we had passed the house of Captain Antonio da Cruz,\r\nso that we were obliged to turn back half a league, and I felt annoyed\r\nfor not having sooner made enquiries, as our horses were greatly fatigued\r\nafter so long a journey, performed during the whole time under a burning\r\nsun. On arriving at the house, which is attached to his Engenho, I met\r\nwith a kind reception from the Captain, as well as from his son, and the\r\nlady of the latter, who was the daughter of my Crato friend, Captain\r\nGonsalvez, with both of whom I had been previously acquainted during\r\ntheir visit to the latter place. My horses were immediately sent to\r\npasture, and dinner prepared, for which I felt an excellent appetite\r\nafter this long day’s ride. Aware of my intended visit, they had kindly\r\nprepared an uninhabited house in the town for my reception, to which they\r\nwould not allow me to go till the following morning after breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe Villa da Barra do Jardim lies south from Crato, bearing a little\r\nto the eastward, the valley in which it is situated being about a\r\nleague in length, and in its widest part about half a league broad;\r\nthe town is small, in the form of a large square, three sides of which\r\nonly are completed, and nearly in the centre of this square stands its\r\nonly church, also in an unfinished state. At the time of my visit the\r\nsurrounding country was very much burnt up, particularly towards the\r\nsouth; but on the north side of the town, towards the bottom of the\r\nSerra, there were many small plantations of cane, watered by small\r\nstreams which take their rise in the Serra; without these the valley\r\nwould then have been quite at variance with its name. Here, as around\r\nCrato, cane is the principal article cultivated, but in the neighbourhood\r\nof the Villa there are two or three very small plantations of coffee,\r\nfor which the place seems well adapted, judging from their vigorous\r\nappearance, and the large crops they were said to yield; the quantity\r\nraised in this neighbourhood is not, however, sufficient for its own\r\nconsumption, what more is required, and indeed the whole that is consumed\r\nin other parts of the province, being imported from Rio de Janeiro.\r\nUpon asking several of the proprietors of cane plantations why they did\r\nnot plant coffee in preference, seeing the much greater profit it would\r\nbring them, they all replied that, being accustomed to the making of\r\nRapadura, they did not like to risk it for a system of cultivation with\r\nwhich they were but imperfectly acquainted; but the principal cause, in\r\nmy own opinion, is their lazy and indolent habits, and the great horror\r\nthey entertain of anything like innovation on the customs of their\r\nforefathers; were the country in the possession of an industrious people,\r\nthis would no doubt become one of the richest districts in the north of\r\nBrazil.\r\n\r\nTwo days after my arrival I paid a visit to Captain Antonio da Cruz,\r\nwhere I learned that on a rising ground between his house and the Serra,\r\nthere were often found rounded limestones, which when split exhibited\r\nthe remains of fishes; two of his sons accompanied me to the spot, where\r\nI made a collection of several species more or less perfect. The place\r\nwhere these were found was on the slope of a low hill about a mile from\r\nthe Serra,—the stone in which they occur being an impure dark-coloured\r\nlimestone: I found them of all sizes, but none larger than I could lift,\r\nall were more or less rounded, having evidently undergone attrition.\r\nThe place which they occupy is not above a hundred yards square, and in\r\nthis extent scarcely any other kind of stone is found, but beyond it the\r\nground is covered in a similar manner with rounded blocks of sandstone\r\nof the same nature as that which forms the mass of the Serra. Similar\r\ndeposits exist along the base of the range, but all in isolated patches,\r\nas in the present instance. I have purposely deferred till now making any\r\nremarks on the geology of the district around Crato, but I must premise\r\nthat the substance of what is here stated is taken from a paper read by\r\nme before the Glasgow Philosophical Society, in April 1843, and which has\r\nsince appeared in the Proceedings of that Society.\r\n\r\nNothing like chalk, with its accompanying flints, has yet been found\r\non the continent of North America; but in New Jersey Dr. Morton has\r\ndescribed a deposit which he considers to be equivalent to the lower or\r\ngreen sand beds of that formation, and to which he has given the name of\r\n“The ferruginous sand formation of the United States.” The fossil remains\r\nwhich it contains prove the correctness of his opinion. As regards the\r\nSouth American continent, it is asserted by Humboldt, that it contains\r\nneither oolite nor chalk, from the fact that no traveller who has\r\nhitherto written on the geology of that immense continent, has ever met\r\nwith either; it was therefore a source of no little satisfaction to me to\r\nfind that I had been the first to discover, in the new world, the entire\r\nseries of rocks which constitute the chalk formation, specimens of all of\r\nwhich I did not fail to collect.\r\n\r\nThe Serra de Araripe, or that which runs between Crato and Barra do\r\nJardim, is only an eastern branch of an elevated table-land which\r\nstretches continuously from the sea-coast, southward, and forms a\r\nnatural boundary between the two great provinces of Ceará and Piauhy.\r\nIt is generally elevated from 500 to 1,000 feet above the level of the\r\ncountry to the east of it, but not so much above that to the west; to\r\nthis range the name of Serra Vermelha is given by the Portuguese, and\r\nIbiapaba by the Indians. Between the 10th and 11th degrees of latitude\r\nit takes a westerly direction, and in about 47° of longitude takes a\r\nnortherly sweep, finally terminating at the mouth of the River Amazon,\r\nunder the equator, the country which it surrounds forming a valley of\r\ngreat extent, including the entire provinces of Piauhy and Maranham. This\r\nelevated range varies much in breadth, as many branches run off from it,\r\nboth to the east and to the west; the top is nearly perfectly level,\r\nforming, as before mentioned, what the Brazilians call Taboleiras. The\r\ngreat mass of the Serra consists of a very soft, whitish, yellowish, or\r\nreddish-coloured sandstone, which in many places must be more than six\r\nhundred feet thick; and in this rock exist the nodules which contain\r\nthe fossil fishes. The circumstance that first led me to suspect this\r\nrock belonged to the chalk formation, was an immense accumulation of\r\nflints and septaria similar to those of the chalk of England, which I\r\nfound on the acclivity of the range during a journey made along its\r\nbase to the north of Crato. I now began to inquire if anything like\r\nchalk was found in the neighbourhood, when I learned there were several\r\npits in the Serra, whence the inhabitants obtained it for the purpose of\r\nwhite-washing their houses; these pits I afterwards found to be situated\r\nin a deep layer of red-coloured diluvial clay, which lies immediately\r\nover the sandstone of the Serra. In a ravine near Crato I endeavoured to\r\nascertain the formation on which the sandstone rested, when I found it to\r\nconsist of several layers of more or less compact limestones and marls,\r\nwith a bed of lignite about two feet thick; upon what these rested I\r\ncould not at that time ascertain, but some time afterwards when I crossed\r\nto the west side of the range, I found these limestones existing upon a\r\ndeposit of very dark-red coarse-grained sandstone, abounding in small\r\nnodules of iron-stone. Thus we find that the structure of the rocks in\r\nthis locality is very similar to that of the chalk formation in England;\r\nthere is\r\n\r\n    1st. A ferruginous sandstone deposit, equivalent to the lower\r\n    green sand or Shanklin sand.\r\n\r\n    2nd. A deposit of marls, soft and compact limestones, and\r\n    lignite, equivalent to the English gault.\r\n\r\n    3rd. A very thick deposit of fine-grained, soft, variously\r\n    coloured sandstone, containing Ichthyolites, equivalent to the\r\n    upper green sand of England.\r\n\r\n    4th. The white chalk itself, and flints occurring in pits\r\n    partially covered by red diluvial clay.\r\n\r\nFlints are very common along the foot of the Serra, to the N.W. of Crato,\r\nbut none were found in any of the chalk-pits that I examined: I learned,\r\nhowever, that at a considerable distance to the north of Crato, at a\r\nportion of this mountain range, called the Serra de Botarité, both chalk\r\nand flints are far more abundant than they are near the former place,\r\nwhere they seem to have been almost entirely washed away, previous to the\r\ndeposition of the red clay in which they are now found.\r\n\r\nSince the time when these rocks were first deposited at the bottom of\r\nthe sea to the present period, both they and the surrounding country must\r\nhave undergone various changes with respect to elevation; but before\r\nmaking any observations on this subject, I will point out the various\r\nplaces where I have met with traces of the chalk formation, besides that\r\njust described. In 1838, during my voyage up the Rio de San Francisco,\r\nwhich empties itself into the Atlantic between the 10th and 11th degrees\r\nof south latitude, I obtained specimens of the rock on which the Villa\r\ndo Penêdo is built, and on comparison these proved to be identical\r\nwith those from the upper sandstone of Crato. In 1839, I found the\r\nferruginous sandstone of Crato extending westward thence about 500 miles,\r\nand in the year 1841 I observed at Maranham, in 2° of south latitude,\r\nand 44° of west longitude, a formation very similar to that at Crato.\r\nThe whole island on which the city of Maranham is built, consists of a\r\nvery dark-red ferruginous sandstone; on the main land to the westward,\r\nthe same rock was observed rising a little above the sea level, but\r\nimmediately upon it there exists a deposit, in some places more than 50\r\nfeet thick, of a yellowish and greenish coloured sandstone, very soft,\r\nand of a marly nature.\r\n\r\nFrom these data, then, I think there can be little doubt that the\r\nwhole of that immense shoulder which forms the more easterly point of\r\nthe American continent, has at one time been a great depository for\r\nthe chalk formation. The only other rocks that I observed in places\r\ndenuded of the deposits belonging to the chalk are, 1st, gneiss and\r\nmica-slate, the layers of which crop out in nearly a vertical direction,\r\nas was frequently observed on my journey from the coast, and during my\r\nvoyage up the Rio de San Francisco; and, 2nd, beds of grey-coloured\r\nclay-slate, which I passed over about 18 leagues below Crato. The whitish\r\ncoarse-grained sandstone that I met with immediately afterwards, is\r\nprobably equivalent to the ferruginous sandstone found on the west side\r\nof the range; from this it would appear, that between the cretaceous\r\nseries and the primary stratified rocks, there are no traces either of\r\nthe carboniferous or the oolite formations, nor in any part of Brazil\r\nthrough which I afterwards travelled did I meet with any signs of them.[5]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the country, from the coast to Crato, is for\r\nthe most part level, large portions being covered with coarse white sand\r\nor gravel of various sizes, which give it the appearance of the dried\r\nup bed of an immense river; much of this gravel consists of flints, and\r\nintermingled with them are numerous boulders of various sizes, more\r\nor less rounded, consisting of granite, gneiss, and quartz. Whenever\r\nthese gravelly tracts cease to appear, the surface of the country is\r\ncovered with a deposit of the same kind of red clay which lies over the\r\nupper sandstone of the table-land. To the westward of this table-land,\r\nconsiderable portions are covered with the variously shaped iron-stone\r\nnodules, found in the ferruginous sandstone, and which have accumulated\r\nfrom the decay of that rock.\r\n\r\nI have now to offer a few remarks on the changes of elevation which this\r\npart of the continent has undergone since the chalk rocks were first\r\ndeposited; it is manifest that that deposition took place at the bottom\r\nof a shallow ocean, and it admits of no doubt that at some subsequent\r\nperiod it has been gradually elevated above the level of the sea; it\r\nis evident that this elevation has been gradual, from the horizontal\r\nposition of the strata of which the deposit is formed; for had the\r\nelevating cause been sudden and violent, their original position would\r\nnot have been so perfectly maintained. The first portion that emerged\r\nfrom the sea was probably the long elevated table-land, which for a\r\nperiod must have formed a neck of land separating the Atlantic Ocean on\r\nthe east, from the great bay which the immense valley to the westward\r\nmust then have formed.\r\n\r\nFrom some of the foregoing observations it is obvious that the chalk\r\nformation at one time must have covered a very great tract of the\r\nsurrounding country, and we may very reasonably conclude that it was\r\nduring the gradual elevation of the land, that the action of the waves\r\nof the ocean as gradually destroyed the soft materials of which it had\r\nbeen fabricated. But long after this had been accomplished, and at a\r\ncomparatively recent geological period, the whole country seems again to\r\nhave been covered with water,—not only the nearly level country between\r\nthe shores of the present sea and the elevated table-land, but even the\r\nhighest parts of the table-land itself. This is proved by the thick\r\nstratum which exists on both, of a deep red-coloured diluvial clay,\r\nsimilar to that which I have observed to cover nearly the whole surface\r\nof Brazil, from the sea-shore to the summits nearly of the highest\r\nmountains, and which is often more than forty feet in thickness. When\r\nthis is cut through it is found to consist of various layers of clay\r\nand sandy gravel, in which are imbedded rounded stones of different\r\nsizes. These have evidently been deposited from water; and in that part\r\nof the country in which we are now speaking, this deposition of clay\r\nmust have taken place at a period subsequent to the inundation of the\r\ncountry to the east and west of the table-land. This could only have been\r\naccomplished by the sinking of the land again beneath the level of the\r\nsea, which will account for the nearly total destruction of the white\r\nchalk, as well as for those small cones of it which remain imbedded in\r\nthe red clay,—that deposit having been laid down before the whole of the\r\nchalk could be washed away; since then this part of the continent must\r\nhave gradually emerged a second time from the bosom of the ocean.\r\n\r\nPart of my collection of fossil fishes were sent to the care of my much\r\nlamented friend the late J. E. Bowman, Esq., of Manchester, shortly\r\nafter I found them; these were exhibited by him at the Meeting of the\r\nBritish Association at Glasgow, where they were seen by M. Agassiz, and\r\nalthough no specimens of the rocks accompanied them, he immediately,\r\nfrom their zoological characters alone, pronounced them to belong to the\r\nchalk series. It is well known that this learned naturalist divides all\r\nfishes into four great classes, from the nature of their scales; two of\r\nthese, the _Ctenoid_ and _Cycloid_, never make their appearance in any\r\nof the rocks beneath the chalk, and it was from his knowledge of this\r\nfact that he decided my specimens to be from that formation, as they\r\nconsisted chiefly of individuals of the _Ctenoid_ and _Cycloid_ groups.\r\nThe fishes are in a most perfect state of preservation, and, as I have\r\nalready stated, are included in an impure fawn-coloured limestone; the\r\nblocks, however, in which they are preserved, are only nodules contained\r\nin the yellowish coloured sandstone. They have in general somewhat the\r\nform of the imbedded fish, and the carbonaceous matter was apparently\r\naggregated round them by chemical attraction from the sandstone while in\r\na soft state; these nodules being harder than the sandstone, have, by its\r\ngradual decay, accumulated at various places along the acclivity of the\r\nrange, and I possess specimens both from the east and west side of it.[6]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 23rd of December I had an invitation from Lieut.\r\nCol. João José de Gouvea, a gentleman to whom I brought letters, to\r\naccompany him and the Visitador to a place called Maçapé five leagues\r\nto the east of the Villa da Barra do Jardim, whither they were going to\r\npass Christmas Day. This I gladly accepted, having been already informed\r\nthat a large deposit of fossil fishes existed there. We started at eight\r\no’clock on the morning of the 24th, and as the Visitador was not to\r\nreturn, he was accompanied for nearly a league from the Villa, by about\r\nhalf a dozen of the most respectable persons in the neighbourhood, Senhor\r\nGouvea, his lady, and Senhor Machado, and I went on to Maçapé. At about\r\nhalf a league from the Villa we entered a narrow ravine, wooded on each\r\nside with large trees, the branches of which were bearded with the long\r\n_Tillandsia usneoides_, and another large species of the same genus, but\r\nI did not observe a single Orchideous plant. This ravine is nearly half\r\na league in length, and about the middle of it arises a spring yielding\r\nan abundant supply of cool and limpid water, which lower down is applied\r\nfor the purpose of irrigation. As the ravine rises gradually, the ascent\r\nof the Serra here is less steep than by the one we passed on the road\r\nfrom Crato. Immediately on entering the Taboleira the vegetation changes,\r\nnone of the trees seen there being found below, but I did not perceive\r\nany difference from those already observed on other parts of it. After\r\na very pleasant ride of four hours, we reached the opposite side of the\r\nSerra, where a vast difference appeared in the vegetation, compared with\r\nthat of the vicinity of Jardim; here all was green and verdant, owing to\r\nseveral heavy showers that had fallen a few weeks before; the trees on\r\nthe Taboleira are also larger than those nearer to Jardim, and everything\r\ndenotes it to be a more fertile country. From the top of the descent we\r\nobtained a fine view of the undulating but uninhabited country to the\r\neast and south. The Serra here is much higher than on the western side,\r\nand the descent is far from being an easy one; at less than a quarter of\r\na league from it stands the Fazenda of Maçapé, which is the principal\r\nhouse in that place. On our arrival we found two large flags waving\r\nin the court before the house, and the Visitador was welcomed by the\r\ndischarge of about a dozen guns; shortly after our arrival numbers of\r\npeople, with children of all ages, began to assemble, and immediately\r\nafter dinner the Visitador commenced his duties of baptism, &c. Having\r\nmade enquiries for the place where the fossil fishes were to be found,\r\nI went there accompanied by Senhor Machado; after walking about half a\r\nleague, we reached the spot which much resembled that near Jardim, the\r\nstones occupying a limited space on the slope of the rising ground that\r\nruns along the foot of the Serra. This site having lately been cleared\r\nand planted with cane, we had little difficulty in procuring abundance\r\nof stones, though few good ones, for after nearly two hours’ work, I\r\ncould obtain no more than three or four tolerable specimens, most of the\r\nremains being very much broken. On our return we found an immense crowd\r\nof people assembled, while more were arriving, chiefly for the purpose\r\nof hearing the three masses that are always performed immediately on\r\nthe entrance of Christmas Day. At nine o’clock in the evening mass was\r\nsaid under the veranda, at one end of which a small altar was erected,\r\nbrilliantly illuminated with wax candles, and surmounted by a figure\r\nof the Virgin, about a foot and a half high, elegantly dressed, with\r\na gold chain round her neck, to which was attached a small toy watch.\r\nThe more respectable portion of the audience seated themselves on the\r\nground within the veranda, while the remaining men, women, and children\r\nwere squatted in a similar manner on the area of the court in front\r\nof the house; altogether not less than a thousand persons were here\r\nassembled. After the conclusion of the ceremony we partook of a supper\r\nof fresh fish, and at ten o’clock the Visitador retired to his hammock\r\nto enjoy a little sleep, prior to the commencement of his midnight\r\nlabours; I followed his example, but slept so soundly that I did not\r\nawake till after the conclusion of the mass, notwithstanding that my\r\nhammock was slung in the same confined room as that of the prelate,\r\nand the upper half of the door, which opened into the veranda, was\r\nopen. No observations were made upon my apparent neglect, but I have\r\nno doubt that I was set down as a perfect heathen. In the morning mass\r\nwas again celebrated, and when breakfast was over the Visitador resumed\r\nhis labours. During the day the place had all the appearance of a fair;\r\nEuropean goods, jewellery, provisions, rum, &c., were on all sides\r\nexposed for sale, and in the evening, dancing was carried on in the open\r\nair until a very late hour.\r\n\r\nThe following day I returned with my friends to Jardim, the Visitador\r\ngoing in another direction about two leagues distant. When about half way\r\nacross the Serra, we alighted at a spot where Mangába trees abound, in\r\norder to collect some of the fruit, which is not considered good to eat\r\nuntil after it has fallen to the ground; on this occasion Senhor Gouvea\r\nlet go his horse’s bridle, when the animal, finding itself at liberty,\r\nset off at a round pace on the road towards Jardim. I therefore instantly\r\nmounted with the intention of intercepting it, and in the act of turning\r\nround, struck my head with considerable violence against the branch of a\r\nlarge tree, which in an instant felled me to the ground. I could remember\r\nnothing that subsequently occurred till we were within half a league of\r\nJardim, when I awoke as from a sound sleep, and found myself on horseback\r\nproceeding along at a pretty quick rate behind my companions. I felt much\r\nsickness, and a considerable pain in the lower part of my forehead, but\r\nworse than all I found my memory almost gone, for after many attempts I\r\ncould not recollect in the smallest degree where I had been, or where I\r\nwas going. I recognised my companions perfectly, but could not remember\r\ntheir names, and though often spoken to felt no inclination to answer. In\r\nthis state of darkness and confusion I rode on in silence, unconscious of\r\nwhere I was going, and under the impression that I was just roused from\r\na long sleep. It was dusk when we reached the town, and though aware of\r\nhaving been there before, I could not remember its name, nor did it occur\r\nto me that it was then my place of residence. On parting with my friends\r\nI should not have known where to go had not Pedro been waiting for me at\r\nthe end of the street, for all my recollection of places was completely\r\nobliterated. Immediately on reaching home, feeling myself very unwell, I\r\nlay down and soon fell fast asleep, and on awaking late on the following\r\nmorning, found myself still labouring under a severe headache; a confused\r\nrecollection of where I had been now came over me, but I could not yet\r\nremember the name of the place, and had only a faint reminiscence of\r\nhaving fallen from my horse. I learned, however, from Senhor Machado, who\r\ncalled to enquire after me, that upon falling to the ground I remained\r\nthere some time in a state of insensibility, but that after a while I\r\narose, and without speaking to any one mounted my horse, riding behind\r\nmy companions all the way to the town, and answering nobody when spoken\r\nto; many days elapsed before I felt myself perfectly recovered from this\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that a very large deposit of fossil fishes existed at a\r\nplace called Mundo Novo, about three leagues to the west of Barra do\r\nJardim, I determined on making an excursion there prior to my departure.\r\nTo effect this object it was necessary to cross a branch of the Serra\r\nde Araripe, at a point where as on the road to Maçapé, the ridge tends\r\nnorth and south; it is here, however, only about two leagues and a half\r\nbroad. On my way I found two or three trees quite new to me, one being of\r\nlarge size, the _Copaifera nitida_, Mart., then covered with a profusion\r\nof small white flowers; its trunk yields an abundance of oil, which is\r\nemployed in the cure of ulcers, and for frictions in cases of rheumatism.\r\nAfter crossing the Serra, I found the country still more dried up than\r\nat Jardim, the sides of the mountain exhibiting only a few green trees;\r\nalong the foot of the Serra some fine large trees were seen, but as they\r\nwere then destitute of both leaves and flowers I could not ascertain\r\nto what tribe they belonged; they are called Braúna by the natives,\r\nand afford an excellent timber, which is both hard and durable, being\r\nemployed in the construction of sugar-mills, particularly for rollers. I\r\nalso now saw for the first time, the remarkable _Chorisia ventricosa_,\r\nNees et Mart., called Barriguda by the inhabitants, from the shape of\r\nits stem, which swells in the middle to five times the diameter of its\r\nupper and lower portions. About half a league to the N.W. from the foot\r\nof the Serra, we reached the first habitation on the way, which belonged\r\nto the person to whom I was recommended; he received me very kindly, and\r\ninvited me into the house, which was little better than a mere hut; upon\r\nlearning the object of my visit, he kindly offered to accompany me to\r\nthe spot. After partaking of breakfast we started, and in about half an\r\nhour reached the place; as in all the instances I had before met with,\r\nit occupied an isolated spot of considerable extent on the gentle slope\r\nof a low ridge, which runs along the base of the Serra: here also, as\r\nin other places, almost every stone contains the remains of a fish in a\r\nmore or less perfect condition; most of the smaller ones, that were only\r\nfour or five inches long, were perfectly entire, but the larger ones,\r\nsome of which measured fully six feet,[7] were always in fragments.\r\nAfter three hours labour, I collected many tolerably perfect specimens,\r\nbut no species different from those already obtained in other places.\r\nOn returning with my companion to his house, an excellent dinner was\r\nprepared, for which he refused any recompense. The kindness I received on\r\nthis occasion was indeed greater than could be expected from a person in\r\nhis poor circumstances; I was glad, however, to have an opportunity of\r\nreturning his civilities in town on New Year’s Day, and in presenting him\r\nwith several useful articles: assuredly I shall never forget the kindness\r\nof Antonio Martins of Mundo Novo.\r\n\r\nThere are two small tribes of uncivilized Indians living within the\r\ndistrict of Barra do Jardim, but their numbers are fast diminishing: the\r\none consisting of eighty individuals called Huamaës, generally reside\r\nseven leagues to the south west of that town: the other, called Xocos,\r\namounting to about seventy persons, have their usual place of abode\r\nthirteen leagues to the southward. Though generally inoffensive in their\r\ndisposition, they had a short time previous to my visit been detected in\r\nrobbing cattle from the neighbouring farms; they have occasionally made\r\ntheir appearance in the Villa, and are said to be dirty in their habits,\r\nand that when in want of better food, they will devour the rattle-snake\r\nand other serpents.\r\n\r\nIn various parts of Brazil, I met with many individuals belonging to that\r\nremarkable sect called Sebastianistas; they take this appellation from\r\ntheir belief in the return to earth of King Don Sebastian, who fell in\r\nthe celebrated battle of Alcazarquebir, while leading on his army against\r\nthe Moors. Those who profess this belief, are said to be more numerous in\r\nBrazil than in Portugal: on his return, they say, that Brazil will enjoy\r\nthe most perfect state of happiness, and all that our own millenarians\r\nanticipate will be fully realized.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay in Pernambuco, there occurred in connexion with this\r\nbelief, one of the most extraordinary scenes of fanaticism which modern\r\ntimes have given birth to, and were it not well authenticated, would be\r\nalmost incredible. Although much the subject of conversation in Brazil\r\nat that time, I am not aware that any public account of it has reached\r\nEurope. The following letter which is translated from the “Diario de\r\nPernambuco” of Monday the 16th of June, 1838, was officially addressed to\r\nSenhor Francisco Rego Barros, then President of the Province:—\r\n\r\n                                  “Comarco de Flores, 25th May, 1838.\r\n\r\n    “Most Illustrious and most Excellent Sir,\r\n\r\n    “In this first letter that I have the honour to address to\r\n    your Excellency on the state of this Comarco, which is at\r\n    present tranquil, I have to lay before your Excellency the most\r\n    extraordinary, terrible, and cruel circumstance ever heard\r\n    of, and one which is almost past belief. It is now more than\r\n    two years since a man, called Joäo Antonio, an inhabitant of\r\n    Sitio de Pedra Bonita, a place about twenty leagues from this\r\n    town, surrounded by woods, and near which are two large rocks,\r\n    called together the people, and told them, that within those\r\n    rocks there was an enchanted kingdom which he was about to\r\n    disenchant, and that immediately afterwards King Don Sebastian\r\n    would make his appearance at the head of a great army, richly\r\n    adorned, and that all who followed him would be happy. He went\r\n    on beautifying this place till the month of November of last\r\n    year, when at the recommendation of the Missionary Francisco\r\n    José Correa de Albuquerque, he made a journey to the desert\r\n    (Sertäo) of Inhamon, whence he sent back one Joäo Pereira, a\r\n    man of the worst passions, who on his arrival at Pedra Bonita\r\n    proclaimed himself King, and began to instil superstitious\r\n    notions into the minds of the people, telling them that for\r\n    the restoration of the enchanted kingdom it would be necessary\r\n    to immolate a number of men, women, and children; that in a\r\n    few days they would all rise again, and remain immortal; that\r\n    riches would abound among all classes, and that all those who\r\n    were either black or of a dark colour, would become as white as\r\n    the moon herself. In this manner he brought over many of the\r\n    ignorant people to believe in his false assertions and evil\r\n    doctrine, so much so that some fathers delivered over their\r\n    children to the knife of the sanguinary tiger.\r\n\r\n    “On the fourth of the present month, he began his present\r\n    sacrifices, and, in the course of two or three days, not\r\n    less than forty-two human beings gave up their lives under\r\n    his hands, twenty-one being adults, and twenty-one children;\r\n    he also married every man to two or three women, with\r\n    superstitious rites in accordance with his otherwise immoral\r\n    conduct, this also being part of his idolatry; the result,\r\n    however, was lo him melancholy, for Pedro Antonio, brother\r\n    to Joäo Antonio, the promulgator of these ideas, becoming\r\n    impatient of this madness, or perhaps ambitious of becoming\r\n    King himself, determined on assassinating him, which he carried\r\n    into effect on Friday the seventeenth. It was on this day that\r\n    the inhabitants, flying from place to place, gave notice of\r\n    the proceedings to the Commandant Manoel Pereira da Silva, who\r\n    immediately collected a small force of twenty-six national\r\n    guards and countrymen, and setting out the following day, they\r\n    met near the place, Pedro Antonio crowned with a wreath of\r\n    flowering creepers, taken from his predecessor, and accompanied\r\n    by a group of men and women, who cried aloud—‘Come on, we\r\n    do not fear you, we shall be assisted by the troops of our\r\n    kingdom.’\r\n\r\n    “They then advanced upon them with the bludgeons and swords\r\n    they carried, killed five soldiers, and wounded five more;\r\n    but being briskly attacked, twenty-six men and three women\r\n    were instantly killed; and three men, nine women, and twelve\r\n    children were made prisoners. The remainder, many of whom were\r\n    wounded, fled to the woods. It was only on the evening of the\r\n    eighteenth, that I just had notice of these disturbances,\r\n    when I immediately got together forty men, and marched off at\r\n    the head of them, but on my arrival, I found every thing had\r\n    been quelled in the manner above related. The prisoners were\r\n    conducted by my troops to this town, and the twelve children\r\n    will be taken care off till the orders of your Excellency\r\n    arrive respecting them.\r\n\r\n    “God protect your Excellency.\r\n\r\n                                    “Francisco Barbosa Nogueira Paz.”\r\n\r\nThe district of Flores lies considerably to the south of the Villa do\r\nCrato, near the Rio de San Francisco, and in the province of Pernambuco.\r\nThe occurrence was much spoken of during my stay in the neighbourhood of\r\nCrato, and I have conversed with the relatives of some of those who fell\r\nvictims.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of December, a very heavy thunder-storm occurred at Barra do\r\nJardim, followed by about two hour’s rain, the first that had fallen that\r\nseason, and the same again happened on the 2nd of January, indicating\r\nthat the period of the rains was on the point of setting in; I observed\r\nthat in the confidence of this, the inhabitants had commenced their\r\nplantations of rice, and therefore lost no time in making my arrangements\r\nfor returning to Crato in order to prepare for my journey into Piauhy. My\r\ndeparture from Jardim was fixed for the 3rd, for which purpose my horses\r\nwere brought the night before from the pasturage and tied securely to\r\nsome orange trees, with abundance of fresh grass, on which they could\r\nfeed till morning, but at daybreak two of the animals had disappeared; at\r\nfirst, I was apprehensive they had been stolen, but I despatched Pedro\r\nin search of them, and was glad to see him return, bringing the missing\r\nhorses which had escaped to their old pasturage. Without any further\r\ndelay I therefore started about noon, after taking leave of my friends,\r\nand reached Crato the following day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nCRATO TO PIAUHY.\r\n\r\n    Preparations for the journey—Leaves Crato—Passes\r\n    Guaribas—Reaches Brejo grande—Discovers more fossil\r\n    fishes—Passes Olho d’Agoa do Inferno—Arrives at Poço\r\n    de Cavallo—Crauatá—Cachoeira—Marmeleira—Rosario—Os\r\n    defuntos—Lagoa—Varzea da Vaca—Angicas—Crosses the\r\n    boundary line of the province of Piauhy—Arrives at San\r\n    Gonsalvo—Campos—Lagoa Comprida—Difficulties of the Road—Reaches\r\n    Corumatá—Conabrava—Arrives at Boa Esperança, a large estate\r\n    owned by an excellent clergyman—Is now in the midst of the\r\n    great Cattle Districts—Nature of the Country described—Marked\r\n    into two Kinds, Mimoso and Agreste—Passes Santa Anna das\r\n    Mercês—San Antonio—Cachimbinho—Vegetation of the surrounding\r\n    Country—Reaches Retiro—Buquerão—Canavieira—Crosses the River\r\n    Canindé and arrives at Oeiras, the Capital of the Province of\r\n    Piauhy.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter my return to Crato, all my collections were despatched for the\r\ncoast by the 10th of January in order to be shipped for England, and I\r\nprepared every thing in readiness for our journey, which I was assured\r\nmight now be undertaken with safety, as it had rained nearly every day\r\nsince the beginning of the month. I was, however, prevented from leaving\r\nso soon as I had anticipated, owing to the necessity of dismissing my\r\nservant Pedro. He had now been about a year in my service, and as he\r\nwas intelligent and useful, and we had travelled together more like\r\ncompanions than master and man, and as he had moreover acted with great\r\nkindness and attention to me during several slight illnesses, I always\r\ntreated him with much indulgence, and certainly would not have parted\r\nwith him, had he not returned that indulgence with ingratitude. For some\r\ntime before this, he had conducted himself as if he imagined I could not\r\ndo without him. It was on a Saturday that I intended to leave Crato, and\r\non the morning of that day, I sent him to purchase several articles for\r\nour journey, but he did not return till two o’clock in the afternoon.\r\nBeing still desirous of starting, I told him to fetch the other men who\r\nwere to accompany us, and to bring the horses from the pasture; in reply,\r\nhe said that he would go for them, but that I might start with them\r\nmyself, as he did not intend to leave Crato till Monday; this being more\r\nthan I could reasonably bear, I instantly discharged him. Fortunately\r\nat this very moment, I had a visit from a young Englishman, Mr. Edward\r\nWalker, who had come up to Crato while I was at Barra do Jardim, to take\r\ncharge of a Rapadura Engenho in the absence of the owner, who, although\r\na man upwards of forty years of age, was about to proceed to the College\r\nof Olinda, in order to study for the church. During two years before\r\nthis, Mr. Walker had been travelling over the interior of Ceará, and in\r\nthe north of Piauhy, selling European goods, but about two months before\r\nhe came to Crato, he had been robbed of all he possessed, and had no\r\nother resource left than to accept of the situation he then held, so\r\nthat he might earn the means of enabling him to reach the coast. That\r\noccupation not being to his taste, he at once offered to accompany me\r\nas my assistant; I had therefore to purchase two additional horses for\r\nhim and his trunks, and as there was some difficulty in procuring such\r\nas would answer our purpose, it was not until the fifteenth of the month\r\nthat we could leave Crato. The day previous to my departure was occupied\r\nin taking leave of my good friend Capt. João Gonsalvez, his wife, and\r\ndaughter, and of my other friends.\r\n\r\nIt was four o’clock in the afternoon before we could start, and we passed\r\nthe night at an Engenho, called Guaribas, at the foot of the Serra de\r\nAraripe, its distance being about a league and a half westward of Crato.\r\nOn the following morning we resumed our journey soon after daybreak, and\r\nshortly afterwards ascended the Serra during a heavy shower of rain, over\r\na part considerably lower than that a few leagues to the eastward. The\r\nbreadth of the Serra here is about thirty miles, the first half was very\r\nsimilar to other parts of it which I had previously visited, being quite\r\nlevel and open, the vegetation consisting of rather large and thinly\r\nscattered trees, and in many parts covered with an abundance of low\r\nshrubs. The most common tree here was a fine species of _Vochysia_, which\r\nI had only met with sparingly before, and which has a fine appearance,\r\nfrom its dark green, shining leaves, and spikes of bright yellow flowers,\r\nwhich terminate the branchlets. The more westerly portion is very thickly\r\nwooded with small trees, large tracts of which are burned down every\r\nyear, to allow of a more abundant supply of herbage for the cattle and\r\nhorses which are sent here to pasture during the dry season. When about\r\nhalf way across, we halted under a tree to breakfast, having brought a\r\nlarge calabash full of water for the purpose of making tea, but we might\r\nhave saved this trouble as we found an abundant supply in the hollowed\r\nstump of a tree; it was found to be of good quality notwithstanding\r\nthat one or two frogs were swimming about in it. The western descent is\r\nvery gradual, and ends in a long narrow ravine, which leads into Brejo\r\nGrande, a large valley surrounded on all sides, except to the westward,\r\nby branches of the Serra. Towards the western extremity of this valley,\r\nwe arrived at the house of Colonel Manoel do Barros de Cavalcante; I had\r\nbeen requested by his son who lives in Crato, to visit him, as he had\r\nbeen very ill for several days. He is the chief person in this district,\r\nwhich is not very thickly populated, where he officiates as justice of\r\nthe peace (Juiz de Paz); on visiting him I soon found that he suffered\r\nfrom a severe attack of acute rheumatism, for which I bled him freely,\r\nand administered the usual remedies. In a marshy place near the head of\r\nthe valley of Brejo Grande, we passed a large group of beautiful palm,\r\nwhich I had met with in only a few instances below Crato, but which I\r\nafterwards saw in the greatest abundance in the swamps of Piauhy and\r\nGoyaz; it is called Buriti by the inhabitants, and is the _Mauritia\r\nvinifera_ of Martius. This palm is not only the most beautiful, but one\r\nof the loftiest in the country; the leaves are fan-shaped, and form\r\na large round ball at the top of the stem, after the manner of the\r\nCarnahuba. It produces a great number of nuts about the size of a small\r\negg, covered with rhomboidal scales arranged in a spiral manner; between\r\nthese scales and the albuminous substance of the nut, there exists an\r\noily pulp of a reddish colour, which the inhabitants of Crato boil with\r\nsugar and make into a sweet-meat. In Piauhy they prepare from this pulp\r\nan emulsion, which, when sweetened with sugar, forms a very palatable\r\nbeverage, but if much used, it is said to tinge the skin of a yellowish\r\ncolour. The juice of the stem also forms a very agreeable drink, but to\r\nobtain it, the tree must be cut down, when several holes about six inches\r\nsquare, three deep, and about six feet apart, are cut in the trunk with\r\na small axe, which in a short time become filled with a reddish coloured\r\nliquid, having much the flavour of sweet wine. During my travels in\r\nPiauhy, we used occasionally to cut down these palms in order to obtain\r\nthe juice.\r\n\r\nDuring the night it rained very heavily, and in the morning it was still\r\nso wet that we could not resume our journey; indeed, Colonel Barros\r\nstrongly recommended us to delay our departure till the following day,\r\nas the river to the west of his plantation would be much swollen by the\r\nrains; besides, the state of the road would not allow us to reach the\r\nplace where we proposed to remain for the night. In the afternoon I\r\nvisited another deposit of fossil fishes, about a mile distant from the\r\nhouse, being conducted by one of the colonel’s sons, a very intelligent\r\nyouth, and found it to be exactly similar to the others already\r\ndescribed; the few specimens here obtained did not differ from those\r\nfound on the eastern side. During this walk I met with a large species of\r\n_Jatropha_, which is frequent in the dry woods, and is known by the name\r\nof Manacóba; it forms a small tree from ten to twenty feet in height,\r\nand the roots, which are far more woody than those of the mandiocca, are\r\nin times of scarcity converted into farinha. The valley of Brejo Grande\r\nis chiefly planted with sugar cane, rice, and mandiocca, but only a very\r\nsmall part is yet under cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe weather having continued fine, I took my leave on the following\r\nmorning of Colonel Barros, whom I found considerably better. After\r\nexpressing himself deeply obliged to me for the relief I had given him,\r\nhe wished to make me some compensation, but as I would not accept money,\r\nhe insisted on my taking about half a bushel of rice, and a number of\r\nrapaduras, as an addition to our stock of provisions. About a league from\r\nhis house we passed through a small hamlet (povoacão) called Santa Anna,\r\nconsisting of about half a dozen houses and a small church. The road was\r\nvery good all the way, presenting, for the most part, a natural pavement\r\nin the shape of a horizontal bed of limestone in thin layers. After\r\ntravelling about four leagues, we reached a place called Olho d’Agoa\r\ndo Inferno, situated on a slightly elevated part of a narrow valley,\r\nand consisting of three or four houses. At this place we halted to take\r\nbreakfast under the shade of a huge Cassia tree, which was literally\r\ncovered with large panicles of golden blossoms. Like the first league of\r\nthis journey, the last was found to be very good, but the intermediate\r\ndistance passes through a flat country, where for nearly the whole way\r\nthe horses sank to their knees in water and mud. We crossed the river\r\nmentioned by Colonel Barros several times, and it was manifest by marks\r\nleft by the water on the banks, that it had been greatly flooded the\r\nday before; it was now not more than two feet deep. The lower portion\r\nof the country through which we passed is well wooded, the large trees\r\nconsisting chiefly of _Mimosas_ and _Erythrina_ covered with numerous\r\nbrilliant scarlet flowers, and the thick-stemmed Barriguda; some of\r\nthe latter are of great size, the singularly swollen portion of their\r\nstems measuring about twenty-four feet in circumference, while the\r\nupper and lower parts were not more than eight. The additions made to\r\nmy herbarium this day were numerous; one of the most beautiful being a\r\nshrubby species of _Allamanda_, about six feet high, bearing abundance of\r\nlarge violet-coloured flowers, not unlike those of _Gloxinia speciosa_,\r\nand which I have called _Allamanda violacea_, from the colour of its\r\nflowers, those of all other species being yellow; an infusion of the root\r\nof this shrub is a powerful purgative, and is chiefly used in malignant\r\nfevers. About Olho d’Agoa do Inferno grows in great plenty a new species\r\nof _Coutarea_, which bears large white flowers, and called by the\r\ninhabitants Quina Quina branca, from its bark having been found to be an\r\nexcellent remedy in cases of intermittent fevers, which greatly prevail\r\nin the marshy plains of the province of Piauhy. Almost every traveller\r\nwho goes into that province carries away a quantity of this bark, and I\r\nremarked that nearly all the trees by the road-side had large portions of\r\ntheir stems stripped in consequence.\r\n\r\nWe left Olho d’Agoa in the afternoon, and shortly afterwards entered\r\na country very similar to that between Icó and Crato, but as the rain\r\nhad been falling for nearly a month, everything was quite green. The\r\nrapidity with which vegetation advances in these deserts, after the first\r\nfew showers, is quite astonishing; the annual grasses spring up through\r\nthe white sand, the trees burst into leaf and bloom, and the perennial\r\nherbaceous plants, which during the drought were apparently destroyed,\r\nthrow up their flowering stems in an incredibly short period. In crossing\r\na small stream on this journey I observed the rock, forming its bed,\r\nto consist of gneiss, cropping out towards the west; beyond this place\r\nsandstone again made its appearance, but scattered over it are an immense\r\nnumber of large angular blocks of gneiss. After travelling three leagues,\r\nwe reached a place called Poço do Cavallo, and put up for the night at\r\nan unfinished house, which, though roofed over, was open at the sides.\r\nBesides ourselves two other travelling parties had also taken up their\r\nquarters here. In a marsh near us a whole legion of frogs were holding\r\ntheir nightly concert, and so loud was their noise, that I found some\r\ndifficulty in going to sleep. Shortly before reaching this place, I\r\ncollected specimens of a fine large tree which I afterwards found to be\r\nvery common in the district; it belongs to the natural order _Meliaceæ_,\r\nand is called by the Brazilians Cedro, from the wood resembling both in\r\ncolour and smell that of the true Cedar; the wood is very much used for\r\nmaking doors, tables, and various articles of furniture. The leaves and\r\nflowers possessed so strongly the odour of garlick, that the atmosphere\r\nwas rendered disagreeable to breathe. The pastures for our horses were\r\nnow excellent, the new grass being from four to six inches high, and very\r\nabundant. To the botanist it was quite delightful to travel through\r\nsuch a country, for nearly at every footstep something new and beautiful\r\nwas added to my collections; the only drawback was the difficulty of\r\npreserving the specimens, owing to the great humidity of the atmosphere,\r\nand the want of proper means of drying the paper, as the sun now seldom\r\nshone out brightly.\r\n\r\nThe following morning set in with rain, but we resumed our journey\r\nabout seven o’clock, when it cleared up; we had not, however, gone far\r\nwhen the rain began again to fall heavily, which, notwithstanding the\r\nprotection from my umbrella, soon drenched me to the skin; we were\r\nobliged to travel two leagues before reaching any house, so thinly is\r\nthis country inhabited. The place we arrived at was called Crauatá,\r\nconsisting of only three very small houses, and as the rain continued\r\nwithout intermission, we determined to stay, if possible, in one of them\r\nduring the remainder of the day; but we found only one room could be\r\nspared, which was so very small, that it would not contain more than my\r\nluggage, much less our party, which now consisted of four persons; our\r\nonly remedy, therefore, was to go on in the midst of the rain to a place\r\ncalled Cachoeira, about a league distant. On our arrival here we found\r\nit consisting of four houses, all, with the exception of one where we\r\nobtained leave to put up, similar to those at Crauatá. This belonged to a\r\nperson who had resided four or five years in Philadelphia, about eighteen\r\nyears previously, and who still spoke a little English; on finding we\r\nwere Englishmen, he gave us a hearty welcome, and all the accommodation\r\nhis house afforded, doing all in his power to render us as comfortable as\r\npossible; shortly after our arrival the rain fell in torrents, so much\r\nso, that a small rivulet which we crossed immediately before reaching the\r\nhouse, soon became impassable for horses, and had we been detained one\r\nhour later, we should have been obliged to remain on the opposite side\r\nwithout shelter. The rain ceased at four o’clock in the afternoon, but\r\nthe very loud thunder which accompanied it continued nearly the whole\r\nday. The road from Poço do Cavallo to Cachoeira passes through an almost\r\nlevel country; many parts of which are well wooded with large trees,\r\nthe most common being a species of _Cæsalpinia_, some large _Mimosas_,\r\nthe Cedro, the Barriguda, and another kind which is very common, though\r\nnot so large, called by the inhabitants Imbúzeiro; it is the _Spondius\r\ntuberosa_, Arrud., producing abundantly a fruit about twice the size of\r\na large gooseberry, of an oblong shape, and of a yellowish colour when\r\nripe; beneath its coriaceous skin there is a juicy pulp, of a pleasant\r\nsweetish acid taste. Like the Mangába this fruit is only fit to eat when\r\nit is so ripe as to fall to the ground, when a large quantity may be\r\neaten without inconvenience; during our journey to the Campo country of\r\nPiauhy, where it ceases to grow, we were seldom without a daily supply of\r\nit; a dish much esteemed in the Sertão, called Imbuzada, is prepared with\r\nmilk, curds, sugar, and the pulpy part of this fruit. The tree throws\r\nout long horizontal roots, which do not penetrate very deeply into the\r\nearth, and upon these are found, at short distances, round black-coloured\r\ntubers about eight inches in diameter, consisting entirely of a white\r\ncellular substance which is full of water; these, which are evidently\r\nintended by nature to supply the vegetation of the tree during the dry\r\nseason, are often dug out by travellers for the sake of the water they\r\ncontain, each tuber yielding about a pint of excellent quality. Another\r\nwild fruit common here, as it is also about Crato and Pernambuco, is\r\nproduced by a tree growing to the height of from thirty to forty feet,\r\ncalled Pitombeira; it is the _Sapindus esculentus_, St. Hil.; the fruit\r\nis produced in large bunches, resembling in size the common grape; the\r\nouter covering is hard, but the embryo, or kernel, is covered with a\r\nthin transparent, sweetish, acid pulp, which alone is eaten; the kernels\r\nare said to poison turkeys if eaten by them. Next day, the twentieth of\r\nJanuary, we left Cachoeira, early in the morning, and after travelling\r\nabout five leagues we arrived at a Fazenda, called Marmeleira, where we\r\nrested during the middle of the day. Shortly after leaving Cachoeira we\r\nbegan to ascend a small Serra, by a very gradual inclination, but owing\r\nto its rocky nature the road was very bad in many places. This range\r\nconsists of gneiss, the stratification of which is nearly vertical; large\r\nblocks of the same kind of rock were very commonly seen along the road,\r\nbut on the ascent of a small hill I observed many round blocks of a\r\ncoarse whitish-sandstone. On the journey we crossed several rivers, which\r\nalthough very small, or wholly dried up in the arid season, were now so\r\nmuch swollen by the recent rains, that we could with difficulty pass some\r\nof them. After crossing the Serra we entered a fine valley about a league\r\nin length, well wooded with large trees, and having a small river running\r\nthrough the centre of it; the end to the westward was pretty well cleared\r\nof trees, and there is a little hamlet called Rosario, beyond which we\r\nhad nearly half a league to travel before reaching our resting-place.\r\nOn this journey were found several new species of the beautiful genus\r\n_Angelonia_, one of the most remarkable being a fine climbing shrubby\r\nspecies (_A. bracteata_, Benth.); on dry rocky places I observed several\r\nkinds of _Cactus_, which are not so common on the western side as they\r\nare on the east of the Serra de Ibiapaba. The genus _Loasa_, so very\r\ncommon in Chili and Peru, has only few representatives in Brazil; one\r\nwhich I have called _Loasa rupestris_, was found here in rocky places by\r\nthe side of a stream just before we reached our resting-place; like other\r\nspecies of this genus, the whole plant stings very powerfully, and hence,\r\nin common with other stinging plants, it is called by the inhabitants\r\nCançançao. As the sun shone out brightly during our stay at Marmeleira,\r\nwe were enabled to dry all our clothes and other things that had been\r\nsoaked by the rains. Here I prescribed for the mistress of the house,\r\nwho was in a very delicate state of health; in return for this we were\r\nabundantly supplied with milk, which at this season is plentiful. In the\r\nafternoon we travelled three leagues further, and towards dusk arrived at\r\na place consisting of a few small houses called Os Defuntos, near which\r\nis a marsh abounding with frogs; the loud and disagreeable sounds they\r\nproduced could only be compared to the half-howling, half-barking noise\r\nof a large kennel of hungry dogs. On some trees near the marsh several\r\nlarge owls were seen, attracted no doubt by the frogs, which they are\r\nsaid to destroy in great numbers for food.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning after travelling about five leagues through\r\na level and rather open country, we arrived at a place called Varzea\r\nda vaca; when about a league beyond Os Defuntos, we passed a fazenda\r\ncalled Lagoa, belonging to Senhor José Pereira de Hollanda, the person\r\nwho without leave took the loan of my horse during my stay in Crato. His\r\nplace derives its name from a lake in the vicinity of the house, which\r\nis much frequented by wild duck and other water-fowl. Before reaching\r\nVarzea da vaca, we passed several other fazendas, where large herds of\r\ncattle were seen grazing in the open Campos. Varzea da vaca is a hamlet\r\nconsisting of about eight houses, but within the district that bears\r\nthat name, they reckon about sixty; the residents are almost all cattle\r\nfarmers, some of the poorer families only possessing half a dozen head,\r\nwhilst others own upwards of a hundred; they also have small plantations\r\nof Indian corn, rice, mandiocca, and french beans. The inhabitants of the\r\nhouse in which I was to put up, appeared to be very poor; the building\r\nwas small and very ill-constructed, having only a large opening in one\r\nside, that served for entrance, without any door to keep out either\r\nwind or rain; it consisted of only two apartments, the inner one being\r\noccupied by the family, the other one by my party and that of another\r\ntraveller who also remained here for the night, which proved to be\r\nstormy; in order to shelter ourselves from the wind which blew in at the\r\ndoor, I was obliged to hang before it one of the large skins used to\r\ncover the loads on the horses. In the afternoon I shot several birds, and\r\nalso met with some curious annual plants which had sprung up in the sandy\r\nCampos.\r\n\r\nLeaving Varzea de vaca about seven o’clock on the following morning, and\r\ntravelling about two leagues, we halted at a fazenda called Angicas;\r\nI intended to proceed further without stopping, but as it was raining\r\nvery heavily I remained here till the afternoon, when the weather having\r\ncleared up, we went on two leagues further to San Gonsalvo, which we\r\nreached about sunset. The country between Varzea da vaca and Angicas is\r\nflat and sandy, being one of those tracts called Taboleiras; in some\r\nplaces it is covered with a low shrubby vegetation, while in others are\r\nseen numerous large kinds of _Cactus_. Among the many beautiful plants\r\nmet with on this journey, was one particularly worthy of notice: it is a\r\nspecies of _Echites_,[8] growing abundantly on the open sandy places; it\r\nis not more than six inches high, with subulate leaves and pink-coloured\r\nblossoms not unlike those of _Phlox subulata_; it is called by the\r\ninhabitants of the Sertão, Cauhy, and the tuberous root, which is the\r\nsize and colour of a large black turnip-radish, is eaten by them when\r\ncooked, and is said to be very palatable; in the raw state it tastes\r\nnot unlike a turnip. This root is also a favourite food of the peccary\r\n(_Dycoteles torquatus_, Cuv.), which is very expert at digging them up\r\nwith its snout, the sand being in many places full of the holes they had\r\nmade for that purpose. About half a league beyond Angicas, a small lake\r\nis seen, which forms the boundary between the provinces of Ceará and\r\nPiauhy. There are two houses at San Gonsalvo both belonging to cattle\r\nfarmers, father and son; at the end of the last rains they possessed\r\nconjointly about three hundred head of cattle, but the severe drought\r\nthat occurred previous to the setting in of the present rainy season, had\r\nleft them only about forty, all the remainder having perished from the\r\nwant of water and grass.\r\n\r\nNext morning after travelling three leagues and a half through a rather\r\nlevel and tolerably well-wooded country, we arrived towards mid-day at a\r\nplace consisting of three houses called Campos; the tree most abundant on\r\nthe road was the Imbuzeira, the fruit of which, called Imbú, was observed\r\nin such great plenty that the ground beneath them was completely yellow;\r\nwe ate abundantly of it, and found it very grateful. About a league from\r\nCampos the country abounds with an arboreous species of _Jatropha_, with\r\nsmall white flowers, and sinuate leaves not unlike those of the holly,\r\nonly larger; the footstalks of the leaves are furnished with a few long\r\npointed prickles, and without being aware of their nature, I laid hold\r\nof a branch to collect a few specimens, but had no sooner done so than\r\nmy whole hand felt as if it had been dipped into boiling oil, caused by\r\nthe venom of the prickles which in many places had punctured the skin,\r\nand it was intolerably painful for several hours; on my next attempt I\r\nwas more cautious, and succeeded in obtaining a few specimens. This plant\r\nis called by the inhabitants Favella, and in the dry season they scrape\r\ndown the bark and the wood, which they put into the pools where the large\r\npigeons and other birds resort; after having drunk of this poisoned\r\nwater they either die or become very much stupified, and in this state\r\nare taken and eaten by the people. On this journey we saw a great many\r\nMaccaws (_Araras_) but they would not allow me to come within shot of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we made another journey of about a league and a half,\r\nthrough a flat sandy country, which yielded me several novelties, and\r\nremained for the night at a large cattle fazenda, called Lagoa Comprida.\r\nThis house was one of the largest we had seen since leaving Brejo Grande;\r\nit is situated on the margin of a lake about four hundred yards long,\r\nfrom which it takes its name; no rivulet empties itself into the lake,\r\nwhich becomes filled during the rainy season, and if the rains have been\r\nheavy, it does not dry up before the next wet season. By the proprietor I\r\nwas informed, that on the previous year very little rain fell, and that\r\nin consequence of this, and of the very great drought afterwards, the\r\nlake dried up before the setting in of the present rains, the result of\r\nwhich was the death of nearly all the cattle belonging to the fazenda.\r\nThe people were still in an almost starving state, and although both\r\nat Campos and here I endeavoured to purchase some provisions for our\r\nown use, nothing was to be had, neither fowls, sheep, goats, pigs, nor\r\nbeef; money I found to be of no use. Our next stage was one of three\r\nleagues, and brought us to another fazenda, called Corumatá. The country\r\nwas undulating but not hilly, and in many places it was covered with\r\nimmense blocks of granite; so large and square are some of these blocks,\r\nthat at a distance we mistook a cluster of them for a large village.\r\nTwo circumstances occurred to detain us a long time on the road. Having\r\ndismounted to collect some specimens, my horse ran off into the woods,\r\nand it was nearly an hour before he could be taken; and a little further\r\non, in passing over a sandy piece of ground abounding in ant-hills, the\r\nroad gave way while a loaded horse was passing over one of their large\r\nexcavations, and as he was more than half-buried in the sand, it was a\r\nlong time before we could extricate him. Shortly afterwards, we descended\r\nby an exceedingly bad road, consisting of large blocks of granite, into\r\na valley through which a small river runs, immediately after crossing\r\nwhich we arrived at Corumatá. The owner of this farm does not reside on\r\nit, the charge of it being given to a cowherd (vaqueiro). Here again we\r\ncould obtain nothing to purchase, but the vaqueiro presented me with a\r\nsmall piece of dried beef, and abundance of excellent milk; the fazenda,\r\nhe told me, produces yearly about two hundred calves; the cattle go at\r\nlarge in the woods and fields, but at this season, which is the one in\r\nwhich the calves are produced, the vaqueiro and his assistants, who\r\nare generally slaves, are constantly on the look out for such as may\r\nhave calved. The calves are then brought to the house, and put into a\r\nlarge enclosure called a curral, and as a matter of course the mother\r\nfollows. In this enclosure the cows and the calves are shut up together\r\nat night, but during the day, the cows are turned out to feed; this\r\nis a very necessary precaution in such a wild country, to prevent the\r\nmothers straying into the woods; a little milk is taken from each cow\r\nin the morning before being turned out, at night they are not milked at\r\nall; of part of the milk they make a soft kind of cheese, which is much\r\nrelished by all classes of society. They had not commenced making it here\r\ngenerally, but in the evening, one of the herds came to offer a large one\r\nfor sale, which I was glad to purchase for the sake of my men. Shortly\r\nafter we arrived at this place, a tremendous thunder-storm passed over\r\nus from the westward, followed by torrents of rain, and in a short time\r\nthe small river became so much swollen as to be impassable; as the road\r\nto Canabrava, our next stage, passed over this stream, we were obliged to\r\nremain here till the following afternoon, when, on attempting to cross\r\nit, we found it still so deep, that all the loads had to be taken off\r\nthe horses, and carried over on the heads of the men. Here a curious\r\nnatural object presents itself: on a bare conical-shaped hill about 800\r\nfeet high, being the termination of a ridge, called Serra Grande, there\r\nis a stone of immense size placed on the top of another much smaller,\r\nand the point on which it rests appears to be so small, that one is led\r\nto think that a very slight breeze would upset it. Keeping along the\r\nmargin of the river, we arrived towards sunset at a place where the road\r\ncrosses it twice, occasioned by a sudden bend, but we were informed at\r\nCorumatá, that there was a bye-path in the woods, which would render this\r\nunnecessary. It was now night, and although the moon shone very brightly,\r\nwe had some difficulty in finding this path; when we did, it was so much\r\novergrown with bushes, from being little frequented, that we had much\r\nlabour in driving the horses along it with the loads. After toiling about\r\nan hour in this labyrinth, much to our joy we reached the road leading\r\nfrom the river to the fazenda of Canabrava, where we arrived in about a\r\nquarter of an hour. This is a very large fazenda, and when we asked for\r\naccommodation to pass the night, we were shown to an old shed, the roof\r\nof which, in many places, was much decayed; as soon, however, as the\r\nproprietor learned from my men who I was, he invited me into the house,\r\nand prepared an excellent supper, of which we partook with much relish.\r\n\r\nAs we left Canabrava early next morning, we expected to reach our next\r\nstage, Boa Esperança, about eleven o’clock in the forenoon, but in this\r\nanticipation we were sadly disappointed. The river runs in a zigzag\r\ndirection along a valley which stretches between these two places, and\r\nas the road passes through the centre, we had to cross the stream no\r\nless than eight times in this short distance, although a road might\r\nbe made with very little labour, to avoid the river altogether. It is\r\nseldom, however, that travellers are annoyed so much as we were, for\r\nduring the arid season the bed of the river is altogether dry. In four\r\nof the passages it was necessary to take all the loads off the horses,\r\nand carry them across on the heads of the men, but in the others, we\r\nmanaged to avoid this trouble, with the exception of the bundles of\r\npaper containing specimens, which I always caused to be carried over by\r\none of the men. As we were all obliged to assist in this work, we were\r\nexposed during the greater part of the day to the burning rays of the\r\nsun, nearly in a state of nudity. My legs were very much burned, as were\r\nthose of Mr. Walker, so much so, that on the following day they were\r\ncompletely blistered, and so greatly swollen that I was laid up for\r\nnearly two days. This taught me a lesson to be more cautious in future;\r\nbut on this occasion, I thought that as the blacks did not hesitate to\r\nexpose themselves to the sun, I might do so also; their skin, however,\r\nI found to my cost, was made of tougher material than mine. By the time\r\nwe had crossed the river, for the eighth and last time, it was about\r\nfive o’clock in the afternoon, and in ten minutes after, we arrived at\r\nthe fazenda of Boa Esperança, in an almost exhausted state, from the\r\nexcessive fatigues of the day. We were cheered, however, by the kind\r\nreception we received from its excellent and learned proprietor, the\r\nReverend Padre Marcos de Araujo Costa, and his adopted son Dr. Marcos de\r\nMacedo, who had only a short time before returned from a visit to France\r\nand England, whither he had been sent at the expense of the Government\r\nto study the manufacture of porcelain, and whose acquaintance I had made\r\na few weeks before at Crato, his native place. On this journey I added\r\nbut little to my botanical collections, but in a moist meadow by the side\r\nof the river, I killed a beautiful boa constrictor, about seven feet\r\nlong. Although these reptiles are frequently met with in the dry country,\r\ncalled the Sertão, they are neither so numerous nor so large as those\r\nfound in the swampy plains of Piauhy and Goyaz.\r\n\r\nThe fazenda of Boa Esperança is one of the largest I had yet visited in\r\nBrazil, giving pasture to upwards of 5,000 head of cattle, and several\r\nhundred sheep. Although like all others in the Sertão, it is occasionally\r\nexposed to long droughts, yet there is an abundant supply of water all\r\nthe year round, even should no rain fall for more than twelve months.\r\nThe river passes at a little distance from the house, and although it\r\nonly contains water in the wet season, an abundant supply is obtained at\r\nall times, by means of a high and very strong dam thrown across it at a\r\nplace where its banks are somewhat high, and rocky on each side. This\r\ndam, notwithstanding that it has been built more than fifty years, is\r\nstill as effective as when first constructed, a circumstance not a little\r\nastonishing in a country like Brazil, where works of this nature are\r\nin general so badly executed. The house is built on a slight eminence,\r\nand as there are about thirty smaller houses behind it belonging to the\r\nslaves, the place has all the appearance of a small village; near the\r\nhouse the Padre has erected a neat chapel, in which he says mass every\r\nmorning to his people.\r\n\r\nThe country in which this fazenda is situated, (as indeed, the whole\r\nof the eastern portion of Piauhy, and nearly the whole of the province\r\nof Ceará) is called by the inhabitants of the Sertão, Mimoso, in\r\ncontradistinction to the central and western portions of Piauhy, to which\r\nthe term Agreste is applied. The vegetation of the Campos Mimosos is\r\ncharacterized in the first place, by the forests being of that nature\r\ncalled Catinga; these are the forests which I have already spoken of as\r\nlosing their leaves in the dry season; it is remarkable that they form\r\nbuds like other deciduous trees, but should no rain fall they can remain\r\nfor several years without producing foliage. In the second place, as has\r\nbeen very correctly remarked by Von Martius, the general vegetation of\r\nthe Campos Mimosos is distinguished by the tenderness of fibre, rigidity\r\nof leaves, the presence of hairs, stings, or prickles, small flowers,\r\nand thick and frequent milky juice. The grasses of the pastures are for\r\nthe most part annual, and generally of a brighter green colour, and have\r\nmore tender and pliant leaves than those of the Campos Agrestes, of which\r\nI shall hereafter speak. The cattle reared in the Mimoso country very\r\nsoon get fat after the rains have set in, and their flesh is much more\r\nesteemed than that of those which have been fed on the coarse pastures of\r\nthe Agreste districts.\r\n\r\nPadre Marcos de Araujo Costa is well known throughout the north of\r\nBrazil, not only for his intelligence and learning, but for his excellent\r\nmoral character and benevolent disposition; and during the eight days\r\nthat I lived in his house I had ample opportunities of verifying the\r\ntruth of these accounts. If all the priests in the country were only\r\nhalf as active, well-informed, and as anxious for the diffusion of\r\neducation as he is, the condition of Brazil would soon become very\r\ndifferent from what it now is, and what I fear it will long continue to\r\nbe, in the present state of things: the activity of this old man, for he\r\nwas then upwards of sixty years of age, was quite surprising, and his\r\nphilanthropy was not less so. As the means of education in this large and\r\nthinly-populated country come only within the reach of a very few, he has\r\nregularly for many years past been in the habit of boarding and educating\r\nin his house, free of expense, twenty boys, till they have acquired a\r\ntolerable knowledge of the Latin language, and the elements of philosophy\r\nand mathematics; he is himself an excellent scholar, and possesses a\r\npretty extensive library of classical and philosophical books; of botany\r\nand natural history he knew enough to render these subjects an amusement\r\nto him; in his library I found nearly all the works of Linnæus, those\r\nof Brotero, and the rare one of Vandelli on the plants of Portugal and\r\nBrazil, which latter he kindly presented to me. He holds no living in the\r\nchurch, contenting himself with the quiet and retired life of a cattle\r\nfarmer, and devoting his leisure hours to the education of his pupils.\r\nDuring my stay at Boa Esperança I made several short excursions in the\r\nneighbourhood, accompanied by the old Padre and Dr. Marcos de Macedo, and\r\nadded many novelties to my collections.\r\n\r\nTwo days before we left, Senhor Francisco de Souza Martins, one of the\r\ndeputies from the province of Piauhy, and nephew to the President of\r\nthe province, arrived on his way to Rio de Janeiro, accompanied by his\r\nbrother Major Clementino Martins. They came by way of San Bento, which is\r\nthe first stage from this place on the road to Oeiras, the capital of the\r\nprovince. This was our proposed route, but they gave us so bad an account\r\nof the roads, in consequence of the swelling of the rivulets, that I\r\ndetermined by their advice, to take a different road, which though more\r\ncircuitous was said to be much better. The Major and one of the blacks\r\nwho accompanied him, were laid up with the ague from continued exposure\r\nto the rains.\r\n\r\nOn the third of March we made preparations for leaving the residence\r\nof the good old Padre. During our stay we fared most sumptuously, as\r\nevery day in the year a fat ox is killed for his use and that of his\r\nestablishment; a day or two before our departure one was killed, and\r\nthe flesh dried for our use on the journey, so that with other presents\r\nI received from him, our provision boxes were so well filled that we\r\nrequired little in addition till we reached the city of Oeiras.\r\n\r\nAfter an early breakfast I parted with my kind host, who on account of\r\nhis other visitors did not accompany me far, but Dr. Marcos rode with me\r\nfor upwards of a league and a half, when we parted with mutual regret,\r\nit being so seldom that one who has a taste for the study of nature,\r\nmeets with a kindred spirit in those distant regions; since my return to\r\nEngland we have kept up a correspondence, and he has sent me specimens of\r\nobjects in natural history, many of which are different from those which\r\nmy limited stay enabled me to obtain. At the very outset of our journey,\r\nwe met with an accident that did not give us a very favourable idea of\r\nthe state of the road. At about two leagues from Boa Esperança, three of\r\nthe cargo horses plunged up to the middle in a swamp; the surface was\r\ncovered with grass, and appeared perfectly solid, but the soil beneath\r\nhad become so saturated with water, that it was quite a mass of tenacious\r\nmud. It was with no small difficulty that the animals were extricated;\r\nin leading them across they often sank again; all the loads had to be\r\ncarried over, and as we had to lend a hand at this work, we shared the\r\nsame fate as the horses, being frequently up to the middle in the mud.\r\nThese spots are called Atoleiras by the Brazilians, and are very much\r\ndreaded, as horses are occasionally lost in them; during the day we had\r\nto pass three more quagmires, but none so bad as the first.\r\n\r\nOur first stage from Boa Esperança was the Villa de Santa Anna das\r\nMercês, and when about two leagues from it, we halted under the shade of\r\nan Imbuzeira to dine and to give the horses a rest. The dry rocky places\r\nin this neighbourhood were covered with a little gregarious _Melocactus_,\r\nbearing very long recurved spines, and in a moist sandy place I found\r\nmany pretty annual plants. About sunset we came in sight of the Villa,\r\nwhich is situated on a slight eminence; on entering it, we put up for\r\nthe night in a large unfinished house belonging to the Padre Marcos\r\nof Boa Esperança, but we were glad to retreat from it as quickly as\r\npossible, for it was so full of fleas that we were completely covered\r\nwith them, nor was it till a large fire had been kindled in the middle\r\nof the floor, that the place became at all bearable. As both Mr. Walker\r\nand I had on very long boots, we suffered much less than the blacks whose\r\nlegs, from the knees downwards, were bare: I observed that when they were\r\nkindling the fire they would hold first one leg and then the other over\r\nthe flame, and with their two hands stroke them downwards to get rid of\r\nthese annoying creatures. In other places in Brazil I have met with these\r\ninsects in abundance in houses which have been shut up for some time,\r\nbut never did I see them so numerous as they were here; to escape their\r\nattacks during the night, we were obliged to sling our hammocks very\r\nhigh, and to undress on the top of a table.\r\n\r\nThe Villa de Santa Anna das Mercês, or as it is more commonly called\r\nJaicóz, is situated about five leagues to the west of Boa Esperança, and\r\ncontains about seventy or eighty houses built in the form of a large\r\nsquare, but only three sides of it were then completed; in the centre\r\nof this square there is a very handsome small church. The outskirts of\r\nthe town contain many huts belonging to the poorer classes, chiefly\r\nconstructed of the stems and leaves of the Carnahuba palm, which grows\r\nabundantly in the neighbourhood; a few shopkeepers and tradesmen, such\r\nas tailors, shoe-makers, &c., reside constantly in the town, but the\r\ngreater number of the houses belong to the neighbouring fazendeiros,\r\nwho only occupy them during the Christmas and other festivals. Shortly\r\nafter leaving the Villa, on the following morning, we ascended a low\r\nSerra which runs past the northern end of it; like almost all the other\r\nSerras which exist in the north of Brazil it is quite level on the top;\r\nit consists entirely of a coarse white sandstone very full of rounded\r\nquartz pebbles; the latter are also very abundant to a great distance\r\nround the Villa, and in many places the roads have the appearance of\r\nhaving been gravelled with them. The breadth of this Serra at the place\r\nwhere we crossed it, is about a league and a half; and it is principally\r\ncovered with low _Mimosas_ and _Croton_, which in many places grow so\r\nthickly together as to be almost impenetrable. The few open tracts which\r\nexist on it afford good pasture during the rains. After descending from\r\nthis Taboleira, we entered a flat well-wooded country, and having twice\r\ncrossed a small river which was considerably swollen, we arrived at the\r\nfazenda of St. Antonio early in the afternoon; the distance we travelled\r\nwas only three leagues, but as the next stage was said to be long, and as\r\nthe accounts we received of the state of the roads were bad, we remained\r\nat this place till the following morning. The fazenda of St. Antonio is\r\nsmall, its stock of cattle yielding only about one hundred and fifty\r\ncalves per annum; many of them, as well as of the full grown cattle, the\r\nowner informed me, fell victims to the Ounces which are not uncommon in\r\nthe neighbourhood. About three months previously he killed a large black\r\none, and the skin and head which he had preserved, showed it to have been\r\nan animal of great size and power. This head, as well as those of several\r\nothers, which from time he had destroyed, were stuck up on the tops of\r\ntall posts near the entrance to his curral.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak on the following morning we left St. Antonio, and after a\r\njourney of six long leagues reached a little hamlet called Cachimbinho;\r\nthe country between the two places is nearly level, and the road one\r\nof the worst on which we had yet travelled. The river we forded on the\r\nprevious day runs to the westward in a zigzag direction, and the road\r\ncrosses it no less than twenty-seven times, on which occasions, owing to\r\nthe depth of the water, the loads had to be taken off the horses, and\r\ncarried over on the heads of the men; we had also to cross several small\r\nlakes through which the road passes, and having the mortification to lose\r\nour way, it cost us much additional trouble to regain the right track.\r\n\r\nShortly after leaving San Antonio we passed through a forest of Carnahuba\r\npalms, in which were several large lakes, which contain water only in the\r\ndry season. On the margin of one of these we saw a number of water-fowl,\r\ncalled by the inhabitants Jabirú (_Mycteria Americana_, Linn.); these\r\nbirds, which are nearly related to the adjutants of India, are of\r\nimmense size; they are of a white colour, with the exception of the head,\r\nneck, beak, and feet, which are black; the black skin investing the head\r\nand neck is destitute of feathers. We afterwards met with them in much\r\ngreater abundance by the margins of streams and lakes, where they feed\r\nupon small reptiles, fishes, &c. The vegetation of the other parts of\r\nthe country through which we passed was principally virgin forest, with\r\nan underwood of _Croton Bauhinia_ and trailing _Mimosa_. Near a fazenda\r\ncalled Ambrosia, the road led under some large trees, on one of which\r\nI observed some hundreds of Marmoset monkeys. One of these I shot for\r\na specimen; it fell before it was quite dead, and its pitiable screams\r\nbrought back all its companions to the tree from which they had fled\r\nwhen I fired; here they remained for about ten minutes, when the cries\r\nof the wounded one having ceased, they left, and soon disappeared among\r\nthe branches of the other trees of the forest; it was impossible not to\r\nadmire the graceful activity they displayed in passing from tree to tree,\r\nand from bough to bough.\r\n\r\nOn the following day we travelled about five leagues, and shortly after\r\nmid-day arrived at a fazenda called Retiro. The two first leagues led\r\nthrough a virgin forest, consisting almost entirely of a kind of _Mimosa_\r\ncalled Angica, (the bark of which is used all over the Sertão for tanning\r\nleather, and a gum which it exudes is said to form the principal food of\r\nthe Marmoset monkey,) a _Zizyphus_ (Joazeira), and a few large species\r\nof _Bignonia_, with an underwood of _Croton_, _Bauhinia_, _Lautana_,\r\n_Myrtles_, &c. The road continued quite level, and we frequently passed\r\nthe same stream we crossed the day before, without the necessity of\r\nremoving the loads. Leaving this forest tract we entered one more open,\r\nand abounding in Carnahubas; in many places the soil was very sandy, and\r\nscant of herbaceous vegetation. At about three leagues from Cachimbinho\r\nwe passed through a small hamlet called Samambaia, consisting of about\r\ntwenty scattered houses. The principal occupation of the inhabitants is\r\nthe manufacture of hammocks, which are sold chiefly to travellers who\r\npass this way. They are made of cotton, which grows very well in the\r\nneighbourhood. From Samambaia the country still continues very flat\r\ntill within a short distance of Retiro, when it becomes more undulating,\r\nexhibiting several ridges of limestone, nearly bare of vegetation, or of\r\na fine red sandstone, which lies beneath the limestone, full of nodules\r\nof iron-stone, which from the wearing away of the rock are thickly strewn\r\nover the surface; they are of all sizes, from very minute particles to\r\nrounded blocks as large as two fists; they are of a black, or very dark\r\nbrown colour, assume a variety of shapes, and, judging from their weight,\r\nare rich in iron.\r\n\r\nThe fazenda of Retiro stands on a rising ground on the banks of the Rio\r\ndas Guaribas, which was one of the largest we had yet encountered, but\r\nfrom the recent dry weather, the water was so low, that on the following\r\nmorning we crossed it without difficulty; its banks exhibited signs of\r\nhaving but a short time before been very much flooded. A journey of two\r\nleagues brought us to a fazenda called Buquerão, where in consequence of\r\nrain we remained till the following morning, when continuing our route\r\nthrough a generally flat country, but full of isolated rocky hills,\r\ncontaining few trees, and a very scanty herbaceous vegetation, we arrived\r\nat the fazenda of Canabrava, after travelling about four leagues. This\r\nestate belongs to Colonel Martins, the father of the two gentlemen whom\r\nwe met at Boa Esperança, and brother to the Barão de Parnahiba, the\r\nPresident of the Province of Piauhy. As I carried letters of introduction\r\nto him from Padre Marcos, I was received with the greatest politeness and\r\nhospitality; here we remained for the night, and the following morning\r\nwere not allowed to leave till we had partaken of a breakfast of coffee,\r\nwhich the Colonel told us was an excellent preventive for ague, which is\r\nvery common at this season, in the country we were now about to enter.\r\nThe old man was in deep grief at the loss of one of his sons, who but a\r\nshort time before had died suddenly at his fazenda, about twenty-four\r\nleagues distant. As several roads led off in various directions a little\r\nbeyond the house, he kindly sent a black boy to put us in the right path.\r\nA journey of about five leagues and a half, through a beautiful grassy\r\ncountry abounding in herds of fine cattle, brought us to a plantation\r\ncalled Canavieira, belonging to a Major Clementino Martins, whom we met\r\nat Boa Esperança; we saw here a large field of sugar-cane, being the\r\nfirst we had met with since we left Brejo Grande. As the Major never\r\nresides at this place, the house is a very poor one, and in a very ruined\r\ncondition; we were obliged to take up our quarters in a sort of shed,\r\nwhich formed a great contrast to the comfortable lodgings we had enjoyed\r\nthe night before. A day or two afterwards, we found in consequence of\r\nsleeping in this hut, that a number of those little insects called\r\nchigoes (_Pulex penetrans_, Linn.) had got into our feet: they are only\r\nfound near dwellings, and are met with in all parts of the country\r\nI visited, from the sea-coast to the high mountains in the Diamond\r\ndistrict. They burrow under the skin to produce their young, the insect\r\nitself dying; they are at first easily detected, by the not unpleasant\r\ntickling sensation they produce in entering the skin, and of course are\r\neasily removed by a pin or the point of a pen-knife. When they have\r\nreached maturity, the abdomen becomes a bag about the size of a small\r\npea, full of eggs, of a yellow colour, and the spot looks like a fester.\r\nUnless this bag and its contents are carefully removed, a bad sore may be\r\nproduced; the feet of careless blacks not unfrequently get into so bad\r\na state from neglecting to remove these insects, that amputation of the\r\npart becomes necessary.\r\n\r\nOn this journey I made numerous new and beautiful additions to my\r\nbotanical collections; when passing over a low flat hill, the top of\r\nwhich was rather rocky and bare, I found large patches covered with a\r\ndwarf fruticose _Cuphea_ with small leaves, bearing numerous purple\r\nflowers, and so much did this plant at first sight resemble the heather\r\nof my native hills, that I imagined I had found a species of that genus;\r\nalthough disappointed, this little incident recalled many pleasant\r\nrecollections of home. It is a remarkable fact in the geographical\r\ndistribution of plants, and not generally known to those who have not\r\nmade that subject their study, that though heaths are very common in\r\nEurope and Africa, not a single species has hitherto been detected on the\r\nAmerican continent, either South or North. This is the more remarkable,\r\nas the great mass of vegetation at the Cape of Good Hope is made up of\r\nthese plants, nearly four hundred different kinds having already been\r\nfound there. From Canavieira, a journey of six leagues brought us to the\r\nbanks of the Rio Canindé, at a place called Passagem de Dona Antonia, and\r\ndistant only a league and a half from the city of Oeiras. Our route was\r\nthrough an almost continued forest of Carnahuba palms, and as the Rio\r\ndas Guaribas ran nearly parallel with it, and had recently overflowed\r\nthe flat country on each side to a great distance, we found the roads\r\nvery bad from the great deposit of mud, which had been left often more\r\nthan a foot deep. In many places the palm stems shewed by their muddy\r\nappearance, that the water had covered them to the depth of upwards of\r\ntwelve feet. At this season, intermittent and malignant fevers are very\r\nprevalent, from the malaria arising from the vast tracts of country left\r\ndry by the fall of the rivers. It being too late when we arrived to cross\r\nthe river and reach the city before dark, we remained with some other\r\ntravellers at the ferry-house for the night.\r\n\r\nNext morning, the 12th of March, all our luggage was taken over to the\r\nopposite side of the river, in a small canoe, which had to return several\r\ntimes, and afterwards the horses were swum over one by one. Passing\r\nthrough the flat sandy country covered with small trees and beautiful\r\nflowering shrubs, we reached the city of Oeiras about eleven o’clock in\r\nthe forenoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nOEIRAS TO PARNAGUÁ.\r\n\r\n    The Author’s reception by the President of Piauhy—City\r\n    of Oeiras described—Its Population—Its Trade with the\r\n    Coast—Great want of River Navigation—Its chief exports\r\n    are hides and cattle—Its Climate—Diseases—Character\r\n    of the Barão de Parnahiba—His great power in the\r\n    Province—History of this Remarkable Man—And of the Civil War\r\n    on declaration of the Independence of Brazil—Resources of\r\n    the Province—National Cattle Farms—Course of the Author’s\r\n    Journey quite changed by an alarming Revolt—This Insurrection\r\n    described—He determines on travelling southwards through\r\n    Goyaz and Minas Geräes—Leaves Oeiras—Description of the\r\n    Country—Chapadas—Passes through many Cattle Farms—Curious\r\n    mode of catching Cattle—Passes Pombas—Algodoes—Golfes—Retiro\r\n    Alegre—Genipapo—Canavieira—Urusuhy—Prazeres—Description\r\n    of a Piauhy Family—Reaches Flores—Rapoza—Arrives at\r\n    Parnaguá—Universal Hospitality of the Natives—Salt found in the\r\n    Neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I brought several letters of recommendation with me to the Barão de\r\nParnahiba, the President of the Province, I made enquiries for his house\r\non entering the city, and was directed to it by a soldier. The Palacio,\r\nas it is called, is situated on the most elevated part of the town, is of\r\none story, and has a very ordinary appearance. On arriving at the door\r\nI found it guarded by a sentinel, one of the most abject-looking beings\r\nthat can be imagined. He was a young mulatto, dressed in the uniform of\r\nthe troops of the line, which seemed as if it had not been off his back\r\nfor the last six years; his cloth cap was old and greasy, his blue jacket\r\none half patches and the other half holes, was open in front, displaying\r\nhis naked breast, for he could not boast the possession of a shirt; his\r\ntrowsers were little better than his jacket, and his bare feet were\r\nthrust into a pair of old shoes, down at the heels, and open at the\r\ntoes. Had it not been for his musket, and his upright position, I should\r\ncertainly have taken him for a beggar. There was a pavement a few feet\r\nin breadth in front of the house, upon which, when I stopped, my horse’s\r\nfore-feet rested, and, before I had time to speak, the sentinel started\r\nforward, seized the bridle, and turned him off into the street. I then\r\ndismounted and was about to proceed to the door, but no sooner had I put\r\nfoot upon the pavement, than I was served in the same way as my horse had\r\nbeen, and told that no one was allowed to enter the palace with spurs\r\non. These I instantly took off, and having asked if anything else was\r\nnecessary to be done, I was at last allowed to enter.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the lobby I was met by a sergeant, who asked me if I wished\r\nto speak with his Excellency, and who, on being told that I had letters\r\nfor him, said that it was his duty to deliver them. After waiting about a\r\nquarter of an hour in the lobby, I was shewn into a large room containing\r\ntwo small tables, a sofa, and a few chairs. Here I had not been more than\r\nfive minutes, when his Excellency made his appearance with my letters in\r\nhis hand. He told me to excuse him while he read them, as also to pardon\r\nhis undress, which he wore, he said, on account of the great heat of the\r\nday. The dress he had on was certainly one of a very light nature, but\r\nwas that generally worn in the house by the inhabitants of this province;\r\nit consisted of a thin white cotton shirt hanging loose over a pair of\r\ndrawers of the same material, which reached but a short way below his\r\nknees; his legs and feet were bare, the latter being thrust into a pair\r\nof old slippers; around his neck were several rosaries, with crucifixes\r\nand other appendages of gold attached to them.\r\n\r\nWhile he was looking over my letters I could not help scrutinizing the\r\nappearance of an individual whose name is more celebrated than that of\r\nany other in the north of Brazil, and whose despotic government of the\r\nprovince of which he is President, has gained for him the appellation\r\nof ‘The Francia of Piauhy.’ He was low in stature and strongly built,\r\nthough not corpulent, and his looks bespoke considerably more activity,\r\nboth of body and mind, than is generally met with in persons of his\r\nage in Brazil, for he was then about seventy years old; his head was\r\nremarkably large, and, according to the principles of phrenology was\r\npretty well balanced before and behind, but deficient in the region of\r\nthe moral sentiments, and was of considerable breadth between the ears.\r\nIn conversation his countenance had a sinister unpleasant expression,\r\nnotwithstanding that it was generally covered with a half-formed smile.\r\nAfter finishing the letters, all of which he read over very carefully,\r\nwe entered into a conversation respecting my visit to the province, but\r\nI could not make him understand that my collections were for any other\r\npurpose than that of being converted into medicine or dye stuffs. That\r\nthe productions of nature were studied for any other purpose than as\r\nregards their mere utility to man, he could not form the slightest idea.\r\nAs soon as he learned that it was my intention to remain for some time in\r\nthe city, he sent a person to procure an empty house for my use; and, as\r\nit was not furnished, he was kind enough to send me two chairs, a table,\r\nand a large earthen pot to hold water.\r\n\r\nThe city of Oeiras, the capital of the Province of Piauhy, is situated\r\nin a large circular valley, about a league in breadth, nearly surrounded\r\nby a broken range of low hills composed of a soft whitish-coloured\r\nsandstone. Until the year 1724, when it was raised to the dignity of a\r\ncity, it was known by the name of Villa da Mocha, from a little stream\r\nwhich passes close to it and all the year round yields an abundant supply\r\nof water, which, however, in the dry season is very much impregnated\r\nwith saltpetre. It is very irregularly built, consisting principally of\r\na large square, and a few streets which proceed from the south and west\r\nsides of it. The population does not exceed three thousand souls; the\r\nmost respectable part of which, not including those in the employ of\r\nthe government, are shopkeepers who retail European goods. The greater\r\npart of the merchandize comes from Maranham, being carried in large\r\ncanoes up the Rio Itapicuru to Cachias, from whence they are brought to\r\nOeiras on the backs of horses. A portion is also brought by the same\r\nmeans from Bahia, but the distance is much too great to render such\r\nexpeditions profitable; this is brought by drovers who go there yearly\r\nwith cattle for sale. Sometimes a solitary launch of twenty tons burden,\r\nladen with salt, arrives in the Rio Canindé, opposite Oeiras, from\r\nthe Villa da Parnahiba, a flourishing town near the coast on the east\r\nbank of a large river of the same name, which divides the Provinces of\r\nMaranham and Piauhy, and up which the navigation takes place. One such\r\narrived during my visit, but it took nearly three months to perform the\r\ndistance, which is about one hundred leagues. It is only during the rainy\r\nseason, when the river is flooded, that this voyage can be undertaken,\r\nand the current is then so strong that the vessel has to be pushed up by\r\npoles all they way. Owing to the length of time, and the number of men\r\nrequired, it is seldom that such a speculation terminates profitably. It\r\nhas been recently proposed by Mr. Sturz, the Consul-General for Brazil,\r\nin Prussia, to navigate this stream by a small steam-boat, but there are\r\nmany reasons for concluding that this will never be successfully put into\r\nexecution. It is not probable that the middle and southern portions of\r\nthe Province will ever be much more populous than they are at present, as\r\nfrom the great yearly droughts to which they are liable, the cultivation\r\nof cotton or sugar can never be carried on. The only articles of export\r\nare cattle and hides, and the latter is all that a steamer would get\r\nas cargo downwards. As regards the import of European goods, it is not\r\nlikely that the traffic would soon be changed from Maranham to Parnahiba.\r\nThe river, moreover, would only be navigable during the rainy season,\r\nat which period the force of the current, and the numerous shifting\r\nsandbanks which its bed is said to contain, would render the transit both\r\nslow and difficult.\r\n\r\nThe city contains three churches, two of which though now of considerable\r\nage are unfinished. There are also several other public buildings,\r\nsuch as a jail, military barracks, the provincial house of assembly,\r\nthe Camara Municipal, and hospital, but none of these are deserving of\r\nnotice excepting the jail, which was then just completed; it was erected\r\nunder the superintendence of a German engineer, who has resided in the\r\nprovince several years in the employ of the government; it consists of\r\ntwo stories, in which respect only two other buildings like it are to be\r\nfound in the city; the lower part and wings serve as prisons and a house\r\nof correction, the upper story being used as a court of justice. At the\r\nnorth end of the city there is a fine large building, now falling into\r\nruins, which was the college of the Jesuits previous to their expulsion\r\nfrom Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe seasons are very regular in this district, and although very few old\r\npersons are seen, it is not considered unhealthy. A few showers generally\r\ntake place in the month of October, but the regular rains do not set in\r\ntill about the beginning of January, when they continue till the end of\r\nMay; during this period thunder storms are very common, fearfully loud,\r\nand of long duration, and accidents, it is said, do not unfrequently\r\noccur from them. Between Crato and Oeiras we saw several large trees\r\nwhich had been shivered in pieces by lightning; and while in Oeiras I was\r\ninformed that a fazendeiro who was returning to his country house, after\r\none of the church festivals, sent his family, consisting of his wife and\r\nseveral children, with their attendant slaves, a short distance before\r\nhim; on overtaking them he was shocked to find them all dead, having been\r\nstruck by lightning from a thunder storm which was then passing over. The\r\nmonths of May, June, and July, are the most pleasant of the season, for\r\nthen the rains have ceased, and everything continues fresh and green,\r\nand the atmosphere is comparatively cool, from a strong S.E. wind which\r\nprevails during this period. After the month of July a great change takes\r\nplace, the whole country begins to wear a dry and arid appearance, the\r\ngrass and other herbaceous vegetation wither up, and the trees and shrubs\r\nthrow off their leaves. At this period too the cooling S.E. winds cease,\r\nand are followed by light and variable ones or by calms, from which cause\r\nthe air becomes so much heated, that no one stirs abroad, excepting those\r\nwho are under the necessity of doing so.\r\n\r\nThe principal diseases in and around the city are agues and malignant\r\nfevers, particularly at the beginning and end of the rainy season; after\r\nthe rains have ceased, and during the prevalence of the south-east wind,\r\npectoral complaints are not uncommon, and many cases of ophthalmia occur;\r\nin the latter, either because of improper treatment, or from neglect,\r\nmany persons lose their sight. But the complaint for which I was most\r\nfrequently called upon to prescribe, was dyspepsia, which under its\r\nvarious forms, these people are most subject to; asthma and paralysis\r\nare also prevalent. At the time I visited Oeiras it could boast of\r\ntwo resident medical men and an apothecary’s shop; the latter was but\r\npoorly furnished with medicines, and those neither new nor of the best\r\nquality. The senior of the two medical men, Senhor Josè Luiz da Silva,\r\nan intelligent and amiable person, from whom I received much kindness,\r\nholds the office of Cirurgião môr, and has charge of a small hospital,\r\nwhich is almost entirely devoted to the service of the military. He is\r\na Portuguese by birth, and in his youth had acted as surgeon in the\r\nnavy of that country. He had now resided thirty-six years in Oeiras,\r\nand was the father of a large and respectable family. The other, a\r\nyoung Brazilian, educated at Bahia, ill instructed, and of an unamiable\r\ndisposition, was assassinated in the street a few months after I left.\r\nAlthough they both of them were accustomed to treat diseases generally,\r\nneither of them had the skill, and consequently the courage to undertake\r\nany serious operation, notwithstanding that many cases had long called\r\nfor professional assistance. An opportunity was thus afforded me of\r\nundertaking several operations which few young surgeons in England have\r\nit in their power to attempt. The most serious of these were depression\r\nof Cataract and Lithotomy; the former I performed three times, but with\r\nsuccess only in one case, when such was the astonishment produced in the\r\nminds of these simple people, by the blind regaining his sight, that it\r\nwas spoken of through the country as a result little short of a miracle.\r\nThe operation for stone in the bladder was likewise performed by me three\r\ntimes, in all cases with the greatest success; and it is deserving of\r\nremark that these were the only instances of this complaint that I met\r\nwith during my whole travels. There can be no doubt, therefore, that\r\nthis complaint is of very rare occurrence in the country, but it is not\r\neasy to say from what cause this originates. My first patient was an\r\notherwise healthy free black man, about thirty years of age; and it was\r\nastonishing to see the rapidity with which the wound healed; but this\r\nhas been found to occur universally in people of his colour. The second\r\nwas a poor mulatto, who lived in a little palm hut in the outskirts of\r\nthe city: both these poor fellows did all in their power to show their\r\ngratitude, and would willingly have parted with all they possessed to\r\nrepay me, but of course I would take nothing from them. The third case\r\nwas the most remarkable of all: the patient was a man about forty-five\r\nyears of age, and one of the most respectable shopkeepers in the city.\r\nAbout nine years before my arrival he had been treated by the surgeon\r\nin chief for stricture of the urethra, when by improper treatment a\r\nportion of a small leaden bougie passed into the bladder; this formed the\r\nnucleus for the stone, from which cause he suffered the most excruciating\r\nagonies that mortal could endure. I was consulted by him on my arrival,\r\nwhen I assured him that nothing but an operation would relieve him from\r\nhis sufferings; being, however, of a very timid disposition, he would\r\nnot consent to its performance, till after he heard of the success of\r\nthe other two cases; assisted by my friend the Cirurgião môr, I happily\r\nsucceeded in extricating the stone, which was about two inches in length.\r\nThis occurred about a month before I left the place, by which time he was\r\nso far recovered as to be able to walk about his room. After a period of\r\neighteen months I received a letter which he sent to meet me at Rio de\r\nJaneiro, in which he informed me that he had perfectly recovered, and\r\noffered me a thousand thanks (mil graças) for the good service rendered\r\nto him. Before I left, he gave me a very handsome gratuity of three\r\nhundred spanish dollars, two fine horses, and many little necessaries\r\nsuited for the journey I was then about to undertake.\r\n\r\nThe province of Piauhy sends two members to the national chamber of\r\nDeputies in Rio, but in all that relates to its internal government, the\r\nBarão de Parnahiba rules with despotic sway. He has been its president\r\never since the establishment of the independence of the empire, with the\r\nexception of one short period, when another person was sent to supersede\r\nhim; but he did not hold his appointment long, dying suddenly, and under\r\nsuspicious circumstances. Since that period, although the presidents of\r\nall the other provinces are changed every two or three years, he has\r\nremained constantly in office. He is more feared than respected by the\r\nmass of the population, and on an emergency can command, among his own\r\nfriends and dependents, more than 2,000 staunch supporters: he has always\r\nat his call those who are both ready and willing to execute his orders of\r\nwhatever nature these may be. By the firmness of his government he has\r\nacquired many enemies, especially by the enactment of some provincial\r\nlaws, respecting which it must be confessed in their favour, that their\r\ntendency is always to benefit the poorer classes of the inhabitants:\r\namong others, he has forbidden that beef and farinha, the two principle\r\narticles of food, be sold in the city above a certain fixed price, and\r\nthat a very low one; however, he has always taken care that his own\r\ncattle be sent to Bahia and other distant and more profitable markets,\r\nhaving abundant facilities for such arrangements. Although generally\r\nill-informed, he possesses a great share of shrewdness and cunning,\r\nqualifications highly requisite for the maintenance of the despotism with\r\nwhich he has hitherto governed the province, under which it can certainly\r\nboast of a greater amount of peace and quietness than almost any other\r\nprovince in the empire. It is not a little strange that, notwithstanding\r\nhis many enemies, only one attempt has hitherto been made to assassinate\r\nhim, and that so late as the year before I arrived there.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of January, 1838, on returning from one of his fazendas, and\r\nwhen about half a league from the city he was fired at from behind some\r\nbushes; the shot only wounded him in the right shoulder. The assassins,\r\nfor there were two, fled immediately, and one of them appeared among the\r\nfirst to congratulate the Barão on his arrival after so fortunate an\r\nescape. Parties were instantly despatched to scour the woods in pursuit\r\nof the delinquents, and a black man who was found hidden among some\r\nbushes, and who could not give a good account of himself, was taken to\r\nthe city, and on being interrogated, confessed that although he was one\r\nof the parties, he did not fire the shot, the person who did so being one\r\nJoaquim Seleiro, a mulatto saddler, who lived in the house of the Barão.\r\nThis man was said to be of a very vicious disposition, and of strong\r\npassions; and it was well known that a few days before the occurrence,\r\nhe had been ill used in some manner by the Barão, without just cause. At\r\nthe time he was denounced, he was leading a party in the woods in search\r\nof the assassins; and was not a little astonished on his return to find\r\nhimself a prisoner. He strongly denied the crime of which few deemed\r\nhim to be innocent; the laws of the country do not inflict the penalty\r\nof death for a mere attempt at murder: he was, therefore, committed to\r\nprison, where he died twenty-six days after the perpetration of that\r\ncrime, under circumstances that have given rise to suspicious reports.\r\n\r\nTo those who are interested in the history of Brazil, a slight sketch\r\nof the life of so extraordinary a man as the Barão de Parnahiba, may\r\nnot be uninteresting, as his name is intimately connected with the\r\nestablishment of the independence of the northern provinces. His father\r\nwas a native of the Azores, and was very poor when he arrived in Brazil,\r\nbut he soon married a lady possessed of a small property; of the family\r\nresulting from this union, the subject of this notice was the eldest,\r\nbeing born in the year 1776. His only education consisted in learning\r\nto read and write, and in acquiring a slight knowledge of arithmetic.\r\nHis first occupation was that of a cowherd (vaqueiro) to his father,\r\nwho died when he was only twenty years of age, leaving him a fazenda\r\nworth about 1,500 cruzados (£200 sterling); during his childhood he was\r\nbrought up by a godmother, who at her death left him another fazenda\r\nof nearly equal value. After his father’s death, not content with the\r\noccupation of vaqueiro, he began to purchase cattle with the view of\r\ntaking them to Bahia for sale, to which place he continued to go every\r\nyear, till about twenty-five years ago, although from that period up to\r\nthe present, he has never failed to send annually a drove of cattle to\r\nthe same market. Shortly after his father’s death he was enlisted, as was\r\nthen the custom, into the cavalry militia; here he was soon advanced to\r\nthe post of corporal which he held for a long time; he was next elevated\r\nto the rank of ensign, and about the same time was appointed treasurer\r\nof the national rents. Occupied in this manner, he continued till the\r\nperiod of the declaration of independence, when his name had acquired\r\nbut little weight in the province, being better known for his cunning\r\ndisposition and uncouth manners, than for any more eminent qualities. It\r\nwas his custom to bestow gifts and attentions, and be very obsequious to\r\nall persons high in authority, such as governors, judges, &c., always\r\nproviding men, horses, and provisions to bring them up from the coast.\r\nIn this manner he ingratiated himself in their favour, and after their\r\narrival was always their obedient servant; and without regard to their\r\nline of politics was ever a staunch supporter of their measures. He\r\nmade it his endeavour on all occasions to gain the good opinions of the\r\nreligious part of the community, by showing himself to be a great friend\r\nto all that belonged to the church, on which account he was anxious to\r\nbe appointed director of its festivals, on which he did not hesitate to\r\nspend large sums, in this manner obtaining the good will and friendship\r\nof the priesthood.\r\n\r\nAt the time when Dom João the sixth gave the Constitution to Portugal,\r\nthe larger provinces of Brazil were ruled by Governors General\r\n(Governadores Geräes), and the smaller by Governors only, the power of\r\nall being to a certain extent despotic. At this time the province of\r\nPiauhy was committed to the charge of Elias José Ribeiro de Carvalho,\r\na native of Portugal, but immediately on the proclamation of the\r\nconstitution in the mother country he was recalled, when the province\r\nfell to the care of a provisional government, consisting of six members,\r\none of whom was the present president. It was during this time that a\r\nMajor Fedié arrived at Oeiras from Rio de Janeiro, as commander in chief\r\nof the military force in the province, and who soon afterwards became\r\nnotorious for his opposition to the cause of independence. It was also\r\nduring the reign of this Governo Provisorio, as it was called, that Dom\r\nPedro Primeiro proclaimed the independence of Brazil. It was of course a\r\nlong time before the news of this great event, that had taken place in\r\nRio, reached this far distant province, and when the accounts arrived\r\nFedié, true to the fealty he owed João, who had sent him thither, and\r\nsupposing it to be only a disturbance of short duration, firmly opposed\r\nits proclamation in the city of Oeiras; and as soon as he learned it had\r\nbeen supported in the Villa da Parnahiba, he collected all the troops\r\nand militia he could raise, and marched against the inhabitants of that\r\nplace, notwithstanding that he received previously official notice from\r\nthe newly declared central government in Rio, ordering him to proclaim\r\nthe independence of the country in the city. At this time also, advices\r\narrived from the provinces of Bahia and Ceará, both of which had followed\r\nthe example of the capital, strongly urging the most influential persons\r\nin the province to adopt the same course in Piauhy, but all refused to do\r\nso, declaring themselves to be firm supporters of the constitution of Dom\r\nJoão.\r\n\r\nAt this time the influence of the Barão was so small that none of the\r\nletters were addressed to him, but the opportunity did not escape him,\r\nfor by the same posts that carried the above answers, he sent notice\r\nto both places that he was willing, in conjunction with several of\r\nhis friends, to give his warmest support, and proclaim the cause of\r\nindependence. Shortly after the departure of Fedié for Parnahiba, the\r\nBarão received answers to his letters, and was urged to lose no time\r\nin carrying his proposal into effect, to which end he immediately\r\napprehended the members of the provisional government, who were in\r\nOeiras, and confined them in prison, together with others who were either\r\nknown or suspected to belong to the opposite party. The inhabitants of\r\nParnahiba learning that Fedié was on the march for that place, united\r\nthemselves and advanced on the road to meet him; the encounter took place\r\nat Campo Maior, about half way between Oeiras and Parnahiba, where in a\r\nvery short time Fedié completely defeated the other party and put them\r\nto rout. In the meantime the Barão was using every exertion to raise men\r\nto march against Fedié who was the most powerful opponent he had to\r\ndread. In order to give more weight to his authority, he first proclaimed\r\nhimself president of the province; and under the pretence that Fedié was\r\nabout to return to Oeiras, and that it was necessary to place them in\r\nsecurity, he seized on the funds of the provincial treasury, which was\r\nsaid to be very rich at that time; but it is generally reported that the\r\ngreater part of this treasure was never sufficiently accounted for: it\r\nis certain that at this time he laid the foundation of the great wealth\r\nwhich he at present possesses. He immediately sent advices to Rio de\r\nJaneiro stating what he had done, and in return Dom Pedro confirmed him\r\nin the presidentship, advanced him to the rank of colonel in the militia,\r\nand created his brother commander-in-chief in lieu of Fedié. The latter\r\nnot wishing to return to Oeiras, where every one was now in arms against\r\nhim, marched immediately to the Villa de Cachias, the most flourishing\r\ntown in the interior of the province of Maranham, and which still\r\nremained loyal to the Portuguese cause. The imperial troops from Oeiras,\r\nhaving now united with those defeated at Campo Maior, together with about\r\n2,500 more from the province of Ceará, headed by the president of Piauhy\r\nand his brother, marched to Cachias against Fedié, who with no more\r\nthan 250 men maintained his position in that town for the long period\r\nof eleven months, and it was only when famine reduced them to the last\r\nnecessity, that he capitulated, and was led back to Oeiras a prisoner.\r\nThence he was conveyed to Rio, when he was liberated and sent to Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe march to Cachias was another fortunate circumstance, which it\r\nis said the president turned to good account, for as nearly all the\r\ninhabitants of that place were natives of Portugal, and consequently\r\nfavourable to the union of the two countries, they were naturally\r\nconsidered by the Brazilians as enemies, and consequently treated as\r\nsuch in the worst possible manner, for they were murdered and robbed\r\nwithout mercy. To save their lives and property, many of them are said to\r\nhave paid the president very handsomely for his protection, and in this\r\nmanner he is believed to have amassed an immense sum of money. After his\r\nreturn from Cachias, the emperor raised him to the rank of a brigadier,\r\nand created him Barão de Parnahiba. The entire management of the affairs\r\nof the province was left in his hands, as it still is, and consequently\r\nall situations were filled up either by his own relations, or by persons\r\nbelonging to his party. On the occasion of the coronation of the present\r\nemperor, he was created a viscount.\r\n\r\nOne of the great sources from which the provincial treasury above alluded\r\nto derives its income, is the profit resulting from the sale of cattle\r\nwhich are reared on thirty-three fazendas belonging to the crown. About\r\nthe end of the seventeenth century, one Domingo Alfonso established a\r\nnumber of cattle-farms in different parts of the province, and at his\r\ndeath thirty of these were put into the hands of the Jesuits, on the\r\ncondition that the profits should be applied to charitable purposes; when\r\nthe Jesuits were expelled from the country, these fazendas, together\r\nwith others they had purchased, became the property of the state. On an\r\naverage about 3,000 head of cattle are sold annually; they are disposed\r\nof to the highest bidder, and although the price varies in different\r\nyears, 6,000 reis (about fifteen shillings) may be taken as their mean\r\nvalue; were these properties well managed a much larger profit might\r\nbe derived from them. Besides the salaries paid to three inspectors,\r\namounting to 300,000 reis each, every fazenda is managed by a vaqueiro,\r\nwhose income is derived from the fourth part of the cattle and horses\r\nannually reared. These situations are much sought after, as in the course\r\nof a few years, the persons who hold them save large sums of money,\r\nhaving no house-rent to pay, and being allowed to have all the profits\r\nresulting from the other produce of the farm, such as sheep, goats,\r\npigs, cheese, &c.; to assist in looking after the cattle, the government\r\nprovides them with slaves whom they are obliged to supply with food and\r\nclothing, the former being all produced on the farm, and the latter,\r\nwhich is both scanty and coarse, costing but a mere trifle.\r\n\r\nShortly after my arrival in Oeiras, some very serious disturbances\r\ntook place in the neighbouring province of Maranham, which prevented\r\nme from following out my original plan of proceeding westward to the\r\nRio Tocantins: I shall briefly notice the origin and progress of these\r\ndisorders. In November 1838, the Prefect of Cachias sent four soldiers\r\nto apprehend a criminal in the Arraial da Chapada, about forty leagues\r\ndistant. The brother of this individual, one Raimundo Gomez, a mestico,\r\nbetter known by the name of Cara preta (black face), and a party of nine\r\nother men whom he had engaged to assist him, disarmed the soldiers and\r\nsent them back; a greater number of soldiers was then despatched by the\r\nprefect to accomplish the same object, but by this time Raimundo had\r\nincreased his band by a number of vagabonds who are never wanting in\r\nthe interior, and who are always more ready to join in a disturbance,\r\nthan to follow any regular employment; on this occasion the soldiers\r\nwere again beaten back. In a short time, this band was greatly augmented\r\nby the desertion of slaves, by Indians and others, who now commenced\r\na regular system of pillage, attacking the fazendas, and taking away\r\nwhatever they pleased. As soon as the president of the province was\r\ninformed of these circumstances, he despatched a troop of about three\r\nhundred soldiers to disperse these robbers, but by some mismanagement,\r\nafter having encountered them at Chapada, their ammunition failed, and\r\nthey were obliged to surrender themselves into the hands of Raimundo.\r\nThe lieutenant-colonel who commanded them, and a captain were put to the\r\nsword, but the rest of the officers and soldiers had their lives spared,\r\non condition that they consented to join the insurgents; and it is said\r\nthat the greater part did so with good will. Raimundo thus strengthened,\r\nnow regularly organized his party, appointing the officers he had\r\ncaptured his secretaries, as neither he nor any of his own partizans\r\ncould read or write. It is pretty certain that about this time he entered\r\ninto correspondence with a party in the city of Maranham, which being\r\nopposed to the monarchical form of government wished its overthrow;\r\nfrom this source it is said that both arms and ammunition were secretly\r\nsupplied to Raimund’s troops.\r\n\r\nThey now took up their quarters at a place called Brejo, rapidly\r\nincreasing in numbers, principally by runaway slaves from the large\r\ncotton plantations in the neighbourhood. In the month of April 1839,\r\nthis united force amounted to about 5,000 men, the principal officer,\r\nbesides Raimundo, being an old Indian, known by the name of O Balaio\r\n(the basket), from his having formerly gained a livelihood by making\r\nbaskets, and selling them in the streets of Cachias. Being well armed,\r\nthe rebel army, as it was called, marched to Cachias with the intention\r\nof taking it; at this time there were only about twenty soldiers in the\r\ntown commanded by a lieutenant, but all the inhabitants rose in arms to\r\ndefend it. The rebels besieged the place for about six weeks, allowing\r\nno provisions to enter, at the end of which time, the inhabitants being\r\nin a state of starvation, and unable to hold out longer, were obliged\r\nto capitulate on the 30th of June. The terms of this capitulation were,\r\nthat all the military stores in the place, amounting to 5,000 stand\r\nof arms, and 800 barrels of gunpowder, should be delivered up, and a\r\nsum equivalent to seventy per cent. on the goods of each merchant and\r\nshopkeeper be paid immediately. The prefect and several other leading men\r\nin the town also, in terms of the capitulation, were declared prisoners,\r\nand kept in close confinement for several months.\r\n\r\nAs these disturbances took place principally to the north of Oeiras, I\r\nhad still hopes of being able to proceed to the westward, but just as I\r\nwas making preparations to leave, several persons arrived in Oeiras from\r\nPastos Boms, a small town a little to the west of the Rio Parnahiba,\r\nexactly on the route I had intended to follow. I learned from them that\r\na party of the rebels had been sent from Cachias to take that place,\r\nwhere five Portuguese and one Brazilian, who were known to be opposed\r\nto them, had been massacred, and their families robbed of all their\r\nproperty. News now reached Oeiras that Raimundo and his army, flushed\r\nwith their success, were about to march from Cachias to take that city.\r\nThe Barão de Parnahiba, who previously had been raising troops to send\r\nto the succour of Cachias, now redoubled his exertions, and the city\r\nbecame filled with rustic troops, undergoing the necessary process of\r\ndrilling; these formed a very motley group, being of all sizes, of all\r\ncolours, and variously dressed, most of them appearing in their leathern\r\nhats, jackets, and trowsers. As there were no symptoms that the rebels\r\nwould soon make their threatened attack on Oeiras, about 600 of these\r\ntroops were despatched early in the month of July, under the command of\r\nMajor Clementino Martins, the baron’s nephew, to join others, ordered\r\nto march from Ceará and Pernambuco, to the succour of Cachias. As soon\r\nas the rebels received notice of this movement, a general sack of the\r\ntown took place, by about a thousand men, who still remained there, on\r\nwhich occasion many of the inhabitants for the most part Portuguese were\r\nmurdered. It was not till the month of January 1840, that Cachias was\r\nfinally restored to order, and still later before peace was established\r\nin Pastos Boms and Brejo. In passing through a ravine near Cachias,\r\nthat had been fortified by the rebels, Major Clementino and nearly all\r\nhis troops were cut off. It was calculated that from the beginning to\r\nthe end of this insurrection, more than 5,000 fell victims; this may\r\nbe considered as an example of the outbreaks perpetually occurring in\r\nBrazil, which keep it in an almost continual state of disorder, and\r\nparalyse the energies of those who really wish well to their country.\r\n\r\nPrevented in this manner from travelling westward, and unwilling to\r\nretrace my steps, I determined to proceed southward to Rio de Janeiro,\r\nthrough the great inland provinces of Goyaz and Minas Geräes, though but\r\nill provided for such an undertaking, particularly in pecuniary matters,\r\nthe state of the country rendering it impossible to receive money from\r\nthe coast. I had, however, my profession to depend upon, and I knew\r\nthat if much money could not be gained by it, a great deal of expense\r\nmight be saved, for I had already experienced that, as a medical man, I\r\nwas well received wherever I went. The country to the south-west being\r\nalso in rather an unsettled state, I was strongly advised by the Barão\r\nde Parnahiba, as well as by other influential persons in Oeiras, not to\r\npursue this proposed journey, as I should run a risk of losing my life\r\nby so doing; but my strong desire to pass through a hitherto unexplored\r\ncountry, determined me not to listen to their advice, and I immediately\r\nset about making arrangements for undertaking it.\r\n\r\nThe large collections which I made between Crato and Oeiras, and in the\r\nneighbourhood of the latter place, I had intended to send to Maranham\r\nto be shipped for England, but this was now impossible, on account of\r\nthe great distance between Oeiras and Pernambuco or Bahia. There is but\r\nlittle traffic between these places, and had it not been for a fortunate\r\noccurrence, there would have been no resource left but to take them with\r\nme to Rio. From Pernambuco I brought letters with me to Dr. Casimiro\r\nJosé de Moraes Sarmento, a young advocate, who held a small government\r\nappointment in Oeiras, his native place; with this gentleman I formed\r\na very intimate friendship; besides being well educated, I found him\r\npossessed of a very superior intelligence, of much moral worth, and\r\nof great goodness of heart. He had brought with him from Pernambuco,\r\nwhere he studied, a fine library of Portuguese, French, and English\r\nworks, of all which he generously allowed me the freest use. The moment\r\nI was preparing to leave Oeiras, he suddenly determined to return to\r\nPernambuco, and kindly consented to take my collections with him, which\r\nbeing packed in such a manner as only to form a single load, I despatched\r\non one of my own horses.\r\n\r\nAs far as I could learn, only one Englishman had visited this part of\r\nthe country; several of the inhabitants still remembered Drs. Spix and\r\nMartius, and the house in which they resided was pointed out to me by\r\nthe old Barão, who was then, however, a person of but small note in the\r\nplace. During the four months I passed in this city, I met with the\r\ngreatest civility and hospitality from all classes of society, much more,\r\nindeed, than in any other place in the empire in which I resided for\r\nany period. The Barão was particularly obliging, for besides providing\r\na house for me, he sent my horses to one of his fazendas to graze, and\r\nI was a frequent guest at his table: he dines quite in the old baronial\r\nfashion, his table, which is very long, extending from one end to the\r\nother of a large room. He himself sits in a chair at the head of it,\r\nand his guests are seated on long forms placed on each side, the lowest\r\nplaces being often filled by his commonest shepherds. Captain Antonio de\r\nMoraes, the father of my young friend, and Captain Faria, I particularise\r\namong a host of others to whom I am indebted for innumerable services;\r\nindeed, I shall ever look back on my stay at Oeiras, as one of the most\r\npleasant portions of my pilgrimage in Brazil.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 22nd of July, we bade adieu to the city of\r\nOeiras, and commenced our overland journey to Rio,—a journey which,\r\nthough both tedious and painful, yielded me a far more abundant harvest\r\nof novelties than I anticipated. It was my intention to leave in the\r\nmorning, but while preparing to do so, one of the men I had engaged to\r\ngo as far as the southern extremity of the province of Piauhy, came to\r\ninform me that he had changed his mind: I instantly applied to the Barão\r\nfor his assistance in procuring another, and as soon as he learned what\r\nhad occurred, he sent for the man, who, still refusing to go, was sent\r\nto prison. He then kindly informed me, that he would allow me the use\r\nof a soldier, and having sent for one, told him that if he served me\r\nfaithfully, he would give him his discharge on his return. I did not much\r\nlike the look of this man, his face having one of the most cut-throat\r\nexpressions I ever saw: I had no help but to accept his services, though\r\nin the end I was glad to get rid of him, as he proved to be one of the\r\nmost insolent, lazy, and sulky fellows I ever had in my service. Captain\r\nMoraes and several other of my friends accompanied me for about a league\r\nfrom the city, when, with their hearty wishes for a safe return to my\r\nnative country, we parted. About a league further we encamped for the\r\nnight, under some large trees by the side of a small stream.\r\n\r\nOur route was now nearly in a southerly direction, and lay through a\r\nbeautiful country, consisting of diversified and park-like scenery. Many\r\nlarge flat tracts occur, to which the name of Chapada is given; these\r\nare but thinly wooded, the trees consisting of the Cashew (_Anacardium\r\noccidentale_), Jatobá (_Hymenæa_), Parahiba (_Simaruba versicolor_), and\r\nthe Folha largo (_Salvertia convallariodora_),—a beautiful tree with\r\nlarge leaves, and spikes of sweet-smelling flowers, not unlike those of\r\nthe horse-chesnut. As the weather was now quite settled, we generally\r\nslept in the open air at night, slinging our hammocks between trees. At\r\na short distance from Oeiras, we passed through some of the national\r\nfazendas, and on one of them had an opportunity of seeing the method\r\nadopted by the vaqueiros for catching the cattle, which roam about in\r\nlarge herds nearly in a wild state. In the southern provinces, it is\r\nwell known that the cattle are caught by the lasso and bolas, the open\r\ncountry of those districts allowing their free use, which is not the\r\ncase in the north. The instrument used here is a slender pole about\r\nnine feet long, a little thicker at one end than at the other; into the\r\nthicker end, a quadrangular pointed piece of iron is fixed, projecting\r\nonly about half an inch; mounted on horseback, with this pole in his\r\nhand, the vaqueiro selects with his eye the animal he wishes to take,\r\nand pursuing it at full gallop, he soon overtakes it, and striking it\r\non the hip with the armed end of the pole, while it is going at full\r\nspeed, he easily upsets it, and before it can rise again, the vaqueiro\r\nhas dismounted, and secured it; in this manner nearly all the cattle\r\nare taken in this province. There are no fences between the different\r\nproperties, but every fazendeiro has a brand, with which all his horses\r\nand cattle are marked before they are allowed to roam at liberty, and by\r\nwhich they are, of course, easily recognised. The cattle of Piauhy supply\r\nfor the most part the markets of Maranham, Bahia, and Pernambuco; droves\r\nare also occasionally sent into the province of Minas Geräes; they are\r\ngenerally of a large size, and vary very much in colour, though brown is\r\nthe prevailing one; their horns are long, pointed, and wide-spreading.\r\nWe stopped a night at one of these national fazendas, which was entirely\r\ndevoted to the rearing of horses, and the principal vaqueiro informed\r\nme that it produced annually about 400 foals. The horses of Piauhy are\r\nin general small, and not long-lived, seldom exceeding ten or twelve\r\nyears; those used on the cattle farms, owing to the violent exercise of\r\nhunting the cattle, do not last so long. The riding horses are broken in\r\nwith great care, and some of the paces which they are taught are very\r\npleasant; they are never shod, and this is less necessary here than in\r\nmany of the other provinces, for the roads are generally level and soft.\r\nThe price of a good working horse, that is, one fit for carrying a load\r\non a journey, is seldom more than three pounds.\r\n\r\nWe were now in the country to which the name of Campos Agrestes is\r\ngiven in Piauhy. These Campos are partly open, and partly wooded; the\r\nopen tracts are covered with coarse perennial grasses, and are not\r\nentirely destitute of trees, but all are more or less deciduous, with\r\nthe exception of one which is truly evergreen; this is a species of\r\n_Zizyphus_, known by the name of Joazeira; it is not a large tree, but\r\nhas wide-spreading branches that give an excellent shade, of which we\r\noften took advantage during the heat of the day. The cattle also are\r\nvery fond of the shade of this tree, as well as of the sweet fleshy\r\nfruit, about the size of a small cherry, which it produces in great\r\nabundance, and which when ripe falls to the ground; this fruit, called\r\nJoá, is also eaten by the inhabitants. Many of the trees of these tracts\r\nhave a stunted appearance, their branches being gnarled and tortuous.\r\nSometimes large swampy tracts exist in the Campos Agrestes, and in these\r\ngrow clusters of Buriti palms, the soft fruit of which is the principal\r\nfood of three beautiful species of Maccaw which frequent them in great\r\nnumbers. These birds generally fly in pairs, and rend the air with their\r\nloud cries of ará, ará, ará, and hence the Indian name of Arára. One of\r\nthe most common of these is entirely blue (_Psittacus hyacinthinus_,\r\nLath.); the others are blue also, with the exception of their breasts,\r\nwhich in one of them is orange, while the other has it of a crimson\r\ncolour. Many of the level Chapadas, where the soil is of red clayey\r\ncharacter, are covered with numerous ant-hills, often six or eight feet\r\nhigh, which have the appearance of clay huts when seen at a distance;\r\nthese are formed by the white ant, and as these insects constitute the\r\nprincipal food of the Ostrich of the country (_Rhea Americana_), and the\r\ngreat ant-bear, the Tamandúa of the natives (_Myrmecophaga jubata_),\r\nwe saw many of them in the neighbourhood of the ant-hills. In the more\r\nclosely wooded districts, the trees very much resemble the Catingas of\r\nthe Campos Mimosos, and like them are deciduous in the dry season.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 29th of July, we reached a little hamlet called\r\nAlgodoes, distant thirty-four leagues from Oeiras, where we remained for\r\na day. We halted in the morning, and breakfasted at a fazenda called\r\nPombas, about three leagues from Algodoes; and when we left, a fine large\r\nmastiff dog that accompanied us, and which had been presented to me by\r\nCaptain Moraes, was not to be found: this appeared the more remarkable,\r\nas he had become very much attached to us all. I thought he might have\r\ngone into the woods after some animal, and would soon follow us, but as\r\nhe did not appear on the following morning, I sent Mr. Walker back to\r\nmake enquiries about him, when the vaqueiro told him he had not been\r\nseen since we left. I strongly suspected at the time that this man, who\r\nwas the only person on the farm, had stolen him; nor was I mistaken, as\r\nseveral days afterwards I heard from a person who passed a night there,\r\nthat he saw the dog tied up, and was told by the vaqueiro that he had\r\nbeen presented to him by an Englishman who was going up to Minas.\r\n\r\nAt about a league beyond Pombas, we arrived at a large fresh-water lake\r\nextending two leagues in length, but not more than a quarter of a league\r\nin breadth; it terminates at Algodoes; and nearly all along its whole\r\nlength, it is bounded by a belt of Carnahuba palms; the road led by the\r\nside of it, and we frequently came suddenly upon some large alligators\r\n(Jacaré), which were basking in the shallow water by the margin. We\r\nalso saw many Capibaras (_Hydrochærus Capybara_), one troop of which,\r\nconsisting of upwards of fifty individuals, crossed the path about a\r\nhundred yards before us, and entered the water; they crossed the lake\r\nby swimming, and we saw them land on the opposite side. Many parts of\r\nthe lake were covered with the large floating leaves of a water lily\r\n(_Nymphæa_), which unfortunately was not in flower. During the night we\r\nheard the Capibaras plunging in the lake quite near to the house in which\r\nwe slept; and I was told they are seldom molested, as their flesh is\r\nnot good to eat; they are, therefore, very tame in this neighbourhood.\r\nWishing to procure a specimen for the sake of its cranium, I went out\r\nearly in the morning with my gun, but after walking nearly half a league\r\nalong the side of the lake, not one was to be seen: we saw, however,\r\nplenty of alligators, and a very large one, which was floating like an\r\nold log on the surface of the water, at but a little distance from the\r\nshore, was too tempting a shot to be passed by: I fired at his head,\r\nmy gun being loaded with large shot, when making a spring for the deep\r\nwater, it turned upon its back and floated, apparently dead. Believing it\r\nto be so, I sent in Manoel, my Indian servant to bring it out: he waded\r\nup to his chin in the water, and attempted to seize the animal by the\r\ntail, when it turned suddenly round and disappeared. I know not which\r\nof the two was most frightened, for Manoel gave a loud roar, and lost\r\nno time in getting to terra firma: the animal had evidently only been\r\nstunned by the shot.\r\n\r\nIn this lake I found some curious aquatic plants, such as a new species\r\nof _Cabomba_ (_C. Piauhyensis_, Gardn.), a fine yellow-flowered _Jussiæa_\r\n(_J. sedoides_, Humb.), first found by Humboldt in lakes in New Granada;\r\nit floats on the water, and the leaves which are small, all reach the\r\nsurface, and form round the axis of the plant a dense circle, which at\r\na distance appears like a large entire floating leaf. Specimens of a\r\n_Chara_ and a _Potamogeton_ were also collected; both interesting, from\r\nbelonging to genera common to South America and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st, we left Algodoes early in the morning, and after a ride\r\nof about three leagues, over a dry flat Chapada, we arrived at Golfes,\r\na single house situated on a hill near a small marsh, in which grows a\r\ngreat number of Buriti palms; we halted by the side of this marsh, under\r\na large Cashew tree. In the afternoon, another journey of two leagues\r\nand a half, brought us to a small uninhabited house, at a place called\r\nRetiro Alegre, situated in a beautiful valley, skirted by high hills,\r\nand abounding in Buriti palms, the leaves of which afforded shelter to\r\nvast numbers of the orange-breasted Maccaw (_Canindé_). At this place I\r\nfound a little black fellow, waiting my arrival to act as guide to the\r\nnext fazenda (Genipapo), which was five leagues and a half distant. He\r\nwas sent by Captain Valentim Pereira da Silva, whom I met at Algodoes,\r\non his way to visit his son, to whom the country through which we were\r\nthen passing, belonged. When this old man knew that I was the person\r\nwho had performed several cures in Oeiras, he was very desirous that I\r\nshould visit his son, who was in a bad state of health; and as his house\r\nwas only a few leagues out of our direct course, I consented to do so.\r\nAbout half a league from the fazenda the son himself met us. The estate\r\nof Genipapo belongs to him, and we remained there for the night; but he\r\nwent to another, two leagues further on, called Canavieira, at which he\r\nhimself resides.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning we arrived at Canavieira in time for breakfast,\r\nand had a very hospitable reception from the captain and his son; upon\r\nexamination, I found the latter labouring under the incipient symptoms\r\nof consumption, and prescribed for him accordingly. It being seldom\r\nthat a medical man is seen in this part of the country, I had many\r\nother patients to prescribe for, some of whom came from a considerable\r\ndistance. At about a quarter of a mile beyond Genipapo, we arrived\r\nat the banks of the Rio Gurgea, which takes its rise in the southern\r\nextremity of the province, and falls into the Parnahiba, a little below\r\nthe parallel of Oeiras. As is generally the case with the rivers in the\r\nnorthern provinces, the banks of this are more densely wooded, and more\r\nverdant in appearance, than the rest of the country. I remained with my\r\nhospitable friends all that day, and received an invitation to accompany\r\nthem on the following morning to a fazenda eight leagues distant,\r\nbelonging to the son’s father-in-law, whither all the family were going,\r\nas the Visitador was on his triennial tour, and was expected there about\r\nthis time. This place also being but little out of our route, I accepted\r\nthe invitation.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 3rd of August we left Canavieira, and, after a\r\nride of about three leagues, crossed the Rio Gurgea, and entered the\r\ndistrict of Urusuhy. The river here was about the breadth of the Clyde\r\nat Glasgow, but so shallow, that it did not reach much above the horse’s\r\nmiddle. After riding another league, we arrived at a house belonging to\r\na vaqueiro, where we halted to take breakfast, and to remain during the\r\nheat of the day. The house was situated in a hollow, and being shut out\r\nfrom the breeze, the heat was quite intolerable. The thermometer in the\r\nshade rose to 98°, and I suffered dreadfully from headache. We did not\r\nleave this place till four o’clock in the afternoon, and having still\r\nfour leagues to travel, we reached the Fazenda dos Prazeres a little\r\nafter sunset. With the exception of the banks of the river, the whole\r\ncountry through which we passed, was very much dried up for want of rain.\r\n\r\nOur party was rather a large one. Besides ourselves, there were the\r\ncaptain, his son and lady, and a mulatto girl carrying their child, which\r\nthey were taking to get baptized, three of the captain’s nephews, and a\r\nblack schoolmaster, all from top to toe in leather dresses; and, besides\r\nthe blacks on foot who were bringing on the loaded horses, there were\r\nthree on horseback acting as attendants. The lady and her girl were both\r\nmounted on men’s saddles, according to the common custom of the country\r\nin the interior. The black schoolmaster was decidedly far superior to any\r\nof his race that I ever met with. He was a Creole, with a fine expansion\r\nof forehead, and had received a good education; he was a freeman, and his\r\ncolour did not prevent him from mixing in the best society in the part of\r\nthe country to which he belonged; indeed, the Brazilians are perhaps more\r\nfree from those prejudices than any other nation. He was possessed of\r\nan immense fund of wit and humour, the continual flow of which kept the\r\nwhole party in good spirits during the journey, notwithstanding the great\r\nheat of the day.\r\n\r\nThe Fazenda dos Prazeres stands on a rather elevated knoll in a large\r\nvalley, which, at its upper extremity, is marshy and full of Buriti\r\npalms. On the dry sides of the low hills which surround the valley,\r\nthere are large forests of that palm called Palmeira, already spoken of\r\nas being common about Crato; and in the Catinga forest, which we rode\r\nthrough, one or two smaller kinds of palm were common. One of these had\r\nits stem forked at the summit, being the only instance of the kind I\r\never met with; the central bud had been destroyed by some means, and two\r\nmore arms generated in its stead. The house is large, well constructed,\r\nand by far the best we had seen since leaving Oeiras. The owner of it,\r\nwho died suddenly about a year before, seems to have been not only more\r\nindustrious, but a person of much greater taste than the generality of\r\nthe Piauhy fazendeiros. Around the house, and also to a considerable\r\ndistance from it, there were many fine orange trees loaded with fruit,\r\nwhich being very rare in this province, were highly prized by us. There\r\nwere also near the house large plantations of plantains and bananas, as\r\nalso several fine cocoa-nut trees, which were beginning to bear fruit.\r\nThese trees were the most distant from the coast I had met with in the\r\ncountry; and indeed it is but very seldom they are seen in cultivation\r\ninland, the tree being essentially of a sea-side growth. The estate is\r\nprincipally a cattle farm, but in the valley below the house there was a\r\nlarge patch of cane growing, from which they manufacture rapadura; and\r\nthe soil being favourable for the cultivation of mandiocca, a good deal\r\nof it is also grown. The widow, who with her sons now manages the farm,\r\nis both active and intelligent, and very hospitable. We remained here\r\ntwo days, during which time many people arrived from various quarters in\r\nthe neighbourhood, to avail themselves of the services of the Visitador.\r\nBefore we left, our provision boxes were well filled; and a large supply\r\nof oranges which we took with us, lasted for many days, and formed a\r\ngrateful refreshment on our journey.\r\n\r\nRecrossing the Rio Gurgea at a place called Flores, about sixteen\r\nleagues above the fazenda Dos Prazeres, and travelling for ten days in a\r\nsoutherly direction, more or less parallel with that river, we arrived at\r\na small hamlet called Rapoza. The country we found to be very level, and\r\ngenerally of an arid nature, particularly when we were obliged to travel\r\nat some distance from the river, for its banks are for the most part\r\nwell wooded, the trees consisting of the Jatobá Piki, several species\r\nof _Laurus_, large _Bignonias_, which at this season were covered with\r\ntheir bright yellow blossoms. Among these grew many climbing shrubs,\r\nsuch as _Bauhinias_, _Combretums_, _Bignonias_, _Malpighias_, &c., whose\r\nbranches, covered with their many-coloured flowers, gaily adorned the\r\nwide-spreading tops of the trees. Numerous large wild fig-trees also grow\r\nalong the side of the stream, which often afforded us shelter both by\r\nday and by night. It was quite refreshing to travel under this shade,\r\nand we found it the more so, as the country around produced only a few\r\nleafless trees, and the soil, which was of a brick-red colour, had its\r\nherbaceous vegetation quite destroyed. During this season, the cattle\r\nfrequent the margins of the river, both on account of the water, and the\r\ngrass and other herbage which grow there; but this year, the latter had\r\nbeen nearly destroyed by the great rise of the waters during the previous\r\nrains, which were said to have been heavier than any that had occurred\r\nsince the year 1820. We could see by the marks on the stems of the trees,\r\nleft by the muddy water, that it had risen ten feet above the level of\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\nAt Rapoza I met with Major José Martins de Sousa, to whom I carried\r\nletters from his uncle the Barão de Parnahiba. His house was about thirty\r\nleagues distant, but having been ordered to raise troops to send to the\r\ncity, he had made this place the general rendezvous. About four years\r\nbefore this period, he bought a tract of ground, in the district of\r\nParnaguá, amounting to about ninety-six square leagues, for five contos\r\nde reis, which he divided into six cattle farms, all of which were now\r\nin a flourishing condition. He told me that in the district, of which he\r\nwas Prefect, there were 1,700 men capable of bearing arms, but all he had\r\nbeen able to raise in the course of a week, were twenty-two. The whole\r\npopulation, he added, were worse than savages, and that no eloquence\r\ncould prevail on them to rise in defence of their country. He was even\r\nafraid that disorders, similar to those which were disturbing the\r\nprovince of Maranham, would not be long ere they reached this district;\r\nand he said it was his intention as soon as possible, to take his wife\r\nand children down to the city. This, I believe, he shortly afterwards\r\ndid, and it was well for them that he had this foresight, as about a\r\nmonth after I met him, the district of Parnaguá rose to join the rebels,\r\nand the major, who remained behind, had a very narrow escape from falling\r\na victim to the fury of the inhabitants, and the cattle on his estates\r\nwere nearly all destroyed. During his journey to the city, all his\r\nrecruits deserted, with the exception of two or three.\r\n\r\nA journey of fourteen leagues brought us to the Villa de Parnaguá,\r\nthe most southern town in the province, the country still continuing\r\nflat, and very similar to that through which we had already passed. The\r\nwhole journey from Oeiras, presented little that was interesting in a\r\ngeological point of view, the only rocks which occurred being of the\r\nsame character as those existing in the vicinity of the city itself. The\r\npeculiar construction of the houses on the road, so very different from\r\nthose met with in any other part of Brazil, or even in Piauhy itself,\r\nattracted my attention: they are built for the most part with one of\r\ntheir ends to the road, and in this end there is a large apartment with a\r\ntable and a form, evidently intended for the accommodation of travellers,\r\nas it has no direct communication with the rest of the house. The door\r\nof the part inhabited by the family, is in the other end, and on this\r\naccount it is very seldom that any of the females of the family are seen,\r\nthey being kept strictly secluded. Should the house stand parallel to the\r\nroad, then the door to the travellers’ apartment opens in front, while\r\nthe door and windows of the other apartments are all in the back part.\r\nA stranger may thus live at one of these houses for many days, without\r\nthe slightest knowledge of what is going on within. The ladies are not,\r\nhowever, destitute of curiosity, as I have frequently detected a pair of\r\nblack eyes peering through some slit in the fragile partitions to get a\r\npeep at the strangers. Yet, as a professional man, it was seldom I was\r\nnot admitted, being called in to prescribe for some one or other of the\r\nfemales of the family; the sedentary life which they lead rendering them\r\nvery subject to dyspeptic and such like complaints. Ague is also very\r\ncommon indeed, and nearly all the inhabitants suffer from the effects of\r\nit. Mr. Darwin, in his Journal, mentions that there are few houses in\r\nChili where a traveller will not be received for the night, but a trifle\r\nis expected to be given in the morning, and that even a rich man will\r\naccept two or three shillings. In Brazil this is very different; on the\r\nroad from Rio de Janeiro to the Mining Districts, which is now very much\r\nfrequented, there are always houses to be found which serve as apologies\r\nfor inns, and in which the traveller is expected to pay; but should he\r\nput up at any of the large fazendas he is allowed to sit free at the\r\ntable, paying only for such provender as his animals may require. In the\r\nmore distant parts of the country, I always met with the most unbounded\r\nhospitality, even from the poorer classes, and often the only recompense\r\nwhich these poor beings would accept was a little gunpowder or salt,\r\narticles which very often are not to be procured at any price.\r\n\r\nWhen I left Rapoza, Major Martins gave me a letter to the Juiz de Paz of\r\nParnaguá, and a note to receive the keys of an empty house in which he\r\nputs up when he visits the Villa. On our arrival, I found that the Juiz\r\nhad gone to visit his fazenda, at a distance of six or seven leagues.\r\nThe vicar and the other padre of the place were also absent, visiting\r\ntheir district. An old lawyer, the schoolmaster, and a shopkeeper were\r\nthe only persons of consequence we found in the place. The Villa, which\r\nis situated on the east side of a large lake, contains in all about a\r\nhundred houses, but not more than one half of them are inhabited, as many\r\nbelong to fazendeiros who only occupy them during the festival times.\r\nOwing to the recruiting which was then going on throughout the province,\r\nthe greater part of the male population had left the Villa and gone to\r\ndistant places, few being inclined to join the army; women and children\r\nonly were to be seen, with the exception of a few slaves. The houses are\r\ngenerally built of a coarse wicker-work, and plastered, both inside and\r\nout, with a red-coloured clay, which, not being white-washed, gives the\r\ntown a very strange appearance. The best days of the place seem to have\r\ngone by, as many of the houses are falling into ruins; and the church,\r\nwhich stands in a large square and has once been a neat building, is\r\nalso going to decay, one half of the roof has fallen in, and it seemed\r\nto have been in that state for some years. There is not a single regular\r\nshopkeeper in the place, the only one that we found there, had arrived\r\nsome time before from Bahia, and proposed to return as soon as he had\r\nsold his goods. Having no competitor, he took advantage of this, and was\r\nselling everything at a very exorbitant price. The people, both in the\r\nVilla and in the neighbouring fazendas, complained that the revolution\r\nin Maranham had prevented the merchants, who yearly visit them, from\r\ncoming to Parnaguá. These were in the habit of bringing up European\r\ngoods, salt, gunpowder, &c., which they generally exchanged for horses,\r\ncattle, and hides.\r\n\r\nSalt is an article for which there is a great demand, and the people\r\nin the Villa have found out a substitute for that which comes from the\r\ncoast. Along the banks of the lake, the soil in many places is highly\r\nimpregnated with saline matter, which, although mixed with saltpetre,\r\nis yet very acceptable where no other can be procured; during our visit\r\nmany people from distant parts were occupied in collecting this salt.\r\nThe manner in which they obtain it is as follows; the soil is cleaned of\r\ngrass and other herbaceous vegetation, and on being moistened with water,\r\nthe part richest in salt soon shows itself by the appearance of small\r\ncrystals. This earth is then scraped up with the scapular bone of an ox,\r\nand put into a trough made of a cow-hide, supported upon four short posts\r\nfixed in the ground. Water is then poured on the earth, which, during the\r\nspace of a day, is allowed to filter slowly through small holes in the\r\nbottom of the trough, when it is received into a large basin placed below\r\nit: the process is continued till the salt is all extracted. The water\r\nthus extracted is either put into smaller hide-troughs and evaporated in\r\nthe sun, or boiled down in an iron pot, but as these are rather scarce\r\narticles in Parnaguá, few only can have recourse to this mode. The salt\r\nis not very clean, but a quantity which I bought was found to preserve\r\nmeat very well.\r\n\r\nThe lake, near which the village is situated, is about two leagues long,\r\nand one broad, but it is said not to be deep; it is always of a red\r\ncolour, caused no doubt by the soil of the surrounding country, which is\r\neverywhere of a deep red-coloured clay. It is said to abound in fish, but\r\nduring our stay I could not obtain any. Great numbers of large alligators\r\nexist in it, as also boa constrictors, capivaras, and tapirs; I saw,\r\nbesides, some large otters, but could not come within shot of them. After\r\nwe arrived I went to bathe in the lake, and swam out a long way, but did\r\nnot do so again, on being told that several accidents had taken place,\r\nnot only from the attacks of alligators, but also from piranias.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a small Serra to the south-east, the country\r\naround the Villa is flat, and but for the lake, it would have a very\r\nunpicturesque appearance. I took several walks in the neighbourhood, but\r\nin consequence of the long-continued drought, I did not meet with much\r\nto reward my labour. In a marsh, which in the rainy season forms part\r\nof the lake, I found two species of water-lily (_Nymphæa_), both small\r\nand bearing white flowers, one of them smelling very sweetly, while the\r\nother had exactly the fœtid smell of coal-tar. On the Serra I found a\r\nsmall-leaved _Gomphia_, a _Triads_, and a tree-lily (_Vellozia_); the\r\nlatter was not in flower, as was the case with one I found at Oeiras.\r\nThese are the two most northerly stations in which I have met with\r\nspecies of this genus, whose great focus lies in the mountains of the\r\nDiamond District.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nPARNAGUÁ TO NATIVIDADE.\r\n\r\n    Leaves Parnaguá—Arrives at Saco do Tanque—Carrapatos a great\r\n    pest to Travellers and Cattle—Vegetation of the Country—Crosses\r\n    the Serras da Batalha and de Mato Grosso, the boundary of\r\n    the Province of Piauhy—Descends into the district of Rio\r\n    Preto—Account of the Cherente Indians—Arrives at Santa\r\n    Rosa—Crosses the River Preto—Reaches the desolate Region of\r\n    Os Geräes—Passes over the elevated table-land Chapada da\r\n    Mangabeira—Arrives at the Indian Mission of Duro—Description\r\n    of these Indians—Reaches Cachoeira—Crosses the Serra do\r\n    Duro—Fords the River Manoel Alves—Arrives at Almas—Galheiro\r\n    Morto—Morhinos—Abundance of Wild Honey—Description of several\r\n    kinds of Bees—Reaches Nossa Senhora d’Amparo—Mato Virgem—Goître\r\n    not uncommon—Passes Sociedade—Arraial da Chapada—And arrives at\r\n    Natividade.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was with much difficulty that I procured in Parnaguá a person to\r\nreplace the soldier who accompanied us from Oeiras; chance threw in my\r\nway a mulatto, who having come with a large drove of cattle from the\r\nprovince of Goyaz, was therefore acquainted with the tracks through the\r\nunfrequented country into which we were now about to enter. We left\r\nParnaguá on the 29th of September, and continuing our journey nearly\r\nin a southerly direction, we arrived at a little fazenda, called Saco\r\ndo Tanque, on the 7th of October, the distance being about twenty-six\r\nleagues. It was late in the afternoon when we left Parnaguá, and being\r\nnearly dark by the time we reached the head of the lake, we halted there\r\nfor the night under some trees. Towards morning we felt so chilly in our\r\nhammocks, that we were glad to get up and warm ourselves at a large fire,\r\nwhich the men kept burning all night. As we rode along the side of the\r\nlake, we saw several capivaras and alligators, which upon our coming\r\nnear them made for the water.\r\n\r\nShortly after leaving Oeiras, we began to be much tormented by a species\r\nof tick, to which the Brazilians give the name of carrapato. These\r\ninsects abound in dry bushy places, where they attach themselves to the\r\nslender twigs; at first they are very small (carrapatos miudos), and may\r\nbe seen in clusters consisting of many hundreds; these as soon as any\r\nanimal passes by and touches them, instantly adhere to it, burying their\r\nsuckers so deeply into its skin, that it is only by using considerable\r\nforce they can be withdrawn. If not taken off they go on increasing\r\nin bulk till they become as large, and even larger, than a common\r\nhorse-bean; they even increase in size on the grass and bushes, but then\r\nhave a lean flat appearance; it is to this form that the name carrapato\r\ngrande is given. Spix and Martius believe the large and small kinds to\r\nbe distinct species, but I think there can be no doubt that they are the\r\nsame insects in different stages; St. Hilare is of this opinion, and\r\nso are the inhabitants themselves. It is only in the beginning of the\r\ndry season that the small carrapato is to be found in those districts\r\nwhich are infested by them, but as the season advances, they gradually\r\ndisappear, to be replaced by the larger ones. They attach themselves\r\nindiscriminately to all kinds of quadrupeds, but the horse and the ox\r\nsuffer most from their attacks, and in very dry seasons they exist in\r\nsuch numbers, that whole herds of cattle perish from the exhaustion which\r\nthey produce. If, however, the animal on which they live can hold out\r\ntill the rains set in, it soon regains its strength, as wet is very fatal\r\nto the carrapato; I have frequently seen some of my horses that were\r\ninfested by these creatures, get nearly free from them after swimming\r\nacross a broad river. Some horses I found were much more subject to them\r\nthan others. We found the dry bushy country above Parnaguá swarming with\r\nthese pests, and almost every night, we had to pick hundreds of them off\r\nour bodies before we could turn into our hammocks. The men suffered more\r\nthan either Mr. Walker or myself, as they were on foot, and their legs\r\nwere bare from the knees downwards. When I walked out to botanize in the\r\nneighbourhood of the places where we encamped, I used generally to get\r\ncompletely covered with them, and had to change my dress, but by laying\r\nthe infested articles in the bright sun-shine for a quarter of an hour\r\nthey became fit to put on again. A favourite little ring-tailed monkey,\r\nwhich I obtained from an old Indian some days after we left Oeiras, also\r\nused to suffer very much from these insects. When full grown, a large\r\ncarrapato very much resembles the ripe seed of the castor oil tree. In\r\ndragging off very large ones, the wound which is left often becomes a\r\nvery bad sore. The carrapato belongs to the genus _Ixodes_, of Latreille.\r\n\r\nAlthough the country between Parnaguá and Saco do Tanque is comparatively\r\nlevel, yet there is a very perceptible rise; and although the general\r\nvegetation has very much the same character as that of other Catinga\r\ndistricts, many of the shrubs and trees were quite new to me. At this\r\nseason very few were in flower; of these, the most remarkable was a very\r\nlarge tree to which the name of Sicupíra is given by the inhabitants,\r\nand which I afterwards found extending far into the province of Goyaz;\r\nit belongs to the natural order _Leguminosæ_, and has only very\r\nrecently been described by Mr. Bentham, under the name of _Commilobium\r\npolygalæflorum_: it is easily recognised at a great distance by its\r\nnumerous large panicles of lilac flowers. An essential oil, which is\r\ncontained in the fruit, is much used by the inhabitants to alleviate\r\nthe pain of the tooth-ache. A very large silk-cotton tree (_Bombax_),\r\nentirely destitute of leaves, was also common, but on one of them I\r\nfound a few blossoms, which were of enormous size, measuring when fully\r\nexpanded about a foot and a half across; the petals were of a dark brown\r\ncolour without, but white within. Near a fazenda called Riacho d’Area,\r\nwhere we stopped a day, grew a number of large palm trees, on the stems\r\nof which I found a large fleshy-stemmed orchideous plant, a species of\r\n_Cyrtopodium_, which produced flowering stems about four feet high,\r\nterminating in a large panicle of flowers, with brown blotches on an\r\norange ground, and smelling sweetly like wall-flower.\r\n\r\nIn marshy bushy places on this journey I saw many plants of the _Vanilla\r\nplanifolia_, seldom bearing flowers, and more rarely producing fruit.\r\nIt has now been satisfactorily determined, that this is the species\r\nfrom which the true Vanilla of commerce is procured. In Mexico it is\r\nextensively cultivated for the sake of its fruit, which it yields\r\nabundantly; while the plants which have been introduced into the East\r\nIndies, and the hot-houses of Europe, though they have frequently\r\nproduced flowers, have very seldom perfected their fruit. Dr. Morren\r\nof Liège was the first to study attentively the natural history of\r\nthis plant, and to prove experimentally that the fruit of the Vanilla\r\nmay be as freely produced in our hot-houses as it is in Mexico. He has\r\ndiscovered that from some peculiarities in the reproductive organs of\r\nthis plant, artificial fecundation is required. In the year 1836, a\r\nplant in one of the hot-houses in the botanic garden at Liège produced\r\nfifty-four flowers, which having been artificially fecundated, exhibited\r\nthe same number of pods, quite equal to those imported from Mexico; and\r\nin 1837, a fresh crop of about a hundred pods was obtained upon another\r\nplant by the same method. He attributes the fecundation of the plant\r\nin Mexico to the action of some insect which frequents the flower; and\r\nhence accounts for the non-production of fruit in those plants, which\r\nhave been removed to other countries. There can be no doubt that this\r\nplant is as perfectly indigenous to Brazil, as it is to Mexico; but it\r\nis no less certain that its fruit is there seldom matured. Is this also\r\nto be attributed to the absence of the means by which nature is supposed\r\nto effect fecundation in Mexico? This is a subject which, as Professor\r\nMorren justly observes, well deserves attention in a commercial point\r\nof view, since his experiments go to prove, that in all intertropical\r\ncountries, vanilla might be cultivated, and a great abundance of fruit\r\nobtained.[9]\r\n\r\nThe country in which we were travelling, is much infested by the Onça\r\nof the inhabitants, the _Felis onca_ of Linnæus, which is also known\r\nby the name of Jaguar. In our encampments, we used to hear them night\r\nafter night roaring at some distance, but they never came near enough\r\nto be seen. The night we remained at Riacho d’Area, we were prevented\r\nfrom sleeping during the early part of it, by the loud roaring of one of\r\nthese animals, which was so distinct and audible that it appeared to be\r\nwithin a short distance; but the fazendeiro, who was more accustomed to\r\nthe sound, assured me it was at least half a league distant, and from its\r\nnoise he supposed it to be a very large male; its roar was more like the\r\ngrowl of an angry dog, which generally continued for a quarter of an hour\r\nat a time, when it terminated by a sound, two or three times repeated,\r\nnot unlike the smothered bark of a large mastiff. The dogs belonging to\r\nthe fazenda were on the alert and barking, but none of them offered to\r\nleave the house. My horses which were feeding at a little distance, came\r\ncloser to us, when they heard the almost unearthly sounds produced by\r\nthe fierce inhabitant of the forests; even those I had brought from the\r\ncoast, and which I am certain had never been exposed to the attacks of\r\nthese animals, followed the example of the others.\r\n\r\nThe Fazenda de Saco do Tanque is situated immediately on the boundary\r\nline between the province of Piauhy, and the south-west portion of that\r\nof Pernambuco, which is known by the name of the district of the Rio\r\nPreto. Shortly after entering this district, we reached an elevated\r\ntable-land called the Serra da Batalha, which it was necessary to cross;\r\nit is about the height of the Serra de Araripe at Crato, and like it,\r\nis covered with an ever-verdant vegetation. The ascent is a very rugged\r\none, consisting of large blocks of coarse white sandstone, of which the\r\nSerra appeared to be composed. At the foot of this Serra, and on the\r\nascent itself, I made one of the finest collections of plants I had met\r\nwith since leaving Oeiras. In moist sandy places at its foot grow some\r\nof those beautiful large-flowered small-leaved _Melastomaceæ_ which\r\nare so abundant in the gold and diamond districts; while on the more\r\nelevated sandy tracts I found immense quantities of a kind of nutmeg\r\n(_Myristica_), which does not grow more than three feet high. The trees\r\non the Chapada itself consisted chiefly of the Cashew, Piki, Jatobá,\r\nMangába, Sicupíra, _Gomphia hexasperma_, and an arboreous _Bignonia_;\r\nbut intermingled with these, there were many beautiful trees and shrubs,\r\nwhich I had not before met with.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the Chapada which is three leagues in breadth, the descent\r\nis very gradual, and ultimately merges into a marshy plain abounding in\r\nBuriti palms. The whole country here bore a very different aspect from\r\nthat which we had left behind us, the vegetation being fresh and verdant,\r\nwhich was a great relief to the eye, after having been so long accustomed\r\nto leafless trees, and a bare soil of red clay. The woods were all\r\nevergreen, and between the clusters of noble Buriti palms and the wooded\r\nparts of the country, there were large open marshy Campos covered with\r\ngrass, and other herbaceous vegetation common to marshy tracts.\r\n\r\nWe were now in a country much infested by the incursions of wild Indians,\r\nand many of the more solitary habitations had, some time before our\r\narrival, been abandoned by their possessors on that account. After riding\r\nabout half a mile along the side of the first open tract we came to,\r\nwe reached one of these deserted dwellings, and a little beyond it, we\r\nput up in another also uninhabited. At Saco do Tanque, we were informed\r\nthat these houses had been abandoned in consequence of an attack which\r\nthe Indians had made on another, a few months before, a league or two\r\nto the westward, when all the inhabitants were put to death. As I had\r\nmany of my recent collections to put in order, and as this appeared a\r\nfavourable spot for botanizing, I remained here a day. There was also\r\ngood pasture for the horses, and they, as well as ourselves, had need of\r\nrest. I was not disappointed in the few short rambles which I took in the\r\nneighbourhood, as I met with several remarkable plants, quite different\r\nfrom any I had before seen; among these were an _Eryngium_, a _Jussiæa_,\r\nwhich formed a small tree about twenty feet high, a tree-fern, the only\r\none I had seen since I left Crato, and a few curious _Eriocaulons_ from\r\nthe marshes. In the deserted house in which we took up our quarters, we\r\nwere dreadfully annoyed both by musquitos and chigoes (_Bich de Pé_).\r\n\r\nLeaving Batalha, the name of the place at which we were encamped, a\r\njourney of three long leagues brought us to the fazenda of Santa Rosa.\r\nWe had not gone far when we had to ascend another Serra, but lower than\r\nthat of Batalha, the top of which forms a Chapada about a league broad.\r\nHaving crossed this, a very slight ascent brought us to the top of a\r\nthird elevated plane, called the Serra do Mato Grosso, from the dense\r\nforest with which it is covered. These three Serras may more correctly\r\nbe considered as one great one, than as distinct ranges, since we found\r\nthe descent from the last about equal in height to the ascent of the\r\nfirst, and both much greater than the intermediate ones; the south side\r\nalso, like the north, was covered with large blocks of sandstone. We\r\nnow entered the valley of Santa Rosa, which tends southward for about\r\na league and a half; in the middle of this runs a small stream of the\r\nmost limpid water I have ever seen, and on each side of it grows a strip\r\nof tall and beautiful Buriti palms, affording food and shelter to vast\r\nnumbers of the three kinds of Maccaw already described. Near the top of\r\nthe valley there is a large lake, and another about the middle of it,\r\nfed by the small stream, partly surrounded by the Buriti, and partly\r\nby a much smaller palm, which very much resembles it, but its stem is\r\nthickly covered by long sharp spines; this, which I afterwards found to\r\nbe very common in the marshy Campos of the province of Goyaz, is called\r\nBuritizana. This beautiful valley is about a league broad at its widest\r\npart, where the fazenda of the same name is situated, and is bounded on\r\nthe north-west side by the Serra do Livramento, about equal in height\r\nwith the Serra do Mato Grosso, which bounds it on the north-east side.\r\n\r\nShortly before we reached the descent of the Serra, the great variety of\r\nnew plants which I found growing there, caused me to linger far behind\r\nthe troop, but as this was very frequently the case, the men took no\r\nnotice of it. I did not often keep one of them with me, as my eye, from\r\nlong practice, had become well acquainted with the track of the troop,\r\nfrom the appearance of the horses’ and the men’s foot-marks; and here,\r\nmoreover, the road had been so long free from travellers, that there\r\nseemed no chance of any mistake occurring. In this, however, I was\r\ndeceived, for although I traced them to the lower part of the upper\r\nlake, where the ground was very soft, and much trodden by the cattle and\r\nhorses that came there to drink; beyond this muddy tract, which was of\r\nconsiderable size, I could not trace the foot-marks of my troop, although\r\nI spent a long time in trying to do so. It is well understood among\r\ntravellers in these desert parts of Brazil, that if one of the party\r\nshould by any chance remain behind, and be unable to find the track of\r\nhis companions, he is to remain in the neighbourhood of the spot where\r\nhe first lost it, so that he may the more readily be found by those who\r\nreturn to look for him. Acting upon this, and feeling certain that before\r\nnight some one of my party would be sent in search of me, I returned to\r\nthe foot of the Serra, and, under some shady trees by the road-side,\r\ndismounted, and tying the fore-legs of my horse with the bridle, so that\r\nhe might feed, and not stray, I sat down under one of the trees to study\r\nattentively the plants which I had collected during my morning’s ride. My\r\nonly fear was lest any of the wandering tribes of Indians, who were known\r\nto be in the neighbouring woods, should happen to come across me, for in\r\nconsequence of the persecution they have received from the Brazilians,\r\nthey consider every white man they encounter lawful game to shoot at and\r\ndestroy. It was not till late in the afternoon that Mr. Walker, finding I\r\ndid not make my appearance, sent one of the men to look for me; and when\r\nwe returned to the place where I had been unable to follow the track, I\r\nfound they had passed over to the other side of the lake by a very narrow\r\npath, which was completely covered over with long grass.\r\n\r\nFinding the proprietor of the fazenda of Santa Rosa, Senhor Antonio Jozé\r\nde Guimerãens, very civil and obliging, I determined to remain there\r\nfor some days, to make the necessary arrangements for entering upon a\r\njourney of upwards of forty leagues through an entirely uninhabited\r\ncountry. My collections made between Parnaguá and Santa Rosa, were to be\r\narranged and packed up, and it was with considerable difficulty that I\r\ncould find an additional horse to purchase. Our host had not one to part\r\nwith that would answer my purpose, but he kindly accompanied Mr. Walker\r\nto a fazenda about five leagues distant, and assisted him in procuring\r\none. Our provision boxes also required to be replenished, and for this\r\npurpose an ox was purchased, and its flesh prepared by drying in the\r\nsun. No farinha was to be had at Santa Rosa, but our host went himself\r\nto another fazenda about four leagues to the eastward, and bought me a\r\nload. We could not, however, purchase the hide boxes which were necessary\r\nfor carrying my collections; these we were obliged to make ourselves,\r\nunder the superintendence of Mr. Walker, who was very expert in all\r\nthat related to the equipment of the troop. During the twelve days that\r\nwe found it necessary to remain at this place, I lost no opportunity\r\nof adding to my collections, by excursions in the neighbourhood, but\r\nparticularly to the Serras which form the boundaries of the valley. One\r\nof the finest trees I ever remember to have seen standing alone, grew by\r\nthe side of, a small brook which flowed at a little distance from the\r\nhouse; it was a species of _Qualea_, with a clean straight stem about one\r\nhundred feet in height, on which it supported a wide-spreading top of\r\nbranches; as it came into flower shortly after our arrival, and as there\r\nwas no other way of obtaining specimens than by cutting the tree down,\r\nSenhor Guimerãens himself proposed to do so, as soon as he knew I wished\r\nto possess a few specimens. After about two hours’ labour on the part\r\nof himself and two of my men, this fine tree, which I was sorry to see\r\ndestroyed, came to the ground with a tremendous crash.\r\n\r\nIt was on the morning of the 21st of September that we left Santa Rosa,\r\nand a journey of nearly three leagues brought us to the north bank of the\r\nRio Preto, a stream which gives origin to the name of the district, and\r\nwhich takes its rise on the eastern side of the Serra do Duro, and falls\r\ninto the Rio de San Francisco, a little above Villa da Barra. Following\r\nthe course of this river downwards for about a quarter of a mile, we\r\narrived at the ferry which leads to the fazenda of Santa Maria, which\r\nstands on the opposite side. At this place the river is about thirty\r\nyards broad, is very deep and the current is very rapid; at a distance,\r\nthe water appears black as ink, and from this circumstance it takes its\r\nname, but when close to it the water is so clear, that the bottom can be\r\nseen at a great depth; we could also see that it was inhabited by numbers\r\nof fine fish. Our luggage was taken over by an old Indian in a canoe,\r\nwhich was so small that only one horse-load could be transported at a\r\ntime. We took up our mid-day quarters under the wide-spreading branches\r\nof a large Cashew tree, but the shade which this kind of tree yields,\r\ndoes not shelter well from the rays of the sun, as it is never very\r\nthickly covered with leaves. We all bathed in the waters of the beautiful\r\nstream, and rejoiced that for several days to come, we should still have\r\nthis enjoyment, as our route to the westward lay along its margin. There\r\nis nothing so refreshing to the traveller in a tropical climate, as\r\nfrequent ablution in cold water. We were not far from the house on which\r\nthe outrage I have before mentioned was committed by the Indians; the\r\nattack was made during the day, while the men were absent in the fields,\r\nand after burning the house, and killing three women, they carried\r\noff two children. The people at Santa Maria informed me they lived in\r\nconstant dread of the Indians, and that they had serious intentions of\r\nremoving to a more populous district. These Indians live generally at a\r\nconsiderable distance to the north-west, only extending their excursions\r\ninto this neighbourhood when in pursuit of game, and are known by the\r\nname of Cherentes. It is supposed this attack originated in consequence\r\nof one of the Indians having been fired at, and wounded by mistake, who\r\nin revenge had, with the assistance of some of his countrymen, committed\r\nthe outrage above mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe desolate tract of country, upwards of forty leagues in breadth,\r\nwhich we were now about to cross, in order to reach the province of\r\nGoyaz, is called by the people of the country Os Geräes. It is seldom\r\ntraversed except by drovers, who take cattle from the north of Goyaz to\r\nBahia. There is, however, a path through it, and the mulatto I engaged at\r\nParnaguá, having once traversed it, was to act as our guide. From him I\r\nlearned that there was only one habitation to be met with, a small hut,\r\noccasionally occupied by an old man, half Indian, half Portuguese; but\r\nthis was of no importance to me, as I had laid in a sufficient stock of\r\nprovisions for our journey. The stories he told of the Indians, alarmed\r\nmy party very much; and I was in consequence obliged to get all my arms\r\nput in order, so as to make as formidable an appearance as possible. I\r\ncarried a small brace of pocket pistols besides those in my holsters,\r\nand had a large sword-knife in my belt. Mr. Walker, besides the usual\r\ndagger-knife of the Brazilians, carried a small sword; and the men were\r\neach armed with a gun; happily we had no occasion to make use of our\r\nweapons. The country people have all a great dread of this wild and\r\nuninhabited tract, and before entering it I was often asked if I was not\r\nafraid to do so with so few attendants. Their own fear is, I believe,\r\ngreatly owing to their cowardice, a very common feeling in all parts\r\nof the country I have visited. My mind was too much occupied with the\r\nanticipations of the rich harvest of novelties I expected to meet with,\r\nto think much of these dangers; the whole country I had gone over since I\r\nhad left the coast at Aracaty was virgin ground to the naturalist, with\r\nthe exception of Oeiras, which was passed through by Spix and Martius on\r\ntheir journey from Bahia to Maranham.\r\n\r\nWe entered the Geräes on the afternoon of the same day we arrived at\r\nSanta Maria, but the first part of our journey was far from auspicious.\r\nOur route was westward along the banks of the Rio Preto, which was lined\r\nwith Buriti and Buritizana palms, and numerous flowering shrubs. After\r\nwe had gone about two leagues, the sky to the westward became very\r\nblack, and shortly afterwards distant thunder was heard. We halted by\r\nthe side of the river under some large trees, but before we could get\r\na shelter arranged the storm reached us. The lightning was very vivid,\r\nthe thunder loud, and the rain came pouring down in torrents; by fixing\r\nup two large hides to the branches above us, they afforded a tolerable\r\nshelter. As soon as the storm passed over we enlarged our house, so as\r\nto have a place of refuge in case it should return, and it was well we\r\ndid so, for having slung our hammocks as usual between the trees, we\r\nwere aroused about midnight by a loud peal of thunder which broke right\r\nover our heads, and as the rain fell heavily we were obliged to take\r\nrefuge in our house of hides. I thought there was something more awful\r\nin this storm than in any I had ever experienced, but this feeling was\r\nperhaps augmented by the solitude in which we found ourselves. It may be\r\nasked why I did not take a tent with me? I might have done so, but in\r\ntravelling, I made it a rule to conform to the habits of the country,\r\nand in the north of Brazil no one ever thinks of carrying a tent. Long\r\njourneys are always avoided in the rainy season, and as the dry season\r\ngenerally lasts more than seven months, that period is always selected\r\nfor this purpose. These thunder storms are invariably the precursors to\r\nthe setting in of the heavy continual rains, but we hoped before that\r\ntime to reach some town in the north of the province of Goyaz, where we\r\nmight halt till the proper season for travelling would again come round.\r\n\r\nOn the second day we made a journey of about six leagues; sometimes our\r\nroute led through dense forests by the side of the river, at other times\r\nthrough open grassy meadows in which grew clusters of the Buriti palms,\r\nand at intervals over slightly elevated flat tracts, covered with low\r\nbushes, and abundance of a large grotesque-looking tree Lily (_Vellozia_)\r\non which I vainly looked for flowers, as they are only produced in the\r\ndry season. We halted during the middle of the day, but only for a short\r\ntime, at a rude hut of palm leaves, which had been erected by some\r\nprevious traveller, by the wooded margin of a beautiful grassy meadow\r\nabout a quarter of a mile square. Late in the afternoon the sky to the\r\nwestward began to assume a lowering aspect, and shortly presented all\r\nthe appearance of an approaching thunder storm. We pushed on as quickly\r\nas the nature of the road would allow, as our guide assured us we were\r\nnot far distant from the habitation of an old Indian. The lightning\r\nsoon commenced, and the rolling of thunder was heard in the distance;\r\ngradually it came nearer to us, and the western sky from the horizon to\r\nthe zenith was from time to time filled with one sheet of bluish flame,\r\nwhich, while it lasted, rendered the close of the twilight almost as\r\nbright as day. Thanks to our good fortune, the storm did not then reach\r\nus, having been diverted to the northward: passing over a high Serra\r\nwhich lay in that direction, it again altered its course, and followed\r\nfast upon our heels. It was quite dark when we arrived at the solitary\r\ndwelling, and when I rode to the little gate in front of it, the owner\r\ncame out with a gun in his hand. He immediately granted us permission to\r\ntake shelter for the night in an open shed, and as soon as the luggage\r\nhad been arranged in it, and a few large skins had been hung up on the\r\nweather side, the storm broke over the hut in all its fury, accompanied\r\nby a gale of wind which quickly extinguished our lights, and we had\r\nreason to be thankful that the whole building was not carried away before\r\nit: uncomfortable as the place was, we rejoiced in having even such\r\nshelter as it afforded.\r\n\r\nThe old man informed me that he lived in constant fear of an attack from\r\nthe Cherentes. He had been in this solitary place for three years, but\r\nhad now made up his mind to leave it in the course of a few months. His\r\nwife had been dead about a year, and he and three little children were\r\nthe only inhabitants of the place. He had two houses, the best of which\r\nwas at one end of the shed in which we were stowed, but he had never\r\nlived in it; the reason he assigned was, that the Indians when they\r\nattack a house, immediately set fire to it, and surround it, so that no\r\none may escape. The hut in which he resided was at some distance from\r\nthe other, and in appearance was but little better than a pig-sty, but\r\nhe said that in case of an attack, he could very easily make his escape\r\nfrom it to the woods. He had a very small piece of ground cleared by the\r\nside of the river, in which grew some mandiocca, Indian corn, cotton,\r\nand bananas. He possessed no cattle of his own, but I was afterwards\r\ninformed that he was very expert in stealing oxen, from the droves which\r\noccasionally pass on their way to the coast.\r\n\r\nThree days after we left this habitation, we arrived at a place where\r\nthe Rio Preto divides the Province of Pernambuco from that of Goyaz.\r\nThe country we passed through was very similar to the first part of the\r\nGeräes, with the exception of the last four leagues of our journey\r\nwhich lay through an undulating elevated region destitute of arboreous\r\nvegetation; the soil was of a white sandy nature, thinly covered with\r\ndwarf shrubs, and small dry tufts of grass: it was only here and there\r\nthat a small stunted tree made its appearance among the bushes: as we\r\napproached the river, however, the country became more flat and better\r\nwooded. Notwithstanding the arid nature of this tract, its scanty\r\nvegetation was, with few exceptions, quite new to me. The moister sandy\r\nplaces afforded me several of those curious _Eriocaulons_, of which so\r\nmany exist in my collections, one of these, which I found shortly before\r\nwe reached the river, was a large branched species about five feet in\r\nheight; these remarkable forms I afterwards met with in great abundance\r\nin the Diamond District, which is the great centre of the _Eriocaulons_,\r\nas it is of the _Vellozias_, or tree-lily tribe. The river we here found\r\nto be about forty feet broad, and not less than from sixteen to twenty\r\nfeet in depth; the current was still rapid, and the water so limpid,\r\nthat the bottom could be seen quite distinctly. Several large Buriti\r\npalms grow on its banks, and the bridge by which we crossed, was one of\r\nthese trees cut down, so as to fall across the stream. It was not without\r\nconsiderable trouble, that we got all our luggage taken to the other\r\nside, which when accomplished, the horses were swum over a little further\r\nup the river. At about two hundred yards from its banks we encamped under\r\na large Myrtle tree (_Myrica_), where we remained a day, for I found it\r\nto be an excellent place for my researches. In a marsh by the side of\r\nthe river, I collected specimens of an _Isoetes_, which does not appear\r\nto differ from the one (_Isoetes lacustris_, Linn.) which grows in Great\r\nBritain. The sight of this plant recalled pleasing recollections of long\r\npast times, and I could not refrain from indulging in a lengthened train\r\nof reflections, which ended by comparing it with myself—a stranger in a\r\nstrange land, and associated with still stranger companions.\r\n\r\nOur next journey, which was one of four long leagues, through an arid,\r\nundulating, sandy, thinly-wooded country, brought us to the foot of\r\nthe Chapada da Mangabeira, an elevated level table-land, nearly forty\r\nmiles broad. On this journey we were dreadfully scorched by a burning\r\nsun; not a breath of wind was to be felt, and we all suffered very much\r\nfrom thirst, as not a drop of water was to be met with, and the men had\r\nneglected to fill the large leathern bag (boracho) before we started.\r\nShortly after leaving Oeiras, I was obliged to provide myself with\r\none of these necessary articles; it held about two gallons, and when\r\nfull, was carried between the two side loads of one of the horses. We\r\nencamped beneath a large Piki tree, not far from a spring of cool clear\r\nwater which emptied itself into a large morass. As this is the last\r\nwatering-place to be met with till the Chapada is crossed, the usual way\r\nof proceeding is to leave it about mid-day, and push on without stopping\r\ntill half of the distance has been performed; and by leaving again early\r\non the following morning, the next watering-place may be gained in the\r\nforenoon.\r\n\r\nOn the day succeeding that on which we arrived at the foot of the\r\nChapada, we started to cross it about one o’clock in the afternoon. The\r\nhorses were previously allowed to drink freely, and I took care that the\r\nleathern bag was not neglected this time. After travelling about half\r\na league, we entered by a gradual ascent upon the Chapada, and at the\r\nsame time were overtaken by a thunder storm, which, however, passed over\r\nwithout wetting us much. After a journey of five leagues, we arrived at\r\na place where there are a few small trees, and under them we halted for\r\nthe night. Tor the first league and a half, the Chapada was thinly-wooded\r\nwith small trees, which became gradually smaller and thinner, till at\r\nlast not one was to be seen; only a few stunted shrubs, from a foot to\r\na foot and a half high, exist on this barren spot; and the only living\r\nthing we saw, was a kind of locust, about two inches long, which rose in\r\nclouds before the horses. Many skeletons of horses and oxen lay on both\r\nsides of the path no doubt the remains of animals which on crossing this\r\ndesert tract, had become exhausted, and died from want of water. After\r\nthe thunder storm passed over, the sky became clear and unclouded and the\r\nsunset was one of the most beautiful I have ever seen, its splendour, and\r\nthe ocean-like plain over which we were travelling, reminded me of those\r\nI have so often seen at sea, between the tropics. The atmosphere, too,\r\nwas delightfully cool, and heavily laden with the rich perfume of one of\r\nthe small shrubs then in flower, which grew in the greatest profusion;\r\nthis shrub, which I afterwards found to be the _Spiranthera odoratissima_\r\nof St. Hilaire, grows in small clusters, and bears large corymbs of\r\npure white flowers larger than those of the honeysuckle, but not unlike\r\nthem in shape, although their odour more resembles that of the Jasmine.\r\nShortly after we reached our resting-place, the sky again became clouded\r\ntowards the west, and there was much lightning, which made us fear\r\nanother storm. As usual, we slung our hammocks between the trees, and,\r\ncontrary to our expectations, passed the night without rain.\r\n\r\nWe resumed our journey again as early as possible after daybreak, and\r\nhaving accomplished five leagues more, the greater part of which was\r\nalong one of the worst roads we had yet encountered, we halted under some\r\nlarge trees close to a marsh, on the south-west side of the Chapada.\r\nAt about half a league from where we slept, the descent of the Chapada\r\nbegins, and from thence a fine view of a large plain below is obtained,\r\nwhich is almost entirely surrounded by a chain of low hills, several of\r\nwhich to the south are of a conical form; the descent is very rocky,\r\nand on both sides of the road stand a great many isolated columnar and\r\nwall-like portions, which give the traveller the idea that he is passing\r\nthrough the ruins of a large city, destroyed by some great catastrophe.\r\nThe rock is a conglomerate, and as many of the rounded stones of which\r\nit is composed are of considerable size, this resemblance becomes the\r\nmore striking. This side of the Chapada is entirely composed of a coarse\r\nsandstone, which in some places is much softer than in others, and the\r\nruin-like portions have, no doubt, been formed by the disintegration of\r\nthose of a softer texture. On the descent, we had often to dismount and\r\nlead our horses; one of the pack-horses fell, and rolled over several\r\ntimes before he could regain a footing. As soon as we reached the marsh,\r\nthe horses rushed into the water to quench their thirst, before they\r\ncould be unloaded, and although it was still early in the day when we\r\narrived, I determined to remain here till the following morning, so that\r\nthey might rest. The evening was again cloudy, with thunder and lightning\r\nin the distance, which induced us to construct our huts of skins, that we\r\nmight be sheltered in case of rain; but none, however, fell.\r\n\r\nEarly on the following morning, we started with the intention of going\r\ndirect to Duro, an Indian mission about four leagues distant, but when\r\nwe were within about a league of it, we entered upon a wrong road, and\r\nhad gone nearly two leagues, before the man who acted as our guide,\r\ndiscovered his mistake; it being then about the middle of the day, we\r\nhalted to take breakfast under the shade of a large _Vochysia_, which\r\noverhung a spring of limpid water; but we had no sooner taken possession\r\nof this spot, than our right to it was called in question by some\r\nthousands of a small bee, not so large as a common house-fly; they came\r\nbuzzing about in all directions, from the hollow stem of the large tree\r\nin which they had their habitation; they had no sting, but they annoyed\r\nus very much, by flying about the face, and getting entangled in the\r\nhair. After kindling a large fire, they soon became less troublesome;\r\nthe only one of our party who seemed to be much alarmed at them, was my\r\nlittle monkey, who when they came swarming about his head, covered it\r\nwith his hands, and screaming fearfully, leaped upon me, and hid himself\r\nunder my jacket.\r\n\r\nThe country over which we passed before reaching this place, is of an\r\nundulating character, consisting generally of large open campos, the soil\r\nof which is principally a white sand, and being but scantily covered\r\nwith herbaceous vegetation, the glare caused by the bright sun-shine was\r\nvery fatiguing to the eyes. On these campos, as well as on the Chapada\r\nda Mangabeira, a dwarf cashew is very abundant, growing gregariously,\r\nand not more than a foot high; I found it both in flower and in fruit,\r\nbut the latter is not much larger than a gooseberry. It seems to be\r\ndistinct from the arboreous species, and is called by the Brazilians\r\nCajú rasteiro. Although the hilly parts of the country are dry, and have\r\nan arid look, the little hollows or valleys which intersect them, have\r\nalways a small stream of clear and cool water flowing through them, and\r\nare generally well wooded. About half a mile from the Aldea of Duro, we\r\novertook an Indian who was returning from the woods, and who conducted\r\nus to the house of one of their two captains, of whom we made enquiries\r\nabout a house to put up in, but he knew of none. After some time, we\r\nwere permitted to occupy one not yet finished, being open all round, but\r\nwell roofed; by means of some hides, we, however, contrived to render it\r\nsomewhat comfortable. As I found it necessary to remain here for several\r\ndays, I was well pleased to have the use of this habitation, as it was\r\nnot safe to trust ourselves in the open air, now that the rains were\r\nsetting in.\r\n\r\nThe mission of Duro is situated on the Serra of the same name, upon a low\r\nflat hill, round the western base of which, flows a small stream, called\r\nthe Riacho de Sucuriú, which at all seasons, supplies the inhabitants\r\nwith abundance of excellent water. The Aldea itself contains about twenty\r\nhouses, all of which are of the most miserable description; the greater\r\npart of them are entirely made of a frame-work of poles covered over with\r\npalm-leaves, and many of them are so much decayed from the united effects\r\nof time and weather, that they no longer form a barrier against wind or\r\nrain; others, which are built of wicker-work and clay, are scarcely in a\r\nbetter condition. They are so arranged as to form an irregular square,\r\nbut two of the sides still remain nearly open; on the west side, there\r\nis a small church almost in ruins, with a beautiful large Genipapo tree\r\nin front. The mission contains in all twelve square leagues of country,\r\nbeing the grant made to it at its original formation by the Jesuits,\r\nand over this space, there are scattered twenty or thirty other houses.\r\nThe entire population, at the time of my visit, amounted to about 250\r\nsouls; although the greater part of them are of pure Indian breed, some\r\nof them have mixed with the blacks, who from time to time, have taken\r\nup their residence among them, many of these have been runaway slaves.\r\nIt is very easy, however, to recognise the pure Indian, by his reddish\r\ncolour, long straight hair, high cheek bones, and the peculiar obliquity\r\nof his eyes. Notwithstanding that the present race has been brought up\r\nin a comparative state of civilization, they still retain many of the\r\ncharacteristics of the savage state. A few of the more respectable of\r\nthem dress in the same manner as the Brazilians of the Sertão, viz., in\r\na short pair of cotton drawers, with a shirt of the same stuff hanging\r\nloose over them; others make use of the drawers only, which are generally\r\nfar from being clean, and are made of a very coarse kind of stuff wrought\r\nby the women. The dress of the latter is also very simple; a few wear a\r\nchemise, and petticoat made of printed calico, but by far the greater\r\nnumber have only a petticoat of the same coarse material that the men\r\nwear, tied round their middle, all above which is bare. The girls run\r\nabout quite naked till they are nine or ten years of age, and the boys\r\ntill they are from twelve to fourteen. Some of the young girls have very\r\npleasing countenances, which, however, they do not long retain, judging\r\nfrom the looks of the older women.\r\n\r\nAlthough both the soil and climate of the mission are well adapted\r\nfor the cultivation of the various productions of the tropics, the\r\ninhabitants are so indolent, that they are generally in a state of\r\nstarvation; I could procure neither farinha de mandiocca, rice, yams,\r\nsweet potatoes, plantains, nor bananas, and when we arrived, our stock\r\nof beef being quite exhausted, it was with the greatest difficulty I\r\nsucceeded in purchasing a cow. All the cattle which exist in the mission\r\namount only to about forty, and these belong to two individuals. They\r\npossess altogether only seventeen horses. The principal part of the food\r\nof these people is of a vegetable nature, consisting of wild fruits which\r\nthey obtain from the woods, such as the nuts of different kinds of palms,\r\nthe fruit of the Pika, Pusá, Mangába, Jatobá, Pitomba, Guava, Araçá,\r\n&c. At the season we were among them, the principal fruit they made use\r\nof, was a kind of palm nut, about an inch and a half long, which they\r\ncalled Shódó. They first cut the fleshy substance, which corresponds\r\nwith the fibrous portion of the cocoa-nut, and a large stone which is\r\ngenerally placed at the door, is used for breaking the nut upon, in\r\norder to procure the substance within. Numbers of these Indians used to\r\nstart early in the morning, being roused by a kind of drum, and go to\r\nthe woods to the westward to collect these nuts, and during the day\r\nnothing was to be heard in the Aldea, but the breaking of them between\r\nthe two stones. The little animal food they do eat, is procured by\r\nhunting, and this is an occupation which the young men are much fonder\r\nof, than working in a plantation. A few days after we arrived, thirteen\r\nor fourteen of them set off on a hunting excursion to the other side\r\nof the Chapada da Mangabeira, and after an absence of eight days, they\r\nreturned well loaded with the flesh of deer, and of the large kind of\r\nPeccary (Queixado), in a half-roasted state, this being the plan they\r\nmake use of, for preserving it for a few days, having no salt for curing\r\nit. On their return to the Aldea, this spoil was divided among their\r\nfriends; it was all immediately devoured without salt or any kind of\r\nvegetable, except a few small capsicums. On the following day, scarcely\r\nan Indian was to be seen stirring abroad; like the boa constrictor, they\r\nwere sleeping away the effects of their over-dose of food. When our cow\r\nwas killed, I was fearful we should not be allowed to keep any of it\r\nto ourselves; for one came begging the head, another the feet, a third\r\nthe liver, and so on, with all the internal parts; and when these were\r\nexhausted, they even began to ask for pieces of the beef itself.\r\n\r\nTill within the last ten years, they had a resident priest among them,\r\nbut since that period, they have been without any; once a year, they\r\nhave a few days’ visit from one residing in the Villa de Natividade,\r\nthirty leagues distant, where their marriages are celebrated, and their\r\nchildren baptized. There is no school in the Aldea, and the only persons\r\nwho can read and write are the two captains, one of whom is a man about\r\nforty years of age; the other, who is called Luiz Francisco Pinto, was\r\nthen in his seventy-fourth year, and from him I obtained nearly all my\r\ninformation regarding the mission. His wife, who was nearly as old as\r\nhimself, was confined to bed from dropsy; I visited her frequently during\r\nour stay, prescribing such medicines as I thought would be of service to\r\nher; but what she most enjoyed, was a small basin of tea which I sent\r\nher morning and evening. Part of the wall of the apartment in which she\r\nwas lying had fallen in, but an attempt had been made to keep out the\r\nwind and rain, by placing a few palm leaves in the aperture. All the\r\ninhabitants speak Portuguese, but many of them still keep up the language\r\nof their forefathers.\r\n\r\nBy the old captain I was informed that the mission was established in\r\nthe year 1730, by a Lieut. Colonel Wencisläo Gomez, who came up with\r\ntroops from Pernambuco, and conquered the Coroá nation of Indians, being\r\nthat from which the present race is descended; at that time they formed\r\nthree Aldeas, and amounted in all to about 1,000 individuals. These three\r\nAldeas were united to form the present one, Duro, which place is called\r\nin their own language Ropechedy, signifying beautiful situation, a title\r\nwhich it well merits. Here also I found that the inhabitants lived in\r\nconstant fear of the Cherente Indians, who inhabit the woods on the banks\r\nof the Rio Tocantins to the north-west of Duro. These Indians have made\r\nseveral attacks on the mission, but the occasion on which they committed\r\nthe greatest havock, was in the year 1789, when a body of them amounting\r\nto upwards of two hundred, surrounded the Aldea one morning about ten\r\no’clock, and before evening had burned all the houses in the outskirts\r\nof the Aldea, and killed about forty persons, including men, women, and\r\nchildren. They also carried away four children, two of whom were nephews\r\nof the old captain. The inhabitants of the Aldea kept up a constant fire\r\nupon the Cherentes, but they could not tell how many of them were killed,\r\nas they took all their dead with them when they left.\r\n\r\nOn several nights, during our stay at the Mission, fires were seen on\r\nthe Serras at no great distance, and one day, as one of the inhabitants\r\nwas returning from the woods, he saw an Indian, armed with his bow\r\nand arrows, cross the path before him. These circumstances caused the\r\ninhabitants to dread another attack, and they were but poorly prepared to\r\nmeet it. Formerly they used to have a supply of arms and ammunition sent\r\nto them every year by the government, but for many years past, these had\r\nnot been furnished to them, and the old ones were nearly worn out. In\r\ncases of necessity, the government can call upon the captains to take\r\nthe field with their men, and each can raise about forty, able to carry\r\narms. A few of these Indians have guns of their own, which they use in\r\nhunting, and their powder is a coarse kind, manufactured by themselves.\r\nSome of the shopkeepers in the towns to the south-west, every year go\r\ndown by the Rio Tocantins to Pará to sell hides and purchase European\r\ngoods; very frequently some of the young men belonging to Duro hire\r\nthemselves to work the canoes, and with the money which they receive for\r\ntheir services, purchase at Pará axes and other iron tools; a party of\r\nthem returned from one of these trips during our visit.\r\n\r\nDuring the fortnight we remained in the Aldea do Duro, I was principally\r\noccupied in drying the immense collection of specimens obtained in\r\nthe latter part of the journey across the Geräes and the Chapada da\r\nMangabeira, and in packing up all those which had been procured between\r\nSanta Rosa and Duro. I also made many excursions in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe Aldea, and notwithstanding it was then the end of the dry season, I\r\nfound it an excellent field for my researches. The sandy marshes yielded\r\nme many curious _Eriocaulons_, and beautiful _Melastomaceæ_; while the\r\nupland campos produced several species of _Diplusodon_, many _Compositæ_,\r\n_Labiatæ_, &c.; but the most common, as well as the most beautiful\r\nof the productions of the campos, were a small _Bignonia_ growing in\r\ntufts, and scarcely a foot high, bearing numerous large lemon-coloured\r\ntrumpet-shaped flowers, an _Ipomæa_, similar in habit and about the same\r\nsize, producing large violet-coloured blossoms (_Ipomæa hirsutissima_,\r\nGardn.) and two erect kinds of _Echites_:[10] in dry rocky places\r\n_Amaryllis Solandræflora_, Lindl., was very common, producing abundantly\r\nits large yellow flowers.\r\n\r\nWe left Duro on the thirteenth of October, and slept at the house of\r\none of the Indians, about two leagues distant from the Aldea: the owner\r\nof it, hearing on what day I was to leave, arrived the night before,\r\nand begged of me to call at his house, which was but a little way off\r\nthe road, to see his wife who had been blind for some years, and was\r\nthen suffering from ophthalmia. I, of course, could not refuse his\r\nrequest, and the poor fellow tried to make us as comfortable as his\r\nmiserable residence would allow. This place was called Cachoeira, from a\r\nsmall waterfall near it; the high undulating hills which surrounded the\r\nvalley in which the house stood, gave it a very picturesque appearance.\r\nThere were two other houses at a short distance from that in which we\r\nslept, and although they are surrounded by the finest possible grounds\r\nfor plantations, the three families have but one small spot planted\r\nwith mandiocca, which seemed to be the only article they cultivate.\r\nAlthough there were abundant pastures in the neighbourhood, not one of\r\nthem possessed a single cow, and their excuse for not having one, was\r\nthe trouble it would give them to make a fence round their plantation;\r\nrather than do any manual labour of that kind, they prefer lounging\r\nabout the house in a state of idleness, or going out in the woods with\r\ntheir gun and axe, in search of game and wild honey. Our farinha being\r\nnearly exhausted, I enquired whether any was to be had at this place,\r\nbut they had none, nor would they have a supply for a month to come, as\r\nthe mandiocca was not yet ripe; fortunately a young man passed in the\r\nevening with a very small quantity which he at first refused to sell, as\r\nhe was taking it to a neighbour in return for some he had borrowed; he\r\nconsented, however, to let me have half of it, on condition of receiving\r\ndried beef in exchange, which, as we had then plenty, I agreed to.\r\n\r\nOn the journey from Duro to this place, we traversed a beautiful country\r\nof hill and dale, much of it being thinly wooded; some of the more open\r\nupland fields, owing to the recent rains, were covered with new grass\r\nabout a foot high, on which no animals fed, excepting a few wild deer. It\r\nis a general custom among the cattle farmers, to burn the pastures at the\r\nend of the dry season, in order that the new grass may spring up rapidly\r\non the setting in of the rains; this is also done by the inhabitants of\r\nthe mission, but with the view to keep their hunting grounds more open,\r\nand encourage the visits of deer. It seems probable, that at no very\r\ndistant period the whole of this district, and much of the country that\r\nlies to the east and north-west, will be converted into large cattle\r\nfarms, as it is well calculated for the rearing of cattle, owing to the\r\nmildness of the climate, and the abundance of grass and water which\r\nexists here all the year round.\r\n\r\nThe rain prevented our leaving Cachoeira on the following day till two\r\no’clock in the afternoon, when after a journey of two leagues, we arrived\r\nat the house of the Juiz de Paz of Duro; on account of the bad state of\r\nthe roads it was dusk before we accomplished this distance. The first\r\nleague and a half of our journey was over a hilly rocky country, when we\r\nbegan to descend the Serra do Duro, and shortly afterwards entered upon\r\na flat rather thickly-wooded tract. It is at the foot of the Serra that\r\nthe mission of Duro terminates, and about half a mile from it stands\r\nthe house in which the Juiz de Paz resided; it was exceedingly small,\r\nand as the outer room, that generally given to travellers, would not\r\nconveniently hold us, he told me we should find much better accommodation\r\nat the house of a relation of his, who lived about a gunshot distant, and\r\nhe kindly accompanied us thither. On reaching it, we found half a dozen\r\nIndians, sitting round a fire under a verandah in front of the house, and\r\nsuperintending the cooking of their supper in a large pot. While we were\r\narranging our trunks against the wall, the master of the house begged\r\nof us to wait till the men had taken out their beds, when each came and\r\ncarried his away, which however consisted of nothing more than half a\r\ncow’s hide; they sleep here as in the Aldea, stretching the hide in a\r\ncorner, on which they lie without taking off their clothes; I saw no one\r\nmake use of a hammock.\r\n\r\nA journey of three leagues from the residence of the Juiz de Paz, through\r\na flat thinly-wooded country, almost destitute of herbaceous vegetation,\r\n(no rains having as yet fallen in this quarter,) brought us to a fazenda,\r\nsituated on the banks of the Rio de Manoel Alvez, a large stream which\r\ntakes its rise in the Serra do Duro, to the north of the Aldea, and falls\r\ninto the Rio Tocantins. At this fazenda we were informed, that as the\r\nriver had risen considerably, it would be impossible for our horses to\r\ncross with their loads; and the canoe used for ferrying over passengers\r\nand luggage, had been carried away by the floods of the previous season,\r\ncircumstances which rendered it necessary to have everything transported\r\nacross the river on men’s heads. At the fazenda I engaged a negro and\r\na mulatto, to assist my own men in this operation; the ferry was about\r\na mile further down; here the river is about forty yards broad and the\r\ncurrent very strong, in consequence of a rapid which exists a little\r\nfurther below. When the two men, who both were tall and strong, entered\r\nwith the first loads, it was with difficulty they could keep their feet,\r\nas the water, during the greater part of the way, took them up to the\r\nshoulders; the recompense they asked, half a dollar each, was, however,\r\nvery dearly earned, as they had each to cross the river backwards and\r\nforwards about twelve times, which occupied more than two hours. Mr.\r\nWalker and I attempted to cross a little above the ferry by swimming,\r\nbut the force of the current swept us both over the rapids; Mr. Walker\r\nbeing carried with great force against some rocks, and it was with no\r\nsmall difficulty, that he reached the opposite side below the rapid in a\r\nstate of great exhaustion. I was more fortunate, being carried down at a\r\nplace clear of rocks, where I soon regained the same bank of the river I\r\nhad just left. I returned to the ferry, where I succeeded in crossing,\r\nbeing assisted by one of the men, for I was too low in stature to be\r\nable to bear up against the current alone. After this delay we resumed\r\nour journey, with the intention of halting during the night at a fazenda\r\nabout a league further, but finding we had still ample time, we pushed\r\non to a village called Almas, about two leagues to the westward, which\r\nwe reached about sunset. The country we passed after crossing the river\r\nwas nearly flat and thinly wooded, but not so much scorched up as that we\r\ntraversed in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe village of Almas is situated in a hollow, and consists of a few\r\nirregular streets, the houses of which are low and of mean appearance,\r\nbeing built of large unburned bricks, made of clay mixed with chopped\r\ngrass and dried in the sun. The number of its inhabitants amounts to\r\nabout 800, by far the greater part of whom are blacks and mulattos, and\r\nintermixtures between these and Indians. The Juiz de Paz was a creole\r\nnegro, who could neither read nor write; he was the principal shopkeeper\r\nin the village, and annually made a journey to Bahia to purchase goods.\r\nThe village contains a church, which is in about as ruined a condition as\r\nthat of Duro, and, in like manner, has no resident priest. Although the\r\nneighbourhood presents abundance of excellent ground for plantations, not\r\none was here to be seen. Upon our arrival I fully expected to be able to\r\npurchase some farinha, but none was to be had; it was indeed only as a\r\ngreat favour that a person who came to consult me professionally, sold me\r\na little rice. Every one was complaining of the scarcity of provisions,\r\nand the want of money, but not a word was said about the indolence and\r\nidleness, which no doubt was the cause of the famine that now existed\r\namong them. In consequence of almost incessant rains, we were obliged to\r\nremain in the village four days.\r\n\r\nOur first stage from Almas was to a fazenda, called Galheiro Morto, said\r\nto be only two leagues farther, but I have no doubt its real distance\r\nwas nearly four, judging from the time we took to perform the journey.\r\nThe leagues in this part of the country have never been measured, and\r\nas the land was originally bought by the league, it was the interest\r\nof the purchaser to take as large a portion as he could obtain; in the\r\nprovince of Piauhy, we found the leagues much longer than those of Ceará\r\nbut those of Goyaz even exceeded them. This difference is so manifest,\r\nthat they are designated as the short one (legoa pequena), and the long\r\none (legoa grande); the shorter league I always found to be quite long\r\nenough, and whenever the long one was to be travelled over, I usually\r\ncalculated the time necessary for accomplishing two short ones, and,\r\nindeed, I seldom found it required less. We halted at this place till the\r\nafternoon, when another journey of three leagues brought us to a little\r\nhamlet, consisting of about half a dozen houses, called Morhinos. The\r\nowner of the house where we put up for the night, returned from the woods\r\nshortly after our arrival, with a considerable quantity of wild honey,\r\nsome of which he kindly gave us, and we found it to be excellent; it was\r\nthe product of one of the smaller bees which are so numerous in this\r\npart of Brazil. This was the season in which the people go to the woods\r\nin search of honey; it is so generally used, that after leaving Duro, a\r\nportion was presented to us at almost every house where we stopped. These\r\nbees mostly belong to the genus _Melipona_, Illig., and I collected a\r\ngreat many, which with some other zoological specimens were afterwards\r\nlost in crossing a river. A list of them with their native names and a\r\nfew observations may not be uninteresting.\r\n\r\n    1. _Jatahy._—This is a very minute yellowish-coloured species,\r\n    being scarcely two lines long. The honey, which is excellent,\r\n    very much resembles that of the common hive-bee of Europe.\r\n\r\n    2. _Mulher branco._—About the same size as the _Jatahy_, but of\r\n    a whitish colour; the honey is likewise good, but a little acid.\r\n\r\n    3. _Tubí._—A little black bee, smaller than a common house-fly;\r\n    the honey is good, but has a peculiar and bitter flavour.\r\n\r\n    4. _Manoel d’abreu._—About the size of the _Tubí_, but of a\r\n    yellowish colour; its honey is good.\r\n\r\n    5. _Atakira._—Black, and nearly of the same size as the _Tubí_,\r\n    the principal distinction between them consisting in the kind\r\n    of entrance to their hives; the _Tubí_ makes it of wax, the\r\n    _Atakira_ of clay; its honey is very good.\r\n\r\n    6. _Oarití._—Of a blackish colour, and about the same size as\r\n    the _Tubí_; its honey is rather sour, and not good.\r\n\r\n    7. _Tataíra._—About the size of the _Tubí_, but with a yellow\r\n    body, and a black head; its honey is excellent.\r\n\r\n    8. _Mumbúco._—Black, and larger than the _Tubí_; the honey\r\n    after being kept about an hour becomes as sour as lemon juice.\r\n\r\n    9. _Bejuí._—Very like the _Tubí_, but smaller; its honey is\r\n    excellent.\r\n\r\n    10. _Tiubá._—Of the size of a large house-fly, and of a greyish\r\n    black colour; its honey is excellent.\r\n\r\n    11. _Borá._—About the size of a house-fly, and of a yellowish\r\n    colour; its honey is acid.\r\n\r\n    12. _Urussú._—About the size of a large bumble bee; the head is\r\n    black and the body yellowish; it produces good honey.\r\n\r\n    13. _Urussú preto._—Entirely black, and upwards of one inch in\r\n    length; it likewise produces good honey.\r\n\r\n    14. _Caniára._—Black, and about the same size as the _Urussú\r\n    preto_; its honey is too bitter to be eatable; it is said to be\r\n    a great thief of the honey of other bees.\r\n\r\n    15. _Chupê._—About the size of the _Tiubá_, and of a black\r\n    colour; it makes its hive of clay on the branches of trees, and\r\n    is often of a very large size; its honey is good.\r\n\r\n    16. _Urapuá._—Very like the _Chupê_, but it always builds its\r\n    hive rounder, flatter, and smaller.\r\n\r\n    17. _Enchí._—This is a kind of wasp, about the size of a\r\n    house-fly; its head is black, and the body yellow; it builds\r\n    its hive in the branches of trees; this is of a papery tissue,\r\n    about three feet in circumference; its honey is good.\r\n\r\n    18. _Enchú pequeno._—Very similar to the last, but it always\r\n    makes a smaller hive; it also produces good honey.\r\n\r\nThe first eleven of these honey-bees construct their cells in the hollow\r\ntrunks of trees, and the others, either in similar situations or beneath\r\nthe ground; it is only the last three kinds that sting, all the others\r\nbeing harmless. The only attempt I ever saw to domesticate any of these\r\nbees, was by a Cornish miner, in the Gold District, who cut off those\r\nportions of the trunks of the trees which contained the nests, and hung\r\nthem up under the eaves of his house; they seemed to thrive very well,\r\nbut whenever the honey was wanted, it was necessary to destroy the bees.\r\nBoth the Indians and the other inhabitants of the country, are very\r\nexpert in tracing these insects to the trees in which they hive: they\r\ngenerally mix the honey, which is very fluid, with farinha before they\r\neat it, and of the wax they make a coarse kind of taper about a yard\r\nlong, which serves in lieu of candles, and which the country people bring\r\nto the villages for sale. We found these very convenient, and always\r\ncarried a sufficient stock with us; not unfrequently we were obliged to\r\nmanufacture them ourselves, from the wax obtained by my own men; a coarse\r\nsoft kind of cotton yam for wicks was always to be purchased at the\r\ndifferent fazendas and villages through which we passed.\r\n\r\nFrom Morhinos we went on to the fazenda of Nossa Senhora d’Amparo, the\r\ndistance being about three leagues. It was my intention to proceed two\r\nleagues farther, to a fazenda called Santa Cruz, on the banks of the Rio\r\ndo Peixe, there being a canoe there for crossing it; but having enquired\r\nabout the state of the river, we were informed that it was then low, and\r\nmight be forded at a place farther up, without taking off the loads,\r\nand, moreover, save a circuit of nearly two leagues. We had yet about\r\na league to go before we reached this ferry, where I found the river\r\nmuch smaller than that of Manoel Alvez, and shallow enough to be passed\r\nwithout difficulty; but, notwithstanding this, one of the loads of dried\r\nplants met with a sad misfortune, the horse that bore it slipped, and\r\nfell down, just as he was emerging from the bank, when one of the boxes\r\ndropped into the river, and before it could be extracted was filled\r\nwith water; it is only a botanist who can imagine my feelings on this\r\noccasion, when I saw upwards of 2,000 specimens, that had cost me so\r\nmuch labour to procure, completely drenched, and apparently ruined for\r\never. My first care was to unpack them, and put them into dry paper, but\r\nso many specimens were laid on every sheet, that this process had but\r\nlittle effect in dissipating the moisture; I contented myself, however,\r\nwith the hope of being able next day to unpack them, and spread them out\r\nin the sun. After the box was dried, and the plants again deposited in\r\nit, the package was, for greater security, placed upon a stronger horse;\r\nwe had not, however, proceeded above half a league, when in crossing a\r\nsmall rivulet, I had again the mortification to see the same box, as\r\nwell as another that had previously escaped this disaster, both plunged\r\nbelow the water. The unlucky animal that carried them was leading the\r\nway, when instead of entering at the right fording-place, he stumbled\r\ninto a deep hole, with a muddy bottom, and in struggling to extricate\r\nhimself, flung off both the packages. If I felt much chagrined on the\r\nformer occasion, it may be imagined what my distress was, when I saw the\r\nhard labour of many weeks, the produce of a district hitherto unexplored\r\nby any botanist, thus apparently consigned to ruin; all that then could\r\nbe done, was to drain the water out of the boxes, and resume our journey.\r\nIt happened most fortunately that towards evening we reached a fazenda,\r\nwhere the principal article manufactured was farinha de mandiocca; and as\r\nit rained heavily all the next day, I was glad to obtain permission to\r\nmake use of two large stoves, on which we dried, sheet by sheet, all the\r\nspecimens that had been soaked; it was, however, the most fatiguing day’s\r\nwork I ever encountered, for both Mr. Walker and myself were incessantly\r\noccupied over the heated stoves, from six o’clock in the morning till\r\nafter midnight. In consequence of this prompt attention, the plants did\r\nnot suffer so much as I anticipated.\r\n\r\nWe remained two days at this fazenda, called Mato Virgem, having to wait\r\none day longer that I intended, owing to our want of farinha; the day\r\nafter our arrival they commenced the manufacture of a quantity, which\r\ncould not be got ready until the evening before we left. The place in\r\nwhich it was prepared, was the apartment where we were allowed to put\r\nup, the persons engaged in it being the mistress of the house, who\r\nwas a young mulatta, and eight slaves, four men and four women; I was\r\nastonished to find all of them, except one man and one woman, affected\r\nwith goître; the swelling on the neck of one of the women was much larger\r\nthan her head. They assured me it was a very general complaint in this\r\npart of the province of Goyaz, particularly in the Villas of Natividade\r\nand Arrayas; in the Aldea of Duro, I saw only one woman affected by\r\nit, and another in the Arraial of Almas. One of the slaves was an old\r\nman upwards of one hundred years of age, and quite blind, but he was,\r\nnotwithstanding, occupied all day in sifting farinha; his only dress\r\nconsisted of a small dirty rag rolled round his middle; that of the\r\nothers was but little better, indeed, in no part of Brazil did I meet\r\nwith slaves so wretchedly attired as at this place. It was surprising to\r\nme that the mistress was not ashamed to see them in such a state; but I\r\nhave no doubt, the fault was with the owner of the fazenda, who, judging\r\nfrom his appearance, seemed to be an old miser.\r\n\r\nWhen we left Mato Virgem it was our intention to reach a little hamlet,\r\ncalled João Lopez, said to be three long leagues distant. We were told\r\nthat we should have no difficulty in getting there, as there was a\r\nstraight road to it; but we had scarcely travelled a league and a half\r\nwhen we came to a place where there were two equally beaten paths, and\r\nnot knowing which to take, we chose that leading to the right, and\r\ncontinuing onwards all day, through a flat thinly-wooded country, without\r\nseeing either man or house, we arrived at a fazenda, a little before sun\r\ndown, where we were told, what I already suspected, that we had taken\r\nthe wrong road; but it was of little consequence, as it led also to\r\nthe Villa de Natividade, the place we finally intended to reach. This\r\nfazenda, called Sociedade, belongs to Senhor Manoel José Alves Leite, a\r\nyoung Portuguese, who was then Juiz de Paz of the Arraial da Chapada,\r\na village about a league distant. On our arrival, we were very kindly\r\ntreated by him; a fowl was immediately killed, and an excellent supper\r\nprepared, to which we did ample justice, after our long day’s journey.\r\nThe Portuguese who settle in the country, are said by the Brazilians to\r\nbe of a mean and grasping disposition, and deficient in the sentiment of\r\nbenevolence; this may be the case with many among the great number of\r\nthe uneducated, who emigrate from Portugal to Brazil, where there is not\r\nmuch inducement to the improvement of their character, but among them\r\nthere are many young men, who have received some education, and who by\r\ntheir good behaviour, and closer attention to business than the proud and\r\nindolent Brazilians, sooner acquire means of independence, which causes\r\nthem to become the objects both of their envy and dislike. I had little\r\nopportunity of associating with the Portuguese on the coast, but in the\r\ninterior, I have met with many worthy men of that nation, who have shown\r\nme the greatest kindness, when this has been refused by a Brazilian.\r\nEver since the independence of Brazil, they have been very greatly\r\npersecuted, and whenever any political disturbance takes place, as a\r\nnecessary consequence, numbers of Portuguese are murdered, and robbed of\r\nall they possess: there exists no fellow-feeling between the two nations.\r\nAs soon as our host became aware of my intention to remain a month or two\r\nat Natividade, in order to give rest to my horses, he most kindly urged\r\nme to send them to his fazenda, where he would take charge of them till\r\nour departure; such, indeed, was the civility we experienced, that I had\r\nno reason to regret having taken the wrong road.\r\n\r\nEarly on the following morning, the 25th of October, we left Sociedade,\r\nand after a journey of two long leagues, reached the Villa de Natividade.\r\nThe country between these two places is flat and thinly-wooded, but on\r\nthe east side of the road, near the Villa, there is an extensive Serra,\r\nabout 2,000 feet high, which stretches from north to south. The road\r\npasses near the base of this Serra for about half a league, and I was\r\nastonished to see the soil, which is of a gravelly nature, dug up into\r\ndeep trenches, and at intervals the ruins of what appeared once to have\r\nbeen houses. These trenches, I was informed, were old gold workings,\r\nwhich had been abandoned for a long time, on account of the gold being\r\nexhausted. The gold-workings seem to have been carried to a considerable\r\nextent, for the entire soil, for about half a league in length, and more\r\nthan a quarter of a mile in breadth, had evidently been completely turned\r\nover, to some depth, and the whole appeared to have undergone the process\r\nof washing; I afterwards found that most of the country in the vicinity\r\nof the Villa had been explored in the same manner. On our arrival, we\r\nhad no difficulty in finding an empty house for our accommodation, and\r\nshortly afterwards; the rains set in very heavily, on which account we\r\nwere detained here upwards of three months. This, however, I did not\r\nregret, after our long journey of considerably more than a thousand\r\nmiles, reckoned from the time we left Oeiras, from the effects of which\r\nthe horses had become much exhausted.\r\n\r\nI must not omit to mention, that on our journey from Duro to Natividade,\r\nwe met with great abundance of a delicious wild fruit, a kind of Mangába\r\n(_Hancornia pubescens var. Gardneri_, Alph. DC.) different from the one\r\nthat grows so abundantly in the province of Ceará and Pernambuco; the\r\nfruit is nearly twice its size, and even more delicious. We first met\r\nwith it on the Serra do Duro, where it is called Mangába do morro, but it\r\nis also abundant on the Chapadas, on the plain below, and like that of\r\nthe other species, this is only good to eat when ripe enough to fall from\r\nthe tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nNATIVIDADE TO ARRAYAS.\r\n\r\n    The Town of Natividade described—Its Population—Dress and\r\n    Manners of the People—Its Climate—Diseases—Goître extremely\r\n    prevalent—Excursion to the neighbouring lofty Mountain\r\n    Range—Its Geology and Vegetation—Visits the Arraial da\r\n    Chapada—Leaves Natividade—Passes San Bento, and arrives\r\n    at the Arraial de Conceição—Its Population—Very subject\r\n    to Goître—Probable cause of this Complaint—Reaches Barra,\r\n    and crosses the Rio de Palma—Arrives at Santa Brida—Stays\r\n    at Sapê—Account of the Animal and Vegetable Productions of\r\n    the Neighbourhood—Reaches the Villa de Arrayas—The Town\r\n    described—Geological Features of the surrounding Country—Its\r\n    Climate and Productions—Alarm of the Inhabitants—Muster of the\r\n    National Guards—Preparation for Departure.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Villa de Natividade is situated near the western base of the southern\r\nextremity of the Serra already mentioned, which bears the same name, and\r\nlike most of the towns in the interior is very irregularly built. The\r\npopulation amounts to about 2,000 souls consisting of the same mixed\r\nraces we had so frequently met with before. It contains four churches,\r\nwhich although now very old, are not yet quite finished, nor is it at\r\nall likely that they ever will be completed. There is also a jail, but\r\nit is built of unburned bricks, through which the prisoners generally\r\ncontrive to escape, so that it can scarcely be called a prison. Most of\r\nthe houses are constructed of this material. The inhabitants are lazy\r\nand indolent in the extreme, and consequently there is always a great\r\nscarcity of the common necessaries of life among them; notwithstanding\r\nthat much of the country in the neighbourhood of the Villa is well suited\r\nfor plantations of mandiocca, &c., still very few are to be seen;\r\nand although there are many large cattle farms at only a few leagues\r\ndistance, it is not above once a month, that fresh beef can be purchased;\r\nbut this is not much to be wondered at, as the mass of the inhabitants,\r\nfrom their indolent habits, have not the means of buying it, or any\r\nother useful article. On enquiry of one of the most respectable persons\r\nin the place, how these persons contrived to live, he told me that the\r\nfew who were industrious had to support the others, for they generally\r\nstole from their plantations as much as served to sustain their miserable\r\nexistence. During our stay, we were obliged to live almost entirely on\r\nfarinha and dried salt beef, neither rice, plantains, nor yams being\r\nobtainable. Occasionally I was able to purchase a kind of coarse biscuit,\r\nmade of Indian corn flour, and once or twice I had a present sent me of a\r\nfew small loaves, made from wheat grown on high lands, near the town of\r\nCavalcante, a long way to the south. I never saw wheat cultivated in any\r\nof those places I visited, and this was the only time I ever tasted bread\r\nmade from that grain grown within the tropics.\r\n\r\nAlthough the dress of the men is here much the same as in other northern\r\nparts of Brazil, that of the women differs greatly, for when dressed\r\neither for attending church, joining in processions, or visiting their\r\nfriends, in place of the large white cotton shawl, which the women of\r\nCeará throw over their heads, or the small white handkerchief used in\r\nPiauhy for the same purpose, I was rather surprised to find that here,\r\nthey all wore cloaks made either of Scotch tartan or blue cloth, very\r\nsimilar to those worn by the factory girls of Glasgow in the winter\r\nseason. Here it is a universal custom for the women to smoke; and the\r\npipe, which has a wooden tube about three feet long, is seldom out of\r\ntheir mouths from morning till night. They work little, but eat and sleep\r\na great deal; the lower classes of females are also much addicted to\r\ndrinking the rum of the country (cachaça). The only prisoner confined\r\nin the jail while I was there, was a woman, who a few years before was\r\ncondemned to twenty years’ imprisonment, for causing her own son to kill\r\nhis father. The son, who was condemned to perpetual imprisonment and\r\nhard labour, broke through the walls of the prison shortly after his\r\nsentence, and effected his escape.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived, there were three priests in the Villa, one of whom died\r\nduring our stay. These, like most others I met with, instead of being\r\nexamples of morality to the people, were immoral to an extent almost past\r\nbelief. The one who died was an old man upwards of seventy-four years\r\nof age: he was a native of Santos in the province of San Paulo, and a\r\ncousin of the celebrated José Bonifacio de Andrade. Although a man of a\r\nvery humane and benevolent disposition, and well educated, he left behind\r\nhim a family of half a dozen children by his own slaves, most of whom,\r\nwith their mothers, were left in bondage, and were afterwards sold with\r\nhis other effects for the payment of his debts. The Vigario General was\r\na half-caste, upwards of forty years of age, who had only been ordained\r\na few years before; up to that time he was, and still continues to be,\r\nthe largest cattle farmer in the district. Having acquired as much Latin\r\nfrom the old priest, as would enable him to mumble over the service of\r\nthe church, but without the least knowledge of theology, he went to the\r\ncity of Goyaz, to purchase his ordination from the bishop; a short time\r\nafterwards he obtained, by another purchase, the vicar generalship of the\r\ndistrict. About a month after my arrival in the Villa, I was sent for to\r\nattend a young slave belonging to him, a fine girl about sixteen years\r\nof age, who died of puerperal fever, a few days after giving birth to a\r\nchild, of which he was the father. By the inhabitants, this man was as\r\nmuch detested, as the old priest had been loved and esteemed.\r\n\r\nBoth the soil and the climate of this neighbourhood are far superior to\r\nthose of Piauhy and Ceará; the rains generally set in about the beginning\r\nof October, and continue more or less till April. During the whole of\r\nthe month of December, and part of January, it rained almost incessantly\r\nevery day, rendering it quite impossible to stir out; but in the latter\r\npart of January and the beginning of February the weather was very fine,\r\nwith the exception of the afternoons, when there was usually a heavy\r\nthunder-storm. The thunder-storms and the rain generally came from the\r\nnorth, north-east, and east, originating probably on the Serras which\r\nexist at a considerable distance in those directions. Indian corn and\r\nmandiocca are the principal articles cultivated here; but many of the\r\nfazendeiros also find it profitable to plant cane, not so much for the\r\nmanufacture of sugar as of rum, which meets a ready sale. The only fruit\r\ntrees that are cultivated are orange and lime, and in a few instances the\r\njaca and tamarind.\r\n\r\nThe principal diseases of this district are intermittent and malignant\r\nfevers, especially at the beginning and towards the end of the rainy\r\nseason. Ophthalmia and its consequences, as well as syphilis and its\r\neffects, are also very common, and yearly produce many miserable objects.\r\nNearly the whole of the inhabitants are affected with goître, and\r\nchildren are frequently born with it, even strangers who come to reside\r\nin the Villa and neighbourhood, are sure to become affected with it in\r\nthe course of a few years. Some ascribe it to the use of the sea salt\r\nbrought from Pará, the people having previously been accustomed to the\r\nuse of that they obtain from the soil in the neighbourhood, which is\r\nimpregnated with salt; others say that it is caused by the waters from\r\nthe Serra, which in the dry season particularly are a little saline.\r\nWhatever the cause may be, all seemed to agree both here, and at Almas,\r\nthat it is only within the last twenty years that it has become so\r\nprevalent among them: I found it quite as frequent at Conceição and\r\nArrayas, two towns further to the south, at which places the waters are\r\nalso saline, especially those flowing from the limestone mountains. All\r\nthe places where I have seen it prevail, lie along the eastern base of\r\nthe Serra Geral, a broad mountain chain, which divides the province of\r\nGoyaz from those of Pernambuco and Minas Geräes; burnt sponge is the\r\nonly remedy they employ against it. They have, however, recourse to\r\nanother method, in which they put great faith; this is a small piece\r\nof cord taken to a church, and cut exactly the length of the image of\r\nthe crucifixion which they wear round their necks. I made enquiries of\r\nseveral who wore this kind of charm, whether they imagined it produced\r\nany effect on the swelling, but, as was to be expected, they all\r\nconfessed that it not only failed in curing it, but in no way prevented\r\nit from increasing in size.\r\n\r\nI had now reached the most northerly point of the Brazilian empire, that\r\nhad previously been visited by any naturalist, for neither Pohl nor\r\nBurchell had extended their excursions beyond Natividade. It is true that\r\nSpix and Martius also travelled in the north of Brazil, but their route\r\nwas in a very different direction. As I was here informed that these\r\ntravellers had not ascended the neighbouring lofty Serra, I was resolved\r\nto do so, for the double purpose of making botanical collections, and of\r\nexamining its geological structure. On this journey I was accompanied by\r\nMr. Walker, a black shoe-maker, who acted as a guide, and one of my own\r\nmen. Following the banks of a small stream which comes from the Serra,\r\nand which passing near the north end of the Villa, yields it a constant\r\nsupply of clear and cool water, we reached the foot of the Serra, and\r\nshortly afterwards, by a gradual ascent, arrived on the top of a low\r\nbranch, where we found a broad shallow valley, the soil of which had been\r\ncompletely turned over in search of gold; and near the centre of it, we\r\ncame upon the ruins of what we were told had been the original site of\r\nthe Villa. It was founded by those who first ventured into this distant\r\nregion in search of gold, and was abandoned about sixty or seventy years\r\nago, when this metal became scarce, and when cattle farms were found to\r\nbe more productive than mines. Near the top of this valley there is a\r\nsmall artificial lake, which must have been formed at a great expense,\r\nand from it the water was led in small streams to the places where the\r\nwashings were going on. The soil in which the gold was found, is a\r\nferruginous gravel, formed from the disintegration of the primitive rocks\r\nof which the Serra is composed.\r\n\r\nLeaving the valley of the gold mines, which is above a mile in length,\r\nand beginning to ascend the higher part of the Serra, which is very\r\nthinly wooded with small trees, and covered with abundance of tree-lilies\r\n(_Vellozia_), as well as several kinds of coarse grass, we arrived at a\r\nplace near the summit, which was rocky, steep, and of difficult ascent.\r\nIt was some time before we could find a proper path, and in doing so,\r\nMr. Walker, who was the first to climb up, met with an accident which\r\nnearly proved fatal to him; when near the top, part of a rock by which\r\nhe laid hold gave way, and he was precipitated from a height of about\r\nsixteen or eighteen feet with great violence, and rolled over some large\r\nstones to within a few feet of a deep precipice; it was a most fortunate\r\ncircumstance for him that he did not go over it, or he would have been\r\ndashed to pieces. Although considerably bruised, he was again the first\r\nto lead the way, reaching the top with safety, where with more or less\r\ndifficulty we followed him. On attaining this point, we thought we had\r\ngained the highest part of the Serra, but about half a mile to the\r\nnorth we saw another point considerably higher to which we now directed\r\nour steps. During the ascent the sun was very powerful, but at this\r\nelevation, we found a deliciously cool breeze blowing from the east,\r\nwhich was very refreshing. We all suffered from thirst, and fortunately\r\nfound, at the base of the highest peak, a little pool of clear cool\r\nwater, by the side of which we took some refreshment that we had brought\r\nwith us. From the summit we had a beautiful prospect in all directions;\r\nto the eastward and north, the view was bounded by several chains of low\r\nSerras, but to the westward and south, the country appeared one vast\r\nplain, which was lost in the horizon. The top was covered with large\r\nblocks of granite, among which grew a few stunted trees and shrubs.\r\n\r\nI found the western side of the Serra to be bounded by a thick bed of\r\nvery compact greyish-coloured limestone, which beyond the northern point\r\nof the Serra, for some leagues, forms large isolated hills, covered\r\nwith wood. The central part of the chain is granite, between which and\r\nthe limestone formation the rocks are schistose. My botanical harvest\r\nwas a very rich one, so much so that I was induced, on two subsequent\r\noccasions, to ascend the mountain again. I collected, in particular,\r\nmany curious and beautiful little ferns, all new species, and several\r\nbeautiful _Vellozias_; these plants are peculiar to Brazil, and as I\r\nhave so often spoken of them, I shall here describe their appearance:\r\nthey belong to the _Endogenous_ or _Monocotyledonous_ division of the\r\nvegetable kingdom, and were named in honour of Dr. Joaquim Vellozo de\r\nMiranda, a Jesuit, who was a native of the province of Minas Geräes, and\r\nwho devoted much of his leisure time to the study of the botany of his\r\ncountry. They are most commonly found on the mountains of the interior,\r\nbut principally in the gold and diamond districts, growing in open grassy\r\nplaces, and often covering large tracts; they vary in height from a few\r\ninches to twelve feet; their stems are very dry and fibrous, and seem to\r\nbe made up of a great mass of long slender roots loosely hung together;\r\nand not unfrequently they contain a resinous matter, which causes them to\r\nbe sought after in the woodless regions of the diamond district for fuel.\r\nSometimes these stems are not less than a foot in diameter; they are very\r\nmuch branched, and are entirely leafless, except the last divisions of\r\nthe branches, which are clothed with long, narrow, aloe-like leaves, not,\r\nhowever, fleshy; from the centre of these spring the flowers, which are\r\ngenerally solitary, although some of the smaller species have as many as\r\nsix arising from the end of each branch. In the large kinds, the flowers\r\nare about six inches long, either of a pure white, or more frequently of\r\na beautiful purple colour; in shape, they are not unlike the large white\r\nlily of our gardens, and hence their name of tree-lilies. These plants\r\nare called by the Brazilians, Canela d’Emú (literally Emu shanks), from\r\ntheir bare stems resembling the legs of that bird. These beautiful plants\r\nwere first introduced into the hot-houses of England, from seeds sent\r\nhome by me; and as they are of very slow growth, and apparently difficult\r\nof cultivation, it may reasonably be expected they will be a long time\r\nbefore they can exhibit the beauty of their wild progenitors.\r\n\r\nBesides many shorter excursions which I made in the neighbourhood of\r\nNatividade, I went several times to the Arraial da Chapada, a village\r\nabout two leagues to the N.W.; it is about half the size of Natividade,\r\nand is situated on one of those low, flat table-lands called Chapadas,\r\nand hence its name. The country round it, as about Natividade, has all\r\nbeen turned over in search of gold; but those who formerly employed\r\ntheir slaves on this labour, now find it more to their profit to employ\r\nthem on plantations. There are still a few old free blacks who get a\r\nscanty livelihood by washing the soil. On my visits to this place I\r\nwas always very hospitably entertained by Captain Baptista, an old\r\nPortuguese, who has been settled there for many years, and who is\r\nfather-in-law to the proprietor of Sociedade. He spoke much of Pohl\r\nand Burchell, both of whom remained some time in the Arraial, and with\r\nwhom he seemed to have been intimate. My visits to this place afforded\r\nlarge additions to my collections, the limestone hills near Sociedade\r\nin particular being very rich in plants. During my stay in the Villa\r\nde Natividade, I received much kindness from Senhor Zacaria Antonio do\r\nSanto, the Juiz dos Orfãos. I had many visits also from a person who\r\nlived at a little distance from the Villa, and who at one time had been\r\nJuiz de Paz: he was a very good-natured and simple-minded man, as the\r\nfollowing anecdote will show. The first time he called on me, he said\r\nhe wished to speak with me in private: he began by telling me that he\r\nhad heard the English had the power of divining where hidden gold was to\r\nbe discovered, and that as much gold was to be found in the Serra, if I\r\nwould point out where a rich mine existed, he would undertake to work\r\nit, and share the profits with me. In almost the same breath he informed\r\nme, that a few years ago a Portuguese died in the neighbourhood, who was\r\nalways considered to be very rich, but that on his decease no money was\r\nto be found; now, he said, he fully believed that it was all buried,\r\nsomewhere near his house, which was now in ruins, and that if I would\r\naccompany him there, and discover it, we could without any one knowing\r\nit, share it between us. The poor old fellow seemed sadly disappointed\r\nwhen I told him that I had never made such a branch of knowledge my study.\r\n\r\nOne dark night, about the beginning of December, while passing along\r\nthe streets of the Villa de Natividade, I observed some boys amusing\r\nthemselves with some’ luminous object, which I at first supposed to be\r\na kind of large fire-fly; but on making enquiry I found it to be a\r\nbeautiful phosphorescent fungus, belonging to the genus _Agaricus_, and\r\nwas told that it grew abundantly in the neighbourhood, on the decaying\r\nleaves of a dwarf palm. Next day I obtained a great many specimens,\r\nand found them to vary from one to two inches and a half across. The\r\nwhole plant gives out at night a bright phosphorescent light, of a pale\r\ngreenish hue, similar to that emitted by the larger fire-flies, or by\r\nthose curious soft-bodied marine animals, the _Pyrosomæ_; from which\r\ncircumstance, and from growing on a palm, it is called by the inhabitants\r\n“Flor do Coco;” the light given out by a few of these fungi, in a dark\r\nroom, was sufficient to read by. It proved to be quite a new species, and\r\nsince my return from Brazil, has been described by the Rev. Mr. Berkeley\r\nunder the name of _Agaricus Gardneri_, from preserved specimens which\r\nI brought home. I had already named it _A. phosphorescens_, not being\r\naware at the time I discovered it, that any other species of the same\r\ngenus exhibited a similar phenomenon; such, however, is the case in the\r\n_Agaricus olearius_ of De Candolle; and Mr. Drummond, of the Swan River\r\nColony in Australia, has given an account of a very large phosphorescent\r\nspecies occasionally found there.[11]\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of February, 1840, we left Natividade, with the intention of\r\nproceeding to the Villa de Arrayas, a small town about thirty leagues to\r\nthe S.E. We had made all our preparations to leave on the second, but\r\nhad the mortification to find one of our horses missing, which detained\r\nus eight days. It proved, in the end, that some one had taken the loan\r\nof it, for four days after our departure, it was found near the place\r\nwhence it had been taken, and was sent after me by my friend the Juiz\r\ndos Orfãos. Leaving Natividade, and skirting the base of the Serra in\r\na southerly direction, we arrived at the banks of a small river called\r\nthe Riacho Salobro, which flows towards the west, and falls into the\r\nManoel Alvez: its waters are very brackish during the dry season. The\r\nloads had all to be passed over a rude kind of bridge (pingella) formed\r\nof the trunks of two trees, and as both the river and its banks were\r\ndeep, we had no little difficulty in getting the horses across, which\r\nwas done by swimming them. We remained for the night at the fazenda Das\r\ntres legoas, nearly three leagues from the Villa, as its name implies.\r\nOn the following morning, after a journey of one long league and a half,\r\nwe again reached the banks of the Rio de Manoel Alvez, at a place where\r\nit was both much broader and deeper than where we previously crossed it;\r\nhere, however, we were fortunate enough to find a canoe. My first care\r\nwas to have the horses passed to the other side, which was done by two\r\nmen entering the canoe, and each taking hold of a halter they were swum\r\nover, two at a time. Before all our luggage was conveyed to the opposite\r\nbank, a heavy thunder-storm passed over us from the N.E., which drenched\r\nus completely; in consequence of this I thought it best to proceed at\r\nonce to the first house, which was only a league and a half distant,\r\nwhere we remained for the night. The country between the Villa and the\r\nriver is nearly a flat plain, consisting of large open campos, marshes,\r\nand tracts, but thinly wooded with small trees. Several beautiful\r\nflowering shrubs, and a few terrestrial _Orchideæ_ were collected on this\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nFrom this place, a journey of about ten leagues brought us to the Arraial\r\nde Conceição, a distance that occupied us two days and a half. On the\r\nnight of the 12th, we slept at a large cattle fazenda, called San Bento,\r\nand a very stormy afternoon prevented us from leaving it. Till within\r\nabout a league of the Arraial, the country continues flat and open, but\r\nafterwards it became hilly, the hills being low and often rocky. So\r\nthinly is the country populated in these districts, that between San\r\nBento and the Arraial, a distance of at least twenty miles, we passed\r\nonly one house. The greater part of this district is only adapted for\r\nthe rearing of cattle, but there is much also admirably suited for\r\nplantations of different kinds.\r\n\r\nThe Arraial de Conceição contains a population of about one hundred\r\npersons; but there are many houses in the village, belonging to\r\nfazendeiros, who only occupy them at the time of the principal church\r\nfestivals; blacks and mulattos form the greater portion of the\r\nresidents, and during the four days we remained here, we saw very few\r\nwhite people. This village is situated in a hollow between two small\r\nhills, but the country around in general is level; the houses stand\r\nprincipally in two long streets, and one of the two churches it contains\r\nis now in ruins. The water with which the Arraial is supplied, is\r\nobtained from a small rivulet; it is very bad and of a brackish taste; it\r\nseems to have some connection with the production of goître, so prevalent\r\nalong the western side of the Serra Geral, which, as far as I have traced\r\nit, is bounded by limestone similar to that which exists at Natividade.\r\nThe streams which flow over these rocks are all more or less saline,\r\nand wherever these waters are drunk by the inhabitants, there goître is\r\nfound to exist. Along the eastern side of the Serra, on the contrary,\r\nthis disease is scarcely to be met with, and there, at least in those\r\nparts which I visited, no limestone was to be seen, nor were any of the\r\nrivulets impregnated with saline matter.\r\n\r\nThe soil for nearly a league round the village, has evidently been well\r\nturned over in search of gold, and from all accounts a considerable\r\nquantity was found in former times; the little met with at present\r\nscarcely repays the labour of searching for it. The soil in which it is\r\nfound is of a clayey, gravelly nature, being evidently the débris of\r\nprimitive rocks, the gold appearing either in very minute particles, or\r\nin grains of all sizes, some of which are said to weigh several ounces.\r\nRich veins are also supposed to exist in the solid rock, which consists\r\nmostly of quartz, but these they cannot explore to any depth, as they\r\ndo not possess the means of getting rid of the water which accumulates.\r\nI was informed by the Vigario, who perhaps exaggerated the fact, that\r\nat a short distance from the village there exists a mine so rich, that\r\na small bucket of soil yields nearly a quarter of an ounce of gold:\r\nhe said it was not above, twenty feet deep, but in consequence of the\r\ninflux of a spring, it had been abandoned for a long time. The only\r\nmethod they employed to get rid of the water, was by a number of men\r\nstationed at different heights, who handed it to one another in buckets;\r\nwhen I enquired why they did not make use of pumps, he said they had\r\nonly heard of such things, but had never seen them, the mechanics of\r\nthe place being so ignorant that they did not know how to construct\r\nso simple an instrument! From the Vigario I received a great deal of\r\nkindness during my stay: he was a man of very benevolent disposition,\r\nand much respected by the people; although advanced in years, he was of\r\na very active temperament, far more so indeed than the generality, not\r\nonly of his class, but of his countrymen. He was the only person in those\r\nparts who was a subscriber for a newspaper from Rio de Janeiro, but from\r\nthe irregularity of the posts, long intervals often elapsed in their\r\ndelivery. He kindly gave me a letter of introduction to one of the most\r\ninfluential persons in the neighbourhood of the Villa de Arrayas, who was\r\nhis intimate friend.\r\n\r\nWithin the last twenty years, two slight earthquakes have been felt both\r\nat Natividade and Conceição; the first occurred in the year 1826, and\r\nthe other in 1834; the movement of the earth was very perceptibly felt\r\nin both places, although they were each of short duration. These were\r\nthe only places in Brazil where I could learn such phenomena had been\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nWe left Conceição on the morning of the 17th of Feb., when a journey of\r\nfour long leagues brought us, late in the afternoon, to the banks of\r\nthe Rio da Palma. About half a league from the Arraial, the road winds\r\nround the end of a somewhat lofty ridge of rocky hills, not far from\r\nthe foot of which we passed some gold workings. The slaves employed in\r\nthis occupation do not give all they find to their masters, for they are\r\nobliged to maintain and clothe themselves, and pay to their employers\r\na certain fixed sum of money, somewhere about six shillings per week.\r\nMany of them have been fortunate enough to purchase their freedom, but\r\nthe greater number of them become indolent and dissipated. A short time\r\nbefore our arrival, a slave found a piece of pure gold weighing upwards\r\nof ten ounces, which was more than sufficient to procure him his freedom.\r\nThe fields about here were gay with a fine terrestrial Orchideous\r\nplant, an _Epistephium_, about two feet high, bearing a spike of large\r\nrose-coloured flowers. We halted during the middle of the day at the\r\nonly house on the road, the fazenda de Pindobal, and started early again,\r\nso as to reach the Rio da Palma in good time to cross it. The country\r\nwe found to be nearly flat, consisting of large open campos, which were\r\nbetter stocked with cattle than any we had hitherto passed through\r\nin this province. When about half way to the river, we unfortunately\r\nwent off the proper path, and got upon a cattle track, which in those\r\nthinly-inhabited countries often lead the traveller astray, the highway\r\nhaving quite the same appearance; it was some time before we discovered\r\nour error, but knowing the direction in which the river ran, we made\r\ndirect for it, and in less than half an hour were so fortunate as to\r\ncome upon the right road again, which now lay through a thin forest,\r\nconsisting principally of _Qualea parviflora_, Mart. In consequence of\r\nthe delay thus occasioned, it was nearly sunset before we arrived at the\r\nferry.\r\n\r\nWe found the river much swollen, although it had not rained here for more\r\nthan a week, but we concluded that much rain had fallen recently further\r\nup the country. Owing to this circumstance, and to the lateness of the\r\nhour, we had some difficulty in prevailing on the ferryman to carry us\r\nover to the other side. The Rio da Palma is considerably broader than\r\nthat of Manoel Alvez, and flows with much greater force. In this, as in\r\nthe former river, the canoe is maintained at the expence of government,\r\nbut it was here on so small a scale that only one horse could be taken\r\nover at a time; in this tedious manner the transit was repeated no less\r\nthan twelve times before all could be passed over, which occupied more\r\nthan three hours. This place is called Fazenda da Barra, and contains\r\nseveral houses on both sides of the river; that to which we were directed\r\nto find accommodation was so small, that as the night promised to be\r\nfine, we preferred taking up our quarters under some trees that grew in\r\nfront of it.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, after we had travelled about two leagues and\r\na half, we were obliged to stop in consequence of two of the horses\r\nbecoming very much fatigued, caused most probably by the great-exertion\r\nof crossing the river the night before. We halted at a place near the\r\nfoot of the Serra da Santa Brida, where only a few small trees grew,\r\nwhich were barely sufficient to shelter us from a powerful sun. This\r\nSerra is a branch of the same range as that on which the Villa de\r\nArrayas is situated, and runs in a north-west direction to within about\r\ntwo leagues of the Rio da Palma; at its highest part it is not more\r\nthan a thousand feet above the level of the surrounding country. In the\r\nafternoon we again made a short stage of about a league and a half, and\r\nencamped for the night under some small trees, by the side of a clear\r\nrivulet that flows from the Serra. On this journey we met with some\r\nshowers of rain, and when we arrived at the place of our encampment, a\r\nheavy thunder-storm came rolling along the Serra towards us from the\r\nsouth-east, which made us regret that we were under the necessity of\r\nsleeping in the woods; fortunately, however, as it approached near to\r\nus, it turned off suddenly towards the north, after which we had the\r\nadvantage of a beautiful night. Our route on this journey was through\r\na large flat open valley, bounded on the north and east by the Serra\r\nde Santa Brida, and on the south and east by another range called the\r\nSerra de Buriti. This valley consists of large open campos abounding in\r\ntree-lilies, and is but thinly wooded except on the margins of small\r\nstreams that flow from the mountains. Next morning we made a journey of\r\ntwo leagues through a similar country, and arrived early in the forenoon\r\nat the fazenda de Santa Brida, which belongs to a person for whom I\r\nbrought letters from the Vigario of the Arraial de Conceição. He does\r\nnot, however, reside here, and the only house we found was one belonging\r\nto the vaqueiro who has charge of the cattle. As the pasture was good,\r\nwe remained here till the following day, in order to give the horses a\r\nlittle rest.\r\n\r\nWe left early in the morning, and at a short distance from the fazenda,\r\ncrossed a small river which was well wooded along its banks with large\r\ntrees, particularly the Jatobá (_Hymenæa_). In this river, as in all\r\nthose within this province, the electric eel (_Gymnolus electricus_) is\r\nvery common; they are of all sizes, from a foot to six feet in length,\r\nand are frequently caught on the lines which are set for other fishes;\r\nthey are sometimes eaten, but not generally, although their flesh is\r\nsaid to be very good. Horses as well as men, by coming in contact with\r\nthem in the water, are not unfrequently thrown down by the shock which\r\nthey impart; they are called by the inhabitants Treme-treme. In rainy\r\nweather, those who fish in these rivers often receive a shock, which is\r\ncommunicated along the moisture upon the rod and line, when one of them\r\nhappens to seize the hook. I saw one in a state of captivity, about six\r\nfeet long, which was so tame that it would allow any one to put his hand\r\nupon it, and even slide for its whole length through the fingers, but\r\nif irritated in the smallest degree, by pinching it a little, however\r\nslightly, it instantly communicated a smart shock. A fatiguing journey of\r\nupwards of four leagues, under a burning sun, and through a rather open\r\ncountry, brought us to the fazenda of Sapê, the residence of the owner of\r\nthe fazenda of Santa Brida, Lieut. João Gomez Lagoeira. On our arrival I\r\nwas informed that he had gone to visit a plantation a little way off, but\r\nwas expected home immediately. In an hour’s time he made his appearance,\r\nand on reading the letter I brought from his friend the Vigario, he\r\ngave me a most hearty welcome. It was my intention to have proceeded to\r\nthe Villa de Arrayas, which is four leagues distant, on the following\r\nmorning, but this our kind host would not listen to, and it was only\r\nafter the expiration of five days, that he consented to our departure. In\r\norder that we might not reach the Villa short of provisions, he sent to\r\none of his cattle farms for a fat ox, which was killed and dried for our\r\nuse, and he also obliged me to accept a load of farinha.\r\n\r\nThe fazenda of Sapê is situated at the foot of the Serra de Santa Brida,\r\nnear the entrance of a small valley, which is enclosed on both sides by\r\nthe surrounding hills; the grounds belonging to it being well watered,\r\nand the soil rich, they are well adapted for the cultivation of the\r\nsugar cane, of which there are several large plantations. The greater\r\npart of the cane is converted into rum, for which there exists a greater\r\ndemand than for sugar; rice and mandiocca also yield abundant crops. The\r\nwhole of the property which Lieut. Lagoeira possesses, covers an area\r\nof about sixty-four square miles: it is divided into several fazendas\r\nfor the rearing of cattle, which amount to about fourteen thousand\r\nhead, the produce of which are principally sold to drovers, who take\r\nthem down to Bahia. He was originally a drover, but becoming a great\r\nfavourite of the former owner of the estate, he obtained his daughter\r\nin marriage; and the father dying soon after, the entire management of\r\nthe fazenda fell into his hands. Being a man of a mild and benevolent\r\ndisposition, and having received a good education, he is looked up to\r\nand respected by the inhabitants of all the surrounding country. During\r\nour residence at this fazenda, and the several times I visited it during\r\nmy residence at Arrayas, I made several excursions in its neighbourhood.\r\nOn these occasions I was always accompanied by Senhor Lagoeira, who was\r\na keen sportsman; sometimes we went to an upland grassy plain, thinly\r\ncovered with _Vellozia_ and _Diplusodon_, the latter, a beautiful little\r\nshrub, bearing a profusion of small rose-coloured flowers. On these dry\r\nplains are found plenty of a kind of quail, called Perdiz, which is a\r\nspecies of the genus _Tinamus_, very little smaller than the partridge\r\nof Europe. Senhor Lagoeira possessed several pointers, one of which\r\nalways accompanied us, but not being well trained, many of the birds\r\nescaped. Sometimes we visited the valley behind the house, which in\r\nseveral places is swampy, and abounds in a large species of palm, called\r\nCabeçudo,[12] the fruit of which forms the principal food of the large\r\nblue Maccaw, which is very common in this district. In the marshes of\r\nthis valley the Boa Constrictor is often met with of considerable size;\r\nit is not uncommon throughout the whole province, particularly by the\r\nwooded margins of lakes, marshes, and streams. Sometimes they attain\r\nthe enormous length of forty feet: the largest I ever saw was at this\r\nplace, but it was not alive. Some weeks before our arrival at Sapê,\r\nthe favourite riding horse of Senhor Lagoeira, which had been put out\r\nto pasture not far from the house, could not be found, although strict\r\nsearch was made for it all over the fazenda. Shortly after this, one of\r\nhis vaqueiros, in going through the wood by the side of a small river,\r\nsaw an enormous boa, suspended in the fork of a tree which hung over the\r\nwater; it was dead, but had evidently been floated down alive by a recent\r\nflood, and being in an inert state, it had not been able to extricate\r\nitself from the fork before the waters fell. It was dragged out to the\r\nopen country by two horses, and was found to measure thirty-seven feet\r\nin length; on opening it, the bones of a horse, in a somewhat broken\r\ncondition, and the flesh in a half digested state, were found within\r\nit, the bones of the head were uninjured; from these circumstances we\r\nconcluded that the boa had devoured the horse entire. In all kinds of\r\nsnakes, the capacity for swallowing is prodigious. I have often seen one\r\nnot thicker than my thumb, swallow a frog nearly as large as my fist;\r\nand I once killed a rattle-snake, about four feet long, and of no great\r\nthickness, which had swallowed not less than three large frogs, one of\r\nwhich swelled out its sides to nearly twice the thickness of the other\r\nparts; it was still alive, and hopped away after it was liberated. I\r\nhave also seen a very slender snake that frequents the roofs of houses,\r\nswallow an entire bat three times its own thickness. If such be the\r\ncase with these smaller kinds, it is not to be wondered at that one\r\nthirty-seven feet long should be able to swallow a horse, particularly\r\nwhen it is known that, previously to doing so, it breaks the bones of the\r\nanimal by coiling itself round it, and afterwards lubricates it with a\r\nslimy matter which it has the power of secreting in its mouth.\r\n\r\nAt other times we went into the forest that skirts the base of the Serra,\r\nin which the larger trees consist of a kind of _Mimosa_ called Angica.\r\nOn their branches were to be seen numbers of a beautiful little Marmoset\r\nmonkey, attracted thither by a gum which this tree secretes, and of which\r\nthey are very fond. Among the trees of these forests were also seen some\r\nof the large howling monkeys (_Mycetes barbatus_, Spix), which are known\r\nin Brazil by the names of Barbudo and Guariba; they possess immense\r\nmuscular power in their long prehensile tails, and even after being\r\nshot, and quite dead, they hang suspended by them from the branches.\r\nThey generally appear in bands, making a disagreeable howling noise,\r\nparticularly at an early hour in the morning. A little ring-tailed monkey\r\n(_Ateles paniscus_) is still more abundant, and is more persecuted by the\r\nfazendeiro, on account of the depredations it commits in his plantations.\r\nThe cane and Indian corn-fields are those which they most frequently\r\nvisit, whence they always carry off their plunder to the woods. An old\r\nnegro assured me he had often seen one of these animals carry with it\r\nnot less than three spikes of Indian corn, one in its mouth, another\r\nsecured by one of its arms, and a third held by its prehensile tail;\r\nI confess, however, that before placing implicit faith in this tale,\r\nI must be a witness to the fact. The moist and marshy campos produce\r\nvarious kinds of palm trees, which bear large clusters of small nuts,\r\ngreatly resembling miniature cocoa-nuts. When ripe, these are covered\r\nexternally with a fibrous oily substance, which has a sweetish taste, and\r\nconstitutes the favourite food of these little monkeys, who are no less\r\nfond of the internal part of the nut, which contains a substance similar\r\nto that found in cocoa-nuts. In several parts of the interior I had been\r\ntold, that to get at the kernel, the shell being too hard to break with\r\ntheir teeth, the monkeys carry the nuts to a rocky place, and then break\r\nthem with a stone, and I even met with persons who assured me that they\r\nhad watched them in such places through the bushes, and actually seen\r\nthem engaged in this operation. This account, like that of the carrying\r\naway of Indian corn, I always considered to be fabulous till I arrived\r\nat Sapê. In an excursion we made over the Serra, immediately behind the\r\nfazenda, where it is composed of nearly bare, rugged limestone peaks,\r\nin several almost inaccessible places we came upon large heaps of the\r\nbroken shells of nuts, generally on a bare open part of the rock, and\r\nalong with them a number of roundish pieces of stone, larger than the\r\nfist, which had evidently been employed in breaking the shells. These\r\nSenhor Lagoeira told me were the places resorted to by the monkeys for\r\nthe purpose of breaking the nuts collected in the low grounds; and that\r\nin his shooting excursions over the mountains, he has frequently seen\r\nthem take flight on his approach. That they both can, and really do make\r\nuse of a stone in order to break that which is too hard for their teeth,\r\nI have frequently witnessed in a little pet monkey that accompanied me\r\non my journey: I obtained it in Piauhy, and it was the only one of the\r\nmany tame animals I carried with me, that reached Rio de Janeiro alive;\r\nit was a female of the species we are now speaking of, and ultimately\r\nbecame very gentle. Jerry was the favourite with all, and indeed in\r\nall respects fared like ourselves; it became so fond of tea, which it\r\ndrank every morning and evening, that it would not go to sleep without\r\nits usual allowance. Its favourite food was farinha, boiled rice, and\r\nbananas, but scarcely anything came amiss to it; a raw egg was a choice\r\nmorsel, and on being given to it, it broke one end by gently knocking\r\nit on the floor, and completed the hole by picking off the broken bits\r\nof shell, and putting in the point of its long slender finger; throwing\r\nback its head, and holding the egg erect between its two hands, it soon\r\ncontrived to suck out the whole contents. Whenever anything was given to\r\nit that was too hard to break with its teeth, it always looked about for\r\na stone, and lifting it with one hand, by repeated blows would attempt to\r\ncrack it; if unsuccessful by these means, it would try to find a larger\r\nstone, which it would hold in both its hands, and, rising erect on its\r\nlegs, would let it fall, leaping backwards at the same time to avoid any\r\ninjury to its toes. I have often watched the means it employed to obtain\r\nany small object that happened to be a little beyond its reach; if it\r\ncould lay its hands upon a little switch, or slender twig of any sort,\r\nit would stretch itself out as far as its cord would allow, and continue\r\nworking at the object till it got it within its reach. These operations\r\nwere certainly often very awkwardly performed, but they were always\r\ninteresting from the amount of reasoning power which the little animal\r\nexhibited, and the perseverance with which its object was attained. Jerry\r\nalmost always rode on the back of a large mastiff dog that accompanied\r\nus, and in this manner performed a journey of several thousand miles.\r\nThese two animals were greatly attached to each other, and it was often\r\nan amusing sight to see them gamboling together. Before starting, the\r\ndog used to go every morning to the place where the little monkey was\r\ntied, and wait till it was put upon its back, and its cord made fast to\r\nhis collar. In travelling it was not at all particular as to whether\r\nits face was towards the head or tail of the charger, except in going\r\ndown hill, when its face was turned forwards, and to prevent itself from\r\nslipping over the dog’s head, it made use of its long prehensile tail as\r\na crupper, by coiling the extremity round the root of that of the dog. I\r\nhad determined to bring Jerry with me to England, but in taking it with\r\nme to the Organ Mountains, after my arrival at Rio de Janeiro, much to my\r\ngrief, it disappeared one night, and was never afterwards heard of; it\r\nwas stolen, I have no doubt, by one of the slaves, and sold somewhere for\r\na mere trifle.\r\n\r\nA few days before we arrived at Sapê, one of the slaves caught a young\r\nmale monkey of this species. A number of these little animals had come to\r\npay a visit to a plantation of Indian corn, several of them were females\r\nthat carried their young on their backs, which they seldom quit till they\r\nare able to provide for themselves; being pursued by some slaves, in the\r\nheat of the retreat, this one was thrown from its mother’s back, and\r\nmade prisoner, and was presented to me by Senhor Lagoeira as a companion\r\nfor Jerry. I little expected it would pay any attention to the young\r\none, but no sooner were they put beside each other than the little one,\r\nfancying no doubt it had found its mother, crept up and secured itself on\r\nJerry’s back, and apparently seemed quite happy. Jerry instead of being\r\nill pleased with this intrusion, became so much attached to it, that she\r\nwould not allow any one to touch the young one; and seemed to have all\r\nthe affection for it as if it had been her own. Several times I observed\r\nthat when it came off her back to amuse itself on the ground, and was\r\nabout to get out of her reach, she would catch it by the tail and draw it\r\nback. During the first few days they were together, her breasts became\r\ninflamed by the attempt the young one made to obtain milk from them; it\r\nseldom left her back, remaining there both day and night. It was amusing\r\nto see her cleaning it of fleas by laying it down on the ground, turning\r\nover its long hair, layer by layer, and catching between her fore-finger\r\nand thumb the insects as they made their appearance and then eating them;\r\nwhen they were difficult to take in this manner, she would catch them\r\nbetween her teeth at once. During this operation the little one would lie\r\nas quiet as if it had been sleeping. It only lived a few weeks after we\r\nreached Arrayas, and I was surprised that although so much attachment was\r\nshown to it by the old one while it was alive, not the least symptom of\r\ngrief was exhibited at its death.\r\n\r\nIn the densest parts of the forests near Sapê, the _Jacutinga_ (_Penelope\r\nJacutinga_, Spix), the fine large game bird so common in the forests\r\nof the Organ Mountains, was not unfrequently encountered in our walks,\r\nand brought home as trophies. The mountains here, as already mentioned,\r\nare composed entirely of a compact primitive limestone, similar to\r\nthat existing at Natividade, and which I afterwards found extending\r\nmany leagues to the southwards. The lower parts of these mountains are\r\ntolerably well wooded, but the upper parts consisting of sharp rugged\r\npeaks, surrounded by broken masses at their bases, are nearly destitute\r\nof vegetation, the only plants found here being a small wild Fig tree,\r\na large prickly _Cactus_, a shrubby _Trixis_, a small _Begonia_, and\r\na stinging _Loasa_. The heaps of broken rocks which exist around the\r\nbases of the peaks, are frequented by vast numbers of a small animal,\r\ngreatly resembling a rabbit, and about the same size; it is allied to the\r\nGuinea-pig, and its flesh, which is white, is very good to eat. It is the\r\n_Kerodon moco_ of naturalists, and is well known to the inhabitants by\r\nthe name of Mocó.\r\n\r\nIt was in the afternoon of the twenty-sixth of February that we left\r\nSapê for Arrayas, and after travelling two rather long leagues, we\r\nreached the foot of the Serra, at the point of ascent to the upland\r\nplain in which the Villa is situated. Here we bivouacked for the night,\r\nslinging our hammocks among some trees, by the side of a little stream\r\nwhich came from the mountains. On this journey, after leaving the more\r\ndensely wooded tract which surrounded Sapê, we entered a wide open\r\nvalley, situated between the Serra de Santa Brida and that of Buriti,\r\nwhich gradually became narrower until the two Serras united at the place\r\nof our encampment. This valley is very thinly-wooded, except along the\r\nmargins of the many small streams which intersect it, and which join to\r\nform a small river that flows through its centre. I found this locality\r\nparticularly rich in botanical productions, as it abounded with elegant\r\nflowering shrubs and trees, such as _Pleroma_, _Crotalaria_, _Bauhinia_,\r\n_Diplusodon_, _Vochysia_, _Kielmeyera_, _&c._ The ascent of the Serra,\r\nwhich was accomplished on the following morning, we found both long\r\nand tiresome, and very rocky. From the top of the Serra to the Villa,\r\nwhich is a league and a half distant, the road is of gentle declivity. I\r\ncarried a letter from Senhor Lagoeira to a schoolmaster, who in a short\r\ntime found an empty house for our accommodation, of a very inferior\r\ndescription, and little calculated to keep out either wind or rain; it\r\nwas, however, the only one that could be obtained. Here we remained for\r\nabout a week, until another, which on our arrival was occupied by a\r\ntravelling merchant, became empty; it was far superior, and now fell to\r\nour use. As the season of rain was not yet nearly terminated, I remained\r\nin Arrayas nearly two months, during which time I amassed a splendid\r\ncollection of the curious and beautiful plants, which are peculiar to the\r\nupland grassy campos of the interior of Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe Villa de Arrayas is very pleasantly situated in a hollow on the\r\ntable-land of the Serra; it is surrounded nearly on all sides by low\r\ngrassy hills, which are but thinly-wooded with small trees and bushes.\r\nThe highest of these hills are towards the N.E. side of the town, and\r\nfrom behind them flows a beautiful stream that at all seasons supplies it\r\nwith water; the inhabitants have a saying, that the place has neither bad\r\nwater nor good roads (em Arrayas não tem agoa roim, nem caminhos bons),\r\nand this is truly its characteristic. The town is of very small size,\r\nthe population not exceeding three hundred inhabitants, great and small.\r\nHere, as in other towns in the interior, many of the houses belong to the\r\nfazendeiros, who only occupy them during the festas; they are nearly all\r\narranged before a large square, on the east side of which the only church\r\nis situated. On our arrival I was surprised to observe a house with\r\nglazed windows, a rare sight in the interior of Brazil, but on nearer\r\ninspection, I found that the place of glass was supplied by plates of\r\ntalc, which is found abundantly in this neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay among the people of this place I found them universally\r\nkind and obliging, so far as their limited means permitted, for the\r\ngreater part are very poor; in most instances, however, this poverty is\r\noccasioned by their own indolence. It was with great difficulty that we\r\ncould purchase any thing in the shape of provisions, and it is still a\r\nmystery to me, how the great mass of the inhabitants contrive to live;\r\nhad it not been for the kindness of my good friend Senhor Lagoeira, who\r\nagain sent me supplies of provisions, we should often have been in a\r\nstate of starvation. Notwithstanding the smallness and the poverty of the\r\nplace, it contains two priests, neither of whom seemed to be the worst\r\nfed of the community. There are three public schools, two of which are\r\nelementary, one for boys, the other for girls; in the third, Latin only\r\nis taught. Here, as in all the other towns and villages in the interior,\r\nthe teachers are paid by government, and, consequently, the education of\r\nall classes is gratuitous; notwithstanding this, I was surprised to see\r\nthe small number who take advantage of so favourable an opportunity for\r\nthe education of their children. Those who live in the country, and who\r\nsend their children to school, are obliged to board them in the town,\r\nwhich is generally looked upon as a great grievance. Here, as elsewhere,\r\nI met with very few who have a taste for reading, and, generally, the\r\nonly books they possess are some small volumes of orisons. Even the\r\nlibraries of the priests are confined to a few religious and classical\r\nworks; and among these, a Bible is rarely to be met with, a mere\r\nabridgment of it supplying its place.\r\n\r\nThe rocks which compose the mountain range on which the town of Arrayas\r\nstands, all belong to the primary strata; these are nearly vertical,\r\nthe little inclination which they present, being towards the east, that\r\nbeing the direction of the highest part of the Serra. The most westerly\r\nof these rocks have an arenaceous schistose structure, and these overlay\r\na very compact greyish-coloured stratified rock, very much resembling\r\ngneiss, in which are imbedded innumerable rounded pebbles of granite\r\nand quartz, of all sizes from one to three or four inches, and which\r\nis probably equivalent to the grauwacke rocks of the old world. The\r\nlimestone of which the western side of the Serra is composed at Sapê and\r\nNatividade, is not found here, but I again met with it to the south; in\r\nnone of the rocks did I observe any appearance of organic remains.\r\n\r\nFrom its elevated situation, the climate of Arrayas is much cooler\r\nthan in the plains below, and the rains are both heavier and of longer\r\nduration; these always come from the N.E., beginning in October or\r\nNovember, and continuing till the month of April, or until a regular\r\nS.E. wind sets in, which is the first signal that the dry season has\r\ncommenced. The rearing of cattle is the most ordinary occupation of the\r\nfazendeiros, their cattle meeting with a ready sale in the Bahia market;\r\nbut they generally also cultivate a little sugar cane, principally for\r\nthe manufacture of rum, which is extensively used among all classes of\r\nsociety, and of course meets with a good sale. Mandiocca, rice, and\r\nIndian corn, are also cultivated, both for family use and for sale in the\r\nVilla. All these productions, however, are grown in the low countries,\r\nprincipally along the foot of the Serra; around the Villa itself little\r\nor nothing is cultivated, notwithstanding that the soil in many places\r\nis favourable for small plantations. Both the climate and soil seem\r\nwell adapted for the production of coffee, as the few small plantations\r\nthat have been attempted yield good crops, without any care having been\r\nbestowed on them; in the garden belonging to the house in which I lived,\r\nthere were about one hundred and fifty coffee plants, which in the end of\r\nApril were loaded as heavily with fruit as any I have seen in the large\r\nplantations in the province of Rio de Janeiro. This article, however, can\r\nnever be cultivated here to any extent, with a view to exportation, on\r\naccount of its great distance from the coast. The Rio Tocantins offers\r\nthe only water conveyance, and that as yet is only navigable for canoes\r\nof small burden. There are only two shopkeepers in the Villa, both of\r\nwhom bring their goods from Rio de Janeiro. They go there once in two\r\nor three years, the entire journey generally occupying from six to nine\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nThe diseases of this district are very similar to those which are common\r\nin the more northern part of the province. In the low country, which,\r\nduring the rainy season, is full of marshes and swamps, intermittent\r\nfevers are prevalent, and are often fatal to those coming from the\r\nupland districts. As very few only can afford to purchase sulphate of\r\nquinine, the general mode of curing these fevers is by emetics and\r\npurgatives, and occasionally by bitter barks obtained from the trees\r\nin the woods; of these the one most commonly used is procured from the\r\n_Strychnos pseudochina_ of St. Hilaire, a small tree which grows on the\r\nupland campos. A strong infusion of coffee with a mixture of salt is\r\nalso sometimes administered. Though the inhabitants of the plains are\r\nconstantly subject to the fever, they seldom die of the disease itself,\r\nbut the effects which it produces on the constitution after a long series\r\nof yearly attacks, ultimately cut off a great many. The principal organ\r\nthat becomes affected is the spleen, which is sometimes so much enlarged,\r\nthat it nearly fills the whole abdominal cavity; when travelling in\r\nthese districts, we seldom arrived at a house where I was not consulted\r\nrespecting enlargements of this organ. The liver is more rarely affected:\r\nits affections are generally produced by intemperance in eating and\r\ndrinking, and by the constant and immoderate use of tobacco. In the Villa\r\nintermittent fevers are unknown, in consequence of its being situated\r\nabove the region of miasmata, unless they appear in cases where the\r\ninfection has been imbibed below. The traveller before alluded to, who\r\ngave up the house for our use, left behind him an Indian servant, with\r\nno one to attend to him, and whom I found almost dead from the attacks\r\nof a severe tertian ague, but who soon recovered after being properly\r\ntreated. This poor fellow was a native of the banks of the Amazon, and he\r\nremained in my service until my arrival in Rio de Janeiro. These fevers\r\nvery often lose their intermittent character, and assume a malignant\r\nremittent nature. The prevailing diseases in the Villa are ophthalmia,\r\ncolds, inflammatory complaints, rheumatism, and dyspepsia; paralysis\r\nalso is common; and as a preventive, nearly all the people wear a thick\r\ntwisted iron ring, made on the Saturday of the passion week (sexta feira\r\nda Paixão), and blessed by a priest. Goître is common, but not nearly\r\nso much as in Natividade and Conceição. Here they attribute it to the\r\ncoldness of the water they use for drinking.\r\n\r\nThe country around Arrayas affords many prospects as highly picturesque\r\nand pleasing to the eye of a common observer as that of the naturalist;\r\nto the latter, however, it offers a double charm, owing to the great\r\nvariety in the objects which such diversity of soil and situation\r\npresents for his investigations. My excursions in various directions\r\nyielded me upwards of three hundred species of plants, all different from\r\nany I had elsewhere collected. The dry upland campos afforded numerous\r\ngrasses, which are nearly all coarse and rank, and not well suited for\r\npasturage; these grasses do not form a close turf, as in Europe, but\r\ngrow in scattered tufts, leaving greater intervals of bare soil than\r\nthe amount of surface actually covered by them; this, however, is not\r\napparent at first sight, for the culm is generally long, and when ripe,\r\nand seen from a distance, the campos appear as if covered with wheat or\r\noats. Many flowering shrubs and beautiful herbaceous plants are found\r\ngrowing among the grasses; of the former _Diplusodon_ and _Kielmeyera_\r\nare the most ornamental; one of the latter (_Kielmeyera rosea_, Mart.)\r\ngrows in bushes about a foot and a half high, and produces numerous large\r\nrose-coloured flowers, from which it has obtained the name of Rosa do\r\nCampo. Of the herbaceous plants of these tracts, the most beautiful are\r\nthose belonging to the Gentian tribe. A species of _Lisianthus_ produces\r\nlarge blue bell-shaped blossoms, not unlike those of the _Digitalis_ in\r\nshape; and towards the end of the rainy season, the fields are gaily\r\nadorned with two elegant species of _Callopisma_; one of these is more\r\nabundant than the other, and being intensely bitter, is used medicinally\r\nas gentian by the inhabitants of Goyaz, who collect it when in full\r\nflower, dried bundles of it being seen hanging up in almost every house;\r\nit is used, in infusion, in dyspepsia, and also to strengthen those who\r\nare recovering from fever. The trees of the upland Campos are mostly\r\nsmall, consisting chiefly of the beautiful Sicupíra (_Commilobium\r\npolygalæflorum_), _Qualea grandiflora_, and _Q. parviflora_, a\r\n_Vochysia_, _Salvertia convallariodora_, a _Panax_, an _Albertinia_, a\r\n_Lafoensia_, two species of _Cecropia_, the Mangába do Mono, the Cashew,\r\nand several species of _Mimosa_.\r\n\r\nTowards the latter end of the month of April, the whole north of the\r\nprovince of Goyaz was thrown into a state of alarm, in consequence of\r\ninformation received from San Pedro de Alcantará, a small town in the\r\nextreme north of the province, near the banks of the Rio Tocantins, that\r\na party of the troops of Raimundo Gomez, and the Balaio had crossed over\r\nfrom Pastos Boms in the province of Maranham, to Alcantará, and taken\r\nit by force; and that although the greater part of the more respectable\r\ninhabitants had fled to the woods, a number had been killed and robbed,\r\nwhile others had joined the rebels. Notice arrived at the same time\r\nthat all the canoes which had descended from the central parts of the\r\nprovince towards Pará (April being the month in which they generally\r\nstart), were taken, the owners killed, and the hides with which they\r\nwere laden thrown into the river. It was immediately surmised that the\r\ncanoes were captured for no other purpose than to ascend the river in\r\norder to devastate the towns and villages in this quarter, in the same\r\nmanner as they had attacked those below. On the 22nd of April I was\r\ncalled to a fazenda about three leagues to the north of Arrayas, to visit\r\na young lady, who was indisposed. When I arrived there, her father had\r\njust received a letter from the Vigario of Conceição, stating that a few\r\ndays before, the robbers had reached Porto Imperial, a village on the\r\nTocantins, only three days’ journey from the Villa de Natividade, and\r\nthat the inhabitants of the latter place were flying in all directions.\r\nOn my return to Arrayas, he sent by me a letter to the President of the\r\nCamara Municipal, containing the above information, who immediately\r\ncalled a meeting of the principal inhabitants to take into consideration\r\nwhat steps were necessary in this exigency; it was agreed that the\r\nNational Guard should be called out by beat of drum, but although the\r\ntown possessed such an instrument, unfortunately there was no one able\r\nto use it, until one of my men, a black from Natividade, asked my leave\r\nto offer his services. Accordingly the drum beat to arms round the town,\r\nbut not more than half a dozen men made their appearance. Next morning\r\nthey were again called out, when about a dozen assembled, nearly all\r\nwithout arms. These few were immediately put under drill by a fazendeiro\r\nwho happened to be in town, and who, although bearing the rank of ensign\r\nin the National Guards, appeared quite ignorant of the task he undertook.\r\nThe Juiz de Paz was immediately summoned from his fazenda, and expresses\r\nsent off to the city of Goyaz to inform the President, as well as the\r\nintermediate towns; orders were likewise issued to the different parts\r\nof the district to assemble the whole of the National Guard. In the\r\ncourse of four or five days above a hundred and forty men appeared in\r\nthe Villa, the greater part of them armed with their own fowling-pieces,\r\nbut there were no muskets, gunpowder, or ball in the place. Those who\r\nhad no guns, armed themselves with their long knives, firmly tied to the\r\nends of short poles; like the troops of Piauhy, they formed the most\r\nmotley group imaginable, being of all colours, of all sizes, and without\r\nany uniform. They remained under drill for about eight days, at the\r\nexpiration of which time, news arrived that the previous information had\r\nbeen premature, and that the rebels, amounting to about five hundred men,\r\nall well armed, were still in Alcantará. Immediately on receiving this\r\ninformation, the Juiz de Paz dismissed his troops, with the exception of\r\nten men, kept as a guard for the protection of the Villa. In proportion\r\nto the number of inhabitants which this district contains, the number\r\nof National Guards assembled on this occasion, was greater than in any\r\nof the districts of Piauhy; but I had doubts whether one half of them\r\nwould have responded to a second call, as these poor fellows who had\r\nbeen suddenly called away from their houses and families, most of them\r\nafter a long journey which they had to make on foot, were not satisfied\r\nwith the treatment they received from the authorities, for they found\r\non their arrival, that no accommodation had been provided for them,\r\nexcept an old house, the walls of which were raised but little above the\r\nground, where, more like pigs than human beings, they were all stowed\r\ntogether. Had the weather been fine, the greater part of them would have\r\npreferred sleeping in the open air, but unfortunately much rain, at this\r\ntime, fell at night. Moreover, during the whole period they remained in\r\nthe Villa, not one sixpence was expended in procuring provisions for\r\nthem, and had it not been for the charity of some of the inhabitants,\r\nthey would certainly have either starved, or been driven to take food by\r\nforce. When some of them applied to the Juiz de Paz for provisions, he\r\ntold them he did not like to appropriate any of the funds belonging to\r\nthe town to such a purpose, as these were absolutely required for the\r\nerection of a new jail, which they had in contemplation! A few hours\r\nbefore their dismissal, they mustered in the church to hear mass, after\r\nwhich the Juiz de Paz gave each of them a glass of rum, and this was all\r\nthe remuneration they received for their services. When the news first\r\narrived that the rebels had reached Porto Imperial, several inhabitants\r\nof the Villa, who had previously boasted of the feats of bravery they\r\nwould perform, should the enemy advance as far south as Arrayas, were\r\nthe first to pack up their valuables, in readiness to decamp on a short\r\nnotice; and none of the women were now to be seen with the rings on their\r\nfingers, or in their ears, or with the gold chains which they usually\r\nwear round their necks.\r\n\r\nThe proper season for travelling having now arrived, I became desirous\r\nto resume my journey, so as to reach Rio de Janeiro, if possible, before\r\nthe setting in of the next rains. Thanks to the kindness of my excellent\r\nfriend Senhor Lagoeira, who supplied me with the greater portion of our\r\nprovisions from his fazenda, my funds had not been much encroached on\r\nduring our stay in Arrayas. By my profession, I gained even more than\r\nwas expended, by which I was thus enabled to add four fine horses to my\r\ntroop, which now therefore amounted to sixteen in all. On the 4th of May\r\nI went to Sapê, to take leave of my friend, and to bring back my horses,\r\nwhich had been pasturing there since our arrival; knowing that I was\r\nabout to leave, he had prepared an ox, and other articles of provision\r\nfor our journey. The parting with this truly good person, with whom,\r\nin a strange land, I had lived on terms of intimacy, from whom I had\r\nexperienced kindness that I could never have expected, and with whom I\r\nhad no earthly chance of again meeting, produced a feeling of depression\r\nwhich hung over me many days after my departure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nARRAYAS TO SAN ROMÃO.\r\n\r\n    Departure from Arrayas—Reasons for preferring the Route\r\n    along the Serra Geral—Passes Gamelleira—Bonita—Reaches San\r\n    Domingo—San Joäo—San Bernardo—Curious Fact respecting the\r\n    Rio San Bernardo—Passes Boa Vista—Country consists of very\r\n    elevated table-lands—Its Natural Productions—Arrives at Capella\r\n    da Posse—San Pedro—San Antonio—Dôres—Riachão—Animals greatly\r\n    tormented by large Bats—Habits of these Vampires—Reaches\r\n    San Vidal—Flight of Locusts—Passes Nossa Senhora\r\n    d’Abbadia—Campinhas—Pasquada—San Francisco—Crosses River\r\n    Carynhenha and enters the Province of Minas Geräes—Country\r\n    described—Habits of the great Ant-eater—Passes Capão de\r\n    Casca—Descent of the Serra das Araras—Reaches San Josè—Rio\r\n    Claro—Boquerão—Santa Maria—Espigão—Taboca—San Miguel—Crosses\r\n    River Urucuya—Passes Riachão—Arrives at San Romão—Town\r\n    Described—Its Population—Habits of the People—Rio de San\r\n    Francisco—Description of the different varieties of the Salmon\r\n    tribe found in it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe necessary preparations having been completed, we started from\r\nArrayas on the afternoon of the 6th of May, my object being now to reach\r\nthe Villa de San Romão on the Rio de San Francisco; but instead of\r\nproceeding southward along the western base of the Serra Geral as far\r\nas the parallel of San Romão, the road usually followed by the people\r\nof the country, I preferred the less frequented, and consequently the\r\nmore difficult route, that leads along the Serra itself. My reasons for\r\nadopting this plan were, in the first place, because the low country to\r\nthe westward had already been travelled over by Pohl and Burchell, and\r\npartly by Spix and Martius; and secondly, because I always preferred\r\nelevated regions, on account of the greater diversity of vegetation met\r\nwith in such situations. We were accompanied for about half a league\r\nout of the Villa by a few of the more respectable inhabitants. Shortly\r\nafter the return of my friends, we descended the Serra on which the Villa\r\nstands, by a very rocky path, but this descent was not nearly so great as\r\nthe ascent on the opposite side, and although we now found ourselves in\r\na comparatively flat country, we were still at a considerable elevation.\r\nAfter proceeding half a league, we encamped for the night under some\r\ntrees by the side of a small stream; here we slung our hammocks, but soon\r\nafter midnight the cold became so great, from the wind that blew down\r\nfrom the Serra, that we could not sleep; and long before daybreak we were\r\nglad to rise, and seat ourselves round a large fire, such as we always\r\nmade it a rule to burn every night we slept in the open air.\r\n\r\nA journey of four long leagues on the following day, brought us to the\r\nfazenda Gamelleira, where we passed the night under a large fig-tree,\r\nthere being only one small house belonging to the vaqueiro. This fazenda\r\nbelongs to a widow lady, Dona Maria Rosa, at whose house we spent some\r\ntime during the middle of the day. Soon after leaving Gamelleira, we\r\nentered a virgin forest quite unlike any I had seen since leaving the\r\nProvince of Rio de Janeiro, and which I little expected to find in the\r\ndistrict where we were now travelling. It contained many large trees,\r\ncovered with numerous parasitical _Orchideæ_. The forest was about a\r\nleague in length, after which we entered upon an elevated thinly-wooded\r\ntract, where we halted to breakfast under a beautiful shady wild-fig\r\n(Gamelleira). In the afternoon we accomplished another two leagues, and\r\npassed the night at a fazenda called Mangê, the road leading over a\r\nthinly-wooded Chapada.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 9th, after a ride of a league and a half, we rested\r\non the banks of a small brook under a group of Buriti palms. The first\r\npart of our journey we found to be hilly and stony, with intermediate\r\nwell-wooded low tracts, but the latter part of it was through a most\r\nbeautiful country of fine open grassy campos, with occasional large\r\nwide-spreading trees. In the afternoon, we travelled a league and a half\r\nthrough a country even still more beautiful than that through which we\r\npassed in the morning. We ascended a slight elevation that led to a\r\nflat Chapada, rather thinly-wooded, abounding in a rank kind of grass,\r\na species of _Andropogon_, growing in large isolated tufts, and about\r\nthree feet high, after passing through which we entered an open campo\r\ncountry. From the termination of the Chapada, there is a fine view of a\r\nlarge Serra, which runs from north to south, but not of great elevation\r\nand almost perfectly level as far as the eye could reach; this is the\r\nwestern side of the most elevated portion of the Serra Geral. It was\r\nnot till some time after sunset, that we could find a convenient place\r\nfor encamping, but the moon shone brightly, and we proceeded without\r\ninconvenience. The place where we halted at last was under some small\r\ntrees near the side of a wood, but we little anticipated the plague\r\nwe were about to encounter; in half an hour we discovered that it was\r\nswarming with the Carrapato Miudo, and so numerous that our bodies were\r\nsoon covered with them. As it was now too late to shift our quarters,\r\nour only remedy was to set fire to the grass around our encampment.\r\nThis being done we washed ourselves with a strong infusion of tobacco,\r\nwhich destroyed the Carrapato, and then with tepid water to prevent any\r\nbad effects from the tobacco, a remedy usually adopted by the vaqueiros\r\nwhose occupations lead them daily into places infested by these annoying\r\ninsects. Having thus secured ourselves from any further attacks from this\r\npest, we slept soundly, and resuming our journey early next morning, we\r\ntravelled three leagues and a half through a flat sandy bushy country,\r\nreaching about mid-day a small fazenda called Bonita, where we remained\r\ntill the following day. The small house belonging to the proprietor of\r\nthis fazenda is situated on a slight eminence, which commands a fine view\r\nof the surrounding flat country. He formerly lived in a somewhat lower\r\nspot at a little distance, but as his family suffered constantly from\r\nague, he removed to this place, since which they have been free from\r\nthis complaint, although the difference of elevation is not more than a\r\nhundred feet.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the Juiz de Paz of the district, who lives about two\r\nleagues to the north of Bonita, passed, and learning that we were\r\nstrangers, and about to visit the Arraial de San Domingo, a little\r\nvillage two leagues and a half distant, he told me that he was on the way\r\nthither himself, and that his own house, which he only occupied during\r\nfesta times, was much at my service during my stay there. The distance\r\nbetween Bonita and the village is said to be about two leagues and a\r\nhalf, but they proved to be very long ones. The road till within a short\r\ndistance of the village is pretty level, and generally sandy, but it\r\nafterwards became more hilly and stony; it leads southward along the base\r\nof the Serra Geral, but generally a mile or more to the west of it; the\r\ntop of the Serra still continued to be level with a precipitous face, the\r\nrock being of a reddish-yellow. Shortly after leaving Bonita, an elevated\r\npyramidal peak of the same elevation as the Serra, is descried to the\r\nS.E. presenting a remarkable resemblance to some enormous work of art; it\r\nstands about a quarter of a mile distant from the Serra, and is placed\r\nupon a broad regular base.\r\n\r\nWe reached the Arraial de San Domingo a little before sunset, and took\r\nup our residence in the house of the Juiz de Paz. Like the rest of\r\nthe houses it was built of large unburned bricks, with the partitions\r\nformed of wicker-work, plastered with clay, smoothed by the hand of the\r\noperator, and ornamented all over with the strokes left by his fingers.\r\nThe village stands among some small hills about a league to the west\r\nof the Serra Geral; it is very insignificant, containing only about\r\nforty houses, a great many of which, belonging to the fazendeiros,\r\nare untenanted, except during the festas; a small limpid stream runs\r\nnear it, which flows with great rapidity, but it contains no fish, as\r\nthey are prevented from ascending by a cataract which exists at some\r\ndistance below the village. We remained here two days, endeavouring to\r\nhire another man to assist in the management of my troop, but I had much\r\ndifficulty in finding one, notwithstanding there were plenty of young\r\nmen idling about, who had no disposition to work for a livelihood. It is\r\na common saying in these parts, that for every ten who work, there are\r\nninety who do nothing, and maintain a wretched existence by hunting and\r\nrobbing their more industrious neighbours. Having heard of a man who had\r\nalready made a journey to Minas Geräes, I sent for him, and found him\r\nwilling to engage with me; but just as we were concluding the agreement\r\nhis wife came up and abused me violently for enticing her husband away\r\nfrom her. She was a large mulatto woman, old and ugly, and what very much\r\nsurprised me, a slave, while he, who was also a mulatto, was a freeman,\r\nand considerably younger. They had done little but quarrel during the six\r\nyears they had been married, and he seemed now determined to get rid of\r\nher; he therefore told her, that though she had governed him for a very\r\nlong time, she should do so no longer. We could not, however, get rid of\r\nher, till he promised that he would not remain more than a month with me;\r\nwhen that time expired, he did not feel inclined to return, but went on\r\nwith me to the Gold District, when he got employment at one of the mines.\r\n\r\nEverything being at length arranged, we started early on the morning of\r\nthe 14th, and travelling southward, still keeping on the eastern side\r\nof the Serra, we arrived, on the forenoon of the following day, at a\r\nfazenda called San João, and as our provisions were nearly exhausted,\r\nI determined to obtain a fresh supply here, if possible. On making\r\nenquiries of the owner, he informed me that as he had no cattle near\r\nthe house, it would be two or three days, at least, before a cow or ox\r\ncould be brought from a pasture, which was seven leagues distant; to this\r\nof course I was obliged to consent, as we were now in a country where\r\nprovisions were not easily obtained. In the afternoon, I went down to\r\nbathe in a little stream which passes at some distance from the house,\r\nand, seeing a plant in flower among some bushes on the bank, I went in\r\namong them to collect it, but when I came out again, I found that I had\r\npaid dearly for so doing, as my trowsers and shirt, as well as my hands\r\nand legs, which were bare, were thickly covered with small carrapatos.\r\nAs no time was to be lost I again took off my clothes and rushed into\r\nthe stream; it caused me much trouble to clear my shirt and trowsers of\r\nthese annoying insects, and I afterwards took great care not to walk much\r\nabout in this neighbourhood. It was not till the morning of the second\r\nday that a fine fat cow was brought, and although killed immediately,\r\nthe flesh was not dry enough to be packed for two days more. The owner\r\nof the fazenda, Captain Faustino Vieira, we found to be of a very\r\nniggardly disposition, and much less hospitable than the fazendeiros I\r\nhad generally met with in this province. Although his house was a good\r\nand commodious one, we had during our stay to put up in an open shed,\r\nwhich served to cover the sugar mill belonging to the farm. He was most\r\nexorbitant in his charges for all we had purchased of him, requiring one\r\nhalf more for the cow than its usual price in that part of the country;\r\nhe charged in like manner for the farinha, and the Indian corn for my\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\nOn the day we left San João, we made a journey of three long leagues,\r\nand put up for the night at the Fazenda de San Bernardo. During the\r\nafternoon, one of the horses in passing between two trees broke his\r\npack-saddle, and it was necessary to remain here half the following\r\nday, in order to get it properly repaired; in the interval I went out\r\nto botanize near a large marsh, through which a small river runs. This\r\nriver, as well as several others about the same size, which we passed\r\nboth before and after we left San João, loses itself beneath a low serra\r\nof limestone which runs parallel with the Serra Geral, and nearly two\r\nleagues to the west of it. These rivers take their rise in the Serra\r\nGeral, and are said to enter beneath the range before mentioned, where\r\nthey all unite, and at the distance of three leagues still further to the\r\nwestward, they again appear above ground in one stream, forming the Rio\r\nde San Bernardo, which afterwards falls into the Rio Parannan. A person\r\nbelonging to the fazenda took me down to see the spot where the stream,\r\nthat passes this place, disappears in the mountains, when contrary to\r\nwhat I expected, I found that it did not enter by an open cave, but by an\r\naperture far below the surface of the water, forming what the Brazilians\r\ncall a Soumidouro; the current here runs with considerable rapidity,\r\nstrikes against the nearly perpendicular face of the limestone rock, and\r\nforming a few whirlpools is lost in the gulf below. By these streams the\r\nremains of many of the animals of the country must be entombed in the\r\ndeep caverns through which they pass, and it is not impossible that such\r\ndeposits may, at some distant epoch, form themes for the speculation\r\nof future geologists. As it was late in the afternoon before we left\r\nSan Bernardo, we could not complete more than a league of our journey,\r\nthrough a country very similar to that on the other side of San Domingo.\r\nNext morning after accomplishing a very long league and a half, we rested\r\nto breakfast at a little habitation called Boa Vista, but inappropriately\r\nnamed, for not only is it situated in a hollow, but is surrounded by\r\ntrees. The house had a miserable appearance, but the old woman to whom it\r\nbelonged offered us much civility and attention, and gave us some sweet\r\nlimes, which we relished exceedingly after our exposure to a burning\r\nsun. The country here is of an undulating character, and rather thickly\r\nwooded, though the soil is poor, being very sandy. During these journeys\r\nmy collections were much increased by the addition of many fine shrubs\r\nand herbaceous plants, the dry sandy campos abounding with numerous\r\nspecies of _Diplusodon_, elegant little shrubs with rose-coloured\r\nflowers; while the moister portions afforded a rich harvest of curious\r\nvarieties of _Eriocaulon_, having little resemblance to our humble\r\nBritish species, being tall and branched, and very remarkable from the\r\nlarge white balls of flowers which each branch bears at its extremity.\r\nIn the afternoon we made another journey of two leagues, the road being\r\nthrough a hilly elevated country, in which we met with several gradual\r\nascents, that always terminate in flat, sandy, thinly-wooded chapadas.\r\nAfter travelling about a league, we came very close to the Serra Geral,\r\nand continued our journey along its base, till we reached a convenient\r\nspot where we encamped under some trees by the side of an open swamp,\r\nin the centre of which grew a large grove of Buriti palms; we had been\r\ngradually ascending, for we were not more than two hundred feet below the\r\nsummit of the Serra; our elevated situation, and a smart breeze which\r\nbegan to blow after sunset, caused us to pass a colder night than we had\r\ndone for some time.\r\n\r\nAnother journey of two long leagues brought us about mid-day to the\r\nlittle village of Capella da Posse, our route leading us through a\r\nbeautiful upland country. It was for the most part of an undulating\r\ncharacter, the road sometimes passing through large open campos,\r\ncontaining small clusters of Buriti and other palms, at others through\r\ndensely wooded hollows, and not unfrequently along the bushy margins of\r\nopen sandy marshes, abounding in curious _Eriocaulons_. Within a few\r\nmiles of Posse, the mountain range takes a sweep to the S.E., and the\r\nroad consequently diverges from the Serra, to gain the village, lying\r\nto the southward, which is surrounded by a flat, arid, and very sandy\r\ncountry, covered with a few scattered stunted trees and shrubs. The\r\nvillage we found to be of the most miserable description; it contains\r\nabout a dozen small houses, and a very little church; the place is so\r\npoor that it cannot support a priest, for one who came to settle among\r\nthe inhabitants about a year before our visit left, because they either\r\ncould not or would not pay him more than half the salary he was promised.\r\nIt was late on the following day before we left, as I remained to arrange\r\nthe large collection made between San Domingo and this place. Hitherto\r\nwe had avoided travelling along the upper part of the Serra, on account\r\nof the difficulty of finding water, but beyond Posse, the comparatively\r\nflat sandy country merges into the mountain range, and our course\r\nwas therefore now in a S.E. direction. On the second night after our\r\ndeparture, we arrived at a little hamlet, about five leagues distant,\r\ncalled San Pedro; it consists of about half a dozen small houses, and\r\na little chapel. We passed the night in an open shed, between two of\r\nthe houses, and on rising in the morning Mr. Walker missed some of his\r\nclothes; it was very fortunate that nothing else had disappeared, for we\r\nwere afterwards informed that the whole place was nothing better than\r\na nest of robbers. The fazendeiro who gave us this information said,\r\nthat whenever he had occasion to sleep there, and had money with him,\r\nhe always hid it in the bush at some distance until the morning. During\r\nthe whole of my travels, I always avoided sleeping in the open air if\r\npossible, whenever two or three houses were seen together, otherwise\r\nsome little thing or other was always sure to disappear; indeed, in the\r\ndry season, and where the country suited, it was always preferable to\r\nencamp at some distance from any habitation, especially in the thinly\r\ninhabited districts. Next day we only travelled a league and a half, and\r\npassed the afternoon and night at the fazenda de San Antonio, the owner\r\nof which was a coloured man, and very hospitable. Leaving this place\r\nearly in the morning, a journey of two very long leagues brought us to\r\nthe next fazenda called Dôres, but we found that for some time it had\r\nbeen deserted by its inhabitants. The country through which we passed\r\non our journey there, was nearly one continued elevated sandy plain,\r\nwith occasional large open marshy campos, but these only existed where\r\nany slight declivity was seen. About half way we came to a long narrow\r\nvalley, in the centre of which was observed a small and very deep river,\r\nwith a rapid current, over which we passed by a wretched old bridge,\r\nformed of the trunks of two trees, traversed by smaller branches very\r\nloosely laid together, so that I was glad when I saw the last of the\r\nhorses safely across, on account of the great risk of their feet slipping\r\nbetween the cross sticks. In the afternoon, we went a league further to\r\na fazenda called Picada, which, like most of the houses we had lately\r\nseen, was very small; it belonged to a mulatto, with a large family, who\r\nseemed to be in no very affluent circumstances. Among the numerous plants\r\ncollected on these journeys, was one, the root of which is celebrated\r\nby the inhabitants of these districts, as a cure for the bite of the\r\nrattle-snake. It is a suffruticose species of _Trixis_, about four feet\r\nhigh, with rather large clammy leaves; the root has a musky smell, and\r\nit is even said that the smell alone is sufficient to kill a snake; they\r\ncall it raiz da cobra.\r\n\r\nWe started from Picada early, but did not proceed more than a league,\r\nbeing detained on the road by an accident that befell the Indian guide I\r\nhad hired at Arrayas: he was walking behind another of the men, who was\r\nmounted on a spirited young horse, when on a sudden, probably from the\r\nsting of some insect, it started, casting up its heels in the air, and\r\nafter striking the poor Indian a violent blow in the stomach, set off\r\nat full gallop, throwing its rider, but without doing him any harm. I\r\nsent forward the troop in charge of Mr. Walker, while I remained behind\r\nto attend to the Indian who seemed to be in much pain; he was greatly\r\nrelieved by a little water for which we had to wait a long time before it\r\ncould be procured, he was then placed on a quiet horse, and led slowly\r\nto the nearest house two miles distant, but by the time we reached it,\r\nhe became so weak that his pulse was scarcely sensible. After giving him\r\na cup of strong warm tea, the only stimulus that was to be procured, his\r\npulse rose considerably, when I bled him in the arm, which relieved him\r\ngreatly; and he gradually recovered, so that we were enabled to resume\r\nour journey in the afternoon of the following day.\r\n\r\nWe stopped at a place called Riachão, which consisted of three houses,\r\nabout a quarter of a mile distant from each other. Here, for the third\r\ntime only since I left Arrayas, I was able to purchase some Indian corn\r\nfor my horses; they stood in much need of it, as the pastures were\r\nnow very poor, consisting of coarse, dry, innutritious grasses. The\r\ninhabitants of this district are so desperately lazy that they scarcely\r\nplant sufficient of anything for their own use, notwithstanding the\r\nunlimited extent of ground that each family possesses. For several nights\r\nbefore we reached this place, the horses were greatly annoyed by bats,\r\nwhich are very numerous on this Serra, where they inhabit the caves in\r\nthe limestone rocks; during the night we remained at Riachão, the whole\r\nof my troop suffered more from their attacks, than they had done before\r\non any previous occasion. All exhibited one or more streams of clotted\r\nblood on their shoulders and backs, which had run from the wounds made by\r\nthese animals, and from which they had sucked their fill of blood; when\r\na small sore exists on the back of a horse, they always prefer making\r\ntheir incision in that place. The owner of the house where we stopped\r\ninformed me, that he was not able to rear cattle here, on account of the\r\ndestruction made by the bats among the calves, so that he was obliged to\r\nkeep them at a considerable distance in a lower part of the country; even\r\nthe pigs did not escape their attacks.\r\n\r\nThe singular creatures which are productive of so much annoyance,\r\nconstitute the genus _Phyllostoma_, so named from the leaf-like\r\nappendage attached to their upper lip; they are peculiar to the continent\r\nof America, being distributed over the immense extent of territory\r\nbetween Paraguay and the Isthmus of Darien. Their tongue, which is\r\ncapable of considerable extension, is furnished at its extremity with a\r\nnumber of papillæ, which appear to be so arranged as to form an organ\r\nof suction, and their lips have also tubercles symmetrically arranged;\r\nthese are the organs by which they draw the life-blood both from man\r\nand beast. These animals are the famous vampires, of which various\r\ntravellers have given such redoubtable accounts, and which are known to\r\nhave nearly destroyed the first establishment of Europeans in the new\r\nworld. The molar teeth of the true vampire or spectre bat, are of the\r\nmost carnivorous character, the first being short and almost plain, the\r\nothers sharp and cutting, and terminating in three and four points. Their\r\nrough tongue has been supposed to be the instrument employed for abrading\r\nthe skin, so as to enable them more readily to abstract the blood, but\r\nzoologists are now agreed that such supposition is wholly groundless.\r\nHaving carefully examined, in many cases, the wounds thus made on horses,\r\nmules, pigs, and other animals, observations that have been confirmed\r\nby information received from the inhabitants of the northern parts of\r\nBrazil, I am led to believe that the puncture which the vampire makes\r\nin the skin of animals, is effected by the sharp hooked nail of its\r\nthumb, and that from the wound thus made, it abstracts the blood by the\r\nsuctorial powers of its lips and tongue. That these bats attack man as\r\nwell as animals is certain, for I have frequently been shown the scars of\r\ntheir punctures in the toes of many who had suffered from their attacks,\r\nbut I never met with a recent case. They grow to a large size, and I have\r\nkilled some that measure two feet between the tips of the wings.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon when we left Riachão, and we halted about\r\na league beyond it, under some trees, by the side of a small marsh,\r\nhaving been informed that the next watering place was more than a league\r\nfurther on. We were now travelling along the Chapada, or flat top of the\r\nSerra, and I observed that the little streams we had been crossing for\r\nsome time all flowed to the eastward, to empty themselves into the Rio\r\nde San Francisco. We suffered from the cold during the night, and were\r\nbesides much annoyed by a large species of mosquito, the bite of which\r\nwas very painful, and on the following morning our hands and faces were\r\ngreatly swollen in consequence. We did not get away from this place\r\ntill about mid-day, owing to one of the horses having strayed to some\r\ndistance, but this loss of time was compensated by successful botanizing\r\nmade in the neighbourhood. We now passed through a rather dense wood\r\nin a hollow, the road being dreadfully bad in consequence of the great\r\nnumber of large rocks of limestone abounding there. The remainder of this\r\nmorning’s journey, of a league and a half, was through a flat, open,\r\nand rather sandy country, when we halted for a short time by the side\r\nof another marsh, which afforded both water and good pasturage for the\r\nhorses. In the afternoon we accomplished a further distance of two very\r\nlong leagues, and spent the night at a small fazenda called San Vidal.\r\nTwo leagues beyond this place, we reached the banks of a small river,\r\ntoo deep to allow of the horses passing with their loads. We were told\r\nat San Vidal that we should find a bridge, but we met with only the\r\nremains of one; after much trouble in searching along the swampy banks,\r\nwe found at length a spot that answered as a ford, where all the loads\r\nwere carried over on the men’s heads, a task which occupied about an hour\r\nand a half. We halted on the other side of the river, under the shade\r\nof a large _Vochysia_, which was then covered with its long spikes of\r\nyellow flowers. During the time we lost in crossing, and for more than\r\nan hour afterwards an immense flight of a large greyish-coloured locust,\r\npassed from south to north. They did not keep continuously on the wing,\r\nbut alighted and rose again at short intervals, and thousands of them\r\nwhich fell into the stream were carried down by the current. They did\r\nnot fly above twelve feet from the ground, and their constant rise and\r\ndescent gave the air very much the appearance of falling flakes of snow.\r\nThe country through which we passed after leaving San Vidal, is nearly\r\none continued flat, sandy, bushy plain, thinly wooded in some places with\r\nsmall trees, among which occasionally appeared a fine palm, with a stem\r\nabout twelve feet high; large tracts had lately been burned according\r\nto the general custom at this season. In many places these sandy plains\r\nwere beautifully adorned with a dwarf species of _Diplusodon_, covered\r\nwith rose-coloured flowers, and small leaves, greatly reminding me of the\r\nheather of my native country. A _Vellozia_, with a stem about four feet\r\nhigh, was also very common, as well as several elegant stemless palms. In\r\nthe evening we went on about a league and a half, and passed the night\r\nunder some trees by the side of a small river, very similar to that we\r\ncrossed in the morning. During the whole of this day’s journey, we were\r\ngreatly annoyed by the numerous stragglers of the flight of locusts that\r\nwere following their companions, and which sometimes nearly blinded us by\r\nstriking against our faces. My little monkey amused herself by catching\r\nthem as they passed, and they appeared a favourite food with her; to\r\nprevent their escaping, for she had frequently three at a time in her\r\npossession, she secured them by biting off their heads as soon as they\r\nwere caught.\r\n\r\nThe river on the north side of which we slept, was very deep, and I was\r\ngreatly annoyed to find that a small bridge, that had been thrown across\r\nit, had been nearly carried away by the floods, so that we were again\r\nput to the trouble of having all the luggage carried over; this occupied\r\nabout an hour, when we lost no time in resuming our journey, in the hope\r\nof reaching some habitation where I could ascertain whether we were on\r\nthe right path towards a little hamlet through which I wished to pass,\r\ncalled Nossa Senhora d’Abadia. After leaving the river, we ascended a\r\nlow hill, on the top of which is a somewhat thickly wooded Chapada, and\r\nwe spent nearly half an hour in crossing it. Having accomplished this,\r\nwe saw at some distance in a hollow, a few small houses with a church,\r\nwhich proved to be the little hamlet we were in quest of. It consisted\r\nof half a dozen miserable small huts formed of wicker-work and clay, and\r\nthatched with palm leaves, the church being also constructed of the same\r\nmaterials; the houses were all in a state of decay, and uninhabited,\r\nwith the exception of one, in which we found a mulatto woman and a few\r\nchildren. I had hoped to procure here some corn for my horses, but none\r\nwas to be had. I asked the woman if she could direct us to the Arraial\r\nof Formozo, but all the information she could give was that it was three\r\nleagues distant; not only had she never been there, but had never gone\r\nhalf a league beyond the spot where she lived: she told us, however, that\r\nif we went to the house of the Juiz de Paz of the district, who lived\r\nabout half a league from Abadia, he would give us all the information\r\nwe wanted. We proceeded there accordingly, and found his house to be\r\nscarcely better than those we had just left, and the Juiz himself, a\r\nlittle meagre old man, with a grey beard that appeared never to have\r\nfelt a razor. When I asked, according to the custom of the country, if\r\nhe would allow us to pass the middle of the day with him, he said he was\r\nsorry he could not give us accommodation, as two travelling merchants\r\nfrom the Rio de San Francisco, occupied the only spare room in his\r\nhouse. As the day was fine, we took up our quarters beneath the shade\r\nof a large tree, called Pao Parahiba (_Simaba versicolor_, St. Hil.),\r\nwhich grew before his house. Still wishing to give the horses a feed\r\nof Indian corn, I solicited the old man as a favour to sell me a small\r\nquantity, but he assured me he had not a single grain in his possession;\r\nthis however I scarcely believed, as I saw heaps of husks lying about,\r\nand not long after, one of my men was informed by a slave belonging to\r\nthe place, that his master had plenty. In the course of the day, having\r\nlearned my profession, he came to consult me respecting a complaint of\r\nthe chest, under which he had been labouring for about eight days; but\r\nI very coolly told him, that being aware he had plenty of corn, I would\r\nnot attend to his complaint until he had sold me as much as would provide\r\na good feed for all my horses. He now confessed he had a little, and\r\nwould try to spare as much as I wanted; in half an hour he sent out about\r\na bushel, for which I immediately paid him the usual price, about two\r\nshillings. I found him labouring under a slight attack of inflammation of\r\nthe lungs, for which I bled him, and left him some medicine to take. I\r\ncould not however ascertain his reason for refusing me the corn in the\r\nfirst instance, but my medical knowledge ultimately acted like a charm in\r\nprocuring it.\r\n\r\nWhen we left the house of the Juiz de Paz in the afternoon, he directed\r\nus to Formozo, but as will be seen, not sufficiently clearly. We started\r\nearly with the intention of making a long stage, and after travelling\r\ntwo very long leagues, we arrived at a small house in a hollow, where\r\ntwo men, a negro and a mulatto, were making Farinha de Mandiocca. From\r\nthem we learned we were on the wrong road for Formozo; and when I asked\r\nleave to pass the night here, they assured me we should find much\r\nbetter accommodation a little way further on. As the hut was small, I\r\naccordingly pushed on towards the place indicated, hoping to obtain good\r\nshelter, as it had been thundering all the afternoon, and seemed likely\r\nsoon to rain; but when we had travelled half an hour without meeting\r\nwith any signs of a house, we reached a small muddy stream, just as it\r\nwas getting dusk, in crossing which one of the horses fell with its load\r\nof specimens of dried plants in large skin boxes, by which the plants\r\nbecame soaked; this was all the more vexatious, as some of these parcels\r\nwere the same that had formerly suffered on the journey from Duro to\r\nNatividade. After passing this stream, we went on pretty quickly for\r\nabout another half hour, when we arrived at a small uninhabited house in\r\na very ruined condition, but as the roof was in great measure entire, we\r\ndetermined to remain here for the night. We were much incensed against\r\nthe men who gave us such wilfully false information, for just as the\r\nluggage was taken off the horses, it began to rain heavily, accompanied\r\nby a strong wind; and notwithstanding that we covered the open patches\r\nin the roof and walls as well as we could with skins, it was two hours\r\nbefore we could manage to keep a candle lighted. Towards midnight the\r\nstorm ceased, when we kindled a large fire in front of the house, which\r\nhelped to warm and dry us.\r\n\r\nOn the following day we examined the collections that had been wetted,\r\nand as the sun shone brightly, we dried them by spreading them out on the\r\nsheets of paper in which they were packed; this task having occupied\r\nnearly the whole day, we passed the following night under the same\r\nshelter. In the afternoon I took a walk a little way along the banks of\r\na small stream which flows into a large marsh, lined on each side with\r\nBuriti palms, and other trees and shrubs, where I collected a number of\r\nfine plants. Next morning before starting, Mr. Walker, in searching for\r\na ring to fasten into the end of one of our trunks, had a very narrow\r\nescape from being bitten by a rattle-snake: the ring had been laid down\r\nin a corner of the room, and putting his hand to search for it in the\r\ndark, he felt something soft which he was just about to lift, when to his\r\nhorror he discovered it to be a rattle-snake. No time was lost in killing\r\nthis frightful reptile, which was found to measure nearly five feet in\r\nlength; I had slept all night within two feet of it. We left this place\r\non the morning of the first of June, and after travelling about a league,\r\ncame in sight of some houses which were supposed to be Formozo, but were\r\ninformed the place was called Campinhas, and that we had left the former\r\nplace behind us a little to the westward. Half a league further on, we\r\nhalted during the middle of the day, in the house of an Indian, at a\r\nplace called Pasquada; when we arrived, the man was absent working in his\r\nplantation, but his wife received us with great hospitality, immediately\r\nsending one of her boys with a large basket of oranges and another of\r\nsweet potatoes, and a few eggs, treating us in a very different manner\r\nfrom that to which we had been for some time accustomed. From this place\r\nwe went on about two leagues, and encamped for the night under a large\r\ntree, called by the inhabitants Folha larga (_Salvertia convallariodora_,\r\nSt. Hil.). The nature of the country still continued to be very much the\r\nsame as that we had traversed since we had reached the table-land of\r\nthe Serra. On the dry grassy flats, I met with a few specimens of the\r\nbeautiful Amaranthaceous plant which Martius has described under the name\r\nof _Gomphrena officinalis_, and which is well known to the people of the\r\ncountry by its vernacular name of Para-todo. It has a large tuberous\r\nroot, which is very much used as a purgative, and as its name implies,\r\nis considered good for every complaint. The stem is about a foot high,\r\nhairy and leafy, and bears at its extremity a large compact head of\r\ncrimson flowers. We passed a miserably cold night being obliged several\r\ntimes to get out of our hammocks, in order to warm ourselves at the fire.\r\nHad we proceeded half a mile further, we should have reached a good\r\nsized fazenda, but I was not aware we were so near it, until we heard a\r\ncock crow in the morning. We halted during the middle of the following\r\nday, at a fazenda called San Francisco, about two leagues distant from\r\nwhere we slept. From the time we left Arrayas, the horses had gradually\r\nfallen off in strength, owing to the want of proper provender, as they\r\nhad depended almost entirely on the coarse rank innutritious grasses of\r\nthe mountain pastures. They had also been accustomed to a warmer climate\r\nthan that we now experienced on the table-land of the Serra, where we\r\nwere exposed to a chilly S.E. wind, which at night was particularly\r\npiercing. The heat during the day, especially when unclouded, was very\r\ngreat, and this rendered us much more susceptible to the cold at night.\r\nAt Riachão I was obliged to exchange two of my horses that could proceed\r\nno farther, and finding here that my own horse, which I had constantly\r\nridden since I left Icó, in the province of Ceará, was with difficulty\r\nkept from lagging behind the others, it became necessary, much against\r\nmy inclination, to part with him and procure another. On leaving him\r\nbehind me I felt as if parting from an old friend, as we had become so\r\nmuch accustomed to each other; my chestnut horse was now replaced by\r\nanother of a pure white, with a flowing mane and tail; but it did not\r\nremain long in my possession, for it was stolen from me soon after we\r\ncrossed the Rio de San Francisco. We left San Francisco in the afternoon,\r\nand passed on our way to the first house from the fazenda, which is\r\nsaid to be three leagues distant; but as the leagues in this district\r\nwere even much longer than those of the more populated parts of Goyaz,\r\nthe distance in reality was far greater. Towards dusk we encamped under\r\nsome small Tingi trees (_Magonia glabrata_, St. Hil.), from the stems\r\nof which we suspended our hammocks. Some of the large undulating grassy\r\ncampos through which we passed, between the fazenda and the place of our\r\nencampment, had been burned a few weeks before. These were now covered\r\nwith numerous herbaceous plants in full flower; and I observed that in\r\nthose parts that remained untouched by the fire, the same plants were in\r\na more backward state, none being yet in blossom; but over the burned\r\ntracts, the new grass was springing up vigorously, promising soon to\r\nyield an excellent pasture for the cattle.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, after having proceeded about half a league, we\r\nreached the Rio Carynhenha, which forms the boundary line between the\r\nprovince of Pernambuco, through the south-west corner of which we had for\r\na few days been passing, and that of Minas Geräes, so that on crossing\r\nit we at length entered the latter province. After travelling a further\r\ndistance of two leagues, we halted to breakfast under a wide-spreading\r\nPiki tree, on the margin of a Buriti swamp. The first part of our day’s\r\njourney was through an open campo country, the greater part of which\r\nhad been lately burned; but the latter half was through a hilly and\r\nthinly-wooded tract. The day being cloudy, and the wind blowing freshly\r\nfrom the S.E., made us all complain much of the cold. In the afternoon it\r\nwas my intention to reach the next house, said to be three leagues from\r\nthat we had passed in the morning, but after travelling till dark without\r\nseeing it, we encamped for the night near some bushes on the banks of a\r\nsmall river; and as there were no trees here from which to suspend our\r\nhammocks, we contented ourselves with sleeping on hides spread on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nIn passing through a wooded campo (Taboleira coberta) we came upon a\r\nlarge ant-eater (_Myrmecophaga jubata_), which Mr. Walker followed with\r\nthe intention of shooting, but his gun missed fire: we all pursued it on\r\nfoot with sticks, as none of our guns happened to be loaded. I was the\r\nfirst to come up with it, and being well aware of the harmless nature of\r\nits mouth, I seized it by its long snout, by which I tried to hold it,\r\nwhen it immediately rose upon its hind legs, and clasping me round the\r\nmiddle with its powerful fore paws, completely brought me to a stand;\r\none of the men now coming up, struck it a blow on the head with a thick\r\nstick, which brought it for an instant to the ground. Notwithstanding\r\nit was frequently stunned by the blows it received, it always raised\r\nitself again and ran off. At last, I recollected the small pistols which\r\nI always carried in my jacket pocket, loaded with ball, when by the\r\nfirst shot through the breast it fell dead. It was a very large animal,\r\nmeasuring about six feet without including the tail, which together with\r\nthe long hair by which it is covered, measured full four feet more. It\r\nran very slowly, owing to the peculiar organization of its fore feet,\r\ntwo of the claws of which are very large and doubled up when it walks or\r\nruns, causing one side of the foot to rest on the ground. The proper, or\r\nrather principal use of these powerful claws, is to assist in obtaining\r\nthe white-ant, the food on which he lives. The large clay nests of these\r\ninsects are very common in those upland campos; and when the ant-bear\r\nwants a meal, he attacks one of these hillocks with his fore claws, tears\r\nout a portion of the side, and pushes in his long slender tongue, which\r\nis covered with a viscid saliva, to which myriads of the ants adhere, and\r\nopening his little mouth he draws it in; now shutting his lips, pushes it\r\nout a second time, retaining the ants in his mouth till the tongue has\r\nbeen completely exserted, when he swallows them. We afterwards met with\r\nnumbers of these strange-looking animals.\r\n\r\nThe small river near which we slept, was full of rounded blocks of\r\nlimestone, which being very slippery, rendered our passage across it\r\ndifficult, but fortunately all the luggage was got over in safety. We\r\nnow travelled for a league through a bare, arid, hilly country, in\r\nwhich almost the only tree that exists, is a small gregarious species\r\nof _Vochysia_, and arrived at the house we expected to reach the night\r\nbefore, where I remained all day in order to preserve the skin of the\r\nant-eater, and to arrange some of my other collections. This place is\r\ncalled Capão da Casca, and consists of but one small miserable hut,\r\nentirely formed of leaves of the Buriti palm. It was inhabited by a\r\nmulatto, his wife, and three children; there were but two very small\r\napartments, so that we were obliged to sleep on our hide beds spread out\r\non the ground before the house, where our men had kindled a large fire.\r\nThe house is situated in the mouth of a small wooded valley, and the only\r\ncultivated ground I saw was a plantation of mandiocca. The miserable\r\npoverty of the family seemed to be entirely owing to the laziness of the\r\nman, who was a perfect picture of indolence.\r\n\r\nWe left early on the following morning, with the intention of making a\r\nlong journey, as the next house was said to be six long leagues distant,\r\nwhich I set down as equivalent to ten legal ones. Shortly after leaving\r\nthe house we had to cross a small stream, the bed of which was very\r\nboggy, so that one of the horses stuck fast, and in trying to extricate\r\nhimself fell, together with his load, into the stream. It was some time\r\nbefore the boxes could be taken off, by which time they became quite full\r\nof water,—fortunately it was not a load of botanical specimens; but one\r\nof the boxes contained the last remains of my stock of paper for packing\r\ndried plants, as well as a little box full of the skins of bats and other\r\nsmall quadrupeds, together with some insects, all of which were more or\r\nless destroyed. As this was the first horse that attempted to pass, I\r\nwould not allow any of the others to venture across with their loads,\r\nall were unpacked and passed over by the men in safety. By the time\r\neverything was again put into travelling order, and we had gone on about\r\nhalf a league, it was mid-day, when we halted under a large tree in the\r\nhollow near a wooded marsh. Our first care was to dry all the articles\r\nthat had been wetted in the morning, which operation was much favoured by\r\nthe sun that shone brilliantly.\r\n\r\nSome of the campos we passed through were covered with a large species of\r\ntree-lily, bearing a profusion of beautiful purple flowers. Early in the\r\nafternoon we continued our journey, and halted for the night in a wooded\r\ncampo, a little above a large Buriti swamp, sleeping on a hard bed, there\r\nbeing no place wherein to sling our hammocks, and suffering much from the\r\ncold. Although accustomed daily both to privations and fatigue, there was\r\nan indescribable pleasure in the wild life we had long been leading; it\r\nis true we were deprived of nearly all the comforts of civilized life,\r\nbut we were at the same time free from all its restraints. When we rose\r\nin the morning we knew not where our next sleeping place might be, but\r\nthe choice was almost always at our command, which however was not made\r\nat random, but constantly regulated by some indispensable requisites,\r\nsuch as water and grass for the horses, trees from which to suspend our\r\nhammocks, and wood wherewith to make our nightly fire. We had hitherto\r\nmet with but little difficulty in finding, all these together; but the\r\npart of the Serra Geral on which we were now travelling called the Serra\r\ndas Araras, was in most places so destitute of arboreous vegetation, that\r\ntrees were seldom met with in combination with other requisites for an\r\nencampment.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at a place where we wished to remain, each person had his own\r\ndepartment to attend to. The first thing was to unload the horses, at\r\nwhich all assisted. Mr. Walker and I always saddled and unsaddled our own\r\nanimals: two of the men then took them to the spot that offered the best\r\npasture, where they were left after fastening their fore legs together\r\nwith leathern straps to prevent them from straying during the night;\r\nthese men on their return brought with them as much dry wood as they\r\ncould carry. Another man was despatched with a large leather bag to fetch\r\nwater; while Mr. Walker and I arranged the packages together in such a\r\nmanner that they could readily be covered over with skins in the event\r\nof rain; two large trunks put together served as our table, while two\r\nsmaller ones supplied us with seats. Generally before the men returned,\r\nMr. Walker had kindled a fire, and while supper was preparing, which was\r\nalso our dinner, for we took only two meals a day, I occupied myself in\r\npreparing and changing the specimens collected on the previous days. By\r\nthe time the water was boiled for our tea, the piece of dried beef which\r\nhad been put on a wooden spit, and suspended over the hot embers, was\r\nready for our supper, as it required to be little more than heated. The\r\ntea, dried beef, and farinha de mandiocca constituted our usual fare; and\r\nI am certain that if any of our European friends, who had never seen this\r\nkind of provision, could have been suddenly transported to one of our\r\nmeals, he would have concluded, from the appearance of our food, that\r\nwe were eating saw-dust and roasted leather. Our greatest comfort was a\r\nlarge stock of excellent tea, which I laid in before leaving Pernambuco,\r\nand which fortunately lasted till we reached a more civilized place,\r\nwhere more was procured; this was my only beverage during the whole of\r\nthis long and protracted journey, and nothing could be more refreshing at\r\nthe end of a day’s ride under a burning sun.\r\n\r\nI was told when I arrived in Brazil, that I should find it necessary\r\nto mix either wine or brandy with the water I drank, but a very short\r\nexperience taught me, not only that they were unnecessary, but decidedly\r\nhurtful to those whose occupations lead them much into the sun. Whoever\r\ndrinks stimulating liquors, and travels day after day in the sun, will\r\ncertainly suffer from headache, and in countries where miasmata prevail,\r\nwill be far more liable to be attacked by the diseases which are there\r\nendemic. The dried beef of an ox generally lasted us from three weeks\r\nto a month, by the end of which time it was scarcely fit to be eaten,\r\nbecoming as hard as a chip of wood. In moist rainy weather it was very\r\ndifficult to preserve it, for with the utmost care we could not prevent\r\nthe breeding of maggots, from which it required to be freed both before\r\nand after it was roasted. We were seldom, however, more than a fortnight\r\nwithout provisions of some kind or other, either in the shape of deer,\r\nmonkeys, armadillos, large lizards, or birds of various kinds.\r\n\r\nWe started early from the Buriti swamp where we slept, with the\r\nexpectation of reaching the fazenda do Rio Claro about mid-day, but a\r\nlittle before that time we found, by the direction in which we were\r\ngoing, that we had taken a wrong road. A little after mid-day we came to\r\nthe S.E. termination of that part of the Serra das Araras on which we had\r\nbeen travelling, whence we had an uninterrupted view of the vast plain\r\nthat stretches to the south and east, studded here and there with a few\r\nsmall lakes. After descending the Serra by an easy path, we rested during\r\nthe middle of the day beneath some trees, by the side of a little stream\r\nof cool water that came rushing down from the Serra, not knowing where\r\nwe were, nor when we might meet with any one to give us information. We\r\nsoon found the track again, and travelling through a flat thinly-wooded\r\ncountry, on an indifferent path, for about half an hour, we arrived at a\r\nsmall house, which we found empty; and a little further on we came upon\r\nanother in the same state. Following the same path for about an hour, we\r\nmet a black man and a boy, from whom we learned that we should arrive at\r\na fazenda about half a league further on; we likewise ascertained at the\r\nsame time that the road we had chosen was a round of about three leagues\r\nand a half to the fazenda do Rio Claro, but that it was much better than\r\nthe one usually travelled; this at least was some consolation for the\r\nerror we had committed. It was nearly sunset when we reached a small\r\nfazenda, called San José, where we put up for the night; the house was\r\nnot only small, but in a wretchedly ruinous condition, and belonged to a\r\nmulatto, who did not seem to be very industrious. The Rio Urucuya, which\r\nruns directly east from the Serra Geral, and empties itself into the Rio\r\nde San Francisco a little below San Romão, passes close to the house, and\r\nis even there of considerable width and depth. On this day’s journey I\r\ncollected no new plants, being the only instance of failing to do so in\r\nmy travels since I left the coast.\r\n\r\nNext morning, after receiving proper directions for the fazenda do Rio\r\nClaro, we left San José, and not long after we started came to a large\r\nrivulet which was so deep and muddy that it became necessary for all the\r\nluggage to be carried over by the men, and owing to the difficulties of\r\nthe fording this occupied about two hours. As the stream is narrow, and\r\nthe banks high on each side, it would not be difficult, in the course\r\nof a day, to form a good wooden bridge over it at a trifling expense,\r\nfor plenty of wood exists close by; but this is scarcely to be expected\r\nfrom those who will not give themselves the trouble of erecting a decent\r\nhouse to live in, notwithstanding they are surrounded by an abundance of\r\nmaterials. When all had been passed over, I found it was then too late\r\nto go on until we had breakfasted, we therefore remained here till the\r\nafternoon. While at breakfast, an elderly white woman and her son arrived\r\non the opposite side of the stream, and after having crossed it, they\r\nremained during the middle of the day in our encampment. We found this\r\nwoman, notwithstanding her age, to be lively and active, qualities not\r\ncommon among Brazilian women. I learned from her that she was going to\r\na place at a distance of five days’ journey, to fulfil a vow she had\r\nmade to San Antonio, some short time before, when she was suffering from\r\nillness. During our stay at this place, we were greatly tormented with\r\ncarrapatos. We started early, and shortly before sunset arrived at last\r\nat the fazenda do Rio Claro, having passed through a flat, thinly-wooded\r\ncountry, covered with several large coarse kinds of grass.\r\n\r\nThis fazenda takes its name from a little stream that flows past it, and\r\nfalls into the Urucuya, about a league further south. Although the house\r\nwas large and commodious, compared with the generality of others in those\r\nparts, the owner, Senhor Manoel Lucas, would not give us accommodation\r\nfor the night, but sent us to a small open shed in front of the hut of\r\none of his slaves, where we slung our hammocks, after having tied up some\r\nhides to keep out a cold wind that blew down from the Serra. The men\r\nslept in the open air, on the ground, by the side of a large fire. As I\r\nhad a great many plants to pack up, and as it was necessary to get two\r\nmore large hide trunks made to put them in, we remained four days at Rio\r\nClaro for this purpose. During our stay we found the proprietor to be no\r\nless exorbitant than Captain Faustino, of San João, in the extravagant\r\nprices he demanded for the dried hides and Indian corn that I bought of\r\nhim, and equally inhospitable in his demeanour.\r\n\r\nThe whole time we remained here, was spent in the shed before mentioned,\r\nwhere we were roasted by day, and starved with cold by night. We found\r\nit so extremely cold in our hammocks, for want of a proper supply of\r\nblankets, that we rose several times during the night in order to warm\r\nourselves by the fire around which the men slept.\r\n\r\nIt was on the afternoon of the 12th of June that we left the inhospitable\r\nbanks of the Rio Claro, and after a journey of two leagues, arrived at\r\nthe next fazenda, called Boquerão, from the owner of which we met with\r\na very different reception from that at the Rio Claro; we were not only\r\naccommodated in his own house, but shortly after our arrival, he prepared\r\nfor us an excellent supper of fresh beef, a luxury we had not enjoyed\r\nsince we left the fazenda of San João, near San Domingo. I now regretted\r\nvery much that I had not delayed my preparations until our arrival at\r\nthis place, as we should have found everything more comfortably provided.\r\nThe trees since we descended the Serra, I observed to be very different\r\nfrom those we had there met with, resembling much more those existing in\r\nthe Sertão country of Piauhy; they consisted of the Cambaiba (_Caratella\r\nçambaiba_, St. Hil.), the Folha larga (_Salvertia convallariodora_, St.\r\nHil.), two species of arboreous _Bignonia_, with yellow flowers, and\r\nthe Sicupíra (_Commilobium polygalæflorum_, Benth.); there were besides\r\na fine _Gerascanthus_, bearing large panicles of white flowers, a\r\nsilk-cotton-tree (_Bombax_), and a simple leaved _Rhopala_.\r\n\r\nOur host, whose name I regret I have neglected to record, would not allow\r\nus to depart on the following morning till we had breakfasted. As our\r\nstock of provisions was again becoming short, he sold me as much dried\r\nbeef as I thought would carry us to San Romão, which was not now many\r\ndays’ journey distant. We rested during the heat of the day at the next\r\nfazenda, after travelling two leagues and a half; in the afternoon we\r\nwent another two leagues, and remained for the night at the fazenda of\r\nSanta Maria. The country still continued flat and dry, partly open and\r\npartly wooded; some of the open places abounded, as far as the eye could\r\nreach, with the large yellow clay nests of the white ant, among which we\r\nsaw several ant-eaters, and a large flock of the ostrich of the country,\r\nwhich, as soon as they saw us, fled with extraordinary rapidity. From\r\nSanta Maria, we went on to a little hamlet called Espigão, half a league\r\ndistant; it consisted of a few small houses, at one of which we stopped\r\nto make enquiries about the road; it belonged to a tailor, who was at\r\nwork outside the door; as soon as we arrived, about half a dozen young\r\nwomen, of all colours, and dirty in the extreme, came out to reconnoitre\r\nus. Following the directions, we went on about a league further, and\r\nhalted to breakfast at an uninhabited house, by the side of a beautiful\r\nstream of clear water, flowing from a Buriti palm swamp. Resuming our\r\njourney in the afternoon, we crossed the stream, but were puzzled which\r\nroad to take of the two that presented themselves, one led to the south,\r\nand another to the east; and as our general direction was easterly, we\r\nfollowed that course. After travelling about two leagues and a half\r\nthrough a very arid and barren country, consisting of long flat sandy\r\ntracts, wooded with a few stunted trees and bushes, and large open Buriti\r\nswamps, we arrived at another uninhabited house. During the latter part\r\nof this journey, the road inclined so much towards the north, that I felt\r\ncertain we had not taken the right one, and determined to retrace our\r\nsteps on the following morning, and take that which led to the south. As\r\nthe house was in a very ruinous state, we slept under some trees; and as\r\nthe nights had now become too cold for the use of hammocks, we generally\r\nabandoned them, and adopted instead an ox-hide laid on the ground, by the\r\nside of a large fire, with a trunk placed at our heads, and two or three\r\nothers alongside; a heap of wood was always collected and laid within\r\nreach, and as the hardness of our beds never allowed us to sleep too\r\nsoundly, the fire was always well kept up; the men had another fire to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning we returned to the place where the two roads\r\nseparated, and breakfasted under the shade of a large Sicupíra tree.\r\nFortunately, just as we were about to start, the same old lady and her\r\nson whom we met at the fazenda do Rio Claro, now passed us, on her\r\nreturn from the fulfilment of her vow; from her we learned that we were\r\naltogether out of our proper course, and that to regain it, it was\r\nnecessary to return to Espigão, at which place there were also two roads,\r\nand that we had been directed to the wrong one; we had, therefore, no\r\nalternative but again to retrace our steps, having lost a day and a half\r\nby this erroneous information. On reaching Espigão, we took the other\r\nroad without making any further enquiries, and after travelling about a\r\nleague and a half, reached the banks of a small river, half an hour after\r\nsunset. We passed the night under some trees on the banks of the stream,\r\nwhich is called the Riberão de Area; it is only about twenty yards broad,\r\nand shallow enough to allow the horses to pass over with their loads, but\r\nas the bottom was very bad, from the great quantity of smooth rounded\r\nstones, I thought it safer to have all the luggage conveyed over next\r\nmorning in a fine large canoe, which we found made fast on the opposite\r\nside, by which means we escaped all risk of damage from the slipping of\r\nthe horses’ feet. The country around this place was very pretty, being\r\nflat on each side of the river to a considerable distance, well covered\r\nwith grass, and thinly wooded; immediately above the ford, there is a\r\nlong rapid, the rushing of the water over which is heard at a great\r\ndistance. The canoe being large, we were not long in passing the luggage,\r\nand afterwards we made a journey of about two leagues and a half, through\r\na slightly undulating, arid, and barren country, consisting chiefly of\r\nbare grassy hills, covered in many places with abundance of ferruginous\r\nstones, and flat, sandy, thinly-wooded Taboleiras. We rested by the side\r\nof a small stream which flowed from a Buriti swamp, and as there were\r\nno large trees, we sheltered ourselves from the burning sun among some\r\nbushes which grew on the margin of the rivulet. In the afternoon, another\r\njourney of two leagues and a half through a similar country, brought\r\nus to a little fazenda called Taboca, which belonged to a mulatto. On\r\nstarting next, morning, the owner accompanied us for nearly half a mile,\r\nin order to put us upon the right road, there being several other paths\r\nleading to different places.\r\n\r\nA journey of about ten leagues from this place, which occupied two days\r\nand a half, brought us to the banks of the Rio Urucuya, at a place called\r\nSan Miguel, little more than a league to the westward of its junction\r\nwith the Rio de Francisco, and here we had to cross it; the stream was\r\nabout a gunshot in breadth, and very deep. As there was no regular ferry\r\nestablished here, we hired a small canoe, by means of which all the\r\npackages were safely taken across in two hours. The horses were passed\r\nabout a quarter of a mile further up, at a place where they had only\r\nabout half the breadth of the river to swim. It was in the morning that\r\nwe arrived at this place, and although no corn could be obtained for the\r\nhorses, I determined to remain till the following day, in order to give\r\nthem a rest, all being in a very exhausted state, in consequence of their\r\nlong journey, and the want of nourishing provender. We were now only five\r\nleagues from the Villa de San Romão, and were the more anxious to reach\r\nit as soon as possible, as our stock of provisions had been exhausted the\r\nevening before we reached the ferry. The journey from Boquerão occupied\r\na longer time than we anticipated, and we were disappointed on finding,\r\nthat after leaving that place, we could obtain nothing by purchase at\r\na few small fazendas we passed. I have everywhere observed during my\r\ntravels in Brazil, and the same remark has been made by M. Auguste de\r\nSt. Hilaire, that the nearer a traveller comes to a town or village, the\r\nless chance he finds of being able to renew his stock of provisions. The\r\nmen had still a few french-beans and a small piece of fat bacon left, but\r\nnot more than would suffice them for a single meal; Mr. Walker and I had\r\nnow been two days and a half without tasting any solid food, sustaining\r\nourselves during that time entirely on strong tea, for we had not been\r\nable to meet with a single wild animal of any description; we had often\r\nbefore suffered severely from thirst, but had never been so long without\r\nfood; it was fortunate we had the tea, as it prevented us from suffering\r\nnearly as much from hunger, as I expected we should have done. We stopped\r\nat a house on the south side of the river, which was both miserable and\r\nsmall, belonging to an old black woman, the only resident there; she had\r\nnothing, not even a fowl to sell. We slept in a part of the house that\r\nwanted a roof, and had only a small portion of the walls entire; a large\r\nfire was kindled in the middle of the floor, by the side of which we\r\nspread out hides for our beds.\r\n\r\nAs there was some difficulty in finding one of the horses, it was late\r\nnext morning before we left the banks of the Urucuya. After travelling\r\nnearly a league, we halted for some time at a place where there are two\r\nsmall lakes, called As Dus Irmãas. We did not proceed further, having\r\nbeen informed, before we started, that we should not meet with a drop of\r\nwater for the next three leagues, and this in the afternoon we found to\r\nbe really the case, the road leading through one continued flat dry sandy\r\nplain, thinly covered with bushes and small trees. We reached the first\r\nwatering place a little before sunset; it is called Riacho, and is about\r\na league from San Romão; there is no house there, nor could I observe any\r\nappearance of habitation on the whole road from the Urucuya to the Villa.\r\nWe hoped to have reached the Villa that evening, but the horses were too\r\nmuch fatigued to go further; we therefore encamped for the night under\r\nsome trees by the side of a limpid rivulet; none of us had had a morsel\r\nto eat, but we had all a large basin of strong warm tea, which made up\r\nin some measure for the want of a more substantial supper. To this Mr.\r\nWalker and the men added a pipe of tobacco, as they were all inveterate\r\nsmokers.\r\n\r\nAt length, on Sunday morning the 21st of June, we entered the Villa de\r\nSan Romão, and having proceeded to the house of the Juiz de Paz, in order\r\nto show him my passport, he very kindly sent a person to look after a\r\nhouse for our reception. He was not long in finding one, and as soon as\r\nthe horses were unloaded, I dispatched a man in search of provisions,\r\nbut, strange to say, he could find nothing but farinha. A market had been\r\nheld early in the morning, of both fresh and dried beef, but all had\r\nbeen sold off before our arrival; a most fortunate occurrence, however,\r\nafforded us a better breakfast than we anticipated. Just as we were\r\npreparing some tea, which we intended to take with some farinha, a little\r\nboy came to enquire if I would buy a fish which he had just caught, and\r\nwhich was lying on the banks of the river. I went there immediately, and\r\nfor the value of a few pence, bought the fish, a fine species of salmon\r\nupwards of two feet long, which I need not say was soon cooked, and\r\nformed a most welcome meal for all of us.\r\n\r\nThe Villa Resonha de San Romão is situated on the south bank of the\r\nRio de San Francisco, in the district of Paracatú; it is small, not\r\ncontaining above one thousand inhabitants, and forms a square of several\r\nlong narrow irregular streets; the houses are all of one story, and\r\nwithout exception, built of wicker-work and clay, there being no stone\r\nin the neighbourhood; the principal streets run parallel with the river,\r\nand the three which are nearest to it, are almost every year inundated by\r\nthe overflowing of its waters during the season of the rains. The other\r\npart of the town being somewhat higher, is exempt from this annoyance;\r\nthe house we inhabited was one of those exposed to the floods, and\r\nalthough the floor was at least four feet above the level of the street,\r\nit required to be abandoned annually for some time; during the great\r\nflood of 1838, to which I was witness on my voyage up the Rio de San\r\nFrancisco, the water rose five feet above the level of the floor, and the\r\nwalls still retained evident marks of the fact. The population consists\r\nchiefly of people of colour, and I do not believe that a dozen white\r\nfamilies exist in the whole Villa. Most of the respectable inhabitants\r\nare shopkeepers, who supply the fazendeiros, and those who reside in the\r\nsurrounding country, with European and other goods. The place cannot\r\nbe said to have any trade of its own, the principal source of traffic\r\nbeing fish, caught in the river, which after being salted and dried,\r\nis sold to the inhabitants of the Sertoes, who are remarkably fond of\r\nthis food. The better class of the inhabitants are greatly addicted to\r\ngambling, resorting every day for that purpose to the house of an old\r\ncaptain, who is the owner of a spirit shop; having occasion to call\r\nseveral times on some of them, with letters of recommendation that I\r\nbrought from Goyaz, I seldom found them at home, being always directed\r\nto the above house, where they were sure to be found, in company with\r\none of the two priests belonging to the place, and this on Sundays, no\r\nless than on other days. This priest, Padre Francisco Fernandes Vianna,\r\nalthough a man of most benevolent disposition, was far from being a model\r\nof morality to his flock; to him, however, I was indebted for several\r\nacts of kindness, as also to Lieut. Col. Thomas de Conceição, a person\r\nof considerable intelligence, who forms an exception to the general\r\ncharacter I have given of the inhabitants. From this gentleman I received\r\nletters of recommendation to the excellent and learned Padre Antonio\r\nNogueira Duarte, of Contendas, a small village between the Rio de San\r\nFrancisco and the Diamond District, a person who is spoken of in the\r\nhighest terms, both by St. Hilaire and by Spix and Martius. I expected to\r\npass through this village, and to have the pleasure of meeting with one,\r\nwho though now a very old man, still takes a delight in the pursuits of\r\nnatural history, but when I found that in order to visit him, I should\r\nbe obliged to make a round of several leagues, I renounced all idea of\r\ndoing so, both on account of the fatigued condition of my horses, and of\r\nthe great desire I now had to reach a place where my funds, which were in\r\na very reduced state, could be renovated. The first evening, as I walked\r\nthrough the town, I was surprised to hear one or more fiddles playing in\r\nalmost every house; this is the instrument almost exclusively used by the\r\nbarbers in Rio de Janeiro, and the other large cities and towns along the\r\ncoast, but in the interior it is very seldom met with, the guitar being\r\na greater favourite, and generally used both by ladies and gentlemen. In\r\nSan Romão, however, this usual fashion is departed from, no young lady’s\r\neducation being considered complete unless she has learned to handle the\r\nbow.\r\n\r\nIt being now the dry season, the river was many feet below its banks, and\r\nalthough of great breadth, appeared narrow when compared with what it was\r\nwhen I first beheld it, in 1838. It abounds in fish, which at this season\r\nare brought in canoes in great plenty, and sold in the Villa at a very\r\ncheap rate. During my residence there, I prepared specimens of most of\r\nthe ordinary kinds, which are now in the British Museum. The following\r\nare the names of a few of those which are most esteemed.\r\n\r\n    1. _Surubím._[13]—This fish, which is a species of sturgeon,\r\n    often reaches the length of six feet. It is taken most commonly\r\n    in nets, but sometimes also, especially by the Indians,\r\n    by being shot at with an arrow, to which a strong cord is\r\n    attached. The flesh of this species dried is that principally\r\n    sold in the Sertão; I have frequently tasted it, and found it\r\n    excellent.\r\n\r\n    2. _Curumatám._—This, as well as the three following, belongs\r\n    to the _Salmonidæ_; it is about two feet in length, and both\r\n    in colour and taste its flesh has a very near approach to\r\n    our common salmon. It inhabits the bottom of the river, and\r\n    is generally taken with a drag-net, but never with the hook.\r\n    During my stay in San Romão, several canoes came in every\r\n    morning, nearly full of them, and sold at about a halfpenny\r\n    each fish. The stomach is very thick and muscular, but in all\r\n    those I examined, I never found anything but a large quantity\r\n    of fine earth, in hard lumps.\r\n\r\n    3. _Dourádo._—A beautiful fish, from two to four feet in\r\n    length; it is generally taken with the hook, but is not\r\n    considered delicate food. We, nevertheless, relished the first\r\n    we ate very much, it being this species I bought of the boy on\r\n    the day we arrived at San Romão.\r\n\r\n    4. _Matrixám._—Somewhat similar to the _Dourádo_, but smaller,\r\n    and considered a much superior fish.\r\n\r\n    5. _Piau branco._—From one to two feet long, and with much\r\n    larger scales than any of the others; it is taken with the\r\n    hook, and its flesh is much esteemed.\r\n\r\n    6. _Curvínha._—About two feet in length, with a scaly head; it\r\n    takes the bait readily, but the flesh, which is soft, is not\r\n    considered good.\r\n\r\n    7. _Traíra._—Also about two feet long and rather slender; it\r\n    takes the bait, and is much esteemed.\r\n\r\n    8. _Pirá._—About two and a half feet long, with a protruded\r\n    beak; is only taken with the drag-net, and is considered a\r\n    delicate fish.\r\n\r\n    9. _Mandí._—One of the _Siluridæ_, and perhaps a species of\r\n    _Mystus_; from a foot and a half to two feet long, with no\r\n    apparent scales, and long barbecels proceeding backwards from\r\n    its mouth. It keeps near the bottom of the river, is taken by\r\n    the hook, and considered one of the best fish it produces.\r\n\r\n    10. _Pocomó._—This and the following also belong to\r\n    the _Siluridæ_, and are, perhaps, species of the genus\r\n    _Hypostomus_. The _Pocomó_ is an ugly black fish, about two\r\n    feet long, covered with large hard plates. It keeps near the\r\n    bottom, and is taken in great plenty in the nets which are\r\n    thrown for other fish. During my visit, the sandy shores of the\r\n    river were covered with those which had been thrown out of the\r\n    nets. It is seldom eaten, but makes good bait for other fish.\r\n\r\n    11. _Cascuda._—This species is smaller than the last, and very\r\n    much resembles it, except that it is of a yellow colour.\r\n\r\nThe _Piráuh_ and _Piába_, of both of which I have already spoken,\r\nare as abundant here as they are below the Falls of Paulo Affonso;\r\nbesides these, there must be many others which I had not an opportunity\r\nof seeing. During the whole time we remained in San Romão, we lived\r\nprincipally on fish; indeed, it is so abundant and so cheap, that fresh\r\nbeef is rarely offered in the market. The navigation of the river being\r\nuninterrupted from this place to the Falls of Paulo Affonso, many canoes\r\nare continually passing up and down; their principal cargo up is salt,\r\nfrom the manufactories which exist on the vast saline flats on both sides\r\nof the river below Porto do Salgado; this is partly sold for money, and\r\npartly exchanged for hides, tobacco, &c.\r\n\r\nAs it was essentially requisite to arrange and pack the large collections\r\nmade during our journey from Arrayas, and as our long journey now\r\nbegan to manifest its effects on the men, as well as on the animals, I\r\ndetermined to give them a sufficient rest, by remaining a fortnight at\r\nSan Romão; accordingly the horses were sent to pasture on a large island\r\nin the river, immediately opposite the town; this island is about half\r\na league long, and a quarter of a mile broad; the pasture there was not\r\nvery good, but the horses remained much safer than in any other place.\r\nHorse stealing is so very common in this quarter, that scarcely a troop\r\narrives, from any distance, that does not lose one or more animals;\r\nbefore our arrival, we became aware of this fact, and were advised to\r\nput our troop on the island for safety. As the country was greatly dried\r\nup around the town, by the effects of the long drought, I did not here\r\nadd much to my collections; and, indeed, a slight accident that occurred\r\nto me, prevented my walking about so much as I should otherwise have\r\ndone. A few days after we arrived, I went to pay a visit to a gentleman,\r\nwhen in going up a few steps at the door, my foot slipped, and my leg\r\ncame with considerable violence against the sharp edge of one of the\r\nbrick steps; the wound, although small, troubled me greatly, for owing to\r\nthe fatigue I had previously undergone, and the innutritious nature of\r\nour food, my body had evidently fallen into a somewhat scorbutic state.\r\nI did not finally recover from the effects of this accident till nearly\r\ntwo months afterwards, when I rested several weeks in the house of a kind\r\nfriend in the Gold District.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nSAN ROMÃO TO THE DIAMOND DISTRICT.\r\n\r\n    Leaves San Romão—Passes Guaribas—Passagem—Geräes\r\n    Velhas—Espigão—Caisára—Cabeceira—Arrives at the Villa\r\n    de Formigas—Town described—Account of the impostor\r\n    Douville—Country around rich in botanical products—Passes\r\n    Viados—Arrives at the Arraial de Bomfim—Reaches San\r\n    Elo—Sitio—Comes to a Gold Working called Lavrinha—Crosses\r\n    the River Inhacica—Reaches As Vargems—Registo do Rio\r\n    Inhahy—Bassoras on the river Jiquitinhonha—Examines a Diamond\r\n    Mine—Formation in which the Diamond is found—Mode of Working\r\n    it—Arrives at the Arraial de Mendanha—Town described—Ascends\r\n    the Serra de Mendanha—Reaches Duas Pontes—Arrives at the\r\n    Cidade Diamantina, formerly the Arraial de Tijuco, the\r\n    Capital of the Diamond District—Town situated on side of\r\n    Hill—Description of its Population—Their mode of Dress—Its\r\n    cold Temperature—Productions of its Neighbourhood—Mining for\r\n    Diamonds, formerly a privileged Monopoly, now is open to\r\n    all.—Character of Miners—Extent of Diamond Mines—Privilege\r\n    of Slaves there employed—Climate very Healthy—Women very\r\n    Handsome—Complaints incident to its Climate—Loyalty shown by\r\n    its Inhabitants—Fatality among Horses.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe province of Minas Geräes is not only one of the largest in Brazil,\r\nbut one of the richest, its natural resources being very considerable. It\r\nextends between the 14th and 23rd degrees of south latitude, and between\r\nthe 41st and 53rd degrees of west longitude, the four more westerly\r\ndegrees, however, include but a very narrow corner; on the east, it is\r\nbounded by the maritime province of Espirito Santo; on the north, by\r\nthose of Bahia and Pernambuco; on the south, by those of Rio de Janeiro\r\nand San Paulo; and on the west, by that of Goyaz. It is naturally divided\r\ninto two very unequal portions by a mountain chain, that runs from\r\nsouth to north, in which exist the Gold and Diamond mines, for which the\r\nprovince is so celebrated. The country to the east is mostly covered\r\nwith virgin forests, while that to the west, which is flatter, chiefly\r\nconsists of pasture lands, much of which, however, is covered with\r\nCatinga forests, forming one of the largest tracts in Brazil, to which\r\nthe name of Sertão is given. In order to reach the Cidade Diamantina, the\r\ncapital of the Diamond district, which it was now my intention to visit,\r\nit was necessary to make a long journey through this desert-like country;\r\nthe road most frequented, is that which runs southward along the east\r\nbank of the Rio de San Francisco, and the north of the Rio das Velhas, a\r\nlarge tributary of the former, which takes its rise in the Gold country;\r\nthe other, which is a far worse road, leads through the Sertão in a\r\nsouth-east direction; but I preferred it, because it would sooner bring\r\nme into the mountainous regions of the Diamond district.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of July, preparatory to our departure, my horses were brought\r\nover from the island to the east side of the San Francisco, and early\r\non the following morning the luggage was all at once passed over, in a\r\nlarge ajojo, two canoes lashed together. All being now prepared, I had\r\nresolved to proceed immediately, but on collecting the animals, my own\r\nsaddle horse was not to be found; all that day was spent in search of\r\nit, but the only trace left, was the leathern strap, by which its fore\r\nlegs had been secured, and which was found in the wood unbuttoned at both\r\nends, and as this could only have been done by some person, we came to\r\nthe conclusion that the horse was stolen; I, therefore, resolved to lose\r\nno more time in looking after it. About midnight we were awakened by a\r\nblack man, who had assisted my men in the morning’s search, who came to\r\ninform me that a horse similar to mine, had been seen during the day,\r\ntied to a tree in the wood considerably further up the river. Early next\r\nmorning, I despatched one of my people in that direction to look for\r\nit, who returned in about an hour, bringing the horse with him; it was\r\nevident it had been taken there, in the hope of its remaining concealed,\r\nuntil an opportunity occurred of carrying it away altogether. I now lost\r\nno time in commencing the journey, and making a short stage of about\r\na league, rested, during the middle of the day, at a fazenda called\r\nGuaribas. The first half league was through a flat thinly-wooded tract,\r\nwhich is generally overflowed by the river, during the rainy season; I\r\nsaw some fine large trees in this wood, of a species of _Triplaris_,\r\nand an arboreous _Bignonia_, destitute of leaves, but covered with\r\nflowers not unlike those of the Foxglove, in shape, size, and colour.\r\nThe underwood here consisted chiefly of different kinds of _Mimosa_,\r\n_Acacia_, _Bauhinia_, _Cæsalpinia_, &c., and an immense number of Lemon\r\ntrees, loaded with fruit; this tree has here become quite naturalized,\r\nand the cattle that pasture in the woods are so fond of the fallen fruit,\r\nthat when killed, their flesh smells strongly of it. The other half\r\nleague led through a thickly-wooded Taboleira. At Guaribas, I occupied\r\nmyself with skinning a very large howling monkey, which Mr. Walker shot\r\nthe evening before, on a tree on the banks of the Rio de San Francisco;\r\nand in the afternoon we advanced another two leagues, and arrived at a\r\nfazenda, called Passagem. The road was dreadfully bad, in consequence of\r\nthe underwood which choaked the almost untrodden path; on this journey,\r\nevery little twig and blade of grass was loaded with carrapatos, in\r\nballs, often the size of filberts, and we became completely covered with\r\nthese annoying insects; the banks of the little stream near the house,\r\nin particular, were swarming with them. In the afternoon, we passed two\r\nsmall lakes which were full of wild ducks, but we were too much annoyed\r\nby the badness of the road to lose time in shooting any of them, although\r\nthey appeared to be very tame; they are smaller than those which frequent\r\nthe lakes of the north of Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe fazenda of Passagem, at which we stopped, belongs to a person who\r\nresides in San Romão, whose acquaintance I made during my stay there;\r\nthe vaqueiro in charge of it, had orders not only to entertain us for\r\nthe night, but to guide us to the next fazenda, which is three leagues\r\ndistant. It was my design to leave early on the following morning, but\r\nmy mortification was extreme on finding that my riding horse again was\r\nnot forthcoming with the others. As the country around the house was\r\ncovered with a thick Catinga forest, abounding in many places with a\r\nsmall kind of Bamboo, of the leaves of which the horses are remarkably\r\nfond, we concluded he would be found grazing somewhere near at hand,\r\nbut all the forenoon was in vain spent in search of him; the vaqueiro,\r\nwho was a most obliging man, and well acquainted with the country, then\r\nmounted his horse, in quest of the lost animal, but he returned in the\r\nevening, without having been able to find the slightest trace of him.\r\nAll the following day was again spent in a useless search, and, as the\r\npasturage at this place was very bad, we went on in the evening, for\r\nthe sake of other animals, to Geräes Velhas, the fazenda to which the\r\nvaqueiro had orders to conduct us. He remained here with us all night,\r\nand next morning, I sent one of my men back with him, to have a last\r\nsearch for the missing horse, being unwilling to proceed without him,\r\nas he was one of the best belonging to my troop; but on the following\r\nday, the man returned without having obtained the slightest intelligence\r\nof the lost animal. I entertained no doubt that the thief who had been\r\ndisappointed on the former occasion, had now followed us, and at last\r\nmade sure of his booty. The country between Passagem and Geräes Velhas\r\nconsists principally of a flat Taboleira, which for the most part is\r\ncovered with a tall grass, a species of _Andropogon_, from six to twelve\r\nfeet high. For the next four days after leaving Geräes Velhas, our route\r\nwas through a very thinly inhabited country, consisting sometimes of low\r\nCatinga forests, at others, of Taboleiras cobertas, and not unfrequently\r\nof woodless grassy hills, on which that species of _Callopisma_, called\r\nBoca do Sapo, and the beautiful _Chresta pycnocephala_, grew profusely,\r\nboth of which were then in full flower. In passing through bushy grassy\r\ntracts in the Sertão, the ears of the traveller are greeted, from\r\nearly dawn till night, by the loud cries of a large gallinaceous bird,\r\ncalled by the inhabitants, Seriema; they generally go in pairs, and by\r\nkeeping among the long grass, they are seldom seen; like the Ostrich of\r\nthe country (Emu), they run with great quickness. St. Hilaire compares\r\ntheir cry to that of the turkey, but I find in my Journal, that I have\r\nfrequently remarked it to be like the yelping of a whelp. They build\r\ntheir nest in the low trees, and lay two eggs; as their flesh is not much\r\nesteemed, they are seldom sought after by the sportsman; and on this\r\naccount are frequently heard uttering their peculiar cry in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of houses: it is the _Dicolophus cristatus_ of Illiger.\r\n\r\nIn passing through a little hamlet, called Espigão, which consists of\r\nabout a dozen scattered houses, belonging to people of colour, I met with\r\na horse dealer, with whom I exchanged two of my horses, that were a good\r\ndeal exhausted, for two better ones, giving him a sum of money to boot;\r\nbut as he saw I was almost driven by necessity to make this exchange, he,\r\nof course, contrived to have the best of the bargain, in which respect\r\nthe Brazilian horse-dealers very much resemble those of more civilized\r\ncountries. On leaving Espigão, we travelled all the afternoon, and the\r\nwhole of the next day, before we came to any habitation; it was dusk\r\nwhen we arrived in sight of it, and it was not without some difficulty,\r\nowing to the badness of the road, and our not knowing which path to\r\ntake, that we at length reached this fazenda, called Caisára. I was much\r\ndisappointed to find this portion of the province so thinly populated,\r\nand exhibiting but few indications of native industry; although many\r\ntracts appeared equally well adapted for the rearing of cattle, as the\r\ngreater portion of Goyaz, we saw scarcely any animals distributed over\r\nits surface. There seemed abundance of excellent pasturage and good\r\nshelter for cattle, and notwithstanding that the upper parts of the hills\r\nwere sometimes bare, the valleys appeared to be well wooded. When I asked\r\nfor quarters for the night, at this place, I was told by the owner, an\r\nold mulatto, that if we chose, we might sleep under some orange trees,\r\nto which he pointed, at a little distance from the house. Thither we\r\naccordingly went, but just as we were getting the horses unloaded, he\r\ncame down to inform us, that although he gave us liberty to sleep there,\r\nhe would not on any account allow us to make a fire. The nights in this\r\npart of the country being too cold to admit of sleeping in the open air\r\nwithout artificial warmth, I determined to keep aloof from a man who was\r\nso uncivil and inhospitable, and therefore moved away from his orange\r\ntrees, carrying off all our equipage to the high road, which passed by\r\nthe house, where we kindled a large fire, by the side of which we slept,\r\nbut most uncomfortably, as the ground was covered with carrapatos. Next\r\nmorning before we started, the owner of the fazenda came out to visit us,\r\nand no doubt being ashamed of his conduct, he begged I would not mention\r\nto any one the manner in which we had been received, which was entirely\r\nowing to the smallness of his accommodation; but this was evidently a\r\nmere excuse, as his house was by no means small. The true reason for\r\nmaking this apology, was his having ascertained, from one of my men, the\r\nnature of my profession, for he brought with him one of his daughters, to\r\nsolicit my advice respecting a complaint under which she had laboured for\r\nsome time. I was also asked by him to visit one of his slaves, who for\r\nmany years had been prevented from working, by a complaint not uncommon\r\nin Brazil, Sarcocele; this, however, was the most remarkable case I had\r\never witnessed, exhibiting an enormous mass of solid flesh in a pyriform\r\nshape, that reached the ground, weighing nearly as much as the rest of\r\nhis body. The wretched being who was thus affected was a man still in the\r\nprime of life, and suffered but little, except from the inconvenience it\r\ncaused him.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the following day, we arrived at another fazenda\r\ncalled Cabeceira, the distance between the two places being about four\r\nleagues and a half. On this journey, the country still continued to rise,\r\nand about half a league before reaching this place, we passed over a\r\nbare Serra of considerable height, the ascent of which was rather steep,\r\nalthough the road over it is excellent, being so constructed that carts\r\ncan cross it without difficulty. That portion of the mountain in which\r\nthe road has been made is a soft brownish-coloured clay slate, but at no\r\nlittle distance on each side, the more lofty summits of the Serra consist\r\nof black compact limestone. The bushy campos through which we passed in\r\nthe forenoon, were beautifully adorned with a fine plant, belonging to\r\nthe natural order _Compositæ_, which grew in the greatest abundance, and\r\nreached to the height of about five feet, the _Chresta sphærocephala_\r\nof De Candolle; it has large leaves, which, together with the stem and\r\nbranches, are covered with a white woolly substance, and is much branched\r\nat the top, each branchlet being terminated by a large globose compact\r\nhead of purple flowers. As there was a good watering place in a wood a\r\nlittle beyond Cabeceira, we preferred going there, rather than remaining\r\nat the house, to which we were invited by the owner. During the whole\r\ninterval since we had left the province of Goyaz, we never suffered for\r\nwant of water as we had done in the dry provinces of the north. In every\r\npart of the country through which we were now travelling, we found in\r\nnearly every valley a little stream of clear, cool, and delicious water,\r\nand during our future progress it became even more abundant. We were\r\nnow only two leagues and a half distant from the Villa de Formigas, but\r\nowing to the badness of the roads, we did not reach it till nearly one in\r\nthe afternoon, notwithstanding we left our encampment at an early hour.\r\nThe country was rather hilly, and the road stony, but it presented one\r\ngreat advantage to the traveller, which I knew well how to appreciate, in\r\nthe bridges which are to be found crossing all the little streams that\r\nintersect the roads. They are constructed of wood, and however rude, they\r\nsave the traveller much trouble, and prevent the risk of damage to the\r\nluggage, as we too often experienced on our journey between Arrayas and\r\nSan Romão. Immediately on entering the Villa we passed over an excellent\r\nbridge of considerable span, one of the best I had yet seen in the\r\ninterior; it crossed a small river which passes through a portion of the\r\ntown. Having letters of recommendation to the Vigario of the district,\r\nPadre Antonio Gonsalves Chaves, I proceeded at once to his house, where\r\nwe met with a most hospitable reception; an excellent breakfast was\r\nimmediately prepared, and good quarters provided us, in an empty house\r\nbelonging to him, adjoining the one which he inhabited.\r\n\r\nThe Villa of Montes Claros de Formigas, is of small dimensions,\r\ncontaining a population of about 1,000 souls, but in respect to its\r\nsituation, the arrangement of its streets, and the neat and clean\r\nappearance of the houses, it far exceeded any Villa I had seen in the\r\ninterior. It is distant from Rio de Janeiro and Bahia upwards of two\r\nhundred leagues, and about fifty from the Cidade Diamantina; until the\r\nyear 1832, it ranked only as an Arraial, but in that year it was elevated\r\nto the dignity of a Villa, and is now the chief town of the Comarca of\r\nthe same name. The site on which it is built has been well chosen, being\r\na slightly elevated plateau, in the centre of a large valley, which is\r\nsurrounded on all sides by an irregular ridge of hills of considerable\r\nelevation. The greater part of the houses are arranged in the form of a\r\nvery large square, much longer than broad, of which the south side is\r\nstill incomplete. At the north end of this square stands the only church\r\nthe Villa contains, near which is an excellent roofed market-place, for\r\nthe sale of provisions brought from the country; at the south-end of the\r\nspace fronting the church, is a large jail not yet finished. The small\r\nriver that passes it, called the Rio Vieira, falls into the Rio das\r\nVelhas, yielding the town a very good supply of fish, similar to those\r\nfound in the Rio de San Francisco. The Villa contains a few shops, where\r\nEuropean goods are sold; these goods were formerly brought from Bahia,\r\nbut Rio de Janeiro seems now to be the principal resort of the merchants,\r\nwho take with them in exchange to the coast its chief produce, saltpetre,\r\nwhich is found not only in the soil in certain parts of the surrounding\r\nSertão country, but in caverns in the limestone rocks, of which the low\r\nmountains in the vicinity are principally formed. The fazendeiros in the\r\ncountry around Formigas, occupy themselves principally in the rearing\r\nof cattle and horses, which are for the most part driven to the Bahia\r\nmarket. They also cultivate a little mandiocca and Indian corn, but no\r\nrice, the dry nature of the country not being suited to its growth.\r\n\r\nI remained only two days in Formigas, being now very anxious to reach\r\nthe gold country, where I expected to find letters from England awaiting\r\nmy arrival: I should otherwise have made a longer stay here, in order\r\nto recover from the effects of the bruise I received on my leg at San\r\nRomão, which, in consequence of my being obliged to ride every day on\r\nhorseback, had become so greatly inflamed and swollen as to cause me\r\nmuch pain and inconvenience, and totally to prevent all chance of making\r\nany excursions on foot in the neighbourhood of the Villa. During my stay\r\nI received many kind attentions from the Vigario, who readily afforded me\r\nthe use of his library, which, though small, contained a good selection\r\nof Latin, French, and Portuguese works. From him I received the following\r\ninformation respecting the unfortunate impostor Douville, the pretended\r\nauthor of the travels in the interior of Africa:—[14]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1836 he visited Formigas, and lived for some time in the\r\nhouse of the Vigario, passing himself off as Dr. Douville, and gaining\r\nmuch money by the practice of medicine: he also trafficked in the buying\r\nand selling of horses, notwithstanding that he said he was sent to\r\nBrazil by the king of France, on a mission to investigate its natural\r\nproductions and curiosities, and to construct a map of such portions\r\nof the empire as he chose to visit during his travels. He boasted much\r\nof his African journeys, exhibiting everywhere a gold medal, which he\r\nsaid he received from the Geographical Society of Paris, subsequent to\r\nthe publication of his work. The Vigario, as well as other persons of\r\nintelligence in Formigas, suspected him to be an impostor, concluding\r\nthat he was not the real Douville who was said to have travelled in\r\nAfrica, but another person who had got fraudulent possession of his\r\npapers, &c. He generally charged exorbitant sums of money to those he\r\nattended in his medical capacity, and it was owing to an instance of\r\nthis kind that he met with his death. Somewhere near the Rio de San\r\nFrancisco, he was called upon to attend a fazendeiro who was ill, and\r\nwith whom he bargained to effect his cure for the sum of 200 mil-reis,\r\nabout twenty-five pounds sterling; but in the end the patient died,\r\nnotwithstanding which, he insisted on receiving the stipulated sum, and\r\nafter some time, the heirs of the deceased yielding to his importunities,\r\ngave it to him. They did not, however, intend it should remain long in\r\nhis hands, for when Douville embarked to go down the river, they sent a\r\nman after him, who killed him one night as he was asleep in his canoe,\r\nand robbed him not only of the 200 mil-reis, but of everything he had in\r\nhis possession; thus he fell at last a victim to his own gross impostures.\r\n\r\nWe left Formigas on the morning of the 13th of July, and after travelling\r\nabout half a league we reached the mountain range, by which the valley\r\nis bounded, its structure being a dark compact primitive limestone. The\r\nascent, which is very gradual, is well wooded with small trees, but on\r\nreaching the top, we entered upon an undulating open barren country,\r\nwith only here and there a few clusters of trees in hollow places; to\r\nthese isolated woods, the name of capoes is given, an appellation which\r\nis highly poetical, being derived from the Indian word Caapoám, which\r\nsignifies an island. These island-woods form a peculiar feature in\r\nthe upland, open, undulating campos of the province of Minas Geräes.\r\nThe trees which compose them, chiefly consist of different species of\r\n_Myrcia_, _Eugenia_, _Vochysia_, _Anona_, _Laurus_, _Styrax_, &c.,\r\nintermingled with climbing shrubs, such as _Bauhinia_, _Paullinia_,\r\n&c. The soil in which these trees grow, is often so swampy that it is\r\ndifficult to get among them, nor can this be done without risk, on\r\naccount of the large boa constrictors which frequent these places.\r\n\r\nAfter a journey of about three leagues through this description of\r\ncountry, we came to a small stream in a hollow, where we determined\r\nto halt for the remainder of the day, as we had been told the next\r\nwatering-place was about three leagues further on. The spot we selected\r\nfor our quarters was under the shade of some small trees, but we had\r\nscarcely unloaded one horse, when we found ourselves covered with\r\ncarrapatos, and on examination discovered that both the grass and\r\nground were swarming with them. No time was lost in abandoning this\r\nspot, and ascending again to the open campo, we obtained shelter\r\nunder the wide-spreading boughs of a large Jatobá tree. In the grassy\r\nfields I found a pretty little melastomaceous shrub with rose-coloured\r\nflowers; and on the slanting face of a hill which led down to one of\r\nthe island-woods, I collected no less than five species of the genus\r\n_Eryngium_. During the night a cold wind blew over the table-land where\r\nwe slept, from the effects of which we endeavoured to protect ourselves,\r\nby means of a large fire that we kept burning, but which we had some\r\ndifficulty in maintaining for want of dry wood. Towards morning we were\r\nall aroused by the barking of our large mastiff dog, and the screaming\r\nof some one he had attacked. Our encampment was close by the side of the\r\npublic road, and the dog had sprung upon a poor black man who was on his\r\nway to Formigas from the diamond districts, and who had set out on his\r\njourney at this early hour to escape the heat of the day.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning we went on to the next watering-place, which\r\nwas a spring in a wooded hollow. The country through which we passed\r\nwas very different from that we had traversed on the previous day; the\r\nfirst half of the three leagues was through an elevated, but rather\r\nthickly wooded country, on leaving which we ascended a low Serra, covered\r\nwith a stunted shrubby vegetation; to these elevated shrubby tracts the\r\ninhabitants of Minas Geräes give the name of Carrascos.[15] Many of\r\nthe shrubs seen here, belonged to forms that were quite new to me. One\r\nof the most remarkable of these was a fine new species of the curious\r\ngenus _Lychnophora_, belonging to the natural order _Compositæ_, and is\r\npeculiar to the mountains of Minas Geräes, and which, together with the\r\nVellozias, give a decided feature to their otherwise peculiar vegetation.\r\nThis shrub is about six feet high, with numerous branches issuing nearly\r\nhorizontally from the upper part of the stem, each bearing a cluster of\r\nnarrow leaves about half a foot long. The whole of the plant, with the\r\nexception of the upper sides of the leaves, is everywhere covered with\r\na dense coat of long brownish-coloured wool, which, in places where it\r\ngrows abundantly, is collected by the inhabitants to fill their beds and\r\npillows. I afterwards met with some other species, having their leaves\r\nso very narrow that at first sight they resemble the Scotch fir, the\r\nlikeness being increased by their habit of growth, which is somewhat\r\nsimilar. In the afternoon we made a journey of three more leagues,\r\nthrough a hilly, barren, grassy country, and halted for the night in a\r\nhollow by the side of a small stream, a little beyond a fazenda called\r\nViados.\r\n\r\nAfter travelling about a league on the following morning, through a\r\nflattish country, we arrived at the Arraial de Bom Fim, an irregularly\r\nbuilt village, consisting of a church, and about forty or fifty houses,\r\nmany of which have a very dilapidated appearance. We stopped here no\r\nlonger than was necessary to give a feed of corn to the horses, of which\r\nthey stood greatly in need, the pastures through which we now were\r\npassing affording very little nourishment. The principal shop in the\r\nvillage of Bom Fim belonged, as it did twenty years before, when it was\r\nvisited by M. Auguste de St. Hilaire, to Colonel Pedro José Virciani,\r\nthe proprietor of a large fazenda about two leagues distant, where he\r\nresides, the shop being entrusted to a person in whom he confides;\r\nthis practice I found to be not uncommon with rich fazendeiros in this\r\nprovince. From the Vigario of Formigas I obtained a line of route from\r\nthis place to the Cidade Diamantina, but being here informed of another\r\nroad having the double recommendation of being both better and shorter, I\r\ndetermined on giving it the preference; by so doing it became necessary\r\nto pass the fazenda of San Eloi belonging to the above-mentioned Colonel\r\nVirciani. On arriving there I sent one of my men to ask leave to remain\r\ntill the following day, which was granted; but on learning that I was\r\na foreigner, he immediately ordered two good rooms to be prepared for\r\nme and my men, in a house adjoining that in which he resides. On being\r\nintroduced to him, I found him to be an elderly man, of hale appearance,\r\nand of very pleasing manners. I passed the evening very agreeably in\r\nhis house, when he informed me that M. Auguste de St. Hilaire remained\r\na day and night with him during the course of his journey to the Rio de\r\nSan Francisco. Although he made no mention to me of the circumstance, I\r\nafterwards learned that some observations made by that learned traveller\r\nand botanist, in the account of his visit to San Eloi, had much offended\r\nthis worthy man. The obnoxious passage was the following:—“Pendant tout\r\nle temps que je passai chez le Capitaine (for he was then only a captain)\r\nVirciani, la maîtresse de la maison ne se montra point; cependant, tandis\r\nque nous mangions, je voyais un minois féminin s’avancer doucement à\r\ntravers la porte entr’ouverte; mais aussitôt que je jetais les yeux de ce\r\ncôté, la dame disparaissait. C’est par une curiosité semblable que les\r\nfemmes cherchent à se dedommager du peu de liberté dont on les laisse\r\njouir.”[16]\r\n\r\nThe same lady was still alive, and I saw her every time I was in the\r\nhouse, but twenty years had made great alterations on the pretty face\r\nof which St. Hilaire had only a few glimpses. She had, however, several\r\ndaughters grown up, who were no less shy than the mother was in her\r\nyounger days. As soon as the colonel ascertained that I was acquainted\r\nwith the practice of medicine, he talked upon no other subject, being,\r\nas he said himself, a Curioso, which is the appellation given to those\r\nwho dabble in any profession, without having been regularly educated\r\nto it. As a number of his slaves were indisposed, I accompanied him on\r\na visit to each in succession, his object being to ascertain whether\r\nhe was treating them properly, and to have my advice respecting their\r\ncomplaints. His usual guide in these matters was a Portuguese translation\r\nof Buchan’s Domestic Medicine. I found all over Brazil, individuals\r\npossessed of no better information, who made a livelihood by their\r\npractice of medicine, passing from town to town, and from fazenda to\r\nfazenda, many of them, like their brethren in Europe, making large sums\r\nof money by their pretended skill in this science.\r\n\r\nThis fazenda was one of the best I had then seen in the interior; the\r\ncolonel’s house, which was of two stories, those of his slaves, his\r\nstore-houses, and other offices, were arranged in the form of a square;\r\nnear the house was a garden, in which most of the common European\r\nvegetables were cultivated with great care, and yielded good crops. It\r\nwas here that, for the first time since I left the coast at Aracaty, I\r\nsaw water employed to drive a wheel, as a substitute for manual labour,\r\nin the grinding of mandiocca, &c. This wheel was about fifteen feet\r\nin diameter, and was well supplied, on the overshot principle, with\r\nwater from a small stream that passed at some distance, conveyed in\r\na well-constructed wooden aqueduct: this power served alike for the\r\ngrinding of mandiocca, of cane, of Indian corn, and for bruising castor\r\noil seeds. The colonel every year prepares a considerable quantity of\r\ncastor oil, which is of better quality than any I have seen made in\r\nother parts of Brazil; it is used principally for burning in lamps,\r\nbut a little is also employed medicinally. The property belonging to\r\nColonel Virciani is well adapted both for the rearing of cattle and\r\nthe cultivation of sugar-cane, and it is from these sources that he\r\nprincipally derives his large income. The mandiocca, Indian corn, &c.,\r\nwhich he cultivates, are grown in quantities, not more than sufficient\r\nfor the consumption of his household and slaves. Besides an abundant\r\nsupply of corn for my horses, for which he would not accept payment, the\r\ncolonel provided me with a small quantity of tea, as my stock was then\r\nnearly exhausted, and none could be purchased either in San Romão, or\r\nFormigas. Colonel Virciani and his family used it constantly, procuring\r\nat intervals an entire chest from Rio de Janeiro.\r\n\r\nOn the morning we left San Eloi, we did not depart till after breakfast,\r\nso that we only accomplished a distance of about two leagues and a\r\nhalf, passing through an elevated level country, large tracts of which\r\nwere covered with low shrubs, forming that kind of vegetation called\r\nCarrasco; we then halted for a short time under a large silk-cotton tree,\r\nnear an open marshy campo, in which a fine stemless _Eriocaulon_ grew\r\nin great abundance. In the afternoon we made another journey of about a\r\nleague and a half, through an upland, grassy, hilly country, and towards\r\ndusk arrived at the fazenda do Sitio, which belongs to the Guarda-Môr,\r\nGonsalvo Christovão Pereira d’Alcami, from whom, though I carried no\r\nletter of recommendation to him, I received a most hospitable reception:\r\nrooms were immediately prepared for our use; and during the day and a\r\nhalf we remained there, both Mr. Walker and I were entertained at his\r\ntable. His house, which is an excellent one of two stories, is situated\r\nin a hollow, from which the view of the hilly country in the distance is\r\nvery fine.\r\n\r\nI remained here a day longer than I had intended, finding my collection\r\nof plants so great that it became necessary to arrange them; this\r\noccupied me a whole day, and I had fortunately the assistance of a\r\nbright sun-shine, which enabled me to dry all the moist paper, and to\r\nplace all the specimens in dry sheets. A fine stream flowing from the\r\nhills, passes close to the house, and in a walk I took along its banks\r\nin the afternoon, I added many botanical novelties to my collection. I\r\nwas informed by our host, that in the gravel of this stream two or three\r\ndiamonds had been found, from which it was evident that we were now on\r\nthe verge of that district, to which this precious stone gives its name.\r\n\r\nMy collections having been all put into order, I had resolved to\r\nresume the journey early next morning, but in this I was disappointed\r\nin consequence of one of my horses having strayed into the woods, and\r\ntherefore our departure was delayed till the afternoon. I had here again\r\nthe choice of two roads, one winding round the foot of a very high Serra,\r\nwhich, although longer, was much better than the other that passed over\r\nthe top of the Serra: I preferred the latter on account of the very\r\ndifferent vegetation I expected to find there, but as regarded the\r\nhorses, which were not at all in good condition, the former would have\r\nbeen the better. The Guarda-Môr wished me to remain another night, in\r\norder to avoid sleeping on the top of the mountain far from any house;\r\nbut as we were all much accustomed to this, it gave us no concern,\r\nalthough afterwards we had reason to regret our decision. Shortly after\r\nleaving the fazenda, we ascended a Serra of considerable height, barely\r\nwooded with a few low shrubs, the greater part of which consisted of\r\nthree species of _Lychnophora_. Continuing along the undulating top of\r\nthis, we reached another ascent, stony and difficult in the extreme\r\nfor the horses, which terminated in a rocky and rather flat top of\r\nconsiderable length. This place presented quite an alpine appearance; the\r\nrugged arenaceous schistose rocks, and even the ground, as well as the\r\nsmall shrubs, had a hoary appearance, from the numerous lichens by which\r\nthey were covered; and the cold we experienced was quite in unison with\r\nthe aspect of the country.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the elevated ranges of the Organ mountains,\r\nthis was the richest botanical field I had met with during my long\r\nperegrinations. So numerous indeed were the objects that presented\r\nthemselves on every side, each more beautiful or more curious than the\r\nother, that I was obliged to restrict myself in the number of specimens\r\ncollected, so that I might obtain at least a few of each kind. The\r\nshrubs here consisted of different species of _Lychnophora_, beautiful\r\n_Melastomacea_, a _Virgularia_ covered with rose-coloured blossoms,\r\nseveral _Hypti_, a _Panax_, &c.; and among these grew many curious kinds\r\nof _Eriocaulon_, and other small herbaceous plants. The soil here was\r\nrather boggy, and numerous little rills of limpid water were flowing down\r\nthe mountain in all directions. Leaving this flat, we entered upon a\r\nthird ascent, steeper and more stony than the previous one, which shortly\r\nbrought us to a flattish, grassy, somewhat shrubby tract.\r\n\r\nOn this ascent a different vegetation again presented itself, two of the\r\nmost beautiful of the plants being a species of _Physocalyx_, a handsome\r\nshrub about three feet high, with numerous orange-red flowers, surrounded\r\nby a large inflated calyx of nearly the same colour, and a beautiful\r\nscarlet-flowered _Lisianthus_. We proceeded on the flat top of this\r\nridge about half a league, every step yielding some new plant. It was\r\nquite dark before we arrived at a place suitable for our encampment; this\r\nwas a dry, sandy, grassy spot, by the side of the path; there were only a\r\nfew small trees in the immediate neighbourhood, and the men, by groping\r\nbeneath them, obtained as many dry sticks as sufficed to make a small\r\nfire wherewith to cook our supper.\r\n\r\nThe sky was quite clear on our arrival, but shortly afterwards a thunder\r\nstorm was seen gathering to the westward; and no sooner were we laid down\r\non our hide beds, by the side of the fire, than the rain began to fall,\r\nand having no shelter of any kind, we were soon completely drenched;\r\nthe men, in their anxiety to keep the fire alight, held a hide over it\r\ntill the storm ceased. The flashes of lightning were extremely vivid,\r\nand the peals of thunder fearfully loud. After it had passed over, we\r\nmade ourselves as comfortable as our circumstances would permit, and\r\nlaid ourselves down, in the hope of not being again disturbed. In this,\r\nhowever, we were sadly disappointed, for shortly after we had fallen\r\nasleep, the storm returned in all its fury, leaving us in a far worse\r\nstate than we had previously been. Those only who have passed a night\r\nunder such circumstances can imagine the annoyance we experienced; could\r\nwe have seen the probability of its occurrence, we might have been better\r\nprepared for it, but in the middle of the dry season we certainly had no\r\nreason to expect so much rain. A third time we laid ourselves down, not\r\nto sleep, because that was now impossible, cold and wet as we were, for\r\nthe fire had been completely extinguished by the quantity of rain that\r\nhad fallen.\r\n\r\nWhen daylight broke, I found the place where we were encamped to be one\r\nof the most lovely that can be conceived, abounding in a variety of\r\nbeautiful shrubs, and many curious plants. We remained here till noon, in\r\nthe expectation that the sun would shine with force sufficient to enable\r\nus to dry all the things that had been wetted by the rain during the\r\nnight; but the whole forenoon continuing cloudy, we resolved to pursue\r\nour journey. In the morning, immediately after breakfast, I returned\r\nwith one of my men to the top of the last ascent we had passed the night\r\nbefore; and made several other shorter excursions in the vicinity of\r\nthe encampment, by which many interesting novelties were added to my\r\ncollections. We did not start till shortly after mid-day, when, after a\r\nfatiguing journey of three long leagues, we arrived at a very recently\r\nestablished gold working called Lavrinha. Our route was entirely along\r\nthe flat top of the Serra, sometimes passing through large open grassy\r\ntracts, abounding in numerous kinds of _Eriocaulon_, _Melastomaceæ_,\r\n_Compositæ_, a blue flowered _Lupinus_, a small _Virgularia_ with\r\npale rose-coloured flowers, great profusion of a purple _Vellozia_,\r\nand the beautiful scarlet-flowered _Lisianthus_, &c.; and sometimes\r\nthrough rugged tracts thinly wooded with small shrubs, among them\r\nnumerous _Melastomaceæ_, many of them with small imbricated leaves, and\r\nlarge rose-coloured blossoms, forming the most elegant little bushes\r\nimaginable, in general habit not unlike heaths. Although this journey\r\nwas very fatiguing to the animals, to me it was exciting and delightful\r\nin the extreme; the whole country through which we had passed for nearly\r\ntwo days, was one vast flower garden, where, ‘like a child at a feast,’\r\nI knew not which object to grasp at first: everything was not only new\r\nto me, but each more beautiful or more curious than the other. In this\r\nupland region a solemn silence reigned, not a single animal of any\r\ndescription having been observed during our progress through it, nor any\r\nsound heard except that made by ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe reached Lavrinha about five o’clock in the afternoon; and although\r\nthe sun shone brilliantly during the better part of our journey, it was\r\ntoo late to attempt drying any of our things when we arrived. Lavrinha,\r\nas I have already stated, is a small gold working, then but recently\r\nestablished. The only buildings near it were a small hut, made of a few\r\nposts and poles, covered with Buriti palm leaves, where the overseer\r\nslept, and a few sheds of the same materials for the shelter of the\r\nslaves; we obtained accommodation in one corner of the former. A small\r\nstream that passes close by, but which is only supplied with water in the\r\nrainy season, had offered some indications of gold, which induced some\r\nrich fazendeiros, among whom were Colonel Virciani and the Guarda-Môr,\r\nto form themselves into a society, six months before my visit, with the\r\nobject of establishing a working; accordingly about forty slaves were\r\nsent to carry on the operations, under the directions of the person who\r\nfirst discovered the gold, and who, for his labour, obtained a number of\r\nshares in the concern. The vein from which the gold found in this small\r\nstream had been washed, was discovered proceeding downwards through a\r\nsoft white arenaceous schistose rock; and at the period of my visit,\r\nthey had mined to the depth of about thirty feet. I found them then\r\noccupied in washing the material they had taken out, which proved to be\r\nvery uncertain in its product, some days yielding one, two, and three\r\nounces of gold, but more frequently the amount was less than an ounce.\r\nA short time before our arrival, as much as four ounces resulted from a\r\nsingle day’s labour, but it had again diminished to less than an ounce.\r\nIt appeared to me, from the awkward manner in which the works were then\r\ncarried on, that they would never turn to profitable account, as the\r\nperson in charge of the operations was not only quite ignorant of the art\r\nof mining, but unacquainted with the most simple operations in mechanics.\r\nWhile employed in the labour of excavating, a considerable amount of\r\nwater was constantly flowing into the mine from two springs; and this was\r\nagain drawn out in buckets by hand labour, continued both day and night;\r\nwhereas a pump of no large diameter would have served to carry off the\r\nwater more quickly and effectually, and saved the labour of at least ten\r\nor twelve men. When I mentioned this to the manager, he told me that no\r\none in the neighbourhood had the smallest idea of the construction of a\r\npump. Even a common winch and buckets would have been far better than\r\nthe plan here adopted, but such was the low state of their mechanical\r\nknowledge, that they knew not how to construct even so simple a machine.\r\n\r\nThe following day being one of clear sun-shine, we were occupied all the\r\nforenoon in drying our wet clothes, and in arranging the large collection\r\nof specimens made the day before; and in the afternoon, I took several\r\nshort walks in the neighbourhood in quest of novelties. Lavrinha is\r\nsituated on the southern extremity of the Serra, in a hollow, surrounded\r\nby rocky hills, somewhat lower than those which form the northern parts\r\nof the Serra. Here I again made numerous collections, among which were\r\ntwo fine orchideous plants, both species of the beautiful genus _Lælia_,\r\none of them bearing violet-coloured, and the other bright yellow flowers.\r\nIn dry arid clefts in the rocks grew several curious little _Vellozias_,\r\nand _Eriocaulons_; one of the latter was a branched species about six\r\nfeet high.\r\n\r\nHaving so frequently mentioned this curious tribe of plants, I will\r\nhere make a few observations upon them. When Linnæus published the\r\nlast edition of his _Species Plantarum_, in 1764, he described only\r\nfive species from all parts of the world, while, from Brazil alone, my\r\nherbarium contains upwards of one hundred. Only one species is found in\r\nGreat Britain,—a little grass-like plant, with a single flowering stem\r\nabout six inches long, bearing a small globular head of minute white\r\nflowers. It is found only in lakes in the Isle of Skye, and in the west\r\nof Ireland. Very few of the Brazilian plants bear much resemblance to\r\nthis northern species; for a great number of them are large suffruticose\r\nplants, often obtaining a height of from four to six feet, with leafy,\r\nvery much branched stems, each branchlet terminated by a large white\r\nball, composed of a vast number of smaller heads, placed on peduncles\r\nof unequal length. Another remarkable circumstance connected with these\r\nstrange plants, is the fact, that the greater number of the Brazilian\r\nspecies do not inhabit water, in the manner of our native British one,\r\nbut grow in the most dry and arid portions of mountainous declivities;\r\nmany others also grow in parched, flat, sandy places, which are flooded\r\nin the wet season; the truly aquatic Brazilian kinds, more or less\r\nresemble our own in habit.[17]\r\n\r\nShortly after leaving Lavrinha, we began to descend the Serra, which on\r\nthis side is of no great height. The road was very bad, turning and\r\nwinding among large blocks of rock, and covered with loose stones, which\r\nrolled under the horses’ feet, and rendered our downward progress not a\r\nlittle dangerous. Having at length accomplished the descent, we found\r\nourselves on a comparatively good road, and in a flat country, being in\r\nfact a large valley surrounded by hills, and presenting several small\r\nswamps where a few Buriti palms grew, but which, from their diminutive\r\nstature, compared with those we had seen in similar situations in the\r\nprovinces of Piauhy and Goyaz, did not appear to thrive under the great\r\ndegree of cold to which they are here exposed. After travelling about two\r\nleagues and a half, we halted during the middle of the day in a shady\r\nplace by the side of a small rivulet, opposite a rounded knoll, which\r\nwas covered with _Lychnophora pinaster_, bearing much resemblance to the\r\nScotch Fir, and a large kind of tree-lily.\r\n\r\nProceeding in the afternoon through the same valley, which had now become\r\ngradually narrower, and which was bounded by two long ranges of bare\r\ngrassy hills, we arrived about sunset, on the banks of a small river,\r\ncalled the Rio Inhacica, and took up our quarters for the night in the\r\nopen veranda of a small venda, the only house in the place. We fully\r\nexpected to have purchased here some addition to our stock of provisions,\r\nbut the only article to be found for sale was rum. Not long after our\r\narrival, however, a person belonging to the house returned from the river\r\nwith a fine fish about a foot and a half long, which I gladly bought for\r\na small sum, and it afforded us an excellent supper. While engaged in\r\narranging my plants, and placing the specimens in paper, I was surprised\r\nto hear from the proprietor of the venda, a middle aged mulatto, who was\r\nstanding by looking on, that he also was well acquainted with that kind\r\nof occupation, having been in the employment of Drs. Spix and Martius,\r\nduring their excursions in the provinces of Minas Geräes, Goyaz, and\r\nBahia. He spoke in the highest terms of the kindness he received from\r\nthese travellers, and the pleasant life he led while in their service,\r\nthe only drawback to which was the great trouble he often experienced in\r\ndrying the paper for preserving their botanical specimens. This I could\r\nwell believe, as I found from experience that the men did not at all\r\nrelish such labour, being often obliged, in cloudy and rainy weather, to\r\ndry every day several reams, sheet by sheet, over the fire.\r\n\r\nThe mulatto, being the ferryman, passed the luggage safely over to the\r\nopposite side of the river in a canoe. We were again annoyed by our too\r\nfrequent cause of detention, the straying of one of the horses, which\r\nwas not found till near mid-day, so that we were not able to accomplish\r\nthat day more than about three leagues. The country still continued flat,\r\nwith the exception of one or two low, dry, gravelly hills that we passed\r\nover; in many places, particularly in the hollows, it was pretty well\r\nwooded with small evergreen trees. The day was very hot and sultry, and\r\nas I suffered much from a severe headache, I was extremely glad when we\r\narrived early in the afternoon at our destination, which was a little\r\nhamlet, consisting of about half a dozen houses called As Vargems: we\r\nwere allowed to take up our quarters in an open shed belonging to one\r\nof the houses, used for the preparation of farinha de mandiocca, in\r\nwhich process several persons were then employed. The wheel used for\r\ngrinding the root was driven by a small water-wheel, which, although\r\nrudely constructed, answered the purpose extremely well, and saved much\r\nmanual labour. The little streams of water, which are so frequent in the\r\nhilly districts of the province of Minas Geräes, afford the inhabitants\r\ngreat advantages over those of the dry northern provinces. This was only\r\nthe second time I had seen water power applied to such purposes, but in\r\ntravelling further south I found it generally used. The people belonging\r\nto the house where we rested, were nearly white, and appeared to be very\r\npoor, but they were very civil and kind.\r\n\r\nA journey of about a league and a half from As Vargems, through a flat\r\nvalley, bounded on the right by a high bare rocky Serra, brought us\r\nto another small stream called Rio Inhahy, which, being here of no\r\ninconvenient depth, the horses forded in safety with all the luggage.\r\nOn a rising ground a little beyond the river, we observed a large house\r\nclose to what appeared to be the ruins of a church; but we afterwards\r\nlearned that it was a Registo, or place where all travellers, who passed\r\ninto or out of the Diamond district proper, of which this is one of\r\nthe boundaries, were duly examined, in order to prevent any contraband\r\nextraction of diamonds—a system of precaution that was chiefly in vigour\r\nprior to the independence of Brazil, when the workings of this precious\r\nstone were carried on entirely by the government. On reaching the house\r\nwe found it uninhabited, and fast falling into a state of decay: we took\r\npossession of one of the largest apartments, which, being well roofed,\r\nafforded us better shelter from the sun than we could have obtained under\r\nthe shade of a tree. It was late in the afternoon before we left this\r\nplace, having employed the morning in repairing the horses’ trappings,\r\nand we did not accomplish more than half a league of our journey, our\r\nroute being, for the greater part of the way, over a bare grassy hill,\r\nwhere I found a few shrubs in flower: we encamped for the night under\r\nsome trees in a hollow, by the side of a little limpid stream. Another\r\nshort journey of somewhat more than half a league, brought us early\r\nin the forenoon of the following day to a place known by the name of\r\nBassoras and Areas, on the banks of the Rio Jiquitinhonha. Although\r\nthis river is not very large here, we found it too deep to venture the\r\nluggage upon the horses’ backs; and as there was no canoe, no alternative\r\nremained but to have it carried over on the heads of the men; this\r\noccupied so much time, that we found it too late to proceed further\r\nbefore breakfast.\r\n\r\nI was afterwards glad that we were obliged to remain here, as it afforded\r\nme an opportunity of witnessing the operations carried on in one of the\r\nlargest diamond mines, if not the largest, at this time worked in the\r\ndistrict. The principal house in this place belonged to Captain Jozé\r\nd’Almeida e Silva, who was also the proprietor of the mine. As no large\r\ntree could be found under which we could take shelter, I was directed\r\nto the house of the captain, who would be most likely to afford us\r\naccommodation, during the short time we intended to remain here; and\r\nseeing him at the door, I accosted him with this view, when he politely\r\ninformed me that the only place he could give us was an open shed, to\r\nwhich he pointed, where some black carpenters were at work. About half\r\nan hour after we had established ourselves in this not very comfortable\r\nplace, and while employed in arranging the collections made during my\r\nmorning’s ride, the captain having learned the nature of my occupation,\r\ncame over to offer me the use of an empty room in his house, but as\r\nall my luggage was now unpacked, I thanked him for his kindness, and\r\ndeclined his invitation: he, however, politely pressed me to remain all\r\nday, that I might see how the mining operations were carried on. About\r\nan hour after we arrived, a troop of several mules came in from one of\r\nhis fazendas, with provisions for his slaves; and very soon after, he\r\nsent me a present of fruit, consisting of a basket of fine oranges, and\r\nanother of Jabuticabas, both of which we greatly enjoyed, as we had not\r\ntasted fruit of any kind for a long time. The Jabuticaba is the fruit\r\nof a species of _Eugenia_ (_E. cauliflora_, Mart.), which grows wild in\r\nthe woods of the south of Brazil, and is also cultivated in most of the\r\ngardens in the diamond and gold districts. It is of a black colour, about\r\nthe size of a greengage plum, of a pulpy consistence, and very refreshing.\r\n\r\nThe mine of Captain Almeida was close to the Rio Jiquitinhonha, upon an\r\nelbow of land that at one time must have formed the bed of the river.\r\nA mine in the neighbourhood had been worked by the government about\r\nforty years ago, which yielded, in the course of three years, not less\r\nthan thirty-seven lbs. six drs. of diamonds;[18] the formation, as it\r\nis called, becoming exhausted at the end of this period, the mine was\r\nabandoned. In the expectation of similar good fortune, Capt. Almeida\r\ncommenced operations near the same place, about seven months before my\r\nvisit, with upwards of a hundred and fifty slaves, all of whom were hired\r\nfrom his neighbours. At an expense of about £1,000 sterling, he brought\r\na small stream of water from a distance of a league and a half, opened\r\na large excavation, and erected pumps, worked by a water-wheel, for the\r\npurpose of clearing the mine of water. The excavation was carried on to\r\nthe depth of about thirty feet, without encountering any proper diamond\r\nformation, although on being washed it yielded a small number of stones\r\nof no great value. A short time before my arrival he commenced another\r\nexcavation in the same neighbourhood, about forty yards square. The\r\ndifferent kinds of soil through which it was necessary to cut, before\r\nreaching the deposit in which the diamonds were found, were, in the first\r\nplace, about twenty feet of a reddish sandy soil, which was loosened by\r\nthe hoe, and then washed into the river by a current of water, issuing\r\nfrom the small stream that served to work the water-wheel; below this was\r\nabout eight feet of a tough yellowish clay, which was dug out by the hoe,\r\nand carried away on the heads of negroes, in flat wooden bowls about a\r\nfoot and a half in diameter, no such implement as a barrow being known\r\nhere; beneath this clay appeared a layer of coarse reddish sand, about\r\ntwo feet and a half in thickness, below which was found the peculiar\r\nsoil that contains the diamonds. When this diamond formation consists of\r\nloose gravel, it is called Cascalho in the language of the miners, and\r\nCanga, when found in the shape of a ferruginous conglomerate; this bed\r\nvaries from one to four feet in thickness, and the gravel of which it\r\nis composed, consists of small pebbles of primitive rocks, which from\r\ntheir rounded and polished nature have evidently, at some distant period,\r\nformed the bed of a stream of running water. These pebbles are of various\r\nkinds, but when there appears much of what they call Esmeril preto, a\r\nvariety of tourmaline, the Cascalho is considered to be rich in diamonds.\r\nThe Cascalho generally rests upon a substratum of a kind of hard clay\r\ncalled Pizarra, beneath which are found the solid schistose rocks which\r\ngenerally prevail throughout the whole diamond district. Sometimes Canga,\r\nor the agglutinated gravel, rests upon a rock called Marmore, which\r\nappeared, from the description of it given by Captain Almeida, to be a\r\nkind of limestone; and when this occurs, it is always found to be rich in\r\ndiamonds.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the washing of the Cascalho is carried on is the\r\nfollowing: along one side of a pond of water is placed a range of eleven\r\ntroughs, about three feet square, made of small straight stakes driven\r\ninto the ground, the side next to the water being much lower than the\r\nothers; the bottom is made of clay closely pressed down; the troughs are\r\ncalled Bacós, and into each of them a portion of Cascalho is put by a\r\nslave stationed there for that purpose; immediately in front of each Bacó\r\nstands a slave up to his knees in water, having a large flat wooden plate\r\n(Bateia) with which he dashes water upon the Cascalho with considerable\r\nforce; by this means, and by stirring it at frequent intervals with a\r\nsmall kind of hoe, it is freed from the earth and sand with which it is\r\nmixed, when the larger particles of gravel making their appearance on\r\nthe surface are taken out; it is during this process that the largest\r\ndiamonds are generally found. Immediately in front of these troughs,\r\nand about three feet above the level of the ground, separate seats are\r\nerected for two overseers, each armed with a long leathern whip, who keep\r\na strict look out that no diamonds are stolen. This labour is continued\r\nfrom morning till about four o’clock in the afternoon, when the Cascalho,\r\nthus washed and purified, is taken out of the Bacós, and carried to\r\nthe side of a little stream of running water, to be finally washed. On\r\naccompanying the captain to witness the performance of this operation,\r\nwhich to the stranger is the most interesting process in diamond-mining,\r\nI found seven slaves seated on the side of a small canal about four feet\r\nbroad, with their legs in the water nearly up to their knees; this little\r\nstream of running water is called the Lavadeira. Each of the slaves had\r\na large flat wooden plate, similar to that used in washing the rough\r\nCascalho, into which a small shovelful of the purified Cascalho was put\r\nby a slave stationed behind the others for that purpose. This done, the\r\nwasher filled the Bateia with water, and whirling it round in a peculiar\r\nmanner on the surface of the stream, the larger gravel rose to the top,\r\nand was carefully examined. This being repeated several times, he then\r\nplaced the Bateia on his knees, the right knee being considerably lower\r\nthan the left, when with his hand he threw water on the fine gravel,\r\nwhich was thus washed out with great care into the canal, continuing in\r\nthis manner until the Bateia was empty; it is in this last process that\r\ndiamonds are expected to be found. A small Bateia, containing a little\r\nwater, was placed on a low pedestal between the two overseers, and into\r\nthis the diamonds were put as they were found, which on this occasion\r\namounted to eleven, all of which, however, were small. In the bottom\r\nof the Bateias is always found a small quantity of gold dust, which is\r\ncarefully preserved.\r\n\r\nAlthough diamonds are usually found in the diluvial gravelly soil above\r\ndescribed, that is not, however, the matrix in which they have originally\r\nbeen formed. Whatever may be the case in other countries, I remained\r\nperfectly satisfied that here, they have originally been formed in the\r\nmetamorphic quarto-schistose rock, of which the mountains in the Diamond\r\ndistrict are constituted, and that they have, during a long series of\r\nyears, been washed down along with the other débris, to the places where\r\nthey are now found so abundantly. These rocks are rather soft in their\r\nnature, and of course easily disintegrated; hence the many wild ravines\r\nwhich intersect this range, excavated by the small streams that flow\r\nfrom it. Small masses of the rock have frequently been found containing\r\ndiamonds imbedded in them; in the Cidade Diamantina I saw two beautiful\r\nspecimens, in each of which one half of a small diamond was exposed; the\r\nextravagant price asked for them prevented me from purchasing either.\r\n\r\nWhen we read in books, that the diamond is a production of the most\r\nrecent geographical epoch, as stated, for instance, by Dr. A. Petzholdt,\r\nin Jamieson’s Journal, no. 68, we cannot help imagining that those who\r\npromulgate such opinions, have been led astray by travellers, who have\r\nlistened to the idle stories of the uneducated inhabitants of Diamond\r\ncountries, who almost all assert, that diamonds are regenerated in the\r\ncourse of a few years, in the soil from which others had previously been\r\ntaken. This I found to be a very common opinion in Brazil; but those\r\nbest able to form a just conclusion on the subject, for instance, such\r\nintelligent miners as Captain Josè D’Almeida e Silva, believe otherwise.\r\nIt is true that he, as well as others, have frequently a second time\r\nwashed the same Cascalho that had been worked when the government held\r\nthe monopoly in its own hands, not because they believed new diamonds to\r\nhave been since formed, but because they well knew that in those times\r\nthe Cascalho was not so carefully examined as it is at present; indeed,\r\nnotwithstanding the most careful scrutiny, it is believed that some\r\ndiamonds still escape notice.\r\n\r\nWe resumed our journey on the following morning, and after travelling\r\nabout two leagues and a half, we halted to breakfast in an open shed,\r\nbelonging to a house by the road-side, which was then uninhabited. The\r\ncountry through which we passed was hilly, and well-wooded with small\r\ntrees and shrubs. The ascent and descent of the higher hills are much\r\nfacilitated by the care bestowed on the formation of the roads, as\r\nthey are well paved with large flat blocks of the schistose rocks, of\r\nwhich the mountains are composed. In many places, however, the pavement\r\nis beginning to give way, from the water flowing over it in the rainy\r\nseason, and if not repaired, it will soon fall into a very ruinous\r\nstate. A wooden bridge, also, which crossed a small river, and which\r\nappears to have been at one time of excellent construction, was now in\r\nsuch a decayed state, that no one could venture to pass over it; we\r\nwere consequently obliged to ford the stream a little way below the\r\nbridge. In the bed of the river we saw several groups of people washing\r\nfor diamonds. Early in the afternoon, we started for the Arraial de\r\nMendanha, only half a league distant; the road led through a flat bushy\r\nvalley, surrounded on both sides by mountains, those on the left rose\r\nto a considerable height, and presented the same arid rocky aspect as\r\nthe mountains in the Highlands of Scotland. In the middle of this valley\r\nran the Rio Jiquitinhonha, which we crossed to reach the village on the\r\nopposite side: this was easily accomplished over a well-constructed\r\nwooden bridge, of considerable span, on which is a toll-bar, the first\r\nwe had yet met with in the country, and this afforded evidence that we\r\nwere now approaching a more civilized part of Brazil than any we had yet\r\ntraversed. At this bar, I had to pay forty reis for each loaded horse,\r\nand twenty for each of my men, which I did with much pleasure, as I well\r\nknew the labour and risk encountered in passing the luggage over rivers,\r\nwhen not provided with bridges.\r\n\r\nOn enquiring for a place where we might pass the night, we were directed\r\nto the public Rancho, but finding it a small place, extremely dirty, and\r\noccupied by a number of black Tropeiros, I could not think of taking up\r\nmy quarters there. Ranchos are large sheds, generally open at the sides,\r\nand built near a venda, for the accommodation of travellers. This was the\r\nfirst I had seen since leaving the coast, but I afterwards found them\r\nvery common on the more frequented roads in Minas, but particularly on\r\nthe great highway between the Gold district and Rio de Janeiro. Rather\r\nthan remain at the Rancho, I preferred hiring an empty house for the\r\nnight, and obtained, at last, after some trouble, the keys of one that\r\nwas newly built.\r\n\r\nThe Arraial de Mendanha appeared to be a flourishing little place,\r\ncontaining a population of about eight hundred persons, nearly every\r\nhouse being inhabited. The situation of the village, although romantic,\r\nis far from fertile, being on the bare rocky bottom of a high mountain,\r\nwhich nearly overhangs it, with little or no ground in its vicinity\r\nfitted for plantations of any description. The greater part of the\r\ninhabitants obtain an income by employing their slaves in mining for\r\ndiamonds, or by keeping shops to supply the others with provisions and\r\nclothing, principally in exchange for diamonds and gold-dust, and were it\r\nnot, indeed, for the diamond mines that exist in the neighbourhood, not\r\na single house would have been erected in this place. Soon after leaving\r\nMendanha on the following day, we began the ascent of the Serra, which\r\nbears the same name; it was about a league in length, and notwithstanding\r\nits steepness in many places, the excellence of the road rendered it\r\ncomparatively easy. In nearly its whole extent, it is well paved with\r\nlarge flat blocks of the sandy schistose rock, of which the Serra is\r\nformed, taking a zigzag direction, where the ascent is steepest; the\r\nlower part of the Serra, particularly along a deep ravine, by the side of\r\nwhich the road leads, is pretty well wooded with small trees and shrubs,\r\nbut towards the summit it presents the same bare alpine appearance as\r\nthat we had crossed before reaching the little gold mine at Lavrinha.\r\nI walked up the greater part of the ascent on foot, botanizing all the\r\nway, and picked up several novelties. From the summit to Duas Pontes,\r\nwhich is a league distant, the road leads through a flat rocky and bushy\r\ncountry, with some elevated ridges on the left, covered with a very\r\nstunted shrubby vegetation. At Duas Pontes, where we halted to breakfast,\r\nwe found two houses, being the only ones existing between Mendanha and\r\nthe Cidade Diamantina, a distance of four leagues; the place takes its\r\nname from two bridges which exist near it, standing about a mile distant\r\nfrom each other, both very well constructed of timber. One of the houses\r\nwas a small venda belonging to a negro, who informed me that he was a\r\nnative of Africa, and had worked for many years as a slave in diamond\r\nwashing, but that by the provident use of his privilege of working on\r\nhis own account on Sundays and holidays, he had been fortunate enough to\r\nfind as many diamonds as enabled him not only to purchase his freedom,\r\nbut that of his wife and several children. Near this place I found a\r\nspecies of _Rubus_ loaded with fruit, which forcibly reminded me of the\r\ndays of my boyhood, and the bramble hedges of my native country. In open\r\nplaces, I met with a few specimens of a second species of _Physocalyx_,\r\nand a beautiful _Andromeda_, having large panicles of crimson flowers.\r\nWe were now only two leagues distant from the Cidade Diamantina, a\r\njourney that might easily have been accomplished that afternoon, but not\r\nwishing to enter it by night, owing to the great difficulty a stranger\r\nalways experiences in find accommodation, as well for himself as for his\r\nanimals; under such circumstances, I resolved to take up my abode for the\r\nnight, in an open campo on the top of the Serra, near a small stream of\r\nwater, within half a league from the city. The country through which we\r\npassed on this short journey was almost entirely destitute both of trees\r\nand shrubs, consisting chiefly of large undulating grassy campos, in many\r\nplaces abounding in great blocks of rocks, similar to that of which the\r\nSerra is composed. Two miles before reaching the place where we halted,\r\nwe obtained a most extensive view of the country to the eastward, which\r\nis perhaps one of the most rugged and arid regions existing in Brazil; as\r\nfar as the eye could reach, nothing was to be seen but hundreds of bare\r\nhills, whose barren tops were whitened by the numerous _Lichens_ with\r\nwhich the rocks were covered. Overlooking these lower ridges stood the\r\nlofty peak called Itambé, the top of which is upwards of 6,000 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea. It was with great difficulty the men could find as\r\nmuch wood as would make a fire to cook our supper, and we were obliged,\r\nfor the first time, to lay ourselves down to sleep without a large fire\r\nburning all night, at a time, too, when the cold was greater than any we\r\nhad yet experienced.\r\n\r\nOn rising in the morning, the thermometer indicated 54°, Fahrenheit,\r\nunder which temperature we were all shivering with excessive cold, so\r\nlong accustomed as we had been to a warmer climate. In an hour’s time,\r\nafter resuming our journey, we commenced the descent of the Serra, over\r\na road constructed in the same manner as the ascent at Mendanha, but\r\nneither so long nor so steep; shortly after which, we came in sight\r\nof the famous Cidade Diamantina, or city of Diamonds. This capital\r\nof a rich province occupies the whole acclivity of a Serra, equal in\r\nheight to that we had just descended, from which it is separated by a\r\nnarrow valley. The traveller approaches the city so suddenly, that it\r\nalmost appears as if called into existence by the power of magic; he is\r\nastonished at the sight of so great an assemblage of large white-washed\r\nhouses, intermingled with many churches, rising gradually one above the\r\nother along the steep sides of the Serra, together with the numerous\r\nsmall plantations, by which the houses in the suburbs are surrounded,\r\nconsisting of orange trees, bananas, and the usual productions of\r\na tropical country; together with abundance of the compact growing\r\nJabuticabeira, and many fine trees of the large grotesque Brazilian pine\r\n(_Araucaria Brasiliana_), which contrasts strangely with the rocky and\r\nabsolutely bare country, that surrounds the city on all sides: it is,\r\nindeed, an Oasis in the desert.\r\n\r\nHaving no letters of recommendation to any person in the city, I went\r\nimmediately on my arrival to the house of the Juiz de Paz, to present\r\nmy passport, and learning from him that a small inn was to be found\r\nin the lower part of the city, I determined to put up there, until I\r\ncould succeed in hiring an empty house for a few days; fortunately,\r\nthe landlord had one to let, in the upper part of the city, whither we\r\nquickly removed, glad that we were not obliged to remain at the inn,\r\nwhere the accommodations were far from tempting.\r\n\r\nThis place, formerly known as the Arraial de Tijuco, was, in the year\r\n1839, elevated to the dignity of a city, under the name of Cidade\r\nDiamantina, from its being the capital of the Diamond district. According\r\nto information which I received from the Juiz de Paz, its population\r\namounted to about 6,000 souls; the streets are very irregular, and\r\ngenerally very narrow, as well as badly paved; both within the city and\r\nin the suburbs there are many fine houses, of two and three stories, and\r\nas there is abundance of excellent stone in the neighbourhood, nearly all\r\nare built of this material. They are constructed, however, at an enormous\r\nexpense, owing to the great distance from which timber can be obtained;\r\nit is all dragged by bullocks from the Sertão, a distance of from four to\r\nsixteen leagues, over a rugged, hilly country, through which carts cannot\r\npass; owing to the same reason, fire-wood is extremely dear in the city,\r\nand very bad in quality, as it is often brought for sale in a half green\r\nstate. Many slaves are employed by their owners in cutting the large\r\nshrubs that grow in the ravines, within a short distance from the city,\r\nthe branches of which are made up into bundles, and offered for sale from\r\nhouse to house; the stems of the large tree-lily (_Vellozia_) are also\r\ncollected for fuel, particularly a kind that exudes abundance of resinous\r\nmatter. The Tropeiros on approaching the city with their loaded mules,\r\nalways bring with them, from the wooded countries, as many bundles of\r\nsplit wood as suffice them for the purposes of cooking till the period of\r\ntheir departure.\r\n\r\nMany of the shops are quite equal in appearance to those in Rio de\r\nJaneiro, and are provided with nearly the same articles, the difference\r\nin price seldom exceeding twenty per cent. All European goods, with the\r\nexception of a few from Bahia, are brought from Rio on the backs of\r\nmules, which are daily to be seen arriving in troops, sometimes of a\r\nhundred at a time. With the exception of the few vegetables grown in the\r\ngardens around the city, every product consumed here as food is brought\r\nfrom a distance of from ten to twenty leagues, and sold in large market\r\nplaces, called Intendencias. These products consist chiefly of farinha\r\nde mandiocca and Indian meal, the latter being much more extensively\r\nused in the province of Minas, than in the northern provinces; also\r\ndried beef, sugar, pork, cheese, Indian corn, french beans, rice, and\r\ncastor-oil, which is used to burn in lamps. The city contains three or\r\nfour handsome churches, one called Nossa Senhora da Rosaria, belongs to\r\nthe negroes from the coast of Africa, and where, over the high altar, is\r\nseen the figure of a black virgin. As we lived closed to this church, I\r\nattended on several evenings the celebration of one of its festivals,\r\nand found not only the blacks who usually attend the church, but many\r\nof the most respectable male and female inhabitants of the city. Every\r\nthing was conducted with the greatest propriety, and on one evening I\r\nheard a very excellent sermon preached by one of the priests belonging to\r\nthe city. During our stay a Novena was held in another of the churches,\r\nNossa Senhora das Mercês, where I attended several times; on all these\r\noccasions I was particularly struck with the different mode in which\r\nthe ladies dressed here, from that I had observed in other parts of the\r\ninterior. In the large towns I had previously visited, I remarked that\r\na greater number of ladies attended church during the Novenas than at\r\nany other time, when both the more respectable, as well as the poorer\r\nclasses, were always dressed in their best attire. In Cidade Diamantina,\r\nalthough the churches on such occasions were equally well attended, the\r\nmost respectable ladies were not so well dressed as usual, and were\r\nit not that the superior classes avail themselves of the privilege of\r\nsquatting on the floor before the altar, they would not be distinguished\r\nfrom the poorer individuals who take their station behind them. They all\r\nappear in the same kind of dress, which consists of a dark coloured\r\ncloth cloak, with a large cape, in which they muffle themselves; and a\r\nwhite handkerchief which is tied round the head, surmounted by a man’s\r\nhat. During the three weeks I remained in the city, I never saw a lady\r\nwalking abroad in any other kind of hat; some few were white, but black\r\nseemed the most fashionable.\r\n\r\nThe most elevated portion of the city is about 4,000 feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea, and the climate is consequently mild. During my stay\r\nin the month of July, the thermometer ranged from 54° to 60° at noon,\r\na temperature we had long been unaccustomed to, and we suffered not a\r\nlittle from the cold. As a fire could only be kindled in the kitchen,\r\nwe used all to get as close to it as possible, particularly in the\r\nmorning; it was however during the night that we suffered most, for our\r\nbed-clothes were too light for this climate, and my stock of money had\r\nnow become so far reduced, that I could not afford to purchase additional\r\nblankets either for myself or my men. It was necessary to devote the\r\nlittle that I had to the purchase of a stock of provisions, for the\r\ncontinuation of our journey; there was no one here to whom I could\r\napply for money, and we were still far from any of the English Mining\r\nestablishments, where alone I could expect to obtain cash for bills on\r\nmy agents in Rio de Janeiro. The coldest months in this region are May,\r\nJune, and July; the hottest months are those of November, January, and\r\nFebruary, during which period the thermometer ranges from 74° to 88°,\r\nbut mostly only reaching 84°. During the early part of the warm season,\r\nthunder storms are very frequent, which always come from the north. For\r\na few days after our arrival, the air was clear and bracing, but a cold\r\ndrizzling rain soon set in, which lasted nearly a week. The houses have\r\ngenerally a small garden attached to them, in which I observed most\r\nof the common European vegetables, such as potatoe, cabbage, pease,\r\nlettuce, parsley, &c.; as well as many of the flowers that are ordinarily\r\ncultivated in the gardens of Europe. Some of the European fruit trees\r\nare also found in the gardens, such as the apple, pear, peach, fig, and\r\nquince. The city is abundantly supplied with excellent water, from\r\nsprings that take their rise in the mountain on which they are situated.\r\nThese streams are conducted into several of the houses, and many families\r\nare by this means supplied with one of the greatest luxuries that can\r\nbe enjoyed in a warm climate, at a very small expense; there are also\r\nseveral public fountains in different parts of the city.\r\n\r\nThe privilege of diamond washing, formerly a monopoly of the government,\r\nis now accessible to any individual who chooses to risk his time and\r\ncapital in this labour, a privilege only conceded since Brazil has\r\ndeclared its independence; all that is required is that the adventurer\r\nshould give notice to the Camara municipal, of the exact spot where he\r\nintends working, a notice demanded in order to protect some of the virgin\r\ntracts still preserved as royal property. The greater portion of the\r\ninhabitants of the Cidade Diamantina who possess a few slaves, employ\r\nthem in the washings, which are generally chosen in places where the\r\nCascalho is near the surface, and near the beds of the little mountain\r\nstreams, which are so numerous in the adjoining locality. Many free\r\nblacks also work on their own account, and thus obtain a precarious\r\nlivelihood. The persons engaged in these adventures are generally a\r\nvery improvident race, for even those who carry on the most extensive\r\nServiços, as the workings are called, often run deeply in debt after a\r\nrich washing has been exhausted, before they succeed in finding another\r\nproductive spot. I was assured by one of the most extensive miners in the\r\ndistrict, that the excitement produced by this kind of life is like that\r\nof a gambler: whoever enters upon it, never renounces it. The district\r\nwhich gives rise to this curious source of industry, is comprised within\r\nthe space of fourteen leagues square, and it is beneath the mark to state\r\nthat 10,000 individuals subsist entirely upon the product of diamonds and\r\ngold extracted from its soil. It is not, however, so much the miners as\r\nthe shopkeepers who reap the greater share of profit from this source of\r\nindustry, all of whom trade more or less in diamonds and gold-dust, which\r\nthey take from the miners in exchange for the supply of their own wants,\r\nand those of their slaves. It is rare to meet with a miner, who is not\r\nin debt to some shopkeeper, to whom he is bound to give in payment the\r\nproduct of his washings, at a lower rate than he could obtain, if he had\r\nthe advantage of offering them in an open market to the highest bidder.\r\nThe life of a shopkeeper, although not so exciting as that of a miner, is\r\none, however, less subject to risk; he generally soon grows rich, while\r\nthe poor miner struggles on in poverty, his greatest source of happiness\r\nexisting in hopes that are seldom realized.\r\n\r\nSlaves are allowed to work on their own account on Sundays and holidays,\r\nnot in the Serviços of their masters, but any where else, except on the\r\nroyal preserves; and it was told me as a remarkable fact, that most of\r\nthe largest diamonds obtained in this district have been found by slaves\r\non these occasions; it is not, however, an unfair inference to conclude,\r\nthat as the blacks are most expert thieves, some of those stones at\r\nleast have been stolen. Better opportunities now exist for more readily\r\ndisposing of diamonds thus obtained, than when the workings were entirely\r\nin the hands of the government. In those days they were mostly disposed\r\nof clandestinely to contraband dealers, many of whom used to hide\r\nthemselves in the mountains by day, and at night visit the huts of the\r\nslaves, to purchase the stolen property; even the shopkeepers were deeply\r\nengaged in these illicit transactions. The Juiz de Paz, who was during\r\nthe period of my visit one of the richest merchants in the city, owes his\r\nfortune to the following circumstance:—At the time Brazil still remained\r\nunder the dominion of Portugal, he was the proprietor of a small shop,\r\nand occasionally made a journey to Rio de Janeiro to purchase goods.\r\nOne evening returning from one of these long journeys, having retired\r\nto rest earlier than usual, he heard some one knocking at his door,\r\nto which at first he paid no attention, concluding it to be only some\r\ncustomer; but, as the noise continued, he at last arose, when he saw a\r\nslave who had come to offer a large diamond for sale, that weighed about\r\ntwo pennyweights and a third. The price asked for it was six hundred\r\nmil-reis, at that time equal to about £180 sterling; but not having so\r\nmuch money in his possession at the moment, he was obliged to borrow some\r\nfor the occasion. Early next morning he set off on his return to Rio de\r\nJaneiro with his purchase, stating to his friends that he had forgotten\r\nsome important business, which could only be settled by his presence.\r\nOn reaching the capital, he found it necessary to use great caution in\r\nendeavouring to dispose of his prize, as all trade in diamonds was at\r\nthat time contraband, any one found dealing in them being condemned to\r\nten years’ transportation to Angola, on the coast of Africa, his property\r\nbeing at the same confiscated, and sold for the benefit of government. At\r\nlast he was prevailed upon to dispose of it for 20,000 mil-reis, about\r\n£6,000, which amount was paid to him in hard dollars; never having seen\r\nso large a sum of money, he was perfectly astonished at its amount when\r\nit was brought to him, and after regarding it for some time, he asked\r\nwith great simplicity if it all belonged to him. Shortly afterwards,\r\nthe individual who bought the diamond sold it for 40,000 mil-reis, and\r\nwhen the Juiz learned its great value, and found that he might have sold\r\nit for at least a third more than he received, his mortification it is\r\nsaid was so great as to affect his mind. He has long, however, recovered\r\nfrom his chagrin, and is now one of the most active, as well as the most\r\nextensive, gold and diamond merchants in the district.\r\n\r\nThe temperate climate enjoyed by the inhabitants of this part of the\r\ncountry, renders them more healthy than those who live in the Sertão; the\r\nwomen are the most beautiful I met with in Brazil, and the men are also\r\na finer race than those of the low countries, many of them having more\r\nthe appearance of Europeans, than of inhabitants of a tropical climate.\r\nThe diseases most common here are those induced by sudden variations\r\nof temperature, such as colds and inflammatory complaints; the slaves\r\nwho are constantly working up to their knees in water, are subject to\r\nrheumatism; their diet, which is not of the most nutritious nature,\r\nconsists chiefly of boiled French beans and Indian corn meal (fubá),\r\nwhich, with the addition of hot water, is made into a thick paste, called\r\nAngú; this gives rise to general debility, particularly in those addicted\r\nto the immoderate use of rum. It is not the slaves only who are given to\r\nthis vice, but whites of both sexes, in almost all classes of society,\r\nindulge in it to a great extent; this is in some degree manifest, from\r\nthe very great quantity of that spirit daily brought to market, for it is\r\nsaid, that for every troop that enters the city with provisions, another\r\narrives with rum from the sugar plantations in the low countries. I must\r\nconfess that I saw but few instances of intoxication in the streets,\r\nexcept among persons of colour.\r\n\r\nAs I arrived in the city without letters of introduction, I made very few\r\nacquaintances among the inhabitants. During my stay, however, I received\r\ngreat kindness from Senhor Antonio Gomez de Carvalho, the Juiz de Paz,\r\nand Major Luiz José de Figueredo, the President of the Camara Municipal,\r\nboth of whom called on me the day after we reached the city. M. Auguste\r\nde St. Hilaire, who visited these provinces in 1817, speaks in high terms\r\nof the great hospitality of the inhabitants of Minas Geräes, but they do\r\nnot now appear disposed to treat foreigners with the same familiarity\r\nas formerly; this may be attributed to their great intercourse with\r\nEuropeans, particularly since the introduction of English mining\r\ncompanies, which has greatly tended to alter their character. In one\r\nof the houses where I occasionally visited, I met with Portuguese\r\ntranslations of Sir Walter Scott’s ‘Ivanhoe’ and ‘Guy Mannering,’ They\r\nhad been sent from Rio de Janeiro to one of the daughters of the family\r\nby whom they had been read with the greatest admiration; she had received\r\nan excellent education, and composed verses fluently. I was rather\r\nsurprised when informed that neither a bookseller’s shop nor a library\r\nexisted in the city.\r\n\r\nDuring my residence in this place, news arrived that produced a great\r\nsensation; the young Emperor, Don Pedro the Second, had been called\r\nupon to assume the reins of government, contrary to the wish of the\r\nregent, before he had attained the age provided by the Legislature; a\r\nproceeding that seemed to be highly approved of by the greater part of\r\nthe inhabitants, and rejoicings were consequently made on the occasion.\r\nIn the afternoon, high mass was celebrated in the Matriz church, at\r\nwhich were present all the members of the town council, as well as the\r\nwhole body of the national guard. In the evening there was a general\r\nillumination, and the national guard, after firing several volleys in\r\nfront of the house of the commandant, paraded through the principal\r\nstreets, with the band playing, accompanied with the town council, and\r\nall the principal inhabitants of the city. I walked along with the\r\ncouncil, having been invited to do so by the president, and had thus\r\na good opportunity of witnessing the whole proceedings; every now and\r\nthen a halt was made before the house of some respectable citizen,\r\nwhere generally five or six persons recited verses, composed during the\r\nday in honour of the occasion, while the ladies of the house, from the\r\nbalconies, were showering down flowers perfumed with Eau de Cologne;\r\nand occasionally the crowd below was honoured by a song from one of\r\nthe fair ones. This was repeated for three successive nights; many of\r\nthe verses produced on this occasion were extremely appropriate, but\r\na greater part consisted of the most fulsome adulation of the young\r\nEmperor, which was perhaps as unmeaning and ephemeral, as that bestowed\r\non his father, who when he proclaimed the independence of Brazil,\r\nreceived honours from these same people, little short of those bestowed\r\non a Deity, but after a propitious reign of ten years, was suffered to\r\nabdicate in favour of his infant son, without any expression of regret\r\non their part. On the contrary, they appeared to rejoice in a measure\r\nthat tended to the consummation of those republican views, which at\r\nthat period seemed likely to draw the Empire into one general vortex of\r\nanarchy and confusion. Happily, however, for the country, the greater\r\nportion of the community had the good sense to resume its attachment\r\nto those monarchical institutions that seem well adapted to the habits\r\nand manners of the Brazilian people, and I had now the good fortune to\r\nwitness the exuberant effusions of an enthusiasm, which I hope will prove\r\nmore lasting than that exhibited by them on a former occasion towards the\r\nillustrious founder of the Brazilian Empire.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived in the Cidade Diamantina, my horses were in bad\r\ncondition, owing to the long and fatiguing journey they had just\r\naccomplished, and the bad pastures on which they had latterly been\r\nobliged to feed. I found, however, to my regret, that the pasturage here\r\nwas still worse, and I feared that by the time I was ready to leave, they\r\nwould not be in a condition to resume the journey. The only pastures here\r\nare to be found on the top of the Serra above the city, in a region very\r\narid, and particularly cold at this season, whence indeed it derives its\r\nname of the Serro do Frio. Although they were fed twice a day with Indian\r\ncorn, they grew thinner and weaker after the setting in of the cold\r\nrain, so that notwithstanding all our care and attention, eight of them\r\ndied in the course of a few days. Finding the remaining ten were totally\r\nunfit for service, I thought it better to dispose of them at once, for\r\na mere trifle (70 mil-reis), rather than see them die off one by one.\r\nThe person who bought the horses immediately removed them to the Sertão.\r\nAs this occurred at a time when my stock of money was almost exhausted,\r\nwith no immediate hope of being able to renew it, I was brought nearly\r\nto a stand; with the money I received for the horses I was enabled to\r\nhire a troop of mules to convey us to Cidade do Serro (formerly Villa\r\ndo Principe), which is ten leagues distant from the Cidade Diamantina,\r\non the road towards Rio de Janeiro, and having made the necessary\r\narrangements, I prepared for my departure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nCIDADE DIAMANTINA TO OURO PRETO.\r\n\r\n    Leaves the Cidade Diamantina—Reaches As Borbas—Passes\r\n    the Arraial do Milho—Tres Barras—Arrives at the\r\n    Cidade do Serro, formerly Villa do Principe—The Town\r\n    described—Passes Tapanhuacanga—Retiro de Padre Bento—N.S. de\r\n    Conceição—Description of an Iron Smelting Work at Girão—Vast\r\n    abundance of Iron Ores in this District—Reaches Escadinha—Morro\r\n    de Gaspar Soares and two other Iron Smelting Works and\r\n    Forges—Ponte Alta—Itambé—Passes Onça—Ponte de Machado,\r\n    where frost was seen—And arrives at Cocaes—Visits the large\r\n    Establishment of the Cocaes English Mining Company—The author’s\r\n    unkind reception by the Director of that Establishment—Reaches\r\n    S.

The road by which\r\nwe travelled is the high way leading to Rio de Janeiro, and is perhaps\r\nthe worst in the country, notwithstanding the great traffic here carried\r\non, not only to the capital of the Diamond country, but also to that\r\nlarge district to the N.E. called Minas Novas. The numerous ascents and\r\ndescents are very rocky and full of large stones, the last ascent, of\r\ngreater extent than the others, about a league from the city, leads to an\r\nopen flat grassy country, the summit of the Serro do Frio. To the left we\r\npassed some higher ranges, one of which is the elevated Serra de Itambé;\r\nit was a very arid desolate tract, the few shrubs which grew on it being\r\ntwo or three species of _Lychnophora_, called Candeia by the inhabitants,\r\nand the grotesque _Lychnocephalus tomentosus_, together with a few\r\noccasional clumps of _Vellozia_. Shortly before we reached As Borbas,\r\nwe gradually descended to a considerable extent, by a rocky path, and\r\nentered a broad valley, which, though more wooded than the plain above,\r\nwas still very arid in its appearance.\r\n\r\nAs some of the mules had strayed during the night, we were delayed at\r\nour encampment till near noon on the following day; this was not at\r\nall agreeable, for we were exposed to a hot sun, without any means of\r\nsheltering ourselves from its influence. As I had now no animals of my\r\nown, I was obliged to submit to the will of the tropeiro, who did not\r\nseem very anxious to proceed rapidly on his journey. We found the mode of\r\ntravelling in the southern provinces very different from that we had been\r\naccustomed to in the northern. Horses are seldom or never used, and only\r\none journey is made in the day, which, according to the nature of the\r\nroad, extends from three to four leagues. The troops, which often consist\r\nof as many as from fifty to one hundred mules, are very well organized,\r\nthose which are not conducted by the owner himself being entrusted to\r\nan Arrieiro or muleteer, who, mounted on horseback, follows in the rear\r\nof the troop. It is he who gives the necessary orders for its starting\r\nand halting, looks to the condition of the pack saddles, and takes care\r\nthe loads are well balanced, as otherwise they would gall the backs of\r\nthe animals; it is also part of his business to examine the feet of the\r\nmules, when the troop halts, to ascertain the state of their shoes,\r\nand replace those which have been lost; the situation of Arrieiro is\r\ngenerally held by a free mulatto, and to him also the sale and purchase\r\nof goods is often entrusted. The roads in Brazil are so narrow that the\r\nanimals are obliged to go singly, one before the other, and so much are\r\nthey accustomed to this, that even when the road is broad enough for many\r\nto go abreast, they still persist in the habit they have acquired of\r\nfollowing one another. The troop is subdivided into divisions (lotes) of\r\nseven mules each, which are separately managed by a driver (tocrado), who\r\ngoes on foot, and is generally a negro. From As Borbas we made a journey\r\nof about three leagues and a half, through a hilly, rocky, uninteresting\r\ncountry, and arrived at a place called Tres Barras. Shortly before\r\nreaching it we passed the Arraial de Milho Verde, but at a short distance\r\nto the south, at a place called Váo, we crossed a small river over an old\r\nhalf-rotten wooden bridge. At this place there are a few poor looking\r\nhouses, the owners of which are principally diamond washers; one of them\r\nshowed me a few diamonds, all of which were very small, and not nearly\r\nequal in colour to those found near the Cidade Diamantina; one was jet\r\nblack, a colour that not unfrequently occurs.\r\n\r\nLeaving Tres Barras, another journey of three leagues and a half brought\r\nus to the Cidade do Serro. The road leads through a hilly undulating\r\ncountry, evidently much lower than that in the Diamond district which we\r\nleft behind at Tres Barras; it had now lost its barren rocky appearance,\r\nthe greater part of the rounded hills being wooded to their tops, and\r\noccasionally houses and plantations were to be seen in the hollows. In\r\nplace of the gravelly soil which exists in the Diamond district, the red\r\nargillaceous ferruginous clay, so common in the country, again made its\r\nappearance. We came in sight of the city when about a league distant from\r\nit, and although much smaller than the Cidade Diamantina, its elevated\r\nsituation gives it quite as striking an appearance. Like it, the greater\r\npart of the Cidade do Serro is built on the slope of a hill, which,\r\nhowever, is of less elevation, and the houses are not so closely crowded\r\ntogether. At this place I parted with the tropeiro who brought us from\r\nthe Cidade Diamantina, and as there was no inn of any description, I\r\ntook up my quarters in the public rancho, which is a large well-built\r\nhouse, expressly constructed for the accommodation of the troops that\r\npass and repass, three only of which are allowed to rest in it at a time,\r\nand the proprietor charges four vintims (about two pence) per night\r\nto each tropeiro for the accommodation. He has adjoining it, a large\r\nvenda, for the sale of provisions and Indian corn, and it is understood,\r\nthat the tropeiros are expected to purchase there what they require for\r\nthemselves, their men, and their mules. At this rancho I met with a\r\nmuleteer returning to Ouro Preto, with his mules unloaded, eighteen of\r\nwhich I hired to carry us forward, and for which I agreed to pay him on\r\nour arrival there, 180 mil-reis, or about 22_l._ sterling.\r\n\r\nCidade do Serro, formerly known by the name of Villa do Principe, is\r\nsituated partly on the northern acclivity, and partly upon the ridge of\r\na hill which runs from east to west, and consists, principally, of one\r\nlong street, with a few others that intersect it; these are nearly all\r\nwell paved, and the houses are, with but few exceptions, white-washed. As\r\nin the capital of the Diamond district, almost every house has a small\r\ngarden, which gives to the city a very pleasing appearance, when seen\r\nfrom a distance. I remained here only part of a day, and had, therefore,\r\nlittle opportunity of gaining much information respecting it; it struck\r\nme, however, during a walk through its principal street, that it was a\r\ndull place. According to St. Hilaire, it contained in the year 1817, a\r\npopulation of from 2,500 to 3,000 inhabitants; it has a few good shops,\r\nbut the greater part of the respectable inhabitants are agriculturists,\r\nwho have their fazendas in the neighbourhood. Gold at one time was found\r\nrather plentifully in the argillaceous soil, particularly in a small\r\nstream which runs in the valley below the city called the Corrego de\r\nquatro vintems; it is now, however, nearly exhausted, and only a few of\r\nthe more wealthy citizens employ some of their slaves in search for this\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\nThe hills around the Cidade do Serro, are covered with a grass which\r\nthe Brazilians call Capim gordura (_Melinis minutiflora_, Nees ab E.).\r\nIt is covered with an oily viscous matter, and universally makes its\r\nappearance in those tracts, which have been cleared of virgin forest for\r\nthe purposes of cultivation; both cattle and horses are very fond of it,\r\nbut although they soon fatten on it, the latter get short-winded, if\r\nthey feed on it for any length of time. Martius considers this plant to\r\nbe truly a native of Minas Geräes, while St. Hilaire is of a different\r\nopinion; as it is now everywhere so common in this province, it is a\r\ndifficult matter to say which of those excellent botanists is in the\r\nright; all the agriculturists that I have spoken with on the subject\r\nagree with St. Hilaire, although they differ in opinion in regard to\r\nthe place of its original growth. It is only on the mountains, that it\r\nis found covering large tracts, and at present it is rapidly extending\r\nnorthwards. St. Hilaire during his travels did not observe it beyond 17°\r\n40´ of south latitude; but while crossing the Serra Geral from Goyaz\r\nto Minas, I met with it many degrees to the north of that parallel. T\r\nnoticed it only near houses, and there is little doubt that in the course\r\nof a few more years it will overrun that chain in the same manner that it\r\nhas done those of Minas. The seeds had evidently been brought from the\r\nlatter country by troops, which pass that way into Goyaz; it is not to be\r\nmet with at all in the Sertão. Another plant which makes its appearance\r\nwith this grass, and one of the worst pests which the Brazilian farmer\r\nhas to contend with is the _Pteris caudata_, a large brake similar to\r\nthat so common in many places in Great Britain; it is called by the\r\ncommon name of Samambaia.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Cidade do Serro, and passing through a hilly country, which\r\nis more thickly wooded, and contains a greater number of habitations\r\nthan that we had lately traversed, a journey of four leagues brought us\r\nto the Arraial de Tapanhuacanga, where we passed the night in the public\r\nrancho; a large troop of about one hundred mules had arrived there before\r\nus, from Rio de Janeiro, loaded with European merchandise. This village\r\nis situated in a hollow, which is surrounded by some rather high hills,\r\nthe nearest of which are covered with grass, a few solitary trees, and\r\nan immense number of the large clay nests of the white ant; while the\r\nmore distant are covered with virgin forests. At the time the village\r\nwas founded, gold was discovered abundantly in the neighbourhood, but\r\nit is now very nearly exhausted; it contains at present only about\r\ntwenty or thirty houses, the greater part of which are falling into\r\nruin, and the two churches are in the same condition. Below the village\r\nruns a small stream, in the bed of which a few miserable beings still\r\nendeavour to earn a livelihood by washing for gold. While in the rancho,\r\none of the men belonging to the troop brought in a handful of branches\r\ncovered with leaves, with which, after holding them some time over the\r\nfire, so as to render them brittle, he made a kind of tea for himself\r\nand his companions; from the fruit on it, I found it to be a species of\r\n_Symplocos_. The leaves of many other shrubs and trees are used in the\r\nsame manner by the inhabitants of Minas, under the name of Congonha;\r\nthose of the _Ilex Caraguayensis_, from which the celebrated Yerba of\r\nParaguay is prepared, are most commonly used.\r\n\r\nWe left Tapanhuacanga early next morning, and having accomplished about\r\nfive leagues and a half, we halted at a fazenda called Retiro de Padre\r\nBento, a large house built on the gentle slope of a grassy hill; our\r\nwhole journey, indeed, was through an open, hilly, grassy country, the\r\npasture being chiefly Capim gordura. In many places the ground had been\r\nturned up to a great extent in search after gold, but the workings were\r\nall abandoned; large tracts were likewise covered with the tall brake of\r\nwhich I have already spoken. One of the most common trees I observed was\r\na fine large _Hyptis_ (_H. membranacea_, Benth.) bearing great panicles\r\nof purple flowers. This tree is from twenty to forty feet high, and is\r\none of the largest species of the family of the _Labiatæ_ I met with in\r\nBrazil.\r\n\r\nAfter travelling about half a league next morning, we passed through the\r\nArraial de Nossa Senhora de Conceição de Mato Dentro. This village is\r\nsituated in a hollow, on the banks of a small stream, and is surrounded\r\nby high grassy hills; it contains about two hundred houses arranged in\r\ntwo long parallel streets, and is one of the most miserable looking\r\nplaces I have ever seen; many of the houses are falling into decay, and\r\nthose which are still inhabited, are not even white-washed, but are\r\nmerely covered with the red clay used in plastering them. The country\r\naround has a barren aspect, but as the hills are all covered with Capim\r\ngordura, it does not look quite so sterile as that around the Cidade\r\nDiamantina; they are, however, destitute of all those beautiful small\r\nshrubs, which render the mountains in the diamond district so interesting\r\nto the botanist. Except a few small gardens attached to some of the\r\nhouses, there are no signs of cultivation in the neighbourhood of\r\nConceição. At a short distance from this village the road passes over\r\na high hill, upon reaching the top of which we got into a cold dense\r\nmist, which was rolling down into the valley before the wind, but which\r\ndisappeared as soon as it reached a warmer atmosphere. We travelled\r\nin the mist for about half a league, and finally emerged from it by\r\ndescending the opposite side of the Serra. On this descent we met another\r\nlarge troop consisting of upwards of one hundred mules, part of which was\r\ndestined to the diamond district, and part to Minas Novas; the road was\r\nhere so narrow that our small troop was obliged to halt while the others\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nAbout a league and a half from Conceição, we passed a small iron work\r\nbelonging to a German blacksmith; it is situated in a most romantic spot\r\non the banks of a small river, the waters of which rush through a narrow\r\nrocky channel, and is surrounded by hills covered with virgin forests.\r\nThe proprietor of this establishment told me that he had been eighteen\r\nyears in Brazil, seven of which had been spent at this place. His furnace\r\nis a small one, making only a hundred weight of iron per day, but he was\r\nabout to erect another of equal size. The blasts for the furnace, and\r\nfor the forging fires, as well as the large hammer by which the iron is\r\nbeaten into bars, are worked by water. He had several men in his employ,\r\nmaking all kinds of iron implements used in the country, but principally\r\nshoes for mules, for which he finds a quick sale from the tropeiros\r\nthat are daily passing. He also manufactures a small quantity of steel,\r\nwhich he confessed to be of an inferior quality; there is abundance of\r\niron-stone in the neighbourhood, and plenty of wood to make charcoal for\r\nreducing the ore. The province of Minas Geräes is perhaps richer than any\r\npart of the world in iron; indeed, as St. Hilaire observes, it may be\r\nconsidered as inexhaustible.[19] In Europe iron ore is generally found\r\nat a considerable depth, but in Minas it is frequently met with near the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nFrom Girão, for so this forge is called, we went on another league, and\r\nhalted for the night in a public rancho at a fazenda called Escadinha.\r\nThe country during the latter part of the journey was well wooded with\r\nvirgin forests similar to those on the Organ mountains, and like them\r\nabounding in tree-ferns, small palms, and a large species of bamboo. It\r\nwas quite refreshing to be once more in such a region, after wandering so\r\nlong in the arid provinces of the north.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, after travelling about two leagues, we passed\r\na small village called the Arraial do Morro de Gaspar Soares, which,\r\ncontrary to the general custom in Brazil, is situated on the summit of a\r\nhigh hill. It is surrounded by other hills covered with Capim gordura,\r\nwhich, although it was then the end of the dry season was quite green,\r\nand presented a great contrast to the pastures of Ceará, Piauhy, and\r\nGoyaz, which in the same season are quite burned up. Here there was no\r\nsign of cultivation, although I was informed that at one time the whole\r\nof these bare campos were under culture till the Capim gordura took\r\npossession of them; new plantations have been formed at a distance by\r\nthe cutting down of the virgin forests, which in time will have to be\r\nabandoned from the same cause. Notwithstanding the richness of these\r\npastures but few cattle were to be seen grazing here. As we did not\r\nintend to stop at this village, and as the road passes along the foot of\r\nthe hill on which it stands, I had not an opportunity of seeing it more\r\nclosely, but it had a neat and picturesque appearance at a distance. On\r\nthe road not far from each other, we passed two small iron works; these\r\nforges were established by government while Brazil was still a colony\r\nof Portugal, and the greater part of the iron they produced was sent to\r\nthe diamond district for the use of the mines there; they are now in the\r\nhands of private individuals. About two leagues beyond this village, we\r\nfinished our day’s journey at a venda called Ponte Alta, which has a\r\npublic rancho attached to it. The country through which we passed was\r\nnot very interesting to the botanist; by the side of a little rivulet\r\nnear the rancho grew a fine species of _Vochysia_, covered with its long\r\nspikes of bright yellow flowers, and a _Rubus_, the fruit of which, when\r\nripe, is green, and has somewhat the flavour of the strawberry.\r\n\r\nFrom Ponte Alta, a journey of three leagues brought us to the Arraial de\r\nItambé; the road led through a hilly but rather well wooded country, with\r\na more varied general vegetation than any part I had passed over since\r\nleaving the diamond district. About a league and a half from Itambé, we\r\nascended a hill of considerable height; and after journeying about half a\r\nmile through a low wood, we entered on an open tract with a moist sandy\r\nsoil, which afforded me a large collection of very rare and interesting\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nThe Arraial de Itambé is situated in a beautiful valley, on the banks\r\nof a small river which bears the same name, and which we crossed before\r\nentering the village, over an excellent wooden bridge. The village\r\ncontains from eighty to a hundred houses, and a church, most of which are\r\nin a state of great decay; indeed, the aspect of ruin and desolation was\r\nmore apparent here than in any place of its size I have seen in Brazil,\r\nwith the exception perhaps of the Villa de Parnagoá, in the south of the\r\nprovince of Piauhy; the appearance of the inhabitants was equally abject\r\nand miserable. The valley in which it stands is surrounded by high gently\r\nsloping hills, some of which are grassy and rocky, while others are\r\ncovered with low woods. Beyond these hills, and about a league distant\r\nfrom the village in a westerly direction, a higher chain of mountains\r\nexists called Itacolumi; from the seven summits it presents, it also\r\nbears the name of Sete Pecados Mortaes; this range was once covered by\r\nforests, which about forty years ago were accidentally destroyed by fire.\r\nAs at the Arraial do Morro, the neighbourhood of Itambé presents no signs\r\nof cultivation, if a few small gardens attached to some of the houses,\r\ncontaining some orange and other fruit trees, be excepted. Formerly gold\r\nwashing was carried on to some extent in the bed of the river, but it\r\nis now found in such small quantities that the produce will not pay the\r\nexpense of the labour.\r\n\r\nFrom Itambé we went to a little hamlet consisting of about a dozen\r\nhouses, and a small chapel called Onça, the distance being about two\r\nleagues and a half. The ascent of the Serra from Itambé was very rocky,\r\nand the country afterwards hilly. One of the few plants which I met with\r\non this journey, was the really beautiful _Mutisia campanulata_, Less., a\r\nclimber with pea-like leaves, and large heads of bright scarlet flowers,\r\nwhich are gracefully suspended on long footstalks.\r\n\r\nOur next journey was very long, being a double day’s march, or about six\r\nleagues. The road led through an open, undulating, and very rich country;\r\nand we passed some large fazendas surrounded by extensive plantations\r\nof Indian corn; those parts of the country not under cultivation were\r\ncovered with virgin forests, in which I observed, for the first time\r\nsince I had left the Organ mountains, abundance of the Brazilian\r\ncabbage-palm (_Euterpe edulis_, Mart.). The sun was excessively hot all\r\nday, and there was scarcely a breath of wind stirring; in consequence\r\nof this I suffered much from a severe attack of headache. The place\r\nwe stopped at is called Ponte do Machado, where there is an excellent\r\nrancho; the night was clear and cold, and when the men went out in the\r\nmorning to collect the mules, the grass was covered with hoar frost; and\r\nthe dew which had fallen on the leaves of the shrubs during the early\r\npart of the night, was formed into small icicles; this was the only time\r\nI observed ice in Brazil, and the first time in their lives that my men\r\nhad ever seen it.\r\n\r\nFrom Ponte do Machado, a short journey of two leagues brought us to\r\nthe Arraial de Cocaes early in the forenoon, where we took up our\r\nquarters as usual in the public rancho, the village not affording\r\nbetter accommodation. Long before we arrived at this place, I had been\r\ninformed that an English mining company possessed an establishment in the\r\nneighbourhood; and I now learned that it was situated on a high Serra,\r\nwhich bears the same name as the Arraial, and only about a quarter of a\r\nleague distant. My stock of money was very nearly exhausted, and as I\r\nshould have to pay my tropeiro on our arrival at the city of Ouro Preto,\r\nfrom which we were now only eleven leagues distant, I determined to\r\napply to the chief commissioner of the Cocaes mine for some assistance.\r\nFrom Natividade, in the province of Goyaz, I had written to the house\r\nof Messrs. Harrison & Co., at Rio de Janeiro, who kindly acted as my\r\nagents during the whole time of my residence in Brazil, requesting\r\nthem to forward all my letters and parcels to Mr. Herring, the chief\r\ncommissioner of the San João d’El Rey mining company, and once at that\r\nplace I felt certain that all my wants would be supplied, as Mr. Herring\r\nknew me personally, having had the pleasure of meeting him in Rio,\r\nin the beginning of 1837; but we were still about thirty-six leagues\r\ndistant from the town of San João d’El Rey, at which place it was then\r\nmy impression Mr. Herring resided. Coming as I did from the ‘far west’\r\nof Brazil, I had of course no letters of recommendation to Mr. Goodair,\r\nthe chief commissioner of the Cocaes mines, yet I resolved to solicit\r\nfrom him that aid which a countryman of my own could only be expected to\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nAs soon as my luggage was all properly arranged in the rancho, I rode\r\nup to the mine, but found that Mr. Goodair was out visiting some of\r\nthe works at a distance, and was not expected to return for two hours,\r\nI therefore determined to await his arrival; and in the meantime\r\nI was invited to dine with Mr. Roscoe, one of the officers of the\r\nestablishment. This gentleman, who is married to an English lady, had a\r\nfine family of several little flaxen-haired children, and they, and the\r\ndinner, which consisted principally of roast beef and English potatoes,\r\nmade me feel as if suddenly transported to my own country. Shortly after\r\ndinner Mr. Goodair arrived, and after stating to him the object of my\r\nlong journey, I candidly informed him of the unpleasant circumstances\r\nin which I was placed for want of money, and asked him for the loan of\r\n£25, for which I would give him an order on my agents in Rio; by doing so\r\nI told him he would confer an obligation, not only on me, but on those\r\nunder whose patronage I was travelling, at the same time offering to show\r\nhim credentials, which I purposely took with me, to prove that I was not\r\nan impostor. These, however, he would not look at, told me he was sorry\r\nthat he could do nothing for me, but added, that as my agents in Rio were\r\nalso the agents for the Morro Velho mining company, perhaps I might meet\r\nwith some assistance there: “at all events,” he concluded, “the doctor\r\nthere is a countryman of your own, a Scotchman, and he, perhaps, may feel\r\ninclined to do something for you.” After giving me this advice, he turned\r\non his heel, and without even bidding me good day, walked out of the room.\r\n\r\nAs may well be imagined, my feelings were not a little hurt at this\r\nuncourteous treatment; it was quite optional on his part whether he\r\nwould let me have the money or not, but I certainly expected a kinder\r\nreception. I looked back on my long and painful journey of more than two\r\nyears’ duration, and my memory recalled the many acts of kindness I had\r\nreceived from people of the country who had never heard of me before,\r\nand I felt keenly the marked contempt with which I was treated by an\r\nEnglishman, and the only one too, to whose benevolence I appealed during\r\nthe whole course of my travels. My personal appearance might perhaps\r\nhave influenced him, for the necessarily limited wardrobe with which I\r\nstarted from the coast was now nearly exhausted, nor would the state of\r\nmy funds allow me to add to it. I was deeply sunburnt from exposure, and\r\nthe fatigue of long continued travelling, innutritious diet, and latterly\r\neven little of that, together with much anxiety of mind, produced by the\r\nevil which I here tried in vain to remedy, gave me, I have no doubt,\r\nno very prepossessing appearance. Had Mr. Goodair, however, been of an\r\nobliging disposition, a little enquiry would have satisfied him that my\r\nobject was not to deceive; the fact of my having arrived in the village\r\nwith four attendants, and nearly twenty mules’ load of luggage, and the\r\nexcellent credentials I possessed, carried with them sufficient evidence\r\nthat this was not the case.\r\n\r\nLearning from Mr. Roscoe, and Mr. Rigby, another officer of the\r\nestablishment, from whom I received much civility, that Mr. Herring was\r\nchief commissioner of the Morro Velho mine, which was only about eleven\r\nleagues distant from Cocaes, I instantly determined to go and ascertain\r\nif any letters had been sent up for me from Rio de Janeiro. I expected\r\nto have been able to examine the geological nature of the mine, but the\r\nreception I met with put a stop at once to my intentions. Mr. Rigby,\r\nhowever, showed me over the surface works.\r\n\r\nThe mine is situated near the top of the eastern side of the Serra de\r\nCocaes. In the year 1833, a lease for fifty years was bought by the\r\npresent company; the former proprietors had worked it previously for a\r\nlong period with much profit; in June 1834, the company began operations,\r\nand though these have been carried on with much perseverance, and at a\r\ngreat yearly expenditure, but very little gold has been extracted. At\r\nthe time of my visit, the money laid out on the mine altogether exceeded\r\n£200,000. The manner in which the mine was worked, formed a great\r\ncontrast to what I had previously seen adopted by the Brazilians; all the\r\nmachinery was put in action by water power, and it was a most interesting\r\nsight to observe how one very small stream of water, brought from a\r\ndistance of several leagues, was turned to so many useful purposes. In\r\nthe first place it was made use of to drive a saw mill, then descended\r\nto the mill where Indian corn for the slaves was ground into flour,\r\nthence it was conducted to the blacksmith’s shop, to work the blast for\r\na furnace, and the tilt hammer, after this it was led into a large\r\nvegetable garden for the purposes of irrigation, and thence conducted to\r\nwork a machine for drawing ore from the mine. Leaving this it descended\r\nto drive a large pumping wheel, forty feet in diameter; besides which\r\nit kept in action two stamping machines for reducing the ore to powder,\r\nanother machine for raising ore, a second forty feet pumping wheel, and\r\nlastly, it turned a wheel that worked a machine for ventilating the\r\nmine. The gold is found in a soft, friable, greyish-coloured, micaceous\r\niron schist, which is called by the Brazilians Jacotinga: the principal\r\nshaft is about fifty fathoms deep. At the time of my visit, there were\r\nthirty English miners, about three hundred slaves, and thirty hired free\r\nBrazilians, at work in and about the mine.\r\n\r\nThe village of Cocaes is not only the prettiest I have seen in Minas, but\r\nis also the most beautifully situated. It is built on the gentle slope\r\nand summit of a low hill that stands in the bosom of a semicircle formed\r\nby the Serra, which in some places is covered with virgin forest, and in\r\nothers is bare and rocky. Between the Serra and the village runs the Una,\r\na small stream, which, however, in the dry season contains but little\r\nwater. Everywhere along its banks, and even to a considerable distance,\r\nthe ground has been turned over and washed for gold; these operations are\r\nstill carried on. Far from exhibiting the ruin and decay, which the other\r\nvillages we shortly before passed through presented, the houses here\r\nhave all a neat appearance, being mostly white-washed, and surrounded\r\nby little gardens containing orange and coffee trees, bananas, &c. The\r\nchurch stands out conspicuously from all the other buildings, and around\r\nit are planted a few tall palms, which give to the whole place a truly\r\ntropical aspect.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the second day after our arrival, we left the Arraial\r\nde Cocaes; and I thought it very hard to be travelling in the famous El\r\nDorado, with scarcely a sixpence in my pocket, while judging from my\r\nfirst attempt there were but faint expectations of improving my pecuniary\r\nwants. Ascending the Serra de Cocaes by an excellent road, and passing\r\nthe entrance to the mine, we descended to the other side, and following\r\na nearly westerly route for about the distance of four leagues along the\r\nbase of the Serra, reached the celebrated Gongo Soco mine, about two\r\no’clock in the afternoon. About half way we passed through the Arraial\r\nde San João do Morro Grande, which consists principally of one long\r\nnarrow street. The country around it is formed of a coarse ferruginous\r\nsoil, that everywhere has been turned up in search of gold, but as it is\r\nnow nearly exhausted, very few of the inhabitants are engaged in that\r\nspecies of labour. Like most other villages that owe their origin to the\r\nauriferous soil in their neighbourhood, it presents all the symptoms of\r\ndecadence; houses that were built in times of prosperity are quickly\r\nfalling into ruin, and the few that have been more recently erected, are\r\nof a much inferior construction; near the centre of the Arraial is a fine\r\nchurch, still kept in good repair. On the road several English miners\r\npassed us on their way to Rio, from a mine which had been established\r\na few years before on the Serra de Candonga, between Tapanhuacanga and\r\nCidade do Serro, but which was now about to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nAs I brought a letter with me from Mr. Rigby at Cocaes to Mr. T. Baird,\r\none of the partners of a large general store at Gongo Soco, and as I was\r\nmost kindly received by him, I found myself more comfortably situated\r\nthan at Cocaes. The whole of the houses at this place belong to the\r\ncompany, and it is undoubtedly one of the prettiest little villages\r\nin the province. The situation in which it is placed adds much to its\r\nbeauty, being a narrow valley bounded on the north by the high wooded\r\nSerra, that runs westward from Cocaes, and by a lower undulating grassy\r\nelevation on the south. With the exception of the large house occupied\r\nby Mr. Duval, the chief commissioner, the others are all of one story,\r\narranged in streets, isolated, and in the English cottage style, adorned\r\nin front with flower beds, and not unfrequently with palms and other\r\ntropical trees. Near the centre of the village stands a small but elegant\r\nchurch for the use of the free Brazilian workmen and slaves, employed by\r\nthe company. There is a catholic priest in the pay of the company, and\r\nformerly there used to be an English clergyman also; in this village the\r\nofficers and the greater part of the English miners reside. The mining\r\noperations are carried on about half a mile further to the westward, and\r\nthe houses of the slaves are situated near the works.\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Hammond, the chief acting commissioner, Mr. Duval being then on\r\na visit to Rio, and by the other officers I was kindly welcomed to the\r\nestablishment; and to one gentleman in particular I shall ever feel\r\ngrateful for his disinterested kindness, and more so from his being a\r\nforeigner,—I mean Mr. Virgil Von Helmreichen, the civil engineer of the\r\nestablishment. Having entered into conversation with me on the nature of\r\nmy travels and pursuits, he told me that he was well acquainted with Mr.\r\nNatterer, the celebrated zoological traveller in Brazil, who had often\r\nmentioned to him the awkward situations in which he had frequently been\r\nplaced, when in the interior, from the want of opportunity to draw for\r\nmoney; and his knowledge of this fact led him to enquire into the state\r\nof my funds, which I candidly explained to him, when he very generously\r\noffered to let me have as much money as would convey me to Rio, on no\r\nother security than my promise to pay it into the hands of his agent on\r\nmy arrival there. This obliging offer I however declined to accept, until\r\nI could ascertain at Morro Velho whether my letters had arrived there or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nHaving expressed a wish to Mr. Hammond to be allowed to visit the\r\ninterior of the mine, he at once kindly consented, and requested one of\r\nthe mining captains to escort me: Mr. Ferriar, a young gentleman whom I\r\nhad formerly met at Rio, offered to accompany me. Before going down, we\r\nwere taken to the room where the captains keep their mining clothes, and\r\nwere there obliged to change our dress for one of the suits used in the\r\nmines. This consisted of a large coarse flannel shirt, a pair of drawers\r\nof the same material, and a coat and trowsers made of coarse canvass, a\r\nstout leathern hat which fitted the head tightly, and a pair of strong\r\nshoes, which we put on our bare feet. Being thus accoutred, we were each\r\nprovided with two candles, one which was for immediate use was stuck\r\ninto a ball of soft clay which served as a candlestick, and the other\r\nhung to the button of the coat for after use. Fitted out in this manner,\r\nwe entered the mine by what is called the Adit level, whence we descended\r\nto the next level, seven fathoms deeper; and so on in succession, till\r\nwe visited seven out of the nine levels, or workings, of which the mine\r\nconsists; as the two lowest were full of water we could not visit them.\r\nThe distance between each of the levels is seven fathoms, so that we\r\nreached the depth of 294 feet, while the greatest depth is about 378.\r\nThe excavations in these levels consist of narrow passages or galleries,\r\nnot more than four or five feet wide, and five or six in height, driven\r\nin various directions through the Jacotinga, or micaceous iron schist.\r\nThis schist is of so soft a nature, that the passages as they are driven\r\nrequire to be strongly lined with wood to prevent their filling up again;\r\nand in many places it is quite astonishing to see how some of the thick\r\npillars of hard Brazilian wood, often a foot and a half in diameter, are\r\ncrushed and broken by the weight from above. The principal gold vein runs\r\nto the westward, but there are many ramifying branches. The vein is very\r\nunequal in richness, sometimes, as at the period of my visit, yielding\r\nhardly any gold, while at others it is found in what the miners call\r\nbunches, which are sometimes so rich that more than one hundred pounds\r\nweight of the pure metal has been taken out in one day. The rich ore is\r\nwashed and pounded up in mortars, while the poorer sort is sent to the\r\nstamping mills, and afterwards either separated by washing in the Bateia\r\nor amalgamated. Notwithstanding the superior richness of this mine, the\r\nmachinery appeared much inferior to that at Cocaes.\r\n\r\nFrom an excellent diagram constructed by Mr. Helmreichen, exhibiting a\r\nsection of the country in which the mine is situated, and which he kindly\r\nallowed me to examine, I have been enabled to make the following sketch\r\nof its geological structure. The Serra which runs from east to west, and\r\nlies to the north of the mine, is of primitive character, the mass of its\r\ncentre consisting of granite; upon the granite is imposed a thick bed of\r\nschistose and clay slates, cropping out at an angle of about 45°. Above\r\nthis lies another thick bed of ferruginous Itacolumite, having the same\r\ninclination as the rocks below; and immediately over this the Jacotinga,\r\nor soft micaceous iron schist which contains the gold, and which is\r\nabout fifty fathoms in thickness. Above the Jacotinga is another thick\r\nlayer of Itacolumite; and lastly, about half a mile to the south of the\r\nmine, a thick bed of a highly crystallized stratified limestone crops\r\nout at the same angle, and in the same direction as the other rocks.\r\nAbout half a mile to the eastward of the entrance to the mine, the bed of\r\nJacotinga narrows to a point, but towards the westward it appears to be\r\ninexhaustible, and in that direction all further mining operations will\r\nbe carried on.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 29th of August, I left Gongo Soco to visit the\r\nMorro Velho mine, which is distant about six leagues, in a N.W.\r\ndirection. I was accompanied only by a guide, having left all my men and\r\nluggage at Gongo, as I expected to be absent only about three days. The\r\ncountry between the two places is very hilly and barren, consisting of\r\nelevated grassy hills occasionally studded with a few small trees. In the\r\nhollows, however, there are generally patches of trees, forming those\r\nwoods to which the name of Capoes is given. About two leagues and a half\r\nfrom Gongo, we passed through a small straggling village called Morro\r\nVermelho, which was in a state of great decay; and about two leagues\r\nand a half further on a still smaller village, called Rapoza, situated\r\non the banks of the Rio das Velhas; we crossed this river over an old\r\nnarrow, tottering, wooden bridge without rails. On my arrival at Morro\r\nVelho about eight o’clock in the afternoon, I found to my great delight,\r\nthat all my English letters and parcels, which had been accumulating\r\nduring more than two years, were here awaiting my arrival, which had been\r\nexpected several months. Letters of credit had also been kindly sent up\r\nby Messrs. Harrison, for such sums of money as might be required by me,\r\nso that my mind was now quite at ease on that point. I sat up nearly all\r\nthe night reading my letters, but the state of mind produced by them was\r\nfar from happy, for not a few of them brought most unwelcome news, of\r\nthe death of near and dear relations and friends. The kind reception I\r\nmet with from Mrs. Herring, the lady of the chief commissioner, and from\r\nMr. Crickitt, the acting commissioner for Mr. Herring, who was then in\r\nRio with his two eldest daughters, will ever be remembered by me with\r\ngratitude. Rooms were ready to receive me, and instead of remaining only\r\none day, as I originally intended, I was prevailed on to spend about a\r\nmonth at Morro Velho, during which time my health improved rapidly. The\r\nday after my arrival, I sent to Gongo Soco for Mr. Walker, the men, and\r\nthe luggage.\r\n\r\nThe mine of Morro Velho is situated about half a mile to the S.E. of the\r\nArraial de Congonhas de Sabará. The village, which is very irregularly\r\nbuilt, is placed in a hollow, and contains a population of about 2,000\r\ninhabitants; but until the mines in the neighbourhood began to be worked\r\nby the English, the population was much less; here are three churches,\r\none of which has never been finished and is now falling into a state of\r\nruin. The mine is situated on one of the hills surrounding the valley,\r\nand had been worked by its proprietors for about a hundred years previous\r\nto its being bought by the present company. When St. Hilaire visited\r\nthis village the gold was considered as exhausted,[20] but it now yields\r\nperhaps more gold than any other mine in the empire. The present company\r\nfirst commenced its operations about 1830, under the superintendence of\r\nCaptain Lyon, the northern voyager. This mine is very different from\r\nthat at Gongo Soco, inasmuch as the auriferous vein occurs in a greyish\r\ncoloured clay state; the vein, or lode itself, consisting of a kind of\r\nquartzose rock mixed with a considerable proportion of carbonate of lime,\r\nstrongly impregnated with iron and arsenical and copper pyrites; its\r\ngeneral direction is from east to west, and it is about seven fathoms\r\nwide a little to the west of the central workings, at which point it\r\ndivides into two branches that run to the westward, while other two\r\nextend to the eastward; the more easterly branches are those that have\r\nbeen worked to the greatest extent. These ramifications gradually\r\ndiverge, and ultimately take a N.E. direction, running parallel to each\r\nother, at a distance of about a hundred feet.\r\n\r\nThe ore is first removed from its bed by blasting, and is afterwards\r\nbroken by female slaves into small pieces, about the size of the stones\r\nput upon macadamized roads, after which it is conveyed to the stamping\r\nmachine to be reduced to powder; this machine consists of a number of\r\nperpendicular shafts placed in a row, and heavily loaded below with\r\nlarge blocks of iron; these being alternately lifted up to a certain\r\nheight by a toothed cylinder, turned by a large water-wheel, fall down\r\nupon, and crush the stones to powder; a small stream of water constantly\r\nmade to run through them, carries away the pulverized matter to what is\r\ncalled the strakes, a wooden platform, slightly inclined, and divided\r\ninto a number of very shallow compartments, of fourteen inches in width,\r\nthe length being about twenty-six feet; the floor of each of these\r\ncompartments is covered with pieces of tanned hide about three feet long,\r\nand sixteen inches wide, which have the hair on; the particles of gold\r\nare deposited among the hair, while the earthy matter, being lighter, is\r\nwashed away. The greater part of the gold dust is collected on the three\r\nupper, or head skins, which are changed every four hours, while the lower\r\nskins are changed every six or eight hours, according to the richness\r\nof the ore. The sand which is washed from the head skins, is collected\r\ntogether and amalgamated with quicksilver in barrels, while that from\r\nthe lower skins is conveyed to the washing-house, and concentrated over\r\nstrakes of similar construction to those of the stamping mill, till it\r\nbe rich enough to be amalgamated with that from the head skins. The\r\nbarrels into which this rich sand is put together with the quicksilver,\r\nare turned by water, and the process of amalgamation is generally\r\ncompleted in the course of forty-eight hours; when taken out, the amalgam\r\nis separated from the gold by sublimation. In the whole process, the\r\nloss of mercury amounts to about thirty-five pounds a month, but up to\r\ntwo months before my visit, it was nearly double that quantity. For a\r\nlong time the gold dust was extracted from the sand by hand-washing in\r\nBateias, after the Brazilian manner; but the process of amalgamation is\r\nfound to be superior, requiring less labour, and extracting a larger\r\nproportion of gold. The zillerthal, or running amalgamation process,\r\nsimilar to that used in the Tyrol, has also been tried here, but was not\r\nfound to answer owing to the great loss of quicksilver. The roasting\r\nprocess has also been attempted, but although by this means the ore\r\nyields a much larger per-centage of gold, the fumes arising from the\r\narsenic were found to be so injurious to the health of the workmen, that\r\nit was abandoned. A ton of ore produces from three to four Portuguese\r\noitavas of gold; but the same quantity has often yielded as much as seven\r\noitavas. At the time of my visit, from fifteen to sixteen hundred tons of\r\nore were reduced to powder every month.\r\n\r\nAfter having rested about a week at Morro Velho, I started, with Mr.\r\nMonach, the surgeon to the company, to ascend the Serra de Piedade, which\r\nis the highest part of the great western chain in the Gold district.\r\nAfter travelling about three leagues in a northerly direction, we arrived\r\nat the city of Sabará, which, except the Cidade Diamantina, was the\r\nlargest I had then seen in the interior; it is situated on the north bank\r\nof the Rio das Velhas, at the eastern foot of the great chain already\r\nalluded to. From the place where the first view of it is obtained,\r\nit has a very fine appearance, its site being somewhat elevated, the\r\nhouses are generally large, and there are several fine churches; the\r\nold and new city together are about a mile in length, but the breadth\r\nis inconsiderable; the streets are well paved, and judging from the\r\nnumerous public fountains, it appears to be well supplied with water.\r\nIt was only about two years before the period of my visit that Sabará\r\nwas raised to the dignity of a city; the greater part of the inhabitants\r\nare shopkeepers, who trade with those of the Sertão to the westward.\r\nNotwithstanding its near approach in size to the Cidade Diamantina, it\r\nforms a great contrast with it in the stillness of its streets. The\r\nferruginous gravelly soil around it, and along the banks of the river,\r\nhas all been turned over in search of gold, but now very few seem to be\r\nengaged in that pursuit; the bed of the river is said to be rich in gold\r\ndust.\r\n\r\nFrom Sabará we went to Cuiabá, a mining establishment belonging to the\r\nCocaes Company, about two leagues distant; the road for nearly the whole\r\nway runs up a narrow and very picturesque valley, along the banks of\r\na small river. At the Cuiabá mine there were only two officers, Mr.\r\nRichards, the superintendent, and Dr. Morson, the surgeon, who is married\r\nto an English lady, by whom we were kindly received. The Serra de Piedade\r\nbeing still about two leagues and a half distant, we slept that night at\r\nCuiabá, and started next morning about half-past six o’clock, accompanied\r\nby Mr. Richards. After crossing the small river which passes the mine, we\r\nalmost immediately began to ascend the high country on the opposite side,\r\nand having travelled about two leagues, through a hilly, grassy country,\r\ndestitute of trees, except in low hollow places, we crossed entirely from\r\nthe eastern to the western side of the mountain chain, of which the Serra\r\nforms part, so as to reach the proper place of ascent; this we gained by\r\nskirting along the base of the Serra, but at a considerable elevation\r\nabove the plain below, through a bushy stony spot. The first half of the\r\nway from this place is pretty steep, and leads over a rough hard reddish\r\niron-stone tract, thinly covered with a few bushes of a species of\r\n_Baccharis_, and another of _Lychnophora_, while on the grassless stony\r\nsurface of the ground, there were numerous species of _Orchideæ_, among\r\nthem a beautiful _Lælia_ with yellow flowers, a very prickly procumbent\r\nspecies of _Cactus_, and numerous large water-bearing _Tillandsias_.\r\nLeaving this region we came upon a flat space covered with large blocks\r\nof micaceous rocks, the layers of which are very tortuous. The road\r\nthen winds along the western side of the mountain, close to the edge\r\nof some deep precipices, and finally ascends to a level spot, situated\r\nbut a little way below the highest part of the mountain. On the extreme\r\nnorthern part of this flat there is a small church called Nossa Senhora\r\nde Piedade. Upon our arrival there, we found a party consisting of half\r\na dozen women and two men, who had reached it a short time before us;\r\nwe soon learned they had come to fulfil vows which they had made some\r\ntime before. We saw large offerings of candles which they had presented\r\nto the church; and most of them had made promises to sweep the floor of\r\nthe chapel, for we observed that the women in particular cut small twigs\r\nfrom the bushes in the neighbourhood, of which they made brooms, and\r\nwith which they, one after the other, swept it, but in no very careful\r\nmanner. Leaving our horses near the church, we ascended the highest peak,\r\nwhich is of a very rocky nature, and covered with a vegetation of small\r\n_Orchideæ_ and _Tillandsias_. Ordering the refreshments we had brought\r\nwith us to this place, we sat down on the rocks to breakfast; according\r\nto Spix and Martius, this mountain is 5,400 feet above the level of\r\nthe sea. While skirting along the lower part of it, we felt very cold,\r\nin consequence of being enveloped in a mass of dense clouds which were\r\nrolling past us, discharging at the time enough of their contents to\r\nwet us not a little; I never, before this occasion, saw so distinctly\r\nthe vesicles of which clouds are formed. It was not till about eleven\r\no’clock, or nearly two hours after we had reached the summit, that these\r\nclouds began to disperse, and then we had a most extensive view of the\r\ncountry on all sides, which is of a very hilly nature, excepting on the\r\nwest, where the flat Sertão district presents itself. Notwithstanding\r\nthe magnificence of the view obtained from this point, the pleasure to\r\nbe derived from overlooking a populous and richly cultivated country was\r\nwanting. But few houses came within range of the sight; and the Villa\r\nde Santa Luzia, about six leagues distant to the south, is the only\r\ntown that can be descried, the others being hidden by the surrounding\r\nmountains. Two of the most prominent objects that strike the view, are\r\nthe Serras of Cocaes and Caráça, the latter of which is the highest, and\r\nabout eight leagues distant, in a N.E. direction.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of the mountain, close to the church, there is a\r\nsmall garden, which seems to have been well attended to in better times.\r\nI observed there a few stunted peach and apple trees, a few potatoes,\r\nand other European vegetables. The greater part of the garden, as well\r\nas the top of the Serra, in front of the church, is overrun with the\r\ncommon strawberry of Europe, and being then in fruit, we each obtained a\r\nhandful. Several other European plants have become naturalized, such as\r\nthe chickweed, _Cerastium vulgatum_. The church is kept by a middle-aged\r\nMulatto woman, and a dirty-looking old white man, dressed in the manner\r\nof a priest, who calls himself a hermit, resides there also. Except the\r\nfew vegetables which they cultivate, food comes all from below, and the\r\nwater they drink is obtained from the numerous _Tillandsias_ which crowd\r\nthe rocky parts of the Serra, and which in the bases of their leaves,\r\ncontain a large quantity of water, an ordinary sized plant yielding about\r\na pint.\r\n\r\nThe Serra is rich in plants interesting to the botanist, but not nearly\r\nso much so as the Organ Mountains, in the province of Rio de Janeiro,\r\nowing, no doubt, to its great want of moisture. From the upper part, I\r\nobtained two fine shrubs belonging to the natural order _Malpighiaceæ_;\r\na fine shrubby _Styrax_; a _Cassia_, about four feet high, which is very\r\ncommon near the middle of the mountain; a red-flowered _Gaylussacia_,\r\nand a _Gualtheria_, both abundant near the summit; a shrubby variety of\r\n_Drymis Granatensis_, several ferns, and a few mosses and lichens.\r\n\r\nShortly before we began to descend, the atmosphere became so hazy, that\r\nwe could see only a short distance; this was caused by the custom that\r\nprevails at the end of the dry season of burning the campos, as this\r\nencourages the more speedy growth of a crop of new grass, after the rains\r\nhave set in; it is also at this season that the wood is burned on the\r\ngrounds which have been cleared for cultivation. After a very pleasant\r\nday’s excursion, we reached Cuiabá about dusk, and having spent the\r\ngreater part of the evening with Dr. Morson and his lady, I was occupied\r\ntill near midnight in preparing the specimens I brought with me from\r\nthe Serra. On the following day we returned to Morro Velho. The mine of\r\nCuiabá is very similar in its nature to that at Morro Velho, but wrought\r\non a much smaller scale, and the ore moreover is not nearly so rich.\r\nDuring my stay at Morro Velho, I made many little excursions in the\r\nneighbourhood, and thus added largely to my collections.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 24th of September, after having taken leave of my\r\nkind friends at Morro Velho, we again resumed our journey. There is a\r\ndirect road from this place to the city of Ouro Preto, the capital of the\r\nprovince of Minas, through which I wished to pass, but part of my luggage\r\nhaving been sent on from Cocaes to a village called San Caetano, situated\r\nabout three leagues below the city of Marianna, I was obliged to proceed\r\nthere first. It was my intention to return to Gongo Soco by the way I had\r\ncome, but the day before we left, information reached Morro Velho, that\r\nthe wooden bridge over the Rio das Velhas, at Rapoza, had fallen down. We\r\nwere therefore obliged to return by the way of Sabará, which increased\r\nthe journey about two leagues. We passed through Sabará without halting,\r\nand arrived in the afternoon at the Cuiabá mine, where we spent the\r\nnight with Mr. Richards, and started again next morning after breakfast,\r\nreaching Gongo Soco between five and six o’clock in the afternoon. Almost\r\nthe whole of the country between the two places, with the exception of\r\nthe Serra to the N.W. of Gongo, consists of bare grassy hills, a few\r\nsmall woods only existing in the hollows. Being then the end of the dry\r\nseason, the hills had a very arid and barren look, everything being\r\nburned up from the want of rain. The roads were covered with fine yellow\r\ndust, the _débris_ of the clay slate of which the hills are formed; and\r\nwe were nearly the whole way enveloped in a dense cloud of it, rising up\r\nfrom the horses’ feet.\r\n\r\nAt about half way between the two places, we passed through part of the\r\nVilla de Caeté, a miserable looking town of some size, situated in a\r\nnarrow shallow valley, running in a N.E. direction from the Serra de\r\nPiedade, the Villa itself being distant from it about two leagues. This\r\nVilla, like many others in the mining districts, has all the appearance\r\nof having seen better days, as it contains the ruins of many fine houses,\r\nas well as one of the finest churches that exists in the interior, and\r\nSt. Hilaire doubts even if there is one in Rio de Janeiro that may be\r\ncompared with it.\r\n\r\nOn the day we left Gongo Soco, we passed through the Arraial de San João\r\ndo Morro Grande, and halted for the night at a small hamlet called Barra,\r\nabout a league to the S.E. of it. The country around, as well as the road\r\nwe had passed over, was hilly, bare, and arid; a small stream passes\r\nthrough the village, the gravelly banks of which have been completely\r\nturned over in search of gold. Next day we made a journey of about two\r\nleagues; and about half a league from Barra we passed through the Arraial\r\ndo Brumado, a long straggling village in a state of great decay. Leaving\r\nthis place, we continued in an easterly direction till we arrived at the\r\nfoot of the Serra de Caráça, and winding along the hilly base of its N.E.\r\nside, we reached, shortly after mid-day, the Arraial de Catas Altas,\r\nwhich is situated at the foot of the Serra towards its S.E. extremity. It\r\nconsists principally of one long street, and like Brumado does not seem\r\nto be in a very flourishing condition. The hills around the village, and\r\nbetween it and Brumado, are covered with Capim gordura. At a considerable\r\nelevation on the Serra itself, there is a hermitage, called Nossa Senhora\r\nMai dos Homens. The building was begun by a Portuguese in 1771, who was\r\nstill alive, though above a century old, when it was visited by Spix and\r\nMartius in 1818; it is now converted into a theological seminary, but is\r\nsaid to contain but few pupils. This Serra was botanically explored by\r\nSt. Hilaire, as well as by Spix and Martius, and found to be very rich in\r\nrare and curious vegetable productions; I wished also to devote a day to\r\nascend it, but the weather was very unfavourable, as it rained heavily,\r\nand the upper parts of the mountain were enveloped in clouds.\r\n\r\nLeaving Catas Altas, the road takes a southerly direction, along the\r\nfoot of the Serra de Caráça; and after travelling about two leagues, we\r\npassed through the Arraial de Inficionado, another long narrow village,\r\nabout the same size as Catas Altas, and, like it, in an obvious state of\r\ndecadence. About a league further on, we arrived at the Arraial de Bento\r\nRodrigues, where we took up our quarters for the night in the public\r\nrancho. The road, on this journey, was far from good, being both hilly\r\nand stony; I saw but little soil fit for plantations, it being generally\r\nof a clayey nature, intermixed with a coarse ferruginous gravel, or the\r\n_débris_ of the schistoze rocks of the Serra; and everywhere this soil\r\nhas been turned up in search of gold, but with the exception of a small\r\nmine between Inficionado and Bento Rodrigues, I saw no workings being\r\ncarried on.\r\n\r\nAt about a league from Bento Rodrigues, we passed through a small village\r\ncalled Arraial de Camargos, which is situated among some hills on the\r\nside of a small river. We were now only three leagues from the place\r\nof our destination, San Caetano, which I was anxious to reach without\r\nfurther delay; but the road, which here passes through a bare hilly\r\ncountry, is bad, and the mules being only lately broken into work, we\r\ngot on but very slowly, from their either lying down or going off the\r\nroad. On this account it was about five o’clock in the afternoon when we\r\nreached the last house on the road to San Caetano, the distance between\r\nthem being somewhat less than a league. At this house, the tropeiro\r\nwished to remain for the night, a proposal I would by no means consent\r\nto, especially as it threatened to rain, and the house was so small, and\r\nso badly covered, as to afford but very indifferent shelter. He, however,\r\ninsisted on remaining, and would have done so, had I not threatened\r\nhim with non-payment, when, very much against his will, he resumed the\r\njourney, and about dusk we reached the Arraial de Caetano, where I found\r\nall my collections in good condition, in the house of the tropeiro who\r\nbrought me from Cidade do Serro, and who again agreed to take me to Rio.\r\nIn passing through a small forest, not far from the Arraial, I collected\r\nspecimens of three kinds of tree ferns, and added to my collection of\r\n_Orchideæ_ a pretty sweet-smelling _Epidendrum_.\r\n\r\nThe Arraial de San Caetano, which is small, and evidently poor, is\r\nsituated on the acclivity of a low hill on the north bank of a small\r\nstream which empties itself into the Rio Doce. It contains only one\r\nchurch, which if finished on the scale it has been begun, would be\r\na great ornament to the place, standing, as it does, on a height\r\nwhich overlooks the village. Gold washing in the bed of the stream,\r\nand along its banks, seems once to have been the chief occupation of\r\nits inhabitants, but that source of gain being now exhausted, they\r\nhave mostly taken to the cultivation of the soil much of which in the\r\nneighbourhood is well adapted for the growth of coffee, Indian corn, &c.\r\n\r\nThe tropeiro not being able to start for some days after my arrival,\r\nand making objections to go round by Ouro Preto, which I had a great\r\ndesire to see, I determined to make a hurried visit to that city alone.\r\nI therefore hired a guide, and started on the morning of the 5th of\r\nOctober. A journey of three leagues through a hilly and thinly-wooded\r\ncountry, brought me to the city of Marianna, the situation and appearance\r\nof which pleased me very much; it stands on the S.W. side of a broad\r\nlevel valley, on the gentle declivity of a rising ground which skirts\r\nthe base of the range of the Serra de Itacolumi. It is more compactly\r\nbuilt than the towns I have generally seen in Brazil, and as there are\r\nseveral fine and handsome churches, and the houses are mostly large and\r\nwhite-washed, the city has altogether a very noble appearance. In the\r\nsuburbs, and even in the city itself, many of the houses have gardens\r\nattached to them, planted with bananas, oranges, and the round-headed\r\nJaboticabeira, which with their different shades of green, contrast well\r\nwith the white-washed walls of the houses; in passing through the town,\r\nit appeared so quiet, that I could almost have fancied it deserted. In\r\nsome of the principal streets, I saw a few shopkeepers leaning listlessly\r\nover their counters, and on the stairs in front of the prison a few\r\nsoldiers keeping guard; these and an occasional black urchin squatted at\r\na door, were all that gave an idea of life in the city, which is said to\r\ncontain about 5,000 inhabitants. It is more a clerical than a commercial\r\ncity, being the residence of the bishop and the seat of a theological\r\ncollege.\r\n\r\nThe imperial city of Ouro Preto, formerly Villa Rica, is about two\r\nleagues distant from Marianna in a south west direction. The road, which\r\nis very good, gradually rises towards Ouro Preto; in many places along\r\nthe side of it there are planted at irregular distances wild fig trees,\r\nnatives of the country, which have grown up, and not only give a good\r\nshade, but recall to a European the roads of his native country. Near the\r\nentrance to the city, where the road has been hollowed out of the solid\r\nrock, many galleries are to be seen entering the hills; these are gold\r\nworkings which have long been abandoned, and some of which are now made\r\nuse of as pig-styes, by the poor people who live in their vicinity. About\r\nhalf way between the two cities, the road passes through the Arraial de\r\nPassagem, a small village, the inhabitants of which formerly subsisted by\r\ngold washings, but the mines being now exhausted, they occupy themselves\r\nwith the cultivation of provisions, for which they find a ready market in\r\nOuro Preto.\r\n\r\nDuring my short stay in the Imperial city, I lived in the house of Senhor\r\nJosé Peixoto de Souza, having carried letters to him from Morro Velho.\r\nHe is the principal merchant in the province of Minas, and possesses\r\nthe finest house in the city; the erection of it cost him about £4,000\r\nsterling, a great sum for a house in the interior of Brazil. He is a\r\nman of a very kind and obliging disposition, and being agent for all\r\nthe English mining companies, his house is the place where the officers\r\nbelonging to them put up at in passing through the city, there being\r\nno respectable inn in the whole place; nor is it only Englishmen who\r\nmake his house a rendezvous, his own countrymen sharing in like manner\r\nhis hospitality. During the three days I remained there, so many guests\r\narrived and departed, that it had more the appearance of an inn than the\r\ndwelling of a private individual. He began life as a simple washer of\r\ngold (faiscador), and is now the principal gold merchant in the province.\r\n\r\nThe country around the city is hilly in the extreme, and the rocks\r\nconsist of clay-slates, soft micaceous iron schist, commonly called\r\nJacutinga, and that hard iron slate rock, now known by the name of\r\nItacolumite, all disposed in layers that are much inclined; the country\r\nround is auriferous, and many workings exist in the neighbourhood. In\r\nthe narrow valley, on one side of which the city stands, runs a small\r\nstream, called the Riberão de Ouro Preto, which takes its rise in the\r\nneighbourhood; the bed of this brook consists of a soft kind of gravel,\r\nand in it the poorer part of the inhabitants gain a scanty subsistence\r\nby washing for gold. The operation is called Mergular, or diving, and\r\nthe people who work in this manner are called faiscadores; they are\r\ngenerally half-naked, and after raking away the larger stones from the\r\nplace which they select in the bed of the stream, they fill their flat\r\nwooden plate (Bateia) with the fine gravel and sand, which is purified by\r\nwashing in a peculiar manner, till at last the gold dust remains in the\r\nbottom of the vessel, from which it is transferred to a small leathern\r\nbag which is suspended from their middle; they are not able to make more\r\nthan about a shilling a day. The time they prefer is after heavy rains\r\nhave caused a strong current in the stream.\r\n\r\nAlthough the city of Ouro Preto is much larger than that of Marianna,\r\nit has not the same imposing appearance, not for the want of large\r\nbuildings, but from the irregularity of its site. The greater part of\r\nit is built upon the side of the Serra de San Sebastião, which forms\r\nthe N.W. boundary of a deep narrow valley. It is naturally divided into\r\nan upper and lower town, the upper being by far the finer; it contains\r\na number of handsome buildings, such as the palace of the provisional\r\ngovernment, which is a large and well-built stone edifice, standing on\r\none side of a square of considerable size, the opposite side of which\r\nis formed by the town house and prison, which is also a fine building.\r\nA little below these stand the barracks, which are the best I have\r\nseen in the interior; the treasury is also a good substantial stone\r\nbuilding, but the low situation, and the narrow street in which it is\r\nbuilt, do not allow of its being seen to advantage. The city contains\r\nsix large churches, the finest of which, Nossa Senhora do Carmo, stands\r\nin the upper town, not far from the prison house; the city is abundantly\r\nsupplied with water of an excellent quality, a fountain existing in\r\nalmost every street.\r\n\r\nThe population of the city is said to amount to about 8,000 souls; it\r\ncontains many good shops, but not one devoted to the sale of books. It\r\nboasts, however, of two printing offices, and four newspapers, two of\r\nwhich are ministerial, and two belong to the opposition. They are of\r\nsmall folio size, and their contents are almost entirely of a political\r\nnature. In the beginning of the year 1840, a college, a preparatory one,\r\nwas established by a law passed in the provincial assembly, in which\r\nLatin, French, English, philosophy, mathematics, and pharmacy, are taught\r\nby as many different professors.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile from the city there is a Botanic Garden, which is maintained\r\nby government, and principally intended for the propagation of useful\r\nexotic plants, to be given gratis to those who may apply for them.\r\nI found the plants principally cultivated here to be the Tea plant,\r\nCinnamon, the Jaca, Bread-fruit, Mango, &c. Several acres are devoted to\r\nthe cultivation of tea, of which a considerable quantity is manufactured\r\nyearly, and sold in the city at about the same price as that which is\r\nimported from China. The avenue leading to the garden, as well as several\r\nothers which surround it, are planted with the Brazilian pine (_Araucaria\r\nBrasiliana_), which adds greatly to the beauty of the grounds; these\r\ntrees were about thirty years of age, and bore abundance of their large\r\ncones yearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nOURO PRETO TO RIO DE JANEIRO, AND SECOND JOURNEY TO THE ORGAN MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n    Leaves Ouro Preto—Arrives at San Caetano—Passes Arraial de\r\n    Pinheiro—Piranga—Filippe Alvez—San Caetano—Pozo Alegre—Sadly\r\n    incommoded by a thunder-storm—Reaches Arraial das Mercês\r\n    Chapeo d’Uva—Entre os Morros—Crosses Rio Parahybuna—And\r\n    enters the Province of Rio de Janeiro—Passes Paiol—Reaches\r\n    Villa de Parahyba—Crosses the River Parahyba—Mode of Ferrying\r\n    described—Passes Padre Correa—Corrego Seco—Reaches summit Pass\r\n    of the Serra d’Estrella—Magnificent view of the Metropolitan\r\n    City, its Harbour, and surrounding scenery—Arrives at Porto\r\n    d’Estrella—Embarks for the City and finally arrives at Rio\r\n    de Janeiro—All the Collections brought from the Interior are\r\n    arranged and shipped to England—The Author resolves again to\r\n    visit the Organ Mountains—His departure for the Serra—Adds\r\n    largely to his Collections—Ascends the loftiest peaks of\r\n    the Mountains—Their elevation above the sea about 7,500\r\n    feet—Departs on an excursion to the Interior—Passes the Serra\r\n    do Capim—Monte Caffé—Santa Eliza—Sapucaya—Porto d’Anta—Crosses\r\n    Rio Parahyba—Passes Barro do Louriçal—San José—Porto da\r\n    Cunha—Recrosses the Rio Parahyba—Reaches Cantagallo—Visits\r\n    Novo Friburgo—Description of these two Swiss Colonies—Pleasant\r\n    sojourn in the Organ Mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days after my return from the city of Ouro Preto, we left the village\r\nof San Caetano for Rio de Janeiro, and having travelled in a S.E.\r\ndirection about two leagues and a half, we halted for the night in a\r\npublic rancho near a small fazenda. It rained heavily nearly all the way,\r\nand there was much thunder; our road was through a hilly country, the\r\nhollows only being thickly wooded; in marshy spots I observed some fine\r\nlarge _Talauma_ trees, which are the _Magnolias_ of South America, and\r\nwhose large blossoms are equally fragrant. The rain continued all night,\r\nbut towards morning the weather cleared up and allowed us to resume our\r\njourney. Besides the mules that were employed to carry my luggage, the\r\ntropeiro had many others loaded with coffee, an article which is now\r\ncultivated to a considerable extent in the province of Minas. Another\r\njourney of three leagues and a half, through a hilly, well-wooded, and\r\nrather thickly-inhabited country, brought us to the Arraial do Pinheiro,\r\na small village surrounded by gold washings, which, however, are upon\r\na very small scale. In the rancho, in which we passed the night, there\r\nwere two large troops, one of which was conveying coffee to Rio, and the\r\nother on its way thence with salt for the interior. The woods through\r\nwhich we passed reminded me very much of those on the Organ Mountains,\r\nnot only from their general appearance, but from the great similarity\r\nin the vegetation. Three or four beautiful kinds of tree-ferns, often\r\nreaching to the height of from thirty to forty feet, grew in humid shady\r\nplaces; and on the more elevated tracts were seen many large trees of\r\nan arboreous _Vernonia_, upwards of forty feet high, covered with large\r\npanicles of white flowers, which, along with the blossoms of a large\r\n_Myrcia_, perfumed the air with their rich odour.\r\n\r\nStill following a S.E. direction, we reached the Arraial de Piranga,\r\nwhich is about three leagues distant from the village of Pinheiro; this\r\nArraial, like many others we had passed before, owed its origin to the\r\ngold which existed in the soil of this neighbourhood; at one time great\r\nquantities were found here, but the workings are now nearly exhausted.\r\nThe population consists of about 1,200 persons, most of whom are in great\r\npoverty; it has a dull and deserted appearance, but at the same time all\r\nthe indications of former opulence; it contains three churches, and the\r\ngreater part of the houses are large, and generally of two stories, a\r\nmode of construction not very common in the villages of Brazil; many of\r\nthe inhabitants are now following agricultural pursuits. Our next day’s\r\njourney of about four leagues, through a country similar to that we had\r\njust left behind, but more thinly-wooded, brought us to a large fazenda,\r\ncalled Filippe Alvez. We were allowed to pass the night in the sugar\r\nmill, a large building open nearly all round; the mill was worked by a\r\nwater-wheel about thirty feet in diameter, which at times was also used\r\nto put in motion a machine for pounding Indian corn; the latter, which\r\nwas at work both by day and night, annoyed us not a little by its noise.\r\nLarge tracts of land near the house had lately been planted with Indian\r\ncorn and rice.\r\n\r\nFrom Filippe Alvez, we went on to a small village called the Arraial de\r\nSan Caetano, the distance being about three leagues. It is a small and\r\nmiserable place, and although it contains a few shops, I could find no\r\nprovisions to purchase, excepting farinha made from Indian corn. On this\r\njourney, I found a large species of _Equisetum_, the largest indeed that\r\nhas yet been seen in the recent state; it grew abundantly in a wooded\r\nmarsh near the road, and I measured one that was upwards of fifteen\r\nfeet in height, the lower part of the stem being full three inches in\r\ncircumference. Although of gigantic size, when compared with the other\r\nspecies existing at present on the earth’s surface, it is far from\r\nequalling those enormous remains, which are found in the fossil state in\r\nthe coal strata, and known to geologists under the name of _Calamites_;\r\nmany of these have stems as thick as a man’s body; indeed the difference\r\nin size between the recent species of _Equisetum_, and those which have\r\nexisted at a former period of the earth’s history, is about as great as\r\nbetween a stem of wheat and the gigantic bamboos of the East Indies and\r\nof South America.\r\n\r\nWe travelled on the following day about three leagues, through a hilly\r\ncountry, which in some places was well wooded, but the greater part\r\nof it consisted of large cleared tracts which had formerly been under\r\ncultivation, but were now every where covered with the large brake I have\r\nbefore mentioned; this fern is not, however, entirely without use, for\r\nthe young shoots cut into small pieces and boiled, or stewed with pork,\r\nare eaten by the inhabitants, and are said to be not only pleasant to the\r\ntaste, but wholesome. We took up our quarters for the night in a large\r\nopen rancho, near a fazenda called Pozo Alegre.\r\n\r\nAt this place we spent a most miserable night; about midnight we were\r\nawakened by a dreadful tempest of thunder, wind, and rain, which came\r\nfrom the westward. The rancho was open all round, and the end that faced\r\nthe storm was unfortunately that where Mr. Walker and I had slung our\r\nhammocks. When I awoke a loud peal of thunder was rolling fearfully right\r\nover us; my hammock was swinging to and fro by the force of the wind,\r\nwhich was blowing a hurricane, and we were soon completely drenched by\r\nthe rain, which fell upon us in streams from the roof. My greatest dread\r\nwas that the old shed would be blown down upon us, but it fortunately\r\nwithstood the blast; my collection of botanical specimens suffered very\r\nmuch, as the boxes in which they were packed were arranged in the middle\r\nof the floor, and this being considerably lower than the sides, it soon\r\nfilled with water to the depth of six inches; in consequence of this\r\nthe parcels in the bottoms of four of the boxes were greatly damaged.\r\nThe storm lasted for an hour with undiminished force, and as soon as it\r\nabated we struck a light, for our fire had been completely extinguished;\r\nthe water was quickly bailed out of the shed, and the boxes raised from\r\nthe ground; a fire was kindled with some difficulty, around which we all\r\ncrowded, for we were all suffering much from the cold; it now became a\r\nquestion how we were to sleep during the remainder of the night, as every\r\nthing available for a bed was thoroughly wet. For my own part I arranged\r\nsome pieces of wood, that had been brought in the evening before for\r\nfuel, alongside the fire, and although the bed thus formed was not a very\r\nsoft one, I contrived to pass the night tolerably well.\r\n\r\nThe next morning being still cloudy, without any appearance of the sun,\r\nI sent to the owner of the rancho to ask permission to dry my plants in\r\nthe mandiocca stove; and, as he returned word that I might do so, we had\r\neverything taken there in a short time. On our arrival at the house, he\r\nseemed to have changed his mind, from what cause I know not, for he told\r\nme very plainly that we might go somewhere else, as he would not allow\r\nus to enter his premises; I have seldom been so much annoyed as I was at\r\nthis conduct. This man, whose name was Major Domingos Josè de Barros,\r\nwas about eighty years of age, a Portuguese by birth, and said to be\r\nworth upwards of a hundred thousand crusados; he was of a most miserly\r\ndisposition, as indeed his whole appearance testified, his dress being\r\nold and of the coarsest materials.\r\n\r\nWe went on about half a league further, to a fazenda belonging to a\r\nson-in-law of the old miser, who was also a Portuguese, but altogether\r\ndifferent in disposition. He immediately gave me accommodation for my\r\nluggage, and the sun shining out brightly shortly after our arrival,\r\nwe lost no time in spreading out the collections that had been wetted\r\nthe previous night. We were again visited by a thunder-storm in the\r\nafternoon, which prevented us from getting more than half of them dried.\r\nAt this fazenda, where I received much hospitality, I remained the whole\r\nof the following day to complete the drying and packing of my collection,\r\nand next morning, a journey of about three leagues brought us to the\r\nArraial das Mercês, a village which consists of a single street about\r\na quarter of a mile in length. In a large square in the middle of it,\r\nare a few good houses of two stories, and the only church; this last is\r\nbuilt of large unburned bricks, and being unplastered, has a very mean\r\nappearance when contrasted with the white-washed houses by which it is\r\nsurrounded. The whole village has a much greater appearance of prosperity\r\nthan any we had passed on the road from Marianna: the reason is obvious,\r\nthe non-existence of gold in its vicinity. The country during this day’s\r\njourney was still hilly, and covered with virgin forests. We passed\r\nseveral fazendas, the houses of which were very ill-built and dirty,\r\nand very different from what I expected to find in this part of Brazil.\r\nNear these houses large tracts of forests had lately been cut down and\r\nburned, and the ground so cleared planted with Indian corn, which is the\r\nstaple article of food in the southern, as mandiocca is in the northern\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nDuring the four following days, we accomplished about fourteen leagues,\r\nand arrived at Chapeo d’Uva, at which place the road by which he\r\ncame, called the Caminho do Mato, or forest road, joins that of the\r\nordinary traffic which passes through the city of Barbacena, and the\r\ncampo district between it and the capital of Minas. Our route, on\r\nthese journeys, was still through a hilly country, and the roads were\r\nextremely bad, passing for the most part through virgin forests, the\r\ntrees of which, in some places, were very large, consisting principally\r\nof different kinds of _Cecropia_, _Vochysia_, _Copaifera_, _Laurus_,\r\n_Ficus_, _Eugenia_, _Myrcia_, and _Pleroma_. I also observed many kinds\r\nof tree-ferns and palms, the most abundant of the latter tribe being the\r\nslender cabbage palm (_Euterpe edulis_, Mart.), several of which we cut\r\ndown for the sake of the long terminal bud, which when cooked is equal to\r\nasparagus in flavour.\r\n\r\nAt Chapeo d’Uva we slept as usual in a public rancho, and from this place\r\nwe made a journey of about three leagues, and halted at a large rancho\r\nnear the village of Entre os Morros. The road was excellent, being part\r\nof the new line, then in course of construction, from Rio to Ouro Preto\r\nby way of Barbacena. About two leagues and a half from Chapeo d’Uva,\r\nwe passed the first toll-bar I met with on a highway in Brazil. All\r\nanimals, whether loaded or unloaded, pay here thirty reis a league, which\r\nis the sum also charged for foot passengers. The distance hence to the\r\nnext toll-bar is ten leagues, and the whole amount has to be paid here\r\nfor the distance to the next bar, which was then the termination of the\r\nfinished part of the road. The legislative assembly passed a law, three\r\nyears prior to this period, authorizing the provincial assembly of Minas\r\nGeräes to make new roads through the most populous districts, and a loan\r\nwas soon afterwards raised, of upwards of £40,000 sterling, to carry this\r\nlaw into execution. These ten leagues that I found completed in the end\r\nof the year 1840, were undertaken on the worst part of the Minas road,\r\nthe country through which it passes being for the most part low and\r\nmarshy. So great is the traffic on this route, that the amount collected\r\nat the toll-bars was at this time sufficient to pay the interest on the\r\nloan; and in the course of a few years it was expected that a tolerable\r\ncart-road would be completed from Rio de Janeiro to the capital of the\r\nMining district.\r\n\r\nShortly after passing the toll-bar, we crossed the Rio Parahybuna on a\r\ntemporary bridge, erected until a permanent one for the new road, which\r\nwas in course of construction, could be finished: the abutments are\r\nalready substantially built of stone, but the arch was to be of wood.\r\nOn the banks of the river I found a beautiful species of the genus\r\n_Petræa_, climbing among the branches of the trees; and in a marsh, at a\r\nlittle distance from the stream, a fine species of _Franciscea_, which\r\ngrew where the water lay about two feet deep; it was very plentiful, and\r\nliterally covered with its beautiful purple blossoms. On the third day\r\nafterwards, we passed the second toll-bar, and again crossed the Rio\r\nParahybuna, at the place where it divides the province of Minas Geräes\r\nfrom that of Rio de Janeiro. The river is much broader here than at the\r\nformer place, and there is an excellent bridge over it, consisting of\r\nseveral small arches; the abutments and piers are built with stone, and\r\nthe arches are of wood; the whole is roofed over to protect the wood-work\r\nfrom the influence of the weather. Shortly after crossing the river we\r\nhalted for the night at a little hamlet called Paiol. The country on both\r\nsides of the river is very hilly, and before we reached Paiol, we crossed\r\na rather high Serra, called the Serra das Abobras, which is composed\r\nentirely of gneiss rocks, large blocks of which often render the path\r\ndifficult to pass over. Before we reached the Parahybuna, the road sides\r\nwere covered with a beautiful species of _Bugenvillea_, which being at\r\nthat season in full flower, was a great ornament to the woods, the large\r\nrose-coloured bracts of its flowers rendering it a very conspicuous\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nOur next journey brought us to the Villa de Parahyba, which is situated\r\non the N.W. bank of the river of the same name, which we crossed here in\r\na boat. The mules were not unloaded, but were taken over in a large flat\r\npunt, which conveyed about fifteen at a time. A strong iron chain was\r\nstretched across the river, at the height of a few feet above the water,\r\nto which the punt was attached by a smaller chain with a ring on it, so\r\nas to allow it to run from one end to the other, and prevent the boat\r\nfrom being carried down the stream, which runs with considerable force;\r\nthe punt was then pulled over by a rope, an operation in which three\r\nblacks were employed. About four years before I visited this place, a\r\nstone bridge had been begun a few hundred yards from the ferry, but the\r\nerection of it was going on very slowly; the northern abutment and three\r\npiers were all that were then finished. The foundation on which it is\r\nbuilt is good, the bed of the river at this place being formed of gneiss\r\nrock, the strata of which are nearly vertical. At the ferry, ninety reis\r\n(three-pence) were charged for each animal.\r\n\r\nThree days after we passed the Rio Parahyba, we arrived at a large\r\nfazenda called Padre Correa, the distance between the two places being\r\nabout seven leagues; the road in many places was very bad, and the\r\ncountry still continued hilly and densely covered with virgin forests.\r\n\r\nThe fazenda of Padre Correa is situated in a hollow surrounded by bare\r\nhills; the building, consisting of the dwelling-house, a small chapel\r\nattached to it, the rancho, and a venda, form nearly three sides of a\r\nlarge square, in the centre of which stands a very large tree, a species\r\nof wild fig, which a little above the root divides into two stems of\r\nnearly equal size. On a height to the east of the fazenda, are seen\r\ntwo large rows of the Brazilian pines, which add much to the beauty\r\nof the place; a small river called the Piabanha, that passes near it,\r\nfalls into the Parahyba. An extensive manufactory of horse-shoes, and\r\nsuch iron implements as are used in the country, is carried on at this\r\nplace. Our next journey brought me once more in sight of the sea. The\r\nroad between Padre Correa and the pass of the Serra d’Estrella, which\r\nis a continuation of the Organ mountains, was then under repair; the\r\nworkmen were Germans, who lived in a small village by themselves: we\r\nalso passed through a small miserable village called Corrego Seco. The\r\ncountry very much resembles that I have elsewhere described, between the\r\nOrgan mountains and the Swiss colony of Novo Friburgo, being very hilly\r\nand covered with magnificent virgin forests. From the top of the pass,\r\nthere is a fine view of the country around Rio de Janeiro, and of the bay\r\nwith its numerous verdant islands. On reaching this spot, I stood for a\r\nlong time admiring the scene of my first labours in Brazil. My feelings,\r\non looking down on the magnificent view before me, were such as would be\r\nexperienced after returning to my native country, for everything brought\r\nto my recollection the remembrance of past times, and of kind friends;\r\nthe Sugar Loaf, the Corcovado, the Gavea, and the Peak of Tijuca, were\r\nrearing high their cloudless summits, as if to welcome me back to a place\r\nof civilization.\r\n\r\nThe most elevated part of this pass is about 3,000 feet above the level\r\nof the sea; the descent of the Serra, from its zigzag nature, is about a\r\nleague in length; it is well constructed, being paved with large blocks\r\nof stone, and is kept in excellent repair; as it was rather steep in some\r\nplaces, and the road was good, I preferred walking down it to riding.\r\nA little beyond the foot of the Serra we passed Mandiocca, the estate\r\nwhich formerly belonged to M. Langsdorff, the late Russian consul-general\r\nin Brazil, and celebrated traveller: it now belongs to the government,\r\nand has been converted into a gunpowder manufactory. The Estrella pass\r\nis much better than that of the Organ mountains, but by the latter the\r\njourney to Minas is shortened by about sixteen leagues. A little way\r\nbeyond Mandiocca we halted at a large rancho, whence, after having\r\narranged the collections that had been made on the journey, I started\r\nalone for the Porto d’Estrella, with the intention of embarking there in\r\nthe evening for Rio de Janeiro, so as to have a place prepared for the\r\nreception of my luggage, previous to its arrival. The distance I had to\r\nride was about three leagues, through a flat, generally marshy country,\r\nquite like that between Piedade and the beginning of the ascent to Mr.\r\nMarch’s estate.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon when I arrived at the village of Porto\r\nd’Estrella, and as boats can only start for the city after the sea\r\nbreeze has ceased to blow, I found that I had arrived much too early,\r\nand not having yet dined, I looked out for a place where I could procure\r\nsomething to eat. On enquiring of the lad at the venda from whence the\r\nboats start, I was told they were in the habit of preparing repasts for\r\ntravellers, and that if I wished him to do so, he would provide a dinner\r\nfor me. After waiting with no little patience for upwards of two hours,\r\nI was at last shown into a small dirty back-room, when a dish of fish\r\nfried in oil, and Perão, a kind of thick paste prepared from mandiocca\r\nflour, were set before me; but everything was so dirty, that very little\r\nsufficed to satisfy my appetite.\r\n\r\nNearly all the goods to be conveyed into the interior, are shipped at\r\nRio, in large boats called _Faluas_, and landed at this village, the\r\npackages being all of the same weight, so that they may counterbalance\r\neach other, when put upon the backs of the mules that are destined to\r\ncarry them inland; there is therefore much activity here, as a day never\r\npasses without the arrival and departure of several large troops. The\r\nchief articles brought to this place from the interior, are coffee,\r\ncheese, bacon, quince marmalade, &c. The village is a long, dirty,\r\nstraggling place, with few inducements to detain the traveller. About\r\nseven o’clock in the evening I was informed that the boat I had hired\r\nwas ready to sail, but I had no sooner got on board, than a heavy\r\nthunder-storm came down from the mountains, and put off our starting for\r\nan hour. The village is a mile distant from the sea, being built on the\r\nbanks of a small river called the Inhomerim; and so slow was our progress\r\nthat it was eleven o’clock before we reached its confluence with the bay.\r\nAt this point a very good inn exists, which, as I experienced on another\r\noccasion, affords very good accommodation. As the land-breeze was very\r\nfaint, the boat had to be rowed nearly all the way, and on this account\r\nit was about four o’clock in the morning before we reached the city. Not\r\nwishing to disturb any of my friends at so early an hour, I remained in\r\nthe boat till six o’clock, when I went to the house of Messrs. William\r\nHarrison and Co., and received from my old friends there a kind and\r\nhearty welcome back to Rio de Janeiro, after an absence of more than\r\nthree years.\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards (on the 2nd of November, 1840), Mr. Walker arrived\r\nwith all my luggage in good condition. Knowing from former experience\r\nhow ill-suited either an hotel or a boarding-house is for a naturalist\r\nto carry on his operations in, I determined to hire a small house; and\r\nin the district called Catumby, which is in the immediate vicinity of\r\nthe city, I found one that in every respect answered my purpose. Having\r\nfurnished it economically, I had my collections removed thither, and\r\nas they amounted to about 3,000 species, including upwards of 60,000\r\nspecimens in Botany alone, it took me about three months to classify and\r\nproperly pack them, previous to their being sent to England.\r\n\r\nDuring this residence in Rio, my time passed away very pleasantly, the\r\nagreeable society which I mingled with, making sufficient amends for\r\nthe solitude and privations of the three preceding years. The days were\r\ngenerally devoted to my collections, and the evenings were spent with the\r\nfamilies of some one or other of the many resident English merchants.\r\nI had also the pleasure at this time of making the acquaintance of Dr.\r\nIldefonso Gomez, a talented Brazilian physician, who, when a young man,\r\naccompanied M. Auguste de St. Hilaire on his first journey to the mining\r\ndistricts. His house, which is in the country, and only a mile from my\r\nresidence, was always open to me, as it ever has been to all scientific\r\nmen who have visited Rio. I likewise spent many agreeable hours with\r\nmy near neighbour M. Riedel, the Russian botanist, and companion of M.\r\nLangsdorff in his journey through the interior of Brazil, and we made\r\nseveral excursions together to the woods in pursuit of objects connected\r\nwith our favourite science.\r\n\r\nAs soon as my labours in Rio were brought to a conclusion, I resolved to\r\nmake another journey to the Organ mountains, being desirous of devoting\r\nmore time to the investigation of the botany of the higher regions of\r\nthat chain than I had been able to do during my former residence there.\r\nFor this purpose I left Rio on the 12th of March, 1841, and during the\r\nfollowing month occupied myself in making excursions on Mr. March’s\r\nestate. The weather was too variable to think of making a journey to the\r\ntop of the Serra, but by the beginning of April it became more settled;\r\nand having been joined by Mr. George Hockin, a gentleman from the house\r\nof Messrs. Harrison and Co., who had frequently accompanied me in my\r\nprevious excursions in the neighbourhood of Rio, preparations were made\r\nfor ascending the mountains on the 9th. We left the fazenda about 8\r\no’clock A.M., taking with us three blacks, besides my own servant; my\r\nold guide, Pai Filippe, was now too infirm to undertake such a journey,\r\nbut his place was filled by one of his sons. Following the path I had\r\nmade four years before, we reached, about four o’clock, the highest point\r\nI had attained on my former visit, and at this place, under the ledge of\r\na rock, we slept for the night; this being a very convenient and well\r\nsheltered spot, we decided to make it our head-quarters during the few\r\ndays we remained in the mountains.\r\n\r\nBesides specimens of nearly all the plants which I found on my previous\r\njourney, I collected on the ascent many that were new to me; two of\r\nthe most remarkable of these were a kind of _Fuchsia_ (_F. alpestris_,\r\nGardn.), and a very extraordinary species of _Utricularia_; the latter,\r\nto which I have given the name of _U. nelumbifolia_, has since been\r\npublished in Hooker’s _Icones Plantarum_, where a very excellent figure\r\nof it is given. Like most of its congeners, it is aquatic; but what is\r\nmost curious, is that it is only to be found growing in the water which\r\ncollects in the bottom of the leaves of a large _Tillandsia_, that\r\ninhabits abundantly an arid rocky part of the mountain, at an elevation\r\nof about 5,000 feet above the level of the sea. Besides the ordinary\r\nmethod by seed, it propagates itself by runners, which it throws out\r\nfrom the base of the flower stem. This runner is always found directing\r\nitself towards the nearest _Tillandsia_, when it inserts its point into\r\nthe water, and gives origin to a new plant, which in its turn sends\r\nout another shoot; in this manner I have seen not less than six plants\r\nunited. The leaves, which are peltate, measure upwards of three inches\r\nacross; and the flowering stem, which is upwards of two feet long, bears\r\nnumerous large purple flowers.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, after an early breakfast, we set out to\r\nascend that part of the Serra which appears from the fazenda house to\r\nbe the highest. This peak, which I had been prevented from ascending\r\nin 1837, was reached in the following year by the Rev. Mr. Maister,\r\nwho was then the English clergyman at Rio; and again about six weeks\r\nbefore our visit, by Mr. Lobb, an English gardener, who had been sent\r\nout by a nurseryman to collect seeds and living plants: we thus found\r\na path ready made for us. This part of the mountain is about 600 feet\r\nhigher than the spot we had chosen for our bivouac. Starting then from\r\nthis place, we made a descent into a wooded ravine in which the ground\r\nwas covered by the beautiful _Alstrœmeria nemorosa_, and many delicate\r\nferns, while the branches of the _Melastomaceæ_, and other trees and\r\nshrubs, were festooned with the climbing _Fuchsia_, brilliant with its\r\nscarlet blossoms. Then ascending for some time, through a well wooded\r\ntract, we entered upon a steeper portion of the mountain, overspread with\r\nbeautiful flowering shrubs, among which were several fine _Melastomaceæ_,\r\nfruticose _Compositæ_, a _Gualtheria_, some species of _Vaccinium_,\r\nand a handsome new _Escallonia_ (_E. Organensis_, Gardn.), bearing a\r\nprofusion of rose-coloured blossoms. The summit of this peak we found\r\nto consist of several enormous loose blocks of granite, covered with\r\n_Lichens_, small species of _Orchideæ_, _Gesnereæ_, and where there was\r\nany accumulation of soil, a large-flowered _Amaryllis_ (_Hippeastrum\r\nOrganensis_), now common in English hot-houses; the climbing _Fuchsia_ in\r\na dwarf procumbent state was also found here. Upon reaching the summit,\r\nwe erected a pole and flag in order to give notice to our friends below\r\nthat we had got up in safety; and immediately afterwards, by the aid of\r\na glass, we saw it answered by another from one of the English cottages\r\nnear the fazenda. The day was beautifully clear, and we had a splendid\r\nview of the surrounding country. On looking to the westward, however, it\r\nwas evident that we were not on the most elevated point of the range, as\r\nwe observed, about a mile distant, a broadly rounded peak considerably\r\nhigher; and we accordingly determined to ascend it on the following day.\r\nI here met with two very interesting plants, one a beautiful tree-fern,\r\nwhich proved to be the _Hemitelia Capensis_, a native of the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, which is a remarkable fact in the geographical distribution\r\nof plants, as tree-ferns have a very limited range; the other was a very\r\nhandsome herbaceous plant, about four feet high, with a woolly stem,\r\nand large leaves, not unlike those of a _Verbascum_, exhibiting large\r\npanicles of orange coloured flowers; it belonged to the natural order\r\n_Compositæ_, and as it proved to be a new genus, I named it after my late\r\nlamented friend, J. E. Bowman, Esq., of Manchester.\r\n\r\nEarly on the following day, we started to ascend the loftiest peak of the\r\nmountain before noticed, and found it to be a more fatiguing journey than\r\nthat of the previous day, in consequence of having to cut our way through\r\ntwo or three wooded tracts, of considerable breadth; the paths of the\r\ntapir, however, frequently facilitated our progress. Very shortly after\r\nwe started, we were agreeably surprised to find, in the lower part of\r\nthe valley we had to cross, a beautiful little stream of cool and limpid\r\nwater, descending from the more elevated parts of the mountain, and\r\nflowing towards the east; in many places there were pools considerably\r\nbroader and deeper than the general course of the stream, which, judging\r\nfrom the paths leading into them, had been formed by the tapirs that\r\ninhabit this portion of the mountain, where they can enjoy, undisturbed,\r\ntheir favourite luxury of cold bathing. This valley is somewhat less\r\nthan a quarter of a mile square, and is covered on both sides of the\r\nstream, but particularly on the west, with virgin forests, the trees of\r\nwhich are of considerable size, one of the largest being a species of\r\n_Weinmannia_. The soil appears to be of excellent quality, there being a\r\ngood depth of alluvial matter; indeed, in no part of Brazil have I seen a\r\nspot where a person, desirous of excluding himself from the world, could\r\nfind a retreat, at once so healthy, beautiful, and fertile, as this; here\r\nall kinds of European fruits and vegetables might be cultivated in the\r\ngreatest perfection; and the stream, besides furnishing a constant supply\r\nof the most delicious water, might likewise be made to work a small mill.\r\nPassing over a hill that bounds the western side of this valley, we came\r\nupon an open flat marshy tract, the greater part of which is covered\r\nwith a tall grass, about five feet high, growing in tufts. Leaving this\r\nwe entered another wooded spot, formed of trees of a much smaller size\r\nthan those before observed, and passed through it along the tracks of\r\nthe tapir, where I was rather surprised to observe that while the stem\r\nand branches of almost every tree were covered with the beautiful\r\nlittle _Sophronitis grandiflora_, no other orchideous plant was to be\r\nseen; beyond this, we met with no more wood; the vegetation consisting\r\nof various herbaceous plants, and a few stunted shrubs. From the wooded\r\nregion, the summit of the mountain is gained by a steep acclivity, on one\r\nside of which is a broad ravine, full of immense blocks of granite.\r\n\r\nThe summit of this peak we found to be very different from that we\r\nvisited the day before, consisting of one great mass of granite, flat\r\non its surface, and of considerable extent; the rock is for the most\r\npart bare, but some portions of the western side were covered with a\r\nvegetation of stunted shrubs, and herbaceous plants; among the latter,\r\nthe most abundant was the pretty _Prepusa Hookeriana_, the large inflated\r\ncalyces of which resemble those of some species of catchfly; on the\r\nvery summit, were seen many little excavations in the rock, full of\r\nexcellent water, and had we been aware of this, it would have saved us\r\nthe trouble of carrying with us a supply in bottles. The day was very\r\nfine, but a broad belt of clouds that spread around the mountain below\r\nus, prevented us from enjoying the extensive view on which we had fully\r\ncalculated. At mid-day, the thermometer indicated a temperature of 64°,\r\nin the shade, and I found that water boiled at a heat of 198°, from which\r\nI estimate the height of the mountain above the level of the sea to be\r\n7,800 feet. A register of the thermometer, kept during our stay on the\r\nupper regions of the Serra, and observed on the level of Mr. March’s\r\nfazenda, gave a mean difference of temperature between the two places, of\r\n12° 5´. Baron Humboldt estimates the mean decrement of heat within the\r\ntropics, at 1° for every 344 feet of elevation, and considers this ratio\r\nas uniform up to the height of 8,000 feet, beyond which it is reduced\r\nto three-fifths of that quantity, as far as the elevation of 20,000\r\nfeet; it has, however, been since found, that in general the effect of\r\nelevation above the level of the sea in diminishing temperature, is, in\r\nall latitudes, nearly in proportion to the height, the decrement being 1°\r\nof heat for every 352 feet of altitude;[21] this would give 4,400 feet\r\nfor the elevation of the highest peak of the Organ mountains, above Mr.\r\nMarch’s fazenda,[22] and as this is 3,100 feet above the level of the\r\nsea, we have for the total greatest elevation, 7,500 feet. We returned\r\nto our former resting-place in the evening, well pleased with our day’s\r\nexcursion.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 12th, at 6 o’clock, the thermometer indicated\r\n44°, the weather being very clear, and accompanied with a sharp breeze\r\nfrom the westward. On climbing to the top of the rock under which we\r\nhad slept, one of the most magnificent views I have ever seen presented\r\nitself. Towards Rio de Janeiro the immense bay, and all the country\r\nintervening between it and the mountain, were hidden from us, by a mass\r\nof snow-white clouds, spread out, apparently, about 3,000 feet below the\r\npoint where we stood; shortly after sunrise, this space appeared like\r\na vast ocean covered with foam, the resemblance being increased by the\r\ntops of the lower mountains rising through them, like islands; in the\r\nopposite direction, the valley in which Mr. March’s fazenda stands was\r\nalso obscured, in a similar manner, by clouds, giving it the appearance\r\nof an extensive lake, surrounded on all sides by mountains; but as the\r\nsun gained power, these clouds gradually dispersed.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, Mr. Hockin started again to visit the highest peak, for\r\nthe purpose of making a panoramic sketch from its summit, but did not\r\nsucceed, owing to the cloudy state of the atmosphere that surrounded it;\r\nI did not accompany him, as I preferred making a few lateral excursions\r\nin the vicinity of our encampment. Late in the evening we observed a\r\nphenomenon, often witnessed on the tops of mountains; large masses of\r\nclouds, in a continued stream, came rolling from the westward over the\r\ntops of the peaks, but no sooner had they reached the upper part of\r\nthe valley opposite our hut, than they disappeared, the vapour being\r\ndissolved by the higher temperature of the air that existed on the\r\nopposite side of the mountain; it is in this manner that a mass of clouds\r\nis often seen as if resting on a high peak, even when a strong breeze is\r\nblowing. On the morning of the 13th we bade adieu to our rocky dwelling,\r\nand slept that night in a little hut we erected in a grove of small palms\r\nand tree-ferns, by the side of a small stream, the sides of which were\r\nfringed with beautiful herbaceous ferns. On the following afternoon we\r\nreached the fazenda, after an absence of six days.\r\n\r\nIn order to gratify my desire of examining the virgin forests which exist\r\non the banks of the Rio Parahyba, I determined to make a hurried visit\r\nthere previous to my return to Rio de Janeiro. The Parahyba forms the\r\nboundary between the provinces of Rio and Minas Geräes, but only after\r\nit has been joined by the Parahybuna. On this expedition I was again\r\naccompanied by Mr. Hockin, and was glad to have so excellent a companion.\r\nWe left the fazenda on the 24th of March, and after a journey of seven\r\nleagues, arrived at a farm called Serra do Capim. We followed a new road,\r\nwhich was in progress of construction under the superintendence of Col.\r\nLeite, a wealthy planter, leading from Piedade, over the Organ mountains,\r\ntowards Minas Geräes, but it was then in a barely passable condition.\r\nBy far the greater part of the country through which we travelled was\r\nin a state of nature, being covered with virgin forests, abounding in\r\ntree-ferns and palms.\r\n\r\nThe fazenda where we rested belonged to a gentleman residing in Rio,\r\nbut the letter I carried to the manager of the farm procured us a\r\nhearty reception; corn was immediately ordered for our mules, and we\r\nwere shortly regaled with an excellent supper. We found our host to be\r\na kind and intelligent old man, who informed me that he had followed\r\nthe profession of apothecary for many years in Minas; like most of the\r\nfazendeiros in Brazil, he acts as physician to the hospital of this\r\nestate, so that he was glad of an opportunity of consulting me on most of\r\nthe cases under his charge. Next morning he would not allow us to depart\r\ntill after breakfast.\r\n\r\nOn leaving this place we soon passed through some of the finest forests\r\nI had yet seen in the province, and in the afternoon arrived at a large\r\ncoffee plantation, called Monte Caffé, the distance being about seven\r\nleagues. This fazenda belonged to a Brazilian called Brigadeiro Ignacio\r\nGabriel, to whom I had also letters of recommendation. Although we did\r\nnot find him at home, we were most kindly welcomed to the estate by\r\nhis lady, and Mr. Hadley, his chief manager, who is an Englishman, and\r\nwhom I had formerly met at Mr. March’s, during my stay there in 1837.\r\nThe estate was at this time only in its infancy, but it was considered\r\nto be one of the finest in the district, and although the trees were\r\nyoung, it was expected that they would this year yield 12,000 arrobas\r\nof coffee, of 32lbs. each. At the period of our visit, the berries were\r\njust beginning to colour, and the branches were bent down with the weight\r\nof their produce. The country here consists of low hills, upon which\r\nthe plantations are formed; these hills had previously been covered\r\nwith forest. There were about 200 slaves on the estate, 70 of whom only\r\nwere employed as field-labourers, the others being occupied at various\r\ntrades, such as cabinet-makers, carpenters, masons, blacksmiths, &c. A\r\nfew days previous to our arrival, about twenty young negro boys, recently\r\nimported, were brought up from Rio; they appeared to be between ten and\r\nfifteen years of age, and none could yet speak Portuguese. They were\r\nall active, healthy little fellows, running about laughing, playing,\r\nand seemingly happy and unconscious of the circumstances in which they\r\nwere placed. In justice, however, to the Brazilians, I must say of\r\nthem, after an experience of five years, that they are far from being\r\nhard task-masters, and that with very few exceptions, I found them kind\r\nand considerate to their slaves. The Brigadier had lately erected an\r\nexcellent saw-mill, which was driven by water-power, and he was then\r\nerecting a large stove for the purpose of drying coffee by artificial\r\nheat. The superintendence of this work was undertaken by a German, who\r\nhad resided for many years in the island of Java.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 28th we left Monte Caffé, and proceeded on our way\r\nto the Rio Parahyba, which was only about a league and a half distant.\r\nMr. Hadley accompanied us for about a league, and while passing through a\r\nsmall estate called Santa Eliza, which adjoins Monte Caffé, and belongs\r\nalso to the Brigadier, he informed us that about twenty years before,\r\nit was owned by a person who made use of the house as a decoy for\r\ntravellers to and from Minas Geräes, and who, as soon as they fell into\r\nhis snares, were robbed and murdered. His house is still standing, but is\r\nnow uninhabited; the trap-doors which he employed for these diabolical\r\npurposes are still to be seen in the floor. We shortly afterwards came\r\nin sight of the river, and reached the banks at a place where the stream\r\nrushes with great force through a narrow, rocky channel. We expected to\r\nhave been able to pass it here, but were told that we could not do so\r\nfor want of a canoe, and were advised to go a league and a half further\r\nup to a place called Sapucaya, which we accordingly did. The road for\r\nnearly the whole distance runs parallel with the river, through a most\r\nmagnificent forest, the trees being of great size, and in general with\r\nvery straight stems, often rising unbranched to a height of upwards of\r\none hundred feet.\r\n\r\nIn riding along I could not help feeling deep regret, that in these\r\nregions many square leagues of such forests were being cut down and\r\nburned, in order to make room for plantations of coffee. There are no\r\nmeans of conveying this fine timber to the coast, as the river, although\r\nof considerable flow, is not navigable for rafts, owing to its many rocky\r\nrapids. At this place, I observed the bed of the stream to be formed of\r\nthin strata of Gneiss rocks, cropping out vertically, and like the course\r\nof the river running from west to east.\r\n\r\nSapucaya is a small hamlet, consisting of a few houses of very recent\r\nconstruction, which owe their origin to their proximity to a new bridge,\r\nat this time in process of erection across the river, in connexion with\r\nColonel Leite’s new road to the province of Minas Geräes. We here found\r\na canoe, suited only for foot passengers; horsemen, we were told, seldom\r\ncame this way at this season, owing to the swollen state of the stream,\r\nand the rapidity of its current rendering it dangerous to swim horses\r\nacross. We were consequently advised to go another league and a half\r\nfarther up the river, to a place called Porto d’Anta. At Sapucaya we gave\r\nour mules a feed of Indian corn, but we could find no refreshment for\r\nourselves, excepting a few bananas and a little farinha de mandiocca,\r\nupon which we made our dinners. On the stems of the trees in the forest,\r\nI met with many fine orchideous plants, one of the most abundant, and\r\ncertainly the most beautiful, being the _Cattleya labiata_. The country\r\nbetween Sapucaya and Porto d’Anta, which we reached about dusk, was\r\nsomewhat similar to that observed lower down the river, but not so well\r\nwooded. At this place we were at length enabled to cross the river,\r\nthere being a regular ferry-boat established for horses, consisting of\r\nthree large canoes lashed together, planked over, and railed round. The\r\nriver here was about the breadth of the Clyde at Erskine Ferry, but the\r\ncurrent was much more rapid. The Barca, as the ferry-boat is called,\r\nwas rowed across, but, in consequence of the current, the boatmen were\r\nfirst obliged to ascend the river a considerable way before they began\r\nto cross. We found a very good venda on the opposite side of the stream,\r\nwhere we put up for the night, and where we had in a short time a very\r\nexcellent supper, and were provided with tolerable beds.\r\n\r\nNext morning after breakfast, we went on to a fazenda, called Barra\r\nde Louriçal, belonging to Colonel Custodio Leite, whom I have before\r\nalluded to, as superintending the construction of the new road, and\r\nwhom I had frequently met at Mr. March’s during my former stay there;\r\nthis place is about a league and a half distant from Porto D’Anta, and\r\nwe had again to descend along the banks of the river about a league,\r\nby a very romantic road that leads through a fine forest abounding in\r\nobjects of great interest to the botanist, as well as the zoologist;\r\nwe observed numerous monkeys passing along the branches of trees over\r\nour heads, particularly a large black howler (_Mycetes_), the females\r\nof which were carrying their young upon their backs. We then struck off\r\nto the north, and reached the fazenda early in the forenoon; we did not\r\nfind the Colonel at home, but one of his sons received us very kindly.\r\nThis is a very fine estate yielding annually about 10,000 arrobas of\r\ncoffee. On the following day we went to pay a visit to Captain Francisco\r\nLeite, a brother of the Colonel, whose fazenda is about a league and a\r\nhalf farther north. We were fortunate enough to find him at home, when\r\nhe showed us all that was worth seeing on his estate; he is a tall thin\r\nman, and although considerably advanced in years, is of a most active\r\nand lively disposition. He informed me he was a native of the mining\r\ndistricts, and began his career as a simple gold-washer, having been\r\nfortunate enough to acquire a little money, he left that occupation and\r\npurchased this estate, about twenty years before our visit, at a time\r\nwhen it was entirely covered with forest. He is now one of the most\r\nwealthy, if not the wealthiest individual in this part of the country;\r\nthe cultivation of coffee having enriched most of the inhabitants of this\r\nfertile region. His estate yields him about 11,000 arrobas of coffee; and\r\nalso a considerable quantity of cheese, sugar, and rum, which are chiefly\r\nsent to market in Rio de Janeiro. He was very desirous we should remain\r\nall night, but we were obliged to refuse his hospitality, having promised\r\nto return to the house of the Colonel, with the intention of resuming our\r\njourney early on the following day.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 31st we left Colonel Leite, and in the evening\r\nreached Porto da Cunha, which is six leagues further down the river; we\r\nhad to travel more than eight leagues, having mistaken our road. Some\r\nparts of the country through which we travelled were very romantic,\r\nparticularly by the side of the river, the banks of which were often\r\nrocky and well-wooded; the forests are, indeed, the most magnificent\r\nthat it is possible to imagine. We passed a few small houses belonging\r\nchiefly to coloured people, but it was only towards the termination of\r\nour journey that we saw one or two large coffee plantations. About three\r\no’clock in the afternoon, while we were passing through a very dense\r\ntract of forest country, we came upon a place about three or four acres\r\nin extent, that seemed to have been lately cleared, with a small house\r\nformed of stakes and palm leaves, standing in the centre. On arriving\r\nat the house, we found it belonged to an Indian family, consisting of a\r\nman, his wife, and four children. They were just collecting their crop of\r\nIndian corn, a good feed of which was readily obtained for our animals,\r\nbut we could procure nothing eatable for ourselves. At some distance\r\nbeyond this place, I found, in a rather open part of the forest, a\r\nbeautiful arboreous species of _Bugenvillea_, quite distinct from any\r\nyet described; it forms a tree from twenty to forty feet high, with a\r\nstem more than two feet in circumference; unfortunately I lost all the\r\nspecimens I collected, through the carelessness of my servant. In the\r\ndeep forests, I found many different orchideous plants upon the stems of\r\nthe trees, among which was the rare and beautiful _Huntleya meleagris_.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark when we reached Porta da Cunha, where we could find no\r\nplace of accommodation; we were first referred to a venda a little way\r\nfurther down the river, but on arriving there, we found it to be a new\r\nhouse in an unfinished state, and not yet inhabited, so that it offered\r\nno accommodation for man or beast. From this place we were directed to a\r\nsmall village about half a league still further down the river, called\r\nSan José, but at the same time we were informed, that about half way\r\nto the village, we should see a small fazenda belonging to an elderly\r\nwidow, who sometimes gave shelter to travellers; we accordingly made\r\napplication at this place, and were received for the night. The house had\r\ncertainly a very miserable appearance, but we were glad to find any sort\r\nof quarters. The old lady, whose name was Dona Custodia, was, however,\r\nrather suspicious of us, perhaps from our arriving at so late an hour,\r\nfor looking over the balcony, she asked us why we did not go to different\r\nhouses she mentioned; but, on replying that we were strangers, and had no\r\nacquaintance with those individuals, she then told us to dismount. Corn\r\nwas immediately ordered for our animals, and in a short time supper was\r\nsent to us, consisting of a little fried salt beef, and several dishes\r\nprepared from the Indian corn meal, which though a very poor substitute\r\nfor a meal, afforded us, as we were hungry, a hearty dinner and supper\r\nat the same time. Shortly afterwards, we were shown into our bed-room, a\r\nlittle closet with two camp bedsteads in it, on one of which a miserable\r\nblack man was sitting, who also appeared to be a traveller; the other we\r\nwere told was at our disposal, and we had no alternative but to make use\r\nof it; a hide was spread on the floor for the servant, and in this small\r\nroom, which was scarcely large enough for two persons, four of us had to\r\npass the night. To crown all, the roof was so bad that we might have\r\nstudied astronomy through it; and the window, which was not glazed, and\r\nwithout a shutter, looked into a pig-sty, by the inmates of which we were\r\naroused early in the morning. If, however, the accommodation was bad, the\r\ncharge made for it next morning was but a mere trifle, amounting only to\r\none shilling and eight pence in all, including, besides, a cup of coffee\r\nin the morning, and another feed of corn to the mules. I gave her about\r\ndouble the sum, with many thanks besides for her kindness, with which\r\nshe was not a little pleased. She had once, she told us, been in better\r\ncircumstances, in the mining district, but had lost her money in some\r\nunfortunate mining speculations, and had come down to this place with her\r\nson, to endeavour to gain a livelihood by making sugar and rum, which\r\nthey dispose of chiefly in the adjoining village.\r\n\r\nFrom Dona Custodia’s, we went on to the Arraial de San José, in the hope\r\nof getting a comfortable breakfast, but in this we were disappointed,\r\nas nothing was to be had there. We then returned to the Porto da Cunha,\r\nwhere we were equally unsuccessful, but were informed that a breakfast\r\nmight be had at a venda on the opposite side of the river. There is a\r\nferry at this place, which is in the hands of the provincial government\r\nof Minas Geräes, and a sergeant is stationed here, who levies the passage\r\nmoney, as well as the duties payable on such articles as are sent out of\r\nthe province; as it was our original intention to re-cross the river at\r\nthis place, we lost no time in accomplishing it, the conveyance being\r\nexactly the same as that at Porto d’Anta. When we went up to the venda,\r\nwe found, to our astonishment, that they could give us nothing to eat;\r\nbut the lad who kept the venda, and who was a most uncivil wretch,\r\nat last told us that he had some salt fish and rusks, which we might\r\npurchase, but that he would not cook the fish for us; this, however, we\r\ncontrived to do ourselves, at a fire which our servant kindled outside.\r\n\r\nLeaving Porto da Cunha, we went out in an easterly direction, it being\r\nour intention to visit a small town, called Cantagallo, which at one time\r\nwas a famous place for gold washing. Very shortly after we started,\r\nwe passed through a large coffee estate belonging to the celebrated\r\nBrazilian deputy, Carneiro Leão, and about a league further on, came\r\nupon the Rio Paquequer grande, down the south banks of which we went a\r\nconsiderable way through some fine forests. Towards dusk, while we were\r\npushing on without knowing where we might find quarters for the night,\r\nwe met a young man who had been out hunting, and by him we were informed\r\nthat there was a fazenda only a little further on to which he belonged,\r\nwhere no doubt we should be welcome to spend the night. We also learned\r\nfrom him that we were not on the right road to Cantagallo, although it\r\nwould take us to it, but by a worse and more circuitous route. Arrived\r\nat the fazenda, we were shown into a well furnished apartment, and\r\nimmediately after, the owner came to bid us welcome. Learning that we\r\ncame from Mr. March’s fazenda, he came up, shook me by the hand, when I\r\nrecognised him to be a Dr. Saporiti, who about a month before stopped\r\na night at Mr. March’s, on his way from the city: he expressed himself\r\ngreatly delighted to see us, ordered coffee, and told us we should\r\nshortly have supper. In the mean time, he introduced us to his lady,\r\nwhom we found to be more refined in her manners than the generality of\r\nthe wives of fazendeiros, no doubt from her having resided many years in\r\nRio de Janeiro. The young man who conducted us to his house, we found\r\nto be her son by a former husband. Dr. Saporiti is an Italian by birth,\r\nbut had been upwards of twenty years in Brazil. About ten o’clock we sat\r\ndown to an excellent supper, and altogether the evening passed away most\r\nagreeably, from the enlivening conversation of our host and hostess,\r\nthe latter in particular amusing us with the pictures which she drew of\r\nrustic life in the distant province of Mato Grosso, of which she is a\r\nnative. Next morning breakfast was prepared early on our account, as we\r\nwished to start in good time.\r\n\r\nOwing to the bad state of the roads, it was six o’clock in the evening\r\nbefore we reached Cantagallo, though the distance was only four leagues;\r\nthe country is thickly wooded, and in general rather level. On the\r\ndescent of a high hill, we passed through a large coffee plantation which\r\nhad been abandoned, in consequence of the cold being too great to allow\r\nthe berries to come to perfection. Between this, however, and Cantagallo,\r\nwe saw some very extensive plantations, both the soil and climate being\r\nadmirably adapted for the growth of the coffee plant.\r\n\r\nThe villa of Cantagallo is situated in a narrow valley, bounded on each\r\nside by rather high hills; it consists principally of one long street,\r\nand a large square, of which only two sides are completed; the houses are\r\nmostly well built, and on the whole it has a neat and clean appearance.\r\nFormerly there were many gold washings in the neighbourhood, but now\r\nscarcely any one occupies himself in searching for this metal. The great\r\narticle of produce is coffee, with which immense tracts are planted: it\r\nis conveyed by mules to the head of the bay, and then shipped for Rio.\r\n\r\nWe took up our quarters at an inn kept by a Frenchman, a man of immense\r\nsize, and well advanced in years, who informed us that in his youth he\r\nbelonged to the body-guard of Napoleon. On the second morning after\r\nour arrival we resumed our journey, and at nine o’clock P.M., reached\r\nthe Swiss colony of Novo Friburgo, about eight leagues distant. The\r\nfirst part of the journey leads through a level country which is\r\nwell cultivated, but the road afterwards becomes very mountainous,\r\nparticularly during the last two leagues, through a wild and romantic\r\ndeep pass; though it was late before we reached the end of our journey,\r\nthe brilliant moonlight enabled us to admire some of the beauties of the\r\nscenery.\r\n\r\nThe town of Novo Friburgo, called also Morro Queimade, is built in\r\nthe form of a square, with the houses nearly all of one story; it is\r\ninhabited principally by natives of Switzerland, who emigrated to Brazil\r\nmany years ago; several Brazilian families also reside here. About a\r\nmile to the west there is a small village in which the Protestant part\r\nof the settlers live. The greater number of the colonists, however, are\r\nscattered in the country for several miles round. They are very poor,\r\nhaving been placed by the Brazilian government in one of the worst\r\npossible places for the exertion of their industry, the situation being\r\nelevated more than 3,000 feet above the level of the sea, with a bad\r\nsoil, and a climate quite unfitted for the cultivation of either coffee\r\nor sugar. Their principal crops are Indian corn, and a few European\r\nvegetables; they also make a little butter. The climate being very\r\nagreeable during the summer months, many families, both foreign and\r\nBrazilian, come here to escape the great heat of the city. The mountain\r\nscenery around is very fine, but is far from equalling that of the Organ\r\nmountains. There is a good inn in the town kept by a Swiss, where we put\r\nup during our short stay.\r\n\r\nWe left Novo Friburgo on the 6th of April, and returned to the Organ\r\nmountains. Passing in a westerly direction through a hilly, wooded\r\ncountry, we arrived in the afternoon at a small house situated in a\r\nvalley by the side of a little stream, where we were glad to take up our\r\nquarters for the night, as it had rained heavily from about midnight:\r\nwe could get nothing for our dinner but a few boiled cabbage leaves and\r\nrice. A short time before we arrived at this place, we passed through\r\na dense forest of large trees, on the stems and branches of which grew\r\nimmense quantities of the beautiful _Gesneria bulbosa_, the large\r\npanicles of which, consisting of numerous brilliant scarlet flowers, hung\r\ndown over our heads in the path. Orchideous plants were also abundant;\r\none of the finest of which, the _Oncidium Forbesii_, was in flower. On\r\nthe following night we slept at a small estate belonging to Admiral\r\nTaylor, an Englishman, who has been long in the Brazilian service, whom I\r\nknew well, but we did not find him at home; and in the afternoon of the\r\nnext day, after a ride of about three leagues, we arrived at Mr. March’s\r\nfazenda.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that this visit to the Organ mountains was made at the\r\nsame season as my previous one, the variety of the vegetation is so\r\ngreat, that I added to my collection several hundred plants I had not\r\nformerly met with. My general health, which had suffered a good deal\r\nfrom the fatigues of my long journey in the interior, and by pretty\r\nclose confinement for three months in Rio during the hot season, improved\r\nwonderfully by my sojourn on the mountains. There were not so many\r\nEnglish families here at this time as there were in 1837, and there\r\nwas consequently less gaiety; but most of my leisure hours were spent\r\nagreeably at one or other of the cottages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nMARANHAM, VOYAGE TO ENGLAND, CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n    Leaves the Organ Mountains and returns to Rio de\r\n    Janeiro—Embarks for England with large Collections of living\r\n    and dried Plants—Touches at Maranham—City described—Its\r\n    Population—Public Buildings—And Trade—Geology of its\r\n    neighbourhood—Visits Alcantarà—Sails for England—Gulf Weed—Its\r\n    great extent and origin—Flying Fishes—Observations on their\r\n    mode of flight—Remarkable Phosphorescence at Sea—Description\r\n    of the singular animal that causes this phenomenon—Its curious\r\n    nests—Scintillations at Sea caused by a very minute kind of\r\n    Shrimp—Arrives in England—Concluding remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\nLearning that there was a vessel in the harbour at Rio, about to sail\r\nfor Liverpool, and being now anxious to return to England, I put my\r\ncollections into order, and left the Organ mountains on the morning of\r\nthe 25th of April, reached Piedade the same evening, and arrived in the\r\ncity early next morning. Besides botanical specimens for the herbarium,\r\nI collected, during my residence on the mountains, a large number of\r\nthe most beautiful plants in a living state to take home with me. They\r\nfilled six large Wardian cases, but scarcely half of them reached England\r\nalive, owing to the boxes not having been properly constructed; many of\r\nthose which survived are now widely dispersed, and are very ornamental\r\nplants.[23]\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of the 6th of May, I went on board the barque\r\n“Gipsy,” which shortly after got under weigh. She was not, however,\r\nbound for England direct, having to call at Maranham, in the north of\r\nBrazil, to take in a cargo of cotton. I was thus unexpectedly afforded\r\nan opportunity of seeing another of the large Brazilian sea-ports, and\r\nof making a few collections in a part of the empire which possesses a\r\ndifferent vegetation from any I had hitherto visited. We had a fine run\r\nto Maranham, which place we reached in fifteen days. The night before we\r\nmade land, we had a strong breeze off shore, which brought with it a vast\r\nnumber of moths and butterflies of all sizes, and of those that came on\r\nboard I was enabled to make a collection of about a dozen species. The\r\nland here, as at Pernambuco, is very flat; the great sea-ports of Brazil\r\ndiminish in importance from south to north, the most important being Rio,\r\nthe next Bahia, the third Pernambuco, and the fourth Maranham.\r\n\r\nThe town of S. Luiz de Maranham is situated on a slightly elevated part\r\nof the north-west end of an island of the same name, which is about\r\nseven leagues long by five broad, and is separated from the mainland by\r\na channel of no great breadth. The river, in the mouth of which it is\r\nsituated, is formed by the union of several smaller ones which take their\r\norigin in the south-western portions of the province. The population of\r\nthe town is said to amount to about 26,000; the houses are substantially\r\nbuilt of a reddish-coloured sandstone, are mostly of two stories, and\r\nmore regular in their appearance than those of the other large Brazilian\r\ncities. The streets are generally well paved, and cleaner than any I\r\nhave seen in the country, no doubt owing to many of them having a slight\r\ninclination, which allows them to benefit by the heavy falls of rain that\r\nhad already set in when we arrived. It contains eighty-five churches; the\r\npalace of the president forms part of a large square, the remainder of\r\nwhich consists of a large building formerly the college of the Jesuits,\r\nthe prison, and the town-hall. A very considerable trade is carried on\r\nhere both of import and export: most of the European goods which arrive,\r\nare sent up to the interior of the province, and also into that of\r\nPiauhy; the principal exports are cotton and hides.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at Maranham, I was very kindly received by the English\r\nresidents there, who had heard of me when I was at Oeiras, and was\r\ninvited to take up my quarters in the house of the English physician, Dr.\r\nArbuckle. As the ship remained about three weeks, I had ample time to\r\nmake a few excursions in the neighbourhood, but was prevented from seeing\r\nas much of the country as I wished, on account of the rains.\r\n\r\nThe island on which the town stands is very flat, in some places marshy,\r\nand covered with a vegetation of shrubs and small trees. In the marshes\r\ngrow some fine palms belonging to the genera _Attalea_ and _Euterpe_.\r\nThere are but very few cocoa-nut trees; and indeed the general appearance\r\nof the country indicates a less humid climate, and consequently a less\r\nvigorous vegetation than exists towards the southern tropic. On the\r\nisland there is but little cultivation; much of the soil is of a sandy\r\nnature on the surface, and below that of a gravelly character, highly\r\nimpregnated with iron; and the same also is the case on the continent\r\nopposite the town. The rock which forms the basis of the island is a\r\ndark red sandstone, similar to that which I found in the provinces of\r\nCeará and Piauhy in connection with the chalk formation of those parts of\r\nthe country. In many places it is of a conglomerate nature, the rounded\r\nstones being of the same character as the softer matrix in which they\r\nare imbedded. On the opposite continent, near the town of Alcantarà, I\r\nfound the same rock rising only a little above the level of the sea, but\r\noverlaid by another rocky deposit, more than fifty feet thick in some\r\nplaces, consisting of alternate strata of yellowish and greenish coloured\r\nsandstone, irregularly deposited, soft, and in some places of a marly\r\nnature. These rocks I have no hesitation in considering as equivalent to\r\nthose which underlie the white chalk near the Villa do Crato and Barra\r\ndo Jardim, in the interior of the province of Ceará, and they no doubt\r\nformed part of the great chalk deposit, which seems at one time to have\r\ncovered the eastern shoulder of the South American continent, but which\r\nin many places has since disappeared.\r\n\r\nBesides making excursions in all directions in the island, I also\r\ncrossed over to Alcantarà, where I remained three days. I had a letter\r\nof introduction to the principal merchant in the place, Senhor Peichoto,\r\na native of Portugal, and with him I lived during my stay there. I\r\ncrossed the bay, which is about four leagues broad, in one of the regular\r\ntrading vessels, which are about forty tons burden; these carry over\r\nfrom Alcantarà cotton and fire-wood, the former is cultivated at some\r\ndistance in the interior, whence it is brought in on the backs of horses;\r\nthe fire-wood is obtained from the stems and branches of the mangrove\r\n(_Rhizophora Mangle_), which grows in great abundance along the muddy\r\nshores: it burns in the green state better perhaps than any other kind\r\nof tree. Along these muddy shores great flocks of the beautiful Red\r\nFlamingo (_Phænicopterus Chilensis_, Molina) are almost always to be\r\nseen. At night they roost among the mangroves, and are much sought after\r\nby the inhabitants, who consider their flesh excellent food. The town of\r\nAlcantarà, like that of Maranham, is situated on a rising ground, and\r\nseems to have been once in a more flourishing state than at present;\r\nthe houses and churches are mostly large, but are in a very dilapidated\r\nstate, while the streets are overgrown with weeds. The more wealthy\r\npeople who reside here, are the proprietors of cotton plantations, while\r\nthe poorer gain a livelihood by fishing and making hammocks, for which\r\nlatter article there is a great demand through the northern provinces.\r\nSome of these are so finely worked that they sell for as much as six or\r\neight pounds each; they are made of fine cotton cord, and are either\r\naltogether of a white colour, or white and blue, the latter colour being\r\nobtained from the wild Indigo, which grows abundantly all over the\r\ncountry. There are _Salinas_, or salt-pits, a few miles to the north of\r\nthe town, which formerly belonged to the Jesuits, and were profitably\r\nworked by them, but they are now very much neglected. Along the shore,\r\nand scattered here and there among the bushes on the low hills, I saw\r\na few plants of the wax palm (_Corypha cerifera_, Mart.), which is so\r\ncommon about Aracaty, in the province of Ceará.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my rambles in this neighbourhood, I met with many plants\r\nthat were new to my collections; the flora of Maranham has greater\r\naffinity with that of Guiana, than with any other part of Brazil I have\r\nvisited, as might indeed be expected from its northerly position; it is\r\nalso well known that such plants as grow only near the sea, have a far\r\nmore extensive geographical range than those which grow inland. I was\r\nparticularly struck with this fact in travelling into the interior from\r\nPernambuco and Aracaty. At both of these places are seen many plants\r\ncommon to the shores of the West Indies, Guiana, and nearly the whole\r\nof the intertropical coast of Brazil, while in the same parallels of\r\nlatitude, from a little way inland to the most western point I reached,\r\nthe vegetation had a distinct character from that of any other place.\r\nThe same observations apply to extensive plains, the vegetation of which\r\nis so frequently and annoyingly monotonous to the botanist, while on\r\nelevated tracts a much greater diversity occurs.\r\n\r\nIt was the knowledge of this fact that induced me, during the whole of my\r\ntravels, to keep as much as possible along mountain chains and elevated\r\ntable-lands. No satisfactory reason has yet been suggested to account for\r\nthe greater number of species which exist in a given space on a mountain\r\nthan on a plain; temperature, light, and moisture, no doubt play the most\r\nimportant part, but there must be other causes yet unknown.\r\n\r\nAt Maranham I met two of my Oeiras acquaintances: one of them, though a\r\nmajor in the army, was also a merchant, who had come down to purchase\r\nEuropean goods; the other, a son of the old Baron of Paranahiba, whose\r\nobject was to enter into holy orders, previous to his being appointed\r\nVicar of Oeiras. From them I learned that the insurrection had at last\r\nbeen put down, and that the province was subsiding into a more settled\r\nstate. The authorities were apprehending all those they could lay their\r\nhands on, who had been engaged in the affair, and sending them to the\r\nprovince of Rio Grande do Sul, to fight against the rebels there,—a rare\r\npiece of policy! I saw several parties of them brought down, and a very\r\nill-looking set of fellows they were.\r\n\r\nThe ship at length having taken in all her cargo, I embarked, and finally\r\nbade adieu to the shores of Brazil, on the morning of the eighth of June.\r\nWhile we were in about the fifty-sixth degree of west longitude, and\r\nbetween the twenty-second and twenty-eighth degrees of north latitude,\r\nwe passed through those enormous fields of sea-weed, (_Sargassum\r\nbacciferum_, Agardh), which have been described by almost every voyager\r\nin those seas. It existed generally in long narrow strips or bands, lying\r\nacross the wind, sometimes not more than the ships’ length apart, at\r\nother times at a considerable distance from each other. Much diversity of\r\nopinion exists as to the origin of this floating mass; Humboldt believes\r\nit be detached from rocks, at a considerable depth in the latitudes\r\nwhere it floats; while others suppose it to come from the shores of the\r\nnorthern seas, having been detached from the rocks by the violence of\r\nthe winds. Some again imagine that it comes from the rocky shores of\r\nthe gulfs of Mexico and Florida; while many agree with me in believing\r\nthat it has never had any other than its present place of abode; no one\r\nhas ever seen it attached to rocks, nor have roots ever been discovered\r\nbelonging to it. During the five or six days that we sailed through this\r\ngulf-weed, I hooked on board more than a thousand pieces, and every one\r\nof them presented the same appearance. The lower end of the stem had\r\nalways a whitish, decayed appearance, just like a piece of tangle which\r\nhas been some time cast on shore, while the extremities of the branches\r\nwere universally of a very fresh and healthy appearance. Such being the\r\ncase, we can scarcely help believing that these remarkable plants have\r\nexisted since the time of their first creation to the present period,\r\nas we now find them, floating always in this revolving gulf stream, and\r\nundergoing a perpetual mutation from the decay at one extremity, and\r\ngrowth at the other. There is nothing unreasonable in this opinion, as\r\nsea-weeds are not like land plants, which derive nourishment from the\r\nspot to which they are attached. I found among the weed a great variety\r\nof _Zoophytes_ and other minute marine animals; a crab, measuring from an\r\ninch to an inch and a half across, was frequent, and I observed the nest\r\nof one, formed by the small branches woven together by a strong kind of\r\nthread, not unlike that of which spiders make their webs; it contained a\r\nnumber of young ones.\r\n\r\nIn those latitudes, it was also curious to watch the flight of the\r\nflying-fishes (_Exocetus volitans_), whole shoals of which rose quite\r\nclose to the ship; and I have perfectly satisfied myself, not only on\r\nthis occasion, but during the several times I have crossed the ocean,\r\nthat they make use of their pectoral fins as wings, during the time they\r\nremain above water. This fact I was particularly desirous to ascertain,\r\nas Cuvier and all other authors I have consulted on the subject, except\r\nHumboldt, deny that this is the case.[24] The distance to which they fly\r\nis sometimes very short, at others I have watched them skimming along\r\ntill the eye almost lost sight of them; I should say that they frequently\r\nextend their flight to three hundred yards. The height to which they rise\r\nabove the surface of the sea, does not usually exceed three or four feet,\r\nbut that they rise higher is well known, from the fact that they not\r\nunfrequently fly on board ships, which are from ten to fifteen feet out\r\nof the water. When the sea is calm, they shoot along on the same plane,\r\nlike an arrow, and the impulse they acquire on leaving the water appears\r\nto be that alone which impels them onward. The first time I discovered\r\nthat they certainly use their fins as wings was one day when a rather\r\nhigh swell was running; a good many fish were rising, but not in great\r\nnumbers at a time. Solitary individuals could be followed by the eye to a\r\ngreat distance, but during their progress they did not keep on the same\r\nplane, nor did the course of their flight form the segment of a circle,\r\nbut they could most distinctly be seen rising and falling over the heavy\r\nswell, keeping always at about the same height above the water, just as a\r\nbird would do; the albatross, for example, when skimming along in search\r\nof food. The only time I ever saw distinctly the fins moved in the manner\r\nof wings, was in the South Atlantic Ocean. One beautifully clear day,\r\nwhen we were running quietly along under the influence of a light breeze,\r\nseveral large dolphins were playing about, one of which we saw give chase\r\nto a flying-fish; the latter rose, but its flight was followed by the\r\ndolphin. It fell close to the ship, and in attempting to rise again, the\r\nimpulse was not sufficient to throw it completely out of the water; it\r\nflew along with its tail nearly out of the sea, for about a yard, when\r\nit fell a prey to its pursuer; several of the other passengers were\r\nwatching it also, and by all of us the large fins were seen to be worked\r\nwith great rapidity. I agree with Humboldt,[25] that these fishes do not\r\nalways rise out of the water to escape from their enemies, as they often\r\nspring up close to ships, when there are no signs of large fishes being\r\nnear. Why should the flying-fish, having the power to do so, not enjoy a\r\nflight in the air, quite as much as a duck does a dive under the water,\r\nor land animals the luxury of bathing?\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable oceanic phenomenon is the brilliant phosphorescence\r\nof the water, which frequently occurs in low latitudes; and, presuming\r\nthey will not be misplaced, I shall make a few observations on the\r\nsubject. On my passage from England, and while we were about 2° of south\r\nlatitude and 26° of west longitude, I was called up by the captain, about\r\nhalf-past ten o’clock at night, to witness a remarkable appearance the\r\nsea had assumed. Upon reaching the deck, one of the most magnificent\r\nscenes imaginable presented itself; all round the ship, and to as great\r\na distance as the eye could reach, the swell, which was running pretty\r\nhigh, was emitting from its surface, at short intervals, long broad\r\nsheets of phosphorescent light, which continued bright only for a second\r\nor two, and then disappeared. The continued glare of these long streams\r\nof light, their sudden appearance and disappearance, as if detached\r\nportions of sheet lightning were flashing from wave to wave, gave a wild\r\nand terrific aspect to the surface of the ocean; the reflection from it\r\nwas so great, that the sails of the ship were illumined by the glare. On\r\nlooking over the ship’s stern, her wake for about fifty yards was one\r\ncontinued stream of pale yellow light, upon which, ever and anon, were\r\nfloating away, and becoming extinct, curious masses of a circular shape,\r\nvarying from half a foot to two feet in breadth, of a livid hue, similar\r\nto that which burning sulphur emits. These masses retained their livid\r\nflame-like appearance till they reached about six or eight yards from\r\nthe ship, when they gradually became extinct; their beautiful colour\r\ncontrasting singularly with the pale yellow stream on which they floated.\r\nThis curious state of the sea only lasted about a quarter of an hour, the\r\nwater then assuming its usual aspect, the foam at the ship’s bow only\r\npresenting the sparkling appearance which it usually exhibits within the\r\ntropics. This occurred on the 7th of July; the weather had been cloudy\r\nall day, with the thermometer 79° at noon; the night was dark, and it was\r\nblowing a fresh breeze from E.S.E., the ship going at the rate of six\r\nknots an hour.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the circular masses of light which I have\r\ndescribed, are produced from aggregated masses of very small marine\r\nanimals, to which the name of _Pyrosoma_ is given; I did not, however,\r\ncapture any, as my towing net was at this time out of order, but during\r\nmy voyage to Ceylon I was more fortunate; on the 25th of November, 1843,\r\nin about 3° and 4° N. lat., and 23° W. long., with cloudy weather, and\r\nthe thermometer 81° at noon, shortly after it became dark, we got into a\r\nfield of these animals, and though the brilliancy of their light was not\r\nso great as on the former occasion, they were more numerous, the ship\r\nsailing through them for several hours. They were seen in broad shoals at\r\ngreat but irregular distances from each other. The towing net on being\r\nthrown overboard soon procured me a large supply of the extraordinary\r\nanimals of which these shoals were composed; they gave out a bright pale\r\nyellowish green light, which they retained for some time after they were\r\nbrought on board. Each mass was shaped not unlike the finger of a glove,\r\nbeing hollow, and closed at one end; they varied a little in size, but\r\nwere generally about four inches in length. The little animals of which\r\nthese masses are made up, are placed horizontally, and lie closely packed\r\nover each other, their heads being towards the outer surface. When kept\r\nin a glass in salt water for some time, they soon separated from each\r\nother, and being very transparent, were then scarcely to be distinguished\r\nfrom the water; they taste exactly like fresh oysters. During this\r\nvoyage, I obtained four distinct species, two of which were taken off\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope; one of these finger-like masses, taken near the\r\nEquator, measured about two feet in length. I have often observed close\r\nto the ship these bodies at a considerable depth, giving out a faint\r\nlight; and I am persuaded that the brilliant flashes which were emitted\r\nfrom the sides of the swell, on the first occasion, were caused by the\r\nnumber of the _Pyrosomæ_ then existing in the sea. The scintillations\r\nwhich issued from the foam, dashed up by the ship, were caused by a\r\nphosphorescent microscopic species of shrimp (_Noctiluca oceanica?_\r\nSpix), which I collected in great numbers, in a net made from an old flag.\r\n\r\nOur voyage home was a quick and a very pleasant one. We were only\r\nthirty-two days altogether at sea from Maranham, we had no rough weather,\r\nand the only calm day we experienced occurred between our losing the\r\nN.E. trades, and falling in with westerly winds. The nearer I approached\r\nhome, the more my desire increased to be again among my friends; and\r\nthis I believe, under similar circumstances, almost universally occurs.\r\nWhen we are at a great distance from, and know that we have no immediate\r\nchance of returning to, those who are dear to us, we suppress as much\r\nas possible the indulgence in hopes which cannot be realized; but when\r\nwe feel that every hour is bringing us nearer home, we throw off all\r\nrestraint on our imagination, and only regret that our progress cannot\r\nbe accelerated. On the evening of the eighth of July the welcome cry of\r\n“land” was heard, and on the following afternoon we made the mouth of\r\nthe Mersey, but for want of sufficient water, we had to stand off and on\r\ntill next morning, during which interval we experienced a smart gale of\r\nwind from the N.N.W., which kept us all awake. Early next day, the 10th\r\nof July, 1841, I stood once more on British ground, after an absence of\r\nupwards of five years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving now brought my narrative to a conclusion, it only remains\r\nto notice that the object I had in view when I left England, was\r\naccomplished to the satisfaction of all concerned in it, and the\r\nanticipations I had indulged of the pleasures to be derived from such\r\nan expedition, have not been disappointed. If almost every day brought\r\nits little annoyances, they were more than compensated by the delight\r\nwhich new scenes and objects for study constantly produced. Difficulties\r\nonly appear insurmountable when they are not looked boldly in the face;\r\nand it is fortunate for us that the bright side of the picture of the\r\npast presents itself more frequently than the dark. I have much to\r\ncongratulate myself upon; for although often exposed both by night and\r\nby day, my health, save only on one occasion, continued good; and with\r\nvery few exceptions, I received the greatest kindness from all my fellow\r\nmen with whom I came in contact. I have also been more fortunate than\r\nmany natural history travellers, for the numerous collections shipped to\r\nEngland, from time to time, all arrived safely; the letters, too, which\r\nI despatched, reached their destination, with only one exception; and\r\nnot one of those from home was lost, although often long in coming to my\r\nhands. It was not without many regrets that I left Brazil, for the life\r\nI led was free and independent; the climate agreed better with my health\r\nthan that of England; and the country is beautiful, and richer than any\r\nother in the world in those objects, to the study of which I have devoted\r\nmy life.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\nPrinted by Reeve, Benham and Reeve, King-William Street, Strand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Personal Narrative, vol. iii. p. 36.\r\n\r\n[2] _Echites atroviolacea_, Stadelm., and _E. crassinoda_, Gardn.\r\n\r\n[3] This species I have ascertained to be identical with _F. affinis_,\r\nCambess.; _F. pyrifolia_, Presl.; and _F. radicans_, Miers.\r\n\r\n[4] Vide Hooker’s ‘Journal of Botany,’ vol. iv. p. 5.\r\n\r\n[5] Dr. Parigot appears, however, to have found coal abundantly in the\r\nisland of Santa Catharina, in the south of Brazil.

Next\r\nto the virgin forests come the Catingas, the trees of which are generally\r\nsmall and deciduous, and form the connecting link between the virgin\r\nforests and the Carrascos, which grow on more elevated tracts than the\r\nCatingas, and consist of close growing shrubs about three or four feet\r\nhigh. These are all natural woods, very different from the next I shall\r\nmention, to which the name of Capoeira is given; such wooded tracts are\r\nformed by the small trees and shrubs, which spring up in lands that have\r\nbeen cultivated or prepared for cultivation, by destroying the virgin\r\nforests, which is generally effected by setting fire to them: the trees\r\nthat then spring up are always very distinct from those which constituted\r\ntheir original vegetation.\r\n\r\n[16] Voyage dans les Provinces de Rio de Janeiro et de Minas Geräes, t.\r\n2. p. 350.\r\n\r\n[17] Since my return to England, I have described several of these\r\ncurious plants in the sixth vol. of Hooker’s ‘Icones Plantarum.’\r\n\r\n[18] For an excellent description of the diamond mines, and an account\r\nof the manner in which the workings were carried on while under the\r\nadministration of the government, the reader is referred to the work of\r\nM. Auguste de Saint Hilaire, ‘Voyage dans le district des Diamans et sur\r\nle Littoral du Brésil,’ Paris, 1833.\r\n\r\n[19] Martius, in speaking of the productions of Minas Geräes, says:\r\n“Almost every kind of metal is found here; iron-stone, which produces\r\nninety per cent., is met with almost everywhere, and it constitutes in\r\na manner the chief component part of long chains; lead is found beyond\r\nthe Rio de San Francisco in Abaité; copper in San Domingos, near Fanado\r\nin Minas Novas; chrome and manganese in Paraöpeba; platina near Gaspar\r\nSoares, and in other rivers; quicksilver, arsenic, bismuth, antimony, and\r\nred-lead ore, about Villa Rica; diamonds in Tijuco and Abaité; yellow,\r\nblue, and white topazes, grass and bluish green aqua marines, red and\r\ngreen tourmalines, chrysoberyls, garnets and amethysts, principally in\r\nMinas Novas. But what has chiefly contributed to the great influx of\r\nsettlers, and to the rapid population of this province, particularly of\r\nthe capital, is the great abundance of gold which has been obtained for\r\nabove a century.” _Travels in Brazil, Lloyd’s Translation_, vol. ii. p.\r\n181.\r\n\r\n[20] “Congonhas doit sa fondation à des mineurs attirés par l’or que l’on\r\ntrouvait dans les alentours, et son histoire est celle de tant d’autres\r\nbourgades. Le précieux métal s’est épuisé; les travaux sont devenus plus\r\ndifficiles, et Congonhas n’annonce actuellement que la décadence et\r\nl’abandon.”—_Voyage dans le District des Diamans, &c. par Aug. de St.\r\nHilaire_; vol. i. p. 169.\r\n\r\n[21] Phillips, Treatise on Geology, in Lardner’s Cyclopedia, vol. ii. p.\r\n227.\r\n\r\n[22] For view of the Organ mountains, and Mr. March’s fazenda, see\r\nFrontispiece.\r\n\r\n[23] Among those which were introduced to England for the first time\r\non this occasion, may be enumerated the following:—_Siphocampylus\r\nbetulæfolius_, G. Don; _Pleroma Benthamiana_, Gardn. and _P. multiflora_,\r\nGardn.; _Franciscea hydrangeæformis_, Pohl; _Nematanthus longipes_,\r\nPohl; _Gesneria salviæfolia_, Gardn., and _G. leptopes_, Gardn.;\r\n_Clusia fragrans_, Gardn.; _Luxemburgia ciliata_, Gardn.; _Dorstenia\r\nelata_, Hook; _Prepusa connata_, Gardn., and _P. Hookeriana_, Gardn.;\r\n_Campomanesia hirsuta_, Gardn.; _Bidens speciosa_, Gardn.; _Bowmania\r\nspeciosa_, Gardn.; _Anemia stricta_, Gardn. MS.; _Pteris sagittæfolia_,\r\nRaddi; _Alstrœmeria nemorosa_, Gardn.; _Euterpe edulis_, Mart., and\r\n_Corypha cerifera_, Mart., from Maranham.\r\n\r\n[24] The following is the statement of Baron Cuvier:—“Leur vol n’est\r\njamais bien long; s’élevant pour fuir les poissons voraces, ils retombent\r\nbientôt, parce que leurs ailes ne leur servent que de parachutes.” Le\r\nRègne animal, Tom. 2, p. 287. Edit. 1829.\r\n\r\n[25] Personal Narrative, vol. ii. p. 15.",
