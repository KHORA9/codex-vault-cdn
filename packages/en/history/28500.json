Subsequently he spent a year in\r\ntravel among the coffee-producing countries. After the initial surveys,\r\ncorrespondents were appointed to make researches in the principal\r\nEuropean libraries and museums; and this phase of the work continued\r\nuntil April, 1922. Simultaneous researches were conducted in American\r\nlibraries and historical museums up to the time of the return of the\r\nfinal proofs to the printer in June, 1922.\r\n\r\nTen years ago the sorting and classification of the material was begun.\r\nThe actual writing of the manuscript has extended over four years.\r\n\r\nAmong the unique features of the book are the Coffee Thesaurus; the\r\nCoffee Chronology, containing 492 dates of historical importance; the\r\nComplete Reference Table of the Principal Kinds of Coffee Grown in the\r\nWorld; and the Coffee Bibliography, containing 1,380 references.\r\n\r\nThe most authoritative works on this subject have been Robinson's _The\r\nEarly History of Coffee Houses in England_, published in London in 1893;\r\nand Jardin's _Le Café_, published in Paris in 1895. The author wishes to\r\nacknowledge his indebtedness to both for inspiration and guidance. Other\r\nworks, Arabian, French, English, German, and Italian, dealing with\r\nparticular phases of the subject, have been laid under contribution; and\r\nwhere this has been done, credit is given by footnote reference. In all\r\ncases where it has been possible to do so, however, statements of\r\nhistorical facts have been verified by independent research. Not a few\r\nitems have required months of tracing to confirm or to disprove.\r\n\r\nThere has been no serious American work on coffee since Hewitt's\r\n_Coffee: Its History, Cultivation and Uses_, published in 1872; and\r\nThurber's _Coffee from Plantation to Cup_, published in 1881. Both of\r\nthese are now out of print, as is also Walsh's _Coffee: Its History,\r\nClassification and Description_, published in 1893.\r\n\r\nThe chapters on The Chemistry of Coffee and The Pharmacology of Coffee\r\nhave been prepared under the author's direction by Charles W. Trigg,\r\nindustrial fellow of the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research.\r\n\r\nThe author wishes to acknowledge, with thanks, valuable assistance and\r\nnumerous courtesies by the officials of the following institutions:\r\n\r\nBritish Museum, and Guildhall Museum, London; Bibliothéque Nationale,\r\nParis; Congressional Library, Washington; New York Public Library,\r\nMetropolitan Museum of Art, and New York Historical Society, New York;\r\nBoston Public Library, and Boston Museum of Fine Arts; Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, Washington; State Historical Museum, Madison, Wis.; Maine\r\nHistorical Society, Portland; Chicago Historical Society; New Jersey\r\nHistorical Society, Newark; Harvard University Library; Essex Institute,\r\nSalem, Mass.; Peabody Institute, Baltimore.\r\n\r\nThanks and appreciation are due also to:\r\n\r\nCharles James Jackson, London, for permission to quote from his\r\n_Illustrated History of English Plate_;\r\n\r\nFrancis Hill Bigelow, author; and The Macmillan Company, publishers, for\r\npermission to reproduce illustrations from _Historic Silver of the\r\nColonies_;\r\n\r\nH.G.

Of the two, the tea leaves lead\r\nin total amount consumed; the coffee beans are second; and the cocoa\r\nbeans are a distant third, although advancing steadily. But in\r\ninternational commerce the coffee beans occupy a far more important\r\nposition than either of the others, being imported into non-producing\r\ncountries to twice the extent of the tea leaves. All three enjoy a\r\nworld-wide consumption, although not to the same extent in every nation;\r\nbut where either the coffee bean or the tea leaf has established itself\r\nin a given country, the other gets comparatively little attention, and\r\nusually has great difficulty in making any advance. The cocoa bean, on\r\nthe other hand, has not risen to the position of popular favorite in any\r\nimportant consuming country, and so has not aroused the serious\r\nopposition of its two rivals.\r\n\r\nCoffee is universal in its appeal. All nations do it homage. It has\r\nbecome recognized as a human necessity. It is no longer a luxury or an\r\nindulgence; it is a corollary of human energy and human efficiency.\r\nPeople love coffee because of its two-fold effect--the pleasurable\r\nsensation and the increased efficiency it produces.\r\n\r\nCoffee has an important place in the rational dietary of all the\r\ncivilized peoples of earth. It is a democratic beverage. Not only is it\r\nthe drink of fashionable society, but it is also a favorite beverage of\r\nthe men and women who do the world's work, whether they toil with brain\r\nor brawn. It has been acclaimed \"the most grateful lubricant known to\r\nthe human machine,\" and \"the most delightful taste in all nature.\"\r\n\r\nNo \"food drink\" has ever encountered so much opposition as coffee. Given\r\nto the world by the church and dignified by the medical profession,\r\nnevertheless it has had to suffer from religious superstition and\r\nmedical prejudice. During the thousand years of its development it has\r\nexperienced fierce political opposition, stupid fiscal restrictions,\r\nunjust taxes, irksome duties; but, surviving all of these, it has\r\ntriumphantly moved on to a foremost place in the catalog of popular\r\nbeverages.\r\n\r\nBut coffee is something more than a beverage. It is one of the world's\r\ngreatest adjuvant foods. There are other auxiliary foods, but none that\r\nexcels it for palatability and comforting effects, the psychology of\r\nwhich is to be found in its unique flavor and aroma.\r\n\r\nMen and women drink coffee because it adds to their sense of well-being.\r\nIt not only smells good and tastes good to all mankind, heathen or\r\ncivilized, but all respond to its wonderful stimulating properties. The\r\nchief factors in coffee goodness are the caffein content and the\r\ncaffeol. Caffein supplies the principal stimulant. It increases the\r\ncapacity for muscular and mental work without harmful reaction. The\r\ncaffeol supplies the flavor and the aroma--that indescribable Oriental\r\nfragrance that wooes us through the nostrils, forming one of the\r\nprincipal elements that make up the lure of coffee. There are several\r\nother constituents, including certain innocuous so-called caffetannic\r\nacids, that, in combination with the caffeol, give the beverage its rare\r\ngustatory appeal.\r\n\r\nThe year 1919 awarded coffee one of its brightest honors. An American\r\ngeneral said that coffee shared with bread and bacon the distinction of\r\nbeing one of the three nutritive essentials that helped win the World\r\nWar for the Allies. So this symbol of human brotherhood has played a not\r\ninconspicuous part in \"making the world safe for democracy.\" The new\r\nage, ushered in by the Peace of Versailles and the Washington\r\nConference, has for its hand-maidens temperance and self-control. It is\r\nto be a world democracy of right-living and clear thinking; and among\r\nits most precious adjuncts are coffee, tea, and cocoa--because these\r\nbeverages must always be associated with rational living, with greater\r\ncomfort, and with better cheer.\r\n\r\nLike all good things in life, the drinking of coffee may be abused.\r\nIndeed, those having an idiosyncratic susceptibility to alkaloids should\r\nbe temperate in the use of tea, coffee, or cocoa. In every\r\nhigh-tensioned country there is likely to be a small number of people\r\nwho, because of certain individual characteristics, can not drink coffee\r\nat all. These belong to the abnormal minority of the human family. Some\r\npeople can not eat strawberries; but that would not be a valid reason\r\nfor a general condemnation of strawberries. One may be poisoned, says\r\nThomas A. Edison, from too much food. Horace Fletcher was certain that\r\nover-feeding causes all our ills. Over-indulgence in meat is likely to\r\nspell trouble for the strongest of us. Coffee is, perhaps, less often\r\nabused than wrongly accused. It all depends. A little more tolerance!\r\n\r\nTrading upon the credulity of the hypochondriac and the\r\ncaffein-sensitive, in recent years there has appeared in America and\r\nabroad a curious collection of so-called coffee substitutes. They are\r\n\"neither fish nor flesh, nor good red herring.\" Most of them have been\r\nshown by official government analyses to be sadly deficient in food\r\nvalue--their only alleged virtue. One of our contemporary attackers of\r\nthe national beverage bewails the fact that no palatable hot drink has\r\nbeen found to take the place of coffee. The reason is not hard to find.\r\nThere can be no substitute for coffee. Dr. Harvey W. Wiley has ably\r\nsummed up the matter by saying, \"A substitute should be able to perform\r\nthe functions of its principal. A substitute to a war must be able to\r\nfight. A bounty-jumper is not a substitute.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been the aim of the author to tell the whole coffee story for the\r\ngeneral reader, yet with the technical accuracy that will make it\r\nvaluable to the trade. The book is designed to be a work of useful\r\nreference covering all the salient points of coffee's origin,\r\ncultivation, preparation, and development, its place in the world's\r\ncommerce and in a rational dietary.\r\n\r\nGood coffee, carefully roasted and properly brewed, produces a natural\r\nbeverage that, for tonic effect, can not be surpassed, even by its\r\nrivals, tea and cocoa. Here is a drink that ninety-seven percent of\r\nindividuals find harmless and wholesome, and without which life would be\r\ndrab indeed--a pure, safe, and helpful stimulant compounded in nature's\r\nown laboratory, and one of the chief joys of life!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nA COFFEE THESAURUS\r\n\r\nEncomiums and descriptive phrases applied to the plant, the berry, and the\r\nbeverage                                                   Page XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EVOLUTION OF A CUP OF COFFEE\r\n\r\nShowing the various steps through which the bean passes from plantation to\r\ncup                                                        Page XXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nDEALLING WITH THE ETYMOLOGY OF COFFEE\r\n\r\nOrigin and translation of the word from the Arabian into various\r\nlanguages--Views of many writers                           Page 1\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF COFFEE PROPAGATION\r\n\r\nA brief account of the cultivation of the coffee plant in the Old World,\r\nand of its introduction into the New--A romantic coffee adventure\r\n                                                           Page 5\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nEARLY HISTORY OF COFFEE DRINKING\r\n\r\nCoffee in the Near East in the early centuries--Stories of its\r\norigin--Discovery by physicians and adoption by the Church--Its spread\r\nthrough Arabia, Persia, and Turkey--Persecutions and\r\nIntolerances--Early coffee manners and customs             Page 11\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION OF COFFEE INTO WESTERN EUROPE\r\n\r\nWhen the three great temperance beverages, cocoa, tea, and coffee, came\r\nto Europe--Coffee first mentioned by Rauwolf in 1582--Early days of\r\ncoffee in Italy--How Pope Clement VIII baptized it and made it a truly\r\nChristian beverage--The first European coffee house, in Venice,\r\n1645--The famous Caffè Florian--Other celebrated Venetian coffee houses\r\nof the eighteenth century--The romantic story of Pedrocchi, the poor\r\nlemonade-vender, who built the most beautiful coffee house in the world\r\n                                                           Page 25\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNINGS OF COFFEE IN FRANCE\r\n\r\nWhat French travelers did for coffee--the introduction of coffee by P.\r\nde la Roque into Marseilles in 1644--The first commercial importation of\r\ncoffee from Egypt--The first French coffee house--Failure of the attempt\r\nby physicians of Marseilles to discredit coffee--Soliman Aga introduces\r\ncoffee into Paris--Cabarets à caffè--Celebrated works on coffee by\r\nFrench writers                                             Page 31\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE INTRODUCTION OF COFFEE INTO ENGLAND\r\n\r\nThe first printed reference to coffee in English--Early mention of\r\ncoffee by noted English travelers and writers--The Lacedæmonian \"black\r\nbroth\" controversy--How Conopios introduced coffee drinking at\r\nOxford--The first English coffee house in Oxford--Two English botanists\r\non coffee                                                  Page 35\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE INTRODUCTION OF COFFEE INTO HOLLAND\r\n\r\nHow the enterprising Dutch traders captured the first world's market for\r\ncoffee--Activities of the Netherlands East India Company--The first\r\ncoffee house at the Hague--The first public auction at Amsterdam in\r\n1711, when Java coffee brought forty-seven cents a pound, green\r\n                                                           Page 43\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE INTRODUCTION OF COFFEE INTO GERMANY\r\n\r\nThe contributions made by German travelers and writers to the literature\r\nof the early history of coffee--The first coffee house in Hamburg opened\r\nby an English merchant--Famous coffee houses of old Berlin--The first\r\ncoffee periodical and the first kaffee-klatsch--Frederick the Great's\r\ncoffee roasting monopoly--Coffee persecutions--\"Coffee-smellers\"--The\r\nfirst coffee king                                          Page 45\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTELLING HOW COFFEE CAME TO VIENNA\r\n\r\nThe romantic adventure of Franz George Kolschitzky, who carried \"a\r\nmessage to Garcia\" through the enemy's lines and won for himself the\r\nhonor of being the first to teach the Viennese the art of making coffee,\r\nto say nothing of falling heir to the supplies of the green beans left\r\nbehind by the Turks;

Eaton--Detail sketches show anther, pistil,\r\nand section of corolla]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nDEALING WITH THE ETYMOLOGY OF COFFEE\r\n\r\n     _Origin and translation of the word from the Arabian into various\r\n     languages--Views of many writers_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the word coffee involves several phonetic difficulties.\r\nThe European languages got the name of the beverage about 1600 from the\r\noriginal Arabic [Arabic] _qahwah_, not directly, but through its\r\nTurkish form, _kahveh_. This was the name, not of the plant, but the\r\nbeverage made from its infusion, being originally one of the names\r\nemployed for wine in Arabic.\r\n\r\nSir James Murray, in the _New English Dictionary_, says that some have\r\nconjectured that the word is a foreign, perhaps African, word disguised,\r\nand have thought it connected with the name Kaffa, a town in Shoa,\r\nsouthwest Abyssinia, reputed native place of the coffee plant, but that\r\nof this there is no evidence, and the name _qahwah_ is not given to the\r\nberry or plant, which is called [Arabic] _bunn_, the native name in\r\nShoa being _bun_.\r\n\r\nContributing to a symposium on the etymology of the word coffee in\r\n_Notes and Queries_, 1909, James Platt, Jr., said:\r\n\r\n     The Turkish form might have been written _kahvé_, as its final _h_\r\n     was never sounded at any time. Sir James Murray draws attention to\r\n     the existence of two European types, one like the French _café_,\r\n     Italian _caffè_, the other like the English _coffee_, Dutch\r\n     _koffie_. He explains the vowel _o_ in the second series as\r\n     apparently representing _au_, from Turkish _ahv_. This seems\r\n     unsupported by evidence, and the _v_ is already represented by the\r\n     _ff_, so on Sir James's assumption _coffee_ must stand for\r\n     _kahv-ve_, which is unlikely. The change from _a_ to _o_, in my\r\n     opinion, is better accounted for as an imperfect appreciation. The\r\n     exact sound of a in Arabic and other Oriental languages is that\r\n     of the English short U, as in \"cuff.\" This sound, so easy to us, is\r\n     a great stumbling-block to other nations. I judge that Dutch\r\n     _koffie_ and kindred forms are imperfect attempts at the notation\r\n     of a vowel which the writers could not grasp. It is clear that the\r\n     French type is more correct. The Germans have corrected their\r\n     _koffee_, which they may have got from the Dutch, into _kaffee_.\r\n     The Scandinavian languages have adopted the French form. Many must\r\n     wonder how the _hv_ of the original so persistently becomes _ff_ in\r\n     the European equivalents. Sir James Murray makes no attempt to\r\n     solve this problem.\r\n\r\nVirendranath Chattopádhyáya, who also contributed to the _Notes and\r\nQueries_ symposium, argued that the _hw_ of the Arabic _qahwah_ becomes\r\nsometimes _ff_ and sometimes only _f_ or _v_ in European translations\r\nbecause some languages, such as English, have strong syllabic accents\r\n(stresses), while others, as French, have none. Again, he points out\r\nthat the surd aspirate _h_ is heard in some languages, but is hardly\r\naudible in others. Most Europeans tend to leave it out altogether.\r\n\r\nCol. W.F. Prideaux, another contributor, argued that the European\r\nlanguages got one form of the word coffee directly from the Arabic\r\n_qahwah_, and quoted from Hobson-Jobson in support of this:\r\n\r\n     _Chaoua_ in 1598, _Cahoa_ in 1610, _Cahue_ in 1615; while Sir\r\n     Thomas Herbert (1638) expressly states that \"they drink (in Persia)\r\n     ... above all the rest, _Coho_ or _Copha_: by Turk and Arab called\r\n     _Caphe_ and _Cahua_.\" Here the Persian, Turkish, and Arabic\r\n     pronunciations are clearly differentiated.\r\n\r\nCol. Prideaux then calls, as a witness to the Anglo-Arabic\r\npronunciation, one whose evidence was not available when the _New\r\nEnglish Dictionary_ and Hobson-Jobson articles were written. This is\r\nJohn Jourdain, a Dorsetshire seaman, whose _Diary_ was printed by the\r\nHakluyt Society in 1905. On May 28, 1609, he records that \"in the\r\nafternoone wee departed out of Hatch (Al-Hauta, the capital of the Lahej\r\ndistrict near Aden), and travelled untill three in the morninge, and\r\nthen wee rested in the plaine fields untill three the next daie, neere\r\nunto a cohoo howse in the desert.\" On June 5 the party, traveling from\r\nHippa (Ibb), \"laye in the mountaynes, our camells being wearie, and our\r\nselves little better. This mountain is called Nasmarde (Nakil\r\nSumara), where all the cohoo grows.\" Farther on was \"a little\r\nvillage, where there is sold cohoo and fruite. The seeds of this cohoo\r\nis a greate marchandize, for it is carried to grand Cairo and all other\r\nplaces of Turkey, and to the Indias.\" Prideaux, however, mentions that\r\nanother sailor, William Revett, in his journal (1609) says, referring to\r\nMocha, that \"Shaomer Shadli (Shaikh 'Ali bin 'Omar esh-Shadil) was\r\nthe fyrst inventour for drynking of coffe, and therefor had in\r\nesteemation.\" This rather looks to Prideaux as if on the coast of\r\nArabia, and in the mercantile towns, the Persian pronunciation was in\r\nvogue; whilst in the interior, where Jourdain traveled, the Englishman\r\nreproduced the Arabic.\r\n\r\nMr. Chattopádhyáya, discussing Col. Prideaux's views as expressed above,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     Col. Prideaux may doubt \"if the worthy mariner, in entering the\r\n     word in his log, was influenced by the abstruse principles of\r\n     phonetics enunciated\" by me, but he will admit that the change from\r\n     _kahvah_ to _coffee_ is a phonetic change, and must be due to the\r\n     operation of some phonetic principle. The average man, when he\r\n     endeavours to write a foreign word in his own tongue, is\r\n     handicapped considerably by his inherited and acquired phonetic\r\n     capacity. And, in fact, if we take the quotations made in\r\n     \"Hobson-Jobson,\" and classify the various forms of the word\r\n     _coffee_ according to the nationality of the writer, we obtain very\r\n     interesting results.\r\n\r\n     Let us take Englishmen and Dutchmen first. In Danvers's _Letters_\r\n     (1611) we have both \"_coho_ pots\" and \"_coffao_ pots\"; Sir T. Roe\r\n     (1615) and Terry (1616) have _cohu_; Sir T. Herbert (1638) has\r\n     _coho_ and _copha_; Evelyn (1637), _coffee_; Fryer (1673) _coho_;\r\n     Ovington (1690), _coffee_; and Valentijn (1726), _coffi_. And from\r\n     the two examples given by Col. Prideaux, we see that Jourdain\r\n     (1609) has _cohoo_, and Revett (1609) has _coffe_.\r\n\r\nTo the above should be added the following by English writers, given in\r\nFoster's _English Factories in India_ (1618-21, 1622-23, 1624-29): cowha\r\n(1619), cowhe, couha (1621), coffa (1628).\r\n\r\nLet us now see what foreigners (chiefly French and Italian) write. The\r\nearliest European mention is by Rauwolf, who knew it in Aleppo in 1573.\r\nHe has the form _chaube_. Prospero Alpini (1580) has _caova_; Paludanus\r\n(1598) _chaoua_; Pyrard de Laval (1610) _cahoa_; P. Della Valle (1615)\r\n_cahue_; Jac. Bontius (1631) _caveah_; and the _Journal d'Antoine\r\nGalland_ (1673) _cave_. That is, Englishmen use forms of a certain\r\ndistinct type, _viz._, cohu, coho, coffao, coffe, copha, coffee, which\r\ndiffer from the more correct transliteration of foreigners.\r\n\r\nIn 1610 the Portuguese Jew, Pedro Teixeira (in the Hakluyt Society's\r\nedition of his _Travels_) used the word _kavàh_.\r\n\r\nThe inferences from these transitional forms seem to be: 1. The word\r\nfound its way into the languages of Europe both from the Turkish and\r\nfrom the Arabic. 2. The English forms (which have strong stress on the\r\nfirst syllable) have _o_ instead of _a_, and _f_ instead of _h_.\r\n3. The foreign forms are unstressed and have no _h_. The original _v_ or\r\n_w_ (or labialized _u_) is retained or changed into _f_.\r\n\r\nIt may be stated, accordingly, that the chief reason for the existence\r\nof two distinct types of spelling is the omission of _h_ in unstressed\r\nlanguages, and the conversion of _h_ into _f_ under strong stress in\r\nstressed languages. Such conversion often takes place in Turkish; for\r\nexample, _silah dar_ in Persian (which is a highly stressed language)\r\nbecomes _zilif dar_ in Turkish. In the languages of India, on the other\r\nhand, in spite of the fact that the aspirate is usually very clearly\r\nsounded, the word _qahvah_ is pronounced _kaiva_ by the less\r\neducated classes, owing to the syllables being equally stressed.\r\n\r\nNow for the French viewpoint. Jardin[3] opines that, as regards the\r\netymology of the word coffee, scholars are not agreed and perhaps never\r\nwill be. Dufour[4] says the word is derived from _caouhe_, a name given\r\nby the Turks to the beverage prepared from the seed. Chevalier\r\nd'Arvieux, French consul at Alet, Savary, and Trevoux, in his\r\ndictionary, think that coffee comes from the Arabic, but from the word\r\n_cahoueh_ or _quaweh_, meaning to give vigor or strength, because, says\r\nd'Arvieux, its most general effect is to fortify and strengthen.\r\nTavernier combats this opinion. Moseley attributes the origin of the\r\nword coffee to Kaffa. Sylvestre de Sacy, in his _Chréstomathie Arabe_,\r\npublished in 1806, thinks that the word _kahwa_, synonymous with\r\n_makli_, roasted in a stove, might very well be the etymology of the\r\nword coffee. D'Alembert in his encyclopedic dictionary, writes the word\r\n_caffé_. Jardin concludes that whatever there may be in these various\r\netymologies, it remains a fact that the word coffee comes from an\r\nArabian word, whether it be _kahua_, _kahoueh_, _kaffa_ or _kahwa_, and\r\nthat the peoples who have adopted the drink have all modified the\r\nArabian word to suit their pronunciation. This is shown by giving the\r\nword as written in various modern languages:\r\n\r\nFrench, _café_; Breton, _kafe_; German, _kaffee_ (coffee tree,\r\n_kaffeebaum_); Dutch, _koffie_ (coffee tree, _koffieboonen_); Danish,\r\n_kaffe_; Finnish, _kahvi_; Hungarian, _kavé_; Bohemian, _kava_; Polish,\r\n_kawa_; Roumanian, _cafea_; Croatian, _kafa_; Servian, _kava_; Russian,\r\n_kophe_; Swedish, _kaffe_; Spanish, _café_; Basque, _kaffia_; Italian,\r\n_caffè_; Portuguese, _café_; Latin (scientific), _coffea_; Turkish,\r\n_kahué_; Greek, _kaféo_; Arabic, _qahwah_ (coffee berry, _bun_);\r\nPersian, _qéhvé_ (coffee berry, _bun_[5]); Annamite, _ca-phé_;\r\nCambodian, _kafé_; Dukni[6], _bunbund_[7]; Teluyan[8], _kapri-vittulu_;\r\nTamil[9], _kapi-kottai_ or _kopi_; Canareze[10], _kapi-bija_; Chinese,\r\n_kia-fey_, _teoutsé_; Japanese, _kéhi_; Malayan, _kawa_, _koppi_;\r\nAbyssinian, _bonn_[11]; Foulak, _legal café_[12]; Sousou, _houri\r\ncaff_[13]; Marquesan, _kapi_; Chinook[14], _kaufee_; Volapuk, _kaf_;\r\nEsperanto, _kafva_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FAIRY BEAUTY OF A COFFEE TREE IN FLOWER]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF COFFEE PROPAGATION\r\n\r\n     _A brief account of the cultivation of the coffee plant in the Old\r\n     World and its introduction into the New--A romantic coffee\r\n     adventure_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the propagation of the coffee plant is closely interwoven\r\nwith that of the early history of coffee drinking, but for the purposes\r\nof this chapter we shall consider only the story of the inception and\r\ngrowth of the cultivation of the coffee tree, or shrub, bearing the\r\nseeds, or berries, from which the drink, coffee, is made.\r\n\r\nCareful research discloses that most authorities agree that the coffee\r\nplant is indigenous to Abyssinia, and probably Arabia, whence its\r\ncultivation spread throughout the tropics. The first reliable mention of\r\nthe properties and uses of the plant is by an Arabian physician toward\r\nthe close of the ninth century A.D., and it is reasonable to suppose\r\nthat before that time the plant was found growing wild in Abyssinia and\r\nperhaps in Arabia. If it be true, as Ludolphus writes,[15] that the\r\nAbyssinians came out of Arabia into Ethiopia in the early ages, it is\r\npossible that they may have brought the coffee tree with them; but the\r\nArabians must still be given the credit for discovering and promoting\r\nthe use of the beverage, and also for promoting the propagation of the\r\nplant, even if they found it in Abyssinia and brought it to Yemen.\r\n\r\nSome authorities believe that the first cultivation of coffee in Yemen\r\ndates back to 575 A.D., when the Persian invasion put an end to the\r\nEthiopian rule of the negus Caleb, who conquered the country in 525.\r\n\r\nCertainly the discovery of the beverage resulted in the cultivation of\r\nthe plant in Abyssinia and in Arabia; but its progress was slow until\r\nthe 15th and 16th centuries, when it appears as intensively carried on\r\nin the Yemen district of Arabia. The Arabians were jealous of their new\r\nfound and lucrative industry, and for a time successfully prevented its\r\nspread to other countries by not permitting any of the precious berries\r\nto leave the country unless they had first been steeped in boiling water\r\nor parched, so as to destroy their powers of germination. It may be that\r\nmany of the early failures successfully to introduce the cultivation of\r\nthe coffee plant into other lands was also due to the fact, discovered\r\nlater, that the seeds soon lose their germinating power.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was not possible to watch every avenue of transport, with\r\nthousands of pilgrims journeying to and from Mecca every year; and so\r\nthere would appear to be some reason to credit the Indian tradition\r\nconcerning the introduction of coffee cultivation into southern India by\r\nBaba Budan, a Moslem pilgrim, as early as 1600, although a better\r\nauthority gives the date as 1695. Indian tradition relates that Baba\r\nBudan planted his seeds near the hut he built for himself at Chickmaglur\r\nin the mountains of Mysore, where, only a few years since, the writer\r\nfound the descendants of these first plants growing under the shade of\r\nthe centuries-old original jungle trees. The greater part of the plants\r\ncultivated by the natives of Kurg and Mysore appear to have come from\r\nthe Baba Budan importation. It was not until 1840 that the English began\r\nthe cultivation of coffee in India. The plantations extend now from the\r\nextreme north of Mysore to Tuticorin.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Early Cultivation by the Dutch_\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the 16th century, German, Italian, and Dutch\r\nbotanists and travelers brought back from the Levant considerable\r\ninformation regarding the new plant and the beverage. In 1614\r\nenterprising Dutch traders began to examine into the possibilities of\r\ncoffee cultivation and coffee trading. In 1616 a coffee plant was\r\nsuccessfully transported from Mocha to Holland. In 1658 the Dutch\r\nstarted the cultivation of coffee in Ceylon, although the Arabs are said\r\nto have brought the plant to the island prior to 1505. In 1670 an\r\nattempt was made to cultivate coffee on European soil at Dijon, France,\r\nbut the result was a failure.\r\n\r\nIn 1696, at the instigation of Nicolaas Witsen, then burgomaster of\r\nAmsterdam, Adrian Van Ommen, commander at Malabar, India, caused to be\r\nshipped from Kananur, Malabar, to Java, the first coffee plants\r\nintroduced into that island. They were grown from seed of the _Coffea\r\narabica_ brought to Malabar from Arabia. They were planted by\r\nGovernor-General Willem Van Outshoorn on the Kedawoeng estate near\r\nBatavia, but were subsequently lost by earthquake and flood. In 1699\r\nHenricus Zwaardecroon imported some slips, or cuttings, of coffee trees\r\nfrom Malabar into Java. These were more successful, and became the\r\nprogenitors of all the coffees of the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch were\r\nthen taking the lead in the propagation of the coffee plant.\r\n\r\nIn 1706 the first samples of Java coffee, and a coffee plant grown in\r\nJava, were received at the Amsterdam botanical gardens. Many plants were\r\nafterward propagated from the seeds produced in the Amsterdam gardens,\r\nand these were distributed to some of the best known botanical gardens\r\nand private conservatories in Europe.\r\n\r\nWhile the Dutch were extending the cultivation of the plant to Sumatra,\r\nthe Celebes, Timor, Bali, and other islands of the Netherlands Indies,\r\nthe French were seeking to introduce coffee cultivation into their\r\ncolonies. Several attempts were made to transfer young plants from the\r\nAmsterdam botanical gardens to the botanical gardens at Paris; but all\r\nwere failures.\r\n\r\nIn 1714, however, as a result of negotiations entered into between the\r\nFrench government and the municipality of Amsterdam, a young and\r\nvigorous plant about five feet tall was sent to Louis XIV at the chateau\r\nof Marly by the burgomaster of Amsterdam. The day following, it was\r\ntransferred to the Jardin des Plantes at Paris, where it was received\r\nwith appropriate ceremonies by Antoine de Jussieu, professor of botany\r\nin charge. This tree was destined to be the progenitor of most of the\r\ncoffees of the French colonies, as well as of those of South America,\r\nCentral America, and Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Romance of Captain Gabriel de Clieu_\r\n\r\nTwo unsuccessful attempts were made to transport to the Antilles plants\r\ngrown from the seed of the tree presented to Louis XIV; but the honor of\r\neventual success was won by a young Norman gentleman, Gabriel Mathieu de\r\nClieu, a naval officer, serving at the time as captain of infantry at\r\nMartinique. The story of de Clieu's achievement is the most romantic\r\nchapter in the history of the propagation of the coffee plant.\r\n\r\nHis personal affairs calling him to France, de Clieu conceived the idea\r\nof utilizing the return voyage to introduce coffee cultivation into\r\nMartinique. His first difficulty lay in obtaining several of the plants\r\nthen being cultivated in Paris, a difficulty at last overcome through\r\nthe instrumentality of M. de Chirac, royal physician, or, according to a\r\nletter written by de Clieu himself, through the kindly offices of a lady\r\nof quality to whom de Chirac could give no refusal. The plants selected\r\nwere kept at Rochefort by M. Bégon, commissary of the department, until\r\nthe departure of de Clieu for Martinique. Concerning the exact date of\r\nde Clieu's arrival at Martinique with the coffee plant, or plants, there\r\nis much conflict of opinion. Some authorities give the date as 1720,\r\nothers 1723. Jardin[16] suggests that the discrepancy in dates may arise\r\nfrom de Clieu, with praiseworthy perseverance, having made the voyage\r\ntwice. The first time, according to Jardin, the plants perished; but the\r\nsecond time de Clieu had planted the seeds when leaving France and these\r\nsurvived, \"due, they say, to his having given of his scanty ration of\r\nwater to moisten them.\" No reference to a preceding voyage, however, is\r\nmade by de Clieu in his own account, given in a letter written to the\r\n_Année Littéraire_[17] in 1774. There is also a difference of opinion as\r\nto whether de Clieu arrived with one or three plants. He himself says\r\n\"one\" in the letter referred to.\r\n\r\nAccording to the most trustworthy data, de Clieu embarked at Nantes,\r\n1723.[18] He had installed his precious plant in a box covered with a\r\nglass frame in order to absorb the rays of the sun and thus better to\r\nretain the stored-up heat for cloudy days. Among the passengers one man,\r\nenvious of the young officer, did all in his power to wrest from him the\r\nglory of success. Fortunately his dastardly attempt failed of its\r\nintended effect.\r\n\r\n\"It is useless,\" writes de Clieu in his letter to the _Année\r\nLittéraire_, \"to recount in detail the infinite care that I was obliged\r\nto bestow upon this delicate plant during a long voyage, and the\r\ndifficulties I had in saving it from the hands of a man who, basely\r\njealous of the joy I was about to taste through being of service to my\r\ncountry, and being unable to get this coffee plant away from me, tore\r\noff a branch.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPTAIN DE CLIEU SHARES HIS DRINKING WATER WITH THE\r\nCOFFEE PLANT HE IS CARRYING TO MARTINIQUE]\r\n\r\nThe vessel carrying de Clieu was a merchantman, and many were the trials\r\nthat beset passengers and crew. Narrowly escaping capture by a corsair\r\nof Tunis, menaced by a violent tempest that threatened to annihilate\r\nthem, they finally encountered a calm that proved more appalling than\r\neither. The supply of drinking water was well nigh exhausted, and what\r\nwas left was rationed for the remainder of the voyage.\r\n\r\n\"Water was lacking to such an extent,\" says de Clieu, \"that for more\r\nthan a month I was obliged to share the scanty ration of it assigned to\r\nme with this my coffee plant upon which my happiest hopes were founded\r\nand which was the source of my delight. It needed such succor the more\r\nin that it was extremely backward, being no larger than the slip of a\r\npink.\" Many stories have been written and verses sung recording and\r\nglorifying this generous sacrifice that has given luster to the name of\r\nde Clieu.\r\n\r\nArrived in Martinique, de Clieu planted his precious slip on his estate\r\nin Prêcheur, one of the cantons of the island; where, says Raynal, \"it\r\nmultiplied with extraordinary rapidity and success.\" From the seedlings\r\nof this plant came most of the coffee trees of the Antilles. The first\r\nharvest was gathered in 1726.\r\n\r\nDe Clieu himself describes his arrival as follows:\r\n\r\n     Arriving at home, my first care was to set out my plant with great\r\n     attention in the part of my garden most favorable to its growth.\r\n     Although keeping it in view, I feared many times that it would be\r\n     taken from me; and I was at last obliged to surround it with thorn\r\n     bushes and to establish a guard about it until it arrived at\r\n     maturity ... this precious plant which had become still more dear\r\n     to me for the dangers it had run and the cares it had cost me.\r\n\r\nThus the little stranger thrived in a distant land, guarded day and\r\nnight by faithful slaves. So tiny a plant to produce in the end all the\r\nrich estates of the West India islands and the regions bordering on the\r\nGulf of Mexico! What luxuries, what future comforts and delights,\r\nresulted from this one small talent confided to the care of a man of\r\nrare vision and fine intellectual sympathy, fired by the spirit of real\r\nlove for his fellows! There is no instance in the history of the French\r\npeople of a good deed done by stealth being of greater service to\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nDe Clieu thus describes the events that followed fast upon the\r\nintroduction of coffee into Martinique, with particular reference to\r\nthe earthquake of 1727:\r\n\r\n     Success exceeded my hopes. I gathered about two pounds of seed\r\n     which I distributed among all those whom I thought most capable of\r\n     giving the plants the care necessary to their prosperity.\r\n\r\n     The first harvest was very abundant; with the second it was\r\n     possible to extend the cultivation prodigiously, but what favored\r\n     multiplication, most singularly, was the fact that two years\r\n     afterward all the cocoa trees of the country, which were the\r\n     resource and occupation of the people, were uprooted and totally\r\n     destroyed by horrible tempests accompanied by an inundation which\r\n     submerged all the land where these trees were planted, land which\r\n     was at once made into coffee plantations by the natives. These did\r\n     marvelously and enabled us to send plants to Santo Domingo,\r\n     Guadeloupe, and other adjacent islands, where since that time they\r\n     have been cultivated with the greatest success.\r\n\r\nBy 1777 there were 18,791,680 coffee trees in Martinique.\r\n\r\nDe Clieu was born in Angléqueville-sur-Saane, Seine-Inférieure\r\n(Normandy), in 1686 or 1688.[19] In 1705 he was a ship's ensign; in 1718\r\nhe became a chevalier of St. Louis; in 1720 he was made a captain of\r\ninfantry; in 1726, a major of infantry; in 1733 he was a ship's\r\nlieutenant; in 1737 he became governor of Guadeloupe; in 1746 he was a\r\nship's captain; in 1750 he was made honorary commander of the order of\r\nSt. Louis; in 1752 he retired with a pension of 6000 francs; in 1753 he\r\nre-entered the naval service; in 1760 he again retired with a pension of\r\n2000 francs.\r\n\r\nIn 1746 de Clieu, having returned to France, was presented to Louis XV\r\nby the minister of marine, Rouillé de Jour, as \"a distinguished officer\r\nto whom the colonies, as well as France itself, and commerce generally,\r\nare indebted for the cultivation of coffee.\"\r\n\r\nReports to the king in 1752 and 1759 recall his having carried the first\r\ncoffee plant to Martinique, and that he had ever been distinguished for\r\nhis zeal and disinterestedness. In the _Mercure de France_, December,\r\n1774, was the following death notice:\r\n\r\n     Gabriel d'Erchigny de Clieu, former Ship's Captain and Honorary\r\n     Commander of the Royal and Military Order of Saint Louis, died in\r\n     Paris on the 30th of November in the 88th year of his age.\r\n\r\nA notice of his death appeared also in the _Gazette de France_ for\r\nDecember 5, 1774, a rare honor in both cases; and it has been said that\r\nat this time his praise was again on every lip.\r\n\r\nOne French historian, Sidney Daney,[20] records that de Clieu died in\r\npoverty at St. Pierre at the age of 97; but this must be an error,\r\nalthough it does not anywhere appear that at his death he was possessed\r\nof much, if any, means. Daney says:\r\n\r\n     This generous man received as his sole recompense for a noble deed\r\n     the satisfaction of seeing this plant for whose preservation he had\r\n     shown such devotion, prosper throughout the Antilles. The\r\n     illustrious de Clieu is among those to whom Martinique owes a\r\n     brilliant reparation.\r\n\r\nDaney tells also that in 1804 there was a movement in Martinique to\r\nerect a monument upon the spot where de Clieu planted his first coffee\r\nplant, but that the undertaking came to naught.\r\n\r\nPardon, in his _La Martinique_ says:\r\n\r\n     Honor to this brave man! He has deserved it from the people of two\r\n     hemispheres. His name is worthy of a place beside that of\r\n     Parmentier who carried to France the potato of Canada. These two\r\n     men have rendered immense service to humanity, and their memory\r\n     should never be forgotten--yet alas! Are they even remembered?\r\n\r\nTussac, in his _Flora de las Antillas_, writing of de Clieu, says,\r\n\"Though no monument be erected to this beneficent traveler, yet his name\r\nshould remain engraved in the heart of every colonist.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1774 the _Année Littéraire_ published a long poem in de Clieu's\r\nhonor. In the feuilleton of the _Gazette de France_, April 12, 1816, we\r\nread that M. Donns, a wealthy Hollander, and a coffee connoisseur,\r\nsought to honor de Clieu by having painted upon a porcelain service all\r\nthe details of his voyage and its happy results. \"I have seen the cups,\"\r\nsays the writer, who gives many details and the Latin inscription.\r\n\r\nThat singer of navigation, Esménard, has pictured de Clieu's devotion in\r\nthe following lines:\r\n\r\nForget not how de Clieu with his light vessel's sail,\r\nBrought distant Moka's gift--that timid plant and frail.\r\nThe waves fell suddenly, young zephyrs breathed no more,\r\nBeneath fierce Cancer's fires behold the fountain store,\r\nExhausted, fails; while now inexorable need\r\nMakes her unpitying law--with measured dole obeyed.\r\n\r\nNow each soul fears to prove Tantalus torment first.\r\nDe Clieu alone defies: While still that fatal thirst,\r\nFierce, stifling, day by day his noble strength devours,\r\nAnd still a heaven of brass inflames the burning hours.\r\nWith that refreshing draught his life he will not cheer;\r\nBut drop by drop revives the plant he holds more dear.\r\nAlready as in dreams, he sees great branches grow,\r\nOne look at his dear plant assuages all his woe.\r\n\r\nThe only memorial to de Clieu in Martinique is the botanical garden at\r\nFort de France, which was opened in 1918 and dedicated to de Clieu,\r\n\"whose memory has been too long left in oblivion.[21]\"\r\n\r\nIn 1715 coffee cultivation was first introduced into Haiti and Santo\r\nDomingo. Later came hardier plants from Martinique. In 1715-17 the\r\nFrench Company of the Indies introduced the cultivation of the plant\r\ninto the Isle of Bourbon (now Réunion) by a ship captain named\r\nDufougeret-Grenier from St. Malo. It did so well that nine years later\r\nthe island began to export coffee.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch brought the cultivation of coffee to Surinam in 1718. The\r\nfirst coffee plantation in Brazil was started at Pará in 1723 with\r\nplants brought from French Guiana, but it was not a success. The English\r\nbrought the plant to Jamaica in 1730. In 1740 Spanish missionaries\r\nintroduced coffee cultivation into the Philippines from Java. In 1748\r\nDon José Antonio Gelabert introduced coffee into Cuba, bringing the seed\r\nfrom Santo Domingo. In 1750 the Dutch extended the cultivation of the\r\nplant to the Celebes. Coffee was introduced into Guatemala about\r\n1750-60. The intensive cultivation in Brazil dates from the efforts\r\nbegun in the Portuguese colonies in Pará and Amazonas in 1752. Porto\r\nRico began the cultivation of coffee about 1755. In 1760 João Alberto\r\nCastello Branco brought to Rio de Janeiro a coffee tree from Goa,\r\nPortuguese India. The news spread that the soil and climate of Brazil\r\nwere particularly adapted to the cultivation of coffee. Molke, a Belgian\r\nmonk, presented some seeds to the Capuchin monastery at Rio in 1774.\r\nLater, the bishop of Rio, Joachim Bruno, became a patron of the plant\r\nand encouraged its propagation in Rio, Minãs, Espirito Santo, and São\r\nPaulo. The Spanish voyager, Don Francisco Xavier Navarro, is credited\r\nwith the introduction of coffee into Costa Rica from Cuba in 1779. In\r\nVenezuela the industry was started near Caracas by a priest, José\r\nAntonio Mohedano, with seed brought from Martinique in 1784.\r\n\r\nCoffee cultivation in Mexico began in 1790, the seed being brought from\r\nthe West Indies. In 1817 Don Juan Antonio Gomez instituted intensive\r\ncultivation in the State of Vera Cruz. In 1825 the cultivation of the\r\nplant was begun in the Hawaiian Islands with seeds from Rio de Janeiro.\r\nAs previously noted, the English began to cultivate coffee in India in\r\n1840. In 1852 coffee cultivation was begun in Salvador with plants\r\nbrought from Cuba. In 1878 the English began the propagation of coffee\r\nin British Central Africa, but it was not until 1901 that coffee\r\ncultivation was introduced into British East Africa from Réunion. In\r\n1887 the French introduced the plant into Tonkin, Indo-China. Coffee\r\ngrowing in Queensland, introduced in 1896, has been successful in a\r\nsmall way.\r\n\r\nIn recent years several attempts have been made to propagate the coffee\r\nplant in the southern United States, but without success. It is\r\nbelieved, however, that the topographic and climatic conditions in\r\nsouthern California are favorable for its cultivation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OMAR AND THE MARVELOUS COFFEE BIRD]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KALDI AND HIS DANCING GOATS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LEGENDARY DISCOVERY OF THE COFFEE DRINK\r\n\r\nFrom drawings by a modern French artist]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nEARLY HISTORY OF COFFEE DRINKING\r\n\r\n     _Coffee in the Near East in the early centuries--Stories of its\r\n     origin--Discovery by physicians and adoption by the Church--Its\r\n     spread through Arabia, Persia and Turkey--Persecutions and\r\n     intolerances--Early coffee manners and customs_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coffee drink had its rise in the classical period of Arabian\r\nmedicine, which dates from Rhazes (Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Zakariya El\r\nRazi) who followed the doctrines of Galen and sat at the feet of\r\nHippocrates. Rhazes (850-922) was the first to treat medicine in an\r\nencyclopedic manner, and, according to some authorities, the first\r\nwriter to mention coffee. He assumed the poetical name of Razi because\r\nhe was a native of the city of Raj in Persian Irak. He was a great\r\nphilosopher and astronomer, and at one time was superintendent of the\r\nhospital at Bagdad. He wrote many learned books on medicine and surgery,\r\nbut his principal work is _Al-Haiwi_, or _The Continent_, a collection\r\nof everything relating to the cure of disease from Galen to his own\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nPhilippe Sylvestre Dufour (1622-87)[22], a French coffee merchant,\r\nphilosopher, and writer, in an accurate and finished treatise on coffee,\r\ntells us (see the early edition of the work translated from the Latin)\r\nthat the first writer to mention the properties of the coffee bean under\r\nthe name of _bunchum_ was this same Rhazes, \"in the ninth century after\r\nthe birth of our Saviour\"; from which (if true) it would appear that\r\ncoffee has been known for upwards of 1000 years. Robinson[23], however,\r\nis of the opinion that _bunchum_ meant something else and had nothing to\r\ndo with coffee. Dufour, himself, in a later edition of his _Traitez\r\nNouveaux et Curieux du Café_ (the Hague, 1693) is inclined to admit that\r\n_bunchum_ may have been a root and not coffee, after all; however, he is\r\ncareful to add that there is no doubt that the Arabs knew coffee as far\r\nback as the year 800. Other, more modern authorities, place it as early\r\nas the sixth century.\r\n\r\n_Wiji Kawih_ is mentioned in a Kavi (Javan) inscription A.D. 856; and it\r\nis thought that the \"bean broth\" in David Tapperi's list of Javanese\r\nbeverages (1667-82) may have been coffee[24].\r\n\r\nWhile the true origin of coffee drinking may be forever hidden among the\r\nmysteries of the purple East, shrouded as it is in legend and fable,\r\nscholars have marshaled sufficient facts to prove that the beverage was\r\nknown in Ethiopia \"from time immemorial,\" and there is much to add\r\nverisimilitude to Dufour's narrative. This first coffee merchant-prince,\r\nskilled in languages and polite learning, considered that his character\r\nas a merchant was not inconsistent with that of an author; and he even\r\nwent so far as to say there were some things (for instance, coffee) on\r\nwhich a merchant could be better informed than a philosopher.\r\n\r\nGranting that by _bunchum_ Rhazes meant coffee, the plant and the drink\r\nmust have been known to his immediate followers; and this, indeed, seems\r\nto be indicated by similar references in the writings of Avicenna (Ibn\r\nSina), the Mohammedan physician and philosopher, who lived from 980 to\r\n1037 A.D.\r\n\r\nRhazes, in the quaint language of Dufour, assures us that \"_bunchum_\r\n(coffee) is hot and dry and very good for the stomach.\" Avicenna\r\nexplains the medicinal properties and uses of the coffee bean (_bon_ or\r\n_bunn_), which he, also, calls _bunchum_, after this fashion:\r\n\r\n     As to the choice thereof, that of a lemon color, light, and of a\r\n     good smell, is the best; the white and the heavy is naught. It is\r\n     hot and dry in the first degree, and, according to others, cold in\r\n     the first degree. It fortifies the members, it cleans the skin, and\r\n     dries up the humidities that are under it, and gives an excellent\r\n     smell to all the body.\r\n\r\nThe early Arabians called the bean and the tree that bore it, _bunn_;\r\nthe drink, _bunchum_. A. Galland[25] (1646-1715), the French Orientalist\r\nwho first analyzed and translated from the Arabic the Abd-al-Kâdir\r\nmanuscript[26], the oldest document extant telling of the origin of\r\ncoffee, observes that Avicenna speaks of the _bunn_, or coffee; as do\r\nalso Prospero Alpini and Veslingius (Vesling). Bengiazlah, another great\r\nphysician, contemporary with Avicenna, likewise mentions coffee; by\r\nwhich, says Galland, one may see that we are indebted to physicians for\r\nthe discovery of coffee, as well as of sugar, tea, and chocolate.\r\n\r\nRauwolf[27] (d. 1596), German physician and botanist, and the first\r\nEuropean to mention coffee, who became acquainted with the beverage in\r\nAleppo in 1573, telling how the drink was prepared by the Turks, says:\r\n\r\n     In this same water they take a fruit called _Bunnu_, which in its\r\n     bigness, shape, and color is almost like unto a bayberry, with two\r\n     thin shells surrounded, which, as they informed me, are brought\r\n     from the _Indies_; but as these in themselves are, and have within\r\n     them, two yellowish grains in two distinct cells, and besides,\r\n     being they agree in their virtue, figure, looks, and name with the\r\n     _Bunchum_ of Avicenna and _Bunco_, of _Rasis ad Almans_ exactly:\r\n     therefore I take them to be the same.\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Edward Pocoke's translation (Oxford, 1659) of _The Nature of the\r\nDrink Kauhi, or Coffee, and the Berry of which it is Made, Described by\r\nan Arabian Phisitian_, we read:\r\n\r\n     _Bun_ is a plant in _Yaman_ [Yemen], which is planted in _Adar_,\r\n     and groweth up and is gathered in _Ab_. It is about a cubit high,\r\n     on a stalk about the thickness of one's thumb. It flowers white,\r\n     leaving a berry like a small nut, but that sometimes it is broad\r\n     like a bean; and when it is peeled, parteth in two. The best of it\r\n     is that which is weighty and yellow; the worst, that which is\r\n     black. It is hot in the first degree, dry in the second: it is\r\n     usually reported to be cold and dry, but it is not so; for it is\r\n     bitter, and whatsoever is bitter is hot. It may be that the scorce\r\n     is hot, and the Bun it selfe either of equall temperature, or cold\r\n     in the first degree.\r\n\r\n     That which makes for its coldnesse is its stipticknesse. In summer\r\n     it is by experience found to conduce to the drying of rheumes, and\r\n     flegmatick coughes and distillations, and the opening of\r\n     obstructions, and the provocation of urin. It is now known by the\r\n     name of _Kohwah_. When it is dried and thoroughly boyled, it\r\n     allayes the ebullition of the blood, is good against the small poxe\r\n     and measles, the bloudy pimples; yet causeth vertiginous headheach,\r\n     and maketh lean much, occasioneth waking, and the Emrods, and\r\n     asswageth lust, and sometimes breeds melancholly.\r\n\r\n     He that would drink it for livelinesse sake, and to discusse\r\n     slothfulnesse, and the other properties that we have mentioned, let\r\n     him use much sweat meates with it, and oyle of pistaccioes, and\r\n     butter. Some drink it with milk, but it is an error, and such as\r\n     may bring in danger of the leprosy.\r\n\r\nDufour concludes that the coffee beans of commerce are the same as the\r\n_bunchum_ (_bunn_) described by Avicenna and the _bunca_ (_bunchum_) of\r\nRhazes. In this he agrees, almost word for word, with Rauwolf,\r\nindicating no change in opinion among the learned in a hundred years.\r\n\r\nChristopher Campen thinks Hippocrates, father of medicine, knew and\r\nadministered coffee.\r\n\r\nRobinson, commenting upon the early adoption of coffee into materia\r\nmedica, charges that it was a mistake on the part of the Arab\r\nphysicians, and that it originated the prejudice that caused coffee to\r\nbe regarded as a powerful drug instead of as a simple and refreshing\r\nbeverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Homer, the Bible, and Coffee_\r\n\r\nIn early Grecian and Roman writings no mention is made of either the\r\ncoffee plant or the beverage made from the berries. Pierre (Pietro)\r\nDelia Valle[28] (1586-1652), however, maintains that the _nepenthe_,\r\nwhich Homer says Helen brought with her out of Egypt, and which she\r\nemployed as surcease for sorrow, was nothing else but coffee mixed with\r\nwine.[29] This is disputed by M. Petit, a well known physician of Paris,\r\nwho died in 1687. Several later British authors, among them, Sandys,\r\nthe poet; Burton; and Sir Henry Blount, have suggested the probability\r\nof coffee being the \"black broth\" of the Lacedæmonians.\r\n\r\nGeorge Paschius, in his Latin treatise of the _New Discoveries Made\r\nsince the Time of the Ancients_, printed at Leipsic in 1700, says he\r\nbelieves that coffee was meant by the five measures of parched corn\r\nincluded among the presents Abigail made to David to appease his wrath,\r\nas recorded in the _Bible_, 1 Samuel, xxv, 18. The _Vulgate_ translates\r\nthe Hebrew words _sein kali_ into _sata polentea_, which signify wheat,\r\nroasted, or dried by fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TITLE PAGE OF DUFOUR'S BOOK, EDITION OF 1693]\r\n\r\nPierre Étienne Louis Dumant, the Swiss Protestant minister and author,\r\nis of the opinion that coffee (and not lentils, as others have supposed)\r\nwas the red pottage for which Esau sold his birthright; also that the\r\nparched grain that Boaz ordered to be given Ruth was undoubtedly roasted\r\ncoffee berries.\r\n\r\nDufour mentions as a possible objection against coffee that \"the use and\r\neating of beans were heretofore forbidden by Pythagoras,\" but intimates\r\nthat the coffee bean of Arabia is something different.\r\n\r\nScheuzer,[30] in his _Physique Sacrée_, says \"the Turks and the Arabs\r\nmake with the coffee bean a beverage which bears the same name, and many\r\npersons use as a substitute the flour of roasted barley.\" From this we\r\nlearn that the coffee substitute is almost as old as coffee itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some Early Legends_\r\n\r\nAfter medicine, the church. There are several Mohammedan traditions that\r\nhave persisted through the centuries, claiming for \"the faithful\" the\r\nhonor and glory of the first use of coffee as a beverage. One of these\r\nrelates how, about 1258 A.D., Sheik Omar, a disciple of Sheik Abou'l\r\nhasan Schadheli, patron saint and legendary founder of Mocha, by chance\r\ndiscovered the coffee drink at Ousab in Arabia, whither he had been\r\nexiled for a certain moral remissness.\r\n\r\nFacing starvation, he and his followers were forced to feed upon the\r\nberries growing around them. And then, in the words of the faithful Arab\r\nchronicle in the Bibliothéque Nationale at Paris, \"having nothing to eat\r\nexcept coffee, they took of it and boiled it in a saucepan and drank of\r\nthe decoction.\" Former patients in Mocha who sought out the good\r\ndoctor-priest in his Ousab retreat, for physic with which to cure their\r\nills, were given some of this decoction, with beneficial effect. As a\r\nresult of the stories of its magical properties, carried back to the\r\ncity, Sheik Omar was invited to return in triumph to Mocha where the\r\ngovernor caused to be built a monastery for him and his companions.\r\n\r\nAnother version of this Oriental legend gives it as follows:\r\n\r\n     The dervish Hadji Omar was driven by his enemies out of Mocha into\r\n     the desert, where they expected he would die of starvation. This\r\n     undoubtedly would have occurred if he had not plucked up courage to\r\n     taste some strange berries which he found growing on a shrub. While\r\n     they seemed to be edible, they were very bitter; and he tried to\r\n     improve the taste by roasting them. He found, however, that they\r\n     had become very hard, so he attempted to soften them with water.\r\n     The berries seemed to remain as hard as before, but the liquid\r\n     turned brown, and Omar drank it on the chance that it contained\r\n     some of the nourishment from the berries. He was amazed at how it\r\n     refreshed him, enlivened his sluggishness, and raised his drooping\r\n     spirits. Later, when he returned to Mocha, his salvation was\r\n     considered a miracle. The beverage to which it was due sprang into\r\n     high favor, and Omar himself was made a saint.\r\n\r\nA popular and much-quoted version of Omar's discovery of coffee, also\r\nbased upon the Abd-al-Kâdir manuscript, is the following:\r\n\r\n     In the year of the Hegira 656, the mollah Schadheli went on a\r\n     pilgrimage to Mecca. Arriving at the mountain of the Emeralds\r\n     (Ousab), he turned to his disciple Omar and said: \"I shall die in\r\n     this place. When my soul has gone forth, a veiled person will\r\n     appear to you. Do not fail to execute the command which he will\r\n     give you.\"\r\n\r\n     The venerable Schadheli being dead, Omar saw in the middle of the\r\n     night a gigantic specter covered by a white veil.\r\n\r\n     \"Who are you?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n     The phantom drew back his veil, and Omar saw with surprise\r\n     Schadheli himself, grown ten cubits since his death. The mollah dug\r\n     in the ground, and water miraculously appeared. The spirit of his\r\n     teacher bade Omar fill a bowl with the water and to proceed on his\r\n     way and not to stop till he reached the spot where the water would\r\n     stop moving.\r\n\r\n     \"It is there,\" he added, \"that a great destiny awaits you.\"\r\n\r\n     Omar started his journey. Arriving at Mocha in Yemen, he noticed\r\n     that the water was immovable. It was here that he must stop.\r\n\r\n     The beautiful village of Mocha was then ravaged by the plague. Omar\r\n     began to pray for the sick and, as the saintly man was close to\r\n     Mahomet, many found themselves cured by his prayers.\r\n\r\n     The plague meanwhile progressing, the daughter of the King of Mocha\r\n     fell ill and her father had her carried to the home of the dervish\r\n     who cured her. But as this young princess was of rare beauty, after\r\n     having cured her, the good dervish tried to carry her off. The king\r\n     did not fancy this new kind of reward. Omar was driven from the\r\n     city and exiled on the mountain of Ousab, with herbs for food and a\r\n     cave for a home.\r\n\r\n     \"Oh, Schadheli, my dear master,\" cried the unfortunate dervish one\r\n     day; \"if the things which happened to me at Mocha were destined,\r\n     was it worth the trouble to give me a bowl to come here?\"\r\n\r\n     To these just complaints, there was heard immediately a song of\r\n     incomparable harmony, and a bird of marvelous plumage came to rest\r\n     in a tree. Omar sprang forward quickly toward the little bird which\r\n     sang so well, but then he saw on the branches of the tree only\r\n     flowers and fruit. Omar laid hands on the fruit, and found it\r\n     delicious. Then he filled his great pockets with it and went back\r\n     to his cave. As he was preparing to boil a few herbs for his\r\n     dinner, the idea came to him of substituting for this sad soup,\r\n     some of his harvested fruit. From it he obtained a savory and\r\n     perfumed drink; it was coffee.\r\n\r\nThe Italian _Journal of the Savants_ for the year 1760 says that two\r\nmonks, Scialdi and Ayduis, were the first to discover the properties of\r\ncoffee, and for this reason became the object of special prayers. \"Was\r\nnot this Scialdi identical with the Sheik Schadheli?\" asks Jardin.[31]\r\n\r\nThe most popular legend ascribes the discovery of the drink to an\r\nArabian herdsman in upper Egypt, or Abyssinia, who complained to the\r\nabbot of a neighboring monastery that the goats confided to his care\r\nbecame unusually frolicsome after eating the berries of certain shrubs\r\nfound near their feeding grounds. The abbot, having observed the fact,\r\ndetermined to try the virtues of the berries on himself. He, too,\r\nresponded with a new exhilaration. Accordingly, he directed that some be\r\nboiled, and the decoction drunk by his monks, who thereafter found no\r\ndifficulty in keeping awake during the religious services of the night.\r\nThe abbé Massieu in his poem, _Carmen Caffaeum_, thus celebrates the\r\nevent:\r\n\r\nThe monks each in turn, as the evening draws near,\r\nDrink 'round the great cauldron--a circle of cheer!\r\nAnd the dawn in amaze, revisiting that shore,\r\nOn idle beds of ease surprised them nevermore!\r\n\r\nAccording to the legend, the news of the \"wakeful monastery\" spread\r\nrapidly, and the magical berry soon \"came to be in request throughout\r\nthe whole kingdom; and in progress of time other nations and provinces\r\nof the East fell into the use of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe French have preserved the following picturesque version of this\r\nlegend:\r\n\r\n     A young goatherd named Kaldi noticed one day that his goats, whose\r\n     deportment up to that time had been irreproachable, were abandoning\r\n     themselves to the most extravagant prancings. The venerable buck,\r\n     ordinarily so dignified and solemn, bounded about like a young kid.\r\n     Kaldi attributed this foolish gaiety to certain fruits of which the\r\n     goats had been eating with delight.\r\n\r\n     The story goes that the poor fellow had a heavy heart; and in the\r\n     hope of cheering himself up a little, he thought he would pick and\r\n     eat of the fruit. The experiment succeeded marvelously. He forgot\r\n     his troubles and became the happiest herder in happy Arabia. When\r\n     the goats danced, he gaily made himself one of the party, and\r\n     entered into their fun with admirable spirit.\r\n\r\n     One day, a monk chanced to pass by and stopped in surprise to find\r\n     a ball going on. A score of goats were executing lively pirouettes\r\n     like a ladies' chain, while the buck solemnly _balancé-ed_, and the\r\n     herder went through the figures of an eccentric pastoral dance.\r\n\r\n     The astonished monk inquired the cause of this saltatorial madness;\r\n     and Kaldi told him of his precious discovery.\r\n\r\n     Now, this poor monk had a great sorrow; he always went to sleep in\r\n     the middle of his prayers; and he reasoned that Mohammed without\r\n     doubt was revealing this marvelous fruit to him to overcome his\r\n     sleepiness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARAB DRINKING COFFEE; CHINAMAN, TEA; AND INDIAN,\r\nCHOCOLATE\r\n\r\nFrontispiece from Dufour's work]\r\n\r\n     Piety does not exclude gastronomic instincts. Those of our good\r\n     monk were more than ordinary; because he thought of drying and\r\n     boiling the fruit of the herder. This ingenious concoction gave us\r\n     coffee. Immediately all the monks of the realm made use of the\r\n     drink, because it encouraged them to pray and, perhaps, also\r\n     because it was not disagreeable.\r\n\r\nIn those early days it appears that the drink was prepared in two ways;\r\none in which the decoction was made from the hull and the pulp\r\nsurrounding the bean, and the other from the bean itself. The roasting\r\nprocess came later and is an improvement generally credited to the\r\nPersians. There is evidence that the early Mohammedan churchmen were\r\nseeking a substitute for the wine forbidden to them by the Koran, when\r\nthey discovered coffee. The word for coffee in Arabic, _qahwah_, is the\r\nsame as one of those used for wine; and later on, when coffee drinking\r\ngrew so popular as to threaten the very life of the church itself, this\r\nsimilarity was seized upon by the church-leaders to support their\r\ncontention that the prohibition against wine applied also to coffee.\r\n\r\nLa Roque,[32] writing in 1715, says that the Arabian word _cahouah_\r\nsignified at first only wine; but later was turned into a generic term\r\napplied to all kinds of drink. \"So there were really three sorts of\r\ncoffee; namely, wine, including all intoxicating liquors; the drink made\r\nwith the shells, or cods, of the coffee bean; and that made from the\r\nbean itself.\"\r\n\r\nOriginally, then, the coffee drink may have been a kind of wine made\r\nfrom the coffee fruit. In the coffee countries even today the natives\r\nare very fond, and eat freely, of the ripe coffee cherries, voiding the\r\nseeds. The pulp surrounding the coffee seeds (beans) is pleasant to\r\ntaste, has a sweetish, aromatic flavor, and quickly ferments when\r\nallowed to stand.\r\n\r\nStill another tradition (was the wish father to the thought?) tells how\r\nthe coffee drink was revealed to Mohammed himself by the Angel Gabriel.\r\nCoffee's partisans found satisfaction in a passage in the _Koran_ which,\r\nthey said, foretold its adoption by the followers of the Prophet:\r\n\r\n     They shall be given to drink an excellent wine, sealed; its seal is\r\n     that of the musk.\r\n\r\nThe most diligent research does not carry a knowledge of coffee back\r\nbeyond the time of Rhazes, two hundred years after Mohammed; so there is\r\nlittle more than speculation or conjecture to support the theory that it\r\nwas known to the ancients, in Bible times or in the days of The Praised\r\nOne. Our knowledge of tea, on the other hand, antedates the Christian\r\nera. We know also that tea was intensively cultivated and taxed under\r\nthe Tang dynasty in China, A.D. 793, and that Arab traders knew of it in\r\nthe following century.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The First Reliable Coffee Date_\r\n\r\nAbout 1454 Sheik Gemaleddin Abou Muhammad Bensaid, mufti of Aden,\r\nsurnamed Aldhabani, from Dhabhan, a small town where he was born, became\r\nacquainted with the virtues of coffee on a journey into Abyssinia.[33]\r\nUpon his return to Aden, his health became impaired; and remembering the\r\ncoffee he had seen his countrymen drinking in Abyssinia, he sent for\r\nsome in the hope of finding relief. He not only recovered from his\r\nillness; but, because of its sleep-dispelling qualities, he sanctioned\r\nthe use of the drink among the dervishes \"that they might spend the\r\nnight in prayers or other religious exercises with more attention and\r\npresence of mind.[34]\"\r\n\r\nIt is altogether probable that the coffee drink was known in Aden before\r\nthe time of Sheik Gemaleddin; but the endorsement of the very learned\r\nimam, whom science and religion had already made famous, was sufficient\r\nto start a vogue for the beverage that spread throughout Yemen, and\r\nthence to the far corners of the world. We read in the Arabian\r\nmanuscript at the Bibliothéque Nationale that lawyers, students, as well\r\nas travelers who journeyed at night, artisans, and others, who worked at\r\nnight, to escape the heat of the day, took to drinking coffee; and even\r\nleft off another drink, then becoming popular, made from the leaves of a\r\nplant called _khat_ or _cat_ (_catha edulis_).\r\n\r\nSheik Gemaleddin was assisted in his work of spreading the gospel of\r\nthis the first propaganda for coffee by one Muhammed Alhadrami, a\r\nphysician of great reputation, born in Hadramaut, Arabia Felix.\r\n\r\nA recently unearthed and little known version of coffee's origin shows\r\nhow features of both the Omar tradition and the Gemaleddin story may be\r\ncombined by a professional Occidental tale-writer[35]:\r\n\r\n     Toward the middle of the fifteenth century, a poor Arab was\r\n     traveling in Abyssinia. Finding himself weak and weary, he stopped\r\n     near a grove. For fuel wherewith to cook his rice, he cut down a\r\n     tree that happened to be covered with dried berries. His meal being\r\n     cooked and eaten, the traveler discovered that these half-burnt\r\n     berries were fragrant. He collected a number of them and, on\r\n     crushing them with a stone, found that the aroma was increased to a\r\n     great extent. While wondering at this, he accidentally let the\r\n     substance fall into an earthen vessel that contained his scanty\r\n     supply of water.\r\n\r\n     A miracle! The almost putrid water was purified. He brought it to\r\n     his lips; it was fresh and agreeable; and after a short rest the\r\n     traveler so far recovered his strength and energy as to be able to\r\n     resume his journey. The lucky Arab gathered as many berries as he\r\n     could, and having arrived at Aden, informed the mufti of his\r\n     discovery. That worthy was an inveterate opium-smoker, who had been\r\n     suffering for years from the influence of the poisonous drug. He\r\n     tried an infusion of the roasted berries, and was so delighted at\r\n     the recovery of his former vigor that in gratitude to the tree he\r\n     called it _cahuha_ which in Arabic signifies \"force\".\r\n\r\nGalland, in his analysis of the Arabian manuscript, already referred to,\r\nthat has furnished us with the most trustworthy account of the origin of\r\ncoffee, criticizes Antoine Faustus Nairon, Maronite professor of\r\nOriental languages at Rome, who was the author of the first printed\r\ntreatise on coffee only,[36] for accepting the legends relating to Omar\r\nand the Abyssinian goatherd. He says they are unworthy of belief as\r\nfacts of history, although he is careful to add that there is _some_\r\ntruth in the story of the discovery of coffee by the Abyssinian goats\r\nand the abbot who prescribed the use of the berries for his monks, \"the\r\nEastern Christians being willing to have the honor of the invention of\r\ncoffee, for the abbot, or prior, of the convent and his companions are\r\nonly the mufti Gemaleddin and Muhammid Alhadrami, and the monks are the\r\ndervishes.\"\r\n\r\nAmid all these details, Jardin reaches the conclusion that it is to\r\nchance we must attribute the knowledge of the properties of coffee, and\r\nthat the coffee tree was transported from its native land to Yemen, as\r\nfar as Mecca, and possibly into Persia, before being carried into Egypt.\r\n\r\nCoffee, being thus favorably introduced into Aden, it has continued\r\nthere ever since, without interruption. By degrees the cultivation of\r\nthe plant and the use of the beverage passed into many neighboring\r\nplaces. Toward the close of the fifteenth century (1470-1500) it reached\r\nMecca and Medina, where it was introduced, as at Aden, by the dervishes,\r\nand for the same religious purpose. About 1510 it reached Grand Cairo in\r\nEgypt, where the dervishes from Yemen, living in a district by\r\nthemselves, drank coffee on the nights they intended to spend in\r\nreligious devotion. They kept it in a large red earthen vessel--each in\r\nturn receiving it, respectfully, from their superior, in a small bowl,\r\nwhich he dipped into the jar--in the meantime chanting their prayers,\r\nthe burden of which was always: \"There is no God but one God, the true\r\nKing, whose power is not to be disputed.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BOUQUET OF RIPE FRUIT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOWERS, FRUIT, AND LEAVES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COFFEE TREE BEARS FRUIT, LEAF, AND BLOSSOM AT THE\r\nSAME TIME]\r\n\r\nAfter the dervishes, the bowl was passed to lay members of the\r\ncongregation. In this way coffee came to be so associated with the act\r\nof worship that \"they never performed a religious ceremony in public and\r\nnever observed any solemn festival without taking coffee.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the inhabitants of Mecca became so fond of the beverage that,\r\ndisregarding its religious associations, they made of it a secular drink\r\nto be sipped publicly in _kaveh kanes_, the first coffee houses. Here\r\nthe idle congregated to drink coffee, to play chess and other games, to\r\ndiscuss the news of the day, and to amuse themselves with singing,\r\ndancing, and music, contrary to the manners of the rigid Mahommedans,\r\nwho were very properly scandalized by such performances. In Medina and\r\nin Cairo, too, coffee became as common a drink as in Mecca and Aden.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The First Coffee Persecution_\r\n\r\nAt length the pious Mahommedans began to disapprove of the use of coffee\r\namong the people. For one thing, it made common one of the best\r\npsychology-adjuncts of their religion; also, the joy of life, that it\r\nhelped to liberate among those who frequented the coffee houses,\r\nprecipitated social, political, and religious arguments; and these\r\nfrequently developed into disturbances. Dissensions arose even among the\r\nchurchmen themselves. They divided into camps for and against coffee.\r\nThe law of the Prophet on the subject of wine was variously construed as\r\napplying to coffee.\r\n\r\nAbout this time (1511) Kair Bey was governor of Mecca for the sultan of\r\nEgypt. He appears to have been a strict disciplinarian, but lamentably\r\nignorant of the actual conditions obtaining among his people. As he was\r\nleaving the mosque one evening after prayers, he was offended by seeing\r\nin a corner a company of coffee drinkers who were preparing to pass the\r\nnight in prayer. His first thought was that they were drinking wine; and\r\ngreat was his astonishment when he learned what the liquor really was\r\nand how common was its use throughout the city. Further investigation\r\nconvinced him that indulgence in this exhilarating drink must incline\r\nmen and women to extravagances prohibited by law, and so he determined\r\nto suppress it. First he drove the coffee drinkers out of the mosque.\r\n\r\nThe next day, he called a council of officers of justice, lawyers,\r\nphysicians, priests, and leading citizens, to whom he declared what he\r\nhad seen the evening before at the mosque; and, \"being resolved to put a\r\nstop to the coffee-house abuses, he sought their advice upon the\r\nsubject.\" The chief count in the indictment was that \"in these places\r\nmen and women met and played tambourines, violins, and other musical\r\ninstruments. There were also people who played chess, mankala, and other\r\nsimilar games, for money; and there were many other things done contrary\r\nto our sacred law--may God keep it from all corruption until the day\r\nwhen we shall all appear before him![37]\"\r\n\r\nThe lawyers agreed that the coffee houses needed reforming; but as to\r\nthe drink itself, inquiry should be made as to whether it was in any way\r\nharmful to mind or body; for if not, it might not be sufficient to close\r\nthe places that sold it. It was suggested that the opinion of the\r\nphysicians be sought.\r\n\r\nTwo brothers, Persian physicians named Hakimani, and reputed the best in\r\nMecca, were summoned, although we are told they knew more about logic\r\nthan they did about physic. One of them came into the council fully\r\nprejudiced, as he had already written a book against coffee, and filled\r\nwith concern for his profession, being fearful lest the common use of\r\nthe new drink would make serious inroads on the practise of medicine.\r\nHis brother joined with him in assuring the assembly that the plant\r\n_bunn_, from which coffee was made, was \"cold and dry\" and so\r\nunwholesome. When another physician present reminded them that\r\nBengiazlah, the ancient and respected contemporary of Avicenna, taught\r\nthat it was \"hot and dry,\" they made arbitrary answer that Bengiazlah\r\nhad in mind another plant of the same name, and that anyhow, it was not\r\nmaterial; for, if the coffee drink disposed people to things forbidden\r\nby religion, the safest course for Mahommedans was to look upon it as\r\nunlawful.\r\n\r\nThe friends of coffee were covered with confusion. Only the mufti spoke\r\nout in the meeting in its favor. Others, carried away by prejudice or\r\nmisguided zeal, affirmed that coffee clouded their senses. One man arose\r\nand said it intoxicated like wine; which made every one laugh, since he\r\ncould hardly have been a judge of this if he had not drunk wine, which\r\nis forbidden by the Mohammedan religion. Upon being asked whether he had\r\never drunk any, he was so imprudent as to admit that he had, thereby\r\ncondemning himself out of his own mouth to the bastinado.\r\n\r\nThe mufti of Aden, being both an officer of the court and a divine,\r\nundertook, with some heat, a defense of coffee; but he was clearly in an\r\nunpopular minority. He was rewarded with the reproaches and affronts of\r\nthe religious zealots.\r\n\r\nSo the governor had his way, and coffee was solemnly condemned as thing\r\nforbidden by the law; and a presentment was drawn up, signed by a\r\nmajority of those present, and dispatched post-haste by the governor to\r\nhis royal master, the sultan, at Cairo. At the same time, the governor\r\npublished an edict forbidding the sale of coffee in public or private.\r\nThe officers of justice caused all the coffee houses in Mecca to be\r\nshut, and ordered all the coffee found there, or in the merchants'\r\nwarehouses, to be burned.\r\n\r\nNaturally enough, being an unpopular edict, there were many evasions,\r\nand much coffee drinking took place behind closed doors. Some of the\r\nfriends of coffee were outspoken in their opposition to the order, being\r\nconvinced that the assembly had rendered a judgment not in accordance\r\nwith the facts, and above all, contrary to the opinion of the mufti who,\r\nin every Arab community, is looked up to as the interpreter, or\r\nexpounder, of the law. One man, caught in the act of disobedience,\r\nbesides being severely punished, was also led through the most public\r\nstreets of the city seated on an ass.\r\n\r\nHowever, the triumph of the enemies of coffee was short-lived; for not\r\nonly did the sultan of Cairo disapprove the \"indiscreet zeal\" of the\r\ngovernor of Mecca, and order the edict revoked; but he read him a severe\r\nlesson on the subject. How dared he condemn a thing approved at Cairo,\r\nthe capital of his kingdom, where there were physicians whose opinions\r\ncarried more weight than those of Mecca, and who had found nothing\r\nagainst the law in the use of coffee? The best things might be abused,\r\nadded the sultan, even the sacred waters of Zamzam, but this was no\r\nreason for an absolute prohibition. The fountain, or well, of Zamzam,\r\naccording to the Mohammedan teaching, is the same which God caused to\r\nspring up in the desert to comfort Hagar and Ishmael when Abraham\r\nbanished them. It is in the enclosure of the temple at Mecca; and the\r\nMohammedans drink of it with much show of devotion, ascribing great\r\nvirtues to it.\r\n\r\nIt is not recorded whether the misguided governor was shocked at this\r\nseeming profanity; but it is known that he hastened to obey the orders\r\nof his lord and master. The prohibition was recalled, and thereafter he\r\nemployed his authority only to preserve order in the coffee houses. The\r\nfriends of coffee, and the lovers of poetic justice, found satisfaction\r\nin the governor's subsequent fate. He was exposed as \"an extortioner and\r\na public robber,\" and \"tortured to death,\" his brother killing himself\r\nto avoid the same fate. The two Persian physicians who had played so\r\nmean a part in the first coffee persecution, likewise came to an unhappy\r\nend. Being discredited in Mecca they fled to Cairo, where, in an\r\nunguarded moment, having cursed the person of Selim I, emperor of the\r\nTurks, who had conquered Egypt, they were executed by his order.\r\n\r\nCoffee, being thus re-established at Mecca, met with no opposition until\r\n1524, when, because of renewed disorders, the kadi of the town closed\r\nthe coffee houses, but did not seek to interfere with coffee drinking at\r\nhome and in private. His successor, however, re-licensed them; and,\r\ncontinuing on their good behavior since then, they have not been\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nIn 1542 a ripple was caused by an order issued by Soliman the Great,\r\nforbidding the use of coffee; but no one took it seriously, especially\r\nas it soon became known that the order had been obtained \"by surprise\"\r\nand at the desire of only one of the court ladies \"a little too nice in\r\nthis point.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting facts in the history of the coffee drink is\r\nthat wherever it has been introduced it has spelled revolution. It has\r\nbeen the world's most radical drink in that its function has always been\r\nto make people think. And when the people began to think, they became\r\ndangerous to tyrants and to foes of liberty of thought and action.\r\nSometimes the people became intoxicated with their new found ideas; and,\r\nmistaking liberty for license, they ran amok, and called down upon their\r\nheads persecutions and many petty intolerances. So history repeated\r\nitself in Cairo, twenty-three years after the first Mecca persecution.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee's Second Religious Persecution_\r\n\r\nSelim I, after conquering Egypt, had brought coffee to Constantinople in\r\n1517. The drink continued its progress through Syria, and was received\r\nin Damascus (about 1530), and in Aleppo (about 1532), without\r\nopposition. Several coffee houses of Damascus attained wide fame, among\r\nthem the Café of the Roses, and the Café of the Gate of Salvation.\r\n\r\nIts increasing popularity and, perhaps, the realization that the\r\ncontinued spread of the beverage might lessen the demand for his\r\nservices, caused a physician of Cairo to propound (about 1523) to his\r\nfellows this question:\r\n\r\n     What is your opinion concerning the liquor called coffee which is\r\n     drank in company, as being reckoned in the number of those we have\r\n     free leave to make use of, notwithstanding it is the cause of no\r\n     small disorders, that it flies up into the head and is very\r\n     pernicious to health? Is it permitted or forbidden?\r\n\r\nAt the end he was careful to add, as his own opinion (and without\r\nprejudice?), that coffee was unlawful. To the credit of the physicians\r\nof Cairo as a class, it should be recorded that they looked with\r\nunsympathetic eyes upon this attempt on the part of one of their number\r\nto stir up trouble for a valuable adjunct to their materia medica, and\r\nso the effort died a-borning.\r\n\r\nIf the physicians were disposed to do nothing to stop coffee's progress,\r\nnot so the preachers. As places of resort, the coffee houses exercised\r\nan appeal that proved stronger to the popular mind than that of the\r\ntemples of worship. This to men of sound religious training was\r\nintolerable. The feeling against coffee smouldered for a time; but in\r\n1534 it broke out afresh. In that year a fiery preacher in one of\r\nCairo's mosques so played upon the emotions of his congregation with a\r\npreachment against coffee, claiming that it was against the law and that\r\nthose who drank it were not true Mohammedans, that upon leaving the\r\nbuilding a large number of his hearers, enraged, threw themselves into\r\nthe first coffee house they found in their way, burned the coffee pots\r\nand dishes, and maltreated all the persons they found there.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion was immediately aroused; and the city was divided into\r\ntwo parties; one maintaining that coffee was against the law of\r\nMohammed, and the other taking the contrary view. And then arose a\r\nSolomon in the person of the chief justice, who summoned into his\r\npresence the learned physicians for consultation. Again the medical\r\nprofession stood by its guns. The medical men pointed out to the chief\r\njustice that the question had already been decided by their predecessors\r\non the side of coffee, and that the time had come to put some check \"on\r\nthe furious zeal of the bigots\" and the \"indiscretions of ignorant\r\npreachers.\" Whereupon, the wise judge caused coffee to be served to the\r\nwhole company and drank some himself. By this act he \"re-united the\r\ncontending parties, and brought coffee into greater esteem than ever.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee in Constantinople_\r\n\r\nThe story of the introduction of coffee into Constantinople shows that\r\nit experienced much the same vicissitudes that marked its advent at\r\nMecca and Cairo. There were the same disturbances, the same unreasoning\r\nreligious superstition, the same political hatreds, the same stupid\r\ninterference by the civil authorities; and yet, in spite of it all,\r\ncoffee attained new honors and new fame. The Oriental coffee house\r\nreached its supreme development in Constantinople.\r\n\r\nAlthough coffee had been known in Constantinople since 1517, it was not\r\nuntil 1554 that the inhabitants became acquainted with that great\r\ninstitution of early eastern democracy--the coffee house. In that year,\r\nunder the reign of Soliman the Great, son of Selim I, one Schemsi of\r\nDamascus and one Hekem of Aleppo opened the first two coffee houses in\r\nthe quarter called Taktacalah. They were wonderful institutions for\r\nthose days, remarkable alike for their furnishings and their comforts,\r\nas well as for the opportunity they afforded for social intercourse and\r\nfree discussion. Schemsi and Hekem received their guests on \"very neat\r\ncouches or sofas,\" and the admission was the price of a dish of\r\ncoffee--about one cent.\r\n\r\nTurks, high and low, took up the idea with avidity. Coffee houses\r\nincreased in number. The demand outstripped the supply. In the seraglio\r\nitself special officers (_kahvedjibachi_) were commissioned to prepare\r\nthe coffee drink for the sultan. Coffee was in favor with all classes.\r\n\r\nThe Turks gave to the coffee houses the name _kahveh kanes_\r\n(_diversoria_, Cotovicus called them); and as they grew in popularity,\r\nthey became more and more luxurious. There were lounges, richly\r\ncarpeted; and in addition to coffee, many other means of entertainment.\r\nTo these \"schools of the wise\" came the \"young men ready to enter upon\r\noffices of judicature; kadis from the provinces, seeking re-instatement\r\nor new appointments; muderys, or professors; officers of the seraglio;\r\nbashaws; and the principal lords of the port,\" not to mention merchants\r\nand travelers from all parts of the then known world.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee House Persecutions_\r\n\r\nAbout 1570, just when coffee seemed settled for all time in the social\r\nscheme, the imams and dervishes raised a loud wail against it, saying\r\nthe mosques were almost empty, while the coffee houses were always full.\r\nThen the preachers joined in the clamor, affirming it to be a greater\r\nsin to go to a coffee house than to enter a tavern. The authorities\r\nbegan an examination; and the same old debate was on. This time,\r\nhowever, appeared a mufti who was unfriendly to coffee. The religious\r\nfanatics argued that Mohammed had not even known of coffee, and so could\r\nnot have used the drink, and, therefore, it must be an abomination for\r\nhis followers to do so. Further, coffee was burned and ground to\r\ncharcoal before making a drink of it; and the _Koran_ distinctly forbade\r\nthe use of charcoal, including it among the unsanitary foods. The mufti\r\ndecided the question in favor of the zealots, and coffee was forbidden\r\nby law.\r\n\r\nThe prohibition proved to be more honored in the breach than in the\r\nobservance. Coffee drinking continued in secret, instead of in the open.\r\nAnd when, about 1580, Amurath III, at the further solicitation of the\r\nchurchmen, declared in an edict that coffee should be classed with wine,\r\nand so prohibited in accordance with the law of the Prophet, the people\r\nonly smiled, and persisted in their secret disobedience. Already they\r\nwere beginning to think for themselves on religious as well as political\r\nmatters. The civil officers, finding it useless to try to suppress the\r\ncustom, winked at violations of the law; and, for a consideration,\r\npermitted the sale of coffee privately, so that many Ottoman\r\n\"speak-easies\" sprung up--places where coffee might be had behind shut\r\ndoors; shops where it was sold in back-rooms.\r\n\r\nThis was enough to re-establish the coffee houses by degrees. Then came\r\na mufti less scrupulous or more knowing than his predecessor, who\r\ndeclared that coffee was not to be looked upon as coal, and that the\r\ndrink made from it was not forbidden by the law. There was a general\r\nrenewal of coffee drinking; religious devotees, preachers, lawyers, and\r\nthe mufti himself indulging in it, their example being followed by the\r\nwhole court and the city.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the coffee houses provided a handsome source of revenue to\r\neach succeeding grand vizier; and there was no further interference with\r\nthe beverage until the reign of Amurath IV, when Grand Vizier Kuprili,\r\nduring the war with Candia, decided that for political reasons, the\r\ncoffee houses should be closed. His argument was much the same as that\r\nadvanced more than a hundred years later by Charles II of England,\r\nnamely, that they were hotbeds of sedition. Kuprili was a military\r\ndictator, with nothing of Charles's vacillating nature; and although,\r\nlike Charles, he later rescinded his edict, he enforced it, while it was\r\neffective, in no uncertain fashion. Kuprili was no petty tyrant. For a\r\nfirst violation of the order, cudgeling was the punishment; for a second\r\noffense, the victim was sewn in a leather bag and thrown into the\r\nBosporus. Strangely enough, while he suppressed the coffee houses, he\r\npermitted the taverns, that sold wine forbidden by the _Koran_, to\r\nremain open. Perhaps he found the latter produced a less dangerous kind\r\nof mental stimulation than that produced by coffee. Coffee, says Virey,\r\nwas too intellectual a drink for the fierce and senseless administration\r\nof the pashas.\r\n\r\nEven in those days it was not possible to make people good by law.\r\nParaphrasing the copy-book, suppressed desires will arise, though all\r\nthe world o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes. An unjust law was no more\r\nenforceable in those centuries than it is in the twentieth century. Men\r\nare humans first, although they may become brutish when bereft of\r\nreason. But coffee does not steal away their reason; rather, it sharpens\r\ntheir reasoning faculties. As Galland has truly said: \"Coffee joins men,\r\nborn for society, in a more perfect union; protestations are more\r\nsincere in being made at a time when the mind is not clouded with fumes\r\nand vapors, and therefore not easily forgotten, which too frequently\r\nhappens when made over a bottle.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARACTERISTIC SCENE IN A TURKISH COFFEE HOUSE OF THE\r\nSEVENTEENTH CENTURY]\r\n\r\nDespite the severe penalties staring them in the face, violations of the\r\nlaw were plentiful among the people of Constantinople. Venders of the\r\nbeverage appeared in the market-places with \"large copper vessels with\r\nfire under them; and those who had a mind to drink were invited to step\r\ninto any neighboring shop where every one was welcome on such an\r\naccount.\"\r\n\r\nLater, Kuprili, having assured himself that the coffee houses were no\r\nlonger a menace to his policies, permitted the free use of the beverage\r\nthat he had previously forbidden.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee and Coffee Houses in Persia_\r\n\r\nSome writers claim for Persia the discovery of the coffee drink; but\r\nthere is no evidence to support the claim. There are, however,\r\nsufficient facts to justify a belief that here, as in Ethiopia, coffee\r\nhas been known from time immemorial--which is a very convenient phrase.\r\nAt an early date the coffee house became an established institution in\r\nthe chief towns. The Persians appear to have used far more intelligence\r\nthan the Turks in handling the political phase of the coffee-house\r\nquestion, and so it never became necessary to order them suppressed in\r\nPersia.\r\n\r\nThe wife of Shah Abbas, observing that great numbers of people were wont\r\nto gather and to talk politics in the leading coffee house of Ispahan,\r\nappointed a mollah--an ecclesiastical teacher and expounder of the\r\nlaw--to sit there daily to entertain the frequenters of the place with\r\nnicely turned points of history, law, and poetry. Being a man of wisdom\r\nand great tact, he avoided controversial questions of state; and so\r\npolitics were kept in the background. He proved a welcome visitor, and\r\nwas made much of by the guests. This example was generally followed, and\r\nas a result disturbances were rare in the coffee houses of Ispahan.\r\n\r\nAdam Olearius[38] (1599-1671), who was secretary to the German Embassy\r\nthat traveled in Turkey in 1633-36, tells of the great diversions made\r\nin Persian coffee houses \"by their poets and historians, who are seated\r\nin a high chair from whence they make speeches and tell satirical\r\nstories, playing in the meantime with a little stick and using the same\r\ngestures as our jugglers and legerdemain men do in England.\"\r\n\r\nAt court conferences conspicuous among the shah's retinue were always to\r\nbe seen the \"kahvedjibachi,\" or \"coffee-pourers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Early Coffee Manners and Customs_\r\n\r\nKarstens Niebuhr[39] (1733-1815), the Hanoverian traveler, furnishes the\r\nfollowing description of the early Arabian, Syrian, and Egyptian coffee\r\nhouses:\r\n\r\n     They are commonly large halls, having their floors spread with\r\n     mats, and illuminated at night by a multitude of lamps. Being the\r\n     only theaters for the exercise of profane eloquence, poor scholars\r\n     attend here to amuse the people. Select portions are read, _e.g._\r\n     the adventures of Rustan Sal, a Persian hero. Some aspire to the\r\n     praise of invention, and compose tales and fables. They walk up and\r\n     down as they recite, or assuming oratorial consequence, harangue\r\n     upon subjects chosen by themselves.\r\n\r\n     In one coffee house at Damascus an orator was regularly hired to\r\n     tell his stories at a fixed hour; in other cases he was more\r\n     directly dependant upon the taste of his hearers, as at the\r\n     conclusion of his discourse, whether it had consisted of literary\r\n     topics or of loose and idle tales, he looked to the audience for a\r\n     voluntary contribution.\r\n\r\n     At Aleppo, again, there was a man with a soul above the common,\r\n     who, being a person of distinction, and one that studied merely for\r\n     his own pleasure, had yet gone the round of all the coffee houses\r\n     in the city to pronounce moral harangues.\r\n\r\nIn some coffee houses there were singers and dancers, as before, and\r\nmany came to listen to the marvelous tales, of the _Thousand and One\r\nNights_.\r\n\r\nIn Oriental countries it was once the custom to offer a cup of \"bad\r\ncoffee,\" i.e., coffee containing poison, to those functionaries or other\r\npersons who had proven themselves embarrassing to the authorities.\r\n\r\nWhile coffee drinking started as a private religious function, it was\r\nnot long after its introduction by the coffee houses that it became\r\nsecularized still more in the homes of the people, although for\r\ncenturies it retained a certain religious significance. Galland says\r\nthat in Constantinople, at the time of his visit to the city, there was\r\nno house, rich or poor, Turk or Jew, Greek or Armenian, where it was not\r\ndrunk at least twice a day, and many drank it oftener, for it became a\r\ncustom in every house to offer it to all visitors; and it was considered\r\nan incivility to refuse it. Twenty dishes a day, per person, was not an\r\nuncommon average.\r\n\r\nGalland observes that \"as much money must be spent in the private\r\nfamilies of Constantinople for coffee as for wine at Paris,\" and relates\r\nthat it is as common for beggars to ask for money to buy coffee, as it\r\nis in Europe to ask for money to buy wine or beer.\r\n\r\nAt this time to refuse or to neglect to give coffee to their wives was a\r\nlegitimate cause for divorce among the Turks. The men made promise when\r\nmarrying never to let their wives be without coffee. \"That,\" says\r\nFulbert de Monteith, \"is perhaps more prudent than to swear fidelity.\"\r\n\r\nAnother Arabic manuscript by Bichivili in the Bibliothéque Nationale at\r\nParis furnishes us with this pen picture of the coffee ceremony as\r\npractised in Constantinople in the sixteenth century:\r\n\r\n     In all the great men's houses, there are servants whose business it\r\n     is only to take care of the coffee; and the head officer among\r\n     them, or he who has the inspection over all the rest, has an\r\n     apartment allowed him near the hall which is destined for the\r\n     reception of visitors. The Turks call this officer _Kavveghi_, that\r\n     is, Overseer or Steward of the Coffee. In the harem or ladies'\r\n     apartment in the seraglio, there are a great many such officers,\r\n     each having forty or fifty _Baltagis_ under them, who, after they\r\n     have served a certain time in these coffee-houses, are sure to be\r\n     well provided for, either by an advantageous post, or a sufficient\r\n     quantity of land. In the houses of persons of quality likewise,\r\n     there are pages, called _Itchoglans_, who receive the coffee from\r\n     the stewards, and present it to the company with surprising\r\n     dexterity and address, as soon as the master of the family makes a\r\n     sign for that purpose, which is all the language they ever speak to\r\n     them.... The coffee is served on salvers without feet, made\r\n     commonly of painted or varnished wood, and sometimes of silver.\r\n     They hold from 15 to 20 china dishes each; and such as can afford\r\n     it have these dishes half set in silver ... the dish may be easily\r\n     held with the thumb below and two fingers on the upper edge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SERVING COFFEE TO A GUEST.--AFTER A DRAWING IN AN EARLY\r\nEDITION OF \"ARABIAN NIGHTS\"]\r\n\r\nIn his _Relation of a Journey to Constantinople in 1657_, Nicholas\r\nRolamb, the Swedish traveler and envoy to the Ottoman Porte, gives us\r\nthis early glimpse of coffee in the home life of the Turks:[40]\r\n\r\n     This [coffee] is a kind of pea that grows in _Egypt_, which the\r\n     _Turks_ pound and boil in water, and take it for pleasure instead\r\n     of brandy, sipping it through the lips boiling hot, persuading\r\n     themselves that it consumes catarrhs, and prevents the rising of\r\n     vapours out of the stomach into the head. The drinking of this\r\n     coffee and smoking tobacco (for tho' the use of tobacco is\r\n     forbidden on pain of death, yet it is used in _Constantinople_ more\r\n     than any where by men as well as women, tho' secretly) makes up all\r\n     the pastime among the _Turks_, and is the only thing they treat one\r\n     another with; for which reason all people of distinction have a\r\n     particular room next their own, built on purpose for it, where\r\n     there stands a jar of coffee continually boiling.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note that among several misconceptions that were held\r\nby some of the peoples of the Levant was one that coffee was a promoter\r\nof impotence, although a Persian version of the Angel Gabriel legend\r\nsays that Gabriel invented it to restore the Prophet's failing\r\nmetabolism. Often in Turkish and Arabian literature, however, we meet\r\nwith the suggestion that coffee drinking makes for sterility and\r\nbarrenness, a notion that modern medicine has exploded; for now we know\r\nthat coffee stimulates the racial instinct, for which tobacco is a\r\nsedative.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST PRINTED REFERENCE TO COFFEE, AS IT APPEARS IN\r\nRAUWOLF'S WORK, 1582]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION OF COFFEE INTO WESTERN EUROPE\r\n\r\n     _When the three great temperance beverages, cocoa, tea, and coffee,\r\n     came to Europe--Coffee first mentioned by Rauwolf in 1582--Early\r\n     days of coffee in Italy--How Pope Clement VIII baptized it and made\r\n     it a truly Christian beverage--The first European coffee house, in\r\n     Venice, 1645--The famous Caffè Florian--Other celebrated Venetian\r\n     coffee houses of the eighteenth century--The romantic story of\r\n     Pedrocchi, the poor lemonade-vender, who built the most beautiful\r\n     coffee house in the world_\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the world's three great temperance beverages, cocoa, tea, and coffee,\r\ncocoa was the first to be introduced into Europe, in 1528, by the\r\nSpanish. It was nearly a century later, in 1610, that the Dutch brought\r\ntea to Europe. Venetian traders introduced coffee into Europe in 1615.\r\n\r\nEurope's first knowledge of coffee was brought by travelers returning\r\nfrom the Far East and the Levant. Leonhard Rauwolf started on his famous\r\njourney into the Eastern countries from Marseilles in September, 1573,\r\nhaving left his home in Augsburg, the 18th of the preceding May. He\r\nreached Aleppo in November, 1573; and returned to Augsburg, February 12,\r\n1576. He was the first European to mention coffee; and to him also\r\nbelongs the honor of being the first to refer to the beverage in print.\r\n\r\nRauwolf was not only a doctor of medicine and a botanist of great\r\nrenown, but also official physician to the town of Augsburg. When he\r\nspoke, it was as one having authority. The first printed reference to\r\ncoffee appears as _chaube_ in chapter viii of _Rauwolf's Travels_, which\r\ndeals with the manners and customs of the city of Aleppo. The exact\r\npassage is reproduced herewith as it appears in the original German\r\nedition of Rauwolf published at Frankfort and Lauingen in 1582-83. The\r\ntranslation is as follows:\r\n\r\n     If you have a mind to eat something or to drink other liquors,\r\n     there is commonly an open shop near it, where you sit down upon the\r\n     ground or carpets and drink together. Among the rest they have a\r\n     very good drink, by them called _Chaube_ [coffee] that is almost as\r\n     black as ink, and very good in illness, chiefly that of the\r\n     stomach; of this they drink in the morning early in open places\r\n     before everybody, without any fear or regard, out of _China_ cups,\r\n     as hot as they can; they put it often to their lips but drink but\r\n     little at a time, and let it go round as they sit.\r\n\r\n     In this same water they take a fruit called _Bunnu_ which in its\r\n     bigness, shape and color is almost like unto a bayberry, with two\r\n     thin shells surrounded, which, as they informed me, are brought\r\n     from the _Indies_; but as these in themselves are, and have within\r\n     them, two yellowish grains in two distinct cells, and besides,\r\n     being they agree in their virtue, figure, looks, and name with the\r\n     _Bunchum_ of _Avicenna_, and _Bunca_, of _Rasis ad Almans_ exactly;\r\n     therefore I take them to be the same, until I am better informed by\r\n     the learned. This liquor is very common among them, wherefore there\r\n     are a great many of them that sell it, and others that sell the\r\n     berries, everywhere in their _Batzars_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Early Days of Coffee in Italy_\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to determine just when the use of coffee spread from\r\nConstantinople to the western parts of Europe; but it is more than\r\nlikely that the Venetians, because of their close proximity to, and\r\ntheir great trade with, the Levant, were the first acquainted with it.\r\n\r\nProspero Alpini (Alpinus; 1553-1617), a learned physician and botanist\r\nof Padua, journeyed to Egypt in 1580, and brought back news of coffee.\r\nHe was the first to print a description of the coffee plant and drink in\r\nhis treatise _The Plants of Egypt_, written in Latin, and published in\r\nVenice, 1592. He says:\r\n\r\n     I have seen this tree at Cairo, it being the same tree that\r\n     produces the fruit, so common in Egypt, to which they give the name\r\n     _bon_ or _ban_. The Arabians and the Egyptians make a sort of\r\n     decoction of it, which they drink instead of wine; and it is sold\r\n     in all their public houses, as wine is with us. They call this\r\n     drink _caova_. The fruit of which they make it comes from \"Arabia\r\n     the Happy,\" and the tree that I saw looks like a spindle tree, but\r\n     the leaves are thicker, tougher, and greener. The tree is never\r\n     without leaves.\r\n\r\nAlpini makes note of the medicinal qualities attributed to the drink by\r\ndwellers in the Orient, and many of these were soon incorporated into\r\nEurope's materia medica.\r\n\r\nJohann Vesling (Veslingius; 1598-1649), a German botanist and traveler,\r\nsettled in Venice, where he became known as a learned Italian physician.\r\nHe edited (1640) a new edition of Alpini's work; but earlier (1638)\r\npublished some comments on Alpini's findings, in the course of which he\r\ndistinguished certain qualities found in a drink made from the husks\r\n(skins) of the coffee berries from those found in the liquor made from\r\nthe beans themselves, which he calls the stones of the coffee fruit. He\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     Not only in Egypt is coffee in much request, but in almost all the\r\n     other provinces of the Turkish Empire. Whence it comes to pass that\r\n     it is dear even in the Levant and scarce among the Europeans, who\r\n     by that means are deprived of a very wholesome liquor.\r\n\r\nFrom this we may conclude that coffee was not wholly unknown in Europe\r\nat that time. Vesling adds that when he visited Cairo, he found there\r\ntwo or three thousand coffee houses, and that \"some did begin to put\r\nsugar in their coffee to correct the bitterness of it, and others made\r\nsugar-plums of the berries.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Baptized by the Pope_\r\n\r\nShortly after coffee reached Rome, according to a much quoted legend, it\r\nwas again threatened with religious fanaticism, which almost caused its\r\nexcommunication from Christendom. It is related that certain priests\r\nappealed to Pope Clement VIII (1535-1605) to have its use forbidden\r\namong Christians, denouncing it as an invention of Satan. They claimed\r\nthat the Evil One, having forbidden his followers, the infidel Moslems,\r\nthe use of wine--no doubt because it was sanctified by Christ and used\r\nin the Holy Communion--had given them as a substitute this hellish black\r\nbrew of his which they called coffee. For Christians to drink it was to\r\nrisk falling into a trap set by Satan for their souls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ITALIAN COFFEE HOUSE\r\n\r\nAfter Goldoni, by Zatta]\r\n\r\nIt is further related that the pope, made curious, desired to inspect\r\nthis Devil's drink, and had some brought to him. The aroma of it was so\r\npleasant and inviting that the pope was tempted to try a cupful. After\r\ndrinking it, he exclaimed, \"Why, this Satan's drink is so delicious that\r\nit would be a pity to let the infidels have exclusive use of it. We\r\nshall fool Satan by baptizing it, and making it a truly Christian\r\nbeverage.\"\r\n\r\nThus, whatever harmfulness its opponents try to attribute to coffee, the\r\nfact remains (if we are to credit the story) that it has been baptized\r\nand proclaimed unharmful, and a \"truly Christian beverage,\" by his\r\nholiness the pope.\r\n\r\nThe Venetians had further knowledge of coffee in 1585, when\r\nGianfrancesco Morosini, city magistrate at Constantinople, reported to\r\nthe Senate that the Turks \"drink a black water as hot as they can suffer\r\nit, which is the infusion of a bean called _cavee_, which is said to\r\npossess the virtue of stimulating mankind.\"\r\n\r\nDr. A. Couguet, in an Italian review, asserts that Europe's first cup of\r\ncoffee was sipped in Venice, toward the close of the sixteenth century.\r\nHe is of the opinion that the first berries were imported by Mocengio,\r\nwho was called the _pevere_, because he made a huge fortune trading in\r\nspices and other specialties of the Orient.\r\n\r\nIn 1615 Pierre (Pietro) Delia Valle (1586-1652), the well known Italian\r\ntraveler and author of _Travels in India and Persia_, wrote a letter\r\nfrom Constantinople to his friend Mario Schipano at Venice:\r\n\r\n     The Turks have a drink of black color, which during the summer is\r\n     very cooling, whereas in the winter it heats and warms the body,\r\n     remaining always the same beverage and not changing its substance.\r\n     They swallow it hot as it comes from the fire and they drink it in\r\n     long draughts, not at dinner time, but as a kind of dainty and\r\n     sipped slowly while talking with one's friends. One cannot find any\r\n     meetings among them where they drink it not.... With this drink,\r\n     which they call _cahue_, they divert themselves in their\r\n     conversations.... It is made with the grain or fruit of a certain\r\n     tree called _cahue_.... When I return I will bring some with me and\r\n     I will impart the knowledge to the Italians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOBILITY IN AN EARLY VENETIAN CAFFÈ\r\n\r\nFrom the Grevembroch collection in the Museo Civico]\r\n\r\nDella Valle's countrymen, however, were in a fair way to become well\r\nacquainted with the beverage, for already (1615) it had been introduced\r\ninto Venice. At first it was used largely for medicinal purposes; and\r\nhigh prices were charged for it. Vesling says of its use in Europe as a\r\nmedicine, \"the first step it made from the cabinets of the curious, as\r\nan exotic seed, being into the apothecaries' shops as a drug.\"\r\n\r\nThe first coffee house in Italy is said to have been opened in 1645, but\r\nconvincing confirmation is lacking. In the beginning, the beverage was\r\nsold with other drinks by lemonade-venders. The Italian word\r\n_aquacedratajo_ means one who sells lemonade and similar refreshments;\r\nalso one who sells coffee, chocolate, liquor, etc. Jardin says the\r\nbeverage was in general use throughout Italy in 1645. It is certain,\r\nhowever, that a coffee shop was opened in Venice in 1683 under the\r\n_Procuratie Nuove_. The famous Caffè Florian was opened in Venice by\r\nFloriono Francesconi in 1720.\r\n\r\nThe first authoritative treatise devoted to coffee only appeared in\r\n1671. It was written in Latin by Antoine Faustus Nairon (1635-1707),\r\nMaronite professor of the Chaldean and Syrian languages in the College\r\nof Rome.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the seventeenth century and the first half of\r\nthe eighteenth, the coffee house made great progress in Italy. It is\r\ninteresting to note that this first European adaptation of the Oriental\r\ncoffee house was known as a _caffè_. The double _f_ is retained by the\r\nItalians to this day, and by some writers is thought to have been taken\r\nfrom _coffea_, without the double _f_ being lost, as in the case of the\r\nFrench and some other Continental forms.\r\n\r\nTo Italy, then, belongs the honor of having given to the Western world\r\nthe real coffee house, although the French and Austrians greatly\r\nimproved upon it. It was not long after its beginning that nearly every\r\nshop on the Piazza di San Marco in Venice was a _caffè_[41]. Near the\r\nPiazza was the Caffè della Ponte dell' Angelo, where in 1792 died the\r\ndog Tabacchio, celebrated by Vincenzo Formaleoni in a satirical eulogy\r\nthat is a parody of the oration of Ubaldo Bregolini upon the death of\r\nAngelo Emo.\r\n\r\nIn the Caffè della Spaderia, kept by Marco Ancilloto, some radicals\r\nproposed to open a reading-room to encourage the spread of liberal\r\nideas. The inquisitors sent a foot-soldier to notify the proprietor that\r\nhe should inform the first person entering the room that he was to\r\npresent himself before their tribunal. The idea was thereupon abandoned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLDONI IN A VENETIAN CAFFÈ\r\n\r\nFrom a painting by P. Longhi]\r\n\r\nAmong other celebrated coffee houses was the one called Menegazzo, from\r\nthe name of the rotund proprietor, Menico. This place was much\r\nfrequented by men of letters; and heated discussions were common there\r\nbetween Angelo Maria Barbaro, Lorenzo da Ponte, and others of their\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe coffee house gradually became the common resort of all classes. In\r\nthe mornings came the merchants, lawyers, physicians, brokers, workers,\r\nand wandering venders; in the afternoons, and until the late hours of\r\nthe nights, the leisure classes, including the ladies.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, the rooms of the first Italian _caffè_ were low,\r\nsimple, unadorned, without windows, and only poorly illuminated by\r\ntremulous and uncertain lights. Within them, however, joyous throngs\r\npassed to and fro, clad in varicolored garments, men and women chatting\r\nin groups here and there, and always above the buzz there were to be\r\nheard such choice bits of scandal as made worthwhile a visit to the\r\ncoffee house. Smaller rooms were devoted to gaming.\r\n\r\nIn the \"little square\" described by Goldoni[42] in his comedy _The\r\nCoffee House_, where the combined barber-shop and gambling house was\r\nlocated, Don Marzio, that marvelous type of slanderous old romancer, is\r\nshown as one typical of the period, for Goldoni was a satirist. The\r\nother characters of the play were also drawn from the types then to be\r\nseen every day in the coffee houses on the Piazza.\r\n\r\nIn the square of St. Mark's, in the eighteenth century, under the\r\n_Procuratie Vecchie_, were the _caffè_ Re di Francia, Abbondanza, Pitt,\r\nl'eroe, Regina d'Ungheria, Orfeo, Redentore, Coraggio-Speranza, Arco\r\nCeleste, and Quadri. The last-named was opened in 1775 by Giorgio Quadri\r\nof Corfu, who served genuine Turkish coffee for the first time in\r\nVenice.\r\n\r\nUnder the _Procuratie Nuove_ were to be found the _caffè_ Angelo\r\nCustode, Duca di Toscana, Buon genio-Doge, Imperatore Imperatrice della\r\nRussia, Tamerlano, Fontane di Diana, Dame Venete, Aurora Piante d'oro,\r\nArabo-Piastrelle, Pace, Venezia trionfante, and Florian.\r\n\r\nProbably no coffee house in Europe has acquired so world-wide a\r\ncelebrity as that kept by Florian, the friend of Canova the sculptor,\r\nand the trusted agent and acquaintance of hundreds of persons in and out\r\nof the city, who found him a mine of social information and a convenient\r\ncity directory. Persons leaving Venice left their cards and itineraries\r\nwith him; and new-comers inquired at Florian's for tidings of those whom\r\nthey wished to see. \"He long concentrated in himself a knowledge more\r\nvaried and multifarious than that possessed by any individual before or\r\nsince,\" says Hazlitt[43], who has given us this delightful pen picture\r\nof _caffè_ life in Venice in the eighteenth century:\r\n\r\n     Venetian coffee was said to surpass all others, and the article\r\n     placed before his visitors by Florian was the best in Venice. Of\r\n     some of the establishments as they then existed, Molmenti has\r\n     supplied us with illustrations, in one of which Goldoni the\r\n     dramatist is represented as a visitor, and a female mendicant is\r\n     soliciting alms.\r\n\r\n     So cordial was the esteem of the great sculptor Canova for him,\r\n     that when Florian was overtaken by gout, he made a model of his\r\n     leg, that the poor fellow might be spared the anguish of fitting\r\n     himself with boots. The friendship had begun when Canova was\r\n     entering on his career, and he never forgot the substantial\r\n     services which had been rendered to him in the hour of need.\r\n\r\n     In later days, the Caffè Florian was under the superintendence of a\r\n     female chef, and the waitresses used, in the case of certain\r\n     visitors, to fasten a flower in the button-hole, perhaps allusively\r\n     to the name. In the Piazza itself girls would do the same thing. A\r\n     good deal of hospitality is, and has ever been, dispensed at Venice\r\n     in the cafés and restaurants, which do service for the domestic\r\n     hearth.\r\n\r\n     There were many other establishments devoted, more especially in\r\n     the latest period of Venetian independence, to the requirements of\r\n     those who desired such resorts for purposes of conversation and\r\n     gossip. These houses were frequented by various classes of\r\n     patrons--the patrician, the politician, the soldier, the artist,\r\n     the old and the young--all had their special haunts where the\r\n     company and the tariff were in accordance with the guests. The\r\n     upper circles of male society--all above the actually\r\n     poor--gravitated hither to a man.\r\n\r\n     For the Venetian of all ranks the coffee house was almost the last\r\n     place visited on departure from the city, and the first visited on\r\n     his return. His domicile was the residence of his wife and the\r\n     repository of his possessions; but only on exceptional occasions\r\n     was it the scene of domestic hospitality, and rare were the\r\n     instances when the husband and wife might be seen abroad together,\r\n     and when the former would invite the lady to enter a café or a\r\n     confectioner's shop to partake of an ice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLORIAN'S FAMOUS CAFFÈ IN THE PIAZZA DI SAN MARCO,\r\nVENICE, NINETEENTH CENTURY]\r\n\r\nThe Caffè Florian has undergone many changes, but it still survives as\r\none of the favorite _caffè_ in the Piazza San Marco.\r\n\r\nBy 1775 coffee-house history had begun to repeat itself in Venice.\r\nCharges of immorality, vice, and corruption, were preferred against the\r\n_caffè_; and the Council of Ten in 1775, and again in 1776, directed the\r\nInquisitors of State to eradicate these \"social cankers.\" However, they\r\nsurvived all attempts of the reformers to suppress them.\r\n\r\nThe Caffè Pedrocchi in Padua was another of the early Italian coffee\r\nhouses that became famous. Antonio Pedrocchi (1776-1852) was a\r\nlemonade-vender who, in the hope of attracting the gay youth, the\r\nstudents of his time, bought an old house with the idea of converting\r\nthe ground floor into a series of attractive rooms. He put all his ready\r\nmoney and all he could borrow into the venture, only to find there were\r\nno cellars, indispensable for making ices and beverages on the premises,\r\nand that the walls and floors were so old that they crumbled when\r\nrepairs were started.\r\n\r\nHe was in despair; but, nothing daunted, he decided to have a cellar\r\ndug. What was his surprise to find the house was built over the vault\r\nof an old church, and that the vault contained considerable treasure.\r\nThe lucky proprietor found himself free to continue his trade of\r\nlemonade-vender and coffee-seller, or to live a life of ease. Being a\r\nwise man, he adhered to his original plan; and soon his luxurious rooms\r\nbecame the favorite rendezvous for the smart set of his day. In this\r\nperiod lemonade and coffee frequently went together. The Caffè Pedrocchi\r\nis considered one of the finest pieces of architecture erected in Italy\r\nin the nineteenth century. It was begun in 1816, opened in 1831, and\r\ncompleted in 1842.\r\n\r\nCoffee houses were early established in other Italian cities,\r\nparticularly in Rome, Florence, and Genoa.\r\n\r\nIn 1764, _Il Caffè_, a purely philosophical and literary periodical,\r\nmade its appearance in Milan, being founded by Count Pietro Verri\r\n(1728-97). Its chief editor was Cesare Beccaria. Its object was to\r\ncounteract the influence and superficiality of the Arcadians. It\r\nacquired its title from the fact that Count Verri and his friends were\r\nwont to meet at a coffee house in Milan kept by a Greek named Demetrio.\r\nIt lived only two years.\r\n\r\nOther periodicals of the same name appeared at later periods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNINGS OF COFFEE IN FRANCE\r\n\r\n     _What French travelers did for coffee--The introduction of coffee\r\n     by P. de la Roque into Marseilles in 1644--The first commercial\r\n     importation of coffee from Egypt--The first French coffee\r\n     house--Failure of the attempt by physicians of Marseilles to\r\n     discredit coffee--Soliman Aga introduces coffee into\r\n     Paris--Cabarets à caffè--Celebrated works on coffee by French\r\n     writers_\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to three great French travelers for much valuable\r\nknowledge about coffee; and these gallant gentlemen first fired the\r\nimagination of the French people in regard to the beverage that was\r\ndestined to play so important a part in the French revolution. They are\r\nTavernier (1605-89), Thévenot (1633-67), and Bernier (1625-88).\r\n\r\nThen there is Jean La Roque (1661-1745), who made a famous \"Voyage to\r\nArabia the Happy\" (_Voyage de l'Arabie Heureuse_) in 1708-13 and to\r\nwhose father, P. de la Roque, is due the honor of having brought the\r\nfirst coffee into France in 1644. Also, there is Antoine Galland\r\n(1646-1715), the French Orientalist, first translator of the _Arabian\r\nNights_ and antiquary to the king, who, in 1699, published an analysis\r\nand translation from the Arabic of the Abd-al-Kâdir manuscript (1587),\r\ngiving the first authentic account of the origin of coffee.\r\n\r\nProbably the earliest reference to coffee in France is to be found in\r\nthe simple statement that Onorio Belli (Bellus), the Italian botanist\r\nand author, in 1596 sent to Charles de l'Écluse (1526-1609), a French\r\nphysician, botanist and traveler, \"seeds used by the Egyptians to make a\r\nliquid they call _cave_.[44]\"\r\n\r\nP. de la Roque accompanied M. de la Haye, the French ambassador, to\r\nConstantinople; and afterward traveled into the Levant. Upon his return\r\nto Marseilles in 1644, he brought with him not only some coffee, but\r\n\"all the little implements used about it in Turkey, which were then\r\nlooked upon as great curiosities in France.\" There were included in the\r\ncoffee service some findjans, or china dishes, and small pieces of\r\nmuslin embroidered with gold, silver, and silk, which the Turks used as\r\nnapkins.\r\n\r\nJean La Roque gives credit to Jean de Thévenot for introducing coffee\r\nprivately into Paris in 1657, and for teaching the French how to use\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\nDe Thévenot writes in this entertaining fashion concerning the use of\r\nthe drink in Turkey in the middle of the seventeenth century:\r\n\r\n     They have another drink in ordinary use. They call it _cahve_ and\r\n     take it all hours of the day. This drink is made from a berry\r\n     roasted in a pan or other utensil over the fire. They pound it into\r\n     a very fine powder.\r\n\r\n     When they wish to drink it, they take a boiler made expressly for\r\n     the purpose, which they call an _ibrik_; and having filled it with\r\n     water, they let it boil. When it boils, they add to about three\r\n     cups of water a heaping spoonful of the powder; and when it boils,\r\n     they remove it quickly from the fire, or sometimes they stir it,\r\n     otherwise it would boil over, as it rises very quickly. When it has\r\n     boiled up thus ten or twelve times, they pour it into porcelain\r\n     cups, which they place upon a platter of painted wood and bring it\r\n     to you thus boiling.\r\n\r\n     One must drink it hot, but in several instalments, otherwise it is\r\n     not good. One takes it in little swallows[45] for fear of burning\r\n     one's self--in such fashion that in a _cavekane_ (so they call the\r\n     places where it is sold ready prepared), one hears a pleasant\r\n     little musical sucking sound.... There are some who mix with it a\r\n     small quantity of cloves and cardamom seeds; others add sugar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TITLE PAGE OF LA ROQUE'S WORK, 1716]\r\n\r\nIt was really out of curiosity that the people of France took to coffee,\r\nsays Jardin; \"they wanted to know this Oriental beverage, so much\r\nvaunted, although its blackness at first sight was far from attractive.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1660 several merchants of Marseilles, who had lived for a\r\ntime in the Levant and felt they were not able to do without coffee,\r\nbrought some coffee beans home with them; and later, a group of\r\napothecaries and other merchants brought in the first commercial\r\nimportation of coffee in bales from Egypt. The Lyons merchants soon\r\nfollowed suit, and the use of coffee became general in those parts. In\r\n1671 certain private persons opened a coffee house in Marseilles, near\r\nthe Exchange, which at once became popular with merchants and travelers.\r\nOthers started up, and all were crowded. The people did not, however,\r\ndrink any the less at home. \"In fine,\" says La Roque, \"the use of the\r\nbeverage increased so amazingly that, as was inevitable, the physicians\r\nbecame alarmed, thinking it would not agree with the inhabitants of a\r\ncountry hot and extremely dry.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COFFEE TREE AS PICTURED BY LA ROQUE IN HIS \"VOYAGE DE\r\nL'ARABIE HEUREUSE\"]\r\n\r\nThe age-old controversy was on. Some sided with the physicians, others\r\nopposed them, as at Mecca, Cairo, and Constantinople; only here the\r\nargument turned mainly on the medicinal question, the Church this time\r\nhaving no part in the dispute. \"The lovers of coffee used the physicians\r\nvery ill when they met together, and the physicians on their side\r\nthreatened the coffee drinkers with all sorts of diseases.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CLOSE-UP OF RIPE COFFEE BERRIES]\r\n\r\nMatters came to a head in 1679, when an ingenious attempt by the\r\nphysicians of Marseilles to discredit coffee took the form of having a\r\nyoung student, about to be admitted to the College of Physicians,\r\ndispute before the magistrate in the town hall, a question proposed by\r\ntwo physicians of the Faculty of Aix, as to whether coffee was or was\r\nnot prejudicial to the inhabitants of Marseilles.\r\n\r\nThe thesis recited that coffee had won the approval of all nations, had\r\nalmost wholly put down the use of wine, although it was not to be\r\ncompared even with the lees of that excellent beverage; that it was a\r\nvile and worthless foreign novelty; that its claim to be a remedy\r\nagainst distempers was ridiculous, because it was not a bean but the\r\nfruit of a tree discovered by goats and camels; that it was hot and not\r\ncold, as alleged; that it burned up the blood, and so induced palsies,\r\nimpotence, and leanness; \"from all of which we must necessarily conclude\r\nthat coffee is hurtful to the greater part of the inhabitants of\r\nMarseilles.\"\r\n\r\nThus did the good doctors of the Faculty of Aix set forth their\r\nprejudices, and this was their final decision upon coffee. Many thought\r\nthey overreached themselves in their misguided zeal. They were handled\r\nsomewhat roughly in the disputation, which disclosed many false\r\nreasonings, to say nothing of blunders as to matters of fact. The world\r\nhad already advanced too far to have another decision against coffee\r\ncount for much, and this latest effort to stop its onward march was of\r\neven less force than the diatribes of the Mohammedan priests. The coffee\r\nhouses continued to be as much frequented as before, and the people\r\ndrank no less coffee in their homes. Indeed, the indictment proved a\r\nboomerang, for consumption received such an impetus that the merchants\r\nof Lyons and Marseilles, for the first time in history, began to import\r\ngreen coffee from the Levant by the ship-load in order to meet the\r\nincreased demand.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in 1669, Soliman Aga, the Turkish ambassador from Mohammed IV\r\nto the court of Louis XIV, had arrived in Paris. He brought with him a\r\nconsiderable quantity of coffee, and introduced the coffee drink, made\r\nin Turkish style, to the French capital.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A COFFEE BRANCH WITH FLOWERS AND FRUIT AS ILLUSTRATED IN\r\nLA ROQUE'S \"VOYAGE DE L'ARABIE HEUREUSE\"]\r\n\r\nThe ambassador remained in Paris only from July, 1669, to May, 1670, but\r\nlong enough firmly to establish the custom he had introduced. Two years\r\nlater, Pascal, an Armenian, opened his coffee-drinking booth at the fair\r\nof St.-Germain, and this event marked the beginning of the Parisian\r\ncoffee houses. The story is told in detail in chapter XI.\r\n\r\nThe custom of drinking coffee having become general in the capital, as\r\nwell as in Marseilles and Lyons, the example was followed in all the\r\nprovinces. Every city soon had its coffee houses, and the beverage was\r\nlargely consumed in private homes. La Roque writes: \"None, from the\r\nmeanest citizen to the persons of the highest quality, failed to use it\r\nevery morning or at least soon after dinner, it being the custom\r\nlikewise to offer it in all visits.\"\r\n\r\n\"The persons of highest quality\" encouraged the fashion of having\r\n_cabaréts à caffé_; and soon it was said that there could be seen in\r\nFrance all that the East could furnish of magnificence in coffee houses,\r\n\"the china jars and other Indian furniture being richer and more\r\nvaluable than the gold and silver with which they were lavishly\r\nadorned.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1671 there appeared in Lyons a book entitled _The Most Excellent\r\nVirtues of the Mulberry, Called Coffee_, showing the need for an\r\nauthoritative work on the subject--a need that was ably filled that same\r\nyear and in Lyons by the publication of Philippe Sylvestre Dufour's\r\nadmirable treatise, _Concerning the Use of Coffee, Tea, and Chocolate_.\r\nAgain at Lyons, Dufour published (1684) his more complete work on _The\r\nManner of Making Coffee, Tea, and Chocolate_. This was followed (1715)\r\nby the publication in Paris of Jean La Roque's _Voyage de l'Arabie\r\nHeureuse_, containing the story of the author's journey to the court of\r\nthe king of Yemen in 1711, a description of the coffee tree and its\r\nfruit, and a critical and historical treatise on its first use and\r\nintroduction to France.\r\n\r\nLa Roque's description of his visit to the king's gardens is interesting\r\nbecause it shows the Arabs still held to the belief that coffee grew\r\nonly in Arabia. Here it is:\r\n\r\n     There was nothing remarkable in the King's Gardens, except the\r\n     great pains taken to furnish it with all the kinds of trees that\r\n     are common in the country; amongst which there were the coffee\r\n     trees, the finest that could be had. When the deputies represented\r\n     to the King how much that was contrary to the custom of the Princes\r\n     of Europe (who endeavor to stock their gardens chiefly with the\r\n     rarest and most uncommon plants that can be found) the King\r\n     returned them this answer: That he valued himself as much upon his\r\n     good taste and generosity as any Prince in Europe; the coffee tree,\r\n     he told them, was indeed common in his country, but it was not the\r\n     less dear to him upon that account; the perpetual verdure of it\r\n     pleased him extremely; and also the thoughts of its producing a\r\n     fruit which was nowhere else to be met with; and when he made a\r\n     present of that that came from his own Gardens, it was a great\r\n     satisfaction to him to be able to say that he had planted the trees\r\n     that produced it with his own hands.\r\n\r\nThe first merchant licensed to sell coffee in France was one Damame\r\nFrançois, a bourgeois of Paris, who secured the privilege through an\r\nedict of 1692. He was given the sole right for ten years to sell coffees\r\nand teas in all the provinces and towns of the kingdom, and in all\r\nterritories under the sovereignty of the king, and received also\r\nauthority to maintain a warehouse.\r\n\r\nTo Santo Domingo (1738) and other French colonies the café was soon\r\ntransported from the homeland, and thrived under special license from\r\nthe king.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 there appeared in France a leaflet-periodical, entitled _The\r\nCafé, Literary, Artistic, and Commercial_. Ch. Woinez, the editor, said\r\nin announcing it: \"The Salon stood for privilege, the Café stands for\r\nequality.\" Its publication was of short duration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE INTRODUCTION OF COFFEE INTO ENGLAND\r\n\r\n     _The first printed reference to coffee in English--Early mention of\r\n     coffee by noted English travelers and writers--The Lacedæmonian\r\n     \"black broth\" controversy--How Conopios introduced coffee drinking\r\n     at Oxford--The first English coffee house in Oxford--Two English\r\n     botanists on coffee_\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish travelers and writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\r\nwere quite as enterprising as their Continental contemporaries in\r\ntelling about the coffee bean and the coffee drink. The first printed\r\nreference to coffee in English, however, appears as _chaoua_ in a note\r\nby a Dutchman, Paludanus, in _Linschoten's Travels_, the title of an\r\nEnglish translation from the Latin of a work first published in Holland\r\nin 1595 or 1596, the English edition appearing in London in 1598. A\r\nreproduction made from a photograph of the original work, with the\r\nquaint black-letter German text and the Paludanus notation in roman, is\r\nshown herewith.\r\n\r\nHans Hugo (or John Huygen) Van Linschooten (1563-1611) was one of the\r\nmost intrepid of Dutch travelers. In his description of Japanese manners\r\nand customs we find one of the earliest tea references. He says:\r\n\r\n     Their manner of eating and drinking is: everie man hath a table\r\n     alone, without table-clothes or napkins, and eateth with two pieces\r\n     of wood like the men of Chino: they drinke wine of Rice, wherewith\r\n     they drink themselves drunke, and after their meat they use a\r\n     certain drinke, which is a pot with hote water, which they drinke\r\n     as hote as ever they may indure, whether it be Winter or Summer.\r\n\r\nJust here Bernard Ten Broeke Paludanus (1550-1633), Dutch savant and\r\nauthor, professor of philosophy at the University of Leyden, himself a\r\ntraveler over the four quarters of the globe, inserts his note\r\ncontaining the coffee reference. He says:\r\n\r\n     The Turks holde almost the same manner of drinking of their\r\n     _Chaona_[46], which they make of certaine fruit, which is like unto\r\n     the Bakelaer[47], and by the Egyptians called _Bon_ or _Ban_[48]:\r\n     they take of this fruite one pound and a half, and roast them a\r\n     little in the fire and then sieth them in twenty pounds of water,\r\n     till the half be consumed away: this drinke they take every morning\r\n     fasting in their chambers, out of an earthen pot, being verie hote,\r\n     as we doe here drinke _aquacomposita_[49] in the morning: and they\r\n     say that it strengtheneth and maketh them warme, breaketh wind, and\r\n     openeth any stopping.\r\n\r\nVan Linschooten then completes his tea reference by saying:\r\n\r\n     The manner of dressing their meat is altogether contrarie unto\r\n     other nations: the aforesaid warme water is made with the powder of\r\n     a certaine hearbe called _Chaa_, which is much esteemed, and is\r\n     well accounted among them.\r\n\r\nThe _chaa_ is, of course, tea, dialect _t'eh_.\r\n\r\nIn 1599, \"Sir\" Antony (or Anthony) Sherley (1565-1630), a picturesque\r\ngentleman-adventurer, the first Englishman to mention coffee drinking in\r\nthe Orient, sailed from Venice on a kind of self-appointed, informal\r\nPersian mission, to invite the shah to ally himself with the Christian\r\nprinces against the Turks, and incidentally, to promote English trade\r\ninterests in the East. The English government knew nothing of the\r\narrangement, disavowed him, and forbade his return to England. However,\r\nthe expedition got to Persia; and the account of the voyage thither was\r\nwritten by William Parry, one of the Sherley party, and was published in\r\nLondon in 1601. It is interesting because it contains the first printed\r\nreference to coffee in English employing the more modern form of the\r\nword. The original reference was photographed for this work in the Worth\r\nLibrary of the British Museum, and is reproduced herewith on page 39.\r\n\r\nThe passage is part of an account of the manners and customs of the\r\nTurks (who, Parry says, are \"damned infidells\") in Aleppo. It reads:\r\n\r\n     They sit at their meat (which is served to them upon the ground) as\r\n     Tailers sit upon their stalls, crosse-legd; for the most part,\r\n     passing the day in banqueting and carowsing, untill they surfet,\r\n     drinking a certaine liquor, which they do call _Coffe_, which is\r\n     made of seede much like mustard seede, which will soone intoxicate\r\n     the braine like our Metheglin.[50]\r\n\r\nAnother early English reference to coffee, wherein the word is spelled\r\n\"coffa\", is in Captain John Smith's book of _Travels and Adventure_,\r\npublished in 1603. He says of the Turks: \"Their best drink is _coffa_ of\r\na graine they call _coava_.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the same Captain John Smith who in 1607 became the founder of\r\nthe Colony of Virginia and brought with him to America probably the\r\nearliest knowledge of the beverage given to the new Western world.\r\n\r\nSamuel Purchas (1527-1626), an early English collector of travels, in\r\n_Purchas His Pilgrimes_, under the head of \"Observations of William\r\nFinch, merchant, at Socotra\" (Sokotra--an island in the Indian Ocean) in\r\n1607, says of the Arab inhabitants:\r\n\r\n     Their best entertainment is a china dish of _Coho_, a blacke\r\n     bitterish drinke, made of a berry like a bayberry, brought from\r\n     Mecca, supped off hot, good for the head and stomache.[51]\r\n\r\nStill other early and favorite English references to coffee are those to\r\nbe found in the _Travels_ of William Biddulph. This work was published\r\nin 1609. It is entitled _The Travels of Certayne Englishmen in Africa,\r\nAsia, etc.... Begunne in 1600 and by some of them finished--this yeere\r\n1608_. These references are also reproduced herewith from the\r\nblack-letter originals in the British Museum (see page 40).\r\n\r\nBiddulph's description of the drink, and of the coffee-house customs of\r\nthe Turks, was the first detailed account to be written by an\r\nEnglishman. It also appears in _Purchas His Pilgrimes_ (1625). But, to\r\nquote:\r\n\r\n     Their most common drinke is _Coffa_, which is a blacke kinde of\r\n     drinke, made of a kind of Pulse like Pease, called _Coaua_; which\r\n     being grownd in the Mill, and boiled in water, they drinke it as\r\n     hot as they can suffer it; which they finde to agree very well with\r\n     them against their crudities, and feeding on hearbs and rawe\r\n     meates. Other compounded drinkes they have, called _Sherbet_, made\r\n     of Water and Sugar, or Hony, with Snow therein to make it coole;\r\n     for although the Countrey bee hot, yet they keepe Snow all the\r\n     yeere long to coole their drinke. It is accounted a great curtesie\r\n     amongst them to give unto their frends when they come to visit\r\n     them, a Fin-ion or Scudella of _Coffa_, which is more holesome than\r\n     toothsome, for it causeth good concoction, and driveth away\r\n     drowsinesse.\r\n\r\n     Some of them will also drinke Bersh or Opium, which maketh them\r\n     forget themselves, and talk idely of Castles in the Ayre, as though\r\n     they saw Visions, and heard Revelations. Their _Coffa_ houses are\r\n     more common than Ale-houses in England; but they use not so much to\r\n     sit in the houses, as on benches on both sides the streets, neere\r\n     unto a Coffa house, every man with his Fin-ionful; which being\r\n     smoking hot, they use to put it to their Noses & Eares, and then\r\n     sup it off by leasure, being full of idle and Ale-house talke\r\n     whiles they are amongst themselves drinking it; if there be any\r\n     news, it is talked of there.\r\n\r\nAmong other early English references to coffee we find an interesting\r\none by Sir George Sandys (1577-1644), the poet, who gave a start to\r\nclassical scholarship in America by translating Ovid's _Metamorphoses_\r\nduring his pioneer days in Virginia. In 1610 he spent a year in Turkey,\r\nEgypt, and Palestine, and records of the Turks:[52]\r\n\r\n     Although they be destitute of Taverns, yet have they their\r\n     Coffa-houses, which something resemble them. There sit they\r\n     chatting most of the day; and sippe of a drinke called Coffa (of\r\n     the berry that it is made of) in little _China_ dishes as hot as\r\n     they can suffer it: blacke as soote, and tasting not much unlike it\r\n     (why not that blacke broth which was in use amongst the\r\n     _Lacedemonians_?) which helpeth, as they say, digestion, and\r\n     procureth alacrity: many of the Coffa-men keeping beautifull boyes,\r\n     who serve as stales to procure them customers.\r\n\r\nEdward Terry (1590-1660), an English traveler, writes, under date of\r\n1616, that many of the best people in India who are strict in their\r\nreligion and drink no wine at all, \"use a liquor more wholesome than\r\npleasant, they call coffee; made by a black Seed boyld in water, which\r\nturnes it almost into the same colour, but doth very little alter the\r\ntaste of the water [!], notwithstanding it is very good to help\r\nDigestion, to quicken the Spirits and to cleanse the Blood.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration#: FIRST PRINTED REFERENCE TO COFFEE IN ENGLISH, 1598\r\n\r\nIt appears as _Chaona_ (_chaoua_) in the second line of the roman text\r\nnotation by Paludanus]\r\n\r\nIn 1623, Francis Bacon (1561-1626), in his _Historia Vitae et Mortis_\r\nsays: \"The Turkes use a kind of herb which they call _caphe_\"; and, in\r\n1624, in his _Sylva Sylvarum_[53] (published in 1627, after his death),\r\nhe writes:\r\n\r\n     They have in Turkey a drink called _coffa_ made of a berry of the\r\n     same name, as black as soot, and of a strong scent, but not\r\n     aromatical; which they take, beaten into powder, in water, as hot\r\n     as they can drink it: and they take it, and sit at it in their\r\n     coffa-houses, which are like our taverns. This drink comforteth the\r\n     brain and heart, and helpeth digestion. Certainly this berry coffa,\r\n     the root and leaf betel, the leaf tobacco, and the tear of poppy\r\n     (opium) of which the Turks are great takers (supposing it expelleth\r\n     all fear), do all condense the spirits, and make them strong and\r\n     aleger. But it seemeth they were taken after several manners; for\r\n     coffa and opium are taken down, tobacco but in smoke, and betel is\r\n     but champed in the mouth with a little lime.\r\n\r\nRobert Burton (1577-1640), English philosopher and humorist, in his\r\n_Anatomy of Melancholy_[54] writes in 1632:\r\n\r\n     The Turkes have a drinke called coffa (for they use no wine), so\r\n     named of a berry as blacke as soot and as bitter (like that blacke\r\n     drinke which was in use amongst the Lacedemonians and perhaps the\r\n     same), which they sip still of, and sup as warme as they can\r\n     suffer; they spend much time in those coffa-houses, which are\r\n     somewhat like our Ale-houses or Taverns, and there they sit,\r\n     chatting and drinking, to drive away the time, and to be merry\r\n     together, because they find, by experience, that kinde of drinke so\r\n     used, helpeth digestion and procureth alacrity.\r\n\r\nLater English scholars, however, found sufficient evidence in the works\r\nof Arabian authors to assure their readers that coffee sometimes breeds\r\nmelancholy, causes headache, and \"maketh lean much.\" One of these, Dr.\r\nPocoke, (1659: see chapter III) stated that, \"he that would drink it for\r\nlivelinesse sake, and to discusse slothfulnesse ... let him use much\r\nsweet meates with it, and oyle of pistaccioes, and butter. Some drink it\r\nwith milk, but it is an error, and such as may bring in danger of the\r\nleprosy.\" Another writer observed that any ill effects caused by coffee,\r\nunlike those of tea, etc., ceased when its use was discontinued. In this\r\nconnection it is interesting to note that in 1785 Dr. Benjamin Mosely,\r\nphysician to the Chelsea Hospital, member of the College of Physicians,\r\netc., probably having in mind the popular idea that the Arabic original\r\nof the word coffee meant force, or vigor, once expressed the hope that\r\nthe coffee drink might return to popular favor in England as \"a cheap\r\nsubstitute for those enervating teas and beverages which produce the\r\npernicious habit of dram-drinking.\"\r\n\r\nAbout 1628, Sir Thomas Herbert (1606-1681), English traveler and writer,\r\nrecords among his observations on the Persians that:\r\n\r\n     \"They drink above all the rest _Coho_ or _Copha_: by Turk and Arab\r\n     called _Caphe_ and _Cahua_: a drink imitating that in the Stigian\r\n     lake, black, thick, and bitter: destrain'd from _Bunchy_, _Bunnu_,\r\n     or Bay berries; wholesome, they say, if hot, for it expels\r\n     melancholy ... but not so much regarded for those good properties,\r\n     as from a Romance that it was invented and brew'd by Gabriel ... to\r\n     restore the decayed radical Moysture of kind hearted Mahomet.\"[55]\r\n\r\nIn 1634, Sir Henry Blount (1602-82), sometimes referred to as \"the\r\nfather of the English coffee house,\" made a journey on a Venetian galley\r\ninto the Levant. He was invited to drink _cauphe_ in the presence of\r\nAmurath IV; and later, in Egypt, he tells of being served the beverage\r\nagain \"in a porcelaine dish\". This is how he describes the drink in\r\nTurkey:[56]\r\n\r\n     They have another drink not good at meat, called _Cauphe_, made of\r\n     a _Berry_ as big as a small _Bean_, dried in a Furnace, and beat to\r\n     Pouder, of a Soot-colour, in taste a little bitterish, that they\r\n     seeth and drink as hot as may be endured: It is good all hours of\r\n     the day, but especially morning and evening, when to that purpose,\r\n     they entertain themselves two or three hours in _Cauphe-houses_,\r\n     which in all Turkey abound more than _Inns_ and _Ale-houses_ with\r\n     us; it is thought to be the old black broth used so much by the\r\n     _Lacedemonians_, and dryeth ill Humours in the stomach, comforteth\r\n     the Brain, never causeth Drunkenness or any other Surfeit, and is a\r\n     harmless entertainment of good Fellowship; for there upon Scaffolds\r\n     half a yard high, and covered with Mats, they sit Cross-leg'd after\r\n     the _Turkish_ manner, many times two or three hundred together,\r\n     talking, and likely with some poor musick passing up and down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST PRINTED REFERENCE TO \"COFFEE\" IN ENGLISH, IN ITS\r\nMODERN FORM, 1601\r\n\r\nPhotographed from the black-letter original of W. Parry's book in the\r\nWorth Library of the British Museum]\r\n\r\nThis reference to the Lacedæmonian black broth, first by Sandys, then\r\nby Burton, again by Blount, and concurred in by James Howell\r\n(1595-1666), the first historiographer royal, gave rise to considerable\r\ncontroversy among Englishmen of letters in later years. It is, of\r\ncourse, a gratuitous speculation. The black broth of the Lacedæmonians\r\nwas \"pork, cooked in blood and seasoned with salt and vinegar.[57]\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REFERENCES TO COFFEE AS FOUND IN BIDDULPH'S TRAVELS 1609\r\n\r\nFrom the black-letter original in the British Museum]\r\n\r\nWilliam Harvey (1578-1657), the famous English physician who discovered\r\nthe circulation of the blood, and his brother are reputed to have used\r\ncoffee before coffee houses came into vogue in London--this must have\r\nbeen previous to 1652. \"I remember\", says Aubrey[58], \"he was wont to\r\ndrinke coffee; which his brother Eliab did, before coffee houses were\r\nthe fashion in London.\" Houghton, in 1701, speaks of \"the famous\r\ninventor of the circulation of the blood, Dr. Harvey, who some say did\r\nfrequently use it.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough it seems likely that coffee must have been introduced into\r\nEngland sometime during the first quarter of the seventeenth century,\r\nwith so many writers and travelers describing it, and with so much\r\ntrading going on between the merchants of the British Isles and the\r\nOrient, yet the first reliable record we have of its advent is to be\r\nfound in the _Diary and Correspondence of John Evelyn, F.R.S._[59],\r\nunder \"Notes of 1637\", where he says:\r\n\r\n     There came in my time to the college (Baliol, Oxford) one Nathaniel\r\n     Conopios, out of Greece, from Cyrill, the Patriarch of\r\n     Constantinople, who, returning many years after was made (as I\r\n     understand) Bishop of Smyrna. He was the first I ever saw drink\r\n     coffee; which custom came not into England till thirty years\r\n     thereafter.\r\n\r\nEvelyn should have said thirteen years after; for then it was that the\r\nfirst coffee house was opened (1650).\r\n\r\nConopios was a native of Crete, trained in the Greek church. He became\r\n_primore_ to Cyrill, Patriarch of Constantinople. When Cyrill was\r\nstrangled by the vizier, Conopios fled to England to avoid a like\r\nbarbarity. He came with credentials to Archbishop Laud, who allowed him\r\nmaintenance in Balliol College.\r\n\r\n     It was observed that while he continued in Balliol College he made\r\n     the drink for his own use called Coffey, and usually drank it every\r\n     morning, being the first, as the antients of that House have\r\n     informed me, that was ever drank in Oxon.[60]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOL'S COFFEE HOUSE, EXETER, ENGLAND, NOW WORTH'S ART\r\nROOMS]\r\n\r\nIn 1640 John Parkinson (1567-1650), English botanist and herbalist,\r\npublished his _Theatrum Botanicum_[61], containing the first botanical\r\ndescription of the coffee plant in English, referred to as \"_Arbor Bon\r\ncum sua Buna._ The Turkes Berry Drinke\".\r\n\r\nHis work being somewhat rare, it may be of historical interest to quote\r\nthe quaint description here:\r\n\r\n     Alpinus, in his Booke of Egiptian plants, giveth us a description\r\n     of this tree, which as hee saith, hee saw in the garden of a\r\n     certain Captaine of the _Ianissaries_, which was brought out of\r\n     _Arabia felix_ and there planted as a rarity, never seene growing\r\n     in those places before.\r\n\r\n     The tree, saith _Alpinus_, is somewhat like unto the _Evonymus_\r\n     Pricketimber tree, whose leaves were thicker, harder, and greener,\r\n     and always abiding greene on the tree; the fruite is called _Buna_\r\n     and is somewhat bigger then an Hazell Nut and longer, round also,\r\n     and pointed at the end, furrowed also on both sides, yet on one\r\n     side more conspicuous than the other, that it might be parted in\r\n     two, in each side whereof lyeth a small long white kernell, flat on\r\n     that side they joyne together, covered with a yellowish skinne, of\r\n     an acid taste, and somewhat bitter withall and contained in a\r\n     thinne shell, of a darkish ash-color; with these berries generally\r\n     in _Arabia_ and _Egipt_, and in other places of the _Turkes_\r\n     Dominions, they make a decoction or drinke, which is in the stead\r\n     of Wine to them, and generally sold in all their tappe houses,\r\n     called by the name of _Caova_; _Paludanus_ saith _Chaova_, and\r\n     _Rauwolfius_ _Chaube_.\r\n\r\n     This drinke hath many good physical properties therein; for it\r\n     strengthened a week stomacke, helpeth digestion, and the tumors and\r\n     obstructions of the liver and spleene, being drunke fasting for\r\n     some time together.\r\n\r\nIn 1650, a certain Jew from Lebanon, in some accounts Jacob or Jacobs by\r\nname, in others Jobson[62], opened \"at the Angel in the parish of St.\r\nPeter in the East\", Oxford, the earliest English coffee house and \"there\r\nit [coffee] was by some who delighted in noveltie, drank\". Chocolate was\r\nalso sold at this first coffee house.\r\n\r\nAuthorities differ, but the confusion as to the name of the coffee-house\r\nkeeper may have arisen from the fact that there were two--Jacobs, who\r\nbegan in 1650; and another, Cirques Jobson, a Jewish Jacobite, who\r\nfollowed him in 1654.\r\n\r\nThe drink at once attained great favor among the students. Soon it was\r\nin such demand that about 1655 a society of young students encouraged\r\none Arthur Tillyard, \"apothecary and Royalist,\" to sell \"coffey\r\npublickly in his house against All Soules College.\" It appears that a\r\nclub composed of admirers of the young Charles met at Tillyard's and\r\ncontinued until after the Restoration. This Oxford Coffee Club was the\r\nstart of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nJacobs removed to Old Southhampton Buildings, London, where he was in\r\n1671.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the first coffee house in London had been opened by Pasqua\r\nRosée in 1652; and, as the remainder of the story of coffee's rise and\r\nfall in England centers around the coffee houses of old London, we shall\r\nreserve it for a separate chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY ENGLISH REFERENCE TO COFFEE BY SIR GEORGE SANDYS\r\n\r\nFrom the seventh edition of _Sandys' Travels_, London, 1673]\r\n\r\nOf course, the coffee-house idea, and the use of coffee in the home,\r\nquickly spread to other cities in Great Britain; but all the coffee\r\nhouses were patterned after the London model. Mol's coffee house at\r\nExeter, Devonshire, which is pictured on page 41, was one of the first\r\ncoffee houses established in England, and may be regarded as typical of\r\nthose that sprang up in the provinces. It had previously been a noted\r\nclub house; and the old hall, beautifully paneled with oak, still\r\ndisplays the arms of noted members. Here Sir Walter Raleigh and\r\ncongenial friends regaled themselves with smoking tobacco. This was one\r\nof the first places where tobacco was smoked in England. It is now an\r\nart gallery.\r\n\r\nWhen the Bishop of Berytus (Beirut) was on his way to Cochin China in\r\n1666, he reported that the Turks used coffee to correct the\r\nindisposition caused in the stomach by the bad water. \"This drink,\" he\r\nsays, \"imitates the effect of wine ... has not an agreeable taste but\r\nrather bitter, yet it is much used by these people for the good effects\r\nthey find therein.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1686, John Ray (1628-1704), one of the most celebrated of English\r\nnaturalists, published his _Universal History of Plants_, notable among\r\nother things for being the first work of its kind to extol the virtues\r\nof coffee in a scientific treatise.\r\n\r\nR. Bradley, professor of botany at Cambridge, published (1714) _A Short\r\nHistorical Account of Coffee_, all trace of which appears to be lost.\r\n\r\nDr. James Douglas published in London (1727) his _Arbor Yemensis fructum\r\nCofe ferens; or, a description and History of the Coffee Tree_, in which\r\nhe laid under heavy contribution the Arabian and French writers that had\r\npreceded him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE INTRODUCTION OF COFFEE INTO HOLLAND\r\n\r\n     _How the enterprising Dutch traders captured the first world's\r\n     market for coffee--Activities of the Netherlands East India\r\n     Company--The first coffee house at the Hague--The first public\r\n     auction at Amsterdam in 1711, when Java coffee brought forty-seven\r\n     cents a pound, green_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dutch had early knowledge of coffee because of their dealings with\r\nthe Orient and with the Venetians, and of their nearness to Germany,\r\nwhere Rauwolf first wrote about it in 1582. They were familiar with\r\nAlpini's writings on the subject in 1592. Paludanus, in his coffee note\r\non _Linschoten's Travels_, furnished further enlightenment in 1598.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch were always great merchants and shrewd traders. Being of a\r\npractical turn of mind, they conceived an ambition to grow coffee in\r\ntheir colonial possessions, so as to make their home markets\r\nheadquarters for a world's trade in the product. In considering modern\r\ncoffee-trading, the Netherlands East India Company may be said to be the\r\npioneer, as it established in Java one of the first experimental gardens\r\nfor coffee cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe Netherlands East India Company was formed in 1602. As early as 1614,\r\nDutch traders visited Aden to examine into the possibilities of coffee\r\nand coffee-trading. In 1616 Pieter Van dan Broeck brought the first\r\ncoffee from Mocha to Holland. In 1640 a Dutch merchant, named Wurffbain,\r\noffered for sale in Amsterdam the first commercial shipment of coffee\r\nfrom Mocha. As indicating the enterprise of the Dutch, note that this\r\nwas four years before the beverage was introduced into France, and only\r\nthree years after Conopios had privately instituted the breakfast coffee\r\ncup at Oxford.\r\n\r\nAbout 1650, Varnar, the Dutch minister resident at the Ottoman Porte,\r\npublished a treatise on coffee.\r\n\r\nWhen the Dutch at last drove the Portuguese out of Ceylon in 1658, they\r\nbegan the cultivation of coffee there, although the plant had been\r\nintroduced into the island by the Arabs prior to the Portuguese invasion\r\nin 1505. However, it was not until 1690 that the more systematic\r\ncultivation of the coffee plant by the Dutch was undertaken in Ceylon.\r\n\r\nRegular imports of coffee from Mocha to Amsterdam began in 1663. Later,\r\nsupplies began to arrive from the Malabar coast.\r\n\r\nPasqua Rosée, who introduced the coffee house into London in 1652, is\r\nsaid to have made coffee popular as a beverage in Holland by selling it\r\nthere publicly in 1664. The first coffee house was opened in the Korten\r\nVoorhout, the Hague, under the protection of the writer Van Essen;\r\nothers soon followed in Amsterdam and Haarlem.\r\n\r\nAt the instigation of Nicolaas Witsen, burgomaster of Amsterdam and\r\ngovernor of the East India Company, Adrian Van Ommen, commander of\r\nMalabar, sent the first Arabian coffee seedlings to Java in 1696,\r\nrecorded in the chapter on the history of coffee propagation. These were\r\ndestroyed by flood, but were followed in 1699 by a second shipment, from\r\nwhich developed the coffee trade of the Netherlands East Indies, that\r\nmade Java coffee a household word in every civilized country.\r\n\r\nA trial shipment of the coffee grown near Batavia was received at\r\nAmsterdam in 1706, also a plant for the botanical gardens. This plant\r\nsubsequently became the progenitor of most of the coffees of the West\r\nIndies and America.\r\n\r\nThe first Java coffee for the trade was received at Amsterdam 1711. The\r\nshipment consisted of 894 pounds from the Jakatra plantations and from\r\nthe interior of the island. At the first public auction, this coffee\r\nbrought twenty-three and two-thirds _stuivers_ (about forty-seven cents)\r\nper Amsterdam pound.\r\n\r\nThe Netherlands East India Company contracted with the regents of\r\nNetherlands India for the compulsory delivery of coffee; and the natives\r\nwere enjoined to cultivate coffee, the production thus becoming a forced\r\nindustry worked by government. A \"general system of cultivation\" was\r\nintroduced into Java in 1832 by the government, which decreed the\r\nemployment of forced labor for different products. Coffee-growing was\r\nthe only forced industry that existed before this system of cultivation,\r\nand it was the only government cultivation that survived the abolition\r\nof the system in 1905-08. The last direct government interest in coffee\r\nwas closed out in 1918. From 1870 to 1874, the government plantations\r\nyielded an average of 844,854 piculs[63] a year; from 1875 to 1878, the\r\naverage was 866,674 piculs. Between 1879 and 1883, it rose to 987,682\r\npiculs. From 1884 to 1888, the average annual yield was only 629,942\r\npiculs.\r\n\r\nHolland readily adopted the coffee house; and among the earliest coffee\r\npictures preserved to us is one depicting a scene in a Dutch coffee\r\nhouse of the seventeenth century, the work of Adriaen Van Ostade\r\n(1610-1675), shown on page 586.\r\n\r\nHistory records no intolerance of coffee in Holland. The Dutch attitude\r\nwas ever that of the constructionist. Dutch inventors and artisans gave\r\nus many new designs in coffee mortars, coffee roasters, and coffee\r\nserving-pots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE INTRODUCTION OF COFFEE INTO GERMANY\r\n\r\n     _The contributions made by German travelers and writers to the\r\n     literature of the early history of coffee--The first coffee house\r\n     in Hamburg opened by an English merchant--Famous coffee houses of\r\n     old Berlin--The first coffee periodical, and the first\r\n     kaffee-klatsch--Frederick the Great's coffee-roasting\r\n     monopoly--Coffee persecutions--\"Coffee-smellers\"--The first coffee\r\n     king_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen, Leonhard Rauwolf, in 1573, made his memorable\r\ntrip to Aleppo and, in 1582, won for Germany the honor of being the\r\nfirst European country to make printed mention of the coffee drink.\r\n\r\nAdam Olearius (or Oelschlager), a German Orientalist (1599-1671),\r\ntraveled in Persia as secretary to a German embassy in 1633-36. Upon his\r\nreturn he published an account of his journeys. In it, under date of\r\n1637, he says of the Persians:\r\n\r\n     They drink with their tobacco a certain black water, which they\r\n     call _cahwa_, made of a fruit brought out of Egypt, and which is in\r\n     colour like ordinary wheat, and in taste like Turkish wheat, and is\r\n     of the bigness of a little bean.... The Persians think it allays\r\n     the natural heat.\r\n\r\nIn 1637, Joh. Albrecht von Mandelsloh, in his _Oriental Trip_, mentions\r\n\"the black water of the Persians called _Kahwe_\", saying \"it must be\r\ndrunk hot.\"\r\n\r\nCoffee drinking was introduced into Germany about 1670. The drink\r\nappeared at the court of the great elector of Brandenburg in 1675.\r\nNorthern Germany got its first taste of the beverage from London, an\r\nEnglish merchant opening the first coffee house in Hamburg in 1679-80.\r\nRegensburg followed in 1689; Leipsic, in 1694; Nuremberg, in 1696;\r\nStuttgart, in 1712; Augsburg, in 1713; and Berlin, in 1721. In that year\r\n(1721) King Frederick William I granted a foreigner the privilege of\r\nconducting a coffee house in Berlin free of all rental charges. It was\r\nknown as the English coffee house, as was also the first coffee house in\r\nHamburg. And for many years, English merchants supplied the coffees\r\nconsumed in northern Germany; while Italy supplied southern Germany.\r\n\r\nOther well known coffee houses of old Berlin were, the Royal, in Behren\r\n_Strasse_; that of the Widow Doebbert, in the Stechbahn; the City of\r\nRome, in Unter-den-Linden; Arnoldi, in Kronen _Strasse_; Miercke, in\r\nTauben _Strasse_, and Schmidt, in Post _Strasse_.\r\n\r\nLater, Philipp Falck opened a Jewish coffee house in Spandauer\r\n_Strasse_. In the time of Frederick the Great (1712-1786) there were at\r\nleast a dozen coffee houses in the metropolitan district of Berlin. In\r\nthe suburbs were many tents where coffee was served.\r\n\r\nThe first coffee periodical, _The New and Curious Coffee House_, was\r\nissued in Leipsic in 1707 by Theophilo Georgi. The full title was _The\r\nNew and Curious Coffee House, formerly in Italy but now opened in\r\nGermany. First water debauchery. \"City of the Well.\" Brunnenstadt by\r\nLorentz Schoepffwasser_ [draw-water] 1707. The second issue gave the\r\nname of Georgi as the real publisher. It was intended to be in the\r\nnature of an organ for the first real German kaffee-klatsch. It was a\r\nchronicle of the comings and goings of the savants who frequented the\r\n\"Tusculum\" of a well-to-do gentleman in the outskirts of the city. At\r\nthe beginning the master of the house declared:\r\n\r\n     I know that the gentlemen here speak French, Italian and other\r\n     languages. I know also that in many coffee and tea meetings it is\r\n     considered requisite that French be spoken. May I ask, however,\r\n     that he who calls upon me should use no other language but German.\r\n     We are all Germans, we are in Germany; shall we not conduct\r\n     ourselves like true Germans?\r\n\r\nIn 1721 Leonhard Ferdinand Meisner published at Nuremberg the first\r\ncomprehensive German treatise on coffee, tea, and chocolate.\r\n\r\nDuring the second half of the eighteenth century coffee entered the\r\nhomes, and began to supplant flour-soup and warm beer at breakfast\r\ntables.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile coffee met with some opposition in Prussia and Hanover.\r\nFrederick the Great became annoyed when he saw how much money was paid\r\nto foreign coffee merchants for supplies of the green bean, and tried to\r\nrestrict its use by making coffee a drink of the \"quality\". Soon all the\r\nGerman courts had their own coffee roasters, coffee pots, and coffee\r\ncups.\r\n\r\nMany beautiful specimens of the finest porcelain cups and saucers made\r\nin Meissen, and used at court fêtes of this period, survive in the\r\ncollections at the Potsdam and Berlin museums. The wealthy classes\r\nfollowed suit; but when the poor grumbled because they could not afford\r\nthe luxury, and demanded their coffee, they were told in effect: \"You\r\nhad better leave it alone. Anyhow, it's bad for you because it causes\r\nsterility.\" Many doctors lent themselves to a campaign against coffee,\r\none of their favorite arguments being that women using the beverage must\r\nforego child-bearing. Bach's _Coffee Cantata_[64] (1732) was a notable\r\nprotest in music against such libels.\r\n\r\nOn September 13, 1777, Frederick issued a coffee and beer manifesto, a\r\ncurious document, which recited:\r\n\r\n     It is disgusting to notice the increase in the quantity of coffee\r\n     used by my subjects, and the amount of money that goes out of the\r\n     country in consequence. Everybody is using coffee. If possible,\r\n     this must be prevented. My people must drink beer. His Majesty was\r\n     brought up on beer, and so were his ancestors, and his officers.\r\n     Many battles have been fought and won by soldiers nourished on\r\n     beer; and the King does not believe that coffee-drinking soldiers\r\n     can be depended upon to endure hardship or to beat his enemies in\r\n     case of the occurrence of another war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RICHTER'S COFFEE HOUSE IN LEIPSIC--SEVENTEENTH CENTURY]\r\n\r\nFor a time beer was restored to its honored place; and coffee continued\r\nto be a luxury afforded only by the rich. Soon a revulsion of feeling\r\nset in; and it was found that even Prussian military rule could not\r\nenforce coffee prohibition. Whereupon, in 1781, finding that all his\r\nefforts to reserve the beverage for the exclusive court circles, the\r\nnobility, and the officers of his army, were vain, the king created a\r\nroyal monopoly in coffee, and forbade its roasting except in royal\r\nroasting establishments. At the same time, he made exceptions in the\r\ncases of the nobility, the clergy, and government officials; but\r\nrejected all applications for coffee-roasting licenses from the common\r\npeople. His object, plainly, was to confine the use of the drink to the\r\nelect. To these representatives of the cream of Prussian society, the\r\nking issued special licenses permitting them to do their own roasting.\r\nOf course, they purchased their supplies from the government; and as the\r\nprice was enormously increased, the sales yielded Frederick a handsome\r\nincome. Incidentally, the possession of a coffee-roasting license became\r\na kind of badge of membership in the upper class. The poorer classes\r\nwere forced to get their coffee by stealth; and, failing this, they fell\r\nback upon numerous barley, wheat, corn, chicory, and dried-fig\r\nsubstitutes, that soon appeared in great numbers.\r\n\r\nThis singular coffee ordinance was known as the \"_Déclaration du Roi\r\nconcernant la vente du café brûlé_\", and was published January 21, 1781.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE HOUSE IN GERMANY--MIDDLE OF THE SEVENTEENTH\r\nCENTURY]\r\n\r\nAfter placing the coffee _regie_ (revenue) in the hands of a Frenchman,\r\nCount de Lannay, so many deputies were required to make collections that\r\nthe administration of the law became a veritable persecution. Discharged\r\nwounded soldiers were mostly employed, and their principal duty was to\r\nspy upon the people day and night, following the smell of roasting\r\ncoffee whenever detected, in order to seek out those who might be found\r\nwithout roasting permits. The spies were given one-fourth of the fine\r\ncollected. These deputies made themselves so great a nuisance, and\r\nbecame so cordially disliked, that they were called \"coffee-smellers\" by\r\nthe indignant people.\r\n\r\nTaking a leaf out of Frederick's book, the elector of Cologne,\r\nMaximilian Frederick, bishop of Münster, (Duchy of Westphalia) on\r\nFebruary 17, 1784, issued a manifesto which said:\r\n\r\n     To our great displeasure we have learned that in our Duchy of\r\n     Westphalia the misuse of the coffee beverage has become so extended\r\n     that to counteract the evil we command that four weeks after the\r\n     publication of this decree no one shall sell coffee roasted or not\r\n     roasted under a fine of one hundred dollars, or two years in\r\n     prison, for each offense.\r\n\r\n     Every coffee-roasting and coffee-serving place shall be closed, and\r\n     dealers and hotel-keepers are to get rid of their coffee supplies\r\n     in four weeks. It is only permitted to obtain from the outside\r\n     coffee for one's own consumption in lots of fifty pounds. House\r\n     fathers and mothers shall not allow their work people, especially\r\n     their washing and ironing women, to prepare coffee, or to allow it\r\n     in any manner under a penalty of one hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n     All officials and government employees, to avoid a penalty of one\r\n     hundred gold florins, are called upon closely to follow and to keep\r\n     a watchful eye over this decree. To the one who reports such\r\n     persons as act contrary to this decree shall be granted one-half of\r\n     the said money fine with absolute silence as to his name.\r\n\r\nThis decree was solemnly read in the pulpits, and was published besides\r\nin the usual places and ways. There immediately followed a course of\r\n\"telling-ons\", and of \"coffee-smellings\", that led to many bitter\r\nenmities and caused much unhappiness in the Duchy of Westphalia.\r\nApparently the purpose of the archduke was to prevent persons of small\r\nmeans from enjoying the drink, while those who could afford to purchase\r\nfifty pounds at a time were to be permitted the indulgence. As was to be\r\nexpected, the scheme was a complete failure.\r\n\r\nWhile the king of Prussia exploited his subjects by using the state\r\ncoffee monopoly as a means of extortion, the duke of Württemberg had a\r\nscheme of his own. He sold to Joseph Suess-Oppenheimer, an unscrupulous\r\nfinancier, the exclusive privilege of keeping coffee houses in\r\nWürttemberg. Suess-Oppenheimer in turn sold the individual coffee-house\r\nlicenses to the highest bidders, and accumulated a considerable fortune.\r\nHe was the first \"coffee king.\"\r\n\r\nBut coffee outlived all these unjust slanders and cruel taxations of too\r\npaternal governments, and gradually took its rightful place as one of\r\nthe favorite beverages of the German people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KOLSCHITZKY, THE GREAT BROTHER-HEART, IN HIS BLUE BOTTLE\r\nCAFÉ, VIENNA, 1683\r\n\r\nFrom a lithograph after the painting by Franz Schams, entitled \"Das\r\nErste (Kulczycki'sche) Kaffee Haus\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTELLING HOW COFFEE CAME TO VIENNA\r\n\r\n     _The romantic adventure of Franz George Kolschitzky, who carried \"a\r\n     message to Garcia\" through the enemy's lines and won for himself\r\n     the honor of being the first to teach the Viennese the art of\r\n     making coffee, to say nothing of falling heir to the supplies of\r\n     the green beans left behind by the Turks; also the gift of a house\r\n     from a grateful municipality, and a statue after\r\n     death--Affectionate regard in which \"brother-heart\" Kolschitzky is\r\n     held as the patron saint of the Vienna kaffee-sieder--Life in the\r\n     early Vienna cafés_\r\n\r\n\r\nA romantic tale has been woven around the introduction of coffee into\r\nAustria. When Vienna was besieged by the Turks in 1683, so runs the\r\nlegend, Franz George Kolschitzky, a native of Poland, formerly an\r\ninterpreter in the Turkish army, saved the city and won for himself\r\nundying fame, with coffee as his principal reward.\r\n\r\nIt is not known whether, in the first siege of Vienna by the Turks in\r\n1529, the invaders boiled coffee over their camp fires that surrounded\r\nthe Austrian capital; although they might have done so, as Selim I,\r\nafter conquering Egypt in 1517, had brought with him to Constantinople\r\nlarge stores of coffee as part of his booty. But it is certain that when\r\nthey returned to the attack, 154 years later, they carried with them a\r\nplentiful supply of the green beans.\r\n\r\nMohammed IV mobilized an army of 300,000 men and sent it forth under his\r\nvizier, Kara Mustapha, (Kuprili's successor) to destroy Christendom and\r\nto conquer Europe. Reaching Vienna July 7, 1683, the army quickly\r\ninvested the city and cut it off from the world. Emperor Leopold had\r\nescaped the net and was several miles away. Nearby was the prince of\r\nLorraine, with an army of 33,000 Austrians, awaiting the succor promised\r\nby John Sobieski, king of Poland, and an opportunity to relieve the\r\nbesieged capital. Count Rudiger von Starhemberg, in command of the\r\nforces in Vienna, called for a volunteer to carry a message through the\r\nTurkish lines to hurry along the rescue. He found him in the person of\r\nFranz George Kolschitzky, who had lived for many years among the Turks\r\nand knew their language and customs.\r\n\r\nOn August 13, 1683, Kolschitzky donned a Turkish uniform, passed through\r\nthe enemy's lines and reached the Emperor's army across the Danube.\r\nSeveral times he made the perilous journey between the camp of the\r\nprince of Lorraine and the garrison of the governor of Vienna. One\r\naccount says that he had to swim the four intervening arms of the Danube\r\neach time he performed the feat. His messages did much to keep up the\r\nmorale of the city's defenders. At length King John and his army of\r\nrescuing Poles arrived and were consolidated with the Austrians on the\r\nsummit of Mount Kahlenberg. It was one of the most dramatic moments in\r\nhistory. The fate of Christian Europe hung in the balance. Everything\r\nseemed to point to the triumph of the crescent over the cross. Once\r\nagain Kolschitzky crossed the Danube, and brought back word concerning\r\nthe signals that the prince of Lorraine and King John would give from\r\nMount Kahlenberg to indicate the beginning of the attack. Count\r\nStarhemberg was to make a sortie at the same time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANZ GEORGE KOLSCHITZKY, PATRON SAINT OF VIENNA COFFEE\r\nLOVERS]\r\n\r\nThe battle took place September 12, and thanks to the magnificent\r\ngeneralship of King John, the Turks were routed. The Poles here rendered\r\na never-to-be-forgotten service to all Christendom. The Turkish invaders\r\nfled, leaving 25,000 tents, 10,000 oxen, 5,000 camels, 100,000 bushels\r\nof grain, a great quantity of gold, and many sacks filled with\r\ncoffee--at that time unknown in Vienna. The booty was distributed; but\r\nno one wanted the coffee. They did not know what to do with it; that is,\r\nno one except Kolschitzky. He said, \"If nobody wants those sacks, I will\r\ntake them\", and every one was heartily glad to be rid of the strange\r\nbeans. But Kolschitzky knew what he was about, and he soon taught the\r\nViennese the art of preparing coffee. Later, he established the first\r\npublic booth where Turkish coffee was served in Vienna.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the story of how coffee was introduced into Vienna, where\r\nwas developed that typical Vienna café which has become a model for a\r\nlarge part of the world. Kolschitzky is honored in Vienna as the patron\r\nsaint of coffee houses. His followers, united in the guild of coffee\r\nmakers (_kaffee-sieder_), even erected a statue in his honor. It still\r\nstands as part of the facade of a house where the Kolschitzygasse merges\r\ninto the Favoritengasse, as shown in the accompanying picture.\r\n\r\nVienna is sometimes referred to as the \"mother of cafés\". Café Sacher is\r\nworld-renowned. Tart à la Sacher is to be found in every cook-book. The\r\nViennese have their \"_jause_\" every afternoon. When one drinks coffee at\r\na Vienna café one generally has a _kipfel_ with it. This is a\r\ncrescent-shaped roll--baked for the first time in the eventful year\r\n1683, when the Turks besieged the city. A baker made these crescent\r\nrolls in a spirit of defiance of the Turk. Holding sword in one hand and\r\n_kipfel_ in the other, the Viennese would show themselves on top of\r\ntheir redoubts and challenge the cohorts of Mohammed IV.\r\n\r\nMohammed IV was deposed after losing the battle, and Kara Mustapha was\r\nexecuted for leaving the stores--particularly the sacks of coffee\r\nbeans--at the gates of Vienna; but Vienna coffee and Vienna _kipfel_ are\r\nstill alive, and their appeal is not lessened by the years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST COFFEE HOUSE IN THE LEOPOLDSTADT\r\n\r\nFrom a cut so titled in Bermann's _Alt und Neu Wien_]\r\n\r\nThe hero Kolschitzky was presented with a house by the grateful\r\nmunicipality; and there, at the sign of the Blue Bottle, according to\r\none account, he continued as a coffee-house keeper for many years.[65]\r\nThis, in brief, is the story that--although not authenticated in all\r\nits particulars--is seriously related in many books, and is firmly\r\nbelieved throughout Vienna.\r\n\r\nIt seems a pity to discredit the hero of so romantic an adventure; but\r\nthe archives of Vienna throw a light upon Kolschitzky's later conduct\r\nthat tends to show that, after all, this Viennese idol's feet were of\r\ncommon clay.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Kolschitzky, after receiving the sacks of green coffee\r\nleft behind by the Turks, at once began to peddle the beverage from\r\nhouse to house, serving it in little cups from a wooden platter. Later\r\nhe rented a shop in Bischof-hof. Then he began to petition the municipal\r\ncouncil, that, in addition to the sum of 100 ducats already promised him\r\nas further recognition of his valor, he should receive a house with good\r\nwill attached; that is, a shop in some growing business section. \"His\r\npetitions to the municipal council\", writes M. Bermann[66], \"are amazing\r\nexamples of measureless self-conceit and the boldest greed. He seemed\r\ndetermined to get the utmost out of his own self-sacrifice. He insisted\r\nupon the most highly deserved reward, such as the Romans bestowed upon\r\ntheir Curtius, the Lacedæmonians upon their Pompilius, the Athenians\r\nupon Seneca, with whom he modestly compared himself.\"\r\n\r\nAt last, he was given his choice of three houses in the Leopoldstadt,\r\nany one of them worth from 400 to 450 gulden, in place of the money\r\nreward, that had been fixed by a compromise agreement at 300 gulden. But\r\nKolschitzky was not satisfied with this; and urged that if he was to\r\naccept a house in full payment it should be one valued at not less than\r\n1000 gulden. Then ensued much correspondence and considerable haggling.\r\nTo put an end to the acrimonious dispute, the municipal council in 1685\r\ndirected that there should be deeded over to Kolschitzky and his wife,\r\nMaria Ursula, without further argument, the house known at that time as\r\n30 (now 8) Haidgasse.\r\n\r\nIt is further recorded that Kolschitzky sold the house within a year;\r\nand, after many moves, he died of tuberculosis, February 20, 1694, aged\r\nfifty-four years. He was courier to the emperor at the time of his\r\ndeath, and was buried in the Stefansfreithof Cemetery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATUE OF KOLSCHITZKY ERECTED BY THE COFFEE MAKERS GUILD\r\nOF VIENNA]\r\n\r\nKolschitzky's heirs moved the coffee house to Donaustrand, near the\r\nwooden Schlagbrücke, later known as Ferdinand's _brücke_ (bridge). The\r\ncelebrated coffee house of Franz Mosee (d. 1860) stood on this same\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nIn the city records for the year 1700 a house in the\r\nStock-im-Eisen-Platz (square) is designated by the words \"_allwo das\r\nerste kaffeegewölbe_\" (\"here was the first coffee house\").\r\nUnfortunately, the name of the proprietor is not given.\r\n\r\nMany stories are told of Kolschitzky's popularity as a coffee-house\r\nkeeper. He is said to have addressed everyone as _bruderherz_\r\n(brother-heart) and gradually he himself acquired the name _bruderherz_.\r\nA portrait of Kolschitzky, painted about the time of his greatest vogue,\r\nis carefully preserved by the Innung der Wiener Kaffee-sieder (the\r\nCoffee Makers' Guild of Vienna).\r\n\r\nEven during the lifetime of the first _kaffee-sieder_, a number of\r\nothers opened coffee houses and acquired some little fame. Early in the\r\neighteenth century a tourist gives us a glimpse of the progress made by\r\ncoffee drinking and by the coffee-house idea in Vienna. We read:\r\n\r\n     The city of Vienna is filled with coffee houses, where the\r\n     novelists or those who busy themselves with the newspapers delight\r\n     to meet, to read the gazettes and discuss their contents. Some of\r\n     these houses have a better reputation than others because such\r\n     _zeitungs-doctors_ (newspaper doctors--an ironical title) gather\r\n     there to pass most unhesitating judgment on the weightiest events,\r\n     and to surpass all others in their opinions concerning political\r\n     matters and considerations.\r\n\r\n     All this wins them such respect that many congregate there because\r\n     of them, and to enrich their minds with inventions and foolishness\r\n     which they immediately run through the city to bring to the ears of\r\n     the said personalities. It is impossible to believe what freedom is\r\n     permitted, in furnishing this gossip. They speak without reverence\r\n     not only of the doings of generals and ministers of state, but also\r\n     mix themselves in the life of the Kaiser (Emperor) himself.\r\n\r\nVienna liked the coffee house so well that by 1839 there were eighty of\r\nthem in the city proper and fifty more in the suburbs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE COFFEE HOUSES OF OLD LONDON\r\n\r\n     _One of the most picturesque chapters in the history of coffee--The\r\n     first coffee house in London--The first coffee handbill, and the\r\n     first newspaper advertisement for coffee--Strange coffee\r\n     mixtures--Fantastic coffee claims--Coffee prices and coffee\r\n     licenses--Coffee club of the Rota--Early coffee-house manners and\r\n     customs--Coffee-house keepers' tokens--Opposition to the coffee\r\n     house--\"Penny universities\"--Weird coffee substitutes--The proposed\r\n     coffee-house newspaper monopoly--Evolution of the club--Decline and\r\n     fall of the coffee house--Pen pictures of coffee-house life--Famous\r\n     coffee houses of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries--Some Old\r\n     World pleasure gardens--Locating the notable coffee houses_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two most picturesque chapters in the history of coffee have to do\r\nwith the period of the old London and Paris coffee houses of the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Much of the poetry and romance of\r\ncoffee centers around this time.\r\n\r\n\"The history of coffee houses,\" says D'Israeli, \"ere the invention of\r\nclubs, was that of the manners, the morals and the politics of a\r\npeople.\" And so the history of the London coffee houses of the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries is indeed the history of the\r\nmanners and customs of the English people of that period.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The First London Coffee House_\r\n\r\n\"The first coffee house in London,\" says John Aubrey (1626-97), the\r\nEnglish antiquary and folklorist, \"was in St. Michael's Alley, in\r\nCornhill, opposite to the church, which was sett up by one ... Bowman\r\n(coachman to Mr. Hodges, a Turkey merchant, who putt him upon it) in or\r\nabout the yeare 1652. 'Twas about four years before any other was sett\r\nup, and that was by Mr. Farr. Jonathan Paynter, over-against to St.\r\nMichael's Church, was the first apprentice to the trade, viz., to\r\nBowman.\"[67]\r\n\r\nAnother account, for which we are indebted to William Oldys (1696-1761),\r\nthe bibliographer, relates that Mr. Edwards, a London merchant, acquired\r\nthe coffee habit in Turkey, and brought home with him from Ragusa, in\r\nDalmatia, Pasqua Rosée, an Armenian or Greek youth, who prepared the\r\nbeverage for him. \"But the novelty thereof,\" says Oldys, \"drawing too\r\nmuch company to him, he allowed the said servant with another of his\r\nson-in-law to set up the first coffee house in London at St. Michael's\r\nAlley, in Cornhill.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this it would appear that Pasqua Rosée had as partner in this\r\nenterprise, the Bowman, who, according to Aubrey, was coachman to Mr.\r\nHodges, the son-in-law of Mr. Edwards, and a fellow merchant traveler.\r\n\r\nOldys tells us that Rosée and Bowman soon separated. John Timbs\r\n(1801-1875), another English antiquary, says they quarreled, Rosée\r\nkeeping the house, and his partner Bowman obtaining leave to pitch a\r\ntent and to sell the drink in St. Michael's churchyard.\r\n\r\nStill another version of this historic incident is to be found in\r\n_Houghton's Collection_, 1698. It reads:\r\n\r\n     It appears that a Mr. Daniel Edwards, an English merchant of\r\n     Smyrna, brought with him to this country a Greek of the name of\r\n     Pasqua, in 1652, who made his coffee; this Mr. Edwards married one\r\n     Alderman Hodges's daughter, who lived in Walbrook, and set up\r\n     Pasqua for a coffee man in a shed in the churchyard in St. Michael,\r\n     Cornhill, which is now a scrivener's brave-house, when, having\r\n     great custom, the ale-sellers petitioned the Lord Mayor against him\r\n     as being no freeman. This made Alderman Hodges join his coachman,\r\n     Bowman, who was free, as Pasqua's partner; but Pasqua, for some\r\n     misdemeanor, was forced to run the country, and Bowman, by his\r\n     trade and a contribution of 1000 sixpences, turned the shed to a\r\n     house. Bowman's apprentices were first, John Painter, then Humphry,\r\n     from whose wife I had this account.\r\n\r\nThis account makes it appear that Edwards was Hodges' son-in-law.\r\nWhatever the relationship, most authorities agree that Pasqua Rosée was\r\nthe first to sell coffee publicly, whether in a tent or shed, in London\r\nin or about the year 1652. His original shop-bill, or handbill, the\r\nfirst advertisement for coffee, is in the British Museum, and from it\r\nthe accompanying photograph was made for this work. It sets forth in\r\ndirect fashion: \"The Vertue of the _COFFEE_ Drink First publiquely made\r\nand sold in England, by _Pasqua Rosée_ ... in St. _Michaels Alley_ in\r\n_Cornhill_ ... at the Signe of his own Head.\"[68]\r\n\r\nH.R. Fox Bourne[69] (about 1870) is alone in an altogether different\r\nversion of this historic event. He says:\r\n\r\n\"In 1652 Sir Nicholas Crispe, a Levant merchant, opened in London the\r\nfirst coffee house known in England, the beverage being prepared by a\r\nGreek girl brought over for the work.\"\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to substantiate this story; the preponderance of\r\nevidence is in support of the Edwards-Rosée version.\r\n\r\nSuch then was the advent of the coffee house in London, which introduced\r\nto English-speaking people the drink of democracy. Oddly enough, coffee\r\nand the Commonwealth came in together. The English coffee house, like\r\nits French contemporary, was the home of liberty.\r\n\r\nRobinson, who accepts that version of the event wherein Edwards marries\r\nHodges's daughter, says that after the partners Rosée and Bowman\r\nseparated, and Bowman had set up his tent opposite Rosée, a zealous\r\npartisan addressed these verses \"To Pasqua Rosée, at the Sign of his own\r\nHead and half his Body in St. Michael's Alley, next the first\r\nCoffee-Tent in London\":\r\n\r\nWere not the fountain of my Tears\r\n  Each day exhausted by the steam\r\nOf your Coffee, no doubt appears\r\n  But they would swell to such a stream\r\nAs could admit of no restriction\r\nTo see, poor Pasqua, thy Affliction.\r\n\r\nWhat! Pasqua, you at first did broach\r\n  This Nectar for the publick Good,\r\nMust you call Kitt down from the Coach\r\n  To drive a Trade he understood\r\nNo more than you did then your creed,\r\nOr he doth now to write or read?\r\n\r\nPull Courage, Pasqua, fear no Harms\r\n  From the besieging Foe;\r\nMake good your Ground, stand to your Arms,\r\n  Hold out this summer, and then tho'\r\nHe'll storm, he'll not prevail--your Face[70]\r\nShall give the Coffee Pot the chace.\r\n\r\nEventually Pasqua Rosée disappeared, some say to open a coffee house on\r\nthe Continent, in Holland or Germany. Bowman, having married Alderman\r\nHodges's cook, and having also prevailed upon about a thousand of his\r\ncustomers to lend him sixpence apiece, converted his tent into a\r\nsubstantial house, and eventually took an apprentice to the trade.\r\n\r\nConcerning London's second coffee-house keeper, James Farr, proprietor\r\nof the Rainbow, who had as his most distinguished visitor Sir Henry\r\nBlount, Edward Hatton[71] says:\r\n\r\n     I find it recorded that one James Farr, a barber, who kept the\r\n     coffee-house which is now the Rainbow, by the Inner Temple Gate\r\n     (one of the first in England), was in the year 1657, prosecuted by\r\n     the inquest of St Dunstan's in the West, for making and selling a\r\n     sort of liquor called coffe, as a great nuisance and prejudice to\r\n     the neighborhood, etc., and who would then have thought London\r\n     would ever have had near three thousand such nuisances, and that\r\n     coffee would have been, as now, so much drank by the best of\r\n     quality and physicians?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST ADVERTISEMENT FOR COFFEE--1652\r\n\r\nHandbill used by Pasqua Rosée, who opened the first coffee house in\r\nLondon From the original in the British Museum]\r\n\r\nHatton evidently attributed Fair's nuisance to the coffee itself,\r\nwhereas the presentment[72] clearly shows it was in Farr's chimney and\r\nnot in the coffee.\r\n\r\nMention has already been made that Sir Henry Blount was spoken of as\r\n\"the father of English coffee houses\" and his claim to this distinction\r\nwould seem to be a valid one, for his strong personality \"stamped itself\r\nupon the system.\" His favorite motto, \"_Loquendum est cum vulgo,\r\nsentiendum cum sapientibus_\" (the crowd may talk about it; the wise\r\ndecide it), says Robinson, \"expresses well their colloquial purpose, and\r\nwas natural enough on the lips of one whose experience had been world\r\nwide.\" Aubrey says of Sir Henry Blount, \"He is now neer or altogether\r\neighty yeares, his intellectuals good still and body pretty strong.\"\r\n\r\nWomen played a not inconspicuous part in establishing businesses for the\r\nsale of the coffee drink in England, although the coffee houses were not\r\nfor both sexes, as in other European countries. The London City\r\n_Quaeries_ for 1660 makes mention of \"a she-coffee merchant.\" Mary\r\nStringar ran a coffee house in Little Trinity Lane in 1669; Anne Blunt\r\nwas mistress of one of the Turk's-Head houses in Cannon Street in 1672.\r\nMary Long was the widow of William Long, and her initials, together with\r\nthose of her husband, appear on a token issued from the Rose tavern in\r\nBridge Street, Covent Garden. Mary Long's token from the \"Rose coffee\r\nhouse by the playhouse\" in Covent Garden is shown among the group of\r\ncoffee-house keepers' tokens herein illustrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The First Newspaper Advertisement_\r\n\r\nThe first newspaper advertisement for coffee appeared, May 26, 1657, in\r\nthe _Publick Adviser_ of London, one of the first weekly pamphlets. The\r\nname of this publication was erroneously given as the _Publick\r\nAdvertiser_ by an early writer on coffee, and the error has been copied\r\nby succeeding writers. The first newspaper advertisement was contained\r\nin the issue of the _Publick Adviser_ for the week of May 19 to May 26,\r\nand read:\r\n\r\n     In _Bartholomew_ Lane on the back side of the Old Exchange, the\r\n     drink called _Coffee_, (which is a very wholsom and Physical drink,\r\n     having many excellent vertues, closes the Orifice of the Stomack,\r\n     fortifies the heat within, helpeth Digestion, quickneth the\r\n     Spirits, maketh the heart lightsom, is good against Eye-sores,\r\n     Coughs, or Colds, Rhumes, Consumptions, Head-ach, Dropsie, Gout,\r\n     Scurvy, Kings Evil, and many others is to be sold both in the\r\n     morning, and at three of the clock in the afternoon).\r\n\r\nChocolate was also advertised for sale in London this same year. The\r\nissue of the _Publick Adviser_ for June 16, 1657, contained this\r\nannouncement:\r\n\r\n     In Bishopgate Street, in Queen's Head Alley, at a Frenchman's house\r\n     is an excellent West India drink called chocolate, to be sold,\r\n     where you may have it ready at any time, and also unmade at\r\n     reasonable rates.\r\n\r\nTea was first sold publicly at Garraway's (or Garway's) in 1657.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Strange Coffee Mixtures_\r\n\r\nThe doctors were loath to let coffee escape from the mysteries of the\r\npharmacopoeia and become \"a simple and refreshing beverage\" that any\r\none might obtain for a penny in the coffee houses, or, if preferred,\r\nmight prepare at home. In this they were aided and abetted by many\r\nwell-meaning but misguided persons (some of them men of considerable\r\nintelligence) who seemed possessed of the idea that the coffee drink was\r\nan unpleasant medicine that needed something to take away its curse, or\r\nelse that it required a complex method of preparation. Witness \"Judge\"\r\nWalter Rumsey's _Electuary of Cophy_, which appeared in 1657 in\r\nconnection with a curious work of his called _Organon Salutis: an\r\ninstrument to cleanse the stomach_.[73] The instrument itself was a\r\nflexible whale-bone, two or three feet long, with a small linen or silk\r\nbutton at the end, and was designed to be introduced into the stomach to\r\nproduce the effect of an emetic. The electuary of coffee was to be taken\r\nby the patient before and after using the instrument, which the \"judge\"\r\ncalled his _Provang_. And this was the \"judge's\" \"new and superior way\r\nof preparing coffee\" as found in his prescription for making electuary\r\nof cophy:\r\n\r\n     Take equal quantity of Butter and Sallet-oyle, melt them well\r\n     together, but not boyle them: Then stirre them well that they may\r\n     incorporate together: Then melt therewith three times as much\r\n     Honey, and stirre it well together: Then add thereunto powder of\r\n     Turkish Cophie, to make it a thick Electuary.\r\n\r\nA little consideration will convince any one that the electuary was most\r\nlikely to achieve the purpose for which it was recommended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENT FOR COFFEE--1657]\r\n\r\nAnother concoction invented by the \"judge\" was known as \"wash-brew\",\r\nand included oatmeal, powder of \"cophie\", a pint of ale or any wine,\r\nginger, honey, or sugar to please the taste; to these ingredients butter\r\nmight be added and any cordial powder or pleasant spice. It was to be\r\nput into a flannel bag and \"so keep it at pleasure like starch.\" This\r\nwas a favorite medicine among the common people of Wales.\r\n\r\nThe book contained in a prefix an interesting historical document in the\r\nshape of a letter from James Howell (1595-1666) the writer and\r\nhistoriographer, which read:\r\n\r\n     Touching coffee, I concurre with them in opinion, who hold it to be\r\n     that black-broth which was us'd of old in Lacedemon, whereof the\r\n     Poets sing; Surely it must needs be salutiferous, because so many\r\n     sagacious, and the wittiest sort of Nations use it so much; as they\r\n     who have conversed with Shashes and Turbants doe well know. But,\r\n     besides the exsiccant quality it hath to dry up the crudities of\r\n     the Stomach, as also to comfort the Brain, to fortifie the sight\r\n     with its steem, and prevent Dropsies, Gouts, the Scurvie, together\r\n     with the Spleen and Hypocondriacall windes (all which it doth\r\n     without any violance or distemper at all.) I say, besides all these\r\n     qualities, 'tis found already, that this Coffee-drink hath caused a\r\n     greater sobriety among the nations; for whereas formerly\r\n     Apprentices and Clerks with others, used to take their mornings'\r\n     draught in Ale, Beer or Wine, which by the dizziness they cause in\r\n     the Brain, make many unfit for business, they use now to play the\r\n     Good-fellows in this wakefull and civill drink: Therefore that\r\n     worthy Gentleman, Mr. Mudiford[74], who introduced the practice\r\n     hereof first to London, deserves much respect of the whole nation.\r\n\r\nThe coffee drink at one time was mixed with sugar candy, and also with\r\nmustard. In the coffee houses, however, it was usually served black;\r\n\"few people then mixed it with either sugar or milk.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fantastic Coffee Claims_\r\n\r\nOne can not fail to note in connection with the introduction of coffee\r\ninto England that the beverage suffered most from the indiscretions of\r\nits friends. On the one hand, the quacks of the medical profession\r\nsought to claim it for their own; and, on the other, more or less\r\nignorant laymen attributed to the drink such virtues as its real\r\nchampions among the physicians never dreamed of. It was the favorite\r\npastime of its friends to exaggerate coffee's merits; and of its\r\nenemies, to vilify its users. All this furnished good \"copy\" for and\r\nagainst the coffee house, which became the central figure in each new\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\nFrom the early English author who damned it by calling it \"more\r\nwholesome than toothsome\", to Pasqua Rosée and his contemporaries, who\r\nurged its more fantastic claims, it was forced to make its way through a\r\nveritable morass of misunderstanding and intolerance. No harmless drink\r\nin history has suffered more at hands of friend and foe.\r\n\r\nDid its friends hail it as a panacea, its enemies retorted that it was a\r\nslow poison. In France and in England there were those who contended\r\nthat it produced melancholy, and those who argued it was a cure for the\r\nsame. Dr. Thomas Willis (1621-1673), a distinguished Oxford physician\r\nwhom Antoine Portal (1742-1832) called \"one of the greatest geniuses\r\nthat ever lived\", said he would sometimes send his patients to the\r\ncoffee house rather than to the apothecary's shop. An old broadside,\r\ndescribed later in this chapter, stressed the notion that if you \"do but\r\nthis Rare ARABIAN cordial use, and thou may'st all the Doctors Slops\r\nRefuse.\"\r\n\r\nAs a cure for drunkenness its \"magic\" power was acclaimed by its\r\nfriends, and grudgingly admitted by its foes. This will appear presently\r\nin a description of the war of the broadsides and the pamphlets. Coffee\r\nwas praised by one writer as a deodorizer. Another (Richard Bradley), in\r\nhis treatise concerning its use with regard to the plague, said if its\r\nqualities had been fully known in 1665, \"Dr. Hodges and other learned\r\nmen of that time would have recommended it.\" As a matter of fact, in\r\nGideon Harvey's _Advice against the Plague_, published in 1665, we find,\r\n\"coffee is commended against the contagion.\"\r\n\r\nThis is how the drink's sobering virtue was celebrated by the author of\r\nthe _Rebellious Antidote_:\r\n\r\nCome, Frantick Fools, leave off your Drunken fits.\r\nObsequious be and I'll recall your Wits,\r\nFrom perfect Madness to a modest Strain\r\nFor farthings four I'll fetch you back again,\r\nEnable all your mene with tricks of State,\r\nEnter and sip and then attend your Fate;\r\nCome Drunk or Sober, for a gentle Fee,\r\nCome n'er so Mad, I'll your Physician be.\r\n\r\nDr. Willis, in his _Pharmaceutice Rationalis_ (1674), was one of the\r\nfirst to attempt to do justice to both sides of the coffee question. At\r\nbest, he thought it a somewhat risky beverage, and its votaries must,\r\nin some cases, be prepared to suffer languor and even paralysis; it may\r\nattack the heart and cause tremblings in the limbs. On the other hand it\r\nmay, if judiciously used, prove a marvelous benefit; \"being daily drunk\r\nit wonderfully clears and enlightens each part of the Soul and disperses\r\nall the clouds of every Function.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a long time before recognition was obtained for the truth about\r\nthe \"novelty drink\"; especially that, if there were any beyond purely\r\nsocial virtues to be found in coffee, they were \"political rather than\r\nmedical.\"\r\n\r\nDr. James Duncan, of the Faculty of Montpellier, in his book _Wholesome\r\nAdvice against the Abuse of Hot Liquors_, done into English in 1706,\r\nfound coffee no more deserving of the name of panacea than that of\r\npoison.\r\n\r\nGeorge Cheyne (1671-1743), the noted British physician, proclaimed his\r\nneutrality in the words, \"I have neither great praise nor bitter blame\r\nfor the thing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Prices and Coffee Licenses_\r\n\r\nCoffee, with tea and chocolate, was first mentioned in the English\r\nStatute books in 1660, when a duty of four pence was laid upon every\r\ngallon made and sold, \"to be paid by the maker.\" Coffee was classed by\r\nthe House of Commons with \"other outlandish drinks.\"\r\n\r\nIt is recorded in 1662 that \"the right coffee powder\" was being sold at\r\nthe Turk's Head coffee house in Exchange Alley for \"4s. to 6s. 8d. per\r\npound; that pounded in a mortar, 2s; East India berry, 1s. 6d.; and the\r\nright Turkie berry, well garbled [ground] at 3s. The ungarbled [in the\r\nbean] for less with directions how to use the same.\" Chocolate was also\r\nto be had at \"2s. 6d. the pound; the perfumed from 4s. to 10s.\"\r\n\r\nAt one time coffee sold for five guineas a pound in England, and even\r\nforty crowns (about forty-eight dollars) a pound was paid for it.\r\n\r\nIn 1663, all English coffee houses were required to be licensed; the fee\r\nwas twelve pence. Failure to obtain a license was punished by a fine of\r\nfive pounds for every month's violation of the law. The coffee houses\r\nwere under close surveillance by government officials. One of these was\r\nMuddiman, a good scholar and an \"arch rogue\", who had formerly \"written\r\nfor the Parliament\" but who later became a paid spy. L'Estrange, who had\r\na patent on \"the sole right of intelligence\", wrote in his\r\n_Intelligencer_ that he was alarmed at the ill effects of \"the ordinary\r\nwritten papers of Parliament's news ... making coffee houses and all the\r\npopular clubs judges of those councils and deliberations which they have\r\nnothing to do with at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe first royal warrant for coffee was given by Charles II to Alexander\r\nMan, a Scotsman who had followed General Monk to London, and set up in\r\nWhitehall. Here he advertised himself as \"coffee man to Charles II.\"\r\n\r\nOwing to increased taxes on tea, coffee, and newspapers, near the end of\r\nQueen Anne's reign (1714) coffee-house keepers generally raised their\r\nprices as follows: Coffee, two pence per dish; green tea, one and a half\r\npence per dish. All drams, two pence per dram. At retail, coffee was\r\nthen sold for five shillings per pound; while tea brought from twelve to\r\ntwenty-eight shillings per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Club of The Rota_\r\n\r\n\"Coffee and Commonwealth\", says a pamphleteer of 1665, \"came in together\r\nfor a Reformation, to make 's a free and sober nation.\" The writer\r\nargues that liberty of speech should be allowed, \"where men of differing\r\njudgements croud\"; and he adds, \"that's a coffee-house, for where should\r\nmen discourse so free as there?\" Robinson's comments are apt:\r\n\r\n     Now perhaps we do not always connect the ideas of sociableness and\r\n     freedom of discussion with the days of Puritan rule; yet it must be\r\n     admitted that something like geniality and openness characterized\r\n     what Pepys calls the Coffee Club of the Rota. This \"free and open\r\n     Society of ingenious gentlemen\" was founded in the year 1659 by\r\n     certain members of the Republican party, whose peculiar opinions\r\n     had been timidly expressed and not very cordially tolerated under\r\n     the Great Oliver. By the weak Government that followed, these views\r\n     were regarded with extreme dislike and with some amount of terror.\r\n\r\n\"They met\", says Aubrey, who was himself of their number, \"at the Turk's\r\nHead [Miles's coffee house] in New Palace Yard, Westminster, where they\r\ntake water, at one Miles's, the next house to the staires, where was\r\nmade purposely a large ovall table, with a passage in the middle for\r\nMiles to deliver his coffee.\"\r\n\r\nRobinson continues:\r\n\r\n     This curious refreshment bar and the interest with which the\r\n     beverage itself was regarded, were quite secondary to the\r\n     excitement caused by another novelty. When, after heated\r\n     disputation, a member desired to test the opinion of the meeting,\r\n     any particular point might, by agreement, be put to the vote and\r\n     then everything depended upon \"our wooden oracle,\" the first\r\n     balloting-box ever seen in England. Formal methods of procedure and\r\n     the intensely practical nature of the subjects discussed, combined\r\n     to give a real importance to this Amateur Parliament.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A COFFEE HOUSE IN THE TIME OF CHARLES II\r\n\r\nFrom a wood cut of 1674]\r\n\r\nThe Rota, or Coffee Club, as Pepys called it, was essentially a debating\r\nsociety for the dissemination of republican opinions. It was preceded\r\nonly, in the reign of Henry IV, by the club called La Court de Bone\r\nCompagnie; by Sir Walter Raleigh's Friday Street, or Bread Street, club;\r\nthe club at the Mermaid tavern in Bread Street, of which Shakespeare,\r\nBeaumont, Fletcher, Raleigh, Selden, Donne, _et al._, were members; and\r\n\"rare\" Ben Jonson's Devil tavern club, between Middle Temple Gate and\r\nTemple Bar.\r\n\r\nThe Rota derived its name from a plan, which it was designed to promote,\r\nfor changing a certain number of members of parliament annually by\r\nrotation. It was founded by James Harrington, who had painted it in\r\nfairest colors in his _Oceana_, that ideal commonwealth.\r\n\r\nSir William Petty was one of its members. Around the table, \"in a room\r\nevery evening as full as it could be crammed,\" says Aubrey, sat Milton\r\n(?) and Marvell, Cyriac Skinner, Harrington, Nevill, and their friends,\r\ndiscussing abstract political questions.\r\n\r\nThe Rota became famous for its literary strictures. Among these was \"The\r\ncensure of the Rota upon Mr. Milton's book entitled _The ready and easie\r\nway to establish a free commonwealth_\" (1660), although it is doubtful\r\nif Milton was ever a visitor to this \"bustling coffee club.\" The Rota\r\nalso censured \"Mr. Driden's _Conquest of Granada_\" (1673).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Early Coffee-House Manners and Customs_\r\n\r\nAmong many of the early coffee-house keepers there was great anxiety\r\nthat the coffee house, open to high and low, should be conducted under\r\nsuch restraints as might secure the better class of customers from\r\nannoyance. The following set of regulations in somewhat halting rhyme\r\nwas displayed on the walls of several of the coffee houses in the\r\nseventeenth century:\r\n\r\nTHE RULES AND ORDERS OF THE COFFEE HOUSE.\r\n\r\nEnter, Sirs, freely, but first, if you please,\r\nPeruse our civil orders, which are these.\r\n\r\nFirst, gentry, tradesmen, all are welcome hither,\r\nAnd may without affront sit down together:\r\nPre-eminence of place none here should mind,\r\nBut take the next fit seat that he can find:\r\nNor need any, if finer persons come,\r\nRise up to assigne to them his room;\r\nTo limit men's expence, we think not fair,\r\nBut let him forfeit twelve-pence that shall swear;\r\nHe that shall any quarrel here begin,\r\nShall give each man a dish t' atone the sin;\r\nAnd so shall he, whose compliments extend\r\nSo far to drink in _coffee_ to his friend;\r\nLet noise of loud disputes be quite forborne,\r\nNo maudlin lovers here in corners mourn,\r\nBut all be brisk and talk, but not too much,\r\nOn sacred things, let none presume to touch.\r\nNor profane Scripture, nor sawcily wrong\r\nAffairs of state with an irreverent tongue:\r\nLet mirth be innocent, and each man see\r\nThat all his jests without reflection be;\r\nTo keep the house more quiet and from blame,\r\nWe banish hence cards, dice, and every game;\r\nNor can allow of wagers, that exceed\r\nFive shillings, which ofttimes much trouble breed;\r\nLet all that's lost or forfeited be spent\r\nIn such good liquor as the house doth vent.\r\nAnd customers endeavour, to their powers,\r\nFor to observe still, seasonable hours.\r\nLastly, let each man what he calls for pay,\r\nAnd so you're welcome to come every day.\r\n\r\nThe early coffee houses were often up a flight of stairs, and consisted\r\nof a single large room with \"tables set apart for divers topics.\" There\r\nis a reference to this in the prologue to a comedy of 1681 (quoted by\r\nMalone):\r\n\r\nIn a coffee house just now among the rabble\r\nI bluntly asked, which is the treason table?\r\n\r\nThis was the arrangement at Man's and others favored by the wits, the\r\n_literati_, and \"men of fashionable instincts.\" In the distinctly\r\nbusiness coffee houses separate rooms were provided at a later time for\r\nmercantile transactions. The introduction of wooden partitions--wooden\r\nboxes, as at a tavern--was also of somewhat later date.\r\n\r\nA print of 1674 shows five persons of different ranks in life, one of\r\nthem smoking, sitting on chairs around a coffee-house table, on which\r\nare small basins, or dishes, without saucers, and tobacco pipes, while a\r\ncoffee boy is serving coffee.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, only coffee was dispensed in the English coffee\r\nhouses. Soon chocolate, sherbert, and tea were added; but the places\r\nstill maintained their status as social and temperance factors.\r\nConstantine Jennings (or George Constantine) of the Grecian advertised\r\nchocolate, sherbert and tea at retail in 1664-65; also free instruction\r\nin the part of preparing these liquors. \"Drams and cordial waters were\r\nto be had only at coffee houses newly set up,\" says Elford the younger,\r\nwriting about 1689. \"While some few places added ale and beer as early\r\nas 1669, intoxicating liquors were not items of importance for many\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LONDON COFFEE HOUSE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\nFrom a wood cut of the period]\r\n\r\nAfter the fire of 1666, many new coffee houses were opened that were not\r\nlimited to a single room up a flight of stairs. Because the coffee-house\r\nkeepers over-emphasized the sobering qualities of the coffee drink, they\r\ndrew many undesirable characters from the taverns and ale houses after\r\nthe nine o'clock closing hour. These were hardly calculated to improve\r\nthe reputation of the coffee houses; and, indeed, the decline of the\r\ncoffee houses as a temperance institution would seem to trace back to\r\nthis attitude of false pity for the victims of tavern vices, evils that\r\nmany of the coffee houses later on embraced to their own undoing. The\r\nearly institution was unique, its distinctive features being unlike\r\nthose of any public house in England or on the Continent. Later on, in\r\nthe eighteenth century, when these distinctive features became\r\nobscured, the name coffee house became a misnomer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE HOUSE, QUEEN ANNE'S TIME--1702-14\r\n\r\nShowing coffee pots, coffee dishes, and coffee boy]\r\n\r\nHowever, Robinson says, \"the close intercourse between the habitués of\r\nthe coffee house, before it lost anything of its generous social\r\ntraditions and whilst the issue of the struggle for political liberty\r\nwas as yet uncertain, was to lead to something more than a mere jumbling\r\nor huddling together of opposites. The diverse elements gradually united\r\nin the bonds of common sympathy, or were forcibly combined by\r\npersecution from without until there resulted a social, political and\r\nmoral force of almost irresistible strength.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee-House Keepers' Tokens_\r\n\r\nThe great London fire of 1666 destroyed some of the coffee houses; but\r\nprominent among those that survived was the Rainbow, whose proprietor,\r\nJames Farr, issued one of the earliest coffee-house tokens, doubtless in\r\ngrateful memory of his escape. Farr's token shows an arched rainbow\r\nemerging from the clouds of the \"great fire,\" indicating that all was\r\nwell with him, and the Rainbow still radiant. On the reverse the medal\r\nwas inscribed, \"In Fleet Street--His Half Penny.\"\r\n\r\nA large number of these trade coins were put out by coffee-house keepers\r\nand other tradesmen in the seventeenth century as evidence of an amount\r\ndue, as stated thereon, by the issuer to the holder. Tokens originated\r\nbecause of the scarcity of small change. They were of brass, copper,\r\npewter, and even leather, gilded. They bore the name, address, and\r\ncalling of the issuer, the nominal value of the piece, and some\r\nreference to his trade. They were readily redeemed, on presentation, at\r\ntheir face value. They were passable in the immediate neighborhood,\r\nseldom reaching farther than the next street. C.G. Williamson writes:\r\n\r\n     Tokens are essentially democratic; they would never have been\r\n     issued but for the indifference of the Government to a public need;\r\n     and in them we have a remarkable instance of a people forcing a\r\n     legislature to comply with demands at once reasonable and\r\n     imperative. Taken as a whole series, they are homely and quaint,\r\n     wanting in beauty, but not without a curious domestic art of their\r\n     own.\r\n\r\nRobinson finds an exception to the general simplicity in the tokens\r\nissued by one of the Exchange Alley houses. The dies of these tokens are\r\nsuch as to have suggested the skilled workmanship of John Roettier. The\r\nmost ornate has the head of a Turkish sultan at that time famed for his\r\nhorrible deeds, ending in suicide; its inscription runs:\r\n\r\nMorat ye Great Men did mee call;\r\nWhere Eare I came I conquer'd all.\r\n\r\nA number of the most interesting coffee-house keepers' tokens in the\r\nBeaufoy collection in the Guildhall Museum were photographed for this\r\nwork, and are shown herewith. It will be observed that many of the\r\ntraders of 1660-75 adopted as their trade sign a hand pouring coffee\r\nfrom a pot, invariably of the Turkish-ewer pattern. Morat (Amurath) and\r\nSoliman were frequent coffee-house signs in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nJ.H. Burn, in his _Catalogue of Traders' Tokens_, recites that in 1672\r\n\"divers persons who presumed ... to stamp, coin, exchange and distribute\r\nfarthings, halfpence and pence of brass and copper\" were \"taken into\r\ncustody, in order to a severe prosecution\"; but upon submission, their\r\noffenses were forgiven, and it was not until the year 1675 that the\r\nprivate token ceased to pass current.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 1--COFFEE-HOUSE KEEPERS' TOKENS OF THE 17TH\r\nCENTURY\r\n\r\nDrawn for this work from the originals in the British Museum, and in the\r\nBeaufoy collection at the Guildhall Museum]\r\n\r\nA royal proclamation at the close of 1674 enjoined the prosecution of\r\nany who should \"utter base metals with private stamps,\" or \"hinder the\r\nvending of those half pence and farthings which are provided for\r\nnecessary exchange.\" After this, tokens were issued stamped \"necessary\r\nchange.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BROAD-SIDE OF 1663]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Opposition to the Coffee House_\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see why the coffee houses at once found favor among men of\r\nintelligence in all classes. Until they came, the average Englishman had\r\nonly the tavern as a place of common resort. But here was a public house\r\noffering a non-intoxicating beverage, and its appeal was instant and\r\nuniversal. As a meeting place for the exchange of ideas it soon attained\r\nwide popularity. But not without opposition. The publicans and ale-house\r\nkeepers, seeing business slipping away from them, made strenuous\r\npropaganda against this new social center; and not a few attacks were\r\nlaunched against the coffee drink. Between the Restoration and the year\r\n1675, of eight tracts written upon the subject of the London coffee\r\nhouses, four have the words \"character of a coffee house\" as part of\r\ntheir titles. The authors appear eager to impart a knowledge of the\r\ntown's latest novelty, with which many readers were unacquainted.\r\n\r\nOne of these early pamphlets (1662) was entitled _The Coffee Scuffle_,\r\nand professed to give a dialogue between \"a learned knight and a\r\npitifull pedagogue,\" and contained an amusing account of a house where\r\nthe Puritan element was still in the ascendant. A numerous company is\r\npresent, and each little group being occupied with its own subject, the\r\ngeneral effect is that of another Babel. While one is engaged in quoting\r\nthe classics, another confides to his neighbors how much he admires\r\nEuclid;\r\n\r\nA third's for a lecture, a fourth a conjecture,\r\nA fifth for a penny in the pound.\r\n\r\nTheology is introduced. Mask balls and plays are condemned. Others again\r\ndiscuss the news, and are deep in the store of \"mercuries\" here to be\r\nfound. One cries up philosophy. Pedantry is rife, and for the most part\r\nunchecked, when each 'prentice-boy \"doth call for his coffee in Latin\"\r\nand all are so prompt with their learned quotations that \"'t would make\r\na poor Vicar to tremble.\"\r\n\r\nThe first noteworthy effort attacking the coffee drink was a satirical\r\nbroadside that appeared in 1663. It was entitled _A Cup of Coffee: or,\r\nCoffee in its Colours_. It said:\r\n\r\nFor men and Christians to turn Turks, and think\r\nT'excuse the Crime because 'tis in their drink,\r\nIs more than Magick....\r\nPure English Apes! Ye may, for ought I know,\r\nWould it but mode, learn to eat Spiders too.\r\n\r\nThe writer wonders that any man should prefer coffee to canary, and\r\nrefers to the days of Beaumont, Fletcher, and Ben Jonson. He says:\r\n\r\nThey drank pure nectar as the gods drink too,\r\nSublim'd with rich Canary....\r\n                              shall then\r\nThese less than coffee's self, these coffee-men,\r\nThese sons of nothing, that can hardly make\r\nTheir Broth, for laughing how the jest doth take;\r\nYet grin, and give ye for the Vine's pure Blood\r\nA loathsome potion, not yet understood,\r\nSyrrop of soot, or Essence of old Shooes,\r\nDasht with Diurnals and the Books of news?\r\n\r\nThe author of _A Cup of Coffee_, it will be seen, does not shrink from\r\nusing epithets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 2--COFFEE-HOUSE KEEPERS' TOKENS OF THE 17TH\r\nCENTURY\r\n\r\nDrawn for this work from the originals in the British Museum, and in the\r\nBeaufoy collection at the Guildhall Museum]\r\n\r\n_The Coffee Man's Granado Discharged upon the Maiden's Complaint\r\nAgainst Coffee_, a dialogue in verse, also appeared in 1663.\r\n\r\n_The Character of a Coffee House, by an Eye and Ear Witness_ appeared in\r\n1665. It was a ten-page pamphlet, and proved to be excellent propaganda\r\nfor coffee. It is so well done, and contains so much local color, that\r\nit is reproduced here, the text Museum. The title page reads:\r\n\r\nThe\r\nCHARACTER\r\nOF A\r\nCOFFEE-HOUSE\r\nwherein\r\nIs contained a Description of the Persons\r\nusually frequenting it, with their Discourse\r\nand Humors,\r\nAs Also\r\nThe Admirable Vertues of\r\nCOFFEE\r\nBy an Eye and Ear Witness\r\n\r\n_When Coffee once was vended here,\r\nThe Alc'ron shortly did appear,\r\nFor our Reformers were such Widgeons.\r\nNew Liquors brought in new Religions._\r\n\r\nPrinted in the Year, 1665.\r\n\r\nThe text and the arrangement of the body of the pamphlet are as follows:\r\n\r\nTHE\r\nCHARACTER\r\nOF A\r\nCOFFEE-HOUSE\r\n\r\nTHE DERIVATION OF\r\nA COFFEE-HOUSE\r\n\r\nA _Coffee-house_, the learned hold\r\nIt is a place where _Coffee's_ sold;\r\nThis derivation cannot fail us,\r\nFor where _Ale's_ vended, that's an _Ale-house_.\r\n\r\n  This being granted to be true,\r\n'Tis meet that next the _Signs_ we shew\r\nBoth _where_ and _how_ to find this house\r\nWhere men such _cordial broth_ carowse.\r\nAnd if _Culpepper_ woon some glory\r\nIn turning the _Dispensatory_\r\nFrom _Latin_ into _English_; then\r\nWhy should not all good _English men_\r\nGive him much thanks who shews a _cure_\r\nFor all diseases men endure?\r\n\r\nSIGNS: HOW TO\r\nFIND IT OUT\r\n\r\nAs you along the streets do trudge,\r\nTo take the pains you must not grudge,\r\nTo view the Posts or Broomsticks where\r\nThe Signs of _Liquors_ hanged are.\r\nAnd if you see the great _Morat_\r\nWith Shash on's head instead of hat,\r\nOr any _Sultan_ in his dress,\r\nOr picture of a _Sultaness_,\r\nOr _John's_ admir'd curled pate,\r\nOr th' great _Mogul_ in's Chair of State,\r\nOr _Constantine_ the _Grecian_,\r\nWho fourteen years was th' onely man\r\nThat made _Coffee_ for th' great _Bashaw_,\r\nAlthough the man he never saw;\r\nOr if you see a _Coffee_-cup\r\nFil'd from a Turkish pot, hung up\r\nWithin the clouds, and round it _Pipes_,\r\n_Wax Candles_, _Stoppers_, these are types\r\nAnd certain signs (with many more\r\nWould be too long to write them 'ore,)\r\nWhich plainly do Spectators tell\r\nThat in that house they _Coffee_ sell.\r\nSome wiser than the rest (no doubt,)\r\nSay they can by the smell find't out;\r\nIn at a door (say they,) but thrust\r\nYour Nose, and if you scent _burnt Crust_,\r\nBe sure there's _Coffee_ sold that's good,\r\nFor so by most 'tis understood.\r\n\r\n  Now being enter'd, there's no needing\r\nOf complements or gentile breeding,\r\nFor you may seat you any where,\r\nThere's no respect of persons there;\r\nThen comes the _Coffee-man_ to greet you,\r\nWith welcome Sir, let me entreat you,\r\nTo tell me what you'l please to have,\r\nFor I'm your humble, humble slave;\r\nBut if you ask, what good does Coffee?\r\nHe'l answer, Sir, don't think I scoff yee,\r\nIf I affirm there's no disease\r\nMen have that drink it but find ease.\r\n\r\nTHE VERTUES\r\nOF COFFEE\r\n\r\n  Look, there's a man who takes the steem\r\nIn at his Nose, has an extreme\r\n_Worm_ in his pate, and giddiness,\r\nAsk him and he will say no less.\r\nThere sitteth one whose Droptick belly\r\nWas hard as flint, now's soft as jelly.\r\nThere stands another holds his head\r\n'Ore th' _Coffee_-pot, was almost dead\r\nEven now with Rhume; ask him hee'l say\r\nThat all his Rhum's now past away.\r\nSee, there's a man sits now demure\r\nAnd sober, was within this hour\r\nQuite drunk, and comes here frequently,\r\nFor 'tis his daily Malady,\r\nMore, it has such reviving power\r\n'Twill keep a man awake an houre,\r\nNay, make his eyes wide open stare\r\nBoth Sermon time and all the prayer.\r\nSir, should I tell you all the rest\r\nO' th' cures 't has done, two hours at least\r\nIn numb'ring them I needs must spend,\r\nScarce able then to make an end.\r\nBesides these vertues that's therein.\r\nFor any kind of _Medicine_,\r\nThe _Commonwealth-Kingdom_ I'd say,\r\nHas mighty reason for to pray\r\nThat still _Arabia_ may produce\r\nEnough of Berry for it's use:\r\nFor't has such strange magnetick force,\r\nThat it draws after't great concourse\r\nOf all degrees of persons, even\r\nFrom high to low, from morn till even;\r\nEspecially the _sober Party_,\r\nAnd News-mongers do drink't most hearty\r\nHere you'r not thrust into a _Box_\r\nAs _Taverns_ do to catch the _Fox_,\r\nBut as from th' top of _Pauls_ high steeple,\r\nTh' whole _City's_ view'd, even so all _people_\r\nMay here be seen;

It was reprinted in 1672 as _The Coffee\r\nHouse or News-mongers' Hall_.\r\n\r\nSeveral stanzas from these broadsides have been much quoted. They serve\r\nto throw additional light upon the manners of the time, and upon the\r\nkind of conversation met with in any well frequented coffee house of the\r\nseventeenth century, particularly under the Stuarts. They are finely\r\ndescriptive of the company characteristics of the early coffee houses.\r\nThe fifth stanza of the edition of 1667, inimical to the French, was\r\nomitted when the broadside was amended and reprinted in 1672, the year\r\nthat England joined with France and again declared war on the Dutch. The\r\nfollowing verses with explanatory notes are from Timbs:\r\n\r\nNEWS FROM THE COFFE HOUSE\r\n\r\nYou that delight in Wit and Mirth,\r\n  And long to hear such News,\r\nAs comes from all Parts of the _Earth_,\r\n  _Dutch_, _Danes_, and _Turks_, and _Jews_,\r\nI'le send yee to a Rendezvouz,\r\n  Where it is smoaking new;\r\nGo hear it at a _Coffe-house_,\r\n  _It cannot but be true_.\r\n\r\nThere Battles and Sea-Fights are Fought,\r\n  And bloudy Plots display'd;\r\nThey know more Things then ere was thought\r\n  Or ever was betray'd:\r\nNo Money in the Minting-house\r\n  Is halfe so Bright and New;\r\nAnd comming from a _Coffe-house_\r\n  _It cannot but be true_.\r\n\r\nBefore the _Navyes_ fall to Work,\r\n  They know who shall be Winner;\r\nThey there can tell ye what the _Turk_\r\n  Last _Sunday_ had to Dinner;\r\nWho last did Cut _Du Ruitters_[75] Corns,\r\n  Amongst his jovial Crew;\r\nOr Who first gave the _Devil_ Horns,\r\n  _Which cannot but be true_.\r\n\r\nA _Fisherman_ did boldly tell,\r\n  And strongly did avouch,\r\nHe Caught a Shoal of Mackarel,\r\n  That Parley'd all in _Dutch_,\r\nAnd cry'd out _Yaw, yaw, yaw Myne Here_;\r\n  But as the Draught they Drew\r\nThey Stunck for fear, that _Monck[76] was there_,\r\n  _Which cannot but be true_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere's nothing done in all the World,\r\n  From _Monarch_ to the _Mouse_\r\nBut every Day or Night 'tis hurld\r\n  Into the _Coffe-house_.\r\nWhat _Lillie_[77] or what _Booker_[78] can\r\n  By Art, not bring about,\r\nAt _Coffe-house_ you'l find a Man,\r\n  _Can quickly find it out_.\r\n\r\nThey know who shall in Times to come,\r\n  Be either made, or undone,\r\nFrom great _St. Peters street_ in _Rome_,\r\n  To _Turnbull-street_[79] in _London_;\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey know all that is Good, or Hurt,\r\n  To Dam ye, or to Save ye;\r\nThere is the _Colledge_, and the _Court_,\r\n  The _Country_, _Camp_ and _Navie_;\r\nSo great a _Universitie_,\r\n  I think there ne're was any;\r\nIn which you may a Schoolar be\r\n  For spending of a Penny.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere Men do talk of every Thing,\r\n  With large and liberal Lungs,\r\nLike Women at a Gossiping,\r\n  With double tyre of Tongues;\r\nThey'l give a Broad-side presently,\r\n  Soon as you are in view,\r\nWith Stories that, you'l wonder at,\r\n  Which they will swear are true.\r\n\r\nThe Drinking there of _Chockalat_,\r\n  Can make a _Fool_ a _Sophie_:\r\n'Tis thought the _Turkish Mahomet_\r\n  Was first Inspir'd with _Coffe_,\r\nBy which his Powers did Over-flow\r\n  The Land of _Palestine_:\r\nThen let us to, the _Coffe-house_ go,\r\n  'Tis Cheaper farr then Wine.\r\n\r\nYou shall know there, what Fashions are;\r\n  How Perrywiggs are Curl'd;\r\nAnd for a Penny you shall heare,\r\n  All Novells in the World.\r\nBoth Old and Young, and Great and Small,\r\n  And Rich, and Poore, you'l see;\r\nTherefore let's to the _Coffe_ All,\r\n  Come All away with Mee.\r\n\r\n          FINIS.\r\n\r\nRobert Morton made a contribution to the controversy in _Lines Appended\r\nto the Nature, Quality and Most Excellent Vertues of Coffee_ in 1670.\r\n\r\nThere was published in 1672 _A Broad-side Against Coffee, or the\r\nMarriage of the Turk_, verses that attained considerable fame because of\r\ntheir picturesque invective. They also stressed the fact that Pasqua\r\nRosées partner was a coachman, and imitated the broken English of the\r\nRagusan youth:\r\n\r\nA BROAD-SIDE AGAINST COFFEE;\r\n          OR, THE\r\n      MARRIAGE OF THE TURK\r\n\r\n_Coffee_, a kind of _Turkish Renegade_,\r\nHas late a match with _Christian water_ made;\r\nAt first between them happen'd a Demur,\r\nYet joyn'd they were, but not without great _stir_;\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Coffee_ was cold as _Earth, Water_ as _Thames_,\r\nAnd stood in need of recommending Flames;\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Coffee_ so brown as berry does appear,\r\nToo swarthy for a Nymph so fair, so clear:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Coachman was the first (here) _Coffee_ made,\r\nAnd ever since the rest _drive on_ the trade;\r\n_Me no good Engalash_! and sure enough,\r\nHe plaid the Quack to salve his Stygian stuff;\r\n_Ver boon for de stomach, de Cough, de Ptisick_\r\nAnd I believe him, for it looks like Physick.\r\n_Coffee_ a crust is charkt into a coal,\r\nThe smell and taste of the Mock _China_ bowl;\r\nWhere huff and puff, they labour out their lungs,\r\nLest _Dives_-like they should bewail their tongues.\r\nAnd yet they tell ye that it will not burn,\r\nThough on the Jury Blisters you return;\r\nWhose furious heat does make the water rise,\r\nAnd still through the Alembicks of your eyes.\r\nDread and desire, ye fall to't snap by snap,\r\nAs hungry Dogs do scalding porrige lap,\r\nBut to cure Drunkards it has got great Fame;\r\n_Posset_ or _Porrige_, will't not do the same?\r\nConfusion huddles all into one Scene,\r\nLike _Noah's_ Ark, the clean and the unclean.\r\nBut now, alas! the Drench has credit got,\r\nAnd he's no Gentleman that drinks it not;\r\nThat such a _Dwarf_ should rise to such a stature!\r\nBut Custom is but a remove from Nature.\r\nA _little_ Dish, and a _large_ Coffee-house,\r\nWhat is it, but a _Mountain_ and a _Mouse_?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Mens humana novitatis avidissima._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BROAD-SIDE OF 1670]\r\n\r\nAnd so it came to pass that coffee history repeated itself in England.\r\nMany good people became convinced that coffee was a dangerous drink. The\r\ntirades against the beverage in that far-off time sound not unlike the\r\nadvertising patter employed by some of our present-day coffee-substitute\r\nmanufacturers. It was even ridiculed by being referred to as \"ninny\r\nbroth\" and \"Turkey gruel.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BROAD-SIDE OF 1672]\r\n\r\n_A brief description of the excellent vertues of that sober and\r\nwholesome drink called coffee_ appeared in 1674 and proved an able and\r\ndignified answer to the attacks that had preceded it. That same year,\r\nfor the first time in history, the sexes divided in a coffee\r\ncontroversy, and there was issued _The Women's Petition against Coffee,\r\nrepresenting to public consideration the grand inconveniences accruing\r\nto their sex from the excessive use of the drying and enfeebling\r\nLiquor_, in which the ladies, who had not been accorded the freedom of\r\nthe coffee houses in England, as was the custom in France, Germany,\r\nItaly, and other countries on the Continent, complained that coffee made\r\nmen as \"unfruitful as the deserts where that unhappy berry is said to be\r\nbought.\" Besides the more serious complaint that the whole race was in\r\ndanger of extinction, it was urged that \"on a domestic message a husband\r\nwould stop by the way to drink a couple of cups of coffee.\"\r\n\r\nThis pamphlet is believed to have precipitated the attempt at\r\nsuppression by the crown the following year, despite the prompt\r\nappearing, in 1674, of _The Men's Answer to the Women's Petition Against\r\nCoffee, vindicating ... their liquor, from the undeserved aspersion\r\nlately cast upon them, in their scandalous pamphlet_.\r\n\r\nThe 1674 broadside in defense of coffee was the first to be illustrated;\r\nand for all its air of pretentious grandeur and occasional bathos, it\r\nwas not a bad rhyming advertisement for the persecuted drink. It was\r\nprinted for Paul Greenwood and sold \"at the sign of the coffee mill and\r\ntobacco-roll in Cloath-fair near West-Smithfield, who selleth the best\r\nArabian coffee powder and chocolate in cake or roll, after the Spanish\r\nfashion, etc.\" The following extracts will serve to illustrate its epic\r\ncharacter:\r\n\r\nWhen the sweet Poison of the Treacherous Grape,\r\nHad Acted on the world a General Rape;\r\nDrowning our very Reason and our Souls\r\nIn such deep Seas of large o'reflowing Bowls.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Foggy Ale, leavying up mighty Trains\r\nOf muddy Vapours, had besieg'd our Brains;\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen Heaven in Pity, to Effect our Cure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFirst sent amongst us this _All-healing-Berry_,\r\nAt once to make us both _Sober_ and _Merry_.\r\n\r\n  _Arabian_ Coffee, a Rich Cordial\r\nTo Purse and Person Beneficial,\r\nWhich of so many Vertues doth partake,\r\nIts Country's called Felix for its sake.\r\nFrom the Rich Chambers of the Rising Sun,\r\nWhere Arts, and all good Fashions first begun,\r\nWhere Earth with choicest Rarities is blest,\r\nAnd dying _Phoenix_ builds Her wondrous Nest:\r\nCOFFEE arrives, that Grave and wholesome Liquor,\r\nThat heals the Stomack, makes the Genius quicker,\r\nRelieves the Memory, Revives the Sad.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDo but this Rare ARABIAN Cordial Use,\r\nAnd thou may'st all the Doctors Slops Refuse.\r\nHush then, dull QUACKS, your Mountebanking cease,\r\nCOFFEE'S a speedier Cure for each Disease;\r\nHow great its Vertues are, we hence may think,\r\nThe Worlds third Part makes it their common Drink:\r\nIn Breif, all you who Healths Rich Treasures Prize,\r\nAnd Court not Ruby Noses, or blear'd Eyes,\r\nBut own Sobriety to be your Drift.\r\nAnd Love at once good Company and Thrift;\r\nTo Wine no more make Wit and Coyn a Trophy,\r\nBut come each Night and Frollique here in Coffee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BROAD-SIDE OF 1674\r\n\r\nThe first one to be illustrated]\r\n\r\nAn eight-page folio, the last argument to be issued in defense of coffee\r\nbefore Charles II sought to follow in the footsteps of Kair Bey and\r\nKuprili, was issued in the early part of 1675. It was entitled _Coffee\r\nHouses Vindicated. In answer to the late published Character of a Coffee\r\nHouse. Asserting from Reason, Experience and good Authors the Excellent\r\nUse and physical Virtues of that Liquor ... With the Grand Convenience\r\nof such civil Places of Resort and ingenious Conversation_.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of a coffee house compared with a \"publick-house\" is thus\r\nset forth:\r\n\r\n     First, In regard of easy expense. Being to wait for or meet a\r\n     friend, a tavern-reckoning soon breeds a purse-consumption: in an\r\n     ale house, you must gorge yourself with pot after pot.... But here,\r\n     for a penny or two, you may spend two or three hours, have the\r\n     shelter of a house, the warmth of a fire, the diversion of company;\r\n     and conveniency, if you please, of taking a pipe of tobacco; and\r\n     all this without any grumbling or repining. Secondly. For sobriety.\r\n     It is grown, by the ill influences of I know not what hydropick\r\n     stars, almost a general custom amongst us, that no bargain can be\r\n     drove, or business concluded between man and man, but it must be\r\n     transacted at some publick-house ... where continual sippings ...\r\n     would be apt to fly up into their brains, and render them drowsy\r\n     and indisposed ... whereas, having now the opportunity of a\r\n     coffee-house, they repair thither, take each man a dish or two (so\r\n     far from causing, that it cures any dizziness, or disturbant\r\n     fumes): and so, dispatching their business, go out more sprightly\r\n     about their affairs, than before.... Lastly, For diversion ...\r\n     where can young gentlemen, or shop-keepers, more innocently and\r\n     advantageously spend an hour or two in the evening than at a\r\n     coffee-house? Where they shall be sure to meet company, and, by the\r\n     custom of the house, not such as at other places stingy and\r\n     reserved to themselves, but free and communicative, where every man\r\n     may modestly begin his story, and propose to, or answer another, as\r\n     he thinks fit.... So that, upon the whole matter, spight of the\r\n     idle sarcasms and paltry reproaches thrown upon it, we may, with no\r\n     less truth than plainness, give this brief character of a\r\n     well-regulated coffee-house, (for our pen disdains to be an\r\n     advocate for any sordid holes, that assume that name to cloke the\r\n     practice of debauchery,) that it is the sanctuary of health, the\r\n     nursery of temperance, the delight of frugality, and academy of\r\n     civility, and free-school of ingenuity.\r\n\r\n_The Ale Wives' Complaint Against the Coffee-houses_, a dialogue between\r\na victualer's wife and a coffee man, at difference about spiriting away\r\neach other's trade, also was issued in 1675.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1666, and again in 1672, we find the government planning to\r\nstrike a blow at the coffee houses. By the year 1675, these \"seminaries\r\nof sedition\" were much frequented by persons of rank and substance, who,\r\n\"suitable to our native genius,\" says Anderson,[80] \"used great freedom\r\ntherein with respect to the courts' proceedings in these and like\r\npoints, so contrary to the voice of the people.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1672, Charles II, seemingly eager to emulate the Oriental intolerants\r\nthat preceded him, determined to try his hand at suppression. \"Having\r\nbeen informed of the great inconveniences arising from the great number\r\nof persons that resort to coffee-houses,\" the king \"desired the Lord\r\nKeeper and the Judges to give their opinion in writing as to how far he\r\nmight lawfully proceed against them.\"\r\n\r\nRoger North in his _Examen_ gives the full story; and D'Israeli,\r\ncommenting on it, says, \"it was not done without some apparent respect\r\nfor the British constitution.\" The courts affected not to act against\r\nthe law, and the judges were summoned to a consultation; but the five\r\nwho met could not agree in opinion.\r\n\r\nSir William Coventry spoke against the proposed measure. He pointed out\r\nthat the government obtained considerable revenue from coffee, that the\r\nking himself owed to these seemingly obnoxious places no small debt of\r\ngratitude in the matter of his own restoration; for they had been\r\npermitted in Cromwell's time, when the king's friends had used more\r\nliberty of speech than \"they dared to do in any other.\" He urged, also,\r\nthat it might be rash to issue a command so likely to be disobeyed.\r\n\r\nAt last, being hard pressed for a reply, the judges gave such a halting\r\nopinion in favor of the king's policy as to remind us of the reluctant\r\nverdict wrung from the physicians and lawyers of Mecca on the occasion\r\nof coffee's first persecution.[81] \"The English lawyers, in language\r\nwhich, for its civility and indefiniteness,\" says Robinson, \"would have\r\nbeen the envy of their Eastern brethren,\" declared that:\r\n\r\n     Retailing coffee _might_ be an innocent trade, as it _might_ be\r\n     exercised; but as it is used at present, in the nature of a common\r\n     assembly, to discourse of matters of State, news and _great\r\n     Persons_, as they are Nurseries of Idleness and Pragmaticalness,\r\n     and hinder the expence of our native Provisions, they _might_ be\r\n     thought common nuisances.\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made to mold public opinion to a favorable consideration\r\nof the attempt at suppression in _The Grand Concern of England\r\nexplained_, which was good propaganda for his majesty's enterprise, but\r\nutterly failed to carry conviction to the lovers of liberty.\r\n\r\nAfter much backing and filling, the king, on December 23, 1675, issued a\r\nproclamation which in its title frankly stated its object--\"for the\r\nsuppression of coffee houses.\" It is here given in a somewhat condensed\r\nform:\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE KING: A PROCLAMATION\r\nFOR THE SUPPRESSION OF\r\nCOFFEE HOUSES\r\n\r\n     _Charles R._\r\n\r\n     Whereas it is most apparent that the multitude of Coffee Houses of\r\n     late years set up and kept within this kingdom, the dominion of\r\n     Wales, and town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, and the great resort of Idle\r\n     and disaffected persons to them, have produced very evil and\r\n     dangerous effects; as well for that many tradesmen and others, do\r\n     herein mispend much of their time, which might and probably would\r\n     be employed in and about their Lawful Calling and Affairs; but\r\n     also, for that in such houses ... divers false, malitious and\r\n     scandalous reports are devised and spread abroad to the Defamation\r\n     of his Majestie's Government, and to the Disturbance of the Peace\r\n     and Quiet of the Realm; his Majesty hath thought fit and necessary,\r\n     that the said Coffee Houses be (for the future) Put down, and\r\n     suppressed, and doth ... strictly charge and command all manner of\r\n     persons, That they or any of them do not presume from and after the\r\n     Tenth Day of January next ensuing, to keep any Public Coffee House,\r\n     or to utter or sell by retail, in his, her or their house or houses\r\n     (to be spent or consumed within the same) any Coffee, Chocolet,\r\n     Sherbett or Tea, as they will answer the contrary at their utmost\r\n     perils ... (all licenses to be revoked).\r\n\r\n     Given at our Court at Whitehall, this third-and-twentieth day of\r\n     Dec., 1675, in the seven-and-twentieth year of our Reign.\r\n\r\n     GOD SAVE THE KING.\r\n\r\nAnd then a remarkable thing happened. It is not usual for a royal\r\nproclamation issued on the 29th of one month to be recalled on the 8th\r\nday of the next; but this is the record established by Charles II. The\r\nproclamation was made on December 23, 1675, and issued December 29,\r\n1675. It forbade the coffee houses to operate after January 10, 1676.\r\nBut so intense was the feeling aroused, that eleven days was sufficient\r\ntime to convince the king that a blunder had been made. Men of all\r\nparties cried out against being deprived of their accustomed haunts. The\r\ndealers in coffee, tea, and chocolate demonstrated that the proclamation\r\nwould greatly lessen his majesty's revenues. Convulsion and discontent\r\nloomed large. The king heeded the warning, and on January 8, 1676,\r\nanother proclamation was issued by which the first proclamation was\r\nrecalled.\r\n\r\nIn order to save the king's face, it was solemnly recited that \"His\r\nGracious Majesty,\" out of his \"princely consideration and royal\r\ncompassion\" would allow the retailers of coffee liquor to keep open\r\nuntil the 24th of the following June. But this was clearly only a royal\r\nsubterfuge, as there was no further attempt at molestation, and it is\r\nextremely doubtful if any was contemplated at the time the second\r\nproclamation was promulgated.\r\n\r\n\"Than both which proclamations nothing could argue greater guilt nor\r\ngreater weakness,\" says Anderson. Robinson remarks, \"A battle for\r\nfreedom of speech was fought and won over this question at a time when\r\nParliaments were infrequent and when the liberty of the press did not\r\nexist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Penny Universities_\"\r\n\r\nWe read in 1677 that \"none dare venture into the coffee houses unless he\r\nbe able to argue the question whether Parliament were dissolved or not.\"\r\n\r\nAll through the years remaining in the seventeenth century, and through\r\nmost of the eighteenth century, the London coffee houses grew and\r\nprospered. As before stated, they were originally temperance\r\ninstitutions, very different from the taverns and ale houses. \"Within\r\nthe walls of the coffee house there was always much noise, much clatter,\r\nmuch bustle, but decency was never outraged.\"\r\n\r\nAt prices ranging from one to two pence per dish, the demand grew so\r\ngreat that coffee-house keepers were obliged to make the drink in pots\r\nholding eight or ten gallons.\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth-century coffee houses were sometimes referred to as the\r\n\"penny universities\"; because they were great schools of conversation,\r\nand the entrance fee was only a penny. Two pence was the usual price of\r\na dish of coffee or tea, this charge also covering newspapers and\r\nlights. It was the custom for the frequenter to lay his penny on the\r\nbar, on entering or leaving. Admission to the exchange of sparkling wit\r\nand brilliant conversation was within the reach of all.\r\n\r\nSo great a _Universitie_\r\nI think there ne're was any;\r\nIn which you may a Schoolar be\r\nFor spending of a Penny.\r\n\r\n\"Regular customers,\" we are told, \"had particular seats and special\r\nattention from the fair lady at the bar, and the tea and coffee boys.\"\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the modern custom of tipping, and the word \"tip,\"\r\noriginated in the coffee houses, where frequently hung brass-bound boxes\r\ninto which customers were expected to drop coins for the servants. The\r\nboxes were inscribed \"To Insure Promptness\" and from the initial letters\r\nof these words came \"tip.\"\r\n\r\nThe _National Review_ says, \"before 1715 the number of coffee houses in\r\nLondon was reckoned at 2000.\" Dufour, who wrote in 1683, declares, upon\r\ninformation received from several persons who had staid in London, that\r\nthere were 3000 of these places. However, 2000 is probably nearer the\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nIn that critical time in English history, when the people, tired of the\r\nmisgovernment of the later Stuarts, were most in need of a forum where\r\nquestions of great moment could be discussed, the coffee house became a\r\nsanctuary. Here matters of supreme political import were threshed out\r\nand decided for the good of Englishmen for all time. And because many of\r\nthese questions were so well thought out then, there was no need to\r\nfight them out later. England's great struggle for political liberty was\r\nreally fought and won in the coffee house.\r\n\r\nTo the end of the reign of Charles II, coffee was looked upon by the\r\ngovernment rather as a new check upon license than an added luxury.\r\nAfter the revolution, the London coffee merchants were obliged to\r\npetition the House of Lords against new import duties, and it was not\r\nuntil the year 1692 that the government, \"for the greater encouragement\r\nand advancement of trade and the greater importation of the said\r\nrespective goods or merchandises,\" discharged one half of the obnoxious\r\ntariff.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Weird Coffee Substitutes_\r\n\r\nShortly after the \"great fire,\" coffee substitutes began to appear.\r\nFirst came a liquor made with betony, \"for the sake of those who could\r\nnot accustom themselves to the bitter taste of coffee.\" Betony is a herb\r\nbelonging to the mint family, and its root was formerly employed in\r\nmedicine as an emetic or purgative. In 1719, when coffee was 7s. a\r\npound, came bocket, later known as saloop, a decoction of sassafras and\r\nsugar, that became such a favorite among those who could not afford tea\r\nor coffee, that there were many saloop stalls in the streets of London.\r\nIt was also sold at Read's coffee house in Fleet Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Coffee Men Overreach Themselves_\r\n\r\nThe coffee-house keepers had become so powerful a force in the community\r\nin 1729 that they lost all sense of proportion; and we find them\r\nseriously proposing to usurp the functions of the newspapers. The\r\nvainglorious coffee men requested the government to hand over to them a\r\njournalistic monopoly; the argument being that the newspapers of the day\r\nwere choked with advertisements, filled with foolish stories gathered by\r\nall-too enterprising newswriters, and that the only way for the\r\ngovernment to escape \"further excesses occasioned by the freedom of the\r\npress\" and to rid itself of \"those pests of society, the unlicensed\r\nnewsvendors,\" was for it to intrust the coffee men, as \"the chief\r\nsupporters of liberty\" with the publication of a _Coffee House Gazette_.\r\nInformation for the journal was to be supplied by the habitués of the\r\nhouses themselves, written down on brass slates or ivory tablets, and\r\ncalled for twice daily by the _Gazette's_ representatives. All the\r\nprofits were to go to the coffee men--including the expected increase of\r\ncustom.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, this amazing proposal of the coffee-house masters to\r\nhave the public write its own newspapers met with the scorn and the\r\nderision it invited, and nothing ever came of it.\r\n\r\nThe increasing demand for coffee caused the government tardily to seek\r\nto stimulate interest in the cultivation of the plant in British\r\ncolonial possessions. It was tried out in Jamaica in 1730. By 1732 the\r\nexperiment gave such promise that Parliament, \"for encouraging the\r\ngrowth of coffee in His Majesty's plantations in America,\" reduced the\r\ninland duty on coffee coming from there, \"but of none other,\" from two\r\nshillings to one shilling six pence per pound. \"It seems that the French\r\nat Martinico, Hispaniola, and at the Isle de Bourbon, near Madagascar,\r\nhad somewhat the start of the English in the new product as had also the\r\nDutch at Surinam, yet none had hitherto been found to equal coffee from\r\nArabia, whence all the rest of the world had theirs.\" Thus writes Adam\r\nAnderson in 1787, somewhat ungraciously seeking to damn England's\r\nbusiness rivals with faint praise. Java coffee was even then in the\r\nlead, and the seeds of Bourbon-Santos were multiplying rapidly in\r\nBrazilian soil.\r\n\r\nThe British East India Company, however, was much more interested in tea\r\nthan in coffee. Having lost out to the French and Dutch on the \"little\r\nbrown berry of Arabia,\" the company engaged in so lively a propaganda\r\nfor \"the cup that cheers\" that, whereas the annual tea imports from 1700\r\nto 1710 averaged 800,000 pounds, in 1721 more than 1,000,000 pounds of\r\ntea were brought in. In 1757, some 4,000,000 pounds were imported. And\r\nwhen the coffee house finally succumbed, tea, and not coffee, was firmly\r\nintrenched as the national drink of the English people.\r\n\r\nA movement in 1873 to revive the coffee house in the form of a coffee\r\n\"palace,\" designed to replace the public house as a place of resort for\r\nworking men, caused the Edinburgh Castle to be opened in London. The\r\nmovement attained considerable success throughout the British Isles, and\r\neven spread to the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Evolution of the Club_\r\n\r\nEvery profession, trade, class, and party had its favorite coffee house.\r\n\"The bitter black drink called coffee,\" as Mr. Pepys described the\r\nbeverage, brought together all sorts and conditions of men; and out of\r\ntheir mixed association there developed groups of patrons favoring\r\nparticular houses and giving them character. It is easy to trace the\r\ntransition of the group into a clique that later became a club,\r\ncontinuing for a time to meet at the coffee house or the chocolate\r\nhouse, but eventually demanding a house of its own.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Decline and Fall of the Coffee House_\r\n\r\nStarting as a forum for the commoner, \"the coffee house soon became the\r\nplaything of the leisure class; and when the club was evolved, the\r\ncoffee house began to retrograde to the level of the tavern. And so the\r\neighteenth century, which saw the coffee house at the height of its\r\npower and popularity, witnessed also its decline and fall. It is said\r\nthere were as many clubs at the end of the century as there were coffee\r\nhouses at the beginning.\"\r\n\r\nFor a time, when the habit of reading newspapers descended the social\r\nladder, the coffee house acquired a new lease of life. Sir Walter Besant\r\nobserves:\r\n\r\n     They were then frequented by men who came, not to talk, but to\r\n     read; the smaller tradesmen and the better class of mechanic now\r\n     came to the coffee-house, called for a cup of coffee, and with it\r\n     the daily paper, which they could not afford to take in. Every\r\n     coffee-house took three or four papers; there seems to have been in\r\n     this latter phase of the once social institution no general\r\n     conversation. The coffee-house as a place of resort and\r\n     conversation gradually declined; one can hardly say why, except\r\n     that all human institutions do decay. Perhaps manners declined; the\r\n     leaders in literature ceased to be seen there; the city clerk began\r\n     to crowd in; the tavern and the club drew men from the\r\n     coffee-house.\r\n\r\nA few houses survived until the early years of the nineteenth century,\r\nbut the social side had disappeared. As tea and coffee entered the\r\nhomes, and the exclusive club house succeeded the democratic coffee\r\nforum, the coffee houses became taverns or chop houses, or, convinced\r\nthat they had outlived their usefulness, just ceased to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pen Pictures of Coffee-House Life_\r\n\r\nFrom the writings of Addison in the _Spectator_, Steele in the _Tatler_,\r\nMackay in his _Journey Through England_, Macaulay in his history, and\r\nothers, it is possible to draw a fairly accurate pen-picture of life in\r\nthe old London coffee house.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century the coffee room usually opened off the\r\nstreet. At first only tables and chairs were spread about on a sanded\r\nfloor. Later, this arrangement was succeeded by the boxes, or booths,\r\nsuch as appear in the Rowlandson caricatures, the picture of the\r\ninterior of Lloyds, etc.\r\n\r\nThe walls were decorated with handbills and posters advertising the\r\nquack medicines, pills, tinctures, salves, and electuaries of the\r\nperiod, all of which might be purchased at the bar near the entrance,\r\npresided over by a prototype of the modern English barmaid. There were\r\nalso bills of the play, auction notices, etc., depending upon the\r\ncharacter of the place.\r\n\r\nThen, as now, the barmaids were made much of by patrons. Tom Brown\r\nrefers to them as charming \"Phillises who invite you by their amorous\r\nglances into their smoaky territories.\"\r\n\r\nMessages were left and letters received at the bar for regular\r\ncustomers. Stella was instructed to address her letters to Swift, \"under\r\ncover to Addison at the St. James's coffee house.\" Says Macaulay:\r\n\r\n     Foreigners remarked that it was the coffee house which specially\r\n     distinguished London from all other cities; that the coffee house\r\n     was the Londoner's home, and that those who wished to find a\r\n     gentleman commonly asked, not whether he lived in Fleet Street or\r\n     Chancery Lane, but whether he frequented the Grecian or the\r\n     Rainbow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP SHOWING THE LOCATION OF MANY OF THE OLD LONDON\r\nCOFFEE HOUSES PREVIOUS TO THE FIRE OF 1748]\r\n\r\nSo every man of the upper or middle classes went daily to his coffee\r\nhouse to learn the news and to discuss it. The better class houses were\r\nthe meeting places of the most substantial men in the community. Every\r\ncoffee house had its orator, who became to his admirers a kind of\r\n\"fourth estate of the realm.\"\r\n\r\nMacaulay gives us the following picture of the coffee house of 1685:\r\n\r\n     Nobody was excluded from these places who laid down his penny at\r\n     the bar. Yet every rank and profession, and every shade of\r\n     religious and political opinion had its own headquarters.\r\n\r\n     There were houses near St. James' Park, where fops congregated,\r\n     their heads and shoulders covered with black or flaxen wigs, not\r\n     less ample than those which are now worn by the Chancellor and by\r\n     the Speaker of the House of Commons. The atmosphere was like that\r\n     of a perfumer's shop. Tobacco in any form than that of richly\r\n     scented snuff was held in abomination. If any clown, ignorant of\r\n     the usages of the house, called for a pipe, the sneers of the whole\r\n     assembly and the short answers of the waiters soon convinced him\r\n     that he had better go somewhere else.\r\n\r\n     Nor, indeed, would he have far to go. For, in general, the\r\n     coffee-houses reeked with tobacco like a guard room. Nowhere was\r\n     the smoking more constant than at Will's. That celebrated house,\r\n     situated between Covent Garden and Bow street, was sacred to polite\r\n     letters. There the talk was about poetical justice and the unities\r\n     of place and time. Under no roof was a greater variety of figures\r\n     to be seen. There were earls in stars and garters, clergymen in\r\n     cassocks and bands, pert Templars, sheepish lads from universities,\r\n     translators and index makers in ragged coats of frieze. The great\r\n     press was to get near the chair where John Dryden sate. In winter\r\n     that chair was always in the warmest nook by the fire; in summer it\r\n     stood in the balcony. To bow to the Laureate, and to hear his\r\n     opinion of Racine's last tragedy, or of Bossu's treatise on epic\r\n     poetry, was thought a privilege. A pinch from his snuff-box was an\r\n     honour sufficient to turn the head of a young enthusiast.\r\n\r\n     There were coffee-houses where the first medical men might be\r\n     consulted. Dr. John Radcliffe, who, in the year 1685, rose to the\r\n     largest practice in London, came daily, at the hour when the\r\n     Exchange was full, from his house in Bow street, then a fashionable\r\n     part of the capital, to Garraway's, and was to be found, surrounded\r\n     by surgeons and apothecaries, at a particular table.\r\n\r\n     There were Puritan coffee-houses where no oath was heard, and where\r\n     lank-haired men discussed election and reprobation through their\r\n     noses; Jew coffee-houses, where dark-eyed money changers from\r\n     Venice and Amsterdam greeted each other; and Popish coffee-houses,\r\n     where, as good Protestants believed, Jesuits planned over their\r\n     cups another great fire, and cast silver bullets to shoot the King.\r\n\r\nNed Ward gives us this picture of the coffee house of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. He is describing Old Man's, Scotland Yard:\r\n\r\n     We now ascended a pair of stairs, which brought us into an\r\n     old-fashioned room, where a gaudy crowd of odoriferous Tom-Essences\r\n     were walking backwards and forwards, with their hats in their\r\n     hands, not daring to convert them to their intended use lest it\r\n     should put the foretops of their wigs into some disorder. We\r\n     squeezed through till we got to the end of the room, where, at a\r\n     small table, we sat down, and observed that it was as great a\r\n     rarity to hear anybody call for a dish of politicians porridge, or\r\n     any other liquor, as it is to hear a beau call for a pipe of\r\n     tobacco; their whole exercise being to charge and discharge their\r\n     nostrils and keep the curls of their periwigs in their proper\r\n     order. The clashing of their snush-box lids, in opening and\r\n     shutting, made more noise than their tongues. Bows and cringes of\r\n     the newest mode were here exchanged 'twixt friend and friend with\r\n     wonderful exactness. They made a humming like so many hornets in a\r\n     country chimney, not with their talking, but with their whispering\r\n     over their new Minuets and Bories, with the hands in their pockets,\r\n     if only freed from their snush-box. We now began to be thoughtful\r\n     of a pipe of tobacco, whereupon we ventured to call for some\r\n     instruments of evaporation, which were accordingly brought us, but\r\n     with such a kind of unwillingness, as if they would much rather\r\n     been rid of our company; for their tables were so very neat, and\r\n     shined with rubbing like the upper-leathers of an alderman's shoes,\r\n     and as brown as the top of a country housewife's cupboard. The\r\n     floor was as clean swept as a Sir Courtly's dining room, which made\r\n     us look round to see if there were no orders hung up to impose the\r\n     forfeiture of so much mop-money upon any person that should spit\r\n     out of the chimney-corner. Notwithstanding we wanted an example to\r\n     encourage us in our porterly rudeness, we ordered them to light the\r\n     wax candle, by which we ignified our pipes and blew about our\r\n     whiffs; at which several Sir Foplins drew their faces into as many\r\n     peevish wrinkles as the beaux at the Bow Street Coffee-house, near\r\n     Covent Garden, did when the gentleman in masquerade came in amongst\r\n     them, with his oyster-barrel muff and turnip-buttons, to ridicule\r\n     their foperies.\r\n\r\nIn _A Brief and Merry History of Great Britain_ we read:\r\n\r\n     There is a prodigious number of Coffee-Houses in London, after the\r\n     manner I have seen some in Constantinople. These Coffee-Houses are\r\n     the constant Rendezvous for Men of Business as well as the idle\r\n     People. Besides Coffee, there are many other Liquors, which People\r\n     cannot well relish at first. They smoak Tobacco, game and read\r\n     Papers of Intelligence; here they treat of Matters of State, make\r\n     Leagues with Foreign Princes, break them again, and transact\r\n     Affairs of the last Consequence to the whole World. They represent\r\n     these Coffee-Houses as the most agreeable things in London, and\r\n     they are, in my Opinion, very proper Places to find People that a\r\n     Man has Business with, or to pass away the Time a little more\r\n     agreeably than he can do at home; but in other respects they are\r\n     loathsome, full of smoak, like a Guard-Room, and as much crowded. I\r\n     believe 'tis these Places that furnish the Inhabitants with\r\n     Slander, for there one hears exact Account of everything done in\r\n     Town, as if it were but a Village.\r\n\r\n     At those Coffee-Houses, near the Courts, called White's, St.\r\n     James's, Williams's, the Conversation turns chiefly upon the\r\n     Equipages, Essence, Horse-Matches, Tupees, Modes and Mortgages; the\r\n     Cocoa-Tree upon Bribery and Corruption, Evil ministers, Errors and\r\n     Mistakes in Government; the Scotch Coffee-Houses towards Charing\r\n     Cross, on Places and Pensions; the Tiltyard and Young Man's on\r\n     Affronts, Honour, Satisfaction, Duels and Rencounters. I was\r\n     informed that the latter happen so frequently, in this part of the\r\n     Town, that a Surgeon and a Sollicitor are kept constantly in\r\n     waiting; the one to dress and heal such Wounds as may be given, and\r\n     the other in case of Death to bring off the Survivor with a Verdict\r\n     of Se Devendendo or Manslaughter. In those Coffee-Houses about the\r\n     Temple the Subjects are generally on Causes, Costs, Demurrers,\r\n     Rejoinders and Exceptions; Daniel's the Welch Coffee-House in Fleet\r\n     Street, on Births, Pedigrees and Descents; Child's and the Chapter\r\n     upon Glebes, Tithes, Advowsons, Rectories and Lectureships; North's\r\n     Undue Elections, False Polling, Scrutinies, etc.; Hamlin's,\r\n     Infant-Baptism, Lay-Ordination, Free-Will, Election and\r\n     Reprobation; Batson's, the Prices of Pepper, Indigo and Salt-Petre;\r\n     and all those about the Exchange, where the Merchants meet to\r\n     transact their Affairs, are in a perpetual hurry about\r\n     Stock-Jobbing, Lying, Cheating, Tricking Widows and Orphans, and\r\n     committing Spoil and Rapine on the Publick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHITE'S AND BROOKES', ST. JAMES'S STREET]\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century beer and wine were commonly sold at the coffee\r\nhouses in addition to tea and chocolate. Daniel Defoe, writing of his\r\nvisit to Shrewsbury in 1724, says, \"I found there the most coffee houses\r\naround the Town Hall that ever I saw in any town, but when you come into\r\nthem they are but ale houses, only they think that the name coffee house\r\ngives a better air.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the coffee houses of the city, Besant says:\r\n\r\n     Rich merchants alone ventured to enter certain of the coffee\r\n     houses, where they transacted business more privately and more\r\n     expeditiously than on the Exchange. There were coffee houses where\r\n     officers of the army alone were found; where the city shopkeeper\r\n     met his chums; where actors congregated; where only divines, only\r\n     lawyers, only physicians, only wits and those who came to hear them\r\n     were found. In all alike the visitor put down his penny and went\r\n     in, taking his own seat if he was an habitue; he called for a cup\r\n     of tea or coffee and paid his twopence for it; he could call also,\r\n     if he pleased, for a cordial; he was expected to talk with his\r\n     neighbour whether he knew him or not. Men went to certain coffee\r\n     houses in order to meet the well-known poets and writers who were\r\n     to be found there, as Pope went in search of Dryden. The daily\r\n     papers and the pamphlets of the day were taken in. Some of the\r\n     coffee houses, but not the more respectable, allowed the use of\r\n     tobacco.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE HOUSE POLITICIANS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT FAIR ON THE FROZEN THAMES--1683\r\n\r\nFrom a broadside entitled _Wonders on the Deep_. Figure 2 is the Duke of\r\nYork's Coffee House]\r\n\r\nMackay, in his _Journey Through England_ (1724), says:\r\n\r\n     We rise by nine, and those that frequent great men's levees find\r\n     entertainment at them till eleven, or, as in Holland, go to\r\n     tea-tables; about twelve the _beau monde_ assemble in several\r\n     coffee or chocolate houses; the best of which are the Cocoatree and\r\n     White's chocolate houses, St. James', the Smyrna, Mrs. Rochford's\r\n     and the British coffee houses; and all these so near one another\r\n     that in less than an hour you see the company of them all. We are\r\n     carried to these places in chairs (or sedans), which are here very\r\n     cheap, a guinea a week, or a shilling per hour, and your chairmen\r\n     serve you for porters to run on errands, as your gondoliers do at\r\n     Venice.\r\n\r\n     If it be fine weather we take a turn into the park till two, when\r\n     we go to dinner; and if it be dirty, you are entertained at picquet\r\n     or basset at White's, or you may talk politics at the Smyrna or St.\r\n     James'. I must not forget to tell you that the parties have their\r\n     different places, where, however, a stranger is always well\r\n     received; but a Whig will no more go to the Cocoatree than a Tory\r\n     will be seen at the Coffee House, St James'.\r\n\r\n     The Scots go generally to the British, and a mixture of all sorts\r\n     go to the Smyrna. There are other little coffee houses much\r\n     frequented in this neighborhood--Young Man's for officers; Old\r\n     Man's for stock jobbers, paymasters and courtiers, and Little Man's\r\n     for sharpers. I never was so confounded in my life as when I\r\n     entered into this last. I saw two or three tables full at faro, and\r\n     was surrounded by a set of sharp faces that I was afraid would have\r\n     devoured me with their eyes. I was glad to drop two or three half\r\n     crowns at faro to get off with a clear skin, and was overjoyed I so\r\n     got rid of them.\r\n\r\n     At two we generally go to dinner; ordinaries are not so common here\r\n     as abroad, yet the French have set up two or three good ones for\r\n     the convenience of foreigners in Suffolk street, where one is\r\n     tolerably well served; but the general way here is to make a party\r\n     at the coffee house to go to dine at the tavern, where we sit till\r\n     six, when we go to the play, except you are invited to the table of\r\n     some great man, which strangers are always courted to and nobly\r\n     entertained.\r\n\r\nMackay writes that \"in all the coffee houses you have not only the\r\nforeign prints but several English ones with foreign occurrences,\r\nbesides papers of morality and party disputes.\"\r\n\r\n\"After the play,\" writes Defoe, \"the best company generally go to Tom's\r\nand Will's coffee houses, near adjoining, where there is playing at\r\npicquet and the best of conversation till midnight. Here you will see\r\nblue and green ribbons and stars sitting familiarly and talking with the\r\nsame freedom as if they had left their equality and degrees of distance\r\nat home.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LION'S HEAD AT BUTTON'S COFFEE HOUSE\r\n\r\nDesigned by Hogarth, and put up by Addison, 1713 From a water color by\r\nT.H. Shepherd]\r\n\r\nBefore entering the coffee house every one was recommended by the\r\n_Tatler_ to prepare his body with three dishes of bohea and to purge his\r\nbrains with two pinches of snuff. Men had their coffee houses as now\r\nthey have their clubs--sometimes contented with one, sometimes belonging\r\nto three or four. Johnson, for instance, was connected with St. James's,\r\nthe Turk's Head, the Bedford, Peele's, besides the taverns which he\r\nfrequented. Addison and Steele used Button's; Swift, Button's, the\r\nSmyrna, and St. James's; Dryden, Will's; Pope, Will's and Button's;\r\nGoldsmith, the St. James's and the Chapter; Fielding, the Bedford;\r\nHogarth, the Bedford and Slaughter's; Sheridan, the Piazza; Thurlow,\r\nNando's.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some Famous Coffee Houses_\r\n\r\nAmong the famous English coffee houses of the seventeenth-eighteenth\r\ncentury period were St. James's, Will's, Garraway's, White's,\r\nSlaughter's, the Grecian, Button's, Lloyd's, Tom's, and Don Saltero's.\r\n\r\nSt. James's was a Whig house frequented by members of Parliament, with a\r\nfair sprinkling of literary stars. Garraway's catered to the gentry of\r\nthe period, many of whom naturally had Tory proclivities.\r\n\r\nOne of the notable coffee houses of Queen Anne's reign was Button's.\r\nHere Addison could be found almost every afternoon and evening, along\r\nwith Steele, Davenant, Carey, Philips, and other kindred minds. Pope was\r\na member of the same coffee house club for a year, but his inborn\r\nirascibility eventually led him to drop out of it.\r\n\r\nAt Button's a lion's head, designed by Hogarth after the Lion of Venice,\r\n\"a proper emblem of knowledge and action, being all head and paws,\" was\r\nset up to receive letters and papers for the _Guardian_.[82] The\r\n_Tatler_ and the _Spectator_ were born in the coffee house, and probably\r\nEnglish prose would never have received the impetus given it by the\r\nessays of Addison and Steele had it not been for coffee house\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\nPope's famous _Rape of the Lock_ grew out of coffee-house gossip. The\r\npoem itself contains one charming passage on coffee.[83]\r\n\r\nAnother frequenter of the coffee houses of London, when he had the money\r\nto do so, was Daniel Defoe, whose _Robinson Crusoe_ was the precursor of\r\nthe English novel. Henry Fielding, one of the greatest of all English\r\nnovelists, loved the life of the more bohemian coffee houses, and was,\r\nin fact, induced to write his first great novel, _Joseph Andrews_,\r\nthrough coffee-house criticisms of Richardson's _Pamela_.\r\n\r\nOther frequenters of the coffee houses of the period were Thomas Gray\r\nand Richard Brinsley Sheridan. Garrick was often to be seen at Tom's in\r\nBirchin Lane, where also Chatterton might have been found on many an\r\nevening before his untimely death.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The London Pleasure Gardens_\r\n\r\nThe second half of the eighteenth century was covered by the reigns of\r\nthe Georges. The coffee houses were still an important factor in London\r\nlife, but were influenced somewhat by the development of gardens in\r\nwhich were served tea, chocolate, and other drinks, as well as coffee.\r\nAt the coffee houses themselves, while coffee remained the favorite\r\nbeverage, the proprietors, in the hope of increasing their patronage,\r\nbegan to serve wine, ale, and other liquors. This seems to have been the\r\nfirst step toward the decay of the coffee house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TRIO OF NOTABLES AT BUTTON'S IN 1730\r\n\r\nThe figure in the cloak is Count Viviani; of the figures facing the\r\nreader, the draughts player is Dr. Arbuthnot, and the figure standing is\r\nassumed to be Pope]\r\n\r\nThe coffee houses, however, continued to be the centers of intellectual\r\nlife. When Samuel Johnson and David Garrick came together to London,\r\nliterature was temporarily in a bad way, and the hack writers of the\r\ntime dwelt in Grub Street.\r\n\r\nIt was not until after Johnson had met with some success, and had\r\nestablished the first of his coffee-house clubs at the Turk's Head, that\r\nliterature again became a fashionable profession.\r\n\r\nThis really famous literary club met at the Turk's Head from 1763 to\r\n1783. Among the most notable members were Johnson, the arbiter of\r\nEnglish prose; Oliver Goldsmith; Boswell, the biographer; Burke, the\r\norator; Garrick, the actor; and Sir Joshua Reynolds, the painter. Among\r\nthe later members were Gibbon, the historian; and Adam Smith, the\r\npolitical economist.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that during the sway of the English coffee house, and at\r\nleast partly through its influence, England produced a better prose\r\nliterature, as embodied alike in her essays, literary criticisms, and\r\nnovels, than she ever had produced before.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the pleasure garden brought coffee out into the open in\r\nEngland; and one of the reasons why gardens, such as Ranelagh and\r\nVauxhall, began to be more frequented than the coffee houses was that\r\nthey were popular resorts for women as well as for men. All kinds of\r\nbeverages were served in them; and soon the women began to favor tea as\r\nan afternoon drink. At least, the great development in the use of tea\r\ndates from this period; and many of these resorts called themselves tea\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\nThe use of coffee by this time, however, was well established in the\r\nhomes as a breakfast and dinner beverage, and such consumption more than\r\nmade up for any loss sustained through the gradual decadence of the\r\ncoffee house. Yet signs of the change in national taste that arrived\r\nwith the Georges were not wanting; for the active propaganda of the\r\nBritish East India Company was fairly well launched during Queen Anne's\r\nreign.\r\n\r\nThe London pleasure gardens of the eighteenth century were unique. At\r\none time there was a \"mighty maze\" of them. Their season extended from\r\nApril or May to August or September. At first there was no charge for\r\nadmission, but Warwick Wroth[84] tells us that visitors usually\r\npurchased cheese cakes, syllabubs, tea, coffee and ale.\r\n\r\nThe four best-known London gardens were Vauxhall; Marylebone; Cuper's,\r\nwhere the charge for admission subsequently was fixed at not less than a\r\nshilling; and Ranelagh, where the charge of half a crown included \"the\r\nElegant Regale\" of tea, coffee, and bread and butter.\r\n\r\nThe pleasure gardens provided walks, rooms for dancing, skittle grounds,\r\nbowling greens, variety entertainments, and promenade concerts; and not\r\na few places were given over to fashionable gambling and racing.\r\n\r\nThe Vauxhall Gardens, one of the most favored resorts of\r\npleasure-seeking Londoners, were located on the Surrey side of the\r\nThames, a short distance east of Vauxhall Bridge. They were originally\r\nknown as the New Spring Gardens (1661), to distinguish them from the old\r\nSpring Gardens at Charing Cross. They became famous in the reign of\r\nCharles II. Vauxhall was celebrated for its walks, lit with thousands of\r\nlamps, its musical and other performances, suppers, and fireworks. High\r\nand low were to be found there, and the drinking of tea and coffee in\r\nthe arbors was a feature. The illustration shows the garden brightly\r\nilluminated by lanterns and lamps on some festival occasion. Coffee and\r\ntea were served in the arbors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VAUXHALL GARDENS ON A GALA NIGHT]\r\n\r\nThe Ranelagh, \"a place of public entertainment,\" erected at Chelsea in\r\n1742, was a kind of Vauxhall under cover. The principal room, known as\r\nthe Rotunda, was circular in shape, 150 feet in diameter, and had an\r\norchestra in the center and tiers of boxes all around. Promenading and\r\ntaking refreshments in the boxes were the principal divertisements.\r\nExcept on gala nights of masquerades and fireworks, only tea, coffee,\r\nbread and butter were to be had at Ranelagh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ROTUNDA IN RANELAGH GARDENS WITH THE COMPANY AT\r\nBREAKFAST--1751]\r\n\r\nIn the group of gardens connected with mineral springs was the Dog and\r\nDuck (St. George's Spa), which became at last a tea garden and a dancing\r\nsaloon of doubtful repute.\r\n\r\nStill another division, recognized by Wroth, consisted mainly of tea\r\ngardens, among them Highbury Barn, The Canonbury House, Hornsey and\r\nCopenhagen House, Bagnigge Wells, and White Conduit House. The two last\r\nnamed were the classic tea gardens of the period. Both were provided\r\nwith \"long rooms\" in case of rain, and for indoor promenades with organ\r\nmusic. Then there were the Adam and Eve tea gardens, with arbors for\r\ntea-drinking parties, which subsequently became the Adam and Eve Tavern\r\nand Coffee House. Well known were the Bayswater Tea Gardens and the Jews\r\nHarp House and Tea Gardens. All these were provided with neat, \"genteel\"\r\nboxes, let into the hedges and alcoves, for tea and coffee drinkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Locating the Notable Coffee Houses_\r\n\r\nGARRAWAY'S, 3 'Change Alley, Cornhill, was a place for great mercantile\r\ntransactions. Thomas Garway, the original proprietor, was a tobacconist\r\nand coffee man, who claimed to be the first that sold tea in England,\r\nalthough not at this address. The later Garraway's was long famous as a\r\nsandwich and drinking room for sherry, pale ale, and punch, in addition\r\nto tea and coffee. It is said that the sandwich-maker was occupied two\r\nhours in cutting and arranging the sandwiches for the day's consumption.\r\nAfter the \"great fire\" of 1666 GARRAWAY'S moved into the same place in\r\nExchange Alley where Elford had been before the fire. Here he claimed to\r\nhave the oldest coffee house in London; but the ground on which BOWMAN'S\r\nhad stood was occupied later by the VIRGINIA and the JAMAICA coffee\r\nhouses. The latter was damaged by the fire of 1748 which consumed\r\nGARRAWAY'S and ELFORD'S (see map of the 1748 fire).\r\n\r\nWILL'S, the predecessor of BUTTON'S, first had the title of the RED COW,\r\nthen of the ROSE. It was kept by William Urwin, and was on the north\r\nside of Russell Street at the corner of Bow Street. \"It was Dryden who\r\nmade Will's coffee house the great resort of the wits of his time.\"\r\n(_Pope_ and _Spence_.) The room in which the poet was accustomed to sit\r\nwas on the first floor; and his place was the place of honor by the\r\nfireside in the winter, and at the corner of the balcony, looking over\r\nthe street, in fine weather; he called the two places his winter and his\r\nsummer seat. This was called the dining-room floor. The company did not\r\nsit in boxes as subsequently, but at various tables which were dispersed\r\nthrough the room. Smoking was permitted in the public room; it was then\r\nso much in vogue that it does not seem to have been considered a\r\nnuisance. Here, as in other similar places of meeting, the visitors\r\ndivided themselves into parties; and we are told by Ward that the young\r\nbeaux and wits, who seldom approached the principal table, thought it a\r\ngreat honor to have a pinch out of Dryden's snuff-box. After Dryden's\r\ndeath WILL'S was transferred to a house opposite, and became BUTTON'S,\r\n\"over against THOMAS'S in Covent Garden.\" Thither also Addison\r\ntransferred much company from THOMAS'S. Here Swift first saw Addison.\r\nHither also came \"Steele, Arbuthnot and many other wits of the time.\"\r\nBUTTON'S continued in vogue until Addison's death and Steele's\r\nretirement into Wales, after which the coffee drinkers went to the\r\nBEDFORD, dinner parties to the SHAKESPEARE. BUTTON'S was subsequently\r\nknown as the CALEDONIEN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GARRAWAY'S COFFEE HOUSE IN 'CHANGE ALLEY\r\n\r\nGarway (or Garraway) claimed to have been first to sell Tea in England]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUTTON'S COFFEE HOUSE, GREAT RUSSELL STREET\r\n\r\nAfterward it became the Caledonien\r\n\r\nFrom a water color by T.H. Shepherd]\r\n\r\nSLAUGHTER'S, famous as the resort of painters and sculptors in the\r\neighteenth century, was situated at the upper end of the west side of\r\nSt. Martin's Lane. Its first landlord was Thomas Slaughter, 1692. A\r\nsecond SLAUGHTER'S (NEW SLAUGHTER'S) was established in the same street\r\nin 1760, when the original SLAUGHTER'S adopted the name of OLD\r\nSLAUGHTER'S. It was torn down in 1843-44. Among the notables who\r\nfrequented it were Hogarth; young Gainsborough; Cipriani; Haydon;\r\nRoubiliac; Hudson, who painted the Dilettanti portraits; M'Ardell, the\r\nmezzotinto-scraper; Luke Sullivan, the engraver; Gardell, the portrait\r\npainter; and Parry, the Welsh harper.\r\n\r\nTOM'S, in Birchin Lane, Cornhill, though in the main a mercantile\r\nresort, acquired some celebrity from having been frequented by Garrick.\r\nTOM'S was also frequented by Chatterton, as a place \"of the best\r\nresort.\" Then there was TOM'S in Devereux Court, Strand, and TOM'S at 17\r\nGreat Russell Street, Covent Garden, opposite BUTTON'S, a celebrated\r\nresort during the reign of Queen Anne and for more than a century after.\r\n\r\nTHE GRECIAN, Devereux Court, Strand, was originally kept by one\r\nConstantine, a Greek. From this house Steele proposed to date his\r\nlearned articles in the _Tatler_; it is mentioned in No. 1 of the\r\n_Spectator_, and it was much frequented by Goldsmith. The GRECIAN was\r\nFoote's morning lounge. In 1843 the premises became the Grecian\r\nChambers, with a bust of Lord Devereux, earl of Essex, over the door.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLAUGHTER'S COFFEE HOUSE, ST. MARTIN'S LANE\r\n\r\nIt was taken down in 1843\r\n\r\nFrom a water color by T.H. Shepherd, 1841]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOM'S COFFEE HOUSE, 17 GREAT RUSSELL STREET\r\n\r\nUsed as a coffee house until 1804 and razed in 1865\r\n\r\nFrom a water color by T.H. Shepherd]\r\n\r\nLLOYD'S, Royal Exchange, celebrated for its priority of shipping\r\nintelligence and its marine insurance, originated with Edward Lloyd, who\r\nabout 1688 kept a coffee house in Tower Street, later in Lombard Street\r\ncorner of Abchurch Lane. It was a modest place of refreshment for\r\nseafarers and merchants. As a matter of convenience, Edward Lloyd\r\nprepared \"ships' lists\" for the guidance of the frequenters of the\r\ncoffee house. \"These lists, which were written by hand, contained,\"\r\naccording to Andrew Scott, \"an account of vessels which the underwriters\r\nwho met there were likely to have offered them for insurance.\" Such was\r\nthe beginning of two institutions that have since exercised a dominant\r\ninfluence on the sea-carrying trade of the whole world--the Royal\r\nExchange Lloyd's, the greatest insurance institution in the world, and\r\nLloyd's Register of Shipping. Lloyd's now has 1400 agents in all parts\r\nof the world. It receives as many as 100,000 telegrams a year. It\r\nrecords through its intelligence service the daily movements of 11,000\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning one of the apartments in the Exchange was fitted up as\r\nLLOYD'S coffee room. Edward Lloyd died in 1712. Subsequently the coffee\r\nhouse was in Pope's Head Alley, where it was called NEW LLOYD'S coffee\r\nhouse, but on September 14, 1784, it was removed to the northwest corner\r\nof the Royal Exchange, where it remained until the partial destruction\r\nof that building by fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LLOYD'S COFFEE HOUSE IN THE ROYAL EXCHANGE, SHOWING THE\r\nSUBSCRIPTION ROOM]\r\n\r\nIn rebuilding the Exchange there were provided the Subscribers' or\r\nUnderwriters' room, the Merchants' room, and the Captains' room. _The\r\nCity_, second edition, 1848, contains the following description of this\r\nmost famous rendezvous of eminent merchants, shipowners, underwriters,\r\ninsurance, stock and exchange brokers:\r\n\r\n     Here is obtained the earliest news of the arrival and sailing of\r\n     vessels, losses at sea, captures, recaptures, engagements and other\r\n     shipping intelligence; and proprietors of ships and freights are\r\n     insured by the underwriters. The rooms are in the Venetian style\r\n     with Roman enrichments. At the entrance of the room are exhibited\r\n     the Shipping Lists, received from Lloyd's agents at home and\r\n     abroad, and affording particulars of departures or arrivals of\r\n     vessels, wrecks, salvage, or sale of property saved, etc. To the\r\n     right and left are \"Lloyd's Books,\" two enormous ledgers. Right\r\n     hand, ships \"spoken with\" or arrived at their destined ports; left\r\n     hand, records of wrecks, fires or severe collisions, written in a\r\n     fine Roman hand in \"double lines.\" To assist the underwriters in\r\n     their calculations, at the end of the room is an Anemometer, which\r\n     registers the state of the wind day and night; attached is a rain\r\n     gauge.\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH, Cockspur Street, \"long a house of call for Scotchmen,\" was\r\nfortunate in its landladies. In 1759 it was kept by the sister of Bishop\r\nDouglas, so well known for his works against Lauder and Bower, which may\r\nexplain its Scottish fame. At another period it was kept by Mrs.\r\nAnderson, described in Mackenzie's _Life of Home_ as \"a woman of\r\nuncommon talents and the most agreeable conversation.\"\r\n\r\nDON SALTERO'S, 18 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, was opened by a barber named\r\nSalter in 1695. Sir Hans Sloane contributed of his own collection some\r\nof the refuse gimcracks that were to be found in Salter's \"museum.\"\r\nVice-Admiral Munden, who had been long on the coast of Spain, where he\r\nhad acquired a fondness for Spanish titles, named the keeper of the\r\nhouse Don Saltero, and his coffee house and museum DON SALTERO'S.\r\n\r\nSQUIRE'S was in Fulwood's Rents, Holburn, running up to Gray's Inn. It\r\nwas one of the receiving houses of the _Spectator_. In No. 269 the\r\n_Spectator_ accepts Sir Roger de Coverley's invitation to \"smoke a pipe\r\nwith him over a dish of coffee at Squire's. As I love the old man, I\r\ntake delight in complying with everything that is agreeable to him, and\r\naccordingly waited on him to the coffee-house, where his venerable\r\nfigure drew upon us the eyes of the whole room. He had no sooner seated\r\nhimself at the upper end of the high table, but he called for a clean\r\npipe, a paper of tobacco, a dish of coffee, a wax candle and the\r\n'Supplement' (a periodical paper of that time), with such an air of\r\ncheerfulness and good humour, that all the boys in the coffee room (who\r\nseemed to take pleasure in serving him) were at once employed on his\r\nseveral errands, insomuch that nobody else could come at a dish of tea\r\nuntil the Knight had got all his conveniences about him.\" Such was the\r\ncoffee room in the _Spectator's_ day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF DICK'S COFFEE HOUSE\r\n\r\nFrom the frontispiece to \"The Coffee House--a dramatick Piece\" (see\r\nchapter XXXII)]\r\n\r\nTHE COCOA-TREE was originally a coffee house on the south side of Pall\r\nMall. When there grew up a need for \"places of resort of a more elegant\r\nand refined character,\" chocolate houses came into vogue, and the\r\nCOCOA-TREE was the most famous of these.

From a drawing dated 1809]\r\n\r\nWHITE'S chocolate house, established by Francis White about 1693 in St.\r\nJames's Street, originally open to any one as a coffee house, soon\r\nbecame a private club, composed of \"the most fashionable exquisites of\r\nthe town and court.\" In its coffee-house days, the entrance was\r\nsixpence, as compared with the average penny fee of the other coffee\r\nhouses. Escott refers to WHITE'S as being \"the one specimen of the class\r\nto which it belongs, of a place at which, beneath almost the same roof,\r\nand always bearing the same name, whether as coffee house or club, the\r\nsame class of persons has congregated during more than two hundred\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\nAmong hundreds of other coffee houses that flourished during the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries the following more notable ones are\r\ndeserving of mention:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DON SALTERO'S COFFEE HOUSE, CHEYNE WALK\r\n\r\nFrom a steel engraving in the British Museum]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BRITISH COFFEE HOUSE\r\n\r\nIN COCKSPUR STREET\r\n\r\nFrom a print published in 1770]\r\n\r\nBAKER'S, 58 'Change Alley, for nearly half a century noted for its chops\r\nand steaks broiled in the coffee room and eaten hot from the gridiron;\r\nthe BALTIC, in Threadneedle Street, the rendezvous of brokers and\r\nmerchants connected with the Russian trade; the BEDFORD, \"under the\r\nPiazza, in Covent Garden,\" crowded every night with men of parts and\r\n\"signalized for many years as the emporium of wit, the seat of criticism\r\nand the standard of taste\"; the CHAPTER, in Paternoster Row, frequented\r\nby Chatterton and Goldsmith; CHILD'S, in St. Paul's Churchyard, one of\r\nthe _Spectator's_ houses, and much frequented by the clergy and fellows\r\nof the Royal Society; DICK'S, in Fleet Street, frequented by Cowper, and\r\nthe scene of Rousseau's comedietta, entitled _The Coffee House_; ST.\r\nJAMES'S, in St. James's Street, frequented by Swift, Goldsmith, and\r\nGarrick; JERUSALEM, in Cowper's Court, Cornhill, frequented by merchants\r\nand captains connected with the commerce of China, India, and Australia;\r\nJONATHAN'S, in 'Change Alley, described by the _Tatler_ as \"the general\r\nmart of stock jobbers\"; the LONDON, in Ludgate Hill, noted for its\r\npublishers' sales of stock and copyrights; MAN'S, in Scotland Yard,\r\nwhich took its name from the proprietor, Alexander Man, and was\r\nsometimes known as OLD MAN'S, or the ROYAL, to distinguish it from YOUNG\r\nMAN'S, LITTLE MAN'S, NEW MAN'S, etc., minor establishments in the\r\nneighborhood;[85] NANDO'S, in Fleet Street, the favorite haunt of Lord\r\nThurlow and many professional loungers, attracted by the fame of the\r\npunch and the charms of the landlady; NEW ENGLAND AND NORTH AND SOUTH\r\nAMERICAN, in Threadneedle Street, having on its subscription list\r\nrepresentatives of Barings, Rothschilds, and other wealthy\r\nestablishments; PEELE'S, in Fleet Street, having a portrait of Dr.\r\nJohnson said to have been painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds; the PERCY, in\r\nOxford Street, the inspiration for the _Percy Anecdotes_; the PIAZZA, in\r\nCovent Garden, where Macklin fitted up a large coffee room, or theater,\r\nfor oratory, and Fielding and Foote poked fun at him; the RAINBOW, in\r\nFleet Street, the second coffee house opened in London, having its token\r\nmoney; the SMYRNA, in Pall Mall, a \"place to talk politics,\" and\r\nfrequented by Prior and Swift; TOM KING'S, one of the old night houses\r\nof Covent Garden Market, \"well known to all gentlemen to whom beds are\r\nunknown\"; the TURK'S HEAD, 'Change Alley, which also had its tokens; the\r\nTURK'S HEAD, in the Strand, which was a favorite supping house for Dr.\r\nJohnson and Boswell; the FOLLY, a coffee house on a house-boat on the\r\nThames, which became quite notorious during Queen Anne's reign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FRENCH COFFEE HOUSE IN LONDON, SECOND HALF OF THE\r\nEIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\nFrom the original water-color drawing by Thomas Rowlandson]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAMPONAUX' ROYAL DRUMMER, ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR OF THE\r\nEARLY PARISIAN CAFÉS\r\n\r\nStarted originally as a tavern, this hostelry added coffee to its\r\ncuisine and became famous in the reign of Louis XV The illustration is\r\nfrom an early print used to advertise the \"Royal Drummer's\" attractions]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE EARLY PARISIAN COFFEE HOUSES\r\n\r\n     _The introduction of coffee into Paris by Thévenot in 1657--How\r\n     Soliman Aga established the custom of coffee drinking at the court\r\n     of Louis XIV--Opening the first coffee houses--How the French\r\n     adaptation of the Oriental coffee house first appeared in the real\r\n     French café of François Procope--The important part played by the\r\n     coffee houses in the development of French literature and the\r\n     stage--Their association with the Revolution and the founding of\r\n     the Republic--Quaint customs and patrons--Historic Parisian cafés_\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we are to accept the authority of Jean La Roque, \"before the year\r\n1669 coffee had scarcely been seen in Paris, except at M. Thévenot's and\r\nat the homes of some of his friends. Nor had it been heard of except in\r\nthe writings of travelers.\"\r\n\r\nAs noted in chapter V, Jean de Thévenot brought coffee into Paris in\r\n1657. One account says that a decoction, supposed to have been coffee,\r\nwas sold by a Levantine in the Petit Châtelet under the name of _cohove_\r\nor _cahoue_ during the reign of Louis XIII, but this lacks confirmation.\r\nLouis XIV is said to have been served with coffee for the first time in\r\n1664.\r\n\r\nSoon after the arrival, in July, 1669, of the Turkish ambassador,\r\nSoliman Aga, it became noised abroad that he had brought with him for\r\nhis own use, and that of his retinue, great quantities of coffee. He\r\n\"treated several persons with it, both in the court and the city.\" At\r\nlength \"many accustomed themselves to it with sugar, and others who\r\nfound benefit by it could not leave it off.\"\r\n\r\nWithin six months all Paris was talking of the sumptuous coffee\r\nfunctions of the ambassador from Mohammed IV to the court of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nIsaac D'Israeli best describes them in his _Curiosities of Literature_:\r\n\r\n     On bended knee, the black slaves of the Ambassador, arrayed in the\r\n     most gorgeous Oriental costumes, served the choicest Mocha coffee\r\n     in tiny cups of egg-shell porcelain, hot, strong and fragrant,\r\n     poured out in saucers of gold and silver, placed on embroidered\r\n     silk doylies fringed with gold bullion, to the grand dames, who\r\n     fluttered their fans with many grimaces, bending their piquant\r\n     faces--be-rouged, be-powdered and be-patched--over the new and\r\n     steaming beverage.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1669 or 1672 that Madame de Sévigné (Marie de Rabutin-Chantal;\r\n1626-96), the celebrated French letter-writer, is said to have made that\r\nfamous prophecy, \"There are two things Frenchmen will never\r\nswallow--coffee and Racine's poetry,\" sometimes abbreviated into,\r\n\"Racine and coffee will pass.\" What Madame really said, according to one\r\nauthority, was that Racine was writing for Champmeslé, the actress, and\r\nnot for posterity; again, of coffee she said, \"_s'en dégoûterait comme;\r\nd'un indigne favori_\" (People will become disgusted with it as with an\r\nunworthy favorite).\r\n\r\nLarousse says the double judgment was wrongly attributed to Mme. de\r\nSévigné. The celebrated aphorism, like many others, was forged later.\r\nMme. de Sévigné said, \"Racine made his comedies for the Champmeslé--not\r\nfor the ages to come.\" This was in 1672. Four years later, she said to\r\nher daughter, \"You have done well to quit coffee. Mlle. de Mere has also\r\ngiven it up.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE WAS FIRST SOLD AND SERVED PUBLICLY IN THE FAIR OF\r\nST.-GERMAIN\r\n\r\nFrom a Seventeenth-Century Print]\r\n\r\nHowever it may have been, the amiable letter-writer was destined to live\r\nto see Frenchmen yielding at once to the lure of coffee and to the\r\npoetical artifices of the greatest dramatic craftsman of his day.\r\n\r\nWhile it is recorded that coffee made slow progress with the court of\r\nLouis XIV, the next king, Louis XV, to please his mistress, du Barry,\r\ngave it a tremendous vogue. It is related that he spent $15,000 a year\r\nfor coffee for his daughters.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in 1672, one Pascal, an Armenian, first sold coffee publicly\r\nin Paris. Pascal, who, according to one account, was brought to Paris by\r\nSoliman Aga, offered the beverage for sale from a tent, which was also a\r\nkind of booth, in the fair of St.-Germain, supplemented by the service\r\nof Turkish waiter boys, who peddled it among the crowds from small cups\r\non trays. The fair was held during the first two months of spring, in a\r\nlarge open plot just inside the walls of Paris and near the Latin\r\nQuarter. As Pascal's waiter boys circulated through the crowds on those\r\nchilly days the fragrant odor of freshly made coffee brought many ready\r\nsales of the steaming beverage; and soon visitors to the fair learned to\r\nlook for the \"little black\" cupful of cheer, or _petit noir_, a name\r\nthat still endures.\r\n\r\nWhen the fair closed, Pascal opened a small coffee shop on the Quai de\r\nl'École, near the Pont Neuf; but his frequenters were of a type who\r\npreferred the beers and wines of the day, and coffee languished. Pascal\r\ncontinued, however, to send his waiter boys with their large coffee\r\njugs, that were heated by lamps, through the streets of Paris and from\r\ndoor to door. Their cheery cry of \"_café! café!_\" became a welcome call\r\nto many a Parisian, who later missed his _petit noir_ when Pascal gave\r\nup and moved on to London, where coffee drinking was then in high favor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STREET COFFEE VENDER OF PARIS--PERIOD, 1672 TO 1689--TWO\r\nSOUS PER DISH, SUGAR INCLUDED]\r\n\r\nLacking favor at court, coffee's progress was slow. The French smart set\r\nclung to its light wines and beers. In 1672, Maliban, another Armenian,\r\nopened a coffee house in the rue Bussy, next to the Metz tennis court\r\nnear St.-Germain's abbey. He supplied tobacco also to his customers.\r\nLater he went to Holland, leaving his servant and partner, Gregory, a\r\nPersian, in charge. Gregory moved to the rue Mazarine, to be near the\r\nComédie Française. He was succeeded in the business by Makara, another\r\nPersian, who later returned to Ispahan, leaving the coffee house to one\r\nLe Gantois, of Liége.\r\n\r\nAbout this period there was a cripple boy from Candia, known as le\r\nCandiot, who began to cry \"coffee!\" in the streets of Paris. He carried\r\nwith him a coffee pot of generous size, a chafing-dish, cups, and all\r\nother implements necessary to his trade. He sold his coffee from door to\r\ndoor at two sous per dish, sugar included.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANY OF THE EARLY PARISIAN COFFEE HOUSES FOLLOWED\r\nPASCAL'S LEAD AND AFFECTED ARMENIAN DECORATIONS\r\n\r\nFrom a Seventeenth-Century Print]\r\n\r\nA Levantine named Joseph also sold coffee in the streets, and later had\r\nseveral coffee shops of his own. Stephen, from Aleppo, next opened a\r\ncoffee house on Pont au Change, moving, when his business prospered, to\r\nmore pretentious quarters in the rue St.-André, facing St.-Michael's\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CORNER OF THE HISTORIC CAFÉ DE PROCOPE SHOWING VOLTAIRE\r\nAND DIDEROT IN DEBATE\r\n\r\nFrom a rare water color]\r\n\r\nAll these, and others, were essentially the Oriental style of coffee\r\nhouse of the lower order, and they appealed principally to the poorer\r\nclasses and to foreigners. \"Gentlemen and people of fashion\" did not\r\ncare to be seen in this type of public house. But when the French\r\nmerchants began to set up, first at St.-Germain's fair, \"spacious\r\napartments in an elegant manner, ornamented with tapestries, large\r\nmirrors, pictures, marble tables, branches for candles, magnificent\r\nlustres, and serving coffee, tea, chocolate, and other refreshments\",\r\nthey were soon crowded with people of fashion and men of letters.\r\n\r\nIn this way coffee drinking in public acquired a badge of\r\nrespectability. Presently there were some three hundred coffee houses in\r\nParis. The principal coffee men, in addition to plying their trade in\r\nthe city, maintained coffee rooms in St.-Germain's and St.-Laurence's\r\nfairs. These were frequented by women as well as men.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Progenitor of the Real Parisian Café_\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1689, that there appeared in Paris a real French\r\nadaptation of the Oriental coffee house. This was the Café de Procope,\r\nopened by François Procope (Procopio Cultelli, or Cotelli) who came from\r\nFlorence or Palermo. Procope was a _limonadier_ (lemonade vender) who\r\nhad a royal license to sell spices, ices, barley water, lemonade, and\r\nother such refreshments. He early added coffee to the list, and\r\nattracted a large and distinguished patronage.\r\n\r\nProcope, a keen-witted merchant, made his appeal to a higher class of\r\npatrons than did Pascal and those who first followed him. He established\r\nhis café directly opposite the newly opened Comédie Française, in the\r\nstreet then known as the rue des Fossés-St.-Germain, but now the rue de\r\nl'Ancienne Comédie. A writer of the period has left this description of\r\nthe place: \"The Café de Procope ... was also called the Antre [cavern]\r\nde Procope, because it was very dark even in full day, and ill-lighted\r\nin the evenings; and because you often saw there a set of lank, sallow\r\npoets, who had somewhat the air of apparitions.\"\r\n\r\nBecause of its location, the Café de Procope became the gathering place\r\nof many noted French actors, authors, dramatists, and musicians of the\r\neighteenth century. It was a veritable literary salon. Voltaire was a\r\nconstant patron; and until the close of the historic café, after an\r\nexistence of more than two centuries, his marble table and chair were\r\namong the precious relics of the coffee house. His favorite drink is\r\nsaid to have been a mixture of coffee and chocolate. Rousseau, author\r\nand philosopher; Beaumarchais, dramatist and financier; Diderot, the\r\nencyclopedist; Ste.-Foix, the abbé of Voisenon; de Belloy, author of the\r\n_Siege of Callais_; Lemierre, author of _Artaxerce_; Crébillon; Piron;\r\nLa Chaussée; Fontenelle; Condorcet; and a host of lesser lights in the\r\nFrench arts, were habitués of François Procope's modest coffee saloon\r\nnear the Comédie Française.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the name of Benjamin Franklin, recognized in Europe as one of\r\nthe world's foremost thinkers in the days of the American Revolution,\r\nwas often spoken over the coffee cups of Café de Procope; and when the\r\ndistinguished American died in 1790, this French coffee house went into\r\ndeep mourning \"for the great friend of republicanism.\" The walls, inside\r\nand out, were swathed in black bunting, and the statesmanship and\r\nscientific attainments of Franklin were acclaimed by all frequenters.\r\n\r\nThe Café de Procope looms large in the annals of the French Revolution.\r\nDuring the turbulent days of 1789 one could find at the tables, drinking\r\ncoffee or stronger beverages, and engaged in debate over the burning\r\nquestions of the hour, such characters as Marat, Robespierre, Danton,\r\nHébert, and Desmoulins. Napoleon Bonaparte, then a poor artillery\r\nofficer seeking a commission, was also there. He busied himself largely\r\nin playing chess, a favorite recreation of the early Parisian\r\ncoffee-house patrons. It is related that François Procope once compelled\r\nyoung Bonaparte to leave his hat for security while he sought money to\r\npay his coffee score.\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolution, the Café de Procope lost its literary prestige and\r\nsank to the level of an ordinary restaurant. During the last half of the\r\nnineteenth century, Paul Verlaine, bohemian, poet, and leader of the\r\nsymbolists, made the Café de Procope his haunt; and for a time it\r\nregained some of its lost popularity. The Restaurant Procope still\r\nsurvives at 13 rue de l'Ancienne Comédie.\r\n\r\nHistory records that, with the opening of the Café de Procope, coffee\r\nbecame firmly established in Paris. In the reign of Louis XV there were\r\n600 cafés in Paris. At the close of the eighteenth century there were\r\nmore than 800. By 1843 the number had increased to more than 3000.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Development of the Cafés_\r\n\r\nCoffee's vogue spread rapidly, and many cabaréts and famous eating\r\nhouses began to add it to their menus. Among these was the Tour d'Argent\r\n(silver tower), which had been opened on the Quai de la Tournelle in\r\n1582, and speedily became Paris's most fashionable restaurant. It still\r\nis one of the chief attractions for the epicure, retaining the\r\nreputation for its cooking that drew a host of world leaders, from\r\nNapoleon to Edward VII, to its quaint interior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAFÉ DE PROCOPE IN 1743\r\n\r\nFrom an engraving by Bosredon]\r\n\r\nAnother tavern that took up coffee after Procope, was the Royal\r\nDrummer, which Jean Ramponaux established at the Courtille des\r\nPorcherons and which followed Magny's. His hostelry rightly belongs to\r\nthe tavern class, although coffee had a prominent place on its menu. It\r\nbecame notorious for excesses and low-class vices during the reign of\r\nLouis XV, who was a frequent visitor. Low and high were to be found in\r\nRamponaux's cellar, particularly when some especially wild revelry was\r\nin prospect. Marie Antoinette once declared she had her most enjoyable\r\ntime at a wild _farandole_ in the Royal Drummer. Ramponaux was taken to\r\nits heart by fashionable Paris; and his name was used as a trade mark on\r\nfurniture, clothes, and foods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CASHIER'S COUNTER IN A PARIS COFFEE HOUSE OF 1782\r\n\r\nFrom a drawing by Rétif de la Bretonne]\r\n\r\nThe popularity of Ramponaux's Royal Drummer is attested by an\r\ninscription on an early print showing the interior of the café.\r\nTranslated, it reads:\r\n\r\nThe pleasures of ease untroubled to taste,\r\n    The leisure of home to enjoy without haste,\r\nPerhaps a few hours at Magny's to waste,\r\n    Ah, that was the old-fashioned way!\r\nToday all our laborers, everyone knows,\r\n    Go running away ere the working hours close,\r\nAnd why? They must be at Monsieur Ramponaux'!\r\n    Behold, the new style of café!\r\n\r\nWhen coffee houses began to crop up rapidly in Paris, the majority\r\ncentered in the Palais Royal, \"that garden spot of beauty, enclosed on\r\nthree sides by three tiers of galleries,\" which Richelieu had erected in\r\n1636, under the name of Palais Cardinal, in the reign of Louis XIII. It\r\nbecame known as the Palais Royal in 1643; and soon after the opening of\r\nthe Café de Procope, it began to blossom out with many attractive coffee\r\nstalls, or rooms, sprinkled among the other shops that occupied the\r\ngalleries overlooking the gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Life In The Early Coffee Houses_\r\n\r\nDiderot tells in 1760, in his _Rameau's Nephew_, of the life and\r\nfrequenters of one of the Palais Royal coffee houses, the Regency (_Café\r\nde la Régence_):\r\n\r\n     In all weathers, wet or fine, it is my practice to go toward five\r\n     o'clock in the evening to take a turn in the Palais Royal.... If\r\n     the weather is too cold or too wet I take shelter in the Regency\r\n     coffee house. There I amuse myself by looking on while they play\r\n     chess. Nowhere in the world do they play chess as skillfully as in\r\n     Paris and nowhere in Paris as they do at this coffee house; 'tis\r\n     here you see Légal the profound, Philidor the subtle, Mayot the\r\n     solid; here you see the most astounding moves, and listen to the\r\n     sorriest talk, for if a man be at once a wit and a great chess\r\n     player, like Légal, he may also be a great chess player and a sad\r\n     simpleton, like Joubert and Mayot.\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of the Regency coffee house are associated with the\r\nlegend that Lefévre, a Parisian, began peddling coffee in the streets of\r\nParis about the time Procope opened his café in 1689. The story has it\r\nthat Lefévre later opened a café near the Palais Royal, selling it in\r\n1718 to one Leclerc, who named it the Café de la Régence, in honor of\r\nthe regent of Orleans, a name that still endures on a broad sign over\r\nits doors. The nobility had their rendezvous there after having paid\r\ntheir court to the regent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAFÉ FOY IN THE PALAIS ROYAL, 1789\r\n\r\nFrom an engraving by Bosredon]\r\n\r\nTo name the patrons of the Café de la Régence in its long career would\r\nbe to outline a history of French literature for more than two\r\ncenturies. There was Philidor the \"greatest theoretician of the\r\neighteenth century, better known for his chess than his music\";\r\nRobespierre, of the Revolution, who once played chess with a\r\ngirl--disguised as a boy--for the life of her lover; Napoleon, who was\r\nthen noted more for his chess than his empire-building propensities; and\r\nGambetta, whose loud voice, generally raised in debate, disturbed one\r\nchess player so much that he protested because he could not follow his\r\ngame. Voltaire, Alfred de Musset; Victor Hugo, Théophile Gautier, J.J.\r\nRousseau, the Duke of Richelieu, Marshall Saxe, Buffon, Rivarol,\r\nFontenelle, Franklin, and Henry Murger are names still associated with\r\nmemories of this historic café: Marmontel and Philidor played there at\r\ntheir favorite game of chess. Diderot tells in his _Memoirs_ that his\r\nwife gave him every day nine sous to get his coffee there. It was in\r\nthis establishment that he worked on his _Encyclopedia_.\r\n\r\nChess is today still in favor at the Régence, although the players are\r\nnot, as were the earlier patrons, obliged to pay by the hour for their\r\ntables with extra charges for candles placed by the chess-boards. The\r\npresent Café de la Régence is in the rue St.-Honoré, but retains in\r\nlarge measure its aspect of olden days.\r\n\r\nMichelet, the historian, has given us a rhapsodic pen picture of the\r\nParisian cafés under the regency:\r\n\r\n     Paris became one vast café. Conversation in France was at its\r\n     zenith. There were less eloquence and rhetoric than in '89. With\r\n     the exception of Rousseau, there was no orator to cite. The\r\n     intangible flow of wit was as spontaneous as possible. For this\r\n     sparkling outburst there is no doubt that honor should be ascribed\r\n     in part to the auspicious revolution of the times, to the great\r\n     event which created new customs, and even modified human\r\n     temperament--the advent of coffee.\r\n\r\n     Its effect was immeasurable, not being weakened and neutralized as\r\n     it is today by the brutalizing influence of tobacco. They took\r\n     snuff, but did not smoke. The cabarét was dethroned, the ignoble\r\n     cabarét, where, during the reign of Louis XIV, the youth of the\r\n     city rioted amid wine-casks in the company of light women. The\r\n     night was less thronged with chariots. Fewer lords found a resting\r\n     place in the gutter. The elegant shop, where conversation flowed, a\r\n     salon rather than a shop, changed and ennobled its customs. The\r\n     reign of coffee is that of temperance. Coffee, the beverage of\r\n     sobriety, a powerful mental stimulant, which, unlike spirituous\r\n     liquors, increases clearness and lucidity; coffee, which suppresses\r\n     the vague, heavy fantasies of the imagination, which from the\r\n     perception of reality brings forth the sparkle and sunlight of\r\n     truth; coffee anti-erotic....\r\n\r\n     The three ages of coffee are those of modern thought; they mark the\r\n     serious moments of the brilliant epoch of the soul.\r\n\r\n     Arabian coffee is the pioneer, even before 1700. The beautiful\r\n     ladies that you see in the fashionable rooms of Bonnard, sipping\r\n     from their tiny cups--they are enjoying the aroma of the finest\r\n     coffee of Arabia. And of what are they chatting? Of the seraglio,\r\n     of Chardin, of the Sultana's coiffure, of the _Thousand and One\r\n     Nights_ (1704). They compare the ennui of Versailles with the\r\n     paradise of the Orient.\r\n\r\n     Very soon, in 1710-1720, commences the reign of Indian coffee,\r\n     abundant, popular, comparatively cheap. Bourbon, our Indian island,\r\n     where coffee was transplanted, suddenly realizes unheard-of\r\n     happiness. This coffee of volcanic lands acts as an explosive on\r\n     the Regency and the new spirit of things. This sudden cheer, this\r\n     laughter of the old world, these overwhelming flashes of wit, of\r\n     which the sparkling verse of Voltaire, the _Persian Letters_, give\r\n     us a faint idea! Even the most brilliant books have not succeeded\r\n     in catching on the wing this airy chatter, which comes, goes, flies\r\n     elusively. This is that spirit of ethereal nature which, in the\r\n     _Thousand and One Nights_, the enchanter confined in his bottle.\r\n     But what phial would have withstood that pressure?\r\n\r\n     The lava of Bourbon, like the Arabian sand, was unequal to the\r\n     demand. The Regent recognized this and had coffee transported to\r\n     the fertile soil of our Antilles. The strong coffee of Santo\r\n     Domingo, full, coarse, nourishing as well as stimulating, sustained\r\n     the adult population of that period, the strong age of the\r\n     encyclopedia. It was drunk by Buffon, Diderot, Rousseau, added its\r\n     glow to glowing souls, its light to the penetrating vision of the\r\n     prophets gathered in the cave of Procope, who saw at the bottom of\r\n     the black beverage the future rays of '89. Danton, the terrible\r\n     Danton, took several cups of coffee before mounting the tribune.\r\n     'The horse must have its oats,' he said.\r\n\r\nThe vogue of coffee popularized the use of sugar, which was then bought\r\nby the ounce at the apothecary's shop. Dufour says that in Paris they\r\nused to put so much sugar in the coffee that \"it was nothing but a syrup\r\nof blackened water.\" The ladies were wont to have their carriages stop\r\nin front of the Paris cafés and to have their coffee served to them by\r\nthe porter on saucers of silver.\r\n\r\nEvery year saw new cafés opened. When they became so numerous, and\r\ncompetition grew so keen, it was necessary to invent new attractions for\r\ncustomers. Then was born the _café chantant_, where songs, monologues,\r\ndances, little plays and farces (not always in the best taste), were\r\nprovided to amuse the frequenters. Many of these _cafés chantants_ were\r\nin the open air along the Champs-Elysées. In bad weather, Paris provided\r\nthe pleasure-seeker with the Eldorado, Alcazar d'Hiver, Scala, Gaieté,\r\nConcert du XIXme Siécle, Folies Bobino, Rambuteau, Concert Européen,\r\nand countless other meeting places where one could be served with a cup\r\nof coffee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAFÉ DES MILLE COLONNES IN 1811\r\n\r\nFrom an engraving by Bosredon]\r\n\r\nAs in London, certain cafés were noted for particular followings, like\r\nthe military, students, artists, merchants. The politicians had their\r\nfavorite resorts. Says Salvandy:[86]\r\n\r\n     These were senates in miniature; here mighty political questions\r\n     were discussed; here peace and war were decided upon; here generals\r\n     were brought to the bar of justice ... distinguished orators were\r\n     victoriously refuted, ministers heckled upon their ignorance, their\r\n     incapacity, their perfidy, their corruption. The café is in reality\r\n     a French institution; in them we find all these agitations and\r\n     movements of men, the like of which is unknown in the English\r\n     tavern. No government can go against the sentiment of the cafés.\r\n     The Revolution took place because they were for the Revolution.\r\n     Napoleon reigned because they were for glory. The Restoration was\r\n     shattered, because they understood the Charter in a different\r\n     manner.\r\n\r\nIn 1700 appeared the _Portefeuille Galant_, containing conversations of\r\nthe cafés.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cafés in the French Revolution_\r\n\r\nThe Palais Royal coffee houses were centers of activity in the days\r\npreceding and following the Revolution. A picture of them in the July\r\ndays of 1789 has been left by Arthur Young, who was visiting Paris at\r\nthat time:\r\n\r\n     The coffee houses present yet more singular and astounding\r\n     spectacles; they are not only crowded within, but other expectant\r\n     crowds are at the doors and windows, listening _à gorge déployée_\r\n     to certain orators who from chairs or tables harangue each his\r\n     little audience; the eagerness with which they are heard, and the\r\n     thunder of applause they receive for every sentiment of more than\r\n     common hardiness or violence against the government, cannot easily\r\n     be imagined.\r\n\r\nThe Palais Royal teemed with excited Frenchmen on the fateful Sunday of\r\nJuly 12, 1789. The moment was a tense one, when, coming out of the Café\r\nFoy, Camille Desmoulins, a youthful journalist, mounted a table and\r\nbegan the harangue that precipitated the first overt act of the French\r\nRevolution. Blazing with a white hot frenzy, he so played upon the\r\npassions of the mob that at the conclusion of his speech he and his\r\nfollowers \"marched away from the Café on their errand of Revolution.\"\r\nThe Bastille fell two days later.\r\n\r\nAs if abashed by its reputation as the starting point of the mob spirit\r\nof the Revolution, Café Foy became in after years a sedate\r\ngathering-place of artists and literati. Up to its close it was\r\ndistinguished among other famous Parisian cafés for its exclusiveness\r\nand strictly enforced rule of \"no smoking.\"\r\n\r\nEven from the first the Parisian cafés catered to all classes of\r\nsociety; and, unlike the London coffee houses, they retained this\r\ndistinctive characteristic. A number of them early added other liquid\r\nand substantial refreshments, many becoming out-and-out restaurants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee-House Customs and Patrons_\r\n\r\nCoffee's effect on Parisians is thus described by a writer of the latter\r\npart of the eighteenth century:\r\n\r\n     I think I may safely assert that it is to the establishment of so\r\n     many cafés in Paris that is due the urbanity and mildness\r\n     discernible upon most faces. Before they existed, nearly everybody\r\n     passed his time at the cabarét, where even business matters were\r\n     discussed. Since their establishment, people assemble to hear what\r\n     is going on, drinking and playing only in moderation, and the\r\n     consequence is that they are more civil and polite, at least in\r\n     appearance.\r\n\r\nMontesquieu's satirical pen pictured in his _Persian Letters_ the\r\nearliest cafés as follows:\r\n\r\n     In some of these houses they talk news; in others, they play\r\n     draughts. There is one where they prepare the coffee in such a\r\n     manner that it inspires the drinkers of it with wit; at least, of\r\n     all those who frequent it, there is not one person in four who does\r\n     not think he has more wit after he has entered that house. But what\r\n     offends me in these wits is that they do not make themselves useful\r\n     to their country.\r\n\r\nMontesquieu encountered a geometrician outside a coffee house on the\r\nPont Neuf, and accompanied him inside. He describes the incident in this\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\n     I observe that our geometrician was received there with the utmost\r\n     officiousness, and that the coffee house boys paid him much more\r\n     respect than two musqueteers who were in a corner of the room. As\r\n     for him, he seemed as if he thought himself in an agreeable place;\r\n     for he unwrinkled his brows a little and laughed, as if he had not\r\n     the least tincture of geometrician in him.... He was offended at\r\n     every start of wit, as a tender eye is by too strong a light.... At\r\n     last I saw an old man enter, pale and thin, whom I knew to be a\r\n     coffee house politician before he sat down; he was not one of those\r\n     who are never to be intimidated by disasters, but always prophesy\r\n     of victories and success; he was one of those timorous wretches who\r\n     are always boding ill.\r\n\r\nCafé Momus and Café Rotonde figure conspicuously in the record of French\r\nbohemianism. The Momus stood near the right bank of the River Seine in\r\nrue des Prêtres St.-Germain, and was known as the home of the bohemians.\r\nThe Rotonde stood on the left bank at the corner of the rue de l'École\r\nde Médecine and the rue Hautefeuille.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAFÉ DE PARIS IN 1843\r\n\r\nFrom an engraving by Bosredon]\r\n\r\nAlexandre Schanne has given us a glimpse of bohemian life in the early\r\ncafés. He lays his scene in the Café Rotonde, and tells how a number of\r\npoor students were wont to make one cup of coffee last the coterie a\r\nfull evening by using it to flavor and to color the one glass of water\r\nshared in common. He says:\r\n\r\n     Every evening, the first comer at the waiter's inquiry, \"What will\r\n     you take, sir?\" never failed to reply, \"Nothing just at present, I\r\n     am waiting for a friend.\" The friend arrived, to be assailed by the\r\n     brutal question, \"Have you any money?\" He would make a despairing\r\n     gesture in the negative, and then add, loud enough to be heard by\r\n     the _dame du comptoir_, \"By Jove, no; only fancy, I left my purse\r\n     on my console-table, with gilt feet, in the purest Louis XV style.\r\n     Ah! what a thing it is to be forgetful.\" He would sit down, and the\r\n     waiter would wipe the table as if he had something to do. A third\r\n     would come, who was sometimes able to reply, \"Yes. I have ten\r\n     sous.\" \"Good!\" we would reply; \"order a cup of coffee, a glass and\r\n     a water bottle; pay and give two sous to the waiter to secure his\r\n     silence.\" This would be done. Others would come and take their\r\n     places beside us, repeating to the waiter the same chorus, \"We are\r\n     with this gentleman.\" Frequently we would be eight or nine sitting\r\n     at the same table, and only one customer. Whilst smoking and\r\n     reading the papers we would, however, pass the glass and bottle.\r\n     When the water began to run short, as on a ship in distress, one of\r\n     us would have the impudence to call out, \"Waiter, some water!\" The\r\n     master of the establishment, who understood our situation, had no\r\n     doubt given orders for us to be left alone, and made his fortune\r\n     without our help. He was a good fellow and an intelligent one,\r\n     having subscribed to all the scientific journals of Europe, which\r\n     brought him the custom of foreign students.\r\n\r\nAnother café perpetuating the best traditions of the Latin Quarter was\r\nthe Vachette, which survived until the death of Jean Moréas in 1911. The\r\nVachette is usually cited by antiquarians as a model of circumspection\r\nas compared with the scores of cafés in the Quarter that were given up\r\nto debaucheries. One writer puts it: \"The Vachette traditions leaned\r\nmore to scholarship than sensuality.\"\r\n\r\nIn the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries the Parisian café\r\nwas truly a coffee house; but as many of the patrons began to while away\r\nmost of their waking hours in them, the proprietors added other\r\nbeverages and food to hold their patronage. Consequently, we find listed\r\namong the cafés of Paris some houses that are more accurately described\r\nas restaurants, although they may have started their careers as coffee\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Historic Parisian Cafés_\r\n\r\nSome of the historic cafés are still thriving in their original\r\nlocations, although the majority have now passed into oblivion. Glimpses\r\nof the more famous houses are to be found in the novels, poetry, and\r\nessays written by the French literati who patronized them. These\r\nfirst-hand accounts give insights that are sometimes stirring, often\r\namusing, and frequently revolting--such as the assassination of\r\nSt.-Fargean in Février's low-vaulted cellar café in the Palais Royal.\r\n\r\nThere is Magny's, originally the haunt of such literary men as Gautier,\r\nTaine, Saint-Victor, Turguenieff, de Goncourt, Soulie, Renan, Edmond. In\r\nrecent years the old Magny's was razed, and on its site was built the\r\nmodern restaurant of the same name, but in a style that has no\r\nresemblance to its predecessor. Even the name of the street has been\r\nchanged, from rue Contrescarpe to the rue Mazet.\r\n\r\nMéot's, the Véry, Beauvilliers', Massé's, the Café Chartres, the Troi\r\nFréres Provençaux, and the du Grand Commun, all situated in the Palais\r\nRoyal, are cafés that figured conspicuously in the French Revolution,\r\nand are closely identified with the French stage and literature. Méot's\r\nand Massé's were the trysting places of the Royalists in the days\r\npreceding the outbreak, but welcomed the Revolutionists after they came\r\nin power. The Chartres was notorious as the gathering place of young\r\naristocrats who escaped the guillotine, and, thus made bold, often\r\ncalled their like from adjoining cafés to partake in some of their plans\r\nfor restoration of the empire. The Trois Fréres Provençaux, well known\r\nfor its excellent and costly dinners, is mentioned by Balzac, Lord\r\nLytton, and Alfred de Musset in some of their novels. The Café du Grand\r\nCommun appears in Rousseau's _Confessions_ in connection with the play\r\n_Devin du Village_.\r\n\r\nAmong the most famous of the cafés on the Rue St. Honoré were Venua's,\r\npatronized by Robespierre and his companions of the Revolution, and\r\nperhaps the scene of the inhuman murder of Berthier and its revolting\r\naftermath; the Mapinot, which has gone down in café history as the scene\r\nof the banquet to Archibald Alison, the 22-year-old historian; and\r\nVoisin's café, around which still cling traditions of such literary\r\nlights as Zola, Alphonse Daudet, and Jules de Goncourt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF A TYPICAL PARISIAN CAFÉ OF THE EARLY\r\nNINETEENTH CENTURY]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the boulevard des Italiens had, and still has, more fashionable\r\ncafés than any other section of the French capital. The Tortoni, opened\r\nin the early days of the Empire by Velloni, an Italian lemonade vender,\r\nwas the most popular of the boulevard cafés, and was generally thronged\r\nwith fashionables from all parts of Europe. Here Louis Blanc, historian\r\nof the Revolution, spent many hours in the early days of his fame.\r\nTalleyrand; Rossini, the musician; Alfred Stevens and Edouard Manet,\r\nartists, are some of the names still linked with the traditions of the\r\nTortoni. Farther down the boulevard were the Café Riche, Maison Dorée,\r\nCafé Anglais, and the Café de Paris. The Riche and the Dorée, standing\r\nside by side, were both high-priced and noted for their revelries. The\r\nAnglais, which came into existence after the snuffing out of the Empire,\r\nwas also distinguished for its high prices, but in return gave an\r\nexcellent dinner and fine wines. It is told that even during the siege\r\nof Paris the Anglais offered its patrons \"such luxuries as ass, mule,\r\npeas, fried potatoes, and champagne.\"\r\n\r\nProbably the Café de Paris, which came into existence in 1822, in the\r\nformer home of the Russian Prince Demidoff, was the most richly equipped\r\nand elegantly conducted of any café in Paris in the nineteenth century.\r\nAlfred de Musset, a frequenter, said, \"you could not open its doors for\r\nless than 15 francs.\"\r\n\r\nThe Café Littéraire, opened on boulevard Bonne Nouvelle late in the\r\nnineteenth century, made a direct appeal to literary men for patronage,\r\nprinting this footnote on its menu: \"Every customer spending a franc in\r\nthis establishment is entitled to one volume of any work to be selected\r\nfrom our vast collection.\"\r\n\r\nThe names of Parisian cafés once more or less famous are legion. Some of\r\nthem are:\r\n\r\nThe Café Laurent, which Rousseau was forced to leave after writing an\r\nespecially bitter satire; the English café in which eccentric Lord\r\nWharton made merry with the Whig habitués; the Dutch café, the haunt of\r\nJacobites; Terre's, in the rue Neuve des Petits Champs, which Thackeray\r\ndescribed in _The Ballad of Bouillabaisse_; Maire's, in the boulevard\r\nSt.-Denis, which dates back beyond 1850; the Café Madrid, in the\r\nboulevard Montmartre, of which Carjat, the Spanish lyric poet, was an\r\nattraction; the Café de la Paix, in the boulevard des Capucines, the\r\nresort of Second Empire Imperialists and their spies; the Café Durand,\r\nin the place de la Madeleine, which started on a plane with the\r\nhigh-priced Riche, and ended its career early in the twentieth century;\r\nthe Rocher de Cancale, memorable for its feasts and high-living patrons\r\nfrom all over Europe; the Café Guerbois, near the rue de St. Petersburg,\r\nwhere Manet, the impressionist, after many vicissitudes, won fame for\r\nhis paintings and held court for many years; the Chat Noir, on the rue\r\nVictor Massé at Montmartre, a blend of café and concert hall, which has\r\nsince been imitated widely, both in name and feature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHESS HAS BEEN A FAVORITE PASTIME AT THE CAFÉ DE LA\r\nRÉGENCE FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION OF COFFEE INTO NORTH AMERICA\r\n\r\n     _Captain John Smith, founder of the Colony of Virginia, is the\r\n     first to bring to North America a knowledge of coffee in 1607--The\r\n     coffee grinder on the Mayflower--Coffee drinking in 1668--William\r\n     Penn's coffee purchase in 1683--Coffee in colonial New England--The\r\n     psychology of the Boston \"tea party,\" and why the United States\r\n     became a nation of coffee drinkers instead of tea drinkers, like\r\n     England--The first coffee license to Dorothy Jones in 1670--The\r\n     first coffee house in New England--Notable coffee houses of old\r\n     Boston--A skyscraper coffee house_\r\n\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the first to bring a knowledge of coffee to North America\r\nwas Captain John Smith, who founded the Colony of Virginia at Jamestown\r\nin 1607. Captain Smith became familiar with coffee in his travels in\r\nTurkey.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Dutch also had early knowledge of coffee, it does not\r\nappear that the Dutch West India Company brought any of it to the first\r\npermanent settlement on Manhattan Island (1624). Nor is there any record\r\nof coffee in the cargo of the Mayflower (1620), although it included a\r\nwooden mortar and pestle, later used to make \"coffee powder.\"\r\n\r\nIn the period when New York was New Amsterdam, and under Dutch occupancy\r\n(1624-64), it is possible that coffee may have been imported from\r\nHolland, where it was being sold on the Amsterdam market as early as\r\n1640, and where regular supplies of the green bean were being received\r\nfrom Mocha in 1663; but positive proof is lacking. The Dutch appear to\r\nhave brought tea across the Atlantic from Holland before coffee. The\r\nEnglish may have introduced the coffee drink into the New York colony\r\nbetween 1664 and 1673. The earliest reference to coffee in America is\r\n1668[87], at which time a beverage made from the roasted beans, and\r\nflavored with sugar or honey, and cinnamon, was being drunk in New York.\r\n\r\nCoffee first appears in the official records of the New England colony\r\nin 1670. In 1683, the year following William Penn's settlement on the\r\nDelaware, we find him buying supplies of coffee in the New York market\r\nand paying for them at the rate of eighteen shillings and nine pence per\r\npound.[88]\r\n\r\nCoffee houses patterned after the English and Continental prototypes\r\nwere soon established in all the colonies. Those of New York and\r\nPhiladelphia are described in separate chapters. The Boston houses are\r\ndescribed at the end of this chapter.\r\n\r\nNorfolk, Chicago, St. Louis, and New Orleans also had them. Conrad\r\nLeonhard's coffee house at 320 Market Street. St. Louis, was famous for\r\nits coffee and coffee cake, from 1844 to 1905, when it became a bakery\r\nand lunch room, removing in 1919 to Eighth and Pine Streets.\r\n\r\nIn the pioneer days of the great west, coffee and tea were hard to get;\r\nand, instead of them, teas were often made from garden herbs, spicewood,\r\nsassafras-roots, and other shrubs, taken from the thickets[89]. In\r\n1839, in the city of Chicago, one of the minor taverns was known as the\r\nLake Street coffee house. It was situated at the corner of Lake and\r\nWells Streets. A number of hotels, which in the English sense might more\r\nappropriately be called inns, met a demand for modest accommodation[90].\r\nTwo coffee houses were listed in the Chicago directories for 1843 and\r\n1845, the Washington coffee house, 83 Lake Street; and the Exchange\r\ncoffee house, Clarke Street between La Salle and South Water Streets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TYPES OF COLONIAL COFFEE ROASTERS\r\n\r\nThe cylinder at the top of the picture was revolved by hand in the\r\nfireplace; the skillets were set in the smouldering ashes]\r\n\r\nThe old-time coffee houses of New Orleans were situated within the\r\noriginal area of the city, the section bounded by the river, Canal\r\nStreet, Esplanade Avenue and Rampart Street. In the early days most of\r\nthe big business of the city was transacted in the coffee houses. The\r\n_brûleau_, coffee with orange juice, orange peel, and sugar, with cognac\r\nburned and mixed in it, originated in the New Orleans coffee house, and\r\nled to its gradual evolution into the saloon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How the United States Became a Nation of Coffee Drinkers_\r\n\r\nCoffee, tea, and chocolate were introduced into North America almost\r\nsimultaneously in the latter part of the seventeenth century. In the\r\nfirst half of the eighteenth century, tea had made such progress in\r\nEngland, thanks to the propaganda of the British East India Company,\r\nthat, being moved to extend its use in the colonies, the directors\r\nturned their eyes first in the direction of North America. Here,\r\nhowever, King George spoiled their well-laid plans by his unfortunate\r\nstamp act of 1765, which caused the colonists to raise the cry of \"no\r\ntaxation without representation.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the act was repealed in 1766, the right to tax was asserted,\r\nand in 1767 was again used, duties being laid on paints, oils, lead,\r\nglass, and tea. Once more the colonists resisted; and, by refusing to\r\nimport any goods of English make, so distressed the English\r\nmanufacturers that Parliament repealed every tax save that on tea.\r\nDespite the growing fondness for the beverage in America, the colonists\r\npreferred to get their tea elsewhere to sacrificing their principles and\r\nbuying it from England. A brisk trade in smuggling tea from Holland was\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\nIn a panic at the loss of the most promising of its colonial markets,\r\nthe British East India Company appealed to Parliament for aid, and was\r\npermitted to export tea, a privilege it had never before enjoyed.\r\nCargoes were sent on consignment to selected commissioners in Boston,\r\nNew York, Philadelphia, and Charleston. The story of the subsequent\r\nhappenings properly belongs in a book on tea. It is sufficient here to\r\nrefer to the climax of the agitation against the fateful tea tax,\r\nbecause it is undoubtedly responsible for our becoming a nation of\r\ncoffee drinkers instead of one of tea drinkers, like England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EARLY FAMILY COFFEE ROASTER\r\n\r\nThis machine, known in Holland as a \"Coffee Burner,\" was used late in\r\nthe 18th century in New England. It hung in the fireplace or stood in\r\nthe embers]\r\n\r\nThe Boston \"tea party\" of 1773, when citizens of Boston, disguised as\r\nIndians, boarded the English ships lying in Boston harbor and threw\r\ntheir tea cargoes into the bay, cast the die for coffee; for there and\r\nthen originated a subtle prejudice against \"the cup that cheers\", which\r\none hundred and fifty years have failed entirely to overcome. Meanwhile,\r\nthe change wrought in our social customs by this act, and those of like\r\nnature following it, in the New York, Pennsylvania, and Charleston\r\ncolonies, caused coffee to be crowned \"king of the American breakfast\r\ntable\", and the sovereign drink of the American people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HISTORICAL RELICS ASSOCIATED WITH THE EARLY DAYS OF\r\nCOFFEE IN NEW ENGLAND\r\n\r\nThese exhibits are in the Museum of the Maine Historical Society at\r\nPortland. On the left is Kenrick's Patent coffee mill. In the center is\r\na Britannia urn with an iron bar for heating the liquid. The bar was\r\nencased in a tin receptacle that hung inside the cover. On the right is\r\na wall type of coffee or spice grinder]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee in Colonial New England_\r\n\r\nThe history of coffee in colonial New England is so closely interwoven\r\nwith the story of the inns and taverns that it is difficult to\r\ndistinguish the genuine coffee house, as it was known in England, from\r\nthe public house where lodgings and liquors were to be had. The coffee\r\ndrink had strong competition from the heady wines, the liquors, and\r\nimported teas, and consequently it did not attain the vogue among the\r\ncolonial New Englanders that it did among Londoners of the late\r\nseventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nAlthough New England had its coffee houses, these were actually taverns\r\nwhere coffee was only one of the beverages served to patrons. \"They\r\nwere\", says Robinson, \"generally meeting places of those who were\r\nconservative in their views regarding church and state, being friends of\r\nthe ruling administration. Such persons were terms 'Courtiers' by their\r\nadversaries, the Dissenters and Republicans.\"\r\n\r\nMost of the coffee houses were established in Boston, the metropolis of\r\nthe Massachusetts Colony, and the social center of New England. While\r\nPlymouth, Salem, Chelsea, and Providence had taverns that served coffee,\r\nthey did not achieve the name and fame of some of the more celebrated\r\ncoffee houses in Boston.\r\n\r\nIt is not definitely known when the first coffee was brought in; but it\r\nis reasonable to suppose that it came as part of the household supplies\r\nof some settler (probably between 1660 and 1670), who had become\r\nacquainted with it before leaving England. Or it may have been\r\nintroduced by some British officer, who in London had made the rounds of\r\nthe more celebrated coffee houses of the latter half of the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The First Coffee License_\r\n\r\nAccording to early town records of Boston, Dorothy Jones was the first\r\nto be licensed to sell \"coffee and cuchaletto,\" the latter being the\r\nseventeenth-century spelling for chocolate or cocoa. This license is\r\ndated 1670, and is said to be the first written reference to coffee in\r\nthe Massachusetts Colony. It is not stated whether Dorothy Jones was a\r\nvender of the coffee drink or of \"coffee powder,\" as ground coffee was\r\nknown in the early days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MAYFLOWER \"COFFEE GRINDER\"\r\n\r\nMortar and pestle for \"braying\" coffee to make coffee powder, brought\r\nover in the Mayflower by the parents of Peregrine White]\r\n\r\nThere is some question as to whether Dorothy Jones was the first to sell\r\ncoffee as a beverage in Boston. Londoners had known and drunk coffee for\r\neighteen years before Dorothy Jones got her coffee license. British\r\ngovernment officials were frequently taking ship from London to the\r\nMassachusetts Colony, and it is likely that they brought tidings and\r\nsamples of the coffee the English gentry had lately taken up. No doubt\r\nthey also told about the new-style coffee houses that were becoming\r\npopular in all parts of London. And it may be assumed that their tales\r\ncaused the landlords of the inns and taverns of colonial Boston to add\r\ncoffee to their lists of beverages.\r\n\r\n\r\n_New England's First Coffee House_\r\n\r\nThe name coffee house did not come into use in New England until late in\r\nthe seventeenth century. Early colonial records do not make it clear\r\nwhether the London coffee house or the Gutteridge coffee house was the\r\nfirst to be opened in Boston with that distinctive title. In all\r\nlikelihood the London is entitled to the honor, for Samuel Gardner Drake\r\nin his _History and Antiquities of the City of Boston_, published in\r\n1854, says that \"Benj. Harris sold books there in 1689.\" Drake seems to\r\nbe the only historian of early Boston to mention the London coffee\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nGranting that the London coffee house was the first in Boston, then the\r\nGutteridge coffee house was the second. The latter stood on the north\r\nside of State Street, between Exchange and Washington Streets, and was\r\nnamed after Robert Gutteridge, who took out an innkeeper's license in\r\n1691. Twenty-seven years later, his widow, Mary Gutteridge, petitioned\r\nthe town for a renewal of her late husband's permit to keep a public\r\ncoffee house.\r\n\r\nThe British coffee house, which became the American coffee house when\r\nthe crown officers and all things British became obnoxious to the\r\ncolonists, also began its career about the time Gutteridge took out his\r\nlicense. It stood on the site that is now 66 State Street, and became\r\none of the most widely known coffee houses in colonial New England.\r\n\r\nOf course, there were several inns and taverns in existence in Boston\r\nlong before coffee and coffee houses came to the New England metropolis.\r\nSome of these taverns took up coffee when it became fashionable in the\r\ncolony, and served it to those patrons who did not care for the stronger\r\ndrinks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CROWN COFFEE HOUSE, BOSTON\r\n\r\nOne of the first in New England to bear the distinctive name of coffee\r\nhouse; opened in 1711 and burned down in 1780]\r\n\r\nThe earliest known inn was set up by Samuel Cole in Washington Street,\r\nmidway between Faneuil Hall and State Street. Cole was licensed as a\r\n\"comfit maker\" in 1634, four years after the founding of Boston; and two\r\nyears later, his inn was the temporary abiding place of the Indian\r\nchief Miantonomoh and his red warriors, who came to visit Governor Vane.\r\nIn the following year, the Earl of Marlborough found that Cole's inn was\r\nso \"exceedingly well governed,\" and afforded so desirable privacy, that\r\nhe refused the hospitality of Governor Winthrop at the governor's\r\nmansion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE MAKING AND SERVING DEVICES USED IN THE\r\nMASSACHUSETTS COLONY\r\n\r\nThese exhibits are in the Museum of the Essex Institute at Salem, Mass.\r\nTop row, left and right, Britannia serving pots; center, Britannia table\r\nurn; bottom row, left end, tin coffee making pot; center, Britannia\r\nserving pots; right end, tin French drip pot]\r\n\r\nAnother popular inn of the day was the Red Lyon, which was opened in\r\n1637 by Nicholas Upshall, the Quaker, who later was hanged for trying to\r\nbribe a jailer to pass some food into the jail to two Quakeresses who\r\nwere starving within.\r\n\r\nShip tavern, erected in 1650, at the corner of North and Clark Streets,\r\nthen on the waterfront, was a haunt of British government officials. The\r\nfather of Governor Hutchinson was the first landlord, to be succeeded in\r\n1663 by John Vyal. Here lived the four commissioners who were sent to\r\nthese shores by King Charles II to settle the disputes then beginning\r\nbetween the colonies and England.\r\n\r\nAnother lodging and eating place for the gentlemen of quality in the\r\nfirst days of Boston was the Blue Anchor, in Cornhill, which was\r\nconducted in 1664 by Robert Turner. Here gathered members of the\r\ngovernment, visiting officials, jurists, and the clergy, summoned into\r\nsynod by the Massachusetts General Court. It is assumed that the clergy\r\nconfined their drinking to coffee and other moderate beverages, leaving\r\nthe wines and liquors to their confrères.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some Notable Boston Coffee Houses_\r\n\r\nIn the last quarter of the seventeenth century quite a number of taverns\r\nand inns sprang up. Among the most notable that have obtained\r\nrecognition in Boston's historical records were the King's Head, at the\r\ncorner of Fleet and North Streets; the Indian Queen, on a passageway\r\nleading from Washington Street to Hawley Street; the Sun, in Faneuil\r\nHall Square, and the Green Dragon, which became one of the most\r\ncelebrated coffee-house taverns.\r\n\r\nThe King's Head, opened in 1691, early became a rendezvous of crown\r\nofficers and the citizens in the higher strata of colonial society.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Queen also became a favorite resort of the crown officers\r\nfrom Province House. Started by Nathaniel Bishop about 1673, it stood\r\nfor more than 145 years as the Indian Queen, and then was replaced by\r\nthe Washington coffee house, which became noted throughout New England\r\nas the starting place for the Roxbury \"hourlies,\" the stage coaches that\r\nran every hour from Boston to nearby Roxbury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE DEVICES THAT FIGURED IN THE PIONEERING OF THE\r\nGREAT WEST\r\n\r\nPhotographed for this work in the Museum of the State Historical Society\r\nof Wisconsin.

Started in\r\n1690 in Faneuil Hall Square, it was still standing in 1902, according to\r\nHenry R. Blaney; but has since been razed to make way for a modern\r\nskyscraper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: METAL AND CHINA COFFEE POTS USED IN NEW ENGLAND'S\r\nCOLONIAL DAYS\r\n\r\nFrom the collection in the Museum of the Pocumtuck Valley Memorial\r\nAssociation, Deerfield, Mass.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_New England's Most Famous Coffee House_\r\n\r\nThe Green Dragon, the last of the inns that were popular at the close of\r\nthe seventeenth century, was the most celebrated of Boston's\r\ncoffee-house taverns. It stood on Union Street, in the heart of the\r\ntown's business center, for 135 years, from 1697 to 1832, and figured in\r\npractically all the important local and national events during its long\r\ncareer. Red-coated British soldiers, colonial governors, bewigged crown\r\nofficers, earls and dukes, citizens of high estate, plotting\r\nrevolutionists of lesser degree, conspirators in the Boston Tea Party,\r\npatriots and generals of the Revolution--all these were wont to gather\r\nat the Green Dragon to discuss their various interests over their cups\r\nof coffee, and stronger drinks. In the words of Daniel Webster, this\r\nfamous coffee-house tavern was the \"headquarters of the Revolution.\" It\r\nwas here that Warren, John Adams, James Otis, and Paul Revere met as a\r\n\"ways and means committee\" to secure freedom for the American colonies.\r\nHere, too, came members of the Grand Lodge of Masons to hold their\r\nmeetings under the guidance of Warren, who was the first grand master of\r\nthe first Masonic lodge in Boston. The site of the old tavern, now\r\noccupied by a business block, is still the property of the St. Andrew's\r\nLodge of Free Masons. The old tavern was a two-storied brick structure\r\nwith a sharply pitched roof. Over its entrance hung a sign bearing the\r\nfigure of a green dragon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREEN DRAGON, THE CENTER OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL LIFE\r\nIN BOSTON FOR 135 YEARS\r\n\r\nThis tavern figured in practically all the important national affairs\r\nfrom 1697 to 1832, and, according to Daniel Webster, was the\r\n\"headquarters of the Revolution\"]\r\n\r\nPatrons of the Green Dragon and the British coffee house were decidedly\r\nopposed in their views on the questions of the day. While the Green\r\nDragon was the gathering place of the patriotic colonials, the British\r\nwas the rendezvous of the loyalists, and frequent were the encounters\r\nbetween the patrons of these two celebrated taverns. It was in the\r\nBritish coffee house that James Otis was so badly pummeled, after being\r\nlured there by political enemies, that he never regained his former\r\nbrilliancy as an orator.\r\n\r\nIt was there, in 1750, that some British red coats staged the first\r\ntheatrical entertainment given in Boston, playing Otway's _Orphan_.\r\nThere, the first organization of citizens to take the name of a club\r\nformed the Merchants' Club in 1751. The membership included officers of\r\nthe king, colonial governors and lesser officials, military and naval\r\nleaders, and members of the bar, with a sprinkling of high-ranking\r\ncitizens who were staunch friends of the crown. However, the British\r\nbecame so generally disliked that as soon as the king's troops evacuated\r\nBoston in the Revolution, the name of the coffee house was changed to\r\nthe American.\r\n\r\nThe Bunch of Grapes, that Francis Holmes presided over as early as 1712,\r\nwas another hot-bed of politicians. Like the Green Dragon over the way,\r\nits patrons included unconditional freedom seekers, many coming from the\r\nBritish coffee house when things became too hot for them in that Tory\r\natmosphere. The Bunch of Grapes became the center of a stirring\r\ncelebration in 1776, when a delegate from Philadelphia read the\r\nDeclaration of Independence from the balcony of the inn to the crowd\r\nassembled in the street below. So enthusiastic did the Bostonians become\r\nthat, in the excitement that followed, the inn was nearly destroyed when\r\none enthusiast built a bonfire too close to its walls. Another anecdote\r\ntold of the Bunch of Grapes concerns Sir William Phipps, governor of\r\nMassachusetts from 1692-94, who was noted for his irascibility. He had\r\nhis favorite chair and window in the inn, and in the accounts of the\r\nperiod it is written that on any fine afternoon his glowering\r\ncountenance could be seen at the window by the passers-by on State\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nAfter the beginning of the eighteenth century the title of coffee house\r\nwas applied to a number of hostelries opened in Boston. One of these was\r\nthe Crown, which was opened in the \"first house on Long Wharf\" in 1711\r\nby Jonathan Belcher, who later became governor of Massachusetts, and\r\nstill later of New Jersey. The first landlord of the Crown was Thomas\r\nSelby, who by trade was a periwig maker, but probably found the selling\r\nof strong drink and coffee more profitable. Selby's coffee house was\r\nalso used as an auction room. The Crown stood until 1780, when it was\r\ndestroyed in a fire that swept the Long Wharf. On its site now stands\r\nthe Fidelity Trust Company at 148 State Street.\r\n\r\nAnother early Boston coffee house on State Street was the Royal\r\nExchange. How long it had been standing before it was first mentioned in\r\ncolonial records in 1711 is unknown. It occupied an ancient two-story\r\nbuilding, and was kept in 1711 by Benjamin Johns. This coffee house\r\nbecame the starting place for stage coaches running between Boston and\r\nNew York, the first one leaving September 7, 1772. In the _Columbian\r\nCentinel_ of January 1, 1800, appeared an advertisement in which it was\r\nsaid: \"New York and Providence Mail Stage leaves Major Hatches' Royal\r\nExchange Coffee House in State Street every morning at 8 o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nIn the latter half of the eighteenth century the North-End coffee house\r\nwas celebrated as the highest-class coffee house in Boston. It occupied\r\nthe three-storied brick mansion which had been built about 1740 by\r\nEdward Hutchinson, brother of the noted governor. It stood on the west\r\nside of North Street, between Sun Court and Fleet Street, and was one of\r\nthe most pretentious of its kind. An eighteenth century writer, in\r\ndescribing this coffee-house mansion, made much of the fact that it had\r\nforty-five windows and was valued at $4,500, a large sum for those days.\r\nDuring the Revolution, Captain David Porter, father of Admiral David D.\r\nPorter, was the landlord, and under him it became celebrated throughout\r\nthe city as a high-grade eating place. The advertisements of the\r\nNorth-End coffee house featured its \"dinners and suppers--small and\r\nretired rooms for small company--oyster suppers in the nicest manner.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: METAL COFFEE POTS USED IN THE NEW YORK COLONY\r\n\r\nLeft, tin coffee pot, dark brown, with \"love apple\" decoration in red,\r\nNew Jersey Historical Society, Newark; right, weighted bottom tin pot\r\nwith rose decoration, private owner]\r\n\r\n\r\n_A \"Skyscraper\" Coffee House_\r\n\r\nThe Boston coffee-house period reached its height in 1808, when the\r\ndoors of the Exchange coffee house were thrown open after three years of\r\nbuilding. This structure, situated on Congress Street near State\r\nStreet, was the skyscraper of its day, and probably was the most\r\nambitious coffee-house project the world has known. Built of stone,\r\nmarble, and brick, it stood seven stories high, and cost a half-million\r\ndollars. Charles Bulfinch, America's most noted architect of that\r\nperiod, was the designer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXCHANGE COFFEE HOUSE, BOSTON, 1808, PROBABLY THE LARGEST\r\nAND MOST COSTLY IN THE WORLD\r\n\r\nBuilt of stone, marble and brick, it stood seven stories high and cost\r\n$500,000. It was patterned after Lloyd's of London, and was the center\r\nof marine intelligence in Boston]\r\n\r\nLike Lloyd's coffee house in London, the Exchange was the center of\r\nmarine intelligence, and its public rooms were thronged all day and\r\nevening with mariners, naval officers, ship and insurance brokers, who\r\nhad come to talk shop or to consult the records of ship arrivals and\r\ndepartures, manifests, charters, and other marine papers. The first\r\nfloor of the Exchange was devoted to trading. On the next floor was the\r\nlarge dining room, where many sumptuous banquets were given, notably the\r\none to President Monroe in July, 1817, which was attended by former\r\nPresident John Adams, and by many generals, commodores, governors, and\r\njudges. The other floors were given over to living and sleeping rooms,\r\nof which there were more than 200. The Exchange coffee house was\r\ndestroyed by fire in 1818; and on its site was erected another, bearing\r\nthe same name, but having slight resemblance to its predecessor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRESIDENT-ELECT WASHINGTON WELCOMED AT THE MERCHANTS\r\nCOFFEE HOUSE, NEW YORK\r\n\r\nThe reception took place April 23, 1789, one week before his\r\ninauguration.

Gruppe, owned by the author]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF COFFEE IN OLD NEW YORK\r\n\r\n     _The burghers of New Amsterdam begin to substitute coffee for\r\n     \"must,\" or beer, at breakfast in 1668--William Penn makes his first\r\n     purchase of coffee in the green bean from New York merchants in\r\n     1683--The King's Arms, the first coffee house--The historic\r\n     Merchants, sometimes called the \"Birthplace of our Union\"--The\r\n     coffee house as a civic forum--The Exchange, Whitehall, Burns,\r\n     Tontine, and other celebrated coffee houses--The Vauxhall and\r\n     Ranelagh pleasure gardens_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dutch founders of New York seem to have introduced tea into New\r\nAmsterdam before they brought in coffee. This was somewhere about the\r\nmiddle of the seventeenth century. We find it recorded that about 1668\r\nthe burghers succumbed to coffee[91]. Coffee made its way slowly, first\r\nin the homes, where it replaced the \"must\", or beer, at breakfast.\r\nChocolate came about the same time, but was more of a luxury than tea or\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\nAfter the surrender of New York to the British in 1674, English manners\r\nand customs were rapidly introduced. First tea, and later coffee, were\r\nfavorite beverages in the homes. By 1683 New York had become so central\r\na market for the green bean, that William Penn, as soon as he found\r\nhimself comfortably settled in the Pennsylvania Colony, sent over to New\r\nYork for his coffee supplies[92]. It was not long before a social need\r\narose that only the London style of coffee house could fill.\r\n\r\nThe coffee houses of early New York, like their prototypes in London,\r\nParis, and other old world capitals, were the centers of the business,\r\npolitical and, to some extent, of the social life of the city. But they\r\nnever became the forcing-beds of literature that the French and English\r\nhouses were, principally because the colonists had no professional\r\nwriters of note.\r\n\r\nThere is one outstanding feature of the early American coffee houses,\r\nparticularly of those opened in New York, that is not distinctive of the\r\nEuropean houses. The colonists sometimes held court trials in the long,\r\nor assembly, room of the early coffee houses; and often held their\r\ngeneral assembly and council meetings there.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Coffee House as a Civic Forum_\r\n\r\nThe early coffee house was an important factor in New York life. What\r\nthe perpetuation of this public gathering place meant to the citizens is\r\nshown by a complaint (evidently designed to revive the declining\r\nfortunes of the historic Merchants coffee house) in the _New York\r\nJournal_ of October 19, 1775, which, in part, said:\r\n\r\n     To the Inhabitants of New York:\r\n\r\n     It gives me concern, in this time of public difficulty and danger,\r\n     to find we have in this city no place of daily general meeting,\r\n     where we might hear and communicate intelligence from every quarter\r\n     and freely confer with one another on every matter that concerns\r\n     us. Such a place of general meeting is of very great advantage in\r\n     many respects, especially at such a time as this, besides the\r\n     satisfaction it affords and the sociable disposition it has a\r\n     tendency to keep up among us, which was never more wanted than at\r\n     this time. To answer all these and many other good and useful\r\n     purposes, coffee houses have been universally deemed the most\r\n     convenient places of resort, because, at a small expense of time or\r\n     money, persons wanted may be found and spoke with, appointments may\r\n     be made, current news heard, and whatever it most concerns us to\r\n     know. In all cities, therefore, and large towns that I have seen in\r\n     the British dominions, sufficient encouragement has been given to\r\n     support one or more coffee houses in a genteel manner. How comes it\r\n     then that New York, the most central, and one of the largest and\r\n     most prosperous cities in British America, cannot support one\r\n     coffee house? It is a scandal to the city and its inhabitants to be\r\n     destitute of such a convenience for want of due encouragement. A\r\n     coffee house, indeed, there is, a very good and comfortable one,\r\n     extremely well tended and accommodated, but it is frequented but by\r\n     an inconsiderable number of people; and I have observed with\r\n     surprise, that but a small part of those who do frequent it,\r\n     contribute anything at all to the expense of it, but come in and go\r\n     out without calling for or paying anything to the house. In all the\r\n     coffee houses in London, it is customary for every one that comes\r\n     in to call for at least a dish of coffee, or leave the value of\r\n     one, which is but reasonable, because when the keepers of these\r\n     houses have been at the expense of setting them up and providing\r\n     all necessaries for the accommodation of company, every one that\r\n     comes to receive the benefit of these conveniences ought to\r\n     contribute something towards the expense of them.\r\n\r\nA FRIEND TO THE CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_New York's First Coffee House_\r\n\r\nSome chroniclers of New York's early days are confident that the first\r\ncoffee house in America was opened in New York; but the earliest\r\nauthenticated record they have presented is that on November 1, 1696,\r\nJohn Hutchins bought a lot on Broadway, between Trinity churchyard and\r\nwhat is now Cedar Street, and there built a house, naming it the King's\r\nArms. Against this record, Boston can present the statement in Samuel\r\nGardner Drake's _History and Antiquities of the City of Boston_ that\r\nBenj. Harris sold books at the \"London Coffee House\" in 1689.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW YORK'S PIONEER COFFEE HOUSE, THE KING'S ARMS, OPENED\r\nIN 1696\r\n\r\nThis view shows the garden side of the historic old house as it was\r\nconducted by John Hutchins, near Trinity Church, on Broadway. The\r\nobservatory may have been added later]\r\n\r\nThe King's Arms was built of wood, and had a front of yellow brick, said\r\nto have been brought from Holland. The building was two stories high,\r\nand on the roof was an \"observatory,\" arranged with seats, and\r\ncommanding a fine view of the bay, the river, and the city. Here the\r\ncoffee-house visitors frequently sat in the afternoons. It is not shown\r\nin the illustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURNS COFFEE HOUSE AS IT APPEARED ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE\r\nNINETEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\nIt stood for many years on Broadway, opposite Bowling Green, in the old\r\nDe Lancey House, becoming known in 1763 as the King's Arms, and later\r\nthe Atlantic Garden House]\r\n\r\nThe sides of the main room on the lower floor were lined with booths,\r\nwhich, for the sake of greater privacy, were screened with green\r\ncurtains. There a patron could sip his coffee, or a more stimulating\r\ndrink, and look over his mail in the same exclusiveness affected by the\r\nLondoner of the time.\r\n\r\nThe rooms on the second floor were used for special meetings of\r\nmerchants, colonial magistrates and overseers, or similar public and\r\nprivate business.\r\n\r\nThe meeting room, as above described, seems to have been one of the\r\nchief features distinguishing a coffee house from a tavern. Although\r\nboth types of houses had rooms for guests, and served meals, the coffee\r\nhouse was used for business purposes by permanent customers, while the\r\ntavern was patronized more by transients. Men met at the coffee house\r\ndaily to carry on business, and went to the tavern for convivial\r\npurposes or lodgings. Before the front door hung the sign of \"the lion\r\nand the unicorn fighting for the crown.\"\r\n\r\nFor many years the King's Arms was the only coffee house in the city; or\r\nat least no other seems of sufficient importance to have been mentioned\r\nin colonial records. For this reason it was more frequently designated\r\nas \"the\" coffee house than the King's Arms. Contemporary records of the\r\narrest of John Hutchins of the King's Arms, and of Roger Baker, for\r\nspeaking disrespectfully of King George, mention the King's Head, of\r\nwhich Baker was proprietor. But it is generally believed that this\r\npublic house was a tavern and not rightfully to be considered as a\r\ncoffee house. The White Lion, mentioned about 1700, was also a tavern,\r\nor inn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The New Coffee House_\r\n\r\nUnder date of September 22, 1709, the _Journal of the General Assembly\r\nof the Colony of New York_ refers to a conference held in the \"New\r\nCoffee House.\" About this date the business section of the city had\r\nbegun to drift eastward from Broadway to the waterfront; and from this\r\nfact it is assumed that the name \"New Coffee House\" indicates that the\r\nKing's Arms had been removed from its original location near Cedar\r\nStreet, or that it may have lost favor and have been superseded in\r\npopularity by a newer coffee house. The _Journal_ does not give the\r\nlocation of the \"New\" coffee house. Whatever the case may be, the name\r\nof the King's Arms does not again appear in the records until 1763, and\r\nthen it had more the character of a tavern, or roadhouse.\r\n\r\nThe public records from 1709 up to 1729 are silent in regard to coffee\r\nhouses in New York. In 1725 the pioneer newspaper in the city, the _New\r\nYork Gazette_, came into existence; and four years later, 1729, there\r\nappeared in it an advertisement stating that \"a competent bookkeeper may\r\nbe heard of\" at the \"Coffee House.\" In 1730 another advertisement in the\r\nsame journal tells of a sale of land by public vendue (auction) to be\r\nheld at the Exchange coffee house.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Exchange Coffee House_\r\n\r\nBy reason of its name, the Exchange Coffee House is thought to have been\r\nlocated at the foot of Broad Street, abutting the sea-wall and near the\r\nLong Bridge of that day. At that time this section was the business\r\ncenter of the city, and here was a trading exchange.\r\n\r\nThat the Exchange coffee house was the only one of its kind in New York\r\nin 1732 is inferred from the announcement in that year of a meeting of\r\nthe conference committee of the Council and Assembly \"at the Coffee\r\nHouse.\" In seeming confirmation of this conclusion, is the advertisement\r\nin 1733 in the _New York Gazette_ requesting the return of \"lost sleeve\r\nbuttons to Mr. Todd, next door to the Coffee House.\" The records of the\r\nday show that a Robert Todd kept the famous Black Horse tavern which was\r\nlocated in this part of the city.\r\n\r\nAgain we hear of the Exchange coffee house in 1737, and apparently in\r\nthe same location, where it is mentioned in an account of the \"Negro\r\nplot\" as being next door to the Fighting Cocks tavern by the Long\r\nBridge, at the foot of Broad Street. Also in this same year it is named\r\nas the place of public vendue of land situated on Broadway.\r\n\r\nBy this time the Exchange coffee house had virtually become the city's\r\nofficial auction room, as well as the place to buy and to drink coffee.\r\nCommodities of many kinds were also bought and sold there, both within\r\nthe house and on the sidewalk before it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Merchants Coffee House_\r\n\r\nIn the year 1750, the Exchange coffee house had begun to lose its\r\nlong-held prestige, and its name was changed to the Gentlemen's Exchange\r\ncoffee house and tavern. A year later it had migrated to Broadway under\r\nthe name of the Gentlemens' coffee house and tavern. In 1753 it was\r\nmoved again, to Hunter's Quay, which was situated on what is now Front\r\nStreet, somewhere between the present Old Slip and Wall Street. The\r\nfamous old coffee house seems to have gone out of existence about this\r\ntime, its passing hastened, no doubt, by the newer enterprise, the\r\nMerchants coffee house, which was to become the most celebrated in New\r\nYork, and, according to some writers, the most historic in America.\r\n\r\nIt is not certain just when the Merchants coffee house was first opened.\r\nAs near as can be determined, Daniel Bloom, a mariner, in 1737 bought\r\nthe Jamaica Pilot Boat tavern from John Dunks and named it the Merchants\r\ncoffee house. The building was situated on the northwest corner of the\r\npresent Wall Street and Water (then Queen) Street; and Bloom was its\r\nlandlord until his death, soon after the year 1750. He was succeeded by\r\nCaptain James Ackland, who shortly sold it to Luke Roome. The latter\r\ndisposed of the building in 1758 to Dr. Charles Arding. The doctor\r\nleased it to Mrs. Mary Ferrari, who continued as its proprietor until\r\nshe moved, in 1772, to the newer building diagonally across the street,\r\nbuilt by William Brownejohn, on the southeast corner of Wall and Water\r\nStreets. Mrs. Ferrari took with her the patronage and the name of the\r\nMerchants coffee house, and the old building was not used again as a\r\ncoffee house.\r\n\r\nThe building housing the original Merchants coffee house was a two-story\r\nstructure, with a balcony on the roof, which was typical of the middle\r\neighteenth century architecture in New York. On the first floor were the\r\ncoffee bar and booths described in connection with the King's Arms\r\ncoffee house. The second floor had the typical long room for public\r\nassembly.\r\n\r\nDuring Bloom's proprietorship the Merchants coffee house had a long,\r\nhard struggle to win the patronage away from the Exchange coffee house,\r\nwhich was flourishing at that time. But, being located near the Meal\r\nMarket, where the merchants were wont to gather for trading purposes, it\r\ngradually became the meeting place of the city, at the expense of the\r\nExchange coffee house, farther down the waterfront.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MERCHANTS COFFEE HOUSE (AT THE RIGHT) AS IT APPEARED FROM\r\n1772 TO 1804\r\n\r\nThe original coffee house of this name was opened on the northwest\r\ncorner of Wall and Water Streets about 1737, the business being moved to\r\nthe southeast corner in 1772]\r\n\r\nWidow Ferrari presided over the original Merchants coffee house for\r\nfourteen years, until she moved across the street. She was a keen\r\nbusiness woman. Just before she was ready to open the new coffee house\r\nshe announced to her old patrons that she would give a house-warming, at\r\nwhich arrack, punch, wine, cold ham, tongue, and other delicacies of the\r\nday would be served. The event was duly noted in the newspapers, one\r\nstating that \"the agreeable situation and the elegance of the new house\r\nhad occasioned a great resort of company to it.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Ferrari continued in charge until May 1, 1776, when Cornelius\r\nBradford became proprietor and sought to build up the patronage, that\r\nhad dwindled somewhat during the stirring days immediately preceding the\r\nRevolution. In his announcement of the change of ownership, he said,\r\n\"Interesting intelligence will be carefully collected and the greatest\r\nattention will be given to the arrival of vessels, when trade and\r\nnavigation shall resume their former channels.\" He referred to the\r\ncomplete embargo of trade to Europe which the colonists were enduring.\r\nWhen the American troops withdrew from the city during the Revolution,\r\nBradford went also, to Rhinebeck on the Hudson.\r\n\r\nDuring the British occupation, the Merchants coffee house was a place of\r\ngreat activity. As before, it was the center of trading, and under the\r\nBritish régime it became also the place where the prize ships were sold.\r\nThe Chamber of Commerce resumed its sessions in the upper long room in\r\n1779, having been suspended since 1775. The Chamber paid fifty pounds\r\nrent per annum for the use of the room to Mrs. Smith, the landlady at\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nIn 1781 John Stachan, then proprietor of the Queen's Head tavern, became\r\nlandlord of the Merchants coffee house, and he promised in a public\r\nannouncement \"to pay attention not only as a Coffee House, but as a\r\ntavern, in the truest; and to distinguish the same as the City Tavern\r\nand Coffee House, with constant and best attendance. Breakfast from\r\nseven to eleven; soups and relishes from eleven to half-past one. Tea,\r\ncoffee, etc., in the afternoon, as in England.\" But when he began\r\ncharging sixpence for receiving and dispatching letters by man-o'-war to\r\nEngland, he brought a storm about his ears, and was forced to give up\r\nthe practise. He continued in charge until peace came, and Cornelius\r\nBradford came with it to resume proprietorship of the coffee house.\r\n\r\nBradford changed the name to the New York coffee house, but the public\r\ncontinued to call it by its original name, and the landlord soon gave\r\nin. He kept a marine list, giving the names of vessels arriving and\r\ndeparting, recording their ports of sailing. He also opened a register\r\nof returning citizens, \"where any gentleman now resident in the city,\"\r\nhis advertisement stated, \"may insert their names and place of\r\nresidence.\" This seems to have been the first attempt at a city\r\ndirectory. By his energy Bradford soon made the Merchants coffee house\r\nagain the business center of the city. When he died, in 1786, he was\r\nmourned as one of the leading citizens. His funeral was held at the\r\ncoffee house over which he had presided so well.\r\n\r\nThe Merchants coffee house continued to be the principal public\r\ngathering place until it was destroyed by fire in 1804. During its\r\nexistence it had figured prominently in many of the local and national\r\nhistoric events, too numerous to record here in detail.\r\n\r\nSome of the famous events were: The reading of the order to the\r\ncitizens, in 1765, warning them to stop rioting against the Stamp Act;\r\nthe debates on the subject of not accepting consignments of goods from\r\nGreat Britain; the demonstration by the Sons of Liberty, sometimes\r\ncalled the \"Liberty Boys,\" made before Captain Lockyer of the tea ship\r\nNancy which had been turned away from Boston and sought to land its\r\ncargo in New York in 1774; the general meeting of citizens on May 19,\r\n1774, to discuss a means of communicating with the Massachusetts colony\r\nto obtain co-ordinated effort in resisting England's oppression, out of\r\nwhich came the letter suggesting a congress of deputies from the\r\ncolonies and calling for a \"virtuous and spirited Union;\" the mass\r\nmeeting of citizens in the days immediately following the battles at\r\nConcord and Lexington in Massachusetts; and the forming of the Committee\r\nof One Hundred to administer the public business, making the Merchants\r\ncoffee house virtually the seat of government.\r\n\r\nWhen the American Army held the city in 1776, the coffee house became\r\nthe resort of army and navy officers. Its culminating glory came on\r\nApril 23, 1789, when Washington, the recently elected first president of\r\nthe United States, was officially greeted at the coffee house by the\r\ngovernor of the State, the mayor of the city, and the lesser municipal\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nAs a meeting place for societies and lodges the Merchants coffee house\r\nwas long distinguished. In addition to the purely commercial\r\norganizations that gathered in its long room, these bodies regularly met\r\nthere in their early days: The Society of Arts, Agriculture and Economy;\r\nKnights of Corsica; New York Committee of Correspondence; New York\r\nMarine Society; Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York; Lodge 169,\r\nFree and Accepted Masons; Whig Society; Society of the New York\r\nHospital; St. Andrew's Society; Society of the Cincinnati; Society of\r\nthe Sons of St. Patrick; Society for Promoting the Manumission of\r\nSlaves; Society for the Relief of Distressed Debtors; Black Friars\r\nSociety; Independent Rangers; and Federal Republicans.\r\n\r\nHere also came the men who, in 1784, formed the Bank of New York, the\r\nfirst financial institution in the city; and here was held, in 1790, the\r\nfirst public sale of stocks by sworn brokers. Here, too, was held the\r\norganization meeting of subscribers to the Tontine coffee house, which\r\nin a few years was to prove a worthy rival.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some Lesser Known Coffee Houses_\r\n\r\nBefore taking up the story of the famous Tontine coffee house it should\r\nbe noted that the Merchants coffee house had some prior measure of\r\ncompetition. For four years the Exchange coffee room sought to cater to\r\nthe wants of the merchants around the foot of Broad Street. It was\r\nlocated in the Royal Exchange, which had been erected in 1752 in place\r\nof the old Exchange, and until 1754 had been used as a store. Then\r\nWilliam Keen and Alexander Lightfoot got control and started their\r\ncoffee room, with a ball room attached. The partnership split up in\r\n1756, Lightfoot continuing operations until he died the next year, when\r\nhis widow tried to carry it on. In 1758 it had reverted into its\r\noriginal character of a mercantile establishment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TONTINE COFFEE HOUSE (SECOND BUILDING AT THE LEFT),\r\nOPENED IN 1792\r\n\r\nThis is the original structure, northwest corner of Wall and Water\r\nStreets, which was succeeded about 1850 by a five-story building (see\r\npage 122) that in turn was replaced by a modern office building]\r\n\r\nThen there was the Whitehall coffee house, which two men, named Rogers\r\nand Humphreys, opened in 1762, with the announcement that \"a\r\ncorrespondence is settled in London and Bristol to remit by every\r\nopportunity all the public prints and pamphlets as soon as published;\r\nand there will be a weekly supply of New York, Boston and other American\r\nnewspapers.\" This enterprise had a short life.\r\n\r\nThe early records of the city infrequently mention the Burns coffee\r\nhouse, sometimes calling it a tavern. It is likely that the place was\r\nmore an inn than a coffee house. It was kept for a number of years by\r\nGeorge Burns, near the Battery, and was located in the historic old De\r\nLancey house, which afterward became the City hotel.\r\n\r\nBurns remained the proprietor until 1762, when it was taken over by a\r\nMrs. Steele, who gave it the name of the King's Arms. Edward Barden\r\nbecame the landlord in 1768. In later years it became known as the\r\nAtlantic Garden house. Traitor Benedict Arnold is said to have lodged in\r\nthe old tavern after deserting to the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe Bank coffee house belonged to a later generation, and had few of the\r\ncharacteristics of the earlier coffee houses. It was opened in 1814 by\r\nWilliam Niblo, of Niblo's Garden fame, and stood at the corner of\r\nWilliam and Pine Streets, at the rear of the Bank of New York. The\r\ncoffee house endured for probably ten years, and became the gathering\r\nplace of a coterie of prominent merchants, who formed a sort of club.\r\nThe Bank coffee house became celebrated for its dinners and dinner\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nFraunces' tavern, best known as the place where Washington bade farewell\r\nto his army officers, was, as its name states, a tavern, and can not be\r\nproperly classed as a coffee house. While coffee was served, and there\r\nwas a long room for gatherings, little, if any, business was done there\r\nby merchants. It was largely a meeting place for citizens bent on a\r\n\"good time.\"\r\n\r\nThen there was the New England and Quebec coffee house, which was also a\r\ntavern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TONTINE BUILDING OF 1850\r\n\r\nNorthwest corner of Wall and Water Streets; an omnibus of the\r\nBroadway-Wall-Street Ferry line is passing]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Tontine Coffee House_\r\n\r\nThe last of the celebrated coffee houses of New York bore the name,\r\nTontine coffee house. For several years after the burning of the\r\nMerchants coffee house, in 1804, it was the only one of note in the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nFeeling that they should have a more commodious coffee house for\r\ncarrying on their various business enterprises, some 150 merchants\r\norganized, in 1791, the Tontine coffee house. This enterprise was based\r\non the plan introduced into France in 1653 by Lorenzo Tonti, with slight\r\nvariations. According to the New York Tontine plan, each holder's share\r\nreverted automatically to the surviving shareholders in the association,\r\ninstead of to his heirs. There were 157 original shareholders, and 203\r\nshares of stock valued at £200 each.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NIBLO'S GARDEN, BROADWAY AND PRINCE STREET, 1828]\r\n\r\nThe directors bought the house and lot on the northwest corner of Wall\r\nand Water Streets, where the original Merchants coffee house stood,\r\npaying £1,970. They next acquired the adjoining lots on Wall and Water\r\nStreets, paying £2,510 for the former, and £1,000 for the latter.\r\n\r\nThe cornerstone of the new coffee house was laid June 5, 1792; and a\r\nyear later to the day, 120 gentlemen sat down to a banquet in the\r\ncompleted coffee house to celebrate the event of the year before. John\r\nHyde was the first landlord. The house had cost $43,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE RELICS OF DUTCH NEW YORK\r\n\r\nSpice-grinder boat, coffee roaster, and coffee pots at the Van Cortlandt\r\nMuseum]\r\n\r\nA contemporary account of how the Tontine coffee house looked in 1794 is\r\nsupplied by an Englishman visiting New York at the time:\r\n\r\n     The Tontine tavern and coffee house is a handsome large brick\r\n     building; you ascend six or eight steps under a portico, into a\r\n     large public room, which is the Stock Exchange of New York, where\r\n     all bargains are made. Here are two books kept, as at Lloyd's [in\r\n     London] of every ship's arrival and clearance. This house was built\r\n     for the accommodation of the merchants by Tontine shares of two\r\n     hundred pounds each. It is kept by Mr. Hyde, formerly a woolen\r\n     draper in London. You can lodge and board there at a common table,\r\n     and you pay ten shillings currency a day, whether you dine out or\r\n     not.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW YORK'S VAUXHALL GARDEN OF 1803\r\n\r\nFrom an old print]\r\n\r\nThe stock market made its headquarters in the Tontine coffee house in\r\n1817, and the early organization was elaborated and became the New York\r\nStock and Exchange Board. It was removed in 1827 to the Merchants\r\nExchange Building, where it remained until that place was destroyed by\r\nfire in 1835.\r\n\r\nIt was stipulated in the original articles of the Tontine Association\r\nthat the house was to be kept and used as a coffee house, and this\r\nagreement was adhered to up to the year 1834, when, by permission of the\r\nCourt of Chancery, the premises were let for general business-office\r\npurposes. This change was due to the competition offered by the\r\nMerchants Exchange, a short distance up Wall Street, which had been\r\nopened soon after the completion of the Tontine coffee house building.\r\n\r\nAs the city grew, the business-office quarters of the original Tontine\r\ncoffee house became inadequate; and about the year 1850 a new five-story\r\nbuilding, costing some $60,000, succeeded it. By this time the building\r\nhad lost its old coffee-house characteristics. This new Tontine\r\nstructure is said to have been the first real office building in New\r\nYork City. Today the site is occupied by a large modern office building,\r\nwhich still retains the name of Tontine. It was owned by John B. and\r\nCharles A. O'Donohue, well known New York coffee merchants, until 1920,\r\nwhen it was sold for $1,000,000 to the Federal Sugar Refining Company.\r\n\r\nThe Tontine coffee house did not figure so prominently in the historic\r\nevents of the nation and city as did its neighbor, the Merchants coffee\r\nhouse. However, it became the Mecca for visitors from all parts of the\r\ncountry, who did not consider their sojourn in the city complete until\r\nthey had at least inspected what was then one of the most pretentious\r\nbuildings in New York. Chroniclers of the Tontine coffee house always\r\nsay that most of the leaders of the nation, together with distinguished\r\nvisitors from abroad, had foregathered in the large room of the old\r\ncoffee house at some time during their careers.\r\n\r\nIt was on the walls of the Tontine coffee house that bulletins were\r\nposted on Hamilton's struggle for life after the fatal duel forced on\r\nhim by Aaron Burr.\r\n\r\nThe changing of the Tontine coffee house into a purely mercantile\r\nbuilding marked the end of the coffee-house era in New York. Exchanges\r\nand office buildings had come into existence to take the place of the\r\nbusiness features of the coffee houses; clubs were organized to take\r\ncare of the social functions; and restaurants and hotels had sprung up\r\nto cater to the needs for beverages and food.\r\n\r\n\r\n_New York's Pleasure Gardens_\r\n\r\nThere was a fairly successful attempt made to introduce the London\r\npleasure-garden idea into New York. First, tea gardens were added to\r\nseveral of the taverns already provided with ball rooms. Then, on the\r\noutskirts of the city, were opened the Vauxhall and the Ranelagh\r\ngardens, so named after their famous London prototypes. The first\r\nVauxhall garden (there were three of this name) was on Greenwich Street,\r\nbetween Warren and Chambers Streets. It fronted on the North River,\r\naffording a beautiful view up the Hudson. Starting as the Bowling Green\r\ngarden, it changed to Vauxhall in 1750.\r\n\r\nRanelagh was on Broadway, between Duane and Worth Streets, on the site\r\nwhere later the New York Hospital was erected. From advertisements of\r\nthe period (1765-69) we learn that there were band concerts twice a week\r\nat the Ranelagh. The gardens were \"for breakfasting as well as the\r\nevening entertainment of ladies and gentlemen.\" There was a commodious\r\nhall in the garden for dancing. Ranelagh lasted twenty years. Coffee,\r\ntea, and hot rolls could be had in the pleasure gardens at any hour of\r\nthe day. Fireworks were featured at both Ranelagh and Vauxhall gardens.\r\nThe second Vauxhall was near the intersection of the present Mulberry\r\nand Grand Streets, in 1798; the third was on Bowery Road, near Astor\r\nPlace, in 1803. The Astor library was built upon its site in 1853.\r\n\r\nWilliam Niblo, previously proprietor of the Bank coffee house in Pine\r\nStreet, opened, in 1828, a pleasure garden, that he named Sans Souci, on\r\nthe site of a circus building called the Stadium at Broadway and Prince\r\nStreet. In the center of the garden remained the stadium, which was\r\ndevoted to theatrical performances of \"a gay and attractive character.\"\r\nLater, he built a more pretentious theater that fronted on Broadway. The\r\ninterior of the garden was \"spacious, and adorned with shrubbery and\r\nwalks, lighted with festoons of lamps.\" It was generally known as\r\nNiblo's garden.\r\n\r\nAmong other well known pleasure gardens of old New York were Contoit's,\r\nlater the New York garden, and Cherry gardens, on old Cherry Hill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAVERN AND GROCERS' SIGNS USED IN OLD NEW YORK\r\n\r\nLeft, Smith Richards, grocer and confectioner, \"at the sign of the tea\r\ncanister and two sugar loaves\" (1773); center, the King's Arms,\r\noriginally Burns coffee house (1767); right, George Webster, Grocer, \"at\r\nthe sign of the three sugar loaves\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nCOFFEE HOUSES OF OLD PHILADELPHIA\r\n\r\n     _Ye Coffee House, Philadelphia's first coffee house, opened about\r\n     1700--The two London coffee houses--The City tavern, or Merchants\r\n     coffee house--How these, and other celebrated resorts, dominated\r\n     the social, political, and business life of the Quaker City in the\r\n     eighteenth century_\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn is generally credited with the introduction of coffee into\r\nthe Quaker colony which he founded on the Delaware in 1682. He also\r\nbrought to the \"city of brotherly love\" that other great drink of human\r\nbrotherhood, tea. At first (1700), \"like tea, coffee was only a drink\r\nfor the well-to-do, except in sips.\"[93] As was the case in the other\r\nEnglish colonies, coffee languished for a time while tea rose in favor,\r\nmore especially in the home.\r\n\r\nFollowing the stamp act of 1765, and the tea tax of 1767, the\r\nPennsylvania Colony joined hands with the others in a general tea\r\nboycott; and coffee received the same impetus as elsewhere in the\r\ncolonies that became the thirteen original states.\r\n\r\nThe coffee houses of early Philadelphia loom large in the history of the\r\ncity and the republic. Picturesque in themselves, with their distinctive\r\ncolonial architecture, their associations also were romantic. Many a\r\ncivic, sociological, and industrial reform came into existence in the\r\nlow-ceilinged, sanded-floor main rooms of the city's early coffee\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nFor many years, Ye coffee house, the two London coffee houses, and the\r\nCity tavern (also known as the Merchants coffee house) each in its turn\r\ndominated the official and social life of Philadelphia. The earlier\r\nhouses were the regular meeting places of Quaker municipal officers,\r\nship captains, and merchants who came to transact public and private\r\nbusiness. As the outbreak of the Revolution drew near, fiery colonials,\r\nmany in Quaker garb, congregated there to argue against British\r\noppression of the colonies. After the Revolution, the leading citizens\r\nresorted to the coffee house to dine and sup and to hold their social\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nWhen the city was founded in 1682, coffee cost too much to admit of its\r\nbeing retailed to the general public at coffee houses. William Penn\r\nwrote in his _Accounts_ that in 1683 coffee in the berry was sometimes\r\nprocured in New York at a cost of eighteen shillings nine pence the\r\npound, equal to about $4.68. He told also that meals were served in the\r\nordinaries at six pence (equal to twelve cents), to wit: \"We have seven\r\nordinaries for the entertainment of strangers and for workmen that are\r\nnot housekeepers, and a good meal is to be had there for six pence\r\nsterling.\" With green coffee costing $4.68 a pound, making the price of\r\na cup about seventeen cents, it is not likely that coffee was on the\r\nmenus of the ordinaries serving meals at twelve cents each. Ale was the\r\ncommon meal-time beverage.\r\n\r\nThere were four classes of public houses--inns, taverns, ordinaries, and\r\ncoffee houses. The inn was a modest hotel that supplied lodgings, food,\r\nand drink, the beverages consisting mostly of ale, port, Jamaica rum,\r\nand Madeira wine. The tavern, though accommodating guests with bed and\r\nboard, was more of a drinking place than a lodging house. The ordinary\r\ncombined the characteristics of a restaurant and a boarding house. The\r\ncoffee house was a pretentious tavern, dispensing, in most cases,\r\nintoxicating drinks as well as coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Philadelphia's First Coffee House_\r\n\r\nThe first house of public resort opened in Philadelphia bore the name of\r\nthe Blue Anchor tavern, and was probably established in 1683 or 1684;\r\ncolonial records do not state definitely. As its name indicates, this\r\nwas a tavern. The first coffee house came into existence about the year\r\n1700. Watson, in one place in his _Annals_ of the city, says 1700, but\r\nin another 1702. The earlier date is thought to be correct, and is\r\nseemingly substantiated by the co-authors Scharf and Westcott in their\r\n_History_ of the city, in which they say, \"The first public house\r\ndesignated as a coffee house was built in Penn's time [1682-1701] by\r\nSamuel Carpenter, on the east side of Front Street, probably above\r\nWalnut Street. That it was the first of its kind--the only one in fact\r\nfor some years--seems to be established beyond doubt. It was always\r\nreferred to in old times as 'Ye Coffee House.'\"\r\n\r\nCarpenter owned also the Globe inn, which was separated from Ye coffee\r\nhouse by a public stairway running down from Front Street to Water\r\nStreet, and, it is supposed, to Carpenter's Wharf. The exact location of\r\nthe old house was recently established from the title to the original\r\npatentee, Samuel Carpenter, by a Philadelphia real-estate\r\ntitle-guarantee company, as being between Walnut and Chestnut Streets,\r\nand occupying six and a half feet of what is now No. 137 South Front\r\nStreet and the whole of No. 139.\r\n\r\nHow long Ye coffee house endured is uncertain. It was last mentioned in\r\ncolonial records in a real estate conveyance from Carpenter to Samuel\r\nFinney, dated April 26, 1703. In that document it is described as \"That\r\nbrick Messuage, or Tenement, called Ye Coffee House, in the possession\r\nof Henry Flower, and situate, lying and being upon or before the bank of\r\nthe Delaware River, containing in length about thirty feet and in\r\nbreadth about twenty-four.\"\r\n\r\nThe Henry Flower mentioned as the proprietor of Philadelphia's first\r\ncoffee house, was postmaster of the province for a number of years, and\r\nit is believed that Ye coffee house also did duty as the post-office for\r\na time. Benjamin Franklin's _Pennsylvania Gazette_, in an issue\r\npublished in 1734, has this advertisement:\r\n\r\n     _All persons who are indebted to Henry Flower, late postmaster of\r\n     Pennsylvania, for Postage of Letters or otherwise, are desir'd to\r\n     pay the same to him at the old Coffee House in Philadelphia._\r\n\r\nFlower's advertisement would indicate that Ye coffee house, then\r\nvenerable enough to be designated as old, was still in existence, and\r\nthat Flower was to be found there. Franklin also seems to have been in\r\nthe coffee business, for in several issues of the _Gazette_ around the\r\nyear 1740 he advertised: \"Very good coffee sold by the Printer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_The First London Coffee House_\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia's second coffee house bore the name of the London coffee\r\nhouse, which title was later used for the resort William Bradford opened\r\nin 1754. The first house of this name was built in 1702, but there seems\r\nto be some doubt about its location. Writing in the _American Historical\r\nRegister_, Charles H. Browning says: \"William Rodney came to\r\nPhiladelphia with Penn in 1682, and resided in Kent County, where he\r\ndied in 1708; he built the old London coffee house at Front and Market\r\nStreets in 1702.\" Another chronicler gives its location as \"above Walnut\r\nStreet, either on the east side of Water Street, or on Delaware Avenue,\r\nor, as the streets are very close together, it may have been on both.\r\nJohn Shewbert, its proprietor, was a parishioner of Christ Church, and\r\nhis establishment was largely patronized by Church of England people.\"\r\nIt was also the gathering place of the followers of Penn and the\r\nProprietary party, while their opponents, the political cohorts of\r\nColonel Quarry, frequented Ye coffee house.\r\n\r\nThe first London coffee house resembled a fashionable club house in its\r\nlater years, suitable for the \"genteel\" entertainments of the well-to-do\r\nPhiladelphians. Ye coffee house was more of a commercial or public\r\nexchange. Evidence of the gentility of the London is given by John\r\nWilliam Wallace:\r\n\r\n     The appointments of the London Coffee House, if we may infer what\r\n     they were from the will of Mrs. Shubert [Shewbert] dated November\r\n     27, 1751, were genteel. By that instrument she makes bequest of\r\n     two silver quart tankards; a silver cup; a silver porringer; a\r\n     silver pepper pot; two sets of silver castors; a silver soup spoon;\r\n     a silver sauce spoon, and numerous silver tablespoons and tea\r\n     spoons, with a silver tea-pot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SECOND LONDON COFFEE HOUSE, OPENED IN 1754 BY WILLIAM\r\nBRADFORD, THE PRINTER\r\n\r\nUp to the outbreak of the American Revolution, it was more frequented\r\nthan any other tavern in the Quaker city as a place of resort and\r\nentertainment, and was famous throughout the colonies]\r\n\r\nOne of the many historic incidents connected with this old house was the\r\nvisit there by William Penn's eldest son, John, in 1733, when he\r\nentertained the General Assembly of the province on one day and on the\r\nnext feasted the City Corporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Roberts' Coffee House_\r\n\r\nAnother house with some fame in the middle of the eighteenth century was\r\nRoberts' coffee house, which stood in Front Street near the first London\r\nhouse. Though its opening date is unknown, it is believed to have come\r\ninto existence about 1740. In 1744 a British army officer recruiting\r\ntroops for service in Jamaica advertised in the newspaper of the day\r\nthat he could be seen at the Widow Roberts' coffee house. During the\r\nFrench and Indian War, when Philadelphia was in grave danger of attack\r\nby French and Spanish privateers, the citizens felt so great relief when\r\nthe British ship Otter came to the rescue, that they proposed a public\r\nbanquet in honor of the Otter's captain to be held at Roberts' coffee\r\nhouse. For some unrecorded reason the entertainment was not given;\r\nprobably because the house was too small to accommodate all the citizens\r\ndesiring to attend. Widow Roberts retired in 1754.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The James Coffee House_\r\n\r\nContemporary with Roberts' coffee house was the resort run first by\r\nWidow James, and later by her son, James James. It was established in\r\n1744, and occupied a large wooden building on the northwest corner of\r\nFront and Walnut Streets. It was patronized by Governor Thomas and many\r\nof his political followers, and its name frequently appeared in the news\r\nand advertising columns of the _Pennsylvania Gazette_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Second London Coffee House_\r\n\r\nProbably the most celebrated coffee house in Penn's city was the one\r\nestablished by William Bradford, printer of the _Pennsylvania Journal_.\r\nIt was on the southwest corner of Second and Market Streets, and was\r\nnamed the London coffee house, the second house in Philadelphia to bear\r\nthat title. The building had stood since 1702, when Charles Reed, later\r\nmayor of the city, put it up on land which he bought from Letitia Penn,\r\ndaughter of William Penn, the founder. Bradford was the first to use the\r\nstructure for coffee-house purposes, and he tells his reason for\r\nentering upon the business in his petition to the governor for a\r\nlicense: \"Having been advised to keep a Coffee House for the benefit of\r\nmerchants and traders, and as some people may at times be desirous to be\r\nfurnished with other liquors besides coffee, your petitioner apprehends\r\nit is necessary to have the Governor's license.\" This would indicate\r\nthat in that day coffee was drunk as a refreshment between meals, as\r\nwere spirituous liquors for so many years before, and thereafter up to\r\n1920.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SELLING SLAVES AT THE OLD LONDON COFFEE HOUSE]\r\n\r\nBradford's London coffee house seems to have been a joint-stock\r\nenterprise, for in his _Journal_ of April 11, 1754, appeared this\r\nnotice: \"Subscribers to a public coffee house are invited to meet at the\r\nCourthouse on Friday, the 19th instant, at 3 o'clock, to choose trustees\r\nagreeably to the plan of subscription.\"\r\n\r\nThe building was a three-story wooden structure, with an attic that some\r\nhistorians count as the fourth story. There was a wooden awning\r\none-story high extending out to cover the sidewalk before the coffee\r\nhouse. The entrance was on Market (then known as High) Street.\r\n\r\nThe London coffee house was \"the pulsating heart of excitement,\r\nenterprise, and patriotism\" of the early city. The most active citizens\r\ncongregated there--merchants, shipmasters, travelers from other colonies\r\nand countries, crown and provincial officers. The governor and persons\r\nof equal note went there at certain hours \"to sip their coffee from the\r\nhissing urn, and some of those stately visitors had their own stalls.\"\r\nIt had also the character of a mercantile exchange--carriages, horses,\r\nfoodstuffs, and the like being sold there at auction. It is further\r\nrelated that the early slave-holding Philadelphians sold negro men,\r\nwomen, and children at vendue, exhibiting the slaves on a platform set\r\nup in the street before the coffee house.\r\n\r\nThe resort was the barometer of public sentiment. It was in the street\r\nbefore this house that a newspaper published in Barbados, bearing a\r\nstamp in accordance with the provisions of the stamp act, was publicly\r\nburned in 1765, amid the cheers of bystanders. It was here that Captain\r\nWise of the brig Minerva, from Pool, England, who brought news of the\r\nrepeal of the act, was enthusiastically greeted by the crowd in May,\r\n1766. Here, too, for several years the fishermen set up May poles.\r\n\r\nBradford gave up the coffee house when he joined the newly formed\r\nRevolutionary army as major, later becoming a colonel. When the British\r\nentered the city in September, 1777, the officers resorted to the London\r\ncoffee house, which was much frequented by Tory sympathizers. After the\r\nBritish had evacuated the city, Colonel Bradford resumed proprietorship;\r\nbut he found a change in the public's attitude toward the old resort,\r\nand thereafter its fortunes began to decline, probably hastened by the\r\nkeen competition offered by the City tavern, which had been opened a few\r\nyears before.\r\n\r\nBradford gave up the lease in 1780, transferring the property to John\r\nPemberton, who leased it to Gifford Dally. Pemberton was a Friend, and\r\nhis scruples about gambling and other sins are well exhibited in the\r\nterms of the lease in which said Dally \"covenants and agrees and\r\npromises that he will exert his endeavors as a Christian to preserve\r\ndecency and order in said house, and to discourage the profanation of\r\nthe sacred name of God Almighty by cursing, swearing, etc., and that the\r\nhouse on the first day of the week shall always be kept closed from\r\npublic use.\" It is further covenanted that \"under a penalty of £100 he\r\nwill not allow or suffer any person to use, or play at, or divert\r\nthemselves with cards, dice, backgammon, or any other unlawful game.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CITY TAVERN, BUILT IN 1773, AND KNOWN AS THE\r\nMERCHANTS COFFEE HOUSE\r\n\r\nThe tavern (at the left) was regarded as the largest inn of the colonies\r\nand stood next to the Bank of Pennsylvania (center). From a print made\r\nfrom a rare Birch engraving]\r\n\r\nIt would seem from the terms of the lease that what Pemberton thought\r\nwere ungodly things, were countenanced in other coffee houses of the\r\nday. Perhaps the regulations were too strict; for a few years later the\r\nhouse had passed into the hands of John Stokes, who used it as dwelling\r\nand a store.\r\n\r\n\r\n_City Tavern or Merchants Coffee House_\r\n\r\nThe last of the celebrated coffee houses in Philadelphia was built in\r\n1773 under the name of the City tavern, which later became known as the\r\nMerchants coffee house, possibly after the house of the same name that\r\nwas then famous in New York. It stood in Second Street near Walnut\r\nStreet, and in some respects was even more noted than Bradford's London\r\ncoffee house, with which it had to compete in its early days.\r\n\r\nThe City tavern was patterned after the best London coffee houses; and\r\nwhen opened, it was looked upon as the finest and largest of its kind in\r\nAmerica. It was three stories high, built of brick, and had several\r\nlarge club rooms, two of which were connected by a wide doorway that,\r\nwhen open, made a large dining room fifty feet long.\r\n\r\nDaniel Smith was the first proprietor, and he opened it to the public\r\nearly in 1774. Before the Revolution, Smith had a hard struggle trying\r\nto win patronage from Bradford's London coffee house, standing only a\r\nfew blocks away. But during and after the war, the City tavern gradually\r\ntook the lead, and for more than a quarter of a century was the\r\nprincipal gathering place of the city. At first, the house had various\r\nnames in the public mind, some calling it by its proper title, the City\r\ntavern, others attaching the name of the proprietor and designating it\r\nas Smith's tavern, while still others used the title, the New tavern.\r\n\r\nThe gentlefolk of the city resorted to the City tavern after the\r\nRevolution as they had to Bradford's coffee house before. However,\r\nbefore reaching this high estate, it once was near destruction at the\r\nhands of the Tories, who threatened to tear it down. That was when it\r\nwas proposed to hold a banquet there in honor of Mrs. George Washington,\r\nwho had stopped in the city in 1776 while on the way to meet her\r\ndistinguished husband, then at Cambridge in Massachusetts, taking over\r\ncommand of the American army. Trouble was averted by Mrs. Washington\r\ntactfully declining to appear at the tavern.\r\n\r\nAfter peace came, the house was the scene of many of the fashionable\r\nentertainments of the period. Here met the City Dancing Assembly, and\r\nhere was held the brilliant fête given by M. Gerard, first accredited\r\nrepresentative from France to the United States, in honor of Louis XVI's\r\nbirthday. Washington, Jefferson, Hamilton, and other leaders of public\r\nthought were more or less frequent visitors when in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe exact date when the City tavern became the Merchants coffee house is\r\nunknown. When James Kitchen became proprietor, at the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century, it was so called. In 1806 Kitchen turned the house\r\ninto a bourse, or mercantile exchange. By that time clubs and hotels had\r\ncome into fashion, and the coffee-house idea was losing caste with the\r\nélite of the city.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1806 William Renshaw planned to open the Exchange coffee\r\nhouse in the Bingham mansion on Third Street. He even solicited\r\nsubscriptions to the enterprise, saying that he proposed to keep a\r\nmarine diary and a registry of vessels for sale, to receive and to\r\nforward ships' letter bags, and to have accommodations for holding\r\nauctions. But he was persuaded from the idea, partly by the fact that\r\nthe Merchants coffee house seemed to be satisfactorily filling that\r\nparticular niche in the city life, and partly because the hotel business\r\noffered better inducements. He abandoned the plan, and opened the\r\nMansion House hotel in the Bingham residence in 1807.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXCHANGE COFFEE HOUSE SCENE IN \"HAMILTON\"\r\n\r\nIn this setting for the first act of the play by Mary P. Hamlin and\r\nGeorge Arliss, produced in 1918, the scenic artist aimed to give a true\r\nhistorical background, and combined the features of several inns and\r\ncoffee houses in Philadelphia, Virginia, and New England as they existed\r\nin Washington's first administration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE BOTANY OF THE COFFEE PLANT\r\n\r\n     _Its complete classification by class, sub-class, order, family,\r\n     genus, and species--How the Coffea arabica grows, flowers, and\r\n     bears--Other species and hybrids described--Natural caffein-free\r\n     coffee--Fungoid diseases of coffee_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coffee tree, scientifically known as _Coffea arabica_, is native to\r\nAbyssinia and Ethiopia, but grows well in Java, Sumatra, and other\r\nislands of the Dutch East Indies; in India, Arabia, equatorial Africa,\r\nthe islands of the Pacific, in Mexico, Central and South America, and\r\nthe West Indies. The plant belongs to the large sub-kingdom of plants\r\nknown scientifically as the Angiosperms, or _Angiospermæ_, which means\r\nthat the plant reproduces by seeds which are enclosed in a box-like\r\ncompartment, known as the ovary, at the base of the flower. The word\r\nAngiosperm is derived from two Greek words, _sperma_, a seed, and\r\n_aggeion_, pronounced angeion, a box, the box referred to being the\r\novary.\r\n\r\nThis large sub-kingdom is subdivided into two classes. The basis for\r\nthis division is the number of leaves in the little plant which develops\r\nfrom the seed. The coffee plant, as it develops from the seed, has two\r\nlittle leaves, and therefore belongs to the class _Dicotyledoneæ_. This\r\nword _dicotyledoneæ_ is made up of the two Greek words, _di(s)_, two,\r\nand _kotyledon_, cavity or socket. It is not necessary to see the young\r\nplant that develops from the seed in order to know that it had two seed\r\nleaves; because the mature plant always shows certain characteristics\r\nthat accompany this condition of the seed.\r\n\r\nIn every plant having two seed leaves, the mature leaves are\r\nnetted-veined, which is a condition easily recognized even by the\r\nlayman; also the parts of the flowers are in circles containing two or\r\nfive parts, but never in threes or sixes. The stems of plants of this\r\nclass always increase in thickness by means of a layer of cells known as\r\na cambium, which is a tissue that continues to divide throughout its\r\nwhole existence. The fact that this cambium divides as long as it lives,\r\ngives rise to a peculiar appearance in woody stems by which we can, on\r\nlooking at the stem of a tree of this type when it has been sawed\r\nacross, tell the age of the tree.\r\n\r\nIn the spring the cambium produces large open cells through which large\r\nquantities of sap can run; in the fall it produces very thick-walled\r\ncells, as there is not so much sap to be carried. Because these\r\nthin-walled open cells of one spring are next to the thick-walled cells\r\nof the last autumn, it is very easy to distinguish one year's growth\r\nfrom the next; the marks so produced are called annual rings.\r\n\r\nWe have now classified coffee as far as the class; and so far we could\r\ngo if we had only the leaves and stem of the coffee plant. In order to\r\nproceed farther, we must have the flowers of the plant, as botanical\r\nclassification goes from this point on the basis of the flowers. The\r\nclass _Dicotyledoneæ_ is separated into sub-classes according to whether\r\nthe flower's corolla (the showy part of the flower which ordinarily\r\ngives it its color) is all in one piece, or is divided into a number of\r\nparts. The coffee flower is arranged with its corolla all in one piece,\r\nforming a tube-shaped arrangement, and accordingly the coffee plant\r\nbelongs to the sub-class _Sympetalæ_, or _Metachlamydeæ_, which means\r\nthat its petals are united.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COFFEE TREE, SHOWING DETAILS OF FLOWERS AND FRUIT\r\n\r\nFrom a drawing by Ch. Emonts in Jardin's _Le Caféier et Le Café_]\r\n\r\nThe next step in classification is to place the plant in the proper\r\ndivision under the sub-class, which is the order. Plants are separated\r\ninto orders according to their varied characteristics. The coffee plant\r\nbelongs to an order known as _Rubiales_. These orders are again divided\r\ninto families. Coffee is placed in the family _Rubiaceæ_, or Madder\r\nFamily, in which we find herbs, shrubs or trees, represented by a few\r\nAmerican plants, such as bluets, or Quaker ladies, small blue spring\r\nflowers, common to open meadows in northern United States; and partridge\r\nberries (_Mitchella repens_).\r\n\r\nThe Madder Family has more foreign representatives than native genera,\r\namong which are _Coffea_, _Cinchona_, and _Ipecacuanha_ (_Uragoga_), all\r\nof which are of economic importance. The members of this family are\r\nnoted for their action on the nervous system. Coffee, as is well known,\r\ncontains an active principle known as caffein which acts as a stimulant\r\nto the nervous system and in small quantities is very beneficial.\r\n_Cinchona_ supplies us with quinine, while _Ipecacuanha_ produces\r\nipecac, which is an emetic and purgative.\r\n\r\nThe families are divided into smaller sections known as genera, and to\r\nthe genus _Coffea_ belongs the coffee plant. Under this genus _Coffea_\r\nare several sub-genera, and to the sub-genus _Eucoffea_ belongs our\r\ncommon coffee, _Coffea arabica_. _Coffea arabica_ is the original or\r\ncommon Java coffee of commerce. The term \"common\" coffee may seem\r\nunnecessary, but there are many other species of coffee besides\r\n_arabica_. These species have not been described very frequently;\r\nbecause their native haunts are the tropics, and the tropics do not\r\nalways offer favorable conditions for the study of their plants.\r\n\r\nAll botanists do not agree in their classification of the species and\r\nvarieties of the _coffea_ genus. M.E. de Wildman, curator of the royal\r\nbotanical gardens at Brussels, in his _Les Plantes Tropicales de Grande\r\nCulture_, says the systematic division of this interesting genus is far\r\nfrom finished; in fact, it may be said hardly to be begun.\r\n\r\n_Coffea arabica_ we know best because of the important rôle it plays in\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nCOMPLETE CLASSIFICATION OF COFFEE\r\n\r\nKingdom                          _Vegetable_\r\nSub-Kingdom                    _Angiospermæ_\r\nClass                        _Dicotyledoneæ_\r\nSub-class       _Sympetalæ or Metachlamydeæ_\r\nOrder                             _Rubiales_\r\nFamily                            _Rubiaceæ_\r\nGenus                               _Coffea_\r\nSub-genus                         _Eucoffea_\r\nSpecies                         _C. arabica_\r\n\r\nThe coffee plant most cultivated for its berries is, as already stated,\r\n_Coffea arabica_, which is found in tropical regions, although it can\r\ngrow in temperate climates. Unlike most plants that grow best in the\r\ntropics, it can stand low temperatures. It requires shade when it grows\r\nin hot, low-lying districts; but when it grows on elevated land, it\r\nthrives without such protection. Freeman[94] says there are about eight\r\nrecognized species of _coffea_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DETAILS OF THE GERMINATION OF THE COFFEE PLANT\r\n\r\nFrom a drawing by Ch. Emonts in Jardin's _Le Caféier et Le Café_]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffea Arabica_\r\n\r\n_Coffea arabica_ is a shrub with evergreen leaves, and reaches a height\r\nof fourteen to twenty feet when fully grown. The shrub produces\r\ndimorphic branches, _i.e._, branches of two forms, known as uprights and\r\nlaterals. When young, the plants have a main stem, the upright, which,\r\nhowever, eventually sends out side shoots, the laterals. The laterals\r\nmay send out other laterals, known as secondary laterals; but no lateral\r\ncan ever produce an upright. The laterals are produced in pairs and are\r\nopposite, the pairs being borne in whorls around the stem. The laterals\r\nare produced only while the joint of the upright, to which they are\r\nattached, is young; and if they are broken off at that point, the\r\nupright has no power to reproduce them. The upright can produce new\r\nuprights also; but if an upright is cut off, the laterals at that\r\nposition tend to thicken up. This is very desirable, as the laterals\r\nproduce the flowers, which seldom appear on the uprights. This fact is\r\nutilized in pruning the coffee tree, the uprights being cut back, the\r\nlaterals then becoming more productive. Planters generally keep their\r\ntrees pruned down to about six feet.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are lanceolate, or lance-shaped, being borne in pairs\r\nopposite each other. They are three to six inches in length, with an\r\nacuminate apex, somewhat attenuate at the base, with very short petioles\r\nwhich are united with the short interpetiolar stipules at the base. The\r\ncoffee leaves are thin, but of firm texture, slightly coriaceous. They\r\nare very dark green on the upper surface, but much lighter underneath.\r\nThe margin of the leaf is entire and wavy. In some tropical countries\r\nthe natives brew a coffee tea from the leaves of the coffee tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRAZIL COFFEE PLANTATION IN FLOWER]\r\n\r\nThe coffee flowers are small, white, and very fragrant, having a\r\ndelicate characteristic odor. They are borne in the axils of the leaves\r\nin clusters, and several crops are produced in one season, depending on\r\nthe conditions of heat and moisture that prevail in the particular\r\nseason. The different blossomings are classed as main blossoming and\r\nsmaller blossomings. In semi-dry high districts, as in Costa Rica or\r\nGuatemala, there is one blossoming season, about March, and flowers and\r\nfruit are not found together, as a rule, on the trees. But in lowland\r\nplantations where rain is perennial, blooming and fruiting continue\r\npractically all the year; and ripe fruits, green fruits, open flowers,\r\nand flower buds are to be found at the same time on the same branchlet,\r\nnot mixed together, but in the order indicated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEA ARABICA--PORTO RICO]\r\n\r\nThe flowers are also tubular, the tube of the corolla dividing into five\r\nwhite segments. Dr. P.J.S. Cramer, chief of the division of plant\r\nbreeding, Department of Agriculture, Netherlands India, says the number\r\nof petals is not at all constant, not even for flowers of the same tree.\r\nThe corolla segments are about one-half inch in length, while the tube\r\nitself is about three-eighths of an inch long. The anthers of the\r\nstamens, which are five in number, protrude from the top of the corolla\r\ntube, together with the top of the two-cleft pistil. The calyx, which is\r\nso small as to escape notice unless one is aware of its existence, is\r\nannular, with small, tooth-like indentations.\r\n\r\nWhile the usual color of the coffee flower is white, the fresh stamens\r\nand pistils may have a greenish tinge, and in some cultivated species\r\nthe corolla is pale pink.\r\n\r\nThe size and condition of the flowers are entirely dependent on the\r\nweather. The flowers are sometimes very small, very fragrant, and very\r\nnumerous; while at other times, when the weather is not hot and dry,\r\nthey are very large, but not so numerous. Both sets of flowers mentioned\r\nabove \"set fruit,\" as it is called; but at times, especially in a very\r\ndry season, they bear flowers that are few in number, small, and\r\nimperfectly formed, the petals frequently being green instead of white.\r\nThese flowers do not set fruit. The flowers that open on a dry sunny day\r\nshow a greater yield of fruit than those that open on a wet day, as the\r\nfirst mentioned have a better chance of being pollinated by the insects\r\nand the wind. The beauty of a coffee estate in flower is of a very\r\nfleeting character. One day it is a snowy expanse of fragrant white\r\nblossoms for miles and miles, as far as the eye can see, and two days\r\nlater it reminds one of the lines from Villon's _Des Dames du Temps\r\nJadis_.\r\n\r\nWhere are the snows of yesterday?\r\nThe winter winds have blown them all away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEA ARABICA, FLOWER AND FRUIT--COSTA RICA]\r\n\r\nBut here, the winter winds are not to blame: the soft, gentle breezes of\r\nthe perpetual summer have wrought the havoc, leaving, however, a not\r\nunpleasing picture of dark, cool, mossy green foliage.\r\n\r\nThe flowers are beautiful, but the eye of the planter sees in them not\r\nalone beauty and fragrance. He looks far beyond, and in his mind's eye\r\nhe sees bags and bags of green coffee, representing to him the goal and\r\nreward of all his toil. After the flowers droop, there appear what are\r\ncommercially known as the coffee berries. Botanically speaking, \"berry\"\r\nis a misnomer. These little fruits are not berries, such as are well\r\nrepresented by the grape; but are drupes, which are better exemplified\r\nby the cherry and the peach. In the course of six or seven months, these\r\ncoffee drupes develop into little red balls about the size of an\r\nordinary cherry; but, instead of being round, they are somewhat\r\nellipsoidal, having at the outer end a small umbilicus. The drupe of the\r\ncoffee usually has two locules, each containing a little \"stone\" (the\r\nseed and its parchment covering) from which the coffee bean (seed) is\r\nobtained. Some few drupes contain three, while others, at the outer ends\r\nof the branches, contain only one round bean, known as the peaberry. The\r\nnumber of pickings corresponds to the different blossomings in the same\r\nseason; and one tree of the species _arabica_ may yield from one to\r\ntwelve pounds a year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YOUNG COFFEA ARABICA TREE AT KONA, HAWAII]\r\n\r\nIn countries like India and Africa, the birds and monkeys eat the ripe\r\ncoffee berries. The so-called \"monkey coffee\" of India, according to\r\nArnold, is the undigested coffee beans passed through the alimentary\r\ncanal of the animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SURVIVORS OF THE FIRST LIBERIAN COFFEE TREES INTRODUCED\r\nINTO JAVA IN 1876]\r\n\r\nThe pulp surrounding the coffee beans is at present of no commercial\r\nimportance. Although efforts have been made at various times by natives\r\nto use it as a food, its flavor has not gained any great popularity, and\r\nthe birds are permitted a monopoly of the pulp as a food. From the human\r\nstandpoint the pulp, or sarcocarp, as it is scientifically called, is\r\nrather an annoyance, as it must be removed in order to procure the\r\nbeans. This is done in one of two ways. The first is known as the dry\r\nmethod, in which the entire fruit is allowed to dry, and is then cracked\r\nopen. The second way is called the wet method; the sarcocarp is removed\r\nby machine, and two wet, slimy seed packets are obtained. These packets,\r\nwhich look for all the world like seeds, are allowed to dry in such a\r\nway that fermentation takes place. This rids them of all the slime; and,\r\nafter they are thoroughly dry, the endocarp, the so-called parchment\r\ncovering, is easily cracked open and removed. At the same time that the\r\nparchment is removed, a thin silvery membrane, the silver skin, beneath\r\nthe parchment, comes off, too. There are always small fragments of this\r\nsilver skin to be found in the groove of the coffee bean contained\r\nwithin the parchment packet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEA ARABICA IN FLOWER ON A JAVA ESTATE\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph made at Dramaga, Preanger, Java, in 1907]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIBERIAN COFFEE TREE AT LAMOA, P.I.]\r\n\r\nWe have said that the coffee tree yields from one to twelve pounds a\r\nyear, but of course this varies with the individual tree and also with\r\nthe region. In some countries the whole year's yield is less than 200\r\npounds per acre, while there is on record a patch in Brazil which yields\r\nabout seventeen pounds to the tree, bringing the yield per acre much\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\nThe beans do not retain their vitality for planting for any considerable\r\nlength of time; and, if they are thoroughly dried, or are kept for\r\nlonger than three or four months, they are useless for that purpose. It\r\ntakes the seed about six weeks to germinate and to appear above ground.\r\nTrees raised from seed begin to blossom in about three years; but a good\r\ncrop can not be expected of them for the first five or six years. Their\r\nusefulness, save in exceptional cases, is ended in about thirty years.\r\n\r\nThe coffee tree can be propagated in a way other than by seeds. The\r\nupright branches can be used as slips, which, after taking root, will\r\nproduce seed-bearing laterals. The laterals themselves can not be used\r\nas slips. In Central America the natives sometimes use coffee uprights\r\nfor fences and it is no uncommon sight to see the fence posts \"growing.\"\r\n\r\nThe wood of the coffee tree is used also for cabinet work, as it is much\r\nstronger than many of the native woods, weighing about forty-three\r\npounds to the cubic foot, having a crushing strength of 5,800 pounds per\r\nsquare inch, and a breaking strength of 10,900 pounds per square inch.\r\n\r\nThe propagation of the coffee plant by cutting has two distinct\r\nadvantages over propagation by seed, in that it spares the expense of\r\nseed production, which is enormous, and it gives also a method of\r\nhybridization, which, if used, might lead not only to very interesting\r\nbut also to very profitable results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO-AND-ONE-HALF-YEAR-OLD C. CONGENSIS]\r\n\r\nThe hybridization of the coffee plant was taken up in a thoroughly\r\nscientific manner by the Dutch government at the experimental garden\r\nestablished at Bangelan, Java, in 1900. In his studies, twelve varieties\r\nof _Coffea arabica_ are recognized by Dr. P.J.S. Cramer[95], namely:\r\n\r\n     _Laurina_, a hybrid of _Coffea arabica_ with C. _mauritiana_,\r\n     having small narrow leaves, stiff, dense branches, young leaves\r\n     almost white, berry long and narrow, and beans narrow and oblong.\r\n\r\n     _Murta_, having small leaves, dense branches, beans as in the\r\n     typical _Coffea arabica_, and the plant able to stand bitter cold.\r\n\r\n     _Menosperma_, a distinct type, with narrow leaves and bent-down\r\n     branches resembling a willow, the berries seldom containing more\r\n     than one seed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HEAVY FLOWERING OF FIVE-YEAR-OLD COFFEA EXCELSA\r\n\r\nThis is a comparatively new species, discovered in the Tchad Lake\r\ndistrict of West Africa in 1905. It is a small-beaned variety of _Coffea\r\nliberica_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRANCHES OF COFFEA EXCELSA GROWN AT THE LAMAO EXPERIMENT\r\nSTATION, P.I.]\r\n\r\n     _Mokka_ (_Coffea Mokkæ_), having small leaves, dense foliage, small\r\n     round berries, small round beans resembling split peas, and\r\n     possessed of a stronger flavor than _Coffea arabica_.\r\n\r\n     _Purpurescens_, a red-leaved variety, comparable with the\r\n     red-leaved hazel and copper beech, a little less productive than\r\n     the _Coffea arabica_.\r\n\r\n     _Variegata_, having variegated leaves striped and spotted with\r\n     white.\r\n\r\n     _Amarella_, having yellow berries, comparable with the\r\n     white-fruited variety of the strawberry, raspberry, etc.\r\n\r\n     _Bullata_, having broad, curled leaves; stiff, thick, fragile\r\n     branches, and round, fleshy berries containing a high percentage of\r\n     empty beans.\r\n\r\n     _Angustifolia_, a narrow-leaved variety, with berries somewhat more\r\n     oblong and, like the foregoing, a poor producer.\r\n\r\n     _Erecta_, a variety that is sturdier than the typical _arabica_,\r\n     better suited to windy places, and having a production as in the\r\n     common _arabica_.\r\n\r\n     _Maragogipe_, a well-defined variety with light green leaves having\r\n     colored edges: berries large, broad, sometimes narrower in the\r\n     middle; a light bearer, the whole crop sometimes being reduced to a\r\n     couple of berries per tree.[96]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: C. STENOPHYLLA, FROM WHICH IS OBTAINED THE HIGHLAND\r\nCOFFEE OF SIERRA LEONE]\r\n\r\n     _Columnaris_, a vigorous variety, sometimes reaching a height of 25\r\n     feet, having leaves rounded at the base and rather broad, but a shy\r\n     bearer, recommended for dry climates.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffea Stenophylla_\r\n\r\n_Coffea arabica_ has a formidable rival in the species _stenophylla_.\r\nThe flavor of this variety is pronounced by some as surpassing that of\r\n_arabica_. The great disadvantage of this plant is the fact that it\r\nrequires so long a time before a yield of any value can be secured.\r\nAlthough the time required for the maturing of the crop is so long, when\r\nonce the plantation begins to yield, the crop is as large as that of\r\n_Coffea arabica_, and occasionally somewhat larger. The leaves are\r\nsmaller than any of the species described, and the flowers bear their\r\nparts in numbers varying from six to nine. The tree is a native of\r\nSierra Leone, where it grows wild.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Copyright, 1909, by The Tea and Coffee Trade Journal\r\n\r\nNEAR VIEW OF COFFEE BERRIES OF COFFEA ARABICA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffea Liberica_\r\n\r\nThe bean of _Coffea arabica_, although the principal bean used in\r\ncommerce, is not the only one; and it may not be out of place here to\r\ndescribe briefly some of the other varieties that are produced\r\ncommercially. _Coffea liberica_ is one of these plants. The quality of\r\nthe beverage made from its berries is inferior to that of _Coffea\r\narabica_, but the plant itself offers distinct advantages in its hardy\r\ngrowing qualities. This makes it attractive for hybridization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILD \"CAFFEIN-FREE\" COFFEE TREE\r\n\r\n_Mantsaka_ or _Café Sauvage_--Madagascar]\r\n\r\nThe _Coffea liberica_ tree is much larger and sturdier than the _Coffea\r\narabica_, and in its native haunts it reaches a height of 30 feet. It\r\nwill grow in a much more torrid climate and can stand exposure to strong\r\nsunlight. The leaves are about twice as long as those of _arabica_,\r\nbeing six to twelve inches in length, and are very thick, tough, and\r\nleathery. The apex of the leaf is acute. The flowers are larger than\r\nthose of _arabica_, and are borne in dense clusters. At any time during\r\nthe season, the same tree may bear flowers, white or pinkish, and\r\nfragrant, or even green, together with fruits, some green, some ripe and\r\nof a brilliant red. The corolla has been known to have seven segments,\r\nthough as a rule it has five. The fruits are large, round, and dull red;\r\nthe pulps are not juicy, and are somewhat bitter. Unlike _Coffea\r\narabica_, the ripened drupes do not fall from the trees, and so the\r\npicking can be delayed at the planter's convenience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIFFERENTIATING CHARACTERISTICS OF COFFEE BEANS, IN\r\nCROSS-SECTION\r\n\r\nCol. I. Mature bean. Col. II. Embryo.\r\n\r\n_A. Coffea arabica, R. Coffea robusta, L. Coffea liberica_]\r\n\r\nAmong the allied Liberian species Dr. Cramer recognizes:\r\n\r\n     _Abeokutæ_, having small leaves of a bright green, flower buds\r\n     often pink just before opening (in Liberian coffee never), fruit\r\n     smaller with sharply striped red and yellow shiny skin, and\r\n     producing somewhat smaller beans than Liberian coffee, but beans\r\n     whose flavor and taste are praised by brokers;\r\n\r\n     _Dewevrei_, having curled edged leaves, stiff branches,\r\n     thick-skinned berries, sometimes pink flowers, beans generally\r\n     smaller than in _C. liberica_, but of little interest to the trade;\r\n\r\n     _Arnoldiana_, a species near to _Coffea Abeokutæ_ having darker\r\n     foliage and the even colored small berries;\r\n\r\n     _Laurentii Gillet_, a species not to be confused with the _C.\r\n     Laurentii_ belonging to the _robusta_ coffee, but standing near to\r\n     _C. liberica_, characterized by oblong rather than thin-skinned\r\n     berries;\r\n\r\n     _Excelsa_, a vigorous, disease-resisting species discovered in 1905\r\n     by Aug. Chevalier in West Africa, in the region of the Chari River,\r\n     not far from Lake Tchad. The broad, dark-green leaves have an under\r\n     side of light green with a bluish tinge; the flowers are large and\r\n     white, borne in axillary clusters of one to five; the berries are\r\n     short and broad, in color crimson, the bean smaller than _robusta_,\r\n     very like _Mocha_, but in color a bright yellow like _liberica_.\r\n     The caffein content of the coffee is high, and the aroma is very\r\n     pronounced;\r\n\r\n     _Dybowskii_, another disease-resisting variety similar to\r\n     _excelsa_, but having different leaf and fruit characteristics;\r\n\r\n     _Lamboray_, having bent gutter-like leaves, and soft-skinned,\r\n     oblong fruit;\r\n\r\n     _Wanni Rukula_, having large leaves, a vigorous growth, and small\r\n     berries;\r\n\r\n     _Coffea aruwimensis_, being a mixture of different types.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEA ARABICA BERRIES GROWN IN THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS]\r\n\r\nThe last three types were received by Dr. Cramer at Bangelan from Frère\r\nGillet in the Belgian Congo, and were still under trial in Java in 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffea Robusta_\r\n\r\nEmil Laurent, in 1898, discovered a species of coffee growing wild in\r\nCongo. This was taken up by a horticultural firm of Brussels, and\r\ncultivated for the market. This firm gave to the coffee the name _Coffea\r\nrobusta_, although it had already been given the name of the discoverer,\r\nbeing known as _Coffea Laurentii_. The plant differs widely from both\r\n_arabica_ and _liberica_, being considerably larger than either. The\r\ntree is umbrella-shaped, due to the fact that its branches are very long\r\nand bend toward the ground.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of _robusta_ are much thinner than those of _liberica_,\r\nthough not as thin as those of _arabica_. The tree, as a whole, is a\r\nvery hardy variety and even bears blossoms when it is less than a year\r\nold. It blossoms throughout the entire year, the flowers having\r\nsix-parted corollas. The drupes are smaller than those of _liberica;_\r\nbut are much thinner skinned, so that the coffee bean is actually not\r\nany smaller. The drupes mature in ten months. Although the plants bear\r\nas early as the first year, the yield for the first two years is of no\r\naccount; but by the fourth year the crop is large.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBUSTA COFFEE IN FLOWER, PREANGER, JAVA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE ESTATE IN THE LUQUILLO MOUNTAINS, PORTO RICO]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAPANESE LABORERS PICKING COFFEE ON KONA SIDE, ISLAND OF\r\nHAWAII]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE UNDER THE STARS AND STRIPES]\r\n\r\nArno Viehoever, pharmacognosist in charge of the pharmacognosy\r\nlaboratory of the Bureau of Chemistry, United States Department of\r\nAgriculture, has recently announced findings confirming Hartwich which\r\nappear to permit of differentiation between _robusta, arabica_, and\r\n_liberica_.[97] These are mainly the peculiar folding of the endosperm,\r\nshowing quite generally a distinct hook in the case of the _robusta_\r\ncoffee bean. The size of the embryo, and especially the relation of the\r\nrootlet to hypercotyl, will be found useful in the differentiation of\r\nthe species _Coffea arabica, liberica_, and _robusta_ (see cut, page\r\n142).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE-YEAR-OLD ROBUSTA ESTATE, ON SUMATRA'S WEST COAST]\r\n\r\nViehoever and Lepper carried on a series of cup tests of _robusta_, the\r\nresults as to taste and flavor being distinctly favorable. They\r\nsummarized their studies and tests as follows:\r\n\r\n     The time when coffee could be limited to beans obtained from plants\r\n     of _Coffea arabica_ and _Coffea liberica_ has passed. Other\r\n     species, with qualities which make them desirable, even in\r\n     preference to the well reputed named ones, have been discovered and\r\n     cultivated. Among them, the species or group of _Coffea robusta_\r\n     has attained a great economic significance, and is grown in\r\n     increasing amounts. While it has, as reports seem to indicate, not\r\n     as yet been possible to obtain a strain that would be as desirable\r\n     in flavor as the old \"standard\" _Coffea_ _arabica_, well known as\r\n     Java or \"Fancy Java\" coffee, its merits have been established.\r\n\r\n     The botanical origin is not quite cleared up, and the\r\n     classification of the varieties belonging to the _robusta_ group\r\n     deserves further study. Anatomical means of differentiating\r\n     _robusta_ coffee from other species or groups, may be applied as\r\n     distinctly helpful....\r\n\r\n     As is usual in most of the coffee species, caffein is present. The\r\n     amount appears to be, on an average, somewhat larger (even\r\n     exceeding 2.0 percent) than in the South American coffee species.\r\n     In no instance, however, did the amount exceed the maximum limits\r\n     observed in coffee in general....\r\n\r\n     Due to its rapid growth, early and prolific yield, resistance to\r\n     coffee blight, and many other desirable qualities, _Coffea robusta_\r\n     has established \"its own\". In the writers' judgment, _robusta_\r\n     coffee deserves consideration and recognition.\r\n\r\nAmong the _robusta_ varieties, _Coffea canephora_ is a distinct species,\r\nwell characterized by growth, leaves, and berries. The branches are\r\nslender and thinner than _robusta_; the leaves are dark green and\r\nnarrower; the flowers are often tinged with red; the unripe berries are\r\npurple, the ripe berries bright red and oblong. The produce is like\r\n_robusta_, only the shape of the bean, somewhat narrower and more\r\noblong, makes it look more attractive. _Coffea canephora_, like _C.\r\nrobusta_, seems better fitted to higher altitudes.\r\n\r\nOther _canephora_ varieties include:\r\n\r\n_Madagascar_, having small, slightly striped, bright red berries and\r\nsmall round beans;\r\n\r\n_Quillouensis_, having dark green foliage and reddish brown young\r\nleaves; and,\r\n\r\n_Stenophylla Paris_, with purplish young berries.\r\n\r\nThese last two named were under test at the Bangelan gardens in 1919.\r\n\r\nAmong other allied _robusta_ species are:\r\n\r\n_Ugandæ_:, whose produce is said to possess a better flavor than\r\n_robusta_;\r\n\r\n_Bukobensis_, different from _Ugandæ_ in the color of its berries, which\r\nare a dark red; and\r\n\r\n_Quillou_, having bright red fruit, a copper-colored silver skin, three\r\npounds of fruit producing one pound of market coffee. Some people prefer\r\n_Quillou_ to _robusta_ because of the difference in the taste of the\r\nroasted bean.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some Interesting Hybrids_\r\n\r\nThe most popular hybrid belongs to a crossing of _liberica_ and\r\n_arabica_. Cramer states that the beans of this hybrid make an excellent\r\ncoffee combining the strong taste of the _liberica_ with the fine flavor\r\nof the old Government Java _(arabica_), adding:\r\n\r\n     The hybrids are not only of value to the roaster, but also to the\r\n     planter. They are vigorous trees, practically free from leaf\r\n     disease; they stand drought well and also heavy rains; they are not\r\n     particular in regard to shade and upkeep; never fail to give a fair\r\n     and often a rather heavy crop. The fruit ripens all the year\r\n     around, and does not fall so easily as in the case of _arabica_.\r\n\r\nAmong other hybrids (many were still under trial in 1919) may be\r\nmentioned: _Coffea excelsia x liberica_; _C. Abeokutæ x liberica_; _C.\r\nDybowskii x excelsa_; _C. stenophylla x Abeokutæ_; _C. congensis x\r\nUgandæ_; _C. Ugandæ x congensis_; and _C. robusta x Maragogipe_.\r\n\r\nThere are many species of _Coffea_ that stand quite apart from the main\r\ngroups, _arabica, robusta_ and _liberica_; but while some are of\r\ncommercial value, most of them are interesting only from the scientific\r\npoint of view. Among the latter may be mentioned: _Coffea bengalensis_,\r\n_C. Perieri_, _C. mauritiana_, _C. macrocarpa_, _C. madagascariensis_,\r\nand _C. schumanniana_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEA QUILLOU FLOWERS IN FULL BLOOM]\r\n\r\nM. Teyssonnier, of the experimental garden at Camayenne, French Guinea,\r\nWest Africa, has produced a promising species of coffee known as\r\n_affinis_. It is a hybrid of _C. stenophylla_ with a species of\r\n_liberica_.\r\n\r\nAmong other promising species recognized by Dr. Cramer are:\r\n\r\n_Coffea congensis_, whose berry resembles that of _C. arabica_, when\r\nwell prepared for the market being green or bluish; and\r\n\r\n_Coffea congensis var. Chalotii_, probably a hybrid of _C. congensis_\r\nwith _C. canephora_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caffein-free Coffee_\r\n\r\nCertain trees growing wild in the Comoro Islands and Madagascar are\r\nknown as caffein-free coffee trees. Just whether they are entitled to\r\nthis classification or not is a question. Some of the French and German\r\ninvestigators have reported coffee from these regions that was\r\nabsolutely devoid of caffein. It was thought at first that they must\r\nrepresent an entirely new genus; but upon investigation, it was found\r\nthat they belonged to the genus _Coffea_, to which all our common\r\ncoffees belong. Professor Dubard, of the French National Museum and\r\nColonial Garden, studied these trees botanically and classified them as\r\n_C. Gallienii_, _C. Bonnieri_, _C. Mogeneti_, and _C. Augagneuri_. The\r\nbeans of berries from these trees were analyzed by Professor Bertrand\r\nand pronounced caffein-free; but Labroy, in writing of the same coffee,\r\nstates that, while the bean is caffein-free, it contains a very bitter\r\nsubstance, cafamarine, which makes the infusion unfit for use. Dr. O.W.\r\nWillcox[98], in examining some specimens of wild coffee from Madagascar,\r\nfound that the bean was not caffein-free; and though the caffein content\r\nwas low, it was no lower than in some of the Porto Rican varieties.\r\n\r\nHartwich[99] reports that Hanausek found no caffein in _C. mauritiana_,\r\n_C. humboltiana_, _C. Gallienii_, _C. Bonnerii_, and _C. Mogeneti_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fungoid Disease of Coffee_\r\n\r\nThe coffee tree, like every other living thing, has specific diseases\r\nand enemies, the most common of which are certain fungoid diseases where\r\nthe mycelium of the fungus grows into the tissue and spots the leaves,\r\neventually causing them to fall, thus robbing the plant of its only\r\nmeans of elaborating food. Its most deadly enemy in the insect world is\r\na small insect of the lepidopterous variety, which is known as the\r\ncoffee-leaf miner. It is closely related to the clothes moth and, like\r\nthe moth, bores in its larval stage, feeding on the mesophyl of the\r\nleaves. This gives the leaves an appearance of being shriveled or dried\r\nby heat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EIGHTEEN-MONTHS'-OLD COFFEA QUILLOU TREE IN BLOSSOM]\r\n\r\nThere are three principal diseases, due to fungi, from which the coffee\r\nplants suffer. The most common is known as the leaf-blight fungus,\r\n_Pellicularia tokeroga_, which is a slow-spreading disease, but one that\r\ncauses great loss. Although the fungus does not produce spores, the\r\nleaves die and dry, and are blown away, carrying with them the dried\r\nmycelium of the fungus. This mycelium will start to grow as soon as it\r\nis supplied with a new moist coffee leaf to nourish it. The method of\r\ngetting rid of this disease is to spray the trees in seasons of drought.\r\n\r\nIt was a fungoid disease known as the _Hemileia vastatrix_ that attacked\r\nCeylon's coffee industry in 1869, and eventually destroyed it. It is a\r\nmicroscopic fungus whose spores, carried by the wind, adhere to and\r\ngerminate upon the leaves of the coffee tree[100].\r\n\r\nAnother common disease is known as the root disease, which eventually\r\nkills the tree by girdling it below the soil. It spreads slowly, but\r\nseems to be favored by collections of decaying matter around the base of\r\nthe tree. Sometimes the digging of ditches around the roots is\r\nsufficient to protect it. The other common disease is due to _Stilbium\r\nflavidum_, and is found only in regions of great humidity. It affects\r\nboth the leaf and the fruit and is known as the spot of leaf and fruit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEA UGANDÆ BENT OVER BY A HEAVY CROP]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE MICROSCOPY OF THE COFFEE FRUIT\r\n\r\n     _How the beans may be examined under the microscope, and what is\r\n     revealed--Structure of the berry, the green, and the roasted\r\n     bean--The coffee leaf disease under the microscope--Value of\r\n     microscopic analysis in detecting adulteration_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe microscopy of coffee is, on the whole, more important to the planter\r\nthan to the consumer and the dealer; while, on the other hand, the\r\nmicroscopy is of paramount importance to the consumer and the dealer as\r\nfurnishing the best means of determining whether the product offered is\r\nadulterated or not. Also, from this standpoint, the microscopy of the\r\nplant is less important than that of the bean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 331. Coffee (_Coffea arabica_). I--Cross-section of\r\nberry, natural size; _Pk_, outer pericarp; _Mk_, endocarp; _Ek_,\r\nspermoderm; _Sa_, hard endosperm; Sp, soft endosperm.

(Tschirch and Oesterle.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Fruit and the Bean_\r\n\r\nThe fruit, as stated in chapter XV, consists of two parts, each one\r\ncontaining a single seed, or bean. These beans are flattened laterally,\r\nso as to fit together, except in the following instances: in the\r\npeaberry, where one of the ovules never develops, the single ovule,\r\nhaving no pressure upon it, is spherical; in the rare instances where\r\nthree seeds are found, the grains are angular.\r\n\r\nThe coffee bean with which the consumer is familiar is only a small part\r\nof the fruit. The fruit, which is the size of a small cherry, has, like\r\nthe cherry, an outer fleshy portion called the pericarp. Beneath this is\r\na part like tissue paper, spoken of technically as the parchment, but\r\nknown scientifically as the endocarp. Next in position to this, and\r\ncovering the seed, is the so-called spermoderm, which means the seed\r\nskin, referred to in the trade as the silver skin. Small portions of\r\nthis silver skin are always to be found in the cleft of the coffee bean.\r\n\r\nThe coffee bean is the embryo and its food supply; the embryo is that\r\npart of the seed which, when supplied with food and moisture, develops\r\ninto a new plant. The embryo of the coffee is very minute (Fig. 331,\r\nII, _Em_)[101]; and the greater part of the seed is taken up by the food\r\nsupply, consisting of hard and soft endosperm (Fig. 331, I and II, _Sa_,\r\n_Sp_). The minute embryo consists of two small thick leaves, the\r\ncotyledons (Fig. 331, III, _cot_), a short stem, invisible in the\r\nundissected embryo, and a small root, the radicle (Fig. 331, III,\r\n_rad_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 332. Coffee. Cross section of bean showing folded\r\nendosperm with hard and soft tissues. x6. (Moeller)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fruit Structure_\r\n\r\nIn order to examine the structure of these layers of the fruit under the\r\nmicroscope, it is necessary to use the pericarp dry, as it is not easily\r\nobtainable in its natural condition. If desired, an alcoholic specimen\r\nmay be used, but it has been found that the dry method gives more\r\nsatisfactory results. The dried pericarp is about 0.5 mm thick. Great\r\ndifficulty is experienced in cutting microtome sections of pericarp when\r\nthe specimen is embedded in paraffin, because the outer layers are soft\r\nand the endocarp is hard, and the two parts of the section separate at\r\nthis point. To overcome this, the sections might also be embedded in\r\ncelloidin. When the sections are satisfactory, they may be stained with\r\nany of the double stains ordinarily used in the study of plant\r\nhistology.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 333. Coffee. Cross section of hull and bean.\r\nPericarp consists of: 1, epicarp; 2-3, layers of mesocarp, with 4,\r\nfibro-vascular bundle; 5, palisade layer; and 6, endocarp; _ss_,\r\nspermoderm, consists of 8, sclerenchyma, and 9, parenchyma; _End_,\r\nendosperm (Tschirch and Oesterle)]\r\n\r\nA section cut crosswise through the entire fruit would present the\r\nappearance shown in Fig. 333. The cells of the epicarp are broad and\r\npolygonal, sometimes regularly four-sided, about 15-35 µ broad. At\r\nintervals along the surface of the epicarp are stomata, or breathing\r\npores, surrounded by guard cells. The next layer of the pericarp is the\r\nmesocarp (Figs. 333, 334, 335), the cells of which are larger and more\r\nregular in outline than the epicarp. The cells of the mesocarp become as\r\nlarge as 100 µ broad, but in the inner parts of the layer they become\r\nvery much flattened. Fibrovascular bundles are scattered through the\r\ncompressed cells of the mesocarp. The cell walls are thick; and large,\r\namorphous, brown masses are found within the cell; occasionally, large\r\ncrystals are found in the outer part of the layer. The fibro-vascular\r\nbundles consist mainly of bast and wood fibers and vessels. The bast\r\nfibers are as large as 1 mm long and 25 µ broad, with thick walls and\r\nvery small _lumina_. Spiral and pitted vessels are also present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 334. Coffee. Surface view of _ep_, epicarp, and _p_,\r\nouter parenchyma of mesocarp. x160. (Moeller)]\r\n\r\nThe layer next to this is a soft tissue, parenchyma (Fig. 333, 5; Fig.\r\n334, _p_). The parenchyma, or palisade cells as they are called, is a\r\nthin-walled tissue in which the cells are elongated, from which fact\r\nthey receive their name. The walls of these cells, though very thin, are\r\nmucilaginous, and capable of taking up large amounts of water. They\r\nstain well with the aniline stains.\r\n\r\nThe endocarp (Fig. 336) is closely connected with the palisade layer and\r\nhas thin-walled cells that closely resemble, in all respects, the\r\nendocarp of the apple. The outer layer consists of thick-walled fibers,\r\nwhich are remarkably porous (Fig. 333, 6; Fig. 336) while the fibers of\r\nthe inner layer are thin-walled and run in the transverse direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Bean Structure_\r\n\r\nSpermoderm, or silver skin, is not difficult to secure for microscopic\r\nanalysis; because shreds of it remain in the groove of the berry, and\r\nthese shreds are ample for examination. It can readily be removed\r\nwithout tearing, if soaked in water for a few hours. The spermoderm is\r\nthin enough not to need sectioning. It consists of two\r\nelements--sclerenchyma and parenchyma cells. (Figs. 333, 337, _st_,\r\n_p_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 335. Coffee. Elements of pericarp in surface view.\r\n_p_, parenchyma; _bp_, parenchyma of fibro-vascular bundle; _b_, bast\r\nfiber; _sp_, spiral vessel. x160. (Moeller)]\r\n\r\nSclerenchyma forms an uninterrupted covering in the early stages of the\r\nseed; but as the seed develops, surrounding tissues grow more rapidly\r\nthan the sclerenchyma, and the cells are pushed apart and scattered. The\r\ncells occurring in the cleft of the berry are straight, narrow, and\r\nlong, becoming as long as 1 mm, and resemble bast fibers somewhat. On\r\nthe surface of the berry, and sometimes in the cleft, there are found\r\nsmaller, thicker cells, which are irregular in outline, club-shaped and\r\nvermiform types predominating.\r\n\r\nParenchyma cells form the remainder of the spermoderm; and these are\r\npartially obliterated, so that the structure is not easily seen,\r\nappearing almost like a solid membrane. The raphe runs through the\r\nparenchyma found in the cleft of the berry.\r\n\r\nThe endosperm (Figs. 333; 338) consist of small cells in the outer part,\r\nand large cells, frequently as thick as 100 µ, in the inner part. The\r\ncell walls are thickened and knotted. Certain of the inner cells have\r\nmucilaginous walls which when treated with water disappear, leaving only\r\nthe middle lamellae, which gives the section a peculiar appearance. The\r\ncells contain no starch, the reserve food supply being stored cellulose,\r\nprotein, and aleurone grains. Various investigators report the presence\r\nof sugar, tannin, iron, salts, and caffein.\r\n\r\nThe embryo (Fig. 331, III) may be obtained by soaking the bean in water\r\nfor several hours, cutting through the cleft and carefully breaking\r\napart the endosperm. If it is now soaked in diluted alkali, the embryo\r\nprotrudes through the lower end of the endosperm. It is then cleared in\r\nalkali, or in chloral hydrate. The cotyledons shown have three pairs of\r\nveins, which are slightly netted. The radicle is blunt and is about 3/4\r\nmm in length, while the cotyledons are 1/2 mm long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 336. Coffee.

As it\r\nhas since been found in nearly all coffee-producing countries, it has\r\nbecome a nightmare in the dreams of all coffee planters. The microscope\r\nshows how the spores of this dreaded fungus, carried by the winds upon a\r\nleaf of the coffee tree, proceed to germinate at the expense of the\r\nleaf; robbing it of its nourishment, and causing it to droop and to die.\r\nA mixture of powdered lime and sulphur has been found to be an effective\r\ngermicide, if used in time and diligently applied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 337.

In many instances the chemical\r\nanalysis fails to get at the root of the trouble, and then the only\r\nmethod to which the tester has recourse is the examination of the\r\nsuspected material under the scope. The mixing of chicory with coffee\r\nhas in the past been one of the commonest forms of adulteration. The\r\nmicroscopic examination in this connection is the most reliable. The\r\ncoffee grain will have the appearance already described.\r\nMicroscopically, chicory shows numerous thin-walled parenchymatous\r\ncells, lactiferous vessels, and sieve tubes with transverse plates.\r\nThere are also present large vessels with huge, well-defined pits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE LEAF DISEASE (HEMILEIA VASTATRIX)\r\n\r\n1. under surface of affected leaf, x 1/2; 2, section through same\r\nshowing mycelium, haustoria, and a spore-cluster; 3, a spore-cluster\r\nseen from below; 4, a uredospore; 5, germinating uredospore; 6,\r\nappressorial swellings at tips of germ-tubes; 7, infection through stoma\r\nof leaf; 8, teleutospores; 9, teleutospore germinating with promycelium\r\nand sporidia; 10, sporidia and their germination (2 after Zimmermann, 3\r\nafter Delacroix, 4-10 after Ward)]\r\n\r\nRoasted date stones have been used as adulterants, and these can be\r\ndetected quite readily with the aid of the microscope, as they have a\r\nvery characteristic microscopic appearance. The epidermal cells are\r\nalmost oblong, while the parenchymatous cells are large, irregular and\r\ncontain large quantities of tannin.\r\n\r\nAdulteration and adulterants are considered more fully in chapter XVII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREEN AND ROASTED COFFEE UNDER THE MICROSCOPE\r\n\r\nGreen bean, showing the size and form of the cells as well as the drops\r\nof oil contained within their cavities.

Trigg\r\n\r\nIndustrial Fellow of the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research,\r\nPittsburgh, 1916-1920\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the vast extent of the coffee business is considered, together with\r\nthe intimate connection which coffee has with the daily life of the\r\naverage human, the relatively small amount of accurate knowledge which\r\nwe possess regarding the chemical constituents and the physiological\r\naction of coffee is productive of amazement.\r\n\r\nTrue, a painstaking compilation of all the scientific and\r\nsemi-scientific work done upon coffee furnishes quite a compendium of\r\ndata, the value of which is not commensurate with its quantity, because\r\nof the spasmodic nature of the investigations and the non-conclusive\r\ncharacter of the results so far obtained. The following general survey\r\nof the field argues in favor of the promulgation of well-ordered and\r\nsystematic research, of the type now in progress at several places in\r\nthe United States, into the chemical behavior of coffee throughout the\r\nvarious processes to which it is subjected in the course of its\r\npreparation for human consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Green Coffee_\r\n\r\nOne of the few chemical investigations of the growing tree is the\r\nexamination by Graf of flowers from 20-year-old coffee trees, in which\r\nhe found 0.9 percent caffein, a reducing sugar, caffetannic acid, and\r\nphytosterol. Power and Chestnut[102] found 0.82 percent caffein in\r\nair-dried coffee leaves, but only 0.087 percent of the alkaloid in the\r\nstems of the plant separated from the leaves. In the course of a\r\nstudy[103] instituted for the purpose of determining the best\r\nfertilizers for coffee trees, it developed that the cherries in\r\ndifferent stages of growth show a preponderance of potash throughout,\r\nwhile the proportion of P_2_O_5 attains a maximum in the fourth month\r\nand then steadily declines.\r\n\r\nExperiments are still in progress to ascertain the precise mineral\r\nrequirements of the crop as well as the most suitable stage at which to\r\napply them. During the first five months the moisture content undergoes\r\na steady decrease, from 87.13 percent to 65.77 percent, but during the\r\nfinal ripening stage in the last month there is a rise of nearly 1\r\npercent. This may explain the premature falling and failure to ripen of\r\nthe crop on certain soils, especially in years of low rainfall.\r\nMalnutrition of the trees may result also in the production of oily\r\nbeans.[104]\r\n\r\nThe coffee berry comprises about 68 percent pulp, 6 percent parchment,\r\nand 26 percent clean coffee beans. The pulp is easily removed by\r\nmechanical means; but in order to separate the soft, glutinous,\r\nsaccharine parchment, it is necessary to resort to fermentation, which\r\nloosens the skin so that it may be removed easily, after which the\r\ncoffee is properly dried and aged. There is first a yeast fermentation\r\nproducing alcohol; and then a bacterial action giving mainly inactive\r\nlactic acid, which is the main factor in loosening the parchment. For\r\nthe production of the best coffee, acetic acid fermentation (which\r\nchanges the color of the bean) and temperature above 60° should be\r\navoided, as these inhibit subsequent enzymatic action.[105]\r\n\r\nVarious schemes have been proposed for utilizing the large amount of\r\npulp so obtained in preparing coffee for market. Most of these depend\r\nupon using the pulp as fertilizer, since fresh pulp contains 2.61\r\npercent nitrogen, 0.81 percent P_2_O_5, 2.38 percent potassium, and\r\n0.57 percent calcium. One procedure[106] in particular is to mix pulp\r\nwith sawdust, urine, and a little lime, and then to leave this mixture\r\ncovered in a pit for a year before using. In addition to these mineral\r\nmatters, the pulp also contains about 0.88 percent of caffein and 18 to\r\n37 percent sugars. Accordingly, it has been proposed[107] to extract the\r\ncaffein with chloroform, and the sugars with acidulated water. The\r\naqueous solution so obtained is then fermented to alcohol. The insoluble\r\nportion left after extraction can be used as fuel, and the resulting ash\r\nas fertilizer.\r\n\r\nThe pulp has been dried and roasted for use in place of the berry, and\r\nhas been imported to England for this purpose. It is stated that the\r\nArabs in the vicinity of Jiddah discard the kernel of the coffee berries\r\nand make an infusion of the husk.[108]\r\n\r\nQuality of green coffee is largely dependent upon the methods used and\r\nthe care taken in curing it, and upon the conditions obtaining in\r\nshipment and storage. True, the soil and climatic conditions play a\r\ndeterminative rôle in the creation of the characteristics of coffee, but\r\nthese do not offer any greater opportunity for constructive research and\r\nremunerative improvement than does the development of methods and\r\ncontrol in the processes employed in the preparation of green coffee for\r\nthe market.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSS-SECTION OF THE ENDOSPERM OR HARD STRUCTURE OF THE\r\nGREEN BEAN]\r\n\r\nStorage prior and subsequent to shipment, and circumstances existing\r\nduring transportation, are not to be disregarded as factors contributory\r\nto the final quality of the coffee. The sweating of mules carrying bags\r\nof poorly packed coffee, and the absorption of strong foreign aromas and\r\nflavors from odoriferous substances stored in too close proximity to the\r\ncoffee beans, are classic examples of damage that bear iterative\r\nmention. Damage by sea water, due more to the excessive moisture than to\r\nthe salt, is not so common an occurrence now as heretofore. However, a\r\ncheap and thoroughly effective means of ethically renovating coffee\r\nwhich has been damaged in this manner would not go begging for\r\ncommercial application.\r\n\r\nThat green coffee improves with age, is a tenet generally accepted by\r\nthe trade. Shipments long in transit, subjected to the effects of\r\ntropical heat under closely battened hatches in poorly ventilated holds,\r\nhave developed into much-prized yellow matured coffee. Were it not for\r\nthe large capital required and the attendant prohibitive carrying\r\ncharges, many roasters would permit their coffees to age more thoroughly\r\nbefore roasting. In fact, some roasters do indulge this desire in regard\r\nto a portion of their stock. But were it feasible to treat and hold\r\ncoffees long enough to develop their attributes to a maximum, still the\r\nexact conditions which would favor such development are not definitely\r\nknown. What are the optimum temperature and the correct humidity to\r\nmaintain, and should the green coffee be well ventilated or not while in\r\nstorage? How long should coffee be stored under the most favorable\r\nconditions best to develop it? Aging for too long a period will develop\r\nflavor at the expense of body; and the general cup efficiency of some\r\ncoffees will suffer if they be kept too long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTION OF THE INVESTING MEMBRANE, SHOWING ITS STRUCTURE\r\n\r\nDrawn with the camera lucida, and magnified 140 diameters]\r\n\r\nThe exact reason for improvement upon aging is in no wise certain, but\r\nit is highly probable that the changes ensuing are somewhat analogous to\r\nthose occurring in the aging of grain. Primarily an undefined enzymatic\r\nand mold action most likely occurs, the nature of the enzymes and molds\r\nbeing largely dependent upon the previous treatment of the coffee. Along\r\nwith this are a loss of moisture and an oxidation, all three actions\r\nhaving more evident effects with the passage of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Artificial Aging_\r\n\r\nIn consideration of the higher prices which aged products demand,\r\nattempts have naturally been made to shorten by artificial means the\r\ntime necessary for their natural production. Some of these methods\r\ndepend upon obtaining the most favorable conditions for acceleration of\r\nthe enzyme action; others, upon the effects of micro-organisms; and\r\nstill others, upon direct chemical reaction or physical alteration of\r\nthe green bean.\r\n\r\nOne of the first efforts toward artificial maturing was that of\r\nAshcroft[109], who argued from the improved nature of coffee which had\r\nexperienced a delayed voyage. His method consisted of inclosing the\r\ncoffee in sweat-boxes having perforated bottoms and subjecting it to the\r\nsweating action of steam, the boxes being enclosed in an oven or room\r\nmaintained at the temperature of steam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STRUCTURE OF THE GREEN BEAN\r\n\r\nShowing thick-walled cells enclosing drops of oil]\r\n\r\nTimby[110] claimed to remove dusts, foreign odors, and impurities, while\r\nattaining in a few hours or days a ripening effect normally secured only\r\nin several seasons. In this process, the bagged coffee is placed in\r\nautoclaves and subjected to the action of air at a pressure of 2 to 3\r\natmospheres and a temperature of 40° to 100° F. The temperature should\r\nseldom be allowed to rise above 150° F. The pressure is then allowed to\r\nescape and a partial vacuum created in the apparatus. This alteration of\r\npressure and vacuum is continued until the desired maturation is\r\nobtained. Desvignes[111] employs a similar procedure, although he\r\naccomplishes seasoning by treating the coffee also with oxygen or\r\nozone.[112] First the coffee is rendered porous by storage in a hot\r\nchamber, which is then exhausted prior to admission of the oxygen. The\r\noxygen can be ozonized in the closed vessel while in contact with the\r\ncoffee. Complete aging in a few days is claimed.\r\n\r\nWeitzmann[113] adopts a novel operation, by exposing bags of raw coffee\r\nto the action of a powerful magnetic field, obtained with two adjustable\r\nelectro-magnets. The claim that a maturation naturally produced in\r\nseveral years is thus obtained in 1/2 to 2 hours is open to considerable\r\ndoubt. A process that is probably attended with more commercial success\r\nis that of Gram[114] in which the coffee is treated with gaseous\r\nnitrogen dioxid.\r\n\r\nBy far the most notable progress in this field, both scientifically and\r\ncommercially, has been made by Robison[115] with his \"culturing\" method.\r\nHere the green coffee is washed with water, and then inoculated with\r\nselected strains of micro-organisms, such as _Ochraeceus_ or\r\n_Aspergillus Wintii_. Incubation is then conducted for 6 to 7 days at\r\n90° F. and 85 percent relative humidity. Subsequent to this incubation,\r\nthe coffee is stored in bins for about ten days; after which it is\r\ntumbled and scoured. With this process it is possible to improve the\r\ncupping qualities of a coffee to a surprising degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Renovating Damaged Coffees_\r\n\r\nSophistication has often been resorted to in order ostensibly to improve\r\ndamaged or cheap coffee. Glazing, coloring, and polishing of the green\r\nbeans was openly and covertly practised until restricted by law. The\r\nsteps employed did not actually improve the coffee by any means, but\r\nmerely put it into condition for more ready sale. An apparently sincere\r\nendeavor to renovate damaged coffee was made by Evans[116] when he\r\ntreated it with an aqueous solution of sulphuric acid having a density\r\nof 10.5° Baumé. After agitation in this solution, the beans were washed\r\nfree from acid and dried. In this manner discolorations and impurities\r\nwere removed and the beans given a fuller appearance.\r\n\r\nThe addition of glucose, sucrose, lactose, or dextrin to green coffees\r\nis practised by von Niessen[117] and by Winter[118], with the object of\r\ngiving a mild taste and strong aroma to \"hard\" coffees. The addition is\r\naccomplished by impregnating, with or without the aid of vacuum, the\r\nbeans with a moderately concentrated solution of the sugar, the liquid\r\nbeing of insufficient quantity to effect extraction. When the solution\r\nhas completely disseminated through the kernels, they are removed and\r\ndried. Upon subsequent roasting, a decided amelioration of flavor is\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nAnother method developed by von Niessen[119] comprises the softening of\r\nthe outer layers of the beans by steam, cold or warm water, or brine,\r\nand then surrounding them with an absorbent paste or powder, such as\r\nchina clay, to which a neutralizing agent such as magnesium oxid may be\r\nadded. After drying, the clay can be removed by brushing or by causing\r\nthe beans to travel between oppositely reciprocated wet cloths. In the\r\ndevelopment of this process, von Niessen evidently argued that the\r\nso-called \"caffetannic acid\" is the \"harmful\" substance in coffee, and\r\nthat it is concentrated in the outer layers of the coffee beans. If\r\nthese be his precepts, the question of their correctness and of the\r\nefficiency of his process becomes a moot one.\r\n\r\nA procedure which aims at cleaning and refining raw coffee, and which\r\nhas been the subject of much polemical discussion, is that of Thum[120].\r\nIt entails the placing of the green beans in a perforated drum; just\r\ncovering them with water, or a solution of sodium chloride or sodium\r\ncarbonate, at 65° to 70° C.; and subjecting them to a vigorous brushing\r\nfor from 1 to 5 minutes, according to the grade of coffee being treated.\r\nThe value of this method is somewhat doubtful, as it would not seem to\r\naccomplish any more than simple washing. In fact, if anything, the\r\nprocess is undesirable; as some of the extractive matters present in the\r\ncoffee, and particularly caffein, will be lost. Both Freund[121] and\r\nHarnack[122] hold briefs for the product produced by this method, and\r\nthe latter endeavors analytically to prove its merits; but as his\r\nexperimental data are questionable, his conclusions do not carry much\r\nweight.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Acids of Coffee_\r\n\r\nThe study of the acids of coffee has been productive of much controversy\r\nand many contradictory results, few of which possess any value. The acid\r\nof coffee is generally spoken of as \"caffetannic acid.\" Quite a few\r\nattempts have been made to determine the composition and structure of\r\nthis compound and to assign it a formula. Among them may be noted those\r\nof Allen,[123] who gives it the empirical formula C_14_H_16_O_7;\r\nHlasiwetz,[124] who represents it as C_15_H_18_O_8; Richter, as\r\nC_30_H_18_O_16; Griebel,[125] as C_18_H_24_O_10, and Cazeneuve\r\nand Haddon,[126] as C_21_H_28_O_14. It is variously supposed to\r\nexist in coffee as the potassium, calcium, or magnesium salt. In regard\r\nto the physical appearance of the isolated substance there is also some\r\ndoubt, Thorpe[127] describing it as an amorphous powder, and Howard[128]\r\nas a brownish, syrup-like mass, having a slight acid and astringent\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nThe chemical reactions of \"caffetannic acid\" are generally agreed upon.\r\nA dark green coloration is given with ferric chloride; and upon boiling\r\nit with alkalies or dilute acids, caffeic acid and glucose are formed.\r\nFusion with alkali produces protocatechuic acid.\r\n\r\nK. Gorter[129] has made an extensive and accurate investigation into the\r\nmatter, and in reporting upon the same has made some very pertinent\r\nobservations. His claim is that the name \"caffetannic acid\" is a\r\nmisnomer and should be abandoned. The so-called \"caffetannic acid\" is\r\nreally a mixture which has among its constituents chlorogenic acid\r\n(C_32_H_38_O_19), which is not a tannic acid, and coffalic acid.\r\nTatlock and Thompson[130] have expressed the opinion that roasted coffee\r\ncontains no tannin, and that the lead precipitate contains mostly\r\ncoloring matter. They found only 4.5 percent of tannin (precipitable by\r\ngelatin or alkaloids) in raw coffee.\r\n\r\nHanausek[131] demonstrated the presence of oxalic acid in unripe beans,\r\nand citric acid has been isolated from Liberian coffee. It also has been\r\nclaimed that viridic acid, C_14_H_20_O_11, is present in coffee. In\r\naddition to these, the fat of coffee contains a certain percentage of\r\nfree fatty acids.\r\n\r\nIt is thus apparent that even in green coffee there is no definite\r\ncompound \"caffetannic acid,\" and there is even less likelihood of its\r\nbeing present in roasted coffee. The conditions, high heat and\r\noxidation, to which coffee is subjected in roasting would suffice to\r\ndecompose this hypothetical acid if it were present.\r\n\r\nIn the method of analysis for caffetannic acid (No. 24) given at the end\r\nof this chapter, there are many chances of error, although this\r\nprocedure is the best yet devised. Lead acetate forms three different\r\ncompounds with \"caffetannic acid,\" so that this reagent must be added\r\nwith extreme care in order to precipitate the compound desired. The\r\nprecipitate, upon forming, mechanically carries down with it any fats\r\nwhich may be present, and which are removed from it only with\r\ndifficulty. The majority of the mineral salts in the solution will come\r\ndown simultaneously. All of the above-mentioned organic acids form\r\ninsoluble salts with lead acetate, and there will also be a tendency\r\ntoward precipitation of certain of the components of caramel, the acidic\r\npolymerization products of acrolein, glycerol, etc., and of the proteins\r\nand their decomposition products.\r\n\r\nIn view of this condition of uncertainty in composition, necessity for\r\ngreat care in manipulation, and ever-present danger of contamination,\r\nthe significance of \"caffetannic acid analysis\" fades. It is highly\r\ndesirable that the nomenclature relevant to this analytical procedure be\r\nchanged to one, such as \"lead number,\" which will be more truly\r\nindicative of its significance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Alkaloids of Coffee_\r\n\r\nIn addition to caffein, the main alkaloid of coffee, trigonellin--the\r\nmethylbetaine of nicotinic acid--sometimes known as caffearine, has been\r\nisolated from coffee.[132] This alkaloid, having the formula\r\nC_14_H_16_O_4_N_2, is also found in fenugreek, _Trigonella\r\nfoenum-græcum_, in various leguminous plants, and in the seeds of\r\nstrophanthus. When pure it forms colorless needles melting at 140° C.,\r\nand, as with all alkaloids, gives a weak basic reaction. It is very\r\nsoluble in water, slightly soluble in alcohol, and only very slightly\r\nsoluble in ether, chloroform or benzol, so that it does not contaminate\r\nthe caffein in the determination of the latter. Its effects on the body\r\nhave not been studied, but they are probably not very great, as\r\nPolstorff obtained only 0.23 percent from the coffee which he examined.\r\n\r\nCaffein, thein, trimethylxanthin, or C_5_H(CH_3)_3_N_4_O_2, in\r\naddition to being in the coffee bean is also found in guarana leaves,\r\nthe kola nut, maté, or Paraguay tea, and, in small quantities, in cocoa.\r\nIt is also found in other parts of these plants besides those commonly\r\nused for food purposes.\r\n\r\nA neat test for detecting the presence of caffein is that of A.\r\nViehoever,[133] in which the caffein is sublimed directly from the plant\r\ntissue in a special apparatus. The presence of caffein in the sublimate\r\nis verified by observing its melting point, determined on a special\r\nheating stage used in connection with a microscope.\r\n\r\nThe chief commercial source of this alkaloid is waste and damaged tea,\r\nfrom which it is prepared by extraction with boiling water, the tannin\r\nprecipitated from the solution with litharge, and the solution then\r\nconcentrated to crystallize out the caffein. It is further purified by\r\nsublimation or recrystallization from water. Coffee chaff and\r\nroaster-flue dust have been proposed as sources for medicinal caffein,\r\nbut the extraction of the alkaloid from the former has not proven to be\r\na commercial success. Several manufacturers of pharmaceuticals are now\r\nextracting caffein from roaster-flue dust, probably by an adaptation of\r\nthe Faunce[134] process. The recovery of caffein from roaster-flue gases\r\nmay be facilitated and increased by the use of a condenser such as\r\nproposed Ewé.[135]\r\n\r\nPure caffein forms long, white, silky, flexible needles, which readily\r\nfelt together to form light, fleecy masses. It melts at 235-7° C. and\r\nsublimes completely at 178° C., though the sublimation starts at 120°.\r\nSalts of an unstable nature are formed with caffein by most acids.

The presence and position of the methyl groups\r\n(CH_3) in caffein is probably the controlling factor which makes its\r\naction differ from the behavior of other members of the series. The\r\nstructure of these compounds was established, and their syntheses\r\naccomplished, in the course of various classic researches by Emil\r\nFischer.[137]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORMULA FOR CAFFEIN, SHOWING ITS RELATION TO THE PURIN\r\nGROUP]\r\n\r\nGorter states that caffein exists in coffee in combination with\r\nchlorogenic acid as a potassium chlorogenate, C_32_H_36_O_19,\r\nK_2(C_8_H_10_O_2_N_4)_2·2H_2_O, which he isolated in colorless\r\nprisms. This compound is water-soluble, but caffein can not be extracted\r\nfrom the crystals with anhydrous solvents. To this behavior can probably\r\nbe attributed the difficulty experienced in extracting caffein from\r\ncoffee with dry organic solvents. However, the fact that a small\r\npercentage can be extracted from the green bean in this manner indicates\r\nthat some of the caffein content exists therein in a free state. This\r\nacid compound of caffein will be largely decomposed during the process\r\nof torrefaction, so that in roasted coffee a larger percentage will be\r\npresent in the free state. Microscopical examination of the roasted bean\r\nlends verisimilitude to this contention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLANTER'S BUNGALOW WITH COFFEE TREES IN FLOWER, MYSORE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COOLIES BAGGING COFFEE ON THE DRYING GROUNDS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE SCENES IN BRITISH INDIA]\r\n\r\nTABLE II--COFFEE ANALYSES\r\n\r\n               Santos Green\r\n                  |   Santos Roasted\r\n                  |      |   Padang Green\r\n                  |      |      |   Padang Roasted\r\n                  |      |      |      |   Guatemala Green\r\n                  |      |      |      |      |   Guatemala Roasted\r\n                  |      |      |      |      |      |   Mocha Green\r\n                  |      |      |      |      |      |      |     Mocha\r\n                  |      |      |      |      |      |      |    Roasted\r\n                  |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\nMoisture         8.75   3.75   8.78   2.72   9.59   3.40   9.06   3.36\r\n  April 20th\r\nMoisture\r\n  September 20th 8.12   6.45   8.05   6.03   8.68   6.92   8.15   7.10\r\nAsh              4.41   4.49   4.23   4.70   3.93   4.48   4.20   4.43\r\nOil             12.96  13.76  12.28  13.33  12.42  13.07  14.04  14.18\r\nCaffein          1.87   1.81   1.56   1.47   1.26   1.22   1.31   1.28\r\nCaffein,\r\n  dry basis      2.03   ....   1.69   ....   1.39   ....   1.44   ....\r\nCrude fiber     20.70  14.75  21.92  14.95  22.23  15.23  22.46  15.41\r\nProtein          9.50  12.93  12.62  14.75  10.43  11.69   8.56   9.57\r\nProtein,\r\n  dry basis     10.41   ....  13.68   ....  11.53   ....   9.41   ....\r\nWater extract   31.11  30.30  30.83  30.21  31.04  30.47  31.27  30.44\r\nSpecific\r\n  gravity,\r\n  10 percent\r\n  extract        1.0109 1.0101 1.0107 1.0104 1.0105 1.0104 1.0108 1.0108\r\nBushelweight    47.0   28.2   45.2   27.8   52.2   27.2   48.8   30.2\r\n1,000 kernel\r\n  weight       130.60 120.20 167.30 151.35 189.20 165.80 119.52 100.00\r\n1,000 kernel\r\n  weight,\r\n  dry basis    119.1  115.7  154.1  147.2  171.0  160.1  108.6   96.6\r\nDextrose         ....   0.72   ....   0.81   ....   0.54   ....   0.46\r\nCaffetannic\r\n  acid          15.58  17.44  15.37  16.93  16.27  17.13  15.61  16.89\r\nAcidity by\r\n  titration\r\n  apparent       1.50   2.08   1.47   2.00   1.39   2.13   1.11   1.87\r\n\r\nAs may be seen in Table II,[138] the caffein content of coffee varies\r\nwith the different kinds, a fair average of the caffein content being\r\nabout 1.5 percent for _C. arabica_, to which class most of our coffees\r\nbelong. However, aside from these may be mentioned _C. canephora_, which\r\nyields 1.97 percent caffein; _C. mauritiana_, which contains 0.07\r\npercent of the alkaloid (less than the average \"caffein-free coffee\");\r\nand _C. humboltiana_, which contains no caffein, but a bitter principle,\r\ncafemarin. Neither do the berries of _C. Gallienii_, _C. Bonnieri_, or\r\n_C. Mogeneti_ contain any caffein; and there has also been reported[139]\r\na \"Congo coffee\" which contained no crystallizable alkaloid whatever.\r\n\r\nApparently the variation in caffein content is largely due to the genus\r\nof the tree from which the berry comes, but it is also quite probable\r\nthat the nature of the soil and climatic conditions play an important\r\npart. In the light of what has been accomplished in the field of\r\nagricultural research, it does not seem improbable that a man of\r\nBurbank's ability and foresight could successfully develop a series of\r\ncoffees possessed of all the cup qualities inherent in those now used,\r\nbut totally devoid of caffein. Whether this is desirable or not is a\r\nquestion to be considered in an entirely different light from the\r\npossibility of its accomplishment.\r\n\r\nTABLE III--CAFFEIN IN DIFFERENT ROASTS\r\n\r\n            Rio    Santos   Guatemala\r\n\r\nGreen      1.68%    1.85%    1.82%\r\nCinnamon   1.70     1.72     1.80\r\nMedium     1.66     1.66     1.56\r\nCity       1.36     1.66     1.46\r\n\r\nThe variation in the caffein content of coffee at different intensities\r\nof roasting, as shown in Table III[140] is, of course, primarily\r\ndependent upon the original content of the green. A considerable portion\r\nof the caffein is sublimed off during roasting, thus decreasing the\r\namount in the bean. The higher the roast is carried, the greater the\r\nshrinkage; but, as the analyses in the above table show, the loss of\r\ncaffein proceeds out of proportion to the shrinkage, for the percentage\r\nof caffein constantly decreases with the increase in color. If the roast\r\nbe carried almost to the point of carbonization, as in the case of the\r\n\"Italian roast,\" the caffein content will be almost nil. This is not a\r\nsuitable coffee for one desiring an almost caffein-free drink, for the\r\nempyreumatic products produced by this excessive roasting will be more\r\ntoxic by far than the caffein itself would have been.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caffein-free Coffee_\r\n\r\nThe demand for a caffein-free coffee may be attributed to two causes,\r\nnamely: the objectionable effect which caffein has upon neurasthenics;\r\nand the questionable advertising of the \"coffee-substitute\" dealers, who\r\nhave by this means persuaded many normal persons into believing that\r\nthey are decidedly sub-normal. As a result of this demand, a variety of\r\ndecaffeinated coffees have been placed on the market. Just why the\r\ncoffee men have not taken advantage of naturally caffein-free coffees,\r\nor of the possibility of obtaining coffees low in caffein content by\r\nchemical selection from the lines now used, is a difficult question to\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nIn the endeavor to develop a commercial decaffeinated coffee the first\r\nmethod of procedure was to extract the caffein from roasted coffee. This\r\nmethod had its advantages and its disadvantages, of which the latter\r\npredominated. The caffein in the roasted coffee is not as tightly bound\r\nchemically as in the green coffee, and is, therefore, more easily\r\nextracted. Also, the structure of the roasted bean renders it more\r\nreadily penetrable by solvents than does that of the green bean.\r\nHowever, the great objection to this method arises from the fact that at\r\nthe same time as the caffein is extracted, the volatile aromatic and\r\nflavoring constituents of the coffee are removed also. These substances,\r\nwhich are essential for the maintenance of quality by the coffee, though\r\nreadily separated from the caffein, can not be returned to the roasted\r\nbean with any degree of certainty. This virtually insurmountable\r\nobstacle forced the abandonment of this mode of attack.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid this action, the attention of investigators was\r\ndirected to extraction of the alkaloid in question from the green bean.\r\nBecause of the difficulty of causing the solvent to penetrate the bean,\r\nrecourse to grinding resulted. This greatly facilitated the desired\r\nextraction, but a difficulty was encountered when the subsequent\r\nroasting was attempted. The irregular and broken character of the ground\r\ngreen beans resisted all attempts to produce practically a uniformly\r\nroasted, highly aromatic product from the ground material.\r\n\r\nAvoidance of this lack of uniformity in the product, and the great\r\ndesirability to duplicate the normal bean as far as possible,\r\nnecessitated the development of a method of extraction of the caffein\r\nfrom the whole raw bean without a permanent alteration of the shape\r\nthereof. The close structure of the green bean, and its consequent\r\nresistance to penetration by solvents, and the existence of the caffein\r\nin the bean as an acid salt, which is not easily soluble, offered\r\nresistance to successful extraction.\r\n\r\nAs a means of overcoming the difficulty of structure, the beans were\r\nallowed to stand in water in order to swell, or the cells were expanded\r\nby treatment with steam, or the beans were subjected to the action of\r\nsome \"cellulose-softening acids,\" such as acetic acid or sulphur dioxid.\r\nAs a method of facilitating the mechanical side of extraction without\r\ndeleterious effects, the treatment of the coffee with steam under\r\npressure, as utilized in the patented process of Myer, Roselius, and\r\nWimmer,[141] is probably the safest.\r\n\r\nMany ingenious methods have been devised for the ready removal of the\r\ncaffein from this point on. Several processes employ an alkali, such as\r\nammonium hydroxid, to free the caffein from the acid; or an acid, such\r\nas acetic, hydrochloric, or sulphurous, is used to form a more soluble\r\nsalt of caffein. Other procedures effect the dissociation of the\r\ncaffein-acid salt by dampening or immersion in a liquid and subjecting\r\nthe mass to the action of an electric current.\r\n\r\nThe caffein is usually extracted from the beans by benzol or chloroform,\r\nbut a variety of solvents may be employed, such as petrolic ether,\r\nwater, alcohol, carbon tetrachloride, ethylene chloride, acetone, ethyl\r\nether, or mixtures or emulsions of these. After extraction, the beans\r\nmay be steam distilled to remove and to recover any residual traces of\r\nsolvent, and then dried and roasted. It is said[142] that by heating the\r\nbeans before bringing them into contact with steam, not only is an\r\neconomy of steam effected, but the quality of the resultant product is\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nOne clever but expensive method[143] of preparing caffein-free coffee\r\nconsists in heating the beans under pressure, with some substance, such\r\nas sodium salicylate, with the resultant formation of a more soluble and\r\nmore easily steam-distillable compound of caffein. The beans are then\r\nsteam distilled to remove the caffein, dried, and roasted.\r\n\r\nAnother process of peculiar interest is that of Hubner,[144] in which\r\nthe coffee beans are well washed and then spread in layers and kept\r\ncovered with water at 15° C. until limited germination has taken place,\r\nwhereupon the beans are removed and the caffein extracted with water at\r\n50° C. It is claimed by the inventor that sprouting serves to remove\r\nsome of the caffein, but it is quite probable that the process does\r\nnothing more than accomplish simple aqueous extraction.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of these processes the flavor of the resultant product\r\nshould be very similar to natural roasted coffee. However, in the cases\r\nwhere aqueous extraction is employed, other substances besides caffein\r\nare removed that are replaced in the bean only with difficulty. The\r\nresultant product accordingly is very likely to have a flavor not\r\nentirely natural. On the other hand, beans from which the caffein is\r\nextracted with volatile solvents, if the operation be conducted\r\ncarefully, should give a natural-tasting roast. Any residual traces of\r\nthe solvent left in the bean are volatilized upon roasting.\r\n\r\nSome of the caffein-free coffees on the market show upon analysis almost\r\nas much caffein as the natural bean. Those manufactured by reliable\r\nconcerns, however, are virtually caffein-free, their content of the\r\nalkaloid varying from 0.3 to 0.07 percent as opposed to 1.5 percent in\r\nthe untreated coffee. Thus, although actually only caffein-poor, in\r\norder to get the reaction of one cup of ordinary coffee one would have\r\nto drink an unusual amount of the brew made from these coffees.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Aromatic Principles of Coffee_\r\n\r\nTo ascertain just what substance or substances give the pleasing and\r\ncharacteristic aroma to coffee has long been the great desire of both\r\npractical and scientific men interested in the coffee business. This\r\nelusive material has been variously called caffeol, caffeone, \"the\r\nessential oil of coffee,\" etc., the terms having acquired an ambiguous\r\nand incorrect significance. It is now generally agreed that the aromatic\r\nconstituent of coffee is not an essential oil, but a complex of\r\ncompounds which usage has caused to be collectively called \"caffeol.\"\r\n\r\nThese substances are not present in the green bean, but are produced\r\nduring the process of roasting. Attempts at identification and location\r\nof origin have been numerous; and although not conclusive, still have\r\nnot proven entirely futile. One of the first observations along this\r\nline was that of Benjamin Thompson in 1812. \"This fragrance of coffee is\r\ncertainly owing to the escape of a volatile aromatic substance which did\r\nnot originally exist as such in the grain, but which is formed in the\r\nprocess of roasting it.\" Later, Graham, Stenhouse, and Campbell started\r\non the way to the identification of this aroma by noting that \"in common\r\nwith all the valuable constituents of coffee, caffeone is found to come\r\nfrom the soluble portion of the roasted seed.\"[145]\r\n\r\nComparison of the aroma given off by coffee during the roasting process\r\nwith that of fresh-ground roasted coffee shows that the two aromas,\r\nalthough somewhat different, may be attributed to the same substances\r\npresent in different proportions in the two cases. Recovery and\r\nidentification of the aromatic principles escaping from the roaster\r\nwould go far toward answering the question regarding the nature of the\r\naroma. Bernheimer[146] reported water, caffein, caffeol, acetic acid,\r\nquinol, methylamin, acetone, fatty acids and pyrrol in the distillate\r\ncoming from roasting coffee. The caffeol obtained by Bernheimer in this\r\nwork was believed by him to be a methyl derivative of saligenin.\r\nJaeckle[147] examined a similar product and found considerable\r\nquantities of caffein, furfurol, and acetic acid, together with small\r\namounts of acetone, ammonia, trimethylamin, and formic acid. The caffeol\r\nof Bernheimer could not be detected. Another substance was separated\r\nalso, but in too small a quantity to permit complete identification.\r\nThis substance consisted of colorless crystals, which readily sublimed,\r\nmelted at 115° to 117° C., and contained sulphur. The crystals were\r\ninsoluble in water, almost insoluble in alcohol, but readily soluble in\r\nether.\r\n\r\nBy distilling roasted coffee with superheated steam, Erdmann[148]\r\nobtained an oil consisting of an indifferent portion of 58 percent and\r\nan acid portion of 42 percent, consisting mainly of a valeric acid,\r\nprobably alphamethylbutyric acid. The indifferent portion was found to\r\ncontain about 50 percent furfuryl alcohol, together with a number of\r\nphenols. The fraction containing the characteristic odorous constituent\r\nof coffee boiled at 93° C. under 13 mm. pressure. The yield of this\r\nlatter principle was extremely small, only about 0.89 gram being\r\nprocured from 65 kilos of coffee.\r\n\r\nPyridin was also shown to be present in coffee by Betrand and\r\nWeisweiller[149] and by Sayre.[150] As high as 200 to 500 milligrams of\r\nthis toxic compound have been obtained from 1 kilogram of freshly\r\nroasted coffee.\r\n\r\nAs stated above, the empyreumatic volatile aromatic constituents of the\r\ncoffee are without question formed during and by the roasting process.\r\nAccording to Thorpe,[151] the most favorable temperature for development\r\nof coffee odor and flavor is about 200° C. Erdmann claimed to have\r\nproduced caffeol by gently heating together caffetannic acid, caffein,\r\nand cane sugar. Other investigators have been unable to duplicate this\r\nwork. Another authority,[152] giving it the empirical formula\r\nC_8_H_10_O_2, states that it is produced during roasting, probably\r\nat the expense of a portion of the caffein. These conceptions are in the\r\nmain incomplete and inaccurate.\r\n\r\nBy means of careful work, Grafe[153] came closer to ascertaining the\r\norigin of the fugacious aromatic materials. His work with normal,\r\ncaffein-free coffee and with Thum's purified coffee led him to state\r\nthat a part of these substances was derived from the crude fiber,\r\nprobably from the hemi-cellulose of the thick endosperm cells.\r\nSayre[154] makes the most plausible proposal regarding the origin of\r\ncaffeol. He considers the roasting of coffee as a destructive\r\ndistillation process, summarizing the results, briefly, as the\r\nproduction of furfuraldehyde from the carbohydrates, acrolein from the\r\nfats, catechol and pyrogallol from the tannins, and ammonia, amins, and\r\npyrrols from the proteins. The products of roasting inter-react to\r\nproduce many compounds of varying degrees of complexity and toxicity.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty which arises in the attempt to identify the\r\naromatic constituents of coffee is that the caffeols of no two coffees\r\nmay be said to be the same. The reason for this is apparent; for the\r\ngreen coffees themselves vary in composition, and those of the same\r\nconstitution are not roasted under identical conditions. Therefore, it\r\nis not to be expected that the decomposition products formed by the\r\naction of the different greens would be the same. Also, these volatile\r\nproducts occur in the roasted coffee in such a small amount that the\r\nascertaining of their percentage relationship and the recognition of all\r\nthat are present are not possible with the methods of analysis at\r\npresent at our disposal. Until better analytical procedures have been\r\ndeveloped we can not hope to establish a chemical basis for the grading\r\nof coffees from this standpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Oil and Fat_\r\n\r\nIt is well to distinguish between the \"coffee oils,\" as they are termed\r\nby the trade, and true coffee oil. In speaking of the qualities of\r\ncoffee, connoisseurs frequently use erroneous terms, particularly when\r\nthey designate certain of the flavoring and aromatic constituents of\r\ncoffee as \"oils\" or \"essential oils.\" Coffee does not contain any\r\nessential oils, the aromatic constituent corresponding to essential oil\r\nin coffee being caffeol, a complex which is water-soluble, a property\r\nnot possessed by any true oil. True, the oil when isolated from roasted\r\ncoffee does possess, before purification, considerable of the aromatic\r\nand flavoring constituents of coffee. They are, however, no part of the\r\ncoffee fat, but are held in it no doubt by an enfleurage action in much\r\nthe same way that perfumes of roses, etc., are absorbed and retained by\r\nfats and oils in the commercial preparation of pomades and perfumes.\r\nThis affinity of the coffee oil for caffeol assists in the retention of\r\naromatic substances by the whole roasted bean. However, upon extraction\r\nof ground roasted coffee with water, the caffeol shows a preferential\r\nsolubility in water, and is dissolved out from the oil, going into the\r\nbrew.\r\n\r\nThe true oil of coffee has been investigated to a fair degree and has\r\nbeen found to be inodorous when purified. Analysis of green and roasted\r\ncoffees shows them to possess between 12 percent and 20 percent fat.\r\nWarnier[155] extracted ground unroasted coffee with petroleum ether,\r\nwashed the extract with water, and distilled off the solvent, obtaining\r\na yellow-brownish oil possessing a sharp taste. From his examination of\r\nthis oil he reported these constants: d_24-5, 0.942; refraction at\r\n25°, 81.5; solidifying point, 6° to 5°; melting point, 8° to 9°;\r\nsaponification number, 177.5; esterification number, 166.7; acid number,\r\n6.2; acetyl number, 0; iodin number, 84.5 to 86.3. Meyer and Eckert[156]\r\ncarefully purified coffee oil and saponified it with Li_2_O in alcohol.\r\nIn the saponifiable portion, glycerol was the only alcohol present, the\r\nacids being carnaubic, 10 percent; daturinic acid, 1 to 1.5 percent;\r\npalmitic acid, 25 to 28 percent; capric acid, 0.5 percent; oleic acid,\r\n2 percent, and linoleic acid, 50 percent. The unsaponifiable wax\r\namounted to 21.2 percent, was nitrogen-free, gave a phytostearin\r\nreaction, and saponification and oxidation indicated that it was\r\nprobably a tannol carnaubate. Von-Bitto[157] examined the fat extracted\r\nfrom the inner husk of the coffee berry and found it to be faint yellow\r\nin color, and to solidify only gradually after melting. Upon analysis,\r\nit showed: saponification value, 141.2; palmitic acid, 37.84 percent,\r\nand glycerids as tripalmitin, 28.03 percent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carbohydrates of the Coffee Berry_\r\n\r\nThere has been considerable diversity of opinion regarding the sugar of\r\ncoffee. Bell believed the sugar to be of a peculiar species allied to\r\nmelezitose, but Ewell,[158] G.L. Spencer, and others definitely proved\r\nthe presence of sucrose in coffee. In fat-free coffee 6 percent of\r\nsucrose was found extractable by 70 percent alcohol. Baker[159] claimed\r\nthat manno-arabinose, or manno-xylose, formed one of the most important\r\nconstituents of the coffee-berry substance and yielded mannose on\r\nhydrolysis. Schultze and Maxwell state that raw coffee contains\r\ngalactan, mannan, and pentosans, the latter present to the extent of 5\r\npercent in raw and 3 percent in roasted coffee. By distilling coffee\r\nwith hydrochloric acid Ewell obtained furfurol equivalent to 9 percent\r\npentose. He also obtained a gummy substance which, on hydrolysis, gave\r\nrise to a reducing sugar; and as it gave mucic acid and furfurol on\r\noxidation, he concluded that it was a compound of pentose and galactose.\r\nIn undressed Mysore coffee Commaille[160] found 2.6 percent of glucose\r\nand no dextrin. This claim of the presence of glucose in coffee was\r\nsubstantiated by the work of Hlasiwetz,[161] who resolved a caffetannic\r\nacid, which he had isolated, into glucose and a peculiar crystallizable\r\nacid, C_8_H_8_O_4, which he named caffeic acid.\r\n\r\nThe starch content of coffee is very low. Cereals may readily be\r\ndetected and identified in coffee mixtures by the presence and\r\ncharacteristics of their starch, in view of the fact that coffee\r\n(chicory, too) is practically free from starch. On this score it is\r\ninadvisable for diabetics to use any of the many cereal substitutes for\r\ncoffee. It is pertinent to note in this connection that persons\r\nsuffering from diabetes may sweeten their coffee with saccharin (1/2 to\r\n1 grain per cup) or glycerol, thus obtaining perfect satisfaction\r\nwithout endangering their health.\r\n\r\nThe cellulose in coffee is of a very hard and horny character in the\r\ngreen bean, but it is made softer and more brittle during the process of\r\nroasting. It is rather difficult to define under the microscope,\r\nparticularly after roasting, even though the chief characteristics of\r\nthe cellular tissue are more or less retained. Coffee cellulose gives a\r\nblue color with sulphuric acid and iodin, and is dissolved by an\r\nammoniacal solution of copper oxid. Even after roasting, remnants of the\r\nsilver skin are always present, the structure of which, a thin membrane\r\nwith adherent, thick-walled, spindle-shaped, hollow cells, is peculiar\r\nto coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Chemistry of Roasting_\r\n\r\nThe effect of the heat in the roasting of coffee is largely evidenced as\r\na destructive distillation and also as a partial dehydration. At the\r\nsame time, oxidizing and reducing reactions probably occur within the\r\nbean, as well as some polymerization and inter-reactions.\r\n\r\nA loss of water is to be expected as the natural outcome of the\r\napplication of heat; and analyses show that the moisture content of raw\r\ncoffee varies from 8 to 14 percent, while after roasting it rarely\r\nexceeds 3 percent, and frequently falls as low as 0.5 percent. The loss\r\nof the original water content of the green bean is not the only moisture\r\nloss; for many of the constituents of coffee, notably the carbohydrates,\r\nare decomposed upon heating to give off water, so that analysis before\r\nand after roasting is no direct indication of the exact amount of water\r\ndriven off in the process. If it be desired to ascertain this quantity\r\naccurately, catching of the products which are driven off and\r\ndetermination of their water content becomes necessary.\r\n\r\nThe carbohydrates both dehydrate and decompose. The result of the\r\ndehydration is the formation of caramel and related products, which\r\ncomprise the principal coloring matters in coffee infusion. That portion\r\nof the carbohydrates known as pentosans gives rise to furfuraldehyde,\r\none of the important components of caffeol.\r\n\r\nThe effect of roasting upon the fat content of the beans is to reduce\r\nits actual weight, but not to change appreciably the percentage\r\npresent, since the decrease in quantity keeps pace fairly well with the\r\nshrinkage. Some of the more volatile fatty acids are driven off, and the\r\nfats break down to give a larger percentage of free fatty acids, some\r\nlight esters, acrolein, and formic acid. If the roast be a very heavy\r\none, or is brought up too rapidly, the fat will come to the surface,\r\nthrough breaking of the fat cells, with a decided alteration in the\r\nchemical nature of the fat and with pronounced expansion and cracking.\r\n\r\nDecomposition of the caffein acid-salt and considerable sublimation of\r\nthe caffein also occur. The majority of the caffein undergoes this\r\nvolatilization unchanged, but a portion of it is probably oxidized with\r\nthe formation of ammonia, methylamin, di-methylparabanic acid, and\r\ncarbon dioxid. This reaction partly explains why the amount of caffein\r\nrecovered from the roaster flues is not commensurate with the amount\r\nlost from the roasting coffee; although incomplete condensation is also\r\nan important factor. Microscopic examination of the roasted beans will\r\nshow occasional small crystals of caffein in the indentations on the\r\nsurface, where they have been deposited during the cooling process.\r\n\r\nThe compound, or compounds, known as \"caffetannic acid\" are probably the\r\nsource of catechol, as the proteins are of ammonia, amins, and pyrrols.\r\nThe crude fiber and other unnamed constituents of the raw beans react\r\nanalogously to similar compounds in the destructive distillation of\r\nwood, giving rise to acetone, various fatty acids, carbon dioxid and\r\nother uncondensable gases, and many compounds of unknown identity.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of roasting and subsequent cooling these decomposition\r\nproducts probably interact and polymerize to form aromatic tar-like\r\nmaterials and other complexes which play an important rôle among the\r\ndelicate flavors of coffee. In fact, it is not unlikely that these\r\nreactions continue throughout the storage time after roasting, and that\r\nupon them the deterioration of roasted coffee is largely dependent.\r\nSpeculation upon what complex compounds are thus formed offers much\r\nattraction. A notable one by Sayre[162] postulates the reaction between\r\nacrolein and ammonia to give methyl pyridin, which in turn with furfurol\r\nforms furfurol vinyl pyridin. This upon reduction would produce the\r\nalkaloid, conin, traces of which have been found in coffee.\r\n\r\nAlthough furfuraldehyde is the natural decomposition product of\r\npentosans, furfuryl alcohol is the main furane body of coffee aroma.\r\nThis would indicate that active reducing conditions prevail within the\r\nbean during roasting; and the further fact that carbon monoxid is given\r\noff during roasting makes this seem quite probable. If one admits that\r\ncaffetannic acid exists in the green bean; that upon oxidation it gives\r\nviridic acid; and that it is concentrated in the outer layers of the\r\nbean, as certain investigators have claimed, then there is chemical\r\nproof of the existence of oxidizing conditions about the exterior of the\r\nbean. In any event, however, the fact that oxidizing conditions\r\npredominate on the external portion of the bean is obvious. Accordingly,\r\nour meager knowledge of the chemistry of roasting indicates that while\r\nthe external layers of the roasting beans are subjected to oxidizing\r\nconditions, reducing ones exist in the interior. Future experimentation\r\nwill, no doubt, prove this to be the case.\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to retain in the beans the volatile products,\r\nwhich normally escape, both by coating previous to roasting[163] and by\r\nconducting the process under pressure.[164] However, the results so\r\nobtained were not practical, since the cup values were decreased in the\r\nmajority of cases, and the physiological effects produced were\r\nundesirable. In cases where the quality was improved, the gain was not\r\nsufficient to recompense the roaster for the additional expense and\r\ndifficulty of operation.\r\n\r\nVarious persons have essayed to control the roasting process\r\nautomatically; but the extreme variance in composition of different\r\ncoffees, the effect of changing atmospheric conditions, and the lack of\r\nconstancy in the calorific power of fuels have conspired to defeat the\r\nautomatic roasting machine.[165] It is even doubtful whether De\r\nMattia's[166] process for roasting until the vapors evolved produce a\r\nviolet color when passed into a solution of fuchsin decolorized with\r\nsulphur dioxid is commercially reliable.\r\n\r\nMany patents have been granted for the treatment of coffees immediately\r\nprior to or during roasting with the object of thus improving the\r\nproduct. The majority of these depend upon adding solutions of\r\nsugar,[167] calcium saccharate,[168] or other carbohydrates,[169] and in\r\nthe case of Eckhardt,[170] of small percentages of tannic acid and fat.\r\nIn direct opposition to this latter practise, Jurgens and Westphal[171]\r\napply alkali, ostensibly to lessen the \"tannic acid\" content.\r\nBrougier[172] sprays a solution containing caffein upon the roasting\r\nberries; and Potter[173] roasts the coffee together with chicory,\r\neffecting a separation at the end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROUND COFFEE UNDER THE MICROSCOPE]\r\n\r\nThe exact effect which roasting with sugars has upon the flavor is not\r\nwell understood; but it is known that it causes the beans to absorb more\r\nmoisture, due to the hygroscopicity of the caramel formed. For instance,\r\nberries roasted with the addition of glucose syrup hold an additional 7\r\npercent of water and give a darker infusion than normally roasted\r\ncoffee. When the green coffee is glazed with cane sugar prior to\r\nroasting, the losses during the process are much higher than ordinarily,\r\non account of the higher temperature required to attain the desired\r\nresults. Losses for ordinary coffee taken to a 16-percent roast are 9.7\r\npercent of the original fat and 21.1 percent of the original caffein;\r\nwhile for \"sugar glazed\" coffee the losses were 18.3 percent of the\r\noriginal fat and 44.3 percent of the original caffein, using 8 to 9\r\npercent sugar with Java coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grinding and Packaging_\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that green coffee improves upon aging, whereas\r\nafter roasting it deteriorates with time. Even when packed in the best\r\ncontainers, age shows to a disadvantage on the roasted bean. This is due\r\nto a number of causes, among which are oxidation, volatilization of the\r\naroma, absorption of moisture and consequent hydrolysis, and alteration\r\nin the character of the aromatic principles. Doolittle and Wright[174]\r\nin the course of some extensive experiments found that roasted coffee\r\nshowed a continual gain in weight throughout 60 weeks, this gain being\r\nmostly due to moisture absorption. An investigation by Gould[175] also\r\ndemonstrated that roasted coffee gives off carbon dioxid and carbon\r\nmonoxid upon standing. The latter, apparently produced during roasting\r\nand retained by the cellular structure of the bean, diffuses therefrom;\r\nwhereas the former comes from an ante-roasting decomposition of unstable\r\ncompounds present.[176]\r\n\r\nThe surface of the whole bean forms a natural protection against\r\natmospheric influences, and as soon as this is broken, deterioration\r\nsets in. On this account, coffee should be ground immediately before\r\nextraction if maximum efficiency is to be obtained. The cells of the\r\nbeans tend to retain the fugacious aromatic principles to a certain\r\nextent; so that the more of these which are broken in grinding, the\r\ngreater will be the initial loss and the more rapid the vitiation of the\r\ncoffee. It might, therefore, seem desirable to grind coarsely in order\r\nto avoid this as much as possible. However, the coarser the grind, the\r\nslower and more incomplete will be the extraction. A patent[177] has\r\nbeen granted for a grind which contains about 90 percent fine coffee and\r\n10 percent coarse, the patentee's claim being that in his \"irregular\r\ngrind\" the coarse coffee retains enough of the volatile constituents to\r\nflavor the beverage, while the fine coffee gives a very high\r\nextraction, thus giving an efficient brew without sacrificing\r\nindividuality.\r\n\r\nIn packaging roasted coffee the whole bean is naturally the best form to\r\nemploy, but if the coffee is ground first, King[178] found that\r\ndeterioration is most rapid with the coarse ground coffee, the speed\r\ndecreasing with the size of the ground particles. He explains this on\r\nthe ground of \"ventilation\"--the finer the grind, the closer the\r\nparticles pack together, the less the circulation of air through the\r\nmass, and the smaller the amount of aroma which is carried away. He also\r\nfound that glass makes the best container for coffee, with the tin can,\r\nand the foil-lined bag with an inner lining of glassine, not greatly\r\ninferior.\r\n\r\nConsiderable publicity has been given recently to the method of packing\r\ncoffee in a sealed tin under reduced pressure. While thus packing in a\r\npartial vacuum undoubtedly retards oxidation and precludes escape of\r\naroma from the original package, it would seem likely to hasten the\r\ninitial volatilizing of the aroma. Also, it would appear from\r\nGould's[179] work that roasted coffee evolves carbon dioxid until a\r\ncertain positive pressure is attained, regardless of the initial\r\npressure in the container. Accordingly, vacuum-packing apparently\r\nenhances decomposition of certain constituents of coffee. Whether this\r\nresult is beneficial or otherwise is not quite clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Brewing_\r\n\r\nThe old-time boiling method of making coffee has gone out of style,\r\nbecause the average consumer is becoming aware of the fact that it does\r\nnot give a drink of maximum efficiency. Boiling the ground coffee with\r\nwater results in a large loss of aromatic principles by steam\r\ndistillation, a partial hydrolysis of insoluble portions of the grounds,\r\nand a subsequent extraction of the products thus formed, which give a\r\nbitter flavor to the beverage. Also, the maintenance of a high\r\ntemperature by the direct application of heat has a deleterious effect\r\nupon the substances in solution. This is also true in the case of the\r\npumping percolator, and any other device wherein the solution is caused\r\nto pass directly into steam at the point where heat is applied. Warm and\r\ncold water extract about the same amount of material from coffee; but\r\nwith different rates of speed, an increase in temperature decreasing the\r\ntime necessary to effect the desired result.\r\n\r\nIt is a well known fact that re-warming a coffee brew has an undesirable\r\neffect upon it. This is very probably due to the precipitation of some\r\nof the water-soluble proteins when the solution cools, and their\r\nsubsequent decomposition when heat is applied directly to them in\r\nreheating the solution. The absorption of air by the solution upon\r\ncooling, with attendant oxidation, which is accentuated by the\r\napplication of heat in re-warming, must also be considered. It is\r\nlikewise probable that when an extract of coffee cools upon standing,\r\nsome of the aromatic principles separate out and are lost by\r\nvolatilization.\r\n\r\nThe method of extracting coffee which gives the most satisfaction is\r\npractised by using a grind just coarse enough to retain the\r\nindividualistic flavoring components, retaining the ground coffee in a\r\nfine cloth bag, as in the urn system, or on a filter paper, as in the\r\nTricolator, and pouring water at boiling temperature over the coffee.\r\nDuring the extraction, a top should be kept on the device to minimize\r\nvolatilization, and the temperature of the extract should be maintained\r\nconstant at about 200° F. after being made. Whether a repouring is\r\nnecessary or not is dependent upon the speed with which the water passes\r\nthrough the coffee, which in turn is controlled by the fineness of the\r\ngrind and of the filtering medium.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Water Extract_\r\n\r\nAlthough many analyses of the whole coffee bean are available, but\r\nlittle work has been reported upon the aqueous extracts. The total water\r\nextract of roasted coffee varies from 20 to 31 percent in different\r\nkinds of coffee. The following analysis of the extract from a Santos\r\ncoffee may be taken as a fair average example of the water-soluble\r\nmaterial.[180]\r\n\r\nTABLE IV--ANALYSIS OF SANTOS COFFEE EXTRACT\r\n(DRY BASIS)\r\n\r\nEther extract, fixed      1.06%\r\nTotal nitrogen            3.40%\r\nCaffein                   5.42%\r\nCrude fiber               0.25%\r\nTotal ash                17.43%\r\nReducing sugar            2.70%\r\nCaffetannic acid         15.33%\r\nProtein                   7.71%\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to make the trade terms, such as acidity, astringency,\r\netc., used in describing a cup of coffee, conform with the chemical\r\nmeanings of the same terms. However, a fair explanation of the cause of\r\nsome of these qualities can be made. Careful work by Warnier[181] showed\r\nthe actual acidities of some East India coffees to be:\r\n\r\nTABLE V--ACIDITY OF SOME EAST INDIA COFFEES\r\n\r\nCoffee from         Acid Content\r\n  Sindjai                 0.033%\r\n  Timor                   0.028%\r\n  Bauthain                0.019%\r\n  Boengei                 0.016%\r\n  Loewae                  0.021%\r\n  Waloe Pengenten         0.018%\r\n  Kawi Redjo              0.015%\r\n  Palman Tjiasem          0.022%\r\n  Malang                  0.013%\r\n\r\nThese figures may be taken as reliable examples of the true acid content\r\nof coffee; and though they seem very low, it is not at all\r\nincomprehensible that the acids which they indicate produce the acidity\r\nin a cup of coffee. They probably are mainly volatile organic acids,\r\ntogether with other acidic-natured products of roasting. We know that\r\nvery small quantities of acids are readily detected in fruit juices and\r\nbeer, and that variation in their percentage is quickly noticed, while\r\nthe neutralization of this small amount of acidity leaves an insipid\r\ndrink. Hence, it seems quite likely that this small acid content gives\r\nto the coffee brew its essential acidity. A few minor experiments on\r\nneutralization have proven that a very insipid beverage is produced by\r\nthus treating a coffee infusion.\r\n\r\nThe body, or what might be called the licorice-like character, of\r\ncoffee, is due conceivably to the presence of bodies of a glucosidic\r\nnature and to caramel. Astringency, or bitterness, is dependent upon the\r\ndecomposition products of crude fiber and chlorogenic acid, and upon the\r\nsoluble mineral content of the bean. The degree to which a coffee is\r\nsweet-tasting or not is, of course, dependent upon its other\r\ncharacteristics, but probably varies with the reducing sugar content.\r\nAside from the effects of these constituents upon cup quality, the\r\ninfluence of volatile aromatic and flavoring constituents is always\r\nevident in the cup valuation, and introduces a controlling factor in the\r\nproduction of an individualistic drink.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Extracts_\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty of the quality of coffee brews as made from day to day,\r\nthe inconvenience to the housewife of conducting the extraction, and the\r\ninevitable trend of the human race toward labor-saving devices, have\r\ncombined their influences to produce a demand for a substance which will\r\ngive a good cup of coffee when added to water. This gave rise to a\r\nnumber of concentrated liquid and solid \"extracts of coffee,\" which,\r\nbecause of their general poor quality, soon brought this type of product\r\ninto disrepute. This is not surprising; for these preparations were\r\nmainly mixtures of caramel and carelessly prepared extracts of chicory,\r\nroasted cereals, and cheap coffee.\r\n\r\nLiquid extracts of coffee galore have appeared on the market only soon\r\nto disappear. Difficulty is experienced in having them maintain their\r\nquality over a protracted period of time, primarily due to the\r\nhydrolyzing action of water on the dissolved substances. They also\r\nferment readily, although a small percentage of preservative, such as\r\nbenzoate of soda, will halt spoilage.[182]\r\n\r\nSo much trouble is not encountered with coffee-extract powders--the\r\nso-called \"soluble\" or \"instant\" coffees. The majority of these powdered\r\ndry extracts do, however, show great affinity for atmospheric moisture.\r\nTheir hygroscopicity necessitates packing and keeping them in air-tight\r\ncontainers to prevent them running into a solid, slowly soluble mass.\r\n\r\nThe general method of procedure employed in the preparation of these\r\npowders is to extract ground roasted coffee with water, and to evaporate\r\nthe aqueous solution to dryness with great care. The major difficulty\r\nwhich seems to arise is that the heat needed to effect evaporation\r\nchanges the character of the soluble material, at the same time driving\r\noff some volatile constituents which are essential to a natural flavor.\r\nMany complex and clever processes have been developed for avoiding these\r\ndifficulties, and quite a number of patents on processes, and several on\r\nthe resultant product, have been allowed; but the commercial production\r\nof a soluble coffee of freshly-brewed-coffee-duplicating-power is yet to\r\nbe accomplished. However, there are now on the market several\r\ncoffee-extract powders which dissolve readily in water, giving quite a\r\nfair approximation of freshly brewed coffee. The improvement shown\r\nsince they first appeared augurs well for the eventual attainment of\r\ntheir ultimate goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulterants and Substitutes_\r\n\r\nThere would appear to be three reasons why substitutes for coffee are\r\nsought--the high cost, or absence, of the real product; the acquiring of\r\na preferential taste, by the consumer, for the substitute; and the\r\ninjurious effects of coffee when used to excess. Makers of coffee\r\nsubstitutes usually emphasize the latter reason; but many substitutes,\r\nwhich are, or have been, on the market, seem to depend for their\r\nexistence on the other two. Properly speaking, there are scarcely any\r\nreal substitutes for coffee. The substances used to replace it are\r\nmostly like it only in appearance, and barely simulate it in taste.\r\nBesides, many of them are not used alone, but are mixed with real coffee\r\nas adulterants.\r\n\r\nThe two main coffee substitutes are chicory and cereals. Chicory,\r\nsuccory, _Cichorium Intybus_, is a perennial plant, growing to a height\r\nof about three feet, bearing blue flowers, having a long tap root, and\r\npossessing a foliage which is sometimes used as cattle food. The plant\r\nis cultivated generally for the sake of its root, which is cut into\r\nslices, kiln-dried, and then roasted in the same manner as coffee,\r\nusually with the addition of a small proportion of some kind of fat. The\r\npreparation and use of roasted chicory originated in Holland, about\r\n1750. Fresh chicory[183] contains about 77 percent water, 7.5 gummy\r\nmatter, 1.1 of glucose, 4.0 of bitter extractive, 0.6 fat, 9.0\r\ncellulose, inulin and fiber, and 0.8 ash. Pure roasted chicory[184]\r\ncontains 74.2 percent water-soluble material, comprised of 16.3 percent\r\nwater, 26.1 glucose, 9.6 dextrin and inulin, 3.2 protein, 16.4 coloring\r\nmatter, and 2.6 ash; and 25.8 percent insoluble substances, namely, 3.2\r\npercent protein, 5.7 fat, 12.3 cellulose, and 4.6 ash. The effect of\r\nroasting upon chicory is to drive off a large percentage of water,\r\nincreasing the reducing sugars, changing a large proportion of the\r\nbitter extractives and inulin, and forming dextrin and caramel as well\r\nas the characteristic chicory flavor.\r\n\r\nThe cereal substitutes contain almost every type of grain, mainly wheat,\r\nrye, oats, buckwheat, and bran. They are prepared in two general ways,\r\nby roasting the grains, or the mixtures of grains, with or without the\r\naddition of such substances as sugar, molasses, tannin, citric acid,\r\netc., or by first making the floured grains into a dough, and then\r\nbaking, grinding, and roasting. Prior to these treatments, the grains\r\nmay be subjected to a variety of other treatments, such as impregnation\r\nwith various compounds, or germination. The effect of roasting on these\r\ngrains and other substitutes is the production of a destructive\r\ndistillation, as in the case of coffee; the crude fiber, starches, and\r\nother carbohydrates, etc., being decomposed, with the production of a\r\nflavor and an aroma faintly suggesting coffee.\r\n\r\nThe number, of other substitutes and imitations which have been employed\r\nare too numerous to warrant their complete description; but it will\r\nprove interesting to enumerate a few of the more important ones, such as\r\nmalt, starch, acorns, soya beans, beet roots, figs, prunes, date stones,\r\nivory nuts, sweet potatoes, beets, carrots, peas, and other vegetables,\r\nbananas, dried pears, grape seeds, dandelion roots, rinds of citrus\r\nfruits, lupine seeds, whey, peanuts, juniper berries, rice, the fruit of\r\nthe wax palm, cola nuts, chick peas, cassia seeds, and the seeds of any\r\ntrees and plants indigenous to the country in which the substitute is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nAside from adulteration by mixing substitutes with ground coffee, and an\r\noccasional case of factitious molded berries, the main sophistications\r\nof coffee comprise coating and coloring the whole beans. Coloring of\r\ngreen and roasted coffees is practised to conceal damaged and inferior\r\nbeans. Lead and zinc chromates, Prussian blue, ferric oxid, coal-tar\r\ncolors, and other substances of a harmful nature, have been employed for\r\nthis purpose, being made to adhere to the beans with adhesives. As\r\nglazes and coatings, a variety of substances have been employed, such as\r\nbutter, margarin, vegetable oils, paraffin, vaseline, gums, dextrin,\r\ngelatin, resins, glue, milk, glycerin, salt, sodium bicarbonate,\r\nvinegar, Irish moss, isinglass, albumen, etc. It is usually claimed that\r\ncoating is applied to retain aroma and to act as a clarifying agent; but\r\nthe real reasons are usually to increase weight through absorption of\r\nwater, to render low-grade coffees more attractive, to eliminate\r\nby-products, and to assist in advertising.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF ANALYSIS OF COFFEES[185]\r\n\r\n(_Official and Tentative_)\r\n\r\n     (Sole responsibility for any errors in compilation or printing of\r\n     these methods is assumed by the author.)\r\n\r\nGREEN COFFEE\r\n\r\n1. _Macroscopic Examination--Tentative_\r\n\r\nA macroscopic examination is usually sufficient to show the presence of\r\nexcessive amounts of black and blighted coffee beans, coffee hulls,\r\nstones, and other foreign matter. These can be separated by hand-picking\r\nand determined gravi-metrically.\r\n\r\n2. _Coloring Matters--Tentative_\r\n\r\nShake vigorously 100 grams or more of the sample with cold water or 70\r\npercent alcohol by volume. Strain through a coarse sieve and allow to\r\nsettle. Identify soluble colors in the solution and insoluble pigments\r\nin the sediment.\r\n\r\n\r\nROASTED COFFEE\r\n\r\n3. _Macroscopic Examination--Tentative_\r\n\r\nArtificial coffee beans are apparent from their exact regularity of\r\nform. Roasted legumes and lumps of chicory, when present in whole\r\nroasted coffee, can be picked out and identified microscopically. In the\r\ncase of ground coffee, sprinkle some of the sample on cold water and\r\nstir lightly. Fragments of pure coffee, if not over-roasted, will float;\r\nwhile fragments of chicory, legumes, cereals, etc., will sink\r\nimmediately, chicory coloring the water a decided brown. In all cases\r\nidentify the particles that sink by microscopical examination.\r\n\r\n4. _Preparation of Sample--Official_\r\n\r\nGrind the sample to pass through a sieve having holes 0.5 mm. in\r\ndiameter and preserve in a tightly stoppered bottle.\r\n\r\n5. _Moisture--Tentative_\r\n\r\nDry 5 grams of the sample at 105°--110°C. for 5 hours and subsequent\r\nperiods of an hour each until constant weight is obtained. The same\r\nprocedure may be used, drying _in vacuo_ at the temperature of boiling\r\nwater. In the case of whole coffee, grind rapidly to a coarse powder and\r\nweigh at once portions for the determination without sifting and without\r\nunnecessary exposure to the air.\r\n\r\n6. _Soluble Solids--Tentative_\r\n\r\nPlace 4 grams of the sample in a 200-cc. flask, add water to the mark,\r\nand allow the mass to infuse for eight hours, with occasional shaking;\r\nlet stand 16 hours longer without shaking, filter, evaporate 50 cc. of\r\nfiltrate to dryness in a flat-bottomed dish, dry at 100° C., cool and\r\nweigh.\r\n\r\n7. _Ash--Official_\r\n\r\nChar a quantity of the substance, representing about 2 grams of the dry\r\nmaterial, and burn until free of carbon at a low heat, not to exceed\r\ndull redness. If a carbon-free ash can not be obtained in this manner,\r\nexhaust the charred mass with hot water, collect the insoluble residue\r\non a filter, burn till the ash is white or nearly so, and then add the\r\nfiltrate to the ash and evaporate to dryness. Heat to low redness, until\r\nash is white or grayish white, and weigh.\r\n\r\n8. _Ash Insoluble in Acid--Official_\r\n\r\nBoil the water-insoluble residue, obtained as directed under 9, or the\r\ntotal ash obtained as directed under 7, with 25 cc. of 10-percent\r\nhydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.050) for 5 minutes, collect the insoluble\r\nmatter on a Gooch crucible or an ashless filter, wash with hot water,\r\nignite and weigh.\r\n\r\n9. _Soluble and Insoluble Ash--Official_\r\n\r\nHeat 5 to 10 grams of the sample in a platinum dish of from 50 to 100\r\ncc. capacity at 100° C. until the water is expelled, and add a few drops\r\nof pure olive oil and heat slowly over a flame until swelling ceases.\r\nThen place the dish in a muffle and heat at low redness until a white\r\nash is obtained. Add water to the ash, in the platinum dish, heat nearly\r\nto boiling, filter through ash-free filter paper, and wash with hot\r\nwater until the combined filtrate and washings measure to about 60 cc.\r\nReturn the filter and contents to the platinum dish, carefully ignite,\r\ncool and weigh. Compute percentages of water-insoluble ash and\r\nwater-soluble ash.\r\n\r\n10. _Alkalinity of the Soluble Ash--Official_\r\n\r\nCool the filtrate from 9 and titrate with N/10 hydrochloric acid, using\r\nmethyl orange as an indicator.\r\n\r\nExpress the alkalinity in terms of the number of cc. of N/10 acid per 1\r\ngram of the sample.\r\n\r\n11. _Soluble Phosphoric Acid in the Ash--Official_\r\n\r\nAcidify the solution of soluble ash, obtained in 9, with dilute nitric\r\nacid and determine phosphoric acid (P_2_O_5). For percentages up to 5\r\nuse an aliquot corresponding to 0.4 gram of substance, for percentages\r\nbetween 5 and 20 use an aliquot corresponding to 0.2 gram of substance,\r\nand for percentages above 20 use an aliquot corresponding to 0.1 gram of\r\nsubstance. Dilute to 75-100 cc., heat in a water-bath to 60°-65° C., and\r\nfor percentages below 5 add 20-25 cc. of freshly filtered molybdate\r\nsolution. For percentages between 5 and 20 add 30-35 cc. of molybdate\r\nsolution. For percentages greater than 20 add sufficient molybdate\r\nsolution to insure complete precipitation. Stir, let stand in the bath\r\nfor about 15 minutes, filter _at once_, wash once or twice with water by\r\ndecantation, using 25-30 cc. each time, agitate the precipitate\r\nthoroughly and allow to settle; transfer to the filter and wash with\r\ncold water until the filtrate from two fillings of the filter yields a\r\npink color upon the addition of phenolphthalein and one drop of the\r\nstandard alkali. Transfer the precipitate and filter to the beaker, or\r\nprecipitating vessel, dissolve the precipitate in a small excess of the\r\nstandard alkali, add a few drops of phenolphthalein solution, and\r\ntitrate with the standard acid.\r\n\r\n12. _Insoluble Phosphoric Acid in the Ash--Official_\r\n\r\nDetermine phosphoric acid (P_2_O_5) in the Insoluble ash by the\r\nforegoing method.\r\n\r\n13. _Chlorides--Official_\r\n\r\nMoisten 5 grams of the substance in a platinum dish with 20 cc. of a\r\n5-percent solution of sodium carbonate, evaporate to dryness and ignite\r\nas thoroughly as possible at a temperature not exceeding dull redness.\r\nExtract with hot water, filter and wash. Return the residue to the\r\nplatinum dish and ignite to an ash; dissolve in nitric acid, and add\r\nthis solution to the water extract. Add a known volume of N/10 silver\r\nnitrate in slight excess to the combined solutions. Stir well, filter\r\nand wash the silver chloride precipitate thoroughly. To the filtrate and\r\nwashings add 5 cc. of a saturated solution of ferric alum and a few cc.\r\nof nitric acid. Titrate the excess silver with N/10 ammonium or\r\npotassium thiocyanate until a permanent light brown color appears.\r\nCalculate the amount of chlorin.\r\n\r\n14. _Caffein--The Fendler and Stüber Method--Tentative_\r\n\r\nPulverize the coffee to pass without residue through a sieve having\r\ncircular openings 1 mm. in diameter. Treat a 10-gram sample with 10\r\ngrams of 10-percent ammonium hydroxid and 200 grams of chloroform in a\r\nglass-stoppered bottle and shake continuously by machine or hand for\r\none-half hour. Pour the entire contents of the bottle on a 12.5-cm.\r\nfolded filter, covering with a watch glass. Weigh 150 grams of the\r\nfiltrate into a 250-cc. flask and evaporate on the steam bath, removing\r\nthe last chloroform with a blast of air. Digest the residue with 80 cc.\r\nof hot water for ten minutes on a steam bath with frequent shaking, and\r\nlet cool. Treat the solution with 20 cc. (for roasted coffee) or 10 cc.\r\n(for unroasted coffee) of 1-percent potassium permanganate and let stand\r\nfor 15 minutes at room temperature. Add 2 cc. of 3-percent hydrogen\r\nperoxid (containing 1 cc. of glacial acetic acid in 100 cc.). If the\r\nliquid is still red or reddish, add hydrogen peroxid, 1 cc. at a time,\r\nuntil the excess of potassium permanganate is destroyed. Place the flask\r\non the steam bath for 15 minutes, adding hydrogen peroxid in 0.5-cc.\r\nportions until the liquid becomes no lighter in color. Cool and filter\r\ninto a separatory funnel, washing with cold water. Extract four times\r\nwith 25 cc. of chloroform. Evaporate the chloroform extract from a\r\nweighed flask with aid of an air blast and dry at 100° C. to constant\r\nweight (one-half hour is usually sufficient). Weigh the residue as\r\ncaffein and calculate on 7.5 grams of coffee. Test the purity of the\r\nresidue by determining nitrogen and multiplying by 3.464 to obtain\r\ncaffein.\r\n\r\n15. _Caffein--Power-Chestnut Method--Official_\r\n\r\nMoisten 10 grams of the finely powdered sample with alcohol, transfer to\r\na Soxhlet, or similar extraction apparatus, and extract with alcohol for\r\n8 hours. (Care should be exercised to assure complete extraction.)\r\nTransfer the extract with the aid of hot water to a porcelain dish\r\ncontaining 10 grams of heavy magnesium oxid in suspension in 100 cc. of\r\nwater. (This reagent should meet the U.S.P. requirements.) Evaporate\r\nslowly on the steam bath with frequent stirring to a dry, powdery mass.\r\nRub the residue with a pestle into a paste with boiling water. Transfer\r\nwith hot water to a smooth filter, cleaning the dish with a\r\nrubber-tipped glass rod. Collect the filtrate in a liter flask marked at\r\n250 cc. and wash with boiling water until the filtrate reaches the mark.\r\nAdd 10 cc. of 10-percent sulphuric acid and boil gently for 30 minutes\r\nwith a funnel in the neck of the flask. Cool and filter through a\r\nmoistened double paper into a separatory funnel and wash with small\r\nportions of 0.5-percent sulphuric acid. Extract with six successive\r\n25-cc. portions of chloroform. Wash the combined chloroform extracts in\r\na separatory funnel with 5 cc. of 1-percent potassium hydroxid solution.\r\nFilter the chloroform into an Erlenmeyer flask. Wash the potassium\r\nhydroxid with 2 portions of chloroform of 10 cc. each, adding them to\r\nthe flask together with the chloroform washings of the filter paper.\r\nEvaporate or distil on the steam bath to a small volume (10-15 cc.),\r\ntransfer with chloroform to a tared beaker, evaporate carefully, dry for\r\n30 minutes in a water oven, and weigh. The purity of the residue can be\r\ntested by determining nitrogen and multiplying by the factor 3.464.\r\n\r\n16. _Crude Fiber--Official_\r\n\r\nPrepare solutions of sulphuric acid and sodium hydroxid of exactly\r\n1.25-percent strength, determined by titration. Extract a quantity of\r\nthe substance representing about 2 grams of the dry material with\r\nordinary ether, or use residue from the determination of the ether\r\nextract. To this residue in a 500-cc. flask add 200 cc. of boiling\r\n1.25-percent sulphuric acid; connect the flask with a reflux condenser,\r\nthe tube of which passes only a short distance beyond the rubber stopper\r\ninto the flask, or simply cover a tall conical flask, which is well\r\nsuited for this determination, with a watch glass or short stemmed\r\nfunnel. Boil at once and continue boiling gently for thirty minutes. A\r\nblast of air conducted into the flask may serve to reduce the frothing\r\nof the liquid. Filter through linen, and wash with boiling water until\r\nthe washings are no longer acid; rinse the substance back into the flask\r\nwith 200 cc. of the boiling 1.25-percent solution of sodium hydroxid\r\nfree, or nearly so, of sodium carbonate; boil at once and continue\r\nboiling gently for thirty minutes in the same manner as directed above\r\nfor the treatment with acid. Filter at once rapidly, wash with boiling\r\nwater until the washings are neutral. The last filtration may be\r\nperformed upon a Gooch crucible, a linen filter, or a tared filter\r\npaper. If a linen filter is used, rinse the crude fiber, after washing\r\nis completed, into a flat-bottomed platinum dish by means of a jet of\r\nwater; evaporate to dryness on a steam bath, dry to constant weight at\r\n110° C., weigh, incinerate completely, and weigh again. The loss in\r\nweight is considered to be crude fiber. If a tared filter paper is used,\r\nweigh in a weighing bottle. In any case, the crude fiber after drying to\r\nconstant weight at 110° C., must be incinerated and the amount of the\r\nash deducted from the original weight.\r\n\r\n17. _Starch--Tentative_\r\n\r\nExtract 5 grams of the finely pulverized sample on a hardened filter\r\nwith five successive portions (10 cc. each) of ether, wash with small\r\nportions of 95-percent alcohol by volume until a total of 200 cc. have\r\npassed through, place the residue in a beaker with 50 cc. of water,\r\nimmerse the beaker in boiling water and stir constantly for 15 minutes\r\nor until all the starch is gelatinized; cool to 55° C., add 20 cc. of\r\nmalt extract and maintain at this temperature for an hour. Heat again to\r\nboiling for a few minutes, cool to 55° C., add 20 cc. of malt extract\r\nand maintain at this temperature for an hour or until the residue\r\ntreated with iodin shows no blue color upon microscopic examination.\r\nCool, make up directly to 250 cc., and filter. Place 200 cc. of the\r\nfiltrate in a flask with 20 cc. of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.125);\r\nconnect with a reflux condenser and heat in a boiling water bath for 2.5\r\nhours. Cool, nearly neutralize with sodium hydroxid solution, and make\r\nup to 500 cc. Mix the solution well, pour through a dry filter and\r\ndetermine the dextrose in an aliquot. Conduct a blank determination upon\r\nthe same volume of the malt extract as used upon the sample, and correct\r\nthe weight of reduced copper accordingly. The weight of the dextrose\r\nobtained multiplied by 0.90 gives the weight of starch.\r\n\r\n18. _Sugars--Tentative_\r\n\r\nSee original.[186]\r\n\r\n19. _Petroleum Ether Extract--Official_\r\n\r\nDry 2 grams of coffee at 100° C., extract with petroleum ether (boiling\r\npoint 35° to 50° C.) for 16 hours, evaporate the solvent, dry the\r\nresidue at 100° C., cool, and weigh.\r\n\r\n20. _Total Acidity--Tentative_\r\n\r\nTreat 10 grams of the sample, prepared as directed under 4, with 75 cc.\r\nof 80-percent alcohol by volume in an Erlenmeyer flask, stopper, and\r\nallow to stand 16 hours, shaking occasionally. Filter and transfer an\r\naliquot of the filtrate (25 cc. in the case of green coffee, 10 cc. in\r\nthe case of roasted coffee) to a beaker, dilute to about 100 cc. with\r\nwater and titrate with N/10 alkali, using phenolphthalein as an\r\nindicator. Express the result as the number of cc. of N/10 alkali\r\nrequired to neutralize the acidity of 100 grams of the sample.\r\n\r\n21. _Volatile Acidity--Tentative_\r\n\r\nInto a volatile acid apparatus introduce a few glass beads, and over\r\nthese place 20 grams of the unground sample. Add 100 cc. of recently\r\nboiled water to the sample, place a sufficient quantity of recently\r\nboiled water in the outer flask and distil until the distillate is no\r\nlonger acid to litmus paper. Usually 100 cc. of distillate will be\r\ncollected. Titrate the distillate with N/10 alkali, using\r\nphenolphthalein as an indicator. Express the result as the number of cc.\r\nof N/10 alkali required to neutralize the acidity of 100 grams of the\r\nsample.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNOFFICIAL METHODS\r\n\r\n22. _Protein_\r\n\r\nDetermine nitrogen in 3 grams of the sample by the Kjeldahl or Gunning\r\nmethod. This gives the total nitrogen due to both the proteids and the\r\ncaffein. To obtain the protein nitrogen, subtract from the total\r\nnitrogen the nitrogen due to caffein, obtained by direct determination\r\non the separated caffein or by calculation (caffein divided by 3.464\r\ngives nitrogen). Multiply by 6.25 to obtain the amount of protein.\r\n\r\n23. _Ten Percent Extract--McGill Method_\r\n\r\nWeigh into a tared flask the equivalent of 10 grains of the dried\r\nsubstance, add water until the contents of the flask weigh 110 grams,\r\nconnect with a reflux condenser and heat, beginning the boiling in 10 to\r\n15 minutes. Boil for 1 hour, cool for 15 minutes, weigh again, making up\r\nany loss by the addition of water, filter, and take the specific gravity\r\nof the filtrate at 15° C.\r\n\r\nAccording to McGill, a 10-percent extract of pure coffee has a specific\r\ngravity of 1.00986 at 15° C., and under the same treatment chicory gives\r\nan extract with a specific gravity of 1.02821. In mixtures of coffee and\r\nchicory the approximate percentage of chicory may be calculated by the\r\nfollowing formula:\r\n\r\n                         (1.02821 - sp. gr.)\r\nPercent of chicory = 100 ------------------\r\n                             0.01835\r\n\r\nThe index of refraction of the above solution may be taken with the\r\nZeiss immersion refractometer or with the Abbe refractometer.\r\n\r\nWith a 10-percent coffee extract, n_d 20° = 1.3377.\r\n\r\nWith a 10-percent chicory extract, n_d 20° = 1.3448.\r\n\r\nDeterminations of the solids, ash, sugar, nitrogen, etc., may be made in\r\nthe 10-percent extract, if desired.\r\n\r\n24. _Caffetannic Acid--Krug's Method_[187]\r\n\r\nTreat 2 grains of the coffee with 10 cc. of water and digest for 36\r\nhours; add 25 cc. of 90-percent alcohol and digest 24 hours more,\r\nfilter, and wash with 90-percent alcohol. The filtrate contains tannin,\r\ncaffein, color, and fat. Heat the filtrate to the boiling point and add\r\na saturated solution of lead acetate. If this is carefully done, a\r\ncaffetannate of lead will be precipitated containing 49 percent of lead.\r\nAs soon as the precipitate has become flocculent, collect on a tared\r\nfilter, wash with 90-percent alcohol until free from lead, wash with\r\nether, dry and weigh. The precipitate multiplied by 0.51597 gives the\r\nweight of the caffetannic acid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nPHARMACOLOGY OF THE COFFEE DRINK\r\n\r\n     _General physiological action--Effect on children--Effect on\r\n     longevity--Behavior in the alimentary régime--Place in\r\n     dietary--Action on bacteria--Use in medicine--Physiological action\r\n     of \"caffetannic acid\"--Of caffeol--Of caffein--Effect of caffein on\r\n     mental and motor efficiency--Conclusions_\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Charles W. Trigg\r\n\r\nIndustrial Fellow of the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research,\r\nPittsburgh, 1916-1920\r\n\r\n\r\nThe published information regarding the effects of coffee drinking on\r\nthe human system is so contradictory in its nature that it is hazardous\r\nto make many generalizations about the physiological behavior of coffee.\r\nMost of the investigations that have been conducted to date have been\r\ncharacterized by incompleteness and a failure to be sufficiently\r\ncomprehensive to eliminate the element of individual idiosyncrasy from\r\nthe results obtained. Accordingly, it is possible to select statements\r\nfrom literature to the effect either that coffee is an \"elixir of life,\"\r\nor even a poison.\r\n\r\nThis is a deplorable state of affairs, not calculated to promote the\r\ndissemination of accurate knowledge among the consuming public, but it\r\nmay be partly excused upon the grounds that experimental apparatus has\r\nnot always been at the level of perfection that it now occupies. Also,\r\nto do justice to some of the able men who have interested themselves in\r\nthis problem, it should be said that some of their results were obtained\r\nin researches, distinguished by painstaking accuracy, which have\r\neffected the establishment of the major reactions of ingested coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Physiological Action of Coffee_\r\n\r\nDrinking of coffee by mankind may be attributed to three causes: the\r\ndemand for, and the pleasing effects of, a hot drink (a very small\r\npercentage of the coffee consumed is taken cold), the pleasing reaction\r\nwhich its flavors excite on the gustatory nerve, and the stimulating\r\neffect which it has upon the body. The flavor is due largely to the\r\nvolatile aromatic constituents, \"caffeol,\" which, when isolated, have a\r\ngeneral depressant action on the system; and the stimulation is caused\r\nby the caffein. The general and specific actions of these individual\r\ncomponents, together with that of the hypothetical \"caffetannic acid,\"\r\nare considered under separate headings.\r\n\r\nCoffee may be considered a member of the general class of adjuvant, or\r\nauxiliary, foods to which other beverages and condiments of negligible\r\ninherent food value belong. Its position on the average menu may be\r\nattributed largely to its palatability and comforting effects. However,\r\nthe medicinal value of coffee in the dietary and _per se_ must not be\r\noverlooked.\r\n\r\nThe ingestion of coffee infusion is always followed by evidences of\r\nstimulation. It acts upon the nervous system as a powerful\r\ncerebro-spinal stimulant, increasing mental activity and quickening the\r\npower of perception, thus making the thoughts more precise and clear,\r\nand intellectual work easier without any evident subsequent depression.\r\nThe muscles are caused to contract more vigorously, increasing their\r\nworking power without there being any secondary reaction leading to a\r\ndiminished capacity for work. Its action upon the circulation is\r\nsomewhat antagonistic; for while it tends to increase the rate of the\r\nheart by acting directly on the heart muscle, it tends to decrease it by\r\nstimulating the inhibitory center in the medulla.[188]\r\n\r\nThe effect on the kidneys is more marked, the diuretic effect being\r\nshown by an increase in water, soluble solids, and of uric acid directly\r\nattributable to the caffein content of the coffee taken. In the\r\nalimentary tract coffee seems to stimulate the oxyntic cells and\r\nslightly to increase the secretion of hydrochloric acid, as well as to\r\nfavor intestinal peristalsis. It is difficult to accept reports of\r\ncoffee accomplishing both a decrease in metabolism and an increase in\r\nbody heat; but if the production of heat by the demethylation of caffein\r\nto form uric acid and a possible repression of perspiration by coffee be\r\nconsidered, the simultaneous occurrence of these two physiological\r\nreactions may be credited.\r\n\r\nThe disagreement of medical authorities over the physiological effects\r\nof coffee is quite pronounced. This may be observed by a careful perusal\r\nof the following statements made by these men. It will be noticed that\r\nthe majority opinion is that coffee in moderation is not harmful. Just\r\nhow much coffee a person may drink, and still remain within the limits\r\nof moderation and temperance, is dependent solely upon the individual\r\nconstitution, and should be decided from personal experience rather than\r\nby accepting an arbitrary standard set by some one who professes to be\r\nan authority on the matter.\r\n\r\nA writer in the _British Homeopathic Review_[189] says that \"the\r\nexciting effects of coffee upon the nervous system exhibit themselves in\r\nall its departments as a temporary exaltation. The emotions are raised\r\nin pitch, the fancies are lively and vivid, benevolence is excited, the\r\nreligious sense is stimulated, there is great loquacity.... The\r\nintellectual powers are stimulated, both memory and judgment are\r\nrendered more keen and unusual vivacity of verbal expression rules for a\r\nshort time.\" He continues:\r\n\r\n     Hahnemann gives a characteristically careful account of the coffee\r\n     headache. If the quantity of coffee taken be immoderately great and\r\n     the body be very excitable and quite unused to coffee, there occurs\r\n     a semilateral headache from the upper part of the parietal bone to\r\n     the base of the brain. The cerebral membranes of this side also\r\n     seem to be painfully sensitive, the hands and feet becoming cold,\r\n     and sweat appears on the brows and palms. The disposition becomes\r\n     irritable and intolerant, anxiety, trembling and restlessness are\r\n     apparent.... I have met with headaches of this type which yielded\r\n     readily to coffee and with many more in which the indicated remedy\r\n     failed to act until the use of coffee as a beverage was abandoned.\r\n     The eyes and ears suffer alike from the super-excitation of coffee.\r\n     There is a characteristic toothache associated with coffee.\r\n\r\nIn apparent contradiction of this opinion, Dr. Valentin Nalpasse,[190]\r\nof the Faculty of Medicine of Paris, states:\r\n\r\n     When coffee is properly made and taken in moderation, it is a most\r\n     valuable drink. It facilitates the digestion because it produces a\r\n     local excitement. Its principal action gives clear and stable\r\n     imaginative power to the brain. By doing that, it makes\r\n     intellectual work easy, and, to a certain extent, regulates the\r\n     functions of the brain. The thoughts become more precise and clear,\r\n     and mental combinations are formed with much greater rapidity.\r\n     Under the influence of coffee, the memory is sometimes surprisingly\r\n     active, and ideas and words flow with ease and elegance.... Many\r\n     people abuse coffee without feeling any bad effect.\r\n\r\nDiscussing the use and abuse of coffee, I.N. Love[191] says:\r\n\r\n     The world has in the infusion of coffee one of its most valuable\r\n     beverages. It is a prompt diffusible stimulant, antiseptic and\r\n     encourager of elimination. In season it supports, tides over\r\n     danger, helps the appropriate powers of the system, whips up the\r\n     flagging energies, enhances the endurance; but it is in no sense a\r\n     food, and for this reason it should be used temperately.\r\n\r\nAlso Dr. Jonathan Hutchinson[192] makes the following weighty\r\npronouncement:\r\n\r\n     In reference to my suggestion to give children tea and coffee. I\r\n     may explain that it is done advisedly. There is probably no\r\n     objection to their use even at early ages. They arouse the dull,\r\n     calm the excitable, prevent headaches, and fit the brain for work.\r\n     They preserve the teeth, keep them tight in their place, strengthen\r\n     the vocal chords, and prevent sore throat. To stigmatize these\r\n     invaluable articles of diet as \"nerve stimulants\" is an erroneous\r\n     expression, for they undoubtedly have a right to rank as nerve\r\n     nutrients.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Harvey Wiley[193] comes forth with evidence on the other side,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n     The effects of the excessive use of coffee, tea, and other natural\r\n     caffein beverages is well known. Although the caffein is combined\r\n     in these beverages naturally, and they are as a rule taken at meal\r\n     times, which mitigates the effects of the caffein, they are\r\n     recognized by every one as tending to produce sleeplessness, and\r\n     often indigestion, stomach disorders, and a condition which, for\r\n     lack of a better term, is described as nervousness.... The\r\n     excessive drinking of tea and coffee is acknowledged to be\r\n     injurious by practically all specialists.\r\n\r\nDr. V.C. Vaughn,[194] of the University of Michigan, speaking of tea and\r\ncoffee, expresses this opinion:\r\n\r\n     I believe that caffein used as a beverage and in moderation not\r\n     only is harmless to the majority of adults, but is beneficial.\r\n\r\nThis verdict is upheld by the results of a symposium[195] conducted by\r\nthe _Medical Times_, in which a large majority of the medical experts\r\nparticipating, among whom may be enumerated Drs. Lockwood, Wood,\r\nHollingworth, Robinson, and Barnes, agreed that the drinking of coffee\r\nis not harmful _per se_, but that over-indulgence is the real cause of\r\nany ill effects. This is also true of any ingested material.\r\n\r\nInsomnia is a condition frequently attributed to coffee, but that the\r\nauthorities disagree on this ground is shown by Wiley's[196] contention,\r\n\"We know beyond doubt that the caffein (in coffee) makes a direct attack\r\non the nerves and causes insomnia.\" While Woods Hutchinson[197]\r\nobserves:\r\n\r\n     Oddly enough, a cup of hot, weak tea or coffee, with plenty of\r\n     cream and sugar, will often help you to sleep, for the grateful\r\n     warmth and stimulus to the lining of the stomach, drawing the blood\r\n     into it and away from the head, will produce more soothing effects\r\n     than the small amount of caffein will produce stimulating and\r\n     wakeful ones.\r\n\r\nThe writer has often had people remark to him that while black coffee\r\nsometimes kept them awake, coffee with cream or sugar or both made them\r\ndrowsy.\r\n\r\nIn the course of experiments conducted by Montuori and Pollitzer[198] it\r\nwas found that coffee prepared by hot infusion when given by mouth or\r\nhypodermically with the addition of a small dose of alcohol proved an\r\nefficient means of combating the pernicious effects of low temperatures.\r\nCoffee prepared by boiling, and tea, showed negative effects.\r\n\r\nThe value of coffee as a strength-conserver, and its function of\r\nincreasing endurance, morale, and healthfulness, was demonstrated by the\r\ngreat stress which the military authorities, in the late and in previous\r\nwars, placed upon furnishing the soldiers with plenty of good coffee,\r\nparticularly at times when they were under the greatest strain. Various\r\narticles[199] record this fact; and these statements are further borne\r\nout by the data given below in the discussion of the physiological\r\neffects of caffein, to which the majority of the stimulating effects of\r\ncoffee may be attributed.\r\n\r\nAccording to Fauvel,[200] with a healthy patient on a vegetable diet,\r\nchocolate and coffee increase the excretion of purins, diminishing the\r\nexcretion of uric acid and apparently hindering the precipitation of\r\nuric acid in the organism. This diminution, however, was not due to\r\nretention of uric acid in the organism.\r\n\r\n\"Habit-forming\" is one of the adjectives often used in describing\r\ncoffee, but it is a fact that coffee is much less likely than alcoholic\r\nliquors to cause ill effects. A man rarely becomes a slave of coffee;\r\nand excessive drinking of this beverage never produces a state of moral\r\nirresponsibility or leads to the commission of crime. Dr. J.W.\r\nMallet,[201] in testimony given before a Federal Court, stated that\r\ncaffein and coffee were not habit-forming in the correct sense of the\r\nterm. His definition of the expression is that the habit formed must be\r\na detrimental and injurious one--one which becomes so firmly fixed upon\r\na person forming it that it is thrown off with great difficulty and with\r\nconsiderable suffering, continuous exercise of the habit increasing the\r\ndemand for the habit-forming drug. It is well known that the desire\r\nceases in a very short period of time after cessation of use of\r\ncaffein-containing beverages, so that in that sense, coffee is not\r\nhabit-forming.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEN AND WOMEN LABORERS PICKING COFFEE ON A SÃO PAULO\r\nESTATE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SACKING COFFEE IN A WAREHOUSE AT THE PORT OF SANTOS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PICKING AND SACKING COFFEE IN BRAZIL]\r\n\r\nIt has been shown by Gourewitsch[202] that the daily administration of\r\ncoffee produces a certain degree of tolerance, and that the doses must\r\nbe increased to obtain toxic results. Harkness[203] has been quoted as\r\nstating that \"taken in moderation; coffee is one of the most wholesome\r\nbeverages known. It assists digestion, exhilarates the spirits, and\r\ncounteracts the tendency to sleep.\" Carl V. Voit,[204] the German\r\nphysiological chemist, says this about coffee:\r\n\r\n\r\n     The effect of coffee is that we are bothered less by unpleasant\r\n     experiences and become more able to conquer difficulties;\r\n     therefore, for the feasting rich, it makes intestinal work after a\r\n     meal less evident and drives away the deadly ennui; for the student\r\n     it is a means to keep wide awake and fresh; for the worker it makes\r\n     the day's fatigue more bearable.\r\n\r\nDr. Brady[205] believes that the so-called harmfulness of coffee is\r\nmainly psychological, as evidenced by his expression, \"Most of the\r\nprejudice which exists against coffee as a beverage is based upon\r\nnothing more than morbid fancy. People of dyspeptic or neurotic\r\ntemperament are fond of assuming that coffee must be bad because it is\r\nso good, and accordingly, denying themselves the pleasure of drinking\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nThe recounting of evidence, both _pro_ and _con_, relevant to the\r\ngeneral effects of coffee could continue almost _ad infinitum_, but the\r\nfairest unification of the various opinions is best quoted from Woods\r\nHutchinson[206]:\r\n\r\n     Somewhere from 1 to 3 percent of the community are distinctly\r\n     injured or poisoned by tea or coffee, even small amounts producing\r\n     burning of the stomach, palpitation of the heart, headache,\r\n     eruptions of the skin, sensations of extreme nervousness, and so\r\n     on; though the remaining 97 percent are not injured by them in any\r\n     appreciable way if consumed in moderation.\r\n\r\nSo, if one is personally satisfied that he belongs to the abnormal\r\nminority, and has not been argued by fallacious reasoning into his\r\nbelief that coffee injures him, he should either reduce his consumption\r\nof coffee or let it alone. Even those most vitally interested in the\r\ncommercial side of coffee will admit that this is the logical procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Effects of Coffee on Children_\r\n\r\nThe same sort of controversy has raged around the question of the\r\nadvisability of giving coffee to children as has occurred regarding its\r\ngeneral action. Dr. J. Hutchinson[207] advocates furnishing children\r\nwith coffee, while Dr. Charlotte Abbey[208] is strongly against such a\r\npractise, claiming that use of caffein-containing beverages before the\r\nattainment of full growth will weaken nerve power. Nalpasse[209]\r\nobserves that until fully developed the young are immoderately excited\r\nby coffee; and Hawk[210] is of the opinion that to give such a stimulant\r\nto an active school-child is both logically and dietetically incorrect.\r\nDr. Vaughn[211] advances this scientific argument against the drinking\r\nof coffee by children under seven years of age:\r\n\r\n     In proportion to body weight the young contain more of the xanthin\r\n     bases than adults. They are already laden with these physiological\r\n     stimulants, and the additional dose given in tea or coffee may be\r\n     harmful.\r\n\r\nIn a study of the effects of coffee drinking upon 464 school children,\r\nC.K. Taylor[212] found a slight difference in mental ability and\r\nbehavior, unfavorable to coffee. About 29 percent of these children\r\ndrank no coffee; 46 percent drank a cup a day; 12 percent, 2 cups; 8\r\npercent, 3 cups; and the remainder, 4 or more cups a day. The\r\nmeasurements of height, weight, and hand strength also showed a slight\r\nadvantage in favor of the non-coffee drinkers. If these results be taken\r\nas truly representative, their indication is obvious. However, it seems\r\ndesirable to repeat these experiments upon other groups; at the same\r\ntime noting carefully the factors of environment, and other diet, before\r\nany criterion is made.\r\n\r\nAs a refutation to this experimental evidence is the practical\r\nexperience of the inhabitants of the Island of Groix, off the Brittany\r\ncoast, whose annual consumption of coffee is nearly 30 pounds per\r\ncapita, being ingested both as the roasted bean and as an infusion. It\r\nis reported that many of the children are nourished almost entirely on\r\ncoffee soup up to ten years of age, yet the mentality and physique of\r\nthe populace does not fall below that of others of the same stock and\r\neducational opportunities.[213]\r\n\r\nPertinent in this connection is Hawk's[214] statement that young mothers\r\nshould refrain from the use of coffee, as caffein stimulates the action\r\nof the kidneys and tends to bring about a loss from the body of some of\r\nthe salts necessary to the development of the unborn child as well as\r\nfor the proper production of milk during the nursing period. The caffein\r\nof coffee also increases the flow of milk, but the milk produced is\r\ncorrespondingly dilute and a later decreased secretion may be expected.\r\nFurthermore, some of the caffein of the coffee may pass into the\r\nmother's milk, thus reaching the child, so that the use of coffee during\r\nthe nursing period is undesirable on this ground also. Naturally, the\r\nquestion arises as to whether this arraignment is purely theoretical or\r\nbased upon analytical and clinical data.\r\n\r\nIt is a difficult matter definitely to set an age below which coffee\r\nshould not be drunk, as the time of reaching maturity varies with\r\nclimate and ancestral origin. Yet, from a theoretical standpoint,\r\nchildren before or during the adolescent period should be limited to the\r\nuse of a rather small amount of tea and coffee as beverages, as their\r\npoise and nerve control have not reached a stage of development\r\nsufficient to warrant the stimulation incident to the consumption of an\r\nappreciable quantity of caffein.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Drinking and Longevity_\r\n\r\nThere are many who would have us believe that the use of coffee is only\r\na means toward the end of quickly reaching the great beyond; but it is\r\nknown that the habitual coffee drinker generally enjoys good health, and\r\nsome of the longest-lived people have used it from their earliest youth\r\nwithout any apparent injury to their health. Nearly every one has an\r\nacquaintance who has lived to a ripe old age despite the use of coffee.\r\nQuoting Metchnikoff[215]:\r\n\r\n     In some cases centenarians have been much addicted to the drinking\r\n     of coffee. The reader will recall Voltaire's reply when his doctor\r\n     described the grave harm that comes from the abuse of coffee, which\r\n     acts as a real poison. \"Well\", said Voltaire, \"I have been\r\n     poisoning myself for nearly eighty years.\" There are centenarians\r\n     who have lived longer than Voltaire and have drunk still more\r\n     coffee. Elizabeth Durieux, a native of Savoy, reached the age of\r\n     114. Her principal food was coffee, of which she took daily as many\r\n     as forty small cups. She was jovial and a boon table companion, and\r\n     used black coffee in quantities that would have surprised an Arab.\r\n     Her coffee-pot was always on the fire, like the tea-pot in an\r\n     English cottage (Lejoncourt, p. 84; Chemin, p. 147).\r\n\r\nThe entire matter resolves itself into one of individual tolerance,\r\nresistivity, and constitution. Numerous examples of young abstainers who\r\nhave died and coffee drinkers who have still lived on can be found, and\r\n_vice versa_, the preponderance of instances being in neither direction.\r\nBodies of persons killed by accident have been painstakingly examined\r\nfor physiological changes attributable to coffee; but no difference\r\nbetween those of coffee and of non-coffee drinkers (ascertained by\r\ncareful investigation of their life history) could be discerned.[216] In\r\nthe long run, it is safe to say that the effect of coffee drinking upon\r\nthe prolongation or shortening of life is neutral.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee in the Alimentary Tract_\r\n\r\nWhen coffee is taken _per os_ it passes directly to the stomach, where\r\nits sole immediate action is to dilute the previous contents, just as\r\nother ingested liquids do. Eventually the caffein content is absorbed by\r\nthe system, and from thence on a stimulation is apparent. Considerable\r\nconjecture has occurred over the difference in the effects of tea and\r\ncoffee, the most feasible explanation advanced being one appearing in\r\nthe London _Lancet_.[217]\r\n\r\n     The caffein tannate of tea is precipitated by weak acids, and the\r\n     presumption is that it is precipitated by the gastric juice and,\r\n     therefore, the caffein is probably not absorbed until it reaches\r\n     the alkaline alimentary tract. In the case of coffee, however, in\r\n     whatever form the caffein may be present, it is soluble in both\r\n     alkaline and acid fluids, and, therefore, the absorption of the\r\n     alkaloid probably takes place in the stomach.\r\n\r\nThis theory, if true, goes far toward explaining the more rapid\r\nstimulation of coffee.\r\n\r\nThe statement has sometimes been made that milk or cream causes the\r\ncoffee liquid to become coagulated when it comes into contact with the\r\nacids of the stomach. This is true, but does not carry with it the\r\ninference that indigestibility accompanies this coagulation. Milk and\r\ncream, upon reaching the stomach, are coagulated by the gastric juice;\r\nbut the casein product formed is not indigestible. These liquids, when\r\nadded to coffee, are partially acted upon by the small acid content of\r\nthe brew, so that the gastric juice action is not so pronounced, for the\r\ncoagulation was started before ingestion, and the coagulable\r\nconstituent, casein, is more dilute in the cup as consumed than it is in\r\nmilk. Accordingly, the particles formed by it in the stomach will be\r\nrelatively smaller and more quickly and easily digested than milk _per\r\nse_. It has been observed that coffee containing milk or cream is not as\r\nstimulating as black coffee. The writer believes that this is probably\r\ndue to mechanical inclusion of caffein in the casein and fat particles,\r\nand also to some adsorption of the alkaloid by them. This would\r\nmaterially retard the absorption of the caffein by the body, spread the\r\naction over a longer period of time, and hence decrease the maximum\r\nstimulation attained.\r\n\r\nIn a few instances, a small fraction of one percent of coffee users,\r\nthere is a certain type of distress, localized chiefly in the alimentary\r\ntract, caused by coffee, which can not be blamed upon the much-maligned\r\ncaffein. The irritating elements may be generally classified as\r\ncompounds formed upon the addition of cream or milk to the coffee\r\nliquor, volatile constituents, and products formed by hydrolysis of the\r\nfibrous part of the grounds. It may be generally postulated that the\r\nmain causation of this discomfort is due to substances formed in the\r\nincorrect brewing of coffee, the effect of which is accentuated by the\r\naddition of cream or milk, when the condition of individual idiosyncrasy\r\nis present.\r\n\r\nWithout enlarging upon his reason, Lorand[218] concludes that neither\r\ntea nor coffee is advisable for weak stomachs. Nalpasse,[219] however,\r\nbelieves that coffee taken after meals makes the digestion more perfect\r\nand more rapid, augmenting the secretions, and that it agrees equally\r\nwell with people inclined to embonpoint and heavy eaters whose digestion\r\nis slow and difficult. Thompson[220] also observes that coffee drunk in\r\nmoderation is a mild stimulant to gastric digestion.\r\n\r\nEder[221] reported, as the result of an inquiry into the action of\r\ncoffee on the activity of the stomachs of ruminants, that coffee\r\ninfusions produced a transitory increase in the number and intensity of\r\nthe movements of the paunch, but that the influence exercised was very\r\nirregular.\r\n\r\nAn elaborate investigation of the action of tea and coffee on digestion\r\nin the stomach was made by Fraser,[222] in which he found that both\r\nretard peptic digestion, the former to a greater degree than the latter.\r\nThe digestion of white of egg, ham, salt beef, and roast beef was much\r\nless affected than that of lamb, fowl, or bread. Coffee seemed actually\r\nto aid the digestion of egg and ham. He attributed the retarding effect\r\nto the tannic acid of the tea and the volatile constituents of the\r\ncoffee--the caffein itself favoring digestion rather than otherwise. Tea\r\nincreased the production of gas in all but salt foods, whereas coffee\r\ndid not. Coffee is, therefore, to be preferred in cases of flatulent\r\ndyspepsia.\r\n\r\nHutchinson, in his _Food and Dietetics_, opines:\r\n\r\n     As regards the practical inferences to be drawn from experiences\r\n     and observations, it may be said that in health the disturbance of\r\n     digestion produced by the infused beverages (tea and coffee) is\r\n     negligible. Roberts, indeed, goes so far as to suggest that the\r\n     slight slowing of digestion which they produce may be favored\r\n     rather than otherwise, as tending to compensate for too rapid\r\n     digestibility which refinements of manufacture and preparation have\r\n     made characteristic of modern foods.\r\n\r\nRegarding increase in secretory activity, Moore and Allanston[223]\r\nreport that in their experience meat extracts, tea, caffein solution,\r\nand coffee call forth a greater gastric secretion than does water, while\r\nwith milk the flow of gastric juice seems to be retarded. Cushing[224]\r\nand others support this statement. This action is partially explained by\r\nVoit on the grounds that all tasty foods increase gastric secretion, the\r\naction being partly psychological; but Cushing observed the same effects\r\nupon introducing coffee directly into the stomachs of animals.\r\n\r\nIn general, a moderate amount of coffee stimulates appetite, improves\r\ndigestion and relieves the sense of plenitude in the stomach. It\r\nincreases intestinal peristalsis, acts as a mild laxative, and slightly\r\nstimulates secretion of bile. Excessive use, however, profoundly\r\ndisturbs digestive function, and promotes constipation and\r\nhemorrhoids.[225] There is much evidence to support the view that\r\n\"neither tea, coffee, nor chicory in dilute solutions has any\r\ndeleterious action on the digestive ferments, although in strong\r\nsolutions such an action may be manifest.\"[226] After conducting\r\nexhaustive experiments with various types of coffee, Lehmann[227]\r\nconcluded that ordinary coffee is without effect on the digestion of the\r\nmajority of sound persons, and may be used with impunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee in the Dietary--Food Value_\r\n\r\nThere are three things to be considered in deciding upon the inclusion\r\nof a substance in the dietary--palatability, digestibility without\r\ntoxicity or disarrangement, and calorific value. Coffee is as\r\nsatisfactory from these viewpoints as any other food product.\r\n\r\nThe palatability of a well-made cup of good coffee needs no eulogizing;\r\nit speaks for itself. It adds enormously to the attractiveness of the\r\nmeal, and to our ability to eat with relish and appetite large amounts\r\nof solid foods, without a subsequent uncomfortable feeling. Wiley[228]\r\nsays that the feeling of drowsiness after a full meal is a natural\r\ncondition incidental to the proper conduct of digestion, and that to\r\ndrive away this natural feeling with coffee must be an interference with\r\nthe normal condition. However, if by so doing, we can increase our\r\nover-all efficiency without material harm to our digestive organs (and\r\nwe can and do), the procedure has much in its favor both psychologically\r\nand dietetically.\r\n\r\nThe fact that coffee favors digestion without eventual disarrangement\r\nhas been demonstrated above. On the subject of the relative agreement\r\nwith the constitution of foods of daily consumption, Dr. English[229]\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     It is well known that there is no species of diet which invariably\r\n     suits all constitutions, nor will that which is palatable and\r\n     salutary at one time be equally palatable and salutary at another\r\n     time to the same individual. I think the most natural food provided\r\n     for us is milk; yet I will engage to show twenty instances where\r\n     milk disagrees more than coffee.\r\n\r\nFurther in this regard, Hutchinson[230] considers that ninety percent of\r\nthe \"dyspepsias\" attributed to coffee are due to malnutrition, or to\r\nfood simultaneously ingested, no disease known to the medical profession\r\nbeing directly attributable to it.\r\n\r\nNo one cognizant of the facts will contend that a cup of black coffee\r\nhas any direct food value; but not so with the roasted bean. This has\r\nquite an appreciable content of protein and fat, both substances of high\r\ncalorific value. The inhabitants of the Island of Groix eat the whole\r\nroasted coffee bean in considerable quantity, and seem to obtain\r\nconsiderable nourishment therefrom. Also, the Galla, a wandering tribe\r\nof Africa, make large use of food balls, about the size of billiard\r\nballs, consisting of pulverized coffee held in shape with fat. One ball\r\nis said to contain a day's ration; and, because of its food content and\r\nstimulating power, serves to sustain them on long marches of days'\r\nduration.\r\n\r\nWhen an infusion, or decoction, of roasted coffee is made, about 1.25\r\npercent of the extracted matter is protein, it being accompanied by\r\ntraces of dextrin and sugar. The same dearth of extraction of food\r\nmaterials occurs upon infusing coffee substitutes. This small amount can\r\nhave but little dietetic significance. However, upon addition of sugar\r\nand of milk or cream, with their content of protein, fat, and lactose,\r\nthe calorific value of the cup of coffee rises. Lusk and Gephart[231]\r\ngive the food value of an ordinary restaurant cup of coffee as 195.5\r\ncalories, and Locke[232] gives it as 156.\r\n\r\nMattei[233] found that 8 cc. of an infusion of roasted Mocha coffee of\r\nfive-percent strength suppressed incipient polyneuritis in pigeons\r\nwithin a few hours' time. Their weight did not improve, but otherwise\r\nthey were completely restored to health. However, in from four to six\r\nweeks after the apparent cure, the symptoms rapidly returned and the\r\npigeons perished, with symptoms of paralysis and cerebral complications.\r\nThe temporary cure was probably due to caffein stimulation and secondary\r\nactions of the volatile constituents of coffee, which may be related to\r\nthe vitamines; for it is not likely that the vitamines would withstand\r\nthe heat of roasting. If B-vitamine does occur in roasted coffee, it is\r\npresent only in traces.[234]\r\n\r\nThe inclusion of coffee in the average dietary is warranted because of\r\nits evident worth as an aid to digestion and for its assimilating power,\r\nthus earning its characterization as an \"adjuvant food.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Action of Coffee on Bacteria_\r\n\r\nThe employment of coffee as an aid to sanitation has been but little\r\nconsidered. Coffee, when freshly roasted and ground, is deodorant,\r\nantiseptic, and germicidal, probably due to the empyreumatic products\r\ndeveloped during the process of roasting. An infusion of 0.5 percent\r\ninhibits the growth of many pathogenic organisms, and those of 10\r\npercent kill anthrax bacteria in three hours, cholera spirilla in four\r\nhours, and many other bacteria, including those producing typhoid, in\r\ntwo to six days.[235]\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of a low rate of contraction of typhoid fever has often\r\nbeen attributed to drinking of coffee instead of water, the action of\r\nthe coffee being partly due to the bactericidal effect of the caffeol\r\nand partly to the boiling of the water before infusion. The stimulating\r\ntendency of the caffein to sustain and to \"tide over\" those of low\r\nvitalities is also evidenced.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Use of Coffee in Medicine_\r\n\r\nCoffee has been employed in medicinal practise as a direct specific, as\r\na preventive, and as an antidote. The _United States Dispensatory_[236]\r\nsummarizes the uses of caffein and coffee as follows:\r\n\r\n     Caffein is a valuable remedy in practical medicine as a cerebral\r\n     and cardiac stimulant and as a diuretic. In undue _somnolence_, in\r\n     _nervous headache_, in _narcotism_, also, at times when the\r\n     exigencies of life require excessively prolonged wakefulness,\r\n     caffein may be used as the most powerful agent known for producing\r\n     wakefulness. In a series of experiments, J. Hughes Bennett found\r\n     that within narrow limits there is a direct physiological\r\n     antagonism between caffein and morphine. Coffee and caffein in\r\n     narcotic poisoning are of value as a means of keeping the patient\r\n     awake, and of stimulating the respiratory centres.\r\n\r\n     As a cardiac stimulant, caffein may be used in any form of heart\r\n     failure; the indications for its use are those which call for the\r\n     employment of digitalis. It is superior to digitalis in never\r\n     disagreeing with the stomach, in having no distinctive cumulative\r\n     tendency, and in the promptness of its action. It is pronouncedly\r\n     inferior to digitalis in the power and certainty of its action, and\r\n     in the permanence of its influence once asserted. As a diuretic it\r\n     is superior; it is very valuable in the treatment of _cardiac\r\n     dropsies_, and is often useful in _chronic Bright's disease_ when\r\n     there is no irritation of the kidneys.\r\n\r\n     On account of its tendency to produce wakefulness, it is usually\r\n     better to mass the doses early in the day, at least six hours being\r\n     left between the last dose and the ordinary time for sleep. From\r\n     eight to fifteen grams (of caffein) may be given in the course of a\r\n     day in severe cases. If tried, it would probably prove a useful\r\n     drug in cases of _sudden collapse_ from various causes.\r\n\r\nGood effects of coffee are recounted by Thompson.[237]\r\n\r\n     It removes the sensation of fatigue in the muscles, and increases\r\n     their functional activity; it allays hunger to a limited extent; it\r\n     strengthens the heart action; it acts as a diuretic, and increases\r\n     the excretion of urea; it has a mildly sudorific influence; it\r\n     counteracts nervous exhaustion and stimulates nerve centers. It is\r\n     used sometimes as a nervine in cases of migraine, and there are\r\n     many persons who can sustain prolonged mental fatigue and strain\r\n     from anxiety and worry much better by the use of strong black\r\n     coffee. In low delirium, or when the nervous system is overcome by\r\n     the use of narcotics or by excessive hemorrhage, strong black\r\n     coffee is serviceable to keep the patient from falling into the\r\n     drowsiness which soon merges into coma. In such cases as much as\r\n     half a pint of strong black coffee may be injected into the rectum.\r\n\r\n     Strong coffee with a little lemon juice or brandy is often useful\r\n     in overcoming a malarial chill or a paroxysm of asthma. It is a\r\n     useful temporary cardiac stimulant for children suffering collapse.\r\n\r\nDr. Restrepo,[238] of Medellin, Colombia, claims to have cured many\r\ncases of chronic malaria and related diseases with infusion of green\r\ncoffee, after quinine had failed. Wallace[239] states that tincture of\r\ngreen coffee is a natural and efficacious specific for cholera, and that\r\nshe knows of more than a thousand eases of cholera and diarrhea which\r\nhave been treated with it without an isolated case of failure.\r\nLandanabileo has been quoted as using raw coffee infusion in hepatic and\r\nnephritic diseases, venal and hepatic colics, and in diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn the Civil War, surgeons utilized coffee in allaying malarial fever\r\nand other maladies with which they had to contend, often under the most\r\ntrying conditions, and with severely limited means of combating\r\ndisease.[240] Its effect is to counteract the depressant action of low\r\nand miasmatic atmospheres, opening the secretions which they have\r\nchecked. Travelers from the colder climes soon find that the fragrant\r\ncup of coffee is a corrective to derangements of the liver resulting\r\nfrom climatic conditions.[241]\r\n\r\nDr. Guillasse, of the French Navy, in a paper on typhoid fever, says:\r\n\r\n     Coffee has given us unhoped for satisfaction, and after having\r\n     dispensed it we find, to our great surprise, that its action is as\r\n     prompt as it is decisive. No sooner have our patients taken a few\r\n     tablespoonfuls of it, than their features become relaxed and they\r\n     come to their senses. The next day the improvement is such that we\r\n     are tempted to look upon coffee as a specific against typhoid\r\n     fever. Under its influence the stupor is dispelled, and the patient\r\n     arouses from the state of somnolency in which he has been since\r\n     the invasion of the disease. Soon all the functions take their\r\n     natural course, and he enters upon convalescence.[242]\r\n\r\nAlso it has been reported that in extreme cases of yellow fever, coffee\r\nhas been used most effectively by many physicians as the main reliance\r\nafter all other well known remedies have been administered and failed.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lorand,[243] the use of coffee in gout is strictly\r\nprohibited by Umber and Schittenhelm; but he considered it a mistake\r\nabsolutely to forbid coffee, as, when a person has good kidneys, the\r\nsmall amount of uric acid furnished by the caffein can readily be\r\neliminated. A curious remedy for gout and rheumatism, the efficacy of\r\nwhich the writer scouts, is said to be[244]--a pint of hot, strong,\r\nblack coffee, which must be perfectly pure, and seasoned with a\r\nteaspoonful of pure black pepper, thoroughly mixed before drinking, and\r\nthe preparation taken just before going to bed. If this has any value,\r\nit is probably purely psychological in its function.\r\n\r\nSeveral writers[245] attribute amblyopia and other affections of the\r\nsight to coffee and chicory, without giving much conclusive experimental\r\ndata. Beer,[246] a Vienna oculist, however, held that the vapor from\r\npure, hot, freshly-made coffee is beneficial to the eyes.\r\n\r\nCoffee and caffein are physiologically antagonistic to the common\r\nnarcotics, nicotine, morphine, opium, alcohol, etc., and are frequently\r\nused as antidotes for these poisons. Binz found that dogs that have been\r\nstupified with alcohol could be awakened with coffee. It may thus be\r\nprescribed for hard drinkers to counteract the baleful excitability\r\nproduced by alcohol; in fact, many topers taper off after a long debauch\r\nwith coffee containing small amounts of alcoholic beverages. Considering\r\nits ability to counteract the slow intoxication of tobacco, it may be\r\ninferred that coffee is indispensable for hard smokers.\r\n\r\nIn general, the medicinal value of coffee may be said to be directly\r\nattributable to its caffein content, although its antiseptic properties\r\nare dependent upon the volatile aromatic constituents. Its function is\r\nto raise and to sustain vitalities which have been lowered by disease or\r\ndrugs. Although some of the cures attributed to it are probably purely\r\ntraditional; still, it must be admitted, that by utilizing its\r\nstimulating qualities in many illnesses the patient may be carried past\r\nthe danger point into convalescence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Physiological Action of \"Caffetannic Acid_\"\r\n\r\nIt has been demonstrated in chapter XVII that there is no definite\r\ncompound \"caffetannic acid,\" and that the heterogeneous material\r\ndesignated by this name does not possess the properties of tanning.\r\nFurther substantiation of this contention, and more evidence of the\r\ninnocuous character of the tannin-like compounds in coffee, are\r\ncontained in the testimony of Sollmann.[247] \"Tannins precipitate\r\nproteins, gelatine, and connective tissue, and thus act as astringents,\r\nstyptics, and antiseptics. The different tannins are not equivalent in\r\nthese respects. Some (which are perhaps misnamed) such as those of\r\ncoffee and ipecac, are practically non-precipitant.... On the whole, one\r\nmay say that the small quantities of tannin ordinarily taken with the\r\nfood and drink are not injurious, but that large quantities (excessive\r\ntea drinking) are certainly deleterious. The tannin of coffee is\r\nscarcely astringent, and, therefore, lacks this action,\" which is proven\r\nby the fact that it does not precipitate proteins.\r\n\r\n\"It has been claimed that 'caffetannic acid' injures the stomach walls,\r\nbut there is no evidence that this is so.\"[248] Wiley,[249] in reporting\r\nsome of his experiments, says: \"Apparently the efforts to saddle the\r\ninjurious effects of coffee-drinking upon caffetannic acid in any form\r\nin which it may exist in the coffee-extract are not supported by these\r\nrecent data.\" The fact that tannins retard intestinal peristalsis,\r\nwhereas coffee promotes this digestive action, lends further proof to\r\nthe non-existence of tannin in coffee. These statements by eminent\r\nauthorities may be consolidated into the verity that there is no tannin,\r\nin the true sense of the term, in coffee; and that the constituents of\r\nthe coffee brew which have been so designated are physiologically\r\nharmless.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Physiological Action of Caffeol_\r\n\r\nThe evidence regarding the physiological action of caffeol is\r\ncontradictory in many cases. J. Lehmann found in 1853, that the\r\n\"empyreumatic oil of coffee, _caffeone_,\" is active; but more recent\r\ninvestigations have yielded results at variance with this. Hare and\r\nMarshall[250] believe that they proved it to be active. E.T.\r\nReichert,[251] however, found it inactive in dogs, excepting in so far\r\nthat, when given intravenously, it mechanically interfered with the\r\ncirculation. With it Binz[252] was able to produce in man only feeble\r\nnervous excitement, with restlessness and increase in the rate and depth\r\nof respirations.\r\n\r\nThe general effects, as summated by Sollmann[253] are, for _small\r\ndoses_, pleasant stimulation; increased respiration; increased heart\r\nrate, but fall of blood pressure; muscular restlessness; insomnia;\r\nperspiration; congestion; for _large doses_, increased peristalsis and\r\ndefecation; depression of respiration and heart; fall of blood pressure\r\nand temperature; paralytic phenomena. It is doubtful whether the\r\nquantities taken in the beverage cause any direct central stimulation.\r\n\r\nInvestigations have also been conducted with the various known\r\nconstituents of this \"coffee oil.\" Erdmann[254] found that in doses of\r\nbetween 0.5 and 0.6 gram per kilo of body weight, furane-alcohol kills a\r\nrabbit by respiratory paralysis; and that the symptoms of poisoning are\r\na short primary excitement, salivation, diarrhea, respiratory\r\ndepression, continuous fall of the body temperature, and death from\r\ncollapse with respiratory failure. In man, doses of from 0.6 to 1 gram\r\nof furane-alcohol increased respiratory activity without producing other\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\nHowever, man is not as susceptible to these compounds as are the smaller\r\nanimals. But even if their relative susceptibility be assumed to be the\r\nsame, the lethal dose given the rabbit is equivalent to giving a\r\n140-pound man one dose containing the furane-alcohol content of over\r\n5,000 cups of coffee. Thus, in view of the very apparent minuteness of\r\nthe quantity of this compound present in one cup of coffee, together\r\nwith the fact that it is not cumulative in its physiological action, the\r\nimportance of its toxic properties becomes very inconsequential to even\r\nthe most profuse and inveterate coffee drinkers.\r\n\r\nBurmann[255] reported the volatile principle to have a reducing action\r\non the hemoglobin; a depressing effect on the blood pressure; a\r\ndepressant action on the central nervous system, disturbing the cardiac\r\nrhythm; and an action on the respiratory centers, causing dyspnea. The\r\nreport of Sayre[256] regarding the minimum lethal dose of the\r\nconcentrated combined active principles of coffee obtained from dry\r\ndistillation is, for frogs, administered intraperitoneally and\r\nsubcutaneously, 0.03 cubic centimeters per gram of body weight; for\r\nguinea pigs per stomach, 7.0 cc. per kilogram of body weight, and\r\nadministered intravenously and intraperitoneally, about 1.0 cc. per\r\nkilogram.\r\n\r\nThis evidence regarding the physiological action of caffeol can not in\r\nany wise be construed to indicate a harmfulness of coffee. The\r\npercentage of these volatile substances in a cup of coffee infusion is\r\nso low as to be relatively negligible in its action. And, again, the\r\ncaffein content of the brew, as will be seen, tends to counteract any\r\npossible desultory effects of the caffeol.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Physiological Action of Caffein_\r\n\r\nMore attention has been given to the study of the physiological action\r\nof caffein than to that of the other individual constituents of coffee.\r\nSince certain of the effects of coffee drinking have been attributed to\r\nthis alkaloid, a brief presentment of the pharmacology of caffein will\r\nbe given as an exposition of the many statements made regarding it.\r\nAccording to the _British Pharmaceutical Codex_[257]:\r\n\r\n     Caffein exerts three important actions: (1) on the central nervous\r\n     system: (2) on muscles, including cardiac: and (3) on the kidney.\r\n     The action on the central nervous system is mainly on that part of\r\n     the brain connected with psychical functions. It produces a\r\n     condition of wakefulness and increased mental activity. The\r\n     interpretation of sensory impressions is more perfect and correct,\r\n     and thought becomes clearer and quicker. With larger doses of\r\n     caffein the action extends from the psychical areas to the motor\r\n     area and to the cord, and the patient becomes at first restless and\r\n     noisy, and later may show convulsive movements.\r\n\r\n     Caffein facilitates the performance of all forms of physical work,\r\n     and actually increases the total work which can be obtained from\r\n     muscle. On the normal man, however, it is impossible to say how\r\n     much of the action on the muscle is central and how much\r\n     peripheral, but, as fatigue shows itself first by an action on the\r\n     center, it is probable that the action of caffein in diminishing\r\n     fatigue is mainly central. Caffein accelerates the pulse and\r\n     slightly raises blood pressure. It has no action in any way\r\n     resembling digitalis; by increasing the irritability of the cardiac\r\n     muscle, its prolonged use rather tends to fatigue than to rest the\r\n     heart.\r\n\r\n     Caffein and its allies form a very important group of diuretics.\r\n     The urine is generally of a lower specific gravity than normal,\r\n     since it contains a lesser proportion of salt and urea; but the\r\n     total excretion of solids, both as regards urea, uric acid, and\r\n     salts, is increased. Caffein, by exciting the medulla, produces an\r\n     initial vaso-constriction of the kidneys, which tends at first to\r\n     retard the flow of urine. So in recent years, other drugs have been\r\n     introduced, allies of caffein, which act like it on the kidneys,\r\n     but are without the stimulant action on the brain. Theobromine is\r\n     such a drug.\r\n\r\nAnother authority states that[258]:\r\n\r\n     One of the most constant symptoms produced in man by over-doses of\r\n     caffein is excessive diuresis, and experiments made upon the lower\r\n     animals show that caffein acts as a diuretic not only by\r\n     influencing the circulation, but also by directly affecting the\r\n     secreting cells, the probabilities being in favor of the first of\r\n     these theories of action. According to Schroeder, not only the\r\n     water but also the solids of the urine are increased.\r\n\r\n     The question whether caffein has an influence upon tissue changes\r\n     and the consequent nitrogenous elimination can not be considered as\r\n     distinctly answered, though the most probable conclusion is that\r\n     the action of caffein upon urea elimination and upon general\r\n     nutrition is not direct or pronounced. While the therapeutic dose\r\n     of caffein is broken up in the body with the formation of\r\n     methylxanthin, which escapes with the urine, the toxic dose is at\r\n     least in part eliminated by the kidney unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe metabolism of the methyl purins, of which group caffein is a member,\r\nappears to vary with the quantity ingested. The manner in which the\r\nmethyl group is liberated by the cell protoplasm is said[259] to\r\ndetermine the amount of stimulus which the tissues receive from these\r\nsubstances. The xanthin group is almost without any excitatory action,\r\nand its metabolic end products are constant. Perhaps the variation in\r\nthe excretions of unchanged methylpurins is dependent upon the amount of\r\ntotal reactive energy they invoke.\r\n\r\nBaldi[260] found that caffein in small doses increases muscular\r\nexcitability in dogs and frogs. The spinal and muscular hyperic\r\nexcitability produced by caffein is, in his opinion, due to the methyl\r\ngroups attached to the xanthin nucleus. Fredericq[261] states that\r\ncaffein increases the irritability of the cardiac vagus and accelerates\r\nthe appearance of pseudofatigue of the vagus which is produced by\r\nprolonged stimulation of the nerve. The action of caffein on the\r\nmammalian heart has also been investigated by Pilcher,[262] who found\r\nthat, following the rapid intravenous injection of caffein, there is an\r\nacute fall of blood pressure; and with a maximal quantity of caffein, 10\r\nmilligrams per kilogram, the cardiac volume and the amplitude of the\r\nexcursions are usually unchanged. With larger quantities, the volume\r\nprogressively increases and the amplitude of the excursion decreases.\r\n\r\nSalant[263] found that the intravenous injection of 15 to 25 milligrams\r\nof caffein per kilogram in animals was followed by a fall of blood\r\npressure amounting to 7 to 35 percent in most cases, which was\r\ntransitory, although in some animals it remained unchanged. A moderate\r\nrise was rarely observed. Caffein aids the action of nitrates,\r\nacetanilid, ethyl alcohol and amyl alcohol, and increases the toxicity\r\nof barium chloride. In a very thorough study of the toxicity of caffein\r\nwhich he made with Reiger,[264] a greater toxicity of about 15 to 20\r\npercent by subcutaneous injection than by mouth, and but about one-half\r\nthis when injected peritoneally, was found. Intramuscularly the toxicity\r\nis 30 percent greater than subcutaneously. In making the tests on\r\nanimals, they found that individuality, season, age, species, and\r\ncertain pathological conditions caused variation in the toxic effect of\r\nthe administered caffein. Low protein diet tends to decrease resistance\r\nto caffein in dogs, and a milk or meat diet does the same for growing\r\ndogs. Caffein is not cumulative for the rabbit or dog.\r\n\r\nAs a result of experiments on the action of caffein on the bronchiospasm\r\ncaused by peptone (Witte), silk peptone, B-imidoazolyl-ethylamin,\r\ncurare, vasodilation, and mucarin, Pal[265] concluded that caffein\r\nstimulates certain branches of the peripheral sympathetic and is thus\r\nenabled to widen the bronchi or remove bronchiospasm.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lapicque[266], caffein produces a change in the\r\nexcitability of the medulla of the frog similar to that produced by\r\nraising the temperature of the nerve centers. Schürhoff[267] has\r\npointed out that the continued use of large quantities of caffein will\r\nproduce cardiac irregularity and sleeplessness.\r\n\r\nCochrane[268] cited three cases where caffein was hypodermically\r\nadministered in cases of acute indigestion, etc., and concluded that the\r\ncases prove that caffein, or a compound containing it as a synergist,\r\ndoes indirectly make the injection of morphia a safe proceeding, and\r\ndirectly increases the force of the heart and arterial tension. However,\r\nWood[269] found that medium doses of caffein do not produce any marked\r\nrise in blood pressure, and cause a reduction in pulse rate. He\r\nattributes the contradictory results which prior investigations gave, to\r\nemployment of unusually large doses and to inaccurate experimental\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nCaffein was found by Nonnenbruch and Szyszka[270] to have a slight\r\naction toward accelerating the coagulation time of the blood, being\r\nactive over several hours. It inhibits coagulation _in vitrio_. Its\r\naction in the body apparently rests on an increase of the fibrin\r\nferment. There is no reason to believe that the behavior is dependent on\r\na toxic action, but there is probably an action on the spleen; for in\r\nseveral rabbits from which the spleen was removed, no action was\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nExperiments conducted by Levinthal[271] gave no positive information as\r\nto the formation of uric acid from caffein in the human organism. The\r\nelimination of caffein has also been studied by Salant and Reiger[272],\r\nwho found that larger amounts of caffein are demethylated in carnivora\r\nthan in herbivora, and resistance to caffein is inversely as\r\ndemethylation, caffein being much more toxic in the former class. In a\r\nsimilar investigation, Zenetz[273] observed that caffein is very\r\nslightly eliminated from the system by the kidneys, and that its action\r\non the heart is cumulative; therefore he concludes that it is\r\ncontra-indicated in all renal diseases, in arterio-sclerosis, and in\r\ncardiac affections secondary to them. The inaccuracy of these\r\nconclusions regarding the non-elimination of caffein and those of\r\nAlbanese,[274] Bondzynski and Gottlieb[275], Leven[276],\r\nSchurtzkwer[277], and Minkowski[278], has been shown by Mendel and\r\nWardell[279], who point out that many of these experimenters worked with\r\ndogs, in which the chief end-product of purin metabolism is not uric\r\nacid, but allantoin. They observe that the increase in excretion of uric\r\nacid after the addition of caffein to the diet seems to be proportional\r\nto the quantity of caffein taken, and equivalent to from 10 to 15\r\npercent of the ingested caffein. The remainder of the caffein is\r\nprobably eliminated as mono-methylpurins.\r\n\r\nRegarding the alleged cumulative action of caffein, Pletzer[280],\r\nLiebreich,[281] Szekacs[282], Pawinski,[283] and Seifert[284] all\r\nconcluded from their investigations that the action of caffein is\r\nusually of brief duration, and does not have a cumulative effect,\r\nbecause of its rapid elimination; so that there is no danger of\r\nintoxication.\r\n\r\nDr. Oswald Schmiedeberg says:\r\n\r\n     Caffein is a means of refreshing bodily and mental activity, so\r\n     that this may be prolonged when the condition of fatigue has\r\n     already begun to produce restraint, and to call for more severe\r\n     exertion of the will, a state which, as is well known, is painful\r\n     or disagreeable.\r\n\r\n     This advantageous effect, in conditions of fatigue, of small\r\n     quantities of caffein, as it is commonly taken in coffee or tea,\r\n     might, however, by continued use become injurious, if it were in\r\n     all cases necessarily exerted; that is to say, if by caffein the\r\n     muscles and nerves were directly spurred on to increased activity.\r\n     This is not the case, however, and just in this lies the\r\n     peculiarity of the effect in question. The muscles and the\r\n     simultaneously-acting nerves only under the influence of caffein\r\n     respond more easily to the impulse of the will, but do not develop\r\n     spontaneous activity; that is, without the co-operation of the\r\n     will.\r\n\r\n     The character of caffein action makes plain that these food\r\n     materials do not injure the organism by their caffein content, and\r\n     do not by continued use cause any chronic form of illness.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Hollingworth's[285] deductions, caffein is the only\r\nknown stimulant that quickens the functions of the human body without a\r\nsubsequent period of depression. His explanation for this behavior is\r\nthat \"caffein acts as a lubricator for the nervous system, having an\r\nactual physical action whereby the nerves are enabled to do their work\r\nmore easily. Other stimulants act on the nerves themselves, causing a\r\nwaste of energy, and consequently, according to nature's law, a period\r\nof depression follows, and the whole process tends to injure the human\r\nmachine.\" In not a single instance during his experiments at Columbia\r\nUniversity did depression follow the use of caffein.\r\n\r\nOf course, caffein, like any other alkaloid, if used to excess will\r\nprove harmful, due to the over-stimulation induced by it. However, taken\r\nin moderate quantities, as in coffee and tea by normal persons, the\r\nconclusions of Hirsch[286] may be taken as correct, namely: caffein is a\r\nmild stimulant, without direct effect on the muscles, the effect\r\nresulting from its own destruction and being temporary and transitory;\r\nit is not a depressant either initially or eventually; and is not\r\nhabit-forming but a true stimulant, as distinguished from sedatives and\r\nhabit-forming drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caffein and Mental and Motor Efficiency_\r\n\r\nThe literature on the influence of caffein on fatigue has been\r\nsummarized, and the older experiments clearly pointed out, by\r\nRivers[287]. A summary of the most important researches which have had\r\nas their object the determination of the influence of caffein on mental\r\nand motor processes has been made by Hollingworth[288], from whose\r\nmonograph much of the following material has been taken.\r\n\r\nIncrease in the force of muscular contractions was demonstrated in 1892\r\nby De Sarlo and Barnardini[289] for caffein and by Kraepelin for tea.\r\nThese investigators used the dynamometer as a measure of the force of\r\ncontraction; however, most of the subsequent work on motor processes has\r\nbeen by the ergographic method. Ugolino Mosso[290], Koch[291].\r\nRossi[292], Sobieranski[293], Hoch and Kraepelin,[294] Destrée,[295]\r\nBenedicenti,[296] Schumberg,[297] Hellsten,[298] and Joteyko,[299] have\r\nall observed a stimulating effect of caffein on ergographic performance.\r\nOnly one investigation of those reported by Rivers failed to find an\r\nappreciable effect, that of Oseretzkowsky and Kraepelin,[300] while\r\nFeré[301] affirms that the effect is only an acceleration of fatigue.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the general agreement as to the presence of stimulation\r\nthere is some dissension regarding whether only the height of the\r\ncontractions or their number or both are affected. As might be expected\r\nfrom the great diversity of methods employed, the quantitative results\r\nalso have varied considerably. Carefully controlled experiments by\r\nRivers and Webber[302] \"confirm in general the conclusion reached by all\r\nprevious workers that caffein stimulates the capacity for muscular work;\r\nand it is clear that this increase is not due to the various psychical\r\nfactors of interest, sensory stimulation, and suggestion, which the\r\nexperiments were especially designed to exclude. The greatest increase\r\n... falls, however, far short of that described by some previous\r\nworkers, such as Mosso; and it is probable that part of the effect\r\ndescribed by these workers was due to the factors in question.\"\r\n\r\nInvestigations of mental processes under the influence of caffein have\r\nbeen much less frequent, most notable among which are those of Dietl and\r\nVintschgau,[303] Dehio,[304] Kraepelin and Hoch,[305] Ach,[306]\r\nLangfeld,[307] and Rivers.[308] Kraepelin[309] observes: \"We know that\r\ntea and coffee increase our mental efficiency in a definite way, and we\r\nuse these as a means of overcoming mental fatigue ... In the morning\r\nthese drinks remove the last traces of sleepiness and in the evening\r\nwhen we still have intellectual tasks to dispose of they aid in keeping\r\nus awake.\" Their use induces a greater briskness and clearness of\r\nthought, after which secondary fatigue is either entirely absent or is\r\nvery slight.\r\n\r\nTendency toward habituation of the pyschic functions to caffein has been\r\nstudied by Wedemeyer[310], who found that in the regular administration\r\nof it in the course of four to five weeks there is a measurable\r\nweakening of its action on psychic processes.\r\n\r\nRivers[311], who seems to have been the first to appreciate fully the\r\ngenuine and practical importance of thoroughly controlling the\r\npsychological factors that are likely to play a rôle in such\r\nexperiments, concludes that \"caffein increases the capacity for both\r\nmuscular and mental work, this stimulating action persisting for a\r\nconsiderable time after the substance has been taken without there being\r\nany evidence, with moderate doses, of reaction leading to diminished\r\ncapacity for work, the substance thus really diminishing and not merely\r\nobscuring the effects of fatigue.\"\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF CAFFEIN ON MENTAL AND MOTOR PROCESSES\r\n\r\nSchematic Summary of All Results\r\n\r\nSt.=Stimulation.  0=No effect.

General health  and conditions  of\r\n                                administration\r\n\r\nSubsequent to these investigations was that of Hollingworth[312] which\r\nis at once the most comprehensive, carefully conducted, and\r\nscientifically accurate one yet performed. He employed an ample number\r\nof subjects in his experimentation; and both his subjects, and the\r\nassistants who recorded the observations, were in no wise cognizant of\r\nthe character or quantity of the dose of caffein administered, the other\r\nexperimental conditions being similarly rigorous and extensive.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of his study was to determine both qualitatively and\r\nquantitatively the effect of caffein on a wide range of mental and motor\r\nprocesses, by studying the performance of a considerable number of\r\nindividuals for a long period of time, under controlled conditions; to\r\nstudy the way in which this influence is modified by such factors as the\r\nage, sex, weight, idiosyncrasy, and previous caffein habits of the\r\nsubjects, and the degree to which it depends on the amount of the dose\r\nand the time and conditions of its administration; and to investigate\r\nthe influence of caffein on the general health, quality and amount of\r\nsleep, and food habits of the individual tested.\r\n\r\nTo obtain this information the chief tests employed were the steadiness,\r\ntapping, coordination, typewriting, color-naming, calculations,\r\nopposites, cancellation, and discrimination tests, the familiar\r\nsize-weight illusion, quality and amount of sleep, and general health\r\nand feeling of well-being. A brief review of the results of these tests\r\nis given in the tabular summary.\r\n\r\nFrom these Hollingworth concluded that caffein influenced all the tests\r\nin a given group in much the same way. The effect on motor processes\r\ncomes quickly and is transient, while the effect on higher mental\r\nprocesses comes more slowly and is more persistent. Whether this result\r\nis due to quicker reaction on the part of motor-nerve centers, or\r\nwhether it is due to a direct peripheral effect on the muscle tissue is\r\nuncertain, but the indications are that caffein has a direct action on\r\nthe muscle tissue, and that this effect is fairly rapid in appearance.\r\nThe two principal factors which seem to modify the degree of caffein\r\ninfluence are _body weight_ and _presence of food_ in the stomach at the\r\ntime of ingestion of the caffein. In practically all of the tests the\r\nmagnitude of the caffein influence varied inversely with the body\r\nweight, and was most marked when taken on an empty stomach or without\r\nfood substance. This variance in action was also true for both the\r\nquality and amount of sleep, and seemed to be accentuated when taken on\r\nsuccessive days; but it did not appear to depend on the age, sex, or\r\nprevious caffein habits of the individual. Those who had given up the\r\nuse of caffein-containing beverages during the experiment did not report\r\nany craving for the drinks as such, but several expressed a feeling of\r\nannoyance at not having some sort of a warm drink for breakfast.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that he also found a complete absence of any\r\ntrace of secondary depression or of any sort of secondary reaction\r\nconsequent upon the stimulation which was so strikingly present in many\r\nof the tests. The production of an increased capacity for work was\r\nclearly demonstrated, the same being a genuine drug effect, and not\r\nmerely the effect of excitement, interest, sensory stimulation,\r\nexpectation, or suggestion. However, this study does not show whether\r\nthis increased capacity comes from a new supply of energy introduced or\r\nrendered available by the drug action, or whether energy already\r\navailable comes to be employed more effectively, or whether fatigue\r\nsensations are weakened and the individual's standard of performance\r\nthereby raised. But they do show that from a standpoint of mental and\r\nproductive physical efficiency \"the widespread consumption of caffeinic\r\nbeverages, even under circumstances in which and by individuals for whom\r\nthe use of other drugs is stringently prohibited or decried, is\r\njustified.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion_\r\n\r\nBrief summarization of the information available on the pharmacology of\r\ncoffee indicates that it should be used in moderation, particularly by\r\nchildren, the permissible quantity varying with the individual and\r\nascertainable only through personal observation. Used in moderation, it\r\nwill prove a valuable stimulant increasing personal efficiency in mental\r\nand physical labor. Its action in the alimentary régime is that of an\r\nadjuvant food, aiding digestion, favoring increased flow of the\r\ndigestive juices, promoting intestinal peristalsis, and not tanning any\r\nportion of the digestive organs. It reacts on the kidneys as a diuretic,\r\nand increases the excretion of uric acid, which, however, is not to be\r\ntaken as evidence that it is harmful in gout. Coffee has been indicated\r\nas a specific for various diseases, its functions therein being the\r\nraising and sustaining of low vitalities. Its effect upon longevity is\r\nvirtually _nil_. A small proportion of humans who are very nervous may\r\nfind coffee undesirable; but sensible consumption of coffee by the\r\naverage, normal, non-neurasthenic person will not prove harmful but\r\nbeneficial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE COMMERCIAL COFFEES OF THE WORLD\r\n\r\n     _The geographical distribution of the coffees grown in North\r\n     America, Central America, South America, the West India Islands,\r\n     Asia, Africa, the Pacific Islands, and the East Indies--A\r\n     statistical study of the distribution of the principal kinds--A\r\n     commercial coffee chart of the world's leading growths, with market\r\n     names and general trade characteristics_\r\n\r\n\r\nA study of the geographical distribution of the coffee tree shows that\r\nit is grown in well-defined tropical limits. The coffee belt of the\r\nworld lies between the tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn. The\r\nprincipal coffee consuming countries are nearly all to be found in the\r\nnorth temperate zone, between the tropic of cancer and the arctic\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\nThe leading commercial coffees of the world are listed in the\r\naccompanying commercial coffee chart, which shows at a glance their\r\ngeneral trade character. The cultural methods of the producing countries\r\nare discussed in chapter XX; statistics in chapter XXII; and the trade\r\ncharacteristics, in detail, in chapter XXIV, which considers also\r\ncountries and coffees not so important in a commercial sense. Mexico is\r\nthe principal producing country in the northern part of the western\r\ncontinent, and Brazil in the southern part. In Africa, the eastern coast\r\nfurnishes the greater part of the supply; while in Asia, the Netherlands\r\nIndies, British India, and Arabia lead.\r\n\r\nWithin the last two decades there has been an expansion of the\r\nproduction areas in South America, Africa, and in southeastern Asia; and\r\na contraction in British India and the Netherlands Indies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Shifting Coffee Currents of the World_\r\n\r\nSeldom does the coffee drinker realize how the ends of the earth are\r\ndrawn upon to bring the perfected beverage to his lips. The trail that\r\nends in his breakfast cup, if followed back, would be found to go a\r\ndevious and winding way, soon splitting up into half-a-dozen or more\r\nstraggling branches that would lead to as many widely scattered regions.\r\nIf he could mount to a point where he could enjoy a bird's-eye view of\r\nthese and a hundred kindred trails, he would find an intricate\r\ncriss-cross of streamlets and rivers of coffee forming a tangled pattern\r\nover the tropics and reaching out north and south to all civilized\r\ncountries. This would be a picture of the coffee trade of the world.\r\n\r\nIt would be a motion picture, with the rivulets swelling larger at\r\ncertain seasons, but seldom drying up entirely at any time. In the main\r\nthe streamlets and rivers keep pretty much the same direction and volume\r\none year after another, but then there is also a quiet shifting of these\r\ncurrents. Some grow larger, and others diminish gradually until they\r\nfade out entirely. In one of the regions from which they take their\r\nsource a tree disease may cause a decline; in another, a hurricane may\r\nlay the industry low at one quick stroke; and in still another, a rival\r\ncrop may drain away the life-blood of capital. But for the most part,\r\nwhen times are normal, the shift is gradual; for international trade is\r\nconservative, and likes to run where it finds a well-worn channel.\r\n\r\nIn recent times, of course, the big disturbing element in the coffee\r\ntrade was the World War. Whole countries were cut out of the market,\r\nshipping was drained away from every sea lane, stocks were piled high in\r\nexporting ports, prices were fixed, imports were sharply restricted, and\r\nthe whole business of coffee trading was thrown out of joint. To what\r\nextent has the world returned to normal in this trade? Were the\r\nstoppages in trade merely temporary suspensions, or are they to prove\r\npermanent? How are the old, long-worn channels filling up again, now\r\nthat the dams have been taken away?\r\n\r\nWe are now far enough removed from the war to begin to answer these\r\nquestions. We find our answer in the export figures of the chief\r\nproducing countries, which for the most part are now available in detail\r\nfor one or two post-war years. These figures are given in the tables\r\nbelow; and for comparison, there are also given figures showing the\r\ndistribution of exports in 1913 and in an earlier year near the\r\nbeginning of the century. These figures, of course, do not necessarily\r\ngive an accurate index to normal trade; as in any given year some\r\nabnormal happening, such as an exceptionally large crop or a revolution,\r\nmay affect exports drastically as compared with years before and after.\r\nBut normally the proportions of a country's exports going to its various\r\ncustomers are fairly constant one year after another, and can be taken\r\nfor any given year as showing approximately the coffee currents of that\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe figures following are for the calendar year unless the fiscal year\r\nis indicated. Where figures could not be obtained from the original\r\nstatistical publications, they have been supplied as far as possible\r\nfrom consular reports.\r\n\r\nBRAZIL. The war naturally increased the dependence of Brazil on its\r\nchief customer, and the proportion of the total crop coming to this\r\ncountry since the war has continued to be large. Shipments to United\r\nStates ports in 1920 represented about fifty-four percent of the total\r\nexports. Figures for that year indicate also that France and Belgium\r\nwere working back to their normal trade; but that Spain, Great Britain,\r\nand the Netherlands were taking much less coffee than in the year just\r\nbefore the war. Germany was buying strongly again, her purchases of\r\n72,000,000 pounds being about half as much as in 1913. Shipments to\r\nItaly were four times as heavy as in 1913. The natural return to normal\r\nwas much interfered with by speculation and valorization. Brazil seems\r\nto have come through the cataclysmic period of the war in better style\r\nthan might have been expected.\r\n\r\nCOFFEE EXPORTS FROM BRAZIL\r\n                     1900           1913           1920\r\n  Exported to       Pounds         Pounds         Pounds\r\nUnited States    566,686,345    650,071,337    826,425,340\r\nFrance            78,408,862    244,295,282    203,694,212\r\nGreat Britain      6,442,739     32,559,715      9,597,378\r\nGermany          235,131,881    246,767,144     72,196,934\r\nAus.-Hungary      71,696,556    134,495,310\r\nNetherlands      102,711,887    196,169,240     49,760,767\r\nItaly             17,559,107     31,364,656    132,543,798\r\nSpain                868,617     14,407,906      6,057,833\r\nBelgium           41,500,638     58,858,562     42,309,469\r\nOther countries   59,432,882    145,896,327    181,796,919\r\n               -------------  -------------  -------------\r\nTotal          1,180,439,514  1,754,885,479  1,524,382,650\r\n\r\nThe 1900 figures are for the ports of Rio, Santos, Bahia, and Victoria.\r\n\r\n\"Other countries\" in 1913 included Argentina, 32,941,182 pounds; Sweden,\r\n28,045,737 pounds; Cape Colony, 15,930,731 pounds; Denmark, 6,252,931\r\npounds.

Venezuela's coffee trade was deeply affected by the war; both\r\nbecause the Germans were prominent in the industry, and because the\r\nregular shipping service to Europe was discontinued. Large amounts of\r\ncoffee were piled up at the ports and elsewhere; and when the\r\nrestrictions were swept away in 1919, an abnormal exportation resulted.\r\nAlthough Germany had been one of the chief buyers before the war,\r\nVenezuela was by no means dependent on the German market. In fact, her\r\ncombined shipments to France and the United States, just before the war,\r\nwere three times as great as her exports to Germany. These two countries\r\ntook two-thirds of her total exports in 1920. Spain and the Netherlands\r\nwere also prominent buyers.\r\n\r\nCOFFEE EXPORTS FROM VENEZUELA\r\n                     1906           1913           1920\r\n  Exported to       Pounds         Pounds         Pounds\r\nUnited States     35,704,398     45,570,268     43,670,191\r\nFrance            21,748,370     46,413,174      4,647,978\r\nGermany            5,270,814     32,203,972        546,363\r\nAus.-Hungary         289,851      3,015,723\r\nSpain              3,133,012      7,372,839     15,210,756\r\nNetherlands       28,549,920      2,903,806      1,836,209\r\nItaly                315,293      2,805,948        719,850\r\nGreat Britain        404,720         98,796      1,518,175\r\nOther countries    2,663,507      1,631,143      5,577,110\r\n               -------------  -------------  -------------\r\nTotal             98,079,885    142,015,669     73,726,632\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL COFFEE CHART\r\n\r\n_The World's Leading Growths, with Market Names and General\r\nTrade Characteristics_\r\n\r\n--------------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------------------\r\nGrand Division| Country   |Principal|Best Known |Trade Characteristics\r\n              |           | Shipping| Market    |\r\n              |           | Ports   | Names     |\r\n--------------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------------------\r\nNorth         |Mexico     |Vera Cruz|Coatepec   |Greenish to yellow\r\nAmerica       |           |         |Huatusco   |bean;

Colombian statistics of foreign trade are issued very\r\nirregularly, and no figures are available to afford comparison between\r\npre-war and post-war trade. The figures below, however, will show the\r\ncomparative amounts of coffee going to the chief buying countries at\r\ndifferent periods. From these it will be seen that the countries mainly\r\ninterested in the trade in Colombian coffee are those prominent in the\r\ntrade in other tropical American sections. England, France, Germany, and\r\nthe United States took the great bulk of the exports. A consular report\r\nwritten after the outbreak of the war says:\r\n\r\n     Prior to the war the United States took about seventy percent of\r\n     Colombia's coffee crop; the remainder being about equally divided\r\n     between England, France, and Germany, with England taking the\r\n     largest share.\r\n\r\nCOFFEE EXPORTS FROM COLOMBIA[A]\r\n(From Barranquilla only)\r\n\r\n                     1899        1905         1916\r\n  Exported to       Pounds      Pounds       Pounds\r\nGreat Britain    22,573,828   7,268,429      442,026\r\nFrance            6,873,722     496,120    1,685,454\r\nGermany           9,348,028   8,568,131\r\nUnited States    17,991,500  43,518,704  134,292,858\r\nOther countries               7,396,385   23,753,678\r\n                 ----------  ----------  -----------\r\nTotal            56,787,078  67,247,769  160,174,016\r\n\r\n[A] These figures are taken from a consular report, which gave\r\nstatistics only for the port of Barranquilla and did not include the\r\ntotal shipments from that port. Shipments from Cartagena, the only other\r\nexporting port of any consequence, amounted to 7,836,505 pounds,\r\ndestination not stated. The Barranquilla figures, in the absence of\r\nofficial statistics, can be taken as fairly representative of the total\r\ntrade so far as destination is concerned. They are for fiscal years,\r\nending June 30.\r\n\r\n\"Other countries\" in 1916 included Italy, 1,135,137 pounds; Venezuela,\r\n20,564,321 pounds; Dutch West Indies, 400,132 pounds.\r\n\r\nCENTRAL AMERICA. The three largest producing countries of Central\r\nAmerica, Guatemala, Salvador, and Costa Rica, were all closely linked to\r\nGermany by the coffee trade before the war. German capital was heavily\r\ninvested in coffee plantations; German houses had branches in the\r\nprincipal cities; and German ships regularly served the chief ports.\r\nAccordingly, when the blockade became effective, these countries were\r\nplaced in a difficult position. But fortunately for them, a special\r\neffort had been made shortly before by Pacific-coast interests in the\r\nUnited States to divert a part of the coffee trade to San Francisco[313]\r\nThe market to the east being shut off, these countries turned naturally\r\nto the north. This trade with the United States has apparently been\r\nfirmly established, and there has not yet been much of a return to\r\nGerman ports.\r\n\r\nGUATEMALA. Of the three countries named, Guatemala was the most heavily\r\ninvolved in German trade. In 1913 she sent to Germany 53,000,000 pounds\r\nof coffee, a fifth more than in 1900. Her shipments of more than\r\n10,000,000 pounds to the United Kingdom were about the same as at the\r\nbeginning of the century. The war turned both these currents into United\r\nStates ports, and they continued to flow in that direction through 1920.\r\nThe figures follow:\r\n\r\nCOFFEE EXPORTS FROM GUATEMALA\r\n\r\n                     1900        1913        1920\r\n  Exported to       Pounds      Pounds      Pounds\r\nGermany          44,416,064  53,232,910     452,206\r\nUnited States    14,057,120  21,188,444  78,226,508\r\nUnited Kingdom   11,467,680  10,666,604   2,341,217\r\nOther countries   3,041,584   6,641,936  13,185,638\r\n                 ----------  ----------  ----------\r\nTotal            72,982,448  91,729,894  94,205,569\r\n\r\n\"Other countries\" in 1913 included Austria-Hungary, 4,205,400 pounds;\r\nNetherlands, 407,900 pounds.

Salvador is one of the countries in which the publication of\r\nforeign-trade statistics has been irregular in the past, and none is\r\navailable to show the full trade in coffee at the beginning of the\r\ncentury. A consular report gives figures for the first half of 1900. The\r\nmost recent statistics show that the United States still holds much of\r\nthe trade gained during the war, although Salvador is sending to\r\nScandinavian countries many millions of pounds of her coffee that came\r\nto the United States in war-time.\r\n\r\nCOFFEE EXPORTS FROM SALVADOR\r\n\r\n              1900 (1st 6 mos.)  1913        1920\r\n  Exported to       Pounds      Pounds      Pounds\r\nUnited States     6,700,101  10,779,655  46,262,256\r\nFrance           22,948,712  15,955,920   6,686,714\r\nGermany           6,607,892  12,120,133     813,166\r\nGreat Britain     4,396,465   3,415,187   4,226,061\r\nItaly             4,322,003   9,538,976\r\nAus.-Hungary      1,335,626   3,557,482\r\nBelgium             210,834       5,508       3,104\r\nSpain                24,799     377,729     364,296\r\nOther countries       3,920   7,193,107  24,509,071\r\n                 ----------  ----------  ----------\r\nTotal            46,550,352  62,943,697  82,864,668\r\n\r\n\"Other countries\" in 1913 included Norway, 2,070,220 pounds; Sweden,\r\n2,238,332 pounds; Netherlands, 738,694 pounds; Chile, 609,441 pounds;\r\nRussia, 95,625 pounds; Denmark, 140,665 pounds.

English, French, and German capital was heavily invested in\r\nCosta Rica before the war, and all three nations were interested in the\r\ncoffee trade. For many years England had maintained the lead as a coffee\r\ncustomer, and shipments continued in large volume after the war. The\r\nfollowing figures are for the crop year ending September 30:\r\n\r\nCOFFEE EXPORTS FROM COSTA RICA\r\n                     1903        1913        1921\r\n  Exported to       Pounds      Pounds      Pounds\r\nUnited States     6,388,236   1,625,866  14,137,605\r\nGreat Britain    27,756,661  23,464,827  13,418,527\r\nFrance            1,241,816     741,548     313,538\r\nGermany           2,676,841   2,581,055     376,649\r\nOther countries     147,925     288,521   1,155,066\r\n                 ----------  ----------  ----------\r\nTotal            38,211,479  28,701,817  29,401,385\r\n\r\nIn 1900 total shipments were 35,496,055 pounds, of which 20,587,712\r\npounds went to Great Britain; 8,874,014 pounds to the United States; and\r\n3,904,566 pounds to Germany.\r\n\r\n\"Other countries\" in 1903 included Spain, 49,189 pounds; Italy, 4,104\r\npounds. In 1921, they included Netherlands, 837,496 pounds; Spain,\r\n308,308 pounds; Chile, 9,259 pounds.\r\n\r\nMEXICO. Mexico has naturally sent most of her coffee across the border\r\ninto the United States, and she continued to do so during and after the\r\nwar. But she had worked up a very important trade with Europe, chiefly\r\nwith Germany; and German capital, and German planters and merchants were\r\nprominent in the industry. France and England also were interested in\r\nthe trade, and purchased annually several million pounds. During the\r\nwar, as shown by the exports in its final year, this trade almost\r\nentirely ceased, and the United States and Spain remained as the only\r\nconsumers of Mexican coffee. Details of the after-war trade are not yet\r\navailable in published statistics. In the following table, 1900 and 1918\r\nare calendar years, and 1913 is a fiscal year.\r\n\r\nCOFFEE EXPORTS FROM MEXICO\r\n                     1900        1913        1918\r\n  Exported to       Pounds      Pounds      Pounds\r\nUnited States    28,882,954  28,012,655  23,816,044\r\nGermany          10,074,001  10,461,382\r\nAus.-Hungary        163,934      30,864\r\nBelgium              25,855      39,722\r\nSpain               546,132     184,941   6,184,494\r\nFrance            3,927,294   4,482,011\r\nNetherlands         220,607      46,296\r\nGreat Britain     3,848,605   2,170,669\r\nCuba                467,201      37,921     171,527\r\nItaly               157,653     347,758\r\nOther countries                 655,073\r\n                 ----------  ----------  ----------\r\nTotal            48,314,236  46,469,292  30,172,065\r\n\r\nIn 1913 \"other countries\" included Panama, 342,131 pounds; Canada,\r\n276,567 pounds; Sweden, 3,079 pounds; British Honduras, 33,179 pounds;\r\nDenmark, 112 pounds.\r\n\r\nJAMAICA. The French, more than any other peoples in Europe, have\r\ncultivated a taste for coffee from the West Indies; and France normally\r\nhas led all other countries in shipments from the larger producing\r\nislands, including Jamaica, although the island is a British possession.\r\nIn the year before the war, France bought nearly 4,000,000 pounds of\r\nJamaican coffee, more than half the total production. In the year\r\n1900-01 also she took about 4,000,000 pounds, leading all other\r\ncountries. This trade was very much cut down during the war, but was not\r\nwiped out. As shown in the figures for 1918, England largely took the\r\nplace of France in that year, and Canada increased her purchases several\r\nhundred percent.\r\n\r\nCOFFEE EXPORTS FROM JAMAICA\r\n                 1901 (fis. yr.) 1913         1918\r\n  Exported to       Pounds      Pounds       Pounds\r\nGreat Britain     1,849,456     671,440    6,919,808\r\nCanada              109,536     263,872    1,819,328\r\nUnited States     2,976,512     802,032      643,888\r\nFrance            3,958,304   3,743,264      729,120\r\nAus.-Hungary        104,272     303,296\r\nCuba                114,800\r\nBarbados                        226,464       26,992\r\nOther countries     508,704     507,248       97,440\r\n                 ----------  ----------   ----------\r\nTotal             9,621,584   6,517,616   10,236,576\r\n\r\n\"Other countries\" in 1901 included British West Indies, 316,512 pounds.\r\nIn 1913, they included Netherlands, 125,216 pounds; Norway, 28,896\r\npounds; Sweden, 70,224 pounds; Italy, 46,592 pounds; Australia, 71,456\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nHAITI. Prior to the taking over of the administration of the customs of\r\nHaiti by the United States, detailed statistics of the exports are\r\nalmost wholly lacking. France took most of the annual production,\r\ncontinuing a trade that dated back to old colonial times. An American\r\nconsular report says:\r\n\r\n     Before the war there was no market for Haitian coffee in the United\r\n     States, practically the entire crop going to Europe, with France as\r\n     the largest consumer. However, there has been for some time past a\r\n     determined effort made to create a demand in the United States, and\r\n     this is said to be meeting with ever-increasing success.\r\n\r\nThe actual success achieved can be measured by the following figures for\r\nthe fiscal year ended September 30, 1920:\r\n\r\nCOFFEE EXPORTS FROM HAITI\r\n\r\n   Exported to             Pounds\r\nUnited States           27,647,077\r\nFrance                  23,921,083\r\nGreat Britain               39,583\r\nOther countries         10,362,351\r\n                        __________\r\nTotal                   61,970,094\r\n\r\nThese figures do not include 6,322,167 pounds of coffee triage, or\r\nwaste, of which the United States took 2,028,352 pounds; France,\r\n1,491,507 pounds.\r\n\r\nDOMINICAN REPUBLIC. The comparatively small production of the Dominican\r\nRepublic was divided among the United States and three or four European\r\ncountries before the war. Since the war the exports have been scattered\r\namong the former customers in varying amounts.

In spite of several attempts on the part of Porto-Rican\r\nplanters to make their product popular in the markets of the United\r\nStates, the American consumer has never found the taste of that coffee\r\nto his liking. The big market for the Porto-Rican product has been Cuba,\r\nwhich has depended on her neighbor for most of her supply. This demand\r\ntakes a large part of the annual crop, including the lower grades. The\r\nbetter grades, before the war, went largely to Europe, mostly to the\r\nLatin countries. During the war, the Cuban market carried the\r\nPorto-Rican planters through, although shipments of considerable size\r\ncontinued to go to France and Spain. Recovery of the pre-war trade with\r\nEurope, however, has been slow, Spain being the only country to take\r\nover 1,000,000 pounds in 1920. Shipments to that country totaled\r\n3,472,204 pounds; those to France, 900,868 pounds. Both countries\r\nincreased their purchases considerably in 1921.\r\n\r\nCOFFEE EXPORTS FROM PORTO RICO\r\n\r\n                   1900-01 (fis. yr.)     1913          1921\r\nExported to            Pounds            Pounds        Pounds\r\nUnited States           29,565           628,843       211,531\r\nFrance               3,348,025         6,020,170     1,625,065\r\nSpain                2,590,096         6,851,235     5,705,932\r\nAus.-Hungary           386,158         6,729,726\r\nGermany                493,891           876,315       363,993\r\nBelgium                  9,964            25,867       234,019\r\nItaly                  611,033         3,498,157        43,484\r\nNetherlands              8,860           497,938        25,199\r\nSweden                  32,390[C]        633,046       266,550\r\nCuba                 4,633,538        23,179,690    21,135,397\r\nOther countries         13,720           393,586       356,709\r\n                     _________         _________     _________\r\nTotal               12,157,240        49,334,573    29,967,879\r\n\r\n[C] Includes Norway.\r\n\r\nHAWAII.

Lying on the edge of the war area and on the road to India, Aden\r\nfelt the full force of the disarrangement of commercial traffic by the\r\nwar. Ordinarily, Aden is not only the chief outlet for the coffee of the\r\ninterior of Arabia--the original \"Mocha\"--but it is also the\r\ntranshipping point for large amounts from Africa and India. The figures\r\ngiven below relate for the most part to this transhipped coffee.

The complete\r\nstory of the early cultivation of coffee in the old and new worlds is\r\ntold in chapter II, which deals with the history of the propagation of\r\nthe coffee plant.\r\n\r\nLa Roque[314] was the first to tell how the plant was cultivated and the\r\nberries prepared for market in Arabia, where it was brought from\r\nAbyssinia.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs raised it from seed grown in nurseries, transplanting it to\r\nplantations laid out in the foot-hills of the mountains, to which they\r\nconducted the mountain streams by ingeniously constructed small channels\r\nto water the roots. They built trenches three feet wide and five feet\r\ndeep, lining them with pebbles to cause the water to sink deep into the\r\nearth with which the trenches were filled, to preserve the moisture from\r\ntoo rapid evaporation. These were so constructed that the water could be\r\nturned off into other channels when the fruit began to ripen. In\r\nplantations exposed to the south, a kind of poplar tree was planted\r\nalong the trenches to supply needful shade.\r\n\r\nLa Roque noted that the coffee trees in Yemen were planted in lines,\r\nlike the apple trees in Normandy; and that when they were much exposed\r\nto the sun, the shade poplars were regularly introduced between the\r\nrows.\r\n\r\nSuch cultivation as the plant received in early Abyssinia and Arabia was\r\ncrude and primitive at best. Throughout the intervening centuries, there\r\nhas been little improvement in Yemen; but modern cultural methods obtain\r\nin the Harar district in Abyssinia.\r\n\r\nLike the Arabs in Yemen, the Harari cultivated in small gardens,\r\nemploying the same ingenious system of irrigation from mountain springs\r\nto water the roots of the plants at least once a week during the dry\r\nseason. In Yemen and in Abyssinia the ripened berries were sun-dried on\r\nbeaten-earth barbecues.\r\n\r\nThe European planters who carried the cultivation of the bean to the Far\r\nEast and to America followed the best Arabian practise, changing, and\r\nsometimes improving it, in order to adapt it to local conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Cultivation in General_\r\n\r\nToday the commercial growers of coffee on a large scale practise\r\nintensive cultivation methods, giving the same care to preparing their\r\nplantations and maintaining their trees as do other growers of grains\r\nand fruits. As in the more advanced methods of arboriculture, every\r\neffort is made to obtain the maximum production of quality coffee\r\nconsistent with the smallest outlay of money and labor. Experimental\r\nstations in various parts of the world are constantly working to improve\r\nmethods and products, and to develop types that will resist disease and\r\nadverse climatic conditions.\r\n\r\nWhile cultivation methods in the different producing countries vary in\r\ndetail of practise, the principles are unchanging. Where methods do\r\ndiffer, it is owing principally to local economic conditions, such as\r\nthe supply and cost of labor, machinery, fertilizers, and similar\r\nessential factors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPLEMENTS USED IN EARLY ARABIAN COFFEE CULTURE\r\n\r\n1, Plow. 2 and 3, Mattocks. 4, Hatchet and sickle. Top, Seeder\r\nImplement]\r\n\r\nSOIL. Rocky ground that pulverizes easily--and, if possible, of volcanic\r\norigin--is best for coffee; also, soil rich in decomposed mold. In\r\nBrazil the best soil is known as _terra roxa_, a topsoil of red clay\r\nthree or four feet thick with a gravel subsoil.\r\n\r\nCLIMATE. The natural habitat of the coffee tree (all species) is\r\ntropical Africa, where the climate is hot and humid, and the soil rich\r\nand moist, yet sufficiently friable to furnish well drained seed beds.\r\nThese conditions must be approximated when the tree is grown in other\r\ncountries. Because the trees and fruit generally can not withstand\r\nfrost, they are restricted to regions where the mean annual temperature\r\nis about 70° F., with an average minimum about 55°, and an average\r\nmaximum of about 80°. Where grown in regions subject to more or less\r\nfrost, as in the northernmost parts of Brazil's coffee-producing\r\ndistrict, which lie almost within the south temperate zone, the coffee\r\ntrees are sometimes frosted, as was the case in 1918, when about forty\r\npercent of the São Paulo crop and trees suffered.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the most suitable climate for coffee is a temperate\r\none within the tropics; however, it has been successfully cultivated\r\nbetween latitudes 28° north and 38° south.\r\n\r\nRAINFALL. Although able to grow satisfactorily only on well drained\r\nland, the coffee tree requires an abundance of water, about seventy\r\ninches of rainfall annually, and must have it supplied evenly throughout\r\nthe year. Prolonged droughts are fatal; while, on the other hand, too\r\ngreat a supply of water tends to develop the wood of the tree at the\r\nexpense of the flowers and fruit, especially in low-lying regions.\r\n\r\nALTITUDE. Coffee is found growing in all altitudes, from sea-level up to\r\nthe frost-line, which is about 6,000 feet in the tropics. _Robusta_ and\r\n_liberica_ varieties of coffee do best in regions from sea-level up to\r\n3,000 feet, while _arabica_ flourishes better at the higher levels.\r\n\r\nCarvalho says that the coffee plant needs sun, but that a few hours\r\ndaily exposure is sufficient. Hilly ground has the advantage of offering\r\nthe choice of a suitable exposure, as the sun shines on it for only a\r\npart of the day. Whether it is the early morning or the afternoon sun\r\nthat enables the plant to attain its optimum conditions is a question of\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSS SECTION OF MOUNTAIN SLOPE IN YEMEN, ARABIA, SHOWING\r\nCOFFEE TERRACES\r\n\r\nThese miniature plantations are found chiefly along the caravan route\r\nbetween Hodeida and Sanaa]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLEARING VIRGIN FOREST FOR A COFFEE ESTATE IN MEXICO]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE NURSERY UNDER A BAMBOO ROOF IN COLOMBIA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST STEPS IN COFFEE GROWING]\r\n\r\nIn Mexico, Romero tells us, the highlands of Soconusco have the\r\nadvantage that the sun does not shine on the trees during the whole of\r\nthe day. On the higher slopes of the Cordilleras--from 2,500 feet above\r\nsea-level--clouds prevail during the summer season, when the sun is\r\nhottest, and are frequently present in the other seasons, after ten\r\no'clock in the morning. These keep the trees from being exposed to the\r\nheat of the sun during the whole of the day. Perhaps to this\r\ncircumstance is due the superior excellence of certain coffees grown in\r\nMexico, Colombia, and Sumatra at an altitude of 3,000 feet to 4,000 feet\r\nabove sea-level.\r\n\r\nRichard Spruce, the botanist, in his notes on South America, as quoted\r\nby Alfred Russel Wallace,[315] refers to \"a zone of the equatorial Andes\r\nranging between 4,000 and 6,000 feet altitude, where the best flavored\r\ncoffee is grown.\"\r\n\r\nPROPAGATION. Coffee trees are grown most generally from seeds selected\r\nfrom trees of known productivity and longevity; although in some parts\r\nof the world propagation is done from shoots or cuttings. The seed\r\nmethod is most general, however, the seeds being either propagated in\r\nnursery beds, or planted at once in the spot where the mature tree is to\r\nstand. In the latter case--called planting at stake--four or five seeds\r\nare planted, much as corn is sown; and after germination, all but the\r\nstrongest plant are removed.\r\n\r\nWhere the nursery method is followed, the choicest land of the\r\nplantation is chosen for its site; and the seeds are planted in forcing\r\nbeds, sometimes called cold-frames. When the plants are to be\r\ntransplanted direct to the plantation, the seeds are generally sown six\r\ninches apart and in rows separated by the same distance, and are covered\r\nwith only a slight sprinkling of earth. When the plants are to be\r\ntransferred from the first bed to another, and then to the plantation,\r\nthe seeds are sown more thickly; and the plants are \"pricked\" out as\r\nneeded, and set out in another forcing bed.\r\n\r\nDuring the six to seven weeks required for the coffee seed to germinate,\r\nthe soil must be kept moist and shaded and thoroughly weeded. If the\r\ntrees are to be grown without shade, the young plants are gradually\r\nexposed to the sun, to harden them, before they begin their existence in\r\nthe plantation proper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE TREE NURSERY, PANAJABAL, POCHUTA, GUATEMALA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRYING GROUNDS AND FACTORY IN THE PREANGER REGENCY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NATIVE TRANSPORT, FIELD TO FACTORY, AT DRAMAGA, NEAR\r\nBUITENZORG]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE SCENES IN JAVA, NETHERLANDS EAST INDIES]\r\n\r\nConsiderable experimental work has been done in renewing trees by\r\ngrafting, notably in Java; but practically all commercial planters\r\nfollow the seed method.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE GROWING UNDER SHADE, PORTO RICO]\r\n\r\nPREPARING THE PLANTATION. Before transplanting time has come, the\r\nplantation itself has been made ready to receive the young plants.\r\nCoffee plantations are generally laid out on heavily wooded and sloping\r\nlands, most often in forests on mountainsides and plateaus, where there\r\nis an abundance of water, of which large quantities are used in\r\ncultivating the trees and in preparing the coffee beans for market. The\r\nsoil most suitable is friable, sandy, or even gravelly, with an\r\nabundance of rocks to keep the soil comparatively cool and well drained,\r\nas well as to supply a source of food by action of the weather. The\r\nideal soil is one that contains a large proportion of potassium and\r\nphosphoric acid; and for that reason, the general practise is to burn\r\noff the foliage and trees covering the land and to use the ashes as\r\nfertilizer.\r\n\r\nIn preparing the soil for the new plantation under the intensive\r\ncultivation method, the surface of the land is lightly plowed, and then\r\nfollowed up with thorough cultivation. When transplanting time comes,\r\nwhich is when the plant is about a year old, and stands from twelve to\r\neighteen inches high with its first pairs of primary branches, the\r\nplants are set out in shallow holes at regular intervals of from eight\r\nto twelve, or even fourteen, feet apart. This gives room for the root\r\nsystem to develop, provides space for sunlight to reach each tree, and\r\nmakes for convenience in cultivating and harvesting. _Liberica_ and\r\n_robusta_ type trees require more room than _arabica._ When set twelve\r\nfeet apart, which is the general practise, with the same distance\r\nmaintained between rows, there are approximately four hundred and fifty\r\ntrees to the acre. In the triangle, or hexagon, system the trees are\r\nplanted in the form of an equilateral triangle, each tree being the same\r\ndistance (usually eight or nine feet) from its six nearest neighbors.\r\nThis system permits of 600 to 800 trees per acre.\r\n\r\nSHADE AND WIND BREAKS. Strong, chilly winds and intensely hot sunlight\r\nare foes of coffee trees, especially of the _arabica_ variety.\r\nAccordingly, in most countries it is customary to protect the plantation\r\nwith wind-breaks consisting of rugged trees, and to shade the coffee by\r\ngrowing trees of other kinds between the rows. The shade trees serve\r\nalso to check soil erosion; and in the case of the leguminous kinds, to\r\nfurnish nutriment to the soil. Coffee does best in shade such as is\r\nafforded by the silk oak (_Grevillea robusta_). In _Shade in Coffee\r\nCulture_ (_Bulletin_ 25, 1901, division of botany, United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture), O.F. Cook goes extensively into this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe methods employed in the care of a coffee plantation do not differ\r\nmaterially from those followed by advanced orchardists in the colder\r\nfruit-belts of the world. After the young plants have gained their\r\nstart, they are cultivated frequently, principally to keep out the\r\nweeds, to destroy pests, and to aerate the earth. The implements used\r\nrange from crude hand-plows to horse-drawn cultivators.\r\n\r\nFERTILIZING. Comparatively little fertilizing is done on plantations\r\nestablished on virgin soil until the trees begin to bear, which occurs\r\nwhen they are about three years of age. Because the coffee tree takes\r\npotash, nitrogen, and phosphoric acid from the soil, the scheme of\r\nfertilizing is to restore these elements. The materials used to replace\r\nthe soil-constituents consist of stable manure, leguminous plants,\r\ncoffee-tree prunings, leaves, certain weeds, oil cake, bone and fish\r\nmeal, guano, wood ashes, coffee pulp and parchment, and such chemical\r\nfertilizers as superphosphate of lime, basic slag, sulphate of ammonia,\r\nnitrate of lime, sulphate of potash, nitrate of potash, and similar\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nThe relative values of these fertilizers depend largely upon local\r\nclimate and soil conditions, the supply, the cost, and other like\r\nfactors. The chemical fertilizers are coming into increasing use in the\r\nlarger and more economically advanced producing countries. Brazil,\r\nparticularly, is showing in late years a tendency toward their adoption\r\nto make up for the dwindling supply of the so-called natural manures. As\r\nthe coffee tree grows older, it requires a larger supply of fertilizer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FAMOUS BOEKIT GOMPONG ESTATE, NEAR PADANG, ON\r\nSUMATRA'S WEST COAST\r\n\r\nShowing the healthy, regular appearance of well-cultivated coffee\r\nbushes, twenty-six years old. Also note the line of feathery bamboo\r\nwind-breaks]\r\n\r\nPRUNING. On the larger plantations, pruning is an important part of the\r\ncultivation processes. If left to their own devices, coffee trees\r\nsometimes grow as high as forty feet, the strength being absorbed by the\r\nwood, with a consequent scanty production of fruit. To prevent this\r\nundesirable result, and to facilitate picking, the trees on the more\r\nmodern plantations are pruned down to heights ranging from six to twelve\r\nfeet. Except for pruning the roots when transplanting, the tree is\r\npermitted to grow until after producing its first full crop before any\r\ncutting takes place. Then, the branches are severely cut back; and\r\nthereafter, pruning is carried on annually. Topping and pruning begin\r\nbetween the first and the second years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE ESTATE IN ANTIOQUIA, COLOMBIA, SHOWING\r\nWIND-BREAKS]\r\n\r\nCoffee trees as a rule produce full crops from the sixth to the\r\nfifteenth year, although some trees have given a paying crop until\r\ntwenty or thirty years old. Ordinarily the trees bear from one-half\r\npound to eight pounds of coffee annually, although there are accounts of\r\ntwelve pounds being obtained per tree. Production is mostly governed by\r\nthe cultivation given the tree, and by climate, soil, and location. When\r\ntoo old to bear profitable yields, the trees on commercial plantations\r\nare cut down to the level of the ground; and are renewed by permitting\r\nonly the strongest sprout springing out of the stump to mature.\r\n\r\nCATCH CROPS. On some plantations it has become the practise to grow\r\ncatch crops between the rows of coffee trees, both as a means of\r\nobtaining additional revenue and to shade the young coffee plants. Corn,\r\nbeans, cotton, peanuts, and similar plants are most generally used.\r\n\r\nPESTS AND DISEASES. The coffee tree, its wood, foliage, and fruit, have\r\ntheir enemies, chief among which are insects, fungi, rodents (the\r\n\"coffee rat\"), birds, squirrels, and--according to Rossignon--elephants,\r\nbuffalo, and native cattle, which have a special liking for the tender\r\nleaves of the coffee plant. Insects and fungi are the most bothersome\r\npests on most plantations. Among the insects, the several varieties of\r\nborers are the principal foes, boring into the wood of the trunk and\r\nbranches to lay _larvae_ which sap the life from the tree. There are\r\nscale insects whose excretion forms a black mold on the leaves and\r\naffects the nutrition by cutting off the sunlight. Numerous kinds of\r\nbeetles, caterpillars, grasshoppers, and crickets attack the coffee-tree\r\nleaves, the so-called \"leaf-miner\" being especially troublesome. The\r\nMediterranean fruit fly deposits _larvae_ which destroy or lessen the\r\nworth of the coffee berry by tunneling within and eating the contents of\r\nthe parchment. The coffee-berry beetle and its grub also live within the\r\ncoffee berry.\r\n\r\nAmong the most destructive fungoid diseases is the so-called Ceylon leaf\r\ndisease, which is caused by the _Hemileia vastatrix_, a fungus related\r\nto the wheat rust. It was this disease which ruined the coffee industry\r\nin Ceylon, where it first appeared in 1869, and since has been found in\r\nother coffee-producing regions of Asia and Africa. America has a similar\r\ndisease, caused by the _Sphaerostilbe flavida_, that is equally\r\ndestructive if not vigilantly guarded against. (See chapters XV and\r\nXVI.)\r\n\r\nThe coffee-tree roots also are subject to attack. There is the root\r\ndisease, prevalent in all countries, and for which no cause has yet been\r\ndefinitely assigned, although it has been determined that it is of a\r\nfungoid nature. Brazil, and some other American coffee-producing\r\ncountries, have a serious disease caused by the eelworm, and for that\r\nreason called the eelworm disease.\r\n\r\nCoffee planters combat pests and diseases principally with sprays, as in\r\nother lines of advanced arboriculture. It is a constant battle,\r\nespecially on the large commercial plantations, and constitutes a large\r\nitem on the expense sheet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cultivation by Countries_\r\n\r\nCoffee-cultivation methods vary somewhat in detail in the different\r\nproducing countries. The foregoing description covers the underlying\r\nprinciples in practise throughout the world; while the following is\r\nintended to show the local variations in vogue in the principal\r\ncountries of production, together with brief descriptions of the main\r\nproducing districts, the altitudes, character of soil, climate, and\r\nother factors that are peculiar to each country. In general, they are\r\nconsidered in the order of their relative importance as producing\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nBRAZIL. In Brazil, the Giant of South America, and the world's largest\r\ncoffee producer, the methods of cultivation naturally have reached a\r\nhigh point of development, although the soil and the climate were not at\r\nfirst regarded as favorable. The year 1723 is generally accepted as the\r\ndate of the introduction of the coffee plant into Brazil from French\r\nGuiana. Coffee planting was slow in developing, however, until 1732,\r\nwhen the governor of the states of Pará and Maranhao urged its\r\ncultivation. Sixteen years later, there were 17,000 trees in Pará. From\r\nthat year on, slow but steady progress was made; and by 1770, an export\r\ntrade had been begun from the port of Pará to countries in Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UP-TO-DATE WEEDING AND HARROWING, SÃO PAULO]\r\n\r\nThe spread of the industry began about this time. The coffee tree was\r\nintroduced into the state of Rio de Janeiro in 1770. From there its\r\ncultivation was gradually extended into the states of São Paulo, Minãs\r\nGeraes, Bahia, and Espirito Santo, which have become the great\r\ncoffee-producing sections of Brazil. The cultivation of the plant did\r\nnot become especially noteworthy until the third decade of the\r\nnineteenth century. Large crops were gathered in the season of 1842-43;\r\nand by the middle of the century, the plantations were producing\r\nannually more than 2,000,000 bags.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph by Courtesy of J. Aron & Co.\r\n\r\nGENERAL VIEW OF FAZENDA DUMONT, RIBEIRAO PRETO, SÃO PAULO, BRAZIL]\r\n\r\nBrazil's commercial coffee-growing region has an estimated area of\r\napproximately 1,158,000 square miles, and extends from the river Amazon\r\nto the southern border of the state of São Paulo, and from the Atlantic\r\ncoast to the western boundary of the state of Matto Grosso. This area is\r\nlarger than that section of the United States lying east of the\r\nMississippi River, with Texas added. In every state of the republic,\r\nfrom Ceará in the north to Santa Catharina in the south, the coffee tree\r\ncan be cultivated profitably; and is, in fact, more or less grown in\r\nevery state, if only for domestic use. However, little attention is\r\ngiven to coffee-growing in the north, except in the state of Pernambuco,\r\nwhich has only about 1,500,000 trees, as compared, with the 764,000,000\r\ntrees of São Paulo in 1922.\r\n\r\nThe chief coffee-growing plantations in Brazil are situated on plateaus\r\nseldom less than 1,800 feet above sea-level, and ranging up to 4,000\r\nfeet. The mean annual temperature is approximately 70° F., ranging from\r\na mean of 60.8° in winter to a mean of 72° in summer. The temperature\r\nhas been known, however, to register 32° in winter and 97.7° in summer.\r\n\r\nWhile coffee trees will grow in almost any part of Brazil, experience\r\nindicates that the two most fertile soils, the _terra roxa_ and the\r\n_massape_, lie in the \"coffee belts.\" The _terra roxa_ is a dark red\r\nearth, and is practically confined to São Paulo, and to it is due the\r\npredominant coffee productivity of that state. _Massape_ is a yellow,\r\ndark red--or even black--soil, and occurs more or less contiguous to the\r\n_terra roxa_. With a covering of loose sand, it makes excellent coffee\r\nland.\r\n\r\nBrazil planters follow the nursery-propagated method of planting, and\r\ncultivate, prune, and spray their trees liberally. Transplanting is done\r\nin the months from November to February.\r\n\r\nCoffee-growing profits have shown a decided falling off in Brazil in\r\nrecent years. In 1900 it was not uncommon for a coffee estate to yield\r\nan annual profit of from 100 to 250 percent. Ten years later the average\r\nreturns did not exceed twelve percent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAZENDA GUATAPARA, SÃO PAULO, BRAZIL, WITH 800,000 TREES\r\nIN BEARING]\r\n\r\nIn Brazil's coffee belt there are two seasons--the wet, running from\r\nSeptember to March; and the dry, running from April to August. The\r\ncoffee trees are in bloom from September to December. The blossoms last\r\nabout four days, and are easily beaten off by light winds or rains. If\r\nthe rains or winds are violent, the green berries may be similarly\r\ndestroyed; so that great damage may be caused by unseasonable rains and\r\nstorms.\r\n\r\nThe harvest usually begins in April or May, and extends well into the\r\ndry season. Even in the picking season, heavy rains and strong\r\nwinds--especially the latter--may do considerable damage; for in Brazil\r\nshade trees and wind-breaks are the exception.\r\n\r\nApproximately twenty-five percent of the São Paulo plantations are\r\ncultivated by machinery. A type of cultivator very common is similar to\r\nthe small corn-plow used in the United States. The Planet Junior,\r\nmanufactured by a well known United States agricultural-machinery firm,\r\nis the most popular cultivator. It is drawn by a small mule, with a boy\r\nto lead it, and a man to drive and to guide the plow.\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of the coffee over other industries in São Paulo is\r\nshown in many ways. A few years ago the registration of laborers in all\r\nindustries was about 450,000; and of this total, 420,000 were employed\r\nin the production and transportation of coffee alone. Of the capital\r\ninvested in all industries, about eighty-five percent was in coffee\r\nproduction and commerce, including the railroads that depended upon it\r\ndirectly. An estimated value of $482,500,000 was placed upon the\r\nplantations in the state, including land, machinery, the residences of\r\nowners, and laborers' quarters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Copyright by Brown & Dawson.\r\n\r\nPICKING COFFEE IN SÃO PAULO]\r\n\r\nIn all Brazil, there are approximately 1,200,000,000 coffee trees. The\r\nnumber of bearing coffee trees in São Paulo alone increased from\r\n735,000,000 in 1914-15 to 834,000,000 in 1917-18. The crop in 1917-18\r\nwas 1,615,000,000 pounds, one of the largest on record. In the\r\nagricultural year of 1922-23 there were 764,969,500 coffee trees in\r\nbearing in São Paulo, and in São Paulo, Minãs, and Parana, 824,194,500.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph by Courtesy of J. Aron & Co.\r\n\r\nINTENSIVE CULTIVATION METHODS IN THE RIBEIRAO PRETO DISTRICT, SÃO PAULO]\r\n\r\nPlantations having from 300,000 to 400,000 trees are common. One\r\nplantation near Ribeirao Preto has 5,000,000 trees, and requires an army\r\nof 6,000 laborers to work it. Another planter owns thirty-two adjacent\r\nplantations containing, in all, from 7,500,000 to 8,000,000 coffee trees\r\nand gives employment to 8,000 persons. There are fifteen plantations\r\nhaving more than 1,000,000 trees each, and five of these have more than\r\n2,000,000 trees each. In the municipality of Ribeirao Preto there were\r\n30,000,000 trees in 1922.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph by Courtesy of J. Aron & Co.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE RAILROAD ON A SÃO PAULO COFFEE FAZENDA\r\n\r\nShowing coffee trees and laborers' houses in the middle distance at\r\nright]\r\n\r\nThe largest coffee plantations in the world are the Fazendas Dumont and\r\nthe Fazendas Schmidt. The Fazendas Dumont were valued, in 1915, in cost\r\nof land and improvements, at $5,920,007; and since those figures were\r\ngiven out, the value of the investment has much increased. Of the\r\nvarious Fazendas Schmidt, the largest, owned by Colonel Francisco\r\nSchmidt, in 1918 had 9,000,000 trees with an annual yield of 200,000\r\nbags, or 26,400,000 pounds, of coffee. Other large plantations in São\r\nPaulo with a million or more trees, are the Companhia Agricola Fazenda\r\nDumont, 2,420,000 trees; Companhia São Martinho, 2,300,000 trees;\r\nCompanhia Dumont, 2,000,000 trees; São Paulo Coffee Company, 1,860,000\r\ntrees; Christiana Oxorio de Oliveira, 1,790,000 trees; Companhia\r\nGuatapara, 1,550,000 trees; Dr. Alfredo Ellis, 1,271,000 trees;\r\nCompanhia Agricola Araqua, 1,200,000 trees; Companhia Agricola Ribeirao\r\nPreto, 1,138,000 trees; Rodriguez Alves Irmaos, 1,060,000 trees;\r\nFrancisca Silveira do Val, 1,050,000 trees; Luiza de Oliveira Azevedo,\r\n1,045,000 trees; and the Companhia Caféeria São Paulo, 1,000,000 trees.\r\n\r\nThe average annual yield in São Paulo is estimated at from 1,750 to\r\n4,000 pounds from a thousand trees, while in exceptional instances it is\r\nsaid that as much as 6,000 pounds per 1,000 trees have been gathered.\r\nDifferences in local climatic conditions, in ages of trees, in richness\r\nof soil, and in the care exercised in cultivation, are given as the\r\nreasons for the wide variation.\r\n\r\nThe oldest coffee-growing district in São Paulo is Campinas. There are\r\n136 others.\r\n\r\nBahia coffee is not so carefully cultivated and harvested as the Santos\r\ncoffee. The introduction of capital and modern methods would do much for\r\nBahia, which has the advantage of a shorter haul to the New York and the\r\nEuropean markets.\r\n\r\nOn the average, something like seventy percent of the world's coffee\r\ncrop is grown in Brazil, and two-thirds of this is produced in São\r\nPaulo. Coffee culture in many districts of São Paulo has been brought to\r\nthe point of highest development; and yet its product is essentially a\r\nquantity, not a quality, one.\r\n\r\nCOLOMBIA. In Colombia, coffee is the principal crop grown for export. It\r\nis produced in nearly all departments at elevations ranging from 3,500\r\nfeet to 6,500 feet. Chief among the coffee-growing departments are\r\nAntioquia (capital, Medellin); Caldas (capital, Manizales); Magdalena\r\n(capital, Santa Marta); Santander (capital, Bucaramanga); Tolima\r\n(capital, Ibague); and the Federal District (capital, Bogota). The\r\ndepartment of Cundinamarca produces a coffee that is counted one of the\r\nbest of Colombian grades. The finest grades are grown in the foot-hills\r\nof the Andes, in altitudes from 3,500 to 4,500 feet above sea level.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CONDUCTING SLUICEWAY AT GUATAPARA\r\n\r\nThe running water carries the picked coffee berries to pulpers and\r\nwashing tanks]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE PICKING AND FIELD TRANSPORT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE CULTURE IN SÃO PAULO, BRAZIL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A NEAR VIEW OF A HEAVILY LADEN COFFEE TREE ON A BOGOTA\r\nPLANTATION]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PICKING COFFEE ON A BOGOTA PLANTATION]\r\n\r\nMethods of planting, cultivation, gathering, and preparing the Colombian\r\ncoffee crop for the market are substantially those that are common in\r\nall coffee-producing countries, although they differ in some small\r\nparticulars. About 700 trees are usually planted to the acre, and native\r\ntrees furnish the necessary shade. The average yield is one pound per\r\ntree per year.\r\n\r\nWhile _Coffea arabica_ has been mostly cultivated in Colombia, as in the\r\nother countries of South America, the _liberica_ variety has not been\r\nneglected. Seeds of the _liberica_ tree were planted here soon after\r\n1880, and were moderately successful. Since 1900, more attention has\r\nbeen given to _liberica_, and attempts have been made to grow it upon\r\nbanana and rubber plantations, which seem to provide all the shade\r\nprotection that is needed. _Liberica_ coffee trees begin to bear in\r\ntheir third year. From the fifth year, when a crop of about 650 pounds\r\nto the acre can reasonably be expected, the productiveness steadily\r\nincreases until after fifteen or sixteen years, when a maximum of over\r\none thousand pounds an acre is attained.\r\n\r\nAntioquia is the largest coffee producing department in the republic,\r\nand its coffee is of the highest grade grown. Medellin, the capital,\r\nwhere the business interests of the industry are concentrated, is a\r\nhandsome white city located on the banks of the Aburra river, in a\r\npicturesque valley that is overlooked by the high peaks of the Andean\r\nrange. It is a town of about 80,000 inhabitants, thriving as a\r\nmanufacturing center, abundant in modern improvements, and is the center\r\nof a coffee production of 500,000 bags known in the market as Medellin\r\nand Manizales. Another center in this coffee region is the town of\r\nManizales, perched on the crest of the Andean spurs to dominate the\r\nvalley extending to Medellin and the Cauca valley to the Pacific.\r\nThere-about many small coffee growers are settled, and several hundred\r\nthousand bags of the beans pass through annually.\r\n\r\nOne of the interesting plantations of the country was started a few\r\nyears ago in a remote region by an enterprising American investor. It\r\nwas located on the slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountains 3,000 to 5,000\r\nfeet above sea-level, about twenty-five miles from the city of Santa\r\nMarta. An extended acreage of forest-covered land was acquired, about\r\n600 acres of which were cleared and either planted in coffee or reserved\r\nfor pasturage and other kinds of agriculture. When the plantation came\r\nto maturity, it had nearly 300,000 trees. In 1919, there were 425,000\r\ntrees producing 3,600 hundred-weight of coffee.\r\n\r\nA typical Colombian plantation is the Namay, owned by one of the bankers\r\nof the Banco de Colombia of Bogota. It is located a good half day's\r\ntravel by rail and horseback from the city, about 5,000 feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea. There are 1,000 acres in the plantation, with 250,000\r\ntrees having an ultimate productive capacity of nearly 2,000 bags a\r\nyear. During crop times, which are from May to July, about two hundred\r\nfamilies are needed on an estate of this size.\r\n\r\nVENEZUELA. Seeds of the coffee plant were brought into Venezuela from\r\nMartinique in 1784 by a priest who started a small plantation near\r\nCaracas. Five years later, the first export of the bean was made, 233\r\nbags, or about 30,000 pounds. Within fifty years, production had\r\nincreased to upward of 50,000,000 pounds annually; and by the end of the\r\nnineteenth century, to more than 100,000,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nSituated between the equator and the twelfth parallel of north latitude,\r\nin the world's coffee belt, this country has an area equal to that of\r\nall the United States east of the Mississippi river and north of the\r\nOhio and Potomac rivers, or greater than that of France, Germany, and\r\nthe Netherlands combined--599,533 square miles.\r\n\r\nThe chain of the Maritime Andes, reaching eastward across Colombia and\r\nVenezuela, approaches the Caribbean coast in the latter country. Along\r\nthe slopes and foot-hills of these mountains are produced some of the\r\nfinest grades of South American coffee. Here the best coffee grows in\r\nthe _tierra templada_ and in the lower part of the _tierra fria_, and is\r\nknown as the _café de tierra fria_, or coffee of the cold, or high,\r\nland. In these regions the equable climate, the constant and adequate\r\nmoisture, the rich and well-drained soil, and the protecting forest\r\nshade afford the conditions under which the plant grows and thrives\r\nbest. On the fertile lowland valleys nearer the coast grows the _café de\r\ntierra caliente_, or coffee of the hot land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE ALTAMIRA HACIENDA, VENEZUELA\r\n\r\nThe long pipe crossing the center of the picture is a water sluiceway\r\nbringing coffee down from the hills]\r\n\r\nCoffee growing has become the main agricultural pursuit of the country.\r\nIn 1839 it was estimated that there were 8,900 acres of land planted in\r\ncoffee, and in 1888 there were 168,000,000 coffee trees in the country\r\non 346,000 acres of land. In the opening years of the twentieth century\r\nnot far from 250,000 acres were devoted to this cultivation, comprised\r\nin upward of 33,000 plantations. The average yield per acre is about\r\n250 pounds. The trees are usually planted from two to two and a quarter\r\nmeters apart, and this gives about 800 trees to the acre. The triangle\r\nsystem is unknown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARMEN HACIENDA, FRONTING ON THE ESCALANTE RIVER,\r\nVENEZUELA]\r\n\r\nIn this country, the coffee tree bears its first crop when four or five\r\nyears old. The trees are not subject to unusual hazards from the attacks\r\nof injurious insects and animals or from serious parasitic diseases.\r\nNature is kind to them, and their only serious contention for existence\r\narises from the luxuriant tropical vegetation by which they are\r\nsurrounded. On the whole their cultivation is comparatively easy. On the\r\nbest managed estates there are not more than 1,000 trees to a\r\n_fanegada_--about one and three-quarters acres of land--and it is\r\ncalculated that an average annual yield for such a _fanegada_ should be\r\nabout twenty quintals, a little more than 2,032 pounds of merchantable\r\ncoffee. It is to be noted, however, that the average yield per tree\r\nthroughout Venezuela is low--not more than four ounces.\r\n\r\nThere are no great coffee belts as in Mexico and Central America. Many\r\ndistricts are days' rides apart. The plantations are isolated, and there\r\nis lacking a co-operative spirit among the growers.\r\n\r\nMethods of cultivating and preparing the berry for the market are\r\nsubstantially those that prevail elsewhere in South America. Most\r\nplantations are handled in ordinary, old-fashioned ways; but the better\r\nestates employ machinery and methods of the most advanced and improved\r\ncharacter at all points of their operation, from the planting of the\r\nseed to the final marketing of the berry.\r\n\r\nJAVA. Java, the oldest coffee-producing country in which the tree is not\r\nindigenous, was producing a high-grade coffee long before Brazil,\r\nColombia, and Venezuela entered the industry; and it held its supremacy\r\nin the world's trade for many years before the younger American\r\nproducing countries were able to surpass its annual output. The first\r\nattempt to introduce the plant into Java took place in 1696, the\r\nseedlings being brought from Malabar in India and planted at Kadawoeng,\r\nnear Batavia. Earthquake and flood soon destroyed the plants; and in\r\n1699 Henricus Zwaardecroon brought the second lot of seedlings from\r\nMalabar. These became the progenitors of all the _arabica_ coffees of\r\nthe Dutch East Indies. The industry grew, and in 1711 the first Java\r\ncoffee was sold at public auction in Amsterdam. Exports amounted to\r\n116,587 pounds in 1720; and in 1724 the Amsterdam market sold 1,396,486\r\npounds of coffee from Java.\r\n\r\nFrom the early part of the nineteenth century up to 1905, cultivation\r\nwas carried on under a Dutch government monopoly--excepting for the\r\nfive years, 1811-16, when the British had control of the island. The\r\ngovernment monopoly was first established when Marshal Daendels, acting\r\nfor the crown of Holland, took control of the islands from the\r\nNetherlands East India Company. Before that time, the princes of\r\nPreanger had raised all the coffee under the provisions of a treaty made\r\nin the middle of the eighteenth century, by which they paid an annual\r\ntribute in coffee to the company for the privilege of retaining their\r\nland revenues. When the Dutch government recovered the islands from the\r\nBritish, the plantations, which had been permitted to go to ruin, were\r\nput in order again, and the government system re-established.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HEAVY FRUITING OF COFFEA ROBUSTA IN JAVA]\r\n\r\nA modification of the first monopoly plan of the government was put into\r\neffect later in the régime of Governor Van den Bosch, and was maintained\r\nuntil into the twentieth century. Under the Daendels plan, each native\r\nfamily was required to keep 1000 coffee trees in bearing on village\r\nlands, and to give to the government two-fifths of the crop, delivered\r\ncleaned and sorted, at the government store. The natives retained the\r\nother three-fifths. Under the Van den Bosch system, each family was\r\nrequired to raise and care for 650 trees and to deliver the crop cleaned\r\nand sorted to the government stores at a fixed price. The government\r\nthen sold the coffee at public auctions in Batavia, Padang, Amsterdam,\r\nor Rotterdam.\r\n\r\nThis method of fostering the new industry resulted in government control\r\nof fully four-fifths of the area under the crop, only the small balance\r\nbeing owned or worked independently by private enterprise. For many\r\nyears after the cultivation had been fully started, this condition of\r\nthe business persisted. Most of the privately-operated plantations had\r\nbeen in existence before the government had set up its monopoly system.\r\nOthers were on the estates of native princes who, in treating with the\r\nDutch, had been able to retain some of their original sovereign rights.\r\nWhile these plans worked well in encouraging the industry at the outset,\r\nthey were not conducive to the fullest possibilities in production.\r\nForced labor on the government plantations was naturally apt to be slow,\r\ncareless, and indifferent. Private ownership and operation bettered this\r\nsomewhat, the private estates being able to show annual yields of from\r\none to two pounds per tree as compared with only a little more than\r\none-half pound per tree on government-controlled estates.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time, the system of private ownership gradually\r\nexpanded beyond that of the government; and before the end of the\r\nnineteenth century, private owners were growing and exporting more\r\ncoffee than did the Javanese government. The government withdrew from\r\nthe coffee business in Java in 1905, and the last government auction was\r\nheld in June of that year. The monopoly in Sumatra was given up in 1908.\r\nAfter that, however, coffee continued to be grown on government lands,\r\nbut in much less quantity than in the years immediately preceding. The\r\nDutch government withdrew from all coffee cultivation in 1918-19.\r\n\r\nAccording to statistics, the ground under cultivation for all kinds of\r\ncoffee in Java and the other islands of the Dutch East Indies in 1919\r\nwas 142,272 acres, of which 112,138 acres were in Java. Of this area,\r\n110,903 acres were planted with _robusta_, 15,314 acres with _arabica_,\r\n4,940 with _liberica_, and 11,115 with other varieties.\r\n\r\nThere were more than 400 European-managed estates in 1915, covering a\r\nplanted area of about 209,000 acres. Three hundred and thirty of these\r\nestates, representing 165,000 acres, were in Java. On that island\r\nproduction in 1904 was 47,927,000 pounds; in 1905, 59,092,000 pounds; in\r\n1906, 66,953,000 pounds; in 1907, 31,044,000 pounds; 1908, 39,349,000\r\npounds. The total crop in 1919 for all the Netherlands East Indies was\r\n97,361,000 pounds, as against 140,764,800 pounds for 1918.\r\n\r\nIntensive cultivation methods on the European-operated plantations in\r\nJava have been practised for many years; and the Netherlands East Indies\r\ngovernment has long maintained experimental stations for the purpose of\r\nimproving strains and cultivation methods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAD THROUGH A COFFEE ESTATE IN EAST JAVA]\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the island, especially in the highlands, the climate\r\nand soil are ideal for coffee culture. The _robusta_ tree grows\r\nsatisfactorily even at altitudes of less than 1,000 feet in some\r\nregions; but its bearing life is only about ten years, as compared with\r\nthe thirty years of the _arabica_ at altitudes of from 3,000 to 4,000\r\nfeet. The low-ground trees generally produce earlier and more\r\nabundantly. On some of the highland plantations, pruning is not\r\npractised to any great extent, and the trees often reach thirty or forty\r\nfeet in height. This necessitates the use of ladders in picking; but\r\nfrequently the yield per tree has been from six to seven pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NATIVE PICKING COFFEE, SUMATRA]\r\n\r\nCoffee is produced commercially in nearly every political district in\r\nJava, but the bulk of the yield is obtained from East Java. The names\r\nbest known to European and American traders are those of the regencies\r\nof Besoeki and Pasoeroean; because their coffees make up eighty-seven\r\npercent of Java's production. Some of the other better known districts\r\nare: Preanger, Cheribon, Kadoe, Samarang, Soerabaya, and Tegal.\r\n\r\nThe _arabica_ variety has practically been driven out of the districts\r\nbelow 3,500 feet altitude by the leaf disease, and has been succeeded by\r\nthe more hardy _robusta_ and _liberica_ coffees and their hybrids.\r\nIllustrating the importance of _robusta_ coffee, Netherlands East India\r\ngovernment in a statement issued August, 1919, estimated the area under\r\ncultivation on all islands as follows: _robusta_, eighty-four percent;\r\n_arabica_, five and one-half percent; _liberica_, four and one-half\r\npercent. The balance, six percent, was made up of scores of other\r\nvarieties, among the most important being the _canephora_, _Ugandæ_,\r\n_baukobensis_, _suakurensis_, _Quillou_, _stenophylla_, and\r\n_rood-bessige_. All of these are similar to _robusta_, and are exported\r\nas _robusta-achtigen_ (_robusta_-like). The _liberica_ group includes\r\nthe _excelsa_, _abeokuta_, _Dewevrei_, _arnoldiana_, _aruwimiensis_, and\r\n_Dybowskii_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PALATIAL BUNGALOW OF ADMINISTRATOR, DRAMAGA, IN THE\r\nPREANGER DISTRICT, JAVA]\r\n\r\nSUMATRA. Practically all the coffee districts in Sumatra are on the west\r\ncoast, where the plant was first propagated early in the eighteenth\r\ncentury. Padang, the capital city, is the headquarters for Sumatra\r\ncoffee. With climate and soil similar to Java, the island of Sumatra has\r\nthe added advantage that its land is not \"coffee _moe_\", or coffee\r\ntired, as is the case in parts of Java. Some of the world's best coffees\r\nare still coming from Sumatra; and the island has possibilities that\r\ncould make it an important factor in production. Sumatra produced\r\n287,179 piculs of coffee in 1920. The total production of all the\r\nislands that year was 807,591 piculs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD-TIME SAILING VESSEL LOADING IN PADANG ROADS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF A DUTCH COFFEE-CLEANING FACTORY, PADANG]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE SCENES IN SUMATRA, NETHERLANDS EAST INDIES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADMINISTRATOR'S BUNGALOW ON THE GADOENG BATOE ESTATE,\r\nSUMATRA]\r\n\r\nThe districts of Ankola, Siboga, Ayer Bangies, Mandheling, Palembang,\r\nPadang, and Benkoelen, on the west coast, have some of the largest\r\nestates on the island; and their products are well known in\r\ninternational trade. The east coast has recently gone in for heavy\r\nplantings of _robusta_.\r\n\r\nAs in Java, coffee for a century or more was cultivated under the\r\ngovernment-monopoly scheme. The compulsory system was given up in this\r\nisland in 1908, three years after it was abandoned in Java.\r\n\r\nOTHER EAST INDIES. Coffee is grown in several of the other islands in\r\nthe Dutch East Indian archipelago, chiefly on the Celebes, Bali, Lombok,\r\nthe Moluccas, and Timor. Most of the estates are under native control,\r\nand the methods of cultivation are not up to the standard of the\r\nEuropean-owned plantations on the larger islands of Java and Sumatra.\r\nThe most important of these islands is Celebes, where the first coffee\r\nplant was introduced from Java about 1750, but where cultivation was not\r\ncarried on to any great extent until about seventy-five years later. In\r\n1822 the production amounted to 10,000 pounds; in 1917, the yield was\r\n1,322,328 pounds.\r\n\r\nSALVADOR. Coffee, which is far and away the most important crop in\r\nSalvador, constitutes in value more than one-half the total exports. It\r\nhas been cultivated since about 1852, when plants were brought from\r\nHavana; but the development of the industry in its early years was not\r\nrapid. The first large plantations were established in 1876 in La Paz,\r\nand that department has become the leading coffee-producing section of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThe berry is grown in all districts that have altitudes of from 1,500 to\r\n4,000 feet. Besides those of La Paz, the most productive plantations are\r\nin the departments of Santa Ana, Sonsonate, San Salvador, San Vincente,\r\nSan Miguel, Santa Tecla, and Ahuachapan. In contrast with several of the\r\nadjoining Central American republics, native Salvadoreans are the owners\r\nof most of the coffee farms, very few having passed into the hands of\r\nforeigners. The laborers are almost entirely native Indians. A\r\nconsiderable part of the work of cultivating and preparing the berry for\r\nthe market is still done by hand; but in recent years machinery has been\r\nset up on the large estates and for general use in the receiving\r\ncenters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WELL CULTIVATED YOUNG COFFEE TREES IN BLOSSOM]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO A FINCA IN THE HIGHLANDS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE CULTURE IN GUATEMALA]\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that now about 166,000 acres are under coffee, nearly\r\nall the land in the country suitable for that purpose. As in most other\r\ncoffee-raising countries, the trees begin bearing when they are two or\r\nthree years old, reach full maturity at the age of seven or eight years,\r\nand continue to bear for about thirty years. Intensive cultivation and a\r\nmore extensive use of fertilizers have been urged as necessary in order\r\nto increase the crop; but, so far, with not much effect, the importation\r\nof fertilizer being still very small. Crop gathering begins in the\r\nlowlands in November, and gradually proceeds into the higher regions,\r\nmonth by month, until the picking in the highest altitudes is finished\r\nin the following March.\r\n\r\nGUATEMALA. Guatemala began intensive coffee growing about 1875. Coffee\r\nhad been known in the country in a small way from about 1850, but now\r\nserious attention began to be given to its cultivation, and it quickly\r\nadvanced to an industrial position of importance. Within a generation it\r\nbecame the great staple crop of the country.\r\n\r\nGuatemala has an area of 48,250 square miles, about the size of the\r\nstate of Ohio. Its population is about 2,000,000. Three mountain ranges,\r\nintersecting magnificent table lands, traverse the country from north to\r\nsouth; and there is the great coffee territory. The table lands are from\r\n2,500 to 5,000 feet above sea-level, and have a temperate climate most\r\nagreeable to the coffee tree. On the lower heights it is necessary to\r\nprotect the young trees from the extreme heat of the sun; and the banana\r\nis most approved for this purpose, since it raises its own crop at the\r\nsame time that it is giving shade to its companion tree. On the higher\r\nlevels the plantations need protection from the cold north winds that\r\nblow strongly across the country, especially in December, January, and\r\nFebruary. The range of hills to the north is the best protection, and\r\ngenerally is all sufficient. When the weather becomes too severe, heaps\r\nof rubbish mixed with pitch are thrown up to the north of the fields of\r\ncoffee trees and set afire, the resultant dense smoke driving down\r\nbetween rows of trees and saving them from the frost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIANS PICKING COFFEE, GUATEMALA]\r\n\r\nNamed in the order of their productivity, the coffee districts are Costa\r\nCuca, Costa Grande, Barberena, Tumbador, Cobán, Costa de Cucho,\r\nChicacao, Xolhuitz, Pochuta, Malacatan, San Marcos, Chuva, Panan, Turgo,\r\nEscuintla, San Vincente, Pacaya, Antigua, Moran, Amatitlan, Sumatan,\r\nPalmar, Zunil, and Motagua.\r\n\r\nEstimates of coffee acreage vary. One authority, too conservatively,\r\nperhaps, puts the figure at 145,000. Another estimate is 260,000 acres.\r\nUnder cultivation are from 70,000,000 to 100,000,000 trees from which an\r\nannual crop averaging about 75,000,000 pounds is raised, and the\r\nexceptional amounts of nearly 90,000,000 and 97,000,000 pounds have been\r\nharvested. Several plantations of size can be counted upon for an annual\r\nproduction of more than 1,000,000 pounds each.\r\n\r\nBefore the World War German interests dominated the coffee industry,\r\nhandling fully eighty percent of the crop, and growing nearly half of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nPlanting and cultivation methods in Guatemala are about the same as\r\nthose prevailing in other countries. The trees are usually in flower in\r\nFebruary, March, and April, and the harvesting season extends from\r\nAugust to January. All work on the plantation is done by Indian laborers\r\nunder a peonage system, families working in companies: wages are small,\r\nbut sufficient, conditions of living being easy. As elsewhere in these\r\ntropical and sub-tropical countries, scarcity of labor is severely\r\nfelt, and is a grave obstacle to the development of the industry in a\r\nland that is regarded as particularly well adapted to it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COFFEE PLANTER'S LIFE IN GUATEMALA IS ONE OF\r\nPLEASANTNESS AND PEACE]\r\n\r\nHAITI. Haiti, the magic isle of the Indies, has grown coffee almost from\r\nthe beginning of the introduction of the tree into the western\r\nhemisphere. Its cultivation was started there about 1715, but the trees\r\nwere largely permitted to fall into a wild natural state, and little\r\nattention was given to them or to the handling of the crop. Fertility of\r\nsoil, climate, and moisture are favorable, and the advancement of the\r\nindustry has been retarded only by the political conditions of the negro\r\nrepublic and a general lack of industry and enterprise on the part of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nHaiti is an island with three names. Haiti is used to describe the\r\nisland as a whole, and to denote the Republic of Haiti, which occupies\r\nthe western third of its area. The island is also known as Santo\r\nDomingo, and San Domingo, names likewise applied to the Dominican\r\nRepublic which occupies the eastern two-thirds of the land unit.\r\n\r\nPlantations now existing in Haiti have had, with rare exceptions, a life\r\nof more than ten or twenty years. It is estimated that they cover about\r\n125,000 acres, with about 400 trees to the acre.\r\n\r\nWhen the French acquired the island in 1789, the annual production was\r\n88,360,502 pounds. During the following century that amount was not\r\napproached in any year, the nearest to it being 72,637,716 pounds in\r\n1875. The lowest annual production was 20,280,589 pounds in 1818. The\r\nrange during the hundred years, 1789-1890, was, with the exceptions\r\nnoted, from 45,000,000 to 71,000,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nMEXICO. Opinions differ as to the exact date when coffee was introduced\r\ninto Mexico. It is said to have been transplanted there from the West\r\nIndies near the end of the eighteenth century. A story is current that a\r\nSpaniard set out a few trees, on trial, in southern Mexico, in 1800, and\r\nthat his experiments started other Mexican planters along the same line.\r\nCoffee was grown in the state of Vera Cruz early in the nineteenth\r\ncentury; and the books of the Vera Cruz custom house record that 1,101\r\nquintals of coffee were exported through that port during the years\r\n1802, 1803, and 1805.\r\n\r\nIn the Coatepec district, which eventually became famous in the annals\r\nof Mexican coffee growing, trees were planted about the year 1808. Local\r\nhistory says that seeds were brought from Cuba by Arias, a partner of\r\nthe house of Pedro Lopez, owners of the large _hacienda_ of Orduna in\r\nCoatepec. The seeds were given to a priest, Andres Dominguez, who sowed\r\nthem near Teocelo. When he had succeeded in starting seedlings, he gave\r\nthem away to other planters there-about. The plants thrived, and this\r\nwas the beginning of coffee cultivation in that section of the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THIRTY-YEAR-OLD COFFEE TREES, LA ESPERANZA, HUATUSCO,\r\nMEXICO]\r\n\r\nIt was, however, nearly ten years later before the cultivation was on a\r\nscale approaching industrial and commercial importance. About 1816 or\r\n1818 a Spaniard, named Juan Antonio Gomez, introduced the plant into the\r\nneighborhood of Cordoba. This city, now on the line of the Mexican and\r\nVera Cruz Railroad, 200 miles from Mexico City, and sixty miles from\r\nVera Cruz, is 2,500 feet above sea-level, and is situated in the most\r\nproductive tropical region of the country.\r\n\r\nHaving been started in Coatepec and Cordoba, the industry was centered\r\nfor a long time in the state of Vera Cruz. For many years practically\r\nall the coffee grown commercially in Mexico was produced in that state.\r\nGradually the new pursuit spread to the mountains in the adjacent states\r\nof Oaxaca and Puebla, where it was taken up by the Indians almost\r\nentirely, and is still followed by them, but not on a large scale.\r\n\r\nAlthough cultivation is now widely distributed in most of the more\r\nsouthern states of the republic, the principal coffee territory is still\r\nin Vera Cruz, where lie the districts of Cordoba, Orizaba, Huatusco, and\r\nCoatepec. In the same region are the Jalapa district, and the mountains\r\nof Puebla, where a great deal of coffee is grown. Farther south are the\r\nOaxaca districts on the mountain slopes of the Pacific coast, and still\r\nfarther south the districts of the state of Chiapas. Planting in the\r\nPluma district in Oaxaca was begun about fifty years ago, and it now\r\nproduces annually, in good years, nearly 1,000,000 pounds. The youngest\r\ndistrict in this section is Soconusco, one of the most prolific in the\r\nrepublic, having been developed within the last thirty years. The region\r\nis near the border of Guatemala, and the coffee is held by many to\r\npossess some of the quality of the coffee of that country. The influence\r\nof Guatemalan methods has been felt also in its cultivation and\r\nhandling, especially in increasing plantation productiveness. On the\r\ngulf slope of Oaxaca, there are plantations that annually produce\r\n222,000 to 550,000 pounds. Several United States companies have become\r\ninterested in coffee growing in this state, and their output in recent\r\nyears has been put upon the market in St. Louis.\r\n\r\nTwo principal varieties of coffee are recognized in Mexico. A\r\nsub-variety of _Coffea arabica_ is mostly cultivated. This is an\r\nevergreen, growing only from five to seven feet. It flourishes well at\r\ndifferent altitudes and in different climes, from the temperate plains\r\nof Puebla to the hot, damp, lower lands of Vera Cruz and Oaxaca, and\r\nother Pacific-coast regions. The range of elevation for it is from 1,500\r\nto 5,000 feet, and it is satisfied with a temperature as low as 55° or\r\nas high as 80°, with plenty of natural humidity or with irrigation in\r\nthe dry season. The other variety is called the \"myrtle\" and is widely\r\ngrown, although not in large quantities. It is distinguished from\r\n_arabica_ by the larger leaf of the tree and by the smaller corolla of\r\nthe flower. It is a hardier plant than the _arabica_ and will stand the\r\nhigher temperature of low altitudes, thriving at an elevation of from\r\n500 to 3,000 feet above sea-level. Mostly it is cultivated in the\r\nCordoba district.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed by many that the Mexican coffee of best quality is grown\r\nin the western regions of the table lands of Colima and Michoacan, but\r\nonly a small quantity of that is available for export. The state of\r\nMichoacan is especially favored by climate, altitude, soil, and\r\nsurroundings to produce coffee of exceptionally high grade, and the\r\nUruapan is considered to be its best.\r\n\r\nTrees flower in January and March, and in high altitudes as late as June\r\nor July. Berries appear in July and are ripe for gathering in October or\r\nNovember, the picking season lasting until February.\r\n\r\nTrees begin to yield when two or three years old, producing from two to\r\nfour ounces. They reach full production, which is about one and a half\r\npounds, at the age of six or seven years, though in the districts of\r\nChiapas, Michoacan, Oaxaca, and Puebla, annual yields of three to five\r\npounds per tree have been reported.\r\n\r\nSince the World War American buyers have shown greater interest in the\r\nTapachula coffee grown in Chiapas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEXICAN COFFEE PICKER, COATEPEC DISTRICT]\r\n\r\nPORTO RICO. Coffee culture in Porto Rico dates from 1755 or even\r\nearlier, having been introduced from the neighboring islands of\r\nMartinique and Haiti. Count O'Reilly, writing of the island in the\r\neighteenth century, mentions that the coffee exports for five years\r\nprevious to 1765 amounted in value to $2,078. Old records show that in\r\n1770 there was a crop of 700,000 pounds and that seems to be the first\r\nevidence that the new industry was growing to any noticeable\r\nproportions. For a hundred years, at least, only slow progress was made.\r\nIn 1768 the king, of Spain issued a royal decree exempting coffee\r\ngrowers on the island from the payment of taxes or charges for a period\r\nof five years; but even that measure was not materially successful in\r\nstimulating interest and in developing cultivation.\r\n\r\nPorto Rico is a good coffee-growing country; soil, climate, and\r\ntemperature are well adapted to the berry. The coffee belt extends\r\nthrough the western half of the island, beginning in the hills along the\r\nsouth coast around Ponce, and extending north through the center of the\r\nisland almost to Arecibo, near the west end of the north coast. But some\r\ncoffee is grown in the other parts of the island, in sixty-four of the\r\nsixty-eight municipalities. Mountain sections are considered to be\r\nsuperior.\r\n\r\nThe largest plantations are in the region which includes the\r\nmunicipalities of Utuado, Adjuntas, Lares, Las Marias, Yauco, Maricao,\r\nSan Sebastian, Mayaguez, Ciales, and Ponce. With the exception of Ponce\r\nand Mayaguez, all these districts are back from the coast; but insular\r\nroads of recent construction make them now easily accessible, and there\r\nis no point on the island more than twenty miles distant from the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RECEIVING AND MEASURING THE RIPE BERRIES FROM THE\r\nPICKERS, MEXICO]\r\n\r\nFrom the Sierra Luquillo range, which rises to a height of 1,500 feet,\r\nand from Yauco, Utuado, and Lares, come excellent coffees; and, on the\r\nwhole, these are considered to be the best coffee regions of the island.\r\nA fine grade of coffee is also grown in the Ciales district. Figures\r\ncompiled by the Treasury Department of the insular government for the\r\npurpose of taxation showed that for the tax year 1915-16 there were\r\n167,137 acres of land planted to coffee and valued at $10,341,592, an\r\naverage of $61.87 per acre. In 1910, there were 151,000 acres planted in\r\ncoffee. In 1916 there were more than 5,000 separate coffee plantations.\r\n\r\nOriginally the coffee trees of Porto Rico were all of the _arabica_\r\nvariety. In recent years numerous others have been introduced, until in\r\n1917 there were more than 2,500 trees of new descriptions on the island.\r\n\r\nThe virgin land in the interior of the island is admirably adapted to\r\nthe coffee tree, and less labor is required to prepare it for plantation\r\npurposes than in many other coffee-growing countries. It is cleared in\r\nthe usual manner, and the trees are planted about eight feet apart, an\r\naverage of 680 trees to the acre. The seeds are planted in February; and\r\nif the seedlings are transplanted, that is done when they are a year or\r\na year and a half old. The guama, a big strong tree of dense foliage, is\r\nused for a wind-break on the ridges; and the guava, for shade in the\r\nplantation. Plow cultivation is generally impossible on account of the\r\nlay of the land, and only hoeing and spade work are done. Pruning is\r\ncarefully attended to as the trees become full grown.\r\n\r\nFlowering is generally in February and March, or even later. Heavy rains\r\nin April make a poor crop. Harvesting begins in September and extends\r\ninto January, during which time ten pickings are made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SINGLE PORTO RICO COFFEE TREE IN FULL BEARING, PROPPED\r\nUP WITH STAKES]\r\n\r\nThe average yield per acre is between 200 and 300 pounds; but expert\r\nauthority--Prof. O.F. Cook--in a statement made to the Committee on\r\nInsular Affairs of the United States House of Representatives, in 1900,\r\nheld that under better cultural methods the yield could be increased to\r\n800 or 900 pounds per acre. One estimator has calculated that an average\r\nplantation of 100 acres had cost its owner at the end of six or seven\r\nyears, the bearing age, about $13,100 with yields of 75 pounds per acre\r\nin the third and in the fourth years, 400 pounds per acre in the fifth\r\nyear, and 500 pounds in the sixth year, the income from which would\r\npractically have met the cost to that time. It is held by the same\r\nauthority that an intensively cultivated, well-situated farm of selected\r\ntrees, 880 to the acre, should yield some 880 pounds of cleaned coffee\r\nto the acre.\r\n\r\nCOSTA RICA. Costa Rica ranks next to Guatemala and Salvador among the\r\nCentral American countries as a producer of coffee, showing an average\r\nannual yield in recent years of 35,000,000 pounds as compared with\r\nGuatemala's 80,000,000 and Salvador's 75,000,000 pounds. Nicaragua has\r\nan average annual production of 30,000,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nCoffee was introduced into Costa Rica in the latter part of the\r\neighteenth century; one authority saying that the plants were brought\r\nfrom Cuba in 1779 by a Spanish voyager, Navarro, and another saying that\r\nthe first trees were planted several years later by Padre Carazo, a\r\nSpanish missionary coming from Jamaica. For more than a century six big\r\ncoffee trees standing in a courtyard in the city of Cartago were pointed\r\nout to visitors as the very trees that Carazo had planted.\r\n\r\nThe coffee-producing districts are principally on the Pacific slope and\r\nin the central plateaus of the interior. Plantations are located in the\r\nprovinces of Cartago, Tres Rios, San José, Heredia, and Alajuela. In the\r\nprovince of Cartago are several extensive new estates on the slope to\r\nthe Atlantic coast. The San José and the Cartago districts are\r\nconsidered by many to be the best naturally for the coffee tree. The\r\nsoil is an exceedingly rich black loam made up of continuous layers of\r\nvolcanic ashes and dust from three to fifteen feet deep. Preferable\r\naltitudes for plantations range from 3,000 to 4,500 feet, although a\r\nheight of 5,000 feet is not out of use and there are some estates that\r\ndo fairly well on levels as low as 1,500 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MODERN IDEA IN COFFEE CULTIVATION, COSTA RICA]\r\n\r\nINDIA. Tradition has it that a Moslem pilgrim in the seventeenth century\r\nbrought from Mecca to India the first coffee seeds known in that\r\ncountry. They were planted near a temple on a hill in Mysore called Baba\r\nBudan, after the pilgrim; and from there the cultivation of coffee\r\ngradually spread to neighboring districts. Aside from this legend,\r\nnothing further is heard about coffee in India until the early part of\r\nthe nineteenth century, when its existence there was confirmed by the\r\ngranting of a charter to Fort Gloster, near Calcutta, authorizing that\r\nplace to become a coffee plantation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PICKING COSTA RICA COFFEE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE ESTATE IN THE MOUNTAINS OF COSTA RICA]\r\n\r\nPlanting was begun on the flat land of the plains, but the trees did not\r\nthrive. Then the cultivation was extended to the hills in southern\r\nIndia, especially in Mysore, where better success was achieved. The\r\nfirst systematic plantation was established in 1840. For the most part,\r\nthe production has always been confined to southern India in the\r\nelevated region near the southwestern coast. The coffee district\r\ncomprises the landward slopes of the Western Ghats, from Kanara to\r\nTravancore.\r\n\r\nAbout one-half of the coffee-producing area is in Mysore; and other\r\nplantations are in Kurg (Coorg), the Madras districts of Malabar, and in\r\nthe Nilgiri hills, those regions having 86 percent of the whole area\r\nunder cultivation. Some coffee is grown also in other districts in\r\nMadras, principally in Madura, Salem, and Coimbator, in Cochin, in\r\nTravancore, and, on a restricted scale, in Burma, Assam, and Bombay. The\r\narea returned as under coffee in 1885 was 237,448 acres; in 1896, as\r\n303,944 acres. Since then there has been a progressive decrease on\r\naccount of damage from leaf diseases difficult to combat, and by\r\ncompetition with Brazilian coffee.\r\n\r\nNew land that had just been planted with coffee in plantations reported\r\nfor 1919-20 amounted to 7,012 acres; while the area abandoned was 8,725\r\nacres, representing a net decrease in cultivated area of 1,713 acres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF A COFFEE ESTATE IN MYSORE, INDIA]\r\n\r\nOf the total area devoted to coffee cultivation (126,919 acres), 49\r\npercent was in Mysore, which yielded 35 percent of the total production;\r\nwhile Madras, with 23 percent of the total area, yielded 38 percent of\r\nthe production. The total production for the year 1920-21 is reported as\r\n26,902,471 pounds.\r\n\r\nYield varies throughout the country according to the methods of\r\ncultivation and the condition of the season. On the best estates in a\r\ngood season, the yield per acre may be as high as 1,100 or 1,200 pounds,\r\nand on poor estates it may not be over 200 or 300 pounds. The _arabica_\r\nvariety is chiefly cultivated. The _robusta_ and _Maragogipe_ have been\r\ntried, but without much success.\r\n\r\nA representative plantation is the Santaverre in Mysore, comprising 400\r\nacres, at an elevation of from 4,000 to 4,500 feet, where the coffee\r\ntrees, cultivated under shade, produce from 100 to 250 tons of coffee a\r\nyear. Other prominent estates in Mysore are Cannon's Baloor and\r\nMylemoney, the Hoskahn, and the Sumpigay Khan.\r\n\r\nNICARAGUA. Coffee trees will grow well anywhere in Nicaragua, but the\r\nbest locations have altitudes of from 2,000 to 3,000 feet above sea\r\nlevel. At such elevations the yield varies from one pound to five pounds\r\nper tree annually; but above or below those, the average production\r\ndiminishes to from one pound to one-half pound a tree.\r\n\r\nLands most suitable for the berry are on the Sierra de Managua, in\r\nDiriambe, San Marcos, and Jinotega, and about the base of the volcano\r\nMonbacho near Granada. Good land is also found on the island Omotepe in\r\nLake Nicaragua, and around Boaco in the department of Chontales, where\r\ncultivation was begun in 1893.\r\n\r\nThere are also plantations in the vicinity of Esteli and Lomati in the\r\ndepartment of Neuva Segovia. The most extensive operations are in the\r\ndepartments of Managua, Carazo, Matagalpa, Chontales, and Jinotega, and\r\nfrom those regions the annual crop has attained to such quantity that it\r\nhas become the chief agricultural product of the republic. Poor and\r\ncostly means of transportation on the Atlantic slope have operated to\r\nretard the development of the industry there, even though conditions of\r\nclimate are not unfavorable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE GROWING UNDER SHADE, UBBAN ESTATE, INDIA]\r\n\r\nABYSSINIA. In the absence of any conclusive evidence to the contrary,\r\nthe claim that coffee was first made known to modern man by the trees on\r\nthe mountains of the northeastern part of the continent of Africa may be\r\naccepted without reserve. Undoubtedly the plant grew wild all through\r\ntropical Africa; but its value as an addition to man's dietary was\r\nbrought forth in Abyssinia.\r\n\r\nAbyssinia, while it may have given coffee to the world, no longer\r\nfigures as a prime factor in supplying the world, and now exports only a\r\nlimited quantity. There are produced in the country two coffees known to\r\nthe trade as Harari and Abyssinian, the former being by far the more\r\nimportant. The Harari is the fruit of cultivated _arabica_ trees grown\r\nin the province of Harar, and mostly in the neighborhood of the city of\r\nHarar, capital of the province. The Abyssianian is the fruit of wild\r\n_arabica_ trees that grow mainly in the provinces of Sidamo, Kaffa, and\r\nGuma.\r\n\r\nThe coffee of Harar is known to the trade as Mocha longberry or\r\nAbyssinian longberry. Most of the plantations upon which it is raised\r\nare owned by the native Hararis, Galla, and Abyssinians, although there\r\nare a few Greek, German, and French planters. The trees are planted in\r\nrows about twelve or fifteen feet apart, and comparatively little\r\nattention is given to cultivation. Crops average two a year, and\r\nsometimes even five in two years. The big yield is in December, January,\r\nand February. The average crop is about seventy pounds, and is mostly\r\nfrom small plots of from fifty to one hundred trees, there being no very\r\nlarge plantations. All the coffee is brought into the city of Harar,\r\nwhence it is sent on mule-back to Dire-Daoua on the Franco-Ethiopian\r\nRailway, and from there by rail to Jibuti. Some of it is exported\r\ndirectly from Jibuti, and the rest is forwarded to Aden, in Arabia, for\r\nre-exporting.\r\n\r\nAbyssinian, or wild, coffee is also known as Kaffa coffee, from one of\r\nthe districts where it grows most abundantly in a state of nature. This\r\ncoffee has a smaller bean and is less rich in aroma and flavor than the\r\nHarari; but the trees grow in such profusion that the possible supply,\r\nat the minimum of labor in gathering, is practically unlimited. It is\r\nsaid that in southwestern Abyssinia there are immense forests of it\r\nthat have never been encroached upon except at the outskirts, where the\r\nnatives lazily pick up the beans that have fallen to the ground. It is\r\nshelled where it is found, in the most primitive fashion, and goes out\r\nin a dirty, mixed condition.\r\n\r\nFormerly, much of this Kaffa coffee was sent to market through Boromeda,\r\nHarar, and Dire-Daoua. An average annual crop was about 6,000 bags, or\r\n800,000 pounds, of which something more than one-half usually went\r\nthrough Harar. A customs and trading station has lately been established\r\nat Gambela, on the Sobat River: and with the development of this outlet,\r\nthere has been a substantial and increasing exploitation of the\r\nwild-coffee plants since 1913. Large areas of land have been cleared,\r\nwith a view to cultivation, and attention is being given to improved\r\nmethods of harvesting and of preparing the coffee for the market. At one\r\ntime a fair amount of coffee from this region went to Adis Abeba on the\r\nbacks of pack mules, a journey of thirty-five or forty days, and then\r\nwas carried to Jibuti, nearly 500 miles, part of the way by rail. Now\r\npractically all of it goes to Gambela, thence by steamers to Khartoum,\r\nand by rail to the shipping-point at Port Sudan on the Red Sea.\r\n\r\nOTHER AFRICAN COUNTRIES. Practically every part of Africa seems to be\r\nsuitable for coffee cultivation, even United South Africa, in the\r\nsouthern part of the continent, producing 140,212 pounds in 1918. To\r\nname all the countries in which it is grown would be to list nearly all\r\nthe political divisions of Africa. Among the largest producers are the\r\nBritish East African Protectorate, 18,735,572 pounds in 1918; French\r\nSomaliland, 11,222,736 pounds in 1917; Angola, 10,655,934 pounds in\r\n1913; Uganda, 9,999,845 pounds in 1918; former German East Africa,\r\n2,334,450 pounds in 1913; Cape Verde Islands, 1,442,910 pounds in 1916;\r\nMadagascar, 707,676 pounds in 1918; Liberia, 761,300 pounds in 1917;\r\nEritrea, 728,840 pounds in 1918; St. Thomas and Prince's Islands,\r\n484,350 pounds in 1916; and the Belgian Congo, 375,000 pounds in 1917.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GALLA COFFEE GROWER, AND HIS HELPER, IN HIS GROVE OF\r\nYOUNG TREES NEAR HARAR]\r\n\r\nANGOLA. Coffee is Angola's second product, and there are large areas of\r\nwild-coffee trees. With a production of nearly 11,000,000 pounds, Angola\r\nranks about third in Africa as a coffee-growing country. The coffee is\r\ngathered and sold by the natives, and there are also several European\r\ncompanies engaged in the coffee business. The chief coffee belt extends\r\nfrom the Quanza River northward to the Kongo at an altitude of 1,500 to\r\n2,500 feet. In the Cazengo valley the wild trees are so thick that\r\nthinning out is the only operation necessary to the plantation-owner.\r\nWhen the trees become too tall, they are simply cut off about two feet\r\nabove ground; and new shoots appear from the trunks the following\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThe largest coffee plantation, owned by the Companhia Agricola de\r\nCazengo, produced in 1913, a record year, nearly 1,500 tons.\r\n\r\nLIBERIA. Coffee is native to Liberia, growing wild in the hinterland of\r\nthe negro republic, and in the natural state the trees often attain a\r\nheight of from thirty to forty feet. Cultivated Liberian coffee, _Coffea\r\nliberica_, has become a staple of the civilized inhabitants of the\r\ncountry, and is grown successfully in hot, moist lowlands or on hills\r\nthat are not much elevated. On account of the size of the trees, only\r\nabout four hundred can be planted to the acre. In recent years the\r\nnative Africans have been planting thousands of trees in the district of\r\nGrand Cape Mount. Coffee is grown in all parts of the republic, but\r\nchiefly in Grand Cape Mount and Montserrado.\r\n\r\nGENERAL OUTLOOK IN AFRICA. In the African countries under control of\r\nEuropean governments much recent progress has been made in promoting\r\ncoffee growing and in improving methods of cultivation.\r\n\r\nBritish interests were reported in 1919 as having started a movement\r\ntoward reviving interest in the coffee growing industry in the British\r\npossessions in Africa. The report stated that Uganda, in the East\r\nAfrican Protectorate, had 21,000 acres under coffee cultivation, with\r\n16,000 acres more in other parts of the Protectorate, and 1,300 acres in\r\nNyasaland; also that there is no hope of an immediate revival of the\r\nindustry in Natal, where it was killed twenty years ago by various\r\npests; \"but it should certainly be established in the warmer parts of\r\nRhodesia; and in the northern part of the Transvaal an effort is being\r\nmade to bring this form of enterprise into practical existence.\"\r\n\r\nCoffee growing possibilities in British East Africa (Kenya Colony) are\r\nalluring, according to reports from planters in that region. Late in\r\n1920, Major C.J. Ross, a British government officer there, said that\r\n\"British East Africa is going to be one of the leading coffee countries\r\nof the world.\" Coffee grows wild in many parts of the Protectorate, but\r\nthe natives are too lazy to pick even the wild berries.\r\n\r\nOn the more advanced plantations in all parts of Africa the approved\r\ncultivation methods of other leading countries are carefully followed;\r\nespecial care being given to weeding and pruning, because of the rank\r\ngrowth of the tropics. On the whole, however, little attention is given\r\nto intensive methods.\r\n\r\nARABIA. Whether the coffee tree was first discovered indigenous in the\r\nmountains of Abyssinia, or in the Yemen district of Arabia, will\r\nprobably always be a matter of contention. Many writers of Europe and\r\nAsia in the fifteenth century, when coffee was first brought to the\r\nattention of the people of Europe, agree on Arabia; but there is good\r\nreason to believe the plant was brought to Arabia from Abyssinia in the\r\nsixth century.\r\n\r\nOnce all the coffee of Arabia went to the outside world through the port\r\nof Mocha on the eastern coast of the Red Sea. Mocha, which never raised\r\nany coffee, is no longer of commercial importance; but its name has been\r\npermanently attached to the coffee of this country.\r\n\r\n_Mocha_ (_Moka_, or _Morkha_) coffee (i.e. _Coffea arabica_) is raised\r\nprincipally in the vilayet of Yemen, a district of southeastern Arabia.\r\nYemen extends from the north, southerly along the line of the Red Sea,\r\nnearly to the Gulf of Aden. With the exception of a narrow strip of land\r\nalong the shores of the Red Sea, the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, and the\r\nGulf of Aden, it is a rugged, mountainous region, in which innumerable\r\nsmall valleys at high elevations are irrigated by waters from the\r\nmelting snows of the mountains.\r\n\r\nCoffee can be successfully grown in any part of Yemen, but its\r\ncultivation is confined to a few widely scattered districts, and the\r\nacreage is not large. The principal coffee regions are in the mountains\r\nbetween Taiz and Ibb, and between Ibb and Yerim, and Yerim and Sanaa, on\r\nthe caravan route from Taiz to Sanaa; between Zabeed and Ibb, on the\r\nroute from Taiz to Zabeed; between Hajelah and Menakha, on the route\r\nfrom Hodeida to Sanaa, and in the wild mountain ranges both to the north\r\nand south of that route; between Beit-el-Fakih and Obal; and between\r\nManakha and Batham to the north of Bajil. The plant does best at\r\nelevations ranging from 3,500 to 6,500 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILD KAFFA COFFEE TREES NEAR ADIS ABEBA]\r\n\r\nIn the Yemen district, coffee is generally grown in small gardens. Large\r\nplantations, as they exist in other coffee-growing countries, are not\r\nseen in Arabia. Many of these small farms may be parts of a large estate\r\nbelonging to some rich tribal chief. The native Arabs do not use coffee\r\nin the way it is used elsewhere in the world. They drink _kisher_, a\r\nbeverage brewed from the husks of the berry and not from the bean.\r\nConsequently, the entire crop goes into export. But bad conditions of\r\ntrade routes, political disturbances, and small regional wars, absence\r\nof good cultivation methods, and heavy transit taxes imposed by the\r\ngovernment, have combined to restrict the production of Yemen coffee.\r\n\r\nLand for the coffee gardens is selected on hill-slopes, and is terraced\r\nwith soil and small walls of stone until it reaches up like an\r\namphitheater--often to a considerable height. The soil is well\r\nfertilized. For sowing, the seeds are thoroughly dried in ashes, and\r\nafter being placed in the ground, are carefully watched, watered, and\r\nshaded. In about a year the shrub has grown to a height of twelve or\r\nmore inches. Seedlings in that condition are set out in the gardens in\r\nrows, about ten to thirteen feet apart. The young trees receive moisture\r\nfrom neighboring wells or from irrigation ditches, and are shaded by\r\nbananas.\r\n\r\nAt maturity the trees reach a height of ten or fifteen feet. Since they\r\nnever lose all their leaves at one time, they appear always green, and\r\nbear at the same time flowers and fruits, some of which are still green\r\nwhile others are ripe or approaching maturity. Thus, in some districts,\r\nthe trees are considered to have two or even three crops a year. All the\r\ntrees begin to bear about the end of the third year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A RARE PICTURE SHOWING MOCHA COFFEE GROWING ON TERRACES\r\nIN YEMEN, ARABIA]\r\n\r\nCUBA. Coffee can be grown in practically every island of the West\r\nIndies, but owing to the state of civilization in many of the lesser\r\nislands, little is produced for international trade, excepting in\r\nJamaica, Guadeloupe, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Trinidad, and\r\nTobago. In past years a considerable quantity of good-quality coffee was\r\nproduced in Cuba, the annual export in the decade of 1840 averaging\r\n50,000,000 pounds. Severe hurricanes, adverse legislation, the rise of\r\ncoffee-growing in Brazil, the increase in cultivation of sugar and other\r\nmore profitable crops, practically eliminated Cuba from the\r\ninternational coffee-export trade.\r\n\r\nMARTINIQUE. This is a name well known to coffee men, the world over, as\r\nthe pioneer coffee-growing country of the western hemisphere. Gabriel de\r\nClieu introduced the coffee plant to the island in 1723 by bringing it\r\nthrough many hardships from France. For a time, coffee flourished there,\r\nbut now practically none is grown. Such coffee as bears the name\r\nMartinique in modern trade centers is produced in Guadeloupe, and is\r\nonly shipped through Martinique.\r\n\r\nJAMAICA. Coffee was introduced into Jamaica in 1730; and so highly was\r\nit regarded as a desirable addition to the agricultural resources of the\r\nisland, that the British Parliament in 1732 passed a special act\r\nproviding for the encouraging and fostering of its cultivation. Later,\r\nit became one of the great staples of the country. Disastrous floods in\r\n1815, and the gradual exhaustion of the best lands since then, have\r\nbrought about a decline of the industry, which is now confined to a few\r\nestates in the Blue Mountains and to scattered \"settler\" or peasant\r\ncultivation in the same districts but at lower altitudes.\r\n\r\nThe tree was formerly grown at all altitudes, from sea-level to 5,000\r\nfeet; but the best height for it is about 4,500 feet. Four parishes lead\r\nin coffee producing: Manchester, with an area of 5,045 acres; St.\r\nThomas, with 2,315 acres; Clarendon, with 2,172 acres; St. Andrew, with\r\n1,584 acres. Nine other parishes that raise coffee have less than 1,000\r\nacres each under cultivation. There were 24,865 acres devoted to coffee\r\nin 1900. In addition, it was estimated that there were 80,000 acres\r\nsuitable for the cultivation, nearly all being owned by the government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PICKING BLUE MOUNTAIN BERRIES, JAMAICA]\r\n\r\nDOMINICAN REPUBLIC. Coffee was once the leading staple in the Dominican\r\nRepublic as in the adjoining Haitian Republic; but in recent years\r\ncacao, sugar, and tobacco have become the predominating crops. Said to\r\nhave the world's richest and most productive soil, one-half of the\r\nrepublic's area is particularly suited to the cultivation of a good\r\ngrade of coffee of the highland type. But political and industrial\r\nconditions have made for neglect of its cultivation by efficient\r\nmethods. Lack of suitable roads has also militated against the\r\ndevelopment of the coffee industry.\r\n\r\nIn spite of many drawbacks, it is to be noted that, from the beginning\r\nof the twentieth century, the coffee-growing area has been gradually\r\nexpanded until exports increased from less than 1,000,000 pounds to\r\n5,029,316 pounds in 1918, although in the next two years there was a\r\nrecession in the total exports to 1,358,825 pounds in 1920.\r\n\r\nThe principal plantations are in the vicinity of the town of Moca and in\r\nthe districts of Santiago, Bani, and Barahona. Generally speaking, the\r\nmethods of cultivation in the Dominican Republic are somewhat crude as\r\ncompared with the practise in the larger countries of production in\r\nCentral America and South America.\r\n\r\nGUADELOUPE. Guadeloupe has an area of 619 square miles, and about\r\none-third of this area is under cultivation. About 15,000 acres are in\r\ncoffee, giving employment to upward of 10,000 persons. The average yield\r\nof a plantation of mature trees is about 535 pounds to the acre.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of the industry in Guadeloupe, production and export\r\nwere considerable. From old records it appears that in 1784 the exports\r\namounted to 7,500,000 pounds. During the closing years of the eighteenth\r\ncentury the annual exports were from 6,500,000 to 8,500,000 pounds, and\r\nin the beginning of the next century they registered about 6,000,000\r\npounds. Toward the middle of the nineteenth century the growing of sugar\r\ncane overtopped that of coffee in profit, and many planters abandoned\r\ncoffee. After 1884, with the decadence of the sugar industry, coffee was\r\nagain favored, the government giving substantial encouragement by paying\r\nbounties ranging from $15 to $19 per acre for all new coffee\r\nplantations.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, considerable _liberica_ and _robusta_ have been planted\r\nin place of the exhausted _arabica_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE PICKERS RETURNING FROM THE FIELDS, GUADELOUPE]\r\n\r\nTRINIDAD AND TOBAGO. The islands of Trinidad and Tobago are small\r\nfactors in international coffee trading. Coffee can be grown almost any\r\nplace on the islands; but its cultivation is confined principally to the\r\ndistricts of Maracas, Aripo, and North Oropouche. Both the _arabica_ and\r\nthe _liberica_ varieties are grown.\r\n\r\nHONDURAS. Soil, surface, and climate in Honduras, as far as they relate\r\nto the cultivation of coffee, are similar to those of the adjoining\r\nregions of Central America. The tree grows in the uplands of the\r\ninterior, thriving best at an altitude of from 1,500 to 4,000 feet.\r\nScarcity of labor and insufficient means of transportation have been the\r\nchief obstacles in the way of the large development of the industry.\r\n\r\nThe departments of Santa Barbara, Copan, Cortez, La Paz, Choluteca, and\r\nEl Paraiso have the principal plantations. The ports of shipment are\r\nTruxillo and Puerto Cortés. Annual production in recent years has been\r\nabout 5,000,000 pounds. In 1889 the United States imported 3,322,502\r\npounds, but in 1915 its importations fell away to 665,912 pounds.\r\n\r\nBRITISH HONDURAS. British Honduras has never undertaken to raise coffee\r\non a commercial scale despite the fact that conditions are not\r\nunfavorable to its cultivation. It has failed to produce enough even for\r\ndomestic consumption, importing most of what it has needed. Annual\r\nproduction, as recorded in recent years, has been upward of 10,000\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE-YEAR-OLD COFFEE TREES IN BLOSSOM, PANAMA]\r\n\r\nPANAMA. Panama presents a very favorable field for the growing of\r\ncoffee. The best district is situated in the uplands of the district of\r\nBugaba, where vast areas of the best lands for coffee-growing exist, and\r\nwhere climatic and other conditions are most favorable to its growth.\r\n\r\nNo shade is required in this country; and the only cultivation consists\r\nof three or four cleanings a year to keep down the weeds, as no plowing,\r\netc., are necessary. Coffee matures from October to January. Water power\r\nbeing abundant, it is used for running all machinery.\r\n\r\nThe annual output of the province of Chiriqui, which produces the bulk\r\nof the coffee, is approximately 4,000 sacks of 100 pounds each; all of\r\nwhich is produced in the Boquete district at present, as the coffee\r\nplanted in the Bugaba section is still young and unproductive. The local\r\nsupply does not meet the domestic demand; and instead of exporting, a\r\ngreat deal is imported from adjoining countries, although, there is a\r\nprotective tariff of six dollars per hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nTHE GUIANAS. Coffee has had a precarious existence in the Guianas.\r\nPlants are said to have been brought by Dutch voyagers from Amsterdam in\r\n1718 or 1720. They flourished in the new habitat to which they were\r\nintroduced, and in 1725 were carried from Dutch Guiana into the district\r\nof Berbice in British Guiana and into French Guiana. There the berry was\r\na considerable success for a time; Berbice coffee especially acquiring a\r\ngood reputation; and when Demerara was settled, coffee became a staple\r\nof that region. Shortage of native labor, and the difficulty of\r\nprocuring cheap and capable workers from outside the country, ultimately\r\ncompelled the practical abandonment of the crop in all three sections,\r\nDutch, French, and British. In British Guiana it is now grown mainly for\r\ndomestic consumption, and the same is true of French Guiana, which also\r\nimports.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of its introduction, about 1718, until about 1880, the\r\nonly coffee grown in Surinam, or Dutch Guiana, was the _Coffea arabica_.\r\nIt was not a bountiful producer, and with labor scarce and unreliable,\r\nits cultivation was expensive. Therefore experiment was made with the\r\n_liberica_ plant. This proved to be very satisfactory, growing\r\nluxuriantly, producing abundantly, and requiring minimum labor in care.\r\nIn 1918 some 16,000,000 pounds were produced.\r\n\r\nECUADOR. Though not of great commercial importance, coffee in Ecuador\r\ngrows on both the mainland and on the adjacent islands. The area planted\r\nto coffee is estimated at 32,000 acres having an aggregate of about\r\n8,000,000 trees. The trees blossom in December, and the picking season\r\nis through April, May and June. Coffee ranks third in value among the\r\nexports of the country.\r\n\r\nPERU. Although possessed of natural coffee land and climate, little has\r\nbeen done to develop the industry in Peru. A finely flavored coffee\r\ngrows at an altitude of 7,000 feet, while that grown in the lowlands\r\nalong the Pacific coast is not so desirable. Such small quantities as\r\nare grown are cultivated in the mountain districts of Choquisongo,\r\nCajamarca, Perene, Paucartambo, Chaucghamayo, and Huanace. The\r\nPacific-coast district of Paces-mayo also grows a not unimportant crop.\r\n\r\nBOLIVIA. Comparatively little attention is given to coffee cultivation\r\nin Bolivia. Agricultural methods are crude, and are limited to cutting\r\ndown weeds and undergrowth twice a year. The coffee is planted in small\r\npatches, or as hedges along the roads or around the fields of other\r\ncrops. The first crop is picked at the end of one and a half or two\r\nyears. The trees bear for fifteen to twenty years. The average yield is\r\nfrom three to eight pounds per tree. The best grades of coffee are grown\r\nat 2,000 to 6,000 feet above sea level.\r\n\r\nCoffee is cultivated in the departments of La Paz, Cochabamba, Santa\r\nCruz, El Beni, and Chuquisca. In the department of Santa Cruz there are\r\nplantations in the provinces of Sara, Velasco, Chiquitos and Cordillera.\r\nIn the Yungas and the Apolobamba districts of La Paz, its cultivation\r\nreaches the greatest importance, but even there is not of large\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nCHILE, PARAGUAY, AND ARGENTINA. Coffee is of minor, almost\r\ninsignificant, importance in the agriculture of Chile, Paraguay, and\r\nArgentina. In Uruguay the climate is altogether unsuitable for it.\r\n\r\nArgentina and Paraguay each have small growing districts. In the first\r\nnamed, only the provinces of Salta and Jujuy have, at the latest\r\nreports, a little more than 3,000 acres under cultivation. In Paraguay\r\nsome householders have grown coffee in their yards solely for their own\r\nuse. In the Paraguayan district of Altos, north of Asuncion, a small\r\ngroup of plantations was started before the outbreak of the World War,\r\nand produced about 300,000 pounds of coffee in a year.\r\n\r\nCEYLON. Coffee planting in Ceylon was an important industry for a\r\ncentury, until the so-called Ceylon leaf disease attacked the\r\nplantations in 1869, and a few years later had practically destroyed all\r\nthe trees of the country. Although coffee raising has continued since\r\nthen, there has been, especially since the beginning of the twentieth\r\ncentury, a steady decline in acreage. There were 4,875 acres under\r\ncultivation in 1903, 2,433 acres in 1907, 1,389 in 1912, and 941.5 in\r\n1919. Only 2,200 pounds were produced in 1917. However, the climate and\r\nsoil of Ceylon seem adapted to coffee culture, and the experimental\r\nstations at Peradeniya and Anuradhapura have been experimenting in\r\nrecent years with _robusta_, _canephora_, _Ugandæ_, and a _robusta_\r\nhybrid for the purpose of reviving the industry in the country.\r\n\r\nCeylon is one of the oldest coffee-growing countries, the Arabs having\r\nexperimented with it there, according to legend, long before the\r\nPortuguese seized the island in 1505. The Dutch, who gained control in\r\n1658, continued the cultivation, and in 1690 introduced more systematic\r\nmethods. They sent a few pounds in 1721 to Amsterdam, where the coffee\r\nbrought a higher price than Java or Mocha. However, it was not until\r\nafter the British occupied the island in 1796, that coffee growing was\r\ncarried on extensively. The first British-owned upland plantation was\r\nstarted in 1825 by Sir Edward Barnes; and for more than fifty years\r\nthereafter coffee was one of the island's leading products. An orgy of\r\nspeculation in coffee growing in Ceylon, in which £5,000,000 sterling\r\nare said to have been invested, culminated in 1845 in the bursting of\r\nthe coffee bubble, and hundreds were ruined. The peak of the export\r\ntrade was reached in 1873, when 111,495,216 pounds of coffee were sent\r\nout of the country. Even then, the plantations were suffering severely\r\nfrom the leaf disease, which had appeared in 1869; and by 1887, the\r\ncoffee tree had practically disappeared from Ceylon. Ceylon's day in\r\ncoffee was a cycle of fifty-odd years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBUSTA COFFEE GROWING ON THE SUZANNAH ESTATE,\r\nCOCHIN-CHINA]\r\n\r\nFRENCH INDO-CHINA. Coffee culture in French Indo-China is a\r\ncomparatively small factor in international trade, although production\r\nis on the increase, particularly from those plantations planted to\r\n_robusta_, _liberica_, and _excelsa_ varieties. The average annual\r\nexport for the five-year period ended with 1918 was 516,978 pounds,\r\nnearly all of it going to France.\r\n\r\nThe first experiments with coffee growing were begun in 1887, near Hanoi\r\nin Tonkin. The seeds were of the _arabica_ variety, brought from\r\nRéunion, and the production from the first years was distributed\r\nthroughout the country to foster the industry. Eventually _arabica_ was\r\nfound unsuitable to the soil and climate, and experiments were begun\r\nwith _robusta_ and other hardier types.\r\n\r\nA survey of the industry of the country in 1916 showed that the plant\r\nwas being successfully grown in the provinces of Tonkin, Anam, and\r\nCochin-China, and that altogether there were about 1,000,000 trees in\r\nbearing. The plantations are mostly in the foot-hills of the mountain\r\nranges or on the slopes, although a few are located near the coast line\r\nat 1,000 feet, or even less, above sea-level.\r\n\r\nThe larger and more successful plantations follow advanced methods of\r\nplanting and cultivating, while the government maintains experimental\r\nstations for the purpose of fostering the industry. It is believed that\r\nFrench Indo-China in coming years will assume an important position in\r\nthe coffee trade of the world, particularly as a source of supply for\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nFEDERATED MALAY STATES, INCLUDING STRAITS SETTLEMENTS. Rubber has been\r\nthe chief cause of the decline of coffee industry in the Federated Malay\r\nStates. Since the closing years of the nineteenth century coffee has\r\nbeen steadily on the downward path in acreage and production, with the\r\npossible exception of parts of Straits Settlements, which in 1918\r\nexported, mostly to England, some 3,500,000 pounds of good grade coffee.\r\nThe other sections of the federation shipped less than 1,000,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nIn the early days, planters of the Malay Peninsula knew little about\r\nproper methods of cultivating, and depended mostly upon what they\r\nlearned of the practises in Ceylon, which, unfortunately for them, were\r\nnot at all suited to the Malay country. They secured their best crops\r\nfrom lowlands where peaty soil prevailed, and eventually all the coffee\r\ngrown on the peninsula came from such regions.\r\n\r\n_Liberica_ is mostly favored, and is grown with some success as an\r\ninter-crop with cocoanuts and rubber. The _robusta_ variety has also\r\nbeen introduced, but does not seem to do as well as the _liberica_.\r\nBetween 2,300 and 2,600 acres, according to recent returns, have been\r\nunder coffee as a catch-crop with cocoanuts, out of a total of 40,000\r\nacres in cocoanut estates. One planter has been reported as making quite\r\na success with this method of inter-cropping for coffee, but it is not\r\ngenerally approved.\r\n\r\nThere has been a general decline in acreage, product, and exports since\r\nthe closing years of the nineteenth century, until now the industry is\r\nregarded as practically at a stand-still and likely so to remain as long\r\nas rubber shall continue to hold the commercially high position to which\r\nit has attained. Unsatisfactory prices realized for the crop, poor\r\ngrowth of the trees in some localities, and the gradual weakening of the\r\ntrees under rubber as they mature, are offered as the principal\r\nexplanations of this decrease in acreage. Nearly all the Malay crop in\r\nrecent years has been grown in Selangor, though Negri Sembilan, Pahang,\r\nand Perak continue as factors in the trade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE TREES OF THE BOURBON VARIETY, FRENCH INDO-CHINA]\r\n\r\nAUSTRALIA. Although Australia is a prospective coffee-growing country of\r\nlarge natural possibilities, the _Australian Year Book_ for 1921 states\r\nthat Queensland is the one state in which experiments have been tried,\r\nand that in 1919-20 there were only twenty-four acres under cultivation.\r\nQueensland soils are of volcanic origin, exceptionally rich, and\r\nsupport trees that are vigorous and prolific with a bean of fine\r\nquality. The _arabica_ is chiefly cultivated, and the trees can be\r\nsuccessfully grown on the plains at sea-level as well as up to a height\r\nof 1,500 or 2,000 feet. The trees mature earlier than in some other\r\ncountries. Planted in January, they frequently blossom in December of\r\nthe next year, or a month later, and yield a small crop in July or\r\nAugust; that is, in about two years and a half from the time of\r\nplanting. The bean closely resembles the choice Blue Mountain coffee of\r\nJamaica. For coffee cultivation the labor cost is almost prohibitive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PICKING COFFEE ON A NORTH QUEENSLAND PLANTATION]\r\n\r\nAs much as fifteen hundred-weight of beans per acre have been gathered\r\nfrom trees in North Queensland; and for years the average was ten\r\nhundred-weight per acre. After thirty years of cultivation, no signs of\r\ndisease have appeared. At late as 1920, the government was proposing to\r\nmake advances of fourteen cents a pound upon coffee in the parchment to\r\nencourage the development of the industry to a point where it would be\r\npossible for local coffee growers to capture at least the bulk of the\r\ncommonwealth's import coffee trade of 2,605,240 pounds.\r\n\r\nCoffee grows well in most all the islands of the Pacific Ocean, and in\r\nsome of them, as in the Philippines and Hawaii, the industry in past\r\nyears, reached considerable importance.\r\n\r\nHAWAII. Coffee has been grown in Hawaii since 1825, from plants brought\r\nfrom Brazil. It has also been said that seed was brought by Vancouver,\r\nthe British navigator, on his Pacific exploration voyage, 1791-94. Not,\r\nhowever, until 1845 was an official record made of the crop, which was\r\nthen 248 pounds. The first plantations, started on the low levels, near\r\nthe sea, did not do well; and it was not until the trees were planted at\r\nelevations of from 1,000 to 3,000 feet above sea-level that better\r\nreturns were obtained.\r\n\r\nCoffee is grown on all the islands of the group, but nowhere to any\r\ngreat extent except on Hawaii, which produces ninety-five percent of the\r\nentire crop. Next in importance, though far behind, is the island of\r\nOahu. On Hawaii there are four principal coffee districts, Kona,\r\nHamakua, Puna, and Olaa. About four-fifths of the total output of the\r\nislands is produced in Kona. At one time there were considerable coffee\r\nareas in Maui and Kauai, but sugar cane eventually there took the place\r\nof coffee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE IN BLOSSOM, CAPTAIN COOK COFFEE COMPANY ESTATE,\r\nKEALAKEKUA, KONA, HAWAII]\r\n\r\nThe Kona coffee district extends for many miles along the western slope\r\nof the island of Hawaii and around famous Kealakekua Bay. The soil is\r\nvolcanic, and even rocky; but coffee trees flourish surprisingly well\r\namong the rocks, and are said to bear a bean of superior quality.\r\n\r\nCoffee trees in Kona are planted principally in the open, though\r\nsometimes they are shaded by the native _kukui_ trees. They are grown\r\nfrom seed in nurseries; and the seedlings, when one year old, are\r\ntransplanted in regular lines nine feet apart. In two years a small crop\r\nis gathered, yielding from five to twelve bags of cleaned coffee per\r\nacre. At three years of age the trees produce from eight to twenty bags\r\nof cleaned coffee per acre, and from that time they are fully matured.\r\nThe ripening season is between September and January, and there are two\r\nprincipal pickings. Many of the trees are classed as wild; that is, they\r\nare not topped, and are cultivated in an irregular manner and are poorly\r\ncared for; but they yield 700 or 800 pounds per acre. The fruit ripens\r\nvery uniformly, and is picked easily and at slight expense.\r\n\r\nIt is calculated that in the Hawaiian group more than 250,000 acres of\r\ngood coffee land are available and about 200,000 acres more of fair\r\nquality. Comparatively little of this possible acreage has been put to\r\nuse. According to the census of 1889, there were then 6,451 acres\r\ndevoted to coffee, having, young and old, 3,225,743 bearing trees. The\r\nyield, in that census year, was 2,297,000 pounds, of which 2,112,650\r\npounds were credited to Hawaii, the small remainder coming from Maui,\r\nOahu, Kauai, and Molokai.\r\n\r\nA blight in 1855-56 set back the industry, many plantations being ruined\r\nand then given over to sugar cane. After the blight had disappeared, the\r\nplantations were re-established, and prosperity continued for years.\r\nFollowing the American occupation of the islands in 1898, came another\r\nperiod of depression. With the loss of the protective tariff that had\r\nexisted, prices fell to an unremunerativte figure; and the more\r\nprofitable sugar cane was taken up again. After 1912, the increased\r\ndemand for coffee, with higher prices, led again to hopes for the future\r\nof the industry. Planting was encouraged; and it has been demonstrated\r\nthat from lands well selected and intelligently cultivated it is\r\npossible to have a yield of from 1,200 to 2,100 pounds per acre.\r\nImprovements have also been made in pulping and milling facilities. Many\r\nof the plantations are cultivated by Japanese labor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE GROWING UNDER SHADE, HAMAKUA, H.I.]\r\n\r\nExports of coffee from Hawaii to the principal countries of the world in\r\n1920 were 2,573,300 pounds.\r\n\r\nPHILIPPINE ISLANDS. Spanish missionaries from Mexico are said to have\r\ncarried the coffee plant to the Philippine Islands in the latter part of\r\nthe eighteenth century. At first it was cultivated in the province of La\r\nLaguna; but afterward other provinces, notably Batangas and Cavite, took\r\nit up; and in a short time the industry was one of the most important in\r\nthe islands. The coffee was of the _arabica_ variety. In the middle of\r\nthe eighteenth century, and after, the industry had a position of\r\nimportance; several provinces produced profitable crops that contributed\r\nmuch to the wealth of the communities where the berry was cultivated. In\r\nthose days the city of Yipa was an important trading center. In the\r\nperiod of its prime Philippine coffee enjoyed fine repute, especially in\r\nSpain, Great Britain, and China (at Hong Kong), those three countries\r\nbeing the largest consumers. At one time--in 1883 and 1884--the annual\r\nexport was 16,000,000 pounds, which demonstrates the importance of the\r\nindustry at the peak of its prosperity. The leaf blight appeared on the\r\nisland about 1889, causing destruction from which there has not yet been\r\ncomplete recovery. The export of 3,086 pounds in 1917 shows the depths\r\ninto which the industry had fallen.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Agriculture at Manila announced in 1915 that an effort was\r\nto be made to re-habilitate the coffee industry of the islands. Nothing\r\ncame of the effort, which died a-borning. Since then, several attempts\r\nto introduce disease-resisting varieties of coffee from Java have failed\r\nbecause of lack of interest on the part of the natives.\r\n\r\nDespite the misfortunes that have overwhelmed it in the past and are now\r\nretarding its growth, it is still believed that the industry in these\r\nislands may be re-habilitated. Conditions of soil and climate are\r\nfavorable; land and labor are cheap, abundant, and dependable: railroads\r\nrun into the best coffee regions, and good cart roads are in process of\r\nconstruction. Some plantations of consequence are still in existence,\r\nand serious consideration is being given to their development and to\r\nincreasing their number.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COFFEE TREE THRIVES IN THE LAVA SOIL OF SOUTH KONA,\r\nISLAND OF HAWAII]\r\n\r\nGUAM. Coffee is one of the commonest wild plants on the little island of\r\nGuam. It grows around the houses like shade trees or flowering shrubs,\r\nand nearly every family cultivates a small patch. Climate and soil are\r\nfavorable to it; and it flourishes, with abundant crops, from the\r\nsea-level to the tops of the highest hills. The plants are set in\r\nstraight rows, from three and a half to seven feet apart, and are shaded\r\nby banana trees or by cocoanut leaves stuck in the ground. There is no\r\nproduction for export, scarcely enough for home consumption.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE PLANTATION NEAR SAGADA, BONTOC PROVINCE, P.I.]\r\n\r\nOTHER PACIFIC ISLANDS. Other islands of the Pacific do not loom large in\r\ncoffee growing, though New Caledonia gives promise as a producer,\r\nexporting 1,248,024 pounds in 1916, most of which was _robusta_. Tahiti\r\nproduces a fair coffee, but in no commercial quantity. In the Samoan\r\ngroup there are plantations, small in number, in size, and in amount of\r\nproduction. Several islands of the Fiji group are said to be well\r\nadapted to coffee, but little is grown there and none for export.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OWNER'S RESIDENCE ADJOINING DRYING GROUNDS ON ONE OF THE\r\nLARGE ESTATES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRYING GROUNDS, FAZENDA SANTA ADELAIDE, RIBEIRAO PRETO]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE PREPARATION IN SÃO PAULO, BRAZIL]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nPREPARING GREEN COFFEE FOR MARKET\r\n\r\n     _Early Arabian methods of preparation--How primitive devices were\r\n     replaced by modern methods--A chronological story of the\r\n     development of scientific plantation machinery, and the part played\r\n     by British and American inventors--The marvelous coffee package,\r\n     one of the most ingenious in all nature--How coffee is\r\n     harvested--Picking--Preparation by the dry and the wet\r\n     methods--Pulping--Fermentation and washing--Drying--Hulling; or\r\n     peeling, and polishing--Sizing, or grading--Preparation methods of\r\n     different countries_\r\n\r\n\r\nLa Roque[316], in his description of the ancient coffee culture, and the\r\npreparation methods as followed in Yemen, says that the berries were\r\npermitted to dry on the trees. When the outer covering began to shrivel,\r\nthe trees were shaken, causing the fully matured fruits to drop upon\r\ncloths spread to receive them. They were next exposed to the sun on\r\ndrying-mats, after which they were husked by means of wooden or stone\r\nrollers. The beans were given a further drying in the sun, and then were\r\nsubmitted to a winnowing process, for which large fans were used.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Development of Plantation Machinery_\r\n\r\nThe primitive methods of the original Arab planters were generally\r\nfollowed by the Dutch pioneers, and later by the French, with slight\r\nmodifications. As the cultivation spread, necessity for more effective\r\nmethods of handling the ripened fruit mothered inventions that soon\r\nbegan to transform the whole aspect of the business. Probably the first\r\nnotable advance was in curing, when the West Indian process, or wet\r\nmethod, of cleaning the berries was evolved.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that Brazil began the active cultivation of coffee,\r\nWilliam Panter was granted the first English patent on a \"mill for\r\nhusking coffee.\" This was in 1775. James Henckel followed with an\r\nEnglish patent, granted in 1806, on a coffee drier, \"an invention\r\ncommunicated to him by a certain foreigner.\" The first American to enter\r\nthe lists was Nathan Reed of Belfast, Me., who in 1822 was granted a\r\nUnited States patent on a coffee huller. Roswell Abbey obtained a United\r\nStates patent on a huller in 1825; and Zenos Bronson, of Jasper County,\r\nGa., obtained one on another huller in 1829. In the next few years many\r\nothers followed.\r\n\r\nJohn Chester Lyman, in 1834, was granted an English patent on a coffee\r\nhuller employing circular wooden disks, fitted with wire teeth. Isaac\r\nAdams and Thomas Ditson of Boston brought out improved hullers in 1835;\r\nand James Meacock of Kingston, Jamaica, patented in England, in 1845, a\r\nself-contained machine for pulping, dressing, and sorting coffee.\r\n\r\nWilliam McKinnon began, in 1840, the manufacture of coffee plantation\r\nmachinery at the Spring Garden Iron Works, founded by him in 1798 in\r\nAberdeen, Scotland. He died in 1873; but the business continues as Wm.\r\nMcKinnon & Co., Ltd.\r\n\r\nAbout 1850 John Walker, one of the pioneer English inventors of\r\ncoffee-plantation machinery, brought out in Ceylon his cylinder pulper\r\nfor Arabian coffee. The pulping surface was made of copper, and was\r\npierced with a half-moon punch that raised the cut edges into half\r\ncircles.\r\n\r\nThe next twenty years witnessed some of the most notable advances in the\r\ndevelopment of machinery for plantation treatment, and served to\r\nintroduce the inventions of several men whose names will ever be\r\nassociated with the industry.\r\n\r\nJohn Gordon & Co. began the manufacture in London of the line of\r\nplantation machinery still known around the world as \"Gordon make\" in\r\n1850; and John Gordon was granted an English patent on his improved\r\ncoffee pulper in 1859.\r\n\r\nRobert Bowman Tennent obtained English (1852) and United States (1853)\r\npatents on a two-cylinder pulper.\r\n\r\nGeorge L. Squier began the manufacture of plantation machinery in\r\nBuffalo, N.Y., in 1857. He was active in the business until 1893, and\r\ndied in 1910. The Geo. L. Squier Manufacturing Co. still continues as\r\none of the leading American manufacturers of coffee-plantation\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nMarcus Mason, an American mechanical engineer in San José, Costa Rica,\r\ninvented (1860) a coffee pulper and cleaner which became the foundation\r\nstone of the extensive plantation-machinery business of Marcus Mason &\r\nCo., established in 1873 at Worcester, Mass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WALKER'S ORIGINAL DISK PULPER, 1860\r\n\r\nMuch favored in Ceylon and India]\r\n\r\nJohn Walker was granted (1860) an English patent on a disk pulper in\r\nwhich the copper pulping surface was punched, or knobbed, by a blind\r\npunch that raised rows of oval knobs but did not pierce the sheet, and\r\nso left no sharp edges. During Ceylon's fifty years of coffee\r\nproduction, the Walker machines played an important part in the\r\nindustry. They are still manufactured by Walker, Sons & Co., Ltd., of\r\nColombo, and are sold to other producing countries.\r\n\r\nAlexius Van Gulpen began the manufacture of a green-coffee-grading\r\nmachine at Emmerich, Germany, in 1860.\r\n\r\nFollowing Newell's United States patents of 1857-59, sixteen other\r\npatents were issued on various types of coffee-cleaning machines, some\r\ndesigned for plantation use, and some for treating the beans on arrival\r\nin the consuming countries.\r\n\r\nJames Henry Thompson, of Hoboken, and John Lidgerwood were granted, in\r\n1864, an English patent on a coffee-hulling machine. William Van Vleek\r\nLidgerwood, American chargé d'affaires at Rio de Janeiro, was granted an\r\nEnglish patent on a coffee hulling and cleaning machine in 1866. The\r\nname Lidgerwood has long been familiar to coffee planters. The\r\nLidgerwood Manufacturing Co., Ltd., has its headquarters in London, with\r\nfactory in Glasgow. Branch offices are maintained at Rio de Janeiro,\r\nCampinas, and in other cities in coffee-growing countries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY ENGLISH COFFEE PEELER\r\n\r\nLargely used in India and Ceylon]\r\n\r\nProbably the name most familiar to coffee men in connection with\r\nplantation methods is Guardiola. It first appears in the chronological\r\nrecord in 1872, when J. Guardiola, of Chocola, Guatemala, was granted\r\nseveral United States patents on machines for pulping and drying coffee.\r\nSince then, \"Guardiola\" has come to mean a definite type of rotary\r\ndrying machine that--after the original patent expired--was manufactured\r\nby practically all the leading makers of plantation machinery. José\r\nGuardiola obtained additional United States patents on coffee hullers in\r\n1886.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROUP OF ENGLISH CYLINDER COFFEE-PULPING MACHINES]\r\n\r\nWilliam Van Vleek Lidgerwood, Morristown, N.J., was granted an English\r\npatent on an improved coffee pulper in 1875.\r\n\r\nSeveral important cleaning and grading machinery patents were granted by\r\nthe United States (1876-1878) to Henry B. Stevens, who assigned them to\r\nthe Geo. L. Squier Manufacturing Co., Buffalo, N.Y. One of them was on a\r\nseparator, in which the coffee beans were discharged from the hopper in\r\na thin stream upon an endless carrier, or apron, arranged at such an\r\ninclination that the round beans would roll by force of gravity down the\r\napron, while the flat beans would be carried to the top.\r\n\r\nC.F. Hargreaves, of Rio de Janeiro, was granted an English patent on\r\nmachinery for hulling, polishing, and separating coffee, in 1879.\r\n\r\nThe first German patent on a coffee drying apparatus was granted to\r\nHenry Scolfield, of Guatemala, in 1880.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 Evaristo Conrado Engelberg of Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil,\r\ninvented an improved coffee huller which, three years later, was\r\npatented in the United States. The Engelberg Huller Co. of Syracuse,\r\nN.Y., was organized the same year (1888) to make and to sell Engelberg\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\nWalker Sons & Co., Ltd., began, in 1886, experimenting in Ceylon with a\r\nLiberian disk pulper that was not fully perfected until twelve years\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nAnother name, that has since become almost as well known as Guardiola,\r\nappears in the record in 1891. It is that of O'Krassa. In that year\r\nR.F.E. O'Krassa of Antigua, Guatemala, was granted an English patent on\r\na coffee pulper. Additional patents on washing, hulling, drying, and\r\nseparating machines were issued to Mr. O'Krassa in England and in the\r\nUnited States in 1900, 1908, 1911, 1912, and 1913.\r\n\r\nThe Fried. Krupp A.G. Grusonwerk, Magdeburg-Buckau, Germany, began the\r\nmanufacture of coffee plantation machines about 1892. Among others it\r\nbuilds coffee pulpers and hulling and polishing machines of the Anderson\r\n(Mexican) and Krull (Brazilian) types.\r\n\r\nAdditional United States patents were granted in 1895 to Marcus Mason,\r\nassignor to Marcus Mason & Co., New York, on machines for pulping and\r\npolishing coffee. Douglas Gordon assigned patents on a coffee pulper and\r\na coffee drier to Marcus Mason & Co. in 1904-05.\r\n\r\nThe names of Jules Smout, a Swiss, and Don Roberto O'Krassa, of\r\nGuatemala, are well known to coffee planters the world over because of\r\ntheir combined peeling and polishing machines.\r\n\r\nThe Huntley Manufacturing Co., Silver Creek, N.Y., began in 1896 the\r\nmanufacture of the Monitor line of coffee-grading-and-cleaning machines.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Marvelous Coffee Package_\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if in all nature there is a more cunningly devised food\r\npackage than the fruit of the coffee tree. It seems as if Good Mother\r\nNature had said: \"This gift of Heaven is too precious to put up in any\r\nordinary parcel. I shall design for it a casket worthy of its divine\r\norigin. And the casket shall have an inner seal that shall safeguard it\r\nfrom enemies, and that shall preserve its goodness for man until the day\r\nwhen, transported over the deserts and across the seas, it shall be\r\nbroken open to be transmuted by the fires of friendship, and made to\r\nyield up its aromatic nectar in the Great Drink of Democracy.\"\r\n\r\nTo this end she caused to grow from the heart of the jasmine-like\r\nflower, that first herald of its coming, a marvelous berry which, as it\r\nripens, turns first from green to yellow, then to reddish, to deep\r\ncrimson, and at last to a royal purple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPECIMENS OF COPPER COVERS FOR PULPER CYLINDERS\r\n\r\n1--For Arabian coffee (_Coffea arabica_). 2--For Liberian coffee\r\n(_Coffea liberica_). 3--Also for Arabian. 4--For _Coffea canephora_.\r\n5--For _Coffea robusta_. 6--For larger Arabian, and for _Coffea\r\nMaragogipe_.]\r\n\r\nThe coffee fruit is very like a cherry, though somewhat elongated and\r\nhaving in its upper end a small umbilicus. But mark with what ingenuity\r\nthe package has been constructed! The outer wrapping is a thin,\r\ngossamer-like skin which encloses a soft pulp, sweetish to the taste,\r\nbut of a mucilaginous consistency. This pulp in turn is wrapped about\r\nthe inner-seal--called the parchment, because of its tough texture. The\r\nparchment encloses the magic bean in its last wrapping, a delicate\r\nsilver-colored skin, not unlike fine spun silk or the sheerest of tissue\r\npapers. And this last wrapping is so tenacious, so true to its\r\nguardianship function, that no amount of rough treatment can dislodge it\r\naltogether; for portions of it cling to the bean even into the roasting\r\nand grinding processes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRYING GROUNDS, PULPING HOUSE, AND FERMENTATION VATS,\r\nBOA VISTA. BRAZIL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PULPING HOUSE AND FERMENTATION TANKS, COSTA RICA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE PREPARATION IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRANADA UNPULPED COFFEE SEPARATOR\r\n\r\nShown in combination with a Guatemala coffee pulper]\r\n\r\nCoffee is said to be \"in the husk,\" or \"in the parchment,\" when the\r\nwhole fruit is dried; and it is called \"hulled coffee\" when it has been\r\ndeprived of its hull and peel. The matter forming the fruit, called the\r\ncoffee berry, covers two thin, hard, oval seed vessels held together,\r\none to the other, by their flat sides. These seed vessels, when broken\r\nopen, contain the raw coffee beans of commerce. They are usually of a\r\nroundish oval shape, convex on the outside, flat inside, marked\r\nlongitudinally in the center of the flat side with a deep incision, and\r\nwrapped in the thin pellicle known as the silver skin. When one of the\r\ntwo seeds aborts, the remaining one acquires a greater size, and fills\r\nthe interior of the fruit, which in that case, of course, has but one\r\ncellule. This abortion is common in the _arabica_ variety, and produces\r\na bean formerly called _gragé_ coffee, but now more commonly known as\r\npeaberry, or male berry.\r\n\r\nThe various coverings of the coffee beans are almost always removed on\r\nthe plantations in the producing countries. Properly to prepare the raw\r\nbeans, it is necessary to remove the four coverings--the outer skin, the\r\nsticky pulp, the parchment, or husk, and the closely adhering silver\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct methods of treating the coffee fruits, or\r\n\"cherries.\" One process, the one that until recent years was in general\r\nuse throughout the world, and is still in many producing countries, is\r\nknown as the dry method. The coffee prepared in this way is sometimes\r\ncalled \"common,\" \"ordinary,\" or \"natural,\" to distinguish it from the\r\nproduct that has been cleaned by the wet or washed method. The wet\r\nmethod, or, as it is sometimes designated, the \"West Indian process\"\r\n(W.I.P.) is practised on all the large modern plantations that have a\r\nsufficient supply of water.\r\n\r\nIn the wet process, the first step is called pulping; the second is\r\nfermentation and washing; the third is drying; the fourth is hulling or\r\npeeling; and the last, sizing or grading. In the dry process, the first\r\nstep is drying; the second hulling; and the last, sizing or grading.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAND-POWER DOUBLE-DISK PULPER]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Harvesting_\r\n\r\nThe coffee cherry ripens about six to seven months after the tree has\r\nflowered, or blossomed; and becomes a deep purplish-crimson color. It is\r\nthen ready for picking. The ripening season varies throughout the world,\r\naccording to climate and altitude. In the state of São Paulo, Brazil,\r\nthe harvesting season lasts from May to September; while in Java, where\r\nthree crops are produced annually, harvesting is almost a continuous\r\nprocess throughout the year. In Colombia the harvesting seasons are\r\nMarch and April, and November and December. In Guatemala the crops are\r\ngathered from October through December; in Venezuela, from November\r\nthrough March. In Mexico the coffee is harvested from November to\r\nJanuary; in Haiti the harvest extends from November to March; in Arabia,\r\nfrom September to March; in Abyssinia, from September through November.\r\nIn Uganda, Africa, there are two main crops, one ripening in March and\r\nthe other in September, and picking is carried on during practically\r\nevery month except December and January. In India the fruit is ready for\r\nharvesting from October to January.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TANDEM COFFEE PULPER OF ENGLISH MAKE\r\n\r\nBeing a combination of a Bon-Accord-Valencia pulper with a Bon-Accord\r\nrepassing machine]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Picking_\r\n\r\nThe general practise throughout the world has been to hand-pick the\r\nfruit; although in some countries the cherries are allowed to become\r\nfully ripe on the trees, and to fall to the ground. The introduction of\r\nthe wet method of preparation, indeed, has made it largely unnecessary\r\nto hand-pick crops; and the tendency seems to be away from this practise\r\non the larger plantations. If the berries are gathered promptly after\r\ndropping, the beans are not injured, and the cost of harvesting is\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\nThe picking season is a busy time on a large plantation. All hands join\r\nin the work--men, women and children; for it must be rushed. Over-ripe\r\nberries shrink and dry up. The pickers, with baskets slung over their\r\nshoulders, walk between the rows, stripping the berries from the trees,\r\nusing ladders to reach the topmost branches, and sometimes even taking\r\nimmature fruit in their haste to expedite the work. About thirty pounds\r\nis considered a fair day's work under good conditions. As the baskets\r\nare filled, they are emptied at a \"station\" in that particular unit of\r\nthe plantation; or, in some cases, directly into wagons that keep pace\r\nwith the pickers. The coffee is freed as much as possible of sticks,\r\nleaves, etc., and is then conveyed to the preparation grounds.\r\n\r\nA space of several acres is needed for the various preparation processes\r\non the larger plantations; the plant including concrete-surfaced drying\r\ngrounds, large fermentation tanks, washing vats, mills, warehouses,\r\nstables, and even machine shops. In Mexico this place is known as the\r\n_beneficio_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Washed and Unwashed Coffee_\r\n\r\nWhere water is plenty, the ripe coffee cherries are fed by a stream of\r\nwater into a pulping machine which breaks the outer skins, permitting\r\nthe pulpy matter enveloping the beans to be loosened and carried away in\r\nfurther washings. It is this wet separation of the sticky pulp from the\r\nbeans, instead of allowing it to dry on them, to be removed later with\r\nthe parchment in the hulling operation, that makes the distinction\r\nbetween washed and unwashed coffees. Where water is scarce the coffees\r\nare unwashed.\r\n\r\nEither method being well done, does washing improve the strength and\r\nflavor? Opinions differ. The soil, altitude, climatic influences, and\r\ncultivation methods of a country give its coffee certain distinctive\r\ndrinking qualities. Washing immensely improves the appearance of the\r\nbean; it also reduces curing costs. Generally speaking, washed coffees\r\nwill always command a premium over coffees dried in the pulp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Costa Rica Vertical Coffee Washer]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Continuous Working Horizontal Coffee Washer]\r\n\r\nWhether coffee is washed or not, it has to be dried; and there is a kind\r\nof fermentation that goes on during washing and drying, about which\r\ncoffee planters have differing ideas, just as tea planters differ over\r\nthe curing of tea leaves. Careful scientific study is needed to\r\ndetermine how much, if any, effect this fermentation has on the ultimate\r\ncup value.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preparation by the Dry Method_\r\n\r\nThe dry method of preparing the berries is not only the older method,\r\nbut is considered by some operators as providing a distinct advantage\r\nover the wet process, since berries of different degrees of ripeness can\r\nbe handled at the same time. However, the success of this method is\r\ndependent largely on the continuance of clear warm weather over quite a\r\nlength of time, which can not always be counted on.\r\n\r\nIn this process the berries are spread in a thin layer on open drying\r\ngrounds, or barbecues, often having cement or brick surfaces. The\r\nberries are turned over several times a day in order to permit the sun\r\nand wind thoroughly to dry all portions. The sun-drying process lasts\r\nabout three weeks; and after the first three days of this period, the\r\nberries must be protected from dews and rains by covering them with\r\ntarpaulins, or by raking them into heaps under cover. If the berries are\r\nnot spread out, they heat, and the silver skin sticks to the coffee\r\nbean, and frequently discolors it. When thoroughly dry, the berries are\r\nstored, unless the husks (outer skin and inner parchment) are to be\r\nremoved at once. Hot air, steam, and other artificial drying methods\r\ntake the place of natural sun-drying on some plantations.\r\n\r\nIn the dry method, the husks are removed either by hand (threshing and\r\npounding in a mortar, on the smaller plantations) or by specially\r\nconstructed machinery, known as hulling machines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cobán Pulper in Tachira, Venezuela]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Wet Method--Pulping_\r\n\r\nThe wet method of preparation is the more modern form, and is generally\r\npractised on the larger plantations that have a sufficient supply of\r\nwater, and enough money to instal the quite extensive amount of\r\nmachinery and equipment required. It is generally considered that\r\nwashing results in a better grade of bean.\r\n\r\nIn this method the cherries are sometimes thrown into tanks full of\r\nwater to soak about twenty-four hours, so as to soften the outer skins\r\nand underlying pulp to a condition that will make them easily removable\r\nby the pulping machine--the idea being to rub away the pulp by friction\r\nwithout crushing the beans.\r\n\r\nOn the larger plantations, however, the coffee cherries are dumped into\r\nlarge concrete receiving tanks, from which they are carried the same day\r\nby streams of running water directly into the hoppers of the pulping\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\nAt least two score of different makes of pulping machines are in use in\r\nthe various coffee-growing countries. Pulpers are made in various sizes,\r\nfrom the small hand-operated machine to the large type driven by power;\r\nand in two general styles--cylinder, and disk.\r\n\r\nThe cylinder pulper, the latest style--suggesting a huge\r\nnutmeg-grater--consists of a rotary cylinder surrounded with a copper or\r\nbrass cover punched with bulbs. These bulbs differ in shape according to\r\nthe species, or variety, of coffee to be treated--_arabica_, _liberica_,\r\n_robusta_, _canephora_, or what not. The cylinder rotates against a\r\nbreast with pulping edges set at an angle. The pulping is effected by\r\nthe rubbing action of the copper cover against the edges, or ribs, of\r\nthe breast. The cherries are subjected to a rubbing and rolling motion,\r\nin the course of which the two parchment-covered beans contained in the\r\nmajority of the cherries become loosened. The pulp itself is carried by\r\nthe cover and is discharged through a pulp shoot, while the pulped\r\ncoffee is delivered through holes on the breast. Cylinder machines vary\r\nin capacity from 400 pounds (hand power) to 4,800 pounds (motive power)\r\nper hour.\r\n\r\nSome cylinder pulpers are double, being equipped with rotary screens or\r\noscillating sieves, that segregate the imperfectly pulped cherries so\r\nthat they may be put through again. Pulpers are also equipped with\r\nattachments that automatically move the imperfectly pulped material over\r\ninto a repassing machine for another rubbing. Others have attachments\r\npartially to crush the cherries before pulping.\r\n\r\nThe breasts in cylinder machines are usually made with removable steel\r\nribs; but in Brazil, Nicaragua, and other countries, where, owing to the\r\nshort season and scarcity of labor, the planters have to pick,\r\nsimultaneously, green, ripe, and over-ripe (dry) cherries, rubber\r\nbreasts are used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NIAGARA POWER COFFEE HULLER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MCKINNON'S GUARDIOLA COFFEE DRIER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SQUIER-GUARDIOLA COFFEE DRIER, WITH DIRECT-FIRE\r\nHEATER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRITISH AND AMERICAN COFFEE DRIERS--GUARDIOLA SYSTEM\r\n\r\nThere are numerous makes of coffee driers based upon the original\r\ninvention of José Guardiola of Chocola, Guatemala. In the two\r\nillustrated above both direct-fire heat and steam heat may be utilized]\r\n\r\nThe disk pulper (the earliest type, having been in use more than\r\nseventy years) is the style most generally used in the Dutch East Indies\r\nand in some parts of Mexico. The results are the same as those obtained\r\nwith the cylindrical pulper. The disk machine is made with one, two,\r\nthree, or four vertical iron disks, according to the capacity desired.\r\nThe disks are covered on both sides with a copper plate of the same\r\nshape, and punched with blind punches. The pulping operation takes place\r\nbetween the rubbing action of the blind punches, or bulbs, on the copper\r\nplates and the lateral pulping bars fitted to the side cheeks. As in the\r\ncylinder pulper, the distance between the surface of the bulbs and the\r\npulping bar may be adjusted to allow of any clearance that may be\r\nrequired, according to the variety of coffee to be treated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANOTHER AMERICAN GUARDIOLA DRIER]\r\n\r\nDisk pulpers vary in capacity from 1,200 pounds to 14,000 pounds of ripe\r\ncherry coffee per hour. They, too, are made in combinations employing\r\ncylindrical separators, shaking sieves, and repassing pulpers, for\r\ncompleting the pulping of all unpulped or partially pulped cherries.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fermentation and Washing_\r\n\r\nThe next step in the process consists in running the pulped cherries\r\ninto cisterns, or fermentation tanks, filled with water, for the purpose\r\nof removing such pulp as was not removed in the pulping machine. The\r\nsaccharine matter is loosened by fermentation in from twenty-four to\r\nthirty-two hours. The mass is kept stirred up for a short time; and, in\r\ngeneral practise, the water is drawn off from above, the light pulp\r\nfloating at the top being removed at the same time. The same tanks are\r\noften used for washing, but a better practise is to have separate tanks.\r\n\r\nSome planters permit the pulped coffee to ferment in water. This is\r\ncalled the wet fermentation process. Others drain off the water from the\r\ntanks and conduct the fermenting operation in a semi-dry state, called\r\nthe dry fermentation process.\r\n\r\nThe coffee bean, when introduced into the fermentation tanks, is\r\nenclosed in a parchment shell made slimy by its closely adhering\r\nsaccharine coat. After fermentation, which not only loosens the\r\nremaining pulp but also softens the membranous covering, the beans are\r\ngiven a final washing, either in washing tanks or by being run through\r\nmechanical washers. The type of washing machine generally used consists\r\nof a cylindrical tub having a vertical spindle fitted with a number of\r\nstirrers, or arms, which, in rotating, stir and lift up the parchment\r\ncoffee. In another type, the cylinder is horizontal; but the operation\r\nis similar.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drying_\r\n\r\nThe next step in preparation is drying. The coffee, which is still \"in\r\nthe parchment,\" but is now known as washed coffee, is spread out thinly\r\non a drying ground, as in the dry method. However, if the weather is\r\nunsuitable or can not be depended upon to remain fair for the necessary\r\nlength of time, there are machines which can be used to dry the coffee\r\nsatisfactorily. On some plantations, the drying is started in the open\r\nand finished by machine. The machines dry the coffee in twenty-four\r\nhours, while ten days are required by the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SMOUT PEELER AND POLISHER]\r\n\r\nThe object of the drying machine is to dry the parchment of the coffee\r\nso that it may be removed as readily as the skin on a peanut; and this\r\nobject is achieved in the most approved machines by keeping a hot\r\ncurrent of air stirring through the beans. One of the best-liked types,\r\nthe Guardiola, resembles the cylinder of a coffee-roasting machine. It\r\nis made of perforated steel plates in cylinder form, and is carried on a\r\nhollow shaft through which the hot air is circulated by a pressure fan.\r\nThe beans are rotated in the revolving cylinder; and as the hot air\r\nstrikes the wet coffee, it creates a steam that passes out through the\r\nperforations of the cylinder. Within the cylinder are compartments\r\nequipped with winged plates, or ribs, that keep the coffee constantly\r\nstirred up to facilitate the drying process. Another favorite is the\r\nO'Krassa. It is constructed on the principle just described, but differs\r\nin detail of construction from the Guardiola, and is able to dry its\r\ncontents a few hours quicker. Hot air, steam, and electric heat are all\r\nemployed in the various makes of coffee driers. A temperature from 65°\r\nto 85° centigrade is maintained during the drying process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: O'KRASSA'S COFFEE DRIER COMBINED WITH DIRECT-FIRE HEATER]\r\n\r\nWhen thoroughly dry, the parchment can be crumbled between the fingers,\r\nand the bean within is too hard to be dented by finger nail or teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hulling, Peeling, and Polishing_\r\n\r\nThe last step in the preparation process is called hulling or peeling,\r\nboth words accurately describing the purpose of the operation. Some\r\nhusking machines for hulling or peeling parchment coffee are polishers\r\nas well. This work may be done on the plantation or at the port of\r\nshipment just before the coffee is shipped abroad. Sometimes the coffee\r\nis exported in parchment, and is cleaned in the country of consumption;\r\nbut practically all coffee entering the United States arrives without\r\nits parchment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SMOUT PEELER AND POLISHER, WITH CYLINDER OPEN SHOWING\r\nCONE]\r\n\r\nPeeling machines, more accurately named hullers, work on the principle\r\nof rubbing the beans between a revolving inner cylinder and an outer\r\ncovering of woven wire. Machines of this type vary in construction. Some\r\nhave screw-like inner cylinders, or turbines, others having plain\r\ncone-shaped cores on which are knobs and ribs that rub the beans against\r\none another and the outer shell. Practically all types have sieve or\r\nexhaust-fan attachments, which draw the loosened parchment and silver\r\nskin into one compartment, while the cleaned beans pass into another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KRULL HULLING MACHINE (German)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANDERSON HULLING MACHINE (German)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EUREKA SEPARATOR AND GRADER (American)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARACOLILLO (PEABERRY) SEPARATOR (American)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENGELBERG HULLER AND SEPARATOR (American)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AMERICAN COFFEE HULLER AND POLISHER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WELL KNOWN AMERICAN AND GERMAN HULLING AND SEPARATING\r\nMACHINES]\r\n\r\nPolishers of various makes are sometimes used just to remove the silver\r\nskin and to give the beans a special polish. Some countries demand a\r\nhighly polished coffee; and to supply this demand, the beans are sent\r\nthrough another huller having a phosphor-bronze cylinder and cone. Much\r\nGuadeloupe coffee is prepared in this way, and is known as _café\r\nbonifieur_ from the fact that the polishing machine is called in\r\nGuadeloupe the _bonifieur_ (improver). It is also called _café de luxe_.\r\nCoffee that has not received the extra polish is described as\r\n_habitant_; while coffee in the parchment is known as _café en parché_.\r\nExtra polished coffee is much in demand in the London, Hamburg, and\r\nother European markets. A favorite machine for producing this kind of\r\ncoffee is the Smout combined peeler and polisher, the invention of Jules\r\nSmout, a Swiss. Don Roberto O'Krassa also has produced a highly\r\nsatisfactory combined peeler and polisher.\r\n\r\nFor hulling dry cherry coffee there are several excellent makes of\r\nmachines. In one style, the hulling takes place between a rotating disk\r\nand the casing of the machine. In another, it takes place between a\r\nrotary drum covered with a steel plate punched with vertical bulbs, and\r\na chilled iron hulling-plate with pyramidal teeth cast on the plate.\r\nBoth are adjustable to different varieties of coffee. In still another\r\ntype of machine, the hulling takes place between steel ribs on an\r\ninternal cylinder, and an adjustable knife, or hulling blade, in front\r\nof the machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EL MONARCA COFFEE CLASSIFIER]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sizing or Grading_\r\n\r\nThe coffee bean is now clean, the processes described in the foregoing\r\nhaving removed the outer skin, the saccharine pulp, the parchment, and\r\nthe silver skin. This is the end of the cleaning operations; but there\r\nare two more steps to be taken before the coffee is ready for the trade\r\nof the world--sizing and hand-sorting. These two operations are of great\r\nimportance; since on them depends, to a large extent, the price the\r\ncoffee will bring in the market.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old rope-drive transmission on Finca Ona.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hydro-electric power plant on Finca Ona.\r\n\r\nHYDRO-ELECTRIC INSTALLATION ON A GUATEMALA FINCA]\r\n\r\nSizing, or grading by sizes, is done in modern commercial practise by\r\nmachines that automatically separate and distribute the different beans\r\naccording to size and form. In principle, the beans are carried across a\r\nseries of sieves, each with perforations varying in size from the\r\nothers; the beans passing through the holes of corresponding sizes. The\r\nmajority of the machines are constructed to separate the beans into five\r\nor more grades, the principal grades being triage, third flats, second\r\nflats, first flats, and first and second peaberries. Some are designed\r\nto handle \"elephant\" and \"mother\" sizes. The grades have local\r\nnomenclature in the various countries.\r\n\r\nAfter grading, the coffee is picked over by hand to remove the faulty\r\nand discolored beans that it is almost impossible to remove thoroughly\r\nby machine. The higher grades of coffee are often double-picked; that\r\nis, picked over twice. When this is done on a large scale, the beans are\r\ngenerally placed on a belt, or platform, that moves at a regulated speed\r\nbefore a line of women and children, who pick out the undesirable beans\r\nas they pass on the moving belt. There are small machines of this type\r\nbuilt for one person, who operates the belt mechanism by means of a\r\ntreadle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preparation in the Leading Countries_\r\n\r\nThe foregoing description tells in general terms the story of the most\r\napproved methods of harvesting, shelling, and cleaning the coffee beans.\r\nThe following paragraphs will describe those features of the processes\r\nthat are peculiar to the more important large producing countries and\r\nthat differ in details or in essentials from the methods just outlined.\r\n\r\n\r\n_In the Western Hemisphere_\r\n\r\nBRAZIL. The operation of some of the large plantations in Brazil, a\r\nnumber of which have more than a million trees, requires a large number\r\nand a great variety of preparation machines and equipment. Generally\r\nconsidered, the State of São Paulo is better equipped with approved\r\nmachinery than any other commercial district in the world.\r\n\r\nIn Brazil, coffee plantations are known as _fazendas_, and the\r\nproprietors as _fazendeiros_, terms that are the equivalent of \"landed\r\nestates\" and \"landed proprietors.\" Practically every _fazenda_ in Brazil\r\nof any considerable commercial importance is equipped with the most\r\nmodern of coffee-cleaning equipment. Some of the larger ones in the\r\nstate of São Paulo, like the Dumont and the Schmidt estates, are\r\nprovided with private railways connecting the _fazendas_ with the main\r\nrailroad line some miles away, and also have miniature railway systems\r\nrunning through the _fazendas_ to move the coffee from one harvesting\r\nand cleaning operation to another. The coffee is carried in small cars\r\nthat are either pushed by a laborer or are drawn by horse or mule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PICKING COFFEE ON A WELL KEPT FAZENDA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANAGER'S RESIDENCE ON ONE OF THE BIG SÃO PAULO FAZENDAS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photographs by Courtesy of J. Aron & Co.\r\n\r\nDRYING GROUNDS ON A MODERN ESTATE IN RIBEIRAO PRETO]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAKING BRAZIL COFFEE READY TO MARKET]\r\n\r\nSome of the larger _fazendas_ cover thousands of acres, and have\r\nseveral millions of trees, giving the impression of an unending forest\r\nstretching far away into the horizon. Here and there are openings in\r\nwhich buildings appear, the largest group of structures usually\r\nconsisting of those making up the _cafezale_, or cleaning plant. Nearby,\r\nstand the handsome \"palaces\" of the _fazendeiros_; but not so close that\r\nthe coffee princes and their households will be disturbed by the almost\r\nconstant rumble of machinery and the voices of the workers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Copyright by Brown & Dawson.\r\n\r\nWORKING COFFEE ON DRYING FLATS, SÃO PAULO]\r\n\r\nBrazilian _fazendeiros_ follow the methods described in the foregoing in\r\npreparing their coffee for market, using the most modern of the\r\nequipment detailed under the story of the wet method of preparation. On\r\nmost of the _fazendas_ the machinery is operated by steam or\r\nelectricity, the latter coming more and more into use each year in all\r\nparts of the coffee-growing region.\r\n\r\nIn some districts, however, far in the interior, there are still to be\r\nfound small plantations where primitive methods of cleaning are even now\r\npractised. Producing but a small quantity of coffee, possibly for only\r\nlocal use, the cherries may be freed of their parchment by macerating\r\nthe husks by hand labor in a large mortar. On still another plantation,\r\nthe old-time bucket-and-beam crusher perhaps may be in use.\r\n\r\nThis consists of a beam pivoted on an upright upon which it moves freely\r\nup and down. On one end of the beam is an open bucket; and on the other,\r\na heavy stone. Water runs into the bucket until its weight causes the\r\nstone end of the beam to rise. When the bucket reaches the ground, the\r\nwater is emptied, and the stone crashes down on the coffee cherries\r\nlying in a large mortar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FERMENTING AND WASHING TANKS ON A SÃO PAULO FAZENDA]\r\n\r\nThe workers on some of the largest Brazilian _fazendas_ would constitute\r\nthe population of a small city--more than a thousand families often\r\nfinding continuous employment in cultivating, harvesting, cleaning, and\r\ntransporting the coffee to market. For the most part, the workers are of\r\nItalian extraction, who have almost altogether superseded the Indian and\r\nNegro laborers of the early days. The workers live on the _fazendas_ in\r\nquarters provided by the _fazendeiros_, and are paid a weekly or monthly\r\nwage for their services; or they may enter upon a year's contract to\r\ncultivate the trees, receiving extra pay for picking and other work.\r\nBrazil in the past has experimented with the slave system, with\r\ngovernment colonization, with co-operative planting, with the harvesting\r\nsystem, and with the share system. And some features of all these\r\nplans--except slavery, which was abolished in 1888--are still employed\r\nin various parts of the country, although the wage system predominates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: By Courtesy of J. Aron & Co.\r\n\r\nDRYING GROUNDS ON FAZENDA SCHMIDT, THE LARGEST IN BRAZIL]\r\n\r\nBrazil has six gradings for its São Paulo coffees, which are also\r\nclassified as Bourbon Santos, Flat Bean Santos, and Mocha-seed Santos.\r\nRio coffees are graded by the number of imperfections for New York, and\r\nas washed and unwashed for Havre. (See chapter XXIV.)\r\n\r\nCOLOMBIA. Practically all the countries of the western hemisphere\r\nproducing coffee in large quantities for export trade use the\r\ncleaning-and-grading machines specified in the first part of this\r\nchapter; and the installation of the equipment is increasing as its\r\nadvantages become better known.\r\n\r\nIn Colombia, now (1922), next to Brazil the world's largest producer,\r\nthe wet method of preparing the coffee for market is most generally\r\nfollowed, the drying processes often being a combination of sun and\r\ndrying machines. Many plantations have their own hulling equipment; but\r\nmuch of the crop goes in the cherry to local commercial centers where\r\nthere are establishments that make a specialty of cleaning and grading\r\nthe coffee.\r\n\r\nThe Colombia coffee crop is gathered twice a year, the principal one in\r\nMarch and April and the smaller one in November and December, although\r\nsome picking is done throughout the year. For this labor native Indian\r\nand negro women are preferred, as they are more rapid, skilful, and\r\ncareful in handling the trees. Contrary to the method in Brazil, where\r\nthe tree at one handling is stripped of its entire bearings, ripe and\r\nunripe fruit, here only the fully ripened fruit is picked. That\r\nnecessitates going over the ground several times, as the berries\r\nprogressively ripen. More time is consumed in this laborious operation,\r\nbut it is believed that thereby a better crop of more uniform grade is\r\nobtained and in the aggregate with less waste of time and effort.\r\n\r\nColombian planters classify their coffees as _café trillado_ (natural or\r\nsun-dried), _café lavado_ (washed), _café en pergamino_ (washed and\r\ndried in the parchment). They grade them as _excelso_ (excellent),\r\n_fantasia_ (_excelso_ and _extra_), _extra_ (extra), _primera_, (first),\r\n_segundo_ (second), _caracol_ (peaberry), _monstruo_ (large and\r\ndeformed), _consumo_ (defective), and _casilla_ (siftings).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREPARING COLOMBIAN COFFEE FOR THE MARKET]\r\n\r\nVENEZUELA. Venezuela employs both the dry and the wet methods of\r\npreparation, producing both \"washed\" and \"commons\" and also, like\r\nColombia, has a large part of the coffee cleaned in the trading centers\r\nof the various coffee districts. Dry, or unwashed, coffees are known as\r\n_trillado_ (milled), and compose the bulk of the country's output.\r\nVenezuela's plantation-working forces are largely natives of Indian\r\ndescent and negroes, some of them coming during harvesting season from\r\nadjoining Colombia and returning there after the picking is done. The\r\nresident workers labor under a sort of peonage system which is tacitly\r\nrecognized by both employee and employer, although no laws of peonage or\r\nslavery have ever existed in Venezuela. Under this system, the laborers\r\nlive in little colonies scattered over the _haciendas_, as the coffee\r\nplantations are called in Venezuela. Company stores keep them supplied\r\nwith all their wants. Modern plantation machinery is very scarce; the\r\nancient method of hulling coffee in a circular trough where the dried\r\nberries are crushed by heavy wooden wheels drawn by oxen, is still a\r\ncommon sight in Venezuela. In preparing washed coffees, some planters\r\nferment the pulped coffee under water (wet fermentation process); while\r\nothers ferment without water (dry fermentation).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THIS OLD-FASHIONED HULLING MACHINE IS OPERATED BY OX\r\nPOWER IN VENEZUELA]\r\n\r\nThe principal ports of shipments for Venezuela coffees are La Guaira,\r\nPuerto Cabello, and Maracaibo. Caracas, the capital, is five miles in an\r\nair line from the port of La Guaira; but in ascending the three thousand\r\nfeet of altitude to the city the railroad twists and turns among the\r\nmountains for a distance of twenty-four miles. By rail or motor the trip\r\nis one of much charm and great beauty.\r\n\r\nSALVADOR. The planters in Salvador favor the dry method of coffee\r\npreparation; and the bulk of the crop is natural, or unwashed.\r\n\r\nGUATEMALA. Most Guatemalas are prepared for market by the wet method.\r\nThe gathering of the crops furnishes employment for half the population.\r\nGerman and American settlers have introduced the latest improvements in\r\nmodern plantation machinery into Guatemala.\r\n\r\nMEXICO. In Mexico coffee is harvested from November to January, and\r\nlarge quantities are prepared by both the dry and the wet methods, the\r\nlatter being practised on the larger estates that have the necessary\r\nwater supply and can afford the machinery. Here, too, one will find\r\ncoffee being cleaned by the primitive hand-mortar and wind-winnowing\r\nmethod. Laborers are mostly half-breeds and Indians. Chinese coolies\r\nhave been tried and found satisfactory, and some Japanese are utilized,\r\nthough not largely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STREET CAR COFFEE TRANSPORT IN ORIZABA, MEXICO]\r\n\r\nHAITI. In Haiti the picking season is from November to March. In recent\r\nyears better attention has been paid to cultural and preparation\r\nmethods; and the product is more favorably regarded commercially. Large\r\nquantities are shipped to France and Belgium; and much of that sent to\r\nthe United States is reshipped to France, Belgium, and Germany, where it\r\nis sorted by hand. Both dry and wet methods are employed in Haiti.\r\n\r\nPORTO RICO. Here planters favor the wet method of coffee preparation.\r\nThe crop is gathered from August to December. The coffees are graded as\r\n_caracollilo_ (peaberry), _primero_ (hand-picked), _segundo_ (second\r\ngrade), _trillo_ (low grade).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE ON THE DRYING FLOORS IN PORTO RICO]\r\n\r\nNICARAGUA. The wet method of coffee preparation is mostly favored in\r\nNicaragua. Many of the large plantations are worked by colonies of\r\nAmericans and Germans who are competent to apply the abundant natural\r\nwater power of the country to the operation of modern coffee cleaning\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nCOSTA RICA. Costa Rica was one of the first countries of the western\r\nworld to use coffee cleaning machinery. Marcus Mason, an American\r\nmechanical engineer then managing an iron foundry in Costa Rica,\r\ninvented three machines that would respectively peel off the husk,\r\nremove the parchment and pulp, and winnow the light refuse from the\r\nbeans.\r\n\r\nThe inventor gave his original demonstration to the planters of San José\r\nin 1860, and duplicates were installed on all the large plantations. In\r\nthe course of the next thirty years, Mason brought out other machines\r\nuntil he had developed a complete line that was largely used on coffee\r\nplantations in all parts of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n_In the Eastern Hemisphere_\r\n\r\nModern cleaning machinery and methods of preparation are employed to\r\nsome extent in the large coffee-producing countries of the eastern\r\nhemisphere, and do not differ materially from those of the western.\r\n\r\nARABIA. In Arabia the fruit ripens in August or September, and picking\r\ncontinues from then until the last fruits ripen late in the March\r\nfollowing. The cherries, as they are picked, are left to dry in the sun\r\non the house-top terrace or on a floor of beaten earth. When they have\r\nbecome partly dry, they are hulled between two small stones, one of\r\nwhich is stationary, while the other is worked by the hand power of two\r\nmen who rotate it quickly. Further drying of the hulled berry follows.\r\nIt is then put into bags of closely woven aloe fiber, lined with matting\r\nmade of palm leaves. It is next sent to the local market at the foot of\r\nthe mountain. There, on regular market days, the Turkish or Arabian\r\nmerchants, or their representatives, buy and dispatch their purchases by\r\ncamel train to Hodeida or Aden. The principal primary market in recent\r\nyears has been the city of Beit-el-Fakih.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAKING COFFEE ON DRYING FLOORS--CHUVA DISTRICT,\r\nGUATEMALA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE DRYING PATIOS, HACIENDA LONGA-ESPANA, VENEZUELA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUN-DRYING COFFEE AMID SCENES OF RARE TROPICAL BEAUTY]\r\n\r\nIn Aden and Hodeida the bean is submitted to further cleaning by the\r\nprincipal foreign export houses to whom it has come from the mountains\r\nin rather dirty condition. Indian women are the sole laborers employed\r\nin these cleaning houses. First, the coffee beans are separated from the\r\ndry empty husks by tossing the whole into the air from bamboo trays, the\r\nworkers deftly permitting the husks to fly off while the beans are\r\ncaught again in the tray. The beans are then surface-cleaned by passing\r\nthem gently between two very primitive grindstones worked by men. A\r\nthird process is the complete clearing of the bean from the silver skin,\r\nand it is then ready for the final hand picking. Women are called into\r\nservice again, and they pick out the refuse husks, quaker or black,\r\nbeans, green or immature beans, white beans, and broken beans, leaving\r\nthe good beans to be weighed and packed for shipment. The cleaned beans\r\nare known as _bun safi_; the husks become _kisher_. Some of the poorer\r\nbeans also are sold, principally to France and to Egypt. Hand-power\r\nmachinery is used to a slight extent; but mostly the old-fashioned\r\nmethods hold sway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DRYING PATIO ON A COSTA RICA ESTATE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph by R.C. Wilhelm.\r\n\r\nEARLY GUARDIOLA STEAM DRIER, \"EL CANIDA\" PLANTATION, COSTA RICA]\r\n\r\nThe Yemen, or Arabian, bale, or package, is unique. It is made up of two\r\nfiber wrappers, one inside the other. The inside one is called _attal_\r\nor _darouf_. It is made from cut and plaited leaves of _nakhel douin_ or\r\n_narghil_, a species of palm. The outer covering, called _garair_, is a\r\nsack made of woven aloe fiber. The Bedouins weave these covers and bring\r\nthem to the export merchants at Aden and Hodeida. A Mocha bundle\r\ncontains one, two, or four fiber packages, or bales. When the bundle\r\ncontains one bale it is known as a half; when it contains two it is\r\nknown as quarters; and when it contains four it is known as eighths.\r\nArabian coffee for Boston used to be packed in quarters only; for San\r\nFrancisco and New York, in quarters and eighths. The longberry\r\nAbyssinian coffees were formerly packed in quarters only. Since the\r\nWorld War, however, there has been a scarcity of packing materials, and\r\npacking in quarters and eighths has stopped. Now, all Mocha, as well as\r\nHarar, coffee comes in halfs. A half weighs eighty kilos, or 176 pounds,\r\nnet--although a few exporters ship \"halfs\" of 160 pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIAN WOMEN CLEANING MOCHA COFFEE IN AN ADEN WAREHOUSE\r\n\r\nThere are four processes in cleaning Mocha coffee. In order to separate\r\nthe dried beans from the broken hulls these women (brought over from\r\nIndia) toss the beans in the air, very deftly permitting the empty hulls\r\nto fly off, and catch the coffee beans on the bamboo trays. Then the\r\ncoffee is passed between two primitive grindstones, turned by men. After\r\nthis grinding process the beans are separated from the crushed outside\r\nhulls and the loose silver skins. In the fourth process the Indian women\r\npick out by hand the remaining husks, the quakers, the immature beans,\r\nthe white beans and the broken beans. Being Mohammedans, their religion\r\ndoes not permit such little vanities as picture posing, which explains\r\nwhy their faces are covered and turned away from the camera.]\r\n\r\nABYSSINIA. Little machinery is used in the preparation of coffee in\r\nAbyssinia; none, in preparing the coffee known as Abyssinian, which is\r\nthe product of wild trees; and only in a few instances in cleaning the\r\nHarari coffee, the fruit of cultivated trees. Both classes are raised\r\nmostly by natives, who adhere to the old-time dry method of cleaning. In\r\nHarar, the coffee is sometimes hulled in a wooden mortar; but for the\r\nmost part it is sent to the brokers in parchment, and cleaned by\r\nprimitive hand methods after its arrival in the trading centers.\r\n\r\nANGOLA. In Angola the coffee harvest begins in June, and it is often\r\nnecessary for the government to lend native soldiers to the planters to\r\naid in harvesting, as the labor supply is insufficient. After picking,\r\nthe beans are dried in the sun from fourteen to forty days, depending\r\nupon the weather. After drying, they are brought to the hulling and\r\nwinnowing machines. There are now about twenty-four of these machines in\r\nthe Cazengo and Golungo districts, all manufactured in the United States\r\nand giving satisfactory results. They are operated by natives.\r\n\r\nA condition adversely affecting the trade has been the low price that\r\nAngola coffee commands in European markets. The cost of production per\r\n_arroba_ (thirty-three pounds) on the Cazengo plantations is $1.23,\r\nwhile Lisbon market quotations average $1.50, leaving only twenty-seven\r\ncents for railway transport to Loanda and ocean freight to Lisbon. It\r\nhas been unprofitable to ship to other markets on account of the\r\npreferential export duties. A part of the product is now shipped to\r\nHamburg, where it is known as the Cazengo brand. Next to Mocha, the\r\nCazengo coffee is the smallest bean that is to be found in the European\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLEANING AND GRADING COFFEE BY MACHINERY IN ADEN]\r\n\r\nJAVA AND SUMATRA. The coffee industry in Java and Sumatra, as well as in\r\nthe other coffee-producing regions of the Dutch East Indies, was begun\r\nand fostered under the paternal care of the Dutch government; and for\r\nthat reason, machine-cleaning has always been a noteworthy factor in the\r\nmarketing of these coffees. Since the government relinquished its\r\ncontrol over the so-called government estates, European operators have\r\nmaintained the standard of preparation, and have adopted new equipment\r\nas it was developed. The majority of estates producing considerable\r\nquantities of coffee use the same types of machinery as their\r\ncompetitors in Brazil and other western countries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRYING COFFEE IN THE SUN AT THE CUSTOM-HOUSE, HARAR,\r\nABYSSINIA]\r\n\r\nIn Java, free labor is generally employed; while on the east coast of\r\nSumatra the work is done by contract, the workers usually being bound\r\nfor three years. In both islands the laborers are mostly Javanese\r\ncoolies.\r\n\r\nUnder the contract system, the worker is subject to laws that compel him\r\nto work, and prevent him from leaving the estate until the contract\r\nperiod expires. Under the free-labor system, the laborer works as his\r\nwhims dictate. This forces the estate manager to cater to his workers,\r\nand to build up an organization that will hold together.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the working of the latter system, this outline--by John\r\nA. Fowler, United States trade commissioner--of the organization of a\r\nleading estate in Java will indicate the general practise in vogue:\r\n\r\n     The manager of this estate has had full control for twenty years\r\n     and knows the \"adat\" (tribal customs) of his people and the\r\n     individual peculiarities of the leaders. This estate has been\r\n     described as having one of the most perfect estate organizations in\r\n     Java. It consists of two divisions of 3,449 bouws (about 6,048\r\n     acres in all), of which 2,500 bouws are in rubber and coffee and\r\n     550 in sisal; the remainder includes rice fields, timber,\r\n     nurseries, bamboo, teak, pastures, villages, roads, canals, etc.\r\n\r\n     The foreign staff is under the supervision of a general manager,\r\n     and consists of the following personnel: A chief garden assistant\r\n     of section 1, who has under him four section assistants and a\r\n     native staff; a chief garden assistant of section 2, who has under\r\n     him three section assistants, an apprentice assistant, and a native\r\n     staff; a chief factory assistant, who has under him an assistant\r\n     machinist, an apprentice assistant, and a native staff; and,\r\n     finally, a bookkeeper. The term \"garden\" means the area under\r\n     cultivation.\r\n\r\n     The bookkeeper, a man of mixed blood, handles all the general\r\n     accounting, accumulating the reports sent in by the various\r\n     assistants. The two chief garden assistants are responsible to the\r\n     manager for all work outside the factory except the construction of\r\n     new buildings, which is in charge of the chief factory assistant.\r\n     The two divisions of the estate are subdivided into seven\r\n     agricultural sections, each section being in full charge of an\r\n     assistant. A section may include coffee, rubber, sisal, teak,\r\n     bamboo, a coagulation station and nurseries. The assistant's duties\r\n     include the supervision of road building and repairs, building\r\n     repairs, transportation, paying the labor, and the supervision of\r\n     section accounts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OPEN-AIR DRYING GROUNDS ON A WEST JAVA ESTATE\r\n\r\nThe beans are being turned by native Sudanese men and women]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF A MODERN COFFEE FACTORY IN EAST JAVA\r\n\r\nShowing pulping machinery and fermentation tanks]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREPARING JAVA COFFEE FOR THE MARKET]\r\n\r\n     The factory includes a water-power plant delivering, through an\r\n     American water wheel and by cable, 250 horse-power to the main\r\n     shafting, an auxiliary steam plant of 150 horse-power as a reserve,\r\n     a rubber mill, a coffee mill, three sisal-stripping machines,\r\n     smoke-houses, drying fields and houses for sisal, drying floors and\r\n     houses for coffee, sorting rooms, blacksmith shop, machine shop,\r\n     brass-fitting foundry, packing houses, warehouses, and other\r\n     equipment. The factory is in charge of a first assistant, who is a\r\n     machinist, with a European staff consisting of a machinist and an\r\n     apprentice assistant.\r\n\r\n     The chief garden assistant is paid 350 to 400 florins, and the\r\n     garden assistants start at 200 florins per month, with graduated\r\n     yearly increases up to 300 florins per month (florin=$0.40). The\r\n     chief factory assistant receives 300 florins, and the machinist and\r\n     bookkeeper 250 florins each.\r\n\r\n     The mandoer in charge of the air and kiln drying of coffee gets 25\r\n     florins per month, and the mandoer at the coffee mill 20 florins. A\r\n     woman mandoer in charge of the coffee sorters receives 0.50 florin\r\n     per day and 0.01 florin each for sewing the bags. This woman\r\n     supervises all the sorters, fixes their status, and inspects their\r\n     work. Unskilled labor (male) receives 0.40 florin per day in the\r\n     coffee sheds, and the women sorters are paid 0.50 florin per picul\r\n     of 136 pounds, measured before sorting. These women are graded into\r\n     three classes--those who can sort 1 picul in a day, those who can\r\n     sort three-fourths of a picul, and those who can sort but one-half\r\n     of a picul in a day. Some of these women become very expert in\r\n     sorting, and the quality of the output of a factory is largely\r\n     dependent on an ample supply of expert sorters. Many years are\r\n     required to develop an adequate personnel for this department.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE TRANSPORT IN JAVA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WORLD'S COFFEE TOWER COMPARED WITH THE EIFFEL AND\r\nWOOLWORTH TOWERS\r\n\r\nThe Woolworth Building, the world's loftiest office structure is 792\r\nfeet high from street to top of tower; its main section of 151 by 196\r\nfeet stretches up 386 feet, and its volume equals a total of 13,110,942\r\ncubic feet. But a tower made of the year's supply of bags of green\r\ncoffee (132 pounds each) would equal 73,649,115 cubic feet, or nearly\r\nsix times the bulk of the Woolworth Building. In the same proportions it\r\nwould rise 1,386 feet, with the lower section 260 by 340 feet and 670\r\nfeet high. Its dimensions would be nearly double those of the Woolworth\r\nBuilding in every direction. And the Eiffel Tower, reaching up 1,000\r\nfeet toward the sky would be lost in a tower made of a year's bags of\r\ncoffee. Such a tower would stand 1,425 feet high on a base area of 230\r\nfeet square, the size of the Eiffel's first floor.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF COFFEE\r\n\r\n     _A statistical study of world production of coffee by\r\n     countries--Per capita figures of the leading consuming\r\n     countries--Coffee-consumption figures compared with tea-consumption\r\n     figures in the United States and the United Kingdom--Three\r\n     centuries of coffee trading--Coffee drinking in the United States,\r\n     past and present--Reviewing the 1921 trade in the United States_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world's yearly production of coffee is on the average considerably\r\nmore than one million tons. If this were all made up into the refreshing\r\ndrink we get at our breakfast tables, there would be enough to supply\r\nevery inhabitant of the earth with some sixty cups a year, representing\r\na total of more than ninety billion cups. In terms of pounds the annual\r\nworld output amounts to about two and a quarter billions--an amount so\r\nlarge that if it were done up in the familiar one-pound paper packages;\r\nand if these packages were laid end to end in a row; they would form a\r\nline long enough to reach to the moon. If this average yearly production\r\nwere left in the sacks in which the coffee is shipped, the total of\r\n17,500,000 would be enough to form a broad six-foot pavement reaching\r\nentirely across the United States, upon which a man could walk steadily\r\nfor more than five months at the rate of twenty miles a day. This vast\r\namount of coffee comes very largely from the western hemisphere; and\r\nabout three-fourths of it, from a single country. The production,\r\nshipment, and preparation of this coffee, directly and indirectly\r\nsupport millions of workers; and many countries are entirely dependent\r\non it for their prosperity and economic well-being.\r\n\r\nDuring the crop year that ended June 30, 1921, this million-ton average\r\nwas considerably exceeded, though it did not approach the record yield\r\nof all time in the crop year 1906-07, when the total amounted to almost\r\n24,000,000 sacks; or, in round numbers, 3,000,000,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nAs indicated by the Statistical Record table, on page 274, Brazil\r\nproduces more than all the rest of the world put together. Coffee\r\ngrowing, however, is general throughout tropical countries, and in most\r\nof them constitutes one of the leading industries. Yet in most cases,\r\nthe actual production of these countries can only be estimated, as\r\naccurate figures, showing the exact output, are seldom kept. But the\r\ncontribution which each country makes to the total world traffic in\r\ncoffee can be determined by its export figures, which are obtainable in\r\nreasonably accurate and up-to-date form. The table on page 276 gives the\r\ncoffee export figures, in pounds, for practically every country that\r\nproduces coffee for sale outside its own borders. Figures are given for\r\nthe latest available year, and also for the average of the last five\r\nyears for which statistics are to be obtained. The figures are taken\r\nfrom official statistics, from the publications of the International\r\nInstitute of Agriculture of Rome, and from other authoritative sources.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICAL RECORD FOR

THE WORLD'S COFFEE CUP AND THE WORLD'S LARGEST SHIP\r\n\r\nThe statistical sharks talk of the 17,566,000 bags, or 2,318,712,000\r\npounds of coffee that the world drinks every year; but how many really\r\nappreciate what those huge figures mean? For instance, computing 40 cups\r\nof beverage to the pound, there are more than 90,000,000,000 cups drunk\r\nannually, or enough to fill a gigantic cup 4,000 feet in diameter and 40\r\nfeet deep, on which the \"Majestic,\" the world's largest ship, would\r\nappear floating approximately as shown in the drawing.]\r\n\r\nFor the most part, these figures of exportation are the only ones\r\navailable to indicate the actual coffee production in the countries\r\nnamed. The following additional data, however, will serve to show the\r\nextent to which the coffee-raising industry has developed in most of\r\nthese countries, and in a few places of minor importance not named in\r\nthe table:\r\n\r\nBRAZIL. The coffee industry of Brazil, which has furnished seventy\r\npercent of the world's coffee during the last ten years, has developed\r\nin a century and a half. Brazilian soil first made the acquaintance of\r\nthe coffee plant at Pará in 1723. A small export trade to Europe had\r\ndeveloped by 1770, the year when the first plantation was established in\r\nthe state of Rio de Janeiro, and from which the country's great industry\r\nreally dates. Development at first was apparently slow, as no exports\r\nare recorded until the beginning of the nineteenth century; so that the\r\nhistory of Brazil's coffee trade is a matter entirely of the nineteenth\r\nand twentieth centuries. Once started, however, the new line of export\r\nmade rapid progress. In 1800, the amount of coffee exported was 1720\r\npounds, contained in thirteen bags. Twenty years later, 12,896,000\r\npounds were shipped, the number of bags being 97,498. Ten years later,\r\nin 1830, this amount had increased to 64,051,000 pounds; and in 1840, to\r\n137,300,000 pounds. In 1852-53, the receipts for shipment at the ports\r\nwere double that amount, 284,592,000 pounds; in 1860-61 they were\r\n420,420,000 pounds; in 1870-71 they had increased to 427,416,000 pounds;\r\nin 1880-81 they were 764,945,000 pounds; in 1890-91, 739,654,000 pounds;\r\nand at the beginning of this century, 1900-01, they were 1,504,424,000\r\npounds, having passed the one billion-pound mark in 1896-97. The highest\r\npoint of coffee receipts in the country's history was reached in 1906-07\r\nwith 2,699,644,694 pounds; and since that year, the amount has staid at\r\nabout one and one-half billion pounds. Further expansion in the last\r\nfifteen years has been closely regulated to prevent overproduction.\r\n\r\nEXPORTS OF COFFEE FROM THE COFFEE-PRODUCING COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD\r\n\r\n_Country_                                       _Five-Year Average_\r\nSouth America:                 _Year_ _Pounds_  _Pounds_\r\n    Brazil                        1920   1,524,382,650    1,469,949,180\r\n    Colombia                      1920     190,961,953[c]   172,862,121\r\n    Venezuela                     1920      73,726,632      110,174,946\r\n    Guiana, Br.                   1917         267,344          257,152\r\n    Guiana, Fr.                   1918           1,100              970\r\n    Guiana, D.                    1918           3,856          923,644[d]\r\n    Ecuador                       1919       3,729,413        5,843,033\r\n    Peru                          1919         370,655          455,212\r\nCentral America:\r\n    Salvador                      1920      82,864,668       78,953,339\r\n    Nicaragua                     1920      15,345,398       23,243,865\r\n    Costa Rica                    1921[a]   29,401,683       28,667,262\r\n    Guatemala                     1920      94,205,569       88,213,080\r\n    Honduras                      1920[b]    1,091,977          646,574\r\nMexico                            1918      30,172,065       47,555,514[d]\r\nWest Indies:\r\n    Haiti                         1920[b]   61,970,694[e]    54,308,959[d]\r\n    Dominican Republic            1920       1,361,666        3,497,866\r\n    Jamaica                       1919       8,246,672        7,918,781\r\n    Porto Rico                    1921      29,967,879[f]  30,033,471[d][f]\r\n    Trinidad & Tobago             1920          73,201           19,639\r\n    Martinique                    1918          10,358           17,219\r\n    Guadeloupe                    1918       2,144,855        1,594,146\r\nDutch East Indies                 1920      99,020,453[i]   103,701,297[h]\r\nPacific Islands:\r\n    Br.

Most of this São Paulo coffee is exported through the port of\r\nSantos, which is consequently the leading coffee port of the world.\r\nBesides Santos, the ports of Rio de Janeiro and Victoria are of much\r\nimportance in the coffee trade, although some twenty or thirty million\r\npounds are exported each year through the port of Bahia, and smaller\r\namounts through various other ports. The crop year of Brazil runs from\r\nJuly 1 to June 30, the heaviest receipts for shipment coming as a rule\r\nin the months of August, September, and October of each year. One-third\r\nof the season's crop is usually received at ports of shipment before the\r\nlast of October, sometimes as early as the latter part of September;\r\none-half comes in by the middle or last of November; and two-thirds is\r\nusually received, by the end of January.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 1--COFFEE EXPORTS, 1850-1920\r\n\r\nThis diagram shows the exports of the principal coffee-producing\r\ncountries, omitting Brazil]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 21--1 COFFEE EXPORTS, 1916-1920\r\n\r\nThis diagram shows the exports of the leading coffee countries (except\r\nBrazil) in a period covering most of the World War]\r\n\r\nVENEZUELA. The coffee plant was introduced into Venezuela in 1784, being\r\nbrought from Martinique; and the first shipment abroad, consisting of\r\n233 bags, was made five years later. By 1830-31, production had\r\nincreased to 25,454,000 pounds; and in the next twenty years, it more\r\nthan trebled, amounting to 83,717,000 pounds in 1850-51. Since then,\r\nhowever, the increase has been much more gradual. In 1881-82, 94,369,000\r\npounds were produced; and about the same amount, 95,170,000 pounds, in\r\n1889-90. Twentieth-century production has apparently exceeded the\r\nhundred-million mark on the average, although there are no definite\r\nstatistics beyond export figures. These showed 86,950,000 pounds sent\r\nabroad in 1904-05; 103,453,000 pounds in 1908-09; and 88,155,000 pounds\r\nin 1918; the trade in the last-named year being cut down by war\r\nconditions. In 1919, the extraordinary amount of 179,414,815 pounds was\r\nexported, the high figure being due to the release of coffee stored from\r\nprevious years. It has been estimated that domestic consumption of\r\ncoffee would amount to a maximum of 25,000,000 pounds yearly, but may be\r\nmuch less than that. The United States and France have in the past been\r\nVenezuela's best customers.\r\n\r\nCOLOMBIA. Prior to 1912, the total production of coffee in Colombia was\r\naround 80,000,000 pounds annually, of which some 3,000,000 or 4,000,000\r\npounds were consumed in the country itself. But in the last decade\r\nproduction has been advancing rapidly, and the present production is the\r\nheaviest in the history of the country. The industry has practically\r\ngrown up in the last seventy years, the exports for the decade 1852-53\r\nto 1861-62 averaging only about 940,000 pounds; in the decade following,\r\nabout 5,700,000 pounds; and, in the ten years from 1872-73 to 1881-82,\r\nabout 12,600,000 pounds, according to an unofficial compilation.\r\nExportations had advanced to about 47,000,000 pounds by 1895; and to\r\n80,000,000 pounds by 1906. As large quantities of Colombian coffee are\r\nshipped out through Venezuela, and because of the lack of detailed\r\nstatistics in Colombia, the actual exportation each year is not easy to\r\ndetermine; but the following figures, obtained by a trade commissioner\r\nof the United States, may be taken as a fairly accurate estimate of\r\nexports from 1906 to 1918:\r\n\r\nCOLUMBIAN COFFEE EXPORTS\r\n_Year_    _Sacks (138 lbs.)_\r\n\r\n 1906               605,705\r\n 1907               541,300\r\n 1908               577,900\r\n 1909               673,350\r\n 1910               543,000\r\n 1911               601,600\r\n 1912               888,800\r\n 1913               972,000\r\n 1914               983,000\r\n 1915             1,074,600\r\n 1916             1,153,000\r\n 1917             1,093,000\r\n 1918             1,102,000\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 3--BRAZIL'S COFFEE EXPORTS, 1850-1920\r\n\r\nDiagram based on 5-year averages with quantities given in millions of\r\npounds]\r\n\r\nECUADOR. Annual production in Ecuador runs from 3,000,000 to 8,000,000\r\npounds, most of which is exported. The greater part of the production is\r\nsent to Chile and the United States. Production has shown only a gradual\r\nincrease since the middle of the nineteenth century, when planters began\r\nto give some attention to coffee cultivation. Exports were about 87,000\r\npounds in 1855; 296,000 pounds in 1870; and 985,000 pounds in 1877. By\r\nthe beginning of the present century, production had reached 6,204,000\r\npounds; in 1905, it was estimated at 4,861,000 pounds; and in 1910, at\r\n8,682,000 pounds. Exports in 1912 were 6,101,700 pounds; and 7,671,000\r\npounds in 1918; but there was a falling off to 3,729,000 pounds in 1919.\r\nSeveral years ago it was estimated that the coffee trees numbered\r\n8,000,000, planted on 32,000 acres.\r\n\r\nPERU. Coffee is one of the minor products of Peru, and the country does\r\nnot occupy a place of importance in the international coffee trade. The\r\nlarger part of the production is apparently consumed in the country\r\nitself. Export figures indicate that the industry is steadily declining.\r\nExports amounted to 2,267,000 pounds in 1905; to 1,618,000 pounds in\r\n1908; and in the five years ending with 1918, exports averaged only\r\n529,000 pounds; while figures for 1919 show that in that year they fell\r\nstill lower, to 370,000 pounds. Production is mainly in the coast lands.\r\n\r\nBRITISH GUIANA. The Guianas are the site of the first coffee planting on\r\nthe continent of South America; and according to some accounts, the\r\nfirst in the New World. The plants were brought first into Dutch Guiana,\r\nbut there was no planting in what is now British Guiana (then a Dutch\r\ncolony) until 1752. Twenty-six years later, 6,041,000 pounds were sent\r\nto Amsterdam from the two ports of Demarara and Berbice; and after the\r\ncolony fell into the hands of the English in 1796, cultivation continued\r\nto increase. Exports amounted to 10,845,000 pounds in 1803; and to more\r\nthan 22,000,000 pounds in 1810. Then there was a falling off, and the\r\nproduction in 1828 was 8,893,500 pounds and 3,308,000 pounds in 1836. In\r\n1849 British Guiana exported only 109,600 pounds. For a long period\r\nthereafter there was little production, and practically no exportation;\r\nexports in 1907, for instance, amounting to only 160 pounds. With the\r\nnext year, however, a revival of exportation began, and it has continued\r\nto grow since then. In 1908, exports were 88,700 pounds; and for the\r\nsucceeding years, up to 1917, the following amounts are recorded: 1909,\r\n96,952 pounds; 1910, 108,378 pounds; 1911, 136,420 pounds; 1912, 144,845\r\npounds; 1913, 89,376 pounds; 1914, 238,767 pounds; 1915, 172,326 pounds;\r\n1916, 501,183 pounds; 1917, 267,344 pounds. In the last-named year 4,953\r\nacres were in coffee plantations.\r\n\r\nFRENCH GUIANA. This colony raises a small amount of coffee for local\r\nconsumption, and exports a few hundred pounds; but it is really an\r\nimporting and not an exporting colony. Coffee cultivation was never of\r\nmuch importance, although in 1775 some 72,000 pounds were exported. One\r\nhundred and eighty thousand pounds were harvested in 1860; and 132,000\r\npounds in 1870, mostly for local consumption.\r\n\r\nDUTCH GUIANA. Regular shipments of coffee from Dutch Guiana have been\r\nmade for two centuries, beginning--a few years after the plant was\r\nintroduced--with a shipment of 6,461 pounds to the mother country in\r\n1723. Seven years later, 472,000 pounds were shipped; and in 1732-33\r\nexportation reached 1,232,000 pounds. Exports were averaging 16,900,000\r\npounds a year by 1760; and reached almost 20,600,000 pounds in 1777. At\r\nthe beginning of the nineteenth century, they amounted to about\r\n17,000,000 pounds; but a few years later fell off to some 7,000,000\r\npounds, where they remained until about 1840; after which they began\r\nagain to decline. Exportation had practically ceased by 1875, only 1,420\r\npounds going out of the country, although cultivation still continued,\r\nas evidenced by a production of 82,357 pounds in that year. In 1890,\r\nproduction was only 15,736 pounds, and exports only 476 pounds; but\r\nsince then there has been a considerable increase. In 1900, production\r\namounted to 433,000 pounds, and exports to 424,000 pounds. In 1908,\r\n1,108,000 pounds were grown, of which 310,000 pounds were sent abroad;\r\nand in 1909, the figures were 552,000 pounds produced and 405,000 pounds\r\nexported. No figures are available for production in recent years; but\r\nthe exportation of 1,600,000 pounds in 1917 indicates that plantings\r\nhave been steadily growing.\r\n\r\nOTHER SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRIES. Of the other South American countries,\r\nArgentina, Chile, and Uruguay are coffee-importing countries; and the\r\ncoffee-raising industry of Paraguay, although more or less promising,\r\nhas yet to be developed. In Argentina, a few hundred acres in the\r\nsub-tropical provinces of the north have been planted to coffee; but\r\ncoffee-growing will always necessarily remain a very minor industry.\r\nMany attempts have been made to establish the industry in Paraguay,\r\nwhere favorable conditions obtain, but only a few planters have met with\r\nsuccess. Their product has all been consumed locally. Bolivia has much\r\nland suitable for coffee raising; and it is estimated that production\r\nhas reached as high as 1,500,000 pounds a year, but transportation\r\nconditions are such as to hold back development for an indefinite time.\r\nSmall amounts are now exported to Chile.\r\n\r\nSALVADOR. Coffee was introduced into Salvador in 1852, and immediately\r\nbegan to spread over the country. Exports were valued at more than\r\n$100,000 in 1865; and by 1874-75 the amount exported had reached\r\n8,500,000 pounds. The first large plantation was established in 1876;\r\nand since then planting has continued, until now practically all the\r\navailable coffee land has been taken up. The area in plantations has\r\nbeen estimated at 166,000 acres, and the annual production at 50,000,000\r\nto 75,000,000 pounds, of which some 5,000,000 pounds are consumed in the\r\ncountry. Since the beginning of the present century, exports have in\r\ngeneral shown a considerable increase, the figures for 1901 being\r\n50,101,000 pounds; for 1905, 64,480,000 pounds; for 1910, 62,764,000\r\npounds; for 1915, 67,130,000 pounds; and for 1920, 82,864,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nGUATEMALA. Cultivation of coffee in Guatamala became of importance\r\nbetween 1860 and 1870. In 1860, exports were only about 140,000 pounds;\r\nby 1863, they had increased to about 1,800,000 pounds; and by 1870, to\r\n7,590,000 pounds. In 1880-81, they amounted to 28,976,000 pounds; and in\r\n1883-84, to 40,406,000 pounds. Twenty years later, they had doubled. In\r\nrecent years, exports have ranged between 75,000,000 and 100,000,000\r\npounds; the years from 1909 to 1918 showing the following results,\r\naccording to a consular report:\r\n\r\nGUATEMALA'S COFFEE EXPORTS\r\n\r\n               _Cleaned_ _Unshelled_\r\n_Year_       (pounds)       (pounds)\r\n\r\n 1900            92,639,800     23,654,600\r\n 1910            50,717,600     19,671,700\r\n 1911            60,689,500     20,959,500\r\n 1912            14,329,800     60,837,500\r\n 1913            70,749,100     20,980,700\r\n 1914            71,136,800     14,999,600\r\n 1915            69,649,500      9,892,000\r\n 1916            85,057,000      3,015,800\r\n 1917            89,259,600      1,410,200\r\n 1918            77,842,800        511,500\r\n\r\nCOSTA RICA. Coffee raising in Costa Rica dates from 1779, when the plant\r\nwas introduced from Cuba. By 1845, the industry had grown sufficiently\r\nto permit an exportation of 7,823,000 pounds; and twenty years later,\r\n11,143,000 pounds were shipped. Thereafter, production increased\r\nrapidly; so that in 1874, the total exports were 32,670,000 pounds, and\r\nin 1884 they were more than 36,000,000 pounds. In recent years, the\r\naverage production has been around 35,000,000 pounds. For the crop years\r\n1916-17 to 1920-21 exports have been:\r\n\r\nCOSTA RICA'S COFFEE EXPORTS\r\n\r\n  _Year_             _Pounds_\r\n\r\n  1916-17           27,044,550\r\n  1917-18           25,246,715\r\n  1918-19           30,784,184\r\n  1919-20           30,860,634\r\n  1920-21           29,401,683\r\n\r\nNICARAGUA. Production of coffee in Nicaragua began between 1860 and\r\n1870; and in 1875, the yield was estimated at 1,650,000 pounds. By\r\n1879-80, this had increased to 3,579,000 pounds; and by 1889-90, to\r\n8,533,000 pounds. In 1890-91 production was 11,540,000 pounds; and in\r\n1907-08 it was estimated at more than 20,000,000 pounds. Ten years\r\nlater, 25,000,000 pounds were produced; and the crop of 1918-19 was\r\nestimated at about 30,000,000 pounds. Lack of transportation, and excess\r\nof political troubles, have been important factors in holding back\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nHONDURAS. The coffee of Honduras is of very good quality; but production\r\nis small, and the country is not an important factor in international\r\ntrade. Exports usually run less than 1,000,000 pounds. The chief\r\nobstacle to expansion is said to be lack of transportation facilities.\r\n\r\nBRITISH HONDURAS. This colony grows a little coffee for its own use, but\r\nimports most of what it needs. Production had reached almost 50,000\r\npounds in 1904; but the present average is only about 10,000 pounds,\r\nraised on scattering trees over about 1,000 acres.\r\n\r\nPANAMA. A small amount of coffee, of which occasionally as much as\r\n200,000 or 250,000 pounds a year are exported, is raised in the uplands\r\nof Panama, or is gathered from wild trees. The industry is not of great\r\nimportance, and the country imports considerable supplies, mostly from\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nMEXICO. A very good grade of coffee is produced in Mexico; and it is\r\nsaid that there is sufficient area of good coffee land to take care of\r\nthe demand of the world outside of that supplied by Brazil. Production,\r\nhowever, is limited, and to a large extent goes to satisfy home needs,\r\nleaving only about 50,000,000 pounds for export. In spite of much\r\ngovernment encouragement in past years, coffee cultivation has not made\r\nrapid progress, when we remember that the country became acquainted with\r\nthe plant as early as 1790. Not until about 1870 did the country begin\r\nto become important in the list of coffee-exporters; but by 1878-79,\r\nshipments amounted to about 12,000,000 pounds. This steadily increased\r\nto 29,400,000 pounds in 1891-92. Exports in recent years have averaged\r\nabout 50,000,000 pounds; but in 1918 were only 30,000,000. Production\r\nhas fluctuated greatly. In the years preceding the troubled\r\nrevolutionary period, the total output was estimated as follows: 1907,\r\n45,000,000 pounds; 1908, 42,000,000 pounds; 1909, 81,000,000 pounds;\r\n1910, 70,000,000 pounds. In the ten years preceding 1907, production\r\ndropped as low as 22,000,000 pounds in 1902; and rose to 88,500,000\r\npounds in 1905. Next to the United States, Germany was the chief buyer\r\nof Mexican coffee before the war; although France and Great Britain also\r\ntook several million pounds each.\r\n\r\nHAITI. For well over a century Haiti has been shipping tens of millions\r\nof pounds of coffee annually; and the product is the mainstay of the\r\ncountry's economic life. In all that time, however, shipments have\r\nmaintained much the same level. The country has been a coffee producer\r\nfrom the early years of the eighteenth century, when the plants began to\r\nspread from the original sprigs in Guiana or Martinique. After half a\r\ncentury of growth, exports had risen to 88,360,000 pounds in 1789-90, a\r\nmark that has never again been reached. Since then, exports have ranged\r\nbetween 40,000,000 and 80,000,000 pounds, keeping close to the lower\r\nmark in recent years because of European conditions. They were\r\n38,000,000 pounds in 1856; 55,750,000 pounds in 1866; and 52,300,000\r\npounds in 1876. They had reached 84,028,000 pounds in 1887-88; but fell\r\nback to 67,437,000 pounds in 1897-98; and ten years later, were\r\n63,848,000 pounds. In 1917-18, they were only about two-thirds that\r\namount, or 42,100,000 pounds. Some 8,000,000 pounds are consumed yearly\r\nin the country itself. The coffee plantations cover about 125,000 acres.\r\n\r\nDOMINICAN REPUBLIC. Coffee production in the Dominican Republic ranges\r\nbetween 1,000,000 and 5,000,000 pounds, exports in recent years\r\naveraging about 3,500,000 pounds. The quality of the coffee is good; but\r\nthe plantations are not well cared for. Until fifty years ago, the\r\nindustry was in a state of decline from a condition of former\r\nimportance; but it was revived, and by 1881 it supplied 1,400,000 pounds\r\nfor export. The amount was 1,480,000 pounds in 1888; 3,950,000 pounds in\r\n1900; 1,540,000 pounds in 1909; and 4,870,000 pounds in 1919. Blight,\r\nand disturbed political conditions, have hampered development. In normal\r\ntimes, Europe takes most of the export.\r\n\r\nJAMAICA. Jamaica began to raise coffee about 1730; and from that time on\r\nthere was a steady but slow increase in production. Shipments amounted\r\nto about 60,000 pounds in 1752, and to about 1,800,000 pounds in 1775.\r\nAt the beginning of the new century, in 1804, exports of 22,000,000\r\npounds are recorded; and in 1814 the figure was 34,045,000 pounds. Then\r\nexports gradually fell off, and in 1861 were only 6,700,000 pounds. They\r\nwere 10,350,000 pounds in 1874; and since then, have not varied much\r\nfrom 9,000,000 or 10,000,000 pounds a year. They were 9,363,000 pounds\r\nin 1900; 7,885,000 pounds in 1909; and 8,246,000 pounds in 1919. The\r\nacreage in coffee remains fairly constant, being 24,865 in 1900; 22,275\r\nin 1911; and 20,280 in 1917. It is said that there are 80,000 acres of\r\ngood coffee land still uncultivated.\r\n\r\nPORTO RICO. The cultivation of coffee in Porto Rico dates back to the\r\nmiddle of the eighteenth century; but exportation does not seem to have\r\nbeen much more than a million pounds a year until the first years of the\r\nnineteenth century. Between 1837 and 1840, the average exportation was\r\nabout 10,000,000 pounds; and by 1865, this had risen to 24,000,000\r\npounds. Ten years later, it was 25,700,000 pounds. In recent years, it\r\nhas averaged about 37,000,000 pounds; the 1921 figure, including\r\nshipments to continental United States, being 29,968,000 pounds.\r\nProduction since 1881 has been between 30,000,000 and 50,000,000 pounds;\r\nthe heaviest being in 1896 when the total output was 62,628,337\r\npounds--the largest figure in the island's history. The industry was\r\ngreatly damaged by a disastrous storm in 1900, and was also adversely\r\naffected by the European War, as a large part of Porto Rico's crop goes\r\nto Europe. Porto Rican coffee has not been popular in the United States,\r\nwhich takes only limited amounts. Cuba is one of the island's best\r\ncustomers.\r\n\r\nGUADELOUPE. Coffee production in Guadeloupe reached its highest point in\r\nthe latter part of the eighteenth century, when more than 8,000,000\r\npounds were raised. The figure was about 6,000,000 in 1808; but the\r\noutput declined during the succeeding decades, and forty years later was\r\nonly 375,000 pounds. The amount produced in 1885 was 986,000 pounds;\r\nand there has been a gradual increase, so that the crop has been large\r\nenough to permit the exportation of 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 pounds, or\r\nmore, since the beginning of the present century. Exports in 1901 were\r\n1,449,000 pounds; in 1908, 2,266,000 pounds; and in 1918, 2,144,000\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nOTHER WEST INDIAN ISLANDS. Some little coffee is gathered for home\r\nconsumption in many other West Indian islands, but little is exported.\r\nThe island of Martinique, which is said to have seen the introduction of\r\nthe coffee plant into the western hemisphere, does not now raise enough\r\nfor its own use. Cuba was formerly one of the important centers of\r\nproduction; but for various reasons the industry declined, and for many\r\nyears the country has imported most of its coffee supply. A century ago,\r\nthe plantations numbered 2,067; and the annual exportation amounted to\r\n50,000,000 pounds. When the island became independent, steps were taken\r\nto revive coffee planting; and in 1907 there were 1,411 plantations and\r\n3,662,850 trees, producing 6,595,700 pounds of coffee. The Cubans,\r\nhowever, now find it convenient to obtain their coffee from the\r\nneighboring island of Porto Rico and from other sources; and\r\nimportations have remained around 20,000,000 pounds a year. In Trinidad\r\nand Tobago, exports have reached as high as 1,000,000 pounds a year; but\r\nin recent times they have fallen off heavily. St. Vincent exported 485\r\npounds in 1917, and Grenada, 251 pounds in 1916. The Leeward Islands\r\nexported 1,415 pounds in 1917, and 2,946 pounds in 1916, the acreage\r\nbeing 274, the same as for many years past.\r\n\r\nARABIA. The home of the famous Mocha coffee still produces considerable\r\nquantities of that variety, although the output, comparatively speaking,\r\nis not large. The chief district is the vilayet of Yemen; and the\r\nproduct reaches the outside world mainly through the port of Aden,\r\nalthough before the war much of this coffee was exported through\r\nHodeida. The port of Massowah, in the last two or three years, has been\r\ndrawing some of the supply of Mocha for export. No statistics are\r\navailable to show the production of Mocha coffee; but an estimate made\r\nby the oldest coffee merchant in Aden places the average annual output\r\nat 45,000 bags of 176 pounds each, or 7,920,000 pounds. Although this is\r\nthe only district in the world that can produce the particular grade of\r\ncoffee known as Mocha, there is little systematic cultivation, and large\r\nareas of good coffee land are planted to other crops to provide food for\r\nthe natives. When transportation facilities are provided, so that this\r\nfood can be imported, it is predicted that the output of Mocha coffee\r\nwill be doubled.\r\n\r\nAden is a great transhipping port for coffee from Asia and Africa, and\r\nmore than half its exports are re-exports from points outside of Arabia.\r\nThe following figures will show the proportion of Arabian coffee coming\r\ninto Aden for export as compared with that from other producing\r\nsections:\r\n\r\nADEN'S COFFEE RECEIPTS FOR RE-EXPORT\r\n\r\n   _Imports_            1916-17    1917-18    1918-19\r\n    _from_             (pounds)   (pounds)   (pounds)\r\n\r\nAbyssinia (via Jibuti) 4,529,280  6,174,896  4,337,760\r\nMocha and Ghizan       3,555,104  6,562,752  3,075,024\r\nSomaliland (British)     394,128    396,592    245,840\r\nStraits Settlements      672,224\r\nZanzibar and Pemba        92,512    795,312    764,288\r\nAll other countries      162,064    307,104    323,616\r\n                       --------- ----------  ---------\r\nTotal                  9,405,312 14,236,656  8,746,528\r\n\r\nBRITISH INDIA. Cultivation of coffee was begun systematically in India\r\nin 1840; and twenty years later, the country exported about 5,860,000\r\npounds. For the next eight years the exports remained at about that\r\nfigure; but in 1859 they amounted to 11,690,000 pounds; and by 1864 they\r\nhad doubled, rising in that year to 26,745,000 pounds. They have\r\ncontinued at between 20,000,000 and 60,000,000 pounds ever since,\r\nreaching their highest point in 1872 with 56,817,000 pounds. In recent\r\nyears, production and exportation have declined; the exports in 1920\r\nbeing only 30,526,832 pounds. The area under coffee has been between\r\n200,000 and 300,000 acres for fifty years or more, reaching its highest\r\npoint in 1896, with 303,944 acres. Recently the area has been slowly\r\ndecreasing.\r\n\r\nCEYLON. The island of Ceylon was formerly one of the important producers\r\nof coffee; and the industry was a flourishing one until about 1869, when\r\na disease appeared that in ten or fifteen years practically ruined the\r\nplantations. Production has gone on since then, but at a steadily\r\ndeclining rate. In late years, the island has not produced enough for\r\nits own use, and is now ranked as an importer rather than as an\r\nexporter. It is said that systematic cultivation was carried on in\r\nCeylon by the Dutch as early as 1690; and shipments of 10,000 to 90,000\r\npounds a year were made all through the eighteenth century, exports in\r\none year, 1741, going as high as 370,000 pounds. The English took the\r\nisland in 1795, and thirty years later, they began to expand\r\ncultivation. Exports had risen to 12,400,000 pounds in 1836; and they\r\ncontinued to increase to a high point of 118,160,000 pounds in 1870; but\r\nin the next thirty years they declined, until they were only 1,147,000\r\npounds in 1900. The total acreage in coffee at one time reached as high\r\nas 340,000; but as the coffee trees were affected by the leaf disease,\r\nthis land was turned to tea; and in 1917 there were only 810 acres left\r\nin coffee.\r\n\r\nDUTCH EAST INDIES. The year 1699 saw the importation from the Malabar\r\ncoast of India to Java of the coffee plants which were destined to be\r\nthe progenitors of the tens of millions of trees that have made the\r\nDutch East Indies famous for two hundred years. Twelve years afterward,\r\nthe first trickle of the stream of coffee that has continued to flow\r\never since found its way from Java to Holland, in a shipment of 894\r\npounds. About 216,000 pounds were exported in 1721; and soon thereafter,\r\nshipments rose into the millions of pounds.\r\n\r\nFrom 1721 to 1730 the Netherlands East India Co. marketed 25,048,000\r\npounds of Java coffee in Holland; and in the decade following,\r\n36,845,000 pounds. Shipments from Java continued at about the latter\r\nrate until the close of the century, although in the ten years 1771-80\r\nthey reached a total of 51,319,000 pounds. The total sales of Java\r\ncoffee in Holland for the century were somewhat more than a quarter of a\r\nbillion pounds, which represented pretty closely the amount produced.\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of the nineteenth century, coffee production soon\r\nbecame much heavier; and in 1825 Java exported, of her own production,\r\nsome 36,500,000 pounds, besides 1,360,000 pounds brought from\r\nneighboring islands to which the cultivation had spread. In 1855, the\r\namount was 168,100,000 pounds of Java coffee, and 4,080,000 pounds of\r\ncoffee from the other islands. This is the highest record for the\r\nhalf-century following the beginning of the regular reports of exports\r\nin 1825. From 1875 to 1879 the average annual yield was 152,184,000\r\npounds. In 1900, production in Java was 84,184,000 pounds; in 1910, it\r\nwas 31,552,000 pounds, and in 1915 it had jumped to 73,984,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nOn the west coast of Sumatra coffee was regularly cultivated, according\r\nto one account, as early as 1783; but it was not until about 1800, that\r\nexportation began, with about 270,000 pounds. By 1840, exports were\r\naveraging 11,000,000 to 12,250,000 pounds per year. Official records of\r\nproduction date from 1852, in which year the figures were 16,714,000\r\npounds. Five years later the recorded yield was 25,960,000 pounds, the\r\nhigh-water mark of Sumatra production. The total output in 1860 was\r\n21,400,000 pounds; and 22,275,000 pounds in 1870. The average from 1875\r\nto 1879 was 17,408,000 pounds; and from 1895 to 1899, it was 7,589,000\r\npounds. The yield was 5,576,000 pounds in 1900; 1,360,000 in 1910; and\r\n7,752,000 in 1915.\r\n\r\nIn Celebes, the first plants were set out about 1750; but seventy years\r\nlater production was only some 10,000 pounds. This soon increased to\r\nhalf a million pounds; and from 1835 to 1852 the yield ran between\r\n340,000 and 1,768,000 pounds. From 1875 to 1879, production averaged\r\n2,176,000 pounds; from 1885 to 1889, 2,747,000 pounds; and from 1895 to\r\n1899, 707,000 pounds. In 1900, it was 680,000 pounds; in 1910, 272,000\r\npounds; and in 1915, 272,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nPlanting under government control, largely with forced labor, has been\r\nthe special feature of coffee cultivation in the Dutch East Indies. At\r\nfirst the government exercised what was practically a monopoly; but\r\nprivate planting was more and more permitted; and in the latter part of\r\nthe nineteenth century, the amount of coffee produced on private\r\nplantations exceeded that raised by the government. The government has\r\nnow entirely given up the business of coffee production.\r\n\r\nThe total production of coffee in Java, Sumatra, and Celebes, in 1920,\r\nin piculs of 136 pounds, was as follows:\r\n\r\nDUTCH EAST INDIES' COFFEE PRODUCTION\r\n\r\n_Kind of_           _Quantity Produced in_\r\n_Coffee_           Java   Sumatra  Celebes   Total\r\n                                   and Bali\r\n                (piculs) (piculs) (piculs) (piculs)\r\nLiberica          14,972    6,243    2,074   23,289\r\nJava              16,312   24,291   70,621  111,224\r\nRobusta          411,235  256,645    4,998  672,878\r\n                 -------  -------   ------  -------\r\nTotal            442,519  287,179   77,693  807,391\r\n\r\nSTRAITS SETTLEMENTS. Trade in coffee is a transhipping trade, Singapore\r\nacting as a clearing center for large quantities of coffee from the\r\nneighboring islands. In 1920, the imports were 25,914,267 pounds; and\r\nthe exports, 26,856,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nFEDERATED MALAY STATES. The acreage in coffee in the Federated Malay\r\nStates is steadily declining. In 1903, coffee plantations covered 22,700\r\nacres; in 1913, 7,695 acres; and in 1916, 4,312 acres. There was\r\nformerly a considerable export; but apparently local production is now\r\nrequired for home consumption, as in 1920 exports were practically\r\nnothing, and about 9,800 pounds were imported.\r\n\r\nBRITISH NORTH BORNEO. Total exports of coffee have reached as high as\r\n50,000 pounds, which was the figure in 1904; but they are much less now;\r\nbeing 5,973 pounds in 1915; 15,109 pounds in 1916; and 1,980 pounds in\r\n1918.\r\n\r\nSARAWAK. Previous to 1912, the exportation of coffee from Sarawak, was\r\n20,000 to 45,000 pounds annually. In 1912, a coffee estate of 300 acres\r\nwas abandoned, and since that time there have been no exports.\r\n\r\nPHILIPPINES. Coffee raising was formerly one of the chief industries of\r\nthe Philippines; but it has now greatly declined, partly because of the\r\nblight. Exports reached their highest point in 1883, when 16,805,000\r\npounds were shipped. Since then, they have fallen off steadily to\r\nnothing; and the islands are now importers, although still producing\r\nconsiderable for their own use. The area still under cultivation in 1920\r\nwas 2,700 acres; and the production in that year was given as 2,710,000\r\npounds, as compared with 1,580,000 pounds in 1919, and an average of\r\n1,500,000 pounds for the previous five years.\r\n\r\nGUAM. Coffee is a common plant on the island but is not systematically\r\ncultivated. There is no exportation, but a Navy Department report says\r\nthat the possible export is not less than seventy-five tons annually.\r\n\r\nHAWAII. A certain amount of coffee has been produced in the Hawaiian\r\nIslands for many years, exports being recorded as 49,000 pounds in 1861;\r\nas 452,000 pounds in 1870; and as 143,000 pounds in 1877. The trees grow\r\non all the islands; but nearly all the coffee produced is raised on\r\nHawaii. The trees are not carefully cultivated; but the coffee has an\r\nexcellent flavor. The amount of land planted to coffee is about 6,000\r\nacres. The exports go mostly to continental United States. The exports\r\nare increasing, the figures up to 1909 ranging usually between 1,000,000\r\nand 2,000,000 pounds, and now usually running between 2,000,000 and\r\n5,000,000 pounds. Including shipments to continental United States,\r\nHawaii exported 5,775,825 pounds in 1918; 3,649,672 pounds in 1919;\r\n2,573,300 pounds in 1920; and 4,979,121 pounds in 1921.\r\n\r\nAUSTRALIA. Queensland is the only state of the Commonwealth in which\r\ncoffee growing has been at all extensively tried; and here the results\r\nhave, up to the present time, been far from satisfactory. The total area\r\ndevoted to this crop reached its highest point in the season 1901-02\r\nwhen an area of 547 acres was recorded. The area then continuously\r\ndeclined to 1906-07, when it was as low as 256 acres. In subsequent\r\nseasons the area fluctuated somewhat; but, on the whole, with a downward\r\ntendency. In 1919-20, only 24 productive acres were recorded, with a\r\nyield of 16,101 pounds. The country is now listed among the consuming\r\nrather than the producing countries.\r\n\r\nABYSSINIA. This country, usually credited with being the original home\r\nof the coffee plant, still has, in its southern part, vast forests of\r\nwild coffee whose extent is unknown, but whose total production is\r\nbelieved to be immense. It is of inferior grade, and reaches the market\r\nas \"Abyssinian\" coffee. There is also a large district of coffee\r\nplantations producing a very good grade called \"Harari\", which is\r\nconsidered almost, if not quite, the equal of the Arabian Mocha. This is\r\nusually shipped to Aden for re-export. Abyssinia's coffee reaches the\r\noutside world through three different gateways; and as the neighboring\r\ncountries, through which the produce passes, also produce coffee, no\r\naccurate statistics are available to show the country's annual export.\r\nThe total probably ranges from 10,000,000 to 20,000,000 pounds a year.\r\nCoffee was shipped from Abyssinia to the extent of 6,773,800 pounds in\r\n1914, over the Franco-Ethiopian railroad; 10,054,000 pounds in 1915; and\r\n9,064,000 pounds in 1916. Export figures of the port of Massowah include\r\na large amount of Abyssinian coffee, but the proportion is unknown. At\r\nthis port 108,680 pounds of coffee were exported in 1914; and 1,221,880\r\npounds in 1915. Abyssinian coffee exported by way of the Sudan amounted\r\nto 232,616 pounds in 1914; to 140,461 pounds in 1915; and to 4,164,600\r\npounds in 1916.\r\n\r\nBRITISH EAST AFRICAN PROTECTORATE. The acreage in coffee has greatly\r\nincreased in recent years. It was estimated at 1,000 acres in 1911; and\r\nby 1916, it had grown to 22,200 acres. Production, as shown by the\r\nexports, has likewise increased greatly; and exports in recent years\r\nhave averaged about 8,000,000 pounds a year. They were 10,984,000 pounds\r\nin 1917; and were 18,735,000 pounds in 1918.\r\n\r\nUGANDA PROTECTORATE. The acreage in coffee has been steadily increasing,\r\nas shown by the following figures: 1910, 697 acres; 1914, 19,278 acres;\r\n1916, 23,857 acres; 1917, 22,745 acres. In 1909, 33,440 pounds of coffee\r\nwere produced; and by 1918, this had grown to 10,000,000 pounds. The\r\naverage for the five years, 1914-18, was 5,076,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nNYASALAND PROTECTORATE. Twenty-five years ago, this colony exported\r\ncoffee in amounts ranging from 300,000 to more than 2,000,000 pounds.\r\nProduction has now so declined, that only 122,000 pounds were exported\r\nin 1918; and the average for recent years has been about 92,000 pounds.\r\nThe acreage in bearing in 1903 was 8,234; and in 1917 it was 1,237.\r\n\r\nNIGERIA. Production has been falling off in recent years. Exports were\r\n35,000 pounds in 1896; 57,000 pounds in 1901; and 70,000 pounds in 1909.\r\nIn 1916 and 1917, however, they were only about 3,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nGOLD COAST. This colony formerly produced considerable coffee, exporting\r\n142,000 pounds in 1896. There have been no exports in recent years,\r\nexcept about 440 pounds in 1916, and 660 pounds in 1917.\r\n\r\nSOMALILAND PROTECTORATE. Exports of coffee were more than 7,500,000\r\npounds in 1897, indicating a very extensive production. But since then,\r\nthere has been a steady decline; and in 1918 only about 440,000 pounds\r\nwere shipped.\r\n\r\nSOMALI COAST (FRENCH). Exports of coffee from this colony amounted to\r\nmore than 5,000,000 pounds in 1902; and since then, they have remained\r\nfairly steadily at that figure, showing considerable increase in late\r\nyears. Total exports in 1917 were 11,200,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nITALIAN SOMALILAND. Some coffee appears to be grown in this colony; but\r\nexports have been inconsiderable for many years.\r\n\r\nSIERRA LEONE. Production has been steadily declining for twenty years.\r\nExports were 33,376 pounds in 1903; 17,096 pounds in 1913; and 8,228\r\npounds in 1917.\r\n\r\nMAURITIUS. In former times this island was an important coffee producer,\r\nexports in the early part of the nineteenth century running as high as\r\n600,000 pounds. Today there is practically no export, and only about 30\r\nacres are in bearing, producing 4,000 to 8,000 pounds a year.\r\n\r\nRÉUNION. This island also was once a notable grower of coffee. A century\r\nago, production was estimated as high as 10,000,000 pounds; and this\r\nrate of output continued well through the nineteenth century. In the\r\npresent century, production has fallen off; and only about 530,000\r\npounds were exported in 1909. The decrease has continued, so that the\r\naverage in recent years has been only about 25,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Consumption_\r\n\r\nOf the million or more tons of coffee produced in the world each year,\r\npractically all--with the exception of that which is used in the\r\ncoffee-growing countries themselves--is consumed by the United States\r\nand western Europe, the British dominions, and the non-producing\r\ncountries of South America. Over that vast stretch of territory\r\nbeginning with western Russia, and extending over almost the whole of\r\nAsia, coffee is very little known. In the consuming regions mentioned,\r\nmoreover, consumption is concentrated in a few countries, which together\r\naccount for some ninety percent of all the coffee that enters the\r\nworld's markets. These are, the United States, which now takes more than\r\none-half, and Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Holland, Belgium,\r\nSwitzerland, and Scandinavia.\r\n\r\nThe United Kingdom stands out conspicuously among the nations of western\r\nEurope as a small consumer of coffee, the per capita consumption in that\r\ncountry being only about two-thirds of a pound each year. France and\r\nGermany are by far the biggest coffee buyers of Europe so far as actual\r\nquantity is concerned; although some of the other countries mentioned\r\ndrink much more coffee in proportion to the population. The\r\nMediterranean countries and the Balkans are of only secondary\r\nimportance as coffee drinkers. Among the British dominions, the Union of\r\nSouth Africa takes much the largest amount, doubtless because of the\r\nDutch element in its population; while Canada, Australia, and New\r\nZealand show the influence of the mother country, consumption per head\r\nin the last two being no greater than in England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 4--WORLD'S COFFEE CONSUMPTION, 1850-1920\r\n\r\nDiagram showing the relationship between the leading coffee-consuming\r\ncountries]\r\n\r\nIn South America, Brazil, Bolivia, and all the countries to the north,\r\nare coffee producers. Of the southern countries, Argentina is the chief\r\ncoffee buyer, with Chile second. In the western hemisphere, however, the\r\nlargest per capita coffee consumer is the island of Cuba, which raises\r\nsome coffee of its own and imports heavily from its neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe list of coffee-consuming countries includes practically all those\r\nthat do not raise coffee, and also a few that have some coffee\r\nplantations, but do not grow enough for their own use. These countries\r\nare listed on page 287. Consumption figures can be determined with fair\r\naccuracy by the import figures; although in some countries, where there\r\nis a considerable transit trade, it is necessary to deduct export from\r\nimport figures to obtain actual consumption figures. The import figures\r\ngiven are the latest available for each country named.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 5--COFFEE IMPORTS, 1916-1920\r\n\r\nIn this diagram a comparison is drawn between the coffee imports of the\r\nleading consuming countries over a critical 5-year period]\r\n\r\nGENERAL COFFEE CONSUMPTION TABLE\r\n\r\n_Country_          _Year_    _Imports_       _Exports_   _Consumption_\r\n                               (pounds)       (pounds)        (pounds)\r\n\r\nUnited States      1921[j] 1,345,366,943[k] 41,813,197[k] 1,303,553,746\r\nCanada             1921[l]    17,517,353        20,349       17,497,004\r\nNewfoundland       1920[l]        46,813[m]                      46,813\r\nUnited Kingdom     1921[j]    34,363,728[m]                  34,360,128\r\nFrance             1921[j]   322,419,884     1,154,769      321,265,115\r\nSpain              1920       48,518,854         5,033       48,513,821\r\nPortugal           1919[j]     6,926,575     1,258,271        5,668,304\r\nBelgium            1921[j]   105,365,586    21,541,049       83,824,537\r\nHolland            1921[j]   135,566,943    66,567,702       69,999,241\r\nDenmark            1921[j]    46,571,954     3,449,537       43,122,417\r\nNorway             1921[j]    29,835,544       169,921       29,665,623\r\nSweden             1921[j]    89,660,766                     89,660,766\r\nFinland            1921[j]    27,968,355                     27,968,355\r\nRussia             1916        9,801,014                      9,801,014\r\nAustria-Hungary    1917       17,966,167        56,217       17,909,950\r\n   (former)\r\nAustria            1921[n]     5,128,781        79,365        5,049,416\r\nGermany (former)   1913      371,130,520     1,783,521      369,346,999\r\nGermany (present)  1921[o]   167,675,258       210,535      167,464,723\r\nPoland             1920        7,612,526        26,781        7,585,745\r\nBulgaria           1914        1,300,493                      1,300,493\r\nRumania            1919        5,134,198        66,757        5,067,441\r\nGreece             1920[p]    13,118,626                     13,118,626\r\nSwitzerland        1921[j]    31,582,879        47,619       31,535,260\r\nItaly              1920       66,509,255        14,330       66,494,925\r\nAlgeria            1920       17,273,041                     17,273,041\r\nTunis              1920        3,458,018                      3,458,018\r\nEgypt              1921[j]    20,939,542       218,938       20,720,604\r\nUnion of S.

For the most part, however, the trade has about swung back to\r\nnormal; and per capita figures based on the amounts retained for\r\nconsumption, as given in the General Coffee Consumption Table, are\r\nfairly close to those for the years before the war. As per capita\r\ncalculations must take into account population as well as amounts of\r\ncoffee consumed; and as population figures are usually estimates, the\r\nresults arrived at by different authorities are likely to vary slightly,\r\nalthough usually they are not far apart. In figuring the per capita\r\namounts in the table on page 288, latest available estimates of\r\npopulation have been used.

S_.\r\n\r\nThe rise of the United States as a coffee consumer in the last century\r\nand a quarter has been marked, not only by steadily increased imports as\r\nthe population of the country increased, but also by a steady growth in\r\nper capita consumption, showing that the beverage has been continually\r\nadvancing in favor with the American people. Today it stands at\r\npractically its highest point, each individual man, woman, and child\r\nhaving more than 12 pounds a year, enough for almost 500 cups, allotted\r\nto him as his portion. This is four times as much as it was a hundred\r\nyears ago; and more than twice as much as it was in the years\r\nimmediately following the Civil War. In general it is fifty percent more\r\nthan the average in the twenty years preceding 1897, in which year a new\r\nhigh level of coffee consumption was apparently established, the per\r\ncapita figure for that year being 10.12 pounds, which has been\r\napproximately the average since then.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 6--WORLD'S CONSUMPTION OF TEA AND COFFEE\r\n\r\nDiagram showing their relationship, 1860-1920]\r\n\r\nSince the advent of country-wide prohibition in the United States on\r\nJuly 1, 1919, about two pounds more coffee per person, or 80 to 100\r\ncups, have been consumed than before. Part of this increase is doubtless\r\nto be charged to prohibition; but it is yet too early to judge fairly as\r\nto the exact effect of \"bone-dry\" legislation on coffee drinking. The\r\ncontinued growth in the use of coffee in the United States has been in\r\ndecided contrast to the per capita consumption of tea, which is less now\r\nthan half a century ago.\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom, the reverse condition prevails. Tea drinking\r\nthere steadily maintains a popularity which it has enjoyed for\r\ncenturies; while coffee apparently makes no advance in favor. In this\r\nrespect, the country is sharply distinguished from its neighbors of\r\nwestern Europe, in many of which coffee drinking has been much heavier,\r\nconsidering the population, even than in the United States. The contrast\r\nbetween the tastes of the two countries in beverages is shown clearly by\r\nthe per capita figures of tea and coffee consumption for half a century,\r\nas they appear in the table, next column.\r\n\r\nTEA AND COFFEE CONSUMPTION PER CAPITA\r\n\r\n_Year  United States  United Kingdom_\r\n        Coffee   Tea     Coffee  Tea\r\n        pounds pounds    pounds pounds\r\n 1866    4.96  1.17       1.02  3.42\r\n 1867    5.01  1.09       1.04  3.68\r\n 1868    6.52   .96       1.00  3.52\r\n 1869    6.45  1.08        .94  3.63\r\n 1870    6.00  1.10        .98  3.81\r\n 1871    7.91  1.14        .97  3.92\r\n 1872    7.28  1.46        .98  4.01\r\n 1873    6.87  1.53        .99  4.11\r\n 1874    6.59  1.27        .96  4.23\r\n 1875    7.08  1.44        .98  4.44\r\n 1876    7.33  1.35        .99  4.50\r\n 1877    6.94  1.23        .96  4.52\r\n 1878    6.24  1.33        .97  4.66\r\n 1879    7.42  1.21        .99  4.68\r\n 1880    8.78  1.39        .92  4.57\r\n 1881    8.25  1.54        .89  4.58\r\n 1882    8.30  1.47        .89  4.69\r\n 1883    8.91  1.30        .89  4.82\r\n 1884    9.26  1.09        .90  4.90\r\n 1885    9.60  1.18        .91  5.06\r\n 1886    9.36  1.37        .87  4.92\r\n 1887    8.53  1.49        .80  5.02\r\n 1888    6.81  1.49        .83  5.03\r\n 1889    9.16  1.25        .76  4.99\r\n 1890    7.77  1.32        .75  5.17\r\n 1891    7.94  1.28        .76  5.36\r\n 1892    9.59  1.36        .74  5.43\r\n 1893    8.23  1.32        .69  5.40\r\n 1894    8.01  1.34        .68  5.51\r\n 1895    9.24  1.39        .70  5.65\r\n 1896    8.08  1.32        .69  5.75\r\n 1897   10.04  1.56        .68  5.79\r\n 1898   11.59   .93        .68  5.83\r\n 1899   10.72   .97        .71  5.95\r\n 1900    9.84  1.09        .71  6.07\r\n 1901   10.43  1.12        .76  6.16\r\n 1902   13.32   .92        .68  6.07\r\n 1903   10.80  1.27        .71  6.04\r\n 1904   11.67  1.31        .68  6.02\r\n 1905   11.98  1.19        .67  6.02\r\n 1906    9.72  1.06        .66  6.22\r\n 1907   11.15   .96        .67  6.26\r\n 1908    9.82  1.03        .66  6.24\r\n 1909   11.43  1.24        .67  6.37\r\n 1910    9.33   .89        .65  6.39\r\n 1911    9.29  1.05        .62  6.47\r\n 1912    9.26  1.04        .61  6.49\r\n 1913    8.90   .96        .61  6.68\r\n 1914   10.14   .91        .63  6.89\r\n 1915   10.62   .91        .71  6.87\r\n 1916   11.20  1.07        .66  6.56\r\n 1917   12.38   .99       1.02  6.03\r\n 1918   10.43  1.40       1.19  6.75\r\n 1919    9.13   .87        .76  8.43\r\n 1920   12.78   .84        .74  8.51\r\n\r\nFigures for all except most recent years are taken\r\nfrom the _Statistical Abstract_ publications of\r\nthe two countries.

The leading continental\r\ncoffee ports are Hamburg, Bremen, Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Rotterdam,\r\nAntwerp, Havre, Bordeaux, Marseilles, and Trieste; and the nationalities\r\nof these ports indicate pretty well the countries that consume the most\r\ncoffee. The northern ports are transhipping points for large quantities\r\nof coffee going to the Scandinavian countries, as well as importing\r\nports for their own countries; and these countries have been among the\r\nleading coffee drinkers, per head of population, for many decades.\r\nNorway, for instance, in 1876 was consuming about 8.8 pounds of coffee\r\nper person; Sweden, 5 pounds; and Denmark, 5.2 pounds. The per capita\r\nconsumption of various other countries at about the same period, 1875 to\r\n1880, has been estimated as follows: Holland, 17.6 pounds; Belgium, 9.1\r\npounds; Germany, 5.1 pounds; Austria-Hungary, 2.2 pounds; Switzerland,\r\n6.6 pounds; Prance, 3 pounds; Spain, 0.2 pounds; Portugal, 0.7 pounds;\r\nand Greece, 1.6 pounds.\r\n\r\nToday, the leading country of the world in point of per capita\r\nconsumption is Sweden (15.25 pounds); but Holland held that position for\r\na long while. During the World War the disturbance of trade currents,\r\nand the high price of coffee, greatly reduced the amount of coffee\r\ndrinking; and the Dutch took to drinking tea in considerable\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nFRANCE. Second only to the United States, in the total amount of coffee\r\nconsumed, is France; although that country before the war occupied third\r\nplace, being passed by Germany. Havre is one of the great coffee ports\r\nof Europe; and has a coffee exchange organized in 1882, only a short\r\ntime after the Exchange in New York began operations. France draws on\r\nall the large producing regions for her coffee; but is especially\r\nprominent in the trade in the West Indies and the countries around the\r\nCaribbean Sea. Imports in 1921 (preliminary) amounted to 322,419,884\r\npounds; exports to 1,154,769 pounds; and net consumption, to 321,265,115\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nGERMANY. Hamburg is one of the world's important coffee ports; and in\r\nnormal times coffee is brought there in vast amounts, not only for\r\nshipment into the interior of Germany, but also for transhipment to\r\nScandinavia, Finland and Russia. Up to the outbreak of the war, Germany\r\nwas the chief coffee-drinking country of Europe. During the blockade,\r\nthe Germans resorted to substitutes; and after the war because of high\r\nprices, there was still some consumption of them. German coffee imports\r\nsince the war have not quite climbed back to their former high mark; and\r\nthe per capita consumption, judged by these figures is still somewhat\r\nlow. Importations amounted to 90,602,000 pounds in 1920. The amount of\r\ntotal imports was 371,130,520 pounds in 1913; total exports, 1,783,521\r\npounds; and net imports, 369,346,999 pounds.\r\n\r\nNETHERLANDS. Netherlands is one of the oldest coffee countries of\r\nEurope, and for centuries has been a great transhipping agent,\r\ndistributing coffee from her East Indian possessions and from America\r\namong her northern neighbors. Before sending these coffee shipments\r\nalong, however, she kept back enough plentifully to supply her own\r\npeople, so that for many years before the war she led the world in per\r\ncapita consumption. As far back as 1867-76, coffee consumption was\r\naveraging more than 13 pounds per capita. In the year before the war,\r\nthe average was 18.8 pounds. The blockade, and other abnormal conditions\r\nduring the war, threw the trade off; and it is still sub-normal. In 1920\r\nthe net imports were about 96,000,000 pounds, which would give a per\r\ncapita consumption of about 14 pounds if it all went into consumption.\r\nBut part of it was probably stored for later exportation, as indicated\r\nby the figures for 1921, which show heavy exports and a consequent lower\r\nfigure for consumption. Eighty percent of the Netherlands coffee trade\r\nis handled through Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nConsumption of coffee is now slowly going back to normal, but the change\r\nin source of imports--which before the war came largely from Brazil but\r\nwhich war conditions turned heavily toward the East Indies--is still in\r\nevidence. Per capita consumption of coffee in Holland up to the outbreak\r\nof the war was as follows:\r\n\r\nCOFFEE CONSUMPTION PER CAPITA IN HOLLAND\r\n\r\n_Year       Pounds  Year   Pounds_\r\n1847-56      9.6   1907    14.9\r\n1857-66      7.1   1908    14.3\r\n1867-76     13.3   1909    16.7\r\n1877-86     16.7   1910    15.7\r\n1887-96     12.8   1911    15.8\r\n1897-1906   16.7   1912    12.3\r\n1906        17.2   1913    18.8\r\n\r\nOTHER COUNTRIES OF EUROPE. Denmark, Norway, and Sweden are all heavy\r\ncoffee drinkers. In 1921 Sweden had the highest per capita consumption\r\nin the world, 15.25 pounds. Before the war, these three countries each\r\nconsumed about as much per capita as the United States does today, 12 to\r\n13 pounds. The 1921 imports for consumption[317] were as follows:\r\nDenmark, 43,122,417 pounds; Norway, 29,665,623 pounds; Sweden,\r\n89,660,766 pounds. Austria-Hungary was formerly an important buyer of\r\ncoffee, large quantities coming into the country yearly through Trieste.\r\nImports in 1913 totaled 130,951,000 pounds; and in 1912, 124,527,000\r\npounds. In 1917 the war cut down the total to 17,910,000 pounds net\r\nconsumption. Finland shares with her neighbors of the Baltic a strong\r\ntaste for coffee, importing, in 1921, 27,968,000 pounds, about 8.25\r\npounds per capita. In the same year, Belgium had a net importation of\r\n83,824,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nSpain, in 1920, consumed 48,513,821 pounds. Portugal, in 1919, imported\r\n6,926,575 pounds; and exported 1,258,271 pounds, leaving 5,668,304\r\npounds for home consumption. Coffee is not especially popular in the\r\nBalkan States and Italy; importations into the last-named country in\r\n1920 amounting to 66,494,925 pounds net. Switzerland is a steady coffee\r\ndrinker, consuming 31,535,260 pounds in 1921. Russia was never fond of\r\ncoffee; and her total imports in 1917, according to a compilation made\r\nunder Soviet auspices, were only 4,464,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MEETING OF THE COFFEE BROKERS OF AMSTERDAM, 1820\r\n\r\nReproduced from an old print]\r\n\r\nOTHER COUNTRIES. The Union of South Africa, in 1920, imported 27,798,000\r\npounds net, or about 3.8 pounds per capita. Cuba purchased 39,981,696\r\npounds in the fiscal year 1920; Argentina, 37,541,000 pounds in 1919;\r\nChile, 12,358,000 pounds in 1920; Australia, 2,239,000 pounds in 1920;\r\nand New Zealand, 283,633 pounds in that year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Three Centuries of Coffee Trading_\r\n\r\nThe story of the development of the world's coffee trade is a story of\r\nabout three centuries. When Columbus sailed for the new world, the\r\ncoffee plant was unknown even as near its original home as his native\r\nItaly. In its probable birthplace in southern Abyssinia, the natives had\r\nenjoyed its use for a long time, and it had spread to southwestern\r\nArabia; but the Mediterranean knew nothing of it until after the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century. It then crept slowly along the coast\r\nof Asia Minor, through Syria, Damascus, and Aleppo, until it reached\r\nConstantinople about 1554. It became very popular; coffee houses were\r\nopened, and the first of many controversies arose. But coffee made its\r\nway against all opposition, and soon was firmly established in Turkish\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nIn those deliberate times, the next step westward, from Asia to Europe,\r\nwas not taken for more than fifty years. In general, its introduction\r\nand establishment in Europe occupied the whole of the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe greatest pioneering work in coffee trading was done by the\r\nNetherlands East India Company, which began operations in 1602. The\r\nenterprise not only promoted the spread of coffee growing in two\r\nhemispheres; but it was active also in introducing the sale of the\r\nproduct in many European countries.\r\n\r\nCoffee reached Venice about 1615, and Marseilles about 1644. The French\r\nbegan importing coffee in commercial quantities in 1660. The Dutch began\r\nto import Mocha coffee regularly at Amsterdam in 1663; and by 1679 the\r\nFrench had developed a considerable trade in the berry between the\r\nLevant and the cities of Lyons and Marseilles. Meanwhile, the coffee\r\ndrink had become fashionable in Paris, partly through its use by the\r\nTurkish ambassador, and the first Parisian _café_ was opened in 1672. It\r\nis significant of its steady popularity since then that the name _café_,\r\nwhich is both French and Spanish for coffee, has come to mean a general\r\neating or drinking place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BILL OF PUBLIC SALE OF COFFEE, ETC., 1790\r\n\r\nReproduction of an advertisement by the Dutch East India Company]\r\n\r\nActive trading in coffee began in Germany about 1670, and in Sweden\r\nabout 1674.\r\n\r\nTrading in coffee in England followed swiftly upon the heels of the\r\nopening of the first coffee house in London in 1652. By 1700, the trade\r\nincluded not only exporting and importing merchants, but wholesale and\r\nretail dealers; the latter succeeding the apothecaries who, up to then,\r\nhad enjoyed a kind of monopoly of the business.\r\n\r\nTrade and literary authorities[318] on coffee trading tell us that in\r\nthe early days of the eighteenth century the chief supplies of coffee\r\nfor England and western Europe came from the East Indies and Arabia. The\r\nArabian, or--as it was more generally known--Turkey berry, was bought\r\nfirst-hand by Turkish merchants, who were accustomed to travel inland in\r\nArabia Felix, and to contract with native growers.\r\n\r\nIt was moved thence by camel transport through Judea to Grand Cairo,\r\n_via_ Suez, to be transhipped down the Nile to Alexandria, then the\r\ngreat shipping port for Asia and Europe. By 1722, 60,000 to 70,000 bales\r\nof Turkish (Arabian) coffee a year were being received in England, the\r\nsale price at Grand Cairo being fixed by the Bashaw, who \"valorized\" it\r\naccording to the supply. \"Indian\" coffee, which was also grown in\r\nArabia, was brought to Bettelfukere (Beit-el-fakih) in the mountains of\r\nsouthwestern Arabia, where English, Dutch, and French factors went to\r\nbuy it and to transport it on camels to Moco (Mocha), whence it was\r\nshipped to Europe around the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, \"Indian\" coffee was inferior to Turkish coffee;\r\nbecause it was the refuse, or what remained after the Turkish merchants\r\nhad taken the best. But after the European merchants began to make their\r\nown purchases at Bettelfukere, the character of the \"Indian\" product as\r\nsold in the London and other European markets was vastly improved.\r\nDoubtless the long journey in sailing vessels over tropic seas made for\r\nbetter quality. It was estimated that Arabia in this way exported about\r\na million bushels a year of \"Turkish\" and \"Indian\" coffee.\r\n\r\nThe coffee houses became the gathering places for wits, fashionable\r\npeople, and brilliant and scholarly men, to whom they afforded\r\nopportunity for endless gossip and discussion. It was only natural that\r\nthe lively interchange of ideas at these public clubs should generate\r\nliberal and radical opinions, and that the constituted authorities\r\nshould look askance at them. Indeed the consumption of coffee has been\r\ncuriously associated with movements of political protest in its whole\r\nhistory, at least up to the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nCoffee has promoted clear thinking and right living wherever introduced.\r\nIt has gone hand in hand with the world's onward march toward democracy.\r\n\r\nAs already told in this work, royal orders closed the coffee houses for\r\nshort periods in Constantinople and in London; Germany required a\r\nlicense for the sale of the beverage; the French Revolution was fomented\r\nin coffee-house meetings; and the real cradle of American liberty is\r\nsaid to have been a coffee house in New York. It is interesting also to\r\nnote that, while the consumption of coffee has been attended by these\r\nagitations for greater liberty for three centuries, its production for\r\nthree centuries, in the Dutch East Indies, in the West Indies, and in\r\nBrazil, was very largely in the hands of slaves or of forced labor.\r\n\r\nSince the spread of the use of coffee to western Europe in the\r\nseventeenth century, the development of the trade has been marked,\r\nbroadly speaking, by two features: (1) the shifting of the weight of\r\nproduction, first to the West Indies, then to the East Indies, and then\r\nto Brazil; and (2) the rise of the United States as the chief coffee\r\nconsumer of the world. Until the close of the seventeenth century, the\r\nlittle district in Arabia, whence the coffee beans had first made their\r\nway to Europe, continued to supply the whole world's trade. But sprigs\r\nof coffee trees were beginning to go out from Arabia to other promising\r\nlands, both eastward and westward. As previously related, the year 1699\r\nwas an important one in the history of this expansion, as it was then\r\nthat the Dutch successfully introduced the coffee plant from Arabia into\r\nJava. This started a Far Eastern industry, whose importance continues to\r\nthis day, and also caused the mother country, Holland, to take up the\r\nrôle of one of the leading coffee traders of the world, which she still\r\nholds. Holland, in fact, took to coffee from the very first. It is\r\nclaimed that the first samples were introduced into that country from\r\nMocha in 1616--long before the beans were known in England or\r\nFrance--and that by 1663, regular shipments were being made. Soon after\r\nthe coffee culture became firmly established in Java, regular shipments\r\nto the mother country began, the first of these being a consignment of\r\n894 pounds in 1711. Under the auspices of the Netherlands East India Co.\r\nthe system of cultivating coffee by forced labor was begun in the East\r\nIndian colonies. It flourished until well into the nineteenth century.\r\nOne result of this colonial production of coffee was to make Holland the\r\nleading coffee consumer per capita of the world, consumption in 1913, as\r\nrecorded on page 290, having reached as high as 18.8 pounds. It has long\r\nbeen one of the leading coffee traders, importing and exporting in\r\nnormal times before the war between 150,000,000 and 300,000,000 pounds a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRE-WAR AVERAGE ANNUAL PRODUCTION OF COFFEE BY CONTINENTS\r\n\r\nFiscal years: 1910-1914\r\n\r\nTotal pounds: 2,311,917,200]\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the coffee plant into the new world took place\r\nbetween 1715 and 1723. It quickly spread to the islands and the mainland\r\nwashed by the Caribbean. The latter part of the eighteenth century saw\r\ntens of millions of pounds of coffee being shipped yearly to the mother\r\ncountries of western Europe; and for decades, the two great coffee trade\r\ncurrents of the world continued to run from the West Indies to France,\r\nEngland, Holland, and Germany; and from the Dutch East Indies to\r\nHolland. These currents continued to flow until the disruption of world\r\ntrade-routes by the World War; but they had been pushed into positions\r\nof secondary importance by the establishing of two new currents, running\r\nrespectively from Brazil to Europe, and from Brazil to the United\r\nStates, which constituted the nineteenth century's contribution to the\r\nhistory of the world's coffee trade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRE-WAR AVERAGE ANNUAL PRODUCTION OF COFFEE BY COUNTRIES\r\n\r\nFiscal years: 1910-1914\r\n\r\nTotal pounds: 2,311,917,200]\r\n\r\nThe chief feature of the twentieth century's developments has been the\r\npassing by the United States of the half-way mark in world consumption;\r\nthis country, since the second year of the World War, having taken more\r\nthan all the rest of the world put together. The world's chief coffee\r\n\"stream,\" so to speak, is now from Santos and Rio de Janeiro to New\r\nYork, other lesser streams being from these ports to Havre, Antwerp,\r\nAmsterdam, and (in normal times) Hamburg; and from Java to Amsterdam and\r\nRotterdam. It is said that a movement, fostered by Belgium and Brazil,\r\nis under way to have Antwerp succeed Hamburg as a coffee port.\r\n\r\nThe rise of Brazil to the place of all-important source of the world's\r\ncoffee was entirely a nineteenth century development. When the coffee\r\ntree found its true home in southern Brazil in 1770, it began at once to\r\nspread widely over the area of excellent soil; but there was little\r\nexportation for thirty or forty years. By the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury Brazil was contributing twice as much to the world's commerce as\r\nher nearest competitor, the Dutch East Indies, exports in 1852-53 being\r\n2,353,563 bags from Brazil and 1,190,543 bags from the Dutch East\r\nIndies. The world's total that year was 4,567,000 bags, so that\r\nBrazilian coffee represented about one-half of the total. This\r\nproportion was roughly maintained during the latter half of the\r\nnineteenth century, but has gradually increased since then to its\r\npresent three-fourths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRE-WAR AVERAGE ANNUAL IMPORTS OF COFFEE INTO THE UNITED\r\nSTATES BY CONTINENTS\r\n\r\nFiscal years: 1910-1914\r\n\r\nTotal pounds: 899,339,327]\r\n\r\nThe most important single event in the history of Brazilian production\r\nwas the carrying out of the valorization scheme, by which the State of\r\nSão Paulo, in 1906 and 1907, purchased 8,474,623 bags of coffee, and\r\nstored it in Santos, in New York, and in certain European ports, in\r\norder to stabilize the price in the face of very heavy production. At\r\nthe same time, a law was passed limiting the exports to 10,000,000 bags\r\nper year. This law has since been repealed. The story of valorization is\r\ntold more fully in chapter XXXI. The coffee thus purchased by the state\r\nwas placed in the hands of an international committee, which fed it into\r\nthe world's markets at the rate of several hundred thousand bags a year.\r\nGood prices were realized for all coffee sold; and the plan was\r\nsuccessful, not only financially, but in the achievement of its main\r\nobject, the prevention of the ruin of planters through overproduction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRE-WAR AVERAGE ANNUAL IMPORTS OF COFFEE INTO THE UNITED\r\nSTATES BY COUNTRIES\r\n\r\nFiscal years: 1910-1914\r\n\r\nTotal pounds: 899,339,327]\r\n\r\nAnother valorization campaign was launched by Brazil in 1918, and a\r\nthird in 1921. Early in 1918, the São Paulo government bought about\r\n3,000,000 bags. Subsequent events caused a sharp advance in prices, and\r\nat one time it was said that the holdings showed a profit of\r\n$60,000,000. The Brazil federal government appointed an official\r\ndirector of valorization, Count Alexandre Siciliano. A federal loan of\r\n£9,000,000, with 4,535,000 bags of valorized coffee as collateral, was\r\nplaced in London and New York in May, 1922.\r\n\r\nEuropean consumption during the last century has been marked by the\r\ngrowth of imports into France and Germany; these being the two leading\r\ncoffee drinkers of the world, aside from the United States. Germany held\r\nthe lead in European consumption during the whole of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, and also in this century until all imports were stopped by the\r\nAllied navies; although, in actual imports, Holland for many years\r\nshowed higher figures. Both Holland and England have acted as\r\ndistributers, re-exporting each year most of the coffee which entered\r\ntheir ports. In the last half-century, the chief consumers, in the order\r\nnamed, have been Germany, France, Holland, Austria-Hungary, and Belgium.\r\nHowever, with the removal of the duty on coffee in the last-named\r\ncountry in 1904, imports trebled; and Belgium took third place. The\r\ntable at the top of this page shows the general trend of the trade for\r\nthe last seventy years.\r\n\r\nTREND OF EUROPEAN COFFEE CONSUMPTION FOR SEVENTY YEARS\r\n\r\n_Year_    _Germany_     _France_     _Holland_   _Aus.-Hung._  _Belgium_\r\n           (pounds)     (pounds)      (pounds)     (pounds)     (pounds)\r\n1853      104,049,000   48,095,000   46,162,000   44,716,000   41,270,000\r\n1863      146,969,000   87,524,000   30,299,000   44,966,000   39,305,000\r\n1873      215,822,000   98,841,000   79,562,000   71,111,000   49,874,000\r\n1883      251,706,000  150,468,000  130,380,000   74,145,000   62,846,000\r\n1893      269,381,000  152,203,000   75,562,000   79,438,000   52,046,000\r\n1903      403,070,000  246,122,000   78,328,000  104,200,000   51,859,000\r\n1913      369,347,000  254,102,000  116,749,000  130,951,000   93,250,000\r\n\r\nMost of the coffee for these countries has for many years been supplied\r\nby Brazil, even Holland bringing in several times as much from Brazil as\r\nfrom the Dutch East Indies. Special features of the European trade have\r\nbeen the organization, in 1873, and successful operation, in Germany, of\r\nthe world's first international syndicate to control the coffee trade;\r\nand the opening of coffee exchanges in Havre in 1882, in Amsterdam and\r\nHamburg, in 1887: in Antwerp, London, and Rotterdam, in 1890; and in\r\nTrieste in 1905.\r\n\r\nThe advance of coffee consumption in the United States, the chief\r\ncoffee-consuming country in the world, has taken place through about the\r\nsame period as the advance of production in Brazil, the chief producing\r\ncountry; but it has been far less rapid. From 1790 to 1800, coffee\r\nimports for consumption ranged from 3,500,000 to 32,000,000 pounds. The\r\nfigures in the next column show the net importations of coffee into this\r\ncountry since the beginning of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe chief source of supply, of course, has been Brazil; and the\r\ncommercial and economic ties created by this immense coffee traffic has\r\nknit the two countries closely together. Brazil is probably more\r\nfriendly to the United States than any other South American country, as\r\nshown by her action in following this country into the World War against\r\nGermany. She also grants the United States certain tariff preferentials\r\nas a recognition of the continued policy of this country of admitting\r\ncoffee free of duty. The chief port of entry of coffee into the United\r\nStates is New York, which for decades has recorded entries amounting\r\nfrom sixty to ninety percent of the country's total. Since 1902, New\r\nOrleans has shown a big advance, and in 1910 imported some thirty-five\r\npercent of the total. The only other port of importance is San\r\nFrancisco, where imports have been increasing in recent years because of\r\nthe growth of the trade in Central American coffee.\r\n\r\nCOFFEE IMPORTS, UNITED STATES, FOR 120 YEARS\r\n                 _Net Imports_\r\n\r\nYear          Pounds       Year        Pounds\r\n1800[x]      8,792,472     1906     804,808,594\r\n1811[x]     19,801,230     1907     935,678,412\r\n1821[x]     11,886,063     1908     850,982,919\r\n1830[x]     38,363,687     1909   1,006,975,047\r\n1840[x]     86,297,761     1910     813,442,972\r\n1850       129,791,466     1911     869,489,902\r\n1860       182,049,527     1912     880,838,776\r\n1870       231,173,574     1913     859,166,618\r\n1880       440,128,838     1914     991,953,821\r\n1890       490,161,900     1915   1,051,716,023\r\n1900       748,800,771     1916   1,131,730,672\r\n1901       809,036,029     1917   1,267,975,290\r\n1902     1,056,541,637     1918   1,083,480,622\r\n1903       867,385,063     1919     968,297,668\r\n1904       960,878,977     1920   1,364,252,073\r\n1905       991,160,207     1921   1,309,010,452\r\n\r\n[x] Fiscal year ending Sept. 30; all other years end June 30.\r\n\r\nThroughout the century and a third of steady increase of importations of\r\ncoffee, Congress has for the most part permitted its free entry; as a\r\nrule, resorting to taxation of \"the poor man's breakfast cup\" only when\r\nin need of revenue for war purposes. At times, the free entry has been\r\nqualified; but for the most part, coffee has been free from the burden\r\nof customs tariff.\r\n\r\nThe country's coffee trade before the Civil War was without special\r\nincident; but since that time, the continued growth has brought about\r\nmanipulations that have often resulted in highly dramatic crises;\r\norganizations to exercise some sort of regulation in the trade; the\r\ndevelopment of a trade in substitutes; the advance of the sale of\r\nbranded package coffee; the institution of large advertising campaigns;\r\nand other interesting features. These are treated more in detail in\r\nchapters that follow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRE-WAR CHART OF COFFEE IMPORTS\r\n\r\nQuantity and value of net imports of coffee into the United States for\r\nthe fiscal years 1851 to 1914 in five-year averages.

Of course there are sporadic increases, in\r\nparticular years and groups of years, and they may indicate to the\r\ncasual observer that our coffee drinking is mounting rapidly. And then\r\nthere is the steadily growing import figure, double what it was within\r\nthe memory of a man still young.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRE-WAR CONSUMPTION AND PRICE CHART\r\n\r\nImport price and per capita consumption of coffee in the United States\r\nfor the fiscal years 1851 to 1914, in five-year averages. Solid line\r\nrepresents import price per pound. Dotted line represents per capita\r\nconsumption]\r\n\r\nBut the apparent growth in any given year is a matter of comparison with\r\na nearby year, and there are declines as well as jumps; and, as for the\r\ngradual growth, it must always be remembered that, according to the\r\nCensus Bureau, some 1,400,000 more people are born into this country\r\nevery year, or enter its ports, than are removed by death or emigration.\r\nAt the present rate this increase would account for about 17,000,000\r\npounds more coffee each year than was consumed in the year before.\r\n\r\nThe question is: Do Mr. Citizen, or Mrs. Citizen, or the little Citizens\r\ngrowing up into the coffee-drinking age, pass his or her or their\r\nrespective cups along for a second pouring where they used to be\r\nsatisfied with one, or do they take a cup in the evening as well as in\r\nthe morning, or do they perhaps have it served to them at an afternoon\r\nreception where they used to get something else? In other words, is the\r\ncoffee habit becoming more intensive as well as more extensive?\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of very good reasons why it should have become so in\r\nthe last twenty-five or thirty years; for the improvements in\r\ndistributing, packing, and preparing coffee have been many and notable.\r\nIt is a far cry these days from the times when the housewife snatched a\r\ncouple of minutes amid a hundred other kitchen duties to set a pan over\r\nthe fire to roast a handful of green coffee beans, and then took two or\r\nthree more minutes to pound or grind the crudely roasted product into\r\ncoarse granules for boiling.\r\n\r\nFor a good many years, the keenest wits of the coffee merchants, not\r\nonly of the United States but of Europe as well, have been at work to\r\nrefine the beverage as it comes to the consumer's cup; and their success\r\nhas been striking. Now the consumer can have his favorite brand not only\r\nroasted but packed air-tight to preserve its flavor; and made up,\r\nmoreover, of growths brought from the four corners of the earth and\r\nblended to suit the most exacting taste. He can buy it already ground,\r\nor he can have it in the form of a soluble powder; he can even get it\r\nwith the caffein element ninety-nine percent removed. It is preserved\r\nfor his use in paper or tin or fiber boxes, with wrappings whose\r\nattractive designs seem to add something in themselves to the quality.\r\nInstead of the old coffee pot, black with long service, he has modern\r\nshining percolators and filtration devices; with a new one coming out\r\nevery little while, to challenge even these. Last but not least, he is\r\nbeing educated to make it properly--tuition free.\r\n\r\nIt would be surprising, with these and dozens of other refinements, if a\r\nfar better average cup of coffee were not produced than was served forty\r\nyears ago, and if the coffee drinker did not show his appreciation by\r\ncoming back for more.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the figures show that he does come back for more.\r\nWe do not refer to the figures of the last two years, which indeed are\r\nhigher than those for many preceding years, but to the only averages\r\nthat are of much significance in this connection; namely, those for\r\nperiods of years going back half a century or more. Five-year averages\r\nback to the Civil War show increasing per capita consumption for\r\ncontinental United States (see table).\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION FIGURES\r\n\r\n_Five-year  Per capita  Five-year  Per capita\r\n  Period     Pounds     Period     Pounds_\r\n\r\n1867-71       6.38     1897-1901    10.52\r\n1872-76       7.03     1902-06      11.50\r\n1877-81       7.53     1907-11      10.21\r\n1882-86       9.09     1912-16      10.02\r\n1887-91       8.07     1917-21      11.39\r\n1892-96       8.63\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the gain has been a decided one, fairly steady, but\r\nnot exactly uniform. In the fifty years, John Doe has not quite come to\r\nthe point where he hands up his cup for a second helping and keeps a\r\nmeaningful silence. Instead, he stipulates, \"Don't fill it quite full;\r\nfill it about five-sixths as full as it was before.\" That is a\r\nsubstantial gain, and one that the next fifty years can hardly be\r\nexpected to duplicate, in spite of the efforts of our coffee\r\nadvertisers, our inventors, and our vigorous importers and roasters.\r\n\r\nThe most striking feature of this fifty-year growth was the big step\r\nupward in 1897, when the per capita rose two pounds over the year before\r\nand established an average that has been pretty well maintained since.\r\nSomething of the sort may have taken place again in 1920, when there was\r\na three-pound jump over the year before. It will be interesting to see\r\nwhether this is merely a jump or a permanent rise; whether our coffee\r\ntrade has climbed to a hilltop or a plateau.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it should be noted that the government's per capita\r\ncoffee figures apply only to continental United States, and that in\r\ncomputing them all the various items of trade of the non-contiguous\r\npossessions (not counting the Philippines, whose statistics are kept\r\nentirely separate from those of the United States proper) are carefully\r\ntaken into account.\r\n\r\nBut for the benefit of students of coffee figures it should be added\r\nthat this method does not result in a final figure except for one year\r\nin ten. The reason is that between censuses the population of the\r\ncountry is determined only by estimates; and these estimates (by the\r\nU.S. Bureau of the Census) are based on the average increase in the\r\npreceding census decade. The increase between 1910 and 1920, for\r\ninstance, is divided by 120, the number of months in the period, and\r\nthis average monthly increase is assumed to be the same as that of the\r\ncurrent year and of other years following 1920. Until new figures are\r\nobtained in 1930, the monthly increase will continue to be estimated at\r\nthe same rate as the increase from 1910 to 1920, or about 118,000. This\r\nfigure will be used in computing the per capita coffee consumption. But\r\nwhen the 1930 figures are in, it may be found that the estimates were\r\ntoo low or too high, and the per capita figures for all intervening\r\nyears will accordingly be subject to revision. This will not amount to\r\nmuch, probably five-hundredths of a pound at most; but it is evident\r\nthat between 1920 and 1930 all per capita consumption figures issued by\r\nthe government are to be considered as provisional to that extent at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nIn the 1920 _Statistical Abstract_ the government has revised its per\r\ncapita coffee and tea figures to conform to actual instead of estimated\r\npopulation figures between 1910 and 1920, with the result that these\r\nfigures are slightly different from those published in previous editions\r\nof the _Abstract_. Figures from 1890 to 1910 have also been slightly\r\nchanged, as they were originally computed by using population figures as\r\nof June 1, whereas it is desirable to have computations based on July 1\r\nestimates to make them conform to present per capita figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reviewing the 1921 Trade in the United States_\r\n\r\nAccording to the latest available foreign trade summaries issued by the\r\ngovernment, the United States bought more coffee in 1921 than in any\r\nprevious calendar year of our history, although the total imports did\r\nnot quite reach the highest fiscal-year mark. Our purchases passed the\r\n1920 mark by more than 40,000,000 pounds and were higher than those of\r\ntwo years ago by 3,500,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nBut this record was made only in actual amounts shipped, as the value of\r\nimported coffee was far below that of immediately preceding years.\r\nCoffee values, however, fell off less than the average values for all\r\nimports, the decrease for coffee being forty-three percent and for the\r\ncountry's total imports fifty-two percent.\r\n\r\nExports of coffee were somewhat less in quantity than in 1920, and about\r\nthe same as in 1919; although the value, like that of imports, was\r\nconsiderably less than in either previous year.\r\n\r\nRe-exports of foreign coffee were considerably below the 1920 mark, in\r\nboth quantity and value, and indeed were less than in several years. The\r\namount of tea re-exported to foreign countries was only about half that\r\nshipped out in 1920, showing a continuation of the tendency of the\r\nUnited States to discontinue its services as a middleman, which raised\r\nthe through traffic in tea several million pounds during the dislocation\r\nof shipping.\r\n\r\nActual figures of amounts and values of gross coffee imports for the\r\nthree calendar years, 1919-1921, have been as follows:\r\n\r\n            _Pounds_            _Value_\r\n1921      1,340,979,776       $142,808,719\r\n1920      1,297,439,310        252,450,651\r\n1919      1,337,564,067        261,270,106\r\n\r\nThis represents a gain of three and three-tenths percent over 1920 in\r\nquantity and of only about one-fifth of one percent over 1919. The\r\ndecrease in value in 1921 was forty-three percent from the figures for\r\n1920 and forty-five percent from those of 1919.\r\n\r\nDomestic exports of coffee, mostly from Hawaii and Porto Rico, amounted\r\nto 34,572,967 pounds valued at $5,895,606, as compared with 36,757,443\r\npounds valued at $9,803,574 in the calendar year 1920, or a decrease of\r\nsix percent in quantity and forty percent in value. In 1919 domestic\r\nexports were 34,351,554 pounds, having a value of $8,816,581,\r\npractically the same in quantity, but showing a falling off of\r\nthirty-three percent in value.\r\n\r\nRe-exports of foreign coffee amounted to 36,804,684 pounds in 1921,\r\nhaving a value of $3,911,847, a decline of twenty-five percent from the\r\n49,144,691 pounds of 1920 and of fifty-four percent from the 81,129,691\r\npounds of 1919; whereas in point of value there was a decrease of\r\nfifty-six percent from 1920, which was $9,037,882, and of eighty-eight\r\npercent from that of 1919, which was $16,815,468.\r\n\r\nThe average value per pound of the imported coffee, according to these\r\nfigures, works out at little more than half that of either 1920 or 1919,\r\nillustrating the precipitate drop of prices when the depression came on.\r\nThe pound value in 1921 was 10.6c.; for 1920, 19.4c.; and for 1919,\r\n19.5c. These values are derived from the valuations placed on shipments\r\nat the point of export, the \"foreign valuation\" for which the much\r\ndiscussed \"American valuation\" is proposed as a substitute. They\r\naccordingly do not take into account costs of freight, insurance, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the average valuation of 10.6c. a pound\r\nfor coffee shipped during the calendar year is a substantial drop from\r\nthe 13.12c. a pound that was the average for the fiscal year 1921,\r\nshowing that the decline in values continued during the last half of the\r\ncalendar year.\r\n\r\nCoffee imports in 1921 continued to run in about the same well-worn\r\nchannels as in previous years, according to the figures showing the\r\ntrade with the producing countries. The United States, as heretofore,\r\ndrew almost its whole supply from its neighbors on this side of the\r\nglobe; the countries to the south furnishing ninety-seven percent of the\r\ntotal entering our ports. The three chief countries of South America\r\ncontributed eighty-five percent; and the share of Brazil alone was\r\nsixty-two and five-tenths percent.\r\n\r\nBrazil's progress to her normal pre-war position in our coffee trade is\r\nrather slow, although she continues to show a gain in percentage each\r\nyear. Formerly we obtained seventy percent to seventy-five percent of\r\nour coffee from that country; but war conditions, diverting nearly all\r\nof Central America's production to our ports, reduced the proportion to\r\nalmost half. In 1919 this had risen to fifty-nine percent, in 1920 it\r\nwas somewhat over sixty percent, and in 1921 it attained a mark of\r\nsixty-two and five-tenths percent. The actual amount shipped, which was\r\n839,212,388 pounds having a value of $77,186,271, was about seven\r\npercent higher than in 1920, which was 785,810,689 pounds valued at\r\n$148,793,593; and about the same percent higher than that of\r\n1919--787,312,293 pounds valued at $160,038,196. Although the actual\r\npoundage showed an increase, it will be noted that the value fell off\r\nalmost one-half as compared with 1920, and more than one-half as\r\ncompared with the year before.\r\n\r\nThe real feature of the year, and perhaps the most interesting\r\ndevelopment in the coffee trade of this country in recent years, is the\r\nsteady advance of Colombian coffee.\r\n\r\nIn the year before the war, we obtained from our nearest South American\r\nneighbor 87,176,477 pounds of coffee valued at $11,381,675, which was\r\nabout ten percent of our total imports. In 1919, the first year after\r\nthe war, this amount was almost doubled, being 150,483,853 pounds with a\r\nvalue of $30,425,162. In 1920, there was a further increase to\r\n194,682,616 pounds valued at $41,557,669, and in 1921 the high mark of\r\n249,123,356 pounds valued at $37,322,305 was reached. This was a gain of\r\ntwenty-eight percent over 1920 shipments; and, although the value was\r\nless than in the year before, the decrease was only ten percent in a\r\nyear when the average fall in value was forty-three percent.\r\n\r\nIt will be news to many people interested in the coffee trade that the\r\nvalue of Colombian coffee now imported into the United States is almost\r\nhalf the value of the Brazilian coffee--$37,000,000 as compared with\r\n$77,000,000. The number of pounds imported is a little less than\r\none-third the Brazilian contribution; but at the present rate of\r\nincrease, it will pass the half mark in a few years.\r\n\r\nColombia and Venezuela together now supply considerably more than half\r\nas much coffee as Brazil in value, and more than one-third as much in\r\nquantity. The average value of Colombian coffee in 1921 was about\r\nfifteen cents a pound, as compared with eleven cents for Venezuelan,\r\nnine cents for Brazilian, ten cents for Central American, and ten and\r\nsix-tenths cents for total coffee imports.\r\n\r\nShipments from Venezuela showed a drop in quantity of nine percent as\r\ncompared with 1920 imports, being 59,783,303 pounds valued at\r\n$6,798,709; in 1920 they were 65,970,954 pounds valued at $13,802,995;\r\nand in 1919, they were 109,777,831 pounds valued at $23,163,071.\r\n\r\nThe figures relating to imports from Central America are of interest as\r\nshowing to what extent we are continuing to hold the trade of the war\r\nyears, when nearly all coffee shipped from that region came to the\r\nUnited States. Although there has probably been a considerable swing\r\nback to the trade with Europe, the 1921 figures show that a large\r\npercent of the trade that this country gained during the war is being\r\nretained. Imports in 1921 were considerably lower than in 1920 or in\r\n1919, but were still more than three times as heavy as in 1913, the last\r\nyear of normal trade.\r\n\r\nThe displacement of Central America's trade by the war, and the extent\r\nto which it has so far returned to old channels, are illustrated in the\r\ntable of Imports into the United States from Central America in the last\r\nnine years on page 301.\r\n\r\nAs Germany was very prominent in pre-war trade, it is likely that more\r\nand more coffee will be diverted from the United States as German\r\nimports gradually increase to their old level.\r\n\r\nIMPORTS INTO THE UNITED STATES FROM\r\nCENTRAL AMERICA\r\n\r\n_Year_        _Pounds_           _Value_\r\n1913         36,326,440         $4,635,359\r\n1914         44,896,856          5,465,893\r\n1915         71,361,288          8,093,532\r\n1916        111,259,125         12,775,921\r\n1917        148,031,640         15,751,761\r\n1918        195,259,628         19,234,198\r\n1919        131,638,695         19,375,179\r\n1920        159,204,341         30,388,567\r\n1921        118,607,382         12,308,250\r\n\r\nImports from Mexico in 1921 were greater by thirty-eight percent than in\r\n1920, but were less than in 1919, and were still much below the normal\r\ntrade before the war. The total was 26,895,034 pounds having a value of\r\n$3,475,122, as compared with 19,519,865 pounds valued at $3,873,217 in\r\nthe year before, and with 29,567,469 pounds valued at $5,434,884 in\r\n1919.

In that year the full effects of the war were felt in the Aden\r\ndistrict, and shipments of coffee to this country dropped to 187,817\r\npounds. They rose to 432,000 pounds in 1918; and in 1919, to 681,290\r\npounds valued at $141,391. In 1920 there was a further rise to 889,633\r\npounds valued at $200,505; and in 1921 they amounted to 2,799,824 pounds\r\nvalued at $476,672. But this trade is of little importance compared with\r\nthat of the producing countries of this hemisphere, being less than one\r\npercent of our total imports.\r\n\r\nImports from the Dutch East Indies continued to decline, being\r\nfifty-five percent less than in 1920. The total of 12,438,016 pounds,\r\nhowever, valued at $1,771,602, is still two or three times the normal\r\npre-war importations.\r\n\r\nExports of coffee in 1921--33,389,805 pounds of green coffee valued at\r\n$5,590,318 and 1,183,162 pounds of roasted valued at $305,288--were\r\nabout the same as those of the year before in quantity, although much\r\nlower in value.

In general, the coffee goes from planter to\r\ntrader in the shipping ports; thence to the exporter, who sells it to an\r\nimporter in the consuming country; he in turn passing it on, to a\r\nroaster, to be prepared for consumption. The system varies in some\r\nrespects in the different countries, according to the development of\r\neconomic and transportation methods; but, broadly considered, this is\r\nthe general method.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Buying Coffee in the Producing Countries_\r\n\r\nThe marketing of coffee begins when the berries are swept up from the\r\ndrying patios, put in gunny sacks, and sent to the ports of export to be\r\nsampled and shipped. In Brazil, four-wheeled wagons drawn by six mules,\r\nor two-wheeled carts carry it to the nearest railroad or river.\r\n\r\nBrazil, as the world's largest producer of coffee, has the most highly\r\ndeveloped buying system. Coffee cultivation has been the chief\r\nagricultural pursuit in that country for many years; and large amounts\r\nof government and private capital have been invested in growing,\r\ntransportation, storage, and ship-loading facilities, particularly in\r\nthe state of São Paulo.\r\n\r\nThe usual method in Brazil is for the _fazendeiro_ (coffee-grower) or\r\nthe _commisario_ (commission merchant) to load his shipments of coffee\r\nat an interior railroad station. If his consignee is in Santos, he\r\ngenerally deposits the bill of lading with a bank and draws a draft,\r\nusually payable after thirty days, against the consignee. When the\r\nconsignee accepts the draft, he receives the bill of lading, and is then\r\npermitted to put the coffee in a warehouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Storing at Santos_\r\n\r\nAt Santos most of the storing is done in the steel warehouses of the\r\nCity Dock Company, a private corporation whose warehouses extend for\r\nthree miles along the waterfront at one end of the town. Railroad\r\nswitches lead to these warehouses, so that the coffee is brought to\r\nstorage in the same cars in which it was originally loaded up-country.\r\nThe warehouses are leased by _commisarios_. There are also many old\r\nwarehouses, built of wood, still operated in Santos, and to these the\r\ncoffee is transferred from the railroad station either by mule carts or\r\nby automobile trucks.\r\n\r\nAt the receiving warehouses, samples of each bag are taken; the tester,\r\nor sampler, standing at the door with a sharp tool, resembling a\r\ncheese-tester, which he thrusts into the center of the bag as the men\r\npass him with the bags of coffee on their heads, removing a double\r\nhandful of the contents. The samples are divided into two parts; one for\r\nthe seller, and one that the _commisario_ retains until he has sold the\r\nconsignment of coffee covered by that particular lot of samples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LAST SAMPLE BEFORE EXPORT, SANTOS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Disappearing Ensaccador_\r\n\r\nIn the old days it was the custom every morning for the _ensaccadores_,\r\nor baggers, and the exporters or their brokers, to visit the\r\n_commisarios'_ warehouses and to bargain for lots of coffee made up by\r\nthe _commisario_.\r\n\r\nIn the Santos market, until recent years, the _ensaccador_, or\r\ncoffee-bagger, often stood between the _commisario_ and exporter. When\r\nAmerican importing houses began to establish their own buying offices in\r\nthe Brazilian ports (about 1910) to deal direct with the _fazendeiro_\r\nand the _commisario_, the gradual elimination of the _ensaccador_ was\r\nbegun. Today he has entirely disappeared from the Santos market, and is\r\ndisappearing from Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, and Victoria.\r\n\r\nCoffee reaches Santos in a mixed condition; that is, it has not been\r\ngraded, or separated according to its various qualities. This is the\r\nwork of the _commisario_, who puts each shipment into \"lots\" in new\r\n\"official\" bags, each of which bears a mark stating that the contents\r\nare São Paulo growth. If the coffee is offered for sale by the owner,\r\nthe _commisario_ will then put it on the \"street,\" the section of Santos\r\ngiven over to coffee trading.\r\n\r\nThe _commisario_ works with samples of the coffee he has to offer and\r\nonly puts out one set at a time. He names his \"asking\" price, known\r\nlocally as the _pedido_, which is the maximum rate he expects to get,\r\nbut seldom receives. A set of samples may be shown to twenty-five or\r\nthirty exporting houses in a day, one at a time. When the sample is in\r\nthe hands of a firm for consideration, no other exporter has the right\r\nto buy the lot even at the _pedido_ price, and the _commisario_ can not\r\naccept other offers until he has refused the bid. On the other hand, if\r\na house refuses to give up the samples, it is understood that it is\r\nwilling to pay the _pedido_ price. The firm first offering a price\r\nacceptable to the _commisario's_ broker gets the lot, even though other\r\nhouses have offered the same price.\r\n\r\nWhen a lot is sold, the samples are turned over to the successful\r\nbidder, and he then asks the _commisario_ for larger samples for\r\ncomparison with the first set.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STAMPING BAGS FOR EXPORT, SANTOS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Commisarios Make as High as Nine Percent_\r\n\r\nHaving sold the coffee of a given planter, the _commisario_ often gets\r\nas much as nine percent for his share of the transaction. Unless the\r\nbags have been furnished to the planter at a good rental, the coffee\r\nmust be transferred to the _commisario's_ bags; and for this the planter\r\npays a commission.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE FROM THE FAZENDAS IS DELIVERED AT THE\r\nCOMMISSARIOS' WAREHOUSES IN RIO]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF A SANTOS CLEANING AND GRADING WAREHOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREPARING BRAZIL COFFEE FOR EXPORT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRADING COFFEE AT SANTOS]\r\n\r\nFormerly the coffee, being rebagged by the _ensaccador_, was manipulated\r\nin what is called ligas; that is, mixing several neutral grades from\r\nvarious lots to create an artificial grade; or, more properly speaking,\r\na \"type,\" desirable for trading on the New York market.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grading and Testing in Brazil_\r\n\r\nHaving bought a lot of coffee, the exporter's next step is to grade and\r\nto test it. Grading is generally done in the morning and late afternoon,\r\nthe hours from one to half-past four being devoted to making offers. The\r\nafternoon grading is done by sight. The morning examinations are more\r\nthorough, some progressive exporting houses even cup-testing the\r\nsamples. Samples are compared with house standards, and with the\r\nrequirements that have been cabled from the home office in the consuming\r\ncountry. Some of the coffee is roasted to obtain a standard by which all\r\n\"chops\" (varieties) are then graded and marked according to\r\nquality--fine, good, fair, or poor. Quality is further classified by the\r\nnumerals from two to eight, which standards have been established on the\r\nNew York Coffee and Sugar Exchange, and are described farther on in this\r\nchapter. Some traders also use the terms large or small bean; fair,\r\ngood, or poor roasters; soft or hard bean; light or dark; and similar\r\ndescriptive terms.\r\n\r\nWhen a lot is ready for shipment overseas, the _commisario_ stamps each\r\nbag with his identifying mark, to which the buyer or exporter adds his\r\nbrand. If the _commisario_ is ordered before eleven in the morning to\r\nship a lot of coffee, he must be paid before three in the afternoon of\r\nthe same day; if he receives the order after eleven, payment need not be\r\nmade before three in the afternoon of the following day. Generally the\r\nterms of sale are full settlement in thirty days, less discount at the\r\nrate of six percent per annum for the unexpired time, if paid before the\r\nperiod of grace is up.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dispatching and Capitazias_\r\n\r\nThe exporter collects his money by drawing a draft against his client on\r\ndeposit of bill of lading, cashing the draft through an exchange broker\r\nwho deducts his brokerage fee. The exporter must obtain a consular\r\ninvoice, a shipping permit from both federal and state authorities, and\r\npay an export tax, before the coffee goes aboard the ship. This process\r\nis known as \"dispatching,\" while the dock company's charges are known as\r\n_capitazias_.\r\n\r\nIn practically all coffee-growing sections the small planter is helped\r\nfinancially by the owners of processing plants or by the exporting\r\nfirms. The larger planters may even obtain advances on their crops from\r\nthe importing houses in New York, Havre, Hamburg, or other foreign\r\ncenters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TEST BY CUPS, SANTOS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Exchange at Santos_\r\n\r\nA new coffee exchange began business at Santos on May 1, 1917, sitting\r\nwith the Coffee Brokers Board of Control. This Board consists of five\r\ncoffee brokers, four elected annually at a general meeting of the\r\nbrokers of Santos, and one chosen annually by the president of the state\r\nof São Paulo. Among the duties of the Board are the classification and\r\nvaluation of coffee, adjustment of differences, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHERE COFFEES ARE SIGHT-GRADED BEFORE BEING SUBMITTED TO\r\nCUP TESTS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAND & RAND BUILDING: FIRST FLOOR, STORAGE; SECOND FLOOR,\r\nOFFICES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW YORK COFFEE IMPORTERS' MODEL ESTABLISHMENT AT SANTOS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PACK-MULE TRANSPORT IN VENEZUELA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Transporting Coffee to Points of Export_\r\n\r\nTransportation methods from plantation to shipside naturally vary with\r\nlocal topographical and economic conditions. In Venezuela, the bulk of\r\nthe coffee is transported by pack-mule from the plantations and shipping\r\ntowns to the head of the railroad system, and thence by rail to the\r\nCatatumbo River, where it is carried in small steamers down the river\r\nand across Lake Maracaibo to the city of Maracaibo. In Colombia, coffee\r\nis sent down the Magdalena River aboard small steamers direct to the\r\nseaboard. In Central America, transportation is one of the most serious\r\nproblems facing the grower. The roads are poor, and in the rainy season\r\nare sometimes deep with mud; so much so that it may require a week to\r\ndrive a wagon-load of coffee to the railroad or the river shipping\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE-CARRYING CART, GUATEMALA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Buying Coffee in Abyssinia_\r\n\r\nCoffee is generally grown in Abyssinia by small farmers, who mostly\r\nfinance themselves and sell the crop to native brokers, who in turn sell\r\nit to representatives of foreign houses in the larger trading centers.\r\nTrading methods between farmer and broker are not much more than the old\r\nsystem of barter. In the southwestern section, where the Abyssinian\r\ncoffee grows wild, transport to the nearest trading center is by mule\r\ntrain, and not infrequently by camel back. In the Harar district, the\r\nwomen of the farmers living near Harar the market center, carry the\r\ncoffee in long shallow baskets on their heads to the native brokers. In\r\nthe more remote places the coffee farmer waits for the broker to call on\r\nhim. From the town of Harar the coffee is transported by mule or camel\r\ntrain to Dire-Daoua, whence it is shipped by rail to Jibuti, to be sent\r\nby direct steamers to Europe, or across the Gulf of Aden to Aden in\r\nArabia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE-LADEN OXEN FORDING STREAM, COLOMBIA]\r\n\r\nTen different languages are spoken in Harar. In order successfully to\r\nengage in the coffee business there, it is necessary either to become\r\nproficient in all these tongues, or to engage some one who is.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRANSPORTING COFFEE BY MULEBACK IN THE CITY OF CUCUTA,\r\nCOLOMBIA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Schooner from Encontrados to Maracaibo]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One of the lake and river steamers]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE CARGO CARRIERS THAT OPERATE ON LAKE MARACAIBO AND\r\nTRIBUTARY RIVERS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DONKEY TRANSPORT TRAIN FOR COFFEE IN MEXICO]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE TRANSPORT IN MEXICO AND SOUTH AMERICA]\r\n\r\nWhen the coffee is brought, partially cleaned, into Harar by donkey or\r\nmule train, it is first taken to the open air custom-house (coffee\r\nexchange) in the center of the town, where a ten-percent duty (in\r\ncoffee) is exacted by the local government, and one Abyssinian dollar\r\n(fifty cents) is added for every thirty-seven and a half pounds, this\r\nlatter being Ras Makonnen's share. As soon as the native dealer has\r\nreleased to him what remains of his shipment, he takes it out of the\r\ncustom-house enclosure and disposes of it through the native brokers,\r\nwho have their little \"office\" booths stretching in a long line up the\r\nstreet just outside the custom-house entrance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DONKEY COFFEE TRANSPORT ON THE WAY FROM HARAR TO\r\nDIRE-DAOUA]\r\n\r\nThere, a brokerage charge of one piaster per bag is paid by the buyer,\r\nand the coffee then becomes the property of the European merchant. In\r\nsome cases it is put through a further cleaning process; but usually it\r\nis shipped to Jibuti or Aden uncleaned. Arriving at Jibuti, there is a\r\none-percent ad valorem duty to pay. At Aden, there is another tax of one\r\nanna (two cents) to be paid to the British authorities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE CAMELS IN THE CUSTOM-HOUSE, HARAR]\r\n\r\nSince 1914, however, Abyssinian coffee has been exported largely through\r\nthe Sudan, a much shorter and less expensive trip than that to Adis\r\nAbeba and Jibuti. Now the coffee is carried by pack-train to Gambela on\r\nthe Sobat River; and thence by river steamer to Khartoum, where it is\r\nloaded on railroad trains and sent to Port Sudan on the Red Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Buying Coffee in Arabia_\r\n\r\nMost of the coffee in Arabia is grown in almost inaccessible mountain\r\nvalleys by native Arabs, and is transported by camel caravan to Aden or\r\nHodeida, where it is sold to agents of foreign importing houses. Mocha,\r\nonce the principal exporting city for coffee, was abandoned as a coffee\r\nport early in the nineteenth century, chiefly because of the difficulty\r\nof keeping the roadstead of the harbor free from sandbars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SELLING COFFEE AT ADEN BY TAPPING HANDS UNDER COVER]\r\n\r\nIn Aden there is a kind of open-air coffee \"exchange\" (as in Harar)\r\nwhere the camel trains unload their coffee from the interior. The\r\nEuropean coffee merchant does not frequent it, but is represented by\r\nnative brokers, through whom all coffee business is transacted. This\r\nnative broker is an important person, and one of the most picturesque\r\ncharacters in Aden. He receives a commission of one and a half percent\r\nfrom both buyer and seller. Certain grades of coffee are purchasable\r\nonly in Maria Theresa dollars; so a knowledge of exchange values is\r\nessential to the broker's calling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PACKING AND TRANSPORTING COFFEE AT ADEN]\r\n\r\nIn making coffee sales, the negotiations between buyer and seller are\r\ncarried on by means of finger taps under a handkerchief. The would-be\r\npurchaser reaches out his hand to the seller under cover of the cloth\r\nand makes his bid in the palm of the seller's hand by tapping his\r\nfingers. The code is well understood by both. Its advantage lies in the\r\nfact that a possible purchaser is enabled to make his bid in the\r\npresence of other buyers without the latter knowing what he is offering.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Buying Coffee in Netherlands India_\r\n\r\nIn the Dutch East Indies cultivation of _Coffea arabica_ has diminished,\r\nthe decay of the industry beginning when Brazil and Central America\r\nbecame the dominant factors in the green market. Not so many years ago\r\ncoffee growing and coffee trading were virtually government monopolies.\r\nUnder government control each native family was required to keep from\r\nsix hundred to a thousand coffee trees in bearing, and to sell\r\ntwo-fifths of the crop to the government. It was also compulsory to\r\ndeliver the coffee cleaned and sorted to the official godowns, and to\r\nsell the crop at fixed prices--nine to twelve florins per picul previous\r\nto 1874, although forty to fifty florins were offered in the open\r\nmarket. Later, the price was advanced; until about 1900 the government\r\npaid fifteen florins per picul for coffee in parchment. All government\r\ncoffee was sold at public auction in Batavia and Padang, these sales\r\nbeing held four times a year in Batavia and three times a year in\r\nPadang.\r\n\r\nCoffee from private estates, not under government control and operated\r\nby European corporations or individuals, has now succeeded the\r\ngovernment monopoly coffee. Private-estate crops are sold by public\r\ntender, usually on or about January 28 of each year. If the owners do\r\nnot get the price they desire in Batavia or Padang, the coffee is sent\r\nto Amsterdam for disposal. Some coffees always are sent to Holland;\r\nbecause the directors of the company get a commission on all sales\r\nthere, and also because the coffees are prepared especially for the\r\nDutch market. The Hollander wants his coffee blue-green in color.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE CAMEL TRAIN ARRIVING AT THE HODEIDA CUSTOM-HOUSE\r\nFROM THE INTERIOR OF YEMEN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOADING BY THE OLD-STYLE HAND-LABOR METHOD]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HERE THE AUTOMATIC BELT POURS INTO THE HOLD A CONTINUOUS\r\nSTREAM OF BAGS OF COFFEE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD AND NEW METHODS OF LOADING COFFEE AT SANTOS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Loading Coffee at Santos_\r\n\r\nIn Brazil, when the coffee has been rebagged and marked by both the\r\n_commisario_ and the exporter, the coffee is again sampled. These\r\nsamples are compared with those by which the purchase was made; and if\r\nright, the bags are turned over to the dock-master, who sets his\r\nlaborers to work loading ship. Two methods are used at Santos. The old\r\nfamiliar style of hand labor is still in evidence--men of all\r\nnationalities, but largely Spaniards and Portuguese, take the bags on\r\ntheir heads and carry them in single file up the gangplanks and into the\r\nhold of the ship. The dock company, however, operates a huge automatic\r\nloading machine, or belt, which saves a great deal of time and labor. In\r\nother Brazilian ports all loading is done by manual labor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A COFFEE FREIGHTER ON THE CAUCA RIVER, COLOMBIA]\r\n\r\nRecently, at the suggestion of the Commercial Association of Santos, the\r\nminister of transport of São Paulo ordered that coffees destined for\r\nlegitimate traders should be transported during four days of the week,\r\nand those of a speculative nature during the remaining two days. A\r\npremium of as much as five milreis a bag has been paid by speculators in\r\norder to obtain immediate transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Shipping Coffee from Colombia_\r\n\r\nAs Colombia ranks next to Brazil in coffee, a brief description of its\r\ntransportation methods, which are unique, should be of interest to\r\ncoffee shippers. A goodly portion of Colombia's coffee exports comes\r\nfrom the district around the little city of Cucuta, whose official name\r\nis San José de Cucuta. It is the capital of North Santander, is situated\r\nin a beautiful valley of the Colombian Andes mountains that is watered\r\nby several rivers, and is only about a half-hour's ride by motor from\r\nthe Venezuelan frontier.\r\n\r\nDue to its geographical position, Cucuta serves as the most convenient\r\ninland port and commercial center for most of the department of North\r\nSantander. For the same reason, it is forced to depend on Maracaibo as\r\nits seaport, even though the Venezuelan government has a number of\r\nannoying laws controlling the commerce thus conducted. The Colombian\r\nports of Baranquilla and Cartagena on the Atlantic are too distant from\r\nCucuta to be available; and a large part of the traffic would have to be\r\ndone on mule-back across one of the most formidable ranges of the\r\nColombian Andes, involving high cost and delay in transportation. Yet\r\nits frontier position makes it possible for Cucuta to have important\r\ncommercial relations with the neighboring republic of Venezuela, and to\r\nenjoy exceptional privileges from the Colombian central government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE STEAMERS ON THE MAGDALENA, COLOMBIA]\r\n\r\nA cargo of coffee leaving Cucuta has to go through the following steps\r\non its way to a foreign market:\r\n\r\n1. From Cucuta, it travels thirty-five miles by railroad to Puerto\r\nVillamizar, a Colombian river port on the Zulia river.\r\n\r\n2. At Puerto Villamizar it is loaded into small, flat-bottomed, steel\r\nlighters that are taken to Puerto Encontrados by man power. Puerto\r\nEncontrados, belonging to Venezuela, is on the Catatumbo river; and the\r\ntrip from Villamizar takes from two to four days, depending on the depth\r\nof water in the river. During high water, river steamers are also used,\r\nand make the trip in less than a day.\r\n\r\n3. At Encontrados the cargo is loaded on river steamboats more or less\r\nof the Mississippi river type, which take it to Maracaibo, Venezuela.\r\nCoffee is also carried to Maracaibo by small sailing vessels.\r\n\r\n4. At Maracaibo it is taken by ocean vessel, which either carries it\r\ndirect to New York or to Curaçao, Dutch West Indies, where it is\r\ntranshipped to steamers plying between New York and Curaçao. It is\r\nobvious that the many transhipments that coffee coming from Cucuta has\r\nto undergo greatly retard its arrival at a foreign port; and a cargo\r\nsometimes takes a month or more to reach New York.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD AND NEW METHODS EMPLOYED IN LOADING HEAVY CARGO ON\r\nTHE SANTA CECILIA]\r\n\r\nCoffee from Cucuta is stored in the Venezuelan custom-house, from which\r\nit must be shipped for export within forty-five days, or the shipper\r\nruns the risk of having it declared by the Venezuelan government for\r\n_consumo_ (home consumption) at a prohibitory tariff. Arrangements can\r\nbe made at considerable cost to have the coffee taken to a private\r\nwarehouse; but it is no longer possible to make up the chops in\r\nMaracaibo, as was done formerly with all the Cucutas. The Venezuelan\r\ncustoms will not even allow the Maracaibo forwarding agent the same\r\nchops, as a general rule. Special permission must be obtained to change\r\nany bags that are stained or damaged. Schooners from Curaçao have, in\r\nthe past, carried a great deal of the Colombian coffee to Curaçao.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Port Handling Charges in Brazil_\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to list all the various charges for the handling\r\nof coffee at the port of shipment in Brazil, the figures not being\r\naccessible to outsiders. Some figures, such as warehouse charges and\r\nvarious forms of tax, are obtainable, however. For every bag of coffee\r\nwhich is in warehouse over forty-eight hours from the time of its\r\narrival from the railroad there is a charge of two hundred reis (about\r\nfive cents). In São Paulo there is an export tax of nine percent ad\r\nvalorem levied by the state, and in Rio the state tax is eight and a\r\nhalf percent. Then there is a surtax of five francs per bag in Santos,\r\nand of three francs in Rio, which goes toward defraying the expenses of\r\nvalorization. For every bag of coffee that passes over the dock the dock\r\ncompany charges one hundred reis (about two and a half cents).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some Record Coffee Cargoes_\r\n\r\nWith its superior loading and shipping facilities Brazil has been able\r\nto send extraordinarily large cargoes of coffee to the United States\r\nsince the development of large modern freight-carrying steamships. While\r\n75,000 or 90,000 bag cargoes were of common occurrence just prior to the\r\noutbreak of the World War, several shipments of more than 100,000 bags\r\nwere made in the years 1915, 1916, and 1917. Up to January, 1919, the\r\nrecord was held by the steamship Bjornstjerne Bjornson which unloaded\r\n136,424 bags at New York on November 17, 1915. Other shipments of more\r\nthan 100,000 bags were by the Rossetti (December, 1900), 125,918 bags;\r\nthe Wascana (March 3, 1915), 108,781 bags; the Wagama (October, 1916),\r\n105,650 bags; the American (October 23, 1916), 124,212 bags; the Santa\r\nCecilia (November 2, 1916), 105,500 bags, and the Dakotan (January 6,\r\n1917), which carried 136,387 bags.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Transport Overseas_\r\n\r\nTo bring green coffee to the consuming markets, both steamships and\r\nsailing vessels are used, although the latter have almost wholly given\r\nway to the speedier and more capacious modern steamers. Because of its\r\nlarge consumption, a constant stream of vessels is always on the way to\r\nthe markets of the United States. The majority of these unload at New\r\nYork, which in 1920 received about fifty-nine percent of all the coffee\r\nimported into this country. New Orleans came next, with about\r\ntwenty-five percent; and San Francisco third, with about twelve percent.\r\n\r\nThe approximate time consumed in transporting green coffee overseas from\r\nthe principal producing countries to the United States by freight\r\nsteamships is shown in the table in the next column.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, that of Guadeloupe, for instance, the vessels stop at a\r\nnumber of ports, and this lengthens the time. This is also true of\r\nvessels running on the west coast of Central America and of those from\r\nAden.\r\n\r\nDuring the World War, one shipment of Timor coffee consumed three and a\r\nhalf years coming from Java to New York. It was aboard the German\r\nsteamship Brisbane, which cleared from Batavia, July 4, 1914, and\r\nfearing capture, took refuge in Goa, Portuguese India, where it lay\r\nuntil Portugal joined the Allies. Then the Portuguese seized the vessel,\r\nand turned it over to the British, who moved it to Bombay. Here the\r\ncargo was finally transhipped to the City of Adelaide, reaching New York\r\nin January, 1918, three and a half years after the coffee left Batavia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION TIME FOR COFFEE[J]\r\n\r\nRio de Janeiro to New York      11 to 16 days\r\nSantos         \"   \"   \"        14 to 18  \"\r\nBahia          \"   \"   \"        17        \"\r\nVictoria       \"   \"   \"        19        \"\r\nMaracaibo      \"   \"   \"        10        \"\r\nPuerto Cabello \"   \"   \"        10        \"\r\nLa Guaira      \"   \"   \"         8        \"\r\nCosta Rica     \"   \"   \"        10        \"\r\nSalvador       \"   \"   \"        18        \"\r\nMexico         \"   \"   \"         9        \"\r\nGuatemala      \"   \"   \"        11        \"\r\n(Puerto\r\nBarrios)\r\nColombia       \"   \"   \"        10        \"\r\nHaiti          \"   \"   \"         7        \"\r\nPorto Rico     \"   \"   \"         5        \"\r\nGuadeloupe     \"   \"   \"        10        \"\r\nHawaii         \"   \"   \"        28        \"\r\n(via P.C.)\r\nJava           \"   \"   \"        30        \"\r\n(via Suez)\r\nSumatra        \"   \"   \"        30        \"\r\n(via Suez)\r\nSingapore      \"   \"   \"        35        \"\r\n(via Suez)\r\nIndia          \"   \"   \"        35        \"\r\n(via Suez)\r\nAden           \"   \"   \"        45        \"\r\n(via Suez)\r\nPorto Rico    \"  New Orleans     7        \"\r\nGuadeloupe    \"   \"     \"       10        \"\r\nHaiti         \"   \"     \"        7        \"\r\nGuatemala     \"   \"     \"        8        \"\r\nCosta Rica    \"   \"     \"        7        \"\r\nColombia      \"   \"     \"        6        \"\r\nMexico        \"   \"     \"        4        \"\r\nSalvador      \"   \"     \"       15        \"\r\nGuatemala    \" San Francisco    10        \"\r\nCosta Rica   \"  \"      \"        18        \"\r\nSalvador     \"  \"      \"        14        \"\r\nMexico       \"  \"      \"         8        \"\r\nHawaii       \"  \"      \"         8        \"\r\nSingapore    \"  \"      \"        30        \"\r\nIndia        \"  \"      \"        33        \"\r\n\r\n[J] The American Legion and the Southern Cross, of the Munson Line, make\r\nthe journey from Rio de Janeiro to New York in eleven days. These are\r\nfreight-and-passenger vessels, and have carried as many as 5,000 bags of\r\ncoffee at one time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Java Coffee \"Ex-Sailing Ships\"_\r\n\r\nUp to 1915 it was the custom to ship considerable Java coffee to New\r\nYork in slow-going sailing vessels of the type in favor a hundred years\r\nago. Java coffees \"ex-sailing ships\" always commanded a premium because\r\nof the natural sweating they experienced in transit. Attempts to imitate\r\nthis natural sweating process by steam-heating the coffees that reached\r\nNew York by the faster-going steamship lines, and interference therewith\r\nby the pure-food authorities, caused a falling off in the demand for\r\n\"light,\" \"brown,\" or \"extra brown\" Dutch East Indian growths; and\r\ngradually the picturesque sailing vessels were seen no more in New York\r\nharbor. At the end they were mostly Norwegian barks of the type of the\r\nGaa Paa.\r\n\r\nIt usually took from four to five months to make the trip from Padang or\r\nBatavia to New York. Crossing the Equator twice, first in the Indian\r\nOcean, then in the South Atlantic, the trip was more than equal to\r\ncircumnavigating the earth in our latitude. In the hold of the vessel\r\nthe cargo underwent a sweating that gave to the coffee a rare shade of\r\ncolor and that, in the opinion of coffee experts, greatly enhanced its\r\nflavor and body. The captain always received a handsome gratuity if the\r\ncoffee turned \"extra brown.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNLOADING JAVA COFFEE FROM A SAILING VESSEL AT A BROOKLYN\r\nDOCK\r\n\r\nThe ship is the Gaa Paa, which made the voyage from Padang in five\r\nmonths in 1912]\r\n\r\nThe demand for sweated, or brown, Javas probably had its origin in the\r\ngood old days when the American housewife bought her coffee green and\r\nroasted it herself in a skillet over a quick fire. Coffee slightly brown\r\nwas looked upon with favor; for every good housewife in those days knew\r\nthat green coffee changed its color in aging, and that of course aged\r\ncoffee was best.\r\n\r\nAnd so it came about that Java coffees were preferably shipped in\r\nslow-going Dutch sailing vessels, because it was desirable to have a\r\nlong voyage under the hot tropical sun suitably to sweat the coffee on\r\nits way to market and to have it a handsome brown on arrival. The\r\nsweating frequently produced a musty flavor which, if not too\r\npronounced, was highly prized by experts. When the ship left Padang or\r\nBatavia the hatches were battened down, not to be opened again until New\r\nYork harbor was reached.\r\n\r\nMany of the old-style Dutch sailing vessels were built somewhat after\r\nthe pattern of the Goed Vrouw, which Irving tells us was a hundred feet\r\nlong, a hundred feet wide, and a hundred feet high. Sometimes she sailed\r\nforward, sometimes backward, and sometimes sideways. After dark, the\r\nlights were put out, all sail was taken in, and all hands turned in for\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nThe last of the coffee-carrying sailing vessels to reach the United\r\nStates was the bark Padang, which arrived in New York on Christmas day,\r\n1914.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BUSH TERMINAL SYSTEM OF DOCKS AND WAREHOUSES\r\n\r\nMuch of the green coffee received in New York is discharged and stored\r\nhere, at one of the most modern waterfront and terminal developments in\r\nthe world]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AIRPLANE VIEW OF NEW YORK DOCK COMPANY'S PIERS AND\r\nWAREHOUSES\r\n\r\nThis is the Fulton Street section of the Brooklyn waterfront, where more\r\nthan half the coffee received in New York is unloaded. The storage\r\nwarehouses are to be seen back of the piers]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RECEIVING PIERS FOR COFFEE AT NEW YORK]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Handling Coffee at New York_\r\n\r\nThe handling of the cargoes of coffee when they arrive at their\r\ndestination is a source of wonder to the layman. There is probably no\r\nbetter place to study the handling of coffee than in New York City--the\r\nworld's largest coffee center. Millions of bags of coffee pass into\r\nconsumption every year through its docks, and scarcely a day goes by\r\nwhen there are not one or more ships discharging coffee upon the docks\r\nlining the Brooklyn shore, the center of the coffee-warehouse district\r\nfor New York. In 1921, the New York Dock Company alone had 159 bonded\r\nwarehouses with a storage capacity of some 65,000,000 cubic feet; and 34\r\npiers, the longest measuring 1,193 feet and containing more than 175,000\r\nsquare feet. These piers have a total deck space of sixty-one and a half\r\nacres. The wharfage distance is more than nine and a third miles. More\r\nthan twenty steamship lines berth their vessels there regularly, and\r\nmany of them are coffee ships. The warehouses have direct connections\r\nwith all the principal railway trunk lines running into the New York\r\ndistrict; and the whole property of the company stretches along the\r\nwaterfront opposite lower Manhattan for about two and one-half miles.\r\n\r\nAlthough coffee is admitted to the United States free of duty, it is\r\nsubject to practically the same formalities as dutiable goods. Before\r\nthe cargo can be \"broken out,\" a government permit to \"land and deliver\"\r\nmust be placed in the hands of the customs inspector on the dock. This\r\ndone, the ship's samples, which consist of the samples sent by the\r\nexporter to the importer, are taken to the United States appraiser's\r\noffice for inspection, and are then delivered to the importer's\r\nrepresentative. Meanwhile the shipping documents covering the cargo,\r\nincluding bills of lading and consular invoices, have been sent to the\r\npost office for delivery to banks and bankers' agents, who check and\r\ndeliver them to the customs officers for entry. The government requires\r\nthat this entry shall be made within forty-eight hours of the vessel's\r\narrival, else the cargo will be stored in a United States bonded\r\nwarehouse under what is known as \"general order\" which makes the\r\nconsignee liable for storage and cartage charges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNLOADING COFFEE AT ONE OF THE COVERED PIERS OF THE NEW\r\nYORK DOCK COMPANY]\r\n\r\nWhen a coffee ship arrives in New York, not much time is lost in\r\ndischarging the cargo. As soon as the vessel is securely moored to the\r\npier, and the government's permission to \"land and deliver\" is secured,\r\nthe hatches are removed, the coffee is hauled out of the hold by block\r\nand tackle and swung off in slings to the pier, where dock laborers\r\ncarry the bags to their proper places. If each cargo consisted of one\r\nconsignment to a single importer, and contained only one variety of\r\ncoffee, unloading would be a comparatively simple affair. In general\r\npractise, however, the cargoes consist of a large number of consignments\r\nand a variety of grades, necessitating a careful sorting as unloading\r\nprogresses. Accordingly, even before the unloading begins, the dock is\r\nchalked off into squares, each square having a number, or symbol,\r\nrepresenting a particular consignment. As the bags come up out of the\r\nhold, the foreman of the laborers, who has a key to the brand marks on\r\nthe bags, indicates where each bag is to be placed. Coffee to be\r\nreshipped, either by lighter or rail, is heaped in piles by itself until\r\nloaded on to the lighters or freight cars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STORING COFFEE BY MARKS AND CHOPS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOISTING COFFEE INTO THE STORAGE WAREHOUSES ADJOINING THE\r\nBROOKLYN PIERS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RECEIVING AND STORING COFFEE AT NEW YORK]\r\n\r\nThe next step is to transfer the cargo to the warehouse, and to\r\nseparate each consignment according to the various kinds of coffee\r\nmaking up the invoices. When the importer gives his orders to store, he\r\nsends also a list of the different kinds of coffees in his consignment,\r\ncalled \"chops\" by the trade, with directions how to divide the shipment.\r\nTo do this, the floor of the warehouse is chalked off into squares, as\r\nwas done on the dock; but now the numbers, or symbols, in each space\r\nindicate the chops in each invoice, or consignment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TESTER AT WORK, BUSH TERMINAL, NEW YORK]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOADING LIGHTERS, BUSH DOCKS, NEW YORK]\r\n\r\nThe importer naturally is eager to sample the newly arrived coffee.\r\nSampling is generally done by trained warehouse employees, who are\r\nequipped with coffee triers, sampling instruments resembling\r\napple-corers, which they thrust into the bags. The instrument is hollow,\r\nand the coffee flows into the hand of the sampler, who places each\r\nsample in a paper bag which is marked to indicate the chop. The total\r\nsample of each chop usually consists of about ten pounds of coffee,\r\nwhich the importer compares with the exporter's sample.\r\n\r\nWhen sampling for trade delivery, about two-thirds of the bags in a chop\r\nare tried. But when sampling for delivery on Coffee Exchange contract,\r\nevery bag must be tested, and care taken that each chop is uniform in\r\ncolor, kind, and quality. Coffee for Exchange delivery must be stored in\r\na warehouse licensed by the Exchange; and the warehouseman is\r\nresponsible for the uniformity of grade of each chop.\r\n\r\nWhen approximately ninety percent of the cargo has been unloaded and\r\nstored, the warehouse issues what has become known as the \"last bag\r\nnotice.\" In the majority of cases the coffee has been sold before\r\narrival; and on receipt of the last bag notice, the importer can\r\ntransfer ownership of the coffee and save interest.\r\n\r\nIn a cargo of 75,000 to 100,000 bags of coffee that have been hurriedly\r\nloaded in the producing country and unloaded at destination in equal\r\nhaste, a small portion of the cargo is almost certain to be damaged.\r\nGenerally the damage is slight. If a bag is torn or stained, the coffee\r\nis placed in a new bag. If the contents have become mildewed, the\r\ndamaged portion is taken to a warehouse for reconditioning; while the\r\nsound coffee is thoroughly aired to remove the odor and is then placed\r\nin a clean bag. The reconditioned lot is put into a separate package and\r\nforwarded to the buyer with a \"reconditioning statement\" that shows what\r\nhas been done.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW TERMINAL SYSTEM ON STATEN ISLAND\r\n\r\nOn the left are three piers of the Pouch Terminal at Clifton; on the\r\nright, four of the American Dock Terminal at Tompkinsville; and between\r\nthese are thirteen piers of the new Municipal Terminal]\r\n\r\nBags that have become torn in transit, and parts of their contents\r\nspilled, are called \"slacks.\" These are weighed as they arrive on the\r\ndock by a licensed public weigher; and a sufficient quantity of the\r\ncoffee remaining on the floor of the ship's hold is put into the bag to\r\nmake it of the proper weight. The expense of reconditioning and\r\nrebagging is generally borne by the marine insurance companies. When the\r\nentire cargo is unloaded, and the slacks and bad-order bags are weighed\r\nand marked, the warehouseman tallies up the records of his clerks, and\r\nrenders a corrected chop list to the consignee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOTOR TRACTOR MOVING COFFEE AT THE BUSH TERMINAL DOCKS,\r\nBROOKLYN]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Electric Tractors and Trailers_\r\n\r\nAnother district along the water front of Brooklyn where coffee is\r\ndischarged in large quantities is that between Thirty-third and\r\nForty-fourth Streets, south Brooklyn, occupied by the Bush Terminal\r\nStores. This plant is laid out with railroad spurs on every pier, so\r\nthat its own transfer cars, or the cars of the railroads running out of\r\nNew York, can be run into the sheds of the docks where coffee is being\r\ndischarged from the ships. The methods employed by the Bush Terminal are\r\nsimilar to those just described, except that all the coffee is handled\r\nby electrically-manipulated cars or trucks, in some instances the\r\npowerful little tractors hauling many \"trailers\" to various parts of the\r\nyards.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Handling Charges at New York_\r\n\r\nBefore the World War, it cost approximately one-half cent a bag to\r\nhandle green coffee from the vessel to warehouse and in storage in New\r\nYork. The rate advanced nearly one hundred percent in the latter part of\r\n1919, then dropped slightly, although it is still (1922) above the\r\npre-war price. Other handling charges are shown in the following\r\ntabulation:\r\n\r\nCOFFEE HANDLING CHARGES AT NEW YORK\r\n\r\n               Pre-war prices   Present prices\r\n                Cents per bag      Cents per bag\r\n                  (132 lbs.)

This charge was discontinued in 1921. The cost of\r\nweighing increased from two and one-half cents per bag in 1914 to four\r\nand one-half cents in 1919, and then dropped to the present price of\r\nthree to three and one-half cents.

The Association formed a freight-forwarding\r\nbureau, and invited members to have their coffee shipments handled\r\nthrough the bureau. The charges for forwarding direct importations are\r\ntwo cents per bag. Cartage charges vary from six to eighteen cents per\r\nhundred pounds. Claims are handled without charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Seven Stages of Transportation_\r\n\r\nThe foregoing story has taken the reader through the seven most direct\r\nroutes that lead from the plantation to the roaster: first, from the\r\npatio to the railroad or river; then to the city of export; into the\r\nwarehouses there; then into the steamers; out of them, and upon the\r\nwharf at the port of destination; from the wharf into the warehouses;\r\nand, finally, from the warehouses to the roasting rooms. It will be\r\nunderstood that in some instances where the plantation is hidden away in\r\nthe mountains, it is necessary to relay the coffee; and again, at this\r\nend, the coffee is very often transhipped. In such cases, more handlings\r\nare required.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNLOADING A COFFEE SHIP BY BLOCK AND TACKLE AT THE PORT\r\nOF NEW ORLEANS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN FOREGROUND--LOADING COFFEE BY MEANS OF AN AUTOMATIC\r\nTRAVELING-BELT CONVEYOR, ON GOVERNMENT BARGES FOR ST. LOUIS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE-HANDLING SCENES ON THE WHARVES AT NEW ORLEANS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Handling Coffee at New Orleans_\r\n\r\nCoffee ships are unloaded in New Orleans, the second coffee port in the\r\nUnited States, in about the same general manner as in New York, with the\r\nimportant exception that the block-and-tackle system for transferring\r\nthe bags from the ship to the dock has been largely supplanted by the\r\nautomatic traveling-belt conveyor system. Another notable feature is New\r\nOrleans' steel-roofed piers, whereon the coffee can be stored until\r\nready for shipment to the interior. Because of the class of\r\nlabor--mostly negro--employed in unloading ships, New Orleans has found\r\nit expedient to retain the old flag system to indicate the part of the\r\npier where each mark of coffee is to be piled as taken from the vessel.\r\nThese little flags vary in shape, color and printed pattern, each\r\nrepresenting a particular lot of coffee, and they are firmly fixed at\r\nthe part of the pier where those bags should be stacked. Trained\r\ncheckers read the marks on the bags as the laborers carry them past, and\r\ntell the carrier where the bag should be placed. To the illiterate\r\nlaborers the checker's cries of \"blue check,\" \"green ball,\" \"red heart,\"\r\n\"black hand,\" and the like, are more understandable than such\r\nindications as letters or numbers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOWING HOW COFFEE IS STORED UNDER STEEL-COVERED SHEDS AT\r\nNEW ORLEANS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Handling Coffee at San Francisco_\r\n\r\nSan Francisco ranks third in the list of United States coffee ports,\r\nhaving received its greatest development in the four years of the World\r\nWar, when the flow of Central American coffees was largely diverted from\r\nHamburg to the Californian port. In the course of these four years, the\r\nannual volume of coffee imports increased from some 380,000 bags to more\r\nthan 1,000,000 bags in 1918. The bulk of these importations came from\r\nCentral America, though some came from Hawaii, India, and Brazil and\r\nother South American countries. Because of its improved unloading and\r\ndistributing facilities, San Francisco claims to be able to handle a\r\ncargo of coffee more rapidly than either New York or New Orleans.\r\n\r\nHandling Central American coffees in San Francisco is distinctly\r\ndifferent from the business in Brazil. In order to secure the Central\r\nAmerican planter's crops, the importers find it necessary to finance his\r\noperations to a large extent. Consequently, the Central American trade\r\nis not a simple matter of buying and selling, but an intricate financial\r\noperation on the part of the San Francisco importers. Practically all\r\nthe coffee coming in is either on consignment, or is already sold to\r\nestablished coffee-importing houses. Brokers do not deal direct with the\r\nexporters; and practically none of the roasters now import direct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISCHARGING COFFEE FROM A STEAMER JUST ARRIVED FROM\r\nCENTRAL AMERICA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW A LARGE CARGO OF COFFEE IS HANDLED ON THE PIER AS IT\r\nIS UNLOADED FROM THE SHIP]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNLOADING AND STORING COFFEE AT SAN FRANCISCO]\r\n\r\nIn recent years San Francisco has adopted the practise of buying a\r\nlarge part of her coffee on the \"to arrive\" basis; that is the purchase\r\nhas been made before the coffee is shipped from the producing country,\r\nor while in transit. This practise applies, of course, only to well\r\nknown marks and standard grades. Coffee that has not been sold before\r\narrival in San Francisco is generally sampled on the docks during\r\nunloading, although this is sometimes postponed until the consignment is\r\nin the warehouse. It is then graded and priced, and is offered for sale\r\nby samples through brokers.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco is better equipped with modern unloading machinery and\r\nother apparatus than either New Orleans or New York, even more liberal\r\nuse being made there than in New Orleans of the automatic-belt conveyors\r\nboth for transferring the bags from the ships to the docks and for\r\nstacking them in high tiers on the pier. Another notable feature of the\r\nmodern coffee docks is that the newer ones are of steel and concrete\r\nand, as in New Orleans, are covered to protect the coffee from wind and\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Europe's Great Coffee Markets_\r\n\r\nEurope has three great coffee-trading markets--Havre, Hamburg, and\r\nAntwerp. Rotterdam and Amsterdam are also important coffee centers, but\r\nrank far below the others named. In point of volume of stocks, Havre led\r\nthe world before the war; while in respect to commercial transactions,\r\nit ranked second, with New York first. In pre-war days, the largest part\r\nof the world's visible supply of coffee was stored in the Havre bonded\r\nwarehouses, being available for shipment to any part of Europe on short\r\nnotice, or even to the United States in emergencies. Even during the\r\nWorld War, this French port remained a powerful factor in international\r\ncoffee trading. Coffee trading in Havre, both exchange and \"spot\"\r\ntransactions, follows about the same general lines as in New York and\r\nthe other great coffee markets. Coffee \"futures\" are dealt in on the\r\nHavre Bourse.\r\n\r\nGreen coffee is sold in London by auction in Mincing Lane. On arrival,\r\nit is stored in bonded warehouses, and is released for domestic use only\r\nwhen customs duty at the rate of four and one-half pence per pound has\r\nbeen paid. The bulk of the coffee comes in parchment on consignment; and\r\nbefore sale, it must be hulled and sorted in the milling establishments,\r\nmost of which are on the banks of the Thames.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE MODERN DEVICES USED IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR\r\nHANDLING GREEN COFFEE]\r\n\r\nThe auctions are held four times a week, usually on Tuesday, Wednesday,\r\nThursday, and Friday. The sales are advertised in the market\r\npapers--chief among which is the _Public Ledger_--and also by the\r\nauctioneers, who issue catalogs of their offerings. A few hours before\r\nthe beginning of the sale, samples are laid out for inspection by\r\nprospective buyers, who may cup-test them if they desire. The actual\r\nselling is done by competitive cash bidding, the highest bidder becoming\r\nthe owner. Two classes of brokers do the bidding, one for home trade and\r\nthe other for exporters.\r\n\r\nHome trade takes about a tenth of the coffee, the remainder being sold\r\nfor export. If the coffee is bought for re-export, it can be transferred\r\nto the shipping port, still in bond, and shipped out of the country\r\nwithout paying duty. During the World War, auctions were held about\r\ntwice a week; but after the signing of the armistice in November 1918,\r\nthe London traders resumed the four times a week practise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE AUCTION SAMPLES ON DISPLAY AT AMSTERDAM]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREEN COFFEE STORED ON THE DOCKS AT HAVRE, FRANCE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HANDLING GREEN COFFEE AT TWO EUROPEAN PORTS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Exchanges and Trading Methods_\r\n\r\nGreen-coffee buyers in the large importing centers of the United States\r\nand Europe recognize two distinct markets in their operations. One of\r\nthese is called the \"spot\" market; because the importers, brokers,\r\njobbers, and roasters trading there deal in actual coffee in warehouses\r\nin the consuming country. In New York the spot market is located in the\r\ndistrict of lower Wall Street, which includes a block or two each side\r\non Front and Water Streets. Here, coffee importers, coffee roasters,\r\ncoffee dealers, and coffee brokers conduct their \"street\" sales.\r\n\r\nThe other market is designated as the \"futures\" market; and the trading\r\nis not concerned with actual coffee, but with the purchase or sale of\r\ncontracts for future delivery of coffee that may still be on the trees\r\nin the producing country. Futures, or \"options\" as they are frequently\r\ncalled, are dealt in only on a coffee exchange. The principal exchanges\r\nare in New York, Havre, and Hamburg. New Orleans and San Francisco\r\nexchange dealers trade on their local boards of trade.\r\n\r\nCoffee-exchange contracts are dealt in just like stocks and bonds. They\r\nare settled by the payment of the difference, or \"margin\"; and the\r\noption of delivering actual coffee is seldom exercised. Generally, the\r\noperations are either in the nature of ordinary speculation on margin or\r\nfor the legitimate purpose of effecting \"hedges\" against holdings or\r\nshort sales of actual coffees.\r\n\r\nThe New York Coffee and Sugar Exchange--the most important in the world,\r\nbecause of the volume of its business--deals in all coffees from North,\r\nSouth, and Central America, the West Indies and the East Indies (except\r\nthose of the Robusta variety) and uses Type No. 7 as the basis for all\r\nExchange quotations. All other types are judged in relation to it. In\r\ndetermining the number of a type, the coffee is graded by the number of\r\nimperfections contained in it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW YORK COFFEE AND SUGAR EXCHANGE\r\n\r\nThe building fronts on Hanover Square and extends through to Beaver\r\nStreet. The exchange rooms are indicated by the arched windows on the\r\nsecond floor. The rest of the building is devoted to offices. The\r\nexchange was founded in 1881, and was the first national coffee trading\r\norganization in the world.]\r\n\r\nThese imperfections are black beans, broken beans, shells, immature\r\nbeans (\"quakers\"), stones, and pods. For counting the imperfections, the\r\nblack bean has been taken as the basis unit, and all imperfections, no\r\nmatter what they may be, are calculated in terms of black beans,\r\naccording to a scale, which is practically as follows:\r\n\r\nBLACK-BEAN SCALE\r\n\r\n3 shells equal                    1 black bean\r\n5 \"quakers\" equal                 1   \"    \"\r\n5 broken beans equal              1   \"    \"\r\n1 pod equals                      1   \"    \"\r\n1 medium size stone equals        1   \"    \"\r\n2 small stones equal              1   \"    \"\r\n1 large stone equals         2 to 3   \"    \"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COFFEE PIT IN THE NEW YORK COFFEE AND SUGAR EXCHANGE]\r\n\r\nBy this scale a coffee containing no imperfections would be classified\r\nas Type No. 1. The test is made on one-pound samples. If a sample shows\r\nsix black beans, or equivalent imperfections, it is graded as No. 2; if\r\nthirteen black beans, as No. 3; if twenty-nine black beans, as No. 4; if\r\nsixty black beans, as No. 5; if one hundred and ten black beans, as No.\r\n6, and if more than one hundred and ten black beans, as No. 7 or No. 8.\r\nThese two are graded by comparison with recognized exchange types.\r\nCoffees grading lower than No. 8 are not admissible to this country.\r\n\r\nThe quotation relationship of other types with the basic Rio No. 7 is\r\nshown in the table below.\r\n\r\nBy this scale one can determine that when Rio No. 7 is quoted at 17.10,\r\nRio No. 2 is 18.60, Santos No. 3, 19.10, and Bogota No. 5, 18.10. The\r\nquotations are on the pound and cents basis.\r\n\r\nSCALE OF QUOTATION RELATIONSHIP\r\n\r\nBRAZILIAN COFFEE--         SANTOS COFFEE              OTHER KINDS--NOT\r\n NOT SANTOS                                              BRAZILIAN\r\nType                       Type                     Type\r\nNo. 1--180 points above    No. 1--260 points above  No. 1--300 points above\r\nNo. 2--150 points above    No. 2--230 points above  No. 2--250 points above\r\nNo. 3--120 points above    No. 3--200 points above  No. 3--200 points above\r\nNo. 4---90 points above    No. 4--150 points above  No. 4--150 points above\r\nNo. 5---60 points above    No. 5--100 points above  No. 5--100 points above\r\nNo. 6---30 points above    No. 6-- 50 points above  No. 6--50 points above\r\nNo. 7---Basis              No. 7--Basis             No. 7--Basis\r\nNo. 8---50 points below    No. 8--50 points below   No. 8--50 points below\r\n\r\n           A point is the hundredth part of a cent\r\n\r\nIn the spot market, a trader may also buy or sell coffee \"to arrive\";\r\nthat is, a consignment that is aboard ship on the way to the market.\r\nCoffee is shipped to New York either on a consignment basis and sold\r\nfor a commission, or it may have been bought in the shipping port and be\r\nalready the property of an importer. When shipped on consignment, a\r\nwholesaler usually buys on the in-store contract, which provides that\r\nthe purchaser must take delivery at the warehouse, though he is\r\ngenerally given a month's storage privilege before removal of the\r\ncoffee. The practise among New York importers at present is to buy\r\ncoffee on either the basis of F.O.B. delivery steamer at loading port,\r\nor delivery C. & F. (cost and freight), or C.I.F. (cost, insurance, and\r\nfreight), port of destination. Payment is made by letter of credit drawn\r\non a New York or London bank, entitling the exporter to draw at ninety\r\ndays' sight against the shipping documents, so that the shipment will be\r\nin the hands of the purchaser long before the draft is made. Frequently\r\na jobber acts as his own importer of Brazil coffee, buying direct from\r\nthe exporter without utilizing the agency of a broker or a regular\r\nimporting firm.\r\n\r\nBrazil coffee is bought with the stipulation that differences between\r\nsamples and the coffee actually delivered may be adjusted either on\r\n\"Brazil grading,\" \"half difference,\" or \"full difference\"; and with the\r\nfurther provision that, if the delivery is a full type higher or lower\r\nthan specified in the contract, the entire shipment may be rejected.\r\nUnder the \"Brazil grading\" provision, the buyer must accept delivery if\r\nthe coffee is better than the next lower type, even though not up to the\r\ntype ordered; and if the coffee is of a higher type than contracted for,\r\nhe need not pay premium for it. In buying on the \"half difference\" or\r\n\"full difference\" basis, the buyer is entitled to payment for half the\r\ndifference or the full difference, respectively, for any undergrading,\r\nor must pay the seller accordingly if there is any overgrading. When a\r\nbuyer specifies special features of description, in addition to type,\r\nsome sellers protect themselves against claims for difference on this\r\nscore by inserting in the contract a clause to the effect that the\r\ndescription is given in good faith, but is not guaranteed by the seller.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO OF THE COFFEE EXCHANGE BLACKBOARDS\r\n\r\nThe one on the right is a record of transactions in the coffee pit. As\r\nsoon as a trade is made, it is noted in the proper column on the lower\r\npart, the entry showing the time of the transaction, the number of\r\n\"250-pound bag lots,\" and the price.

For a detailed description of these and other\r\nexchange quotation boards, see page 457]\r\n\r\n\r\n_How the New York Exchange Functions_\r\n\r\nWhen the New York Coffee Exchange was incorporated in 1881, its charter\r\nstated its purposes to be \"to provide, regulate and maintain a suitable\r\nbuilding, room or rooms for the purchase and sales of coffees and other\r\nsimilar grocery articles in the city of New York, to adjust\r\ncontroversies between members, to inculcate and establish just and\r\nequitable principles in the trade, to establish and maintain uniformity\r\nin its rules, regulations and usages, to adopt standards of\r\nclassification, to acquire, preserve and disseminate useful and valuable\r\nbusiness information, and generally to promote the above mentioned trade\r\nin the city of New York, increase its amount, and augment the facilities\r\nwith which it may be conducted.\"\r\n\r\nIn the promotion of trade at New York the Exchange has been highly\r\nsuccessful. From time to time it has been criticized; and, more than\r\nonce, coffee traders in the East and in the West have raised a question\r\nas to its value to non-speculating members. There are those who believe\r\nit serves a useful purpose, and others who call it a huge pool room. To\r\nsay that, on the whole, it is not of benefit to the trade would be\r\nuntrue. As one of its champions pointed out in 1914, when it shut down\r\nfor a period of four months on account of the World War:\r\n\r\n     The ability to discount the future is a necessity, and demands the\r\n     facilities that a unit of centralization like the Exchange affords.\r\n     There is no difference between a purchase of coffee and one of a\r\n     future month on options.\r\n\r\n     The experience gained here and abroad demonstrates that any check\r\n     placed upon such dealings is detrimental, with far-reaching effects\r\n     upon the whole body of the trade. Unquestionably the Exchange is a\r\n     powerful factor as a regulator of extremes in the market.\r\n\r\n     The experience gained in Germany, where an embargo was placed upon\r\n     transactions in futures, is illuminating. The disastrous effects\r\n     were so plain that the authorities were forced to abandon their\r\n     objections and permit a resumption of the business along the old\r\n     lines.\r\n\r\n     But a good thing can be abused, and the opportunity to gamble in\r\n     options availed of by so many is the increment that disturbs the\r\n     legitimacy of the market and creates the opposition to the whole\r\n     proposition. When the Exchange is ready to insist that every\r\n     transaction in futures must be a legitimate one, and that every\r\n     trader under its jurisdiction using the facilities of the Exchange\r\n     is made to realize that any operations that are purely of a\r\n     gambling nature will subject him to severe discipline, then the\r\n     Coffee Exchange will begin to stem the tide of an ever-growing\r\n     opposition by the general public.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE \"COFFEE AFLOAT\" BLACKBOARD]\r\n\r\nThe New York State legislative committee on speculations in securities\r\nand commodities had the following to say on the Coffee Exchange in its\r\nreport to Governor Charles E. Hughes in 1909:\r\n\r\n     It [the Coffee Exchange] was established in order to supply a daily\r\n     market where coffee could be bought and sold and to fix quotations\r\n     therefor, in distinction from the former method of alternate glut\r\n     and scarcity, with wide variations in price--in short, to create\r\n     stability and certainty in trading in an important article of\r\n     commerce. This it has accomplished; and it has made New York the\r\n     most important primary coffee market in the United States. But\r\n     there has been recently introduced a non-commercial factor known as\r\n     \"valorization,\" a governmental scheme of Brazil, by which the\r\n     public treasury has assumed to purchase and hold a certain\r\n     percentage of the coffee grown there, in order to prevent a decline\r\n     of the price. This has created abnormal conditions in the coffee\r\n     trade.\r\n\r\n     All transactions must be reported by the seller to the\r\n     superintendent of the Exchange, with an exact statement of the time\r\n     and terms of delivery. The record shows that the average annual\r\n     sales in the past five years have been in excess of 16,000,000 bags\r\n     of 130 pounds each.\r\n\r\n     Contracts may be transferred or offset by voluntary clearings by\r\n     groups of members. There is no general clearing system.[319] There\r\n     is a commendable rule providing that, in case of a \"corner,\" the\r\n     officials may fix a settlement price for contracts to avoid\r\n     disastrous failures.\r\n\r\nThe original initiation fee was $250. Seats on the Exchange once sold\r\nfor as low as $110. In January, 1916, there was a sale at $3,000; in\r\nOctober, 1916, there was a sale for $5,000; in April, 1921, three seats\r\nwere sold for $5,500 each; but the record price of $8,600 was paid in\r\n1919. Seats are now (1922) worth about $6,000.\r\n\r\nThe Exchange includes in its membership 323 brokers, importers, dealers,\r\nand roasters. Membership is passed upon by a committee on membership;\r\nbut any one twenty-one years old, resident or non-resident, of good\r\ncharacter and commercial standing, is eligible when proposed and\r\nseconded by Exchange members. The committee refers the application with\r\nits recommendation to the board of managers, which takes a ballot. The\r\nadverse vote of one-third of all votes cast rejects.\r\n\r\nThe Exchange elects annually a president, a vice-president, and a\r\ntreasurer, who perform the usual duties of Exchange officers. The real\r\ngoverning body is the board of managers, consisting of the president,\r\nvice-president, treasurer, and twelve other members. This governing\r\nboard, meeting monthly, appoints the necessary subordinate officers and\r\nemployees, and fixes their compensation, and may \"summon before them any\r\nofficer or member for any purpose whatsoever.\" It appoints the secretary\r\nof the Exchange from among its own number, a superintendent of the\r\nExchange, and the numerous committees which are in active charge of\r\nspecified activities. It also licenses the necessary coffee graders,\r\nwarehousemen, weighmasters, and samplers of the Exchange.\r\n\r\nA brief discussion of the duties of the superintendent and the various\r\ncommittees will help to explain the methods of the Exchange market. The\r\nsuperintendent, under the direction of the board of managers, has charge\r\nof the details of its work and of that of the various committees. He\r\nkeeps all the books and documents of the Exchange; collects and pays\r\nover to the treasurer all moneys due the Exchange not otherwise provided\r\nfor; receives, deposits, and pays over all margins on coffee contracts;\r\nhas active charge of the Exchange rooms and the bulletin board; and\r\nmanages and appoints, with the consent of the board of managers, the\r\nassistants needed to perform the details of the work under his charge.\r\n\r\nOne of the functions of the Exchange is to grade and to classify coffee,\r\nin which it takes every possible precaution. The rules provide for eight\r\nstandard grades; and only licensed graders are permitted to pass upon\r\nthe product handled on the Exchange. There are twenty-five of these\r\ngraders; one of whom is appointed as a supervisor of types, to provide\r\nfresh standards and to \"maintain them as nearly as possible on an\r\nequality.\" When these standards are approved by the board and the\r\nExchange, they remain in force for a year.\r\n\r\nWhen coffee is received at a licensed warehouse, two official graders\r\nare chosen, one by the buyer and one by the seller. These graders\r\nreceive four cents a bag if employed by a member; and eight cents a bag,\r\nif employed by a non-member.\r\n\r\nIf the graders disagree, their differences are referred to the board of\r\ncoffee arbitrators, consisting of ten experts appointed by the board of\r\nmanagers. The superintendent selects by lot three of these arbitrators,\r\nwho decide on the basis of the samples submitted, but will not make a\r\ndecision lowering the grade below that of the lowest submitted nor\r\nhigher than the highest. If the disputants do not change the grading to\r\ncome within the arbitrators' findings, the samples are sent to the\r\nentire board of arbitrators, exclusive of those who may have been the\r\noriginal graders, and final decision is made by majority vote. As soon\r\nas the coffee is graded, a certificate is issued stating the grades, and\r\nbearing the signatures of the superintendent and graders. This\r\ncertificate is conclusive evidence of the grade as far as the parties\r\ninvolved are concerned, for the subsequent twelve months. The buyer\r\nreceives the original, and the seller a duplicate.\r\n\r\nThe rules provide that weights decided upon at the initial delivery are\r\ngood during the life of the grading certificate for re-delivery, with\r\ndefinite allowances to the receiver, on re-delivery, of a quarter of a\r\npound a bag a month, instead of having to re-weigh and re-sample for\r\nevery separate delivery, as formerly.\r\n\r\nAs claims and trade controversies occasionally arise, the Exchange has\r\nprovided means for their peaceful settlement. The board of managers\r\nelects annually an arbitration committee of five members, who swear to\r\ndecide disputes fairly. This is the only committee on the Exchange that\r\nhas power to adjudicate disputes between members and non-members; and\r\nits services must be sought by the disputants, who must agree to abide\r\nby its decision. An adjudication committee of seven is annually chosen\r\nfrom the membership by the managers, to adjust all claims and\r\ncontroversies between members arising out of any merchandise\r\ntransaction, \"if notice in writing of such claim or controversy, and of\r\nthe intention to demand an adjudication thereon, be served by either\r\nparty thereto within ten days from the ascertainment thereof.\"\r\n\r\nWithin three days of the serving of this notice, each disputant selects\r\nan Exchange member as his adjudicator; and these two name the third, who\r\nmust be a member of the adjudicating committee. Even this decision may\r\nbe appealed to the board of managers, which, if it finds the grounds of\r\nappeal good (as decided by majority vote), appoints an appeal committee\r\nof five, of whom three must be members of the board. This last\r\ncommittee's decision is final. No new testimony bearing on the case may\r\nbe introduced after the case has been closed by the adjudicators.\r\nArbitration is voluntary with both parties; while adjudication is\r\ncompulsory upon the application of either.\r\n\r\nAnother committee of trade importance is the spot quotation committee of\r\nfive Exchange members. Each day at two o'clock, except on Saturday, when\r\nit meets at 11:45, this committee by a majority vote establishes the\r\nofficial daily market quotation of No. 7 coffee. There is likewise a\r\ncommittee on quotations of futures. This committee of five meets daily\r\n\"immediately after the first call and at the close of the Exchange and\r\nreports to the superintendent the tone and price of the contract market,\r\nto be posted on the blackboard and transmitted to other Exchanges and\r\ncommercial bodies.\"\r\n\r\nA committee of five on trade and statistics has the important function\r\nof reporting to the board as to regulations for the \"purchase, sale,\r\ntransportation and custody of merchandise,\" and it attempts to establish\r\nuniformity in such matters between different markets. It has charge also\r\nof \"all matters pertaining to the supply of newspapers, market reports,\r\ntelegraphic and statistical information for the use of the Exchange. In\r\nthe early 80's the Exchange abolished the old method of keeping coffee\r\nstatistics, and the basis then adopted has since been accepted by all\r\nthe large coffee markets of the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe minimum rates of commission on coffee \"per contract of 250 bags, for\r\nmembers of the Exchange residing in the United States, are based upon a\r\nprice\" as follows, quoting from the Exchange bylaws adopted June 8,\r\n1920:\r\n\r\nCOFFEE EXCHANGE COMMISSION RATES\r\n    (Per contract of 250 bags)\r\n\r\n                                             Floor\r\n                            Commission      brokerage\r\n                            for buying      for buying\r\n                            or selling      or selling\r\nBelow 10 cents                   $6.25        $1.50\r\n10 cents up to 19.99 cents        7.50         1.75\r\n20 cents and above               10.00         2.00\r\n\r\n     For non-members residing within the United States, double the above\r\n     rates of commission shall be charged.\r\n\r\n     For members and non-members residing outside of the United States a\r\n     commission of $2.50 shall be charged in addition to the above\r\n     rates.\r\n\r\n     Whenever before thirty minutes after the close of the exchange a\r\n     member gives to another member for clearance purchases and sales of\r\n     contracts corresponding in all respects except as to price, made\r\n     during the day by himself or for his account _when present on the\r\n     floor_ of the Exchange, a charge for each contract shall be made\r\n     equal to the corresponding floor brokerage rate for buying and\r\n     selling, in addition to any floor brokerage incurred.\r\n\r\n     Members procuring business for other members may, by agreement, be\r\n     entitled to one-half the commission rates for non-members\r\n     prescribed in this Section, less the corresponding brokerage\r\n     charge, whether paid or not.\r\n\r\n     When a transferable notice is given or received by a customer in\r\n     fulfillment of a contract the brokerage in that case shall be not\r\n     less than one-half of the corresponding buying or selling\r\n     commission prescribed in Section 103.\r\n\r\nOther committees are the finance committee (two) to audit bills and\r\nclaims against the Exchange, to direct deposits and investments, and to\r\naudit the monthly and yearly accounts of the treasurer; a law committee\r\n(three), to deal with matters of legislation; a membership and floor\r\ncommittee (five); and a nominating committee (five). Organized as above\r\noutlined, and with a well established code of trade rules, the Exchange\r\nannually transacts a large number of sales in a business-like way.\r\n\r\nThere is considerable trading in future contracts; and a standard form\r\nhas been adopted by the Exchange. No future contracts are valid unless\r\nthey are made in the following form:\r\n\r\nBRAZILIAN COFFEE--NOT SANTOS\r\n               Office of _____________\r\n            New York__________    19__\r\nSold for M_______________________\r\n      To M_______________________\r\n\r\n     Thirty-two thousand five hundred pounds in about 250 bags coffee,\r\n     growth of North, South or Central America, West Indies or East\r\n     Indies, excepting coffee known as \"Robusta,\" and also any coffee of\r\n     new or unknown growth, deliverable from licensed warehouse in the\r\n     port of New York, between the first and last days of ________ next,\r\n     inclusive. The delivery within such time to be at seller's option,\r\n     upon a notice to buyer of either five, six or seven days, as may be\r\n     prescribed by the trade rules. The coffee to be of any grade, from\r\n     No. 8 to No. 1 inclusive (no coffee to grade below No. 8) provided\r\n     the average grade of Brazilian coffees shall not be above No. 3.\r\n     Nothing in this contract, however, shall be construed as\r\n     prohibiting a delivery averaging above No. 3 at the No. 3 grade. At\r\n     the rate of __________ cents per pound for No. 7, with additions or\r\n     deductions for other grades according to the rates of the New York\r\n     Coffee and Sugar Exchange, Inc., existing on the afternoon of the\r\n     day previous to the date of the notice of delivery. Either party to\r\n     have the right to call for margins as the variations of the market\r\n     for like deliveries may warrant, which margins shall be kept good.\r\n\r\n     This contract is made in view of, and in all respect subject to the\r\n     rules and conditions established by the New York Coffee and Sugar\r\n     Exchange, Inc., and in full accordance with section 102 of the\r\n     bylaws.\r\n\r\n_____________________________\r\n        Brokers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcross the face is the following:\r\n\r\n     For and in consideration of one dollar to __________________ in\r\n     hand paid, receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, ______________\r\n     accept this contract with all its obligations and conditions.\r\n\r\nAll deliveries on such future contracts must be made from licensed\r\nwarehouses. There is a separate \"to arrive contract\"; but this likewise\r\nrequires delivery at a licensed warehouse, unless the buyer and the\r\nseller have a mutual understanding to deliver the coffee from dock or\r\nex-ship. Margins to protect the contract may be called for by either\r\nparty. The largest deposit for margins was made in 1904, when\r\n$22,661,710 was deposited with the superintendent as required by the\r\nExchange rules.\r\n\r\nThe basic grade in a future sale is No. 7; but variations are provided\r\nas follows: 30 points for Rio, Victoria, and Bahia of all grades between\r\n7 and 1, and of 50 points between 7 and 8; 50 points is allowed on\r\nSantos and all other coffees except between grades 1 and 2 and 2 and 3\r\nSantos, which are allowed 30 points. Thus the buyer and the seller when\r\nentering upon a transaction know exactly what the difference will be\r\nbetween the standard No. 7 and the coffee that can be delivered. The\r\nright to deliver any grade in a future transaction has done much to\r\nlessen the probability of corners in coffee; but this protection is\r\nfurther given by the stringent rule that the maximum fluctuations on the\r\nExchange can be only two cents a pound on coffee in one day and one cent\r\non sugar. If greater changes should threaten, the Exchange operations\r\nwould automatically cease.\r\n\r\nFalse or fictitious sales are prohibited, and all contracts must be\r\nreported to the superintendent. All contracts are binding and call for\r\nactual delivery.\r\n\r\nThe future contract, besides being used for the delivery of coffee\r\nduring stated months in the future at a given price, is also used for\r\nhedging purposes. As in the grain and cotton markets, dealers protect\r\nthemselves against price fluctuations by hedging in the future market.\r\nImporters, for instance, when purchasing coffee abroad, frequently sell\r\nan equal amount for future delivery on the Exchange. When the time for\r\ndelivery arrives, it is simply a question of calculation of the market\r\nconditions whether it is more advantageous to repurchase the sales made\r\nas a hedge, or as a kind of insurance to protect themselves against\r\nloss, and free the coffee so engaged, or to make delivery of the coffee\r\nas it comes in.\r\n\r\nThe board of managers has power to close the Exchange or to suspend\r\ntrading on such days or parts of days as would in their judgment be for\r\nthe Exchange's best interest.\r\n\r\nThe Clearing Association is a recent outgrowth of the Exchange, and is\r\ncomposed exclusively of Exchange members. Every member has to bring his\r\ncontracts up to market closing every night, either by making a deposit\r\nwith the Association to cover his balances, or by withdrawing in case he\r\nshould be over. Members deposit $15,000 at the time of joining as a\r\nguaranty fund; and if the surplus is not sufficient to take care of\r\nbalances, the bylaws provide for the levying of assessments.\r\n\r\nThe daily quotations on the coffee exchanges of New York, Havre, and\r\n(before the war) of Hamburg, determined to a large extent the price of\r\ngreen coffee the world over. The prices prevailing on the New York\r\nCoffee and Sugar Exchange are studied by coffee traders in all\r\ncountries, the fluctuations being reflected in foreign markets as the\r\nreports come from the United States. Quotations are cabled from one\r\ngreat market to another; and as each must heed those of the others to\r\nsome extent, the coffee trade thus obtains a world price, and the\r\neffect on supply and demand is universal rather than local, as would be\r\nthe case if quotations were not exchanged.\r\n\r\nIn 1921 the Exchange adopted an amendment to the trade rules, and\r\nabolished the one day transferable notice for both coffee and sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Foreign Coffee Quotations_\r\n\r\nBrazil coffee cable quotations are the market prices, in Rio or Santos,\r\nof ten kilograms of coffee, the price being stated in milreis, the\r\nmonetary unit of Brazil money. The basic grade of coffee at Rio is the\r\nNo. 7 of the New York Coffee Exchange; and at Santos, the international\r\nstandard of good average (\"g. a.\") Santos. One kilogram (often written\r\nkilo, or abbreviated to K.) is equal to two and one-fifth pounds; and\r\nthe ten-kilogram standard of quantity is, therefore, equivalent to\r\ntwenty-two pounds, or just one-sixth of a standard Brazil bag.\r\n\r\nThe money value is not so simple, since Brazilian paper currency is\r\nunstable; and the milreis quotation means nothing unless it is\r\nconsidered in connection with the rate of exchange for the same day,\r\ni.e., the current gold value of the milreis. This gold value is always\r\ngiven with the daily quotations from Brazil, and is expressed in British\r\npence. The par value of the milreis (1000 reis) is 54.6 cents (gold) of\r\nUnited States money; but its present actual value is only about 15\r\ncents, and it has been as low as 11-1/4 cents. Our dollar sign is used\r\nto denote milreis, placing it after the whole number, and before the\r\nfractional part expressed in one-thousandths. Thus, 8-1/4 milreis would\r\nbe written 8$250 RS.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for example, a Rio quotation is given at 8$400, with exchange\r\nat 7-1/2 d. This means that 22 pounds of coffee have a gold value of 63\r\nBritish pence (8.4 × 7-1/2 = 63.0), or 5/3, as the Englishman would\r\nwrite it, which is equal to $1.27-1/2, making the coffee worth 5.8 cents\r\nper pound. Of course the person familiar with Brazil quotations will not\r\nneed to make this reduction to the pound-cent term in order to\r\nunderstand the figures. They will have a proper relative meaning to him\r\nin their original form; and it must not be overlooked that it is in this\r\nform only that they express correctly the value of the coffee in Brazil.\r\nIt may make a great difference to the Brazilian planter or exporter\r\nwhether an increased gold value of his coffee arises through a higher\r\nmilreis bid or an appreciated exchange, simply on account of local\r\ncurrency considerations. That is to say, the purchasing power of a\r\nmilreis in Brazil will not necessarily vary exactly as the rate of\r\nexchange on London.\r\n\r\nLondon quotations are made in shillings and pence, on one hundred-weight\r\n(cwt) of coffee. This \"cwt\" is not 100 pounds but 112 pounds, one\r\ntwentieth of the English ton (our long ton) of 2,240 pounds. And in all\r\nEnglish coffee statistics the coffee quantities are expressed in this\r\nton. A London quotation of 30/9 (30 shillings and 9 pence) for example,\r\nis equivalent to $7.44 for 112 pounds of coffee, or 6.64 cents per pound\r\nat the normal rate of exchange, $4.80 to $4.86 the pound sterling.\r\n\r\nAt Havre, the coffee price is given in francs, on a quantity of 50\r\nkilograms. This is 110 pounds and almost as much, therefore, as the\r\nBritish cwt. In normal times the franc is equal to 19.3 cents. A French\r\nquotation of 37-1/2, for instance, means, therefore, $7.19 for 110\r\npounds of coffee, or 6.53 cents per pound.\r\n\r\nThe Hamburg quotation (formerly from Brazil per fifty kilos) is made on\r\none pound German, equal to 1/2 kilogram, and is expressed in pfennigs.\r\nOne pfennig is one-hundredth of a mark, and the mark once was equal to\r\n23.8 cents. A German quotation of, say, 31, means, therefore, 7.38 cents\r\n(31 × .238 = 7.378) for 1.1 pounds, or 6.71 cents per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Three Kinds of Brokers_\r\n\r\nIn the coffee trade there are three kinds of brokers--floor, spot, and\r\ncost and freight.\r\n\r\nFloor brokers are those who buy and sell options on the Coffee Exchange\r\nfor a fixed consideration per lot of 250 bags. The coffee commission\r\nrate put into effect June 8, 1920, for round term (buying and selling)\r\nby the New York Coffee Exchange was as follows:\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION RATE ON 250 BAGS\r\n\r\n(For Round Term--Buying and Selling)\r\n\r\n                          Up to         10¢ to\r\n                          9.99c         19.99c        20c & up\r\n                          per lb.       per lb.       per lb.\r\nMembers                   $12.50        $15.00        $20.00\r\nNon-members                25.00         30.00         40.00\r\nForeign members            17.50         20.00         25.00\r\nForeign non-members        30.00         35.00         45.00\r\nFloor brokerage--\r\nBuying or selling           1.50          1.75          2.00\r\n\r\nThere is at present (1922) a stamp tax of two cents on each hundred\r\ndollars value, or fraction thereof, figured on each separate lot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUN-CURING THE WASHED GREEN BEANS ON CEMENT DRYING\r\nPATIOS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEAR VIEW OF HEAVILY LADEN TREES READY FOR THE PICKERS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TYPICAL COFFEE SCENES IN COSTA RICA]\r\n\r\nSpot brokers are those who deal in actual coffee, selling from jobber\r\nto jobber, or representing out-of-town houses; the seller paying a\r\ncommission of about fifteen cents a bag in small lots, and half of one\r\npercent in large lots.\r\n\r\nCost and freight brokers represent Brazilian accounts, and generally\r\nreceive a brokerage of one and one-quarter percent. On out-of-town\r\nbusiness, they usually split the commission with the out-of-town or\r\n\"local\" brokers. The out-of-town brokers sometimes, however, deal direct\r\nwith the importer. All brokers except floor brokers are sometimes called\r\n\"street brokers.\" Most of the large New York, New Orleans, and San\r\nFrancisco brokerage houses also do a commission business, handling one\r\nor more Brazilian or other coffee-producing-country accounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Important Rulings Affecting Coffee Trading_\r\n\r\nThe United States have no coffee law as they have a tea law--prescribing\r\n\"purity, quality and fitness for consumption\"--but buyers and sellers of\r\ngreen coffees are required to observe certain well defined federal rules\r\nand regulations relating specifically to coffee. Up to the year 1906,\r\nwhen the Pure Food and Drugs Act became law, the green coffee trade was\r\npractically unhampered; and several irregularities developed, calling\r\ninto existence federal laws that were designed to protect the consumer\r\nagainst trade abuses, and at the same time to raise the standards of\r\ncoffee trading.\r\n\r\nUnder these regulations it is illegal to import into this country a\r\ncoffee that grades below a No. 8 Exchange type, which generally contains\r\na large proportion of sour or damaged beans, known in the trade as\r\n\"black jack,\" or damaged coffee, as found in \"skimmings.\" \"Black jack\"\r\nis a term applied to coffee that has turned black during the process of\r\ncuring, or in the hold of a ship during transportation; or it may be due\r\nto a blighting disease.\r\n\r\nAnother ruling is intended to prevent the sale of artificially \"sweated\"\r\ncoffee, which has been submitted to a steaming process to give the beans\r\nthe extra-brown appearance of high grade East Indian and Mocha coffees\r\nwhich have been naturally \"sweated\" in the holds of sailing vessels\r\nduring the long journey to American ports. Up to the time that the Pure\r\nFood and Drugs Act went into effect, artificial \"sweating\" was resorted\r\nto by some coffee firms; and out of that practise grew a suit[320] that\r\nresulted in a federal court decision sustaining the Pure Food Act, and\r\nclassifying the practise as adulteration and misbranding.\r\n\r\nThe Act also is intended to prevent the sale of coffees under trade\r\nnames that do not properly belong to them. For example, only coffees\r\ngrown on the island of Java can properly be labeled and sold as Javas;\r\ncoffees from Sumatra, Timor, etc., must be sold under their respective\r\nnames. Food Inspection Decision No. 82, which limited the use of the\r\nterm Java to coffee grown on the island of Java, was sustained in a\r\nservice and regulatory announcement issued in January, 1916. Likewise\r\nthe name Mocha may be used only for coffees of Arabia. Before the\r\npure-food law was enacted, it was frequently the custom to mix Bourbon\r\nSantos with Mocha and to sell the blend as Mocha. Also, Abyssinian\r\ncoffees were generally known in the trade as Longberry Mocha, or just\r\nstraight Mocha; and Sumatra growths were practically always sold as\r\nJavas. Traders used the names of Mocha and Java because of the high\r\nvalue placed upon these coffees by consumers, who, before Brazil\r\ndominated the market, had practically no other names for coffee.\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated coffee cases under the Pure Food Act was\r\ntried in Chicago, February, 1912. The question was, whether in view of\r\nthe long-standing trade custom, it was still proper to call an\r\nAbyssinian coffee (Longberry Mocha) Mocha. The defendant was charged\r\nwith misbranding, because he sold as Java and Mocha a coffee containing\r\nAbyssinian coffee. The court decided that the product should be called\r\nAbyssinian Mocha;[321] but since then, general acceptance has obtained\r\nof the government's viewpoint as expressed in F.I.D. No. 91, which was\r\nthat only coffee grown in the province of Yemen in Arabia could properly\r\nbe known as Mocha coffee.\r\n\r\nAnother important ruling, concerning coffee buyers and sellers,\r\nprohibits the importation of green coffees coated with lead chromate,\r\nPrussian blue, and other substances, to give the beans a more stylish\r\nappearance than they have normally. Such \"polished\" coffees find great\r\nfavor in the European markets, but are now denied admittance here.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Food and Drug Inspection decided in 1910 against a trade\r\ncustom that had prevailed until then of calling Minãs coffee Santos when\r\nshipped through Santos, instead of Rio.[322]\r\n\r\nFor years a practise obtained of rebagging certain Central American\r\ngrowths in New York. In this way Bucaramangas frequently were\r\ntransformed into Bogotas, Rios became Santos, Bahias and Victorias were\r\nsold as Rios, and the misbranding of peaberry was quite common. A\r\ncelebrated case grew out of an attempt by a New York coffee importer and\r\nbroker to continue one of these practises after the Pure Food Act made\r\nit a criminal offense. The defendants, who were found guilty of\r\nconspiracy, and who were fined three thousand dollars each, mixed,\r\nre-packed and sold under the name P.A.L. Bogota, a well known Colombian\r\nmark, eighty-four bags of washed Caracas coffee.[323]\r\n\r\nAfter an exchange of views with the United States Board of Food and Drug\r\nInspection, the New York Coffee Exchange decided that, after June 1,\r\n1912, it would abolish all grades of coffee under the Exchange type No.\r\n8.\r\n\r\nThe practise in Holland of grading Santos coffees--by selecting beans\r\nmost like Java beans, and polishing and coloring them to add\r\nverisimilitude--known as \"manipulated Java,\" became such a nuisance in\r\n1912 that United States consuls refused to certify invoices to the\r\nUnited States unless accompanied by a declaration that the produce was\r\n\"pure Java, neither mixed with other kinds nor counterfeited.\"\r\n\r\nThe United States Bureau of Chemistry ruled in February, 1921, that\r\n_Coffea robusta_ could not be sold as Java coffee, or under any form of\r\nlabeling which tended either directly or indirectly to create the\r\nimpression that it was _Coffea arabica_, so long and favorably known as\r\nJava coffee. This was in line with the Department of Agriculture's\r\nprevious definition that coffee was the seed of the _Coffea arabica_ or\r\n_Coffea liberica_, and that Java coffee was _Coffea arabica_ from Java.\r\n_Coffea robusta_ was barred from deliveries on the New York Coffee\r\nExchange in 1912.\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of the year 1918, the United States government\r\nassumed virtually full control of coffee trading. It was a war-time\r\nmeasure, and was intended to prevent speculation in coffee contracts and\r\nfreight rates, to cut down the number of vessels carrying coffee to this\r\ncountry so as to provide more ships for transporting food and soldiers\r\nto Europe, and to put the coffee merchants on rations during the stress\r\nof war. On February 4, 1918, importers and dealers were placed under\r\nlicense; and two days later, rules were issued through the Food\r\nAdministration fixing the maximum price for coffee for the spot month in\r\nthe \"futures\" markets at eight and a half cents, prohibiting dealers\r\nfrom taking more than normal pre-war profits, or holding supplies in\r\nexcess of ninety days' requirements, and greatly limiting resales. On\r\nMay 8, the United States Shipping Board fixed the \"official\" freight\r\nrate from Rio de Janeiro to New York at one dollar and fifty cents per\r\nbag, which, without control, had risen to as high as four dollars and\r\nmore, as compared with the ordinary rate of thirty-five cents before the\r\nwar. On January 12, 1919, two months after the armistice was signed, the\r\nrules were withdrawn, and the coffee trade was left to carry on its\r\nbusiness under its own direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some Well Known Green Coffee Marks_\r\n\r\nPractically every bag of good quality green coffee is imprinted with a\r\nbrand which indicates by whom it was shipped. These imprints are known\r\nin the trade as \"green coffee marks.\" Many of them, through long usage,\r\nhave become celebrated in international trade. One of the most famous\r\nwas HLOG. This stood for \"Heaven's Light Our Guide,\" and was owned by\r\nJohn O'Donohue's Sons. For many years it was used on Mocha coffee, but\r\nit is now out of existence. Other well-known Mocha marks are M R\r\n(Maurice Ries) with the figure of a camel, a star, or deer's head\r\nbetween the letters; L F or L B (Livierato Frères); C F or C B\r\n(Caracanda Frères).\r\n\r\nBogota marks includes PAL (in triangle) Bogota (P.A. Lopez & Co.);\r\nCamelia; Pinzon & Co.; Salazar; AOL (in triangle) Bogota; and Carmencita\r\nManizales Excelso (Steinwender, Stoffregen & Co.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOME WELL KNOWN GREEN-COFFEE MARKS]\r\n\r\nAmong the best known Medellin marks are FAC & H (F.A. Correa & Sons):\r\nPEC & C (Pedro Estrado Co.); LMT & C (Louis M. Torro & Co.); A & C (A.\r\nAngel & Co.); E C S Medellin Excelso (Eppens, Smith Co.); Balzacbro\r\nMedellin Excelso (Balzac Bros.); La Rambla (Banco Lopez); and Don Carlos\r\nMedellin Excelso (Steinwender, Stoffregen & Co.).\r\n\r\nCaracas marks show J P P & H (Juan Pablo Perez & Sons); HLB & C (H.L.\r\nBoulton & Co.); FST & C (Filipe S. Toledo & Co.); JLG (J.L. Garrondona);\r\nand many others. Kolster (Kolster & Co.) is a well known Puerto Cabello\r\nmark.\r\n\r\nMaracaibos bear numerous marks, chief among which are: M & C (Menda &\r\nCo.); Cogollo (Cogollo & Co.); Fossi (Fossi & Co.); B M & C (Breur.\r\nMoller & Co.); B & C (Blohm & Co.); FST & C (Filipe S. Toledo & Co.); V\r\nD R & C (Van Dessel, Rodo & Co.); and J E C & C over R G E (J.E. Carret\r\n& Co.).\r\n\r\nA prominent Mexican mark is P A N (Rafael del Castillo & Co.).\r\n\r\nBrazil coffee is usually marked merely with the initials of the firm or\r\nbank financing the shipment. Some representative Brazilian marks are:\r\nAronco (in rectangle) Brazil; J A & Co (in rectangle) Brazil Rosebud; J\r\nA & Co (in rectangle) Brazil Bourbona--all used by J. Aron & Company; S\r\nS C (in circle) Rio; S S C (in triangle) Santos; both used by\r\nSteinwender, Stoffregen & Co.; Sions M/M Bourbns (Sion & Co.); and\r\nNossack V S S C (in swastika), used by Nossack & Co.\r\n\r\nThere are hundreds of other marks. In most countries they change so\r\noften that one rarely stands out above the rest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nGREEN AND ROASTED COFFEE CHARACTERISTICS\r\n\r\n     _The trade values, bean characteristics, and cup merits of the\r\n     leading coffees of commerce, with a \"Complete Reference Table of\r\n     the Principal Kinds of Coffee Grown in the World\"--Appearance,\r\n     aroma, and flavor in cup-testing--How experts test coffee--A\r\n     typical sample-roasting and cup-testing outfit_\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than a hundred different kinds of coffee are bought and sold in the\r\nUnited States. All of them belong to the same botanical genus, and\r\npractically all to the same species, the _Coffea arabica_; but each has\r\ndistinguishing characteristics which determine its commercial value in\r\nthe eyes of the importers, roasters, and distributers.\r\n\r\nThe American trade deals almost exclusively in _Coffea arabica_,\r\nalthough in the latter years of the World War increasing quantities of\r\n_robusta_ and _liberica_ growths were imported, largely because of the\r\nscarcity of Brazilian stocks and the improvement in the preparation\r\nmethods, especially in the case of _robustas_. Considerable quantities\r\nof _robusta_ grades were sold in the United States before 1912, but\r\ntrading in them fell off when the New York Coffee and Sugar Exchange\r\nprohibited their delivery on Exchange contracts after March 1, 1912.\r\n\r\nAll coffees used in the United States are divided into two general\r\ngroups, Brazils and Milds. Brazils comprise those coffees grown in São\r\nPaulo, Minãs Geraes, Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Victoria, and other\r\nBrazilian states. The Milds include all coffees grown elsewhere. In 1921\r\nBrazils made up about three-fourths of the world's total consumption.\r\nThey are regarded by American traders as the \"price\" coffees, while\r\nMilds are considered as the \"quality\" grades.\r\n\r\nBrazil coffees are classified into four great groups, which bear the\r\nnames of the ports through which they are exported; Santos, Rio,\r\nVictoria, and Bahia. Santos coffee is grown principally in the state of\r\nSão Paulo; Rio, in the state of Rio de Janeiro and the state of Minãs\r\nGeraes; Victoria, in the state of Espirito Santo; and Bahia in the state\r\nof Bahia. All of these groups are further subdivided according to their\r\nbean characteristics and the districts in which they are produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Brazil Coffee Characteristics_\r\n\r\nSANTOS. Santos coffees, considered as a whole, have the distinction of\r\nbeing the best grown in Brazil. Rios rank next, Victorias coming third\r\nin favor, and Bahias fourth. Of the Santos growths the best is that\r\nknown in the trade as Bourbon, produced by trees grown from Mocha seed\r\n(_Coffea arabica_) brought originally from the French island colony of\r\nBourbon (now Réunion) in the Indian Ocean. The true Bourbon is obtained\r\nfrom the first few crops of Mocha seed. After the third or fourth year\r\nof bearing, the fruit gradually changes in form, yielding in the sixth\r\nyear the flat-shaped beans which are sold under the trade name of Flat\r\nBean Santos. By that time, the coffee has lost most of its Bourbon\r\ncharacteristics. The true Bourbon of the first and second crops is a\r\nsmall bean, and resembles the Mocha, but makes a much handsomer roast\r\nwith fewer \"quakers\". The Bourbons grown in the Campinas district often\r\nhave a red center.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Coffee Map of Brazil_\r\n\r\n_Showing the Principal Coffee-Producing States and Shipping Ports_\r\n\r\nCopyright 1922 by The Tea and Coffee Trade Journal Co.]\r\n\r\nAs regards flavor, a good Bourbon Santos is considered the best coffee\r\nfor its price, and is the most satisfactory low-cost blending coffee to\r\nbe obtained. It is used with practically any of the high-priced coffees\r\nto reduce the cost of the blend. When properly made, this coffee\r\nproduces a drink that is smooth and palatable, without tang or special\r\ncharacter, and is suitable to the average taste. When aged, Bourbon\r\nSantos decreases in acidity, and increases somewhat in size of bean.\r\n\r\nThe Santos coffee described as Flat Bean usually has a smooth surface,\r\nvarying in size from small to large bean, and in color from a pale\r\nyellow to a pale green. The cup has a good and smooth body of neutral\r\ncharacter, and the bean can be used straight or in a blend with\r\npractically any Mild coffee.\r\n\r\nAnother Santos growth, known in the trade as Harsh Santos, grows near\r\nthe boundary between São Paulo and Minãs Geraes. It often has some of\r\nthe Rio characteristics, and commands a lower price than other Santos\r\ncoffees.\r\n\r\nSome trade authorities are of the opinion that Santos coffees are an\r\nexception to the rule that most green coffees improve with age. They\r\nargue that careful cup-testing will reveal that a new crop Santos is to\r\nbe preferred to an old crop.\r\n\r\nRIOS. Rio coffee is not generally liked in the United States, though in\r\nformer years it had some following even in the better trade. The demand\r\nfor all grades of Rios has been decreasing, Santos taking their place in\r\nthe United States. Rio coffee has a peculiar, rank flavor. It has a\r\nheavy, pungent, and harsh taste which traders do not consider of value\r\neither in straight coffee or in blends. However, its low price\r\nrecommends it to some packers, and it is often found in the cheapest\r\nbrands of package coffees and also in many compounds. In color, the bean\r\nruns from light green to dark green; but when it is stored for any\r\nlength of time--a common practise in the past--the color changes to a\r\ngolden yellow; and the coffee is then known as golden Rio. The bean\r\nalso expands with age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOURBON SANTOS BEANS--ROASTED]\r\n\r\nAll Rio coffee is described by the name Rio; but the American trade\r\nrecognizes eight different grades, designated by numerals from one to\r\neight. These grades are determined by standards adopted by the New York\r\nCoffee and Sugar Exchange, and are classified by the number of\r\nimperfections found in the chops exported. No. 1 Rio contains no\r\nimperfections, such as black beans, shells, stones, broken beans, pods\r\nor immature beans (\"quakers\"). Such a chop is rarely found. No. 2 has\r\nsix imperfections. No. 3 has thirteen. No. 4 has twenty-nine, No. 5 has\r\nsixty, No. 6 has one hundred and ten, No. 7 has two hundred, and No. 8\r\nhas about four hundred, although on the Exchange these last two are\r\ngraded by standard types.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLAT AND BOURBON SANTOS BEANS--ROASTED]\r\n\r\nVICTORIAS. Up to about the year 1917, Victoria coffees were held in even\r\nless favor by American traders than were Rios. As a rule the bean was\r\nlarge and punky, of a dark brown or dingy color, and its flavor was\r\ndescribed as muddy. Then, the coffee growers began to introduce modern\r\nmachinery for handling the crops, with the result that the character of\r\nthe produce has been much improved, and the demand for it has been\r\nsteadily growing. Many roasters who formerly used Rios straight for\r\ntheir lower grades, have changed to Victorias, not only to improve the\r\nappearance of the roast, but to soften the harsh drinking qualities of\r\nthe low-grade Rios.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RIO BEANS--ROASTED]\r\n\r\nBAHIAS. Until recent years Bahia coffee has been decidedly unpopular in\r\nthe United States, largely because of its peculiar smoky flavor, due to\r\ndrying the coffee by means of wood fires, instead of by the usual sun\r\nmethod. This practise has been abandoned; Bahia coffee has shown a\r\nmarked improvement in quality; and importations into the United States\r\nhave increased. The Bahia coffee produced in the Chapada district is\r\nconsidered to be the best of the group. The bean is light-colored and of\r\nfair size. Other types are Caravella and Nazareth, both of which are\r\nbelow the standards demanded by the majority of the American trade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Coffee Map\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\nSão Paulo, Minãs, and Rio_]\r\n\r\nMARAGOGIPE. This is a variety of _Coffea arabica_ first observed\r\ngrowing near the town of Maragogipe on All Saints Bay, county of\r\nMaragogipe, Bahia, Brazil, where it is called _Coffea indigena_. The\r\ngreen bean is of huge size, and varies in color from green to dingy\r\nbrown. It is the largest of all coffee beans, and makes an elephantine\r\nroast, free from quakers, but woody and generally disagreeable in the\r\ncup. However, Dr. P.J.S. Cramer of the Netherlands government's\r\nexperimental garden in Bangelan, Java, regards it very highly, referring\r\nto it as \"the finest coffee known\", and as having \"a highly developed,\r\nsplendid flavor.\" This coffee is now found in practically all the\r\nproducing countries, and shows the characteristics of the other coffees\r\nproduced in the same soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Characteristics of Mild Coffees_\r\n\r\nAmong the Mild coffees there is a much greater variation in\r\ncharacteristics than is found among the Brazilian growths. This is due\r\nto the differences in climate, altitude, and soil, as well as in the\r\ncultural, processing, storage, and transportation methods employed in\r\nthe widely separated countries in which Milds are produced.\r\n\r\nMild coffees generally have more body, more acidity, and a much finer\r\naroma than Brazils; and from the standpoint of quality they are far more\r\ndesirable in the cup. As a rule they have also better appearance, or\r\n\"style\", both in the green and in the roast, due to the fact that\r\ngreater care is exercised in picking and preparing the higher grades.\r\nMilds are important for blending purposes, most of them possessing\r\ndistinctive individual characteristics, which increase their value as\r\nblending coffees.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Not All Coffees Improve with Age_\r\n\r\nAlthough it has long been held that green coffee improves with age, and\r\nthere is little doubt that this is true in so far as roasting merits are\r\nconcerned; the question has been raised among coffee experts as to\r\nwhether age improves the drinking qualities of all coffees alike.\r\n\r\nRio coffees should improve with age, as they are naturally strong and\r\nearthy. Age might be expected to soften and to mellow them and others\r\nhaving like characteristics. If, however, the coffee is mild in cup\r\nquality in the first instance, then it may be asked if age does not\r\nweaken it so that in time it must become quite insipid. Several years\r\nago, a New York coffee expert pointed out that this was what happened to\r\nSantos coffees. The new crop, he said, was always a more pleasant and\r\nenjoyable drink than the old crop, because it was a more pronounced mild\r\ncoffee in the cup.\r\n\r\nMEXICANS. Considering those coffees grown nearest the American market\r\nfirst, we come to the coffees of Mexico. All coffees grown in this\r\nrepublic are known as Mexicans. They are further divided according to\r\nthe states and districts in which they are produced, and as to whether\r\nthey are prepared according to the wet or the dry method. The types best\r\nknown in the American market are Coatepec, Huatusco, Orizaba, Cordoba,\r\nOaxaca, and Jalapa. The lesser known are the Uruapan, Michoacan, Colima,\r\nChiapas, Triunfo, Tapachula, Sierra, Tabasco, Tampico, and\r\nCoatzacoalcos. Some of these are rarely seen in the markets of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe coffee most cultivated in Mexico is supposed to have come from Mocha\r\nseed. Of this species is the Oaxaca coffee, which is valued because of\r\nits sharp acidity and excellent flavor, two qualities that make it\r\ndesirable for blending. The bean of the Sierra Oaxaca (common unwashed)\r\nis not large, nor is the appearance stylish. The Pluma Oaxaca (washed)\r\ncoffee, however, is a fancy bean and good for blending purposes.\r\n\r\nCoatepec coffees are among the finest grown in Mexico, and take rank\r\nwith the world's best grades. They are quite acidy, but have a desirable\r\nflavor; and when blended with coffees like Bourbon Santos, make a\r\nsatisfactory cup.\r\n\r\nThe Orizaba, Huatusco, and Jalapa growths resemble Coatepecs, of which\r\nthey are neighbors in the state of Vera Cruz. They are thin in body but\r\nare stylish roasters, and have a good cup qualities. As a class they do\r\nnot possess the heavy body and acidity of genuine Coatepecs. Some\r\nHuatuscos are exceptions. Orizaba is superior to Jalapa. Chiapas and\r\nTapachula coffees are generally more like Guatemalan growths than any\r\nothers produced in Mexico, which is natural in view of the proximity of\r\nthe districts to the northern boundary of Guatemala. The Sierra,\r\nTampico, Tabasco, and Coatzacoalcos coffees are uncertain in quality;\r\nmostly they are low grade, some of them frequently possessing a groundy,\r\nflat, or Rioy flavor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mild Coffee Map--No. 1_\r\n\r\n_Showing the Mild Coffee-Producing Countries of the Western Hemisphere_\r\n\r\nCopyright 1922 by The Tea and Coffee Trade Journal Co.]\r\n\r\nCordoba coffees lack the acidity and tang of the Oaxacas, but make a\r\nhandsome roast. They are considered too neutral to form the basis of a\r\nblend, but can be used to balance the tang of other grades.\r\n\r\nCENTRAL AMERICANS. Central American coffee is the general trade name\r\napplied to the growths produced in Guatemala, Honduras, Salvador,\r\nNicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama, the countries comprising Central\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nGUATEMALA. This country sends the largest quantity to the United States,\r\nand also produces the best average grades of the Central American\r\ndistricts. Guatemalas are mostly washed and are very stylish. The bean\r\nhas a waxy, bluish color. It splits open when roasting and shows a white\r\ncenter. Low-grown Guatemalas are thin in the cup, but the coffees grown\r\nin the mountainous districts of Cobán and Antigua are quite acidy and\r\nheavy in body. Some Cobáns border on bitterness because of the extreme\r\nacidity. The Antiguas are medium, flinty beans; while Cobáns are larger.\r\nBoth grades are spicy and aromatic in the cup, and are particularly good\r\nblenders. Properly roasted to a light cinnamon color, and blended with a\r\nhigh-grade combination, Cobáns make one of the most serviceable coffees\r\non the American market.\r\n\r\nGuatemalas are generally classified as noted in the Complete Reference\r\nTable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEXICAN BEANS--ROASTED]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GUATEMALA BEANS--ROASTED]\r\n\r\nHONDURAS. While the upland coffee of Honduras is of good quality, the\r\ngeneral run of the country's production seldom brings as high a price as\r\nSantos of equal grade. Nearly all Honduras coffee consists of small,\r\nround berries, bluish green in color. Very little of this growth comes\r\nto the United States; the bulk of the exports going to Europe, where it\r\ncommands a high price, especially in France.\r\n\r\nSALVADOR. Salvador coffee is inferior to Guatemala's product, grade for\r\ngrade. Only a small proportion is washed; and the bulk of the crops is\r\n\"naturals\"; that is, unwashed. The bean is large and of fair average\r\nroast. The washed grades are fancy roasters, with very thin cup. The\r\nlargest part of the production goes to Europe; some twenty-five percent\r\nof the exports are brought into the United States through San Francisco.\r\n\r\nNICARAGUA. The ordinary run of Nicaragua coffee (the naturals) is looked\r\nupon in the United States as being of low quality, though the washed\r\ncoffees from the Matagalpa district have plenty of acid in the cup and\r\nusually are fine roasters. Matagalpa beans are large and blue-tinged.\r\nGermany, Great Britain, and France take about all the Honduras coffee\r\nexported, only about six percent of the total coming to the United\r\nStates. These coffees are described more in detail in the Complete\r\nReference Table.\r\n\r\nCOSTA RICA. Good grades of Costa Rican coffee, such as are grown in the\r\nCartago, San José, Alajuela, and Grecia districts at high altitudes, are\r\nhighly esteemed by blenders. They are characterized by their fine\r\nflavor, rich body, and sharp acidity. It is frequently declared that\r\nsome of these coffees are often acidy enough to sour cream if used\r\nstraight. Due to careless methods of handling, sour or \"hidey\" beans are\r\nsometimes found in chops of Costa Ricans from the lowlands.\r\n\r\nPANAMA. Panama grows coffee only for domestic use, and consequently it\r\nis little known in foreign markets. The bean is of average size and\r\ntends toward green in color. In the cup it has a heavy body and a strong\r\nflavor. The coffee grown in Boquette Valley is considered to be of fine\r\nquality, due no doubt to the care given in cultivation by the American\r\nand English planters there.\r\n\r\n\r\n_South America_\r\n\r\nCOLOMBIANS. Colombia produces some of the world's finest coffees, of\r\nwhich the best known are Medellins, Manizales, Bogotas, Bucaramangas,\r\nTolimas, and Cucutas. Old-crop Colombians of the higher grades, when\r\nmellowed with age, have many of the characteristics of the best East\r\nIndian coffees, and in style and cup are difficult to distinguish from\r\nthe Mandhelings and the Ankolas of Sumatra. Such coffees are scarce on\r\nthe American market, practically all the shipments coming to the United\r\nStates being new crop and lacking some of the qualities of the mellowed\r\nbeans. Compared with Santos coffee, good grade Colombians give\r\none-fourth more liquor to a given strength with better flavor and aroma.\r\nThey are classed and graded as noted in the Complete Reference Table.\r\n\r\nMedellins are a fancy mountain-grown coffee, and are esteemed for their\r\ngood qualities. The beans vary in size, and the color ranges from light\r\nto dark green, making a rather rough roast. In the cup they have a fine,\r\nrich, distinctive flavor, and in the American grading are regarded as\r\nthe best of the Colombian commercial growths.\r\n\r\nManizales rank next to Medellins, and have nearly the same\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOGOTA (COLOMBIA) BEANS--ROASTED]\r\n\r\nBogotas of good grade are noted for their acidity, body, and flavor.\r\nWhen the acidity is tempered with age, the coffee can be drunk\r\n\"straight\" which can not be done with many other growths. The Bogota\r\ngreen bean ranges from a blue-green bean to a fancy yellow. It is long,\r\nand generally has a sharp turn in one end of the center stripe. It is a\r\nsmooth roaster, and has a rich mellow flavor.\r\n\r\nBucaramangas, grown in the district of that name, are regarded favorably\r\nin the American markets as good commercial coffees for blending\r\npurposes; the naturals have heavy body, but lack acidity and decided\r\nflavor, and are much used to give \"back-bone\" to blends. The fancies\r\nsometimes push the superior East Indian growths hard for first place.\r\n\r\nTolimas are considered a good grade average coffee, and are\r\ncharacterized by a fair-sized bean, attractive style, and good cup\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nCucuta coffees, though grown in Colombia, are generally classified among\r\nthe Maracaibos of Venezuela, because they are mostly shipped from that\r\nport. They are described, accordingly, with the Venezuelan coffees.\r\n\r\nVENEZUELA. The coffees of Venezuela are generally grouped under the\r\nheads of Caracas, Puerto Cabello, and Maracaibo, the names of the ports\r\nthrough which they are exported. Each group is further subdivided by the\r\nnames of the districts in which the principal plantations lie. La Guaira\r\ncoffee includes that produced in the vicinity of Caracas and Cumana.\r\n\r\nCaracas coffee is one of the best known in the American market. The\r\nwashed Caracas is in steady demand in France and Spain. The bean is\r\nbluish in color, somewhat short, and of a uniform size. The liquor has a\r\nrather light body. Some light-blue washed Caracas coffees are very\r\ndesirable, and have a peculiar flavor that is quite pleasant to the\r\neducated palate. Caracas chops rarely hold their style for any length of\r\ntime, as the owners usually are not willing to dry properly and\r\nthoroughly before milling. When, however, the price is right, American\r\nbuyers will use some Caracas chops instead of Bogotas. At equal prices\r\nthe latter have the preference, as they have more body in the cup.\r\nPuerto Cabello and Cumana coffees are valued just below Caracas. They\r\nare grown at a lower altitude, and are somewhat inferior in flavor.\r\n\r\nNot less than one-third of Puerto Cabello coffees come across the\r\nthirty-mile gulf to the westward from the port of Tucacas, in a little\r\nsteamer called the Barquisimento, which is famous all along the coast as\r\nthe \"cocktail shaker.\" C.H. Stewart[324] solemnly asserts that \"Barky\"\r\ncan do the \"shimmy\" when lying at anchor in quiet waters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARACAIBO BEANS--ROASTED]\r\n\r\nMerida and Tachira coffees are considered the best of the Maracaibo\r\ngrades, Tovars and Trujillos being classed as lower in trade value.\r\nThough Cucuta coffee is grown in the Colombian district of that name, it\r\nis largely shipped through Maracaibo; and hence is classed among the\r\nMaracaibo types. It ranks with Meridas and fine grade Boconos, and\r\nsomewhat resembles the Java bean in form and roast, but is decidedly\r\ndifferent in the cup. Washed Cucutas are noted for their large size,\r\nroughness, and waxy color. They make a good-appearing roast, splitting\r\nopen, and showing irregular white centers. New-crop beans are sometimes\r\nsharply acid, though they mellow with age and gain in body.\r\n\r\nUntil recent years, Tachira coffee was always sold as Cucuta; but now\r\nthere is a tendency to ship it under the name Tachira-Venezuela, while\r\ntrue Cucuta is marked Cucuta-Colombia. Tachiras closely resemble the\r\ntrue Cucutas, grade for grade. Up to about 1905 the coffees grown near\r\nSalazar, in Colombia, came to market under the name of Salazar; but\r\nsince then, they have been included among the Cucuta grades and are sold\r\nunder that name.\r\n\r\nThe state of Tachira lies next to the Colombian boundary, and its\r\nmountains produce much fine washed coffee. This has size and fair style,\r\nas a rule, but does not possess cup qualities to make it much sought. It\r\nages well and, being of good body, the old crops, other things being\r\nequal, frequently bring a tidy premium.\r\n\r\nThe Rubio section of Tachira produces the best of its washed coffees.\r\nHere are several of the largest and best-equipped estates in all\r\nVenezuela. Washed when fresh, the coffees from these estates are usually\r\nsold somewhat under the fancy Caracas; but the trillados of the Tachira\r\nrank with the best of the country, owing to their large bean, solid\r\ncolor, and good quality. They roast well, and cup with good body, though\r\nnot much character. Good Tachira trillados are sold on the same basis as\r\nthe Cucutas, which they resemble.\r\n\r\nThe Meridas are raised at higher altitudes than Cucutas, and good grades\r\nare sought for their peculiarly delicate flavor--which is neither acidy\r\nnor bitter--and heavy body. They rank as the best by far of the\r\nMaracaibo type. The bean is high-grown, of medium size, and roundish. It\r\nis well knit, and brings the highest price while it still holds its\r\nbluish style, as it then retains its delicate aroma and character. The\r\ntrillados of Merida run unevenly.\r\n\r\nTovars rank between Trujillos and Tachiras. They are fair to good body\r\nwithout acidity; make a duller roast than Cucutas, but contain fewer\r\nquakers. They are used for blending with Bourbon Santos. Boconos are\r\nlight in color and body. They are of two classes; one a round, small to\r\nmedium, bean; and the other larger and softer. Their flavor is rather\r\nneutral, and they are frequently used as fillers in blends. Trujillos\r\nlack acidity and make a dull, rough roast, unless aged. They are blended\r\nwith Bourbon Santos to make a low-priced palatable coffee. Some coffees\r\nof merit are produced at Santa Ana, Monte Carmelo, and Bocono in\r\nTrujillo.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other South American Countries_\r\n\r\nThe coffees from other South American countries, even where there is an\r\nappreciable production, are not important factors in international\r\ntrade. The coffee of Ecuador, shipped through the port of Guayaquil,\r\ngoes mostly to Chile, a comparatively small quantity being exported to\r\nthe United States. The bean is small to medium in size, pea-green in\r\ncolor, and not desirable in the cup. The coffee is about equal to\r\nlow-grade Brazil, and is used principally as a filler. Peru produces an\r\never-lessening quantity of coffee, the bulk of the exports in pre-war\r\nyears going to Germany, Chile, and the United Kingdom. It is a\r\nlow-altitude growth, and is considered poor grade. The bean ranges from\r\nmedium to bold in size, and from bluish to yellow in color. Bolivia is\r\nan unimportant factor in the international coffee trade, most of its\r\nexports going to Chile. The chief variety produced is called the Yunga,\r\nwhich is considered to be of superior quality; but only a small quantity\r\nis grown. Guiana's coffee trade is insignificant. The three best-known\r\ntypes are the Surinam, Demerara, and Cayenne, named after the ports\r\nthrough which they are shipped.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The West Indies_\r\n\r\nCoffee either is, or can be, grown practically everywhere in the West\r\nIndies; but the chief producing districts are found on the islands of\r\nPorto Rico, Haiti (and Santo Domingo), Jamaica, Guadeloupe, and Curaçao.\r\nCoffees coming from these islands are generally known by the name of the\r\ncountry of production, and may be further identified by the names of the\r\ndistricts in which they are grown.\r\n\r\nPORTO RICO. Since the United States took possession of Porto Rico, soil\r\nexperts have endeavored to raise the quality of the coffee grown there,\r\nespecially the lower grades, which had peculiarly wild characteristics.\r\nToday, the superior grades of Porto Rican coffees rank among the best\r\ngrowths known to the trade. The bean is large, uniform, and stylish;\r\nranging in color from a light gray-blue to a dark green-blue. Some of\r\nthese are artificially colored for foreign markets. The coffee roasts\r\nwell, and has a heavy body, similar to the fanciest Mexicans and\r\nColombians. Its cup is not as rich, but it makes a good blend. Porto\r\nRican coffees command a higher price in France than in the United\r\nStates, which accounts for the larger proportion of exports to Europe,\r\nexcepting when the French market was cut off during the World War.\r\n\r\nJAMAICA. Jamaica produces two distinct types of coffee, the highland and\r\nthe lowland growths. Among the first-named is the celebrated Blue\r\nMountain coffee, which has a well developed pale blue-green bean that\r\nmakes a good-appearing roast and a pleasantly aromatic cup. It is\r\nfrequently compared with the fancy Cobáns of Guatemala. The lowland\r\ncoffee is a poorer grade, and consists largely of a mixture of different\r\ngrowths produced on the plains. It is a fair-sized bean, green to yellow\r\nin the \"natural\", and blue-green when washed. In the cup it has a grassy\r\nflavor, but is flat when drunk with cream. It is used chiefly as a\r\nfiller in blends, and for French roasts.\r\n\r\nHAITI AND SANTO DOMINGO. The coffees of these two republics have like\r\ncharacteristics, being grown on the same island and in about the same\r\nclimatic and soil conditions. Careless cultivation and preparation\r\nmethods are responsible for the generally poor quality of these coffees.\r\nWhen properly grown and cured, they rank well with high-grade washed\r\nvarieties, and have a rich, fairly acid flavor in the cup. The bean is\r\nblue-green, and makes a handsome roast.\r\n\r\nGUADELOUPE. Guadeloupe coffee is distinguishable by its green, long, and\r\nslightly thick bean, covered by a pellicle of whitish silvery color,\r\nwhich separates from the bean in the roast. It has excellent cup\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nMARTINIQUE. This island formerly produced a coffee closely resembling\r\nthe Guadeloupe; but no coffee is now grown there, though some Guadeloupe\r\ngrowths are shipped from Martinique, and bear its name.\r\n\r\nOTHER WEST INDIAN ISLANDS. Among the other West Indian islands\r\nproducing small quantities of coffee are Cuba, Trinidad, Dominica,\r\nBarbados, and Curaçao. The growths are generally good quality, bearing a\r\nclose resemblance to one another. In the past, Cuba produced a fine\r\ngrade; but the industry is now practically extinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Asia_\r\n\r\nARABIA. For many generations Mocha coffee has been recognized throughout\r\nthe world as the best coffee obtainable; and until the pure food law\r\nwent into effect in the United States, other high-grade coffees were\r\nfrequently sold by American firms under the name of Mocha. Now, only\r\ncoffees grown in Arabia are entitled to that valuable trade name. They\r\ngrow in a small area in the mountainous regions of the southwestern\r\nportion of the Arabian peninsula, in the province of Yemen, and are\r\nknown locally by the names of the districts in which they are produced.\r\nCommercially they are graded as follows: Mocha Extra, for all extra\r\nqualities; Mocha No. 1, consisting of only perfect berries; No. 1-A,\r\ncontaining some dust, but otherwise free of imperfections; No. 2,\r\nshowing a few broken beans and quakers; No. 3, having a heavier\r\npercentage of brokens and quakers and also some dust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOCHA BEANS--ROASTED]\r\n\r\nMocha beans are very small, hard, roundish, and irregular in form and\r\nsize. In color, they shade from olive green to pale yellow, the bulk\r\nbeing olive green. The roast is poor and uneven; but the coffee's\r\nvirtues are shown in the cup. It has a distinctive winy flavor, and is\r\nheavy with acidity--two qualities which make a straight Mocha brew\r\nespecially valuable as an after-dinner coffee, and also esteemed for\r\nblending with fancy, mild, washed types, particularly East Indian\r\ngrowths.\r\n\r\nAs in other countries, the coffees grown on the highlands in Yemen are\r\nbetter than the lowland growths. As a rule, the low altitude bean is\r\nlarger and more oblong than that grown in the highlands, due to its\r\nquicker development in the regions where the rainfall, though not great,\r\nis more abundant.\r\n\r\nWhile Mocha coffees are known commercially by grade numbers, the\r\nplanters and Arabian traders also designate them by the name of the\r\ndistrict or province in which each is grown. Among the better grades\r\nthus labeled are, the Yaffey, the Anezi, the Mattari, the Sanani, the\r\nSharki, and the Haimi-Harazi. For the poorer grades, these names are\r\nused: Remi, Bourai, Shami, Yemeni, and Maidi. Of these varieties, the\r\nMattari, a hard and regular bean, pale yellow in color, commands the\r\nhighest price, with the Yaffey a close second. Harazi coffee heads the\r\nmarket for quantity coupled with general average of quality.\r\n\r\nINDIAN AND CEYLON. Coffees from India and Ceylon are marketed almost\r\nexclusively in London, little reaching the American trade. Of the Indian\r\ngrowths, Malabars, grown on the western slope of the Ghaut mountains,\r\nare classed commercially as the best. The bean is rather small and\r\nblue-green in color. In the cup it has a distinctive strong flavor and\r\ndeep color. Mysore coffee ranks next in favor on the English market. It\r\nis mountain grown, and the bean is large and blue-green in color.\r\nTellicherry is another good grade coffee, closely resembling Malabar.\r\nCoorg (Kurg) coffee is an inferior growth. It is lowland type, and in\r\nthe cup is thin and flat. The bean is large and flat, and tends toward\r\ndark green in color. Travancore is another lowland growth, ranking about\r\nwith Coorg, and has the same general characteristics. See the Complete\r\nReference Table for details.\r\n\r\nCeylon, although it once was one of the world's most important\r\nproducers, has been losing ground as a coffee-producing country since\r\n1890. Ceylon coffees are classified commercially as \"native\",\r\n\"plantation\", and \"mountain\". The native is a poor-grade, lowland\r\ngrowth, with large flat bean and low cup quality. The plantation, so\r\nnamed because more carefully cultivated on highland plantations, is a\r\nstylish roaster, and gives a rich flavor and strong fragrance in the\r\ncup. The mountain, grown at high altitudes, is a small, steel-blue bean,\r\nand is considered by British traders as equal to the best varieties\r\ngrown anywhere. It was formerly shipped to Aden to be mixed with Mocha.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Coffee Map of Africa and Arabia_\r\n\r\n_Showing the Principal Coffee-Producing Countries on the Continent and\r\nAdjacent Islands._\r\n\r\nCopyright 1922 by The Tea and Coffee Trade Journal Co.]\r\n\r\nFRENCH INDO-CHINA. The coffee of French Indo-China is highly prized in\r\nFrance, where the bulk of the exports goes. The coffee tree grows well\r\nin the provinces of Tonkin, Annam, Cambodia, and Cochin-China. Tonkin is\r\nthe largest producer, and grows the best varieties. In the cup, Tonkin\r\ncoffee is thought by French traders to compare favorably with Mocha. Of\r\nthe several varieties of _Coffea arabica_ grown in Indo-China, the\r\n_Grand Bourbon_, _Bourbon rond_, and the _Bourbon Le Roy_, are the best\r\nknown. The first-named is a large bean of good quality; the second is a\r\nsmall, round bean of superior grade; and the third is a still smaller\r\nbean of fair cup quality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAVA (Washed)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUMATRA (Mandheling)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARABIAN (Mocha)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLOMBIAN (Bogota)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GUATEMALA (Washed)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEXICAN (Washed)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COSTA RICA (Washed)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SANTOS (Peaberry)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VENEZUELA (Maracaibo)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SANTOS (Flat Bean)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SANTOS (Bourbon)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RIO (Natural)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRINCIPAL VARIETIES OF GREEN COFFEE BEANS, NATURAL SIZE\r\nAND COLOR]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Africa_\r\n\r\nABYSSINIA. The coffee grown in Abyssinia is classified commercially into\r\ntwo varieties: Harari, which is grown principally in the district around\r\nHarar; and Abyssinian, produced mainly in the provinces of Kaffa,\r\nSidamo, and Guma. Harari coffee is the fruit of cultivated trees; while\r\nAbyssinian comes from wild trees. The first-named produces a long and\r\nwell-shaped berry, and is often referred to as Longberry Harari. The\r\nbean is larger than the Mocha, but similar in general appearance. Its\r\ncolor shades from blue-green to yellow. Good grades of Harari have cup\r\ncharacteristics resembling Mocha, and by some are preferred to Mocha,\r\nbecause of their winier cup flavor. The Abyssinian coffee is considered\r\nmuch inferior to Harari; and chops generally contain many imperfections.\r\nThe bean is dark gray in color. Little Abyssinian coffee comes to the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nMany other African countries produce coffee; but little of it ever\r\nreaches the North American market. Uganda, in British East Africa, grows\r\na good grade of _robusta_ coffee which is valued on the London market.\r\nLiberian coffee, grown on the west coast, used to be mixed with Bourbon\r\nSantos to some extent; but it is generally considered low grade,\r\nalthough it makes a handsome, elephantine roast. The product of Guinea\r\nis a very small bean, half-way between a peaberry and a flat bean, and\r\nhas a dingy brown color. It is considered worthless as a drink. A\r\nmedium-sized, strong-flavored bean that is rich in the cup, is grown in\r\nthe African Congo district. In Angola a fair quantity of coffee is\r\nproduced. In the cup it has a strong and pungent flavor, but lacks\r\nsmoothness and aroma. Zanzibar produces a pleasing coffee in very\r\nlimited quantities. The bean is medium size, and regular in shape.\r\nMozambique's coffee is greenish in color, of medium size, and mellow.\r\nThe production is small. Madagascar produces an insignificant quantity\r\nfor export, although the coffee is considered fair average, with rich\r\nflavor, and considerable fragrance. Bourbon coffee, grown on the island\r\nof Réunion, commands a high price in the French market, where\r\npractically all exports go. It is a small, flinty bean, and gives a rich\r\ncup and fragrance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASHED JAVA BEANS--ROASTED]\r\n\r\n\r\n_East Indian Islands_\r\n\r\nSome of the coffees from the East Indian islands rank among the best in\r\nthe world, particularly those from Sumatra. East India coffees are\r\ndistinguished by their smooth, heavy body in the cup, the fancy grades\r\ngiving an almost syrupy richness.\r\n\r\nJAVA. Java coffees are generally of a smaller bean than those from\r\nSumatra, and are not considered as high grade. The bulk of the new-crop\r\ngrowths have a grassy flavor which most people find unpleasant when\r\ndrunk straight. Under the old culture system, coffee was bought by the\r\ngovernment, and held in godowns from two to three years, until it had\r\nbecome mellow with age. In late years, this system has been abandoned;\r\nand the planters now sell their product as they please, and in most\r\ncases without mellowing, excepting as they age during the long sea\r\nvoyage from Batavia to destination. Before the advent of large fleets of\r\nsteamers in the East Indian trade, the coffee was brought to America in\r\nsailing vessels that required from three to four months for the trip.\r\nDuring the voyage, the coffee went through a sweating process which\r\nturned the beans from a light green to a dark brown, and considerably\r\nenhanced their cup values. The sweating was due to the coffee being\r\nloaded while moist, and then practically sealed in the vessel's hold\r\nduring all its trip through the tropical seas. As a consequence, the\r\ncargo steamed and foamed; and as a rule, part of the coffee became\r\nmoldy, the damage seldom extending more than an inch or two into the\r\nmats. Sweated coffees commanded from three to five cents more than those\r\nthat came in \"pale\".\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mild Coffee Map--No. 2_\r\n\r\n_Showing the Mild Coffee-Producing Countries of Asia, Netherlands India,\r\nand Australasia_\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1922 by The Tea and Coffee Trade Journal Co.]\r\n\r\nBefore the Java coffee trade began to decline in the latter part of the\r\nnineteenth century, _Coffea arabica_ was grown abundantly throughout the\r\nisland. Each residency had numerous estates, and their names were given\r\nto the coffees produced. The best coffees came from Preanger, Cheribon,\r\nBuitenzorg, and Batavia, ranking in merit in the order named. All Java\r\ncoffees are known commercially either as private growth, or as blue bean\r\nwashed, the former being cured by either the washing or the dry hulling\r\nmethod, while the latter are washed. Private growths are usually a pale\r\nyellow, the bean being short and round and slightly convex. It makes a\r\nhandsome even roast, showing a full white stripe. The washed variety is\r\na pale blue-green, the bean closely resembling the private growth in\r\nform and roast. These coffees have a distinctive character in the cup\r\nthat is much different from any other coffee grown. Their liquor is\r\nthin.\r\n\r\nAll the better known coffees of Java, which are designated by the\r\ndistricts in which they are grown, are listed in the Complete Reference\r\nTable. Coffee from few of the many districts comes to the North American\r\nmarket. Among those that are sold in the United States are the Kadoe and\r\nSemarang, both of which are small, yellowish green; and the Malang, a\r\ngreen, hard bean which makes a better roast than Kadoe and Semarang, but\r\nis inferior to them in the cup.\r\n\r\nSUMATRA. Sumatra has the reputation of producing some of the finest and\r\nhighest-priced coffees in the world, such as Mandheling, Ankola, Ayer\r\nBangies, Padang Interior, and Palembang. Mandheling coffee is a large,\r\nbrownish bean which roasts dull, but is generally free from quakers. It\r\nis very heavy in body, and has a unique flavor that easily distinguishes\r\nit from any other growth. The Ankola bean is shorter and\r\nbetter-appearing than Mandheling, but otherwise bears a close\r\nresemblance. Its flavor is only slightly under Mandheling; and, like\r\nthat coffee, is recommended for blending with the best grades of Mocha.\r\nWhile the Ayer Bangies bean is somewhat larger than the other two just\r\nmentioned, it is not so dark brown in color, and is not quite so heavy\r\nin body; the flavor is very delicate. These three growths are known in\r\nthe trade as the \"Fancies\" and are considered the best of Sumatra's\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nThe Sumatra coffee best known to the American trade is the Padang\r\nInterior, which is shipped through the port of Padang on Sumatra's west\r\ncoast. The bean is irregular in form and color, and makes a dull roast.\r\nHowever, the flavor is good, although it lacks the richness of the\r\nFancies. Another celebrated coffee grown on the west coast is the Boekit\r\nGompong, grown on the estate of that name near Padang. It is a\r\nhigh-grade coffee, making a handsome roast, and possessing a delicate\r\nflavor. The foregoing coffees are produced on what were formerly termed\r\ngovernment estates, and during the heyday of government control were\r\nsold by auction and came mostly to the United States.\r\n\r\nAmong the private estate coffees, Corinchies take first rank for\r\nquality, some traders saying that they are the best in international\r\ncommerce. They closely resemble Ankolas, but range a cent or two lower\r\nin price. Next in order of merit is Timor coffee, grown on the island of\r\nthat name. It is not as attractive in appearance, roast, or cup quality\r\nas the Corinchie. A grade below Timors is Boengie coffee, which is\r\nseldom seen on the North American market. Kroe coffee is better known\r\nand more widely used in the United States. The bean is large, but has an\r\nattractive appearance. Kroes are of heavy body, of somewhat groundy\r\nflavor when new crop, and are good roasters and blenders. Other East\r\nIndian coffees are Teagals, Balis, and Macassars, all of which are\r\nsecond-rate growths as compared with the bulk of Sumatras, grade for\r\ngrade. The Macassars are produced in the district of that name on island\r\nof Celebes. The best coffee grown in Celebes comes from the province of\r\nMenado, and is known by that name. It is thought to be of a superior\r\nquality, and commands a high price in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Pacific Islands_\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Islands have not figured in international coffee trade\r\nsince 1892, although in preceding years the Philippines exported several\r\nmillion pounds of an average good grade of coffee. While coffee is one\r\nof the shade trees used by householders in Guam, none of the fruit is\r\nexported. Coffee production is an unimportant industry in Samoa,\r\nAustralia, New Guinea, New Caledonia, and other Pacific islands, and\r\nnone is grown for export.\r\n\r\nHAWAII. Since the beginning of the twentieth century the Hawaiian\r\nislands have taken a position of increasing importance, shipping some\r\ntwo million pounds of good quality coffee to the United States, their\r\nbiggest customer. Coffee grows to some extent on all the islands of the\r\ngroup, but fully ninety-five percent is raised in the districts of Kona,\r\nPuna, and Hamakua on the main island of Hawaii. All Hawaiian coffee is\r\nhigh grade; and is generally large bean, blue-green in color when new\r\ncrop, and yellow-brown when aged. It makes a handsome roast, and has a\r\nfine flavor that is smooth and not too acid. It blends well with any\r\nhigh-grade mild coffee. Kona coffee, grown in the district of that name,\r\ncommands the highest price. Old-crop Kona coffee is said by some trade\r\nauthorities to be equal to either Mocha or Old Government Java.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Appearance, Aroma, and Flavor in Cup-Testing_\r\n\r\nBefore the beginning of the twentieth century, practically all the\r\ncoffees bought and sold in the United States were judged for merit\r\nsimply by the appearance of the green or of the roasted bean. Since that\r\ntime, the importance of testing the drinking qualities has become\r\ngenerally recognized; and today every progressive coffee buyer has his\r\nsample-roasting and testing outfit with which to carry out painstaking\r\ncup tests. Both buyers and sellers use the cup test, the former to\r\ndetermine the merits of the coffee he is buying, and the latter to\r\nascertain the proper value of the chop under consideration. Frequently a\r\ntest is made to fix the relative desirability of various growths\r\nconsidered as a whole, using composite samples that are supposed to give\r\nrepresentation to an entire crop.\r\n\r\nThe first step in testing coffee is to compare the appearance of the\r\ngreen bean of a chop with a sample of known standard value for that\r\nparticular kind of coffee. The next step is to compare the appearance\r\nwhen roasted. Then comes the appearance and aroma test, when it is\r\nground; and finally, the most difficult of all, the trial of the flavor\r\nand aroma of the liquid.\r\n\r\nNaturally the tester gives much care to proper roasting of the samples\r\nto be examined. He recognizes several different kinds of roasts which he\r\nterms the light, the medium, the dark, the Italian, and the French\r\nroasts, all of which vary in the shadings of color, and each of which\r\ngives a different taste in the cup. The careful tester watches the roast\r\nclosely to see whether the beans acquire a dull or bright finish, and to\r\nnote also if there are many quakers, or off-color beans. When the proper\r\nroasting point is reached, he smells the beans while still hot to\r\ndetermine their aroma. In some growths and grades, he will frequently\r\nsmell of them as they cool off, because the character changes as the\r\nheat leaves them, as in the case of many Maracaibo grades.\r\n\r\nAfter roasting, the actual cup-testing begins. Two methods are employed,\r\nthe blind cup test, in which there is no clue to the identity of the\r\nkind of coffee in the cup; and the open test, in which the tester knows\r\nbeforehand the particular coffee he is to examine. The former is most\r\ngenerally employed by buyers and sellers; although a large number of\r\nexperts who do not let their knowledge interfere with their judgment,\r\nuse the open method.\r\n\r\nIn both systems the amount of ground coffee placed in the cup is\r\ncarefully weighed so that the strength will be standard. Generally, the\r\ncups are marked on the bottom for identification after the examination.\r\nBefore pouring on the hot water to make the brew, the aroma of the\r\nfreshly ground coffee is carefully noted to see if it is up to standard.\r\nIn pouring the water, care is exercised to keep the temperature constant\r\nin the cups, so that the strength in all will be equal. When the water\r\nis poured directly on the grounds, a crust or scum is formed. Before\r\nthis crust breaks, the tester sniffs the aroma given off; this is called\r\nthe wet-smell, or crust, test, and is considered of great importance.\r\n\r\nOf course, the taste of the brew is the most important test. Equal\r\namounts of coffee are sipped from each cup, the tester holding each sip\r\nin his mouth only long enough to get the full strength of the flavor. He\r\nspits out the coffee into a large brass cuspidor which is designed for\r\nthe purpose. The expert never swallows the liquor.\r\n\r\nCup-testing calls for keenly developed senses of sight, smell, and\r\ntaste, and the faculty for remembering delicate shadings in each sense.\r\nBy sight, the coffee man judges the size, shape, and color of the green\r\nand roasted bean, which are important factors in determining commercial\r\nvalues. He can tell also whether the coffee is of the washed or unwashed\r\nvariety, and whether it contains many imperfections such as quakers,\r\npods, stones, brokens, off-colored beans, and the like. By his sense of\r\nsmell of the roast and of the brew, he gauges the strength of the aroma,\r\nwhich also enters into the valuation calculation. His palate tells him\r\nmany things about a coffee brew--if the drink has body and is smooth,\r\nrich, acidy, or mellow; if it is winy, neutral, harsh, or Rioy; if it is\r\nmusty, groundy, woody, or grassy; or if it is rank, hidey (sour), muddy,\r\nor bitter. These are trade designations of the different shades of\r\nflavor to be found in the various coffees coming to the North American\r\nmarket; and each has an influence on the price at which they will be\r\nsold.\r\n\r\nThe up-to-date cup-tester requires special equipment to get the best\r\nresults. A typical installation consists of a gas sample-roasting\r\noutfit, employing at least a single cylinder holding about six ounces of\r\ncoffee, and perhaps a battery of a dozen or more; an electric grinding\r\nmill; a testing table, with a top that can be revolved by hand; a pair\r\nof accurately adjusted balance scales; one or more brass kettles; a gas\r\nstove for heating water; sample pans; many china or glass cups; silver\r\nspoons; and a brass cuspidor that stands waist high and is shaped like\r\nan hour glass.\r\n\r\nSince the World War, there have been some notable changes in the buying\r\nof coffees, particularly in European markets. For example, the old idea\r\nof buying fancy coffees at fancy prices is probably gone for good in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TYPICAL SAMPLE-ROASTING AND CUP-TESTING OUTFIT\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the picture is a standard revolving table (3-1/2 feet\r\nin diameter), with scale mounted over the center, and with a \"Mitchell\r\nTray\" for holding one cup independent of the table-top movement.

Only in this way\r\ncan all the stimulating, flavoring, and aromatic principles concealed in\r\nthe minute cells of the bean be extracted at one time. An infusion from\r\ngreen coffee has a decidedly unpleasant taste and hardly any color.\r\nLikewise, an underdone roast has a disagreeable \"grassy\" flavor; while\r\nan overdone roast gives a charred taste that is unpalatable to the\r\naverage citizen of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Roasting as a Business_\r\n\r\nIn spite of the generally admitted fact that freshly roasted coffee\r\nmakes the best infusion, most of the coffee used today is not roasted at\r\nor near the place where it is brewed, but in factories that are provided\r\nwith special equipment for the roasting of coffee in a wholesale way.\r\nThe reasons for this are various, partly relating to the mere economy of\r\nbuying and manufacturing on a large scale, and partly relating to the\r\ntrained skill that is needed both for selecting suitable green coffees\r\nto make a satisfactory blend, and for the roasting work itself. The\r\nproportion of consumers (including restaurants and hotels) who roast\r\ntheir own coffee is so small as to be negligible, at least in the United\r\nStates. The average person who buys coffee today, for brewing use, never\r\nsees green coffee at all, unless as an \"educational exhibit\" in some\r\ndealer's display window.\r\n\r\nThe reasons just mentioned, which have made coffee roasting a real\r\nbusiness, all tend, of course, to make the roasting establishments of\r\nlarge size; but this tendency is offset by the problem of distributing\r\nthe roasting coffee so that it will reach the ultimate consumer in good\r\ncondition. Roasting enterprises on a comparatively small scale (not by\r\nconsumers, but by sufficiently expert dealers) would probably be much\r\nmore numerous on account of the \"fresh-roast\" argument, except for the\r\nfact that coffee-roasting machines can not be installed so easily as the\r\ngrinding mills, meat-choppers, and slicing machines, that find extended\r\nuse in small stores. The steam, smoke, and chaff given off by the coffee\r\nas it is roasted must be disposed of by an outdoor connection, without\r\nannoying the neighbors or creating a fire hazard.\r\n\r\nFrom these general remarks, it can easily be seen that the size of\r\nindividual roasting establishments will vary greatly, according to the\r\nskill of the proprietor in meeting the disadvantages of working on\r\neither the smallest or the largest scale. A wholesale plant may be\r\nconsidered to be one in which coffee is roasted in batches of one bag or\r\nmore at a time; and with this definition, nearly all the roasting in the\r\nUnited States is done in a wholesale way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MODERN GAS COFFEE-ROASTING PLANT WITH A CAPACITY OF\r\n1,000 BAGS A DAY\r\n\r\nGeneral view of the roasting room of the Jewel Tea Co., Hoboken, N.J.\r\nThe equipment consists of twelve Jubilee gas machines in four groups;\r\neach group having a smoke-suction fan, and a drag conveyor over the\r\nthree feed hoppers. To the left is a line of flexible-arm cooler cars]\r\n\r\nFor many years the regular factory machines have been of a size\r\nsuitable for roasting two bags of coffee at a time; but roasters of\r\nlarger size have recently come into considerable use.\r\n\r\nPlants treating from fifty to a hundred and fifty bags per day are the\r\nmost common; but the daily capacity runs up to a thousand bags or more.\r\nThe minimum cost of equipping a plant is somewhere between five thousand\r\ndollars and ten thousand dollars. The individual machines are of\r\nstandard construction; but the arrangement in a particular building,\r\nespecially for the larger plants, is worked out with great care and with\r\nnumerous special features, so that the goods can be handled from start\r\nto finish with minimum expense for floor space, labor, power, etc.\r\n\r\nThe practical coffee roaster locates his roasting room in the top floor\r\nof his factory building, where light and ventilation are generally best.\r\nHe usually has a large skylight in the roof, directly over the roasting\r\nequipment. In addition to the advantage as regards good light and the\r\nconvenient discharge of smoke, steam, and odors, through the roof, the\r\ntop-story location makes it possible to send the roasted coffee by\r\ngravity through the various bins which may be needed in connection with\r\nsubsequent operations, such as grinding, and for temporary storage\r\nbefore the final packaging and shipping.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wholesale Coffee-Roasting Machinery_\r\n\r\nThe indispensable coffee operations are roasting and cooling; and in\r\npractically all United States plants the cooling is followed by\r\n\"stoning\". This is an air-suction operation that effects, aided by\r\ngravity, the removal of any stones or other hard material that would\r\ndamage the grinding mill. The best commercial cleaning and grading of\r\nthe green coffee has usually left in every bag a few small stones. These\r\ncan be got rid of better after the coffee is roasted; because it is then\r\nnot only lighter, but more bulky.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILLING-MACHINE CONNECTIONS FOR A TWO-ROASTER PLANT]\r\n\r\nBesides these three operations of roasting, cooling, and stoning, the\r\nplant may have machinery for treating the coffee both before it is\r\nroasted and after it leaves the stoner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SIXTEEN-CYLINDER COAL ROASTING PLANT IN A NEW YORK\r\nFACTORY\r\n\r\nThis is a view of the roasting room of B. Fischer & Co. and shows a\r\nbattery of Burns coal roasters]\r\n\r\nTreatment of the green coffee in roasting establishments is of less\r\nimportance now than in years gone by; first, because most coffees now\r\ncome to market more perfectly graded and cleaned than formerly; and\r\nsecond, because the whole-bean appearance of the coffee has become of\r\nless account, as wholesale grinding operations have increased.\r\nNevertheless, many plants consider it highly important to have a\r\nseparator for grading the coffee closely as regards the size of the\r\nbeans--and particularly for the separation of round beans, or\r\n\"peaberry\"--as well as milling machinery for making the coffee as clean\r\nas possible before it is roasted. One green coffee operation that has\r\nlost none of its old-time importance, but on the contrary is more needed\r\nas the plants increase in size, is the mixing of different varieties of\r\ncoffee--in proportions that have been decided on by sample tests--so as\r\nto get a uniform blend.\r\n\r\nThe mixer does not blend the various coffees any more surely than a good\r\nroaster cylinder will do it, but treats batches of much larger size.\r\nThis means saving a great amount of labor that would be necessary for\r\nputting the desired quantity of component coffees into each individual\r\nroaster.\r\n\r\nA proper installation of green coffee machinery requires various bins of\r\nample capacity, and bucket elevators by which the coffee can be sent\r\nwithout manual labor from one operation to another. In modern plants,\r\nall the bins and elevators are constructed of metal. The separator, with\r\nits bins and elevator, may be installed independently of the rest of the\r\nplant, the graded coffee being all bagged up again and treated as new\r\nraw stock--some of it to be held for later use, or perhaps sold again\r\nunroasted. The milling machine and the mixer, however, are usually so\r\nplaced and connected that the coffee can be sent from one to the other,\r\nand to the roaster feed hoppers, without any manual labor.\r\n\r\nWhen the roaster sells his product in package form ready for the\r\nconsumer, he will have a packaging department in which are grinding,\r\nweighing, labeling, and packing machines and equipment. In some of the\r\nmore progressive plants, particularly in the United States, all the\r\npacking units are incorporated in one machine, so that the different\r\nsteps in the work are carried on automatically and in one continuous\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREEN-COFFEE-MIXER CONNECTIONS\r\n\r\nTo operate at full capacity, without using the story above as well as\r\nbelow the mixer, requires a bucket elevator and three bins, each holding\r\na full mixing batch. The above diagram explains this setting. The mixed\r\ncoffee in the discharge bin is either drawn out into bags or sent by an\r\nelevator to a milling machine or direct to the coffee roasters. A batch\r\nready for mixing can always be accumulated in the feed bin while the\r\nprevious batch is being mixed or discharged.\r\n\r\nThe fan is usually hung to the ceiling over the mixer as indicated, and\r\nconnected to the suction box by a 1-in. round pipe. The fan outlet can\r\nbe carried directly out-of-doors; but the dusty discharge is\r\nobjectionable in most installations, and this pipe is usually carried to\r\na dust collector from the top of which the roof outlet is connected.]\r\n\r\nThe efficient roaster-executive equips his entire plant with approved\r\nlabor-saving devices. In the better establishments, the coffee is\r\ncarried along by mechanical conveyors through all the operations from\r\nthe first cleaning machine to the final packaging.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Separating_\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, a machine frequently found in wholesale plants is\r\nthe separator, or grader. This apparatus, which is the same in principle\r\nin all countries, but varies in size and form according to local\r\nrequirements, consists of a series of perforated screens. The\r\nperforations differ in size; and as the coffee is shaken on them, the\r\nsmall beans drop through the holes, the larger ones passing across the\r\nscreen and dropping into a receptacle or chute ready for the next\r\noperation. The screens are made to grade the beans into large and small\r\npeaberry; large, medium, and small flat beans; brokens; and other\r\ncommercial sizes. The average separator will grade fifteen to twenty\r\nbags of coffee in an hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Green-coffee-milling machine having a capacity of forty\r\nbags of green coffee per hour; with sifter, feed-pipe suction, and a\r\nfinal separate suction at the discharge hopper]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Green-coffee separator without fan; with feed elevator,\r\ndischarge chutes, and motor drive. View of right-hand side and feed end]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREEN-COFFEE SEPARATING AND MILLING MACHINES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Milling_\r\n\r\nMilling machines, for cleaning the green coffee, operate on practically\r\nthe same principle the world over, varying in capacity and details of\r\nconstruction. A popular type used in the United States has two metal\r\ncylinders, one set within the other, and revolving in opposite\r\ndirections. The inner cylinder is ribbed with flanges, and the outer one\r\nis lined with wire cloth. As these cylinders revolve, the beans pass\r\nbetween them rubbing against themselves and the rough sides of the\r\ncylinders. This action serves to remove dirt and other foreign matter\r\nthat may be clinging to the beans, and also gives them an attractive\r\npolish. An exhaust fan sucks away the dirt milled off in the process.\r\nThis type of machine will mill about forty bags of green coffee in an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mixing or Blending Green Coffee_\r\n\r\nMost roasters blend the different types of coffee while green. Some\r\nblend them after they have been roasted separately. When blended before\r\nroasting, the coffees are mixed by a machine built especially for that\r\npurpose. The mixing machine in general use in all countries consists of\r\na large metal cylinder which, in wholesale operations, is revolved by\r\nthe factory's general power plant or by a separate motor. The cylinder\r\nis equipped on the inside with sets of reverse-screw mixing flanges that\r\ntumble the beans around until they are thoroughly blended; and there is\r\nusually a fan attachment to remove dust. This operation serves also to\r\nsmooth down and to polish the surfaces of the beans, which adds to the\r\nstyle of the coffee when roasted. The average blending machine will mix\r\nfrom ten to twenty bags of coffee at a time. The actual mixing requires\r\nless than five minutes, but a longer period is needed for feeding and\r\ndischarging. This is the last of the so-called \"green-coffee\r\noperations\". The next step is roasting.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Roasting by Coal, Coke, Gas, and Electricity_\r\n\r\nCoffee is roasted commercially in cylinder or ball receptacles revolving\r\nin heated chambers, the degree of heat reaching about 420° Fahr. The\r\ncylinder type of roaster is invariably used in the United States; while\r\nboth the cylinder and the ball types are popular in England, France,\r\nGermany, Holland, and other foreign countries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ENGLISH FOUR-MACHINE GAS COFFEE-ROASTING PLANT\r\n\r\nThe equipment includes three Morewood indirect-flame, and one quick\r\ndirect-flame machines]\r\n\r\nEach roasterman has his own opinion about the fuel that gives the best\r\nresult, and throughout the world the choice lies between anthracite\r\ncoal, coke, and gas; though hard wood is frequently used in countries\r\nwhere other fuels are not available or not economical. Electric heat has\r\nbeen tried for commercial roasting in Germany (1906), in England (1909),\r\nand in the United States (1918); but the experimenters have always found\r\nthe cost of electric fuel to be prohibitive in competition with coal and\r\ngas. An electric roaster was demonstrated at the Food Conservation Show\r\nin New York, in 1918, at a time when the federal government was urging\r\nthe necessity of conserving coal as a war economy measure. The inventor\r\nclaimed that his machine would reduce roasting cost, improve the flavor\r\nand the aroma, and maintain a constant and easily controlled heat. He\r\ndeclared also that when roasted in his devices, less coffee was required\r\nfor brewing.\r\n\r\nAn expert coffee-roasting-machinery man who has been working on the\r\ndevelopment of a practical electric roaster says that if it were\r\npossible to bake the coffee in an oven, just as the baker does his\r\nbread, the fuel cost would then compare favorably with that of gas or\r\ncoal. It is because the heat chamber must have an exhaust to release the\r\nchaff and smoke that the use of electricity to replace the heat loss\r\nproves prohibitive when compared with coal or gas.\r\n\r\nIn all types of coal and coke burning roasters, the cylinders are heated\r\nby a fire underneath; while in gas roasters, the flame may be underneath\r\nor within the cylinder itself. Roasters in which the heat is within the\r\ncylinder are known as direct-flame or inner-heated machines. All three\r\nsystems are used in the United States and Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Facts About Coffee Roasting_\r\n\r\nThe modern commercial roasting outfit is as near fool-proof as human\r\ngenius has been able to devise. The more advanced types are almost\r\nautomatic in operation, and are designed to insure uniformity of roasts.\r\nIn such machines the green coffee is conveyed to the roasting cylinder\r\nby means of bucket elevators, which pour the beans into a feed hopper.\r\nFrom the feed hopper, the coffee is dumped through the opening in the\r\nfront head-piece into the cylinder. The cylinder is perforated, and has\r\ninside flanges which keep tossing the coffee about while the cylinder\r\nrevolves, so that the coffee will not burn during the roasting process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GERMAN GAS COFFEE-ROASTING PLANT EQUIPPED WITH\r\nIDEAL-RAPID MACHINES]\r\n\r\nTo roast coffee by coal or coke usually requires from twenty-five to\r\nthirty minutes, depending on the moisture-content of the beans; whether\r\nthey are spongy or flinty; whether a light, medium, or dark roast is\r\ndesired; and on the skill of the operator. Gas roasting requires from\r\nfifteen to twenty minutes. The quicker the roast, the better the coffee,\r\nis the opinion of many trade leaders, one of whom[325] says:\r\n\r\n     It is a growing belief that in roasts of short duration the largest\r\n     percentage of the aromatic properties is retained. A slow roast has\r\n     the effect of baking and does not give full development; also, slow\r\n     roasts seldom produce bright roasts, and they usually make the\r\n     coffee hard instead of brittle, even when the color standard has\r\n     been attained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRENCH GAS COFFEE-ROASTING PLANT EQUIPPED WITH MODERNE\r\nMACHINES]\r\n\r\nWhile coffees of widely varying degrees of moisture require somewhat\r\ndifferent treatment, the consensus of opinion is that the best results\r\nare obtained from a slow fire at the beginning, until some of the\r\nmoisture has been driven off, when the stronger application of heat may\r\nbe given for development. An intense heat in the beginning often results\r\nin \"tipping\", or charring, the little germ at the end, the most\r\nsensitive part of the bean.\r\n\r\nScorched beans have been caught at some point in the cylinder, often in\r\na bent flange. Burning on one face, sometimes called \"kissing the\r\ncheeks\", is caused by the too rapid revolution of the cylinder, so that\r\nsome of the coffee \"carries over\". In the best practise, crowding of\r\ncylinders is avoided; many roasters making it a rule not to exceed\r\nninety percent of the rated capacity of the cylinder.\r\n\r\nThose operating gas roasters may effect a fuel economy by running a low\r\ngrade coffee in the cylinder after the last roast has been drawn and the\r\ngas extinguished; five minutes' revolution absorbs the heat and drives\r\noff a proportion of moisture. The coffee, which may then be left in the\r\ncylinder, requires less time and fuel in the morning, and the roast is\r\nfinished while the cylinder is warming up. Double roasting brightens a\r\nroast, but is a detriment to the cup quality. A dull roasting coffee may\r\nbe improved by revolving the green coffee in a cylinder without heat for\r\ntwenty minutes, which has the effect of milling.\r\n\r\nThe use of a small amount of water upon roasts gives better control by\r\nchecking the roast at the proper point--the crucial time of its greatest\r\nheat; also, it swells and brightens the coffee, and tends to close the\r\nouter pores. While the addition of water is open to abuse, few roasters\r\nhave soaked their coffees enough to offset the natural shrinkage as much\r\nas three or four percent. Such practise would result greatly to the\r\ndetriment of the cup quality.\r\n\r\nThere is no universal standard for the degree to which coffee should be\r\nroasted. In the United States, there are demands for all degrees; from\r\nthe light roast, in favor in England, to the extremely dark roast in\r\nvogue in France, Italy, Brazil, Turkey, and in the producing countries.\r\nThe North American trade recognizes these different roasts: light,\r\ncinnamon, medium, high, city, full city, French, and Italian. The city\r\nroast is a dark bean, while full city is a few degrees darker. In the\r\nFrench roast, the bean is cooked until the natural oil appears on the\r\nsurface; and in the Italian, it is roasted to the point of actual\r\ncarbonization, so that it can be easily powdered. Germany likes a roast\r\nsimilar to the French type; while Scandinavia prefers the high Italian\r\nroast.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, the lighter roast is favored on the Pacific coast;\r\nthe darkest, in the South; and a medium-colored roast, in the Eastern\r\nstates. The cinnamon roast is most favored by the trade in Boston.\r\n\r\nWhile coffee roasting in the United States usually takes from fifteen to\r\nthirty minutes, depending on the fuel and the machine employed,\r\nmanufacturers of gas machines on the German market claim to roast it in\r\nsuperior fashion in from three and a half to ten minutes.[326] This\r\nsubject is discussed more in detail in chapter XXXIV.\r\n\r\nCoffee loses weight during the roasting process, the loss varying\r\naccording to the degree of roasting and the nature of the bean. Coffee\r\nroasters figure, however, that the average loss is sixteen percent of\r\nthe weight of the green bean. It has been estimated that one hundred\r\npounds of coffee in the cherry produces twenty-five pounds in the\r\nparchment; that one hundred pounds in parchment produces eighty-four\r\npounds of cleaned coffee; and that one hundred pounds of cleaned coffee\r\nproduces eighty-four pounds roasted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUMBO COFFEE ROASTER, IN THE ARBUCKLE COFFEE-ROASTING\r\nPLANT, NEW YORK\r\n\r\nThere are four of these machines. The cylinders are twelve feet in\r\ndiameter, six feet deep, and can roast 5,000 pounds of coffee every\r\nhalf-hour. The hard-coal brick furnace is seen at the left, from which a\r\nblower forces the heated air through a pipe into the revolving cylinder\r\nof coffee. The coffee is fed from above and is emptied into the cooling\r\npans beneath]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EIGHT-CYLINDER GAS COFFEE-ROASTING PLANT\r\n\r\nA view of Reid, Murdoch & Co.'s roasting room, Chicago, equipped with\r\nMonitor machines]\r\n\r\nDuring the roasting process the coffee undergoes a great chemical\r\nchange. After it has been in the cylinder a short time, the color of the\r\nbean becomes a yellowish brown, which gradually deepens as it cooks.\r\nLikewise, as the beans become heated, they shrivel up until about half\r\ndone, or at the \"developing\" point. At this stage, they begin to swell,\r\nand then \"pop open\", increasing fifty percent in bulk.[327] This is when\r\nthe experienced roasterman turns on all the heat he can command to\r\nfinish the roasting as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_\"Dry\" and \"Wet\" Roasts_\r\n\r\nAt frequent intervals, he thrusts his \"trier\"--an instrument shaped\r\nsomewhat like an elongated spoon--into the cylinder, and takes out a\r\nsample of coffee to compare with his type sample. When the coffee is\r\ndone, he shuts off the heat and checks the cooking by reducing the\r\ntemperature of the coffee and of the cylinder as quickly as can be done.\r\nIn the wet roast method he will spray the coffee, while the cylinder is\r\nstill revolving, with three to four quarts of water to every 130 pounds\r\nof coffee. In the dry method he depends altogether upon his cooling\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nRoasters generally are not in favor of the excessive watering of coffee\r\nin and after the roasting process for the purpose of reducing shrinkage.\r\n\"Heading\" the coffee, or checking the roast before turning it out of the\r\nroasting cylinder, is quite another matter and is considered legitimate.\r\nWhere coffees are watered in the cylinder at the close of the roast to\r\nreduce the shrinkage, it is possible to get back only about four percent\r\nof the shrinkage by such treatment and the practise is frowned upon by\r\nthe best roasters.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, water is turned into the roasting cylinder to quench\r\nthe roast. The amount varies with the style of machine, whether gas or\r\ncoal. Usually the water turns to steam, and the result is not an\r\nabsorption of the water but a momentary checking of the roast with a\r\ntendency to swell and to brighten the coffee. This is, comparatively\r\nspeaking, a \"dry roast\", but not an absolutely dry roast. It is doubtful\r\nif more than one percent of American coffee roasters employ an\r\nabsolutely \"dry\" roast--it does not give satisfactory results. The word\r\nhas been abused for advertising purposes. Of course, a dry roasted\r\ncoffee is a better article for making a satisfactory beverage than one\r\nthat has been soaked with water; but the word \"dry\" must be given a\r\ndefinite meaning, which the trade generally will agree to uphold, if it\r\nis to have any real meaning or value to the consumer. Until some\r\nstandard for roasted coffee shall be established, it is to be feared the\r\nterm \"dry roast\" will continue to be used for coffee roasted by almost\r\nany other process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UPPER-STORY VIEW OF A JUBILEE PLANT, SHOWING ROASTER,\r\nCOOLER, AND STONER EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nThe parts under roasting-room floor are shown in the illustration below]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOWER-STORY VIEW OF THE SAME PLANT FROM ABOUT THE SAME\r\nANGLE\r\n\r\nShowing connection from floor hopper to stoner on the left, and\r\nsuspended bucket-elevator boot with four-bag dump hopper on the right]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETE GAS COFFEE-PLANT INSTALLATION]\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Chemistry held a hearing in 1914 at Washington, at which\r\nthe question of a ruling on watering coffees was discussed. The trade\r\nwas well represented, but no agreement was reached. It was deemed\r\ninadvisable to make a definite rule on the watering of coffee; because\r\nthe water content can not be controlled, as the bean starts to absorb\r\nmoisture as soon as it leaves the roaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On Roasting Coffee Efficiently_\r\n\r\nA.L. Burns, New York, is well qualified to speak on this subject. He\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     Roasting coffee is not so difficult a matter as is often claimed by\r\n     operators and \"experts\" who seek thus to magnify their importance;\r\n     but it is nevertheless a process about which a great deal may be\r\n     learned in the school of practical experience. With one of our\r\n     modern machines anybody with ordinary intelligence and nerve can\r\n     take off a roast after one trial which would pass muster in many\r\n     establishments, but that same person applying himself to the\r\n     roasting job for a week will either be turning out vastly better\r\n     roasts or will have demonstrated that he never can excel as a\r\n     roasterman.\r\n\r\n     Modern coffee roasting machines provide for easy control of the\r\n     heat (from coal, coke, or gas fuel), for constantly mixing the\r\n     coffee in such a manner that the heat is transmitted uniformly to\r\n     the entire batch, for carrying away all steam and smoke rapidly,\r\n     for easy testing of the progress of the roast, and for immediate\r\n     discharge when desired. The operator's problem therefore is the\r\n     regulation of the heat and deciding just when the desired roasting\r\n     has been accomplished.\r\n\r\n     If all coffees were alike, roasting would soon be almost automatic.\r\n     In some plants most of the work is on one uniform grade or blend.\r\n     But coffees which vary greatly in moisture-content, in flinty or\r\n     spongy nature, and in various other characteristics, will puzzle\r\n     the operator until he establishes a personal acquaintance with them\r\n     in various combinations in repeated roasting operations. The\r\n     roasterman therefore must be able to observe closely, to draw\r\n     sensible conclusions, and to remember what he learns. Roasting\r\n     coffee is work of a sort which anybody can do, which a few people\r\n     can do really well, and no one so well but that further improvement\r\n     is possible.\r\n\r\n     There is no absolute standard of what the best roasting results\r\n     are. Some dealers want the coffee beans swelled up to the bursting\r\n     point, while others would object to so showy a development. Some\r\n     care nothing at all about appearance as compared with cup value,\r\n     while others insist on a bright style even at some sacrifice of\r\n     quality. Business judgment must decide what goods can be sold most\r\n     profitably.\r\n\r\n     The loss of coffee in weight in the roasting operation, or\r\n     shrinkage as it is called, is a matter which offers opportunities\r\n     for false claims of advantage in roasting processes. Anybody can\r\n     see that if just as good roasted coffee could be produced with a\r\n     lessened shrinkage there would be a chance for a decided increase\r\n     in profits. It is a sort of finding-money proposition which always\r\n     turns out to be too good to be true. The purpose of roasting coffee\r\n     is to produce an article entirely different from green coffee,\r\n     which is accomplished mainly by driving out moisture. If coffee is\r\n     roasted thoroughly, inside as well as outside, so as to give the\r\n     greatest roasted coffee value, it must sustain a proper loss in\r\n     weight which there is no legitimate way to avoid. The amount of\r\n     shrinkage varies a great deal with the kind of coffee and its age,\r\n     also with the kind of roasting desired.\r\n\r\n     Adding a little water to the coffee at the end of the operation has\r\n     the advantage of checking the roast at the desired point and\r\n     helping to swell and brighten the coffee, but it is a practice\r\n     which is sometimes abused by soaking the coffee with water so as to\r\n     reduce the shrinkage. This is done either dishonestly, to steal\r\n     coffee which belongs to somebody else, or foolishly; for the\r\n     heavier coffee has a lessened cup value which more than\r\n     counterbalances the apparent gain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURNS JUBILEE GAS ROASTER]\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Typical Coal Roaster_\r\n\r\nA typical United States coal roaster is shown in the accompanying cut.\r\nIt is the latest form of that type of Burns machine which requires a\r\nbrickwork setting. The picture shows the roaster ready to operate,\r\nexcept for smoke pipe and power connections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURNS COAL ROASTER WITH BRICKWORK SETTING]\r\n\r\nThe front of the machine shown has a cast-iron plate having brackets\r\nwhich support the cylinder front bearing, and double fire doors below\r\nfor the furnace and the ash pit. The movable part of the roaster is\r\nhidden by the front head, a heavy casting which stands still except when\r\nmoved by hand through a half-turn for feeding and discharging.\r\n\r\nThe cylinder is driven by gears at the back, revolving constantly at\r\nuniform speed. The inside of the cylinder is arranged with\r\nreverse-spiral flanges which mix the coffee perfectly and make uneven\r\nroasting impossible; and they discharge promptly every grain of coffee\r\nwhen the front-head opening is turned to the lower position.

beautifully uniform in appearance\",\r\nsays A.L. Burns, \"may lose all uniformity by delayed or inadequate\r\ncooling. Separated beans of coffee will cool off by themselves; but when\r\nheaped together, the inner part of the mass will get hotter and even\r\ntake fire.... Coffee must be spread over a considerable surface, or all\r\nkept moving, and have at the same time a lot of air forced through it.\r\nOtherwise, there will be some darkening and over-development of part of\r\nthe coffee, and a loss of the uniformity which is the first requirement\r\nof good roasting.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONITOR GAS ROASTER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GROUP OF ROASTING-ROOM ACCESSORIES]\r\n\r\nThe cooling apparatus consists of a movable, box-like metal car which\r\ncan be brought up to the front of the roaster to the revolving\r\ncylinders. The car has a perforated false bottom, to which is attached a\r\npowerful exhaust-fan system that sucks the heat out of the coffee. In\r\nlarge plants, utilizing two or more floors, the tilting-type cooling\r\ncar is favored. This car permits instant discharge through an opening in\r\nthe floor into a receiving tank suspended from the ceiling below and\r\nconnected with the stoning apparatus. Recently, a flexible-arm cooler\r\nhas been invented that provides full fan suction to a cooler car at all\r\npoints in its track travel from the roaster to the emptying position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DUMPING THE ROAST IN A COAL ROASTING PLANT\r\n\r\nThe roasted coffee is being turned into the cooling car, equipped with a\r\nswinging \"flexarm\" that keeps it always in connection with a suspended\r\nheader pipe; the cooling being started as soon as the coffee leaves the\r\nroaster. The cooled coffee, by tipping the box, goes into a floor\r\nhopper]\r\n\r\nThe stoner, an essential part of the modern roasting plant, has for its\r\nfunction the removal of stones and other foreign matter of which the\r\ngreen-coffee operations have failed to get rid. The stoner is usually\r\nbuilt in direct combination with the cooling equipment, and does its\r\nwork by means of a gravity separation in an upward-moving column of air.\r\nThe coffee passes into the suction boot of the stoner, either directly\r\nfrom the cooler box or from a floor hopper into which the cooler dumps,\r\nand is carried up the stoner pipe, or \"riser\", by an air current of\r\nample power which can be accurately regulated. This insures the carrying\r\nup of coffee only, the stones remaining at the bottom of the machine and\r\nbeing dumped at intervals into a pan underneath. The coffee, passing up\r\nthe riser pipe, is delivered into a large \"stoner hopper\" which is\r\nusually hung to the ceiling of the roasting room. The correct\r\nconstruction of this hopper is of great importance, as the coffee must\r\nbe deposited completely without breakage, and the air must pass on\r\nthrough the suction fan carrying nothing except bits of loose chaff.\r\n\r\nA different type of cooler is in the form of an upright cylinder,\r\nconsisting of two metal perforated drums, one set within the other. The\r\ninner drum is sufficiently small to allow the coffee to move freely\r\nbetween the drums. Inside the smaller one is an exhaust pipe which draws\r\nthe heat and chaff out of the coffee. This device is recommended for use\r\nonly in connection with wet roasted coffee.\r\n\r\nStill another type consists of a single perforated cylinder set\r\nhorizontal with the floor, and revolving alongside of an exhaust box\r\nwhich sucks out the heat and chaff as the coffee is tumbled about in the\r\ncylinder. A rocking type, that is not generally employed, is constructed\r\non the principle of the screen used by housebuilders to separate coarse\r\nsand from the fine, and is pivoted at the middle so that it can be\r\nrocked end to end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FOUR-BAG COFFEE FINISHER]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Finishing or Glazing_\r\n\r\nFinishing whole-bean roasted coffee, by giving it a friction polish\r\nwhile it is still moist, using a glaze solution or water only, is a\r\npractise not harmful if the proper solutions are employed. Roasted\r\ncoffee dulls in ordinary handling, and it is claimed that coating not\r\nonly improves its appearance, but serves also to preserve the natural\r\nflavor and aroma of the bean. A machine having flat-sided wooden\r\ncylinders with ventilated heads, and operated two-thirds full of coffee\r\nso as to get an effective rolling motion, is generally employed.\r\nCoatings composed of sugar and eggs are popular, but their use should be\r\nstated on the label.\r\n\r\nCoffee roasters are divided on this question of coffee-coating. The best\r\nthought of the trade is undoubtedly opposed to the practise when it is\r\ndone to conceal inferiority or abnormally to reduce shrinkage. Some New\r\nYork coffee roasters, who made a thorough investigation of the matter,\r\nfound coating coffee with a wholesome material not injurious and the\r\ncoated coffee better in the cup. Dr. Harvey W. Wiley found, in the\r\ncelebrated Ohio case against Arbuckle Brothers, that coating coffee with\r\nsugar and eggs produced beneficial results, and that the coating\r\npreserved the bean. The Bureau of Chemistry has never issued any ruling\r\non the subject of coating coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Blending Roasted Coffee_\r\n\r\nAfter cooling and stoning, unless it is to be polished or glazed, the\r\ncoffee is ready for grinding and packing if it has been blended in the\r\ngreen state. Otherwise, the next step will be to mix the different\r\nvarieties before grinding, although some packers blend the different\r\nkinds after they have been ground. To mix whole-bean roasted coffee\r\nwithout hurting its appearance is rather difficult, and there is no\r\nregular machine for such work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURNS SAMPLE-COFFEE ROASTER]\r\n\r\nRarely is a single kind of coffee drunk straight. The common practise in\r\nall countries is to mix different varieties having opposing\r\ncharacteristics so as to obtain a smoother beverage. This is called\r\nblending, a process that has attained the standing of an art in the\r\nUnited States. Most package coffees are blends. In addition to other\r\nqualities, the practical coffee blender must have a natural aptitude for\r\nthe work. He must also have long experience before he becomes\r\nproficient, and must be acquainted with the different properties of all\r\nthe coffees grown, or at least of those that come to his market.\r\nFurthermore, he must know the variations in characteristics of current\r\ncrops; for in most coffees no two crops are equal in trade values.\r\nInnumerable blends are possible with more than a hundred different\r\ncoffees to draw upon.\r\n\r\nA blend may consist of two or more kinds of coffee, but the general\r\npractise is to employ several kinds; so that, if at any time one can not\r\nbe obtained, its absence from the blend will not be so noticeable as\r\nwould be the case if only two or three kinds were used.\r\n\r\nIn blending coffees, consideration is given first to the shades of\r\nflavor in the cup and next to price. The blender describes flavors as,\r\nacidy, bitter, smooth, neutral, flat, wild, grassy, groundy, sour,\r\nfermented, and hidey; and he mixes the coffees accordingly to obtain the\r\ndesired taste in the cup. Naturally the wild, sour, groundy, fermented,\r\nand hidey kinds are avoided as much as possible. Coffees with a Rio\r\nflavor are used only in the cheaper blends.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, a properly balanced blend should have a full rich\r\nbody as a basis; and to this should be added a growth to give it some\r\nacid character, and one to give it increased aroma.\r\n\r\nPersonal preference is the determining factor in making up a blend. Some\r\nblenders prefer a coffee with plenty of acid taste; while others choose\r\nthe non-acid cup. For the first-named kind, the blender will mix\r\ntogether the coffees that have an acidy characteristic; while for a\r\nnon-acidy blend, he will mix an acidy growth with one having a neutral\r\nflavor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAMBERT ECONOMIC COFFEE-ROASTING OUTFIT FOR COAL FIRE\r\n\r\nThis is a self-contained plant for one or two bags, and comprises a\r\nroaster, rotary cooler, elevator feed hopper, electric motor, and\r\nstoning and chaffing attachments. It may be equipped for gas]\r\n\r\nCoffees can be divided into four great classes, the neutral-flavored,\r\nthe sweet, the acidy, and the bitter. All East Indian coffees, except\r\nCeylons, Malabars, and the other Hindoostan growths, are classified as\r\nbitter, as are old brown Bucaramangas, brown Bogotas, and brown Santos.\r\nThe acid coffees are generally the new-crop washed varieties of the\r\nwestern hemisphere, such as Mexicans, Costa Ricas, Bogotas, Caracas,\r\nGuatemalas, Santos, etc. However, the acidity may be toned down by age\r\nso that they become sweet or sweet-bitter. Red Santos is generally a\r\nsweet coffee, and is prized by blenders. High-grade washed Santo Domingo\r\nand Haiti coffees are sweet both when new crop and when aged.\r\n\r\nPractical coffee blenders do not mix two new-crop acid coffees, or two\r\nold-crop bitter kinds, unless their bitterness or acidity is\r\ncounteracted by coffees with opposite flavors. One blender insists that\r\nevery blend should contain three coffees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHALLENGE PULVERIZER]\r\n\r\nSome Bourbon and flat-beaned Santos coffees are better when new, and\r\nsome are better when old; but a blend of fine old-crop coffee with a\r\nsnappy new-crop coffee gives a better result than either separately. A\r\nnew-crop Bourbon and an old yellow flat bean make a better blend than a\r\nnew-crop flat bean and an old-crop Bourbon. Probably the very best\r\nresult in a low-priced blend may be obtained by using one-half old-crop\r\nBourbon Santos with one-half new-crop Haiti or Santo Domingo of the\r\ncheaper grades.\r\n\r\nTypical low-priced coffee blends in the United States may be made up of\r\na good Santos, possibly a Bourbon, and some low-cost Mexican, Central\r\nAmerican, Colombian, or Venezuelan coffee, the Santos counteracting\r\nthese acidy Milds.\r\n\r\nGoing next higher in the scale of price, fancy old Bourbon Santos is\r\nused with one-third fancy old Cucuta or a good Trujillo.\r\n\r\nFor a blend costing about five cents more a pound retail, one-third\r\nfancy old Cucuta or Merida is blended with fancy old Bourbon Santos.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONITOR COFFEE-GRANULATING MACHINE]\r\n\r\nThe highest-priced blend may contain two-thirds of a fine private estate\r\nSumatra and one-third Mocha or Longberry Harari.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLES NO. 22 GRINDING MILL]\r\n\r\nAlfred W. McCann, while advertising manager for Francis H. Leggett &\r\nCo., New York, in 1910, evolved a new coffee distinction based on the\r\nargument that certain coffees like Mochas, Mexicans, Bourbons, and Costa\r\nRicas were developed in the cup through the action on them of cream or\r\nmilk; while others, such as Bogotas, Javas, Maracaibos, etc., flattened\r\nout when cream or milk was added. He argued, accordingly, that breakfast\r\ncoffees should be made up from the former, but that the latter should\r\nnot be used except for after-dinner coffees, to be drunk black.[328]\r\nWilliam B. Harris, then coffee expert for the United States Department\r\nof Agriculture, took issue with Mr. McCann, claiming that if a coffee is\r\nwatery and lacks body, it will not take kindly to milk or cream, not\r\nbecause the chemical action of milk or cream flattens it out, but\r\nbecause there is nothing there in the first place. The strength of the\r\nbrew being equal, all coffees will take cream or milk, Mr. Harris\r\nheld.[329]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURNS NO. 12 GRINDING MILL\r\n\r\nDesigned for hotel and restaurant trade]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONITOR STEEL-CUT GRINDER, SEPARATOR, AND CHAFFER]\r\n\r\nM.J. McGarty said in 1915 that he had tried out many coffees in the cup,\r\nand could not see that adding milk made any difference. However, he\r\nfound that sometimes a line of coffees will contain a sample that\r\nflattens out at the drinking point (the point where the boiling water\r\nhas cooled to permit of its being drunk); and he thought this was what\r\nMr. McCann had in mind, as, by adding milk to such a coffee, it was\r\nbrought back to the drinking point. In other words, it was Mr. McGarty's\r\nopinion that, in blending coffees, those coffees which hold their own\r\nfrom the start, or boiling point, until they become cold, or even\r\nimprove right through, are more desirable for blending purposes; and\r\nthat those that are best at the drinking point should be given the\r\npreference.[330]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Blends for Restaurants_\r\n\r\nWilliam B. Harris[331] believes that the coffee of prime importance in\r\npreparing restaurant blends is Bogota. He advises the use of a\r\nfull-bodied Bogota and an acid Bourbon Santos in the proportion of\r\nthree-fourths Bogota to one-fourth Santos. Blends may also be made up\r\nfrom combinations of Bogota, Mexicans, and Guatemalas.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Harris, the average blend of good coffee when made up,\r\ntwo and one-half pounds of coffee to five gallons of water, will produce\r\na liquor of good color and strength. For many hotels, however, this may\r\nnot answer, as it is not heavy enough. More coffee must then be used, or\r\nten percent of chicory added. A blend with chicory can be made by using\r\ntwo-thirds Bogota, one-third Bourbon Santos, and ten percent chicory.\r\nNo steward, hotel man, or restaurant man should, however, advertise\r\n\"coffee\" on his menu, and then serve a drink employing chicory; because,\r\nwhile there is no federal law against such a practise, there are state\r\nlaws against it. Chicory is all right in its place; and many prefer a\r\ndrink made from coffee and chicory; but such a drink can not properly be\r\ncalled coffee.\r\n\r\nHotel men should purchase their coffee in the bean, and do their own\r\ngrinding. Then they need never have cause to complain that their coffee\r\nman deceived them, or that some salesman misled them. The hotel steward\r\nwishing to furnish his patrons with a heavy-bodied coffee, particularly\r\na black after-dinner coffee, _without chicory_, will use three, four, or\r\neven four and one-half pounds of ground coffee to five gallons of water.\r\n\r\nWith so wide a choice of coffees to choose from, a coffee blender can\r\nmake up many combinations to meet the demands of his trade. Probably no\r\ntwo blenders use exactly the same varieties in exactly the same\r\nproportions to make up a blend to sell at the same price. However, they\r\nall follow the same general principles laid down in the foregoing flavor\r\nclassification of the world's coffees.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grinding and Packaging Coffee_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHNSON CARTON-FILLING, WEIGHING, AND SEALING MACHINE]\r\n\r\nUnless the coffee is to be sold in the bean, it is sent to the grinding\r\nand packing department, to be further prepared for the consumer. Since\r\nthe federal food law has been in effect, the public has gained\r\nconfidence in ground and bean coffee in packages; and today a large part\r\nof the coffee consumed in the United States is sold in one and two pound\r\ncartons and cans, already blended and ready for brewing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE IDEAL STEEL-CUT MILL]\r\n\r\nA progressive coffee-packing house may have three different styles of\r\ngrinding machines; one called the granulator for turning out the\r\nso-called \"steel-cut\" coffee; the second, a pulverizer for making a\r\nreally fine grind; and the third, a grinding mill for general factory\r\nwork and producing a medium-ground coffee.\r\n\r\nCommercial coffee-grinding machines are alike in principle in all\r\ncountries, the beans being crushed or broken between toothed or\r\ncorrugated metal or stone members, one revolving and the other being\r\nstationary. While all grinding machines are alike in principle, they may\r\nvary in capacity and design. The average granulator will turn out about\r\nfive hundred pounds of \"steel-cut\" coffee in an hour; the pulverizer,\r\nfrom seventy-five to two hundred pounds; and the average grinding mill\r\nfrom five hundred to six hundred pounds. Some types of grinding machines\r\nhave chaff-removing attachments to remove, by air suction, the chaff\r\nfrom the coffee as it is being ground.\r\n\r\nA large number of trade terms for designating different grinds of coffee\r\nare used in the United States, some of them meaning the same thing,\r\nwhile similar names are sometimes contradictory. A canvass of the\r\nleading American coffee packers in 1917[332] discovered that there were\r\nfifteen terms in use, and that there were thirty-four different meanings\r\nattached to them. For the term \"fine\" there were five different\r\ndefinitions; \"medium\" had five; \"coarse\", seven; \"pulverized\", four;\r\n\"steel-cut\", seven; \"ground\", two; \"powdered\", one; \"percolator\", two;\r\n\"steel-cut-chaff-removed\", one; \"Turkish ground\", one; while\r\n\"granulated\", \"Greek ground\", \"extra fine\", \"standard\", and \"regular\"\r\nwere not defined.\r\n\r\nThe term \"steel-cut\" is generally understood to mean that in the\r\ngrinding process the chaff has been removed and an approximate\r\nuniformity of granules has been obtained by sifting. The term does not\r\nnecessarily mean that the grinding mills have steel burrs. In fact, most\r\nfirms employ burrs made of cast-iron or of a composition metal known as\r\n\"burr metal\", because of its combined hardness and toughness.\r\n\r\nThe \"steel-cut\" idea is another of those sophistries for which American\r\nadvertising methods have been largely responsible in the development of\r\nthe package-coffee business in the United States. The term \"steel-cut\"\r\nlost all its value as an advertising catchword for the original user\r\nwhen every other dealer began to use it, no matter how the ground coffee\r\nwas produced. When the public has been taught that coffee should be\r\n\"steel-cut\", it is hard to sell it ground coffee unless it is called\r\n\"steel-cut\"; although a truer education of the consumer would have\r\ncaused him to insist on buying whole bean coffee to be ground at home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SMYSER PACKAGE-MAKING-AND-FILLING MACHINE AT THE ARBUCKLE\r\nPLANT, NEW YORK\r\n\r\nThis machine was invented by Henry E. Smyser of Philadelphia, who\r\nsecured the first patent in 1880, but it has been much improved by the\r\nArbuckle engineers. The half shown on the left makes the one-pound paper\r\nbags complete, including the separate lining of parchment, fills the\r\nbag, automatically inserts a premium list at the same time, packs it\r\ndown, seals it, and delivers it on a short conveyor to the other half\r\n(shown on the right) where the package is wrapped in the outside\r\nglassine paper and pushed out on a table for the girls to put into\r\nshipping cases]\r\n\r\n\"Steel-cut\" coffee, that is, a medium-ground coffee with the chaff blown\r\nout, does not compare in cup test with coffee that has been more\r\nscientifically ground and not given the chaff removal treatment that is\r\nlargely associated in the public mind with the idea of the steel-cut\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACHINE FOR AUTOMATICALLY PACKING COFFEE IN CARTONS\r\n\r\nFive distinct operations are performed by the units comprising this\r\nPneumatic installation, viz., carton-feeding, bottom-sealing, lining,\r\nweighing and top-sealing]\r\n\r\nAccording to the results of the trade canvass previously referred to, it\r\nwould appear that the terms most suited to convey the right idea of the\r\ndifferent grades of grinding, and likely to be acceptable to the\r\ngreatest number, would be \"coarse\" (for boiling, and including all the\r\ncoarser grades); \"medium\" (for coffee made in the ordinary pot,\r\nincluding the so-called \"steel-cut\"); \"fine\" (like granulated sugar, and\r\nused for percolators); \"very fine\" (like cornmeal, and used for drip or\r\nfiltration methods); \"powdered\" (like flour, and used for Turkish\r\ncoffee).\r\n\r\nCoffee begins to lose its strength immediately after roasting, the rate\r\nof loss increasing rapidly after grinding. In a test carried out by a\r\nMichigan coffee packer,[333] it was discovered that a mixture of a very\r\nfine with a coarse grind gives the best results in the cup. It was also\r\ndetermined that coarse ground coffee loses its strength more rapidly\r\nthan the medium ground; while the latter deteriorates more quickly than\r\na fine ground; and so on, down the scale. His conclusions were that the\r\nmost satisfactory grind for putting into packages that are likely to\r\nstand for some time before being consumed is a mixture consisting of\r\nabout ninety percent finely ground coffee and ten percent coarse. His\r\ntheory is that the fine grind supplies sufficiently high body\r\nextraction; the coarse, the needful flavor and aroma. On this irregular\r\ngrind a United States patent (No. 14,520) has been granted, in which the\r\ninventor claims that the ninety percent of fine eliminates the\r\ninterstices--that allow too free ventilation in a coarse ground\r\ncoffee--and consequently prevents the loss of the highly volatile\r\nconstituents of the ten percent of coarse-ground particles, and at the\r\nsame time gives a full-body extraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Making and Filling Containers_\r\n\r\nAs stated before, a large proportion of the coffee sold in the United\r\nStates is put up into packages, ready for brewing. Such containers are\r\ngrouped under the name of the material of which they are made; such as\r\ntin, fiber, cardboard, paper, wood, and combinations of these materials,\r\nsuch as a fiber can with tin top and bottom. Generally, coffee\r\ncontainers are lined with chemically treated paper or foil to keep in\r\nthe aroma and flavor, and to keep out moisture and contaminating odors.\r\n\r\nAs the package business grew in the United States, the machinery\r\nmanufacturers kept pace; until now there are machines that, in one\r\ncontinuous operation, open up a \"flat\" paper carton, seal the bottom\r\nfold, line the carton with a protecting paper, weigh the coffee as it\r\ncomes down from an overhead hopper into the carton, fold the top and\r\nseal it, and then wrap the whole package in a waxed or paraffined\r\npaper, delivering the package ready for shipment without having been\r\ntouched by a human hand from the first operation to the last. Such a\r\nmachine can put out fifteen to eighteen thousand packages a day.\r\n\r\nAnother type of machine automatically manufactures two and three-ply\r\npaper cans such as are used widely for cereal packages. It winds the\r\nribbons of heavy paper in a spiral shape, automatically gluing the\r\npapers together to make a can that will not permit its contents to leak\r\nout. The machine turns out its product in long cylinders, like mailing\r\ntubes, which are cut into the desired lengths to make the cans. The\r\npaper or tin tops and bottoms are stamped out on a punch press.\r\n\r\nCoffee cans are generally filled by hand; that is, the can is placed\r\nunder the spout of an automatic filling and weighing machine by an\r\noperator who slips on the cover when the can is properly filled. The\r\nweighing machine has a hopper which lets the coffee down into a device\r\nthat gauges the correct amount, say a pound or two pounds, and then\r\npours it into the can. The machine weighs the can and its contents, and\r\nif they do not show the exact predetermined weight, the device\r\nautomatically operates to supply the necessary quantity. After weighing,\r\nthe can is carried on a traveling belt to the labeling machine, where\r\nthe label is automatically applied and glued. Then the can is put\r\nthrough a drying compartment to make the label stick quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETE COFFEE-CARTONING OUTFIT IN OPERATION\r\n\r\nThe girl is feeding the \"flats\" into an Improved Johnson bottom-sealer.\r\nThe carton travels to a Scott weigher on the right and thence to the\r\ntop-sealer on the left]\r\n\r\nPaper bags are filled much the same way as the tin and the fiber cans.\r\nIn fact, some packers fill their paper and fiber cartons by the same\r\nsystem; although the tendency among the largest companies is to instal\r\nthe complete automatic packaging equipment, because of its speed and\r\neconomy in packaging. Frequently, the weighing machines are used in\r\nfilling wooden and fiber drums holding twenty-five, fifty, and one\r\nhundred pounds of coffee, to be sold in bulk to the retailer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE TYPES OF AUTOMATIC COFFEE-WEIGHING MACHINES\r\n\r\nLeft--Duplex net weigher. Center--Pneumatic cross-weight machine.\r\nRight--Scott net weigher]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Additions and Fillers_\r\n\r\nIn all large coffee-consuming countries, coffee additions and fillers\r\nhave always been used. Large numbers of French, Italian, Dutch, and\r\nGerman consumers insist on having chicory with their coffee, just as do\r\nmany Southerners in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe chief commercial reason for using coffee additions and fillers is to\r\nkeep down the cost of blends. For this purpose, chicory and many kinds\r\nof cooked cereals are most generally used; while frequently roasted and\r\nground peas, beans, and other vegetables that will not impair the flavor\r\nor aroma of the brew, are employed in foreign countries. Before\r\nParliament passed the Adulterant Act, some British coffee men used as\r\nfillers cacao husks, acorns, figs, and lupins, in addition to chicory\r\nand the other favorite fillers.\r\n\r\nUp to the year 1907, when the United States Food and Drugs Act became\r\neffective, chicory and cereal additions were widely used by coffee\r\npackers and retailers in this country. With the enforcement of the law\r\nrequiring the label of a package to state when a filler is employed, the\r\nuse of additions gradually fell off in most sections.\r\n\r\nIn botanical description and chemical composition chicory, the most\r\nfavored addition, has no relationship with coffee. When roasted and\r\nground, it resembles coffee in appearance; but it has an entirely\r\ndifferent flavor. However, many coffee-drinkers prefer their beverage\r\nwhen this alien flavor has been added to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Treated Coffees and Dry Extracts_\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of prepared, or refined, coffees has become an important\r\nbranch of the business in the United States and Europe. Prepared coffees\r\ncan be divided into two general groups: treated coffees, from which the\r\ncaffein has been removed to some degree; and dry coffee extracts\r\n(soluble coffee), which are readily dissolved in a cup of hot or cold\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nTo decaffeinate coffee, the most common practise is to make the green\r\nbeans soft by steaming under pressure, and then to apply benzol or\r\nchloroform or alcohol to the softened coffee to dissolve and to extract\r\nthe caffein. Afterward, the extracting solvents are driven out of the\r\ncoffee by re-steaming. However, chemists have not yet been able to expel\r\nall the caffein in treating coffee commercially, the best efforts\r\nresulting in from 0.3 to 0.07 percent remaining. After treatment, the\r\ncoffee beans are then roasted, packed, and sold like ordinary coffee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VACUUM DRUM DRIER\r\n\r\nVacuum drum drier, No. 1 size; diameter of drum, 12 inches; length, 20\r\ninches; used for converting coffee extract and other liquids into dry\r\npowder form.

The\r\ndrawing represents a larger size than the photograph, and while the\r\narrangement of some parts is slightly different, the principle of\r\noperation is the same.\r\n\r\nUNITS USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF SOLUBLE COFFEE]\r\n\r\nIn manufacturing dry coffee extract in the form of a powder that is\r\nreadily soluble in water, the general method is to extract the drinking\r\nproperties from ground roasted coffee by means of water, and to\r\nevaporate the resulting liquid until only the coffee powder is left.\r\nSeveral methods have been developed and patented to prevent the valuable\r\nflavor elements from being evaporated with the water.\r\n\r\nA typical dry-coffee-extract-making equipment consists of a battery of\r\npercolators, or \"leachers\", a vacuum evaporating device, and a vacuum\r\ndrier. The leachers do not differ materially from the ordinary\r\nrestaurant percolators, a battery usually including from three to seven\r\nunits, each charge of water going through all the percolations. The\r\nresulting heavy liquid then goes to the evaporator to be concentrated\r\ninto a thick liquor. The evaporator consists of a horizontal cylindrical\r\nvapor compartment connected with an inclined cylindrical steam chest in\r\nwhich are numerous tubes, or flues, that occupy almost the whole chest.\r\nThese tubes are heated by steam. The coffee liquor is passed through the\r\ntubes at high speed and thrown with great force against a baffle plate\r\nat the opening to the vapor chest. The vapor passes around the baffle\r\nplate to a separator. The liquor drops to the lower part of the\r\nsteam-chest (which is free from tubes), and is ready to be drawn out for\r\nthe next process, the drying.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, the extract is a heavily concentrated syrup and is ready\r\nto be converted into powder. This is done in the vacuum drier, which\r\nconsists of a hollow revolving drum surrounded by a tightly sealed\r\ncast-iron casing. The drum is heated by steam injected into its\r\ninterior, and is revolved in a high vacuum. In operation, a coating of\r\ncoffee liquor is applied automatically, by means of a special device, to\r\nthe outside of the drum. The liquor is taken by gravity from the\r\nreservoir containing the liquid supply and is forced upward by means of\r\na pump into the liquid supply pan, directly under the drum, with\r\nsufficient pressure to cause the liquid to adhere to the drum, the\r\nexcess liquor overflowing from the pan into the reservoir. The coating\r\non the drum is controlled or regulated by a spreader. The heat and the\r\nvacuum reduce the extract to a dry powder in less than one revolution of\r\nthe drum. As the drum completes three-quarters of a turn, a scraper\r\nknife removes the coffee powder, which is delivered to a receiver below\r\nthe drum. Modern vacuum-drum driers have a capacity of from twenty-five\r\nto five hundred pounds of dry soluble coffee per hour.\r\n\r\nC.W. Trigg and W.A. Hamor were granted a patent in the United States in\r\n1919 on a new process for making an aromatized coffee extract. In this\r\nprocess, the caffeol of the coffee is volatilized and is then brought\r\ninto contact with an absorbing medium such as is used in the extraction\r\nof perfumes. The absorbing medium is then treated with a solvent of the\r\ncaffeol, and the solution is separated from the petrolatum. Then the\r\ncoffee solution is concentrated to an extract by evaporation; after\r\nwhich, the extract and the caffeol are combined into a soluble coffee.\r\nFive additional patents were granted on this same process in 1921.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nWHOLESALE MERCHANDISING OF COFFEE\r\n\r\n     _How coffees are sold at wholesale--The wholesale salesman's place\r\n     in merchandising--Some coffee costs analyzed--Handy coffee-selling\r\n     chart--Terms and credits--About package coffees--Various types of\r\n     coffee containers--Coffee package labels--Coffee package\r\n     economies--Practical grocer helps--Coffee sampling--Premium method\r\n     of sales promotion_\r\n\r\n\r\nCoffee is sold at wholesale in the United States chiefly by about 4,000\r\nwholesale grocers, who handle also many other items of food; and by\r\nroasters, who make a specialty of preparing the green coffee for\r\nconsumption, and who feature either bulk or trade-marked package goods.\r\n\r\nMuch the largest proportion of the wholesale coffee trade today is made\r\nup of roasted coffees, though some wholesalers still sell the green bean\r\nto retail distributers who do their own roasting. Most of the roasted\r\ncoffee sold is ground; although in some parts of the United States there\r\nis at present a growing consumer demand for coffee in the bean. Of the\r\ncoffee sold in trade-marked packages in 1919 in the United States, about\r\nseventy-five percent was ground ready for brewing.\r\n\r\nThe larger wholesale houses generally confine their operations to the\r\nsection of the country in which they are located, but some of the\r\nbiggest coffee-packing firms seek national distribution. In both cases,\r\nbranch houses are usually established at strategic points to facilitate\r\nthe serving of retail customers with freshly roasted coffee at all\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, too, it has become a general practise for the home\r\noffices, or main headquarters, to advertise their product in magazines,\r\nnewspapers, street cars, and by mail and on billboards; while the\r\nbranches solicit trade in their territories by means of traveling\r\nsalesmen, local newspaper advertisements, booklets, circulars, and\r\ndemonstrations at food shows.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Wholesale Salesman_\r\n\r\nThe traveling salesman is probably the most effective agency in securing\r\nthe retailer's orders for coffee. A good coffee salesman not only sells\r\ncoffee, but he teaches his customer how he can best build up and hold\r\nhis coffee trade. He acquaints the retailer with all the talking points\r\nabout the coffee he handles, how to feature it in store displays and\r\nadvertisements, how to stage demonstrations and to work up special\r\nsales.\r\n\r\nIf he is a _good_ salesman, he does not permit the merchant to buy more\r\ncoffee than he can dispose of while it is still fresh. And he shows the\r\ndealer the folly of handling too many brands of package coffees. If he\r\nsells coffee in bulk, the efficient salesman has also a sound working\r\nknowledge of blending principles, and is able to suggest the kinds of\r\ncoffee to blend to suit the particular requirements of each grocer's\r\ntrade. In short, he takes an intelligent interest in his customer's\r\nbusiness, and co-operates with him in building up a local coffee trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some Coffee Costs Analyzed_\r\n\r\nIn estimating the price at which he must sell his coffee to make a fair\r\nprofit, the wholesale coffee merchant has many items of expense to\r\nconsider. To the cost of the green coffee he must add: the cost of\r\ntransportation to his plant; the loss in shrinkage in roasting, which\r\nranges from fifteen to twenty percent; packaging costs, if he is a\r\npacker; the items of expense in doing business, such as wages and\r\nsalaries, advertising, buying and selling, freight, express, warehouse\r\nand cartage, postage and office supplies, telephone and telegraph,\r\ncredit and collection; and the fixed overhead charges for interest,\r\nheat, light, power, insurance, taxes, repairs, equipment, depreciation,\r\nlosses from bad debts, and miscellaneous items.[334] The average loss\r\nfor bad debts among grocers in 1916 was 0.03 percent of the total sales,\r\naccording to the director of business research, Harvard University, who\r\nestimated also that the common figure for credit and collection expense\r\nwas 0.06 percent. The total cost of doing business has been estimated as\r\nranging between twelve and twenty percent of the total annual sales, so\r\nthat a bag of green coffee costing $16 in New York or New Orleans costs\r\nthe coffee packer in the Middle West from $22.33 to $24.56, according to\r\nthe expense of carrying on his business.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Terms and Credits_\r\n\r\nWholesale coffee trade contract terms and credits are not dissimilar\r\nfrom those in other lines of commerce. The wholesaler helps the retailer\r\nfinance his business to the extent of granting him thirty to sixty days\r\nin which to pay his bill, offering him a cash discount if the invoice is\r\npaid within ten days of date of sale. Until recent years, these terms\r\nwere frequently abused, the customer demanding much longer credits and\r\noften taking a ten-day cash discount after thirty or more days had\r\nelapsed. This abuse was particularly prevalent from 1907 to 1913, when\r\ncoffee prices were low and competition was especially keen.[335] In\r\naddition, the retailers often demanded special deliveries of supplies,\r\nwhich added to the wholesalers' costs; and some retailers refused to pay\r\nthe cost of cartage from the cars to their stores.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of high prices after the close of the World War, the\r\nwholesalers showed a tendency to tighten up their credit and discount\r\nterms, the National Coffee Roasters Association especially recommending\r\nthirty days' credit, or at most sixty days, and a maximum cash discount\r\nrate of two percent.\r\n\r\nAnother trade abuse which has been corrected almost altogether was the\r\npractise of \"selling coffee to be billed as shipped\"; that is, the\r\nwholesaler held coffee on order, and billed only when delivered, even\r\nthough several weeks or months had passed before shipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_About Package Coffees_\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of the twentieth century, the sale of coffee in\r\npackages has increased steadily until now (1922) this form of\r\ndistribution competes strongly with bulk coffee sales. While bulk coffee\r\nis still preferred in some eastern sections of the United States, coffee\r\npackers are making deep inroads there, to the extent that practically\r\nall high and medium grade retailers feature package coffees, either\r\nunder their own brand name, or that of a coffee specialty house.\r\n\r\nThe prime requisite for success in any package coffee is the composition\r\nof the blend. One of the leaders in the field, which we will call Y, is\r\nsaid to be composed of Bogota, Bourbon Santos, and Mexican. In March,\r\n1922, it was being sold at retail in New York for 42 cents. A competing\r\nbrand, which we will call Z, is said to be a blend of Bogota and Bourbon\r\nSantos. It was being sold at retail in New York, at the same period for\r\nthe same price. Simultaneously, in the retail stores of a well known\r\nchain system, a bulk blend composed of sixty percent Bourbon Santos and\r\nforty percent Bogota was to be had loose for 29 cents.\r\n\r\nThe second important factor that contributes to package coffee success\r\nis the container. It must be of such a character as will best preserve\r\nthe freshness--the flavor and the aroma of the coffee--until it reaches\r\nthe consumer.\r\n\r\nPackage coffee has not yet won universal favor. Some of the arguments\r\nused against it are: that the price is generally higher than the same\r\ngrade in bulk; that it leads to price-cutting by stores that can afford\r\nto sell it at about cost as a leader for other articles; that the margin\r\nof profit is frequently too close for some retailers: that when the\r\nmarket advances, some packers change their blends to keep down cost and\r\nto maintain the advertised price; and that, when packed ground, there is\r\na rapid loss of flavor, aroma, and strength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COAL ROASTING PLANT IN A NEW YORK FACTORY\r\n\r\nTHE ROASTED BEANS HAVE JUST BEEN DUMPED INTO THE COOLER BOX]\r\n\r\nCOFFEE-SELLING CHART\r\n\r\nBY A.J.

cost_\r\n\r\nFriends of package coffees point to the saving in time in handling in\r\nthe store; to the fact that the contents of a package are not\r\ncontaminated by odors or dirt; that the blends are prepared by experts\r\nand are always uniform; that the coffee is always properly roasted; and,\r\nin the case of package ground coffee, properly ground; that the brand\r\nnames are widely and consistently advertised; and that the retailer has\r\nthe benefit of the packer's co-operation in building up sales campaigns,\r\nby means of booklets and local advertising.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Various Types of Coffee Containers_\r\n\r\nFive types of containers are used for packing coffee, namely, cardboard\r\ncartons, paper bags, fiber or paper cans, tin cans, and composite (tin\r\nand fiber) cans and packages. Fiber packages include paraffin-lined as\r\nwell as those that have been chemically treated with other water-proof\r\nand flavor-retaining substances.\r\n\r\nThe carton is popular, because it takes up less room in storage and in\r\nshipment to the packing plant, and also because the label can be printed\r\ndirectly on the package. Another economy feature is its adaptability to\r\nthe automatic packaging machine, which transforms it from a flat sheet\r\ninto a wrapped and sealed package of coffee. Moisture-proof and\r\nflavor-retaining inner liners and outside wrappers are generally used to\r\nprevent rapid deterioration of the coffee's strength and aroma.\r\n\r\nPaper bags are the least expensive containers to be obtained; and when\r\nlined with foil or prepared paper, they are considered to be\r\nsatisfactory. Like the carton, the label can be printed directly on the\r\nbag. They also lend themselves to close packing in shipping cases.\r\n\r\nAnother popular type of container is the paper, or fiber, can which is\r\nmade of fiber board with a slip cover. Fiber cans are also made with\r\ntin tops and bottoms, the metal parts supplying a measure of rigidity to\r\nthe package. These composite packages are made round, square, oblong, or\r\ncylindrical.\r\n\r\nParaffined containers are characterized by an outer covering of glossy\r\nparaffin, and are made in various shapes. In some makes, the paraffin is\r\nforced into the pores of the paper base, making for added\r\nflavor-retaining and moisture-proof properties. In this type of package\r\nthe label may also be printed direct on the package.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, vacuum packed coffee has won great favor, first in the\r\nWest and latterly in the East. Tin cans are used. Vacuum sealing\r\nmachines close the containers at the rate of forty to fifty a minute.\r\nPrivate tests by responsible coffee men are said to have shown that\r\ncoffee in the bean or ground, when vacuum packed, retains its freshness\r\nfor a longer period than when packed by any other method.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Labels_\r\n\r\nCoffee packers must give due attention to certain well defined laws\r\nbearing on package labels. Before the Federal Pure Food Act went into\r\neffect on January 1, 1907, many coffee labels bore the magic names of\r\n\"Mocha\" and \"Java,\" when in fact neither of those two celebrated coffees\r\nwere used in the blend. Even mixtures containing a large percentage of\r\nchicory, or other addition, were labeled \"Pure Mocha and Java Coffee.\"\r\nThe enactment of the pure food law ended this practise, making it\r\ncompulsory that the label should state either the actual coffees used in\r\nthe blend, or a brand name, together with the name of either the packer\r\nor the distributer. When chicory or other addition is used, the fact\r\nmust be stated in clear type directly following the brand name. The\r\nreading matter on the label should contain facts only, and should not\r\nbear extravagant claims of superior quality or of methods of preparing\r\nor packing that have not been followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Packaging Economies_\r\n\r\nDuring the United States' participation in the World War, tin became\r\npractically unobtainable, and coffee packers turned to paper and fiber\r\ncontainers as substitutes in packaging nearly all grades. In this war\r\nperiod, commercial economy became a fetish in the business world; and\r\ncoffee packers worked to save not only material, but shipping space,\r\nlabor, and time. Paper and fiber containers proved to be not only\r\npractical but economical packages. Because of their war-time experience,\r\nmany packers changed permanently to square and oblong containers. They\r\nfound these containers could be packed \"solid\" in shipping cases,\r\nleaving no unfilled space between packages as is the case with\r\ncylindrical cans; also, smaller shipping cases could be used. As a\r\nfurther measure of economy, several packers changed from the square\r\n\"knocked-down\" paper or fiber carton to the oblong carton that is made\r\nup, filled, and sealed by automatic machinery from a flat, printed sheet\r\nof cardboard. This type of container is generally lined or wrapped with\r\na moisture-proof and flavor-retaining paper.\r\n\r\nThere has been a tendency in recent years to standardize coffee packages\r\nas a means of working out packaging and shipping economies. One of the\r\nleading American proponents[336] of standardization said:\r\n\r\n     One of the first arguments raised against standardization is that\r\n     it eliminates individuality, and individuality is one of the big\r\n     guns covering the front line trenches in the war of competition.\r\n     The folly of recommending that every one-pound coffee carton, for\r\n     instance, should be of exactly the same size and shape is\r\n     immediately apparent; but let us not confuse such unification with\r\n     standardization.\r\n\r\n     Assuming that a pound of coffee may be safely contained in\r\n     seventy-two cubic inches, we find that a carton three inches thick\r\n     by four inches wide by six inches high will serve our purpose; and,\r\n     as an illustration of extremes, a carton three inches thick by\r\n     three inches wide by eight inches high, or one [carton] two inches\r\n     thick by six inches wide by six inches high, will each have exactly\r\n     the same cubical contents. In fact, there is an almost infinite\r\n     variety of combinations of dimensions which will contain\r\n     substantially seventy-two cubic inches.\r\n\r\nAs an example of how coffee packages can be standardized this authority\r\ncites the following sizes of flat-sheet containers and their respective\r\ndimensions and capacities:\r\n\r\n        THICK AND WIDE  HIGH     CONTENTS\r\nSize         Inches         Inches   Cubic Ins.\r\n  1 lb.  2-5/8  by 4-1/2     6-1/4     73.83\r\n1/2 lb.  2-1/4  by 3-1/8     5-1/4     36.91\r\n1/4 lb.  1-9/16 by 2-5/8     4-1/2     18.46\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VARIOUS TYPES OF COFFEE CONTAINERS\r\n\r\nTHIS GROUP OF LEADING TRADE-MARKED COFFEES ILLUSTRATES THE WIDE VARIANCE\r\nIN STYLES OF CONTAINERS USED BY COFFEE-ROASTERS. THE PACKAGES SHOWN ARE\r\nAS FOLLOWS:\r\n\r\n1--Double carton. 2, 3--Cartons. 4--Fiber sides, tin top and bottom,\r\nfriction cover. 5--Vacuum tin can. 6--Fancy paper bag.\r\n7--Machine-wrapped paper package. 8--Fancy paper bag. 9--Carton with\r\npatented opening and closing device. 10--Wrapped paper package. 11--Tin\r\ncan with slip cover. 12--All-fiber can with slip cover. 13--Tin can with\r\nslip cover. 14--Lithographed tin can with friction cover. 15, 16--Tin\r\ncans with slip covers. 17--Squat tin can. 18--Napa-can. 19, 20,\r\n21--Vacuum tin cans.]\r\n\r\nThe advantages claimed for these packages are that each is well\r\nproportioned and makes a good selling appearance; each bears a direct\r\nrelation to the other two; and all may be handled with uniformly good\r\nresults on the same set of standardized packaging machinery. One size of\r\nshipping case, instead of three, may be used to hold exactly the same\r\nnumber of pounds of coffee, regardless of whether shipped in one-pound,\r\nhalf-pound, or quarter-pound cartons. For smaller dealer assortments,\r\nany two, or all three sizes also exactly fit the following standard\r\nshipping cases:\r\n\r\nFor 36 lbs., 13-7/8\" by 16-1/2\" by 12-3/4\" high\r\nFor 54 lbs., 13-7/8\" by 16-1/2\" by 19-1/8\" high\r\n\r\nThis standardization of packages and shipping containers results in a\r\nlower cost of containers and a smaller stock to carry, with attendant\r\nreductions in details in purchasing and billing departments, in\r\ninventories, and in many other overhead expense factors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Practical Grocer Helps_\r\n\r\nWholesale coffee merchandising does not properly end with the delivery\r\nof a shipment of coffee to a retailer. The progressive wholesaler knows\r\nthat it is to his best interest to help that grocer sell his coffee as\r\nquickly as possible; to make a good profit on a quick turn-over; and to\r\ndispose of it before the coffee has deteriorated.\r\n\r\nPractical co-operation between wholesaler and retailer is one of the\r\nmost important factors in coffee merchandising. In these days of keen\r\nand unremitting competition, neither agency can stand alone for long.\r\nThe progressive wholesaler does not sell a retailer a poorer quality of\r\ncoffee for any particular grade than his trade calls for, and he does\r\nnot load him up with more than can be disposed of while still fresh. He\r\ngauges the capacity and facilities of each retail customer, and then\r\ngives him practical help to keep the stock moving.\r\n\r\nThe packer of branded coffees helps by advertising to the consumer in\r\nmagazines and newspapers, always featuring the name of his brands; and\r\nhe supplies the grocer with educational pamphlets and booklets on the\r\ngrowing, preparation, and merits of coffee in general, with an added\r\nfillip about the desirability of his particular brand. Through his\r\nsalesmen the packer shows the grocer how to display the coffee on the\r\ncounter and in the window, and often supplies him with placards and\r\ncut-outs featuring his brand. He co-operates in staging special coffee\r\ndemonstrations in the store; instructs the retailer in the importance of\r\nteaching his clerks how to talk and to sell coffee intelligently; and\r\nhow to prepare advertising copy for his local newspaper, so as to get\r\nthe fullest measure of profit from the wholesaler's national or\r\nsectional advertising.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Sampling_\r\n\r\nThe sampling method of creating a demand for merchandise has been tried\r\nin the wholesale coffee trade, only to be abandoned by the majority of\r\npackers. With other and more satisfactory ways of creating consumer\r\ninterest, promiscuous sampling was found to be too expensive, in view of\r\nthe comparatively small returns. One indictment against sampling is that\r\nit does not make any more impression on the average person than does an\r\nadvertisement that appears only once, and is then abandoned. Wideawake\r\nmerchants have learned that the public's memory is exceedingly short;\r\nand that they must keep \"hammering\" with advertisements to establish and\r\nto maintain a demand for their products.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the logical place for sampling is in the retailer's\r\nstore, especially in connection with demonstrations. Many progressive\r\ngrocers stimulate interest in their coffees by serving, on special\r\ndemonstration days, small cups of freshly brewed coffee, giving the\r\ncustomer a small sample of the brand or blend used, to be taken home to\r\nsee if the same pleasing results can be obtained there also. Generally\r\nthis form of sampling, when properly conducted, has shown a larger\r\npercentage of returns than any other method.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Premium Method of Sales Promotion_\r\n\r\nFor many years, the premium method of sales promotion has been an\r\nimportant factor in wholesale coffee merchandising, as well as in retail\r\ndistribution. The premium system has been characterized as a form of\r\nadvertising; and many coffee packers and wholesalers prefer to spend\r\ntheir advertising appropriations in that way rather than in transitory\r\nprinted advertisements in newspapers and general magazines.\r\n\r\nWhile certain forms of the system have been legislated out of existence\r\nin some states, friends of the plan claim that it is a true\r\nprofit-sharing method which \"blesses both him that gives and him that\r\ntakes\"; and that it is an advanced and legitimate means of promoting\r\nbusiness, when properly conducted. They assert that it is a system of\r\nsales promotion whereby the advertising expense, plus a large\r\npercentage of the profits of the business stimulated thereby, is\r\nautomatically returned to the dealer buyer, without increasing cost or\r\nlowering the quality of the product so advertised; that it eliminates\r\nadvertising waste by producing a given volume of sales for a given\r\nexpenditure of money; that it reduces the cost of advertising by\r\nprompting a continuous series of purchases at one advertising expense;\r\nthat it promotes cash payments and discourages credit business. Premium\r\nusers claim that the force of a printed advertisement is often spent in\r\nstimulating the first purchase; while to secure a premium, the purchaser\r\nmust continue to buy the commodity carrying the premium, or trade with\r\nthe giver of the premium until merchandise of a stipulated value or\r\nquantity has been purchased.\r\n\r\nIn general practise, the premium-giving coffee packer or wholesaler may\r\neither offer the retailer an inducement in the form of a desirable store\r\nfixture, household article, or item for his personal use; or he may\r\noffer it to the consumer through the retailer.\r\n\r\nThe methods of giving the premium are numerous. To the retailer he may\r\ngive the article outright with each purchase of a stipulated quantity of\r\nhis coffee; or he may offer it as a prize to the retail distributer\r\nselling the most coffee in a certain period in a specified territory.\r\nFrequently the premium is of such value that the wholesaler can not give\r\nit with any quantity of coffee a distributer can dispose of in a short\r\ntime; so he issues coupons or certificates with each purchase,\r\npermitting the retailer to redeem the premium when he has saved the\r\nrequired number. Or, the retailer may get the premium with the first\r\npurchase by paying the difference in cash.\r\n\r\nIn giving premiums to consumers, the wholesaler follows the same general\r\nplan used with retailers, except that in most cases the coupons are\r\npacked with the coffee and are redeemable at the retailer's store.\r\nSometimes, however, the consumer sends the coupons or certificates to\r\nthe wholesaler, getting the premium direct from him. In another phase of\r\nthe premium system, the retailer works independently of the wholesaler,\r\nbuying and giving away his own premiums to promote or to hold trade for\r\nhis store. This phase is explained in the chapter on retail coffee\r\nmerchandising.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUHRS, OF POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y., FEATURES FRESHLY ROASTED\r\nCOFFEE IN HIS WINDOW\r\n\r\nSmoke from the roasters is blown into street through the coffee pot\r\nhanging over the door]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHNSON, OF RED OAK, IOWA, ROASTS BEFORE THE CUSTOMER\r\n\r\nShowing a Royal roasting and grinding equipment]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRESH ROASTED-COFFEE IDEA IN RETAIL MERCHANDISING]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nRETAIL MERCHANDISING OF ROASTED COFFEE\r\n\r\n     _How coffees are sold at retail--The place of the grocer, the tea\r\n     and coffee dealer, the chain store, and the wagon-route distributer\r\n     in the scheme of distribution--Starting in the retail coffee\r\n     business--Small roasters for retail dealers--Model coffee\r\n     departments--Creating a coffee trade--Meeting\r\n     competition--Splitting nickels--Figuring costs and profits--A\r\n     credit policy for retailers--Premiums_\r\n\r\n\r\nCoffee is sold at retail in the United States through seven distinct\r\nchannels of trade; the independent retail grocers (about 350,000)\r\nhandling about forty percent of the 1,300,000,000 pounds sold annually;\r\nand the other sixty percent being sold by chain stores, mail-order\r\nhouses, house-to-house wagon-route distributers, specialty tea and\r\ncoffee stores, department stores, and drug stores. Since the beginning\r\nof the twentieth century, the independent grocers' monopoly in retail\r\ncoffee-merchandising has been dwindling at a rate that has seriously\r\nalarmed those interests and their friends.\r\n\r\nB.C. Casanas of New Orleans, addressing a convention of the National\r\nAssociation of Retail Grocers in the United States, in 1916, said that\r\nthe wholesale coffee roasters of the country had invested in their\r\nbusiness $60,000,000; and that $135,000,000 worth of roasted coffee was\r\nsold by them every year.\r\n\r\nConsidering the methods of merchandising, the seven retail distributing\r\nagencies may be grouped into three distinct classes. The first class\r\nwould comprise the independent grocer, the chain store, the department\r\nstore, the drug store, and the specialty store, all of which maintain\r\nstores where the consumer comes to buy. The second class takes in the\r\nmail-order house, which solicits orders and delivers its coffee by mail,\r\nand sometimes by freight or express. The third class covers the\r\nwagon-route dealer, who goes from house to house seeking trade, and\r\ndelivers his coffee on order at regular periods direct to the consumer\r\nin the home. As an inducement to contracting for large quantities to be\r\ndelivered in weekly or bi-weekly periods, the house-to-house dealer\r\ngenerally gives some household article, or the like, as a premium to\r\nestablish good-will and to retain the trade of his customers.\r\n\r\nNew impetus was given to the method of selling coffee by mail when the\r\nparcel post system was adopted by the federal government in 1912; and\r\nsince then this plan has become an important factor in retail\r\ncoffee-merchandising. Generally, the mail-order houses confine their\r\nsales efforts to agricultural districts and small towns, soliciting\r\ntrade by catalogs, by circular letters, and by advertisements in local\r\nnewspapers, and in magazines which circulate chiefly among dwellers in\r\nrural districts.\r\n\r\nThe majority of wagon-route distributers depend upon the lure of their\r\npremiums, and on personal calls, to develop and to hold their coffee\r\ntrade. The leading wagon-route companies, sometimes called \"premium\r\nhouses\", maintain offices and plants in large cities adjacent to the\r\nterritories to which they confine their sales efforts. At strategic\r\npoints, they have district agents who engage the wagon men that do the\r\nactual soliciting of orders and that deliver the coffee. All wagon-route\r\ncompanies handle other products besides coffee, specializing in tea,\r\nspices, extracts, and such household goods as soap, perfumes, and other\r\ntoilet requisites that promise a quick sale and frequent re-orders. Some\r\nof their competitors complain that they handle only the more profitable\r\nlines, leaving the independent local grocer to supply the housekeeper\r\nwith the items on which the margin of profit is comparatively small.\r\n\r\nWagon-route coffee-retailing began to make itself felt seriously about\r\nthe year 1900. At first, the premiums usually consisted of a cup and\r\nsaucer with the first order, the customer being led to continue buying\r\nuntil at least a full set of dishes had been acquired. Later, the range\r\nof premiums was expanded; until today the wagon man offers several\r\nhundred different articles that can be used in the home or for personal\r\nwear or adornment. Practically all the leading wagon-route concerns\r\nfavor the advance premium method; that is, a special canvasser induces a\r\nconsumer to contract for a large quantity of coffee and other products\r\nin return for receiving the premium at once, though the coffee is\r\ndelivered only as the customer wants it, generally two pounds every two\r\nweeks. The wagon man delivers the coffee, and is usually held\r\nresponsible for the customer fulfilling the agreement, and is expected\r\nto secure repeat orders with other premiums.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PREMIUM TEA AND COFFEE DEALER'S DISPLAY ROOM\r\n\r\nThis is the headquarters store of the Geo. F. Hellick Co., Easton, Pa.,\r\na successful wagon coffee distributer. The premium merchandise is shown\r\nin the foreground: the sales counter, coffee mill, and display of teas,\r\ncoffees, extracts, spices, etc., being in the right background]\r\n\r\nThe importance of the wagon-route plan of coffee-retailing is shown by\r\nthe fact that in 1921 there were six hundred houses of this kind in the\r\nUnited States; and it was estimated that they distributed eight percent\r\nof the total amount of the coffee consumed in the country. The biggest\r\ncompany was capitalized at $16,000,000, and operated eleven hundred\r\nwagons. Most of the wagon-route concerns were operating in the central\r\nstates, practically one-third of them covering the states of Illinois,\r\nWisconsin, Indiana, and Iowa. Pennsylvania is also a wagon-route-dealer\r\ncenter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TYPICAL CHAIN-STORE INTERIOR EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nThis is the Atlantic & Pacific Co.'s store in Rhinebeck, New York. There\r\nare nearly 5,000 other stores like it in the United States]\r\n\r\nThe premium wagon-route distributers have an organization called the\r\nNational Retail Tea and Coffee Merchants' Association. It is composed of\r\n126 members--all of whom use premiums--who operate over two thousand\r\nwagons. The largest single wagon-route operator is the Jewel Tea Company\r\nof Chicago. The members of this organization claimed to have served more\r\nthan 2,000,000 families in 1920.\r\n\r\nIn the chain-store system of merchandising we see the opposite extreme\r\nof coffee retailing. The wagon-route man features his delivery service;\r\nwhile in the chain-store plan, all customers must pay cash and carry\r\nhome their parcels. Though the earliest established chain stores gave\r\npremiums, the practise has now been generally abandoned. Roasting,\r\nblending, and packing coffee in a large central plant, the chain-store\r\noperator advertises that he can sell coffee at a price lower than his\r\ncompetitors. As a rule, only one grade of coffee is offered for sale.\r\nWhile it is generally a good medium value, many consumers prefer better\r\nquality and go to the independent grocer for it. Others patronize the\r\ngrocer because of his convenient delivery service, and because he gives\r\ncredit on purchases. Chain-store organizations seem to be growing\r\nrapidly, however; the largest of the chains, the Great Atlantic &\r\nPacific Tea Co., reporting in 1921 that it had nearly five thousand\r\nbranches throughout the country, which sell 40,000,000 pounds of coffee\r\nannually. This chain has a capitalization of $12,000,000, and in 1920\r\nsold $225,000,000 worth of groceries, as compared with $154,718,124 in\r\nthe preceding year. This company opens about five hundred new stores\r\nevery year.\r\n\r\nThe chain-store men are organized in the National Chain Store Grocers\r\nAssociation, having thirty members, representing 12,000 stores,\r\noperating in eighteen states. It is estimated that there are fifty\r\nresponsible chain-store grocery organizations in the United States,\r\nrepresenting about 30,000 stores. The chain-store grocer turns his stock\r\nover from twelve to twenty-five times a year, sells for cash, makes no\r\ndeliveries, and claims to save the consumer an average of fifteen\r\npercent in buying. These stores do business on a net margin not\r\nexceeding three percent on sales, as against the average retail grocer's\r\nthirty percent, while their average gross cost of doing business has\r\nbeen stated as between thirteen and one-half percent (lowest) and\r\neighteen and one-half percent (highest).\r\n\r\nAccording to Alfred H. Beckmann, secretary-treasurer of the National\r\nChain Store Grocers' Association,[337] \"Public appreciation of the chain\r\ngrocery store is rapidly growing. Ten years ago it was estimated that\r\nchain stores in what is known as the Metropolitan district of New York\r\ndid about 12-1/2 percent of the volume of business in their line, while\r\ntoday it is estimated at about fifty percent\".\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the fifty-odd chain store organizations in the\r\nUnited States distribute through their 30,000 stores 270,000,000 pounds\r\nof coffee a year, or about twenty percent of the total amount consumed\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Starting in the Retail Coffee Business_\r\n\r\nWhen taking up the retail merchandising of coffee, the practical grocer\r\nlearns all he can about the popular grades to be had in the principal\r\nmarkets, and how the coffees are grown, roasted, blended, and ground. He\r\nalso ascertains the best methods of brewing, testing out each grade and\r\nkind on his own table, if he does not have testing facilities in his\r\nstore. He studies the relative trade values of different varieties of\r\ncoffee, and the requirements of his particular clientèle.\r\n\r\nAn interesting analysis of some 250 grocery stores in the United\r\nStates[338] made in 1919, showed that twenty-nine percent of the dealers\r\nbought all their coffee from wholesale grocers, forty-eight percent\r\nexclusively from roasters and specialty wholesalers, ten percent got\r\nover one-half of their coffee from wholesale grocers, and thirteen\r\npercent bought less than one-half from the wholesale grocery houses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FAMILIAR A & P STORE FRONT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAYOUT FOR COFFEE AND TEA DEPARTMENT]\r\n\r\nThere are two fundamental plans on which a retailer builds a successful\r\ncoffee business--by buying coffee already roasted, and by buying it\r\ngreen and roasting it in the store. Each plan has its advantages; but\r\nits practicability depends upon conditions in different localities.\r\n\r\nBeyond acquiring a general talking knowledge about coffees, the retailer\r\nbuying his stocks roasted in bulk or package form does not generally\r\nneed the intimate knowledge of his goods required by the grocer who\r\nroasts his own coffee. If he grinds the coffee for his customers he must\r\nknow the type of grind best suited to the way the coffee is to be\r\nbrewed, and must be able to tell the best brewing method.\r\n\r\nThe practical grocer who makes up his own blend is acquainted with\r\nblending principles and methods. \"While he can not expect to be as\r\nexpert as the large wholesale blender, he should know that green coffees\r\nare generally classified by blenders in five great divisions; (1)\r\nBrazils, including Santos, Bourbon and flat bean, Rios, Victorias, and\r\nBahias; (2) Washed milds, embracing, as of the most commercial value,\r\nBogotas, Bucaramangas, Guatemalas, Mexicans, Costa Ricans, Maracaibos,\r\nand Meridas; (3) Unwashed milds, such as Maracaibos, Bucaramangas, La\r\nGuairas, and Mexicans; (4) Javas, Sumatras, and Padangs; (5) Mocha, and\r\nHarari.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE RETAIL COFFEE-ROASTING STATIONS IN SOUTHERN\r\nCALIFORNIA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLOSE-UP OF THE MINIATURE MANUFACTURING PLANT, SHOWING\r\nTHE ROASTING AND GRINDING EQUIPMENT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: APPLYING THE SPECIALIST IDEA TO COFFEE MERCHANDISING\r\n\r\nThe Pacific Stores Co., Los Angeles, cutting out deliveries, premiums,\r\nand solicitors, has built up a business of more than 100 bags of coffee\r\ndaily, selling direct to the consumer in a chain of 100 booths patterned\r\nafter the country-roadside gasoline stations; each one having its own\r\nroaster]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SELF-CONTAINED MONITOR GAS ROASTER, COOLER, AND STONER]\r\n\r\nIt has been found by experience that a good assortment for the average\r\nretailer to carry consists of Santos, because of price; a natural\r\nunwashed Maracaibo or Bucaramanga, because of full body and general\r\nblending values; and a washed coffee, preferably a Bogota, which gives\r\nquality and character to a blend. In stocking up with these coffees, the\r\npractical merchant avoids Santos with a strong or Rioy flavor, bitter or\r\n\"hidey\" Maracaibos, and acidy or thin Bogotas.[339]\r\n\r\nA grocer equipped with these coffees has the Santos for his low-priced\r\nseller. For his medium grade he blends Santos and Maracaibo,\r\nhalf-and-half. The next higher grade is made up of one-third each of the\r\nthree coffees; while the best blend consists either of half-and-half\r\nBogota and Maracaibo, or three-quarters Bogota and one-quarter\r\nMaracaibo.\r\n\r\nThe chief advantage of these three coffees is that they blend well in\r\nany way they are mixed; and the dealer with a little experience, and\r\nworking with the two necessary ideas in mind--satisfactory coffee and\r\nprice--can make up various combinations.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that the United States imports coffee from more than\r\na hundred different sections of the world, and that there are wide\r\nvariations in flavor among the coffees produced in each of the hundred,\r\nit is easy to understand that the blender has an almost unlimited supply\r\nfrom which to make up a blend with a distinctive individuality.\r\nPractically all coffee importers, and most wholesalers, are thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the relative trade values of the different coffees, and\r\nhelp their customers make up desirable blends.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Small Roasters for Retail Dealers_\r\n\r\nWhile the wholesale coffee roaster is obliged to instal a large and\r\nsomewhat complex equipment, the retailer must use a small, compact,\r\nself-contained unit that does not take up much space in his store, and\r\nthat is easily operated. Retail roasting machines are constructed on the\r\nsame general principle as the wholesale roaster. The roasting cylinder\r\nis generally revolved by electric power, and the heat is derived from\r\ngas or gasoline fuel. Cooling is by air suction in a box attached to the\r\nroaster. The capacities of the machines range from ten to three hundred\r\npounds, the operating cost running from approximately eight cents per\r\nhundred pounds for gas fuel and ten cents for electric power. The\r\nroasters cost from three hundred dollars for the smaller sizes, to\r\nfifteen hundred for the one-bag type; and to two thousand or three\r\nthousand dollars for the two-bag type.\r\n\r\nOne coffee-roaster-machinery manufacturer has recently brought out a\r\ngas-fired, electrically operated fifty-pound miniature coffee-roasting\r\nplant designed for retail stores, which comprises a roaster, a rotary\r\ncooler, and a stoning device, that sells for six hundred and fifty\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROYAL GAS COFFEE ROASTER FOR RETAIL STORES]\r\n\r\nRetail coffee roasting is similar to the wholesale operation. When the\r\ncylinder has become heated, the green coffee is run in and allowed to\r\nroast in the revolving cylinder for about half an hour. If the coffee is\r\nthe average green kind, the full heat may be applied at once; but if old\r\nand dry, a lesser degree is used. When the roast begins to snap, the\r\nflame is turned lower to allow the beans to cook through evenly; and\r\nwhen nearly done, it is almost extinguished. During the operation, the\r\nroasterman, who may be the proprietor or a clerk delegated to the work,\r\nfrequently \"samples\" the coffee by taking out a small quantity with his\r\n\"trier\" and comparing the color of the roast with a type sample. When\r\nthe colors match exactly, the coffee is dumped automatically into the\r\ncooler box just below the cylinder opening; and when sufficiently cooled\r\noff, is ready for grinding to order.\r\n\r\nA large number of retailers roast coffee in their stores; and the most\r\nsuccessful find that besides being able to make a feature of freshly\r\nroasted coffee, they can save money and increase their sales. One\r\nprogressive grocer found that he was able to get eighty-eight pounds of\r\nroasted coffee out of one hundred pounds of green coffee, as compared\r\nwith the wholesaler's eighty-four pounds; that he could buy green coffee\r\nat a closer price than roasted; and that it cost him less for labor,\r\nfuel, overhead, and similar items, than it did the wholesale roaster to\r\nturn out a roast.[340]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURNS HALF-BAG GAS ROASTING, COOLING, AND STONING OUTFIT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAMBERT JUNIOR GAS ROASTING, COOLING, AND STONING OUTFIT\r\nFOR RETAIL STORES (Capacity fifty pounds)]\r\n\r\nA chain of coffee specialty stores in which the coffee is roasted fresh\r\nevery day was started in California about the year 1916; and according\r\nto reports, it met with almost instant success. In this system, the\r\nproprietor buys the green coffee in large quantities, and it is roasted\r\nin each of his specialty stores, which are located in public markets,\r\nstore windows, and alongside heavily traveled highways. The roasting\r\nmachinery is invariably set up in front of the store where passers-by\r\ncan easily see it in operation--and also smell the coffee roasting. Four\r\nyears after starting the first store, there were fifty in operation\r\nalong the Pacific Coast, doing an annual business of about $600,000,\r\nsome units taking in more than $7,000 a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Model Coffee Departments_\r\n\r\nAuthorities generally agree that a well laid out coffee department not\r\nonly increases a grocer's coffee business, but speeds up sales in other\r\ndepartments as well. Coffee lovers, and they are legion in the United\r\nStates, are inclined to \"shop around\" for a coffee that suits their\r\ntaste; and when they have found the store that sells it, they buy their\r\nother groceries there also. Another argument advanced in favor of a\r\ncoffee department is that coffee pays more money into the retailer's\r\ncash drawer than any other grocery item.[341]\r\n\r\nMost successful retail coffee merchandisers establish the coffee\r\ndepartment near the entrance to the store, where it can be seen through\r\na window by passers-by, especially if there is an ornamental roasting\r\nand grinding equipment. It has been found that a department situated at\r\nthe left of the entrance is almost certain to draw attention because\r\npeople are inclined to glance in that direction first. Some merchants,\r\nhaving the space, erect attractive booths, designed somewhat like the\r\nfamiliar food-show booths, directly in front of the door, after the\r\nfashion of department stores when holding a special sale on a certain\r\narticle. Such a booth is generally used for demonstration purposes, and\r\nis decorated with signs and possibly with bunting. A permanent\r\ndepartment is usually less ornamental, but still attractive. In telling\r\nhow he made a success of his department, one American grocer said that\r\nhe was careful that his fixtures were not so ornamental as to draw\r\nattention from the goods. While the decorations were always attractive,\r\nthey were subordinated sufficiently to form a background for his coffee\r\ndisplay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAULDER AND SIMPLEX GAS ROASTERS IN AN ENGLISH FACTORY\r\n\r\nThe Faulder (on the left) is a 28-lb. indirect machine and the Simplex\r\n(also 28 lbs. capacity) is of the direct-flame, quick-roaster type]\r\n\r\nThe most popular layout is the conventional counter system behind which\r\nthe clerk stands to serve the customer on the other side. There are many\r\nadvocates of the counter that is built into the shelving, believing that\r\nthe closer the customers are brought to the coffee, the more they will\r\nbe inclined to buy. This system also makes for cleanliness, doing away\r\nwith the possibility of the runway behind the counter becoming a\r\ncatch-all for dirt, torn paper, bits of wood, and the like.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ILLUSTRATING THE COFFEE ROASTERS USED BY THE SHOP-KEEPERS\r\nOF FRANCE\r\n\r\nThese machines are of the ball-cylinder type, and use gas as fuel; the\r\ncylinder is revolved by electric power. Invariably they stand where they\r\ncan be seen from the street]\r\n\r\nThe modern coffee department has counters divided into compartments\r\nhaving glass fronts. This type serves both as a storage place for coffee\r\nand for display purposes. The top of the counter is used for wrapping up\r\nparcels, etc., and also for displaying bulk and package coffees. In the\r\nwell regulated store, the counter top is never used for storage, all\r\nstock being kept on shelves or in the counter's compartments. Good\r\nmerchants find that cleanliness pays; and that a \"littered up\" store\r\ndrives away desirable custom. The wise proprietor never allows a clerk\r\nto weigh out coffee after handling cheese, onions, and other odorous\r\narticles, without first thoroughly washing his hands. He knows that few\r\nfood products in his store will more quickly absorb undesirable odors\r\nand flavors than coffee; and consequently he is careful to protect his\r\ncoffee from contamination. In the better stores, the proprietor will\r\neither take charge of the coffee department himself, or will delegate a\r\ncompetent man who will do nothing else.\r\n\r\nThe wide-awake retail coffee roaster always features his roasting\r\nmachine, which is generally highly ornamental and draws attention even\r\nwhen not in use. Some progressive merchants plan to roast coffee at noon\r\ntime and at night, when homeward-bound passers-by are hungry and are\r\nparticularly susceptible to the pungent aroma of roasting coffee. It is\r\na quite common plan for the retail roaster to arrange the exhaust of the\r\nmachine so that the full strength of the odor is blown into the street.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Creating a Coffee Trade_\r\n\r\nBecause of steady sales and quick profits, there is keener competition\r\nin retail coffee-merchandising than in other food products. But, all\r\nthings being equal, any intelligent person can create and hold a\r\nprofitable trade if he follows approved business methods--and works. The\r\nbest practise among coffee merchants shows that the prime essential is\r\ngood coffee, freshly roasted and ground. After that comes intelligent\r\nand unremitting sales-promotion work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SMALL GERMAN ROASTERS\r\n\r\nOn the left is a hand roaster for wood or coal fuel; on the right is a\r\ngas machine.]\r\n\r\nThe many ingenious trade-building plans worked out successfully by\r\ngrocers in all parts of the country are too numerous to describe in a\r\nbook of this character; but the methods cited in the following, all of\r\nwhich have been tested in actual working conditions, will serve to\r\nindicate the fundamentals of good retail coffee-sales promotion.\r\n\r\nAmong the chief sales-winning methods are demonstrations in the store,\r\nat local food shows, and at church socials, picnics or functions,\r\njudicious sampling either in person or by mail, personal canvassing from\r\nhouse to house, circularizing by mail, linking up window displays with\r\ncurrent happenings, local newspaper and outdoor poster advertising, and\r\nselling coffee by telephone. Most of the foregoing plans are worked\r\nintermittently. The telephone, however, is a most important sales factor\r\nand should be employed constantly and consistently.[342] Many successful\r\nstores consider the telephone, properly used, the greatest single\r\nsales-help in retail coffee-merchandising.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POPULAR FRENCH RETAIL ROASTER\r\n\r\nEmploying coal, charcoal, or wood fuel]\r\n\r\nOne grocer had such faith in this method that he paid half the annual\r\ntelephone rental for a large number of his best-paying customers.\r\nAnother large merchandiser put in an individual telephone for each of\r\nhis salesmen, who called up his regular customers each day to suggest\r\narticles for that day's order, always of course mentioning their\r\n\"superior brand of coffee.\" Telephoning is the next step to personal\r\ncontact; and if tactfully done, is considered to be even more\r\nadvantageous, because of the time it saves both the customer and the\r\nstore keeper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNO CABINET GAS ROASTER WITH COOLING UNIT\r\n\r\nA popular English type]\r\n\r\nCoffee demonstrations in stores are easily arranged, in most cases. The\r\nmain consideration is fresh coffee of good quality served daintily and\r\nhot. Lacking a coffee urn, some grocers make their brews in large-size\r\nhome-service coffee-making devices. Those most advanced in the correct\r\nmethod of brewing use the drip process. It is generally agreed that\r\ndemonstrations should not be held too often. They not only cut into\r\nprofits, but lose much of their advertising value. Food-show\r\ndemonstrations require more elaborate equipment, consisting of a\r\ndecorated booth, educational booklets, posters, and exhibits of\r\ndifferent kinds of coffee, both green and roasted, whole bean and\r\nground. Generally, coffee packers co-operate with retail demonstrators\r\nby supplying gratis the coffee to be brewed, if the names of their\r\nbrands are suitably displayed. They supply also posters, signs, samples,\r\nand booklets for free distribution.\r\n\r\nWindow displays form one of the best means of advertising at the command\r\nof the average grocer, and one of the least expensive. A popular coffee\r\ndisplay consists of a series of educational \"windows,\" starting with\r\ngreen beans in the bags in which they are shipped from the growing\r\ncountry. Generally the bags, mats, or bundles are obtained from the\r\nwholesale house, and are filled almost to the top with some inexpensive\r\nstuffing, the green coffee being spread over the top to give the\r\nappearance of a full bag. Pictures showing how the coffee is grown,\r\nharvested, prepared, and shipped, are frequently used in such a display.\r\nThe next exhibit consists of whole roasted coffee spread thickly over\r\nthe window floor to create the impression of bulk, accompanied by a few\r\npans of green coffee by way of contrast, and with pictures showing\r\nscenes in coffee roasting plants. A barrel, lined with blue paper, and\r\nlying on its side with roasted coffee beans spilling out, serves as a\r\ncenterpiece for such a display. Following this, comes a coffee package\r\nwindow, accompanied by pictures showing how coffee is roasted, ground,\r\nand packed. This completes the series; but there are many variations\r\nthat have proved successful as trade builders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDUCATIONAL WINDOW EXHIBIT\r\n\r\nThis window won first prize for the western district in the $2,000\r\nwindow-trimming contest of National Coffee Week in 1920. Action was\r\nfurnished by a small electric pump, which kept a steady stream of coffee\r\nflowing from a coffee pot into the coffee cup]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Meeting Competition_\r\n\r\nSince the advent of the wagon-route distributer and the chain store, the\r\nindependent retail grocer has been faced with the problem of how to\r\nregain at least a fair measure of the coffee trade he has lost. The\r\ngrocer is not only concerned about his profits on coffee sales, but on\r\nother goods as well; for a trade investigation has shown that a large\r\npercentage of the regular customers of the retailer are held to the\r\nstore by their purchases of coffee and tea. This means that if coffees\r\nand teas are bought from the wagon-route distributer and the chain\r\nstore, the balance of a family's order is \"shopped around.\"\r\n\r\nTo meet this competition, the best authorities agree that the\r\nindependent grocer should feature coffee in every practical way, such as\r\nsoliciting coffee trade from each customer that enters the store; give\r\nup offering coffee on a price basis, and make up his own blends from\r\ngood quality growths; perhaps make up his own brand and push it at every\r\nopportunity; display coffee artistically, with frequent changes of\r\nlayouts; and have occasional store demonstrations. He should see that\r\nthe coffee is roasted properly, and that it is always fresh; that the\r\nselling effort is not expended on the lowest-priced blend, but on a\r\ngrade that can be recommended for cup merit. This should be a leader,\r\nbut a lower-price coffee could be carried to suit the trade that buys on\r\nprice. Persistent efforts should be made to educate the last-named class\r\nof customers to use the better grades, which in the end are cheaper and\r\ngive better satisfaction. In short, the grocer should work consistently\r\nto establish a vogue for his leader blend on the basis of merit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BETTER-CLASS AMERICAN GROCERY INTERIOR\r\n\r\nShowing the coffee bins in orderly array, and the electric coffee\r\ngrinder]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Profits and Costs_\r\n\r\nBecause of its influence on other grocery items, coffee can often be\r\nsold at a close margin of profit, particularly if a competitor's store\r\nor wagons are cutting into a grocer's neighborhood trade. Twenty-five\r\npercent is recommended as a reasonable gross profit on coffee in most\r\ncases, although some grocers make less, and not a few make more; the\r\nrange being usually from twenty to thirty-nine percent. The independent\r\ndealer should meet chain-store competition in coffee on a price basis,\r\nmaking a special on a superior grade and figuring to get not more than\r\nthree cents profit per pound, like his competitor. A bag of roasted\r\ncoffee will bring back three dollars gain, and the cash to pay for\r\nanother--and the grocer has kept his customers, ninety percent of whom,\r\ntheoretically, will have bought their other food supplies from him. As a\r\nmatter of fact, in the last year of the World War retailers showed a\r\ntendency to demand cash on sales of all grocery items. This practise\r\nreduces the cost of operation and allows the storekeeper to reduce his\r\nprices. A large number of grocers charge a small percentage of the total\r\nsale for credit privileges, and five or ten cents for each delivery\r\nbelow a certain total value of the purchase price of the articles to be\r\ndelivered. As a result, they have been able to meet chain-store\r\ncompetition. Collective buying has also been a factor in offsetting the\r\ninroads of the \"chains.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PRIZE-WINNING WINDOW DISPLAY\r\n\r\nThis unusual display of coffee-flavored eatables won first prize for the\r\nsouthern district in the National Coffee Week window-trimming contest.\r\nThe cakes, pies, tarts, and other pastries which constituted the main\r\nfeature rested in a bed of green coffee. The customer's interest was\r\ncleverly attracted to the dealer's brand by a pyramid of large coffee\r\ncans in the center background and by two miniature dining-room sets.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Splitting Nickels_\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons advanced for the loss of coffee trade by retail\r\ngrocers is that they price their blends in \"round numbers\", that is 20,\r\n25, 30, or 40 cents; while their competitors \"split nickels\", selling\r\ntheir product at 18, 23, 28, or 38 cents.\r\n\r\nMost of the retail enterprises in other lines of trade have built up\r\ntheir business on the penny-change plan; and many coffee men believe\r\nthis should become the universal merchandising method among retail\r\ndistributers of coffee.[343]\r\n\r\nOne of the leading advocates of \"splitting nickels\" has worked out a\r\nchart to show how coffee should be priced to make predetermined profits.\r\n(See next page.)\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING PROFIT PERCENTAGE ON SALES\r\n\r\nIf Your\r\nCoffee     And You Sell At\r\nCosts    25c. 26c. 27c. 28c. 29c. 30c. 31c. 32c. 33c.\r\n\r\n20c.     20%  23%  26%  28%  31%  33%  35%  37%  39%\r\n20-1/2c. 18%  21%  24%  26%  29%  31%  33%  35%  37%\r\n21c.     16%  19%  22%  25%  27%  30%  32%  34%  36%\r\n21-1/2c. 14%  17%  20%  23%  25%  28%  30%  32%  34%\r\n22c.     12%  15%  18%  21%  24%  26%  29%  31%  33%\r\n22-1/2c. 10%  13%  16%  19%  22%  25%  27%  29%  31%\r\n23c.      8%  11%  14%  17%  20%  23%  25%  28%  30%\r\n23-1/2c.  6%   9%  13%  16%  19%  21%  24%  26%  28%\r\n24c.      4%   7%  11%  14%  17%  20%  22%  25%  27%\r\n24-1/2c.  2%   5%   9%  12%  15%  18%  21%  23%  25%\r\n25c.      0%   3%   7%  10%  13%  16%  19%  21%  24%\r\n25-1/2c.       2%   5%   8%  12%  15%  17%  20%  22%\r\n26c.           0%   3%   7%  10%  13%  16%  18%  21%\r\n26-1/2c.            1%   5%   8%  11%  14%  17%  19%\r\n27c.                0%   3%   6%  10%  12%  15%  18%\r\n27-1/2c.                 1%   5%   8%  11%  14%  16%\r\n28c.                     0%   3%   6%   9%  12%  15%\r\n\r\n\r\n_Figuring Costs and Profits_\r\n\r\nWhile the cost of conducting a retail grocery business naturally varies\r\naccording to local conditions and the size of the enterprise, an\r\ninvestigation among some 250 stores in small and large cities made in\r\n1919 by the Bureau of Business Research, Harvard University, showed that\r\nthe average cost was fourteen percent; that the net profit averaged two\r\nand three-tenths percent; and that stock was turned about seven times a\r\nyear. Gross profits ran from ten and one-half percent to twenty-six and\r\nfour-one-hundredths percent of the net sales, the most typical figure\r\nbeing sixteen and nine-tenths percent. Sales cost formed the largest\r\nsingle item of expense, varying from three and forty-one hundredths to\r\nnine and ninety-four hundredths percent, with the bulk of figures\r\nshowing around one and eight-tenths percent.\r\n\r\nAccording to advanced business practise the cost of doing business\r\nshould be based on these fourteen points:\r\n\r\n     1. Charge interest on the net amount of the total investment at the\r\n     beginning of the business year, exclusive of real estate.\r\n\r\n     2. Charge rental on real estate or buildings at a rate equal to\r\n     that which would be received if renting or leasing to others.\r\n\r\n     3. Charge, in addition to what is paid for hired help, an amount\r\n     equal to what the proprietor's services would be worth to others;\r\n     also treat in like manner the services of any member of the family\r\n     employed in the business and not on the regular payroll.\r\n\r\n     4. Charge depreciation on all goods carried over on which a less\r\n     price may have to be made because of damage or any other cause.\r\n\r\n     5. Charge depreciation on buildings, tools, fixtures, or anything\r\n     else suffering from age or wear and tear.\r\n\r\n     6. Charge donations and subscriptions paid.\r\n\r\n     7. Charge all fixed expenses, such as taxes, insurance, water,\r\n     lights, fuel, etc.\r\n\r\n     8. Charge all incidental expenses, such as drayage, postage, office\r\n     supplies, livery expenses of horses and wagons, telegrams and\r\n     telephones, advertising, canvassing, etc.\r\n\r\n     9. Charge losses of every character, including goods stolen, or\r\n     sent out and not charged, allowances made customers, all debts,\r\n     etc.\r\n\r\n     10. Charge collection expense.\r\n\r\n     11. Charge any other expense not enumerated above.\r\n\r\n     12. When it is ascertained what the sum of all the foregoing items\r\n     amounts to, prove it by the books, which will give the total\r\n     expense for the year; divide this figure by the total of sales, and\r\n     it will show the percent which it has cost to do business.\r\n\r\n     13. Take this percent and deduct it from the price of any article\r\n     sold, then subtract from the remainder what it cost (invoice price\r\n     and freight), and the result will show the net profit or loss on\r\n     the article.\r\n\r\n     14. Go over the selling prices of the various articles and see what\r\n     are profits; then get busy in putting your selling figures on a\r\n     profitable basis and talk it over with your competitor as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Credit Policy for Retailers_\r\n\r\nWhile the minor factors governing a credit policy for retailers vary\r\nwith local conditions, the fundamental principles are alike everywhere,\r\nand should have the thoughtful consideration of all retail distributers\r\nof coffee. After a retail grocery store experience of twenty-five years,\r\na past president of the National Association of Retail Grocers of the\r\nUnited States[344] found that a grocer should insist upon references and\r\na thorough investigation of every new applicant for credit, refusing the\r\nprivilege when the prospective customer hesitates to give the needed\r\ninformation; that he should arrange a date for periodical payments,\r\nexplaining that this is necessary so that the storekeeper can arrange to\r\nmeet his own bills, which will enable him to discount his invoices and\r\nto sell his goods cheaper; that statements of accounts should be sent\r\nout promptly and never a few days late; that he should insist on payment\r\nin full when due, requesting the customer to call if an extension of\r\ntime is asked; that he should not let the customers decide when they\r\nwill pay bills, bearing in mind that the possible loss of a few\r\ncustomers who do not pay promptly is offset by the advantages of cash\r\nwhen promised; that he should never abandon the hope of collecting an\r\nold account, but should try the method of sending statements only to the\r\nsurest customers, sending a clerk for the collection of all other\r\naccounts; that he should personally examine all uncollected accounts\r\nevery month, insisting on a reason for failure to pay; that he should\r\nstudy his customers and not trust those who give a bad impression; that\r\nhe should have the courage to say \"No\" when necessary; not to be\r\nsatisfied with merely a financial rating on a credit applicant, but to\r\nascertain his general reputation and character; and to help to eliminate\r\nthe \"dead beats\" by giving careful attention to all requests received\r\nfrom other retailers for credit information.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Premiums for Retailers_\r\n\r\nHouse-to-house dealers are the largest users of premiums among coffee\r\ndistributers. Most of them operate under what is known as the\r\nadvance-premium method.\r\n\r\nThe plan followed by house-to-house dealers until about 1910 was to\r\nissue checks redeemable in premiums after a certain amount of tea,\r\ncoffee, or other products had been purchased. This practise has not been\r\nentirely abandoned; but in most instances, the premium is now handed to\r\nthe consumer in advance of the initial purchase, in consideration of the\r\nbuyer's promise to use a stipulated quantity of tea, coffee, or other\r\nmerchandise. The driver of the wagon generally carries a portfolio\r\nillustrating numerous premium items redeemable through the purchase of\r\nvarying amounts of merchandise.\r\n\r\nMany retail coffee stores also employ premiums, using both the old-style\r\nand \"advance\" methods. This type of store, however, is being supplanted\r\nby the chain grocery store.\r\n\r\nSome independent retail grocers use premiums to a limited extent. These\r\nusually carry a small line of premiums, featuring a piece of\r\nkitchenware, or other inexpensive item, with bulk coffee.\r\n\r\nIt is significant that one of the largest chain-store organizations in\r\nthe United States--the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company--uses few\r\npremiums today, although its business was founded on the premium idea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN AMERICANIZED ENGLISH GROCER'S SHOP\r\n\r\nErnest Carter's store at St. Albans, England, operated under the name of\r\nThomas Oakley & Co., has a distinctly American atmosphere, accounted for\r\nby the fact that the fittings were supplied by an American manufacturer,\r\nthe Walker Bin Co., of Penn Yan, N.Y. The tea and coffee department is\r\nshown in the foreground. The coffee is roasted in the window]\r\n\r\nTrading stamps, which are sold to grocers and other merchants by firms\r\nmaking a specialty of this form of premium-giving are little used\r\nnowadays. The average retail grocer is antagonistic to trading stamps,\r\nas a result of the methods of certain unscrupulous stamp-dealers.\r\nLegislation against trading stamps is in effect in many states.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOME PACKAGE COFFEES THAT ADVERTISING HAS MADE FAMOUS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nA SHORT HISTORY OF COFFEE ADVERTISING\r\n\r\n     _Early coffee advertising--The first coffee advertisement in 1587\r\n     was frank propaganda for the legitimate use of coffee--The first\r\n     printed advertisement in English--The first newspaper\r\n     advertisement--Early advertisements in colonial America--Evolution\r\n     of advertising--Package coffee advertising--Advertising to the\r\n     trade--Advertising by means of newspapers, magazines, billboards,\r\n     electric signs, motion pictures, demonstrations, and by\r\n     samples--Advertising for retailers--Advertising by government\r\n     propaganda--The Joint Coffee Trade publicity campaign in the United\r\n     States--Coffee advertising efficiency_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a work of this character the chapter on advertising must of necessity\r\nbe in story form. It may tell what has been accomplished in advertising\r\ncoffee, and perhaps point the way to greater achievement. In so far as\r\npossible, the story is supplemented by illustrations, which here tell\r\nthe story even better than words.\r\n\r\nAdvertising to the trade or the consumer calls for expert advice. There\r\nare successful trade journalists who are competent to supply such\r\nadvertising counsel; and new-comers in the field should consult them\r\nfirst. These men are in the best position to suggest the means for\r\nsuccessful accomplishment. They know the men who are best qualified to\r\nrender assistance for all media, and are glad to recommend those who can\r\nbe most helpful.\r\n\r\nJarvis A. Wood has said that advertising is causing another to know, to\r\nremember, and to do. If we agree with this excellent definition, then\r\nthe first coffee advertisers were the early physicians and writers who\r\ntold their fellows something about the berry and the beverage made from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nRhazes and Avicenna told the story in Latin, and appear to have\r\nrecommended a coffee decoction as a stomachic, as far back as the tenth\r\ncentury. Many other early physicians refer to it. Thus it was that\r\ncoffee was solemnly introduced to the consumer as a medicine. The first\r\nstep made by the berry from the cabinets of the curious, where it was\r\nknown as an exotic seed, was into the apothecaries' shops, where it was\r\nsold and advertised as a drug. Next, the coffee drink was advertised and\r\nsold by lemonade venders; then by the proprietors of the coffee houses\r\nand cafés; and finally the coffee merchant sold and advertised the green\r\nand roasted bean.\r\n\r\nRauwolf told the Germans about it in 1582; Abd-al-Kâdir wrote his famous\r\n_Argument in favor of the legitimate use of coffee_ in Arabic about\r\n1587; Alpini carried the news to Italy in 1592; English travelers wrote\r\nabout the beverage in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; French\r\nOrientalists described it about the same time; and America learned about\r\nit long before the green beans were offered for sale in Boston in 1670.\r\n\r\nBecause of its frank propaganda character, Abd-al-Kâdir's manuscript may\r\nrightly be called the earliest advertisement for coffee. The author was\r\na lawyer-theologian, a follower of Mahomet, and as such was eager to\r\nconvince his contemporaries that coffee drinking was not incompatible\r\nwith the prophet's law.\r\n\r\nSoon the news of the day became the advertising of the morrow. In 1652\r\nappeared the first printed advertisement for coffee in English. It was\r\nin the form of a shop-bill, or handbill, issued by Pasqua Rosée from the\r\nfirst London coffee house in St. Michael's Alley, Cornhill; and the\r\noriginal is preserved in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nIt is pictured on page 55, chapter X, and is worthy of close\r\nexamination. It reads:\r\n\r\n     The Vertue of the _COFFEE_ Drink\r\n\r\n     First publiquely made and sold in England, by _Pasqua Rosée_.\r\n\r\n     The Grain or Berry called _Coffee_, groweth upon little Trees, only\r\n     in the _Deserts of Arabia_.\r\n\r\n     It is brought from thence, and drunk generally throughout all the\r\n     Grand Seigniors Dominions.\r\n\r\n     It is a simple innocent thing, composed into a Drink, by being\r\n     dryed in an Oven, and ground to Powder, and boiled up with Spring\r\n     water, and about half a pint of it to be drunk, fasting an hour\r\n     before, and not Eating an hour after, and to be taken as hot as\r\n     possibly can be endured; the which will never fetch the skin off\r\n     the mouth, or raise any Blisters, by reason of that Heat.\r\n\r\n     The Turks drink at meals and other times, is usually _Water_, and\r\n     their Dyet consists much of _Fruit_, the _Crudities_ whereof are\r\n     very much corrected by this Drink.\r\n\r\n     The quality of this Drink is cold and Dry; and though it be a\r\n     Dryer, yet It neither _heats_, nor _inflames_ more then _hot\r\n     Posset_.\r\n\r\n     It so closeth the Orifice of the Stomack, and fortifies the heat\r\n     within, that it's very good to help digestion, and therefore of\r\n     great use to be taken about 3 or 4 a Clock afternoon, as well as in\r\n     the morning.\r\n\r\n     It much quickens the _Spirits_, and makes the Heart _Lightsome_. It\r\n     is good against sore Eys, and the better if you hold your Head over\r\n     it, and take in the Steem that way.\r\n\r\n     It suppresseth Fumes exceedingly, and therefore good against the\r\n     _Head-ach_, and will very much stop any _Defluxion of Rheums_, that\r\n     distil from the _Head_ upon the _Stomack_, and so prevent and help\r\n     _Consumptions_; and the _Cough of the Lungs_.\r\n\r\n     It is excellent to prevent and cure the _Dropsy_, _Gout_, and\r\n     _Scurvy_.\r\n\r\n     It is known by experience to be better than any other Drying Drink\r\n     for _People in years_, or _Children_ that have any _running humors_\r\n     upon them, as the _Kings Evil_,&c.\r\n\r\n     It is very good to prevent _Mis-carryings_ in _Child-bearing\r\n     Women_.\r\n\r\n     It is a most excellent Remedy against the _Spleen_, _Hypocondriack\r\n     Winds_, or the like.\r\n\r\n     It will prevent _Drowsiness_, and make one fit for business, if one\r\n     have occasion to _Watch_; and therefore you are not to Drink of it\r\n     _after Supper_, unless you intend to be watchful, for it will\r\n     hinder sleep for 3 or 4 hours.\r\n\r\n     _It is observed that in Turkey, where this is generally drunk, that\r\n     they are not trobled with the Stone, Gout, Dropsie, or Scurvey, and\r\n     that their Skins are exceedingly cleer and white._\r\n\r\n     It is neither _Laxative_ nor _Restringent_.\r\n\r\n     Made and sold in St. _Michaels Alley_ in _Cornhill_, by Pasqua\r\n     Rosée, at the Signe of his own Head.\r\n\r\nThe noteworthy thing about this advertisement is, that in comparison\r\nwith the best copy of today, it has high merit. For this early\r\nadvertisement seems to have embodied in it superbly well those\r\nqualifications which modern advertising experts agree are essential\r\nrequirements for success--measured in terms of sales to the consumer. We\r\nshall return to it later.\r\n\r\nThe first newspaper advertisement for coffee appeared in the form of a\r\n\"reader\" in the issue of _The Publick Adviser_, London, for the week of\r\nTuesday, May 19, to Tuesday, May 26, 1657. _The Publick Adviser_ was a\r\nweekly pamphlet partaking of the nature of a commercial news-letter. The\r\nadvertisement was sandwiched between a reader advertising a doctor of\r\nphysick and one for an \"artificer,\" the latter being a ladies'\r\nhair-dresser. It was as follows:\r\n\r\n     In _Bartholomew_ Lane on the back side of the Old Exchange, the\r\n     drink called _Coffee_, (which is a very wholesom and Physical drink,\r\n     having many excellent vertues, closes the Orifice of the Stomack,\r\n     fortifies the heat within, helpeth Digestion, quickneth the\r\n     Spirits, maketh the heart lightsom, is good against Eye-sores,\r\n     Coughs, or Colds, Rhumes, Consumptions, Head-ach, Dropsie, Gout,\r\n     Scurvy, Kings Evil, and many others is to be sold both in the\r\n     morning, and at three of the clock in the afternoon.)\r\n\r\nAbout the time that Pascal opened the first coffee house in Paris in\r\n1672, the Paris shop-keepers began to advertise coffee by broadsides. A\r\ngood example is the following,[345] the text of which closely resembles\r\nthe original by Pasqua Rosée:\r\n\r\n     _The most excellent Virtue of the Berry called_ Coffee.\r\n\r\n     _Coffee_ is a Berry which only grows in the desert of _Arabia_,\r\n     from whence it is transported into all the Dominions of the Grand\r\n     Seigniour, which being drunk dries up all the cold and moist\r\n     humours, disperses the wind, fortifies the Liver, eases the dropsie\r\n     by its purifying quality, 'tis a Sovereign medicine against the\r\n     itch, and corruptions of the blood, refreshes the heart, and the\r\n     vital beating thereof, it relieves those that have pains in their\r\n     Stomach, and cannot eat; It is good also against the indispositions\r\n     of the brain, cold, moist, and heavy, the steam which rises out of\r\n     it is good against the _Rheums_ of the eyes, and drumming in the\r\n     ears: 'Tis excellent also against the shortness of the breath,\r\n     against _Rheums_ which trouble the Liver, and the pains of the\r\n     Spleen; It is an extraordinary ease against the Worms: After having\r\n     eat or drunk too much: Nothing is better for those that eat much\r\n     Fruit.\r\n\r\n     The daily use hereof in a little while will manifest the aforesaid\r\n     effect to those, that being indisposed shall use it from time to\r\n     time.\r\n\r\nThe following are typical London trade advertisements of 1662 and 1663.\r\nThe first is from the _Kingdom's Intelligencer_ of June 5, 1662, and\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n     At the Exchange Ally from Cornhill into Lumber Street neer the\r\n     Conduit, at the Musick-Room belonging to the Palsgrave's Hall, is\r\n     sold by retayle the right coffee powder; likewise that termed the\r\n     Turkey Berry, well cleansed at 30d. per pound ... the East India\r\n     berry (so called) of the best sorts at 20d. per pound, of which at\r\n     present in divers places there is very bad, which the ignorant for\r\n     cheapness do buy, and is the chief cause of the now bad coffee\r\n     drunk in many plaies (sic).\r\n\r\nThe _Intelligencer_ for December 21, 1663, contained the following\r\nadvertisement:\r\n\r\n     There is a Parcel of Coffee-Berry to be put to publique sale upon\r\n     Wednesday, the 23, instant, at 6 a clock in the evening at the\r\n     Globe Coffee-house at the end of St. Bartholomew Lane, over against\r\n     the North Gate of the Royall Exchange.... And if any desire to be\r\n     further informed they may repair to Mr. Brigg, Publique Notary at\r\n     the said Globe Coffee-house.\r\n\r\nDufour's treatise on _The Manner of Making Coffee, Tea and Chocolate_,\r\npublished in Lyons, 1684, was generally regarded as propaganda for the\r\nbeverage; and, indeed, it proved an excellent advertisement, being\r\nquickly translated into English and several other languages.\r\n\r\nIn 1691 we find advertised in the _Livre Commode_ of Paris a portable\r\ncoffee-making outfit to fit the pocket.\r\n\r\nThe first coffee periodical, _The New and Curious Coffee House_, was\r\nissued at Leipzig by Theophilo Georgi in 1707, being a kind of house\r\norgan for what was, perhaps, the first kaffee-klatsch; the\r\npublisher-proprietor, however, admitted that the idea of making his\r\ncoffee salon a resort for the literati was obtained from Italy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENT SOLELY FOR COFFEE IN THE\r\nUNITED STATES\r\n\r\n_New York Daily Advertiser_, February 9, 1790]\r\n\r\nIn chapter X we have described a number of broadsides, handbills, and\r\npamphlets having to do with the introduction of the coffee drink into\r\nLondon between 1652 and 1675. The advertising student would do well to\r\nrefer to them because they serve to show how completely the true merits\r\nof the beverage were lost sight of by those who urged its more fantastic\r\nclaims. It is interesting to note, however, that this early copy was of\r\na high order of typographical excellence; indeed, the display letter\r\nused for the word coffee is often like that found in copy in the United\r\nStates two hundred and fifty years after. Also, it should be noted that\r\n\"apt 'illustration's' artful aid\" was first employed in 1674. Again,\r\nnote this curious contrast. Two hundred and sixty-nine years ago all the\r\nresources of advertising were being laid under contribution to make\r\npropaganda for coffee as the great _cure_ for many ailments of which\r\nnowadays the enemies of coffee would have us believe coffee is the\r\ncause! Those who have possessed themselves of the facts about coffee\r\nknow that both arguments are equally fantastic.\r\n\r\nCoffee was mentioned in shop-keepers' announcements appearing in the\r\n_Boston News Letter_ as early as 1714, and in other newspapers of the\r\ncolonies during the eighteenth century, usually being offered for sale\r\nat retail with strange companions. In 1748 \"tea, coffee, indigo,\r\nnutmegs, sugar, etc.,\" were advertised for sale at a shop in Dock\r\nSquare, Boston. The following advertisement from the _Columbian\r\nCentinel_, Boston, April 26, 1794, is typical:\r\n\r\n     GROCERIES AT NO. 44 _CORNHILL_ Norton and Holyoke Respectfully\r\n     inform their friends and the publick, that they have for sale, at\r\n     their Shop, No. 44 _Cornhill_, formerly the Post-Office.\r\n\r\n     A GENERAL ASSORTMENT OF GROCERIES among which are the following\r\n     articles: Teas, Spices, Coffee, Cotton, Indigo, Starch, Chocolate,\r\n     Raisins, Figs, Almonds, and Olives; West India Rum, best French\r\n     Brandy, excellent Cherry Wine, pure as imported, etc., etc., all\r\n     which they will sell as low as any store in Boston.\r\n\r\n     _Any article not liked will be taken again, and the money\r\n     returned._\r\n\r\nIt appears that the first advertisement dealing with coffee alone was\r\npublished in the _New York Daily Advertiser_ for February 9, 1790; and\r\nthis was primarily an advertisement of a wholesale coffee roasting\r\nfactory rather than an advertisement of coffee per se.\r\n\r\nThis advertisement, and a later one published in Loudon's _New York\r\nPacket_ for January 1, 1791, also of a coffee manufactory, are\r\nreproduced herewith.\r\n\r\nNot until package coffee began to come into vogue in the sixties was\r\nthere any change in the stereotyped business-card form followed by all\r\ndealers in coffee. And even then the monotony was varied only by\r\ninserting the brand name, such as \"Osborn's Celebrated Prepared Java\r\nCoffee. Put up only by Lewis A. Osborn\"; \"Government coffee in tin foil\r\npound papers put out by Taber & Place's Rubia Mills.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Evolution of Coffee Advertising_\r\n\r\nReal progress in coffee advertising, as in publicity for other lines of\r\ntrade and industry, began in the United States. Here too, it has been\r\nbrought to its lowest degradation and to its highest efficiency. The\r\nentire process has taken something less than fifty years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY COFFEE ADVERTISING IN UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nPrinted in the _New York Packet_, January 1, 1791]\r\n\r\nThe first step forward was the picture handbill. The handbill, or\r\ndodger, had been common enough in England and on the Continent, where,\r\nfor upward of two hundred years it had served as an advertising medium,\r\nin company with the more robust broadside, and in competition with the\r\npamphlet and newspaper. It remained for America, however, to glorify the\r\nhandbill by means of colored pictures; and one of the earliest and best\r\nspecimens of the picture handbill is the Arbuckle circular here\r\nillustrated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST HANDBILL IN COLORS FOR PACKAGE COFFEE ABOUT 1872]\r\n\r\nSoon the handbill copy began to appear in the newspapers, but mostly\r\nwithout the illustrations. Later newspaper developments were to\r\nintroduce more of the picture element, decorative border, and design.\r\nThe ideas of European artists were freely drawn upon, but put to so\r\nutilitarian uses that their originators would scarce have recognized\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn the _Ladies Home Journal_ for December, 1888, the Great London Tea\r\nCompany, Boston, an early mail-order house, advertised, \"We have made a\r\nspecialty since 1877 of giving premiums to those who buy tea and coffee\r\nin large quantities.\" In the same issue, there was an advertisement of\r\nSeal Brand and Crusade Brand coffee by Chase & Sanborn, Boston. Dilworth\r\nBros., Pittsburgh, were also among the early users of magazine space.\r\n\r\nThe menace of the cereal coffee-substitute evil had grown to such\r\nproportions at the beginning of the twentieth century, that the coffee\r\nmen began to be concerned about it. Misleading and untruthful\r\n\"substitute\" copy was freely accepted by nearly all media. The package\r\nlabels were as bad, if not worse. With the advent of the pure food law\r\nof 1906, the cereal label abuse was reformed; but not until the \"truth\r\nin advertising\" movement became a power to be reckoned with, nearly ten\r\nyears later, were the coffee men granted a substantial measure of\r\nprotection in the magazines and newspapers. Meanwhile, many coffee men,\r\nlacking organization and a knowledge of the facts about coffee,\r\nunwittingly played into the hands of the substitute-fakers by publishing\r\nunfortunate defensive copy which made confusion worse confounded in the\r\nconsumer's mind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REVERSE SIDE OF THE ARBUCKLE HANDBILL (IN COLORS) OF\r\n1872]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A ST. LOUIS HANDBILL OF 1854]\r\n\r\nAt one time there were nearly one hundred coffee-substitute concerns\r\nengaged in a bitter, untruthful campaign directed against coffee. The\r\nmost conspicuous offender employed the principle of auto-suggestion and\r\nfound a goodly number of pseudo-physicians and bright advertising minds\r\nthat were quite willing to prostitute their finest talents to aid him in\r\nattacking an honorable business.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADVERTISING-CARD COPY, 1873]\r\n\r\nIn one year $1,765,000 was spent in traducing the national beverage. The\r\nburden of the cereal-faker's song was that coffee was the cause of all\r\nthe ills that flesh is heir to, and that by stopping its use for ten\r\ndays and substituting his panacea, these ills would vanish.\r\n\r\nOf course, there were many people (but they were the minority) who knew\r\nthat the caffein content of coffee was a pure, safe stimulant that did\r\nnot destroy the nerve cells like such false stimulants as alcohol,\r\nmorphine, etc.; and that while too much could be ingested from abuse of\r\nany beverage containing it, nature always effected a cure when the abuse\r\nwas stopped.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was undoubtedly created in the public mind a suspicion,\r\nthat threatened to develop into a prejudice, and that affected otherwise\r\nsane and normal people, that perhaps coffee was not good for them.\r\n\r\nThen came the winter of the coffee men's discontent. Floundering about\r\nin a veritable slough of cereal slush, without secure foothold or a true\r\nsense of direction, coffee advertising went miserably astray when its\r\nwriters began to assure the public that _their_ brands were guiltless of\r\nthe crimes charged in the cereal men's indictment. In this, of course,\r\nthey unwittingly aided and abetted the cereal fakers. For example, one\r\nroaster-packer advertised, \"The harmful ingredient in coffee is the\r\ntannin-bearing chaff, which our roasting and grinding process completely\r\nremoves.\" Scientific research has since proved the fallacy of this idea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HANDBILL COPY OF THE SEVENTIES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOX-END STICKER, 1833]\r\n\r\nAnother roaster said, \"if coffee works havoc with your nerves and\r\ndigestion, it is because you are not using a fresh roasted, thoroughly\r\ncleaned, correctly cured coffee. Our method of preparing gives you the\r\nstrength and aroma without its nerve-destroying qualities.\" A well known\r\ncoffee packer advertised, \"Our coffee is free from the dust and bitter\r\ntannin--the only injurious property in coffee.\" Still another packer\r\ninformed the consumer that \"by a very special steel cutting process\" he\r\nsliced the coffee beans \"so that the little cells containing the\r\nvolatile oil (the food product) are not broken.\"\r\n\r\nA prominent Chicago packer put out a new brand of coffee which he\r\nclaimed was \"non-intoxicating,\" \"poisonless,\" and the \"only pure\r\ncoffee.\" A New Yorker, not to be out-done, brought out a coffee that he\r\nsaid contained all the stimulative properties of the original coffee\r\nberries, but with every trace of acid removed, every undesirable element\r\neliminated. \"Also,\" he added for good measure, \"this coffee may be used\r\nfreely without harming the digestive organs or impairing the nervous\r\nsystem.\"\r\n\r\nAnd one package-coffee man became so exercised over cereal competition\r\nthat he brought out a _grain_ \"coffee\" of his own, which he actually\r\nadvertised as \"the nearest approach to coffee ever put on the market,\r\nhaving all the merits without any objectionable features, strengthening\r\nwithout stimulating, satisfying without shattering the nerves.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so history again repeated itself in America. Five hundred years\r\nafter the first religious persecution of the drink in Arabia, we find it\r\nbeing persecuted by commercial zealots in the United States. And even in\r\nthe house of its friends, coffee was being stabbed in the back. The\r\ncoffee merchants themselves presented the spectacle of \"knocking\" it by\r\ninference and innuendo.\r\n\r\nSomething had to be done. As cereal drinks, standing on their own feet,\r\nthe coffee \"substitutes\" would have attracted little notice. It was only\r\nby trading on the allegation that they were _substitutes for coffee_\r\nthat they made any headway. The original offender sold his product as\r\n\"coffee,\" which was an untruth, as he later admitted there was not a\r\nbean of coffee in it. He boldly advertised: \"Blank coffee for persons\r\nwho can't digest ordinary coffee.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it became no longer possible to perpetrate an untruth on the\r\npackage label, there still remained the newspapers and billboards. For\r\nyears before fake-advertising laws and an outraged public opinion made\r\nrecourse to these no longer possible, it was a common practise to use\r\nthe newspapers and billboards to promote the idea that here was a\r\ndifferent coffee; and in this way to create a demand for a package,\r\nwhich, when purchased, was found to tell a different story.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CHASE & SANBORN ADVERTISEMENT, 1888\r\n\r\nAs printed in _Harper's_ and _Scribner's Magazines_]\r\n\r\nAs late as 1911, one of our most respected New York dailies was carrying\r\nan advertisement calling the product \"coffee,\" although fairness\r\ndemands it be recorded that the coffee part of the announcement was\r\nstricken out when _The Tea and Coffee Trade Journal_ called the\r\nattention of the publisher to its misleading character. This trade\r\npaper, from its start, had been urging the coffee men to organize for\r\ndefense. The agitation bore fruit at last, first in the starting of the\r\nNational Coffee Roasters Association, and later in the inception of the\r\nmovement that resulted in the international advertising campaign for\r\ncoffee now in progress in the United States.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the cereal coffee-substitute had been thoroughly discredited\r\nby governmental analysis, although even today newspaper publishers are\r\nto be found here and there who are willing to \"take a chance\" with\r\npublic opinion and who will admit to their advertising columns such\r\nmisleading statements for the substitute, as \"it has a coffee-like\r\nflavor.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GOLDBERG CARTOON, 1910]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEWSPAPER COPY USED BY CHASE AND SANBORN ABOUT 1900]\r\n\r\nIn the United States today, coffee advertising has reached a high plane\r\nof copy excellence. Our coffee advertisers lead all nations. The\r\neducational work started by _The Tea and Coffee Trade Journal_, fostered\r\nby the National Coffee Roasters Association, and developed by the Joint\r\nCoffee Trade Publicity Committee, has laid low many of the bugaboos\r\nraised by the cereal sinners. The coffee men, however, have left\r\nconsiderable room for improvement. There are still some who are given to\r\nmaking exaggerated claims in their publicity, who make reflections upon\r\ncompetitors in a way to destroy public confidence in coffee, and who\r\ndisplay an ignorance of, or a lack of confidence in, their product by\r\ncontinuing to claim that their brands do not contain what they assert\r\nare injurious or worthless constituents. It is to be hoped that in time\r\nthese abuses will yield to the further enlightening influence of the\r\ntrade press, and of the organizations that are continually working for\r\ntrade betterment.\r\n\r\nBefore the international coffee campaign started in 1919, the National\r\nCoffee Roasters Association promoted two national coffee weeks, one in\r\n1914 and another in 1915, wherein excellent groundwork was done for the\r\nbig joint coffee trade propaganda that followed. Some original research\r\nalso was done along lines of proper grinding and correct coffee brewing.\r\nA better-coffee-making committee, under the direction of Edward Aborn of\r\nNew York, rendered yeoman's service to the cause. Much educational work\r\nwas done in schools and colleges, among newspaper editors, and in the\r\ntrade. This campaign was the first co-operative publicity for coffee.\r\nAmong other things, it put a nation-wide emphasis on iced coffee as a\r\ndelectable summer drink and, for the first time, stressed the correct\r\nmaking of the beverage by drip and filtration methods instead of by\r\nboiling, which had long been one of the most crying evils of the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART SHOWING MONEY SPENT ON ADVERTISING COFFEE AND\r\nSUBSTITUTES\r\n\r\nOnly advertisements printed in magazines and periodicals are considered\r\nin making this calculation]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Package Coffee Advertising_\r\n\r\nCoffee advertising began to take on a distinctive character with the\r\nintroduction of Ariosa by John Arbuckle in 1873. Some of the early\r\npublicity for this pioneer package coffee appears typographically crude,\r\njudged by modern standards; but the copy itself has all the needful\r\npunch, and many of the arguments are just as applicable today as they\r\nwere a half-century ago. Take the handbill copy illustrated. It was done\r\nin three colors, and the argument was new and most convincing. The\r\nreverse side copy is also extremely effective. Note the expert-roaster\r\nargument and coffee-making directions; some of these may still be found\r\nin current coffee advertising.\r\n\r\nMost of the original Arbuckle advertising was by means of circulars or\r\nbroadsides, although some newspaper space was employed. Premiums were\r\nfirst used by John Arbuckle as an advertising sales adjunct, and they\r\nproved a big factor in putting Ariosa on the map. Mr. Arbuckle created\r\nthe kind of word-of-mouth publicity for his goods that is the most\r\ndifficult achievement in the business of advertising. It caused so deep\r\nand lasting an impression, that in some sections it has persisted\r\nthrough at least five decades. The advertising moral is: Get people to\r\n_talk_ your brand.\r\n\r\nSince the death of its founder, the Arbuckle copy has been changed to\r\nfit modern conditions. That it has kept pace with all the forward\r\nmovements in business and advertising is evident from the specimens\r\nwhich help to illustrate this chapter. A significant change is to be\r\nnoted in the fact that, for the first time in its history, \"the greatest\r\ncoffee business in the world\" has adopted a policy of advertising to the\r\ntrade as well as to the consumer, thus giving its publicity a well\r\nrounded character which it formerly lacked.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of other notable package coffees is also shown by\r\nillustration. Several concerns blazed new trails that have since been\r\npicked up and followed by competing brands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARTS SHOWING PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION AND COFFEE AND\r\nSUBSTITUTE ADVERTISING]\r\n\r\nAmong the many long-established advertised package-coffee successes may\r\nbe mentioned:\r\n\r\nArbuckle's Yuban and Ariosa; McLaughlin's XXXX; Chase & Sanborn's Seal\r\nBrand; Dwinell-Wright's White House; Weir's Red Ribbon; B. Fischer &\r\nCompany's Hotel Astor; Brownell & Field's Autocrat; Bour's Old Master;\r\nScull's Boscul; Seeman Brothers' White Rose; Blanke's Faust; Baker's\r\nBarrington Hall; Woolson Spice Company's Golden Sun; International\r\nCoffee Company's Old Homestead; Kroneberger's Old Reserve; Western\r\nGrocer Company's Chocolate Cream; Leggett's Nabob; Clossett & Dever's\r\nGolden West; R.C. Williams' Royal Scarlet; Merchants Coffee Company's\r\nAlameda; Widlar Company's C.W. brand; Meyer Bros.' Old Judge; Nash-Smith\r\nTea and Coffee Company's Wedding Breakfast; J.A. Folger & Company's\r\nGolden Gate; Ennis Hanley Blackburn Coffee Company's Golden Wedding;\r\nM.J. Brandenstein & Company's M.J.B.; Hills Brothers' Red Can, the Young\r\n& Griffin Coffee Company's Franco-American, and the Cheek-Neal Coffee\r\nCompany's Maxwell House.\r\n\r\nIt was estimated that the amount of money spent by the larger coffee\r\nroasters upon all forms of publicity in the United States in 1920 was\r\nabout $3,000,000.\r\n\r\nCharts prepared by Charles Coolidge Parlin of the division of commercial\r\nresearch of the Curtis Publishing Company, and checked by the\r\nPublishers' Information Bureau, show the advertising for coffee and for\r\ncoffee substitutes in thirty leading publications from 1911 to 1920; and\r\ncompare the advertising for coffee and coffee substitutes in 1920 with a\r\nchart of per capita consumption. It should be noted that the figures\r\nexclude all other forms of advertising, such as newspapers,\r\nbill-posting, street-car signs, electric signs, and so forth.\r\n\r\nExperience has proven that a package coffee, to be successful, must have\r\nback of it expert knowledge on buying, blending, roasting, and packing,\r\nas well as an efficient sales force. These things are essential: (1) a\r\nquality product; (2) a good trade-mark name and label; (3) an efficient\r\npackage. With these, an intelligently planned and carefully executed\r\nadvertising and sales campaign will spell success. Such a campaign\r\ncomprehends advertising directed to the dealer and to the consumer. It\r\nmay include all the approved forms of publicity, such as newspapers,\r\nmagazines, billboards, electric signs, motion pictures, demonstrations,\r\nand samples. One phase of trade advertising which should not be\r\noverlooked is dealer helps. The extent to which the roaster-packer, or\r\nthe promoter of a new package coffee, should utilize the various\r\nadvertising media or go into dealer helps must, of course, depend upon\r\nthe size of the advertising appropriation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EFFECTIVE CUT-OUT]\r\n\r\nMany roaster-packers supply grocers handling their coffee with dealer\r\nhelps in the shape of weather-proof metal signs for outside display,\r\ndisplay racks, store and window display signs, cut-outs, blotters,\r\nconsumer booklets, newspaper electros, stereopticon slides, moving\r\npictures, demonstrations, samples, etc. Dealer selling schemes based on\r\npoints have also been found helpful in promoting sales.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Advertising to the Trade_\r\n\r\nUntil a comparatively recent date, the green coffee importer, selling\r\nthe roasting trade, has not realized the need of advertising. He has\r\ninclined to the belief that he did not need to advertise, because, in\r\nmost instances, green coffee is not sold by the mark; and, to a certain\r\nextent, price has been the determining factor.\r\n\r\nDuring late years, however, many green coffee firms have come to realize\r\nthat there is a good-will element that enters into the equation which\r\ncan be fostered by the intelligent use of advertising space in the\r\ncoffee roaster's trade journal. Also, a few importers are now featuring\r\ntrade marks in their advertising, thus building up a tangible trade-mark\r\nasset in addition to good will.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years the green coffee trade used the business card type\r\nof advertisement; but some are now utilizing a more up-to-date style of\r\ncopy, as typified by the advertisements of Leon Israel & Brothers and\r\nW.R. Grace & Company. Specimens of other green coffee advertising of the\r\nbetter kind are here reproduced.\r\n\r\nAdvertising campaigns in behalf of package coffees can not be fully\r\neffective without the proper use of trade publications. Advertising in\r\nthe dealer's paper has many advantages. It is good missionary work for\r\nthe salesman. It creates confidence in the mind of the dealer. It is an\r\nexcellent means for demonstrating to the retailer that he is being\r\nconsidered in the scheme of distribution--that no attempt is being made\r\nto force the goods upon him through consumer advertising alone.\r\nTrade-paper advertising also offers the packer the opportunity to\r\nacquaint the dealer with the selling points in favor of the brand\r\nadvertised, thus saving the time of the salesman. An increasing number\r\nof coffee packers are now using the advertising columns of trade papers,\r\nand some typical advertisements are reproduced herewith.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Advertising by Various Mediums_\r\n\r\nBillboard and other outdoor advertising, also car cards, are being used\r\nto a considerable extent for coffee publicity. Painted outdoor signs\r\nhave been the back-bone of one middle-west roaster's campaign for a\r\nnumber of years. Both car cards and billboards are growing in popularity\r\nbecause they enable the coffee packer to reproduce his package in its\r\nnatural colors and permit also of striking displays. Such firms as\r\nArbuckle Brothers, New York; Dayton Spice Mills, Dayton, Ohio; W.F.\r\nMCLaughlin & Company, Chicago; the Puhl-Webb Company, Chicago; the Bour\r\nCompany, Toledo; B. Fischer & Company, New York; and the Cheek-Neal\r\nCoffee Company, Nashville and New York, are consistent users of this\r\ncharacter of advertising. Electric signs also have proved effective for\r\ncoffee advertising. Reproductions of some characteristic outdoor and\r\ncar-card advertisements are to be found in these pages.\r\n\r\nMotion pictures are a comparatively new development in coffee\r\nadvertising. One of the first coffee roasters to adopt this plan of\r\npublicity was S.H. Holstad & Company, Minneapolis. The film used\r\ndepicted the cultivation and preparation of coffee for the market, also\r\nthe complete roasting and packaging operations. The A.J. Deer Company,\r\nmanufacturers of coffee mills and roasters, Hornell, N.Y., was another\r\npioneer in the use of coffee films. Jabez Burns & Sons, coffee-machinery\r\nmanufacturers, followed with an educational coffee picture. The National\r\nPackaging Machinery Company, of Boston, is another concern that has\r\nutilized films for advertising purposes, showing its machines in\r\noperation in a coffee-packing plant. Many roasters made use of the\r\ncoffee film produced by the Joint Coffee Trade Publicity Committee.\r\n\r\nIn using advertising films, it is customary for the roaster to arrange\r\nfor a showing at one or more theaters. The advertising in the local\r\npapers features the coffee brands, also the name of the local dealer,\r\nthe latter being furnished with tickets which he distributes among his\r\nretail customers. There are several concerns making a business of\r\nsupplying commercial films and of getting distribution for them.\r\n\r\nAnother form of theater publicity is that of the advertising\r\nslide--stereopticon views thrown upon the screen between feature\r\npictures. Many packers find these are effective for cultivating the\r\ndealer, it being customary to show the brand name, together with that of\r\nthe local distributer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Advertising for Retailers_\r\n\r\nWhen retailers analyze the people to whom they sell coffee, they usually\r\nfind three types. First, there is the woman who thinks she is an expert\r\njudge of coffee, but who is unable to find anything to suit her\r\ncultivated taste. Then there is the new housewife, possibly a bride of a\r\nfew months, who knows very little about coffee, but wants to find a good\r\nblend that both she and her husband will like. The third is the most\r\nacceptable class, the satisfied people who have found coffee that\r\ndelights them, day after day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW COFFEE IS ADVERTISED TO THE TRADE\r\n\r\nLeft to right, good examples of green coffee publicity--center,\r\nwell-arranged package-coffee copy]\r\n\r\nW. Harry Longe, a Texas retailer, has prepared the following \"ready\r\nmade\" copy appeals for the three classes. To \"Mrs.\r\nKnow-it-all-about-Coffee,\" this style has been found effective:\r\n\r\n     IMPROVE THE COFFEE AND YOU IMPROVE THE MEAL\r\n\r\n     The corner of the table that holds the coffee urn is the balancing\r\n     point of your dinner. If the coffee is a \"little off\" for some\r\n     reason or other--probably it's the coffee's own fault--things don't\r\n     seem as good as they might; but when it is \"up to taste\" the meal\r\n     is a pleasure from start to finish. If the \"balancing point\" is\r\n     giving you trouble, let ANY BLEND Coffee properly regulate it for\r\n     you. 35 cents, three pounds for $1.\r\n\r\n     ANY TEA & COFFEE COMPANY\r\n\r\nFor the good lady who is anxious to find a suitable blend of coffee, and\r\nwho desires information, this is a good appeal:\r\n\r\n     A SUCCESSFUL SELECTION\r\n\r\n     Of the coffee that goes into the every-morning cup will arrive on\r\n     the day when ANY BLEND is first purchased. Many homes have been\r\n     without such a success now for a long time, but, of course, they\r\n     didn't know of ANY BLEND--and even now it is hard to really know\r\n     ANY BLEND till you try it. That is why we seem to insist that you\r\n     ask for an introduction by ordering a pound.\r\n\r\n     ANY BLEND TEA & COFFEE COMPANY\r\n\r\nTaking both classes and dealing with them alike:\r\n\r\n     \"BLENDED TO BALANCE\"\r\n\r\n     Is a good descriptive phrase of ANY BLEND coffee, for care is taken\r\n     in the preparation that the strength does not overpower the flavor.\r\n     The aim of the blender is to get an acceptable and delightful\r\n     drinking quality. He has been more than successful, as you will see\r\n     when you try ANY BLEND, 35 cents, three pounds for $1.\r\n\r\n     ANY TEA & COFFEE COMPANY\r\n\r\nThe satisfied class, of course, is not averse to making a change, and it\r\nis well, occasionally, for the dealer to let his own satisfied customers\r\nknow he still believes in his goods. The argument might take this form:\r\n\r\n     A SERVICE THAT SAVES\r\n\r\n     Is the serving of ANY BLEND, when coffee is desired. ANY BLEND\r\n     saves many things. It saves worry, for it is always uniform in\r\n     flavor and strength. It saves time, for when you order ANY BLEND we\r\n     grind it just as fine or just as coarse as your percolator or pot\r\n     demands. ANY BLEND also saves expense, because there is no waste,\r\n     as you know just how much to use, every time, to make a certain\r\n     number of cups. 35 cents, three pounds for $1.\r\n\r\n     ANY TEA & COFFEE COMPANY\r\n\r\nAgain, possible new customers may listen to this appeal:\r\n\r\n     TO PROVE YOUR APPROVAL\r\n\r\n     Of ANY BLEND coffee, you are asked to try just one pound. We know\r\n     you will like it, for it is blended and roasted and ground as an\r\n     exceptional coffee should be, with the care that a good coffee\r\n     demands. Prove to yourself that you approve of this method of\r\n     preparing coffee. 35 cents, three pounds for $1.\r\n\r\n     ANY TEA & COFFEE COMPANY\r\n\r\nIn some households the cook is permitted to do the ordering, and usually\r\nthe cook does not read the daily papers with an eye for coffee ads. To\r\nreach this individual through her mistress:\r\n\r\n     CAN YOU NAME YOUR COFFEE?\r\n\r\n     Or is it one of those many unknown brands that comes from the store\r\n     at the order of your cook? Let the cook do the ordering, for you\r\n     are lucky if you have one you can rely upon, but tell her you\r\n     prefer ANY BLEND to the No-Name Blend you may now be using. ANY\r\n     BLEND has one distinct advantage over all others; It Is freshly\r\n     roasted. Tell the kitchen-lady, now, to order ANY BLEND.\r\n\r\n     ANY TEA & COFFEE COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\n_Advertising by Government Propaganda_\r\n\r\nAdvertising coffee by government propaganda has been indulged in with\r\nmore or less success by the British government in behalf of certain of\r\nits colonial possessions; by the French and the Dutch; by Porto Rico,\r\nCosta Rica, Guatemala, and Brazil. The markets most cultivated have been\r\nItaly, France, England, Russia, Japan, and the United States.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain began the development of coffee cultivation in its\r\ncolonies in 1730. Parliament first reduced the inland duties. In many\r\nways it has since sought to encourage British-grown coffee, building up\r\na favoritism for it that is still reflected in Mincing Lane quotations.\r\nThe Netherlands government did the same thing for Java and Sumatra; and\r\nFrance rendered a similar service to her own colonies.\r\n\r\nSince Porto Rico became a part of the United States, several attempts\r\nhave been made by the island government and the planters to popularize\r\nPorto Rico coffee in the United States. Scott Truxtun opened a\r\ngovernment agency in New York in 1905. Acting upon the counsel and\r\nadvice of the author, he prosecuted for several years a vigorous\r\ncampaign in behalf of the Porto Rico Planters' Protective Association.\r\nThe method followed for coffee was to appoint official brokers, and to\r\ncertify the genuineness of the product. Owing to insufficient funds and\r\nthe number of different products for which publicity was sought, the\r\ncoffee campaign was only moderately successful.\r\n\r\nMortimer Remington, formerly with the J. Walter Thompson Company, a New\r\nYork advertising agency, was appointed in 1912 commercial agent for the\r\nPorto Rico Association, composed of island producers and merchants. Some\r\neffective advertising in behalf of Porto Rico coffee was done in the\r\nmetropolitan district, where a number of high-class grocers were\r\nprevailed upon to stock the product, which was packed under seal of the\r\nassociation. As before, however, the other products handled--including\r\ncigars, grape-fruit, pineapples, etc.--handicapped the work on coffee,\r\nand the enterprise was abandoned. Subsequent efforts by the Washington\r\ngovernment to assist the Porto Ricans in evolving a practical plan to\r\nextend their coffee market in the United States came to naught because\r\nof too much \"politics.\"\r\n\r\nBeginning with the Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco in 1915,\r\nthe government of Guatemala started a propaganda for its coffee in the\r\nUnited States; as the European market, which had up till then absorbed\r\nseventy-five percent of its product, was closed to it, owing to the\r\nWorld War. E.H. O'Brien, a coffee broker of San Francisco, directed the\r\npublicity. Some full pages were used in newspapers, but the main efforts\r\nwere directed at the coffee-roasting trade. The campaign, so far as it\r\nwent, was highly successful.\r\n\r\nCosta Rica also gave special encouragement to coffee-trade interests\r\nthat offered to expand the United States market for Costa Rica coffee\r\nduring the World War.\r\n\r\nFor many years Colombia has been talking of making propaganda here for\r\nits coffee, but thus far nothing of a constructive character has been\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nSão Paulo began in 1908 to make propaganda for its coffee by subsidizing\r\ncompanies and individuals in consuming countries to promote consumption\r\nof the Brazil product. A contract was entered into between the state of\r\nSão Paulo and the coffee firms of E. Johnston & Company and Joseph\r\nTravers & Son, of London, to exploit Brazil coffee in the United\r\nKingdom. Similar contracts were made with coffee firms in other European\r\ncountries, notably in Italy and France. The subsidies were for five\r\nyears and took the form of cash and coffee. The English company was\r\nknown as the \"State of São Paulo (Brazil) Pure Coffee Company, Ltd.\"\r\nFifty thousand pounds sterling was granted this enterprise, which\r\nroasted and packed a brand known as \"Fazenda;\" promoted demonstrations\r\nat grocers' expositions; and advertised in somewhat limited fashion. The\r\ngeneral effect upon the consumption of coffee in England was negligible,\r\nhowever, although at one time some five thousand grocers were said to\r\nhave stocked the Fazenda brand. A feature of this propaganda was the use\r\nof the Tricolator (an American device since better known in the United\r\nStates) to insure correct making of the beverage, Brazil also made\r\npropaganda for its coffee in Japan, in 1915, as part of certain\r\nundertakings involving the immigration of Japanese laborers to Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe Comité Français du Café was formed in Paris in July, 1921, to\r\nco-operate with Brazil in an enterprise designed to increase the\r\nconsumption of coffee in France.\r\n\r\nThe chief fault in most of the coffee propagandas here and abroad has\r\nbeen the doubtful practise of subsidizing particular coffee concerns\r\ninstead of spending the funds in a manner designed to distribute the\r\nbenefits among the trade as a whole. This mistake, and local politics in\r\nthe producing countries, have made for ultimate failure. A notable\r\nexception is the latest propaganda for Brazil coffee in the United\r\nStates, where all the various interests, the the São Paulo government,\r\nthe growers, exporters, importers, roasters, jobbers, and dealers, have\r\nco-operated in a plan of campaign to advertise coffee _per se_, and not\r\nto secure special privilege to any individual, house, or group.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Joint Coffee Trade Publicity Campaign_\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago the author began an agitation for co-operative\r\nadvertising, by the coffee trade. He suggested as a slogan, \"Tell the\r\ntruth about coffee;\" and it is gratifying to find that many of his\r\noriginal ideas have been embodied in the present joint coffee trade\r\npublicity campaign, now in its fourth year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THEODORE LANGGAARD DE MENEZES]\r\n\r\nThe coffee roasters at first were slow to respond to the co-operative\r\nadvertising suggestion, because in those days competition was more\r\nunenlightened than now, and therefore more ruthless. It needed\r\norganization to bring the trade to a better understanding of the\r\nbenefits certain to be shared by all when their individual interests\r\nwere pooled in a common cause. Leaders of the best thought in the trade,\r\nhowever, were quick to realize that only by united effort was it\r\npossible to achieve real progress; and when it was suggested that the\r\nfirst step was to organize the roasting trade, the idea took so firm a\r\nhold that it only needed some one to start it to bring together in one\r\ncombination the keenest minds in the business.\r\n\r\nThe coffee roasters organized their national association in 1911. The\r\nauthor of this work urged that co-operative advertising based upon\r\nscientific research should be done by the roasters themselves\r\nindependently of the growers; but it was found impracticable to unite\r\ndiverging interests on such an issue, and so the leaders of the movement\r\nbent all their energies toward promoting a campaign that would be backed\r\njointly by growers and distributers, since both would receive equal\r\nbenefit from any resulting increase in consumption. Brazil, the source\r\nof nearly three-quarters of the world's coffee, was the logical ally;\r\nand an appeal was made to the planters of that country. A party of ten\r\nleading United States roasters and importers visited Brazil in 1912 at\r\nthe invitation of the federal government.\r\n\r\nIn Brazil, as in the United States, progress resulted from organization.\r\nThe planters of the state of São Paulo, who produce more than one-half\r\nof all coffee used in the United States, were the first to appreciate\r\nthe propaganda idea. After their attempts to interest the national\r\ngovernment failed, the São Paulo coffee men founded the _Sociedade\r\nPromotora da Defesa do café_ (Society to Promote the Defense of Coffee),\r\nand persuaded their state legislature to pass a law taxing every bag of\r\ncoffee shipped from the plantations of that state in a period of four\r\nyears. This tax, amounting to one hundred reis per bag of 132 pounds, or\r\nabout two and one-half cents United States money at even exchange rates,\r\nis collected by the railroads from the shippers, and turned over to the\r\n_Sociedade_.\r\n\r\nThe Brazilian Society sent to the United States a special envoy,\r\nTheodore Langgaard de Menezes, to conclude arrangements; and on March 4,\r\n1918, in New York, the pact was signed whereby São Paulo was to\r\ncontribute to the publicity campaign in the United States approximately\r\n$960,000 at the rate of $240,000 a year for four years; and the members\r\nof the trade in the United States were to contribute altogether\r\n$150,000[346]. The success of the negotiations was due to the skilful\r\nmanagement of Ross W. Weir in the United States, and to the superior\r\nsalesmanship of Louis R. Gray, the Arbuckle representative in Brazil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOINT COFFEE TRADE PUBLICITY COMMITTEE IN UNITED STATES]\r\n\r\nSupervision of the advertising in the United States was delegated to\r\nfive men, representing both the importing and roasting branches of the\r\ntrade, and designated as the Joint Coffee Trade Publicity Committee of\r\nthe United States. Three of these committeemen, Ross W. Weir, of New\r\nYork; F.J. Ach, of Dayton, Ohio; and George S. Wright, of Boston, are\r\nroasters; and two, William Bayne, Jr., and C.H. Stoffregen, both of New\r\nYork, are importers and jobbers, or green-coffee men. The committee\r\norganized with Mr. Weir as chairman, Mr. Wright as treasurer, and Mr.\r\nStoffregen as secretary. At the invitation of the committee, C.W. Brand\r\nof Cleveland, then president of the National Coffee Roasters\r\nAssociation, attended committee meetings, and assisted in determining\r\nthe policies of the campaign. Headquarters were established at 74 Wall\r\nStreet, in the heart of the New York coffee district, with Felix Coste\r\nas secretary-manager, and Allan P. Ames as publicity director. N.W. Ayer\r\n& Son, advertising agents of Philadelphia, who had engineered the plan\r\nof campaign from the start of the movement in the National Coffee\r\nRoasters Association, handle the advertising account.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART SHOWING PLAN OF ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN]\r\n\r\nSão Paulo's contribution to the advertising fund is sent in monthly\r\ninstalments to the Joint Coffee Trade Publicity Committee under an\r\nagreement that it shall be expended only for magazine and newspaper\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOINT-COMMITTEE MAGAZINE AND NEWSPAPER COPY, 1919]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COPY THAT STRESSED THE HEALTHFULNESS OF COFFEE,\r\n1919-1920]\r\n\r\nSupplementing this Brazilian contribution, is the fund raised by\r\nvoluntary subscriptions from the coffee trade of the United States on\r\nthe basis of one cent per bag handled annually. This American fund is\r\nused for the expenses of administration, for educational advertising\r\noutside of magazine and newspaper space, and for various kinds of trade\r\npromotion and dealer stimulation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE JOINT COMMITTEE'S HOUSE ORGAN]\r\n\r\nThe first advertising appeared in April, 1919, in 306 leading newspapers\r\nin 182 large cities, with a total circulation of more than 16,000,000.\r\nThe cities chosen represented all the centers of wholesale coffee\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\nMagazine advertising began in June of the same year, using twenty-one\r\nperiodicals, all of national circulation. This list has been changed\r\nfrom time to time to meet the special needs of the campaign.\r\n\r\nMore than fifty grocery-trade magazines have carried the committee's\r\ndealer advertising, although not all of these have been used\r\ncontinuously. Every part of the country was represented on the\r\ntrade-paper list.\r\n\r\nFull pages have been run each month in nine of the leading national\r\nmedical journals. These advertisements were written by a physician of\r\nnational reputation. Under the caption, \"The Case for Coffee,\" these\r\nadvertisements have discussed the properties of coffee from the\r\nphysiological standpoint, and have asked the doctors to judge it fairly.\r\n\r\nFrom the start the committee's advertising has been broadly educational.\r\nThe properties of coffee have been discussed; charges against coffee\r\nhave been answered. The housekeeper has been told how to get the best\r\nresults from the coffee she buys; hotel and restaurant proprietors have\r\nbeen reminded that many of them owe their prosperity largely to a\r\nreputation for serving good coffee; new uses have been exploited for\r\ncoffee, as a flavoring agent for desserts and other sweets; employers\r\nhave been taught the important service good coffee may render in\r\nincreasing the comfort and efficiency of their working forces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTRODUCTORY MEDICAL-JOURNAL COPY]\r\n\r\nMagazine and newspaper advertising is only the nucleus of the campaign.\r\nThe effect of such \"white space\" publicity is increased by simultaneous\r\nefforts to \"merchandise\" the campaign, to stimulate the interest of the\r\nwholesale and retail trade, to encourage private-brand advertising, and\r\nto reach the consumer by other kinds of publicity recognized as\r\nessential factors in a well rounded national advertising effort. These\r\nactivities may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TELLING THE DOCTORS THE TRUTH ABOUT COFFEE, 1920]\r\n\r\nINFORMATION SERVICE. This department answers inquiries and supplies\r\nmaterial for household editors, and for newspaper and magazine writers.\r\nThrough a national clipping service, it keeps in touch with all\r\npublished matter relating to coffee. Its special duty is to answer\r\nattacks on coffee and the coffee trade. Merchants and dealers make it a\r\npractise, when they find misleading articles or editorials in their\r\nlocal newspapers, to send clippings to the committee's headquarters to\r\nbe handled there as the situation warrants.\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC COFFEE RESEARCH. Twenty-two thousand, five hundred dollars of\r\nthe American fund have been appropriated thus far for scientific coffee\r\nresearch at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The reports of\r\nthis research will be distributed to the coffee trade throughout the\r\ncountry, and should prove valuable in all branches of coffee\r\nmerchandising. The findings will be distributed by the committee to\r\nschools and colleges, and to consumers through national advertising.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOME OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE'S ATTRACTIVE BOOKLETS]\r\n\r\nTHE COFFEE CLUB. This organization was established for the purpose of\r\neducating the consumer through constructive team work by the roasters'\r\nand jobbers' salesman and the retail dealer. Under this plan, the\r\ncommittee has distributed 50,000 transparent signs for dealers' windows,\r\nand 5,000 bronze coffee-club buttons for coffee salesmen. By reference\r\nto the Coffee Club in national magazine and newspaper advertising, the\r\nretailer is given a chance to tie up with the campaign. Membership in\r\nthe club is limited to those who are contributing to the publicity fund,\r\nand to their salesmen and customers. The club publishes a monthly\r\nbulletin in newspaper form, giving the news of the campaign. This has a\r\ncirculation of 27,000 among wholesalers, salesman, and dealers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MORE MEDICAL JOURNAL COPY, 1920]\r\n\r\nBOOKLETS. The committee has published six booklets, which have reached\r\na total circulation of more than one and a half million copies. These\r\nbooklets are sold at cost to the coffee trade. The committee reports\r\nthat, on an average, one hundred requests for them are received daily at\r\nits office from consumers in different parts of the country, and that\r\nthe booklets are the means of a constant campaign of education in\r\nAmerican homes and schools.\r\n\r\nBRAND ADVERTISING. The committee is constantly making efforts to\r\nincrease the amount of private advertising by coffee roasters, and it\r\nestimates that brand advertising has increased at least three hundred\r\npercent since the national campaign began. Reproductions of the\r\ncommittee's advertisements, proofs of advertising electrotypes, and copy\r\nsuggestions are circulated in advance to all roasters and to a large\r\nnumber of retailers, by means of the monthly organ, _The Coffee Club_.\r\n\r\nCOFFEE WEEK. During the week of March 29 to April 4, 1920, the committee\r\norganized and financed the third national coffee week, which was\r\nobserved by retailers throughout the country. The feature of this week\r\nwas a window-trimming contest for which prizes of $2,000 were\r\ndistributed among several hundred grocers. The contest resulted in\r\ndisplays of coffee in nearly 10,000 grocery windows, and greatly\r\nincreased the sale and consumption of coffee during this period.\r\n\r\nMOTION PICTURES. The United States fund financed the production and\r\ndistribution of a coffee motion picture, 128 prints of which were sold\r\nto roasters, who exhibited them throughout the country. This picture was\r\nshown during coffee week to more than six hundred theater audiences, and\r\nit remains in the possession of the trade as an active advertising\r\nmedium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPECIMENS OF THE 1921 MAGAZINE AND NEWSPAPER COPY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDUCATING THE DOCTOR IN THE FACTS ABOUT COFFEE, 1922]\r\n\r\nNEW USES FOR COFFEE. An important factor in increasing consumption has\r\nbeen the promotion of new uses for coffee. In winter, this has taken the\r\nform or recipes and suggestions for coffee as a flavoring agent; and in\r\nwarm weather, there has been a publicity drive for iced coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Propaganda Results_\r\n\r\nThe joint coffee trade publicity campaign is progressive. New features\r\nare being developed, and plans are laid well in advance. It is expected\r\nthat the reports of the scientific research will furnish fresh material\r\nfor both direct and indirect advertising.\r\n\r\nOne of the interesting prospects is a school exhibit, demand for which\r\nhas been revealed by requests from a large number of teachers,\r\nprincipals, and school superintendents. Efforts to increase the\r\npopularity of a product as widely used as coffee suggest almost\r\nunlimited opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe campaign has brought into co-operation producers in one country, and\r\nmanufacturers and distributers in another country, several thousand\r\nmiles apart. Its international character, and also the fact that it\r\ndeals with a product of almost universal use, may account for the\r\nattention this campaign has received, not only in the United States, but\r\nin every country where advertising is a business factor.\r\n\r\nThis kind of coffee publicity has given the consumer a better knowledge\r\nof coffee, and broken down much of the prejudice against coffee that\r\nrested upon popular misunderstanding of its physiological effects.\r\n\r\nAs best evidence of its sincere wish to give the public the whole truth\r\nabout coffee, the committee points to the fact that a portion of its\r\nfunds is being used to finance the scientific investigation at the\r\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology.\r\n\r\nFelix Coste, the secretary-manager of the campaign, spends much of his\r\ntime traveling about the country and addressing gatherings of coffee\r\nwholesalers and dealers. By this means, and by continuous\r\ncircularization and correspondence, the trade is kept constantly in\r\ntouch with the developments of the campaign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAGAZINE AND NEWSPAPER ADVERTISING COPY, SPRING OF 1922]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRIVATE BRAND COFFEE ADVERTISING IN 1921\r\n\r\nReport from 77 Advertisers]\r\n\r\nAlthough Brazil is the only coffee-producing country at present\r\nco-operating, the advertising has treated all coffees alike. Efforts are\r\nbeing made to have the coffee growers of other countries contribute on a\r\nbasis proportionate to the benefit they derive. Support from all the\r\ncoffee countries on the same scale as that on which the producers of São\r\nPaulo are contributing would almost double the size of the fund.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPECIMEN OF EARLY YUBAN COPY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Advertising Efficiency_\r\n\r\nReverting to the original advertisement for coffee in English, when we\r\ncompare it with the latest examples of advertising art, it is of the\r\nsame order of merit. But Pasqua Rosée had no advertising experts to\r\nadvise him and no precedents to follow. Pasqua Rosée was a native of\r\nSmyrna, who was brought to London by a Mr. Edwards, a dealer in Turkish\r\nmerchandise, to whom he acted as a sort of personal servant. One of his\r\nprincipal duties was the preparation of Mr. Edwards' morning drink of\r\nTurkish coffee.\r\n\r\n\"But the novelty thereof,\" history tells us, \"drawing too much company\r\nto him, he [Mr. Edwards] allowed his said servant, with another of his\r\nson-in-law, to sell it publicly.\" So it came about that Pasqua Rosée set\r\nup a coffee house in St. Michael's Alley, Cornhill.\r\n\r\nAnd since Pasqua Rosée's idea, naturally, was to acquaint the London\r\npublic with the virtues and delectable qualities of the product of which\r\nhis prospective customers were naturally uniformed, he put into his\r\nadvertisement those facts and arguments which he felt would be most\r\nlikely to attract attention, to excite interest, and to convince. If the\r\nreader will glance at Rosée's advertisement, which is reproduced on page\r\n55, he will be struck with the well-nigh irresistible charm of his\r\nunaffected, straightforward bid for patronage. Having no advertising\r\nfetishes to warp his judgment, he told an interesting story in a natural\r\nmanner, carrying conviction. It matters not that some of the virtues\r\nattributed to the drink have since been disallowed. He believed them to\r\nbe true. Few there were in those days who knew the real \"truth about\r\ncoffee.\"\r\n\r\nEven his typography, unstudied from the standpoint of modern \"display,\"\r\nis attractive, appropriate, and exceedingly pleasant to the eye. And\r\nsince at that time there was no cereal substitute or other bugaboos to\r\ncontend against, and to hinder him from doing the simple, obvious thing\r\nin advertising, he did that very thing--and did it exceedingly well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION IN ADVERTISING]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PACKAGE-COFFEE ADVERTISING IN 1922\r\n\r\nSpecimens of newspaper copy used by some of the most enterprising\r\npackage-coffee advertisers, East and West]\r\n\r\nIn fact, in the historic advertisement, Pasqua Rosée set an example and\r\nestablished a copy standard which had a very beneficial effect on all\r\nthe coffee advertising of that early date. This will be evident from a\r\nglance at the accompanying exhibits of other early advertisements. It\r\nwas not until the days of so-called \"modern\" advertising that coffee\r\npublicity reached low-water mark in efficiency and value. In these dark\r\ndays most coffee advertisers ignored the principles discovered and\r\napplied in other lines of grocery merchandising. Instead of telling\r\ntheir public how good their product was, they actually followed the\r\nopposite course, and warned the public against the dangers of coffee\r\ndrinking! Instead of saying to the public, \"Coffee has many virtues, and\r\nour brand is one of the best examples,\" their text said in effect,\r\n\"Coffee has many deleterious properties; some, or most, of which have\r\nbeen eliminated in our particular brand.\"\r\n\r\nThey were, for the most part, apostles of negation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EMPHASIZING THE SOCIAL-DISTINCTION ARGUMENT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRAWING UPON HISTORY FOR SOCIAL-INTERCOURSE ATMOSPHERE]\r\n\r\nHopeful signs, however, are multiplying that this condition of things in\r\nthe coffee industry has passed, and that the practise of telling the\r\ncoffee story with certitude will soon become general.\r\n\r\nWe may well applaud the publicity work of all coffee advertisers who\r\nfollow where Pasqua Rosée led--those who tell the public how good coffee\r\nis to drink and how much good it does you if you drink it. Considering\r\nthe advertising and typographical resources available to the modern\r\nadvertiser, it certainly should be possible for this message to be\r\nconveyed to the public with at least some of the charm of the first\r\ncoffee message.\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable examples of how to advertise coffee well is that\r\nset by Yuban coffee. Unquestionably, Yuban is doing in a thoroughly\r\nup-to-date and appropriate fashion what Pasqua Rosée started out to do\r\nin 1652.\r\n\r\nThe effect on those who give only a superficial glance at a Yuban\r\nadvertisement is to arouse a keen desire to enjoy a cup of Yuban coffee.\r\nTo induce such a state of mind is, of course, the object of all good\r\nadvertising.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ELECTRIC SIGN THAT IMPRESSED CHICAGO\r\n\r\nThere were 4,000 bulbs in this advertisement, which measured 50 x 55\r\nfeet. The rental was $3,500 a month]\r\n\r\nYuban advertisements have utilized two vital principles in influencing\r\nthe minds of consumers. In the first place, they have made a cup of\r\ncoffee seem to be a very delectable drink. In the second place, they\r\nhave made the serving of a cup of coffee seem to be of the greatest\r\nsocial value.\r\n\r\nOne does not see in a Yuban advertisement any reference to the \"removal\r\nof caffein\", or to Yuban's \"freedom from defects common to other\r\ncoffees.\" There is no reference to the ill effects of drinking ordinary\r\ncoffee. Yuban wastes no valuable space in unselling coffee. Instead, the\r\nwhole intent, effectively carried out, is to paint an enticing picture\r\nby descriptive phraseology, typographic \"manner\", and illustrative\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nUntil Yuban came, those of us in the coffee trade who had given the\r\nmatter thought had often wondered why, with the wealth of material\r\navailable to writers of coffee advertisements, so little had been done\r\nto make the product alluring--why so little had been done to give\r\natmosphere to the product. So many interesting things may be said about\r\nthe history of coffee; the spread of the industry through various\r\ncountries; how Brazil came to be the coffee-producing country of the\r\nworld; how coffee is cultivated, harvested, and shipped; how it is\r\nstored, roasted, handled, delivered--in short, the entire process by\r\nwhich coffee reaches the breakfast table from the plantations of the\r\ntropics. Yuban made effective use of this material.\r\n\r\nSimply to tell these things in an interesting, natural, convincing way\r\nmakes coffee appear as a healthful, delicious drink; whereas the\r\nnegative, defensive sort of advertising, that plays into the hands of\r\nthe substitutes, puts coffee in the wrong light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THREE WELL KNOWN BRANDS OF COFFEE HAVE BEEN\r\nADVERTISED OUTDOORS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ATTENTION-ATTRACTING CAR CARDS, SPRING OF 1922]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EFFECTIVE ICED-COFFEE COPY--ADAPTABLE FOR ANY BRAND]\r\n\r\nWhen one reads Yuban advertisements, they are seen to be an entirely\r\nacceptable and appropriate presentation of coffee merit and thoroughly\r\nin accord with the principles of good advertising, as exemplified in all\r\nother lines of trade. The wonder grows why so many coffee advertisers\r\nhave been content to remain in the defensive, controversial position\r\ninto which the alarmist coffee-substitute advertising has jockeyed them.\r\n\r\nThe Yuban advertisements are not without their faults; errors of\r\nhistorical facts can be found in them; definitions are sometimes mixed;\r\nsome of the drawings might be better; but, in the main, the copy is\r\nconvincing and praiseworthy.\r\n\r\nIn Yuban advertisements the things that have been so long left undone\r\nhave now been done in a masterful way. If we refer to the accompanying\r\nillustrations, we can see how effectively the public is being led to\r\nrealize and believe in:\r\n\r\n1. The intrinsic desirability of coffee--the actual pleasure to be\r\nderived from the act of partaking of it.\r\n\r\n2. That it is delightful medium for social intercourse--part of the\r\nessential equipment for an intimate chat or more general assemblage of\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n3. That its proper service is a badge of social distinction--the mark of\r\na successful hostess.\r\n\r\nThese three thoughts, dominant in Yuban advertising, should be woven\r\ninto the fabric of all coffee advertising. For with these three\r\nthoughts, Arbuckle Brothers have blazed the trail for the right thing in\r\ncoffee advertising.\r\n\r\nThe Yuban case has been so largely dwelt upon here because it sets so\r\nbright and shining an example. Much that is praiseworthy in it and more\r\nalong the same lines is true of White House, Hotel Astor, and Seal\r\nBrand; but the copy shown will illustrate this better than any comment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EUROPEAN ADVERTISING NOVELTY IN NEW YORK\r\n\r\nThe absence of visible wheels aroused much curiosity in this slow-moving\r\nvehicle]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COENTIES SLIP, NEW YORK, IN THE DAYS OF SAILING VESSELS\r\n\r\nMany coffee ships from the West Indies, Arabia and the Dutch East Indies\r\nunloaded their cargoes here--From a copper-plate etching by F. Lee\r\nHunter]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE COFFEE TRADE IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n     _The coffee business started by Dorothy Jones of Boston--Some early\r\n     sales--Taxes imposed by Congress in war and peace--The first coffee\r\n     plantation-machine, coffee-roaster, coffee-grinder, and coffee-pot\r\n     patents--Early trade marks for coffee--Beginnings of the coffee\r\n     urn, the coffee container, and the soluble-coffee\r\n     business--Statistics of distribution of coffee-roasting\r\n     establishments in the trade from the eighteenth century to the\r\n     twentieth_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appears from the best evidence obtainable that the coffee trade of\r\nthe United States was started by a woman, one Dorothy Jones of Boston.\r\nAt least, Dorothy Jones was the first person in the colonies to whom a\r\nlicense was issued, in 1670, to sell coffee. It is not clear whether she\r\nsold the product in the green bean, roasted, \"garbled\" (ground), or\r\n\"ungarbled\".\r\n\r\nSoon after the introduction of the coffee drink into the New England,\r\nNew York, and Pennsylvania colonies, trading began in the raw product.\r\nWilliam Penn bought his green coffee supplies in the New York market in\r\n1683, paying for them at the rate of $4.68 a pound. Benjamin Franklin\r\nengaged in the retail coffee business in Philadelphia, in 1740, as a\r\nkind of side line to his printing business.\r\n\r\n\"Tea, coffee, indigo, nutmegs, sugar etc.\" were being advertised for\r\nsale in 1748 at a shop in Boston, \"under the vendue-room in\r\nDock-Square.\" Coffee was also to be had in that year at the shop of\r\nEbenezer Lowell in King Street, and at the Sign of the Four Sugar Loaves\r\nnear the head of Long Wharf.\r\n\r\nDuring the sway of the coffee houses, coffee fell from $4.68 a pound to\r\n40 cents a pound in 1750, and to 22 cents a pound just before the\r\nRevolution. As the war came on, however, dealers began to force up\r\nprices on a dwindling market. The situation became so serious that in\r\nJanuary, 1776, the Philadelphia Commission of Inspection issued a\r\nfair-price list, setting an arbitrary price of eleven pence per pound on\r\ncoffee in bag lots. Persons found violating this price were to be\r\n\"exposed to public view as sordid vultures preying on the vitals of the\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nDespite this threat, J. Peters in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, wrote to a\r\nPhiladelphia friend, \"I cannot purchase any coffee without taking, too,\r\none bill a tierce of Claret & Sour, and at £6.8 per gall.... I have been\r\ntrying day for day, & never could get a grain of Coffee so as to sell it\r\nat the limited price these six weeks. It may be bought, but at 25/ per\r\nlb.\"\r\n\r\nThe important part played by the coffee houses of colonial America,\r\nbeginning with the establishment of the London coffee house in Boston,\r\nin 1689, the King's Arms in New York in 1696, and Ye coffee house in\r\nPhiladelphia in 1700, has been related.\r\n\r\n\"Females\" of ye olde Boston, staging in 1777 a \"coffee party\" which\r\nrivaled in a small way the famous Tea Party in 1773, personally\r\nchastised a profiteer hoarder of foodstuffs, and confiscated some of his\r\nstock, according to a letter from Abigail Adams to her distinguished\r\nhusband, later second president of the United States.\r\n\r\nWriting at Boston, under date of July 31, 1777, Abigail wrote to John,\r\nthen attending the Continental Congress at Philadelphia:\r\n\r\n     There is a great scarcity of sugar and coffee, articles which the\r\n     female part of the state is very loath to give up, especially\r\n     whilst they consider the great scarcity occasioned by the merchants\r\n     having secreted a large quantity. It is rumored that an eminent\r\n     stingy merchant, who is a bachelor, had a hogshead of coffee in his\r\n     store, which he refused to sell under 6 shillings per pound.\r\n\r\n     A number of females--some say a hundred, some say more--assembled\r\n     with a cart and trunk, marched down to the warehouse, and demanded\r\n     the keys.\r\n\r\n     Upon his finding no quarter, he delivered the keys, and they then\r\n     opened the warehouse, hoisted out the coffee themselves, put it\r\n     into a trunk, and drove off. A large concourse of men stood amazed,\r\n     silent spectators of the whole transaction.\r\n\r\nIn 1783-84 the Congress of the United States considered the imposition\r\nof a duty on \"seven classes of goods consumed by the rich or in general\r\nuse; liquors, sugars, teas, coffees, cocoa, molasses and pepper; the tax\r\nto be determined by the yearly imports.\"\r\n\r\nAt that time there was being imported twelve times as much Bohea tea as\r\nof all others, but tea consumption was only one-twelfth pound per\r\ncapita. Total tea imports were 325,000 pounds. \"Low as was the\r\nimportation of tea\", says John Bach McMaster, \"that of coffee was lower\r\nstill by a third. Indeed, it was scarcely used outside of the great\r\ncities.\" The average annual coffee imports at that period were 200.000\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nGovernor Bowdoin of Massachusetts introduced chicory into the United\r\nStates in 1785.\r\n\r\nThe first import duty, of two and one-half cents a pound, was levied on\r\ncoffee by the United States in 1789. The principal sources of supply up\r\nto that time were the Dutch East Indies, Arabia, Haiti, and Jamaica; and\r\nmost of the business was in the hands of Dutch and English traders.\r\n\r\nWhat is thought to be the first wholesale coffee-roasting plant in\r\nAmerica began operations at 4 Great Dock (now Pearl) Street, New York,\r\nearly in 1790. In that same year the first American advertisement for\r\ncoffee appeared in the _New York Daily Advertiser_. A second \"coffee\r\nmanufactory\" started up at 232 Queen (also Pearl) Street, New York, late\r\nin 1790.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, 1790, the government increased the import duty on\r\ncoffee to four cents a pound. In 1794 the tax was raised to five cents a\r\npound.\r\n\r\nIn George Washington's household account book for 1793 appears an entry\r\nshowing a purchase of coffee from Benjamin Dorsay, a Philadelphia\r\ngrocer, for eight dollars. The quantity is not given.\r\n\r\nAbout 1804 Captain Joseph Ropes in the ship Recovery, of Salem, Mass.,\r\nbrought from Mocha the first cargo of coffee and other East Indian\r\nproduce in an American bottom.\r\n\r\nThe first cargo of Brazil coffee, consisting of 1,522 bags, was received\r\nat Salem, Mass., per ship Marquis de Someruelas in 1809. Brazil's total\r\nproduction that year was less than 30,000 bags; but by 1871 more than\r\n2,000,000 bags were exported.\r\n\r\nJava coffee could be bought on the Amsterdam market in 1810 for 42 to 46\r\ncents. By 1812, there had been an advance to $1.08 per pound. Holland,\r\nnot Brazil, ruled the world's coffee markets in those days.\r\n\r\nWhen the war of 1812 made necessary more revenue, imports of coffee were\r\ntaxed ten cents a pound. A war-time fever of speculation in tea and\r\ncoffee followed, and by 1814 prices to the consumer had advanced to such\r\nan extent (coffee was 45 cents a pound) that the citizens of\r\nPhiladelphia formed a non-consumption association, each member pledging\r\nhimself \"not to pay more than 25 cents a pound for coffee and not to\r\nconsume tea that wasn't already in the country.\"\r\n\r\nThe coffee duty was reduced in 1816 to five cents a pound; in 1830, to\r\ntwo cents; in 1831, to one cent; and in 1832 coffee was placed on the\r\nfree list. It remained there until 1861, when a duty of four cents a\r\npound was again imposed as a war-revenue measure. This was increased to\r\nfive cents in 1862. It was reduced to three cents in 1871; and the duty\r\nwas repealed in 1872. Coffee has remained on the free list ever since.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of machinery required in the coffee business began in\r\nthe eighteenth century. The first coffee-grinder patent in the United\r\nStates was issued to Thomas Bruff, Sr., in 1798. The first United States\r\npatent on an improvement on a roaster was issued to Peregrine Williamson\r\nof Baltimore in 1820. The first United States patent on a\r\ncoffee-plantation machine, a coffee huller, was granted to Nathan Reed\r\nof Belfast, Me., in 1822. The first United States coffee-maker patent\r\nwas issued to Lewis Martelley of New York, in 1825.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST UNITED STATES COFFEE-GRINDER PATENT]\r\n\r\nCharles Parker, of Meriden, Conn., began work on the original Parker\r\ncoffee mill in 1828.\r\n\r\nA complete English coffee roasting and grinding plant was installed in\r\nNew York City by James Wild in 1833-34.\r\n\r\nAbout 1840, Central America began making shipments of coffee to the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nJames Carter, of Boston, was granted (1846) a United States patent on an\r\nimproved form of cylindrical coffee roaster, which subsequently was\r\nlargely adopted by the trade in the United States, being popularly known\r\nas the Carter \"pull-out\".\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARTER'S PULL-OUT ROASTER PATENT]\r\n\r\nThe Geo. L. Squier Manufacturing Co. of Buffalo began in 1857 the\r\nmanufacture of coffee-plantation machinery. Marcus Mason invented his\r\nfirst pulper in 1860; but the manufacture of coffee-plantation machinery\r\nunder the firm name of Marcus Mason & Co. did not begin in the United\r\nStates until 1873.\r\n\r\nThe first paper-bag factory in the United States to make bags for loose\r\ncoffee, began operations in Brooklyn in 1862.\r\n\r\nThe first ground-coffee package was put on the New York market about\r\n1860-63 by Lewis A. Osborn. It was known as Osborn's Celebrated Prepared\r\nJava Coffee and was later exploited by Thomas Reid as Osborn's Old\r\nGovernment Java.\r\n\r\nIn 1864, Jabez Burns was granted a patent on the Burns roaster which was\r\nto revolutionize the coffee-roasting business.\r\n\r\nIn 1865, John Arbuckle brought out in Pittsburgh the first roasted\r\ncoffee in individual packages \"like peanuts\", the forerunner of the\r\nAriosa package.\r\n\r\nIn 1869, B.G. Arnold started the first big speculation in coffee and for\r\nten years thereafter he was absolute dictator of the American coffee\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nIn 1869, three United States patents on a copper coffee urn lined with\r\nblock tin were granted to Élie Moneuse and L. Duparquet of New York.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, John Gulick Baker, one of the founders of the Enterprise\r\nManufacturing Company of Pennsylvania, was granted a United States\r\npatent on a coffee grinder which subsequently became one of the most\r\npopular store mills.\r\n\r\nThe first trade mark registered for coffee or coffee essence bears the\r\nnumber 425, with date August 22, 1871, first use 1870, and is in the\r\nname of Butler, Earhart & Co., Columbus, Ohio. The words \"essence of\r\ncoffee\" appeared on the label. The next coffee mark was registered by\r\nButler, Earhart & Co., October 3, 1871, number 455, first use, 1870. It\r\nconsists of the word \"Buckeye\" with a branch of the buckeye\r\n(horse-chestnut) tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST REGISTERED TRADE MARK FOR COFFEE, 1871]\r\n\r\nThe next registration for coffee was in the name of John Ashcroft of\r\nBrooklyn. It is numbered 533, and the date is November 28, 1871. It\r\nconsists of an anchor and chain enclosing a star. Ashcroft registered\r\nalso a design of a coffee pot with the words \"Mocha Steam\", January 2,\r\n1872.\r\n\r\nToday there are nearly three thousand registered trade-mark names used\r\nfor coffee on file in the United States Patent Office in Washington.\r\n\r\nIn 1873, Ariosa, the first successful national brand of package coffee,\r\nwas launched in Pittsburg by John Arbuckle.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, 1873, the first United States patent on a coffee\r\nsubstitute was issued to E. Dugdale of Griffin, Ga.\r\n\r\nIn 1878, Chase & Sanborn, the Boston coffee roasters, were the first to\r\npack and to ship roasted coffee in sealed cans. A lead seal was used for\r\nthe large packages of bulk coffee; the smaller sizes being sealed by the\r\nlabel, which was made to cover the body of the can and to reach up over\r\nthe slip cover, so as to make a sealed package, to open which the label\r\nmust be broken.\r\n\r\nIn 1878, Jabez Burns, the coffee-machinery man, founded the _Spice\r\nMill_, the first publication in America devoted to the coffee and spice\r\ntrades.\r\n\r\nIn 1879, Charles Halstead brought out the first metal coffee pot with a\r\nchina interior.\r\n\r\nIn 1880, Henry E. Smyser, of Philadelphia, invented a\r\npackage-making-and-filling machine for coffee, the forerunner of the\r\nweighing-and-packing machine, the control of which later on by John\r\nArbuckle led to the coffee-sugar war with the Havemeyers. Smyser was\r\nsuperintendent at the plant of the Weikel & Smith Spice Company,\r\nPhiladelphia. Other patents on weighing and package-making machines were\r\ngranted him in 1884, 1888, and 1891. In 1892, he began to assign his\r\npatents to Arbuckle Brothers, some fifteen in all being granted him from\r\n1892 to 1898. He died in 1899.\r\n\r\nThe year 1880 was notable for the many failures in the American coffee\r\ntrade, as a result of syndicate planting and speculative buying of\r\ncoffees in Brazil, Mexico, and Central America.\r\n\r\nIn 1881, Steele & Price, of Chicago, were the first to introduce to the\r\ntrade all-paper cans, made of strawboard, for coffee.\r\n\r\nIn 1881, the New York Coffee Exchange was incorporated, beginning\r\nbusiness the year following at Beaver and Pearl Streets. In 1885, the\r\nproperty of the Exchange was transferred to the Coffee Exchange of the\r\nCity of New York, incorporated by special charter.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, the Chicago Liquid Sack Company brought out the first\r\ncombination paper and tin-end containers for coffee.\r\n\r\nThe year 1887-88 was marked by a big boom in coffee, the total sales on\r\nthe Coffee Exchange amounting to 47,868,750 bags. Between July 1886 and\r\nJune 1887 prices advanced 1,485 points.\r\n\r\nIn 1888, the Engelberg Huller Company of Syracuse, New York, began the\r\nmanufacture of coffee-plantation machinery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ORIGINAL ARBUCKLE COFFEE PACKAGES]\r\n\r\nIn 1891, the New England Automatic Weighing Machine Company, Boston,\r\nMass. began the manufacture of machines to weigh coffee into cartons and\r\nother packages; and in 1894, installed in the Chase & Sanborn plant at\r\nBoston the first automatic weighing machine in the coffee trade. The New\r\nEngland concern was subsequently (1901) succeeded by the Automatic\r\nWeighing Machine Company of Newark, N.J.\r\n\r\nIn 1893, the first direct-flame gas coffee roaster in America\r\n(Tupholme's English machine) was installed by F.T. Holmes at the plant\r\nof the Potter-Parlin Company, New York.\r\n\r\nIn 1893, Cirilo Mingo, of New Orleans, was granted a United States\r\npatent on a method of aging green coffee to give it the characteristics\r\nof green coffee stored in a confined space for a long period. The\r\noperation consisted in placing layers of green coffee between dry and\r\nwet empty coffee bags, and permitting the beans to absorb eight to ten\r\npercent of the moisture in a period extending from six to sixteen hours.\r\nThis was one of the earliest efforts to mature and age green coffee in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1894, the business of the Pneumatic Scale Corporation, Norfolk Downs,\r\nMass., had its start in Quincy, Mass. where the first pneumatic weighing\r\nmachine was installed by the Purity Dried Fruits Cleansing Company. In\r\n1895, the Electric Scale Company was organized to build the machines,\r\nthe subsequent development of this line of packaging machinery for\r\ncoffee being directed by the Pneumatic Scale Corporation, Ltd., which\r\nsucceeded it.\r\n\r\nIn 1895, Adolph Kraut introduced the German-made grease-proof lined\r\npaper bags for coffee to the American coffee trade. That same year,\r\nThomas M. Royal, of Philadelphia, began the manufacture in the United\r\nStates of a fancy duplex-lined paper bag for coffee.\r\n\r\nIn 1896, natural gas was first used in the United States as a fuel for\r\nroasting coffee.\r\n\r\nIn 1897, Joseph Lambert, Vermont, first introduced to the coffee trade a\r\nself-contained coffee roasting outfit without the brick setting required\r\nuntil then.\r\n\r\nIn 1897, the Enterprise Manufacturing Company of Pennsylvania was the\r\nfirst regularly to employ an electric motor to drive a coffee mill.\r\n\r\nThe overproduction of coffee began to be so serious a question by 1898,\r\nthat J.D. Olavarria, a distinguished Venzuelan, proposed a plan for the\r\nrestriction of coffee cultivation and the regulation of coffee exports\r\nfrom countries suffering from overproduction. In this same year, the\r\nbears forced Rio 7's down to four and one-half cents on the New York\r\nCoffee Exchange.\r\n\r\nIn 1898, Edward Norton, of New York, was granted a United States patent\r\non a vacuum process for canning foods, subsequently applied to coffee.\r\nOthers followed. Hills Brothers, of San Francisco, were the first to\r\npack coffee in a vacuum, under the Norton patents, in 1900. M.J.\r\nBrandenstein & Company, of San Francisco, began to pack coffee in vacuum\r\ncans in 1914. Vacuum sealing machines to pack coffee under the Norton\r\npatents are now made by the Perfect Vacuum Canning Company of New York.\r\n\r\nAbout 1899, Dr. Sartori Kato of Tokio, who had invented a soluble tea in\r\nJapan, came to Chicago and produced a soluble coffee (introduced to the\r\nconsumer in 1901) on which he was granted a patent in 1903. In 1906, G.\r\nWashington of New York, an American chemist living in Guatemala City,\r\nproduced a refined soluble coffee which was put on the United States\r\nmarket three years later. The full story of soluble coffee in America is\r\ntold in chapter XXXI. (See page 538.)\r\n\r\nThe first gear-driven electric coffee mill was introduced to the trade\r\nby the Enterprise Manufacturing Company of Pennsylvania in 1900.\r\n\r\nIn 1901, there appeared in New York the first issue of _The Tea and\r\nCoffee Trade Journal_, devoted to the interests of the tea and coffee\r\ntrades.\r\n\r\nIn 1900-01, Santos permanently displaced Rio as the world's largest\r\nsource of supply.\r\n\r\nIn 1901, the American Can Company began the manufacture and sale of tin\r\ncoffee cans in the United States. In this year Landers, Frary & Clark's\r\nUniversal coffee percolator was granted a United States patent; and\r\nJoseph Lambert, of Marshall, Mich., brought out one of the earliest\r\nmachines to employ gas as a fuel for the indirect roasting of coffee. It\r\nwas in 1901, also, that F.T. Holmes joined the Huntley Manufacturing\r\nCompany, of Silver Creek, N.Y., which began to build the Monitor\r\ngas-fired direct-flame coffee roasters.\r\n\r\nIn 1902, the Coles Manufacturing Company (Braun Company, successor) and\r\nHenry Troemner, of Philadelphia, began the manufacture and sale of\r\ngear-driven electric coffee grinders.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the agitation for some way to deal with the\r\noverproduction of coffee, the Pan-American Congress, meeting in Mexico\r\nCity in 1902, called an international coffee congress for New York in\r\nthe fall of that same year. It met from October 1 to October 30; but at\r\nthe close, the problem seemed no nearer solution than at the beginning.\r\nIn 1906, Brazil produced its record-breaking crop of 20,000,000 bags,\r\nand the state of São Paulo inaugurated a plan to valorize coffee.\r\n\r\nIn 1902, the first fancy duplex paper bag made by machinery from a roll\r\nof paper was produced by the Union Bag & Paper Corporation. It was of\r\nsulphite fiber inside, and glassine outside; a style afterward reversed,\r\nso as to have the glassine the inner tube.\r\n\r\nIn 1902, the Jagenberg Machine Company, Inc. (absorbed by the Pneumatic\r\nScale Corporation in 1921) began the introduction to the trade of the\r\nUnited States of a line of German-made automatic packaging-and-labeling\r\nmachines for coffee. Subsequently, the Johnson Automatic Sealer Company,\r\nBattle Creek, Mich., became well known as manufacturers of a line of\r\nautomatic adjustable carton-sealing, wax-wrapping machines, package\r\nconveyors, and automatic scales. Among other automatic weighers that\r\nhave figured in the development of the coffee business, mention should\r\nbe made of The National Packaging Machinery Company's Scott machine, of\r\nE.D. Anderson's Triumph, and of Hoepner's Unit System.\r\n\r\nIn 1903, as a result of overproduction in Brazil, Santos 4's dropped to\r\nthree and fifty-five hundredths cents on the New York Coffee Exchange,\r\nthe lowest price ever recorded for coffee.\r\n\r\nIn 1903, also, there was granted the first United States patent on an\r\nelectric coffee-roaster, the patentee being George C. Lester of New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nIn 1904, green coffee prices on the New York Coffee Exchange were forced\r\nup to eleven and eighty-five hundredths cents by a speculative clique\r\nled by D.J. Sully.\r\n\r\nIn 1905, the A.J. Deer Co., Buffalo, N. Y. (now of Hornell, N.Y.) began\r\nthe sale of its Royal electric coffee mills direct to dealers on the\r\ninstalment plan, revolutionizing the former practise of selling coffee\r\nmills through hardware jobbers.\r\n\r\nIn 1905, F.A. Cauchois introduced to the trade his Private Estate coffee\r\nmaker, a filtration device employing Japanese filter paper. Finley\r\nAcker, of Philadelphia, obtained a patent the same year on a\r\nside-perforation percolator employing \"porous or bibulous paper\" as a\r\nfiltering medium.\r\n\r\nIn 1906, H.D. Kelly, of Kansas City, was granted a United States patent\r\non an urn coffee machine employing a coffee extractor in which the\r\nground coffee was continually agitated before percolation by a vacuum\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nIn 1907, P.E. Edtbauer (Mrs. E. Edtbauer), of Chicago, was granted a\r\nUnited States patent on a duplex automatic weighing machine, the first\r\nsimple, fast, accurate and moderate-priced machine for weighing coffee.\r\nEight others followed up to 1920.\r\n\r\nIn 1907, the new Pure Food and Drugs Act came into force in the United\r\nStates, making it obligatory to label all coffees correctly and causing\r\nmany trade practises to be altered or thrown into the discard. The most\r\nimportant rulings that followed are referred to in more detail in\r\nchapter XXIII, telling how green coffees are bought and sold.\r\n\r\nIn 1908, the Porto Rico coffee planters, presented a memorial to the\r\nCongress asking for a protective tariff of six cents a pound on all\r\nforeign coffees. Hawaii and the Philippines, also were to have\r\nbenefited by the protection asked for. The Congress failed to grant the\r\nplanters' prayer. This appeal for protection was repeated in 1921, when\r\nthe Congress was asked to place a duty of five cents a pound on all\r\nforeign coffees.\r\n\r\nIn 1908, J.C. Prims, of Battle Creek, Mich. was granted a United States\r\npatent on a corrugated cylinder improvement for a gas and coal coffee\r\nroaster of fifty to one hundred and thirty pounds capacity designed for\r\nretail stores. This machine was acquired the year following by the A.J.\r\nDeer Company, and was re-introduced to the trade as the Royal roaster.\r\n\r\nIn 1908, Brazil's valorization-of-coffee enterprise was saved from\r\ndisaster by a combination of bankers and the Brazil Government. A loan\r\nof $75,000,000 was placed, through Hermann Sielcken of New York, with\r\nbanking houses in England, Germany, France, Belgium, and America. The\r\ncomplete story of this undertaking is told in chapter XXXI.\r\n\r\nIn 1909, Ludwig Roselius brought to America from Germany the\r\ncaffein-free coffee which for several years had been manufactured and\r\nsold in Bremen under the Myer, Roselius, and Wimmer patent. In 1910, the\r\nproduct was first sold here by Merck & Company under the name of Dekafa,\r\nlater Dekofa, and in 1914, by the Kaffee Hag Corporation as Kaffee Hag.\r\n\r\nIn 1911 all-fiber parchment-lined Damptite cans for coffee were\r\nintroduced to the trade by the American Can Company.\r\n\r\nAs a result of preliminary meetings of Mississippi Valley coffee\r\nroasters held in St. Louis in May and June, 1911, when the Coffee\r\nRoasters Traffic and Pure Food Association was organized, a national\r\nassociation under the same name was started in Chicago, November 16-17,\r\n1911. The complete story of the growth of this most important coffee\r\ntrade organization in the United States is told in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nIn 1912, the United States government, after having examined into the\r\nvalorization enterprise, brought suit against Hermann Sielcken, _et\r\nal._, to force the sale of valorized coffee stocks held in this country\r\nunder the valorization agreement.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1914, the first national coffee week to advertise coffee was\r\npromoted by the National Coffee Roasters Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Merchants Coffee House Memorial_\r\n\r\nOn May 23, 1914, the Lower Wall Street Business Men's Association\r\nunveiled a bronze memorial tablet set in the wall of the nine-story\r\noffice building occupied by the Federal Refining Company on the\r\nsoutheast corner of Wall and Water Streets, the former site of the\r\nMerchants' coffee house. This is the building where _The Tea and Coffee\r\nTrade Journal_ had its offices for nine years before moving to 79 Wall\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MERCHANTS COFFEE HOUSE TABLET\r\n\r\nBronze marker, placed May 23, 1914, on the building occupying the site\r\nof the old coffee house]\r\n\r\nSeth Low, introduced by William Bayne, Jr., president of the Lower Wall\r\nStreet Business Men's Association, gave an interesting sketch of the\r\nhistory of the coffee house. Abram Wakeman, secretary of the\r\nassociation, spoke, followed by Wilberforce Eames, of the American\r\nhistory division of the New York Public Library.\r\n\r\nAfter the flag that veiled the memorial tablet had been drawn aside,\r\nattention was called to a bronze chest which was hermetically sealed,\r\nand in which had been placed papers and other documents reflecting the\r\nlife of New York today. The chest was given over to the keeping of the\r\nNew York Historical Society, with the understanding that it was not to\r\nbe opened until 1974, which will be the two-hundredth anniversary of the\r\nunion of the Colonies.\r\n\r\nIt was from the Merchants' coffee house that the letter of May 23, 1774,\r\nwas written in reply to the Committee of Correspondence in Boston. The\r\nletter suggested a \"Congress of Deputies\" from the Colonies, and called\r\nfor a \"virtuous and spirited Union.\" The coffee house is consequently\r\nregarded as the birthplace of the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Recent Activities_\r\n\r\nA second national coffee week was held in October, 1915, under the\r\nauspices of the National Coffee Roasters' Association.\r\n\r\nIn 1916, the Coffee Exchange of the City of New York changed its name to\r\nthe New York Coffee and Sugar Exchange, to admit of sugar trading.\r\n\r\nIn 1916, the National Paper Can Company of Milwaukee first introduced to\r\nthe trade its new hermetically sealed all-paper can for coffee.\r\n\r\nIn 1916, Jules Le Page, Darlington, Ind., was granted two United States\r\npatents on cutting rolls to cut and not grind or crush corn, wheat, or\r\ncoffee. This idea was incorporated in the Ideal steel cut coffee mill\r\nsubsequently marketed by the B.F. Gump Company, Chicago.\r\n\r\nIn 1918, the World War caused the United States government to place\r\ncoffee importers, brokers, jobbers, roasters, and wholesalers under a\r\nwar-time licensing system to control imports and prices.\r\n\r\nIn 1918, John E. King, of Detroit, was granted a United States patent on\r\nan irregular grind of coffee consisting of coarsely grinding ten percent\r\nof the product and finely grinding ninety percent.\r\n\r\nThe most notable event of the year 1919 was the inauguration by the\r\nBrazil planters, in co-operation with an American joint coffee trade\r\npublicity committee, of the million-dollar campaign to advertise coffee\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1919, as a result of frost damage, and of an orgy of speculation in\r\nBrazil, prices for green coffee on the New York Exchange were forced to\r\nthe highest levels since 1870; and a new high record was established for\r\nfutures, twenty-four and sixty-five hundredths cents for July contracts.\r\n\r\nIn 1919, Floyd W. Robison, of Detroit, was granted a United States\r\npatent on a process for aging green coffee by treating it with\r\nmicro-organisms, the product being known as Cultured coffee.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1920, there was held the third national coffee week,\r\nthis time under the auspices of the Joint Coffee Trade Publicity\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE GREEN AND ROASTED COFFEE BUSINESS IN THE UNITED\r\nSTATES\r\n\r\n     _A brief history of the growth of coffee trading--Notable firms and\r\n     personalities that have played important parts in green coffee in\r\n     the principal coffee centers--Green coffee trade\r\n     organizations--Growth of the wholesale coffee-roasting trade, and\r\n     names of those who have made history in it--The National Coffee\r\n     Roasters Association--Statistics of distribution of coffee-roasting\r\n     establishments in the United States_\r\n\r\n\r\nCoffee trading in the American colonies probably had its beginnings\r\nabout the middle of the seventeenth century. Tea seems to have preceded\r\ncoffee as an article of merchandise. Several merchants in the New\r\nEngland and New York settlements imported small quantities of coffee\r\nwith other foodstuffs toward the close of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nThe early supplies of the green bean were brought from the Dutch East\r\nIndies, Arabia, Haiti, and Jamaica. About 1787, the French opened\r\nMauritius and Bourbon to American ships, which then began to bring back\r\ncoffee and tea to the Atlantic-coast cities. Mocha coffee was being\r\nimported direct in American bottoms about 1804. Coffee from Brazil was\r\nfirst imported by the United States in 1809. Central America began\r\nshipping coffee to the United States in 1840. The total coffee imports\r\nin 1876 were 339,789,246 pounds, valued at $56,788,997, and received\r\nchiefly from Brazil, Haiti, British and Dutch East Indies, the West\r\nIndies, and Mexico.\r\n\r\nNew York early became the leading green-coffee market of the country.\r\n\r\nThere was a number of large importing merchants in New York in 1760,\r\nnearly all of whom brought in coffee. Among them were Isaac and Nicholas\r\nGouverneur, Robert Murray, Walter and Samuel Franklin, John and Henry\r\nCruger, the Livingstons, the Beekmans, Lott & Low, Philip Cuyler,\r\nAnthony Van Dam, Hugh and Alexander Wallace, Leonard and Anthony\r\nLispenard, Theophylact Bache, and William Walton.\r\n\r\nSome early green-coffee prices per pound were as follows:\r\n\r\n1683--18s. 9d.; 1743--5s.; 1746--5s.; 1774--9s.; 1781[347]--96s. O.T.;\r\n1782--2s. 1d. O.T.; 1783--1s.; 1789--10 cents.\r\n\r\nLeading New York coffee importers in 1786 were Henry Sheaff, on the dock\r\nbetween Burling Slip and the Fly Market; John Rooney, 26 Cherry Street;\r\nWilliam Eccles, 10 Hunters Key; Ludlow & Goold, 47 Wall Street; Scriba,\r\nSchroppel & Starmen, 17 Queen Street; and William Taylor, Crane Wharf.\r\n\r\nThe wholesale coffee roaster appeared about 1790; and from that time the\r\nseparation between the green-coffee trader and the coffee roaster became\r\nmore marked. In 1794 the principal green-coffee importers in New York\r\nwere: Lawrence & Van Zandt; D. Smith & Co., 323 Pearl Street; Gilchrist\r\nDickinson, 17 Taylor's Wharf; Armstrong & Barnewall, 129 Water Street;\r\nWilliam Bowne, 265 Pearl Street; Stephen Cole & Son, 26 Ferry Street;\r\nJ.S. De Lessert & Co., 123 Front Street; Joseph Thebaud, 262 Pearl\r\nStreet; Nathaniel Cooper & Co., 38 Little Dock Street; Coll. M'Gregor,\r\n28 Wall Street; David Wagstaff, 137 Front Street; Conkling & Lloyd, 15\r\nTaylor's Wharf; and S.B. Garrick, Westphal & Co., 43 Cherry Street.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hermann Sielcken\r\n\r\nB.G. Arnold\r\n\r\nF.B. Arnold\r\n\r\nJoseph Purcell\r\n\r\nSOME DEPARTED DOMINANT FIGURES IN THE NEW YORK GREEN COFFEE TRADE]\r\n\r\nThe leading New York coffee importers in 1848 were Henry and William\r\nDelafield, 108 Front Street; and Des Arts & Henser, 78 Water Street.\r\n\r\nThere were seven leading New York coffee importers in 1854, as follows:\r\nAymar & Co., 34 South Street; Henry Coit & Son, 43 South Street; Henry\r\nDelafield, 129 Pearl Street; Howland & Aspinwall, 54 South Street; Mason\r\n& Thompson, 33 Pearl Street; J.L. Phipps & Co., 19 Cliff Street; and\r\nMoses Taylor & Co., 44 South Street.\r\n\r\nFollowing the so-called \"consortium\" of 1868, the ramifications of which\r\ncentered in Frankfort-on-the-Main--its speculations finally ending in\r\ndisaster to many--the green-coffee trade was in a precarious condition\r\nuntil well into the eighties. \"Previously,\" says a contemporary writer,\r\n\"it had been the safest and prettiest of all colonial produce.\"\r\n\r\nAbout 1868, \"iron steamers began to be freely availed of as carriers of\r\ncoffee; and later on, the telegraph became a factor, rendering the\r\nbusiness more exciting and expensive\".\r\n\r\nCoffee consumption in the United States had, moreover, increased from\r\none pound per capita in 1790 to nine pounds per capita in 1882.\r\n\r\n1892-93 the biggest figure in the world's coffee trade was George\r\nKaltenbach, a German living in Paris, whose resources were estimated at\r\ntwelve million to fifteen million dollars, and whose holdings at one\r\ntime were said to be one million bags. He was reported to have made\r\n$1,500,000 on his coffee corner. In September, 1892, he bested a bull\r\nclique and forced prices down to twelve cents. Aided by three other\r\nEuropean operators, he then started a bull syndicate, and put the price\r\nup to seventeen cents. The story of this corner, and of other notable\r\ncoffee booms and panics, is told in more detail in chapter XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Early Days of the Green Coffee Business_.\r\n\r\nFor a long time New York was the only important entry port for green\r\ncoffee. Before the rise of New Orleans and San Francisco, many inland\r\ncoffee roasters and grocers had their own buyers in the New York market.\r\nThe coffee district that still clings about lower Wall Street is rich in\r\nmemories of by-gone merchants who once were big factors in the trade,\r\nand whose names, in many instances, have been handed down from\r\ngeneration to generation in the businesses that have survived them.\r\n\r\nAny reference to the early days of the green-coffee importing, jobbing,\r\nand brokerage business in New York would not be complete without mention\r\nof a few of the pioneers:\r\n\r\nP.C. Meehan is eighty-four years old at the time of writing (1922) and\r\nis dean of the New York green-coffee trade. With James H. Briggs he\r\nformed the firm of Briggs & Meehan. This later became Meehan & Schramm,\r\nwith Arnold Schramm. The latter withdrew, and the firm became Creighton,\r\nMorrison & Meehan. Finally, Mr. Meehan established the present firm of\r\nP.C. Meehan & Co.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James H. Taylor\r\n\r\nH. Simmonds\r\n\r\nEdwin H. Peck\r\n\r\nP.C. Meehan\r\n\r\nTHEIR ASSOCIATION WITH THE NEW YORK GREEN COFFEE TRADE DATES BACK NEARLY\r\nFIFTY YEARS]\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Schramm withdrew from the firm of Meehan & Schramm he founded\r\nthe house of Arnold Schramm, Inc. Upon his retirement, this was\r\nsucceeded by Sprague & Rhodes, the firm being composed of Benjamin\r\nRhodes and Irvin A. Sprague.\r\n\r\nNext oldest to P.C. Meehan in the New York green-coffee trade is\r\nClarence Creighton, who started with Youngs & Amman, later C. Amman &\r\nCo., then Waite, Creighton & Morrison, then Creighton, Morrison &\r\nMeehan. Upon the breaking up of this firm, Mr. Creighton formed a\r\npartnership with James Ashland, under the name of Creighton & Ashland.\r\nHe later operated alone, and died August 15, 1922.\r\n\r\nJames H. Taylor is another \"old-timer\" who is still active. He began\r\nwith T.T. Barr & Co. Later, with F.T. Sherman, he formed the firm of\r\nSherman & Taylor. When Mr. Sherman withdrew, the firm became James H.\r\nTaylor & Co. Mr. Taylor is now with Minford, Lueder & Co. He has been\r\nfive years president, eleven years treasurer, and twenty-six years on\r\nthe board of governors of the New York Coffee Exchange.\r\n\r\nOne of the most honored names in the green coffee trade of New York is\r\nthat of Peck. Edwin H. Peck began, at the age of seventeen years, with\r\nHart & Howell, butter and cheese merchants. He then went in the same\r\nbusiness for himself. Four years later, he abandoned this to go into the\r\ncoffee brokerage business with his brother, Walter J. Peck. In about\r\nfive years, the brothers branched into the coffee importing and jobbing\r\nbusiness under the firm name of Edwin H. Peck & Co. Later it was changed\r\nto the present style of E.H. & W. J. Peck. Since the death of Walter J.\r\nPeck in 1909, Edwin H. has conducted the business. The latter was a\r\nmember of the board of governors of the New York Coffee Exchange for\r\ntwelve years, and has been an important factor in the upbuilding of that\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nWilliam D. Mackey began with Small Bros. & Co. He then went into\r\npartnership with C.K. Small as Mackey & Small. Later, he formed the firm\r\nof Arnold, Mackey & Co. with Francis B. Arnold. The latter dropped out,\r\nand the firm became Mackey & Co. He is now operating alone. Mr. Mackey\r\nwas another of the incorporators of the New York Coffee Exchange.\r\n\r\nAlexander H. Purcell, a brother of Joseph Purcell, entered the employ of\r\nBowie Dash & Co. as a boy. From there he went to Williams, Russell &\r\nCo., then to the Union Coffee Co., and later to Hard & Rand. He is now\r\nhead of the firm of Alex. H. Purcell & Co.\r\n\r\nRobert C. Stewart first became known with Booth & Linsley. He later went\r\nwith Joseph J. O'Donohue & Sons, leaving there to establish the present\r\nfirm of R.C. Stewart & Co.\r\n\r\nAnother old-timer, Joseph D. Pickslay, may be seen at his desk in\r\nWilliams, Russell & Co.'s office every day, although Frank Williams, who\r\nbegan with Winthrop G. Ray & Co., and Frank C. Russell, both of\r\nWilliams, Chapin & Russell, and then of Williams, Russell & Co., have\r\npassed on. Fred P. Gordon, now head of Fred P. Gordon & Co., was\r\nformerly with Williams, Russell & Co.\r\n\r\nThe Mitchell brothers, William L. and George, forming the firm of\r\nMitchell Bros., have been familiar Front Street figures for many years.\r\n\r\nA. Wakeman, \"the historian of the coffee trade,\" as he is often called,\r\nbegan with Olendorf, Case & Gillespie. Later he went with Thompson &\r\nBowers, and then became a member of the firm of Baiz & Wakeman. He is\r\nnow in business alone. For thirty-eight years Mr. Wakeman has been\r\nsecretary of the Lower Wall Street Business Men's Association. He is the\r\nauthor of _History and Reminiscences of Lower Wall Street and Vicinity_.\r\n\r\nH. Simmonds, of Simmonds & Bayne; later, of Simmonds & Newton; then, of\r\nthe Brazil Coffee Co.; and finally, of H. Simmonds & Co., is at the time\r\nof writing one of the oldest coffee merchants on Front Street, having\r\nbeen in business in Baltimore and New York for more than fifty years. He\r\nhas a desk in the office of his son, W. Lee Simmonds, of W. Lee Simmonds\r\n& Co.\r\n\r\nBayne is another well known Front Street name. The firm of William Bayne\r\n& Co. was established by William Bayne, Sr., in Baltimore. The business\r\nwas moved to New York about 1885. The founder's three sons, William,\r\nJr., Daniel K., and L. P., entered the employ of the firm in Baltimore,\r\nand moved with it to New York.\r\n\r\nDaniel K. Bayne became associated with Henry Sheldon & Co., and later\r\nwas a member of Simmonds & Bayne. He then returned to William Bayne &\r\nCo. and was senior partner at the time of his death in 1915. William\r\nBayne, Jr., for many years one of the governors and a past-president and\r\nvice-president of the New York Coffee Exchange, and his brother, L.P.\r\nBayne, now conduct the business.\r\n\r\nJohn T. Foley, now of the Commercial Coffee Co., began with Kirkland\r\nBros. From there he went to Ezra Wheeler & Co., then to H.W. Banks &\r\nCo., Thompson, Shortridge & Co., and William Hosmer Bennett & Son.\r\n\r\nJoshua Walker formed a partnership with James Stewart as Stewart &\r\nWalker. Since the retirement of Mr. Stewart some years ago, Mr. Walker\r\nhas been in business alone.\r\n\r\nThree other veterans of the trade are still in the harness: Louis\r\nSeligsberg, formerly of Wolf & Seligsberg, is now alone; Henry Schaefer\r\nhas been at the head of S. Gruner & Co. since the death of Siegfried\r\nGruner; Col. William P. Roome, who operated for some time as Wm. P.\r\nRoome & Co., is now head of the coffee department of Acker, Merrall &\r\nCondit Co.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: O.G. Kimball Boston\r\n\r\nJames C. Russell New York\r\n\r\nJames W. Phyfe New York\r\n\r\nC.E. Bickford San Francisco\r\n\r\nGREEN COFFEE TRADE BUILDERS WHO HAVE PASSED ON]\r\n\r\nGregory B. Livierato, who founded the business of Livierato Bros. at\r\nPort Said, with branches at Aden and Marseilles, and later at Hodeida\r\nand Harar, entered the green coffee trade of New York in 1855, although\r\nhis L F Mocha marks had been introduced here many years before. He\r\nremained here for eighteen years, returned to his home in Cephalonia,\r\nGreece, in 1904, and died there in 1905. His nephew, B.A. Livierato,\r\nthen assumed charge of the New York coffee business, which in 1913\r\nbecame the Livierato-Kidde Co., with B.A. Livierato and Frank Kidde.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Green Arnold, one-time \"coffee king,\" first became well known\r\nas a member of Arnold, Sturgess & Co., afterward B.G. Arnold & Co. Mr.\r\nArnold was one of the incorporators, and the first president, of the New\r\nYork Coffee Exchange. Francis B. Arnold, with Arnold, Sturgess & Co.,\r\nlater of Arnold, Mackey & Co., afterward Arnold, Dorr & Co., was a son\r\nof Benjamin Greene Arnold; and to him and to Major John R. McNulty\r\nbelongs a great part of the credit for the organization of the New York\r\nCoffee Exchange. Major McNulty was with Minford, Thompson & Co., and\r\nthen formed the firm of J.R. McNulty & Co.\r\n\r\nBowie Dash, a member of the famous Arnold-Kimball-Dash triumvirate,\r\nbegan with Scott & Meiser, later Scott, Meiser & Co., then Scott & Dash,\r\nafterward Scott, Dash & Co., and finally Bowie Dash & Co. Other well\r\nknown men with this last company were L.F. Mason, A.C. Foster, S.L.\r\nSwazey, L.J. Purdy, and John B. Overton.\r\n\r\nThen there were: Rufus G.

In 1920, juggling the\r\nfigures a little, she imported 767,000,000 pounds, which was fifty-nine\r\npercent of the total. While she was thus practically marking time, she\r\nwatched New Orleans run wild with an increase from 44,000,000 pounds to\r\n380,000,000 pounds, or 763 percent gain; this meaning also the supplying\r\nof twenty-nine percent of the country's demands instead of five percent,\r\nwhile San Francisco in the same time jumped from 24,000,000 pounds to\r\n137,000,000 pounds, or 470 percent gain, her share of the total trade\r\nnow being ten percent instead of three percent in 1900. These gains,\r\nhowever, have not all been made at the expense of the city on the\r\nHudson. In 1900, Baltimore was a close rival of New Orleans and was far\r\nahead of all other ports except New York; but a decline in her imports\r\nbegan about 1903, and was so swift, that five years later her imports\r\nwere almost negligible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOOKING SOUTH FROM WALL STREET INTO THE HEART OF THE\r\nGREEN COFFEE DISTRICT\r\n\r\nOn the left-hand corner is Hard & Rand's, opposite Leon Israel & Bros.'\r\nbuilding, and beyond are many other leading green coffee firms.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOOKING NORTH FROM WALL STREET.

All others fiscal years.\r\n\r\nNew Orleans began her advance at about the same time that Baltimore\r\nbegan to fall off, so that her rise to a place of importance as a coffee\r\nport has been practically coincident with the twentieth century. Her\r\nfirst big step upward was in 1901, from 44,000,000 to 72,000,000 pounds,\r\nand was followed by another the next year to 115,000,000. Thereafter\r\nthere was a steady gain to 213,000,000 pounds in 1906 and to 301,000,000\r\npounds in 1910, and after that wide fluctuations, especially during the\r\nwar. In 1918, doubtless because of the draining of shipping to the North\r\nAtlantic service, there was a heavy slump; but immediately after the\r\nwar, in the calendar year 1919, there was a big jump to a record mark,\r\nup to that time, of 356,000,000 pounds. This was followed by the record\r\nof 380,000,000 pounds in the calendar year 1920, although the 1921\r\nfigure of 331,036,770 shows a falling off of nearly 50,000,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco's growth, on the other hand, is of recent occurrence. The\r\nstory is told farther along in this chapter, how the city was definitely\r\nplaced on the coffee map by the provision of adequate shipping\r\nfacilities to Central America. The outbreak of the war in Europe,\r\nhowever, which loosened the grip of European nations on the coffee crops\r\nof Central America, was the prime cause of San Francisco's rise in the\r\ncoffee world, affording her an opportunity of which she had the\r\nenterprise to take full advantage. In 1913, her imports were only about\r\n36,000,000 pounds, at which mark they had stood for many years. There\r\nwas only a slight gain until 1916, when 71,000,000 pounds were recorded;\r\nbut this increased to 97,000,000 pounds in 1917, to 134,000,000 pounds\r\nin 1918 (fiscal year), and to 160,000,000 pounds in the calendar year\r\n1919. In 1920, there was a falling off to 137,000,000 pounds, and it may\r\nbe that the high figure reached the year before represents about the\r\nmaximum that her natural market, the Pacific-coast region, can well\r\nabsorb.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of those who like to do their own interpreting of\r\nfigures, we present in the table at the top of this page the official\r\nrecord for recent years.\r\n\r\nThe leading importers of Brazil coffee direct to New York and Baltimore\r\nin 1894, as compiled by William H.

In this year, according to Martin's _History of\r\nLouisiana_, New Orleans imported 1438 bags of coffee of 132 pounds each.\r\nIn the latter part of the eighteenth century, settlers in large numbers\r\nhad crossed the Allegheny Mountains from the Atlantic states into the\r\nvalley of the Ohio River; and their crops of grain and provisions were\r\nexported by means of cheaply constructed rafts and boats, which were\r\nfloated down the river to New Orleans, where they were generally broken\r\nup and sold for use as lumber and firewood--there being, at that time,\r\nno power available for propelling them back against the current of the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nFrom 1803 until 1820, on account of the difficulty of navigating\r\nupstream, New Orleans imports did not increase as rapidly as exports. In\r\n1814, however, the first crude steamboat had begun to carry freight on\r\nthe river; and by 1820, the supremacy of New Orleans as the gateway of\r\nthe Mississippi Valley had been for the time established by this new\r\nmeans of transportation. The coffee-importing business flourished; and,\r\nfrom its modest beginning in 1803, grew to 531,236 bags in 1857.\r\n\r\nBy this time, however, New Orleans had begun to feel the competition of\r\nthe Erie Canal, and of the systems of east and west railroad lines which\r\nhad been in the course of active construction during the preceding\r\nfifteen years. The railroad systems which had as their ports Boston, New\r\nYork, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, entered upon a desperate war of\r\nfreight rates, each in the endeavor to establish the supremacy of its\r\nown port. As the building of railroads had been entirely east and west,\r\nand no large amount of capital had been invested in north and south\r\nlines, much of the business of the valley was diverted to the Atlantic\r\nports, apparently never to return to New Orleans.\r\n\r\nIn 1862, on account of the blockade of the port, not a bag of coffee was\r\nimported through New Orleans, and practically none came in until the\r\nyear 1866, when the small amount of 55,000 bags was the total for the\r\nyear. At about this time, Boston and Philadelphia became negligible\r\nimporting quantities; the business of Baltimore continued to be quite\r\nprosperous; and New York rapidly increased her imports and took the\r\ncommanding position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE NEW ORLEANS COFFEE DISTRICT]\r\n\r\nNew Orleans had increased her coffee imports to 250,000 bags in 1871,\r\nand the yearly imports continued at about this figure until the last\r\ndecade of the century, when the business began to expand. The imports\r\nhad reached a total of 337,000 bags in 1893-1894; and of 373,000 in\r\n1896-97. This was the beginning of a new era, and the coffee business of\r\nNew Orleans entered upon the period of its greatest growth. Imports were\r\n514,000 bags in 1900-01, and were slightly more than twice that by\r\n1903-04. In 1909-10 the imports had again doubled, and had reached a\r\ntotal for the twelve months ending July 1, 1909, of slightly more than\r\n2,000,000 bags; while the figures for the calendar year 1909 totaled\r\n2,500,000 bags.\r\n\r\nBorino & Bro., 77 Gravier Street, were the largest importers of coffee\r\nin New Orleans in 1869. The principal importers in 1880 were P. Poursine\r\n& Co., Westfeldt Bros., Dymond & Gardes, Schmidt & Ziegler, J.L. Phipps\r\n& Co., Geo. O. Gordon & Co., and Smith Bros.\r\n\r\nShipments were by sailing vessels, a full cargo being about 5000 bags.\r\nFancy grades, like Golden Rios, washed and peaberries, were shipped in\r\ndouble bags. Musty coffees were common, and every bag in a cargo was\r\nsampled for must. S. Jackson was first to issue regular manifests. With\r\nthe entry of steamers into the coffee transport business, New Orleans\r\nwas placed at a disadvantage as steamer rates were about twenty cents a\r\nbag higher to New Orleans than to New York, and imports were limited.\r\nThe subsequent revival of the business was due largely to Hard & Rand.\r\nBeing unable to obtain steamer rates equal to those quoted in New York,\r\nHard & Rand chartered steamers for New Orleans; and soon the trade began\r\nto offer cost and freight to New Orleans, and the business grew from\r\nabout 350,000 bags of green coffee per annum to 2,500,000 bags.\r\n\r\nOne of the best remembered names in the green coffee trade of New\r\nOrleans is that of Charles Dittman (1848-1920), who for nearly fifty\r\nyears was one of the leading coffee commission merchants of the country.\r\nMr. Dittman entered the coffee business with Napier & Co., representing\r\nE. Johnston & Co., of Rio de Janeiro. In 1875, upon the death of Mr.\r\nNapier, the firm changed to Johnston, Gordon & Co., later to G.O.\r\nGordon, and in 1886 to the Charles Dittmann Co. Since his death in\r\n1920, the business has been continued by F.V. Allain and Charles\r\nDittmann, Jr.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SECTION OF THE GREEN COFFEE DISTRICT OF NEW ORLEANS\r\n\r\nMost of the buildings shown here are occupied by green coffee importing\r\nhouses. The one on the right with the balconies is the old Board of\r\nTrade Building]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Green Coffee in San Francisco_\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the green coffee business in San Francisco these\r\nnames stood out as most important among the coffee importers: Hellmann\r\nBros. & Co., Montealegre & Co., E.L.G.S. Steele & Co., and Urruella &\r\nUrioste.\r\n\r\nFrom their many friends in Central America, they, and others in their\r\nline, obtained small consignments that were bought by the roasters\r\naccording to their immediate needs. Often as many as five or six buyers\r\nwould share in a parcel of fifty bags, as they were not in the custom of\r\nfilling up the larder for days of want. There always seemed to be\r\nsufficient for every one, and bull movements and corners had not then\r\nbecome the vogue.\r\n\r\nJust as today, the mainstays of the early San Francisco trade were\r\ncoffees produced in Costa Rica, Salvador, and Guatemala, although some\r\nwere brought from the Colima district of Mexico. The broker had a\r\ncomparatively easy job in selling his wares. Samples of the lots would\r\nbe given to him in carefully sealed glass bottles, and usually the buyer\r\nwould trust his discerning eye to judge correctly the quality of the\r\ngoods, not even taking the trouble to uncork the bottle. Size, color,\r\nand imperfections would be his criterion.\r\n\r\nThe leading coffee importers at San Francisco in 1875 were B.E. Auger &\r\nCo., 409 Battery; S.A. Carit & Co., 405 Front Street; Hellmann Bros. &\r\nCo., 525 Front Street; Adolphe Low & Co., 208 California Street; S.C.\r\nMerrill & Co., 204 California Street; Parrott & Co., 306 California\r\nStreet; and Urruella & Urioste, 405 Front Street.\r\n\r\nThe annual consumption of green coffee in San Francisco in the early\r\neighties was estimated at 100,000 bags.\r\n\r\nA marked change in the coffee business of San Francisco was brought\r\nabout by the discovery that the differences in the taste of coffees\r\ncould not be accurately detected from their color or from the size of\r\nbean. To Clarence E. Bickford belongs the credit of having discovered\r\nthe cup qualities of high-grown Central American coffees. He was\r\nemployed at the time by a broker named Hockhofler, and probably did not\r\nrealize what far-reaching effect his discovery would have on the future\r\nof San Francisco's coffee trade; but no other factor has contributed so\r\nmuch to its growth. When the roasters began to examine coffees for their\r\ntaste, values were of course revolutionized. Antiguas, and other\r\nhigh-grown coffees, that had theretofore been penalized for the small\r\nsize of bean, soon brought a premium, and have ever since been in great\r\ndemand. It goes without saying that the new classification was of\r\nmaterial assistance to the roasters in bettering their output, as\r\nblending was then put on a scientific basis.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the nineties San Francisco began to function as a\r\ndistributing center, and shipments were made from there to St. Louis and\r\nCincinnati. The selection of coffees on their cup merit was undoubtedly\r\na factor of considerable importance in creating new outlets; although it\r\nis generally conceded that the winning personality of C.E. Bickford\r\nhelped considerably. Mr. Bickford, by this time, had succeeded his\r\nformer employer. He served the trade by living up to the best standards\r\nof business practise until his death in 1908; when the institution he\r\nfounded was continued by E.H. O'Brien under the name of C.E. Bickford &\r\nCo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALIFORNIA STREET, THE COFFEE-TRADING CENTER OF SAN\r\nFRANCISCO]\r\n\r\nSan Francisco imported 175,293 bags of coffee in 1900. Imports had grown\r\nto 256,183 bags by 1906; and the following were the leading importers,\r\nas taken from a compilation by C.E.

The beginning of the World War was almost\r\ncoincidental with an energetic campaign waged by San Francisco coffee\r\ninterests to popularize Central American coffees, and particularly\r\nGuatemalas, in this country. The time was well chosen, as the world's\r\nexposition at San Francisco offered a good opportunity to acquaint the\r\npublic with the fine qualities of Guatemala growths. Furthermore, it was\r\nnecessary to create new markets for these coffees, which in former years\r\nhad been very extensively used in Europe. Figures show that San\r\nFrancisco's efforts were crowned with success. In 1916, the importation\r\nincreased by fifty percent; and in 1917, importations were double those\r\nof 1915. In 1918, a total of nearly 1,000,000 bags was reached; and this\r\nmark was passed by almost 200,000 in 1919. In 1920, 971,567 bags were\r\nimported.\r\n\r\nThe origin of San Francisco's fight for control of Central American\r\ncoffee dates back to the years 1908 to 1910, when the German Kosmos Line\r\nwas fighting the Pacific Mail for the Central and South American\r\nshipping business. W.R. Grace & Co., at that time, were already the\r\nheaviest shippers of American merchandise to the Latin-American\r\ncountries; and while their own steamers were not touching at Central\r\nAmerican ports, they were handling merchandise from the United States\r\nand nitrates from the South American countries in their own bottoms, and\r\nwere also engaged as general carriers for that trade. The fight directed\r\nby the Kosmos Line against the Pacific Mail, which at that time was\r\nunder the control of the Southern Pacific Company, was accordingly\r\ndirected against the Grace interests also, so far as South American\r\ncountries were concerned. The fight was long and bitter, and costly to\r\nboth sides. At times, the contenders offered to take freight, not only\r\nwithout charge, but to pay the shipper a premium for the privilege of\r\ncarrying his freight.\r\n\r\nDifferences were finally settled in conference; but the experience\r\ntaught the American interests that they could survive in any territory\r\nonly if at all times they were able to provide their own cargoes for\r\ntheir own boats, as had been accomplished with nitrate in South America.\r\nJ.H. Rosseter, the Grace manager, who later became well known as\r\ndirector of operations of the United States Shipping Board during the\r\nwar, undertook an extended trip to Central America in 1912 to study the\r\nsituation at close range. There was only one product of Central America\r\nthat was available in cargo quantities, namely coffee; and naturally his\r\nattention was drawn to the possibility of carrying coffee to San\r\nFrancisco to provide return cargoes for ships of the Pacific Mail, or\r\nassociated lines, carrying merchandise for the Central American\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nWhile in Guatemala, Mr. Rosseter outlined a future policy in regard to\r\nCentral American coffees; the basis being his firm determination that\r\ncoffees grown in Central America, and logically and geographically\r\ntributary to San Francisco distribution, should come to San Francisco in\r\nlargely increasing quantities.\r\n\r\nUp to that time San Francisco had received, on an average, only 200,000\r\nbags of Central American coffee annually for the ten preceding years;\r\nwhile Europe had received about 1,500,000 bags a year. The quantity\r\nnecessary to make San Francisco a factor would call for an importation,\r\non an average, of 750,000 bags--a quantity almost four times as large as\r\nthen established.\r\n\r\nThis was an extremely ambitious undertaking, considering the conditions\r\nthen prevailing in Central America. European countries were firmly\r\nentrenched in the coffee business in Central America, with Germany\r\nleading in Guatemala, France in Salvador and Nicaragua, England and\r\nFrance contending for superiority in Costa Rica, and the United States\r\ngetting only the leavings.\r\n\r\nThe European countries held their position in the Central American\r\nCoffee trade by liberal financing, and a thorough knowledge of the\r\nvarying qualities of coffee produced on the different plantations. San\r\nFrancisco, the only important port in the United States dealing in\r\nCentral American coffees, had neither strong financial entrenchment in\r\nCentral America nor expert knowledge of coffee quality. Year after year,\r\nSan Francisco merchants had depended on consignments chosen by the\r\nconsignors. This rendered quality selection of coffees by the importers\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nRosseter, being primarily a steamship man, tackled the proposition from\r\nthe standpoint of transportation, figuring that if he could establish\r\nand maintain preferential steamer service to San Francisco, and steady\r\nfreight rates, a great step would be accomplished toward the desired\r\nend. This led to his interest in the Pacific Mail Company, of which the\r\nfinal outcome was his present position as vice-president of the\r\nreorganized Pacific Mail Company. In that capacity he maintained,\r\npractically throughout the entire period of the World War, freight rates\r\non coffee from Central America to San Francisco that gave that Pacific\r\nport an immediate and definite advantage.\r\n\r\nThis gave merchants in San Francisco the chance to build up a steady\r\ntrade, and prevented other ports in the United States from entering into\r\nserious competition with San Francisco as a distributing point for\r\nCentral American coffees. The view taken by Rosseter was as far-sighted\r\nas it was broad. He argued that with the end of the war there would be\r\nno strength in a scattering distribution of Central American coffees by\r\nNew York, New Orleans, and San Francisco; and the only promise of\r\nmaintenance of the business for the United States would be in\r\nmaintaining unity of distribution in one port of the United States,\r\nnamely San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe first year open to European competition after the war showed that\r\nSan Francisco was well able to maintain its lead in Central American\r\ncoffees. Today, the mortgages formerly held by European merchants on the\r\nnative coffee plantations, and the control thereby of the produce of\r\nthese plantations, are in the hands of American merchants; and what is\r\nmore, out of general merchandising and importing by merchants of San\r\nFrancisco there have developed expert coffee departments in all of the\r\nlarger houses. The years of the war brought the product of virtually all\r\nplantations in Central America to the intimate knowledge of these expert\r\ncoffee departments; and today the advantage that Europe formerly had--of\r\nknowing exactly what a specific plantation produced--is possessed by\r\nSan Francisco merchants.\r\n\r\nThis is no small advantage when we consider that in Guatemala and Costa\r\nRica, qualities vary from plantation to plantation, and that often on\r\nadjoining plantations there is from three to five cents a pound\r\ndifference in quality, from the standpoint of cup merit.\r\n\r\nOne can not buy coffee in Central America as in Brazil, as these\r\ncountries are not highly organized commercially, and the importers here\r\nare forced to assume the rôle of the Brazilian _commisario_ and banker.\r\nThe crop has to be financed from six to nine months before it is brought\r\nto the port; and the securities covering such advances are at best of\r\nquestionable value, on account of political insecurity, and the\r\never-threatening earthquakes, and the uncertainty of the elements.\r\nDistribution of the coffee after it has been brought to San Francisco\r\nalso involves many difficulties, notwithstanding that the demand is\r\ngood. This will be better realized when we consider that the Pacific\r\ncoast, from Alaska to Mexico, and eastward as far as the Rocky\r\nMountains, embraces a population of about 8,000,000, whose annual\r\nconsumption is estimated at 400,000 bags; and that, as already stated,\r\ntreble that quantity was imported to San Francisco in 1919.\r\n\r\nIn 1900, ninety-nine firms were engaged in the green coffee importing\r\nbusiness (some were roasters also) in New York; six in Philadelphia;\r\ntwenty-eight in San Francisco; twelve in New Orleans. In 1920, there\r\nwere two hundred and sixteen in New York; thirty-one in San Francisco;\r\nfifteen in New Orleans.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Green Coffee Trade Organizations_\r\n\r\nPrevious to the organization of the roasters, the only kind of coffee\r\norganization in this country of more than local importance was the New\r\nYork Coffee Exchange, which came into existence in 1881, the\r\norganization meeting being held in the offices of B.G. Arnold & Co., at\r\n166 Pearl Street, New York. The Exchange was incorporated December 7,\r\n1881, the incorporators being Benjamin Green Arnold, Francis B. Arnold,\r\nWilliam D. Mackey, John S. Wright, William Sorley, Joseph A. O'Brien, H.\r\nClay Maddux, C. McCulloch Beecher, Geo. W. Flanders, and John R.\r\nMcNulty. B.G. Arnold was the first president. Soon afterward, rooms were\r\nrented and fitted up for trading purposes at 135 Pearl Street, at the\r\njunction of Beaver and Pearl Streets, and only two blocks away from the\r\nmore pretentious structure now housing the Coffee Exchange. Actual\r\ntrading operations did not begin until March 7, 1882.\r\n\r\nThe New York Coffee Exchange was the world's first coffee-trade\r\norganization of national proportions. Havre's exchange was inaugurated\r\nin 1882, under the name of the Coffee Terminal Market. Five years later,\r\ncoffee exchanges were opened in Amsterdam and Hamburg; while the\r\nexchanges of London, Antwerp, and Rotterdam did not come into existence\r\nuntil the year 1890. The exchange in Trieste, Italy, was organized in\r\n1905; while the Coffee Trade Association of London was started in 1916.\r\nThe first exchange in Santos was started in 1914.\r\n\r\nThe success of the New York Coffee Exchange led to its imitation in\r\nother coffee ports of the United States. Baltimore started a similar\r\norganization, early in 1883, under the name of the Baltimore Coffee\r\nExchange; but after a short existence, it petered out. New Orleans\r\norganized a green coffee trading association in 1889, as a coffee\r\ncommittee of the Board of Trade. It is still active. The Green Coffee\r\nAssociation of New Orleans, Inc., which is distinct from the Coffee\r\nCommittee, was established January 7, 1920. San Francisco did not have a\r\ntrading exchange until 1918, in which year the Green Coffee Association\r\nof the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce began operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Growth of the Coffee-Roasting Trade_\r\n\r\nThe wholesale coffee roasting business in the United States seems to\r\nhave started in the closing years of the eighteenth century. In\r\nFebruary, 1790, a \"new coffee manufactory\" began business at 4 Great\r\nDock Street, New York, and the proprietor announced that he had provided\r\nhimself at considerable expense with the proper utensils \"to burn, grind\r\nand classify coffee on the European plan.\" He sold the freshly roasted\r\nproduct \"in pots of various sizes from one to twenty weight, well packed\r\ndown, either for sea or family use so as to keep good for twelve\r\nmonths.\"\r\n\r\nA second roasting plant started up at 232 Queen Street, New York, nearly\r\nopposite the governor's house, toward the close of 1790. This second\r\ncoffee roasting plant was known in 1794 as the City Coffee Works. James\r\nThompson operated a \"coffee manufactory\" at 25 Thames Street in 1795. In\r\nthis year there was also the \"Old Ground Coffee Works\" in Pearl Street,\r\nformerly Hanover Square, \"three doors below the bank at number 110,\"\r\noperating \"two mills, one pair French burr stones\" but no orders were\r\naccepted here for less than six pounds, at \"two pence advanced from the\r\nroasting loss.\"\r\n\r\nOther coffee manufactories followed in the large towns of the new\r\nstates; and, always, the coffee was treated \"on the European plan.\" This\r\nmeant that it was \"burnt over a slow coal fire, making every grain a\r\ncopper color and ridding it all of dust and chaff.\" There was usually a\r\ndifference in price of three to four pence a pound between the green and\r\nroasted product. Packages of roasted coffee under the half-dozen weight\r\nwere sold in New York in 1791 for two shillings and three pence per\r\npound, allowance being made for grocers at a distance. In those days,\r\nthe favorite container was a narrow-mouthed pot or jar of any size. This\r\nwas the first crude coffee package. In retailing the product,\r\ncornucopias made of newspapers, or any other convenient wrapping, were\r\nfirst employed; but, with the introduction of paper bags in the early\r\nsixties, the housekeeper soon became educated to this more sanitary form\r\nof carry package, and its permanence was quickly assured.\r\n\r\nThe following were listed in Longworth's _Almanack_ as coffee roasters\r\nin New York in 1805: John Applegate; Cornelius Cooper; Benjamin Cutler,\r\n104 Division Street; George Defendorf, 83 Chapel Street; William Green;\r\nCornelius Hassey, 14 Augustus Street; Joseph M'Ginley, 28 Moore Street;\r\nJohn W. Shaw, 43 Oliver Street; John Sweeney, Mulberry Street; Patience\r\nThompson, 23 Thames Street.\r\n\r\nElijah Withington came from Boston to New York in 1814. He set up a\r\ncoffee roaster in an alley behind the City Hall and engaged a big,\r\nraw-boned Irishman to run it. This was the beginning of a coffee\r\nroasting business that has continued until the present day. Withington\r\ndealt in Padang interiors, Jamaica, and West Indian coffees, and\r\nnumbered many society folk among his customers. Withington's business\r\nremoved to 7 Dutch Street in 1829: and the firm became Withington & Pine\r\nin 1830.\r\n\r\nThe roasted coffee business in New York had grown to such proportions in\r\n1833 and gave such promise, that James Wild considered it a good\r\ninvestment to bring over from England for his new coffee manufactory in\r\nNew York a complete power machinery equipment for roasting and grinding\r\ncoffee. There was also an engine to run it. It was set up in Wooster\r\nStreet opposite the present Washington Square.\r\n\r\nSamuel Wilde, son of Joseph Wilde, of Dorchester, Mass., came to New\r\nYork about 1840 to make his fortune. He was a young man with vision; and\r\nfirst applied himself with diligence to the hardware and looking-glass\r\nbusiness. When he found that most of his customers were theaters and\r\nsaloons, his religious scruples bade him abandon it, which he did.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in 1844, Withington's pioneer roasting enterprise had\r\nadmitted Norman Francis and Amos S. Welch as general partners, and\r\nSamuel and Charles C. Colgate as special partners, under the style of\r\nWithington, Francis & Welch. It so continued until 1848, when Samuel\r\nWilde--who had selected the coffee business as more honorable than the\r\none in which he started--was admitted, and the firm became Withington &\r\nWilde.\r\n\r\nMr. Withington retired in 1851, and Samuel Wilde associated with him in\r\nthe business his sons Joseph and Samuel, Jr., the title becoming Samuel\r\nWilde & Sons. Samuel Wilde, Sr., died in 1862. The title then became\r\nSamuel Wilde's Sons. Joseph Wilde died in 1878, and Samuel Wilde, Jr. in\r\n1890, the business being left to and continuing with a younger brother,\r\nJohn, from 1878 to 1894, when John's son, Herbert W. Wilde, became a\r\nmember of the firm, which continues the old title at 466 Greenwich\r\nStreet, as Samuel Wilde's Sons Company, having been incorporated in\r\n1902. John Wilde died in 1914.\r\n\r\nAnother grandson of Samuel Wilde is William B. Harris, who engaged in\r\nthe coffee roasting business in Front Street from 1904 to 1917. From\r\n1908 to 1918 he acted as coffee expert for the United States Department\r\nof Agriculture. William B. Harris is a son of Samuel L. Harris, who\r\nmarried a daughter of Samuel Wilde, and who for a number of years was\r\nconnected with Samuel Wilde's Sons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIONEERS IN THE ROASTED COFFEE BUSINESS OF NEW YORK CITY\r\n\r\nWith approximate dates of their entry into the trade]\r\n\r\nAlthough a number of roasters and grinders for family use were patented\r\nin the United States in the first half of the nineteenth century, the\r\ncoffee merchants depended almost entirely on English manufacturers for\r\ntheir wholesale equipment until 1846, when James W. Carter of Boston\r\nbrought out his \"pull-out\" roaster. This machine, and others like it,\r\nencouraged the development of the coffee-roasting business, so that when\r\nthe Civil War came, coffee manufactories were well scattered over the\r\ncountry. The demand for something better in coffee-machinery equipment\r\nwas answered by Jabez Burns with his machine for filling and discharging\r\nwithout moving the roasting cylinder from the fire.\r\n\r\nAmong the early grocery concerns in New York that were also coffee\r\nroasters were: R.C. Williams & Co., starting as Mott & Williams in 1811,\r\nchanging to R.S. Williams & Co. in 1821, to Williams & Potter in 1851,\r\nand to its present title in 1882; Acker, Merrall & Condit Co., founded\r\nin 1820; Park & Tilford, founded in 1840; Austin, Nichols & Co., founded\r\nin 1855; and Francis H. Leggett & Co., founded in 1870.\r\n\r\nThere were twenty-one \"coffee roasters and spice factors\" in New York in\r\n1848. Among them were: Beard & Cummings. 281 Front Street; Henry B.\r\nBlair, 129 Washington Street; Colgate Gilbert, 93 Fulton Street; Wright\r\nGillies, 236 Washington Street; and Withington, Wilde & Welch, 7 Dutch\r\nStreet. In this year, two coffee importers, fourteen tea importers, and\r\nforty-one tea dealers were listed in the _City Directory_.\r\n\r\nThe _Directory_ for 1854 listed twenty-seven coffee roasters and spice\r\nfactors, among them, in addition to the above, being Peter Haulenbeek,\r\n328 Washington Street; Levi Rowley, 102 West Street; William J. Stitt,\r\n159 Washington Street; and George W. Wright, 79 Front Street. In those\r\ndays not all the wholesale coffee factors were roasters; there was much\r\ntrade roasting by a few large plants.\r\n\r\nWhile the coffee-roasting business of Samuel Wilde's Sons appears to be\r\nthe oldest in New York, having descended in a practically unbroken line\r\nfrom 1814, several others continued considerably past the half-century\r\nmark, and among them special mention should be accorded to: Levi\r\nRowley's Star Mills, dating back to 1823; Beard & Cummings, 1834; Wright\r\nGillies & Bro., 1840; Loudon & Son, the Metropolitan Mills, 1853; and\r\nthe Eppens Smith Co., present day successors of Thomas Reid's Globe\r\nMills of 1855.\r\n\r\nThe Star Mills in Duane Street became a real factor in the wholesale\r\ncoffee-roasting business on Manhattan Island about 1823. At a later\r\ndate, Levi Rowley secured control, and under his able direction the\r\nbusiness flourished. Benedict & Gaffney bought the Star Mills from\r\nRowley in 1885. A few years later the firm became Benedict & Thomas,\r\nthen Thomas & Turner, and finally the R.G. Thomas Co. R.G. Thomas sold\r\nthe equipment in 1920, ending the manufacturing end of the business just\r\nabout a century from the time it started. Mr. Thomas is now with Russell\r\n& Co. Before being identified with the Star Mills, he was for twenty\r\nyears with Packard & James, 123 Maiden Lane.\r\n\r\nWhile still a lad of nineteen, Wright Gillies came from a Newburgh farm\r\nin 1838, and obtained a clerkship in a tea store in Chatham Street, now\r\nChambers and Duane Street. He branched out for himself in the tea and\r\ncoffee business at 232 Washington Street in 1840, removing in 1843 to\r\n236, which had a courtyard where he installed a horse-power coffee\r\nroaster. In the same building, over the store, lived Thomas McNell and\r\nhis wife. Mr. McNell afterward became a member of the firm of Smith &\r\nMcNell, proprietors of the Washington Street hotel and restaurant, for\r\nmany years one of New York City's landmarks.\r\n\r\nThe coffee business, thus started by Wright Gillies, is still conducted,\r\nas the Gillies Coffee Co., by the same family and at practically the\r\nsame location; and it is interesting to note that the roasting room\r\nstill has the original arrangement, partly below the street level but\r\nwith the machinery in view from the sidewalk. This arrangement was\r\ncharacteristic of the old roasting establishments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROUP OF OLD-TIME NEW YORK COFFEE ROASTERS, 1892\r\n\r\nStanding, left to right, W.H. Eppens, Fred Reid, unknown, Julius A.\r\nEppens, Fred Eppens. Seated, left to right, John F. Pupke, Thomas Reid,\r\nHenry Mayo, Fred Akers, Alexander Kirkland]\r\n\r\nJames W. Gillies, a younger brother, came from Newburgh in 1848 to\r\nassist in the enterprise. Young Gillies superintended the horse-power\r\nroaster and drove the light spring delivery cart. Soon the firm became\r\nWright Gillies & Bro. Fires visited the business in 1849 and in 1858;\r\nbut each time it arose the stronger for the experience. Wright Gillies\r\nretired in 1884, and James W. Gillies assumed entire charge under the\r\nname of the Gillies Coffee Co. He continued active until his death in\r\n1899. The business was incorporated by his children under the same name\r\nin 1906.\r\n\r\nEdwin J. Gillies, son of James W. Gillies, started a separate coffee\r\nbusiness at 245 Washington Street, in 1882. In 1883 he admitted as a\r\npartner James H. Schmelzel, a fellow Columbia alumnus. The enterprise\r\nwas successful for many years, being incorporated under the title of\r\nEdwin J. Gillies & Co., Inc. It was consolidated in 1915 with the\r\nbusiness of Ross W. Weir & Co., 60 Front Street, Edwin J. Gillies\r\nbecoming a vice-president (with L. S. Cooper also vice-president) of the\r\ncorporation of Ross W. Weir, Inc.\r\n\r\nBurns & Brown started in the coffee roasting business in 1853 in an old\r\nbuilding at the corner of Washington and Chambers Streets for which they\r\npaid an annual rental of one thousand dollars. This was the beginning of\r\nthe Metropolitan Mills, opposite to the present location of Loudon &\r\nSon, 181 Chambers Street, the latest successors to the business. Burns &\r\nBrown continued for two years, when they failed, and Wright Gillies &\r\nBro. succeeded, and put in Ebenezer Welsh as manager. Later, Wright\r\nGillies & Co. sold out the plant to Capt. Edward C. Russell, who\r\nassociated with him his son-in-law, Edward A. Phelps, Jr. At the\r\ndissolution of this partnership in 1870, the firm became Trusdell &\r\nPhelps. Mr. Phelps succeeded Trusdell, and sold out to Loudon & Stellwag\r\nin 1877. They were succeeded by Loudon & Johnson in 1879, and this firm\r\ncontinued until 1910, when James D. Johnson retired, and the firm of\r\nLoudon & Son took charge. These were J. Carlyle Loudon and his son,\r\nHoward C. Loudon, who died in 1911. The firm name of Loudon & Son\r\ncontinues.\r\n\r\nOne of the most vigorous personalities of the sixties, and one whose\r\ninfluence extended well into this generation, was Thomas Reid. Born in\r\nBridgeport, England, he came to the United States as a boy, and started\r\nhis business career as a grocer's clerk in Brooklyn. Within three months\r\nafter landing, he bought out his employer. He entered the wholesale\r\ncoffee-roasting business at 105 Murray Street, New York, in 1855, in\r\npartnership with a Mr. Townsend under the style of the Globe Mills,\r\nwhich were the predecessors of the Eppens Smith Co. now in Warren\r\nStreet. Jabez Burns, inventor of the Burns coffee roaster, before this a\r\nteamster for Henry Blair, was at one time bookkeeper for the Globe\r\nMills. In 1864, Mr. Burns sold to the Globe Mills the first roasters of\r\nhis manufacture--two one-bag, four-foot machines that were given a place\r\nalongside of four of the old-style Carter pull-outs.\r\n\r\nMr. Townsend died the first year of the Globe Mills' existence; and\r\nThomas Reid continued without a partner until 1863, when he became\r\nassociated with John F. Pupke, as Pupke & Reid. The business was then at\r\n269 Washington Street. Thomas Reid was resourceful and enterprising;\r\nalso he had vision. He saw the day of package coffee coming, and nearly\r\n\"beat\" John Arbuckle to it. As early as 1861 we find him advertising in\r\nthe _City Directory_, \"spices put up in every variety of package.\"\r\n\r\nLewis A. Osborn, 69 Warren Street, New York, and 81-83 South Water\r\nStreet, Chicago, was advertising \"Osborn's Celebrated Prepared Java\r\nCoffee--put up only by Lewis A. Osborn\" in 1863-64. Thomas Reid appears\r\nto have acquired this brand and to have begun its exploitation as\r\n\"Osborn's Old Government Java,\" a ground package coffee, and certainly\r\none of the earliest package coffees. However, this brand never attained\r\nthe national vogue achieved by John Arbuckle's package coffee, which\r\nfirst appeared in 1865, although the name Ariosa was not given it until\r\n1873.\r\n\r\nBetween 1855 and 1865 there were only half-a-dozen wholesale coffee\r\nroasters on Manhattan Island, and Thomas Reid was their leader. Much of\r\nhis work was roasting for the trade, and this undoubtedly interfered\r\nwith the logical development of his package-coffee ideas.\r\n\r\nThe firm became Pupke, Reid & Phelps in 1882. In 1885, it became the\r\noriginal Eppens-Smith Co.; later, the Eppens, Smith & Wiemann Co., and\r\nlastly, the Eppens Smith Co. Thomas Reid was vice-president of the\r\nEppens, Smith & Wiemann Co., and continued in that position until his\r\ndeath in 1902. Julius Eppens is the present head of the business.\r\n\r\nOther package coffees of the sixties were Government coffee put out by\r\nTaber & Place's Rubia Mills, 353-355 Washington Street, in \"tin foil\r\npound papers,\" and L. Bruckmann & Co.'s London Club, packed at 107\r\nWarren Street.\r\n\r\nAnother old-time New York coffee-roasting business is that of Samuel S.\r\nBeard & Co. This business was founded in 1834 on Front Street by Eli\r\nBeard (father of Samuel S. Beard,) and W.A. Cummings as Beard &\r\nCummings. In 1872, the firm moved to Duane Street, where it was joined\r\nby Messrs. S.S. Beard and Cottrell, and the new firm became Beards &\r\nCottrell. Mr. Cottrell retired in 1883, and the firm became Samuel S.\r\nBeard & Co. Upon the death of S.S. Beard in 1905, James H. Murray, who\r\nhad been with the concern for many years, became head of the house. Mr.\r\nMurray died six months later. The business moved in 1913 to 92 Front\r\nStreet, where it continues as a stock company, with J.R. Westfal as\r\nmanager.\r\n\r\nAustin C. Fitzpatrick, well known among New York coffee roasters, is a\r\ngraduate of the Thomas Reid school, having entered the business of this\r\npioneer roaster in 1865. He was western salesman for Pupke & Reid until\r\n1871, when he became associated with Rufus G. Story under the firm name\r\nof R. G. Story & Co. Later, he formed a partnership with Howard E. Case,\r\nbuying out the old house of Beard & Howell. When Mr. Case retired in\r\n1887, the firm became A.C. Fitzpatrick & Co. This title continued for\r\ntwelve years, when the Knickerbocker Mills were taken over, and the\r\nbusiness was incorporated as the Knickerbocker Mills Co., with Mr.\r\nFitzpatrick as president. The Knickerbocker Mills, acquired by the\r\ncorporation, had been founded in 1842 and were for more than forty years\r\nat 154-156 Chambers Street. The business is now at 196-198 Chambers\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JULIUS A. EPPENS, NEW YORK]\r\n\r\nMany of the pioneers in the coffee roasting business of this country\r\nwere men who came from the British Isles and Germany. A notable figure\r\nfrom the latter country was Benedickt Fischer, who knew coffee in\r\nGermany before coming to New York in his nineteenth year. He started at\r\n323-329 Greenwich Street, near Duane Street, in 1859. His first roaster\r\nwas a primitive affair built under the E.J. Hyde patent by the Coffee\r\nRoaster & Mill Manufacturing Co. of Philadelphia. It was turned by hand\r\nby Fischer and his helper. This was about 1862. In 1864, the business\r\nrequired larger quarters, and was removed to the corner of Duane and\r\nGreenwich Streets. A new plant was erected at the corner of Beach and\r\nGreenwich Streets in 1894, and the present plant was erected at the\r\ncorner of Franklin and Greenwich Streets in 1906. Upon the death of\r\nBenedickt Fischer in 1903, the business passed under the control of\r\nWilliam H. Fischer, son of Benedickt, and Benedickt's son-in-law,\r\nCharles E. Diefenthaler, for many years associated with the house. At\r\npresent, the company is a corporation, with C.E. Diefenthaler,\r\npresident; T.F. Diefenthaler, vice-president and treasurer; and T.O.\r\nBudenbach, secretary.\r\n\r\nBowie Dash, a commanding figure in the New York green coffee trade,\r\nfounded the Holland Coffee Co., roasters, in 1885. He placed H. Bartow\r\nin charge. Mr. Dash himself was never active in the affairs of the\r\ncompany. J. Bowie Dash, son of Bowie Dash, entered the Holland Coffee\r\nCo. as a boy. Bowie Dash died in 1894. Mr. Bartow left The Holland\r\nCoffee Co. in 1897 and J. Bowie Dash became president. He sold the\r\ncompany in 1917 to S.B. Morrison, who consolidated it with his Esperanza\r\nCoffee Co. The business is still conducted as the Holland Coffee Co.,\r\nwith Mr. Morrison as president, at 162 Front Street.\r\n\r\nGeorge Fisher was a well known coffee roaster of the sixties. He began\r\nin the old Hope Mills, 71 Fulton Street, and, at the age of thirty,\r\nentered into partnership with D.C. Ripley, establishing the Hudson\r\nMills. The firm became Sanger, Beers & Fisher in 1868; Mr. Fisher\r\nretired in 1882; and died in 1896.\r\n\r\nPeter Haulenbeek began work as delivery boy in a grocery store. He\r\nentered the coffee business in the sixties in the employ of Wright\r\nGillies, and went into the wholesale coffee-roasting trade under his own\r\nname at 170 Duane Street in 1876. His son, John W. Haulenbeek, Sr., came\r\ninto his father's business in 1887. Peter Haulenbeek died January 15,\r\n1894, and the firm name was changed to John W. Haulenbeek & Co. The\r\nbusiness remained in the same building up to 1916, when it was moved to\r\nits present location at 393 Greenwich Street. John W. Haulenbeek, Jr.,\r\nof the third generation, is now active in the business.\r\n\r\nA leading figure in the sixties was James Brown, who started as an\r\nengineer, rose to a partnership, and retired after the Civil War, a\r\nwealthy man. He was a partner with Thomas Reid in the old Globe Mills.\r\nHe was also associated with B. Fischer in the firm of Fischer, Kirby &\r\nBrown, and established the firm of Brown & Scott in Duane Street, where\r\nPeter Haulenbeek succeeded to the business. Afterward, he continued in\r\nthe firms of Brown & Jones and Bisland & Brown, and died in 1898.\r\n\r\nVan Loan, Maguire & Gaffney was a formidable combination in the\r\ncoffee-roasting business in its day. Thomas Van Loan was for thirty\r\nyears a partner in the firm of W.J. Stitt & Co. (William J. Stitt was in\r\nbusiness at 173 Washington Street in the fifties). Joseph Maguire was a\r\npractical spice grinder. Hugh Gaffney was with Brown & Scott until the\r\nfirm retired in 1879, and for ten years thereafter he traveled for B.\r\nFischer & Co. Then he became a member of the firm of Benedict &\r\nGaffney. Ill health caused his temporary retirement; but he returned to\r\nthe business in 1897 when he organized the firm of Van Loan, Maguire &\r\nGaffney. Joseph Maguire died in 1904.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS VAN LOAN, NEW YORK]\r\n\r\nMr. Gaffney died on March 20, 1912, and the name of the business was\r\nchanged to Van Loan & Co., with Thomas Van Loan as the head of the\r\nbusiness, under which name and management it still continues at 64 North\r\nMoore Street.\r\n\r\nO'Donohue is a well known name in the development of both the green and\r\nroasted coffee trade of New York City. John O'Donohue was a leader in\r\nthe green coffee business in 1830. It was John O'Donohue's Sons in 1873.\r\nJohn B. O'Donohue, son of Peter O'Donohue and grandson of the original\r\nJohn, after leaving John O'Donohue's Sons, formed a partnership with\r\nRobert C. Stewart (the present head of R.C. Stewart & Co.) to engage in\r\nthe green coffee jobbing business as O'Donohue & Stewart. This\r\npartnership was dissolved in 1893. For a few years, John O'Donohue was\r\nassociated with the coffee-roasting firm of Wing Bros. & Hart. About\r\n1898, he formed the O'Donohue Coffee Co. at 284 Front Street. In 1910,\r\nthis was consolidated with the Potter Coffee Co. and Bennett, Sloan &\r\nCo. to form the Potter, Sloan, O'Donohue Co. The firm dissolved in 1915.\r\nEllis M. Potter came to New York from the Potter-Parlin Spice Mills in\r\nCincinnati. Mr. O'Donohue died in 1918.\r\n\r\nIn the seventies Frederick Akers was proprietor of the oldest and best\r\nknown trade roasting establishment in New York. The plant was known as\r\nthe Atlas Mills, and was at 17 Jay Street. Mr. Akers died in 1901. The\r\nsame year, William J. Morrison and Walter B. Boinest, former employees\r\nof Akers, formed a partnership to carry on the same kind of business at\r\n413 Greenwich Street. It is still at that address under the name of\r\nMorrison & Boinest Co.\r\n\r\nCol. William P. Roome, a Chesterfieldian figure among New York coffee\r\nroasters, came into the trade in 1876, when he established the firm of\r\nWilliam P. Roome & Co., with T.L. Vickers as partner. In the Civil War\r\nthat had preceded, young Roome (he was then nineteen) had distinguished\r\nhimself as a conspicuous hero of the Sixth Army Corps, having entered\r\nthe service as a second lieutenant in the Sixty-fifth New York\r\nVolunteers.\r\n\r\nWilliam P. Roome & Co. first engaged in the importation of tea, but they\r\nadded coffee to the business in 1889. Col. Roome disposed of it in 1903\r\nto assume charge of the tea and coffee department of the Acker, Merrall\r\n& Condit Company, a position which he still holds.\r\n\r\nFrederick A. Cauchois, another picturesque figure among New York coffee\r\nroasters, entered the trade as a clerk in the New York office of Chase &\r\nSanborn in 1875. After further tutelage under Frank Williams in the\r\ncoffee brokerage business, he bought the old Fulton Mills (Colgate\r\nGilbert & Co., 1848), in Fulton Street, where he did some of the most\r\noriginal advertising for coffee that the trade has seen. His Private\r\nEstate coffee in little burlap bags, his donkey train that carried the\r\nbags of green coffee through the streets of the metropolis, his system\r\nof delivering fresh coffee daily to the grocery trade, and his Japanese\r\npaper filter device to insure the proper making of the coffee, made him\r\nfamous. He brought something of the spirit of the old English coffee\r\nhouse to America, and incorporated it in Keen's Chop House in New York.\r\nHe died in 1918.\r\n\r\nThe business of Russell & Co. was founded by Robert S. Russell & Frank\r\nSmith at 107 Water Street in 1875. In 1895, S.L. Davis, one of the\r\npresent owners, formerly with Merrit & Ronaldson, became a partner. In\r\n1900, Frank C. Russell, son of the senior member, was admitted to a\r\npartnership; and upon the death of his father in 1904, he and Mr. Davis\r\nbecame owners of the business.\r\n\r\nRoss W. Weir, who, in addition to being a successful New York coffee\r\nroaster, has also attained prominence as president of the National\r\nCoffee Roasters Association and chairman of the Joint Coffee Trade\r\nPublicity Committee, handling the million dollar coffee advertising\r\ncampaign, was born in New York in 1859, the son of J.B. Weir, one of the\r\npioneer forty-niners, who at one time was engaged in the export\r\ncommission business in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nMr. Weir began his business career as a general utility boy in the\r\njobbing grocery house of S.H. Williamson, 36 Broadway, New York, in\r\n1875. Then he was a clerk for Park & Tilford, office man with Arbuckle\r\nBros, and with Geo. C. Chase & Co., tea importers, for two years,\r\nafterward being admitted to a junior partnership. In 1886, the firm of\r\nRoss W. Weir & Co. was formed to engage in the roasting of coffee and\r\nimporting and jobbing of teas at 105 Front Street. In 1887, the business\r\nwas removed to 58-60 Front Street. When the corporation of Ross W. Weir,\r\nInc. was formed in 1915 to take over the business of E.J. Gillies & Co.\r\nInc., Mr. Weir became president and treasurer of the combined\r\norganization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COL. WILLIAM P. ROOME, NEW YORK]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pioneer Wholesale Coffee Roasters_\r\n\r\nA reference to other pioneers in the wholesale coffee-roasting trade may\r\nnot be amiss here, even though it involves a repetition of some names\r\nthat have been given special mention in the case of New York. In the\r\nlist that follows are included the most prominent firms and the best\r\nknown names that helped make roasted coffee history in the United States\r\nin the nineteenth century, particularly from 1845 to 1900:\r\n\r\nNEW YORK.

Parker; W.S. Quinby & Co.; Thomas Wood & Co.\r\n\r\nDwinell & Co. and Hayward & Co. both engaged in the coffee roasting\r\nbusiness about 1845. In 1876, they, James F. Dwinell, Martin Hayward,\r\nand his brother-in-law George C. Wright, joined hands under the name of\r\nDwinell, Hayward & Co. In 1894, Mr. Hayward having previously retired,\r\nthe name of the firm was changed to Dwinell, Wright & Co. Mr. Dwinell\r\ndied in 1898; and in 1899, Mr. Wright formed a Massachusetts corporation\r\nunder the present name, Dwinell-Wright Co. George C. Wright died, 1910,\r\nand his son, George S. Wright, who had been treasurer, became president.\r\nA grandson, Warren M. Wright, and a nephew, G. E. Crampton, together\r\nwith R.O. Miller and Charles H. Holland, are active in the present\r\nconduct of the business.\r\n\r\nCaleb Chase with Messrs. Carr and Raymond founded the firm of Carr,\r\nChase & Raymond at 32 Broad Street in 1864.

Mr. Stetson retired the following year, and a new partnership\r\nwas formed with Ezra J. Warner, under the name of Sprague & Warner. In\r\n1864, O.S.A. Sprague, a young brother of the senior partner, was\r\nadmitted to the firm, which was reorganized under the style of Sprague,\r\nWarner & Co. Under this name it has since continued. About the year\r\n1876, machinery was installed, and the roasting of coffee began. Oscar\r\nRemmer entered the employ of the company in 1878 at the age of 16, and\r\nbecame manager of the mill department in 1895. In 1912, he was made a\r\nmember of the board of directors, and was elected vice-president in\r\n1919. O.S.A. Sprague died in 1909, Ezra J. Warner Sr. in 1910, and\r\nAlbert A.

Blackall, owner\r\nof the American Mills, arranged with a Mr. Berg and a Mr. Davis to go in\r\nthe coffee-roasting business with him as Berg, Thomson & Davis. After a\r\nyear, however, the name became A.M. Thomson. James Thomson, a brother,\r\ncame into the firm in 1868, and it was then called A.M. & James Thomson.\r\nA year later, it became A.M. Thomson again. In 1872, immediately after\r\nthe fire, Mr. Taylor, a member of the firm of Whiting & Taylor, joined\r\nMr. Thomson under the firm name of Thomson & Taylor. They continued the\r\nbusiness under this name about ten years, until it was incorporated in\r\n1883 under the name of Thomson & Taylor Spice Co. Among the wholesale\r\ngrocers who became stockholders at that time was W.S. Warfield, of\r\nQuincy, Ill., who, in 1901, with his son, John D.

Forbes, born\r\nin Kinross, Scotland, bought out Nicholson. In 1857, A.E. Forbes, his\r\nson, came into the store after school hours, and was admitted to\r\npartnership in 1870. The retail end of the business was dropped in 1880.\r\nRobert M., the younger son of James H., was taken into the firm a few\r\nyears after A.E. Forbes. James H. Forbes died in 1890, and the business\r\nhas since been carried on by his sons as the James H. Forbes Tea &\r\nCoffee Co. James H. Forbes installed the first Burns roaster in St.\r\nLouis, and always claimed to have been the first man to roast coffee in\r\nthe middle west.\r\n\r\nWilliam Schotten began his roasting business in 1862, although he had\r\nbeen in the grocery business since 1847. A short time later, a brother,\r\nChristian Schotten, came to the United States from Germany and was\r\nadmitted to partnership, the firm becoming William Schotten & Bro.\r\nChristian died in 1866, and a brother-in-law, Henry Verborg, was\r\nadmitted, the name being changed to William Schotten & Co.

Evans Coffee Co., with Gwynne Evans, a\r\nson of David G., as president of the corporation.\r\n\r\nThe George Nash Grocery Co. bought the Eagle Coffee and Spice Mills from\r\nthe estate of Mathew Hunt in 1870. About this time Michael E. Smith, who\r\nhad been with the concern for a number of years, was made a partner. The\r\nfirm was incorporated in 1887 as the Nash-Smith Tea & Coffee Co. George\r\nNash, Sr., died in 1910.\r\n\r\nCINCINNATI. Among the pioneer coffee roasters in Cincinnati were: John\r\nC. Appenzeller; Blook & Varwig; J. Brock; Cincinnati Spice Mills; Eagle\r\nSpice Mills; Harrison & Wilson; Parker & Dixon; Kilgour & Taylor; J.M.\r\nKrout; Succop & Lips; and H.R. Droste.\r\n\r\nAfter the centennial year and previous to 1900, the following names were\r\nadded: Potter & Parlin; James Heekin & Co.; Flugel & Popp; Utter, Adams\r\n& Ellen; J. Henry Koenig & Co.; F.W. Hinz; and the Woolson Spice Co.\r\n\r\nD.Y. Harrison, then thirty-five years old, came from Newark, N.J., and\r\nsettled in Cincinnati in 1843, opening a coffee roasting business as\r\nHarrison & Wilson. He used an old pull-out roaster with first a negro,\r\nand then a horse-power tread-mill, for power. A few years later, W.H.\r\nHarrison, a son of the founder, was admitted to the firm, the name at\r\nthat time being Parker & Harrison. D.Y. Harrison died in 1872. Fire\r\ntotally destroyed the plant in 1875. W.H. Harrison then formed a\r\npartnership with J.W. Utter, and started in again. He sold out to his\r\npartner in 1883 and went in business for himself as W.H. Harrison & Co.\r\nD.Y. Harrison is said to have been the first man to roast coffee west of\r\nPittsburg.\r\n\r\nThe Heekin Company was established in 1870 by James Heekin and Barney\r\nCorbett as a partnership under the name of Corbett & Heekin. In a short\r\ntime, Corbett died; and the name of the firm was then changed to James\r\nHeekin & Co. Alexander Stuart was admitted to the partnership about\r\n1883, and retired four years later. James J. Heekin, older son of James\r\nHeekin, was admitted to partnership in 1892. Charles Lewis, after twenty\r\nyears' experience in the coffee trade in Louisville, Cincinnati, and New\r\nYork, was admitted to the firm in 1895. James Heekin died in 1904. Upon\r\nhis death, a corporation was formed under the name of the James Heekin\r\nCompany, with Charles Lewis as president, continuing until he retired in\r\n1919. In this year a new corporation, called the Heekin Company, was\r\nformed, taking over the business of the James Heekin Co. and the Heekin\r\nSpice Co., the latter having been organized in 1899. James J. Heekin was\r\nchosen president of the new company, with Albert E. Heekin,\r\nvice-president; and Robert E. Heekin, secretary and general manager.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIONEER COFFEE ROASTERS OF THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN\r\nUNITED STATES\r\n\r\n1--J.B. Sinnot, New Orleans; 2--Julius J.

Gage; A.\r\nEngelhard; and Jacob Zinsmeister.\r\n\r\nR.J. Thornton & Co. were founded in 1837 by Richard J. Thornton and\r\nThomas Hawkins, as Thornton & Hawkins. Thornton died in 1860. His\r\ninterests remained, but the firm changed to Hawkins & Thornton. Hawkins\r\ndied in 1877, and Mrs. Thornton, having purchased the Hawkins interest,\r\nran the business as R.J. Thornton & Co. until her death in 1885. John\r\nHayes, her son-in-law, then bought the company; and when he died in\r\n1904, his widow ran the business with Thomas A. Crawford as manager.\r\nMrs. Hayes, the last of the Thornton family, died in 1919, and her\r\ninterests were sold to Crawford and R.H. Dorn, an old employee. The firm\r\nfirst roasted coffee about 1846. It is interesting to note that the\r\nplant has occupied the present site since its founding, eighty-four\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nAlbert Engelhard, Sr., founded in 1855 a wholesale grocery house which\r\nlater became A. Engelhard & Sons, Inc. In 1879, George; in 1882, Victor\r\nH.; and in 1883, Albert, Jr.; all sons of the founder, entered the\r\nbusiness. Upon moving into larger quarters in 1890, all of the sons were\r\ntaken in as partners. Albert Engelhard, Sr., retired in 1892, and the\r\nmanagement was assumed by Victor H. The business increased rapidly, and\r\nin 1897 the firm moved to its present location. Incorporated in 1901,\r\nthe wholesale grocery end was abandoned in 1903, and the concern became\r\na strictly coffee, tea, and spice house. Victor H. Engelhard died in\r\n1918; and his sons, Victor, Jr., and R.W. Engelhard, who had been in the\r\nbusiness for several years, assumed active management. Victor Engelhard,\r\nSr., was prominent in coffee affairs and in the early work of the\r\nNational Coffee Roasters Association.\r\n\r\nJacob Zinsmeister, of J. Zinsmeister & Sons, was another old-time\r\nLouisville coffee man. Before he started roasting, he was a big factor\r\nin the green coffee trade. The business was established in 1866 at New\r\nAlbany, Ind., by Frank Zinsmeister, Sr., but was later moved to\r\nLouisville. Jacob Zinsmeister was taken into the business in 1872, and\r\nthe name was changed to Frank Zinsmeister & Son. He is still active in\r\nbusiness, although he has turned the management over to his three sons.\r\n\r\nNEW ORLEANS. Men and firms active in early coffee roasting in New\r\nOrleans were: Shaw's Louisiana Coffee and Spice Mills; Ruliff, Clark &\r\nCo.; R. Poursini & Co.; and Smith & McKenna.\r\n\r\nBetween 1876 and 1900 were added: New Orleans Coffee Co.; Smith Bros. &\r\nCo.; Southern Coffee Polishing Mills; and Cage & Drew.\r\n\r\nSmith Bros. & Co. were organized in 1863 as Smith & McKenna. Mr. McKenna\r\ndied in 1872, and the firm name was changed to Smith Bros. & Co. The two\r\nSmith brothers died in 1891, and 1892. About 1900, the name became Smith\r\nBros. & Co., Ltd., and J.B. Sinnot, who had been employed for a number\r\nof years by the firm, gained control. The company failed in 1913. Mr.\r\nSinnot then entered the coffee brokerage business, in which he remained\r\nuntil his death in 1917.\r\n\r\nBorn in New Orleans in 1865, Daniel H. Hoffman started work as a sample\r\nclerk in the office of E.P. Cottraux, who was at that time the only\r\ncoffee broker in New Orleans. In 1887, Mr. Hoffman started in business\r\nfor himself. In 1894, he opened the Southern Coffee Polishing Mills,\r\nwhich have since become the Southern Coffee Mills, Inc.\r\n\r\nW.T. Jones, for many years in business as a coffee broker in Keokuk,\r\nIowa, founded the New Orleans Coffee Co. in 1890. He died in 1919.\r\n\r\nR.H. Cage and J.C. Drew organized in 1898 the firm of Cage & Drew. In\r\n1900, they established the Louisiana Coffee Mills, under the name and\r\nstyle of Cage, Drew & Co., Ltd.\r\n\r\nBen C. Casanas joined the New Orleans Coffee Co. as a city salesman, and\r\nlater became a road salesman. He withdrew in 1901 to organize the\r\nMerchants Coffee Co. of New Orleans, Ltd.\r\n\r\nSAN FRANCISCO. Pioneer coffee roasters in San Francisco were: J.A.\r\nFolger & Co.; Charles Berhard; H. Gates; D. Ghirardelli & Co.; E. Loeven\r\n& Co.; Marden & Myrick; Maine & Eckerenkotter; G. Venard; and Charles\r\nZwick.\r\n\r\nBetween 1876 and 1900 the following were added: A. Schilling & Co.; W.H.\r\nMiner; Siegfried & Brandenstein; George W. Caswell.\r\n\r\nJ.A. Folger & Co. were established in 1850 as Wm. H. Bovee & Co. A few\r\nyears later, the name became Marden & Folger, Mr. Folger having been\r\nconnected with the old firm. In the early sixties the name was changed\r\nto J.A. Folger & Co. Two employees were taken into the firm in 1878.\r\nThese were A. Schilling and a Mr. Lamb. The company was now called\r\nFolger, Schilling & Co. This partnership was dissolved in 1881, and the\r\nbusiness continued as J. A. Folger & Co. Mr. Folger died in 1890, and\r\nthe firm was then incorporated under the same name.\r\n\r\nShortly after Folger, Schilling & Co. was dissolved, A. Schilling and\r\nGeorge Volkman formed the firm of A. Schilling & Co. Mr. Schilling began\r\nhis career as an office boy with J.A. Folger in 1871.\r\n\r\nM.J. Brandenstein and John C. Siegfried formed a co-partnership under\r\nthe name of Siegfried & Brandenstein in 1880. Mr. Brandenstein bought\r\nout his partner in 1894, and took in his brothers, Manfred and Edward,\r\nthe firm name becoming M. J. Brandenstein & Co.\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Caswell started in the retail tea and coffee business in San\r\nFrancisco under his own name in 1885. In 1898, the business became\r\nwholesale only. It was incorporated in 1901 as the George W. Caswell Co.\r\nThe company took over the brands and travelling organization of Lievre,\r\nFrick & Co., which went into a dissolution of partnership in 1902.\r\n\r\nMILWAUKEE. Prominent among early coffee roasters of Milwaukee were: W. &\r\nJ. G. Flint; James Ryan & Co.; J.B. Reynolds; Jewett & Sherman; and C.E.\r\nAndrews & Co. Later we find added the Wm. Grossman Co.\r\n\r\nJ.G. Flint and Wyman Flint founded the business known as W. & J.G. Flint\r\nin 1858. J.G. Flint bought out his brother in 1880 and continued as the\r\nJ.G. Flint Co., owner of the Star Coffee and Spice Mills. He died in\r\n1896. The business was incorporated in 1901 as the J.G. Flint Co., with\r\nW.K. Flint, a son of J.G., as president. The Jewett & Sherman Co. took\r\ncontrol in 1911.\r\n\r\nProfessor Milo P. Jewett, Professor S.S. Sherman, and his brother,\r\nWilliam Sherman, founded the firm of Jewett, Sherman & Co. in 1867, and\r\ncontinued under that name until 1875, when it was incorporated as Jewett\r\n& Sherman Co., with Milo P. Jewett as president, and Henry B. Sherman,\r\nsecretary and treasurer. Professor S.S. Sherman and his sons, Fred and\r\nHenry B., sold out their interests in 1878 and formed a new business in\r\nChicago under the name of Sherman Bros. & Co. William M. Sherman then\r\nbecame president of Jewett & Sherman Co., and Charles A. Murdock, a\r\nnephew of S.S. and William Sherman, was made secretary and treasurer.\r\nMr. Murdock withdrew in 1881 and established the C.A. Murdock Mfg. Co.\r\nin Kansas City. In that same year, William H. Sherman, another nephew,\r\nbecame a stockholder and one of the directors of Jewett & Sherman Co.\r\nDr. Lewis Sherman succeeded his father as president of the company in\r\n1891, and served in that capacity until his death in 1915, when he was\r\nsucceeded by his son, Lewis Sherman, who is president of the company at\r\nthe present time (1922). John Horter, who is now secretary, joined the\r\nbusiness in 1877.\r\n\r\nWilliam Grossman started in the wholesale grocery business in 1886. John\r\nand Henry Dahlman were admitted to partnership in 1889. About three\r\nyears later, the latter closed out his interests to J.F.W. Imbusch. The\r\npresent corporation was established in 1892 as Wm. Grossman & Co. The\r\nfirm was incorporated August 1, 1916, as the Wm. Grossman Co., with Wm.\r\nGrossman as president, George A. Grossman as vice-president, and Paul E.\r\nApel as secretary and treasurer.\r\n\r\nAnother old-time coffee man of Milwaukee was Charles A. Clark, who had\r\nbeen in the coffee business for nearly twenty years before he organized\r\nthe present business of Clark & Host Co.\r\n\r\nTOLEDO. The pioneer roasting firms here seem to have been: Warren &\r\nBedwell; and J.B. Baldy & Co. Later, after 1876, we find added the Bour\r\nCompany, and the Woolson Spice Co.\r\n\r\nThe latter company was founded in 1882 by A.M. Woolson, who up to that\r\ntime had conducted a successful retail grocery business for several\r\nyears. The Woolson Spice Co. was sold to H.O. Havemeyer of New York in\r\n1896, the reputed sale price being $2,000,000. A.M. Woolson retired from\r\nbusiness at that time. Upon the death of Mr. Havemeyer, the company\r\npassed into the hands of Hermann Sielcken; and when he died, an\r\nAmerican company secured control.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROUND COFFEE PRICE LIST OF 1862]\r\n\r\nThe Bour Company was incorporated in 1892, following a partnership which\r\nhad succeeded to a small business concern under the name of the Eagle\r\nSpice Company. The principal stockholders were: J.M. Bour, F.G.\r\nKendrick, and Albro Blodgett. Mr. Blodgett bought the Bour interests in\r\n1909 and with S.W. Beckley, who had been sales manager for a number of\r\nyears, acquired practically all the other outside interests. The name\r\nwas changed in 1921 to the Blodgett-Beckley Co., the officers being\r\nAlbro Blodgett, president, S.W. Beckley, vice-president and manager, and\r\nHenry P. Blodgett, secretary and treasurer.\r\n\r\nCLEVELAND. Pioneers in Cleveland were: Smith & Curtis; A. Stephens &\r\nSons; John H. Ganse; and W.D. Drake & Co.

In 1861 Alvan's sons, Henry A. and Samuel R.,\r\nwere admitted and the firm became A. Stephens & Sons. Alvan Stephens\r\ndied in 1873, and Samuel moved to Chicago to open a branch. He died in\r\n1878. Henry A. continued the business until 1881, when Francis Widlar\r\nwas admitted to partnership, and the name was changed to Stephens &\r\nWidlar. Henry A. Stephens died in 1897, and A.L. Somers, H.H. Hewitt,\r\nand D.D. Hudson, all old employees, were admitted, and the firm name was\r\nchanged to F. Widlar & Co. Carl W. Brand, a nephew of Francis Widlar,\r\njoined the company in 1898. Upon the death of his uncle, the business\r\nwas incorporated as the Widlar Co., and Mr. Brand became president in\r\n1910.\r\n\r\nPITTSBURGH. Next to New York, Pittsburg was one of the first cities to\r\nforge to the front as a coffee-roasting center.

Fishback\r\nacquired all the stock of the company in 1918, and the name was changed\r\nto the Fishback Co. with F.S. Fishback, president; John S. Fishback,\r\ntreasurer; and F. C. Fishback, secretary.\r\n\r\nS. Holstad joined the Thomson & Taylor Spice Co of Chicago in 1892. He\r\nleft in 1901 and went to Minneapolis, where he became a member of the\r\nfirm of Atwood & Hoisted. He withdrew in 1908 to form the firm of S.\r\nHolstad & Co., with Charles Ekelund and Alexander W. Kreiser as\r\npartners. After the withdrawal of Mr. Holstad from Atwood & Holstad, Mr.\r\nAtwood continued as Atwood & Co.\r\n\r\nF.P. Atha began work as a coffee salesman with Holman & Co., Terre\r\nHaute, Ind. He went to San Francisco in 1899 and entered the employ of\r\nJ.A. Folger & Co., and introduced Folger products east of the Rockies.\r\nHe opened the Kansas City branch in 1907; and a year later, he was\r\nadmitted to the firm and made vice-president and general manager.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The National Coffee Roasters Association_\r\n\r\nThe first effort to organize the coffee roasters of the United States\r\ndates back to 1885, when several St. Louis coffee roasters came together\r\nin a kind of gentlemen's agreement not to cut the price of roasting\r\ngreen coffee, which had declined, owing to ruthless competition, from\r\n$1.00 to 10 cents a bag. The various parties to the agreement posted\r\n$500 checks each as forfeits, not to violate the price as fixed. After\r\none year, a check was cashed; but the principal claimed his lapse was\r\nclerical and not in violation of the agreement. However, as a result of\r\nthe argument that followed, the organization was disbanded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEMBERS OF THE ORGANIZATION CONVENTION OF THE NATIONAL\r\nCOFFEE ROASTERS ASSOCIATION, ST.

St. Louis; J.B.\r\nDubrouilett, St. Louis; Floyd Norwine, St. Louis]\r\n\r\nAs early as 1900, leaders of the trade's best thought began to urge the\r\nneed of a national organization among coffee roasters.\r\n\r\nAs a result of informal meetings between men like Robert M. Forbes,\r\nJulius J. Schotten, Robert Meyer, and Messrs. Roth and Homeyer, around\r\nthe luncheon table in St. Louis, to discuss trade abuses and bring about\r\nbetter trade co-operation, the subject of a St. Louis organization of\r\ncoffee roasters began to be agitated about 1906. It was not until four\r\nyears later, however, that the idea took definite form.\r\n\r\nOn September 14, 1910, the Traffic Association of St. Louis Coffee\r\nImporters was organized, starting out with a membership of ten firms,\r\nits chief object being to obtain an adjustment of freight rates to and\r\nfrom St. Louis as advantageous as those prevailing for Chicago and New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nThis association--of which Robert Meyer was the first president, and\r\nH.L. Homeyer, vice-president, J.S. Hartman, secretary, and G.H. Petring,\r\ntreasurer--was the forerunner of the National Coffee Roasters Traffic\r\nand Pure Food Association organized in 1911 and now known as the\r\nNational Coffee Roasters Association.\r\n\r\nAt the organization meeting of the national association twenty-six\r\ncoffee-roasting establishments in the Mississippi Valley were\r\nrepresented at the conference held May 26-27 in the Planters Hotel, St.\r\nLouis. The objects of the new body were announced in the constitution,\r\nas:\r\n\r\n     _First_: To foster and promote a feeling of fellowship and good\r\n     will among its members, and on broad and equitable lines to advance\r\n     the welfare of the coffee trade and the consumer.\r\n\r\n     _Second_: To eliminate or minimize abuses, methods and practises\r\n     inimical to the proper conduct of business.\r\n\r\n     _Third_: To assist in the enactment and enforcement of uniform pure\r\n     food laws which in their operations shall deal justly and equitably\r\n     with the rights of the consumer and the trade.\r\n\r\nThe association started with these officers: Julius J. Schotten, St.\r\nLouis, President; M.H. Gasser, Toledo, vice-president; W.E. Tone, Des\r\nMoines, treasurer, and W.J.H. Bown, St. Louis, secretary.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as a result of an agitation started by _The Tea and Coffee\r\nTrade Journal_, a meeting of New York and eastern coffee roasters was\r\ncalled at the Fulton Club, New York, October 27, 1911, to discuss plans\r\nfor a national organization. M. H. Gasser attended this meeting, and\r\ntold of the plan of the western roasters to organize such an\r\norganization at a meeting called for Chicago the following month. The\r\npromoters of the eastern organization subsequently abandoned their\r\nefforts in favor of the western group.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERT MEYER, ST. LOUIS\r\n\r\nFirst president of the Coffee Roasters' original organization]\r\n\r\nAt the first convention of the National Coffee Roasters Traffic and Pure\r\nFood Association, held in Chicago, November 16-17, 1911, all the\r\nforegoing officers were retained, the office of second vice-president\r\nwas created, and Frank R. Seelye was selected to fill it.\r\n\r\nThat the organization idea was popular among the roasters was evident\r\nfrom the fact that at the close of the convention it was announced that\r\nthe membership was then seventy-one firms in cities as far east as\r\nVirginia and as far west as Kansas City. The convention demonstrated\r\nthat the association was really a national organization, which quieted\r\nsuspicions prevalent in some quarters of the trade in the east that it\r\nwas chiefly a Mississippi Valley unit.\r\n\r\nThe first convention is remembered principally because of Hermann\r\nSielcken's defense of the Brazil coffee valorization plan, which was\r\nthen the big question of the coffee trade. The titles of some of the\r\nother addresses will serve to indicate how the scope of the association\r\nhad enlarged since its organization a few months before: \"An Attack on\r\nValorization\" by Thomas J. Webb, of Chicago; \"Uniform Food Laws\", by\r\nW.T. Jones, of New Orleans; \"Penny-Change Systems,\" by R.W. McCreery, of\r\nMarshalltown, Ia; \"Traffic and Freight Abuses,\" by W.E. Tone, of Des\r\nMoines; \"Transportation Problems,\" by Carl H. Stoffregen, St. Louis;\r\n\"Coffee Publicity,\" by F.H. Henrici, of Chicago; \"Coffee Roasters' Costs\r\nand Accounting,\" by F.J. Ach, Chicago. The first convention proved a\r\nsuccess, and attracted attention.\r\n\r\nThe second annual convention, held in New York, November 13-15, 1912,\r\nshowed that the association had grown to a membership of 135 firms\r\nlocated in all parts of the country, and that its influence had extended\r\nthroughout the whole trade. Valorization continued to be a much\r\ndiscussed subject. Hermann Sielcken and others again defending it in\r\nspeeches; but the majority of the association seemed opposed to the\r\nscheme. Probably the most important feature of the convention was the\r\nreport of the committee of nine men who had visited Brazil to\r\ninvestigate conditions there and to interest the Brazilian coffee\r\ngrowers in an advertising campaign. An address on this subject was made\r\nby the editor of _The Tea and Coffee Trade Journal_, in which he\r\nsuggested a plan for propaganda and advocated scientific research to\r\nfind out the truth about coffee.\r\n\r\nThe election of officers resulted in the selection of F.J. Ach, Dayton,\r\nas president; Frank R. Seelye, Chicago, first vice-president; Ross W.\r\nWeir, New York, second vice-president; and Robert Meyer, St. Louis,\r\ntreasurer.\r\n\r\nThe 1912 convention changed the name of the association to the National\r\nCoffee Roasters Association, dropping the words \"Traffic and Pure Food\"\r\nfrom the original title.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JULIUS J. SCHOTTEN--1911-12]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: F.J. ACH--1912-14]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROSS W. WEIR--1914-16]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANK R. SEELYE--1916-17]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEN C. CASANAS--1917-18]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARL W. BRAND--1918-21]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORMER PRESIDENTS, NATIONAL COFFEE ROASTERS ASSOCIATION]\r\n\r\nThe third convention, which was held November 12-14, 1913, in\r\nCincinnati, demonstrated that the scope of usefulness of the association\r\nwas still growing, as shown by the resolutions which approved better\r\ncoffee-making publicity; favored a national coffee day; urged the\r\nappointment of inspectors at ports of entry to prevent the importation\r\nof green coffee under government standard No. 8; condemned the excessive\r\nwatering of coffee and all coffee coatings; and provided for the\r\nappointment of an agent to visit Brazil to furnish members with\r\n\"reliable\" reports on crop flowering.\r\n\r\nF.J. Ach was re-elected president; Ross W. Weir succeeded F.R. Seelye as\r\nfirst vice-president; W.T. Jones succeeded Mr. Weir as second\r\nvice-president, and Robert Meyer was retained as treasurer.\r\n\r\nSecretary G.W. Toms, who had been appointed in April, 1913, reported\r\nthat the association had made a net gain of thirteen members, bringing\r\nthe total up to 144.\r\n\r\nThe membership of the association had been increased by twenty names\r\nwhen the fourth annual convention was opened in New Orleans, November\r\n16-19, 1914, making the total 164.\r\n\r\nBetter coffee making, roasting economies, a national coffee week, and\r\nimproved methods of handling green coffee in ports and warehouses, were\r\nthe principal topics considered at the 1914 meeting. As a result of the\r\ndiscussions, the association went on record in its resolutions as being\r\nagainst the misbranding of both green and roasted coffee; favored the\r\ncreation of a United States board of coffee experts; and the\r\nestablishment of an association trade-mark bureau.\r\n\r\nFor the ensuing year Ross W. Weir, New York, was chosen president; J.O.\r\nCheek, Nashville, first vice-president; T.F. Halligan, Davenport, second\r\nvice-president; and W.T. Morley, Worcester, treasurer.\r\n\r\nThe decision to get together on a comprehensive national publicity\r\ncampaign in the interest of coffee was the outstanding feature of the\r\nfifth annual convention, which was held in St. Louis, November 8-11,\r\n1915, in the same room in the Planters Hotel in which the association\r\nwas organized in 1911. From a body of twenty-six roasters, the\r\nassociation had grown in five years to a membership of 201 firms and\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nAmong the more important things done at this convention was the decision\r\nto undertake a practical publicity plan to advertise coffee; the\r\nadoption of a uniform cost-and-freight contract; the proposal to prepare\r\neducational matter on coffee for the schools; and the recommendation to\r\nemploy a chemist to carry on research work. There were spirited\r\ndiscussions also on gas, coal, and coke as roasting fuels; on the best\r\nway to get retailer co-operation, and whether it was advisable to\r\ncontinue the national coffee week idea. President Weir, Vice-Presidents\r\nCheek and Halligan, and Treasurer Morley were re-elected.\r\n\r\nThe sixth annual convention, held in Atlantic City, November 14-17,\r\n1916, placed emphasis on research into grinding and brewing; on plans\r\nfor doing something practical to help grocers regain their lost coffee\r\ntrade; and on an investigation into the scientific costs of roasting.\r\nThe admittance of green coffee and allied interests into the association\r\nwas also discussed, and it was resolved to make the subject an order of\r\nbusiness for special consideration at the next convention.\r\n\r\nAt this meeting Frank R. Seelye, Chicago, was elected president; Ben C.\r\nCasanas, New Orleans, first vice-president; J.M. McFadden, Dubuque,\r\nsecond vice-president; and M.H. Gasser, Toledo, treasurer. The\r\nmembership was reported as being 204, showing a net increase of three\r\nduring the year.\r\n\r\nThe seventh convention, held in Chicago, November 14-15, 1917, came when\r\nthe first movement of American soldiers to European battlefields was\r\nbegun, and patriotism was the keynote of the meeting. Because of the\r\nstress of the times, the program was cut to two days, instead of the\r\nthree days of former meetings.\r\n\r\nThe outstanding features of the convention were: the decision not to\r\nadmit green coffee men to the association; the decision to establish a\r\npermanent headquarters; the announcement that Brazil was then collecting\r\nfunds for its part in the national advertising campaign; and the\r\nproposal by John E. King, Detroit, that the term \"lead number\" be used\r\ninstead of \"caffetannic acid\", which he asserted was a misnomer. The\r\nexecutive committee was authorized to employ a secretary-manager. The\r\nshorter terms and credits idea was endorsed by the association.\r\n\r\nThese officers were elected for the next year; Ben C. Casanas, New\r\nOrleans, president; S.H. Holstad, Minneapolis, first vice-president;\r\nEdward Aborn, New York, second vice-president; M.H. Gasser, Toledo,\r\ntreasurer.\r\n\r\nThe influenza epidemic, which swept the country the latter part of 1918,\r\ncaused the postponement of many business and public gatherings, and the\r\neighth annual roasters convention did not assemble until December 5-6,\r\nin Cleveland--at only ten days' notice. Unlike previous occasions, this\r\nwas in reality a combined convention of all roasted and green coffee men\r\nin the trade, both association members and non-members. No regular\r\nprogram was followed, the meeting being somewhat in the character of a\r\ntrade conference.\r\n\r\nThe salient features of the convention were the decisions: to double the\r\nannual dues, in order to provide for a paid secretary-manager and to\r\nestablish permanent headquarters; to organize a spice grinders' section;\r\nand to ask the government to remove all restrictions on coffee trading.\r\nThe Food Administration's coffee regulations came in for severe\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\nThe election of officers resulted in Carl W. Brand, Cleveland, becoming\r\npresident; Robert M. Forbes, St. Louis, first vice-president; J.A.\r\nFolger, San Francisco, second vice-president; and Lewis Sherman,\r\nMilwaukee, treasurer.\r\n\r\nThe ninth convention of the National Coffee Roasters Association was of\r\ngreater import to all branches of the coffee trade than any that had\r\npreceded it. The results of the meeting showed the association had gone\r\nfar since the organization meeting in St. Louis in 1911. As in 1916, the\r\nconvention was held in Atlantic City, November 12-14, 1919, and drew\r\ndelegates from as far west as San Francisco and Seattle.\r\n\r\nThe most important subjects before the meeting were the reports of the\r\nJoint Coffee Trade Publicity Committee, read by Ross W. Weir, chairman,\r\nand Felix Coste, secretary-manager. The committee had been organized\r\nduring the year to carry on the national coffee-advertising campaign,\r\nand announced at the convention its publicity plans for the next year,\r\nwhich included a national coffee week, a national showing of the\r\ncommittee's coffee film, and the issuance of several educational\r\nbooklets. Other outstanding features included the description of how the\r\nassociation planned to conduct a research into the cost of doing a\r\nwholesale coffee-roasting business, the investigation to be made by\r\nColumbia University; addresses attacking the meat packers' invasion of\r\nthe coffee roasting and distributing field; a paper, and discussions, on\r\nshorter terms and uniform discounts; the recommendation to employ a\r\ntraveling field secretary who would hold periodical meetings with local\r\nbranches; and the condemnation of guaranteeing prices against decline\r\nand giving advance notices of changes of prices.\r\n\r\nThe convention unanimously agreed to the re-election of President Brand,\r\nVice-Presidents Forbes and Folger, and Treasurer Sherman.\r\n\r\nThe tenth annual meeting was held in St. Louis, November 10-12, 1920.\r\nScientific cost finding, short terms and discounts, the national\r\nadvertising campaign, the activities of the N.C.R.A. freight-forwarding\r\nbureau, and laboratory-research were the main topics of this years'\r\ngathering. The membership was reported to be 310. A feature of the\r\nmeeting was the first industrial exhibit by twenty-five supply houses.\r\nAmong the things accomplished were:\r\n\r\nThe recommendation that members co-operate in determining the invisible\r\nsupply of coffee in the United States at stated periods; increasing\r\nannual dues from $50 to $60 for members having $50,000 or less\r\ncapitalization, and from $100 to $120 for firms having more than $50,000\r\ncapital; restricting membership to purely wholesale coffee roasters and\r\ndistributers; and offering co-operation to hotel-men and\r\nrestaurant-keepers in standardizing and improving their coffee\r\nbeverages.\r\n\r\nThe St. Louis meeting was notable in violating association precedent by\r\nunanimously electing Carl W. Brand president for the third consecutive\r\nterm. Other officers were: J.A. Folger, San Francisco, first\r\nvice-president, R.O. Miller, Chicago, second vice-president; Charles A.\r\nClark, Milwaukee, treasurer.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh annual meeting, held in New York, November 1-3, 1921, set\r\nthe high-water mark of the organization's record of achievement. This\r\nconvention took the first definite steps toward the amalgamation of the\r\ngreen and roasted coffee interests in one association. Brazil sent a\r\ndelegation of coffee men to invite a similar delegation to pay a return\r\nvisit to Brazil. It was announced also that São Paulo was about to\r\ndouble its tax contribution to the national advertising campaign. Among\r\nother things done, were: the appropriation of $1500 to work out a\r\nuniform cost-accounting system for roasters; the recommendation that\r\ncoffee importers insist upon the use of American ships by Brazilian\r\nexporters; the formulation of a cost-and-freight arbitration contract\r\nfor use with São Paulo exporters; the formation of a new membership\r\nclass roasting up to 6000 bags a year; and the decision to make a\r\nnational campaign to put the selling of coffee on a uniform thirty-days\r\ncredit, two percent cash in ten days basis. Professor S.C. Prescott,\r\nreporting on the research work being done at the Massachusetts Institute\r\nof Technology, said a better brew of coffee could be obtained at a\r\ntemperature of 185 degrees than at the boiling point; that glass, china,\r\nor enameled-ware pots were to be preferred, and that the filtration\r\nmethod is superior to that employed in the pumping percolator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOEL O. CHEEK, NASHVILLE\r\n\r\nPresident of the National Coffee Roasters Association, 1922]\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Exposition included displays by twenty-eight\r\nmanufacturers of machinery and supplies, and was voted a success. Many\r\nof the exhibits were of a distinctly educational character.\r\n\r\nThe following officers were elected for 1921-22: President, Joel O.\r\nCheek, Nashville, Tenn.; first vice-president, Webster Jones, San\r\nFrancisco; second vice-president, Joseph E. Maury, Memphis, Tenn.;\r\ntreasurer, Frank Ennis, Kansas City.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Roaster Statistics_\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, considering the leading place that New York holds\r\nas a port of entry for coffee, the roasting and grinding of coffee is\r\nmore important in the eastern section of the country than in any other.\r\nBut there are many establishments for preparing coffee scattered\r\nthroughout the south and the middle west, and the business has grown to\r\nconsiderable proportions on the Pacific coast. New York state leads in\r\nnumber of establishments and is followed by Pennsylvania, California,\r\nMissouri, Ohio, and Illinois.

Of the\r\n696, however, 658 had coffee as their principal product, and the figures\r\nmay thus be taken as indicating fairly well the general distribution of\r\nthe coffee-manufacturing industry. These figures, for the various\r\nstates, are shown on page 515.\r\n\r\nPreliminary figures for the 1919 census show that the value of the\r\nproduct almost doubled in the five years 1914-19, amounting to\r\n$304,740,000 in 1919, while the number of establishments increased from\r\n696 to 794, of which 769 specialize in coffee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nSOME BIG MEN AND NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENTS\r\n\r\n     _B.G.

In green coffee,\r\nwe have B.G. Arnold, the first, and Hermann Sielcken the last, of the\r\n\"coffee kings\"; in the roasting business, there was John Arbuckle, the\r\noriginal national-package-coffee man; and in the coffee-roasting\r\nmachinery business, Jabez Burns, inventor, manufacturer, and writer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The First \"Coffee King\"_\r\n\r\nBenjamin Green Arnold came to New York from Rhode Island in 1836 and\r\ntook a job as accountant with an east-side grocer. He was thrifty,\r\nindustrious, and kept his own counsel. He was a born financial leader.\r\nFifteen years later he was made a junior partner in the firm. By 1868,\r\nthe bookkeeper of 1836 was the head of the business, with a line of\r\ncredit amounting to half a million dollars--a notable achievement in\r\nthose days.\r\n\r\nMr. Arnold embarked upon his big speculation in coffee in 1869. For ten\r\nyears he maintained his mastery of the market, and in that time amassed\r\na fortune. It is related that one year's operations of this daring\r\ntrader yielded his firm a profit of a million and a quarter of dollars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BENJAMIN GREEN ARNOLD]\r\n\r\nB.G. Arnold was the first president of the New York Coffee Exchange. He\r\nwas one of the founders of the Down Town Association in 1878. The\r\npresident of the United States was his friend, and a guest at his\r\nluxurious home. But the high-price levels to which Arnold had forced the\r\ncoffee market started a coffee-planting fever in the countries of\r\nproduction. Almost before he knew it, there was an overproduction that\r\nswamped the market and forced down prices with so amazing rapidity that\r\npanic seized upon the traders. Few that were caught in that memorable\r\ncoffee maelstrom survived financially.\r\n\r\nArnold himself was a victim, but such was the man's character that his\r\nfailure was regarded by many as a public misfortune. Some men differed\r\nwith him as to the wisdom of promoting a coffee corner, and protested\r\nthat it was against public policy; but Arnold's personal integrity was\r\nnever questioned, and his mercantile ability and honorable business\r\ndealings won for him an affectionate regard that continued after his\r\nfortune had been swept away.\r\n\r\nAfter the collapse of the coffee corner, Mr. Arnold resumed business\r\nwith his son, F.B. Arnold. He died in New York, December 10, 1894, in\r\nhis eighty-second year. The son died in Rome in 1906. The business which\r\nthe father founded, however, continues today as Arnold, Dorr & Co., one\r\nof the most honored and respected names in Front Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hermann Sielcken, the Last Coffee King_\r\n\r\nIf B.G. Arnold was first coffee king, Hermann Sielcken was last, for it\r\nis unlikely that ever again, in the United States, will it be possible\r\nfor one man to achieve so absolute a dictatorship of the green coffee\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThere never was a coffee romance like that of Hermann Sielcken's. Coming\r\nto America a poor boy in 1869, forty-five years later, he left it many\r\ntimes a millionaire. For a time, he ruled the coffee markets of the\r\nworld with a kind of autocracy such as the trade had never seen before\r\nand probably will not see again. And when, just before the outbreak of\r\nthe World War, he returned to Germany for the annual visit to his\r\nBaden-Baden estate, from which he was destined never again to sally\r\nforth to deeds of financial prowess, his subsequent involuntary\r\nretirement found him a huge commercial success, where B.G. Arnold was a\r\ncolossal failure. It was the World War and a lingering illness that, at\r\nthe end, stopped Hermann Sielcken. But, though he had to admit himself\r\nbested by the fortunes of war, he was still undefeated in the world of\r\ncommerce. He died in his native Germany in 1917, the most commanding,\r\nand the most cordially disliked, figure ever produced by the coffee\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nHermann Sielcken was born in Hamburg in 1847, and so was seventy years\r\nold when he died at Baden-Baden, October 8, 1917. He was the son of a\r\nsmall baker in Hamburg; and before he was twenty-one, he went to Costa\r\nRica to work for a German firm there. He did not like Costa Rica, and\r\nwithin a year he went to San Francisco, where, with a knowledge of\r\nEnglish already acquired, he got a job as a shipping clerk. This was in\r\n1869. A wool concern engaged him as buyer, and for about six years he\r\ncovered the territory between the Rockies and the Pacific, buying wool.\r\nOn one of these trips he was in a stage-coach wreck in Oregon and nearly\r\nlost his life. He received injuries affecting his back from which he\r\nnever fully recovered, and which caused the stooped posture which marked\r\nhis carriage through life thereafter. When he recovered, he came to New\r\nYork seeking employment, and obtained a clerical position with L.\r\nStrauss & Sons, importers of crockery and glassware. In 1880, married\r\nJosephine Chabert, whose father kept a restaurant in Park Place.\r\n\r\nSielcken had learned Spanish in Costa Rica, and this knowledge aided him\r\nto a place with W.H. Crossman & Bro. (W.H. and George W. Crossman)\r\nmerchandise commission merchants in Broad Street. He was sent to South\r\nAmerica to solicit consignments for the Crossmans, and was surprisingly\r\nsuccessful. For six or eight months every South American mail brought\r\norders to the house. Then, as the story goes, his reports suddenly\r\nceased. Weeks and months passed, and the firm heard nothing from him.\r\n\r\nThe Crossmans speculated concerning his fate. It was thought he might\r\nhave caught a fever and died. It was almost impossible to trace him; at\r\nthe same time it distressed them to lose so promising a representative.\r\nGiving up all hope of hearing from him again, they began to look around\r\nfor some one to take his place. Then, one morning, he walked into the\r\noffice and said, \"How do you do?\" just as if he had left them only the\r\nevening before. The members of the firm questioned him eagerly. He\r\nanswered some of their questions; but most of them he did not. Then he\r\nlaid a package on the table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HERMANN SIELCKEN]\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen\", he said, \"I have given a large amount of business to you,\r\nfar more than you expected, as the result of my trip. I have a lot more\r\nbusiness which I can give to you. It's all in black and white in the\r\npapers in this package. I think any person who has worked as hard as I\r\nhave, and so well, deserves a partnership in this firm. If you want\r\nthese orders, you may have them. They represent a big profit to you.\r\nGood work deserves proper reward. Look these papers over, and then tell\r\nme if you want me to continue with you as a member of this firm.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the Crossmans had looked those papers over they had no doubt of\r\nthe advisability of taking Sielcken into partnership. He was admitted as\r\na junior in 1881-82 and became a full partner in 1885. For more than\r\ntwenty years Hermann Sielcken was the human dynamo that pushed the firm\r\nforward into a place of world prominence. He was the best informed man\r\non coffee in two continents; and when, in 1904, the firm name was\r\nchanged to Crossman & Sielcken--W.H. Crossman having died ten years\r\nbefore--he was well prepared to assert his rights as king of the trade.\r\nHe proved his kingship by his masterful handling of valorization three\r\nyears later.\r\n\r\nSielcken was many times credited with working \"corners\" in coffee; but\r\nhe would never admit that a corner was possible in anything that came\r\nout of the ground; and to the end, he was insistent in his denials of\r\never having cornered coffee. As a daring trader, he won his spurs in a\r\nsensational tilt with the Arbuckles in the bull campaign of 1887.\r\nBecause of this, he became one of the most feared and hated men in the\r\nCoffee Exchange. For a while, coffee did not offer enough play for his\r\ntremendous energy and ambition. He embarked in various\r\nenterprises--among them, the steel industry and railroads. No one was\r\ntoo big for Sielcken to cross lances with. He bested John W. Gates in a\r\ntitanic fight, in American Steel and Wire. He quarreled with E.H.\r\nHarriman and George J. Gould over the possession of the Kansas City,\r\nPittsburgh, and Gulf Railroad, now known as the Kansas City Southern,\r\nand, backed by a syndicate of Hollanders, obtained control.\r\n\r\nWhile still busy with the Kansas City Southern enterprise Sielcken began\r\nwork on the coffee valorization scheme that he carried to a successful\r\nconclusion in spite of the law of supply and demand and the interference\r\nof the Congress of the United States. Valorization by the São Paulo\r\ngovernment, and by coffee merchants, having proved a failure; Sielcken\r\nshowed how it could be done with all the American coffee merchants\r\neliminated--except himself. In this way, he secured for himself the\r\nopportunity he had long been seeking--the chance to bestride the coffee\r\ntrade like a colossus. The story is told farther along in this chapter.\r\n\r\nWhen his partner, George W. Crossman, died in 1913, it was discovered\r\nthat the two men had a remarkable contract. Each had made a will giving\r\none million dollars to the other. Then Sielcken bought his late\r\npartner's interest in the firm for $5,166,991.\r\n\r\nHis first wife having died at Mariahalden, his home in Baden-Baden,\r\nseven years before, Sielcken married at Tessin, Germany, in 1913, Mrs.\r\nClara Wendroth, a widow with two children, and the daughter of the late\r\nPaul Isenberg, a wealthy sugar planter of the Hawaiian Islands. At that\r\ntime the coffee king was dividing his time between the Waldorf-Astoria,\r\nNew York, which he called his American home, and his wonderful estate in\r\nthe fatherland. This latter was a two-hundred-acre private park\r\ncontaining four villas and a marvelous bath-house for guests besides the\r\nmain villa; a rose-garden in which were cultivated one hundred\r\nsixty-eight varieties on some twenty thousand bushes; a special\r\ngreenhouse for orchids; and landscaped grounds calling for the service\r\nof six professional gardeners and forty assistants. Here he delighted to\r\nentertain his friends. Frequently, there were fifteen to twenty of them\r\nfor dinner on the garden terrace; and, as the moon came up through the\r\ntall hemlocks and shone through the majestic pines brought from Oregon,\r\na full military band from Heidelberg, adown the hillside among the rose\r\ntrees, mingled its music with the dinner discussions. There was nothing\r\nat that dinner table but peace and harmony, although every language in\r\nEurope was spoken; for Sielcken knew them all from his youth. Sometimes\r\nhe entertained his guests with stories of his California life, and\r\nsometimes with those of shipwrecks in South America.\r\n\r\nAll the post-telegraph boys in Baden knew every foot of the sharply\r\nwinding road up the Yburg Strasse to Villa Mariahalden; and the guests\r\ntherein have counted more than eighty cables received, and more than\r\nthirty sent in a single day. And those daily cable messages were to and\r\nfrom all quarters of the globe, and to and from the master, who handled\r\nthem all, without even a secretary or typewriter. Nowhere in the entire\r\nestablishment was there even an appearance of business, except as the\r\nmessages came and went on the highway. Sielcken manifested his greatest\r\ndelight in showing his friends his orchids, his roses, his pigeons, his\r\ntrout, and his trees.\r\n\r\nLike Napoleon, this merchant prince required only five hours sleep. It\r\nwas his custom to go to bed at one and to be up at six. Did he wish to\r\nknow anything that the cables did not bring him, he jumped into his\r\neighty-horse-power Mercedes with a party of guests and was off with the\r\nsunrise, down the Rhine Valley, on his way to Paris or Hamburg; and\r\nbefore one realized that he was gone, he was back again.\r\n\r\nIn 1913, Sielcken admitted to partnership in his firm two employees of\r\nlong service, John S. Sorenson and Thorlief S.B. Nielsen. He went to\r\nGermany in 1914, shortly before the beginning of the World War, and\r\nremained at Mariahalden until he died in 1917. Sielcken never would\r\nbelieve that war was possible until it had actually started. Up to the\r\nlast moment in July, 1914, he was cabling his New York partner that\r\nthere would probably be no hostilities. He lost a bet of a thousand\r\npounds made with a visiting Brazilian friend a few days before war was\r\ndeclared. The guest believed war inevitable and won. A few days before\r\nSielcken's death the old firm was dissolved under the Trading with the\r\nEnemy Act, being succeeded by the firm of Sorenson & Nielsen. The former\r\nhad been with the business thirty-four years, and the latter thirty-two\r\nyears. The alien property custodian took over Sielcken's interest for\r\nthe duration of the war.\r\n\r\nRumors in 1915 that the German government was extorting large sums of\r\nmoney from Sielcken brought denials from his associates here. After the\r\nwar, it was confirmed that no such extortions took place.\r\n\r\nSielcken always claimed American citizenship. There was a widely\r\ncirculated story, never proved, that he tore up his citizenship papers\r\nin 1912 when the United States government began its suit to force the\r\nsale of coffee stocks held here under the valorization agreement. The\r\nSupreme Court of California in 1921 decided that he _was_ a citizen, and\r\nhis interests and those of his widow, amounting to $4,000,000, held by\r\nthe alien property custodian, were thereupon released to his heirs. It\r\nappeared in evidence that he took out his citizenship papers in San\r\nFrancisco in 1873-74, but lost them in a shipwreck off the coast of\r\nBrazil in 1876. The San Francisco fire destroyed the other records; but\r\nunder act of legislature re-establishing them, the citizenship claim was\r\ndeclared valid.\r\n\r\nHermann Sielcken never liked the title of \"coffee king.\" He was once\r\nasked about this appellation, and turned smartly upon the interviewer.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" he said. \"I am no king. I don't like the term, because I\r\nnever heard of a 'king' who did not fail.\"\r\n\r\nSielcken had no use for titles. T.S.B. Nielsen says that at a dinner\r\nparty in Germany in 1915 he heard Sielcken explain to a large number of\r\nguests that the United States was the best country because there a man\r\nwas appraised at his real value. What he did, and how he lived,\r\ncounted--not birth or titles.\r\n\r\nWhile his greatest achievement was, of course, the valorization\r\nenterprise, he played a not unimportant rôle in the Havemeyer-Arbuckle\r\nsugar-trust fight. He aided the late Henry O. Havemeyer to secure\r\ncontrol of the Woolson Spice Co. of Toledo in 1896, so as to enable the\r\nHavemeyer's to retaliate with Lion brand coffee for the Arbuckles'\r\nentrance into the sugar business. The Woolson Spice Co. sold the Lion\r\nbrand in the middle west, and the American Coffee Co. sold it in the\r\neast. That was the beginning of a losing price-war that lasted ten\r\nyears. At the end, Sielcken took over the Woolson property at a price\r\nconsiderably lower than originally paid for it. In 1919, the Woolson\r\nSpice Co. brought suit against the Sielcken estate, alleging a loss of\r\n$932,000 on valorization coffee sold to it by Sielcken just after the\r\nfederal government began its suit in 1912 to break up the valorization\r\npool in the United States. The Woolson Spice Co. paid the \"market\r\nprice\", as did the rest of the buyers of valorization coffee; but it was\r\ncharged that Sielcken, as managing partner of Crossman & Sielcken, sold\r\nthe coffee to the Woolson Spice Co., of which he was president, \"at\r\nartificially enhanced prices and in quantities far in excess of its\r\nlegitimate needs, concealing his knowledge that before the plaintiff\r\ncould use the coffee, the price would decline.\" Sielcken collected for\r\nthe coffee sold $3,218,666.\r\n\r\nWhen the United States government crossed lances with Sielcken in 1912\r\nover the valorization scheme, it looked for a time as if he would be\r\nunhorsed. But men and governments were all the same to Sielcken; and at\r\nthe end of the fight it was discovered that not only was he\r\nundefeated--for the government never pressed its suit to conclusion--but\r\nthat his prestige as king and master mind of the coffee trade had gained\r\nimmeasurably by the adventure.\r\n\r\nHermann Sielcken typified German efficiency raised to the nth power. He\r\nwas a colossus of commerce with the military alertness of a Bismarck.\r\nHis mental processes were profound, and his vision was far-reaching. He\r\nwas a resourceful trader, an austere friend, a shrewd and uncompromising\r\nfoe. Physically, he was a big man with a bull neck and black, piercing\r\neyes. His policy in coffee was one of blood and iron. He brooked no\r\ninterference with his plans, and he was ruthless in his methods of\r\ndealing with men and governments. Usually silent and uncommunicative,\r\noccasionally he exploded under stress; and when he did so, there was no\r\nmincing of words. He knew no fear. Newspaper criticism annoyed him but\r\nlittle; and he had a kind of contempt for the fourth estate as a whole,\r\nalthough he knew how to use it when it suited his purpose. He avoided\r\nthe limelight, and never courted publicity for himself. Socially he was\r\na princely host; but few knew him intimately, except perhaps in his\r\nnative Germany.\r\n\r\nSielcken's widow was married in New York, February 11, 1922, to Joseph\r\nM. Schwartz, the Russian baritone of the Chicago Opera Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Story of John Arbuckle_\r\n\r\nJohn Arbuckle, for nearly fifty years the honored dean of the American\r\ncoffee trade, pioneer package-coffee man, some time coffee king, sugar\r\nmerchant, philanthropist, and typical American, came from fine, rugged\r\nScotch stock. He was the son of a well-to-do Scottish woolen-mill owner\r\nin Allegheny, Pa., where he was born, July 11, 1839. He often said he\r\nwas raised on skim milk. He received a common school education in\r\nPittsburgh and Allegheny. He and Henry Phipps, the coke and steel head,\r\nare said to have occupied adjoining desks in one of the public schools,\r\nAndrew Carnegie being at that time in another grade of the same school.\r\nHe had a strong bent for science and machinery; and, although he chose\r\nthe coffee instead of the steel business for his career, the basis of\r\nhis success was invention. He also attended Washington and Jefferson\r\nCollege at Washington, Pennsylvania.[348]\r\n\r\nThe Arbuckle business was founded at Pittsburg, in 1859, when Charles\r\nArbuckle, his uncle Duncan McDonald, and their friend William Roseburg,\r\norganized the wholesale grocery firm of McDonald & Arbuckle. One year\r\nlater John Arbuckle, the younger brother of Charles Arbuckle, was\r\nadmitted to the firm, and the firm name was changed to McDonald &\r\nArbuckles. McDonald and Roseburg retired from the firm a few years\r\nlater, leaving the business in the hands of the two youthful, hopeful,\r\nand energetic brothers, who under the firm name of Arbuckles & Co., soon\r\nmade their firm one of the important wholesale grocery houses in\r\nPennsylvania. Although little thinking at the time that their greatest\r\nsuccess was to be achieved in coffee, and that a new idea of one of the\r\npartners--that of marketing roasted coffee in original packages--would\r\nmake their name familiar in every hamlet in the country, yet the first\r\ntwo entries in the original day-book of McDonald & Arbuckles record\r\npurchases of coffee.\r\n\r\nPrior to the sixties, coffee was not generally sold roasted or ground,\r\nready for the coffee pot. Except in the big cities, most housewives\r\nbought their coffee green, and roasted it in their kitchen stoves as\r\nneeded. John Arbuckle, having become impressed with the wasteful methods\r\nand unsatisfactory results of this kitchen roasting, had already begun\r\nhis studies of roasting and packaging problems, studies that he never\r\ngave up. How, first to roast coffee scientifically, and then to preserve\r\nits freshness in the interval between the roaster and the coffee pot,\r\ncontinued to be an absorbing study until his death. The range of his\r\nwork may be illustrated by reference to his first and his last patents.\r\nIn 1868, he patented a process of glazing coffee, which had for its\r\nobject the preservation of the flavor and aroma of coffee by sealing the\r\npores of the coffee bean. Thirty-five years later, he patented a huge\r\ncoffee roaster in which, more closely than in any other roaster, he felt\r\nhe could approach his ideal of roasting coffee--that ideal being to hold\r\nthe coffee beans in suspension in superheated air during the entire\r\nroasting process, and not to allow them to come in contact with a heated\r\niron surface.\r\n\r\nBy 1865, John Arbuckle had satisfied himself that a carefully roasted\r\ncoffee, packed while still warm in small individual containers, would\r\nmeasurably overcome the objections to selling loose coffee in a roasted\r\nstate. So in that year (1865), although not without the misgivings of\r\nhis elder brother, and even in the face of the ridicule of competitors,\r\nwho derided the plan of selling roasted coffee \"in little paper bags\r\nlike peanuts\", Arbuckles & Co. introduced the new idea, namely, roasted\r\ncoffee in original packages. The story of the development of that simple\r\nidea, which soon spread from coast to coast, and of how it laid the\r\nfoundations of a great fortune, is one of the romances of American\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nAlthough Osborn's Celebrated Prepared Java Coffee, a ground-coffee\r\npackage, first put on the New York market by Lewis A. Osborn, and later\r\nexploited by Thomas Reid in the early sixties, appears to have been the\r\noriginal package coffee, much of the fame attached to the name of\r\nArbuckle comes from its association with the Ariosa coffee package,\r\nwhich was the first successful national brand of package coffee. It was\r\nlaunched in 1873. The Ariosa premium list (premiums have been a feature\r\nof the Arbuckle business since 1895) includes a hundred articles. Almost\r\nanything from a pair of suspenders or a toothbrush, to clocks, wringers,\r\nand corsets may be obtained in exchange for Ariosa coupons.\r\n\r\nThe common belief that the name Ariosa was made up from the words Rio\r\nand Santos (said to be the component parts of the original blend) is\r\nerroneous. It was arbitrarily coined, though it is not known what\r\nconsiderations prompted it. One story has it that the \"A\" stands for\r\nArbuckle, the \"rio\" for Rio, and the \"sa\" for South America.\r\n\r\nEarly in the seventies, the great business opportunities of New York\r\nCity had attracted the two brothers, and a branch was established in New\r\nYork in charge of John Arbuckle, the main business in Pittsburg being\r\nleft in the care of his brother Charles. The growth of the New York\r\nbranch soon made it necessary for Charles Arbuckle to leave the\r\nPittsburg business in charge of trusted employees, and to come to New\r\nYork. In time, the coffee business of the New York house overshadowed\r\nthe grocery lines; and the latter were abandoned there, so that the\r\nentire energy of the firm in New York might be devoted to the coffee\r\nbusiness, which thenceforth was operated under the firm name of Arbuckle\r\nBros. The Arbuckle coffee business, which began with a single roaster in\r\n1865, had eighty-five machines running in Pittsburg and New York in\r\n1881.\r\n\r\nCharles Arbuckle died in 1891, and John Arbuckle admitted as partners\r\nhis nephew, William Arbuckle Jamison, and two employees, William V.R.\r\nSmith and James N. Jarvie, the business continuing under the former name\r\nof Arbuckle Bros. The most important step taken by the firm while thus\r\nconstituted was its entrance into the sugar refining business in 1896.\r\nThat entrance had to be forced against the bitterest opposition of a\r\nso-called sugar trust, and brought on a \"war\" signalized by the most\r\nruthless cutting of prices of both coffee and sugar. This war was costly\r\nto both sides; but when it had ended, Arbuckle Bros. remained unshaken\r\nin the preeminence of their package-coffee business and had acquired\r\nalso great publicity and a fine trade in refined sugar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN ARBUCKLE]\r\n\r\nArbuckles were always large consumers of sugar in connection with their\r\ncoffee glaze, and having introduced the package sugar idea with their\r\ncustomers some years before, they at last made up their minds to refine\r\nfor their own needs and thus to save the profits paid to \"the\r\nHavemeyers\". It is generally conceded that John Arbuckle's shrewdness\r\nand business sagacity in having previously acquired the Smyser patents\r\non a weighing and packing machine, and his control of it, really led to\r\nthe coffee-sugar war. \"This packing machine\", said the _Spice Mill_,\r\nwhen Henry E. Smyser died in 1899, \"puts him [Smyser] with the greatest\r\ninventors of our day.\"\r\n\r\nThe sugar trust met the Arbuckle challenge by invading the\r\ncoffee-roasting field. This they accomplished by securing a controlling\r\ninterest for $2,000,000 in one of the largest competing roasting plants\r\nin the country, that of the Woolson Spice Co., of Toledo, Ohio, that had\r\nin the Lion brand, a ready-made package coffee wherewith to fight\r\nAriosa. The re-organization of the Woolson Spice Co. in 1897, when A. M.\r\nWoolson was relieved of the office of president, disclosed, among\r\nothers, the names of Hermann Sielcken in close juxtaposition to that of\r\nH.O. Havemeyer on the board of directors. Both men helped to make\r\ncoffee-trade history.\r\n\r\nThe trade found the coffee-sugar war the all-absorbing topic for several\r\nyears. Hot debates were held on the question as to whether, on one hand,\r\nthe Arbuckles had the right to enter the sugar-refining business and, on\r\nthe other, as to whether the sugar-trust had a right to retaliate. The\r\nanswer seemed to be \"yes\" in both instances.\r\n\r\nIn two years, John Arbuckle's model sugar refinery in Brooklyn was\r\nturning out package sugar at the rate of five thousand barrels a day.\r\nThe Woolson Spice Co. was credited with spending unheard-of sums of\r\nmoney in advertising Lion brand coffee. The eastern newspaper displays\r\nalone exceeded anything ever before attempted in this line. However,\r\nmany people are of the opinion that it was a tactical error on the part\r\nof the sugar interests to spend so much money advertising a Rio coffee\r\nin the central and New England states, while John Arbuckle was confining\r\nhis activities to the south and the west, where there already existed a\r\nRio taste among consumers.\r\n\r\nThe legal fight which the Arbuckles carried on with the Havemeyers for\r\nthe control of the sugar business in this celebrated coffee-sugar war is\r\nsaid to have cost millions on both sides.\r\n\r\nEventually, the Havemeyers were glad to be relieved of their coffee\r\ninterests, but John Arbuckle continued to sell both coffee and sugar.\r\n\r\nMr. Arbuckle married Miss Mary Alice Kerr in Pittsburg, in 1868. She\r\ndied in 1907. His many charities included boat trips for children,\r\nluxurious farm vacations for tired wage-earners, boat-raising and\r\nlife-saving schemes, a low-priced home for working girls and men on an\r\nold full-rigged ship lying off a New York dock, which he called his\r\n\"Deep Sea Hotel,\" and a vacation enterprise for young men and young\r\nwomen at New Paltz, N.Y., which was known as the \"Mary and John Arbuckle\r\nFarm.\" A magazine for children, called _Sunshine_, was another\r\nbenevolent enterprise of his.\r\n\r\nWhen John Arbuckle died at his Brooklyn home, March 27, 1912, he had\r\nbeen ill only four days. The New York Coffee Exchange closed at two\r\no'clock the day following, after adopting appropriate resolutions and\r\nappointing a committee to attend the funeral. His estate in New York was\r\nvalued at $33,000,000.\r\n\r\nW.V.R. Smith and James N. Jarvie retired from the firm in 1906; and John\r\nArbuckle and his nephew W.A. Jamison continued it as sole owners and\r\npartners until Mr. Arbuckle's death in 1912. Mr. Arbuckle died childless\r\nand a widower, leaving as his only heirs his two sisters, Mrs. Catherine\r\nArbuckle Jamison and Miss Christina Arbuckle. Mrs. Jamison is the widow\r\nof the late Robert Jamison, who had been a prominent drygoods merchant\r\nin Pittsburg. William A. Jamison is her eldest and only living son.\r\nFollowing the death of John Arbuckle, a new partnership was formed in\r\nwhich Mrs. Jamison, Miss Arbuckle, and Mr. Jamison became the partners\r\nand owners, and that partnership, without change of name, continues.\r\nProbably there is no other mercantile establishment of similar size in\r\nthe country that is carried on as a partnership, and none which after\r\nmore than sixty years is so exclusively owned by members of the\r\nimmediate family of its founders.\r\n\r\nThe Arbuckle business, as it is today, is John Arbuckle's best monument.\r\nAll that it is he foresaw; for behind those keen, penetrating eyes,\r\nthere was wonderful vision. Simple in his tastes; democratic in his\r\ndress, in his habits and his speech; he was one of the most approachable\r\nof our first captains of industry. Many of the younger generation in the\r\ncoffee business have found inspiration in contemplating John Arbuckle's\r\nachievements. As represented in what has been called \"the world's\r\ngreatest coffee business\", these include other package coffees, such as\r\nYuban, Arbuckle's Breakfast, Arbuckle's Drinksum, and Arbuckle's\r\nCertified Java and Mocha. The pioneer Ariosa brand is still being sold;\r\nalthough it is interesting to note that the demand for ground Ariosa is\r\nincreasing, marking the swing of the pendulum of public taste away from\r\nthe original bean package to the so-called \"steel-cut,\" or ground,\r\ncoffee package. Will it swing back again, some day? Many coffee men\r\nbelieve it will. If it does, good old Ariosa, with its coating of sugar\r\nand eggs, will no doubt be on the job to meet it.\r\n\r\nYuban was launched in the fall of 1913. It is a high-grade package\r\ncoffee, whereas Ariosa is popular-priced. In addition to the package\r\ncoffee business, Arbuckle Bros. have many other activities. They deal in\r\ngreen coffee as well as roasted coffee in bulk. The wholesale grocery\r\nbusiness in Pittsburg continues under the old name of Arbuckles & Co.;\r\nwhile in Chicago, Arbuckle Bros. have a branch equipped with a\r\ncoffee-roasting-and-packaging plant, also spice-grinding and\r\nextract-manufacturing plants, and do a large business in teas. A branch\r\nin Kansas City distributes the products manufactured in New York and\r\nChicago. In Brazil, offices are maintained at Rio de Janeiro, Santos,\r\nand Victoria, as Arbuckle & Co. In Mexico, Arbuckle Bros. are\r\nestablished at Jalapa, with branches at Cordoba and Coatepec. In season,\r\nthe warehouses and hulling plants at those points employ as many as 650\r\nhands preparing Mexican coffee for shipment to New York.\r\n\r\nArbuckle Bros. are direct importers of green coffee on a large scale,\r\nand are known also as heavy buyers \"on the street.\" The roasting\r\ncapacity of their Brooklyn plant is from 8,000 to 9,000 bags per day.\r\nThe cylinder equipment of twenty-four Burns roasters is supplemented by\r\nfour \"Jumbo\" roasters of Arbuckle build, each capable of roasting\r\nthirty-five bags at one time. The Ariosa package business grew from the\r\nsmallest beginnings to more than 800,000 packages per day. Individual\r\nbrands have not held their lead of late years; but the volume of\r\npackage-coffee business is greater than ever. Many jobbers now pack\r\nbrands of their own, besides handling the Arbuckle brands.\r\n\r\nDistribution of roasted coffees outside Chicago and Kansas City is\r\naccomplished through the medium of more than one hundred stock depots\r\nin as many different cities of the United States.\r\n\r\nTo operate the world's greatest coffee business is no small undertaking;\r\nand when this is coupled with an important sugar-refining business and a\r\nwaterfront warehouse-and-terminal business, plenty of room is needed. So\r\nwe find the plant along the Brooklyn waterfront occupying an area of a\r\ndozen city blocks. An idea of the extent and diversity of the activities\r\nof the plant may be gained from a brief reference to the utilities, and\r\nthe trades, and even the professions, that are required to make the\r\nwheels go round.\r\n\r\nTo ship more than one hundred cars of coffee and sugar in a single day\r\ncalls for shipping facilities that could be had only by organizing a\r\nrailroad and waterfront terminal, known as Jay Street Terminal, equipped\r\nwith freight station, locomotives, tugboats, steam lighters, car floats,\r\nand barges. City deliveries of coffee and sugar call for a fleet of\r\nthirty-five large motor trucks that are housed in the firm's own garage\r\nand kept in repair in their own shops. Although motor trucks are fast\r\nreplacing the faithful horse; and the time will never come again when\r\nArbuckle Bros. will boast of their stable of nearly two hundred horses\r\nthat were generally acknowledged to be the finest string of draft horses\r\nin the city, some fifty or sixty of their faithful animals still are in\r\nharness; and so the stable, with blacksmith shop, harness shop, and\r\nwagon-repair shops, are serving their respective purposes, though on a\r\nreduced scale. A printing shop vibrates with the whirr of mammoth\r\nprinting presses turning out thousands upon thousands of coffee-wrappers\r\nand circulars; and doubtless it will be news to many that the first\r\nthree-color printing press ever built was expressly designed and built\r\nfor Arbuckle Bros. Then there is a sunny first-aid hospital on top of\r\nthe Pearl Street warehouse where a physician is ever ready to relieve\r\nsudden illness and accidental injuries. On the eleventh floor there is a\r\nhuge dining room where the Brooklyn clerical forces get their noonday\r\nlunches. This feeding of the inner man (and woman) is matched by the\r\npower-house where twenty-six large steam boilers must be fed their quota\r\nof coal. In the winter months, when Warmth must come for the workers as\r\nwell as power for the wheels, the coal consumption runs up as high as\r\nfour hundred tons per day.\r\n\r\nThe barrel factory, with a daily capacity of 6,800 sugar barrels, is\r\nlocated about a mile away, where barrel staves and heads are received\r\nfrom the firm's own stave mill in Virginia, made from logs cut on their\r\nown timber lands in Virginia and North Carolina. A more self-contained\r\nplant would be hard to imagine, and so we find that even the last\r\nactivity in its operations--that of washing and drying the emptied sugar\r\nbags--is also provided for. That this is \"some laundry\" goes without\r\nsaying, when it is recalled that in the busy sugar season the firm dumps\r\nfrom eight to ten thousand bags of raw sugar per day, and that these\r\nbags are washed and dried daily as emptied. A huge rotary drier of the\r\nfirm's own design does the work of about three miles of clothes lines.\r\n\r\nEven after the coffees have been sold and paid for, there still remains\r\nan important task, and that is to redeem the signature coupons which the\r\nconsumers cut from the packages and return for premiums. Lest some\r\nregard this as an insignificant phase of the business, it may be stated\r\nthat in a single year the premium department has received over one\r\nhundred and eight million coupons calling for more than four million\r\npremiums. These premiums included 818,928 handkerchiefs; 261,000 pairs\r\nof lace curtains; 238,738 shears; and 185,920 Torrey razors. Finger\r\nrings are perennial favorites, and so insistent is the demand for the\r\nrings offered as premiums, that Arbuckle Bros. are regarded as the\r\nlargest distributors of finger rings in the world. One of their premium\r\nrings is a wedding ring; and if all the rings of this pattern serve\r\ntheir intended purpose, it is estimated that the firm has assisted at\r\neighty thousand weddings in a year.\r\n\r\nTurning from the utilities at the plant to the trades and professions\r\nrepresented, other than the trained sugar and coffee workers, the\r\nfollowing are constantly employed: physicians, chemists, mechanical\r\nengineers, civil engineers, electrical engineers, railroad engineers and\r\nbrakemen, steamboat captains and engineers, chauffeurs, teamsters,\r\nwagon-makers, harness-makers, machinists, draughtsmen, blacksmiths,\r\ntinsmiths, coppersmiths, coopers, carpenters, masons, painters,\r\nplumbers, riggers, typesetters and pressmen, and last but not least,\r\nthe chef and table waiters.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable things about the growth of this business\r\nenterprise is that it is not the result of buying out, or consolidating\r\nwith, competitors; but has resulted from a steady wholesome growth along\r\nconservative business lines. Consolidations are often desirable and\r\neffective; but when a great business has been built without any such\r\nconsolidations, the conclusion is inevitable that somewhere in the\r\nestablishment there must have been a corresponding amount of wisdom,\r\nforesight, energy, and honorable business dealing. Those were the things\r\nfor which John Arbuckle stood firm, and for which he will always be\r\nremembered.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jabez Burns, Inventor, Manufacturer, Writer_\r\n\r\nJabez Burns was a person of real importance to the American coffee trade\r\nfrom 1864, when he began to manufacture his improved roaster, until his\r\ndeath, at the age of sixty-two, in 1888. His success depended more on\r\nunusual character than unusual ability, although he was really gifted as\r\nregards mechanical invention. He loved to acquire practical information,\r\nand arrived confidently at common-sense conclusions; and he exercised a\r\nwide and helpful influence, because he liked to give expression to\r\nopinions that he considered sound and useful.\r\n\r\nMr. Burns was born in London in 1826. The family moved soon after to\r\nDundee, Scotland, and came to New York in 1844. They were people of\r\nsmall means and independent thinking. The father, William G. Burns, had\r\nbeen more interested in the Chartist social movement than in any settled\r\nbusiness activity. An uncle, also named Jabez Burns, became a popular\r\nBaptist preacher in London.\r\n\r\nThe first winter in America found youthful Jabez teaching a country\r\nschool at Summit, N.J. Then he began in New York (1844-45) as teamster\r\nfor Henry Blair, a prosperous coffee merchant who attended a little\r\n\"Disciples\" church in lower Sixth Avenue where many Scottish families\r\ncongregated. There also Burns met Agnes Brown, daughter of a Paisley\r\nweaver, and married her in 1847. A brave young pair they were, who found\r\nall sorts of odd riches--just as if a fast-growing family could somehow\r\nmake up for a slow-growing income. There were hopes, too, that the\r\ncontrivances Burns kept inventing might bring wealth; and some extra\r\nmoney did come from the sale of early patents, including one in 1858 for\r\nthe Burns Addometer, a primitive adding machine.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Burns had continued regularly in the employ of coffee and spice\r\nfirms, and at one time he was bookkeeper for Thomas Reid's Globe Mills.\r\nHe advanced slowly, because he lacked real trading talent; but he was\r\nlearning all about the handling of goods, from purchase to final\r\ndelivery; and when he quit bookkeeping for the old Globe Mills, and\r\nbegan to build his patent roaster, he could advise clients reliably\r\nabout every factory detail.\r\n\r\nHe was soon looked on as an authority. He wrote some articles for the\r\n_American Grocer_, a series on \"Food Adulteration\" being reprinted; and\r\nin 1878, he began the quarterly publication of his thirty-two-page\r\n_Spice Mill_, which soon became a monthly, and gained the interested\r\nattention of practically the entire coffee and spice trade.\r\n\r\nThrough the columns of this paper, in circulars, by letters, and in a\r\npocket volume called the _Spice Mill Companion_, he distributed\r\ninformation on coffee, spices, and baking powder, and gave valuable\r\nadvice to beginners in the coffee-roasting business. Not a few coffee\r\nroasters were started on the way to fortune by the counsel of Jabez\r\nBurns. He died in New York, September 16, 1888.\r\n\r\nJabez Burns founded the business of Jabez Burns & Sons in 1864,\r\nbeginning the manufacture of his patent coffee roaster at 107 Warren\r\nStreet, New York. Since then, there have been four removals. In\r\nDecember, 1908, the business moved to its present uptown location, at\r\nthe northwest corner of Eleventh Avenue and Forty-third Street,\r\noccupying a six-story building which was doubled in size in 1917. This\r\nBurns factory has been referred to as \"the unique coffee-machinery\r\nworkshop\", the greatest establishment of its kind in the United States.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of its founder the business was continued; first, as the\r\nfirm of Jabez Burns & Sons, composed of his sons, Jabez, Robert, and A.\r\nLincoln Burns; and later, in 1906, incorporated as Jabez Burns & Sons,\r\nInc., with Robert Burns as president, Jabez Burns as vice-president,\r\nand A. Lincoln Burns as secretary and treasurer. Jabez Burns died August\r\n6, 1908. The present officers are: Robert Burns, president; A. Lincoln\r\nBurns, vice-president; William G. Burns, general manager; and C.H.\r\nMaclachlan, secretary and treasurer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JABEZ BURNS]\r\n\r\nA. Lincoln Burns succeeded his father as editor of the _Spice Mill_.\r\nWilliam H. Ukers was made editor in 1902, and he continued until 1904,\r\nwhen he left to assume editorial direction of _The Tea and Coffee Trade\r\nJournal_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee-Trade Booms and Panics_\r\n\r\nIn the last fifty years there have been many spectacular attempts to\r\ncorner the coffee market in Europe and the United States. The first\r\nnotable occurrence of this kind did not originate in the trade itself.\r\nIt took place in 1873, and was known as the \"Jay Cooke panic\", being\r\nbrought about by the famous panic of that name in the stock market.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the Jay Cooke failure, it was impossible to obtain money\r\nfrom the banks. Hence buyers were forced to keep out of the coffee\r\nmarket; and as a consequence, the price for Rios dropped from\r\ntwenty-four cents to fifteen cents in the course of the trading period\r\nof one day[349].\r\n\r\nAnother interesting development during that year was of foreign origin.\r\nA coffee syndicate was organized in Europe, financed by the powerful\r\nGerman Trading Company of Frankfort, with agencies in London, Rotterdam,\r\nAntwerp, and Brazil. For more than eight years this proved to be a\r\nhighly successful undertaking, largely controlling the principal\r\nproducing and consuming markets.\r\n\r\nAs far as the American coffee trade is concerned, the first sensational\r\nupheaval took place in 1880-81. This period witnessed the collapse of\r\nthe first great coffee trade combination in this country--the so-called\r\n\"syndicate\", comprising O.G. Kimball, B.G. Arnold, and Bowie Dash,\r\nsometimes known as the \"trinity\".\r\n\r\nThe period of high coffee prices, commencing in 1870, had greatly\r\nstimulated production in many Mild-coffee producing countries, as well\r\nas in Brazil, and as a consequence the syndicate found its burden\r\nbecoming extremely heavy early in 1880. In January of that year our\r\nvisible supply amounted roughly to 767,000 bags. While this was reduced\r\nto about 740,000 bags in July, the latter likewise proved to be\r\ndecidedly burdensome, especially as another liberal crop was beginning\r\nto move in producing countries. The excessive volume of supplies was\r\nespecially marked, because distributing trade during the summer was\r\nstrikingly dull, as the majority of buyers were holding off, in view of\r\nthe prospective liberal new crops. At that time Java coffee was a big\r\nitem in American markets, whereas Santos was just about beginning to be\r\na factor.\r\n\r\nThe syndicate found that it had its hands full supporting the Brazil\r\ngrades, and hence had to let the Javas go. As a result, the latter,\r\nwhich had sold at twenty-four and three-quarters cents in January, 1880,\r\nfell to nineteen and one-half cents in July, to eighteen cents in\r\nNovember and to sixteen cents in December. As a matter of fact, the\r\nsyndicate was practically the only buyer of Brazil coffee during the\r\nfall of 1880; and as a consequence, Rios, which had started the year at\r\nfourteen and one-half to sixteen and one-quarter cents, were down to\r\ntwelve and three-quarters cents in December, 1880, and had dropped nine\r\nand one-half cents when the break in the market culminated in June,\r\n1881.\r\n\r\nThe first whispers of financial troubles growing out of these adverse\r\nconditions were heard in October, 1880; and on the 27th of that month\r\nthe first failure was announced--that of C. Risley & Co., with\r\nliabilities placed at $800,000 and assets at $400,000. This firm had\r\nbeen doing business in the local market for about thirty years. The\r\nefforts of the receivers to dispose of this company's large stock\r\nnaturally served to accelerate the decline; and the final impetus came\r\non December 6, when the New York trade heard of the death, two days\r\npreviously, of O.G. Kimball, of Boston, one of the most prominent\r\nmerchants there. This precipitated the big crash of December 7, when\r\nB.G. Arnold & Co., the largest New York firm, suspended with estimated\r\nliabilities of $750,000 to $1,000,000. The official statement later\r\nplaced the liabilities at $2,157,914, and assets at $1,400,000, of which\r\n$884,198 were secured. Within three days this failure was followed by\r\nthe suspension of Bowie Dash & Co., with liabilities estimated at\r\n$1,400,000.\r\n\r\nFor weeks thereafter there was virtually no market. With all of these\r\ndistress holdings pressing for liquidation, buyers, as was natural, were\r\nextremely timid. In the meantime, the import arrivals showed further\r\nenlargement at various southern ports, as well as at New York. Total\r\narrivals at this port during 1881 were almost 12,400,000 pounds heavier\r\nthan for the preceding year. The growing importance of Santos as a\r\nmarket factor was demonstrated by the fact that shipments from there in\r\n1881 were 1,198,625 bags, compared with about 628,900 bags in 1876-77.\r\nAccording to the best informed members of the trade at that time, the\r\nlosses sustained by the various firms that were forced to the wall\r\naggregated between $5,000,000 and $7,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe utterly demoralized conditions prevailing while this collapse was in\r\nprogress, and the practical elimination of a market in the true sense of\r\nthe word, furnished the principal impetus for the organization of the\r\nNew York Coffee Exchange. At that time, the Havre market was the only\r\none with an exchange. The local body was organized in December, 1881,\r\nand started business in March, 1882.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cable Break of 1884_\r\n\r\nThe second noteworthy movement, embracing an advance of four to four and\r\none-half cents and a recession of slightly more than three cents,\r\ncovered a period of about eight months shortly after the Exchange was\r\norganized. Various local and out-of-town firms were interested in the\r\nbulge which carried Rio coffee in this market from about seven cents in\r\nJuly, 1883, up to eleven and one-half cents late in November. By the\r\nmiddle of December, the price had fallen to nine and one-quarter cents,\r\nthe final break to eight and one-quarter cents occurring late in March\r\nof the following year. At that time, there was no direct cable\r\ncommunication with Brazil; and as a result of a temporary break in the\r\nroundabout service by way of Portugal, the New York and Baltimore agents\r\nof the Brazilian syndicate were unable to put up additional margins in\r\nthis market, and their accounts were closed out. This happened on a\r\nSaturday; and by the following Monday, partial cable remittances arrived\r\nand all accounts were settled in full with interest from Saturday to\r\nMonday.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Great Boom_\r\n\r\nWhat is generally described as \"the great boom\" of the coffee trade\r\noccurred in 1886-87, and had its inception in unsatisfactory crop news\r\nfrom Brazil. The crop of 1887-1888, it was estimated, would be extremely\r\nsmall; and it turned out to be only 3,033,000 bags. These advices and\r\nlow estimates led to the formation of a \"bull\" clique, comprising\r\noperators in New York, Chicago, New Orleans, Brazil, and Europe, who set\r\na price of twenty-five cents for December contracts as their goal.\r\nToward the end of June, 1886, when this campaign started, No. 7 Rio in\r\nNew York was worth about seven and one-half cents, with June contracts\r\non the Exchange quoted at seven and sixty-five hundredths cents. With\r\nBrazilian crop news still more discouraging, the advance thereafter was\r\nalmost continuous, and on June 1, 1887, December contracts sold at\r\ntwenty-two and one-quarter cents--a new high price record, that was not\r\nexceeded for thirty-two years, when twenty-four and sixty-five\r\nhundredths cents were paid for July contracts in June, 1919. After\r\nreaching twenty-two and one-quarter cents, prices suffered an abrupt\r\nreversal. Ten days later the closing price for December was twenty-one\r\nand four-tenth cents. Then the real crash began. On Saturday, June 11,\r\nthe panic started with another claim of cable trouble; and in the short\r\nsession, December coffee broke from twenty and fifteen-hundredths to\r\neighteen and sixty-five hundredths cents, closing at a loss for the day\r\nof 275 points. The first sale of December on Monday was at seventeen and\r\nfour-tenths cents, or 125 points lower; and after numerous erratic\r\nvariations, the price broke to sixteen cents, a drop of six and\r\none-quarter cents in less than two weeks. Business on that day was of\r\nenormous volume, in round numbers 412,000 bags; and approximately\r\n$1,500,000 was put up in margins. For the next three days the decline\r\nwas temporarily halted, and December, at one time, was up three and\r\none-quarter cents from the bottom (nineteen and one-quarter cents). On\r\nJune 17, another battle commenced, December dropping back to seventeen\r\ncents. Then came a rally to eighteen and one-tenth cents, a drop to\r\nsixteen and one-half cents; another rally to eighteen and one-tenth,\r\nand, on June 24, another break to the previous low level of sixteen\r\ncents for December. This sharp reversal in less than a month was\r\ntraceable largely to more favorable news from Brazil, the 1888-89 crop\r\nbeing estimated at 6,827,000 bags.\r\n\r\nFollowing a rally to nineteen and six-tenths cents during the next month\r\n(July, 1887), the pendulum again swung downward. The climax came with\r\nthe culmination of the \"European fiasco\" of the spring of 1888. Reports\r\nwere received that various European coffee firms had failed; and future\r\ncontracts in the American market sold as low as nine cents in March.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Famous European Bull Campaign_\r\n\r\nThe next campaign of interest lasted more than two and a half years. In\r\nSeptember, 1891, there was a corner in the local market which forced the\r\nSeptember price up to seventeen and one-quarter cents. George\r\nKaltenbach, a wealthy speculator living in Paris, combining with three\r\noperators in Havre, Hamburg, and Antwerp, succeeded in breaking the\r\ncorner, forcing the price down to ten and eight-tenths cents. They then\r\nchanged to the bull side, buying heavily in all markets of the world.\r\nThis was continued until early in 1893, bringing the price back to\r\nfifteen cents. Although his associates then returned to the bear side,\r\nKaltenbach kept on buying; and aided by bad crop reports from Brazil, he\r\nworked the price up as high as seventeen and seven-tenths cents. At one\r\ntime it was said that his profits were more than one million dollars.\r\nThe collapse of this deal occurred in May, 1893, involving thirty firms\r\nin Hamburg, Havre, and Rotterdam. As Kaltenbach could not keep his large\r\nNew York holdings margined, they were thrown on the market, bringing\r\nabout a sharp break, and causing the failure of his New York agents,\r\nT.M. Barr & Co.\r\n\r\nThe present era of large crops began in 1894, Brazil's production for\r\n1894-95 being placed at 6,695,000 bags. Nevertheless, Guzman Blanco, a\r\nformer president of Venezuela, then living in Paris, and said to be\r\nworth about $20,000,000, attempted to run a corner in April, 1895. He\r\nbought 200,000 bags of spot coffee in Havre warehouses and accumulated a\r\nbig line of futures in various markets. Assisted by reports of cholera\r\nin Rio and some reduction in Brazilian crops, he enjoyed temporary\r\nsuccess, the price of Rio 7s in New York rising to fifteen and one-half\r\ncents in October, 1895. Thereafter, there was an almost continuous\r\ndecline. In the spring of 1898, a vigorous bear campaign was conducted,\r\nlargely in the form of market letters; and by November, Rio 7s here had\r\ndropped to four and one-half cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Bubonic Plague Boom_\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"bubonic plague boom\" halted this prolonged downward\r\nmovement for a time in 1899-1900. The boom derived its name from the\r\noutbreak of bubonic plague in Brazil, as a result of which the ports of\r\nthat country were quarantined. In addition, Brazilian steamers arriving\r\nat New York were placed in quarantine; and the impossibility of\r\nunloading their cargoes caused a temporary shortage. As a result, prices\r\nrose from four and one-quarter cents in September, 1899, to eight and\r\none-quarter cents in July, 1900. The quarantine being lifted, the bears\r\nagain became aggressive; and by April, 1901, they had forced the price\r\nback to five cents.\r\n\r\nThere was another short-lived attempt to establish a corner in\r\nSeptember, 1901. Receipts at Rio and Santos had been running light,\r\nencouraging a local clique embracing Skiddy, Minford & Company; W.H.\r\nCrossman & Bro.; and Gruner & Company, to endeavor to gain control. The\r\narrivals at Brazilian ports suddenly increased to the largest volume\r\never known up to that time; and, with vigorous opposition from operators\r\nin Havre, the corner here was speedily broken.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the new century witnessed the beginning of another new\r\ncoffee era, Santos permanently displacing Rio as the world's largest\r\nsource of supply. The figures for 1900-01 were: Santos, 2,945,000 bags;\r\nRio, 2,413,000 bags.\r\n\r\nHuge crops then became a regular thing in Brazil. That of 1901-02 was\r\nfar in excess of estimates, being 15,000,000 bags; while 20,000,000 bags\r\nwere produced in 1902-03. As a result, the world's coffee trade became\r\ncompletely demoralized for the time being. In August, 1902, contracts\r\nfor July, 1903, delivery sold at six and one-tenths cents. By June,\r\n1903, they had fallen to three and fifty-five hundredths cents, the\r\nlowest price ever recorded for coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Southern Boom_\r\n\r\nAs is invariably the case when prices reach extreme levels, either high\r\nor low, the pendulum swung back rapidly in the other direction. Based on\r\nthe unprecedentedly low prices, the so-called \"cotton crowd\" started\r\nwhat was generally known as \"the southern boom\". Various cotton traders\r\nin New York and the South, under the leadership of D.J. Sully, the\r\none-time \"cotton king\", and ably assisted by prominent local coffee\r\nfirms, became extremely active on the buying side; and by February,\r\n1904, they had forced the price up to eleven and eighty-five hundredths\r\ncents. This figure, the highest since 1896, was reached on February 2,\r\nwhich proved to be another day of enormous speculative dealings,\r\ninvolving roundly 462,000 bags. This marked another turning point; the\r\nthree succeeding days of record-breaking operations on the Exchange\r\nwitnessing a break of roughly two cents. Mr. Sully went on a vacation on\r\nFebruary 3, and the Sielcken interests sold on a large scale. Business\r\nfor that day was placed at 555,000 bags, closing prices being about\r\none-half cent lower. This brought on enormous liquidation by western\r\nbulls on the following day, approximately 500,000 bags. As a result,\r\nprices lost twenty-five to sixty-five points on a turn-over of about\r\n642,000 bags. All records for business were smashed on the following\r\nday, February 5. The official record was 689,000 bags, but trade\r\nestimates made it more than 1,000,000 bags. On that day, southern\r\ninterests liquidated heavily, causing net losses of eighty to ninety\r\npoints. Doubtless the break would have been more severe had it not been\r\nfor buying by the Sielcken people and several other strong interests at\r\nand below seven and one-quarter cents for September contracts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Story of Valorization_\r\n\r\nThe valorization, or equalization, of coffee originated in Brazil. When\r\nthe original plan was threatened with disaster, Hermann Sielcken stepped\r\nin and saved the Brazil planters from ruin; the Brazil government from\r\npossible revolution; and, incidentally, won for himself and those who\r\nwere his partners in the enterprise much unenviable notoriety.\r\n\r\nThe principle of valorization is generally conceded to be economically\r\nunsound, because it encourages overproduction. And valorization in\r\nBrazil would have been a failure, had it not been for a fortuitous\r\ncombination of short crops, Hermann Sielcken's genius, and the World\r\nWar. Because of the lessons learned in this experience, Brazil's\r\nsubsequent valorization enterprises have run more smoothly.\r\n\r\nA rapidly increasing world demand, a wonderfully fertile soil, and cheap\r\nlabor kept the Brazil coffee industry in a flourishing condition nearly\r\nto the close of 1889. Coffee consumption was increasing, especially in\r\nthe United States. By April 1890, the average import price per pound of\r\nRio No. 7 in this country was nineteen cents; and Brazil was supplying\r\nonly about half our needs. Virgin soil was still available in Brazil,\r\nand immigration furnished all the needful labor. Easy profits led to\r\nincreased investment and careless methods. Her planters were drunk with\r\nprosperity. For six years, nearly all the three million inhabitants of\r\nSão Paulo, Brazil's largest coffee producing state, \"entirely gave up\r\nplanting corn, rice, beans, everything they needed. They bought them\r\nbecause coffee was so immensely profitable that they put all their labor\r\nin coffee.\"\r\n\r\nBrazil had been going through a period of low exchange. Paper money fell\r\nbelow par. The exaggerated issues of it, which provoked the collapse of\r\nexchange, suddenly endowed Brazil with an abundant circulation of money.\r\nProduction was enormously stimulated. New undertakings sprang up on\r\nevery hand. Armies of agricultural laborers were recruited in Europe and\r\nshipped into the coffee districts. And then, to make the story short,\r\nsupply passed demand, surplus stocks began to appear, prices began to\r\nfall, and fell until they dropped below the cost of production.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1896-97, when the new trees came into bearing by the tens and\r\nhundreds of thousands, that São Paulo's folly began to tell. By October\r\nof that year the price of Rio No. 7 in New York had fallen to about\r\nseven cents. The decline continued, until, in 1903, it hung around five\r\ncents. Then began the winter of São Paulo's discontent. Too late, the\r\nstate government tried by taxing new coffee estates, to force the\r\nplanters to raise crops to supply their own necessities. The times grew\r\nharder.\r\n\r\nMortgages held by large coffee houses and bankers were being foreclosed.\r\nThe industry was passing into European hands. The smaller planters were\r\nbecoming desperate; and desperation is only a step from revolution. The\r\ngovernment of the state of São Paulo knew this; and to save the state,\r\nit finally promised it would buy the next coffee crop, and would hold it\r\nfor the planters at such a price as would be necessary to continue the\r\nindustry. The protagonists of this plan to valorize coffee were Dr.\r\nJorge Tibiriçá, Dr. Augusto Ramos, and Dr. Albuquerque Lins.\r\n\r\nDuring all the period covering São Paulo's rise and fall in coffee, the\r\nfinancial genius who was to lead her again into the land of plenty had\r\nbeen quietly acquiring a knowledge of her problems--also, the ability to\r\nmake money out of their solution.\r\n\r\nValorization was undertaken to save the coffee industry. Its intent was\r\ngood, even if the theory was bad. The scheme was not new, and there were\r\nno encouraging precedents to augur its success. The situation was\r\ndesperate and seemed to justify the trial of a desperate remedy. São\r\nPaulo attempted to carry the load; but her resources were insufficient.\r\n\r\nThe bumper world crop of 19,090,000 bags in 1901-02 was followed, in\r\n1906-07, with another extraordinary yield of 24,307,000 bags, of which\r\nBrazil alone produced 20,192,000 bags. To make good its promise to the\r\nplanters, ready cash was needed; and so the São Paulo government sent a\r\nspecial commissioner to Europe to get it. For sixty years the\r\nRothschilds had acted as Brazil's bankers. The commissioner went to the\r\nRothschilds first. He was flatly refused. After that, he was turned down\r\nby practically every bank on the continent. It looked as if the bankers\r\nhad entered into a gentlemen's agreement to make it unanimous. Then the\r\ncommissioner bethought himself of the coffee merchants; and that thought\r\nnaturally suggested Hermann Sielcken, who, singularly enough, happened\r\nto be conveniently resting at nearby Baden-Baden. In August, 1906, the\r\ncommissioner waited upon Mr. Sielcken and begged his aid.\r\n\r\nIt was Sielcken's hour of triumph. For years he had been soliciting\r\nBrazil. Now the tables were turned, and Brazil was asking favors of\r\nSielcken.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the story is best told by Robert Sloss, who wrote it for\r\n_World's Work_ from information furnished by trade authorities--and even\r\nby Mr. Sielcken, himself, in various speeches, newspaper articles, and\r\non the witness stand. It is presented here with certain minor\r\ncorrections by the author:\r\n\r\n     \"Well, what do you want me to do?\" asked Hermann Sielcken of the\r\n     commissioner from the state of São Paulo.\r\n\r\n     \"We want you to finance for us five to eight million bags of\r\n     coffee,\" said the commissioner blandly.\r\n\r\n     Here was an adventure. Here was a proposition to lift bodily out of\r\n     the market half as much coffee as the world's total production had\r\n     averaged for the ten preceding years when prices had been so low.\r\n     Presumably, if this were done, prices would be doubled. But Hermann\r\n     Sielcken shook his head.\r\n\r\n     \"No,\" he said, \"there is not the slightest chance for it, not the\r\n     slightest.\" And then he pointed out that there would be \"no\r\n     financial assistance coming from anywhere\" if the São Paulo\r\n     planters kept on raising such ridiculously large crops of coffee.\r\n\r\n     The commissioner assured him that the prospect was for smaller\r\n     crops in future. Hermann Sielcken was not so sure about it \"At a\r\n     price low enough,\" he mused, \"I might be able to raise funds to pay\r\n     eighty percent on a value of seven cents a pound for Rio No. 5.\"\r\n\r\n     The commissioner was dismayed. His government had already promised\r\n     to take coffee from the planters at about a cent a pound above the\r\n     market, and the market then stood at nearly eight cents. The\r\n     government would have to dig to make up the difference. Hermann\r\n     Sielcken's terms were the best that could be got, however, and the\r\n     commissioner accepted them.\r\n\r\n     From that time forth Hermann Sielcken was the head of the movement.\r\n     He approached a few large coffee merchants, including his former\r\n     rivals, Arbuckle Brothers, and drew up a contract. The merchants\r\n     agreed to advance eighty percent of the sum required to buy two\r\n     million bags of coffee at seven cents a pound. If the market went\r\n     above seven cents, the government was to make no purchases. If it\r\n     fell below seven cents, the government was to make good the\r\n     difference to the merchants by cable.\r\n\r\n     Before the season was well advanced the unexpected happened. Brazil\r\n     was reaping the largest coffee harvest in the history of the world.\r\n     The two million bags of coffee purchased by the government were as\r\n     a drop in a bucket. Financed by Hermann Sielcken, Schroeder, the\r\n     great London banker, and a few prominent European merchants, the\r\n     government was forced to buy almost nine million bags. Toward the\r\n     end of 1907, the government had lifted half of the world's visible\r\n     supply of coffee, but the market stood only a trifle above six\r\n     cents a pound. The government was practically bankrupt.\r\n\r\n     Hermann Sielcken now enlisted the Rothschilds on his side, and\r\n     shifted the financial burden from the shoulders of the coffee\r\n     merchants to those of the Paris bankers and their American\r\n     associates. Then the Rothschilds imposed their conditions on the\r\n     government of Brazil. A national law was passed determining a heavy\r\n     penalty for any one who planted a new coffee tree in Brazil. The\r\n     government guaranteed that not more than mine million bags of the\r\n     next coffee crop and not more than ten million bags of any\r\n     succeeding crop should be exported.\r\n\r\n     By the end of 1911, the coffee market stood well above thirteen\r\n     cents. Here was a rise of more than one hundred percent in two\r\n     years, more than sixty percent in six months. Evidently,\r\n     valorization coffee in the hands of the bankers' committee had\r\n     become a gilt-edged security. But how?\r\n\r\n     During the five crop years since the \"plan\" was launched on the\r\n     heights above Baden, nearly 90,000,000 bags of coffee had been\r\n     raised in the world. The bankers' committee still held 5,108,000\r\n     bags of this. At the highest estimate, consumption had exceeded\r\n     production by only 4,000,000 bags. Here was a shortage of only a\r\n     little more than ten percent in supply as against demand, so far as\r\n     crops go. Yet there had been a rise of more than one hundred\r\n     percent in two years in the price of coffee on the New York Coffee\r\n     Exchange.... Upon the merchant's ability to deliver coffee on the\r\n     New York Coffee Exchange depends the price of coffee in the world.\r\n     That explains why the bankers' committee from the beginning refused\r\n     absolutely to sell valorization coffee on the public exchanges of\r\n     the world. In Europe, they put it up at auction; and when it didn't\r\n     go, it was bought in for them. In America, they announced in a\r\n     printed circular that valorization coffee would be sold only on\r\n     condition that the purchaser would not deliver it on the New York\r\n     Coffee Exchange.\r\n\r\n     Hermann Sielcken absolutely refused to sell coffee to the merchants\r\n     on the Exchange. Arbuckle Brothers kept on buying coffee heavily,\r\n     as if they would corner the market. They resold the coffee,\r\n     however, at private sales, exacting a written contract from the\r\n     buyer that he would not deliver the coffee on the New York Coffee\r\n     Exchange, or resell it to any one that would so deliver it. The\r\n     Coffee Exchange began an investigation, but nothing ever came of\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     Shortly after the valorization committee had apparently cleared up\r\n     $25,000,000 in one year, the restriction as to the delivery of\r\n     valorization coffee on the New York Coffee Exchange was officially\r\n     removed. Yet neither from Hermann Sielcken nor from Arbuckle\r\n     Brothers, it is charged, could one buy any coffee to deliver for\r\n     that purpose. In 1911, coffee rose to sixteen cents per pound.\r\n\r\nAt the end, it was found that the committee's holdings had been marketed\r\nat the various sales on a basis, for Santos 4s, from eight and\r\nfive-eighths cents minimum, to the final sale here forced by the United\r\nStates government, at which time the price realized was sixteen and\r\nthree-quarter cents for Santos 4s, and fourteen cents for Rio 7s.\r\n\r\nThe one fly in the valorization ointment was Senator G.W. Norris, of\r\nNebraska, who early in 1911 called for a congressional investigation of\r\nthe operations of the valorization syndicate, which he said was costing\r\nthe American people $35,000,000 a year. The attorney-general was\r\ninstructed to report as to whether or not there was a coffee trust. It\r\nwas a leisurely investigation, which encountered many snags placed in\r\nits way by those who believed it would be against international policy\r\nto question too closely the participation of the Brazil government in\r\nthe enterprise. Politics played no inconsiderable part in the\r\ninvestigation, which dragged along until May 18, 1912, when an action\r\nwas begun in the Federal District Court for the southern district of New\r\nYork, alleging conspiracy in restraint of trade on the part of Hermann\r\nSielcken; Bruno Schroeder, of J. Henry Schroeder & Co.; Edouard Bunge;\r\nthe Vicomte des Touches; Dr. Paulo da Silva Prado; Theodor Wille; the\r\nSociété Generale; and the New York Dock Co.; also praying for injunction\r\nand receivership of the valorization coffee then stored in the United\r\nStates, and amounting to 746,539 bags. The injunction was denied.\r\n\r\nImmediately thereafter, rumors began to circulate that the government's\r\ncoffee suit would never be tried. The Brazilian ambassador threatened\r\ndiplomatic interference, and Attorney-General Wickersham let it be known\r\nthat a friendly settlement might be effected. Sielcken boldly challenged\r\nthe authorities to prosecute the case, and even seemed to invite\r\ncriminal proceedings against himself. Saving the government's face, and\r\nBrazil's face, at one and the same time, proved to be a long and tedious\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Senator Norris introduced in Congress a bill designed to give\r\nthe government power to seize importations of coffee when restraint of\r\ntrade was proved. It was vigorously opposed by many prominent\r\ngreen-coffee men and roasters; but in February, 1913, it became enacted\r\ninto a law. It effectively killed all future valorization schemes in so\r\nfar as direct participation by this country is concerned.\r\n\r\nAbout December 1, 1912, Attorney-General Wickersham accepted good-faith\r\nassurances from Mr. Sielcken's attorney--who represented also the Brazil\r\ngovernment--and agreed that if the valorization coffee stored here was\r\nsold to bona-fide purchasers before April 1, 1913, the government's suit\r\nwould be dismissed. In May, 1913, the attorney-general of the new Wilson\r\nadministration, which came into office in March of that year, issued a\r\nstatement saying that, good-faith assurances having been received from\r\nthe Brazil government that the understanding was fulfilled in letter and\r\nspirit before the date set by the previous attorney-general, and the\r\nentire amount of coffee disposed of to eighty dealers in thirty-three\r\ncities, the suit would be dismissed.\r\n\r\nIn the United States Senate about the same time, Senator Norris renewed\r\nhis attack on \"the international coffee trust\". He charged that the\r\ncoffee sale was not as represented, but merely a transfer, and called\r\nupon the Department of Justice for the facts, with names of the alleged\r\npurchasers.\r\n\r\nAttorney-General McReynolds, on May 7, 1913, declined to send to the\r\nSenate the official correspondence in regard to the Brazil\r\ncoffee-valorization matter, because it was \"incompatible with the public\r\ninterests.\" He did, however, send other papers on the subject. The\r\nsecretary of state sent copies of some correspondence; but the documents\r\nwere not made public. This ended the matter, although Senator Norris\r\ncalled for a congressional investigation, charging that the\r\nattorney-general had been handed a \"gold brick\".\r\n\r\nSielcken contented himself with remarking that the suit was a mistake in\r\nthe first place, and that it was a foregone conclusion the government\r\nwould be defeated. Also, he offered $5,000 to any one who could explain\r\nthe Norris bill.\r\n\r\nValorization, then, was started by the state of São Paulo in 1905, when\r\na law was passed authorizing the state to enter into an agreement with\r\nthe other Brazil states and the federal government for the adoption of\r\nmeasures which would assure the valorization of coffee and facilitate a\r\npropaganda abroad for increased consumption.\r\n\r\nThe states of São Paulo, Minãs Geraes, and Rio de Janeiro proposed,\r\nearly in 1906, to withdraw from the markets such quantities of coffee as\r\nwould keep down exports and maintain profitable prices. The plan\r\ncomprehended the interested states borrowing about $75,000,000 from\r\nEuropean and United States bankers with which to buy up the surplus\r\ncoffee. To take care of interest and amortization, a tax of three francs\r\nper bag of 132 pounds (about 57 cents) was to be levied on all coffee\r\nexports, collectable at Santos and Rio de Janeiro. Further\r\ncoffee-planting was to be checked by enforcing the law which carried a\r\ntax sufficiently high to operate toward restriction.\r\n\r\nWhen it was understood that Brazil's federal government would not\r\nendorse the plan _in toto_, it was abandoned by Rio de Janeiro and Minãs\r\nGeraes. However, the state of São Paulo in the course of the next two\r\nyears borrowed some $30,000,00 on its own account for valorization\r\npurposes, obtaining half the amount direct from foreign banking\r\ninterests, and the remainder, through the Brazilian federal government,\r\nfrom London sources.\r\n\r\nThis first valorization was abandoned in favor of the Sielcken plan,\r\nwhich the federal government ratified in July, 1908. By this new plan\r\nSão Paulo borrowed $75,000,000 from the syndicate composed of American,\r\nEnglish, German, French, and Belgian bankers. Out of this it repaid the\r\n$30,000,000 loan. The 1908 loan was to expire in ten years, in 1919.\r\nUnder the plan of the new loan, it was agreed that certain amounts of\r\nthe valorized coffee should be stored as collateral in warehouses in\r\nNew York and Europe in charge of a committee of seven, who were\r\nauthorized to sell the coffee in the market in specified quantities and\r\nat prices that would not disturb the price of other coffees. The\r\ncomposition of the committee was as follows: Dr. Francisco Ferreira\r\nRamos, of São Paulo and Antwerp; who was succeeded by Dr. Paulo da Silva\r\nPrado; the Vicomte des Touches, of Havre; the Société Generale, of\r\nParis; the firm of Theodor Wille, of Hamburg; Hermann Sielcken, of New\r\nYork; Edouard Bunge, of Antwerp; and Baron Bruno Schroeder, of J. Henry\r\nSchroeder & Co., of London.\r\n\r\nBrazil agreed to purchase 10,000,000 bags and to hold them off the\r\nmarket until conditions warranted their sale. It was also agreed that\r\nthe total exports of unvalorized stocks from Brazil would be restricted\r\nto 10,000,000 bags for 1907-08, and to 10,500,000 bags for 1909-10. In\r\naddition, a surtax of five francs gold per bag (96-1/4 cents) was placed\r\non every bag exported to pay carrying charges. The management of the\r\ngovernment's holdings was placed in the hands of the international\r\ncommittee. This committee issued bonds which were quickly subscribed\r\nfor; and because of its efficient handling of its huge holdings, prices\r\nheld steady in spite of the record-breaking Brazilian crop of nearly\r\n20,192,000 bags in 1906-07, and a later one in 1909-10 of about\r\n15,000,000 bags. Indeed, there was an advance of about ten dollars a bag\r\nbetween 1904 and 1911.\r\n\r\nValorization had the effect of stabilizing the Brazil market, and giving\r\nthe planters and allied interests the assistance they needed to ward off\r\nthe disaster that threatened them through overproduction. The United\r\nStates government action in 1912 forced the sale of the valorized stocks\r\nheld in this country, and the Congress passed the law making it\r\nimpossible again to offer for sale in America stocks of coffee held\r\nunder similar valorization agreements.\r\n\r\nThe coffee situation became so serious in 1913, that São Paulo again\r\nentered the money market for another loan, borrowing $37,500,000 through\r\nthe good offices of the Brazilian federal government, following this up\r\ntwo years later with another loan of $21,000,000. According to a\r\nsemi-official statement issued in Brazil early in 1919, the status of\r\nvalorization at that time was that the first loan of $75,000,000 of\r\n1908, had been entirely liquidated, and the two later loans were greatly\r\nreduced. At the same time, it was announced by the president of the\r\nstate of São Paulo that the surtax of five frances would be withdrawn as\r\nsoon as the liquidation of the loans had been completed. This surtax,\r\nhowever, is still in effect. In 1919, the São Paulo government proposed\r\nadvancing the _pauta_, or export duty, very materially. A strong protest\r\nwas made by all the exporters; and a compromise was at last effected by\r\nwhich the proposed increase in the _pauta_ was canceled, and the\r\nexisting surtax of five francs per bag continued as an offset.\r\n\r\nThe valorization project just described was the second of its kind, a\r\nformer attempt having proved a failure. At that time (1870), the\r\nBrazilian government had been a large purchaser of Rio coffee, buying it\r\nin lieu of exchange, as it had large remittances to make. The coffee was\r\nsold through G. Amsinck & Co., and it is believed that heavy losses were\r\nsustained.\r\n\r\nSince the Sielcken valorization enterprise, the Brazilian government has\r\npromoted two more valorizations, one in 1918, another early in 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\n_War-Time Government Control of Coffee_\r\n\r\nThe board of managers of the New York Coffee and Sugar Exchange, Inc.,\r\nhad realized, late in 1917, that war-time government control of coffee\r\ntrading was likely in view of the government's activities in other\r\ncommodities. To guard against the danger of a sudden announcement of\r\nsuch action, the president of the Exchange was empowered from month to\r\nmonth, at each meeting of the board, to suspend trading at any time that\r\nconditions warranted; so that, when President Wilson announced, on\r\nJanuary 31, 1918, that all dealers in green coffees were to be licensed,\r\nthe Exchange was fully prepared. Trading was suspended pending further\r\ninformation, and owing to the farsightedness of the board of managers,\r\nall danger of a panic in the market was averted.\r\n\r\nBy 1917, the allies had stopped shipments of coffee to Germany through\r\nneighbors who had been her sole source of supply. Stocks in all the\r\nproducing countries were accumulating, and São Paulo had embarked on\r\nanother valorization scheme to protect her planters. The markets of\r\nEurope were entirely controlled by the governments; and the United\r\nStates was practically the only free and open market. The market here\r\nwas steady and without particular animation, and showed none until the\r\nend of November, 1917. At that time, speculation activities, steamer\r\nscarcity, and the steady advance in freights, became decided influences\r\nin the market; and prices began to advance.\r\n\r\nFreights on shipments from Brazil had advanced from one dollar and\r\ntwenty cents per bag early in the year to unheard-of prices; and, before\r\nthe bubble burst, had reached as high as four dollars per bag. With this\r\nsteadily advancing freight, speculation in coffee became more active;\r\nand prices naturally began to rise. The relative cheapness of coffee\r\ncompared with all other commodities; the fact that coffee here had shown\r\nvery little advance; the prospect of an early peace; the large European\r\ndemand to follow; were favorite bull arguments. The market became\r\nexcited; speculative buying was general, every one, apparently, wanted\r\nto buy coffee; and twenty cents per pound for Santos 4s in the near\r\nfuture was a common prediction.\r\n\r\nThe United States food administrator had shown his antipathy to\r\nuncontrolled exchange operations by his action on sugar, wheat, corn,\r\nand other commodities, dealt in on the exchanges; consequently, the\r\nproclamation of President Wilson regarding coffee was not a surprise to\r\nthose who had been watching the situation closely, especially as on\r\nJanuary 30, 1918 (the day before the proclamation) the president of the\r\nCoffee Exchange was summoned by telegraph to appear in Washington to\r\ndiscuss ways for a proper control of the article, and the best means to\r\nbring about such control. As a result of this summons, a committee of\r\nthe entire trade, representing the Exchange, the green-coffee dealers\r\nand importers, the roasters, and the brokers, was appointed by the\r\nExchange to confer with the food administrator at once, in order to work\r\nout a plan whereby the business could be kept going. After a long\r\nconference, rules agreed upon were approved that became the basis on\r\nwhich business was conducted until the withdrawal of all regulations\r\nregarding coffee in January, 1919. Much trade criticism followed the\r\npublication of some of these rules.\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Lawrence, president of the New York Coffee and Sugar Exchange,\r\nwas called to Washington on February 28, 1918, to take charge of a newly\r\ncreated coffee division under Theodore F. Whitmarsh, chief of the\r\ndistribution division of the food administration. In this position he\r\nrendered a signal service to the trade and to his country. Although\r\nsubjected to a cross-fire of criticism from many green and roasted\r\ncoffee interests, he never wavered in the performance of his full duty;\r\nand his good judgment, tact, and loyalty to American ideals, won for him\r\na high place in the regard of all those who had the best interests of\r\nthe country at heart. He was ably assisted in his work by Walter F.\r\nBlake, of Williams, Russell & Company, New York; and by F.T. Nutt, Jr.,\r\ntreasurer of the New York Coffee and Sugar Exchange.\r\n\r\nA coffee advisory board was appointed in June 1918, to serve as a\r\ngo-between for the trade and the food administration. Those who served\r\non this committee were: Henry Schaefer, of S. Gruner & Co., New York,\r\nchairman; Carl H. Stoffregen, of Steinwender, Stoffregen & Co., New\r\nYork, secretary; and William Bayne, Jr., of William Bayne & Co., New\r\nYork; S.H. Dorr, of Arnold, Dorr & Co., New York; A. Schierenberg, of\r\nCorn, Schwarz & Co., New York; Leon Israel, of Leon Israel & Bro., New\r\nYork; Joseph Purcell, of Hard & Rand, New York; B.F. Peabody, of T.\r\nBarbour Brown & Co., New York; J.D. Pickslay, of Williams, Russell &\r\nCo., New York; Charles L. Meehan, of P.C. Meehan & Co., New York; B.C.\r\nCasanas, of Merchants Coffee Co., New Orleans; John R. Moir, of Chase &\r\nSanborn, Boston; and B. Meyer, of Stewart, Carnal & Co., New Orleans.\r\n\r\nOthers in the trade who served the food administration during the period\r\nof the World War were George E. Lichty, president of the Black Hawk\r\nCoffee & Spice Co., Waterloo, Iowa; and Theodore F. Whitmarsh,\r\nvice-president and treasurer of Francis H. Leggett & Co., New York.\r\n\r\nThe visible supply of coffee for the United States on January 1, 1918,\r\nwas 2,887,308 bags. The world's visible supply was given as 10,012,000\r\nbags; but to be added to this were more than 3,000,000 bags held by the\r\nSão Paulo government. Thus there was little reason to fear a coffee\r\nshortage. That coffee should be permitted, with this large amount in\r\nview, to run wild as to price, was certainly not the intention of the\r\nfood administrator, whose purpose was to keep foods moving to the United\r\nStates forces and allies, and as far as possible, to keep reasonable\r\nprices for the United States consumers. Steadily advancing prices of\r\nfoods meant increasing cost of labor, general unrest, and a difficult\r\nsituation to meet at a period when the situation as a whole was most\r\ncritical.\r\n\r\nTrouble for the coffee trade was imminent early in 1918, when the\r\nshipping board, backed by experts, decided, or attempted to decide, that\r\ncoffee was not a food product; that no vessels could be had for its\r\ntransportation; and that it must be put on the list of prohibited or\r\nrestricted commodities. Mr. Hoover, however, insisted that coffee was a\r\nvery necessary essential, and that tonnage must be provided for an\r\namount sufficient at all times to keep the visible supply for the United\r\nStates up to at least 1,500,000 bags of Brazil coffee; and this figure\r\nwas ultimately accepted and carried out by the shipping board.\r\n\r\nThese figures, based on the deliveries of the two preceding years, and\r\nwith dealers limited to ninety days stock in the country, were deemed\r\nample to care for all requirements. It was figured that by November 1,\r\n1918, the freight situation would be relieved to such an extent by the\r\nnew vessels building, that the amount could be increased should it be\r\nfound necessary. The food administration, through the war trade board,\r\noffered steamer room to importers of record of the years 1916-17 at\r\n$1.70 per bag. The first few vessels were promptly filled on a basis of\r\nnine and one-quarter to nine and five-eighths cents, c. & f., for Santos\r\n4s, well described. About the same time, our army and navy were able to\r\nbuy at eight to eight and three-eighths cents f.o.b. Santos, for\r\nshipment by their own vessels. After the first few vessels offered by\r\nthe War Trade Board were filled, the trade became indifferent. The\r\nwarehouses in Brazil were loaded with stocks; vessels to carry coffee\r\nwere assured buyers at a fixed rate (profits limited); and, as there was\r\nno apparent reason for an advance, buyers were willing to let the\r\nproducing countries carry the stock.\r\n\r\nThe last week in June brought very cold weather in São Paulo, and cables\r\nreported heavy frost. The news was not taken seriously by the trade at\r\nlarge. \"Frost news\" from Brazil was no novelty, and in the past had\r\nalways been looked upon as a regular and seasonable method of bulling\r\nthe market. This year, however, the frost was a fact, and the market\r\nbegan to move upward with surprising speed. Reports of the damage to the\r\ntrees varied from forty to eighty percent. Quotations from Santos\r\nadvanced two cents per pound in as many days. United States buyers were\r\nnot disposed to follow the advance; offerings of steamer room were\r\ndeclined; and boats booked for coffee, owing to the lack of cargoes,\r\nwere transferred elsewhere. Meanwhile the market continued to advance\r\nrapidly. The allies were holding the enemy, and peace prospects were\r\nbrighter. From September 1 to November 15, the records of the food\r\nadministration showed very small purchases. The buyers did not believe\r\nin the frost. With the news of the armistice, Brazil markets went wild;\r\nand Santos 4s, which had sold at eight and one-quarter cents in May,\r\nwere quoted at twenty and one-half cents by December 10.\r\n\r\nThe food administration had decided, on February 6, 1918, after\r\nconsulting the committee appointed by the Exchange, and on their advice\r\nand recommendation, to permit trading in futures on the following plan:\r\na fixed maximum price of eight and one-half cents per pound for the spot\r\nmonth, with a carrying charge not to exceed fifteen points per pound for\r\ndelivery for each succeeding month. Thus the price for March delivery\r\nwas fixed at eight and one-half cents, while July delivery could be sold\r\nat nine and one-tenths cents; but when July arrived, it became the spot\r\nmonth, and eight and one-half cents was the maximum at which it could be\r\nsold.\r\n\r\nThis rule effectively stopped speculation, but failed to work out\r\nsatisfactorily to the trade. Experience proved that a maximum fixed\r\nprice at which coffee could be traded in would have produced much better\r\nresults. Business on the Exchange followed its usual course, and the\r\ncustomary hedging of purchases was done by dealers. The indifference of\r\nbuyers, already referred to, had resulted in a heavy decrease of the\r\nUnited States visible supply; and it had shrunk to 2,445,000 bags on\r\nSeptember 1; to 2,173,098 bags on October 1; to 1,857,260 bags on\r\nNovember 1. Included in these amounts were at least 500,000 bags, held\r\nin New York by foreign owners, which could not be sold; and of the\r\nbalance left, there was undoubtedly a liberal amount sold against on the\r\nExchange for future delivery. By October, the situation had become\r\nacute. Dealers who had classified themselves as jobbers or importers had\r\ngone into the retail classification in order to evade the limitations of\r\nprofit allowed jobbers, and were limiting their sales to lots of\r\ntwenty-five bags or fewer. Dealers who had legitimately hedged their\r\nholdings were unable to buy in.\r\n\r\nThe Exchange officials showed no disposition to relieve the situation;\r\nand as all prices had reached the maximum price for every month\r\npermitted, the food administration, on November 1, 1918, ordered the\r\nliquidation of all contracts outstanding, bought or sold, by not later\r\nthan November 9. This was done; and the coffee covered by such contracts\r\nwas released to the trade.\r\n\r\nThe regulations governing transactions on the Exchange were withdrawn on\r\nDecember 5, 1918; and, after a long argument, the Exchange decided to\r\nre-open for trading on December 26, 1918. Opening transactions amounted\r\nto 25,000 bags on a basis of seventeen and one-half cents per pound or\r\nnine cents over the prices at which contracts had been liquidated. On\r\nDecember 28 the price had declined to fifteen and one-half cents. In the\r\nopinion of many of our best merchants, the Exchange should have been\r\nclosed during the war, as it failed to be of any real service. That it\r\nwas operating at a fixed price for the spot month only, made it of no\r\nvalue to the trade during this period. Of its loyalty to the government,\r\nand its evident desire to assist there can be no question; but its\r\ncheerful acceptance of the burdens laid upon it proved largely futile.\r\n\r\nThe action of the food administration in confining the coffee business\r\nsolely to licensed dealers and to a fixed profit on actual cost; in\r\nlimiting dealers to ninety days stock; and in prohibiting resales, was\r\nthe cause of much unjust criticism. The regulations were based on the\r\ngeneral rules of the food administration, and applied to coffee quite as\r\nequitably as did the regulations governing other food commodities under\r\ncontrol and license. As a matter of fact, they were much less rigorous\r\nin some ways than the regulations applying to many other articles. For\r\nexample, ninety days stock based on sales for 1916-17 was allowed on\r\ncoffee. There was no other article on the food list to which this\r\nliberality was permitted. A forty to sixty days stock would probably be\r\nfound to be the maximum permitted to be carried of other food products.\r\n\r\nThe general proclamation of the food administration of November 1, 1917,\r\ndeclared:\r\n\r\n     These general and special rules and regulations are promulgated by\r\n     the President to accomplish three principal objects, viz: 1st, to\r\n     limit the prices charged by every licensee \"to a reasonable amount\r\n     over expenses and forbid the acquisition of speculative profits\r\n     from a rising market\"; 2d, to keep all food commodities moving in\r\n     as direct a line as possible and with as little delay as\r\n     practicable to the consumer; 3d, to limit as far as practicable\r\n     contracts for future delivery and dealing in future contracts.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it will be apparent that a profit to be allowed based\r\non \"market value\" for coffees was an impossibility, unless this law had\r\nbeen altered to allow all licensees of other commodities to share.\r\nCoffee profits were fixed by the food administration on the advice of,\r\nand with acceptance by, the coffee committee. They started too low; and\r\nwere made more liberal, when the first figures were shown to be\r\nimpossible. George W. Lawrence reports a conversation that he had with\r\nthe food administrator on this particular subject, and that was\r\ncharacteristic of his broadness. Mr. Hoover said, \"The coffee dealers\r\nare complaining of the profits permitted them. I want them satisfied;\r\nand if the profits are not reasonable, I shall put them where they will\r\nbe. This war is not going to last always; and at its conclusion I want\r\nevery American merchant in a position to be able to continue his\r\nbusiness and be no worse off than when the war started.\"\r\n\r\nResales were prohibited, or limited to one transaction, in order to\r\nprevent an accumulation of profits, that, added to each transfer, would\r\nresult ultimately in higher prices to the consumer.\r\n\r\nThe fixing of profit based on cost, and not on market or replacement\r\nvalue, is a thing that is impossible in normal times. Carried to the\r\nlast degree, it would mean ruination; for no provision is made for\r\ndeclines in the market, and resulting losses. As a war measure it was\r\ninevitable, and so endured. In normal times it is like trying to make\r\nwater run uphill. With a united people, it worked; but one can not have\r\na World War always to unite the people. It has been said that government\r\nregulation of coffees caused a large increase in price to the consumer.\r\nThis would be hard to prove. The trade, generally, that refused to buy\r\nat ten to twelve cents per pound because it did not, or would not\r\nbelieve the reports of frost damage, and thought prices too high, was\r\nfrantically bidding up to twenty and twenty-two cents for 4s in March\r\nand April, 1919. According to the ideas of some enthusiasts, fifty cents\r\nwas not an impossibility. Naturally such a bubble must burst eventually.\r\nGovernment control had nothing to do with such natural conditions as\r\nfrost, or as the buyers' indifference. Expansion and inflation were in\r\nthe air, and had to run their course. The year 1920 brought the\r\naftermath; and in the deflation, coffee, with all other commodities,\r\nwent down to prices far below its intrinsic value. The expected European\r\ndemand did not materialize; the interior buyer was overloaded with\r\nstock; and the losses of the coffee trade in 1920 will, it is to be\r\nhoped, never be repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Story of Soluble Coffee_\r\n\r\nFor nearly two decades, many coffee men and chemists have been seeking a\r\nsoluble coffee, or dried coffee extract, that would simplify the\r\npreparation of the beverage. Thus far, all the products that have\r\nappeared on the market are somewhat deficient in aroma and in the more\r\ndelicate flavors of coffee. A satisfying average cup of coffee can be\r\nprepared from the better brands; the chief advantages of which are\r\nrapidity of preparation, absence of any grounds, and uniformity of\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\nConsiderable progress has been made in certain directions; enough to\r\nwarrant telling here, though briefly, the story of soluble coffee to\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nSome there are among trade experts and coffee connoisseurs who maintain\r\nsoluble coffee is an _ignis fatuus_; that it can never be manufactured\r\nwithout destroying the aromatic principle; that at best it is a delusion\r\nand a snare. Certainly, many absurd claims have been made for some of\r\nthe soluble coffees on the market. However, there are others that are\r\nnot without their merits; and the story of their introduction to the\r\ntrade and the consuming public is entertaining and instructive.\r\n\r\nDr. Sartori Kato, a Japanese chemist, of Tokio, brought a soluble tea to\r\nChicago about 1899. It was not a commercial success; but it served to\r\nbring him in touch with some coffee men and chemists, for whom he\r\nproduced a soluble coffee in the same year. A company was organized to\r\npromote the product. It was called the Kato Coffee Co., and included, in\r\naddition to Dr. Kato; Fillip Kreissel, a chemist; W.R. Ruffner, a\r\ngreen-coffee broker; and I.D. Richheimer, a coffee roaster. Kato's\r\nsoluble coffee was first sold to the public at the Pan-American\r\nExposition in 1901. The first quantity order was received from Captain\r\nBaldwin and by him used with satisfaction on the Ziegler Arctic\r\nexpedition. United States patents on a coffee concentrate, and process\r\nfor making the same (soluble coffee), were granted to Sartori Kato of\r\nChicago, assignor to the Kato Coffee Co., of the same place, on August\r\n11, 1903.\r\n\r\nG. Washington, who was born in Belgium of English parents, and who was\r\nliving temporarily in Guatemala City, invented about 1906, a soluble\r\ncoffee that was made ready for the market in 1909.\r\n\r\nThe George Washington Coffee Refining Co. was organized in 1910 to put\r\nthe Washington product on the market, which it did first under the name,\r\nRed E coffee. This was later changed to G. Washington's Prepared Coffee,\r\nas an alternative to Washington's Coffee Extract, a name which was\r\nfavorably regarded by all except certain authorities at the national\r\ncapital. Associated with Mr. Washington at the start of the enterprise\r\nwere: E. Van Etten, former vice-president of the New York Central\r\nRailroad; W.J. Arkell; Bartlett Arkell, of the Beechnut Packing Co.;\r\nC.M. Warner, of the Warner Sugar Refining Co.; and Charles E. Proctor,\r\nof the Singer Sewing Machine Co.\r\n\r\nThe G. Washington Coffee Refining Company has its coffee-roasting and\r\npreparing plant in Brooklyn; but its process is a secret one, and has\r\nnever been patented.\r\n\r\nF. Lehnhoff Wyld, who was the Washingtons' family physician when they\r\nlived in Guatemala City, and with whom Mr. Washington had discussed his\r\nwork in soluble coffee, duplicated the Washington product in 1913; and,\r\nwith E.T. Cabarrus, he organized the _Société du Café Soluble Belna_,\r\nBrussels, Belgium, to put on the European market a refined soluble\r\ncoffee under the brand name Belna.\r\n\r\nEight or ten United States patents have been granted on soluble coffees\r\nthat have never been applied commercially.\r\n\r\nNowhere has soluble coffee met with such success as in the United\r\nStates, where a number of brands followed the Kato and G. Washington\r\nproducts. Among them, mention should be made of the C.F. Blanke Tea &\r\nCoffee Company's Magic Cup, afterward Fairy Cup, and later, Faust brand,\r\nbrought out in 1912; the Baker Importing Co.'s Barrington Hall Soluble\r\nCoffee, brought out in 1917; and the Charles G. Hires Co.'s brand,\r\nintroduced to the trade in 1918.\r\n\r\nIt was the World War that brought soluble coffee to the front. E.F.\r\nHolbrook, formerly in charge of the coffee section, subsistence\r\ndivision, United States War Department, said, \"The use of mustard gas by\r\nthe Germans made it one of the most important articles of subsistence\r\nused by the army.\" Early in the war, soluble coffee was added to the\r\nreserve ration, three-quarters of an ounce being considered at first the\r\nproper amount per ration. After trying to put it up in sticks, tablets,\r\ncapsules, and other forms, it was determined that the best method was to\r\npack it in envelopes. A month before the signing of the armistice, the\r\nNew York depot was notified that after January 1, 1919, the requirements\r\nof soluble coffee were to be 25,000 pounds per day in addition to\r\nquantities packed in reserve rations, bringing the total daily output to\r\n42,500 pounds per day. Arrangements were made to have the total output\r\nof the New York zone, 40,000 pounds per day, packed in quarter-ounce\r\nenvelopes, twenty-four to a sealed can.\r\n\r\nI.D. Richheimer, promoter of the original soluble coffee of Kato and the\r\nKato patent, organized the Soluble Coffee Co. of America in 1918, to\r\nsupply soluble coffee to the American army overseas. After the\r\narmistice, the company began licensing other merchants under the Kato\r\npatent or offering to process the merchants' own coffee for them if\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nWilliam A. Hamor and Charles W. Trigg, Pittsburgh, assignors to John E.\r\nKing, Detroit, were granted a United States patent in 1919 on a process\r\nfor making a new soluble coffee. Their process consists in bringing the\r\nvolatilized caffeol in contact with a petrolatum, or absorbing medium,\r\nwhere it is held until needed for combination with the evaporated coffee\r\nextract. The King Coffee Products Corp. of Detroit was organized in 1920\r\nto manufacture this product, known as Minute coffee, and a coffee base\r\nfor soft drinks, the latter being marketed under the name of Coffee Pep.\r\nMr. King had believed for many years that soluble coffee was destined to\r\nsolve many of the vexations of the coffee business, and had been\r\nexperimenting with the idea since 1906. To facilitate his\r\ninvestigations, he established a fellowship at the Mellon Institute of\r\nIndustrial Research, Pittsburgh, in 1914, in charge of Charles W. Trigg.\r\nThis chemically controlled research evolved a product which, after\r\npassing through the laboratory stage, was placed upon a small unit plan\r\nbasis, and then patented.

We have seen in chapter III how Rhazes, the\r\nphysician-philosopher, appears to have been the first writer to mention\r\ncoffee; and was followed by other great physicians, like Bengiazlah, a\r\ncontemporary, and Avicenna (980-1037).\r\n\r\nThen arose many legends about coffee, that served as inspiration for\r\nArabian, French, Italian, and English poets.\r\n\r\nSheik Gemaleddin, mufti of Mocha, is said to have discovered the virtues\r\nof coffee about 1454, and to have promoted the use of the drink in\r\nArabia. Knowledge of the new beverage was given to Europeans by the\r\nbotanists Rauwolf and Alpini toward the close of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe first authentic account of the origin of coffee was written by\r\nAbd-al-Kâdir in 1587. It is the famous Arabian manuscript commending the\r\nuse of coffee, preserved in the Bibliothéque Nationale, Paris, and\r\ncatalogued as \"Arabe, 4590.\"\r\n\r\nIts title written in Arabic is as follows:\r\n\r\n[Arabic]\r\n___  ___  ___  ___\r\n 4    3    2    1\r\n\r\nwhich is pronounced (reading right to left):\r\n\r\nomdat as safwa fi hall al kahwa\r\n___       ___     ___     _____\r\n 1         2       3        4\r\n\r\nor; in the literary style: omdatu s safwati fi hallu 'l kahwati which\r\nmeans--literally, (the corresponding words being underlined and\r\nnumbered)\r\n\r\n\"The maintenance of purity as\r\n     ___________    ______\r\n         1             2\r\nregards the legitimacy of coffee.\"\r\n             _________    ______\r\n                 3           4\r\n\r\nor, more freely, \"Argument in favor of the legitimate use of coffee.\"\r\n\r\n[Arabic] kahwa, is the Arabic word for coffee.\r\n\r\nThe author is Abd-al-Kâdir ibn Mohammad al Ansâri al Jazari al Hanbali.\r\nThat is, he was named Abd-al-Kâdir, son of Mohammed.\r\n\r\n_Abd-al-Kâdir_ means \"slave of the strong one\" (i.e., of God); while _al\r\nAnsâri_ means that he was a descendant of the _Ansâri_ (i.e., \"helpers\"),\r\nthe people of Medina who received and protected the Prophet Mohammed\r\nafter his flight from Mecca; _al Jazari_ means that he was a man of\r\nMesopotamia; and _al Hanbali_ that in law and theology he belonged to\r\nthe well known sect, or school, of the Hanbalites, so called after the\r\ngreat jurist and writer, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, who died at Bagdad A.H. 241\r\n(A.D. 855). The Hanbalites are one of the four great sects of the Sunni\r\nMohammedans.\r\n\r\nAbd-al-Kâdir ibn Mohammed lived in the tenth century of the Hegira--the\r\nsixteenth of our era--and wrote his book in 996 A.H., or 1587 A.D.\r\nCoffee had then been in common use since about 1450 A.D. in Arabia. It\r\nwas not in use in the time of the Prophet, who died in 632 A.D.; but he\r\nhad forbidden the drink of strong liquors which affect the brain, and\r\nhence it was argued that coffee, as a stimulant, was unlawful. Even\r\ntoday, the community of the Wahabis, very powerful in Arabia a hundred\r\nyears ago, and still dominant in part of it, do not permit the use of\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\nAbd-al-Kâdir's book is thought to have been based on an earlier writing\r\nby Shihâb-ad-Dîn Ahmad ibn Abd-al-Ghafâr al Maliki, as he refers to the\r\nlatter on the third page of his manuscript; but if so, this previous\r\nwork does not appear to have been preserved. La Roque says Shihâb-ad-Dîn\r\nwas an Arabian historian who supplied the main part of Abd-al-Kâdir's\r\nstory. La Roque refers also to a Turkish historian.\r\n\r\nResearch by the author has failed to disclose anything about\r\nShihâb-ad-Dîn save his name (_al Maliki_ means that he belonged to the\r\nMalikites, another of the four great Sunni sects), and that he wrote\r\nabout a hundred years before Abd-al-Kâdir. No copy of his writings is\r\nknown to exist.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations show the title page of Abd-al-Kâdir's manuscript, the\r\nfirst page, the third page, and the fly leaf of the cover, the latter\r\ncontaining an inscription in Latin made at the time the manuscript was\r\nfirst received or classified. It reads:\r\n\r\n     Omdat al safouat fl hall al cahuat.\r\n\r\n     De usu legitimo et licito potionis quae vulgo Café nuncupatur.\r\n     Authore Abdalcader Ben Mohammed al Ansâri. Constat hic liber\r\n     capitibus septem, et ab authore editus est anno hegirae 996 quo\r\n     anno centum et viginti anni effluxerant ex quo huius potionis usus\r\n     in Arabia felice invaluerat\r\n\r\nThe translation of the Latin is:\r\n\r\n     Concerning the legitimate and lawful use of the drink commonly\r\n     known as café by Abdalcader Ben Mohammed al Ansâri. The book is\r\n     composed in seven chapters and was brought out by the author in the\r\n     year of the Hegira 996 at which time a hundred and twenty years had\r\n     passed since the use of this drink had become firmly established in\r\n     Arabia Felix.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee in Poetry_\r\n\r\nThe Abd-al-Kâdir work immortalized coffee. It is in seven chapters. The\r\nfirst treats of the etymology and significance of the word cahouah\r\n(kahwa), the nature and properties of the bean, where the drink was\r\nfirst used, and describes its virtues. The other chapters have to do\r\nlargely with the church dispute in Mecca in 1511, answer the religious\r\nobjectors to coffee, and conclude with a collection of Arabic verses\r\ncomposed during the Mecca controversy by the best poets of the time.\r\n\r\nDe Nointel, ambassador from the court of Louis XIV to the Ottoman Porte,\r\nbrought back with him to Paris from Constantinople the Abd-al-Kâdir\r\nmanuscript, and another by Bichivili, one of the three general\r\ntreasurers of the Ottoman Empire. The latter work is of a later date\r\nthan the Abd-al-Kâdir manuscript, and is concerned chiefly with the\r\nhistory of the introduction of coffee into Egypt, Syria, Damascus,\r\nAleppo, and Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThe following are two of the earliest Arabic poems in praise of coffee.\r\nThey are about the period of the first coffee persecution in Mecca\r\n(1511), and are typical of the best thought of the day:\r\n\r\n     IN PRAISE OF COFFEE\r\n\r\n     _Translation from the Arabic_\r\n\r\n     O Coffee! Thou dost dispel all cares, thou art the object of desire\r\n     to the scholar.\r\n\r\n     This is the beverage of the friends of God; it gives health to\r\n     those in its service who strive after wisdom.\r\n\r\n     Prepared from the simple shell of the berry, it has the odor of\r\n     musk and the color of ink.\r\n\r\n     The intelligent man who empties these cups of foaming coffee, he\r\n     alone knows truth.\r\n\r\n     May God deprive of this drink the foolish man who condemns it with\r\n     incurable obstinacy.\r\n\r\n     Coffee is our gold. Wherever it is served, one enjoys the society\r\n     of the noblest and most generous men.\r\n\r\n     O drink! As harmless as pure milk, which differs from it only in\r\n     its blackness.\r\n\r\nHere is another, rhymed version of the same poem:\r\n\r\nIN PRAISE OF COFFEE\r\n\r\n_Translation from the Arabic_\r\n\r\nO coffee! Doved and fragrant drink, thou drivest care away,\r\nThe object thou of that man's wish who studies night and day.\r\nThou soothest him, thou giv'st him health, and God doth favor those\r\nWho walk straight on in wisdom's way, nor seek their own repose.\r\nFragrant as musk thy berry is, yet black as ink in sooth!\r\nAnd he who sips thy fragrant cup can only know the truth.\r\nInsensate they who, tasting not, yet vilify its use;\r\nFor when they thirst and seek its help, God will the gift refuse.\r\nOh, coffee is our wealth! for see, where'er on earth it grows,\r\nMen live whose aims are noble, true virtues who disclose.\r\n\r\n     COFFEE COMPANIONSHIP\r\n\r\n     _Translation from the Arabic_\r\n\r\n     Come and enjoy the company of coffee in the places of its\r\n     habitation; for the Divine Goodness envelops those who partake of\r\n     its feast.\r\n\r\n     There the elegance of the rugs, the sweetness of life, the society\r\n     of the guests, all give a picture of the abode of the blest.\r\n\r\n     It is a wine which no sorrow could resist when the cup-bearer\r\n     presents thee with the cup which contains it.\r\n\r\n     It is not long since Aden saw thy birth. If thou doubtest this, see\r\n     the freshness of youth shining on the faces of thy children.\r\n\r\n     Grief is not found within its habitations. Trouble yields humbly to\r\n     its power.\r\n\r\n     It is the beverage of the children of God, it is the source of\r\n     health.\r\n\r\n     It is the stream in which we wash away our sorrows. It is the fire\r\n     which consumes our griefs.\r\n\r\n     Whoever has once known the chafing-dish which prepares this\r\n     beverage, will feel only aversion for wine and liquor from casks.\r\n\r\n     Delicious beverage, its color is the seal of its purity.\r\n\r\n     Reason pronounces favorably on the lawfulness of it.\r\n\r\n     Drink of it confidently, and give not ear to the speech of the\r\n     foolish, who condemn it without reason.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of the second religious persecution of coffee in the\r\nlatter part of the sixteenth century, other Arabian poets sang the\r\npraises of coffee. The learned Fakr-Eddin-Aboubeckr ben Abid Iesi wrote\r\na book entitled _The Triumph of Coffee_, and the poet-sheikh\r\nSherif-Eddin-Omar-ben-Faredh sang of it in harmonious verse, wherein,\r\ndiscoursing of his mistress, he could find no more flattering comparison\r\nthan coffee. He exclaims, \"She has made me drink, in long draughts, the\r\nfever, or, rather, the coffee of love!\"\r\n\r\nThe numerous contributions by early travelers to the literature of\r\ncoffee have been mentioned in chronological order in the history\r\nchapters. After Rauwolf and Alpini, there were Sir Antony Sherley,\r\nParry, Biddulph, Captain John Smith, Sir George Sandys, Sir Thomas\r\nHerbert, and Sir Henry Blount in England; Tavernier, Thévenot, Bernier,\r\nP. de la Roque, and Galland in France; Delia Valle in Italy; Olearius\r\nand Niebhur in Germany; Nieuhoff in Holland, and others.\r\n\r\nFrancis Bacon wrote about coffee in his _Hist. Vitae et Mortis_ and\r\n_Sylva Sylvarum_, 1623-27. Burton referred to it in his \"_Anatomy of\r\nMelancholy_\" in 1632. Parkinson described it in his _Theatrum Botanicum_\r\nin 1640. In 1652, Pasqua Rosée published his famous handbill in London,\r\na literary effort as well as a splendid first advertisement.\r\n\r\nFaustus Nairon (Banesius) produced in Rome, in 1671, the first printed\r\ntreatise devoted solely to coffee. The same year Dufour brought out the\r\nfirst treatise in French. This he followed in 1684 with his work, _The\r\nmanner of making coffee, tea, and chocolate_. John Ray extolled the\r\nvirtues of coffee in his _Universal Botany of Plants_, published in\r\nLondon in 1686. Galland translated the Abd-al-Kâdir manuscript into\r\nFrench in 1699, and Jean La Roque published his _Voyage de l'Arabie\r\nHeureuse_ in Paris in 1715. Excerpts from nearly all these works appear\r\nin various chapters of this work.\r\n\r\nLeonardus Ferdinandus Meisner published a Latin treatise on coffee, tea,\r\nand chocolate in 1721. Dr. James Douglas published in London (1727) his\r\n_Arbor yemensis fructum cofè ferens, or a description and history of the\r\nCoffee Tree_. This work laid under contribution many of the Italian,\r\nGerman, French, and English scholars mentioned above; and the author\r\nmentioned as other sources of information: Dr. Quincy, Pechey, Gaudron,\r\nde Fontenelle, Professor Boerhaave, Figueroa, Chabraeus, Sir Hans\r\nSloane, Langius, and Du Mont.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the poets and dramatists of\r\nFrance, Italy, and England found a plentiful supply in what had already\r\nbeen written on coffee; to say nothing of the inspiration offered by the\r\ndrink itself, and by the society of the cafés of the period.\r\n\r\nFrench poets, familiar with Latin, first took coffee as the subject of\r\ntheir verse. Vaniére sang its praises in the eighth book of his\r\n_Praedium rusticum_; and Fellon, a Jesuit professor of Trinity College,\r\nLyons, wrote a didactic poem called, _Faba Arabica, Carmen_, which is\r\nincluded in the _Poemata didascalica_ of d'Olivet.\r\n\r\nAbbé Guillaume Massieu's _Carmen Caffaeum_, composed in 1718, has been\r\nreferred to in chapter III. It was read at the Academy of Inscriptions.\r\nOne of the panegyrists of this author, de Boze, in his _Elogé de\r\nMassieu_, says that if Horace and Virgil had known of coffee, the poem\r\nmight easily have been attributed to them; and Thery, who translated it\r\ninto French, says \"it is a pearl of elegance in a rare jewel case.\"\r\n\r\nThe following translation of the poem from the Latin original was made\r\nfor this work:\r\n\r\nCOFFEE\r\n\r\n_A Poem by Guillaume Massieu of the French Academy_\r\n\r\n(A literal prose translation from the original Latin in the British\r\nMuseum.)\r\n\r\nHow coffee first came to our shores,\r\nWhat the nature of the divine drink is, what its use,\r\nHow it brings ready aid to man against every kind of evils,\r\nI shall here begin to tell in simple verse.\r\n\r\nYou soft-spoken men, who have often tried the sweetness of this drink,\r\nIf it has never deceived your wishes or mocked your hopes\r\nWith its empty results, be propitious and lend a willing ear to our song.\r\nAnd may you, O Phoebus, kindly be present, to acknowledge\r\nAs your gift the power of herbs and healthful plants, and to\r\nDispel sad diseases from our bodies; for they say you are\r\nThe author of this blessing, and may you spread your\r\nGifts among peoples, and everywhere far and wide throughout the entire\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAcross Libya afar, and the seven mouths of the swollen Nile,\r\nWhere Asia most joyfully spreads in immense fields\r\nRich in various resources and filled with fragrant woods,\r\nA region extends. The Sabeans of old inhabited it.\r\nI believe indeed Nature, that best parent of all things,\r\nLoved this place more than all others with a tender love.\r\nHere the air of Heaven always breathes more mildly.\r\nThe sun has a gentler power; here are flowers of a different clime;\r\nAnd the earth with fertile bosom brings forth various fruits,\r\nCinnamon, casia, myrrh, and fragrant thyme.\r\nAmid the resources and gifts of this blessed land,\r\nTurned to the sun and the warm south winds,\r\nA tree spontaneously lifts itself into the upper air.\r\nGrowing nowhere else, and unknown in earlier centuries,\r\nBy no means great in size, it stretches not far its\r\nSpreading branches, nor lifts a lofty top to heaven;\r\nBut lowly, after the manner of myrtle or pliant broom,\r\nIt rises from the ground. Many a nut bends its rich branches.\r\nSmall, like a bean, dark and dull in color,\r\nMarked by a slight groove in the centre of its hull.\r\n\r\nTo transplant this growth to our own fields\r\nMany have tried, and to cultivate it with great care.\r\nIn vain; for the plant has not responded to the zeal\r\nAnd desires of the planters, and has rendered vain their long labor;\r\nBefore day the root of the tender herb has withered away.\r\nEither this has happened through fault of climate, or grudging\r\nEarth refuses to furnish fit nourishment to the foreign plant.\r\n\r\nTherefore come thou, whoever shall be possesed by a love for coffee,\r\nDo not regret having brought the healthful bean from the far\r\nRemote world of Arabia; for this is its bountiful mother country.\r\nThe soothing draught first flowed from those regions through other\r\nPeoples; thence through all Europe and Asia,\r\nand next made its way through the entire world.\r\n\r\nTherefore, what you shall know to be sufficient for your needs,\r\nDo you prepare long beforehand; let it be your care to have collected\r\nYearly a copious store, and providently fill small granaries,\r\nAs of yore the farmer, early mindful and provident of the future,\r\nCollected crops from his fields and garnered them in his barns,\r\nAnd turned his attention to the coming year.\r\n\r\nNone the less, meanwhile, must the utensils for coffee be cared for. Let\r\nnot vessels suited for drinking the beverage be lacking, And a pot,\r\nwhose narrow neck should be topped by a small cover And whose body\r\nshould swell gradually into an oblong shape. When these things shall\r\nhave been provided by you, let your Next care be to roast well the beans\r\nwith flames, and to grind them when roasted. Nor should the hammer cease\r\nto crush them with many a blow, Until they lay aside their hardness, and\r\nwhen thoroughly ground, Become fine powder; which forthwith pack either\r\nin a bag or a box made for such uses. And wrap it in leather, and smear\r\nit over with soft wax, lest Narrow chinks be open, or hidden channels.\r\nUnless you prevent these, by a secret path gradually small Particles and\r\nwhatever of value exists, and the entire strength, Would leave, wasting\r\ninto empty air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAMEL TRANSPORT BETWEEN HARAR AND DIRE-DAOUA, ABYSSINIA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUN-DRYING IN LA LAGUNA, PHILIPPINE ISLANDS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE SCENES IN THE NEAR AND THE FAR EAST]\r\n\r\nThere is also a hollow machine, like a small tower, which they\r\nCall a mill, in which you can bruise the useful fruit of the\r\nRoasted bean and crush it with frequent rubbing;\r\nA revolving pivot in the middle, on an easy wheel turning,\r\nTwists its metal joints on a creaking stem.\r\nThe top of the wheel, you know, is pierced with an ivory handle\r\nWhich will have to be turned by hand, through a thousand revolutions,\r\nAnd through a thousand circles it moves the pivot.\r\nWhen you put a kernel in, you will turn the handle with quick hand--\r\nNo delay--and you will wonder how the crackling kernel is\r\nWith much grinding quickly reduced to a powder.\r\nOnce only the lower compartment receives on its kindly bosom\r\nThe crushed grains, which are placed in the very depths of the box.\r\n\r\nBut why do we linger over these less important matters? Greater things\r\ncall us. Then is it time to drain the sweet Draught, either under the\r\nnew light of the early sun In the morning, when an empty stomach demands\r\nfood; Or, when, after the splendid feasts of a magnificent table The\r\noverburdened stomach suffers from too heavy load, and Unequal to the\r\ndemands made upon it, seeks the aid of external heat. Then come, when\r\nnow the pot grows ruddy in the fire Crackling beneath, and you shall\r\nbehold the liquid, swelling With mingled powdered coffee, now bubble\r\naround the brim, Draw it from the fire. Unless you should do this, the\r\nforce of The water would break forth suddenly, overflowing, and would\r\nSprinkle the beverage on the fire beneath. Therefore, let no such\r\naccident disturb your joys. You should keep watch carefully when the\r\nwater no longer Restrains itself and bubbles with the heat; then return\r\nThe pot to the fire thrice and four times, until the powdered Coffee\r\nsteams in the midst of the fire and blends thoroughly with the\r\nsurrounding water.\r\n\r\nThis soothing drink ought to be boiled with skill, to be drunk With\r\nart--not in the way men are wont to drink other beverages--And with\r\nreason; for when you shall have taken it steaming from A quick fire, and\r\ngradually all the dregs have settled to the Very bottom, you shall not\r\ndrink it impatiently at one gulp. But rather, sip it little by little,\r\nand between draughts Contrive pleasant delays; and sipping, drain it in\r\nlong draughts, So long as it is still hot and burns the palate. For then\r\nit is better, then it permeates our inmost bones, and Penetrating within\r\nto the center of our vitals and our marrow, It pervades all our body\r\nwith its vivifying strength. Often even merely inhaling the odor with\r\ntheir nostrils, men Have welcomed it, when it has bubbled up from the\r\nbottom, More refreshing than the breeze. So much pleasure is there in a\r\ndelicious odor.\r\n\r\nAnd now there remains awaiting us the other part of our task, To make\r\nknown the secret strength of the divine draught. But who could hope to\r\nunderstand this wonderful blessing Or to be able to pursue so great a\r\nmiracle in verse? For really, when coffee has quietly glided into your\r\nbody, Taking itself within, it sheds a vital warmth through your Limbs,\r\nand inspires joyous strength in your heart. Then if There is anything\r\nundigested, with fire's help, it heats the Hidden channels, and loosens\r\nthe thin pores, through which the Useless moisture exudes, and seeds of\r\ndiseases flee from all your veins.\r\n\r\nWherefore come, O you who have a care for your health! You, whose triple\r\nchin hangs on your breast, Who drag your heavy stomach of great bulk, It\r\nis fitting for you, first of all, to indulge in the warm Beverage; for\r\nindeed it will dry the hideous flow of moisture Which oppresses your\r\nlimbs, and sends forth streams of perspiration from your whole body. And\r\nin a short time, the swelling of your fat belly will Gradually begin to\r\ndecrease, and it will lighten your members, now oppressed by their heavy\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nO happy peoples, on whom Titan, rising, looks with his first light!\r\nHere, a rather free use of wine has never done harm. Law and religion\r\nforbid us to quaff the flowing wine. Here one lives on coffee. Here,\r\nthen, flourishing with joyous strength One pursues life and knows not\r\nwhat diseases are, Nor that child of Bacchus and companion of high\r\nliving--Gout; Nor what innumerable diseases through this union are ready\r\nto attack our world.\r\n\r\nYet, indeed, the soothing power of this invigorating drink Drives sad\r\ncares from the heart, and exhilarates the spirits. I have seen a man,\r\nwhen he had not yet drained a mighty Draught of this sweet nectar, walk\r\nsilently with slow gait, His brow sad, and forehead rough with\r\nforbidding wrinkles. This same man who had hardly bathed his throat with\r\nthe sweet Drink--no delay--clouds fled from his wrinkled brow; and He\r\ntook pleasure in teasing all with his witty sayings. Nor yet did he\r\npursue any one with bitter laughter. For this Harmless drink inspires no\r\ndesire of offending, the venom Is lacking, and pleasant laughter without\r\nbitterness pleases.\r\n\r\nAnd in the entire East this custom of coffee drinking Has been accepted.\r\nAnd, now, France; you adopt the foreign custom, So that public shops,\r\none after the other, are opened for Drinking Coffee. A hanging sign of\r\neither ivy or laurel invites the passers-by. Hither in crowds from the\r\nentire city they assemble, and While away the time in pleasant drinking.\r\nAnd when once the feelings have grown warm, acted upon by The gentle\r\nheat, then good-humored laughter, and pleasant Arguments increase.\r\nGeneral gaiety ensues, the places about resound with joyous applause.\r\nBut never does the liquid imbibed overpower weary minds, but Rather, if\r\never slumber presses their heavy eyes and dulls The brain; and their\r\nstrength, blunted, grows torpid in the Body, coffee puts sleep to flight\r\nfrom the eyes, and slothful inactivity from the whole frame. Therefore\r\nto absorb the sweet draught would be an advantage For those whom a great\r\ndeal of long-continued labor awaits And those who need to extend their\r\nstudy far into the night.\r\n\r\nAnd here I shall make known who taught the use of this pleasant Drink;\r\nfor its virtue, unknown, has lain hidden through many Years; and\r\nreviewing, I shall relate the matter from the very beginning.\r\n\r\nAn Arab shepherd was driving his young goats to the well-known Pastures.\r\nThey were wandering through lonely wastes and cropping The grasses, when\r\na tree heavy with many berries--never seen before--met their eyes. At\r\nonce, as they were able to reach the low branches, they began To pull\r\noff the leaves with many a nibble, and to pluck the tender Growth. Its\r\nbitterness attracts. The shepherd, not knowing this, Was meanwhile\r\nsinging on the soft grass and telling the story of his loves to the\r\nwoods. But when the evening star, rising, warned him to leave the field,\r\nAnd he led back his well-fed flock to their stalls, he perceived That\r\nthe beasts did not close their eyes in sweet sleep, but Joyous beyond\r\ntheir wont, with wonderful delight throughout the Whole night jumped\r\nabout with wanton leaps. Trembling with sudden Fear, the shepherd stood\r\namazed; and crazed by the sound, he Thought these things were being done\r\nthrough some wicked trick of a neighbor, or by magic art.\r\n\r\nNot far from here a holy band of brethren had built their Humble home in\r\na remote valley; their lot it was to chant Praises of God, and to load\r\nhis altars with fitting gifts. Although throughout the night the\r\ndeep-toned bell resounded With great din, and summoned them to the\r\nsacred temple, often The coming of dawn found them lingering on their\r\ncouches, Having forgotten to rise in the middle of the night. So great\r\nwas their love of sleep!\r\n\r\nIn charge of the sacred temple, revered and obeyed by his Willing\r\nbrethren, was the master, an aged man, a heavy mass of white hair on\r\nhead and chin. The shepherd, hastening, came to him and told him the\r\nstory, Imploring his aid. The old man smiled to himself; but He agreed\r\nto go, and investigate the hidden cause of the miracle.\r\n\r\nWhen he has come to the hills, he observes the lambs, together With\r\ntheir mothers, gnawing the berries of an unknown plant, And cries, \"This\r\nis the cause of the trouble!\" And saying no More, he at once picks the\r\nsmooth fruit from the heavily-laden Tree, and carries it home, places\r\nit, when washed, in pure Water, cooking it over the fire, and fearlessly\r\ndrinks a large Cup of it. Forthwith a warmth pervades his veins, a\r\nliving Force is diffused through his limbs, and weariness is dispelled\r\nfrom his aged body. Then, at length, the old man exulting in the\r\nblessing thus found, Rejoices, and kindly shares with all his brothers.\r\nThey eagerly At early night-fall, indulge in pleasant banquets and drain\r\ngreat bowls. No longer is it hard for them to break off sweet sleep and\r\nto leave their soft beds as formerly. O fortunate ones! whose hearts the\r\nsweet draught has often Bathed. No sluggish torpor holds their minds,\r\nthey briskly Rise for their prescribed duties and rejoice to outstrip\r\nthe rays of the first light.\r\n\r\nYou also, whose care it is to feed minds with divine eloquence And to\r\nterrify with your words the souls of the guilty, you also Should indulge\r\nin the pleasant drink; for, as you know, it Strengthens weakness. Keen\r\nvigor is gained for the limbs from This source, and spreads through the\r\nwhole body. From this source, Too, shall come new strength and new power\r\nto your voice. You also, whom oft harmful vapors harass, whose sick\r\nbrain the dangerous vertigo shakes, Ah, come! In this sweet liquid is a\r\nready medicine And none other better to calm undue agitation. Apollo\r\nplanted this power for himself, they say, The story is worthy to be\r\nsung.\r\n\r\nOnce a disease most deadly to life assailed the disciples of Apollo's\r\nMount. It spread far and wide, and attacked the brain itself. Already\r\nall the people of genius were suffering with this Disease; and the arts,\r\ndeserted, were languishing along with The workers. Some even pretended\r\nto have the disease, and Assuming feigned suffering, gave themselves\r\nover to an idle life. Unpleasing work grew distasteful, and deadly\r\ninertia increased Everywhere. It pleased all, now released from work and\r\nlabors, To indulge in care-free quiet. Apollo, full of indignation, did\r\nnot endure longer that the deadly Contagion of such easy ruin should\r\ncreep over them thus. And, That he might take away from seers all means\r\nof deception, he Enticed from the rich bosom of the earth this friendly\r\nplant, Than which no other is more ready either to refresh for work the\r\nMind wearied by long studies, or to sooth troublesome sorrows of the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nO plant, given to the human race by the gift of the Gods! No other out\r\nof the entire list of plants has ever vied with you. On your account\r\nsailors sail from our shores And fearlessly conquer the threatening\r\nwinds, sandbanks and Dreadful rocks. With your nourishing growth you\r\nsurpass dittany, Ambrosia, and fragrant panacea. Grim diseases flee from\r\nyou. To You trusting health clings as a companion, and also the merry\r\nCrowd, conversation, amusing jokes, and sweet whisperings.\r\n\r\nThe poet Belighi toward the close of the sixteenth century composed a\r\npoem, which, freely translated, runs:\r\n\r\nIn Damascus, in Aleppo, in great Cairo,\r\nAt every turn is to be found\r\nThat mild fruit which gives so beloved a drink,\r\nBefore coming to court to triumph.\r\nThere this seditious disturber of the world,\r\nHas, by its unparalleled virtue,\r\nSupplanted all wines from this blessed day.\r\n\r\nJacques Delille (1738-1813) the didactic poet of nature, in _chant vi_\r\nof his \"_Three Reigns of Nature_,\" thus apostrophizes the \"divine\r\nnectar\" and describes its preparation:\r\n\r\nDIVINE COFFEE\r\n\r\n_Translation from the French_\r\n\r\nA liquid there is to the poet most dear,\r\n'T was lacking to Virgil, adored by Voltaire,\r\n'T is thou, divine coffee, for thine is the art,\r\nWithout turning the head yet to gladden the heart.\r\nAnd thus though my palate be dulled by age,\r\nWith joy I partake of thy dear beverage.\r\nHow glad I prepare me thy nectar most precious,\r\nNo soul shall usurp me a rite so delicious;\r\nOn the ambient flame when the black charcoal burns,\r\nThe gold of thy bean to rare ebony turns,\r\nI alone, 'gainst the cone, wrought with fierce iron teeth.\r\nMake thy fruitage cry out with its bitter-sweet breath;\r\nTill charmed with such perfume, with care I entrust\r\nTo the pot on my hearth the rare spice-laden dust:\r\nFirst to calm, then excite, till it seethingly whirls,\r\nWith an eye all attention I gaze till it boils.\r\nAt last now the liquid comes slow to repose;\r\nIn the hot, smoking vessel its wealth I depose,\r\nMy cup and thy nectar; from wild reeds expressed,\r\nAmerica's honey my table has blest;\r\nAll is ready; Japan's gay enamel invites--\r\nAnd the tribute of two worlds thy prestige unites:\r\nCome, Nectar divine, inspire thou me,\r\nI wish but Antigone, dessert and thee;\r\nFor scarce have I tasted thy odorous steam,\r\nWhen quick from thy clime, soothing warmths round me stream,\r\nAttentive my thoughts rise and flow light as air,\r\nAwaking my senses and soothing my care.\r\nIdeas that but late moved so dull and depressed,\r\nBehold, they come smiling in rich garments dressed!\r\nSome genius awakes me, my course is begun;\r\nFor I drink with each drop a bright ray of the sun.\r\n\r\nMaumenet addressed to Galland the following verses:\r\n\r\nIf slumber, friend, too near, with some late glass should creep--\r\n  Dull, poppy-perfumed sleep--\r\nIf a too fumous wine confounds at length thy brain--\r\n  Take coffee then--this juice divine\r\nShall banish sleep and steam of vap'rous wine,\r\nAnd with its timely aid fresh vigor thou shalt find.\r\n\r\nCastel, in his poem, _Les Plantes_ (The Plants) could not omit the\r\ncoffee trees of the tropics. He thus addressed them in 1811:\r\n\r\nBright plants, the favorites of Phoebus,\r\n  In these climes the rarest virtues offer,\r\nDelicious Mocha, thy sap, enchantress,\r\n  Awakens genius, outvalues Parnasse!\r\n\r\nIn a collection of the _Songs of Brittany_ in the Brest library there\r\nare many stanzas in praise of coffee. A Breton poet has composed a\r\nlittle piece of ninety-six verses in which he describes the powerful\r\nattraction that coffee has for women and the possible effects on\r\ndomestic happiness. The first time that coffee was used in Brittany,\r\nsays an old song of that country, only the nobility drank it, and now\r\nall the common people are using it, yet the greater part of them have\r\nnot even bread.\r\n\r\nA French poet of the eighteenth century produced the following:\r\n\r\nLINES ON COFFEE\r\n\r\n_Translation from the French_\r\n\r\nGood coffee is more than a savory cup,\r\nIts aroma has power to dry liquor up.\r\nBy coffee you get upon leaving the table\r\nA mind full of wisdom, thoughts lucid, nerves stable;\r\nAnd odd tho' it be, 't is none the less true,\r\nCoffee's aid to digestion permits dining anew.\r\nAnd what 's very true, tho' few people know it,\r\nFine coffee 's the basis of every fine poet;\r\nFor many a writer as windy as Boreas\r\nHas been vastly improved by the drink ever glorious.\r\nCoffee brightens the dullness of heavy philosophy,\r\nAnd opens the science of mighty geometry.\r\nOur law-makers, too, when the nectar imbibing,\r\nPlan wondrous reforms, quite beyond the describing;\r\nThe odor of coffee they delight in inhaling,\r\nAnd promise the country to alter laws ailing.\r\nFrom the brow of the scholar coffee chases the wrinkles,\r\nAnd mirth in his eyes like a firefly twinkles;\r\nAnd he, who before was but a hack of old Homer,\r\nBecomes an original, and that 's no misnomer.\r\nObserve the astronomer who 's straining his eyes\r\nIn watching the planets which soar thro' the skies;\r\nAlas, all those bright bodies seem hopelessly far\r\nTill coffee discloses his own guiding star.\r\nBut greatest of wonders that coffee effects\r\nIs to aid the news-editor as he little expects;\r\nCoffee whispers the secrets of hidden diplomacy,\r\nHints rumors of wars and of scandals so racy.\r\nInspiration by coffee must be nigh unto magic,\r\nFor it conjures up facts that are certainly tragic;\r\nAnd for a few pennies, coffee's small price per cup,\r\n\"Ye editor's\" able to swallow the Universe up.\r\n\r\nEsménard celebrated Captain de Clieu's romantic voyage to Martinique\r\nwith the coffee plants from the Jardin des Plantes, in some admirable\r\nverses quoted in chapter II.\r\n\r\nAmong other notable poetic flights in praise of coffee produced in\r\nFrance mention should be made of: \"_L'Elogé du Café_\" (Eulogy of Coffee)\r\na song in twenty-four couplets, Paris, Jacques Estienne, 1711; _Le Café_\r\n(Coffee), a fragment from the fourth _chant_ (song) of _La Grandeur de\r\nDieu dans les merveilles de la Nature_ (The Grandeur of God in the\r\nWonders of Nature) Marseilles; _Le Café_, extract from the fourth\r\ngastronomic song, by Berchoux; \"_A Mon Café_\" (To My Coffee), stanzas\r\nwritten by Ducis; _Le Café_, anonymous stanzas inserted in the\r\n_Macedoine Poetique_, 1824; a poem in Latin in the Abbé Olivier's\r\ncollection; _Le Bouquet Blanc et le Bouquet Noir, poesie en quatre\r\nchants; Le Café_, C.D. Mery, 1837; _Elogé du Café_, S. Melaye, 1852.\r\n\r\nMany Italian poets have sung the praises of coffee. L. Barotti wrote his\r\npoem, _Il Caffè_ in 1681. Giuseppe Parini (1729-1799), Italy's great\r\nsatirical and lyric poet and critic of the eighteenth century, in _Il\r\nGiorno_ (_The Day_), gives a delightful pen picture of the manners and\r\ncustoms of Milan's polite society of the period. William Dean Howells\r\nquotes as follows from these poems (his own translation) in his _Modern\r\nItalian Poets_. The feast is over, and the lady signals to the cavalier\r\nthat it is time to leave the table:\r\n\r\n    Spring to thy feet\r\nThe first of all, and, drawing near thy lady,\r\nRemove her chair and offer her thy hand,\r\nAnd lead her to the other room, nor suffer longer\r\nThat the stale reek of viands shall offend\r\nHer delicate sense. Thee with the rest invites\r\nThe grateful odor of the coffee, where\r\nIt smokes upon a smaller table hid\r\nAnd graced with Indian webs. The redolent gums\r\nThat meanwhile burn, sweeten and purify\r\nThe heavy atmosphere, and banish thence\r\nAll lingering traces of the feast. Ye sick\r\nAnd poor, whom misery or whom hope, perchance!\r\nHas guided in the noonday to these doors.\r\nTumultuous, naked, and unsightly throng,\r\nWith mutilated limbs and squalid faces,\r\nIn litters and on crutches from afar\r\nComfort yourselves, and with expanded nostrils\r\nDrink in the nectar of the feast divine\r\nThat favourable zephyrs waft to you;\r\nBut do not dare besiege these noble precincts,\r\nImportunately offering her that reigns\r\nWithin your loathsome spectacle of woe!\r\nAnd now, sir, 't is your office to prepare\r\nThe tiny cup that then shall minister,\r\nSlow sipped, its liquor to thy lady's lips;\r\nAnd now bethink thee whether she prefer\r\nThe boiling beverage much or little tempered\r\nWith sweet; or if, perchance, she likes it best,\r\nAs doth the barbarous spouse, then when she sits\r\nUpon brocades of Persia, with light fingers,\r\nThe bearded visage of her lord caressing.\r\n\r\nThis is from _Il Mezzogiorno_ (_Noon_). The other three poems, rounding\r\nout _The Day_, are _Il Mattino_ (_Morning_), _Il Vespre_ (_Evening_),\r\nand _La Notte_ (_Night_). In _Il Mattino_, Parini sings:\r\n\r\nShould dreary hypochondria's woes oppress thee,\r\nShould round thy charming limbs in too great measure\r\nThy flesh increase, then with thy lips do honor\r\nTo that clear beverage, made from the well-bronzed,\r\nThe smoking, ardent beans Aleppo sends thee,\r\nAnd distant Mocha too, a thousand ship-loads;\r\nWhen slowly sipped it knows no rival.\r\n\r\nBelli's _Il Caffè_ supplies a partial bibliography of the Italian\r\nliterature on coffee. There are many poems, some of them put to music.\r\nAs late as 1921, there were published in Bologna some advertising verses\r\non coffee by G.B. Zecchini with music by Cesare Cantino.\r\n\r\nPope Leo XIII, in his Horatian poem on _Frugality_ composed in his\r\neighty-eighth year, thus verses his appreciation of coffee:\r\n\r\nLast comes the beverage of the Orient shore,\r\nMocha, far off, the fragrant berries bore.\r\nTaste the dark fluid with a dainty lip,\r\nDigestion waits on pleasure as you sip.\r\n\r\nPeter Altenberg, a Vienna poet, thus celebrated the cafés of his native\r\ncity:\r\n\r\nTO THE COFFEE HOUSE!\r\n\r\nWhen you are worried, have trouble of one sort or another--to the coffee\r\n house!\r\nWhen she did not keep her appointment, for one reason or other--to the\r\n coffee house!\r\nWhen your shoes are torn and dilapidated--coffee house!\r\nWhen your income is four hundred crowns and you spend five hundred--coffee\r\n house!\r\nYou are a chair warmer in some office, while your ambition led you to seek\r\n professional honors--coffee house!\r\nYou could not find a mate to suit you--coffee house!\r\nYou feel like committing suicide--coffee house!\r\nYou hate and despise human beings, and at the same time you can not be\r\n happy without them--coffee house!\r\nYou compose a poem which you can not inflict upon friends you meet in the\r\n street--coffee house!\r\nWhen your coal scuttle is empty, and your gas ration exhausted--coffee\r\n house!\r\nWhen you need money for cigarettes, you touch the head waiter in\r\n the--coffee house!\r\nWhen you are locked out and haven't the money to pay for unlocking the\r\n house door--coffee house!\r\nWhen you acquire a new flame, and intend provoking the old one, you take\r\n the new one to the old one's--coffee house!\r\nWhen you feel like hiding you dive into a--coffee house!\r\nWhen you want to be seen in a new suit--coffee house!\r\nWhen you can not get anything on trust anywhere else--coffee house!\r\n\r\nEnglish poets from Milton to Keats celebrated coffee. Milton (1608-1674)\r\nin his _Comus_ thus acclaimed the beverage:\r\n\r\n        One sip of this\r\nWill bathe the drooping spirits in delight\r\nBeyond the bliss of dreams.\r\n\r\nAlexander Pope, poet and satirist (1688-1744), has the oft-quoted lines:\r\n\r\nCoffee which makes the politician wise,\r\nAnd see through all things with his half-shut eyes.\r\n\r\nIn Carruthers' _Life of Pope_, we read that this poet inhaled the steam\r\nof coffee in order to obtain relief from the headaches to which he was\r\nsubject. We can well understand the inspiration which called forth from\r\nhim the following lines when he was not yet twenty:\r\n\r\nAs long as Mocha's happy tree shall grow,\r\nWhile berries crackle, or while mills shall go;\r\nWhile smoking streams from silver spouts shall glide,\r\nOr China's earth receive the sable tide,\r\nWhile coffee shall to British nymphs be dear,\r\nWhile fragrant steams the bended head shall cheer,\r\nOr grateful bitters shall delight the taste,\r\nSo long her honors, name and praise shall last.\r\n\r\nPope's famous _Rape of the Lock_ grew out of coffee-house gossip. The\r\npoem contains the passage on coffee already quoted:\r\n\r\nFor lo! the board with cups and spoons is crowned;\r\nThe berries crackle and the mill turns round;\r\nOn shining altars of Japan they raise\r\nThe silver lamp: the fiery spirits blaze:\r\nFrom silver spouts the grateful liquors glide,\r\nWhile China's earth receives the smoking tide.\r\nAt once they gratify their scent and taste.\r\nAnd frequent cups prolong the rich repast\r\nStraight hover round the fair her airy band;\r\nSome, as she sipped, the fuming liquor fanned:\r\nSome o'er her lap their careful plumes displayed,\r\nTrembling, and conscious of the rich brocade.\r\nCoffee (which makes the politician wise,\r\nAnd see through all things with his half-shut eyes.)\r\nSent up in vapors to the baron's brain\r\nNew stratagems, the radiant lock to gain.\r\n\r\nPope often broke the slumbers of his servant at night by calling him to\r\nprepare a cup of coffee; but for regular serving, it was his custom to\r\ngrind and to prepare it upon the table.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cowper's fine tribute to \"the cups that cheer but not\r\ninebriate\", a phrase which he is said to have borrowed from Bishop\r\nBerkeley, was addressed to tea and not to coffee, to which it has not\r\ninfrequently been wrongfully attributed. It is one of the most pleasing\r\npictures in _The Task_.\r\n\r\nCowper refers to coffee but once in his writings. In his _Pity for Poor\r\nAfricans_ he expresses himself as \"shocked at the ignorance of slaves\":\r\n\r\nI pity them greatly, but I must be mum\r\nFor how could we do without sugar and rum?\r\nEspecially sugar, so needful we see;\r\nWhat! Give up our desserts, our coffee and tea?\r\n\r\nthus contenting himself, like many others, with words of pity where more\r\nactive protest might sacrifice his personal ease and comfort.\r\n\r\nLeigh Hunt (1784-1859), and John Keats (1795-1834), were worshippers at\r\nthe shrine of coffee; while Charles Lamb, famous poet, essayist,\r\nhumorist, and critic, has celebrated in verse the exploit of Captain de\r\nClieu in the following delightful verses:\r\n\r\nTHE COFFEE SLIPS\r\n\r\nWhene'er I fragrant coffee drink,\r\nI on the generous Frenchman think,\r\nWhose noble perseverance bore\r\nThe tree to Martinico's shore.\r\nWhile yet her colony was new,\r\nHer island products but a few;\r\nTwo shoots from off a coffee tree\r\nHe carried with him o'er the sea.\r\nEach little tender coffee slip\r\nHe waters daily in the ship.\r\nAnd as he tends his embryo trees.\r\nFeels he is raising 'midst the seas\r\nCoffee groves, whose ample shade\r\nShall screen the dark Creolian maid.\r\nBut soon, alas! His darling pleasure\r\nIn watching this his precious treasure\r\nIs like to fade--for water fails\r\nOn board the ship in which he sails.\r\nNow all the reservoirs are shut.\r\nThe crew on short allowance put;\r\nSo small a drop is each man's share.\r\nFew leavings you may think there are\r\nTo water these poor coffee plants--\r\nBut he supplies their grasping wants,\r\nEven from his own dry parched lips\r\nHe spares it for his coffee slips.\r\nWater he gives his nurslings first,\r\nEre he allays his own deep thirst,\r\nLest, if he first the water sip,\r\nHe bear too far his eager lip.\r\nHe sees them droop for want of more;\r\nYet when they reach the destined shore,\r\nWith pride the heroic gardener sees\r\nA living sap still in his trees.\r\nThe islanders his praise resound;\r\nCoffee plantations rise around;\r\nAnd Martinico loads her ships\r\nWith produce from those dear-saved slips.\r\n\r\nIn John Keats' amusing fantasy, _Cap and Bells_, the Emperor Elfinan\r\ngreets Hum, the great soothsayer, and offers him refreshment:\r\n\r\n\"You may have sherry in silver, hock in gold, or glass'd champagne\r\n    ... what cup will you drain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Commander of the Faithful!\" answered Hum,\r\n\"In preference to these, I'll merely taste\r\nA thimble-full of old Jamaica rum.\"\r\n\"A simple boon,\" said Elfinan; \"thou mayst\r\nHave Nantz, with which my morning coffee's laced.\"\r\n\r\nBut Hum accepts the glass of Nantz, without the coffee, \"made racy with\r\nthe third part of the least drop of _crème de citron_, crystal clear.\"\r\n\r\nNumerous broadsides printed in London, 1660 to 1675, have been referred\r\nto in chapter X. Few of them possess real literary merit.\r\n\r\n\"Coffee and Crumpets\" has been much quoted. It was published in\r\n_Fraser's Magazine_, in 1837. Its author calls himself \"Launcelot\r\nLittledo\". The poem is quite long, and only those portions are printed\r\nhere that refer particularly to \"Yemen's fragrant berry\":\r\n\r\nCOFFEE AND CRUMPETS\r\n\r\n_By Launcelot Littledo of Pump Court, Temple, Barrister-at-law._\r\n\r\nThere's ten o'clock! From Hampstead to the Tower\r\nThe bells are chanting forth a lusty carol;\r\nWrangling, with iron tongues, about the hour,\r\nLike fifty drunken fishwives at a quarrel;\r\nCautious policemen shun the coming shower;\r\nThompson and Fearon tap another barrel;\r\n\"_Dissolve frigus, lignum super foco.\r\nLarge reponens._\" Now, come Orinoco!\r\n\r\nTo puff away an hour, and drink a cup,\r\nA brimming _breakfast_-cup of ruddy Mocha--\r\nClear, luscious, dark, like eyes that lighten up\r\nThe raven hair, fair cheek, and _bella boca_\r\nOf Florence maidens. I can never sup\r\nOf perigourd, but (_guai a chi la tocca!_)\r\nI'm doomed to indigestion. So to settle\r\nThis strife eternal,--Betty, bring the kettle!\r\n\r\nCoffee! oh, Coffee! Faith, it is surprising.\r\n'Mid all the poets, good, and bad, and worse.\r\nWho've scribbled (Hock or Chian eulogizing)\r\nPost and papyrus with \"Immortal verse\"--\r\nMelodiously similitudinising\r\nIn Sapphics languid or Alcaics terse\r\nNo one, my little brown Arabian berry,.\r\nHath sung thy praises--'tis surprising! very!\r\n\r\nWere I a poet now, whose ready rhymes.\r\nLike Tommy Moore's, came tripping to their places--\r\nReeling along a merry troll of chimes,\r\nWith careless truth,--a dance of fuddled Graces;\r\nHear it--_Gazette_, _Post_, _Herald_, _Standard_, _Times_,\r\nI'd write an epic! Coffee for its basis;\r\nSweet as e'er warbled forth from cockney throttles\r\nSince Bob Montgomery's or Amos Cottle's.\r\n\r\nThou sleepy-eyed Chinese--enticing siren,\r\nPekoe! the Muse hath said in praise of thee,\r\n\"That cheers but not inebriates\"; and Byron\r\nHath called thy sister \"Queen of Tears\", Bohea!\r\nAnd he, Anacreon of Rome's age of iron,\r\nSays, how untruly \"_Quis non potius te_.\"\r\nWhile coffee, thou--bill-plastered gables say,\r\nArt like old Cupid, \"roasted every day.\"\r\n\r\nI love, upon a rainy night, as this is,\r\nWhen rarely and more rare the coaches rattle\r\nFrom street to street, to sip thy fragrant kisses;\r\nWhile from the Strand remote some drunken battle\r\nFar-faintly echoes, and the kettle hisses\r\nUpon the glowing hob. No tittle-tattle\r\nTo make a single thought of mine an alien\r\nFrom thee, my coffee-pot, my fount Castalian.\r\n\r\nThe many intervening verses cover an unhappy termination to an otherwise\r\ndelightful ball. He is sitting with his charming \"Mary\", about to ask\r\nher to be his bride, when the unfortunate overturning of a glass of red\r\nwine into her white satin gown, at the same time overthrows all his\r\ndreams of bliss, \"for the shrew displaces the angel he adored\", and he\r\nresigns himself to the life of \"a man in chambers.\"\r\n\r\n'Tis thus I sit and sip, and sip and think.\r\nAnd think and sip again, and dip in _Fraser_,\r\nA health, King Oliver! to thee I drink:\r\nLong may the public have thee to amaze her.\r\nLike _Figaro_, thou makest one's eyelids wink,\r\nTwirling on practised palm thy polished razor--\r\nTrue Horace temper, smoothed on attic strop;\r\nAh! thou couldst \"_faire la barbe a tout l'Europe_.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCome, Oliver, and tell us what the news is;\r\nAn easy chair awaits thee--come and fill 't.\r\nCome, I invoke thee, as they do the muses,\r\nAnd thou shalt choose thy tipple as thou wilt.\r\nAnd if thy lips my sober cup refuses,\r\nFor ruddier drops the purple grape has spilt,\r\nWe can sing, sipping in alternate verses,\r\nThy drink and mine, like Corydon and Thyrsis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFill the bowl, but not with wine.\r\nPotent port, or fiery sherry;\r\nFor this milder cup of mine\r\nCrush me Yemen's fragrant berry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGentle is the grape's deep cluster,\r\nBut the wine's a wayward child;\r\nNectar _this_! of meeker lustre--\r\n_This_ the cup that \"draws it mild.\"\r\nDeeply drink its streams divine--\r\nFill the cup, but not with wine.\r\n\r\nPrior and Montague inserted the following poetic vignette in their _City\r\nMouse and Country Mouse_, written in burlesque of Dryden's _Hind and\r\nPanther_:\r\n\r\nThen on they jogg'd; and since an hour of talk\r\nMight cut a banter on the tedious walk,\r\nAs I remember, said the sober mouse,\r\nI've heard much talk of the Wits' Coffee-house;\r\nThither, says Brindle, thou shalt go and see\r\nPriests supping coffee, sparks and poets tea;\r\nHere rugged frieze, there quality well drest,\r\nThese baffling the grand Senior, those the Test,\r\nAnd there shrewd guesses made, and reasons given,\r\nThat human laws were never made in heaven;\r\nBut, above all, what shall oblige thy sight,\r\nAnd fill thy eyeballs with a vast delight,\r\nIs the poetic judge of sacred wit,\r\nWho does i' th' darkness of his glory sit;\r\nAnd as the moon who first receives the light,\r\nWith which she makes these nether regions bright,\r\nSo does he shine, reflecting from afar\r\nThe rays he borrowed from a better star;\r\nFor rules, which from Corneille and Rapin flow,\r\nAdmired by all the scribbling herd below,\r\nFrom French tradition while he does dispense\r\nUnerring truths, 't is schism, a damned offense,\r\nTo question his, or trust your private sense.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey Sephton, an English poet and novelist, many years resident in\r\nVienna, whose fantastic stories and fairy tales are well known in\r\nEurope, has written the following sonnets on coffee:\r\n\r\nTO THE MIGHTY MONARCH, KING KAUHEE[350]\r\n\r\n_By Geoffrey Sephton_\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nAway with opiates! Tantalising snares\r\nTo dull the brain with phantoms that are not.\r\nLet no such drugs the subtle senses rot\r\nWith visions stealing softly unawares\r\nInto the chambers of the soul. Nightmares\r\nRide in their wake, the spirits to besot.\r\nSeek surer means, to banish haunting cares:\r\nPlace on the board the steaming Coffee-pot!\r\nO'er luscious fruit, dessert and sparkling flask,\r\nLet proudly rule as King the Great Kauhee,\r\nFor he gives joy divine to all that ask,\r\nTogether with his spouse, sweet _Eau de Vie_\r\nOh, let us 'neath his sovran pleasure bask.\r\nCome, raise the fragrant cup and bend the knee!\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nO great Kauhee, thou democratic Lord,\r\nBorn 'neath the tropic sun and bronzed to splendour\r\nIn lands of Wealth and Wisdom, who can render\r\nSuch service to the wandering Human Horde\r\nAs thou at every proud or humble board?\r\nBeside the honest workman's homely fender,\r\n'Mid dainty dames and damsels sweetly tender,\r\nIn china, gold and silver, have we poured\r\nThy praise and sweetness, Oriental King.\r\nOh, how we love to hear the kettle sing\r\nIn joy at thy approach, embodying\r\nThe bitter, sweet and creamy sides of life;\r\nFriend of the People, Enemy of Strife,\r\nSons of the Earth have born thee labouring.\r\n\r\nIn America, too, poets have sung in praise of coffee. The somewhat\r\ndoubtful \"kind that mother used to make\" is celebrated in James Whitcomb\r\nRiley's classic poem:\r\n\r\nLIKE HIS MOTHER USED TO MAKE[351]\r\n\r\n_\"Uncle Jake's Place,\" St. Jo., Mo., 1874._\r\n\r\n\"I was born in Indiany,\" says a stranger, lank and slim,\r\nAs us fellers in the restaurant was kindo' guyin' him,\r\nAnd Uncle Jake was slidin' him another punkin pie\r\nAnd a' extry cup o' coffee, with a twinkle in his eye--\r\n\"I was born in Indiany--more'n forty years ago--\r\nAnd I hain't ben back in twenty--and I'm work-in' back'ards slow;\r\nBut I've et in ever' restarunt twixt here and Santy Fee,\r\nAnd I want to state this coffee tastes like gittin' home, to me!\"\r\n\"Pour us out another. Daddy,\" says the feller, warmin' up,\r\nA-speakin' crost a saucerful, as Uncle tuk his cup--\r\n\"When I see yer sign out yander,\" he went on, to Uncle Jake--\r\n\"'Come in and git some coffee like yer mother used to make'--\r\nI thought of _my_ old mother, and the Posey county farm,\r\nAnd me a little kid again, a-hangin' in her arm,\r\nAs she set the pot a-bilin', broke the eggs and poured 'em in\"--\r\nAnd the feller kindo' halted, with a trimble in his chin;\r\nAnd Uncle Jake he fetched the feller's coffee back, and stood\r\nAs solemn, fer a minute, as a' undertaker would;\r\nThen he sorto' turned and tiptoed to'rds the kitchen door--and next,\r\nHere comes his old wife out with him, a-rubbin' of her specs--\r\nAnd she rushes fer the stranger, and she hollers out, \"It's him!--\r\nThank God we've met him comin'!--Don't you know yer mother, Jim?\"\r\nAnd the feller, as he grabbed her, says,--\"You bet I hain't forgot--\r\nBut,\" wipin' of his eyes, says he, \"yer coffee's mighty hot!\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most delightful coffee poems in English is Francis Saltus'\r\n(d. 1889) sonnet on \"the voluptuous berry\", as found in _Flasks and\r\nFlagons_:\r\n\r\nCOFFEE\r\n\r\nVoluptuous berry! Where may mortals find\r\nNectars divine that can with thee compare,\r\nWhen, having dined, we sip thy essence rare,\r\nAnd feel towards wit and repartee inclined?\r\n\r\nThou wert of sneering, cynical Voltaire,\r\nThe only friend; thy power urged Balzac's mind\r\nTo glorious effort; surely Heaven designed\r\nThy devotees superior joys to share.\r\n\r\nWhene'er I breathe thy fumes, 'mid Summer stars,\r\nThe Orient's splendent pomps my vision greet.\r\nDamascus, with its myriad minarets, gleams!\r\nI see thee, smoking, in immense bazaars,\r\nOr yet, in dim seraglios, at the feet\r\nOf blond Sultanas, pale with amorous dreams!\r\n\r\nArthur Gray, in _Over the Black Coffee_ (1902) has made the following\r\ncontribution to the poetry of coffee, with an unfortunate reflection on\r\ntea, which might well have been omitted:\r\n\r\nCOFFEE\r\n\r\nO, boiling, bubbling, berry, bean!\r\nThou consort of the kitchen queen--\r\nBrowned and ground of every feature,\r\nThe only aromatic creature,\r\nFor which we long, for which we feel,\r\nThe breath of morn, the perfumed meal.\r\n\r\nFor what is tea? It can but mean,\r\nMerely the mildest go-between.\r\nInsipid sobriety of thought and mind\r\nIt \"cuts no figure\"--we can find--\r\nSave peaceful essays, gentle walks,\r\nPurring cats, old ladies' talks--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut coffee! can other tales unfold.\r\nIts history's written round and bold--\r\nBrave buccaneers upon the \"Spanish Main\",\r\nThe army's march across the lenght'ning plain,\r\nThe lone prospector wandering o'er the hill,\r\nThe hunter's camp, thy fragrance all distill.\r\n\r\nSo here's a health to coffee! Coffee hot!\r\nA morning toast! Bring on another pot.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Tea and Coffee Trade Journal_ published in 1909 the following\r\nexcellent stanzas by William A. Price:\r\n\r\nAN ODE TO COFFEE\r\n\r\nOh, thou most fragrant, aromatic joy, impugned, abused, and often stormed\r\n against,\r\nAnd yet containing all the blissfulness that in a tiny cup could be\r\n condensed!\r\nGive thy contemners calm, imperial scorn--\r\nFor thou wilt reign through ages yet unborn!\r\n\r\nSome ancient Arab, so the legend tells, first found thee--may his memory be\r\n blest!\r\nThe world-wide sign of brotherhood today, the binding tie between the East\r\n and West!\r\nGood coffee pleases in a Persian dell,\r\nAnd Blackfeet Indians make it more than well.\r\n\r\nThe lonely traveler in the desert range, if thou art with him, smiles at\r\n eventide--\r\nThe sailor, as thy perfume bubbles forth, laughs at the ocean as it rages\r\n wide--\r\nAnd where the camps of fighting men are found\r\nThy fragrance hovers o'er each battleground.\r\n\r\n\"Use, not abuse, the good things of this life\"--that is a motto from the\r\n Prophet's days,\r\nAnd, dealing with thee thus, we ne'er shall come to troublous times or\r\n parting of the ways.\r\nComfort and solace both endure with thee,\r\nRich, royal berry of the coffee tree!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _New York Tribune_ published in 1915 the following lines by Louis\r\nUntermeyer, which were subsequently included in his \"---- _and Other\r\nPoets_.\"[352]\r\n\r\nGILBERT K. CHESTERTON RISES TO THE TOAST OF COFFEE\r\n\r\nStrong wine it is a mocker; strong wine it is a beast.\r\nIt grips you when it starts to rise; it is the Fabled Yeast.\r\nYou should not offer ale or beer from hops that are freshly picked,\r\nNor even Benedictine to tempt a benedict.\r\nFor wine has a spell like the lure of hell, and the devil has mixed the\r\n brew;\r\nAnd the friends of ale are a sort of pale and weary, witless crew--\r\nAnd the taste of beer is a sort of a queer and undecided brown--\r\nBut, comrades, I give you coffee--drink it up, drink it down.\r\nWith a fol-de-rol-dol and a fol-de-rol-dee, etc.\r\n\r\nOh, cocoa's the drink for an elderly don who lives with an elderly niece;\r\nAnd tea is the drink for studios and loud and violent peace--\r\nAnd brandy's the drink that spoils the clothes when the bottle breaks in\r\n the trunk;\r\nBut coffee's the drink that is drunken by men who will never be drunk.\r\nSo, gentlemen, up with the festive cup, where Mocha and Java unite;\r\nIt clears the head when things are said too brilliant to be bright!\r\nIt keeps the stars from the golden bars and the lips of the tipsy town;\r\nSo, here's to strong, black coffee--drink it up, drink it down!\r\nWith a fol-de-rol-dol and a fol-de-rol-dee, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American breakfast cup is celebrated in up-to-date American style in\r\nthe following by Helen Rowland in the _New York Evening World_:\r\n\r\nWHAT EVERY WIFE KNOWS\r\n\r\nGive me a man who drinks good, hot, dark, strong coffee for breakfast!\r\nA man who smokes a good, dark, fat cigar after dinner!\r\nYou may marry your milk-faddist, or your anti-coffee crank, as you will!\r\nBut I know the magic of the coffee pot!\r\nLet me make my Husband's coffee--and I care not who makes eyes at him!\r\nGive me two matches a day--\r\nOne to start the coffee with, at breakfast, and one for his cigar, after\r\n dinner!\r\nAnd I defy all the houris in Christendom to light a new flame in his heart!\r\n\r\nOh, sweet supernal coffee-pot!\r\nGentle panacea of domestic troubles,\r\nFaithful author of that sweet nepenthe which deadens all the ills that\r\n married folks are heir to.\r\nCheery, glittering, soul-soothing, warmed hearted, inanimate friend!\r\nWhat wife can fail to admit the peace and serenity she owes to _you_?\r\nTo you, who stand between her and all her early morning troubles--\r\nBetween her and the before-breakfast grouch--\r\nBetween her and the morning-after headache--\r\nBetween her and the cold-gray-dawn scrutiny?\r\nTo you, who supply the golden nectar that stimulates the jaded masculine\r\n soul,\r\nSoothes the shaky masculine nerves, stirs the fagged masculine mind,\r\n inspires the slow masculine sentiment,\r\nAnd starts the sluggish blood a-flowing and the whole day right!\r\n\r\nWhat is it, I ask you, when he comes down to breakfast dry of mouth, and\r\n touchy of temper--\r\nThat gives him pause, and silences that scintillating barb of sarcasm on\r\n the tip of his tongue,\r\nWith which he meant to impale you?\r\nIt is the sweet aroma of the coffee-pot--the thrilling thought of that\r\n first delicious sip!\r\n\r\nWhat is it, on the morning after the club dance,\r\nThat hides your weary, little, washed-out face and straggling, uncurled\r\n coiffure from his critical eyes?\r\nIt is the generous coffee-pot, standing like a guardian angel between you\r\n and him!\r\nAnd in those many vital psychological moments, during the honeymoon, which\r\n decide for or against the romance and happiness of all the rest of married\r\n life--\r\nThose critical before-breakfast moments when temperament meets temperament,\r\n and will meets \"won't\"--\r\nWhat is it that halts you on the brink of tragedy,\r\nAnd distracts you from the temptation to answer back?\r\nIt is the absorbing anxiety of watching the coffee boil!\r\nWhat is it that warms his veins and soothes your nerves,\r\nAnd turns all the world suddenly from a dismal gray vale of disappointment\r\n to a bright rosy garden of hope--\r\nAnd starts _another_ day gliding smoothly along like a new motor car?\r\nWhat is it that will do more to transform a man from a fiend into an angel\r\n than baptism in the River Jordan?\r\n_It is the first cup of coffee in the morning!_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee in Dramatic Literature_\r\n\r\nCoffee was first \"dramatized\", so to speak, in England, where we read\r\nthat Charles II and the Duke of Yorke attended the first performance of\r\n_Tarugo's Wiles, or the Coffee House_, a comedy, in 1667, which Samuel\r\nPepys described as \"the most ridiculous and insipid play I ever saw in\r\nmy life.\" The author was Thomas St. Serf. The piece opens in a lively\r\nmanner, with a request on the part of its fashionable hero for a change\r\nof clothes. Accordingly, Tarugo puts off his \"vest, hat, perriwig, and\r\nsword,\" and serves the guests to coffee, while the apprentice acts his\r\npart as a gentleman customer. Presently other \"customers of all trades\r\nand professions\" come dropping into the coffee house. These are not\r\nalways polite to the supposed coffee-man; one complains of his coffee\r\nbeing \"nothing but warm water boyl'd with burnt beans,\" while another\r\ndesires him to bring \"chocolette that's prepar'd with water, for I hate\r\nthat which is encouraged with eggs.\" The pedantry and nonsense uttered\r\nby a \"schollar\" character is, perhaps, an unfair specimen of\r\ncoffee-house talk; it is especially to be noticed that none of the\r\nguests ventures upon the dangerous ground of politics.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the coffee-master grows tired of his clownish visitors,\r\nsaying plainly, \"This rudeness becomes a suburb tavern rather than my\r\ncoffee house\"; and with the assistance of his servants he \"thrusts 'em\r\nall out of doors, after the schollars and customers pay.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1694, there was published Jean Baptiste Rosseau's comedy, _Le Caffè_,\r\nwhich appears to have been acted only once in Paris, although a later\r\nEnglish dramatist says it met with great applause in the French capital.\r\n_Le Caffè_ was written in Laurent's café, which was frequented by\r\nFontenelle, Houdard de la Motte, Dauchet, the abbé Alary Boindin, and\r\nothers. Voltaire said that \"this work of a young man without any\r\nexperience either of the world of letters or of the theater seems to\r\nherald a new genius.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time it was the fashion for the coffee-house keepers of\r\nParis, and the waiters, to wear Armenian costumes; for Pascal had\r\nbuilded better than he knew. In _La Foire Saint-Germain_, a comedy by\r\nDancourt, played in 1696, one of the principal characters is old\r\n\"Lorange, a coffee merchant clothed as an Armenian\". In scene 5, he says\r\nto Mlle. Mousset, \"a seller of house dresses\" that he has been \"a\r\nnaturalized Armenian for three weeks.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Susannah Centlivre (1667?-1723), in her comedy, _A Bold Stroke for\r\na Wife_, produced about 1719, has a scene laid in Jonathan's coffee\r\nhouse about that period. While the stock jobbers are talking in the\r\nfirst scene of act II, the coffee boys are crying, \"Fresh Coffee,\r\ngentlemen, fresh coffee?... Bohea tea, gentlemen?\"\r\n\r\nHenry Fielding (1707-1754) published \"_The Coffee-House Politician, or\r\nJustice caught in his own trap_,\" a comedy, in 1730.\r\n\r\n_The Coffee House, a dramatick Piece by James Miller_, was performed at\r\nthe Theater Royal in Drury Lane in 1737. The interior of Dick's coffee\r\nhouse figured as an engraved frontispiece to the published version of\r\nthe play.\r\n\r\nThe author states in the preface that \"this piece is partly taken from a\r\ncomedy of one act written many years ago in French by the famous\r\nRosseau, called 'Le Caffè', which met with great applause in Paris.\"\r\nThe coffee house in the play is conducted by the Widow Notable, who has\r\na pretty daughter for whom, like all good mothers, she is anxious to\r\narrange a suitable marriage.\r\n\r\nIn the first scene, an acrimonious conversation takes place between\r\nPuzzle, the Politician, and Bays, the poet, in which squabble the Pert\r\nBeau and the Solemn Beau, and other habitués of the place take part.\r\nPuzzle discovers that a comedian and other players are in the room, and\r\ninsists that they be ejected or forbidden the house. The Widow is justly\r\nincensed, and indignantly replies:\r\n\r\n     Forbid the Players my House, Sir! Why, Sir, I get more by them in a\r\n     Week than I do by you in seven Years. You come here and hold a\r\n     paper in your hand for an Hour, disturb the whole Company with your\r\n     Politics, call for Pen and Ink, Paper and Wax, beg a Pipe of\r\n     Tobacco, burn out half a Candle, eat half a Pound of Sugar, and\r\n     then go away, and pay Two-pence for a Dish of Coffee. I could soon\r\n     shut up my doors, if I had not some other good People to make\r\n     amends for what I lose by such as you, Sir.\r\n\r\nAll join the Widow in scoffing and jeering, and exit the highly\r\ndiscomfited Puzzle. The pretty little Kitty tricks her mother with the\r\naid of the Player, and marries the man of her choice, but is forgiven\r\nwhen he is found to be a gentleman of the Temple.\r\n\r\nThe play is in one act and has several songs. The last is one of five\r\nstanzas, with music \"set by Mr. Caret:\"\r\n\r\nSONG\r\n\r\nWhat Pleasures a Coffee-House daily bestows!\r\nTo read and hear how the World merrily goes;\r\nTo laugh, sing and prattle of This, That, and T' other;\r\nAnd be flatter'd and ogl'd and kiss'd too, like Mother.\r\n\r\nHere the Rake, after Roving and Tipling all Night,\r\nFor his Groat in the Morning may set his Head right.\r\nAnd the Beau, who ne'er fouls his White fingers with Brass,\r\nMay have his Sixpen' worth of--Stare in the Glass.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, who'd always be ready to kill,\r\nMay ev'ry Day here take his Stand, if he will;\r\nAnd the soldier, who'd bluster and challenge secure,\r\nMay draw boldly here, for--we'll hold him he's sure.\r\n\r\nThe Lawyer, who's always in quest of his Prey,\r\nMay find fools here to feed upon every Day;\r\nAnd the sage Politician, in Coffee-Grounds known,\r\nMay point out the Fate of each Crown but--his own.\r\n\r\nThen, Gallants, since ev'rything here you may find\r\nThat pleasures the Fancy or profits the Mind,\r\nCome all, and take each a full Dish of Delight,\r\nAnd crowd up our Coffee-House every night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SONG FROM \"THE COFFEE HOUSE\"]\r\n\r\nJohn Timbs tells us this play \"met with great opposition on its\r\nrepresentation, owing to its being stated that the characters were\r\nintended for a particular family (that of Mrs. Yarrow and her daughter)\r\nwho kept Dick's, the coffee-house which the artist had inadvertently\r\nselected as the frontispiece. It appears,\" Timbs continues, \"that the\r\nlandlady and her daughter were the reigning toast of the Templars, who\r\nthen frequented Dick's; and took the matter up so strongly that they\r\nunited to condemn the farce on the night of its production; they\r\nsucceeded, and even extended their resentment to everything suspected to\r\nbe this author's (the Rev. James Miller) for a considerable time after.\"\r\n\r\nCarlo Goldoni, who has been called the Molière of Italy, wrote _La\r\nBottega di Caffè_, (The Coffee House), a naturalistic comedy of\r\nbourgeois Venice, satirizing scandal and gambling, in 1750. The scene is\r\na Venetian coffee house (probably Florian's), where several actions take\r\nplace simultaneously. Among several remarkable studies is one of a\r\nprattling slanderer, Don Marzio, which ranks as one of the finest bits\r\nof original character drawing the stage has ever seen. The play was\r\nproduced in English by the Chicago Theatre Society in 1912.\r\nChatfield-Taylor[353] thinks Voltaire probably imitated _La Bottega di\r\nCaffè_ in his _Le Café, ou l'Ecossaise_. Goldoni was a lover of coffee,\r\na regular frequenter of the coffee houses of his time, from which he\r\ndrew much in the way of inspiration. Pietro Longhi, called the Venetian\r\nHogarth, in one of his pictures presenting life and manners in Venice\r\nduring the years of her decadence, shows Goldoni as a visitor in a café\r\nof the period, with a female mendicant soliciting alms. It is in the\r\ncollection of Professor Italico Brass.\r\n\r\nGoldoni, in the comedy _The Persian Wife_, gives us a glimpse of coffee\r\nmaking in the middle of the eighteenth century. He puts these words into\r\nthe mouth of Curcuma, the slave:\r\n\r\nHere is the coffee, ladies, coffee native of Arabia,\r\nAnd carried by the caravans into Ispahan.\r\nThe coffee of Arabia is certainly always the best.\r\nWhile putting forth its leaves on one side, upon the other the flowers\r\n appear;\r\nBorn of a rich soil, it wishes shade, or but little sun.\r\nPlanted every three years is this little tree in the surface of the soil.\r\nThe fruit, though truly very small,\r\nShould yet grow large enough to become somewhat green.\r\nLater, when used, it should be freshly ground.\r\nKept in a warm and dry place and jealously guarded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut a small quantity is needed to prepare it.\r\nPut in the desired quantity and do not spill it over the fire;\r\nHeat it till the foam rises, then let it subside again away from the fire;\r\nDo this seven times at least, and coffee is made in a moment.\r\n\r\nIn 1760 there appeared in France _Le Café, ou l'Ecossaise, comédie_,\r\nwhich purported to have been written by a Mr. Hume, an Englishman, and\r\nto have been translated into French. It was in reality the work of\r\nVoltaire, who had brought out another play, _Socrates_, in the same\r\nmanner a short time before. _Le Café_, was translated into English the\r\nsame year under the title _The Coffee House, or Fair Fugitive_. The\r\ntitle page says the play is written by \"Mr. Voltaire\" and translated\r\nfrom the French. It is a comedy in five acts. The principal characters\r\nare: Fabrice, a good-natured man and the keeper of the coffee house;\r\nConstantia, the fair fugitive; Sir William Woodville, a gentleman of\r\ndistinction under misfortune; Belmont, in love with Constantia, a man of\r\nfortune and interest; Freeport, a merchant and an epitome of English\r\nmanners; Scandal, a sharper; and Lady Alton, in love with Belmont.\r\n\r\n_Il Caffè di Campagna_, a play with music by Galuppi, appeared in Italy\r\nin 1762.\r\n\r\nAnother Italian play, a comedy called _La Caffettiéra da Spirito_ was\r\nproduced in 1807.\r\n\r\n_Hamilton_, a play by Mary P. Hamlin and George Arliss, the latter also\r\nplaying the title rôle, was produced in America by George C. Tyler in\r\n1918. The first-act scene is laid in the Exchange coffee house of\r\nPhiladelphia, during the period of Washington's first administration.\r\nAmong the characters introduced in this scene are James Monroe, Count\r\nTallyrand, General Philip Schuyler, and Thomas Jefferson.\r\n\r\nThe authors very faithfully reproduce the atmosphere of the coffee house\r\nof Washington's time. As Tallyrand remarks, \"Everybody comes to see\r\neverybody at the Exchange Coffee House.... It is club, restaurant,\r\nmerchants' exchange, everything.\"\r\n\r\n_The Autocrat of the Coffee Stall_, a play in one act, by Harold Chapin,\r\nwas published in New York in 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee and Literature in General_\r\n\r\nAn interesting book might be written on the transformation that tea and\r\ncoffee have wrought in the tastes of famous literary men. And of the two\r\nstimulants, coffee seems to have furnished greater refreshment and\r\ninspiration to most. However, both beverages have made civilization\r\ntheir debtor in that they weaned so many fine minds from the heavy wines\r\nand spirits in which they once indulged.\r\n\r\nVoltaire and Balzac were the most ardent devotees of coffee among the\r\nFrench _literati_. Sir James Mackintosh (1765-1832), the Scottish\r\nphilosopher and statesman, was so fond of coffee that he used to assert\r\nthat the powers of a man's mind would generally be found to be\r\nproportional to the quantity of that stimulant which he drank. His\r\nbrilliant schoolmate and friend, Robert Hall (1764-1831), the Baptist\r\nminister and pulpit orator, preferred tea, of which he sometimes drank a\r\ndozen cups. Cowper; Parson and Parr, the famous Greek scholars; Dr.\r\nSamuel Johnson; and William Hazlitt, the writer and critic, were great\r\ntea drinkers; but Burton, Dean Swift, Addison, Steele, Leigh Hunt, and\r\nmany others, celebrated coffee.\r\n\r\nDr. Charles B. Reed, professor in the medical school of Northwestern\r\nUniversity, says that coffee may be considered as a type of substance\r\nthat fosters genius. History seems to bear him out. Coffee's essential\r\nqualities are so well defined, says Dr. Reed, that one critic has\r\nclaimed the ability to trace throughout the works of Voltaire those\r\nportions that came from coffee's inspiration. Tea and coffee promote a\r\nharmony of the creative faculties that permits the mental concentration\r\nnecessary to produce the masterpieces of art and literature.\r\n\r\nVoltaire (1694-1778) the king of wits, was also king of coffee drinkers.\r\nEven in his old age he was said to have consumed fifty cups daily. To\r\nthe abstemious Balzac (1799-1850) coffee was both food and drink.\r\n\r\nIn Frederick Lawton's _Balzac_ we read: \"Balzac worked hard. His habit\r\nwas to go to bed at six in the evening, sleep till twelve, and, after,\r\nto rise and write for nearly twelve hours at a stretch, imbibing coffee\r\nas a stimulant through these spells of composition.\"\r\n\r\nIn his _Treatise on Modern Stimulants_, Balzac thus describes his\r\nreaction to his most beloved stimulant:\r\n\r\n     This coffee falls into your stomach, and straightway there is a\r\n     general commotion. Ideas begin to move like the battalions of the\r\n     Grand Army on the battlefield, and the battle takes place. Things\r\n     remembered arrive at full gallop, ensign to the wind. The light\r\n     cavalry of comparisons deliver a magnificent deploying charge, the\r\n     artillery of logic hurry up with their train and ammunition, the\r\n     shafts of wit start up like sharpshooters. Similes arise, the paper\r\n     is covered with ink; for the struggle commences and is concluded\r\n     with torrents of black water, just as a battle with powder.\r\n\r\nWhen Balzac tells how Doctor Minoret, Ursule Minoret's guardian, used to\r\nregale his friends with a cup of \"Moka,\" mixed with Bourbon and\r\nMartinique, which the Doctor insisted on personally preparing in a\r\nsilver coffee pot, it is his own custom that he is detailing. His\r\nBourbon he bought only in the rue Mont Blanc (now the chaussé d'Antin);\r\nthe Martinique, in the rue des Vielles Audriettes; the Mocha, at a\r\ngrocer's in the rue de l'Université. It was half a day's journey to\r\nfetch them.\r\n\r\nThere have been notable contributions to the general literature of\r\ncoffee by French, Italian, English, and American writers. Space does not\r\npermit of more than passing mention of some of them.\r\n\r\nThe reactions of the early French and English writers have been touched\r\nupon in the chapters on the coffee houses of old London and the early\r\nParisian coffee houses, and in the history chapters dealing with the\r\nevolution of coffee drinking and coffee manners and customs.\r\n\r\nAfter Dufour, Galland, and La Roque in France, there were Count Rumford,\r\nJohn Timbs, Douglas Ellis, and Robinson in England; Jardin and Franklin\r\nin France; Belli in Italy; Hewitt, Thurber, and Walsh in America.\r\n\r\nMention has been made of coffee references in the works of Aubrey,\r\nBurton, Addison, Steele, Bacon, and D'Israeli.\r\n\r\nBrillat-Savarin (1755-1826) the great French epicure, knew coffee as few\r\nmen before him or since. In his historical elegy, contained in\r\n_Gastronomy as a Fine Art, or the Science of Good Living_, he exclaims:\r\n\r\n     You crossed and mitred abbots and bishops who dispensed the favors\r\n     of Heaven, and you the dreaded templars who armed yourselves for\r\n     the extermination of the Saracens, you knew nothing of the sweet\r\n     restoring influence of our modern chocolate, nor of the\r\n     thought-inspiring bean of Arabia--how I pity you!\r\n\r\nO. de Gourcuff's _De la Café, épître attribué à Senecé_, is deserving of\r\nhonorable mention.\r\n\r\nAn early French writer pays this tribute to the inspirational effects of\r\ncoffee:\r\n\r\n     It is a beverage eminently agreeable, inspiring and wholesome. It\r\n     is at once a stimulant, a cephalic, a febrifuge, a digestive, and\r\n     an anti-soporific; it chases away sleep, which is the enemy of\r\n     labor; it invokes the imagination, without which there can be no\r\n     happy inspiration. It expels the gout, that enemy of pleasure,\r\n     although to pleasure gout owes its birth; it facilitates digestion,\r\n     without which there can be no true happiness. It disposes to\r\n     gaiety, without which there is neither pleasure nor enjoyment; it\r\n     gives wit to those who already have it, and it even provides wit\r\n     (for some hours at least) to those who usually have it not. Thank\r\n     heaven for Coffee, for see how many blessings are concentrated in\r\n     the infusion of a small berry. What other beverage in the world can\r\n     compare with it? Coffee, at once a pleasure and a medicine; Coffee,\r\n     which nourishes at the same moment the mind, body and imagination.\r\n     Hail to thee! Inspirer of men of letters, best digestive of the\r\n     gourmand. Nectar of all men.\r\n\r\nIn Bologna, 1691, Angelo Rambaldi published _Ambrosia arabica, caffè\r\ndiscorso_. This work is divided into eighteen sections, and describes\r\nthe origin, cultivation, and roasting of the bean, as well as telling\r\nhow to prepare the beverage.\r\n\r\nDuring the time that Milan was under Spanish rule, Cesare Beccaria\r\ndirected and edited a publication entitled _Il Caffè_, which was\r\npublished from June 4, 1764, to May, 1766, \"edited in Brescia by\r\nGiammaria Rizzardi and undertaken by a little society of friends,\"\r\naccording to the salutatory. Besides the Marchese Beccaria, other\r\neditors and contributors were Pietro and Alexander Verri, Baillon,\r\nVisconti, Colpani, Longhi, Albertenghi, Frisi, and Secchi. The same\r\nperiodical, with the same editorial staff, was published also in Venice\r\nin the Typografia Pizzolato.\r\n\r\nAnother publication called _Il Caffè_, devoted to arts, letters, and\r\nscience, was published in Venice in 1850-52. Still another, having the\r\nsame name, a national weekly journal, was published in Milan, 1884-89.\r\n\r\nAn almanac, having the title _Il Caffè_, was published in Milan in 1829.\r\n\r\nA weekly paper, called _Il Caffè Pedrocchi_, was published in Padua in\r\n1846-48. It was devoted to art, literature and politics.\r\n\r\nA publication called _Coffee and Surrogates_ (tea, chocolate, saffron,\r\npepper, and other stimulants) was founded by Professor Pietro Polli, in\r\nMilan, in 1885; but was short-lived.\r\n\r\nAn early English magazine (1731) contains an account of divination by\r\ncoffee-grounds. The writer pays an unexpected visit, and \"surprised the\r\nlady and her company in close cabal over their coffee, the interest very\r\nintent upon one whom, by her address and intelligence, he guessed was a\r\ntire woman, to which she added the secret of divining by coffee grounds.\r\nShe was then in full inspiration, and with much solemnity observing the\r\natoms around the cup; on the one hand sat a widow, on the other a maiden\r\nlady. They assured me that every cast of the cup is a picture of all\r\none's life to come, and every transaction and circumstance is delineated\r\nwith the exactest certainty.\"\r\n\r\nThe advertisement used by this seer is quite interesting:\r\n\r\n     An advise is hereby given that there has lately arrived in this\r\n     city (Dublin) the famous Mrs. Cherry, the only gentlewoman truly\r\n     learned in the occult science of _tossing of coffee grounds_; who\r\n     has with uninterrupted success for some time past practiced to the\r\n     general satisfaction of her female visitants. Her hours are after\r\n     prayers are done at St. Peter's Church, until dinner.\r\n\r\n     (N.B. She never requires more than 1 oz. of coffee from a single\r\n     gentlewoman, and so proportioned for a second or third person, but\r\n     not to exceed that number at any one time.)\r\n\r\nIf the one ounce of coffee represented her payment for reading the\r\nfuture, the charge could not be considered exorbitant!\r\n\r\nEnglish writers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were\r\nnoticeably affected by coffee, and the coffee-houses of the times have\r\nbeen immortalized by them; and in many instances they themselves were\r\nimmortalized by the coffee houses and their frequenters. In the chapters\r\nalready referred to and at the close of this chapter, will be found\r\nstories, quips, and anecdotes, in which occur many names that are now\r\nfamous in art and literature.\r\n\r\nModern journalism dates from the publication, April 12, 1709, of the\r\n_Tatler_, whose editor was Sir Richard Steele (1672-1729) the Irish\r\ndramatist and essayist. He received his inspiration from the coffee\r\nhouses; and his readers were the men that knew them best. In the first\r\nissue he announced:\r\n\r\n     All accounts of gallantry, pleasure and entertainment shall be\r\n     under the article of White's Coffee House; poetry under that of\r\n     Will's Coffee House; learning under the title of Grecian; foreign\r\n     and domestic news you will have from St. James's Coffee House, and\r\n     what else I shall on any other subject offer shall be dated from my\r\n     own apartment.\r\n\r\nSteele's _Tatler_ was issued three times weekly until 1711, when it\r\nsuspended to be succeeded by the _Spectator_, whose principal\r\ncontributor was Joseph Addison (1672-1719), the essayist and poet, and\r\nSteele's school-fellow.\r\n\r\nSir Richard Steele immortalized the Don and Don Saltero's coffee house\r\nin old Chelsea in No. 34 of the _Tatler_, wherein he tells us of the\r\nnecessity of traveling to know the world, by his journey for fresh air,\r\nno farther than the village of Chelsea, of which he fancied that he\r\ncould give an immediate description--from the five fields, where the\r\nthe robbers lie in wait, to the coffee house, where the literati sit in\r\ncouncil. But he found, even in a place so near town as this, that there\r\nwere enormities and persons of eminence, whom he before knew nothing of.\r\n\r\nThe coffee house was almost absorbed by the museum, Steele says:\r\n\r\n     When I came into the coffee-house, I had not time to salute the\r\n     company, before my eyes were diverted by ten thousand gimcracks\r\n     round the room, and on the ceiling. When my first astonishment was\r\n     over, comes to me a sage of thin and meagre countenance, which\r\n     aspect made me doubt whether reading or fretting had made it so\r\n     philosophic; but I very soon perceived him to be that sort which\r\n     the ancients call \"gingivistee\", in our language \"tooth-drawers\". I\r\n     immediately had a respect for the man; for these practical\r\n     philosophers go upon a very practical hypothesis, not to cure, but\r\n     to take away the part affected. My love of mankind made me very\r\n     benevolent to Mr. Salter, for such is the name of this eminent\r\n     barber and antiquary.\r\n\r\nThe Don was famous for his punch, and for his skill on the fiddle. He\r\ndrew teeth also, and wrote verses; he described his museum in several\r\nstanzas, one of which is:\r\n\r\nMonsters of all sorts are seen:\r\n  Strange things in nature as they grew so;\r\nSome relicks of the Sheba Queen,\r\n  And fragments of the fam'd Bob Crusoe.\r\n\r\nSteele then plunges into a deep thought why barbers should go farther in\r\nhitting the ridiculous than any other set of men; and maintains that Don\r\nSaltero is descended in a right line, not from John Tradescant, as he\r\nhimself asserts, but from the memorable companion of the Knight of\r\nMancha. Steele certifies to all the worthy citizens who travel to see\r\nthe Don's rarities, that his double-barreled pistols, targets, coats of\r\nmail, his sclopeta (hand-culverin) and sword of Toledo, were left to his\r\nancestor by the said Don Quixote; and by his ancestor to all his progeny\r\ndown to Saltero. Though Steele thus goes far in favor of Don Saltero's\r\ngreat merit, he objects to his imposing several names (without his\r\nlicense) on the collection he has made, to the abuse of the good people\r\nof England; one of which is particularly calculated to deceive religious\r\npersons, to the great scandal of the well-disposed and may introduce\r\nheterodox opinions. (Among the curiosities presented by Admiral Munden\r\nwas a coffin, containing the body or relics of a Spanish saint, who had\r\nwrought miracles.) Says Steele:\r\n\r\n     He shows you a straw hat, which I know to be made by Madge Peskad,\r\n     within three miles of Bedford; and tells you \"It is Pontius\r\n     Pilate's wife's chambermaid's sister's hat.\" To my knowledge of\r\n     this very hat, it may be added that the covering of straw was never\r\n     used among the Jews, since it was demanded of them to make bricks\r\n     without it. Therefore, this is nothing but, under the specious\r\n     pretense of learning and antiquities, to impose upon the world.\r\n     There are other things which I can not tolerate among his rarities,\r\n     as, the china figure of the lady in the glass-case; the Italian\r\n     engine, for the imprisonment of those who go abroad with it; both\r\n     of which I hereby order to be taken down, or else he may expect to\r\n     have his letters patent for making punch superseded, be debarred\r\n     wearing his muff next winter, or ever coming to London without his\r\n     wife.\r\n\r\nBabillard says that Salter had an old grey muff, and that, by wearing it\r\nup to his nose, he was distinguishable at the distance of a quarter of a\r\nmile. His wife was none of the best, being much addicted to scolding;\r\nand Salter, who liked his glass, if he could make a trip to London by\r\nhimself, was in no haste to return.\r\n\r\nDon Saltero's proved very attractive as an exhibition, and drew crowds\r\nto the coffee house. A catalog was published of which were printed more\r\nthan forty editions. Smollett, the novelist, was among the donors. The\r\ncatalog, in 1760, comprehended the following rarities:\r\n\r\n     Tigers' tusks; the Pope's candle; the skeleton of a Guinea-pig; a\r\n     fly-cap monkey, a piece of the true Cross; the Four Evangelists'\r\n     heads cut out on a cherry stone; the King of Morocco's\r\n     tobacco-pipe; Mary Queen of Scots' pincushion; Queen Elizabeth's\r\n     prayer-book; a pair of Nun's stockings; Job's ears, which grew on a\r\n     tree; a frog in a tobacco stopper; and five hundred more odd\r\n     relics!\r\n\r\nThe Don had a rival, as appears by _A Catalogue of the Rarities to be\r\nseen at Adam's, at the Royal Swan, in Kingsland-road, leading from\r\nShoreditch Church, 1756_. Mr. Adams exhibited, for the entertainment of\r\nthe curious:\r\n\r\n     Miss Jenny Cameron's shoes; Adam's eldest daughter's hat; the heart\r\n     of the famous Bess Adams, that was hanged at Tyburn with Lawyer\r\n     Carr, January 18, 1736-37; Sir Walter Raleigh's tobacco pipe; Vicar\r\n     of Bray's clogs; engine to shell green peas with; teeth that grew\r\n     in a fish's belly; Black Jack's ribs; the very comb that Abraham\r\n     combed his son Isaac and Jacob's head with; Wat Tyler's spurs;\r\n     rope that cured Captain Lowry of the head-ach, ear-ach, tooth-ach,\r\n     and belly-ach; Adam's key of the fore and back door of the Garden\r\n     of Eden, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThese are only a few out of five hundred other equally marvellous\r\nexhibits.\r\n\r\nThe success of Don Saltero in attracting visitors to his coffee house,\r\ninduced the proprietor of the Chelsea bunhouse to make a similar\r\ncollection of rarities, to attract customers for his buns; and to some\r\nextent it was successful.\r\n\r\nIn the first number of the _Spectator_, Addison says:\r\n\r\n     There is no place of general resort wherein I do not often make my\r\n     appearance. Sometimes I am seen thrusting my head into a round of\r\n     politicians at Will's, and listening with great attention to the\r\n     narratives that are made in those little circular audiences.\r\n     Sometimes I smoke a pipe at Child's, and while I seem attentive to\r\n     nothing but the _Postman_, overhear the conversation of every table\r\n     in the room. I appear on Sunday nights at St. James' coffee house,\r\n     and _sometimes_ join the little committee of politics in the inner\r\n     room as one who comes there to hear and improve. My face is\r\n     likewise very well known at the Grecian, the Cocoa Tree, and in the\r\n     theatres both of Drury Lane and the Hay Market. I have been taken\r\n     for a merchant upon the Exchange for above these ten years, and\r\n     sometimes pass for a Jew in the assembly of stock jobbers at\r\n     Jonathan's; in short, wherever I see a cluster of people, I always\r\n     mix with them, though I never open my lips, but in my own club.\r\n\r\nIn the second number he tells that:\r\n\r\n     I am now settled with a widow woman, who has a great many children\r\n     and complies with my humor in everything. I do not remember that we\r\n     have exchanged a word together for these five years; my coffee\r\n     comes into my chamber every morning without asking for it, if I\r\n     want fire I point to the chimney, if water, to my basin; upon which\r\n     my landlady nods as much as to say she takes my meaning, and\r\n     immediately obeys my signals.\r\n\r\nThree of Addison's papers in the _Spectator_ (Nos. 402, 481, and 568)\r\nare humorously descriptive of the coffee houses of the period. No. 403\r\nopens with the remark that:\r\n\r\n     The courts of two countries do not so much differ from one another,\r\n     as the Court and the City, in their peculiar ways of life and\r\n     conversation. In short, the inhabitants of St. James,\r\n     notwithstanding they live under the same laws, and speak the same\r\n     language, are a distinct people from those of Cheapside, who are\r\n     likewise removed from those of the Temple on the one side, and\r\n     those of Smithfleld on the other, by several climates and degrees\r\n     in their way of thinking and conversing together.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the author takes a ramble through London and\r\nWestminster, to gather the opinions of his ingenious countrymen upon a\r\ncurrent report of the king of France's death.\r\n\r\n     I know the faces of all the principal politicians within the bills\r\n     of mortality; and as every coffee-house has some particular\r\n     statesman belonging to it, who is the mouth of the street where he\r\n     lives, I always take care to place myself near him, in order to\r\n     know his judgment on the present posture of affairs. And, as I\r\n     foresaw the above report would produce a new face of things in\r\n     Europe, and many curious speculations in our British coffee-houses,\r\n     I was very desirous to learn the thoughts of our most eminent\r\n     politicians on that occasion.\r\n\r\n     That I might begin as near the fountain-head as possible, I first\r\n     of all called in at St. James's, where I found the whole outward\r\n     room in a buzz of politics; the speculations were but very\r\n     indifferent towards the door, but grew finer as you advanced to the\r\n     upper end of the room, and were so much improved by a knot of\r\n     theorists, who sat in the inner room, within the steams of the\r\n     coffee-pot, that I there heard the whole Spanish monarchy disposed\r\n     of, and all the line of Bourbons provided for in less than a\r\n     quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\n     I afterwards called in at Giles's, where I saw a board of French\r\n     gentlemen sitting upon the life and death of their grand monarque.\r\n     Those among them who had espoused the Whig interest very positively\r\n     affirmed that he had departed this life about a week since, and\r\n     therefore, proceeded without any further delay to the release of\r\n     their friends in the galleys, and to their own re-establishment;\r\n     but, finding they could not agree among themselves, I proceeded on\r\n     my intended progress.\r\n\r\n     Upon my arrival at Jenny Man's I saw an alert young fellow that\r\n     cocked his hat upon a friend of his, who entered just at the same\r\n     time with myself, and accosted him after the following manner:\r\n     \"Well, Jack, the old prig is dead at last. Sharp's the word. Now or\r\n     never, boy. Up to the walls of Paris, directly;\" with several other\r\n     deep reflections of the same nature.\r\n\r\n     I met with very little variation in the politics between Charing\r\n     Cross and Covent Garden. And, upon my going into Will's, I found\r\n     their discourse was gone off, from the death of the French King, to\r\n     that of Monsieur Boileau, Racine, Corneille, and several other\r\n     poets, whom they regretted on this occasion as persons who would\r\n     have obliged the world with very noble elegies on the death of so\r\n     great a prince, and so eminent a patron of learning.\r\n\r\n     At a coffee-house near the Temple, I found a couple of young\r\n     gentlemen engaged very smartly in a dispute on the succession to\r\n     the Spanish monarchy. One of them seemed to have been retained as\r\n     advocate for the Duke of Anjou, the other for his Imperial Majesty.\r\n     They were both for regarding the title to that kingdom by the\r\n     statute laws of England; but finding them going out of my depth, I\r\n     pressed forward to Paul's Churchyard, where I listened with great\r\n     attention to a learned man, who gave the company an account of the\r\n     deplorable state of France during the minority of the deceased\r\n     king.\r\n\r\n     I then turned on my right hand into Fish-street, where the chief\r\n     politician of that quarter, upon hearing the news, (after having\r\n     taken a pipe of tobacco, and ruminated for some time) \"If,\" says\r\n     he, \"the King of France is certainly dead, we shall have plenty of\r\n     mackerel this season: our fishery will not be disturbed by\r\n     privateers, as it has been for these ten years past.\" He afterwards\r\n     considered how the death of this great man would affect our\r\n     pilchards, and by several other remarks infused a general joy into\r\n     his whole audience.\r\n\r\n     I afterwards entered a by-coffee-house that stood at the upper end\r\n     of a narrow lane, where I met with a Nonjuror engaged very warmly\r\n     with a laceman who was the great support of a neighboring\r\n     conventicle. The matter in debate was whether the late French King\r\n     was most like Augustus Caesar, or Nero. The controversy was carried\r\n     on with great heat on both sides, and as each of them looked upon\r\n     me very frequently during the course of their debate, I was under\r\n     some apprehension that they would appeal to me, and therefore laid\r\n     down my penny at the bar and made the best of my way to Cheapside.\r\n\r\n     I here gazed upon the signs for some time before I found one to my\r\n     purpose. The first object I met in the coffee-room was a person who\r\n     expressed a great grief for the death of the French King; but upon\r\n     his explaining himself, I found his sorrow did not arise from the\r\n     loss of the monarch, but for his having sold out of the Bank about\r\n     three days before he heard the news of it. Upon which a\r\n     haberdasher, who was the oracle of the coffee-house, and had his\r\n     circle of admirers about him, called several to witness that he had\r\n     declared his opinion, above a week before, that the French King was\r\n     certainly dead; to which he added, that considering the late\r\n     advices we had received from France, it was impossible that it\r\n     could be otherwise. As he was laying these together, and debating\r\n     to his hearers with great authority, there came a gentlemen from\r\n     Garraway's, who told us that there were several letters from France\r\n     just come in, with advice that the King was in good health, and was\r\n     gone out a hunting the very morning the post came away; upon which\r\n     the haberdasher stole off his hat that hung upon a wooden peg by\r\n     him, and retired to his shop with great confusion. This\r\n     intelligence put a stop to my travels, which I had prosecuted with\r\n     so much satisfaction; not being a little pleased to hear so many\r\n     different opinions upon so great an event, and to observe how\r\n     naturally, upon such a piece of news, every one is apt to consider\r\n     it to his particular interest and advantage.\r\n\r\nJohnson wrote in his _Life of Addison_ concerning the _Tatler_ and the\r\n_Spectator_ that they were:\r\n\r\n     Published at a time when two parties, loud, restless and violent,\r\n     each with plausible declarations, and both perhaps without any\r\n     distinct determination of its views, were agitating the nation; to\r\n     minds heated with political contest they supplied cooler and more\r\n     inoffensive reflections.... They had a perceptible influence on the\r\n     conversation of the time, and taught the frolic and the gay to\r\n     unite merriment with decency, effects which they can never wholly\r\n     lose.\r\n\r\nHarold Routh in the Cambridge _History of Literature_, speaking of the\r\n_Spectator_, says:\r\n\r\n     It surpassed the _Tatler_ in style and in thought. It gave\r\n     expression to the _power_ of commerce. For more than a century\r\n     traders had been characterized as dishonest and avaricious, because\r\n     playwrights and pamphleteers generally wrote for the leisure\r\n     classes, and were themselves too poor to have any but unpleasant\r\n     relations with men of business. Now merchants were becoming\r\n     ambassadors of civilization, and had developed intellect so as to\r\n     control distant and, as it seemed, mysterious sources of wealth; by\r\n     a stroke of the pen and largely through the coffee houses they had\r\n     come to know their own importance and power.\r\n\r\nSamuel Pepys (1633-1703) was very fond of good eating, and almost daily\r\nentries were made in his _Diary_ of dinner delicacies that he had\r\nenjoyed. One dinner, that he considered a great success, was served to\r\neight persons, and consisted of oysters, a hash of rabbits, a lamb, a\r\nrare chine of beef; next a great dish of roasting fowl (\"cost me about\r\n30 s.\") a tart, then fruit and cheese. \"My dinner was noble enough ... I\r\nbelieve this day's feast will cost me near 5 pounds.\" But it will be\r\nnoted that coffee was not mentioned as a part of the menu.\r\n\r\nHe makes countless references to visits paid to this and that coffee\r\nhouse, but records only one instance of actually drinking coffee:\r\n\r\n     Up betimes to my office, and thence at seven o'clock to Sir G.\r\n     Carteret, and there with Sir J. Minnes made an end of his accounts,\r\n     but staid not to dinner my Lady having made us drink our morning\r\n     draft there of several wines, but I drank nothing but some of her\r\n     coffee, which was poorly made, with a little sugar in it.\r\n\r\nThis note which he considered worthy of record was certainly not\r\ninspired by the excellence of the good lady's matutinal coffee.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cobbett (1762-1835) the English-American politician, reformer,\r\nand writer on economics, denounced coffee as \"slops\"; but he was one of\r\na remarkably small minority. Before his day, one of England's greatest\r\nsatirists, Dean Swift, (1667-1745) led a long roll of literary men who\r\nwere devotees of coffee.\r\n\r\nSwift's writings are full of references to coffee; and his letters from\r\nStella came to him under cover, at the St. James coffee house. There is\r\nscarcely a letter to Esther (Vanessa) Vanhomrigh which does not contain\r\na significant reference to coffee, by which the course of their\r\nfriendship and clandestine meetings may be traced. In one dated August\r\n13, 1720, written while traveling from place to place in Ireland, he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     We live here in a very dull town, every valuable creature absent,\r\n     and Cad says he is weary of it, and would rather prefer his coffee\r\n     on the barrenest mountain in Wales than be king here.\r\n\r\n  A fig for partridges and quails,\r\nYe dainties I know nothing of ye;\r\n  But on the highest mount in Wales,\r\nWould choose in peace to drink my coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another letter, about two years later, replying to one in which\r\nVanessa has reproached him and begged him to write her soon, he advises:\r\n\r\n     The best maxim I know in life, is to drink your coffee when you\r\n     can, and when you cannot, to be easy without it; while you continue\r\n     to be splenetic, count upon it I will always preach. Thus much I\r\n     sympathize with you, that I am not cheerful enough to write, for, I\r\n     believe, coffee once a week is necessary, and you know very well\r\n     that coffee makes us severe, and grave, and philosophical.\r\n\r\nThese various references to coffee are thought to have been based upon\r\nan incident in the early days of their friendship, when on the occasion\r\nof the Vanhomrigh family journeying from Dublin to London, Vanessa\r\naccidentally spilt her coffee in the chimney-place at a certain inn,\r\nwhich Swift considered a premonition of their growing friendship.\r\nWriting from Clogher, Swift reminds Vanessa:\r\n\r\n     Remember that riches are nine parts in ten of all that is good in\r\n     life, and health is the tenth--drinking coffee comes long after,\r\n     and yet it is the eleventh, but without the two former you cannot\r\n     drink it right.\r\n\r\nIn another letter he writes facetiously, in memory of her playful\r\nbadinage:\r\n\r\n     I long to drink a dish of coffee in the sluttery and hear you dun\r\n     me for a secret, and \"Drink your coffee; why don't you drink your\r\n     coffee?\"\r\n\r\nLeigh Hunt had very pleasant things to say about coffee, giving to it\r\nthe charm of appeal to the imagination, which he said one never finds in\r\ntea. For example:\r\n\r\n     Coffee, like tea, used to form a refreshment by itself, some hours\r\n     after dinner; it is now taken as a digester, right upon that meal\r\n     or the wine, and sometimes does not even close it; or the digester\r\n     itself is digested by a liquor of some sort called a _Chasse-Café_\r\n     [coffee-chaser]. We like coffee better than tea for taste, but tea\r\n     \"for a constancy.\" To be perfect in point of relish (we do not say\r\n     of wholesomeness) coffee should be strong and hot, with little milk\r\n     and sugar. It has been drunk after this mode in some parts of\r\n     Europe, but the public have nowhere, we believe, adopted it. The\r\n     favorite way of taking it at a meal, abroad, is with a great\r\n     superfluity of milk--very properly called, in France _café au lait_\r\n     (coffee _to the_ milk). One of the pleasures we receive in drinking\r\n     coffee is that, being the universal drink in the East, it reminds\r\n     of that region of the \"Arabian Nights\" as smoking does for the same\r\n     reason; though neither of these refreshments, which are identified\r\n     with Oriental manners, is to be found in that enchanting work. They\r\n     had not been discovered when it was written; the drink then was\r\n     sherbet. One can hardly fancy what a Turk or a Persian could have\r\n     done without coffee and a pipe, any more than the English ladies\r\n     and gentlemen, before the civil wars, without tea for breakfast.\r\n\r\nIn his old age, Immanuel Kant, the great metaphysician, became extremely\r\nfond of coffee; and Thomas de Quincey relates a little incident showing\r\nKant's great eagerness for the after-dinner cup.\r\n\r\n     At the beginning of the last year of his life, he fell into a\r\n     custom of taking, immediately after dinner, a cup of coffee,\r\n     especially on those days when it happened that I was of his party.\r\n     And such was the importance that he attached to his little pleasure\r\n     that he would even make a memorandum beforehand, in the blank paper\r\n     book that I had given him, that on the next day I was to dine with\r\n     him, and consequently \"_that there was to be coffee_.\" Sometimes in\r\n     the interest of conversation, the coffee was forgotten, but not for\r\n     long. He would remember and with the querulousness of old age and\r\n     infirm health would demand that coffee be brought \"upon the spot.\"\r\n     Arrangements had always been made in advance, however; the coffee\r\n     was ground, and the water was boiling: and in the very moment the\r\n     word was given, the servant shot in like an arrow and plunged the\r\n     coffee into the water. All that remained, therefore, was to give it\r\n     time to boil up. But this trifling delay seemed unendurable to\r\n     Kant. If it were said, \"Dear Professor, the coffee will be brought\r\n     up in a moment,\" he would say, _\"Will be!_ There's the rub, that it\r\n     only _will_ be.\" Then he would quiet himself with a stoical air,\r\n     and say, \"Well, one can die after all; it is but dying; and in the\r\n     next world, thank God, there is no drinking of coffee and\r\n     consequently no waiting for it.\"\r\n\r\n     When at length the servant's steps were heard upon the stairs, he\r\n     would turn round to us, and joyfully call out: \"Land, land! my dear\r\n     friends, I see land.\"\r\n\r\nThackeray (1811-1863) must have suffered many tea and coffee\r\ndisappointments. In the _Kickleburys on the Rhine_ he asks: \"Why do they\r\nalways put mud into coffee aboard steamers? Why does the tea generally\r\ntaste of boiled boots?\"\r\n\r\nIn _Arthur's_, A. Neil Lyons has preserved for all time the atmosphere\r\nof the London coffee stall. \"I would not,\" he says, \"exchange a night at\r\nArthur's for a week with the brainiest circle in London.\" The book is a\r\ncollection of short stories. As already recorded, Harold Chapin\r\ndramatized this picturesque London institution in _The Autocrat of the\r\nCoffee Stall_.\r\n\r\nIn General Horace Porter's _Campaigning with Grant_, we have three\r\ndistinct coffee incidents within fifty-odd pages; or explicitly, see\r\npages 47, 56, 101; where, deep in the fiercest snarls of The Wilderness\r\ncampaign we are treated to:\r\n\r\n     General Grant, slowly sipping his coffee ... a full ration of that\r\n     soothing army beverage.... The general made rather a singular meal\r\n     preparatory to so exhausting a day as that which was to follow. He\r\n     took a cucumber, sliced it, poured some vinegar over it, and\r\n     partook of nothing else except a cup of strong coffee.... The\r\n     general seemed in excellent spirits, and was even inclined to be\r\n     jocose. He said to me, \"We have just had our coffee, and you will\r\n     find some left for you.\" ... I drank it with the relish of a\r\n     shipwrecked mariner.\r\n\r\nOne of the first immediate supplies General Sherman desired from\r\nWilmington, on reaching Fayetteville and lines of communication in\r\nMarch, 1865, was, expressly, coffee; does he not say so himself, on page\r\n297 of the second volume of his _Memoirs_?\r\n\r\nStill more expressly, towards the close of his _Memoirs_, and among\r\nfinal recommendations, the fruit of his experiences in that whole vast\r\nwar, General Sherman says this for coffee:\r\n\r\n     Coffee has become almost indispensable, though many substitutes\r\n     were found for it, such as Indian corn, roasted, ground and boiled\r\n     as coffee, the sweet potato, and the seed of the okra plant\r\n     prepared in the same way. All these were used by the people of the\r\n     South, who for years could procure no coffee, but I noticed that\r\n     the women always begged of us real coffee, which seemed to satisfy\r\n     a natural yearning or craving more powerful than can be accounted\r\n     for on the theory of habit. Therefore I would always advise that\r\n     the coffee and sugar ration be carried along, even at the expense\r\n     of bread, for which there are many substitutes.\r\n\r\nGeorge Agnew Chamberlain's novel _Home_ contains a vivid description of\r\ncoffee-making on an old plantation, and could only have been written by\r\na devoted lover of this drink. Gerry Lansing, the American, has escaped\r\ndrowning in the river, and is now lost in the Brazilian forest. He finds\r\nhis way at last to an old plantation house:\r\n\r\n     A stove was built into the masonry, and a cavernous oven gaped from\r\n     the massive wall. At the stove was an old negress, making coffee\r\n     with shaky deliberation.... The girl and the wrinkled old woman\r\n     made him sit down at the table, and then placed before him crisp\r\n     rusks of mandioc flour and steaming coffee whose splendid aroma\r\n     triumphed over the sordidness of the scene and through the nostrils\r\n     reached the palate with anticipatory touch. It was sweetened with\r\n     dark, pungent syrup and was served black in a capacious bowl, as\r\n     though one could not drink too deeply of the elixir of life. Gerry\r\n     ate ravenously and sipped the coffee, at first sparingly, then\r\n     greedily.... Gerry set down the empty bowl with a sigh. The rusks\r\n     had been delicious. Before the coffee the name of nectar dwindled\r\n     to impotency. Its elixir rioted in his veins.\r\n\r\nIn the _Rosary_, Florence L. Barclay has a Scotch woman tell how she\r\nmakes coffee. She says:\r\n\r\n     Use a jug--it is not what you make it in; it is how ye make it. It\r\n     all hangs upon the word fresh--freshly roasted--freshly\r\n     ground--water freshly boiled. And never touch it with metal. Pop it\r\n     into an earthenware jug, pour in your boiling water straight upon\r\n     it, stir it with a wooden spoon, set it on the hob ten minutes to\r\n     settle; the grounds will all go to the bottom, though you might not\r\n     think it, and you pour it out, fragrant, strong and clear. But the\r\n     secret is, _fresh, fresh, fresh_, and don't stint your coffee.\r\n\r\nCyrus Townsend Brady's _The Corner in Coffee_ is \"a thrilling romance of\r\nthe New York coffee market.\"\r\n\r\nCoffee, Du Barry, and Louis XV figure in one scene of the story of _The\r\nMoat with the Crimson Stains_, as told by Elizabeth W. Champney in her\r\n_Romance of the Bourbon Chateaux_.[354] It tells of the German\r\napprentice Riesener, who assisted his master Oeben in designing for\r\nLouis XV a beautiful desk with a secret drawer, which it took ten years\r\nof unremitting industry to execute. At the end, Riesener was to be\r\naccepted by his master as a partner and a son-in-law. Little Victoire,\r\nwho loved to sit in a punt and trail her doll in the waters of the\r\nBievre to see to what color its frock would be changed by the dyes of\r\nthe Gobelin factory, was then only five, and Madam Oeben twenty-three.\r\nAs the years rolled by, Riesener grew to love the mother and not the\r\ndaughter, who, meanwhile, shot up into a slim girl, not of her mother's\r\nbeauty, but of a loveliness all her own. Then there was a quarrel\r\nbecause the young apprentice thought the master should have resented the\r\nsuggestion of M. Duplessis that his wife pose in the nude for the\r\nstatuettes which were to hold the sconces on the king's desk; and\r\nRiesener left in a fine youthful frenzy, vowing he would never return\r\nwhile the _maître_ lived. The latter, unable to complete the masterpiece\r\nwhich he loved more than anything else on earth, sought death, and\r\nperished in the crimson waters of the Bievre.\r\n\r\nThe _maître_ had no enemies, but his quarrel with Riesener caused a fear\r\nto spring up in the widow's heart that the apprentice might have been\r\nguilty of his murder, so she refused to see him when, hearing of his\r\nmaster's death, he returned, stricken with remorse, to finish the desk.\r\nOn it were the statuettes modeled in perfect likeness of Mlle. de\r\nVaubernier, a wily little milliner of Riesener's bohemian set who had\r\ntaken this way to bring herself to the attention of Louis XV. The ruse\r\nwas successful; and after the acceptance of the desk, there was\r\ninstalled a new _maîtresse en titre_, the notorious Madame Du Barry,\r\nerstwhile the pretty milliner, Mlle. de Vaubernier.\r\n\r\nLater, Madame Du Barry sent for the now famous _ebeniste_ (cabinet\r\nmaker); and, when her negro page Zamore admitted him, he found His\r\nMajesty Louis XV kneeling in front of the fireplace, making coffee for\r\nher while she laughed at him for scalding his fingers. He had been\r\nsummoned to show the king the mechanism of the secret drawer, so\r\ncunningly concealed in the king's desk that no one could find it. But\r\nRiesener knew not the secret of his master, who had died without\r\nrevealing it. Then the red revolution came; and when the pretty pavilion\r\nat Louveciennes was sacked, and its costly furniture hurled down the\r\ncliff to the Seine, the king's desk, shattered almost beyond repair, was\r\ncarried to the Gobelins' factory and presented to Mme. Oeben in\r\nrecognition of her husband's workmanship. Then the secret compartment\r\nwas found to have been disclosed, and Riesener was absolved by a letter\r\ntherein, from the _maître_, who intimated he was about to end it all\r\nbecause of paralysis. Riesener marries the widow and all ends happily.\r\n\r\nJames Lane Allen, in _The Kentucky Warbler_, tells a tale of the Blue\r\nGrass country and of a young hero who wanders after a bird's note to\r\nfind romance and the key to his own locked nature. Here is an incident\r\nfrom his first forest adventure:\r\n\r\n     There was one tree he curiously looked around for, positive that he\r\n     should not be blind to it if fortunate enough to set his eyes on\r\n     one--the coffee tree. That is, he felt sure he'd recognize it if it\r\n     yielded coffee ready to drink, of which never in his life had they\r\n     given him enough. Not once throughout his long troubled experience\r\n     as to being fed had he been allowed as much coffee as he craved.\r\n     Once, when younger, he had heard some one say that the only tree in\r\n     all the American forests that bore the name of Kentucky was the\r\n     Kentucky coffee tree, and he had instantly conceived a desire to\r\n     pay a visit in secret to that corner of the woods. To take his cup\r\n     and a few lumps of sugar and sit under the boughs and catch the\r\n     coffee as it dripped down.... No one to hold him back ... as much\r\n     as he wanted at last.... The Kentucky coffee tree--his favorite in\r\n     Nature!\r\n\r\nJohn Kendrick Bangs relates, in _Coffee and Repartee_[355], some amusing\r\nskirmishes indulged in at the boarding-house table, between the Idiot\r\nand the guests, where coffee served the purpose of enlivening the tilt:\r\n\r\n     \"Can't I give you another cup of coffee?\" asked the landlady of the\r\n     School Master.\r\n\r\n     \"You may,\" returned the School Master, pained at the lady's\r\n     grammar, but too courteous to call attention to it save by the\r\n     emphasis with which he spoke the word \"may\".\r\n\r\n     Said the Idiot: \"You may fill my cup too, Mrs. Smithers.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The coffee is all gone,\" returned the landlady, with a snap.\r\n\r\n     \"Then, Mary,\" said the Idiot, gracefully turning to the maid, \"you\r\n     may give me a glass of ice water. It is quite as warm, after all,\r\n     as the coffee and not quite so weak.\"\r\n\r\nOne other little skit remains at the expense of Mrs. Smithers' coffee.\r\nAt the breakfast table, where the air, as usual, is charged with\r\nrepartee, Mr. Whitechoker, the minister, says to his landlady:\r\n\r\n     \"Mrs. Smithers, I'll have a dash of hot water in my coffee, this\r\n     morning.\" Then with a glance toward the Idiot, he added, \"I think it\r\n     looks like rain.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Referring to the coffee, Mr. Whitechoker?\" queried the Idiot....\r\n\r\n     \"Ah,--I don't quite follow you,\" replied the Minister with some\r\n     annoyance.\r\n\r\n     \"You said something looked like rain, and I asked you if the thing\r\n     referred to was the coffee, for I was disposed to agree with you,\"\r\n     said the Idiot.\r\n\r\n     \"I am sure,\" put in Mrs. Smithers, \"that a gentleman of Mr.\r\n     Whitechoker's refinement would not make any such insinuation, sir.\r\n     He is not the man to quarrel with what is set before him.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I must ask your pardon, Madam,\" returned the Idiot politely. \"I\r\n     hope I am not the man to quarrel with my food, either. Indeed, I\r\n     make it a rule to avoid unpleasantness of all sorts, particularly\r\n     with the weak, under which category I find your coffee.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Quips and Anecdotes_\r\n\r\nCoffee literature is full of quips and anecdotes. Probably the most\r\nfamous coffee quip is that of Mme. de Sévigné, who, as already told in\r\nchapter XI, was wrongfully credited with saying, \"Racine and coffee will\r\npass.\" It was Voltaire in his preface to _Irene_ who thus accused the\r\namiable letter-writer; and she, being dead, could not deny it.\r\n\r\nThat Mme. de Sévigné was at one time a coffee drinker is apparent from\r\nthis quotation from one of her letters: \"The cavalier believes that\r\ncoffee gives him warmth, and I at the same time, foolish as you know me,\r\ndo not take it any longer.\"\r\n\r\nLa Roque called the beverage \"the King of Perfumes\", whose charm was\r\nenriched when vanilla was added.\r\n\r\nEmile Souvestre (1806-1854) said: \"Coffee keeps, so to say, the balance\r\nbetween bodily and spiritual nourishment.\"\r\n\r\nIsid Bourdon said: \"The discovery of coffee has enlarged the realm of\r\nillusion and given more promise to hope.\"\r\n\r\nAn old Bourbon proverb says: \"To an old man a cup of coffee is like the\r\ndoor post of an old house--it sustains and strengthens him.\"\r\n\r\nJardin says that in the Antilles, instead of orange blossoms, the brides\r\ncarry a spray of coffee blossoms; and when a woman remains unmarried,\r\nthey say she has lost her coffee branch. \"We say in France, that she has\r\n_coiffé_ Sainte-Catherine.\"\r\n\r\nFontenelle and Voltaire have both been quoted as authors of the famous\r\nreply to the remark that coffee was a slow poison: \"I think it must be,\r\nfor I've been drinking it for eighty-five years and am not dead yet.\"\r\n\r\nIn Meidinger's _German Grammar_ the \"slow-poison\" _bon mot_ is\r\nattributed to Fontenelle.\r\n\r\nIt seems reasonable to give Fontenelle credit for this _bon mot_.\r\nVoltaire died at eighty-four. Fontenelle lived to be nearly a hundred\r\nyears. Of his cheerfulness at an advanced age an anecdote is related. In\r\nconversation, one day, a lady a few years younger than Fontenelle\r\nplayfully remarked, \"Monsieur, you and I stay here so long, methinks\r\nDeath has forgotten us.\" \"Hush! Speak in a whisper, madame,\" replied\r\nFontenelle, \"_tant mieux!_ (so much the better!) don't remind him of\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nFlaubert, Hugo, Baudelaire, Paul de Kock, Théophile Gautier, Alfred de\r\nMusset, Zola, Coppée, George Sand, Guy de Maupassant, and Sarah\r\nBernhardt, all have been credited with many clever or witty sallies\r\nabout coffee.\r\n\r\nPrince Talleyrand (1754-1839), the French diplomat and wit, has given us\r\nthe cleverest summing up of the ideal cup of coffee. He said it should\r\nbe \"_Noir comme le diable, chaud comme l'enfer, pur comme un ange, doux\r\ncomme l'amour._\" Or in English, \"black as the devil, hot as hell, pure\r\nas an angel, sweet as love.\"\r\n\r\nThis quip has been wrongfully attributed to Brillat-Savarin. Talleyrand\r\nsaid also:\r\n\r\n     A cup of coffee lightly tempered with good milk detracts nothing\r\n     from your intellect; on the contrary, your stomach is freed by it,\r\n     and no longer distresses your brain; it will not hamper your mind\r\n     with troubles, but give freedom to its working. Suave molecules of\r\n     Mocha stir up your blood, without causing excessive heat; the organ\r\n     of thought receives from it a feeling of sympathy; work becomes\r\n     easier, and you will sit down without distress to your principal\r\n     repast, which will restore your body, and afford you a calm\r\n     delicious night.\r\n\r\nAmong coffee drinkers a high place must be given to Prince Bismarck\r\n(1815-1898). He liked coffee unadulterated. While with the Prussian army\r\nin France, he one day entered a country inn and asked the host if he had\r\nany chicory in the house. He had. Bismarck said: \"Well, bring it to me;\r\nall you have.\" The man obeyed, and handed Bismarck a canister full of\r\nchicory.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure this is all you have?\" demanded the chancellor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my lord, every grain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Bismarck, keeping the canister by him, \"go now and make me\r\na pot of coffee.\"\r\n\r\nThis same story has been related of François Paul Jules Grévy\r\n(1807-1891), president of France, 1879-1887. According to the French\r\nstory, Grévy never took wine, even at dinner. He was, however,\r\npassionately fond of coffee. To be certain of having his favorite\r\nbeverage of the best quality, he always, when he could, prepared it\r\nhimself. Once he was invited, with a friend, M. Bethmont, to a hunting\r\nparty by M. Menier, the celebrated manufacturer of chocolate, at\r\nNoisiel. It happened that M. Grévy and M. Bethmont lost themselves in\r\nthe forest. Trying to find their way out, they stumbled upon a little\r\nwine house, and stopped for a rest. They asked for something to drink.\r\nM. Bethmont found his wine excellent; but, as usual, Grévy would not\r\ndrink. He wanted coffee, but he was afraid of the decoction which would\r\nbe brought him. He got a good cup, however, and this is how he managed\r\nit:\r\n\r\n\"Have you any chicory?\" he said to the man.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bring me some.\"\r\n\r\nSoon the proprietor returned with a small can of chicory.\r\n\r\n\"Is that all you have?\" asked Grévy.\r\n\r\n\"We have a little more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bring me the rest.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he came again, with another can of chicory, Grévy said:\r\n\r\n\"You have no more?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. Now go and make me a cup of coffee.\"\r\n\r\nAs already told, Louis XV had a great passion for coffee, which he made\r\nhimself. Lenormand, the head gardener at Versailles, raised six pounds\r\nof coffee a year which was for the exclusive use of the king. The king's\r\nfondness for coffee and for Mme. Du Barry gave rise to a celebrated\r\nanecdote of Louveciennes which was accepted as true by many serious\r\nwriters. It is told in this fashion by Mairobert in a pamphlet\r\nscandalizing Du Barry in 1776:\r\n\r\n     His Majesty loves to make his own coffee and to forsake the cares\r\n     of the government. One day the coffee pot was on the fire and, his\r\n     Majesty being occupied with something else, the coffee boiled over.\r\n     \"Oh France, take care! Your coffee _f---- le camp_!\" cried the\r\n     beautiful favorite.\r\n\r\nCharles Vatel has denied this story.\r\n\r\nIt is related of Jean Jacques Rousseau that once when he was walking in\r\nthe Tuileries he caught the aroma of roasting coffee. Turning to his\r\ncompanion, Bernardino de Saint-Pierre, he said, \"Ah, that is a perfume\r\nin which I delight; when they roast coffee near my house, I hasten to\r\nopen the door to take in all the aroma.\" And such was the passion for\r\ncoffee of this philosopher of Geneva that when he died, \"he just missed\r\ndoing it with a cup of coffee in his hand\".\r\n\r\nBarthez, confidential physician of Napoleon the first, drank a great\r\ndeal of it, freely, calling it \"the intellectual drink.\"\r\n\r\nBonaparte, himself, said: \"Strong coffee, and plenty, awakens me. It\r\ngives me a warmth, an unusual force, a pain that is not without\r\npleasure. I would rather suffer than be senseless.\"\r\n\r\nEdward R. Emerson[356] tells the following story of the Café Procope.\r\nOne day while M. Saint-Foix was seated at his usual table in this café\r\nan officer of the king's body-guard entered, sat down, and ordered a cup\r\nof coffee, with milk and a roll, adding, \"It will serve me for a\r\ndinner.\" At this, Saint-Foix remarked aloud that a cup of coffee, with\r\nmilk and a roll, was a confoundedly poor dinner. The officer\r\nremonstrated. Saint-Foix reiterated his remark, adding that nothing he\r\ncould say to the contrary would convince him that it was _not_ a\r\nconfoundedly poor dinner. Thereupon a challenge was given and accepted,\r\nand the whole company present adjourned as spectators to a duel which\r\nended by Saint-Foix receiving a wound in the arm.\r\n\r\n\"That is all very well,\" said the wounded combatant; \"but I call you to\r\nwitness, gentlemen, that I am still profoundly convinced that a cup of\r\ncoffee, with milk and a roll, is a confoundedly poor dinner.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the principals were arrested and carried before the Duke\r\nde Noailles, in whose presence Saint-Foix, without waiting to be\r\nquestioned, said:\r\n\r\n\"Monseigneur, I had not the slightest intention of offending this\r\ngallant officer who, I doubt not, is an honorable man; but your\r\nexcellency can never prevent my asserting that a cup of coffee, with\r\nmilk and a roll, is a confoundedly poor dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, so it is,\" said the Duke.\r\n\r\n\"Then I am not in the wrong,\" persisted Saint-Foix; \"and a cup of\r\ncoffee\"--at these words magistrates, delinquents, and auditory burst\r\ninto a roar of laughter, and the antagonists forthwith became warm\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\"Boswell in his _Life of Johnson_ tells a story of an old chevalier de\r\nMalte, of _ancienne noblesse_, but in low circumstances, who was in a\r\ncoffee house in Paris, where was also Julien, the great manufacturer at\r\nGobelins, of fine tapestry, so much distinguished for the figures and\r\nthe colours. The chevalier's carriage was very old. Says Julien with a\r\nplebeian insolence, 'I think, sir, you had better have your carriage new\r\npainted.'\r\n\r\n\"The chevalier looked at him with indignant contempt, and answered:\r\n\r\n\"'Well, sir, you may take it home and dye it.'\r\n\r\n\"All the coffee house rejoiced at Julien's confusion.\"\r\n\r\nSydney Smith (1771-1845) the English clergyman and humorist, once said:\r\n\"If you want to improve your understanding, drink coffee; it is the\r\nintellectual beverage.\"\r\n\r\nOur own William Dean Howells pays the beverage this tribute: \"This\r\ncoffee intoxicates without exciting, soothes you softly out of dull\r\nsobriety, making you think and talk of all the pleasant things that ever\r\nhappened to you.\"\r\n\r\nThe wife of the president of the United States prefers coffee to tea.\r\nAfternoon guests at the White House may be refreshed, if they choose, by\r\na sip of tea. But while tea is on tap for callers, Mrs. Harding always\r\nhas coffee for those who, like herself, prefer it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Old London Coffee-House Anecdotes_\r\n\r\nA good-sized volume might be compiled of the many anecdotes that have\r\nbeen written about habitués of the London coffee houses of the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. JOHNSON'S SEAT AT THE CHESHIRE CHEESE]\r\n\r\nDr. Samuel Johnson (1709-1784), the lexicographer, was one of the most\r\nconstant frequenters of the coffee houses of his day. His big, awkward\r\nfigure was a familiar sight as he went about attended by his satellite,\r\nyoung James Boswell, who was to write about him for the delight of\r\nfuture generations in his marvelous _Life of Johnson_. The intellectual\r\nand moral peculiarities of the man found a natural expression in the\r\ncoffee house. Johnson was fifty-four and Boswell only twenty-three when\r\nthe two first met in Tom Davies' book-shop in Covent Garden. The story\r\nis told by Boswell with great particularity and characteristic naiveté:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Davies mentioned my name, and respectfully introduced me to\r\n     him. I was much agitated, and recollecting his prejudice against\r\n     the Scotch, of which I had heard so much, I said to Davies, \"Don't\r\n     tell him where I come from.\" \"From Scotland,\" cried Davies\r\n     roguishly. \"Mr. Johnson,\" said I, \"I do indeed come from Scotland,\r\n     but I cannot help it.\" I am willing to flatter myself that I meant\r\n     this as a light pleasantry to sooth and conciliate him, and not as\r\n     a humiliating abasement at the expense of my country. But however\r\n     that might be, this speech was somewhat unlucky, for with that\r\n     quickness of wit for which he was so remarkable, he seized the\r\n     expression, \"come from Scotland!\" which I used In the sense of\r\n     being of that country; and, as if I had come away from it, or left\r\n     it, he retorted, \"That, sir, I find is what a great many of your\r\n     countrymen cannot help.\"\r\n\r\nNothing daunted, however, Boswell within a week called upon Johnson in\r\nhis chambers. This time the doctor urged him to tarry. Three weeks later\r\nhe said to him, \"Come to me as often as you can.\" Within a fortnight\r\nthereafter Boswell was giving the great man a sketch of his own life and\r\nJohnson was exclaiming, \"Give me your hand; I have taken a liking to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORIGINAL COFFEE ROOM, OLD COCK TAVERN]\r\n\r\nWhen people began to ask, \"Who is this Scotch cur at Johnson's heels?\"\r\nGoldsmith replied: \"He is not a cur; he is only a bur. Tom Davies flung\r\nhim at Johnson in sport, and he has the faculty of sticking.\"\r\n\r\nThus began one of the strangest friendships, out of which developed the\r\nmost delightful biography in all literature. Boswell's taste for\r\nliterary adventures, and Johnson's literary vagrancy met in a\r\ncompanionship that found much satisfaction in the bohemianism of the\r\ninns and coffee houses of old London. Boswell thus describes the\r\neccentric doctor's outlook on this mode of living:\r\n\r\n     We dined today at an excellent inn at Chapel-House, where Mr.\r\n     Johnson commented on English coffee houses and inns remarking that\r\n     the English triumphed over the French in one respect, in that the\r\n     French had no perfection of tavern life. There is no private house,\r\n     (said he) in which people can enjoy themselves so well, as at a\r\n     capital tavern. Let there be ever so great plenty of good things,\r\n     ever so much grandeur, ever so much elegance, ever so much desire\r\n     that everybody should be easy; in the nature of things it cannot\r\n     be: there must always be some degree of care and anxiety. The\r\n     master of the house is anxious to entertain his guests; the guests\r\n     are anxious to be agreeable to him; and no man, but a very impudent\r\n     dog indeed, can as freely command what is in another man's house,\r\n     as if it were his own. Whereas, at a tavern, there is a general\r\n     freedom from anxiety. You are sure you are welcome: and the more\r\n     noise you make, the more trouble you give, the more good things you\r\n     call for, the welcomer you are. No servants will attend you with\r\n     the alacrity which waiters do, who are incited by the prospect of\r\n     an immediate reward in proportion as they please. No, Sir, there is\r\n     nothing which has yet been contrived by man, by which so much\r\n     happiness is produced as by a good tavern or inn. He then repeated,\r\n     with great emotion, Shenstone's lines:\r\n\r\n\"Whoe'er has travell'd life's dull round,\r\n  Where'er his stages may have been,\r\nMay sigh to think he still has found\r\n  His warmest welcome at an inn.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPatient delving into Johnsoniana is rewarded with many anecdotes about\r\nthe mad doctor philosopher and his faithful reporter who delighted in\r\ntranslating his genius to the world.\r\n\r\nBoswell was a wine-bibber, but Johnson confessed to being \"a hardened\r\nand shameless tea drinker.\" When Boswell twigged him for abstaining from\r\nthe stronger drink, the doctor replied: \"Sir, I have no objection to a\r\nman's drinking wine if he can do it in moderation. I find myself apt to\r\ngo to excess in it and therefore, after having been for some time\r\nwithout it, on account of illness, I thought it better not to return to\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nAnother time he said of tea: \"What a delightful beverage must that be\r\nthat pleases all palates at a time when they can take nothing else at\r\nbreakfast.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIREPLACE IN THE COFFEE ROOM OF THE OLD COCK TAVERN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MORNING GOSSIP IN THE COFFEE ROOM OF THE OLD COCK\r\nTAVERN]\r\n\r\nIn his early days Johnson had David Garrick as an unwilling pupil. After\r\nthe actor had become famous and his prosperity had turned his head, he\r\nwas wont to \"put the table in a roar\" by mimicking the doctor's\r\ngrimaces. There is a story that on the occasion of a certain dinner\r\nparty where both were guests, Garrick indulged in a coarse jest on the\r\ngreat man's table manners. After the merriment had subsided, Doctor\r\nJohnson arose solemnly and said:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, you must doubtless suppose from the extreme familiarity with\r\nwhich Mr. Garrick has thought fit to treat me that I am an acquaintance\r\nof his; but I can assure you that until I met him here, I never saw him\r\nbut once before--and then I paid five shillings for the sight.\"\r\n\r\nA certain sycophant, thinking to curry favor with Johnson, took to\r\nlaughing loud and long at everything he said. Johnson's patience at last\r\nbecame exhausted, and after a particularly objectionable outburst, he\r\nturned upon the boor with:\r\n\r\n\"Pray sir, what is the matter? I hope I have not said anything which you\r\ncan comprehend!\"\r\n\r\nBecause of his physical and mental disabilities Dr. Johnson was not a\r\ngood social animal. Nevertheless, when it pleased his humor, he could be\r\nthe cavalier, for his mind overcame every impediment.\r\n\r\nIt is related of him that once when a lady who was showing him around\r\nher garden expressed her regret at being unable to bring a particular\r\nflower to perfection, he arose gallantly to the occasion by taking her\r\nhand and remarking:\r\n\r\n\"Then, madam, permit me to bring perfection to the flower!\"\r\n\r\nAgain, when Mrs. Siddons, the great English tragedienne, called upon him\r\nin his chambers and the servant did not promptly bring her a chair, his\r\nquick wit made capital of the incident by the remark:\r\n\r\n\"You see, madam, wherever you go there are no seats to be had!\"\r\n\r\nJohn Thomas Smith in his _Antiquarian Rambles in the Streets of London_\r\n(1846), tells an amusing incident in the life of Sir George Etherege,\r\nthe playright, who having run up a bill at Locket's ordinary, a coffee\r\nhouse much frequented by dramatists of the period, and finding himself\r\nunable to pay, began to absent himself from the place. Mrs. Locket\r\nthereupon sent a man to dun and to threaten him with prosecution if he\r\ndid not pay. Sir George sent back word that if she stirred a step in the\r\nmatter he would kiss her. On receiving this answer, the good lady, much\r\nexasperated, called for her hood and scarf, and told her husband, who\r\ninterposed, that \"she would see if there was any fellow alive who would\r\nhave the impudence--\" \"Prithee! my dear, don't be so rash,\" said her\r\nhusband; \"there is no telling what a man may do in his passion.\"\r\n\r\nRichard Savage, the English poet and friend of Johnson, who included him\r\nin his famous _Lives of the Poets_, was arrested for the murder of James\r\nSinclair after a drunken brawl in Robinson's coffee house in 1727. He\r\nwas found guilty, but narrowly escaped the death penalty by the\r\nintercession of the countess of Hertford. A feature of his trial was the\r\nextraordinary charge to the jury of Judge Page, who for his hard words\r\nand his love of hanging, is damned to everlasting fame in the verse of\r\nPope. The charge was:\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen of the jury! You are to consider that Mr. Savage is a\r\n     very great man, a much greater man than you or I, gentlemen of the\r\n     jury; that he wears very fine clothes, much finer than you or I,\r\n     gentlemen of the jury; that he has an abundance of money in his\r\n     pocket, much more money than you or I, gentlemen of the jury; but,\r\n     gentlemen of the jury, is it not a very hard case, gentlemen of the\r\n     jury, that Mr. Savage should therefore kill you or me, gentlemen of\r\n     the jury?\r\n\r\nAlbert V. Lally[357] has made a collection of old coffee-house\r\nanecdotes. Among them are the following:\r\n\r\n     The story is told of how Sir Richard Steele in Button's Coffee\r\n     House was once made the umpire in an amusing difference between two\r\n     unnamed disputants. These two were arguing about religion, when one\r\n     of them said: \"I wonder, sir, you should talk of religion, when\r\n     I'll hold you five guineas you can't say the Lord's prayer.\"\r\n     \"Done,\" said the other, \"and Sir Richard Steele shall hold the\r\n     stakes.\" The money being deposited the gentleman began with, \"I\r\n     believe in God\", and so went right through the creed. \"Well,\" said\r\n     the other when he had finished, \"I didn't think he could have done\r\n     it.\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     There is another story of a famous judge, Sir Nicholas Bacon, who\r\n     was importuned by a criminal to spare his life on account of\r\n     kinship. \"How so,\" demanded the judge. \"Because my name is Hog and\r\n     yours is Bacon; and hog and bacon are so near akin that they cannot\r\n     be separated.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Ay,\" responded the judge dryly, \"but you and I cannot yet be\r\n     kindred, for hog is not bacon until it is well hanged.\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     On another occasion a nervous barrister, pleading before this same\r\n     judge, began with repeated references to his \"unfortunate client.\"\r\n     \"Go on, sir,\" said the judge, \"so far the Court is with you.\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Of Jonathan Swift it is related that a gentleman who had sought to\r\n     persuade him to accept an invitation to dinner said, in way of\r\n     special inducement, \"I'll send you my bill of fare.\" \"Send me\r\n     rather your bill of company,\" retorted Swift, showing his\r\n     appreciation of the truth that not that which is eaten, but those\r\n     who eat, form the more important part of a good dinner.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion when the \"dreadful Judge Jeffreys\" was trying Compton,\r\nbishop of London, before the Court of High Commission, that prelate, as\r\nCampbell relates in his _Lives of the Lord Chancellors_, complained of\r\nhaving no copy of the indictment. Jeffreys replied to this excuse that\r\n\"all the coffee houses had it for a penny.\" The case being resumed after\r\nthe lapse of a week, the bishop again protested that he was unprepared,\r\nowing to his continued difficulty in obtaining a copy of the necessary\r\ndocument. Jeffreys was obliged once more to adjourn the case, and in so\r\ndoing offered this bantering apology:\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" said he, \"in telling you our commission was to be seen in\r\nevery coffee house, I did not speak with any design to reflect on your\r\nlordship, as if you were a haunter of coffee houses. I abhor the\r\nthoughts of it!\"\r\n\r\nAs the Judge had once been distinctly opposed to the party and\r\nprinciples which he went to such a length in supporting, so had he\r\nformerly owed something to the very institution against which his last\r\nblow was directed. Roger North relates (and Campbell repeats the story)\r\nthat, \"after he was called to the bar, he used to sit in coffee houses\r\nand order his man to come and tell him that company attended him at his\r\nchamber; at which he would huff and say, 'let them stay a little, I will\r\ncome presently,' and thus made a show of business.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Timbs, in his _Clubs and Club Life in London_, has a host of\r\nanecdotes and stories of the old London coffee houses, among them the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n     Garraway's noted coffee-house, situated in Change-alley, Cornhill,\r\n     had a threefold celebrity; tea was first sold in England here; it\r\n     was a place of great resort in the time of the South Sea Bubble;\r\n     and was later a place of great mercantile transactions. The\r\n     original proprietor was Thomas Garway, tobacconist and coffee-man,\r\n     the first who retailed tea, recommending it as a cure of all\r\n     disorders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"HIS WARMEST WELCOME AT AN INN\"\r\n\r\n     The George Inn of today has retained a portion of its old\r\n     galleries, the original of which completely surrounded the\r\n     courtyard in typical \"Dickens Inn\" style. The visitor can imagine\r\n     Mr. Pickwick emerging from the door of one of the bedrooms and\r\n     calling into the yard to Sam Weller. In the old-fashioned coffee\r\n     room on the ground floor one may still lunch and dine enclosed in\r\n     high bench seats]\r\n\r\n     Ogilby, the compiler of the _Britannia_, had his standing lottery\r\n     of books at Mr. Garway's Coffee-house from April 7, 1673, till\r\n     wholly drawn off. And, in the \"Journey through England,\" 1722,\r\n     Garraway's, Robins's, and Joe's are described as the three\r\n     celebrated coffee-houses: \"In the first, the People of Quality, who\r\n     have business in the City, and the most considerable and wealthy\r\n     citizens frequent. In the second the Foreign Banquiers, and often\r\n     even Foreign Ministers. And in the third, the buyers and sellers of\r\n     stock.\"\r\n\r\n     Wines were sold at Garraway's in 1673, \"by the candle\", that is, by\r\n     auction, while an inch of candle burns. In the _Tatler_, No. 147,\r\n     we read: \"Upon my coming home last night, I found a very handsome\r\n     present of French wine, left for me, as a taste of 216 hogshead,\r\n     which are to be put on sale at 20£ a hogshead, at Garraway's\r\n     Coffee-house, in Exchange alley\" etc. The sale by candle is not,\r\n     however, by candlelight, but during the day. At the commencement of\r\n     the sale, when the auctioneer has read a description of the\r\n     property, and the conditions on which it is to be disposed of, a\r\n     piece of candle, usually an inch long, is lighted, and he who is\r\n     the last bidder at the time the light goes out is declared the\r\n     purchaser.\r\n\r\n     Swift, in his _Ballad on the South Sea Scheme_, 1721, did not\r\n     forget Garraway's:\r\n\r\nThere is a gulf, where thousands fell,\r\n  Here all the bold adventurers came,\r\nA narrow sound, though deep as hell,\r\n  'Change alley is the dreadful name.\r\n\r\nSubscribers here by thousands float,\r\n  And jostle one another down,\r\nEach paddling in his leaky boat,\r\n  And here they fish for gold and drown.\r\n\r\nNow buried in the depths below,\r\n  Now mounted up to heaven again,\r\nThey reel and stagger to and fro,\r\n  At their wits' end, like drunken men.\r\n\r\nMeantime secure on Garway cliffs,\r\n  A savage race, by shipwrecks fed,\r\nLie waiting for the founder'd skiffs,\r\n  And strip the bodies of the dead.\r\n\r\n     Dr. Jno. Radcliff, who was a rash speculator in the South Sea\r\n     Scheme, was usually planted at a table at Garraway's about Exchange\r\n     time, to watch the turn of the market; and here he was seated when\r\n     the footman of his powerful rival, Dr. Edward Hannes, came into\r\n     Garraway's and inquired by way of a puff, if Dr. H. was there. Dr.\r\n     Radcliff, who was surrounded with several apothecaries and\r\n     chirurgeons that flocked about him, cried out, \"Dr. Hannes is not\r\n     here,\" and desired to know \"who wants him?\" The fellow's reply was,\r\n     \"such a lord and such a lord;\" but he was taken up with the dry\r\n     rebuke, \"No, no, friend, you are mistaken; the Doctor wants those\r\n     lords.\" One of Radcliff's ventures was five thousand guineas upon\r\n     one South Sea project. When he was told at Garraway's that 'twas\r\n     all lost, \"Why,\" said he, \"'tis but going up five thousand pair of\r\n     stairs more.\" \"This answer,\" says Tom Brown, \"deserved a statue.\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Jonathan's Coffee-house was another Change-alley coffee-house,\r\n     which is described in the _Tatler_, No. 38, as \"the general mart of\r\n     stock-jobbers,\" and the _Spectator_, No. 1, tells us that he\r\n     \"sometimes passes for a Jew in the assembly of stock-jobbers at\r\n     Jonathan's.\" This was their rendezvous, where gambling of all sorts\r\n     was carried on, notwithstanding a former prohibition against the\r\n     assemblage of the jobbers, issued by the City of London, which\r\n     prohibition continued unrepealed until 1825.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The _Spectator_, No. 16, notices some gay frequenters of the\r\n     Rainbow Coffee-house in Fleet Street: \"I have received a letter\r\n     desiring me to be very satirical upon the little muff that is now\r\n     in fashion; another informs me of a pair of silver garters buckled\r\n     below the knee, that have been lately seen at the Rainbow\r\n     Coffee-house in Fleet Street.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. Moncrieff, the dramatist, used to tell that about 1780, this\r\n     house was kept by his grandfather, Alexander Moncrieff, when it\r\n     retained its original title of \"The Rainbow Coffee-house.\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Nando's Coffee-house at the east corner of Inner Temple-lane, No.\r\n     17, Fleet-Street, by some confused with Groom's house, No. 16, was\r\n     the favourite haunt of Lord Thurlow before he dashed into law\r\n     practice. At this coffee-house a large attendance of professional\r\n     loungers was attracted by the fame of the punch and the charms of\r\n     the landlady, which, with the small wits, were duly admired by and\r\n     at the bar. One evening, the famous cause of Douglas _v._ the Duke\r\n     of Hamilton was the topic of discussion, when Thurlow being\r\n     present, it was suggested, half in earnest, to appoint him junior\r\n     counsel, which was done. This employment brought him acquaintance\r\n     with the Duchess of Queensberry, who saw at once the value of a man\r\n     like Thurlow, and recommended Lord Bute to secure him by a silk\r\n     gown.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Dick's Coffee-house, at No. 8, Fleet-street, (south side, near\r\n     Temple Bar) was originally \"Richard's\", named from Richard Torner,\r\n     or Turner, to whom the house was let in 1680. Richard's was\r\n     frequented by Cowper, when he lived in the Temple. In his own\r\n     account of his insanity, Cowper tells us:\r\n\r\n     \"At breakfast I read the newspaper, and in it a letter, which, the\r\n     further I perused it, the more closely engaged my attention. I\r\n     cannot now recollect the purport of it; but before I had finished\r\n     it, it appeared demonstratively true to me that it was a libel or\r\n     satire upon me. The author appeared to be acquainted with my\r\n     purpose of self-destruction, and to have written that letter on\r\n     purpose to secure and hasten the execution of it. My mind,\r\n     probably, at this time began to be disordered; however it was, I\r\n     was certainly given to a strong delusion. I said within myself,\r\n     'Your cruelty shall be gratified; you shall have your revenge,' and\r\n     flinging down the paper in a fit of strong passion, I rushed\r\n     hastily out of the room; directing my way towards the fields, where\r\n     I intended to find some house to die in; or, if not, determined to\r\n     poison myself in a ditch, where I could meet with one sufficiently\r\n     retired.\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Lloyd's Coffee-house was one of the earliest establishments of its\r\n     kind; it is referred to in a poem printed in the year 1700, called\r\n     the _Wealthy Shopkeeper, or Charitable Christian_:\r\n\r\nNow to Lloyd's Coffee-house he never fails,\r\nTo read the letters, and attend the sales.\r\n\r\n     In 1710, Steele (_Tatler_, No. 246) dates from Lloyd's his Petition\r\n     on Coffee-house Orators and Newsvendors. And Addison, in\r\n     _Spectator_, April 23, 1711, relates this droll incident: \"About a\r\n     week since there happened to me a very odd accident, by reason of\r\n     one of these my papers of minutes which I had accidentally dropped\r\n     at Lloyd's Coffee-house, where the auctions are usually kept.\r\n     Before I missed it, there were a cluster of people who had found\r\n     it, and were diverting themselves with it at one end of the\r\n     coffee-house. It had raised so much laughter among them before I\r\n     observed what they were about, that I had not the courage to own\r\n     it. The boy of the coffee-house, when they had done with it,\r\n     carried it about in his hand, asking everybody if they had dropped\r\n     a written paper; but nobody challenging it, he was ordered by those\r\n     merry gentlemen who had before perused it, to get up into the\r\n     auction pulpit, and read it to the whole room, that if anybody\r\n     would own it they might. The boy accordingly mounted the pulpit,\r\n     and with a very audible voice read what proved to be minutes, which\r\n     made the whole coffee-house very merry; some of them concluded it\r\n     was written by a madman, and others by somebody that had been\r\n     taking notes out of the _Spectator_. After it was read, and the boy\r\n     was coming put of the pulpit, the _Spectator_ reached his arm out,\r\n     and desired the boy to given it him; which was done according. This\r\n     drew the whole eyes of the company upon the _Spectator_; but after\r\n     casting a cursory glance over it, he shook his head twice or thrice\r\n     at the reading of it, twisted it into a kind of match, and lighted\r\n     his pipe with it. 'My profound silence,' says the _Spectator_,\r\n     'together with the steadiness of my countenance, and the gravity of\r\n     my behaviour during the whole transaction, raised a very loud\r\n     laugh on all sides of me; but as I had escaped all suspicion of\r\n     being the author, I was very well satisfied, and applying myself to\r\n     my pipe and the _Postman_, took no further notice of anything that\r\n     passed about me.'\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The Smyrna Coffee-house in Pall Mall, was, in the reign of Queen\r\n     Anne, famous for \"that cluster of wise-heads\" found sitting every\r\n     evening from the left side of the fire to the door. The following\r\n     announcement in the _Tatler_, No. 78, is amusing: \"This is to give\r\n     notice to all ingenious gentlemen in and about the cities of London\r\n     and Westminster, who have a mind to be instructed in the noble\r\n     sciences of music, poetry and politics, that they repair to the\r\n     Smyrna Coffee-house, in Pall Mall, betwixt the hours of eight and\r\n     ten at night, where they may be instructed gratis, with elaborate\r\n     essays 'by word of mouth', on all or any of the above-mentioned\r\n     arts.\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     St. James's Coffee-house was the famous Whig coffee-house from the\r\n     time of Queen Anne till late in the reign of George III. It was the\r\n     last house but one on the southwest corner of St. James's street,\r\n     and is thus mentioned in No. 1 of the _Tatler_: \"Foreign and\r\n     Domestic News you will have from St. James's Coffee-house.\" It\r\n     occurs also in the passage quoted previously from the _Spectator_.\r\n     The St. James's was much frequented by Swift; letters for him were\r\n     left here. In his Journal to Stella he says: \"I met Mr. Harley, and\r\n     he asked me how long I had learnt the trick of writing to myself?\r\n     He had seen your letter through the glass case at the Coffee-house,\r\n     and would swear it was my hand.\"\r\n\r\n     Elliott, who kept the coffee-house, was, on occasions, placed on a\r\n     friendly footing with his guests. Swift, in his Journal to Stella,\r\n     November 19, 1710, records an odd instance of this familiarity:\r\n     \"This evening I christened our coffee-man Elliott's child; when the\r\n     rogue had a most noble supper, and Steele and I sat amongst some\r\n     scurvy company over a bowl of punch.\"\r\n\r\n     In the first advertisement of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's \"Town\r\n     Eclogues,\" they are stated to have been read over at the St.\r\n     James's Coffee-house, when they were considered by the general\r\n     voice to be productions of a Lady of Quality. From the proximity of\r\n     the house to St. James's Palace, it was much frequented by the\r\n     Guards; and we read of its being no uncommon circumstance to see\r\n     Dr. Joseph Warton at breakfast in the St. James's Coffee-house,\r\n     surrounded by officers of the Guards, who listened with the utmost\r\n     attention and pleasure to his remarks.\r\n\r\n     To show the order and regularity observed at the St. James's, we\r\n     may quote the following advertisement, appended to the _Tatler_.\r\n     No. 25; \"To prevent all mistakes that may happen among gentlemen of\r\n     the other end of the town, who come but once a week to St. James's\r\n     Coffee-house, either by miscalling the servants, or requiring such\r\n     things from them as are not properly within their respective\r\n     provinces, this is to give notice that Kidney, keeper of the\r\n     book-debts of the outlying customers, and observer of those who go\r\n     off without paying, having resigned that employment, is succeeded\r\n     by John Sowton; to whose place of enterer of messages and first\r\n     coffee-grinder, William Bird is promoted; and Samuel Burdock comes\r\n     as shoe-cleaner in the room of the said Bird.\"\r\n\r\n     But the St. James's is more memorable as the house where originated\r\n     Goldsmith's celebrated poem, \"Retaliation.\" The poet belonged to a\r\n     temporary association of men of talent, some of them members of the\r\n     Club, who dined together occasionally here. At these dinners he was\r\n     generally the last to arrive. On one occasion, when he was later\r\n     than usual, a whim seized the company to write epitaphs on him as\r\n     \"the late Dr. Goldsmith\", and several were thrown off in a playful\r\n     vein. The only one extant was written by Garrick, and has been\r\n     preserved, very probably, by its pungency:\r\n\r\nHere lies poet Goldsmith, for shortness called Noll;\r\nHe wrote like an angel, but talked like poor Poll.\r\n\r\n     Goldsmith did not relish the sarcasm, especially coming from such a\r\n     quarter; and, by way of _retaliation_, he produced the famous poem,\r\n     of which Cumberland has left a very interesting account, but which\r\n     Mr. Forster, in his \"Life of Goldsmith\", states to be \"pure\r\n     romance\". The poem itself, however, with what was prefixed to it\r\n     when published, sufficiently explains its own origin. What had\r\n     formerly been abrupt and strange in Goldsmith's manners, had now so\r\n     visibly increased, as to become matter of increased sport to such\r\n     as were ignorant of its cause; and a proposition made at one of the\r\n     dinners, when he was absent, to write a series of epitaphs upon him\r\n     (his \"country dialect\" and his awkward person) was agreed to, and\r\n     put in practice by several of the guests. The active aggressors\r\n     appear to have been Garrick, Doctor Bernard, Richard Burke, and\r\n     Caleb Whitefoord. Cumberland says he, too, wrote an epitaph; but it\r\n     was complimentary and grave, and hence the grateful return he\r\n     received. Mr. Forster considers Garrick's epitaph to indicate the\r\n     tone of all. This, with the rest, was read to Goldsmith when he\r\n     next appeared at the St. James's Coffee-house, where Cumberland,\r\n     however, says he never again met his friends. But \"the Doctor was\r\n     called on for Retaliation,\" says the friend who published the poem\r\n     with that name, \"and at their next meeting produced the following,\r\n     which I think adds one leaf to his immortal wreath.\"\r\n     \"'Retaliation'\", says Sir Walter Scott, \"had the effect of placing\r\n     the author on a more equal footing with his Society than he had\r\n     ever before assumed.\"\r\n\r\n     Cumberland's account differs from the version formerly received,\r\n     which intimates that the epitaphs were written before Goldsmith\r\n     arrived: whereas the pun, \"the late Dr. Goldsmith\" appears to have\r\n     suggested the writing of the epitaphs. In the \"Retaliation\",\r\n     Goldsmith has not spared the characters and failings of his\r\n     associates, but has drawn them with satire, at once pungent and\r\n     good-humoured. Garrick is smartly chastised; Burke, the Dinner-bell\r\n     of the House of Commons, is not let off; and of all the more\r\n     distinguished names of the Club, Thomson, Cumberland, and Reynolds\r\n     alone escape the lash of the satirist. The former is not mentioned,\r\n     and the two latter are even dismissed with unqualified and\r\n     affectionate applause.\r\n\r\n     Still we quote Cumberland's account of the \"Retaliation\" which is\r\n     very amusing from the closely circumstantial manner in which the\r\n     incidents are narrated, although they have so little relationship\r\n     to truth: \"It was upon a proposal started by Edmund Burke, that a\r\n     party of friends who had dined together at Sir Joshua Reynolds's\r\n     and my house, should meet at the St. James's Coffee-house, which\r\n     accordingly took place, and was repeated occasionally with much\r\n     festivity and good fellowship. Dr. Bernard, Dean of Derry; a very\r\n     amiable and old friend of mine, Dr. Douglas, since Bishop of\r\n     Salisbury; Johnson, David Garrick, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Oliver\r\n     Goldsmith, Edmund and Richard Burke, Hickey, with two or three\r\n     others, constituted our party. At one of these meetings, an idea\r\n     was suggested of extemporary epitaphs upon the parties present; pen\r\n     and ink were called for, and Garrick, offhand, wrote an epitaph\r\n     with a good deal of humour, upon poor Goldsmith, who was the first\r\n     in jest, as he proved to be in reality, that we committed to the\r\n     grave. The Dean also gave him an epitaph, and Sir Joshua\r\n     illuminated the Dean's verses with a sketch of his bust in pen and\r\n     ink, inimitably caricatured. Neither Johnson nor Burke wrote\r\n     anything, and when I perceived that Oliver was rather sore, and\r\n     seemed to watch me with that kind of attention which indicated his\r\n     expectation of something in the same kind of burlesque with theirs;\r\n     I thought it time to press the joke no further, and wrote a few\r\n     couplets at a side-table, which, when I had finished, and was\r\n     called upon by the company to exhibit, Goldsmith, with much\r\n     agitation, besought me to spare him; and I was about to tear them,\r\n     when Johnson wrested them out of my hand, and in a loud voice read\r\n     them at the table. I have now lost recollection of them, and, in\r\n     fact, they were little worth remembering; but as they were serious\r\n     and complimentary, the effect upon Goldsmith was the more pleasing\r\n     for being so entirely unexpected. The concluding line, which was\r\n     the only one I can call to mind, was:\r\n\r\n  \"All mourn the poet, I lament the man.\r\n\r\n     \"This I recollect, because he repeated it several times, and seemed\r\n     much gratified by it. At our next meeting he produced his epitaphs\r\n     ... and this was the last time he ever enjoyed the company of his\r\n     friends.\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Will's Coffee-house, the predecessor of Button's, and even more\r\n     celebrated than that coffee-house, was kept by William Urwin. It\r\n     first had the title of the Red Cow, then of the Rose, and, we\r\n     believe, is the same house alluded to in the pleasant story in the\r\n     second number of the _Tatler_. \"Supper and friends expect we at the\r\n     Rose.\"\r\n\r\n     Dean Lockier has left this life-like picture of his interview with\r\n     the presiding genius (Dryden) at Will's.\r\n\r\n     \"I was about seventeen when I first came up to town,\" says the\r\n     Dean, \"an odd-looking boy, with short rough hair, and that sort of\r\n     awkwardness which one always brings up at first out of the country\r\n     with one. However, in spite of my bashfulness and appearance, I\r\n     used, now and then, to thrust myself into Will's to have the\r\n     pleasure of seeing the most celebrated wits of that time, who then\r\n     resorted thither. The second time that ever I was there, Mr. Dryden\r\n     was speaking of his own things, as he frequently did, especially of\r\n     such as had been lately published. 'If anything of mine is good,'\r\n     says he, ''tis 'Mac-Flecno', and I value myself the more upon it,\r\n     because it is the first piece of ridicule written in heroics.' On\r\n     hearing this I plucked up my spirit so far as to say, in a voice\r\n     but just loud enough to be heard, 'that \"Mac-Flecno\" was a very\r\n     fine poem, but that I had not imagined it to be the first that was\r\n     ever writ that way.' On this, Dryden turned short upon me, as\r\n     surprised at my interposing; asked me how long 'I had been a dealer\r\n     in poetry'; and added, with a smile, 'Pray, Sir, what is it that\r\n     you did imagine to have been writ so before?'--I named Boileau's\r\n     'Lutrin' and Tassoni's 'Secchia Rapita,' which I had read, and knew\r\n     Dryden had borrowed some strokes from each. ''Tis true,' said\r\n     Dryden, 'I had forgot them.' A little after, Dryden went out, and\r\n     in going, spoke to me again, and desired me to come and see him the\r\n     next day. I was highly delighted with the invitation; went to see\r\n     him accordingly; and was well acquainted with him after, as long as\r\n     he lived.\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Will's Coffee-house was the open market for libels and lampoons,\r\n     the latter named from the established burden formerly sung to them:\r\n\r\n_Lampone, lampone, camerada lampone._\r\n\r\n     There was a drunken fellow, named Julian, who was a characterless\r\n     frequenter of Will's, and Sir Walter Scott has given this account\r\n     of him and his vocation:\r\n\r\n     \"Upon the general practice of writing lampoons, and the necessity\r\n     of finding some mode of dispersing them, which should diffuse the\r\n     scandal widely while the authors remained concealed, was founded\r\n     the self-erected office of Julian, Secretary, as he called himself,\r\n     to the Muses. This person attended Will's, the Wits' Coffee-house,\r\n     as it was called; and dispersed among the crowds who frequented\r\n     that place of gay resort copies of the lampoons which had been\r\n     privately communicated to him by their authors. 'He is described,'\r\n     says Mr. Malone, 'as a very drunken fellow, and at one time was\r\n     confined for a libel.'\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Tom Brown describes 'a Wit and a Beau set up with little or no\r\n     expense. A pair of red stockings and a swordknot set up one, and\r\n     peeping once a day in at Will's, and two or three second-hand\r\n     sayings, the other.'\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Pepys, one night, going to fetch home his wife, stopped in Covent\r\n     Garden, at the Great Coffee-house there, as he called Will's, where\r\n     he never was before: \"Where,\" he adds, \"Dryden, the poet (I knew at\r\n     Cambridge), and all the Wits of the town, and Harris the player,\r\n     and Mr. Hoole of our College. And had I had time then, or could at\r\n     other times, it will be good coming thither, for there, I perceive,\r\n     is very witty and pleasant discourse. But I could not tarry, and,\r\n     as it was late, they were all ready to go away.\"\r\n\r\n     Addison passed each day alike, and much in the manner that Dryden\r\n     did. Dryden employed his mornings in writing, dined _en famille_,\r\n     and then went to Will's, \"only he came home earlier o' nights.\"\r\n\r\n     Pope, when very young, was impressed with such veneration for\r\n     Dryden, that he persuaded some friends to take him to Will's\r\n     Coffee-house, and was delighted that he could say that he had seen\r\n     Dryden. Sir Charles Wogan, too, brought up Pope from the Forest of\r\n     Windsor, to dress _a la mode_, and introduce at Will's\r\n     Coffee-house. Pope afterwards described Dryden as \"a plump man with\r\n     a down look, and not very conversible,\" and Cibber could tell no\r\n     more \"but that he remembered him a decent old man, arbiter of\r\n     critical disputes at Will's.\" Prior sings of--\r\n\r\n            The younger Stiles,\r\nWhom Dryden pedagogues at Will's!\r\n\r\n     Most of the hostile criticism on his Plays, which Dryden has\r\n     noticed in his various Prefaces, appear to have been made at his\r\n     favourite haunt, Will's Coffee-house.\r\n\r\n     Dryden is generally said to have been returning from Will's to his\r\n     house in Gerard Street, when he was cudgelled in Rose Street by\r\n     three persons hired for the purpose by Wilmot, Earl of Rochester,\r\n     in the winter of 1679. The assault, or \"the Rose-alley Ambuscade,\"\r\n     certainly took place; but it is not so certain that Dryden was on\r\n     his way from Will's, and he then lived in Long-acre, not Gerard\r\n     Street.\r\n\r\n     It is worthy of remark that Swift was accustomed to speak\r\n     disparagingly of Will's, as in his \"Rhapsody on Poetry:\"\r\n\r\nBe sure at Will's the following day\r\nLie snug, and hear what critics say;\r\nAnd if you find the general vogue\r\nPronounces you a stupid rogue,\r\nDamns all your thoughts as low and little;\r\nSit still, and swallow down your spittle.\r\n\r\n     Swift thought little of the frequenters of Will's: \"he used to say,\r\n     the worst conversation he ever heard in his life was at Will's\r\n     Coffee-house, where the wits (as they were called) used formerly to\r\n     assemble; that is to say, five or six men who had writ plays or at\r\n     least prologues, or had a share in a miscellany, came thither, and\r\n     entertained one another with their trifling composures, in so\r\n     important an air as if they had been the noblest efforts of human\r\n     nature, or that the fate of kingdoms depended on them.\"\r\n\r\n     In the first number of the _Tatler_, poetry is promised under the\r\n     article of Will's Coffee-house. The place, however, changed after\r\n     Dryden's time: \"you used to see songs, epigrams, and satires in the\r\n     hands of every man you met, you have now only a pack of cards; and\r\n     instead of the cavils about the turn of the expression, the\r\n     elegance of the style, and the like, the learned now dispute only\r\n     about the truth of the game.\" \"In old times, we used to sit upon a\r\n     play here, after it was acted, but now the entertainment's turned\r\n     another way.\"\r\n\r\n     The _Spectator_ is sometimes seen \"thrusting his head into a round\r\n     of politicians at Will's, and listening with great attention to the\r\n     narratives that are made in these little circular audiences.\" Then,\r\n     we have as an instance of no one member of human society but that\r\n     would have some little pretension for some degree in it, \"like him\r\n     who came to Will's Coffee-house upon the merit of having writ a\r\n     posie of a ring.\" And, \"Robin, the porter who waits at Will's, is\r\n     the best man in town for carrying a billet: the fellow has a thin\r\n     body, swift step, demure looks, sufficient sense, and knows the\r\n     town.\"\r\n\r\n     After Dryden's death, in 1701, Will's continued for about ten years\r\n     to be still the Wits' Coffee-house, as we see by Ned Ward's\r\n     account, and by the \"Journey through England\" in 1722.\r\n\r\n     Pope entered with keen relish into society, and courted the\r\n     correspondence of the town wits and coffee-house critics. Among his\r\n     early friends was Mr. Henry Cromwell, one of the _cousinry_ of the\r\n     Protector's family: he was a bachelor, and spent most of his time\r\n     in London; he had some pretensions to scholarship and literature,\r\n     having translated several of Ovid's Elegies, for Tonson's\r\n     Miscellany. With Wycherly, Gay, Dennis, the popular actors and\r\n     actresses of the day, and with all the frequenters of Will's,\r\n     Cromwell was familiar. He had done more than take a pinch out of\r\n     Dryden's snuff-box, which was a point of high ambition and honor at\r\n     Will's; he had quarrelled with him about a frail poetess, Mrs.\r\n     Elizabeth Thomas, whom Dryden had christened Corinna, and who was\r\n     also known as Sappho. Gay characterized this literary and eccentric\r\n     beau as\r\n\r\nHonest, hatless Cromwell, with red breeches:\r\n\r\n     it being his custom to carry his hat in his hand when walking with\r\n     ladies. What with ladies and literature, rehearsals and reviews,\r\n     and critical attention to the quality of his coffee and Brazil\r\n     snuff, Henry Cromwell's time was fully occupied in town. Cromwell\r\n     was a dangerous acquaintance for Pope at the age of sixteen or\r\n     seventeen, but he was a very agreeable one. Most of Pope's letters\r\n     to his friends are addressed to him at the Blue Hall, in Great\r\n     Wild-street, near Drury Lane, and others to \"Widow Hambledon's\r\n     Coffee-house, at the end of Princes-street, near Drury-lane,\r\n     London.\" Cromwell made one visit to Binfield; on his return to\r\n     London, Pope wrote to him, \"referring to the ladies in particular,\"\r\n     and to his favorite coffee.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Will's was the great resort for the wits of Dryden's time, after\r\n     whose death it was transferred to Button's. Pope describes the\r\n     houses as \"opposite each other, in Russell-street, Covent Garden,\"\r\n     where Addison established Daniel Button, in a new house, about\r\n     1712; and his fame, after the production of _Cato_, drew many of\r\n     the Whigs thither. Button had been servant to the Countess of\r\n     Warwick. The house is more correctly described as \"over against\r\n     Tom's, near the middle of the south side of the street.\"\r\n\r\n     Addison was the great patron of Button's; but it is said that when\r\n     he suffered any vexation from his Countess, he withdrew from\r\n     Button's house. His chief companions, before he married Lady\r\n     Warwick, were Steele, Budgell, Philips, Carey, Davenant, and\r\n     Colonell Brett. He used to breakfast with one or other of them in\r\n     St. James's-place, dine at taverns with them, then to Button's, and\r\n     then to some tavern again, for supper in the evening; and this was\r\n     the usual round of his life, as Pope tells us in Spencer's\r\n     Anecdotes, where Pope also says: \"Addison usually studied all the\r\n     morning, then met his party at Button's, dined there, and stayed\r\n     five or six hours; and sometimes far into the night. I was of the\r\n     company for about a year, but found it too much for me; it hurt my\r\n     health, and so I quitted it.\" Again: \"There had been a coldness\r\n     between me and Mr. Addison for some time, and we had not been in\r\n     company together for a good while anywhere but at Button's\r\n     Coffee-house, where I used to see him almost every day.\"\r\n\r\n     Here Pope is reported to have said of Patrick, the lexicographer,\r\n     that \"a dictionary-maker might know the meaning of one word, but\r\n     not of two put together.\"\r\n\r\n     Button's was the receiving house for contributions to _The\r\n     Guardian_, for which purpose was put up a lion's head letter box,\r\n     in imitation of the celebrated lion at Venice, as humorously\r\n     announced. Thus:\r\n\r\n     \"N.B.--Mr. Ironside has, within five weeks last past, muzzled three\r\n     lions, gorged five, and killed one. On Monday next the skin of the\r\n     dead one will be hung up, _in terrorem_, at Button's Coffee-house.\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"I intend to publish once every week the roarings of the Lion, and\r\n     hope to make him roar so loud as to be heard over all the British\r\n     nation. I have, I know not how, been drawn into tattle of myself,\r\n     more majorum, almost the length of a whole _Guardian_. I shall\r\n     therefore fill up the remaining part of it with what still relates\r\n     to my own person, and my correspondents. Now I would have them all\r\n     know that on the 20th instant, it is my intention to erect a Lion's\r\n     Head, in imitation of those I have described in Venice, through\r\n     which all the private commonwealth is said to pass. This head is to\r\n     open a most wide and voracious mouth, which shall take in such\r\n     letters and papers as are conveyed to me by my correspondents, it\r\n     being my resolution to have a particular regard to all such matters\r\n     as come to my hands through the mouth of the Lion. There will be\r\n     under it a box, of which the key will be in my own custody, to\r\n     receive such papers as are dropped into it. Whatever the Lion\r\n     swallows I shall digest for the use of the publick. This head\r\n     requires some time to finish, the workmen being resolved to give it\r\n     several masterly touches, and to represent it as ravenous as\r\n     possible. It will be set up in Button's Coffee-house, in Covent\r\n     Garden, who is directed to show the way to the Lion's Head, and to\r\n     instruct any young author how to convey his works into the mouth of\r\n     it with safety and secrecy.\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"I think myself obliged to acquaint the publick, that the Lion's\r\n     Head, of which I advertised them about a fortnight ago, is now\r\n     erected at Button's Coffee-house, in Russell-street, Covent Garden,\r\n     where it opens its mouth at all hours for the reception of such\r\n     intelligence as shall be thrown into it. It is reckoned an\r\n     excellent piece of workmanship, and was designed by a great hand in\r\n     imitation of the antique Egyptian lion, the face of it being\r\n     compounded out of that of a lion and a wizard. The features are\r\n     strong and well furrowed. The whiskers are admired by all that have\r\n     seen them. It is planted on the western side of the Coffee-house,\r\n     holding its paws under the chin, upon a box, which contains\r\n     everything that he swallows. He is, indeed, a proper emblem of\r\n     knowledge and action, being all head and paws.\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"Being obliged, at present, to attend a particular affair of my\r\n     own, I do empower my printer to look into the arcana of the Lion,\r\n     and select out of them such as may be of publick utility; and Mr.\r\n     Button is hereby authorized and commanded to give my said printer\r\n     free ingress and egress to the lion, without any hindrance, let, or\r\n     molestation whatsoever, until such time as he shall receive orders\r\n     to the contrary. And, for so doing, this shall be his warrant.\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"My Lion, whose jaws are at all times open to intelligence, informs\r\n     me that there are a few enormous weapons still in being; but that\r\n     they are to be met with only in gaming houses and some of the\r\n     obscure retreats of lovers, in and about Drury-lane and Covent\r\n     Garden.\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     This memorable Lion's Head was tolerably well carved: through the\r\n     mouth the letters were dropped into a till at Button's; and beneath\r\n     were inscribed these two lines from Martial:\r\n\r\n_Cervantur magnis isti Cervicibus ungues;\r\nNon nisi delicta pascitur ille fera._\r\n\r\n     The head was designed by Hogarth, and is etched in Ireland's\r\n     \"Illustrations.\" Lord Chesterfield is said to have once offered for\r\n     the Head fifty guineas. From Button's it was removed to the\r\n     Shakspeare's Head Tavern, under the Piazza, kept by a person named\r\n     Tomkyns; and in 1751, was, for a short time, placed in the Bedford\r\n     Coffee-house immediately adjoining the Shakspeare, and there\r\n     employed as a letter-box by Dr. John Hill, for his _Inspector_. In\r\n     1769, Tomkyns was succeeded by his waiter, Campbell, as proprietor\r\n     of the tavern and lion's head, and by him the latter was retained\r\n     until November 8, 1804, when it was purchased by Mr. Charles\r\n     Richardson, of Richardson's Hotel, for 17£ 10s., who also possessed\r\n     the original sign of the Shakspeare's Head. After Mr. Richardson's\r\n     death in 1827, the Lion's Head devolved to his son, of whom it was\r\n     bought by the Duke of Bedford, and deposited at Woburn Abbey, where\r\n     it still remains.\r\n\r\n     Pope was subjected to much annoyance and insult at Button's. Sir\r\n     Samuel Garth wrote to Gay, that everybody was pleased with Pope's\r\n     Translation, \"but a few at Button's;\" to which Gay adds, to Pope,\r\n     \"I am confirmed that at Button's your character is made very free\r\n     with, as to morals, etc.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALEXANDER POPE AT BUTTON'S COFFEE HOUSE--1730\r\n\r\nFrom a drawing by Hogarth. The man opposite the seated figure is thought\r\nto be Pope]\r\n\r\n     Cibber, in a letter to Pope, says: \"When you used to pass your\r\n     hours at Button's, you were even there remarkable for your\r\n     satirical itch of provocation; scarce was there a gentleman of any\r\n     pretension to wit, whom your unguarded temper had not fallen upon\r\n     in some biting epigram, among which you once caught a pastoral\r\n     Tartar, whose resentment, that your punishment might be\r\n     proportionate to the smart of your poetry, had stuck up a birchen\r\n     rod in the room, to be ready whenever you might come within reach\r\n     of it; and at this rate you writ and rallied and writ on, till you\r\n     rhymed yourself quite out of the coffee-house.\" The \"pastoral\r\n     Tartar\" was Ambrose Philips, who, says Johnson, \"hung up a rod at\r\n     Button's, with which he threatened to chastise Pope.\"\r\n\r\n     Pope, in a letter to Crags, thus explains the affair: \"Mr. Philips\r\n     did express himself with much indignation against me one evening at\r\n     Button's Coffee-house (as I was told), saying that I was entered\r\n     into a cabal with Dean Swift and others, to write against the Whig\r\n     interest, and in particular to undermine his own reputation and\r\n     that of his friends, Steele and Addison; but Mr. Philips never\r\n     opened his lips to my face, on this or any like occasion, though I\r\n     was almost every night in the same room with him, nor ever offered\r\n     me any indecorum. Mr. Addison came to me a night or two after\r\n     Philips had talked in this idle manner, and assured me of his\r\n     disbelief of what had been said, of the friendship we should always\r\n     maintain, and desired I would say nothing further of it. My Lord\r\n     Halifax did me the honour to stir in this matter, by speaking to\r\n     several people to obviate a false aspersion, which might have done\r\n     me no small prejudice with one party. However, Philips did all he\r\n     could secretly to continue to report with the Hanover Club, and\r\n     kept in his hands the subscriptions paid for me to him, as\r\n     secretary to that Club. The heads of it have since given him to\r\n     understand, that they take it ill; but (upon the terms I ought to\r\n     be with such a man) I would not ask him for this money, but\r\n     commissioned one of the players, his equals, to receive it. This is\r\n     the whole matter; but as to the secret grounds of this malignity,\r\n     they will make a very pleasant history when we meet.\"\r\n\r\n     Another account says that the rod was hung up at the bar of\r\n     Button's, and that Pope avoided it by remaining at home--\"his\r\n     usual custom.\" Philips was known for his courage and superior\r\n     dexterity with the sword; he afterwards became justice of the\r\n     peace, and used to mention Pope, whenever he could get a man in\r\n     authority to listen to him, as an enemy to the Government.\r\n\r\n     At Button's the leading company, particularly Addison and Steele,\r\n     met in large flowing flaxen wigs. Sir Godfrey Kneller, too, was a\r\n     frequenter.\r\n\r\n     The master died in 1731, when in the _Daily Advertiser_, October 5\r\n     appeared the following:\r\n\r\n     \"On Sunday morning, died, after three days' illness, Mr. Button,\r\n     who formerly kept Button's Coffee-house, in Russell-street, Covent\r\n     Garden: a very noted house for wits, being the place where the Lyon\r\n     produced the famous _Tatlers_ and _Spectators_, written by the late\r\n     Mr. Secretary Addison and Sir Richard Steele, Knt., which works\r\n     will transmit their names with honour to posterity.\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Among other wits who frequented Button's were Swift, Arbuthnot,\r\n     Savage, Budgell, Martin Folkes, and Drs. Garth and Armstrong. In\r\n     1720, Hogarth mentions \"four drawings in Indian ink\" of the\r\n     characters at Button's Coffee-house. In these were sketches of\r\n     Arbuthnot, Addison, Pope (as it is conjectured) and a certain Count\r\n     Viviani, identified years afterwards by Horace Walpole, when the\r\n     drawings came under his notice. They subsequently came into\r\n     Ireland's possession.\r\n\r\n     Jemmy Maclaine, or M'Clean, the fashionable highwayman, was a\r\n     frequent visitor at Button's. Mr. John Taylor, of the _Sun_\r\n     newspaper, describes Maclaine as a tall, showy, good-looking man. A\r\n     Mr. Donaldson told Taylor that, observing Maclaine paid particular\r\n     attention to the barmaid of the Coffee-house, the daughter of the\r\n     landlord, he gave a hint to the father of Maclaine's dubious\r\n     character. The father cautioned the daughter against the\r\n     highwayman's addresses, and imprudently told her by whose advice he\r\n     put her on her guard; she as imprudently told Maclaine. The next\r\n     time Donaldson visited the coffee-room, and sitting in one of the\r\n     boxes, Maclaine entered, and in a loud tone said, \"Mr. Donaldson, I\r\n     wish to _spake_ to you in a private room.\" Mr. D. being unarmed,\r\n     and naturally afraid of being alone with such a man, said, in\r\n     answer, that as nothing could pass between them that he did not\r\n     wish the whole world to know, he begged leave to decline the\r\n     invitation. \"Very well,\" said Maclaine, as he left the room, \"we\r\n     shall meet again.\" A day or two after, as Mr. Donaldson was walking\r\n     near Richmond, in the evening, he saw Maclaine on horseback; but\r\n     fortunately, at that moment, a gentleman's carriage appeared in\r\n     view, when Maclaine immediately turned his horse towards the\r\n     carriage, and Donaldson hurried into the protection of Richmond as\r\n     fast as he could. But for the appearance of the carriage, which\r\n     presented better prey, it is possible that Maclaine would have shot\r\n     Mr. Donaldson immediately.\r\n\r\n     Maclaine's father was an Irish Dean; his brother was a Calvinist\r\n     minister in great esteem at the Hague. Maclaine himself had been a\r\n     grocer in Welbeck-street, but losing a wife that he loved\r\n     extremely, and by whom he had one little girl, he quitted his\r\n     business with two hundred pounds in his pockets which he soon\r\n     spent, and then took to the road with only one companion, Plunket,\r\n     a journeyman apothecary.\r\n\r\n     Maclaine was taken in the autumn of 1750, by selling a laced\r\n     waistcoat to a pawnbroker in Monmouth-street, who happened to carry\r\n     it to the very man who had just sold the lace. Maclaine impeached\r\n     his companion, Plunket, but he was not taken. The former got into\r\n     verse: Gray, in his \"Long Story,\" sings:\r\n\r\nA sudden fit of ague shook him;\r\nHe stood as mute as poor M'Lean.\r\n\r\n     Button's subsequently became a private house, and here Mrs.\r\n     Inchbald lodged, probably, after the death of her sister, for whose\r\n     support she practised such noble and generous self-denial. Mrs.\r\n     Inchbald's income was now 172£ a year, and we are told that she now\r\n     went to reside in a boarding-house, where she enjoyed more of the\r\n     comforts of life. Phillips, the publisher, offered her a thousand\r\n     pounds for her Memoirs, which she declined. She died in a\r\n     boarding-house at Kensington, on the 1st of August, 1821, leaving\r\n     about 6,000£ judiciously divided amongst her relatives. Her simple\r\n     and parsimonious habits were very strange. \"Last Thursday,\" she\r\n     writes, \"I finished scouring my bedroom, while a coach with a\r\n     coronet and two footmen waited at my door to take me an airing.\"\r\n\r\n     \"One of the most agreeable memories connected with Button's,\" says\r\n     Leigh Hunt, \"is that of Garth, a man whom, for the sprightliness\r\n     and generosity of his nature, it is a pleasure to name. He was one\r\n     of the most amiable and intelligent of a most amiable and\r\n     intelligent class of men--the physicians.\"\r\n\r\n     It was just after Queen Anne's accession that Swift made\r\n     acquaintance with the leaders of the wits at Button's. Ambrose\r\n     Philips refers to him as the strange clergyman whom the frequenters\r\n     of the Coffee-house had observed for some days. He knew no one, no\r\n     one knew him. He would lay his hat down on a table, and walk up and\r\n     down at a brisk pace for half an hour without speaking to any one,\r\n     or seeming to pay attention to anything that was going forward.\r\n     Then he would snatch up his hat, pay his money at the bar, and walk\r\n     off, without having opened his lips. The frequenters of the room\r\n     had christened him \"the mad parson.\" One evening, as Mr. Addison\r\n     and the rest were observing him, they saw him cast his eyes several\r\n     times upon a gentleman in boots, who seemed to be just come out of\r\n     the country. At last, Swift advanced towards this bucolic\r\n     gentleman, as if intending to address him. They were all eager to\r\n     hear what the dumb parson had to say, and immediately quitted their\r\n     seats to get near him. Swift went up to the country gentleman, and\r\n     in a very abrupt manner, without any previous salute, asked him,\r\n     \"Pray, Sir, do you know any good weather in the world?\" After\r\n     staring a little at the singularity of Swift's manner and the\r\n     oddity of the question, the gentleman answered, \"Yes, Sir, I thank\r\n     God I remember a great deal of good weather in my time.\"--\"That is\r\n     more,\" replied Swift, \"than I can say; I never remember any weather\r\n     that was not too hot or too cold, too wet or too dry; but, however\r\n     God Almighty contrives it, at the end of the year 'tis all very\r\n     well.\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Sir Walter Scott gives, upon the authority of Dr. Wall, of\r\n     Worcester, who had it from Dr. Arbuthnot himself, the following\r\n     anecdote--less coarse than the version generally told. Swift was\r\n     seated by the fire at Button's; there was sand on the floor of the\r\n     coffee-room, and Arbuthnot, with a design to play upon this\r\n     original figure, offered him a letter, which he had been just\r\n     addressing, saying at the same time, \"There--sand that\"--\"I have\r\n     got no sand,\" answered Swift, \"but I can help you to a little\r\n     _gravel_.\" This he said so significantly, that Arbuthnot hastily\r\n     snatched back his letter, to save it from the fate of the capital\r\n     of Lilliput.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Tom's Coffee-house in Birchin-lane, Cornhill, though in the main a\r\n     mercantile resort, acquired some celebrity from its having been\r\n     frequented by Garrick, who, to keep up an interest in the City,\r\n     appeared here about twice in a winter at 'Change time, when it was\r\n     the rendezvous of young merchants.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Hawkins says: \"After all that has been said of Mr. Garrick, envy\r\n     must own that he owed his celebrity to his merit; and yet, of that\r\n     himself so diffident, that he practiced sundry little but innocent\r\n     arts, to insure the favour of the public:\" yet, he did more. When a\r\n     rising actor complained to Mrs. Garrick that the newspapers abused\r\n     him, the widow replied, \"You should write your own criticisms;\r\n     David always did.\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     One evening, Murphy was at Tom's, when Colley Cibber was playing at\r\n     whist, with an old general for his partner. As the cards were dealt\r\n     to him, he took up every one in turn, and expressed his\r\n     disappointment at each indifferent one. In the progress of the game\r\n     he did not follow suit, and his partner said, \"What! have you not a\r\n     spade, Mr. Cibber?\" The latter, looking at his cards, answered, \"Oh\r\n     yes, a thousand;\" which drew a very peevish comment from the\r\n     general. On which, Cibber, who was shockingly addicted to swearing,\r\n     replied, \"Don't be angry, for--I can play ten times worse if I\r\n     like.\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The celebrated Bedford Coffee-house, in Covent Garden, once\r\n     attracted so much attention as to have published, \"Memoirs of the\r\n     Bedford Coffee-house,\" two editions, 1751 and 1763. It stood \"under\r\n     the Piazza, in Covent Garden,\" in the northwest corner, near the\r\n     entrance to the theatre, and has long ceased to exist.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     In the _Connoisseur_, No. 1, 1754, we are assured that \"this\r\n     Coffee-house is every night crowded with men of parts. Almost every\r\n     one you meet is a polite scholar and a wit. Jokes and bon-mots are\r\n     echoed from box to box: every branch of literature is critically\r\n     examined, and the merit of every production of the press, or\r\n     performance of the theatres, weighed and determined.\"\r\n\r\n     And in the above-named \"Memoirs\" we read that \"this spot has been\r\n     signalized for many years as the emporium of wit, the seat of\r\n     criticism, and the standard of taste.--Names of those who\r\n     frequented the house: Foote, Mr. Fielding, Mr. Woodward, Mr. Leone,\r\n     Mr. Murphy, Mopsy, Dr. Arne. Dr. Arne was the only man in a suit of\r\n     velvet in the dog-days.\"\r\n\r\n     Stacie kept the Bedford when John and Henry Fielding, Hogarth,\r\n     Churchill, Woodward, Lloyd, Dr. Goldsmith and many others met there\r\n     and held a gossiping shilling rubber club. Henry Fielding was a\r\n     very smart fellow.\r\n\r\n     The _Inspector_ appears to have given rise to this reign of the\r\n     Bedford, when there was placed here the Lion from Button's, which\r\n     proved so serviceable to Steele, and once more fixed the dominion\r\n     of wit in Covent Garden.\r\n\r\n     The reign of wit and pleasantry did not, however, cease at the\r\n     Bedford at the demise of the _Inspector_. A race of punsters next\r\n     succeeded. A particular box was allotted to this occasion, out of\r\n     hearing of the lady of the bar, that the _double entendres_, which\r\n     were sometimes very indelicate, might not offend her.\r\n\r\n     The Bedford was beset with scandalous nuisances, of which the\r\n     following letter, from Arthur Murphy to Garrick, April 10, 1768,\r\n     presents a pretty picture:\r\n\r\n     \"Tiger Roach (who used to bully at the Bedford Coffee-house because\r\n     his name was Roach) is set up by Wilke's friends to burlesque\r\n     Luttrel and his pretensions. I own I do not know a more ridiculous\r\n     circumstance than to be a joint candidate with the Tiger. O'Brien\r\n     used to take him off very pleasantly, and perhaps you may, from his\r\n     representation, have some idea of this important wight. He used to\r\n     sit with a half-starved look, a black patch upon his cheek, pale\r\n     with the idea of murder, or with rank cowardice, a quivering lip,\r\n     and a downcast eye. In that manner he used to sit at a table all\r\n     alone, and his soliloquy, interrupted now and then with faint\r\n     attempts to throw off a little saliva, was to the following\r\n     effect:--'Hut! hut! a mercer's 'prentice with a bag-wig;--d---- n\r\n     my s---- l, if I would not skiver a dozen of them like larks! Hut!\r\n     hut! I don't understand such airs!--I'd cudgel him back, breast and\r\n     belly, for three skips of a louse!--How do you do, Pat? Hut! hut!\r\n     God's blood--Larry, I'm glad to see you; 'Prentices! a fine thing\r\n     indeed!--Hut! hut! How do you do, Dominick!--D---- n my s---- l,\r\n     what's here to do!' These were the meditations of this agreeable\r\n     youth. From one of these reveries he started up one night, when I\r\n     was there, called a Mr. Bagnell out of the room, and most\r\n     heroically stabbed him in the dark, the other having no weapon to\r\n     defend himself with. In this career, the Tiger persisted, till at\r\n     length a Mr. Lennard brandished a whip over his head, and stood in\r\n     a menacing attitude, commanding him to ask pardon directly. The\r\n     Tiger shrank from the danger, and with a faint voice\r\n     pronounced--'Hut! what signifies it between you and me? Well! well!\r\n     I ask your pardon.' 'Speak louder, Sir; I don't hear a word you\r\n     say.' And indeed he was so very tall, that it seemed as if the\r\n     sound, sent feebly from below, could not ascend to such a height.\r\n     This is the hero who is to figure at Brentford.\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Foote's favourite coffee-house was the Bedford. He was also a\r\n     constant frequenter of Tom's, and took a lead in the Club held\r\n     there, and already described.\r\n\r\n     Dr. Barrowby, the well-known newsmonger of the Bedford, and the\r\n     satirical critic of the day, has left this whole-length sketch of\r\n     Foote:\r\n\r\n     \"One evening (he says) he saw a young man extravagantly dressed out\r\n     in a frock suit of green and silver lace, bag-wig, sword, bouquet,\r\n     and point ruffles, enter the room (at the Bedford), and immediately\r\n     join the critical circle at the upper end. Nobody recognized him;\r\n     but such was the ease of his bearing, and the point of humor and\r\n     remark with which he at once took up the conversation, that his\r\n     presence seemed to disconcert no one, and a sort of pleased buzz of\r\n     'who is he?' was still going round the room unanswered, when a\r\n     handsome carriage stopped at the door; he rose, and quitted the\r\n     room, and the servants announced that his name was Foote, and that\r\n     he was a young gentleman of family and fortune, a student of the\r\n     Inner Temple, and that the carriage had called for him on its way\r\n     to the assembly of a lady of fashion\". Dr. Barrowby once turned the\r\n     laugh against Foote at the Bedford, when he was ostentatiously\r\n     showing his gold repeater, with the remark--'Why, my watch does not\r\n     go!' 'It soon _will go_,' quietly remarked the Doctor. Young\r\n     Collins, the poet, who came to town in 1744 to seek his fortune,\r\n     made his way to the Bedford, where Foote was supreme among the wits\r\n     and critics. Like Foote, Collins was fond of fine clothes, and\r\n     walked about with a feather in his hat, very unlike a young man who\r\n     had not a single guinea he could call his own. A letter of the time\r\n     tells us that \"Collins was an acceptable companion everywhere; and\r\n     among the gentlemen who loved him for a genius, may be reckoned the\r\n     Doctors Armstrong, Barrowby, Hill, Messrs. Quin, Garrick, and\r\n     Foote, who frequently took his opinions upon their pieces before\r\n     they were seen by the public. He was particularly noticed by the\r\n     geniuses who frequented the Bedford and Slaughter's Coffee-houses.\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Ten years later (1754) we find Foote again supreme in his critical\r\n     corner at the Bedford. The regular frequenters of the room strove\r\n     to get admitted to his party at supper; and others got as near as\r\n     they could to the table, as the only humor flowed from Foote's\r\n     tongue. The Bedford was now in its highest repute.\r\n\r\n     Foote and Garrick often met at the Bedford, and many and sharp were\r\n     their encounters. They were the two great rivals of the day. Foote\r\n     usually attacked, and Garrick, who had many weak points, was mostly\r\n     the sufferer. Garrick, in early life, had been in the wine trade,\r\n     and had supplied the Bedford with wine; he was thus described by\r\n     Foote as living in Durham-yard, with three quarts of vinegar in the\r\n     cellar, calling himself a wine-merchant. How Foote must have abused\r\n     the Bedford wine of this period!\r\n\r\n     One night, Foote came into the Bedford, where Garrick was seated,\r\n     and there gave him an account of a most wonderful actor he had just\r\n     seen. Garrick was on the tenters of suspense, and there Foote kept\r\n     him a full hour. Foote brought the attack to a close by asking\r\n     Garrick what he thought of Mr. Pitt's histrionic talents, when\r\n     Garrick, glad of the release, declared that if Pitt had chosen the\r\n     stage, he might have been the first actor upon it.\r\n\r\n     Another night, Garrick and Foote were about to leave the Bedford\r\n     together, when the latter, in paying the bill, dropped a guinea;\r\n     and not finding it at once, said, \"Where on earth can it be gone\r\n     to?\"--\"Gone to the devil, I think,\" replied Garrick, who had\r\n     assisted in the search.--\"Well said, David!\" was Foote's reply,\r\n     \"let you alone for making a guinea go further than anybody else.\"\r\n\r\n     Churchill's quarrel with Hogarth began at the shilling rubber club,\r\n     in the parlour of the Bedford; when Hogarth used some very\r\n     insulting language towards Churchill, who resented it in the\r\n     _Epistle_. This quarrel showed more venom than wit. \"Never,\" says\r\n     Walpole, \"did two angry men of their abilities throw mud with less\r\n     dexterity.\"\r\n\r\n     Woodward, the comedian, mostly lived at the Bedford, was intimate\r\n     with Stacie, the landlord, and gave him his (W.'s) portrait, with a\r\n     mask in his hand, one of the early pictures by Sir Joshua Reynolds.\r\n     Stacie played an excellent game at whist. One morning about two\r\n     o'clock, one of the waiters awoke him to tell him that a nobleman\r\n     had knocked him up, and had desired him to call his master to play\r\n     a rubber with him for one hundred guineas. Stacie got up, dressed\r\n     himself, won the money, and was in bed and asleep, all within an\r\n     hour.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     After Macklin had retired from the stage, in 1754, he opened that\r\n     portion of the Piazza-houses, in Covent Garden, afterwards known as\r\n     the Tavistock Hotel. Here he fitted up a large coffee-room, a\r\n     theatre for oratory, and other apartments. To a three-shilling\r\n     ordinary he added a shilling lecture, or \"School of Oratory and\r\n     Criticism;\" he presided at the dinner table, and carved for the\r\n     company; after which he played a sort of \"Oracle of Eloquence.\"\r\n     Fielding has happily sketched him in his \"Voyage to Lisbon\":\r\n     \"Unfortunately for the fishmongers of London, the Dory only resides\r\n     in the Devonshire seas; for could any of this company only convey\r\n     one to the Temple of luxury under the piazza, where Macklin, the\r\n     high priest, daily serves up his rich offerings, great would be the\r\n     reward of that fishmonger.\"\r\n\r\n     In the Lecture, Macklin undertook to make each of his audience an\r\n     orator, by teaching him how to speak. He invited hints and\r\n     discussions; the novelty of the scheme attracted the curiosity of\r\n     numbers; and this curiosity he still further excited by a very\r\n     uncommon controversy which now subsisted, either in imagination or\r\n     reality, between him and Foote, who abused one another very\r\n     openly--\"Squire Sammy,\" having for his purpose engaged the Little\r\n     Theatre in the Haymarket.\r\n\r\n     Besides this personal attack, various subjects were debated here\r\n     in the manner of the Robin Hood Society, which filled the Orator's\r\n     pocket, and proved his rhetoric of some value.\r\n\r\n     Here is one of his combats with Foote. The subject was Duelling In\r\n     Ireland, which Macklin had illustrated as far as the reign of\r\n     Elizabeth. Foote cried, \"Order;\" he had a question to put. \"Well,\r\n     Sir,\" said Macklin, \"what have you to say on this subject,\" \"I\r\n     think, Sir\" said Foote, \"this matter might be settled in a few\r\n     words. What o'clock is it, Sir?\" Macklin could not possibly see\r\n     what the clock had to do with a dissertation upon Duelling, but\r\n     gruffly reported the hour to be half-past nine. \"Very well,\" said\r\n     Foote, \"about this time of the night every gentleman in Ireland\r\n     that can possibly afford it is in his third bottle of claret, and\r\n     therefore in a fair way of getting drunk; and from drunkenness\r\n     proceeds quarrelling, and from quarrelling, duelling, and so\r\n     there's an end of the chapter.\" The company were much obliged to\r\n     Foote for his interference, the hour being considered; though\r\n     Macklin did not relish this abridgment.\r\n\r\n     The success of Foote's fun upon Macklin's Lectures, led him to\r\n     establish a summer entertainment of his own at the Haymarket. He\r\n     took up Macklin's notion of applying Greek tragedy to modern\r\n     subjects, and the squib was so successful that Foote cleared by it\r\n     500£ in five nights, while the great Piazza Coffee-room in Covent\r\n     Garden was shut up, and Macklin in the _Gazette_ as a bankrupt.\r\n\r\n     But when the great plan of Mr. Macklin proved abortive, when as he\r\n     said in a former prologue, upon a nearly similar occasion--\r\n\r\nFrom scheming, fretting, famine and despair.\r\nWe saw to grace restor'd an exiled player;\r\n\r\n     when the town was sated with the seemingly-concocted quarrel\r\n     between the two theatrical geniuses, Macklin locked his doors, all\r\n     animosity was laid aside, and they came and shook hands at the\r\n     Bedford; the group resumed their appearance, and, with a new\r\n     master, a new set of customers was seen.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Tom King's Coffee-house was one of the old night-houses of Covent\r\n     Garden Market; it was a rude shed immediately beneath the portico\r\n     of St. Paul's Church, and was one \"well known to all gentlemen to\r\n     whom beds are unknown.\" Fielding in one of his Prologues says:\r\n\r\nWhat rake is ignorant of King's Coffee-house?\r\n\r\n     It is in the background of Hogarth's print of _Morning_ where the\r\n     prim maiden lady, walking to church, is soured with seeing two\r\n     fuddled _beaux_ from King's Coffee-house caressing two frail women.\r\n     At the door there is a drunken row, in which swords and cudgels are\r\n     the weapons[358].\r\n\r\n     Harwood's _Alumni Etonenses_, p. 239, in the account of the Boys\r\n     elected from Eton to King's College, contains this entry: \"A.D.\r\n     1713, Thomas King, born at West Ashton, in Wiltshire, went away\r\n     scholar in apprehension that his fellowship would be denied him;\r\n     and afterwards kept that Coffee-house in Covent Garden, which was\r\n     called by his own name.\"\r\n\r\n     Moll King was landlady after Tom's death: she was witty, and her\r\n     house was much frequented, though it was little better than a shed.\r\n     \"Noblemen and the first _beaux_,\" said Stacie, \"after leaving Court\r\n     would go to her house in full dress, with swords and bags, and in\r\n     rich brocaded silk coats, and walked and conversed with persons of\r\n     every description. She would serve chimney-sweepers, gardeners, and\r\n     the market-people in common with her lords of the highest rank. Mr.\r\n     Apreece, a tall thin man in rich dress, was her constant customer.\r\n     He was called Cadwallader by the frequenters of Moll's.\" It is not\r\n     surprising that Moll was often fined for keeping a disorderly\r\n     house. At length, she retired from business--and the pillory--to\r\n     Hempstead, where she lived on her ill-earned gains, but paid for a\r\n     pew in church, and was charitable at appointed seasons, and died in\r\n     peace in 1747.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The Piazza Coffee-house at the northeastern angle of Covent Garden\r\n     Piazza, appears to have originated with Macklin's; for we read in\r\n     an advertisement in the _Publick Adviser_, March 5, 1756; \"The\r\n     Great Piazza Coffee-room, in Covent Garden.\"\r\n\r\n     The Piazza was much frequented by Sheridan; and here is located the\r\n     well-known anecdote told of his coolness during the burning of\r\n     Drury-lane Theatre, in 1809. It is said that as he sat at the\r\n     Piazza, during the fire, taking some refreshment, a friend of his\r\n     having remarked on the philosophical calmness with which he bore\r\n     his misfortune, Sheridan replied:\r\n\r\n     \"A man may surely be allowed to take a glass of wine by his _own\r\n     fireside_.\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Sheridan and John Kemble often dined together at the Piazza, to be\r\n     handy to the theatre. During Kemble's management, Sheridan had\r\n     occasion to make a complaint, which brought a \"nervous\" letter from\r\n     Kemble, to which Sheridan's reply is amusing enough. Thus, he\r\n     writes: \"that the management of a theatre is a situation capable of\r\n     becoming _troublesome_, is information which I do not want, and a\r\n     discovery which I thought you made long ago.\" Sheridan then treats\r\n     Kemble's letter as \"a nervous flight,\" not to be noticed seriously,\r\n     adding his anxiety for the interest of the theatre, and alluding to\r\n     Kemble's touchiness and reserve; and thus concludes:\r\n\r\n     \"If there is anything amiss in your mind not arising from the\r\n     _troublesomeness_ of your situation, it is childish and unmanly not\r\n     to disclose it. The frankness with which I have dealt towards you\r\n     entitles me to expect that you should have done so.\r\n\r\n     \"But I have no reason to believe this to be the case; and\r\n     attributing your letter to a disorder which I know ought not to be\r\n     indulged, I prescribe that thou shalt keep thine appointment at the\r\n     Piazza Coffee-house, tomorrow at five, and, taking four bottles of\r\n     claret instead of three, to which in sound health you might stint\r\n     yourself, forget that you ever wrote the letter, as I shall that I\r\n     ever received it.\"\r\n\r\n\"R.B. Sheridan.\"\r\n\r\n     The Piazza facade, and interior, were of Gothic design. When the\r\n     house was demolished, in its place was built the Floral Hall, after\r\n     the Crystal Palace model.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The Chapter Coffee-house was a literary place of resort in\r\n     Paternoster Row, more especially in connection with the\r\n     Wittinagemot of the last century. A very interesting account of the\r\n     Chapter, at a later period (1848) is given by Mrs. Gaskell.\r\n\r\n     Goldsmith frequented the Chapter, and always occupied one place,\r\n     which for many years after was the seat of literary honor there.\r\n     There are leather tokens of the Chapter Coffee-house in existence.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Child's Coffee-house, in St. Paul's Churchyard, was one of the\r\n     _Spectator's_ houses. \"Sometimes,\" he says, \"I smoke a pipe at\r\n     Child's and whilst I seem attentive to nothing but the _Postman_,\r\n     overhear the conversation of every table in the room.\" It was much\r\n     frequented by the clergy; for the _Spectator_, No. 609, notices the\r\n     mistake of a country gentleman in taking all persons in scarfs for\r\n     Doctors of Divinity, since only a scarf of the first magnitude\r\n     entitles him to \"the appellation of Doctor from his landlady and\r\n     the _Boy at Child's_.\"\r\n\r\n     Child's was the resort of Dr. Mead, and other professional men of\r\n     eminence. The Fellows of the Royal Society came here. Whiston\r\n     relates that Sir Hans Sloane, Dr. Halley and he were once at\r\n     Child's when Dr. H. asked him, W., why he was not a member of the\r\n     Royal Society? Whiston answered, because they durst not choose a\r\n     heretic. Upon which Dr. H. said, if Sir Hans Sloane would propose\r\n     him, W., he, Dr. H., would second it, which was done accordingly.\r\n\r\n     The propinquity of Child's to the Cathedral and Doctors' Commons,\r\n     made it the resort of the clergy, and ecclesiastical loungers. In\r\n     that respect, Child's was superseded by the Chapter, in Paternoster\r\n     Row.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The London Coffee-house was established previous to the year 1731,\r\n     for we find of it the following advertisement:\r\n\r\n\"May, 1731.\r\n\r\n     \"Whereas, it is customery for Coffee-houses and other\r\n     Public-houses, to take 8s. for a quart of Arrack, and 6s. for a\r\n     quart of Brandy or Rum, made into Punch:\r\n\r\n     \"This is to give notice,\r\n\r\n     \"That James Ashley has opened on Ludgate Hill, the London\r\n     Coffee-house, Punch-house, Dorchester Beer and Welsh Ale Warehouse,\r\n     where the finest and best old Arrack, Rum and French Brandy is made\r\n     into Punch, with the other of the finest Ingredients--viz., A quart\r\n     of Arrack made into Punch for six shillings; and so in proportion\r\n     to the smallest quantity, which is half-a-quartern for fourpence\r\n     half-penny. A quart of Rum or Brandy made into Punch for four\r\n     shillings; and so in proportion to the smallest quantity, which is\r\n     half-a-quartern for fourpence half-penny; and gentlemen may have it\r\n     as soon made as a gill of Wine can be drawn.\"\r\n\r\n     The premises occupied a Roman site; for, in 1800, in the rear of\r\n     the house, in a bastion of the City Wall, was found a sepulchral\r\n     monument dedicated to Claudina Martina by her husband, a provincial\r\n     Roman soldier; here also were found a fragment of a statue of\r\n     Hercules and a female head. In front of the Coffee-house\r\n     immediately west of St. Martin's Church, stood Ludgate.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The London Coffee-house was noted for its publishers' sales of\r\n     stock and copyrights. It was within the rules of the Fleet prison;\r\n     and in the Coffee-house were \"locked up\" for the night such juries\r\n     from the Old Bailey Sessions, as could not agree upon verdicts. The\r\n     house was long kept by the grandfather and father of Mr. John\r\n     Leech, the celebrated artist.\r\n\r\n     A singular incident occurred at the London Coffee-house, many years\r\n     since: Mr. Brayley, the topographer, was present at a party here,\r\n     when Mr. Broadhurst, the famous tenor, by singing a high note,\r\n     caused a wine-glass on the table to break, the bowl being separated\r\n     from the stem.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     From _The Kingdom's Intelligencer_, a weekly paper, published by\r\n     authority, in 1662, we learn that there had just been opened a \"new\r\n     coffee-house,\" with the sign of the Turk's Head, where was sold by\r\n     retail \"the right coffee-powder,\" from 4s. to 6s. 8d. per pound;\r\n     that pounded in a mortar, 2s; East Indian berry, 1s. 6d.; and the\r\n     right Turkie berry, well garbled, at 3s. \"The ungarbled for lesse,\r\n     with directions how to use the same.\" Also Chocolate at 2s. 6d. per\r\n     pound; the perfumed from 4s. to 10s.; \"also, Sherbets made in\r\n     Turkie, of lemons, roses and violets perfumed; and Tea, or Chaa,\r\n     according to its goodness. The house seal is Morat the Great.\r\n     Gentlemen customers and acquaintances are (the next New Year's Day)\r\n     invited to the sign of the Great Turk at this new Coffee-house,\r\n     where Coffee will be on free cost.\" Morat figures as a tyrant in\r\n     Dryden's \"Aurung Zebe.\" There is a token of this house, with the\r\n     sultan's head, in the Beaufoy collection[359].\r\n\r\n     Another token in the same collection, is of unusual excellence,\r\n     probably by John Roettier. It has on the obverse, Morat ye Great\r\n     Men did mee call,--Sultan's head; reverse, Where eare I came I\r\n     conquered all.--In the field, Coffee, Tobacco, Sherbet, Tea,\r\n     Chocolate, retail in Exchange Alee. \"The word Tea,\" says Mr. Burn,\r\n     \"occurs on no other tokens than those issued from 'the Great Turk'\r\n     Coffee-house, in Exchange alley;\" in one of its advertisements,\r\n     1662, tea is from 6s. to 60s. a pound.\r\n\r\n     Competition arose. One Constantine Jennings in Threadneedle-street,\r\n     over against St. Christopher's Church, advertised that coffee,\r\n     chocolate, sherbet, and tea, the right Turkey berry, may be had as\r\n     cheap and as good of him as is anywhere to be had for money; and\r\n     that people may there be taught to prepare the said liquors gratis.\r\n\r\n     Pepys, in his \"Diary,\" tells, September 25, 1669, of his sending\r\n     for \"a cup of Tea, a China Drink, he had not before tasted.\" Henry\r\n     Bennet, Earl of Arlington, about 1666, introduced tea at Court.\r\n     And, in his \"Sir Charles Sedley's Mulberry Garden,\" we are told\r\n     that \"he who wished to be considered a man of fashion always drank\r\n     wine-and-water at dinner, and a dish of tea afterwards.\" These\r\n     details are condensed from Mr. Burn's excellent \"Beaufoy\r\n     Catalogue,\" 2nd edition, 1855.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     In Gerard-street, Soho, also, was another Turk's Head Coffee-house,\r\n     where was held a Turk's Head Society; in 1777, we find Gibbon\r\n     writing to Garrick: \"At this time of year (August 14) the Society\r\n     of the Turk's Head can no longer be addressed as a corporate body,\r\n     and most of the individual members are probably dispersed: Adam\r\n     Smith, in Scotland; Burke in the shades of Beaconsfield; Fox, the\r\n     Lord or the devil knows where.\"\r\n\r\n     The place was a kind of headquarters for the Loyal Association\r\n     during the Rebellion of 1745. Here was founded \"The Literary Club\"\r\n     and a select body for the Protection and Encouragement of Art.\r\n     Another Society of Artists met in Peter's-court, St. Martin's-lane,\r\n     from the year 1739 to 1769. After continued squabbles, which lasted\r\n     for many years, the principal artists met together at the Turk's\r\n     Head, where many others having joined them, they petitioned the\r\n     King (George III) to become patron of a Royal Academy of Art. His\r\n     Majesty consented; and the new Society took a room in Pall Mall,\r\n     opposite to Market-lane, where they remained until the King, in the\r\n     year 1771, granted them apartments in Old Somerset House.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The Turk's Head Coffee-house, No. 142, in the Strand, was a\r\n     favourite supping-house with Dr. Johnson and Boswell, in whose Life\r\n     of Johnson are several entries, commencing with 1763--\"At night,\r\n     Mr. Johnson and I supped in a private room at the Turk's Head\r\n     Coffee-house, in the Strand; 'I encourage this house,' said he,\r\n     'for the mistress of it is a good civil woman, and has not much\r\n     business'.\" Another entry is--\"We concluded the day at the Turk's\r\n     Head Coffee-house very socially.\" And, August 3, 1673--\"We had our\r\n     last social meeting at the Turk's Head Coffee-house, before my\r\n     setting out for foreign parts.\"\r\n\r\n     The name was afterwards changed to \"The Turk's Head, Canada and\r\n     Bath Coffee-house,\" and was a well frequented tavern and hotel.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     At the Turk's Head, or Miles's Coffee-house, New Palace-yard,\r\n     Westminster, the noted Rota Club met, founded by Harrington, in\r\n     1659; where was a large oval table, with a passage in the middle,\r\n     for Miles to deliver his coffee.[360]\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     For many years previous to the streets of London being completely\r\n     paved, \"Slaughter's Coffee-house\" was called \"The Coffee-house on\r\n     the Pavement.\" Besides being the resort of artists, Old Slaughter's\r\n     was the house of call for Frenchmen.\r\n\r\n     St. Martin's-lane was long one of the headquarters of the artists\r\n     of the last century. \"In the time of Benjamin West,\" says J.T.\r\n     Smith, \"and before the formation of the Royal Academy,\r\n     Greek-street, St. Martin's-lane, and Gerard-street, was their only\r\n     colony. Old Slaughter's Coffee-house, in St. Martin's-lane, was\r\n     their grand resort in the evenings, and Hogarth was a constant\r\n     visitor.\" He lived at the Golden Head, on the eastern side of\r\n     Leicester Fields, in the northern half of the Sabloniere Hotel. The\r\n     head he cut out himself from pieces of cork, glued and bound\r\n     together; it was placed over the street-door. At this time, young\r\n     Benjamin West was living in chambers, in Bedford-street, Covent\r\n     Garden, and had there set up his easel; he was married in 1765, at\r\n     St. Martin's Church. Roubiliac was often to be found at Slaughter's\r\n     in early life; probably before he gained the patronage of Sir\r\n     Edward Walpole, through finding and returning to the baronet the\r\n     pocket-book of bank-notes which the young maker of monuments had\r\n     picked up in Vauxhall Gardens. Sir Edward, to remunerate his\r\n     integrity, and his skill, of which he showed specimens, promised to\r\n     patronize Roubiliac through life, and he faithfully performed this\r\n     promise. Young Gainsborough, who spent three years amid the works\r\n     of the painters in St. Martin's-lane, Hayman, and Cipriani, who\r\n     were all eminently convival, were, in all probability, frequenters\r\n     of Slaughter's. Smith tells us that Quin and Hayman were\r\n     inseparable friends, and so convival, that they seldom parted till\r\n     daylight.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Cunningham relates that here, \"in early life, Wilkie would\r\n     enjoy a small dinner at a small cost. I have been told by an old\r\n     frequenter of the house, that Wilkie was always the last dropper-in\r\n     for dinner, and that he was never seen to dine in the house by\r\n     daylight. The truth is, he slaved at his art at home till the last\r\n     glimpse of daylight had disappeared.\"\r\n\r\n     Haydon was accustomed, in the early days of his fitful career, to\r\n     dine here with Wilkie. In his \"Autobiography,\" in the year 1808,\r\n     Haydon writes: \"This period of our lives was one of great\r\n     happiness; painting all day, then dining at the Old Slaughter\r\n     Chop-house, then going to the Academy until eight to fill up the\r\n     evening, then going home to tea--that blessing of a studious\r\n     man--talking over respective exploits, what he, Wilkie, had been\r\n     doing and what I had been doing, and, then frequently to relieve\r\n     our minds fatigued by their eight and twelve hours' work, giving\r\n     vent to the most extraordinary absurdities. Often have we made\r\n     rhymes on odd names, and shouted with laughter at each new line\r\n     that was added. Sometimes lazily inclined after a good dinner, we\r\n     have lounged about, near Drury Lane or Covent Garden, hesitating\r\n     whether to go in, and often have I (knowing first that there was\r\n     nothing I wished to see) assumed a virtue I did not possess, and\r\n     pretending moral superiority, preached to Wilkie on the weakness of\r\n     not resisting such temptations for the sake of our art and our\r\n     duty, and marched him off to his studies, when he was longing to\r\n     see Mother Goose.\"\r\n\r\n     J.T. Smith refers to Old Slaughter's as \"formerly the rendezvous of\r\n     Pope, Dryden and other wits, and much frequented by several\r\n     eminently clever men of his day.\"\r\n\r\n     Thither came Ware, the architect, who, when a little sickly boy,\r\n     was apprenticed to a chimney-sweeper, and was seen chalking the\r\n     street-front of Whitehall, by a gentleman who purchased the\r\n     remainder of the boy's time; gave him an excellent education; then\r\n     sent him to Italy, and, upon his return, employed him, and\r\n     introduced him to his friends as an architect. Ware was heard to\r\n     tell this story while he was sitting to Roubiliac for his bust.\r\n     Ware built Chesterfield House and several other noble mansions, and\r\n     compiled a Palladio, in folio: he retained the soot in his skin to\r\n     the day of his death. He was very intimate with Roubiliac, who was\r\n     an opposite eastern neighbour of Old Slaughter's. Another\r\n     architect, Gwynn, who competed with Mylne for designing and\r\n     building Blackfriars Bridge, was also a frequent visitor at Old\r\n     Slaughter's, as was Gravelot, who kept a drawing-school in the\r\n     Strand, nearly opposite to Southampton-street.\r\n\r\n     Hudson, who painted the Dilettanti portraits; M'Ardell, the\r\n     mezzotinto-scraper; and Luke Sullivan, the engraver of Hogarth's\r\n     March to Finchley, also frequented Old Slaughter's; likewise\r\n     Theodore Gardell, the portrait painter, who was executed for the\r\n     murder of his landlady: and Old Moser, keeper of the Drawing\r\n     Academy in Peter's-court.\r\n\r\n     Parry, the Welsh harper, though totally blind, was one of the first\r\n     draught-players in England, and occasionally played with the\r\n     frequenters of Old Slaughter's; and here in consequence of a bet.\r\n     Roubiliac introduced Nathaniel Smith (father of John Thomas), to\r\n     play at draughts with Parry; the game lasted about half an hour;\r\n     Parry was much agitated, and Smith proposed to give in; but as\r\n     there were bets depending, it was played out, and Smith won. This\r\n     victory brought Smith numerous challenges; and the dons of the\r\n     Barn, a public-house, in St. Martin's-lane, nearly opposite the\r\n     church, invited him to become a member; but Smith declined. The\r\n     Barn, for many years, was frequented by all the noted players of\r\n     chess and draughts; and it was there that they often decided games\r\n     of the first importance, played between persons of the highest\r\n     rank.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The Grecian Coffee-house, Devereux-court, Strand, (closed in 1843)\r\n     was named from Constantine, of Threadneedle street, the _Grecian_\r\n     who kept it. In the _Tatler_ announcement, all accounts of learning\r\n     are to be \"under the title of the Grecian;\" and, in the _Tatler_,\r\n     No. 6: \"While other parts of the town are amused with the present\r\n     actions (Marlborough's) we generally spend the evening at this\r\n     table (at the Grecian) in inquiries into antiquity, and think\r\n     anything new, which gives us new knowledge. Thus, we are making a\r\n     very pleasant entertainment to ourselves in putting the actions of\r\n     Homer's Iliad into an exact journal.\"\r\n\r\n     The _Spectator's_ face was very well known at the Grecian, a\r\n     coffee-house \"adjacent to the law.\" Occasionally it was the scene\r\n     of learned discussion. Thus Dr. King relates that one evening, two\r\n     gentlemen, who were constant companions, were disputing here,\r\n     concerning the accent of a Greek word. This dispute was carried to\r\n     such a length, that the two friends thought proper to determine it\r\n     with their swords; for this purpose they stepped into\r\n     Devereux-court, where one of them (Dr. King thinks his name was\r\n     Fitzgerald) was run through the body, and died on the spot.\r\n\r\n     The Grecian was Foote's morning lounge. It was handy, too, for the\r\n     young Templar, Goldsmith, and often did it echo with Oliver's\r\n     boisterous mirth; for \"it had become the favourite resort of the\r\n     Irish and Lancashire Templars, whom he delighted in collecting\r\n     around him, in entertaining with a cordial and unostentatious\r\n     hospitality, and in occasionally amusing with his flute, or with\r\n     whist, neither of which he played very well!\" Here Goldsmith\r\n     occasionally wound up his \"Shoemaker's Holiday\" with supper.\r\n\r\n     It was at the Grecian that Fleetwood Shephard told this memorable\r\n     story to Dr. Tancred Robinson, who gave Richardson permission to\r\n     repeat it. \"The Earle of Dorset was in Little Britain, beating\r\n     about for books to his taste: there was 'Paradise Lost'. He was\r\n     surprised with some passages he struck upon, dipping here and there\r\n     and bought it; the bookseller begged him to speak in his favour, if\r\n     he liked it, for they lay on his hands as waste paper.... Shephard\r\n     was present. My Lord took it home, read it, and sent it to Dryden,\r\n     who in a short time returned it. 'This man,' says Dryden, 'cuts us\r\n     all out, and the ancients, too!'\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     George's Coffee-house, No. 213, Strand, near Temple Bar, was a\r\n     noted resort in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. When it\r\n     was a coffee-house, one day, there came in Sir James Lowther, who\r\n     after changing a piece of silver with the coffee-woman, and paying\r\n     twopence for his dish of coffee, was helped into his chariot, for\r\n     he was very lame and infirm, and went home: some little time\r\n     afterwards, he returned to the same coffee-house, on purpose to\r\n     acquaint the woman who kept it, that she had given him a bad\r\n     half-penny, and demanded another in exchange for it. Sir James had\r\n     about £40,000 per annum.\r\n\r\n     Shenstone, who found \"the warmest welcome at an inn,\" found\r\n     George's to be economical. \"What do you think,\" he writes, \"must be\r\n     my expense, who love to pry into everything of the kind? Why, truly\r\n     one shilling. My company goes to George's Coffee-house, where, for\r\n     that small subscription I read all pamphlets under a three\r\n     shillings' dimension; and indeed, any larger would not be fit for\r\n     coffee-house perusal.\" Shenstone relates that Lord Oxford was at\r\n     George's, when the mob, that were carrying his Lordship in effigy,\r\n     came into the box where he was, to beg money of him, amongst\r\n     others; this story Horace Walpole contradicts, adding that he\r\n     supposes Shenstone thought that after Lord Oxford quitted his place\r\n     he went to the coffee-house to learn news.\r\n\r\n     Arthur Murphy frequented George's, \"where the town wits met every\r\n     evening.\" Lloyd, the law-student, sings:\r\n\r\nBy law let others toil to gain renown!\r\nFlorio's a gentleman, a man o' the town.\r\n\r\nHe nor courts clients, or the law regarding,\r\nHurries from Nando's down to Covent Garden.\r\nYet, he's a scholar; mark him in the pit,\r\nWith critic catcall sound the stops of wit!\r\nSupreme at George's, he harangues the throng,\r\nCensor of style, from tragedy to song.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The Percy Coffee-house, Rathbone-place, Oxford-street, no longer\r\n     exists; but it will be kept in recollection for its having given\r\n     name to one of the most popular publications of its class, namely,\r\n     the \"Percy Anecdotes,\" by Sholto and Reuben Percy, Brothers of the\r\n     Benedictine Monastery of Mont Benger, in forty-four parts,\r\n     commencing in 1820. So said the title pages, but the names and the\r\n     locality were _supposé_. Reuben Percy was Thomas Byerly, who died\r\n     in 1824; he was the brother of Sir John Byerley, and the first\r\n     editor of the _Mirror_, commenced by John Limbird, in 1822. Sholto\r\n     Percy was Joseph Clinton Robertson, who died in 1852; he was the\r\n     projector of the _Mechanics' Magazine_, which he edited from its\r\n     commencement to his death. The name of the collection of Anecdotes\r\n     was not taken, as at the time supposed, from the popularity of the\r\n     \"Percy Reliques,\" but from the Percy Coffee-house, where Byerley\r\n     and Robertson were accustomed to meet to talk over their joint\r\n     work. The _idea_ was, however, claimed by Sir Richard Phillips, who\r\n     stoutly maintained that it originated in a suggestion made by him\r\n     to Dr. Tilloch and Mr. Mayne, to cut the anecdotes from the many\r\n     years' files of the _Star_ newspaper, of which Dr. Tilloch was the\r\n     editor; and Mr. Byerley assistant editor; and to the latter\r\n     overhearing the suggestion, Sir Richard contested, might the \"Percy\r\n     Anecdotes\" be traced. They were very successful, and a large sum\r\n     was realised by the work.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Peele's Coffee-house, Nos. 177 and 178, Fleet-street, east corner\r\n     of Fetter-lane, was one of the coffee-houses of the Johnsonian\r\n     period; and here was long preserved a portrait of Dr. Johnson, on\r\n     the keystone of a chimney-piece, stated to have been painted by Sir\r\n     Joshua Reynolds. Peele's was noted for files of newspapers from\r\n     these dates: _Gazette_, 1759; _Times_, 1780; _Morning Chronicle_,\r\n     1773; _Morning Post_, 1773; _Morning Herald_, 1784; _Morning\r\n     Advertiser_, 1794; and the evening papers from their commencement.\r\n     The house is now a tavern.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Literature and Ideals_\r\n\r\nThe bibliography at the end of this work will serve to indicate the\r\nnature and extent of the general literature of coffee. Not that it is\r\ncomplete or nearly so; it would require twice the space to include\r\nmention of all the fugitive bits of verse, essays, and miscellaneous\r\nwritings in newspapers, and periodicals, dealing with the poetry and\r\nromance, history, chemistry, and physiological effects of coffee. Only\r\nthe early works, and the more notable contributions of the last three\r\ncenturies, are included in the bibliography; but there is sufficient to\r\nenable the student to analyze the lines of general progress.\r\n\r\nA study of the literature of coffee shows that the French really\r\ninternationalized the beverage. The English and Italians followed. With\r\nthe advent of the newspaper press, coffee literature began to suffer\r\nfrom its competition.\r\n\r\nThe complexities of modern life suggest that coffee drinking in\r\nperfection, the esthetics, and a new literature of coffee may once more\r\nbecome the pleasure of a small caste. Are the real pleasures of life,\r\nthe things truly worth while, only to the swift--the most efficient? Who\r\nshall say? Are not some of us, particularly in America, rather prone to\r\nglorify the gospel of work to such an extent that we are in danger of\r\nlosing the ability to understand or to enjoy anything else?\r\n\r\nGranted that this is so, coffee, already recognized as the most grateful\r\nlubricant known to the human machine, is destined to play another part\r\nof increasing importance in our national life as a kind of national\r\nshock-absorber as well. But its rôle is something more than this,\r\nsurely. When life is drab, it takes away its grayness. When life is sad,\r\nit brings us solace. When life is dull, it brings us new inspiration.\r\nWhen we are a-weary, it brings us comfort and good cheer.\r\n\r\nThe lure of coffee lies in its appeal to our finer sensibilities; and\r\nsigns are not wanting that that pursuit of the long, sweet happiness\r\nthat every one is seeking will lead some of us (even in big bustling\r\nAmerica) into footpaths that end in places where coffee will offer much\r\nof its pristine inspiration and charm. It probably will not be a coffee\r\nhouse anything like that of the long ago, but perhaps it will be a kind\r\nof modernized coffee club. Why not?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A COFFEE HOUSE IN HOLLAND, ABOUT 1650\r\n\r\nAfter the etching by J. Beauvarlet from a painting by Adriaen Van Ostade\r\n(1610-1675), which is said to be the earliest picture of a coffee house\r\nin western Europe]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nCOFFEE IN RELATION TO THE FINE ARTS\r\n\r\n     _How coffee and coffee drinking have been celebrated in painting,\r\n     engraving, sculpture, caricature, lithography, and music--Epics,\r\n     rhapsodies, and cantatas in praise of coffee--Beautiful specimens\r\n     of the art of the potter and the silversmith as shown in the coffee\r\n     service of various periods in the world's history--Some historical\r\n     relics_\r\n\r\n\r\nCoffee has inspired the imagination of many poets, musicians, and\r\npainters. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries those whose genius\r\nwas dedicated to the fine arts seem to have fallen under its spell and\r\nto have produced much of great beauty that has endured. To the painters,\r\nengravers, and caricaturists of that period we are particularly indebted\r\nfor pictures that have added greatly to our knowledge of early coffee\r\ncustoms and manners.\r\n\r\nAdriaen Van Ostade (1610-1685), the Dutch genre painter and etcher,\r\npupil of Frans Hals, in his \"Dutch Coffee House\" (1650), shows the\r\ngenesis of the coffee house of western Europe about the time it still\r\npartook of some of the tavern characteristics. Coffee is being served to\r\na group in the foreground. It is believed to be the oldest existing\r\npicture of a coffee house. The illustration is after the etching by J.\r\nBeauvarlet in the graphic collection at Munich.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hogarth (1697-1764), the famous English painter and engraver of\r\nsatirical subjects, chose the coffee houses of his time for the scenes\r\nof a number of his social caricatures. In his series, \"Four Times of the\r\nDay,\" which throws a vivid light on the street life of London of the\r\nperiod of 1738, we are shown Covent Garden at 7:55 A.M. by the clock on\r\nSt. Paul's Church. A prim maiden lady (said to have been sketched from\r\nan elderly relation of the artist, who cut him out of her will) on her\r\nway home from early service, accompanied by a shivering foot-boy, is\r\nscandalized by the spectacle presented by some roystering blades issuing\r\nfrom Tom King's notorious coffee house to the right. The _beaux_ are\r\nforcing their attentions upon the more comely of the market women in the\r\nforeground. Tom King was a scholar at Eton before he began his ignoble\r\ncareer. At the date of this picture, it is thought he had been succeeded\r\nby his widow, Moll King, also of scandalous repute.\r\n\r\nScene VI of the \"Rake's Progress\" by Hogarth is laid at the club in\r\nWhite's chocolate (coffee) house, which Dr. Swift described as \"the\r\ncommon rendezvous of infamous sharpers and noble cullies.\" The rake has\r\nlost all his recently acquired wealth, pulls off his wig and flings\r\nhimself upon the floor in a paroxysm of fury and execration. In allusion\r\nto the burning of White's in 1733, flames are seen bursting from the\r\nwainscot, but the pre-occupied gamblers take no heed, even of the\r\nwatchman crying \"Fire!\" To the left is seated a highwayman, with horse\r\npistol and black mask in a skirt pocket of his coat. He is so engrossed\r\nin his thoughts that he does not notice the boy at his side offering a\r\nglass of liquor on a tray. The scene well depicts the low estate to\r\nwhich White's had fallen. It recalls a bit of dialogue from Farquhar's\r\n_Beaux' Stratagem_ (act III, scene 2), where Aimwell says to Gibbet, who\r\nis a highwayman: \"Pray, sir, ha'nt I seen your face at Will's Coffee\r\nHouse?\" \"Yes sir, and at White's, too,\" answers the highwayman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE CLUB AT WHITE'S COFFEE HOUSE, 1733\r\n\r\nFrom a painting in the series, \"The Rake's Progress,\" by William\r\nHogarth]\r\n\r\nAfter the fire, the club and chocolate house were removed to Gaunt's\r\ncoffee house. The removal was thus announced in the _Daily Post_ of May\r\n3:\r\n\r\n     This is to acquaint all noblemen and gentlemen that Mr. Arthur\r\n     having had the misfortune to be burnt out of White's Chocolate\r\n     House is removed to Gaunt's Coffee House, next the St. James Coffee\r\n     House in St. James Street, where he humbly begs they will favour\r\n     him with their company as usual.\r\n\r\nAlessandro Longhi (1733-1813) the Italian painter and engraver, called\r\nthe Venetian Hogarth, in one of his pictures presenting life and manners\r\nin Venice during the years of her decadence, shows Goldoni, the\r\ndramatist, as a visitor in a café of the period, with a female mendicant\r\nsoliciting alms.\r\n\r\nIn the Louvre at Paris hangs the \"Petit Déjeuner\" by François Boucher\r\n(1703-1770), famous court painter of Louis XV. It shows a French\r\nbreakfast-room of the period of 1744, and is interesting because it\r\nillustrates the introduction of coffee into the home; it shows also the\r\ncoffee service of the time.\r\n\r\nIn Van Loo's portrait of Madame de Pompadour, second mistress and\r\npolitical adviser of Louis XV of France, the coffee service of a later\r\nperiod of the eighteenth century appears. The Nubian servant is shown\r\noffering the marquise a demi-tasse which has just been poured from the\r\ncovered oriental pot which succeeded the original Arabian-Turkish\r\nboiler, and was much in vogue at the time.\r\n\r\nCoffee and Madame du Barry (or would it be more polite to say Madame du\r\nBarry and coffee?) inspired the celebrated painting of Madame de\r\nPompadour's successor in the affections of Louis \"the well beloved.\"\r\nThis is entitled \"Madame du Barry at Versailles\", and in the Versailles\r\ncatalog it is described as painted by Decreuse after Drouais. Decreuse\r\nwas a pupil of Gros, and painted many of the historical portraits at\r\nVersailles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOM KING'S COFFEE HOUSE IS COVENT GARDEN, 1738\r\n\r\nFrom a printing in the series, \"Four Times of the Day,\" by William\r\nHogarth]\r\n\r\nMalcolm C. Salaman, in his _French Color Prints of the XVIII Century_,\r\nreferring to Dagoty's print of this picture, done in 1771, says, \"the\r\noriginal has been attributed to François Hubert Drouais, but there can\r\nbe little doubt that the original portraiture was from the hand of the\r\nengraver (Dagoty), as the style is far inferior to Drouais.\" He thus\r\ndescribes it:\r\n\r\n     Here we see the last of Louis XV's mistresses, sitting in her\r\n     bedroom in that alluring retreat of hers at Louveciennes, near the\r\n     woods of Marly, as she takes her cup of coffee from her pet\r\n     attendant, the little negro boy, Zamore, as the Prince de Conti had\r\n     named him, all brave in red and gold. Doubtless she is expecting\r\n     the morning visit of the King, no longer the handsome young\r\n     gallant, but old and leaden-eyed, and puffy-cheeked; and perhaps it\r\n     will be on this very morning that she will wheedle Louis, in a\r\n     moment of extravagant badinage, into appointing the negro boy to be\r\n     Governor of the Chateau and Pavilion of Louveciennes at a handsome\r\n     salary, just as, on another day, she playfully teased the jaded old\r\n     sensualist into decorating with the cordon bleu her cuisinière when\r\n     it was triumphantly revealed to him that the dinner he had been\r\n     praising with enthusiastic gusto was, after all, the work of a\r\n     woman cook, the very possibility of which he had contemptuously\r\n     doubted. But as we look at these two, the royal mistress and her\r\n     little black favorite, we forget the \"well beloved\" and his\r\n     voluptuous pleasures and indulgences, for in the shadows we see\r\n     another picture, some twenty years on, when the proud\r\n     unconscionable beauty, no longer _reine de la main gauche_, stands\r\n     before the dreaded Tribunal of the Terror, while Zamore, the\r\n     treacherous, ungrateful negro, dismissed from his service at\r\n     Louveciennes and now devoted to the committee of public safety, and\r\n     one of her implacable accusers, sends her shrieking to the\r\n     guillotine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"PETIT DÉJEUNER,\" BY BOUCHER\r\n\r\nShowing the home coffee service of the period of 1744]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE SERVICE IN THE HOME OF MADAME DE\r\nPOMPADOUR--PAINTING BY VAN LOO]\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the coffee house into Europe was memorialized by\r\nFranz Schams, the genre painter, pupil of the Vienna Academy, in a\r\nbeautiful picture entitled \"The First Coffee House in Vienna, 1684,\"\r\nowned by the Austrian Art Society. A lithographic reproduction was\r\nexecuted by the artist and printed by Joseph Stoufs in Vienna. There are\r\nseveral specimens in the United States; and the illustration printed on\r\npage 48 has been made from one of these in the possession of the author.\r\n\r\nThe picture shows the interior of the Blue Bottle, where Kolschitzky\r\nopened the first coffee house in Vienna. The hero-proprietor stands in\r\nthe foreground pouring a cup of the beverage from an oriental coffee\r\npot, and another is suspended from the coffee-house sign that hangs over\r\nthe fireplace. In the fire alcove a woman is pounding coffee in a\r\nmortar. Men and women in the costumes of the period are being served\r\ncoffee by a Vienna _mädchen_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MADAME DU BARRY AND HER SLAVE BOY ZAMORE--PAINTING BY\r\nDECREUSE]\r\n\r\nThe painters Marilhat, Descamps, and de Tournemine have pictured café\r\nscenes; the first in his \"Café sur une route de Syrie\", which was shown\r\nat the Salon of 1844; the second in his \"Café Turc\", which figured at\r\nthe Exposition of 1855; and the third in his \"Café en Asia Mineure\",\r\nwhich received honors at the Salon of 1859, and attracted attention at\r\nthe Universal Exposition of 1867.\r\n\r\nA decorative panel designed for the buffet at the Paris Opera House by\r\nS. Mazerolles was shown at the Exposition of 1878. A French artist,\r\nJacquand, has painted two charming compositions; one representing the\r\nreading room, and the other the interior, of a café.\r\n\r\nMany German artists have shown coffee manners and customs in pictures\r\nthat are now hanging in well known European galleries. Among others,\r\nmention should be made of C. Schmidt's \"The Sweets Shop of Josty in\r\nBerlin\", 1845; Milde's \"Pastor Rautenberg and His Family at the Coffee\r\nTable\", 1833; and his \"Manager Classen and His Family at the Afternoon\r\nCoffee Table\", 1840; Adolph Menzel's \"Parisian Boulevard Café\", 1870;\r\nHugo Meith's \"Saturday Afternoon at the Coffee Table\"; John Philipp's\r\n\"Old Woman with Coffee Cup\"; Friedrich Walle's \"Afternoon Coffee in the\r\nCourt Gardens at Munich\"; Paul Meyerheim's \"Oriental Coffee House\"; and\r\nPeter Philippi's (Dusseldorf) \"Kaffeebesuch.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Exposition des Beaux Arts, Salon of 1881, there was shown P.A.\r\nRuffio's picture, \"Le café vient au secours de la Muse\" (Coffee comes to\r\nthe aid of the Muse), in which the graceful form of an oriental ewer\r\nappears.\r\n\r\nThe \"Coffee House at Cairo,\" a canvas by Jean Léon Gérôme (1824-1904)\r\nthat hangs in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, has been much\r\nadmired. It shows the interior of a typical oriental coffee house with\r\ntwo men near a furnace at the left preparing the beverage; a man seated\r\non a wicker basket about to smoke a hooka; a dervish dancing; and\r\nseveral persons seated against the wall in the background.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE HOUSE AT CAIRO--PAINTING BY GÉRÔME IN THE\r\nMETROPOLITAN MUSEUM, NEW YORK]\r\n\r\nThe New York Historical Society acquired in 1907 from Miss Margaret A.\r\nIngram an oil painting of the \"Tontine Coffee House.\" It was painted in\r\nPhiladelphia by Francis Guy, and was sold at a raffle, after having been\r\nadmired by President John Adams. It shows lower Wall Street in\r\n1796-1800, with the Tontine coffee house on the northwest corner of Wall\r\nand Water Streets, where its more famous predecessor, the Merchants\r\ncoffee house, was located before it moved to quarters diagonally\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\nCharles P. Gruppe's (_b._ 1860) painting showing General \"Washington's\r\nOfficial Welcome to New York by City and State Officials at the\r\nMerchants Coffee House,\" April 23, 1789, just one week before his\r\ninauguration as first president of the United States, is a colorful\r\ncanvas that has been much praised for its atmosphere and historical\r\nassociations. It is the property of the author.\r\n\r\nThe art museums and libraries of every country contain many beautiful\r\nwater-colors, engravings, prints, drawings, and lithographs, whose\r\ncreators found inspiration in coffee. Space permits the mention of only\r\na few.\r\n\r\nT.H. Shepherd has preserved for us Button's, afterward the Caledonien\r\ncoffee house, Great Russell Street, Covent Garden, in a water-color\r\ndrawing of 1857; Tom's coffee house, 17 Great Russell Street, Covent\r\nGarden, 1857; Slaughter's coffee house in St. Martin's Lane, 1841; also,\r\nin 1857, the Lion's Head at Button's, put up by Addison and now the\r\nproperty of the Duke of Bedford at Woburn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"KAFFEEBESUCH\"\r\n\r\nFrom the painting by Peter Philippi]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"COFFEE COMES TO THE AID OF THE MUSE\"\r\n\r\nFrom the painting by Ruffio]\r\n\r\nHogarth figures in the Sam Ireland collection with several original\r\ndrawings of frequenters of Button's in 1730.\r\n\r\nThomas Rowlandson (1756-1827) the great English caricaturist and\r\nillustrator, has given us several fine pictures of English coffee-house\r\nlife. His \"Mad Dog in a Coffee House\" presents a lively scene; and his\r\nwater-color of \"The French Coffee House\" is one of the best pictures we\r\nhave of the French coffee house in London as it looked during the latter\r\nhalf of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign in France in 1814, Napoleon arrived one day,\r\nunheralded, in a country presbytery, where the good curé was quietly\r\nturning his hand coffee-roaster. The emperor asked him, \"What are you\r\ndoing there, abbé?\" \"Sire\", replied the priest, \"I am doing like you. I\r\nam burning the colonial fodder.\" Charlet (1792-1845) made a lithograph\r\nof the incident.\r\n\r\nSeveral French poet-musicians resorted to music to celebrate coffee.\r\nBrittany has its own songs in praise of coffee, as have other French\r\nprovinces. There are many epics, rhapsodies, and cantatas--and even a\r\ncomic opera by Meilhat, music by Deffes, bearing the title, _Le Café du\r\nRoi_, produced at the Théâtre Lyrique, November 16, 1861.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"MAD DOG IN A COFFEE HOUSE\"--CARICATURE BY ROWLANDSON]\r\n\r\nFuzelier wrote, in honor of coffee, a cantata, set to music by Bernier.\r\nThis is the burden of the poet's song:\r\n\r\nAh coffee, what climes yet unknown,\r\nIgnore the clear fires that thy vapors inspire!\r\nThou countest, in thy vast empire\r\nThose realms that Bacchus' reign disown.\r\nFavored liquid, which fills all my soul with delights,\r\nThy enchantments to life happy hours persuade,\r\nWe vanquish e'en sleep by thy fortunate aid,\r\nThou hast rescued the hours sleep would rob from our nights.\r\nFavored liquid which fills all my soul with delights,\r\nThy enchantments to life happy hours persuade.\r\n\r\n    Oh liquid that I love,\r\n      Triumphant stream of sable,\r\n    E'en for the gods above,\r\n      Drive nectar from the table.\r\n    Make thou relentless war\r\n      On treacherous juices sly,\r\n    Let earth taste and adore\r\n      The sweet calm of the sky.\r\n    Oh liquid that I love,\r\n      Triumphant stream of sable,\r\n    E'en for the gods above,\r\n      Drive nectar from the table.\r\n\r\nDuring the early vogue of the café in Paris, a _chanson_, entitled\r\n_Coffee_, reproduced here, was set to music with accompaniment for the\r\npiano by M.H. Colet, a professor of harmony at the Conservatoire.\r\nPrinted in the form of a placard, and put up in cafés, it received the\r\napprobation of, and was signed by, de Voyer d'Argenson, at that time\r\n(1711) lieutenant of police. The poetry is not irreproachable. It can\r\nhardly be attributed to any of the well known poets of the time; but\r\nrather to one of those bohemian rimesters that wrote all too abundantly\r\non all sorts of subjects. It is the development of a theory concerning\r\nthe properties of coffee and the best method of making it. It is\r\ninteresting to note that the uses of advertising were known and\r\nappreciated in Paris in 1711; for in the _chanson_ there appears the\r\nname and address of one Vilain, a merchant, rue des Lombards, who was\r\nevidently in fashion at that period. The translation of the stanza\r\nreproduced is as follows:\r\n\r\nCOFFEE--A CHANSON\r\n\r\n    If you, with mind untroubled,\r\n    Would flourish, day by day,\r\nLet each day of the seven\r\n    Find coffee on your tray.\r\nIt will your frame preserve from every malady,\r\nIts virtues drive afar, la! la!\r\nMigrain and dread catarrh--ha! ha!\r\n    Dull cold and lethargy.\r\n\r\nThe most notable contribution to the \"music of coffee,\" if one may be\r\npermitted the expression, is the _Coffee Cantata_ of Johann Sebastian\r\nBach (1685-1750) the German organist and the most modern composer of the\r\nfirst half of the eighteenth century. He hymned the religious sentiment\r\nof protestant Germany; and in his _Coffee Cantata_ he tells in music the\r\nprotest of the fair sex against the libels of the enemies of the\r\nbeverage, who at the time were actively urging in Germany that it should\r\nbe forbidden women, because its use made for sterility! Later on, the\r\ngovernment surrounded the manufacture, sale, and use of coffee with many\r\nobnoxious restrictions, as told in chapter VIII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NAPOLEON AND THE CURÉ--LITHOGRAPH BY CHARLET]\r\n\r\nBach's _Coffee Cantata_ is No. 211 of the _Secular Cantatas_, and was\r\npublished in Leipzig in 1732. In German it is known as _Schweigt stille,\r\nplaudert nicht_ (Be silent, do not talk). It is written for soprano,\r\ntenor, and bass solos and orchestra. Bach used as his text a poem by\r\nPiccander. The cantata is really a sort of one-act operetta--a jocose\r\nproduction representing the efforts of a stern parent to check his\r\ndaughter's propensities in coffee drinking, the new fashioned habit. One\r\nseldom thinks of Bach as a humorist; but the music here is written in a\r\nmock-heroic vein, the recitatives and arias having a merry flavor,\r\nhinting at what the master might have done in light opera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE--A CHANSON; MUSIC BY COLET, 1711]\r\n\r\nThe libretto shows the father Schlendrian, or Slowpoke, trying by\r\nvarious threats to dissuade his daughter from further indulgence in the\r\nnew vice, and, in the end, succeeding by threatening to deprive her of a\r\nhusband. But his victory is only temporary. When the mother and the\r\ngrandmother indulge in coffee, asks the final trio, who can blame the\r\ndaughter?\r\n\r\nBach uses the spelling coffee--not _kaffee_. The cantata was sung as\r\nrecently as December 18, 1921, at a concert in New York by the Society\r\nof the Friends of Music, directed by Arthur Bodanzky.\r\n\r\nLieschen, or Betty, the daughter, has a delightful aria, beginning, \"Ah,\r\nhow sweet coffee tastes--lovelier than a thousand kisses, sweeter far\r\nthan muscatel wine!\" the opening bars of which are reproduced on page\r\n598.\r\n\r\nAs the text is not long, it is printed here in its entirety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATUE OF KOLSCHITZKY IN VIENNA]\r\n\r\n     _CHARACTERS_\r\n\r\nMESSENGER AND NARRATOR             _Tenor_\r\nSLOWPOKE                           _Bass_\r\nBETTY, DAUGHTER TO SLOWPOKE        _Soprano_\r\n\r\n     TENOR (_Recitative_): Be silent, do not talk, but notice what will\r\n     happen!

You won't give in to me?\r\n\r\n     SLOWPOKE (_Air_): Oh these girls--what obstinate dispositions they\r\n     do have! They certainly are not easy to manage!

It graces the second-floor corner of a house\r\nin the Favoriten Strasse, where it was erected in his honor by the\r\nCoffee Makers' Guild of Vienna. The great \"brother-heart\" is shown in\r\nthe attitude of pouring coffee into cups on a tray from an oriental\r\nservice pot.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Caffè Pedrocchi, the center of life in the city of Padua,\r\nItaly, in the early part of the nineteenth century, is one of the most\r\nbeautiful buildings erected in Italy. Its use is apparent at first\r\nglance. It was begun in 1816, opened June 9, 1831, and completed in\r\n1842. Antonio Pedrocchi (1776-1852), an obscure Paduan coffee-house\r\nkeeper, tormented by a desire for glory, conceived the idea of building\r\nthe most beautiful coffee house in the world, and carried it out.\r\n\r\nArtists and craftsmen of all ages since the discovery of coffee have\r\nbrought their genius into play to fashion various forms of apparatus\r\nassociated with the preparation of the coffee drink. Coffee roasters and\r\ngrinders have been made of brass, silver, and gold; coffee mortars, of\r\nbronze; and coffee making and serving pots, of beautiful copper, pewter,\r\npottery, porcelain, and silver designs.\r\n\r\nIn the Peter collection in the United States National Museum there is to\r\nbe seen a fine specimen of the Bagdad coffee pot made of beaten copper\r\nand used for making and serving; also, a beautiful Turkish coffee set.\r\nIn the Metropolitan Museum in New York there are some beautiful\r\nspecimens of Persian and Egyptian ewers in faience, probably used for\r\ncoffee service. Also, in American and continental museums are to be seen\r\nmany examples of seventeenth-century German, Dutch, and English bronze\r\nmortars and pestles used for \"braying\" coffee beans to make coffee\r\npowder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE GRINDER SET WITH JEWELS\r\n\r\nIn the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York]\r\n\r\nA very beautiful specimen of the oriental coffee grinder, made of brass\r\nand teakwood, set with red and green glass jewels, and inlaid in the\r\nteakwood with ivory and brass, is at the Metropolitan. This is of\r\nIndo-Persian design of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe Metropolitan Museum shows also many specimens of pewter coffee pots\r\nused in India, Germany, Holland, Belgium, France, Russia, and England in\r\nthe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nOne can guess at the luxuriousness of the coffee pots in use in France\r\nthroughout the eighteenth century by noting that from March 20, 1754, to\r\nApril 16, 1755, Louis XV bought no fewer than three gold coffee pots of\r\nLazare Duvaux. They had carved branches, and were supplied with \"chafing\r\ndishes of burnished steel\" and lamps for spirits of wine. They cost,\r\nrespectively, 1,950, 1,536, and 2,400 francs. In the \"inventory of\r\nMarie-Josephe de Saxe, Dauphine of France\", we note, too, a \"two cup\r\ncoffee pot of gold with its chafing dish for spirits of wine in a\r\nleather case.\"\r\n\r\nThe Italian wrought-iron coffee roaster of the seventeenth century was\r\noften a work of art. The specimen illustrated is rich in decorative\r\nmotifs associated with the best in Florentine art.\r\n\r\nMadame de Pompadour's inventory disclosed a \"gold coffee mill, carved in\r\ncolored gold to represent the branches of a coffee tree.\" The art of\r\ngold, which sought to embellish everything, did not disdain these homely\r\nutensils; and one may see at the Cluny Museum in Paris, among many mills\r\nof graceful form, a coffee mill of engraved iron dating from the\r\neighteenth century, upon which are represented the four seasons. We are\r\ntold, however, that it graced the \"sale after the death of Mme. de\r\nPompadour\", which, of course, makes it much more valuable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ITALIAN WROUGHT-IRON COFFEE ROASTER\r\n\r\nCourtesy of _Edison Monthly_]\r\n\r\n\"The tea pot, coffee pot and chocolate pot first used in England closely\r\nresembled each other in form\", says Charles James Jackson in his\r\n_Illustrated History of English Plate_, \"each being circular in plan,\r\ntapering towards the top, and having its handle fixed at a right angle\r\nwith the spout.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tea Pot, 1670\r\n\r\nCoffee Pot, 1681\r\n\r\nCoffee Pot, 1689\r\n\r\nSEVENTEENTH-CENTURY TEA POTS AND COFFEE POTS]\r\n\r\nHe says further:\r\n\r\n     The earliest examples were of oriental ware and the form of these\r\n     was adopted by the English plate workers as a model for others of\r\n     silver. It apparently was not until after both tea and coffee had\r\n     been used for several years in this country [England] that the tea\r\n     pot was made proportionately less in height and greater in diameter\r\n     than the coffee pot. This distinction, which was probably due to\r\n     copying the forms of Chinese porcelain tea pots, was afterwards\r\n     maintained, and to the present day the difference between the tea\r\n     pot and the coffee pot continued to be mainly one of height.\r\n\r\nThe coffee pot illustrated (1681) formerly belonged to the East India\r\nCompany, and is preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum. It is\r\nalmost identical with a tea pot (1670) in the same museum, except that\r\nits straight spout is fixed nearer to the base, as is its\r\nleather-covered handle, which, with the sockets into which it fits,\r\nforms a long recurving scroll fixed opposite to and in line with the\r\nspout. Its cover, which is hinged to the upper handle socket, is high\r\nlike that of the 1670 tea-pot; but instead of the straight outline of\r\nthat cover, this is slightly waved and surmounted by a somewhat flat\r\nbutton-shaped knob. Engraved on the body is a shield of arms, a chevron\r\nbetween three crosses fleury, surrounded by tied feathers. The\r\ninscription is, \"The Guift of Richard Sterne Eq to ye Honorable East\r\nIndia Compa.\"\r\n\r\nThis pot is nine and three-quarters inches in height by four and\r\nseven-eighths inches in diameter at the base; it bears the London\r\nhall-marks of 1681-82 and the maker's mark \"G.G.\" in a shaped shield,\r\nthought by Jackson to be George Garthorne's mark.\r\n\r\nThe 1689 coffee pot illustrated is the property of King George V. It\r\nbears the London hall-marks of 1689-90, and the mark of Francis\r\nGarthorne. Its tall, round body tapers toward the top, and has applied\r\nmoldings on the base and rim. Its spout is straight and tapers upward to\r\nthe level of the rim of the pot. Its handle is of ebony,\r\ncrescent-shaped, and riveted into two sockets fixed at a right angle\r\nwith the spout. The lid is a high cone surmounted by a small vase-shaped\r\nfinial, and is hinged to the upper socket of the handle. On no part of\r\nthe pot is there any ornamentation other than the royal cipher of King\r\nWilliam III and Queen Mary, which is engraved on the reverse side of the\r\nbody. This example, which measures nine inches in height to the top of\r\nits cover, resembles very closely in form the East India Company's\r\ntea-pot just referred to; but as teapots with much lower bodies appear\r\nto have come into fashion before 1689, this pot was probably used as a\r\ncoffee pot from the first.\r\n\r\nThe 1692 coffee pot of lantern shape is the property of H.D. Ellis, and\r\nhas its spout curved upward at the top, being furnished with a small,\r\nhinged flap and a scroll-shaped thumb-piece attached to the rim of the\r\ncover. The body and cover were originally quite plain, the embossing and\r\nchasing with symmetrical rococo decoration being added later, probably\r\nabout 1740. Jackson says the wooden handle is not the original one,\r\nwhich was probably C-shaped. The pot bears the usual London hall-marks\r\nfor the year 1692 and the maker's mark is \"G G\" upon a shaped shield, a\r\nmark recorded upon the copper plate belonging to the Goldsmiths'\r\ncompany, which Mr. Cripps thinks was that of George Garthorne. The\r\ncharacteristics of this lantern shaped coffee pot are:\r\n\r\n     1. The straight sides, so rapidly tapering from the base upward\r\n     that in a height of only six inches the base diameter of four and\r\n     three-eighths inches tapers to a diameter of no more than two and\r\n     one-half inches at the rim.\r\n\r\n     2. The nearly straight spout, furnished with a flap or shutter.\r\n\r\n     3. The true cone of the lid.\r\n\r\n     4. The thumb-piece, which is a familiar feature upon the tankards\r\n     of the period.\r\n\r\n     5. The handle fixed at right angles to the spout.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANTERN COFFEE POT, 1692]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOLKINGHAM POT, 1715-16]\r\n\r\nMr. Ellis, in a paper before the Society of Antiquaries[361] on the\r\nearliest form of coffee pot, says:\r\n\r\n     If coffee was first introduced into this country by the Turkey\r\n     merchants, nothing is more probable than that those who first\r\n     brought the berry, brought also the vessel in which it was to be\r\n     served. Such a vessel would be the Turkish ewer whose shape is\r\n     familiar to us, the same today as two hundred years ago, for in the\r\n     East things are slow to change. And throughout the reign of the\r\n     second Charles, so long as the extended use of coffee in the houses\r\n     of the people was retarded by the opposition of the Women of\r\n     England, and by the scarcely less powerful influence of the King's\r\n     Court, the small requirements of a mere handful of coffee-houses\r\n     would be easily met by the importation of Turkish vessels.\r\n     Reference to the coffee-house keepers' tokens in the Beaufoy\r\n     collection in the Guildhall Museum shows that many of the traders\r\n     of 1660-1675 adopted as their trade sign a hand pouring coffee from\r\n     a pot. This pot is invariably of the Turkish ewer pattern. It is\r\n     true that there is nothing to show that the Turks themselves ever\r\n     served coffee from the ewer, but it is scarcely conceivable that\r\n     the English coffee-house keepers should have adopted as their trade\r\n     sign, their pictorial advertisement, so to speak, a vessel which\r\n     had no connection with the commodity in which they dealt, and which\r\n     would convey no meaning associated with coffee to the public. But\r\n     as soon as the extended use of the beverage created a demand which\r\n     stimulated a home manufacture of coffee-pots, a new departure is\r\n     apparent. The undulating outlines beloved by the Orientals, bowed\r\n     as their scimitars, curvilinear as their graceful flowing script,\r\n     do not commend themselves to the more severe Western taste of the\r\n     period which had then declared its preference for sweet simplicity\r\n     in silversmiths' work, such as we see in the basons, cups, and\r\n     especially the flat-topped tankards of that day. The beauty of the\r\n     straight line had asserted its power, and fashion felt its sway.\r\n     Such was the feeling that produced the coffee-pot of 1692, the\r\n     straight lines of which continued in vogue until the middle of the\r\n     following century, when a reaction in favour of bulbous bodies and\r\n     serpentine spouts set in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASTELL POT, 1720-21]\r\n\r\nSome of the more notable of the coffee-house-keepers' tokens in the\r\nGuildhall Museum were photographed for this work. They are described and\r\nillustrated in chapter X.\r\n\r\nThere are illustrated other silver coffee pots in the Victoria and\r\nAlbert Museum, by Folkingham (1715-16), and by Wastell (1720-21), the\r\nlatter pot being octagonal.\r\n\r\nThere is illustrated also a design in tiles that were let into the wall\r\nof an ancient coffee house in Brick Lane, Spitalfields, known as the\r\n\"Dish of Coffee Boy\" in the catalog of the collection of London\r\nantiquities in the Guildhall Museum. Mr. Ellis thinks this belongs to a\r\nperiod a little earlier, but certainly not later, than 1692; the coffee\r\npot represented being exactly of the lantern shape. It is an oblong sign\r\nof glazed Delft tiles, decorated in blue, brown, and yellow,\r\nrepresenting a youth pouring coffee. Upon a table, by his side, are a\r\ngazette, two pipes, a bowl, a bottle, and a mug; above, on a scroll, is,\r\n\"dish of coffee boy.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"DISH OF COFFEE BOY\" DESIGN IN DELFT TILES 1692]\r\n\r\nModifications of the lantern began to appear with great rapidity in\r\nEngland. In the coffee pot of Chinese porcelain, illustrated, probably\r\nmade in China from an English model a few years later than the 1692 pot,\r\nMr. Ellis observes that \"the spout has already lost its straightness,\r\nthe extreme taper of the body is diminished, and the lid betrays the\r\nfirst tendency to depart from the straightness of the cone to the curved\r\noutline of the dome.\" He adds:\r\n\r\n     These variations rapidly intensified, and at the commencement of\r\n     the eighteenth century we find the body still less tapering and the\r\n     lid has become a perfect dome. As we approach the end of Queen\r\n     Anne's reign the thumb piece disappears and the handle is no longer\r\n     set on at right angles to the spout. Through the reign of George I\r\n     but little modification took place, save that the taper of the body\r\n     became less and less. In the Second George's time we find the\r\n     taper has almost entirely disappeared, so that the sides are\r\n     nearly parallel, while the dome of the lid has been flattened down\r\n     to a very low elevation above the rim. In the second quarter of the\r\n     eighteenth century the pear shaped coffee pot was the vogue. In the\r\n     earlier years of George III, when many new and beautiful designs in\r\n     silversmiths' work were created, a complete revolution in\r\n     coffee-pots takes place, and the flowing outlines of the new\r\n     pattern recall the form of the Turkish ewer, which had been\r\n     discarded nearly one hundred years previously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHINESE PORCELAIN COFFEE POT\r\n\r\nLate seventeenth century]\r\n\r\nThe evolution is shown by illustrations of Lord Swaythling's pot of\r\n1731; the coffee jug of 1736; the Vincent pot of 1738; the Viscountess\r\nWolseley's coffee pot of copper plated with silver; the Irish coffee pot\r\nof 1760; and the silver coffee pots of 1773-76 and of 1779-80 (see\r\nillustrations on pages 604, 605 and 607).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vincent Pot, Hall-marked, London, 1738\r\n\r\nLord Swaythling's Pot, 1731\r\n\r\nSILVER COFFEE POTS, EARLY EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\nFrom Jackson's \"Illustrated History of English Plate\"]\r\n\r\nThere are illustrated in this connection specimens of coffee pots in\r\nstoneware by Elers (1700), and in salt glaze by Astbury, and another of\r\nthe period about 1725.

Right, 1773-4.]\r\n\r\nSilver tea pots and coffee pots were few in America before the middle of\r\nthe eighteenth century. Early coffee-pot examples were tapering and\r\ncylindrical in form, and later matched the tea pots with swelling drums,\r\nmolded bases, decorated spouts, and molded lids with finials.\r\n\r\nFrom notes by R.T. Haines Halsey and John H. Buck, collected by Florence\r\nN. Levy and woven into an introduction to the Metropolitan Museum's art\r\nexhibition catalog for the Hudson-Fulton celebration of 1909, we learn\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n     The first silver made in New England was probably fashioned by\r\n     English or Scotch emigrants who had served their time abroad. They\r\n     were followed by craftsmen who were either born here, or, like John\r\n     Hull, arriving at an early age, learned their trade on this side.\r\n\r\n     In England it was required that every master goldsmith should have\r\n     his mark and set it upon his work after it was assayed and marked\r\n     with the king's mark (hall-mark) testifying to the fineness of the\r\n     metal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sino-Lowestoft, Eighteenth To Nineteenth Centuries]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ITALIAN CAPODIMONTE, EIGHTEENTH CENTURY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA SEINE, 1774\r\n\r\nSÈVRES, 1792\r\n\r\nGERMAN POTS, EIGHTEENTH CENTURY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORCELAIN POTS IN THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM, NEW YORK]\r\n\r\n     The Colonial silversmiths marked their wares with their initials,\r\n     with or without emblems, placed in shields, circles, etc., without\r\n     any guide as to place of manufacture or date. After about 1725 it\r\n     was the custom to use the surname, with or without an initial, and\r\n     sometimes the full name. Since the establishment of the United\r\n     States the name of the town was often added and also the letters D\r\n     or C in a circle, probably meaning dollar or coin, showing the\r\n     standard or coin from which the wares were made.\r\n\r\nIn the New York colony there were evolved silver tea pots of a unique\r\ndesign, that was not used elsewhere in the colonies. Mr. Halsey says\r\nthey were used indiscriminately for both tea and coffee. In style they\r\nfollowed, to a certain extent, the squat pear-shaped tea pots of the\r\nperiod of 1717-18 in England, but had greater height and capacity.\r\n\r\nThe colonial silversmiths wrought many beautiful designs in coffee, tea,\r\nand chocolate pots. Fine specimens are to be seen in the Halsey and\r\nClearwater loan collections in the Metropolitan Museum. Included in the\r\nClearwater collection is a coffee pot by Pygan Adams (1712-1776); and\r\nrecently, there was added a coffee pot by Ephraim Brasher, whose name\r\nappears in the _New York City Directory_ from 1786 to 1805. He was a\r\nmember of the Gold and Silversmiths' Society, and he made the die for\r\nthe famous gold doubloon, known by his name, a specimen of which\r\nrecently sold in Philadelphia for $4,000. His brother, Abraham Brasher,\r\nwho was an officer in the continental army, wrote many popular ballads\r\nof the Revolutionary period, and was a constant contributor to the\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIENNA COFFEE POT, 1830\r\n\r\nIn the Metropolitan Museum of Art]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPANISH COFFEE POT, EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\nIn the Metropolitan Museum]\r\n\r\nJudge Clearwater's collection of colonial silver in the Metropolitan\r\nMuseum, to which he is constantly adding, is a magnificent one; and the\r\ncoffee pot is worthy of it. It is thirteen and one-half inches high,\r\nweighs forty-four ounces, exclusive of the ebony handle, has a curved\r\nbody and splayed base, with a godrooned band to the base and a similar\r\nedge to the cover. The spout is elaborate and curved; the cover has an\r\nurn-shaped finial; and there is a decoration of an engraved medallion\r\nsurrounded by a wreath with a ribbon forming a true lover's knot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nBy Samuel Minott     By Charles Hatfield             By Pygan Adams\r\nHalsey Collection    Metropolitan Museum of Art      Clearwater Collection\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nLondon Pot, 1773-74       By Jacob Hurd          By Paul Revere\r\nFROM FRANCIS HILL BIGELOW'S \"HISTORIC SILVER OF THE COLONIES\"\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENGLISH SHEFFIELD PLATE COFFEE POTS AND COFFEE URN,\r\nEIGHTEENTH CENTURY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILVER COFFEE POTS IN AMERICAN COLLECTIONS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE POT BY WM.

Of all the American silversmiths, Paul\r\nRevere was the most interesting. Not only was he a silversmith of\r\nrenown, but a patriot, soldier, grand master Mason, confidential agent\r\nof the state of Massachusetts Bay, engraver, picture-frame designer, and\r\ndie-sinker. He was born in Boston in 1735, and died in 1818. He was the\r\nmost famous of all the Boston silversmiths, although he is more widely\r\nknown as a patriot. He was the third of a family of twelve children, and\r\nearly entered his father's shop. When only nineteen, his father died;\r\nbut he was able to carry on the business. The engraving on his silver\r\nbears witness to his ability. He engraved also on copper, and made many\r\npolitical cartoons. He joined the expedition against the French at Crown\r\nPoint, and in the war of the Revolution was a lieutenant-colonel of\r\nartillery. After the close of the war, he resumed his business of a\r\ngoldsmith and silversmith in 1783. Decidedly a man of action, he well\r\nplayed many parts; and in all his manifold undertakings achieved\r\nbrilliant success. There clings, therefore, to the articles of silver\r\nmade by him an element of romantic and patriotic association which\r\nendears them to those who possess them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRENCH SILVER COFFEE POT\r\n\r\nGrand Prize, Union Centrale, 1886.]\r\n\r\nRevere had a real talent that enabled him to impart an unwonted elegance\r\nto his work, and he was famous as an engraver of the beautiful crests,\r\narmorial designs, and floral wreaths that adorn much of his work. His\r\ntea pots and coffee pots are unusually beautiful.\r\n\r\nRevere coffee pots are to be seen in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts as\r\nwell as in the Metropolitan Museum in New York. The Boston Museum of\r\nFine Arts has also a coffee pot made by William Shaw and William Priest\r\nin 1751-52 for Peter Faneuil, the wealthiest Bostonian of his time, who\r\ngave to Boston Faneuil Hall, New England's cradle of American liberty.\r\n\r\nAmong other American silversmiths who produced striking designs in\r\ncoffee pots, mention should be made of G. Aiken (1815); Garrett Eoff\r\n(New York, 1785-1850); Charles Faris (who worked in Boston about 1790);\r\nJacob Hurd (1702-1758, known in Boston as Captain Hurd); John McMullin\r\n(mentioned in the Philadelphia _Directory_ for 1796); James Musgrave\r\n(mentioned in Philadelphia directories of 1797, 1808, and 1811); Myer\r\nMyers (admitted as freeman, New York, 1746; active until 1790; president\r\nof the New York Silversmiths Society, 1786); and Anthony Rasch (who is\r\nknown to have worked in Philadelphia, 1815).\r\n\r\nIn the museums of the many historical societies throughout the United\r\nStates are to be seen interesting specimens of coffee pots in pewter,\r\nBritannia metal, and tin ware, as well as in pottery, porcelain, and\r\nsilver. Some of these are illustrated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREEN DRAGON TAVERN COFFEE URN]\r\n\r\nAs in other branches of art during the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies, the United States were indebted to England, Holland, and\r\nFrance for much of the early pottery and porcelain. Elers, Astbury,\r\nWhieldon, Wedgwood, their imitators, and the later Staffordshire\r\npotters, flooded the American market with their wares. Porcelain was not\r\nmade in this country previous to the nineteenth century. Decorative\r\npottery was made here, however, from an early period. Britannia ware\r\nbegan to take the place of pewter in 1825; and the introduction of\r\njapanned tin ware and pottery gradually caused the manufacture of pewter\r\nto be abandoned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nBy an unknown silversmith     By Paul Revere        By Paul Revere\r\n\r\nCOFFEE POTS BY AMERICAN SILVERSMITHS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWENTIETH-CENTURY AMERICAN COFFEE SERVICE\r\n\r\nThe Portsmouth Pattern, by the Gorham Co.]\r\n\r\nAn interesting relic is in the collection of the Bostonian Society. It\r\nis a coffee urn of Sheffield ware, formerly in the Green Dragon tavern,\r\nwhich stood on Union Street from 1697 to 1832, and was a famous meeting\r\nplace of the patriots of the Revolution. It is globular in form, and\r\nrests on a base; and inside is still to be seen the cylindrical piece of\r\niron which, when heated, kept the delectable liquid contents of the urn\r\nhot until imbibed by the frequenters of the tavern. The iron bar was set\r\nin a zinc or tin jacket to keep such fireplace ashes as still clung to\r\nit from coming in contact with the coffee, which was probably brewed in\r\na stew kettle before being poured into the urn for serving. The Green\r\nDragon tavern site, now occupied by a business structure, is owned by\r\nthe St. Andrew's Lodge of Freemasons of Boston; and at a recent\r\ngathering of the lodge on St. Andrew's Day, the urn was exhibited to the\r\nassembled brethren.\r\n\r\nWhen the contents of the tavern were sold, the urn was bought by Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Harrington, who then kept a famous boarding-house on Pearl\r\nStreet, in a building owned by the Quincy family. The house was razed in\r\n1847, and was replaced by the Quincy Block; and Mrs. Harrington removed\r\nto High Street, and from there to Chauncey Place. Some of the prominent\r\nmen of Boston boarded with her for many years. At her death, the urn was\r\ngiven to her daughter, Mrs. John R. Bradford. It was presented to the\r\nsociety by Miss Phebe C. Bradford, of Boston, granddaughter of Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Harrington.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar urn, made of pewter, is in the Museum of the Maine\r\nHistorical Society of Portland, Me.; another in the Museum of the Essex\r\nInstitute at Salem, Mass.\r\n\r\nAmong the many treasured relics of Abraham Lincoln is an old Britannia\r\ncoffee pot from which he was regularly served while a boarder with the\r\nRutledge family at the Rutledge inn in New Salem (now Menard), Ill. It\r\nwas a valued utensil, and Lincoln is said to have been very fond of it.\r\nIt is illustrated on page 690.\r\n\r\nThe pot is now the property of the Old Salem Lincoln League, of\r\nPetersburg, Ill., and was donated to it, with other relics, by Mrs.\r\nSaunders, of Sisquoc, Cal., the only surviving child of James and Mary\r\nAnn Rutledge. Mrs. Rutledge carefully preserved this and other relics of\r\nNew Salem days; and shortly before her death in 1878, she gave them into\r\nthe keeping of her daughter, Mrs. Saunders, advising her to preserve\r\nthem until such time as a permanent home for them would be provided by a\r\ngrateful people back at New Salem, where they were associated with the\r\nimmortal Lincoln and his tragic romance with her daughter Ann.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURKISH COFFEE SET, PETER COLLECTION, UNITED STATES\r\nNATIONAL MUSEUM, WASHINGTON]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nTHE EVOLUTION OF COFFEE APPARATUS\r\n\r\n     _Showing the development of coffee-roasting, coffee-grinding,\r\n     coffee-making, and coffee-serving devices from the earliest time to\r\n     the present day--The original coffee grinder, the first coffee\r\n     roaster, and the first coffee pot--The original French drip pot,\r\n     the De Belloy percolator--Count Rumford's improvement--How the\r\n     commercial coffee roaster was developed--The evolution of\r\n     filtration devices--The old Carter \"pull-out\" roaster--Trade\r\n     customs in New York and St. Louis in the sixties and seventies--The\r\n     story of the evolution of the Burns roaster--How the gas roaster\r\n     was developed in France, Great Britain, and the United States_\r\n\r\n\r\nA book could be written on the subject of this chapter. We shall have to\r\nbe content to touch briefly upon the important developments in the\r\ndevices employed. The changes that have taken place in the preparation\r\nof the drink itself will be discussed in chapter XXXVI.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, that is, in Ethiopia, about 800 A.D., coffee was\r\nlooked upon as a food. The whole ripe berries, beans and hulls, were\r\ncrushed, and molded into food balls held in shape with fat. Later, the\r\ndried berries were so treated. So the primitive stone mortar and pestle\r\nwere the original coffee grinder.\r\n\r\nThe dried hulls and the green beans were first roasted, some time\r\nbetween 1200 and 1300, in crude burnt clay dishes or in stone vessels,\r\nover open fires. These were the original roasting utensils.\r\n\r\nNext, the coffee beans were ground between little mill-stones, one\r\nturning above the other. Then came the mill used by the Greeks and\r\nRomans for grain. This mill consisted of two conical mill stones, one\r\nhollow and fitted over the other, specimens of which have been found in\r\nPompeii. The idea is the same as that employed in the most modern metal\r\ngrinder.\r\n\r\nBetween 1400 and 1500, individual earthenware and metal coffee-roasting\r\nplates appeared. These were circular, from four to six inches in\r\ndiameter, about 1/16 inch thick, slightly concave and pierced with small\r\nholes, something like the modern kitchen skimmer. They were used in\r\nTurkey and Persia for roasting a few beans at a time over braziers (open\r\npans, or basins, for holding live coals). The braziers were usually\r\nmounted on feet and richly ornamented.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time we notice the first appearance of the familiar\r\nTurkish pocket cylinder coffee mill and the original Turkish _ibrik_, or\r\ncoffee boiler, made of metal. Little drinking cups of Chinese porcelain\r\ncompleted the service.\r\n\r\nThe original coffee boiler was not unlike the English ale mug with no\r\ncover, smaller at the top than at the bottom, fitted with a grooved lip\r\nfor pouring, and a long straight handle. They were made of brass, and in\r\nsizes to hold from one to six tiny cupfuls. A later improvement was of\r\nthe ewer design, with bulbous body, collar top, and cover.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish coffee grinder seems to have suggested the individual\r\ncylinder roaster which later (1650) became common, and from which\r\ndeveloped the huge modern cylinder commercial roasting machines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLDEST COFFEE GRINDER\r\n\r\nAncient Egyptian mortar and pestle, probably used for pounding coffee]\r\n\r\nThe individual coffee service of early civilization first employed crude\r\nclay bowls or dishes for drinking; but as early as 1350, Persian,\r\nEgyptian, and Turkish ewers, made of pottery, were used for serving. In\r\nthe seventeenth century, ewers of similar pattern, but made of metal,\r\nwere the favorite coffee-serving devices in oriental countries and in\r\nwestern Europe.\r\n\r\nBetween 1428 and 1448, a spice grinder standing on four legs was\r\ninvented; and this was later used for grinding coffee. The drawer to\r\nreceive the ground coffee was added in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nBetween 1500 and 1600, shallow iron dippers with long handles and\r\nfoot-rests, designed to stand in open fires, were used in Bagdad, and by\r\nthe Arabs in Mesopotamia, for roasting coffee. These roasters had\r\nhandles about thirty-four inches long, and the bowls were eight inches\r\nin diameter. They were accompanied by a metal stirrer (spatula) for\r\nturning the beans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAIN MILL OF GREEKS AND ROMANS\r\n\r\nAlso used for grinding coffee]\r\n\r\nAnother type of roaster was developed about 1600. It was in the shape of\r\nan iron spider on legs, and was designed, like that just described, to\r\nsit in open fires. At this period pewter serving pots were first used.\r\n\r\nBetween 1600 and 1632, mortars and pestles of wood, iron, brass, and\r\nbronze came into common use in Europe for braying the roasted beans. For\r\nseveral centuries, coffee connoisseurs held that pounding the beans in a\r\nmortar was superior to grinding in the most efficient mill. Peregrine\r\nWhite's parents brought to America on the _Mayflower_, in 1620, a wooden\r\nmortar and pestle that were used for braying coffee to make coffee\r\n\"powder.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST COFFEE ROASTER, ABOUT 1400]\r\n\r\nWhen La Roque speaks of his father bringing back to Marseilles from\r\nConstantinople in 1644 the instruments for making coffee, he undoubtedly\r\nrefers to the individual devices which at that time in the Orient\r\nincluded the roaster plate, the cylinder grinder, the small long-handled\r\nboiler, and _fenjeyns_ (findjans), the little porcelain drinking cups.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST CYLINDER ROASTER, ABOUT 1650]\r\n\r\nWhen Bernier visited Grand Cairo about the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, in all the city's thousand-odd coffee houses he found but two\r\npersons who understood the art of roasting the bean.\r\n\r\nAbout 1650, there was developed the individual cylinder coffee roaster\r\nmade of metal, usually tin plate or tinned copper, suggested by the\r\noriginal Turkish pocket grinder. This was designed for use over open\r\nfires in braziers. There appeared about this time also a combined\r\nmaking-and-serving metal pot which was undoubtedly the original of the\r\ncommon type of pot that we know today.\r\n\r\nThere appeared in England about 1660, Elford's white iron machine (sheet\r\niron coated with tin) which was \"turned on a spit by a jack.[362]\" This\r\nwas simply a larger size of the individual cylinder roaster, and was\r\ndesigned for family or commercial use. Modifications were developed by\r\nthe French and Dutch. In the seventeenth century the Italians produced\r\nsome beautiful designs in wrought-iron coffee roasters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HISTORICAL RELICS IN THE PETER COLLECTION, UNITED STATES\r\nNATIONAL MUSEUM\r\n\r\n1--Bagdad coffee-roasting pan and stirrer. 2--Iron mortar and pestle\r\nused for pounding coffee. 3--Coffee mill used by General and Mrs.\r\nWashington. 4--Coffee-roasting pan used at Mt. Vernon. 5--Bagdad coffee\r\npot with crow-bill spout]\r\n\r\nBefore the advent of the Elford machine, and indeed, for two centuries\r\nthereafter, it was the common practise in the home to roast coffee in\r\nuncovered earthenware tart dishes, old pudding pans, and fry pans.\r\nBefore the time of the modern kitchen stove, it was usually done over\r\ncharcoal fires without flame.\r\n\r\nThe improved Turkish combination coffee grinder with folding handle and\r\ncup receptacle for the beans, used for grinding, boiling, and drinking,\r\nwas first made in Damascus in 1665. About this period, the Turkish\r\ncoffee set, including the long-handled boiler and the porcelain drinking\r\ncups in brass holders, also came into vogue.\r\n\r\nIn 1665, Nicholas Book, \"living at the Sign of the Frying Pan in St.\r\nTulies street,\" London, advertised that he was \"the only known man for\r\nmaking of mills for grinding of coffee powder, which mills are sold by\r\nhim from forty to forty-five shillings the mill.\"\r\n\r\nBy combining the long-handle idea contained in the Bagdad roaster with\r\nthat of the original cylinder roaster, the Dutch perfected a small,\r\nclosed, sheet-iron cylinder-roaster with a long handle that permitted\r\nits being held and turned in open fire places. From 1670, and well into\r\nthe middle of the nineteenth century, this type of family roaster\r\nenjoyed great favor in Holland, France, England, and the United States,\r\nmore especially in the country districts. The museums of Europe and the\r\nUnited States contain many specimens. The iron cylinder measured about\r\nfive inches in diameter, and was from six to eight inches long, being\r\nattached to a three or four foot iron rod provided with a wooden handle.\r\nThe green coffee was put into the cylinder through a sliding door.\r\nBalancing the roaster over the blaze by resting the end of the iron rod\r\nprojecting from the far end of the roasting cylinder in a hook of the\r\nusual fireplace crane, the housekeeper was wont slowly to revolve the\r\ncylinder until the beans had turned the proper color.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURKISH COFFEE MILL\r\n\r\nA fine specimen in the Peter collection, United States National Museum]\r\n\r\nPortable coffee-making outfits to fit the pocket were much in vogue in\r\nFrance in 1691. These included a roaster, a grinder, a lamp, the oil,\r\ncups, saucers, spoons, coffee, and sugar. The roaster was first made of\r\ntin plate or tinned copper; but for the aristocracy silver and gold were\r\nused. In 1754, a white-silver coffee roaster eight inches long and four\r\ninches in diameter was mentioned among the deliveries made to the army\r\nof the king at Versailles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY FRENCH WALL AND TABLE GRINDERS\r\n\r\nLeft, seventeenth-century coffee grinder in the Musée de la Porte de\r\nHal--Center, wall mill, eighteenth century--Right, iron mill, eighteenth\r\ncentury]\r\n\r\nHumphrey Broadbent, \"the London coffee man\" wrote in 1722:\r\n\r\n     I hold it best to roast coffee berries in an iron vessel full of\r\n     little holes, made to turn on a spit over a charcoal fire, keeping\r\n     them continually turning, and sometimes shaking them that they do\r\n     not burn, and when they are taken out of the vessel, spread 'em on\r\n     some tin or iron plate 'till the vehemency of the heat is vanished;\r\n     I would recommend to every family to roast their own coffee, for\r\n     then they will be almost secure from having any damaged berries, or\r\n     any art to increase the weight, which is very injurious to the\r\n     drinkers of coffee. Most persons of distinction in Holland roast\r\n     their own berries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRONZE AND BRASS MORTARS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY USED\r\nFOR MAKING COFFEE POWDER\r\n\r\nLeft, bronze (Germany)--Center, brass (England)--Right, bronze (Holland,\r\n1632)]\r\n\r\nBetween 1700 and 1800, there was developed a type of small portable\r\nhousehold stove to burn coke or charcoal, made of iron and fitted with\r\nhorizontal revolving cylinders for coffee roasting. These were provided\r\nwith iron handles for turning. A modification of this type of roaster\r\nunder a three-sided hood, and standing on three legs, was designed to\r\nsit on the hearth of open fireplaces, close to the fire or in the\r\nsmoldering ashes. Because of its greater capacity, it was probably used\r\nin the inns and coffee houses for roasting large batches. Still another\r\ntype, which made its appearance late in the eighteenth century, was the\r\nsheet-iron roaster suspended at the top of a tall, iron, box-like\r\ncompartment, or stove, in which the fire was built. This, too, was\r\ndesigned to roast coffee in comparatively large quantities. In some\r\nexamples it was provided with legs.\r\n\r\nGreat silver coffee pots (\"with all the utensils belonging to them of\r\nthe same metal\") were first used by Pascal at St.-Germain's fair in\r\nParis in 1672. It remained for the English and American silversmiths to\r\nproduce the most beautiful forms of silver coffee pots; and there are\r\nsome notable collections of these in England and the United States.\r\n\r\nThe oriental serving pot was nearly always of metal, tall, and, in old\r\nmodels, of graceful curve, with a slightly twisted ornamental beak in\r\nthe form of an S, attached below the middle of the vessel. A handle\r\nornamented in the same way formed a decorative balance.\r\n\r\nIn 1692, the lantern straight-line coffee serving pot with true cone\r\nlid, thumb-piece, and handle fixed at right angle to the spout, was\r\nintroduced into England, succeeding the curved oriental serving pot. In\r\n1700, coffee pots made of cheaper metals, like tin and Britannia ware,\r\nbegan to appear on the home tables of the people. In 1701, silver coffee\r\npots appeared in England having perfect domes and bodies less tapering.\r\nBetween 1700 and 1800, silver, gold, and delicate porcelain serving pots\r\nwere the vogue among European royalty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY AMERICAN COFFEE ROASTERS\r\n\r\nBoth the cast-iron spiders and the long-handled roasters were used in\r\nopen fireplaces previous to 1770]\r\n\r\nIn 1704, Bull's machine for roasting coffee was patented in England.\r\nThis probably marks the first use of coal for commercial roasting.\r\n\r\nIn 1710, the popular coffee roaster in French homes was a dish of\r\nvarnished earthenware. This same year a novelty was introduced in France\r\nin the shape of a fustian (linen) bag for infusing ground coffee.\r\n\r\nBy 1714, the thumb-piece on English serving pots had disappeared, and\r\nthe handle was no longer set at a right angle to the spout. English\r\ncoffee-pot bodies showed a further modification in 1725, the taper\r\nbecoming less and less.\r\n\r\nCoffee grinders were so common in France in 1720 that they were to be\r\nhad for a dollar and twenty cents each. Their development by the French\r\nhad been rapid from the original spice grinder. At first, they were\r\nknown as coffee mills; but in the eighteenth century, roasters came to\r\nbe known by that name. They were made of iron, retaining the same\r\nprinciple of the horizontal mill-stones--one of which is fixed while the\r\nother moves--that the ancients employed for grinding wheat. They were\r\nsquat, box-shaped affairs, having in the center a shank of iron that\r\nrevolved upon a fixed, corrugated iron plate. There was also the style\r\nthat fastened to the wall. At first, the drawer to receive ground coffee\r\nwas missing, but this was supplied in later types. Before its invention,\r\nthe ground coffee was received in a sack of greased leather, or in one\r\ntreated on the outside with beeswax--probably the original of the duplex\r\npaper bag for conserving the flavor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROASTER WITH THREE-SIDED HOOD\r\n\r\nIt succeeded the cast-iron spider, and was suspended from a crane, or\r\nstood in the embers]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROASTING, MAKING, AND SERVING DEVICES\r\n\r\nEarly seventeenth century, as pictured by Dufour]\r\n\r\nThe French brought their innate artistic talents to bear upon coffee\r\ngrinders, just as they did upon roasters and serving pots. In many\r\ninstances they made the outer parts of silver and of gold.\r\n\r\nBy 1750, the straight-line serving pot in England had begun to yield to\r\nthe reactionary movement in art favoring bulbous bodies and serpentine\r\nspouts.\r\n\r\nAbout 1760, French inventors began to devote themselves to improvements\r\nin coffee-making devices. Donmartin, a Paris tinsmith, in 1763, invented\r\nan urn pot that employed a flannel sack for infusing. Another infusion\r\ndevice, produced the same year by L'Ainé, also a tinsmith of Paris, was\r\nknown as a _diligence_.\r\n\r\nA complete revolution in the style of English serving pots took place in\r\n1770, with a return to the flowing lines of the Turkish ewer; and\r\nbetween 1800 and 1900, there was a gradual return to the style of\r\nserving pot having the handle at a right angle to the spout.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENGLISH AND FRENCH COFFEE GRINDERS\r\n\r\nNineteenth century]\r\n\r\nIn 1779, Richard Dearman was granted an English patent on a new method\r\nof making mills for grinding coffee. In 1798, the first American patent\r\non an improved coffee grinding mill was granted to Thomas Bruff, Sr. It\r\nwas a wall mill, fitted with iron plates, in which the coffee was ground\r\nbetween two circular nuts, three inches broad and having coarse teeth\r\naround their centers and fine shallow teeth at the edges.\r\n\r\nDe Belloy's (or Du Belloy's) coffee pot appeared in Paris about 1800. It\r\nwas first made of tin; but later, of porcelain and silver--the original\r\nFrench drip pot. This device was never patented; but it appears to have\r\nfurnished the inspiration for many inventors in France, England, and the\r\nUnited States. The first French patent on a coffee maker was granted to\r\nDenobe, Henrion, and Rouch in 1802. It was for a\r\n\"pharmacological-chemical coffee-making device by infusion.\" Charles\r\nWyatt obtained a patent the same year in London on an apparatus for\r\ndistilling coffee. The De Belloy pot is illustrated on page 622.\r\n\r\nIn 1806, Hadrot was granted a French patent on a device \"for filtering\r\ncoffee without boiling and bathed in air.\" This use of the word\r\nfiltering was misleading, as it was many times after in French, English,\r\nand American patent nomenclature, where it often meant percolation or\r\nsomething quite different from filtration. True percolation means to\r\ndrip through fine interstices of china or metal. Filtration means to\r\ndrip through a porous substance, usually cloth or paper. De Belloy's pot\r\nwas a percolator. So was Hadrot's. The improvement on which Hadrot got\r\nhis patent was to \"replace the white iron filter (sic) used in ordinary\r\nfiltering pots by a filter composed of hard tin and bismuth\" and to use\r\n\"a rammer of the same metal, pierced with holes.\" The rammer was\r\ndesigned to press down and to smooth out the powdered coffee in an even\r\nand uniform fashion. \"It also,\" says Hadrot in his specification, \"stops\r\nthe derangement which boiling water poured from a height can produce. It\r\nis held by its stem a half inch from the surface of the powder so that\r\nit receives only the action of the water which it divides and\r\nfacilitates thus the extraction which it must produce in each of the\r\nparticles.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ROASTER\r\n\r\nEssex Institute, Salem, Mass.]\r\n\r\nA coffee percolator was invented in Paris about 1806 by Benjamin\r\nThompson, F.R.S., an American-British scientist, philanthropist, and\r\nadministrator. He was known as Count Rumford, a title bestowed on him by\r\nthe Pope. Rumford's invention was first given to the public in London in\r\n1812. He has gained great credit for his device, because of an elaborate\r\nessay that he wrote on it in Paris under the title of _The excellent\r\nqualities of coffee and the art of making it in the highest perfection_,\r\nand that he caused to be published in London in 1812. It was a simple\r\npercolator pot provided with a hot-water jacket, and was a real\r\nimprovement on the French drip or percolator coffee pot invented by De\r\nBelloy, but not at all unlike Hadrot's patented device. Count Rumford,\r\nhowever, was a picturesque character, and a good advertiser. He is\r\ngenerally credited with the invention of the coffee percolator; but\r\nexamination of his device shows that, strictly speaking, the De Belloy\r\npot was just as much a percolator, and apparently antedated it by about\r\nsix years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ORIGINAL FRENCH DRIP POT\r\n\r\n_Cafetière à la_ De Belloy]\r\n\r\nDe Belloy employed the principle of having the boiling water drip\r\nthrough the ground coffee when held in suspension by a perforated metal\r\nor porcelain grid. This is true percolation. Hadrot did the same thing\r\nwith the improvements noted above. Count Rumford in his essay admits\r\nthat this method of making coffee was not new, but claims his\r\nimprovement was. This was to provide a rammer for compressing the ground\r\ncoffee in the upper or percolating device into a definite thickness,\r\nthis being accomplished by providing the perforated circular tin disk\r\nwater-spreader that rested on the ground coffee with four projections,\r\nor feet, that kept the spreader within half an inch of the grid holding\r\nthe powder in suspension and free from \"agitation.\"\r\n\r\nHis argument was that two-thirds of an inch of ground coffee should be\r\nleveled and compressed into a half-inch thickness before the boiling\r\nwater was introduced. Practically the same result was achieved in the De\r\nBelloy and Hadrot pots, also provided with water-spreaders and pluggers,\r\nbut the same mathematical exactitude in the matter of the depth of the\r\nground coffee before the percolation started was not assured. De\r\nBelloy's spreader did not have the projections on the under side upon\r\nwhich Count Rumford laid such stress. Then there was the hot-water\r\njacket, which was an improvement on Hadrot's hot air bath. Inventors\r\nthat followed Rumford have made light of the importance that he attached\r\nto scientific accuracy in coffee-making; but it is interesting to note\r\nhow many of the features of the De Belloy, Hadrot, and Rumford pots have\r\nbeen retained in the modern complex coffee machines, and in most of the\r\nfiltration devices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BELGIAN, RUSSIAN, AND FRENCH PEWTER SERVING POTS\r\n\r\nThese are in the Metropolitan Museum and are of nineteenth century\r\ndesign]\r\n\r\nFrench inventors continued to apply themselves to coffee-roasting and\r\ncoffee-making problems, and many new ideas were evolved. Some of these\r\nwere improved upon by the Dutch, the Germans, and the Italians; but the\r\nbest work in the line of improvements that have survived the test of\r\ntime was done in England and the United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1815, Sené was granted a French patent on \"a device to make coffee\r\nwithout boiling.\" In 1819, Laurens produced the original of the\r\npercolation device in which the boiling water is raised by a tube and\r\nsprayed over the ground coffee. The same year Morize, a Paris tinsmith\r\nand lamp-maker, followed with a reversible, double drip pot which was\r\nthe pioneer of all the reversible filtration pots of Europe and America.\r\nGaudet, another tinsmith, in 1820, patented an improvement on the\r\npercolator idea, that employed a cloth filter. By 1825, the pumping\r\npercolator, working by steam pressure and by partial vacuum, was much\r\nused in France, Holland, Germany, and Austria.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, it was common practise to roast coffee in England in \"an iron\r\npan or in hollow cylinders made of sheet iron\"; while in Italy, the\r\npractise was to roast it in glass flasks, which were fitted with loose\r\ncorks. The flasks were \"held over clear fires of burning coals and\r\ncontinually agitated.\" Anthony Schick was granted an English patent in\r\n1812, on a method, or process, for roasting coffee; but as he never\r\nfiled his specifications, we shall probably never know what the process\r\nwas. The custom of the day in England was to pound the roasted beans in\r\na mortar, or to grind them in a French mill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COUNT RUMFORD'S PERCOLATOR]\r\n\r\nIn 1822, Louis Bernard Rabaut was granted an English patent in which the\r\nFrench drip process was reversed by using steam pressure to force the\r\nboiling water upward through the coffee mass. Casseneuve, a Paris\r\ntinsmith, seems to have patented practically the same idea in France in\r\n1824. Casseneuve employed a paper filter in his machine.\r\n\r\nIn America, a United States patent was granted in 1813 to Alexander\r\nDuncan Moore of New Haven on a mill \"for grinding and pounding coffee.\"\r\nThis was followed by a patent granted to Increase Wilson, of New London,\r\nin 1818, on a steel mill for grinding coffee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEWTER POTS OF THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES\r\n\r\nLeft to right, they are German, Flemish, English, and Dutch specimens in\r\nthe Metropolitan Museum]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PATENT DRAWINGS OF EARLY FRENCH COFFEE MAKERS\r\n\r\nLeft, drip pot of 1806--Next two, Durant's inner-tube pot, 1827--Next\r\n(fourth), Gandais' first practicable percolator, 1827--Right, Grandin &\r\nCrepeaux' percolator, 1832]\r\n\r\nIn 1815, Archibald Kenrich was granted a patent in England on \"mills for\r\ngrinding coffee.\"\r\n\r\nThe coffee biggin, said to have been invented by a Mr. Biggin, came into\r\ncommon use in England for making coffee about 1817. It was usually an\r\nearthenware pot. At first it had in the upper part a metal strainer like\r\nthe French drip pots. Suspended from the rim in later models there was a\r\nflannel or muslin bag to hold the ground coffee, through which the\r\nboiling water was poured, the bag serving as a filter. The idea was an\r\nadaptation of the French fustian infusion bag of 1711, and of other\r\nearly French drip and filtration devices, and it attained great\r\npopularity. Any coffee pot with such a bag fitted into its mouth came to\r\nbe spoken of as a coffee biggin. Later, there was evolved the metal pot\r\nwith a wire strainer substituted for the cloth bag. The coffee biggin\r\nstill retains its popularity in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY FRENCH FILTRATION DEVICES\r\n\r\nLeft, Casseneuve's filter-paper machine, 1824--Center, Gaudet's\r\ncloth-filter pot, 1820--Right, Raparlier's percolator]\r\n\r\nWhile French inventors were busy with coffee makers, English and\r\nAmerican inventors were studying means to improve the roasting of the\r\nbeans. Peregrine Williamson, of Baltimore, was granted the first patent\r\nin the United States for an improvement on a coffee roaster in 1820. In\r\n1824, Richard Evans was granted a patent in England for a commercial\r\nmethod of roasting coffee, comprising a cylindrical sheet-iron roaster\r\nfitted with improved flanges for mixing; a hollow tube and trier for\r\nsampling coffee while roasting; and a means for turning the roaster\r\ncompletely over to empty it.\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1825, the first coffee-pot patent in the United States\r\nwas granted to Lewis Martelley of New York. It marked the first American\r\nattempt to perfect an arrangement to condense the steam and the\r\nessential oils and to return them to the infusion. In 1838, Antoni\r\nBencini, of Milton, N.C., was granted a similar patent in the United\r\nStates. Rowland, in 1844, and Waite and Sener, in their Old Dominion pot\r\nof 1856, tried for the same result, namely, the condensation of the\r\nsteam in upper chambers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY AMERICAN COFFEE-MAKER PATENTS\r\n\r\nLeft, Waite & Sener's Old Dominion pot--Right, Bencini's steam\r\ncondenser]\r\n\r\nThe French meantime focused on coffee makers; and in 1827, Jacques\r\nAugustin Gandais, a manufacturer of plated jewelry in Paris, produced a\r\nreally practicable pumping percolator. This machine had the ascending\r\nsteam tube on the exterior. The same year, 1827, Nicholas Felix Durant,\r\na manufacturer in Chalons-sur-Marne, was granted a French patent on a\r\npercolator employing for the first time an inner tube for spraying the\r\nboiling water over the ground coffee.\r\n\r\nIn 1828, Charles Parker, of Meriden, Conn., began work on the original\r\nParker coffee mill, which later was to bring him fame and fortune.\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1829, the first French patent on a coffee mill was issued\r\nto Colaux & Cie. of Molsheim.\r\n\r\nThat same year, 1829, the Établissements Lauzaune, Paris, began to make\r\nhand-turned iron-cylinder coffee-roasting machines.\r\n\r\nIn 1831, David Selden was granted a patent in England for a\r\ncoffee-grinding mill having cones of cast-iron.\r\n\r\nThe first Parker coffee-grinder patent for a household coffee and spice\r\nmill was issued in the United States in 1832 to Edmund Parker and Herman\r\nM. White of Meriden, Conn. The Charles Parker Company's business was\r\nfounded the same year. In 1832 and 1833, United States patents were\r\nissued to Ammi Clark, of Berlin, Conn., also on improved coffee and\r\nspice mills for home use.\r\n\r\nAmos Ransom, Hartford, Conn., was granted a United States patent on a\r\ncoffee roaster in 1833.\r\n\r\nThe English began exporting coffee-roasting and coffee-grinding\r\nmachinery to the United States in 1833-34.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRENCH COFFEE MAKERS, NINETEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n1, 2--Improved French drip pots. 3--Persian design. 4--De Belloy pot.\r\n5--Russian reversible pot. 6--New filter machine. 7--Glass filter pot.\r\n8--Syphon machine. 9--Vienna Incomparable. 10--Double glass \"balloon\"\r\ndevice]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST ENGLISH COMMERCIAL COFFEE-ROASTER PATENT, 1824\r\n\r\nFig. 1--End elevation.

The first French patent on a glass\r\ncoffee-making device, using the same principle, was granted to Madame\r\nVassieux, of Lyons, in 1842. These were the forerunners of the double\r\nglass \"balloons\" for making coffee which later on, in the early part of\r\nthe twentieth century, attained much vogue in the United States. They\r\nwere very popular in Europe until the latter part of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIn 1839, John Rittenhouse, of Philadelphia, was granted a United States\r\npatent on a cast-iron mill designed to handle the problem of nails and\r\nstones in grinding coffee. His improvement was intended to prevent\r\ninjury to the grinding teeth by stopping the machine.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, Abel Stillman, Poland, N.Y., was granted a United States patent\r\non a family coffee roaster having a mica window to enable the operator\r\nto observe the coffee while roasting. (See 10, page 630.)\r\n\r\nIn 1841, William Ward Andrews was granted an English patent on an\r\nimproved coffee pot employing a pump to force the boiling water upward\r\nthrough the coffee, which was contained in a perforated cylinder screwed\r\nto the bottom of the pot. This was Rabaut's idea of nineteen years\r\nbefore. We find it again repeated in the United States in a machine\r\nwhich appeared on the New York market in 1906.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTERY OF CARTER PULL-OUT MACHINES IN AN EARLY AMERICAN\r\nPLANT]\r\n\r\nIn 1841, Claude Marie Victor Bernard, of Paris, was granted a French\r\npatent on a coffee roaster, which was an improvement designed to bring\r\nthe roasting cylinder and the fire in closer contact. This was\r\naccomplished, to quote the quaint language of the inventor, by applying\r\nmovable legs and \"by superimposing a sheet iron circlet around the edge\r\nof the furnace to get double the quantity of heat and it presents so\r\nmuch advantage that it has seemed to me worthy of being patented.\" (See\r\n4, page 627.)\r\n\r\nBut the French were only toying with the roaster, because roasting in\r\nFrance was not yet a separate branch of business, as it had become in\r\nEngland and the United States, where keen minds were already at work on\r\nthe purely commercial coffee-roasting machine. The application of\r\nintensive thought in this direction was destined to bear fruit in\r\nAmerica in 1846, and in England in 1847.\r\n\r\nFrench inventive genius continued to occupy itself with coffee making,\r\nand in the invention of Edward Loysel de Santais, of Paris, in 1843,\r\nproduced the first of the ideas that were later incorporated in the\r\nhydrostatic percolator for making \"two thousand cups of coffee an\r\nhour\"[363] at the exposition of 1855, and that has since been improved\r\nupon by the Italians in their rapid-filter machines. It should be noted\r\nthat Loysel's 2,000 cups were probably demi-tasses. The modern Italian\r\nrapid-filter machine produces about 1,000 large coffee cups per hour.\r\n\r\nJames W. Carter, of Boston, was granted a United States patent in 1846\r\non his \"pull-out\" roaster; and this was the machine most generally\r\nemployed for trade roasting in America for the next twenty years. Carter\r\ndid not claim to have invented the combination of cylindrical roaster\r\nand furnace; but he did claim priority for the combination, with the\r\nfurnace and roasting vessel, of the air space, or chamber, surrounding\r\nit, \"the same being for the purpose of preventing the too rapid escape\r\nof heat from the furnace when the air chamber's induction and eduction\r\nair openings or passages are closed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Carter \"pull-out,\" was so called because the roasting cylinder of\r\nsheet iron was pulled out from the furnace on a shaft supported by\r\nstandards, to be emptied or to be refilled from sliding doors in its\r\n\"sides.\" It was in use for many years in such old-time plants as that of\r\nDwinell-Wright Company, 25 Haverhill Street. Boston; by James H. Forbes\r\nand William Schotten in St. Louis; and by D.Y. Harrison in Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nThe picture of a roasting room with Carter machines in operation,\r\nreproduced here, recalled to George S. Wright, the present head of the\r\nDwinell-Wright Company's business, the scene as he saw it so many times\r\nwhen, as a boy of ten or twelve, he occasionally spent a day in his\r\nfather's factory. \"The only difference I notice,\" he wrote the author,\r\n\"is that, according to my recollection, there was no cooler box to\r\nreceive the roasted coffee, which was dumped on the floor where it was\r\nspread out three or four inches deep with iron rakes and sprinkled with\r\na watering pot. The contact of water and hot coffee caused so much steam\r\nthat the roasting room was in a dense fog for several minutes after each\r\nbatch of coffee was drawn from the fire.\"\r\n\r\nA.E. Forbes also thus recalled the Carter machine in his father's\r\nfactory in St. Louis in 1853, when he used to help after school; and\r\nsometimes ran the roasters, after 1857:\r\n\r\n     It was barrel shaped, having a slide the full length of one side to\r\n     fill and empty. A heavy shaft ran through the centre, resting on\r\n     the wall of the furnace at the rear end and on an upright about\r\n     eight feet from the front wall. The fire was about sixteen to\r\n     eighteen inches below the cylinder and of soft coal. The cylinder\r\n     was not perforated, the theory being to keep the vapors from\r\n     escaping.[364] This of course was erroneous. The color of the smoke\r\n     bursting from the edge of the slide was our medium of telling when\r\n     the roasting process was nearing completion, and often the cylinder\r\n     was pulled out and opened for inspection several times before that\r\n     point was reached. When just right, the belt was shifted to a loose\r\n     pulley, stopping the cylinder, which, was pulled off the fire. A\r\n     handle was attached to the shaft, the slide drawn, and the coffee\r\n     was dumped into a wooden tray which had to be shoved under the\r\n     cylinder. The coffee was stirred around in the tray until cool\r\n     enough to sack.\r\n\r\n     The roaster man had to be a husky in those days to pick up a sack\r\n     of Rio weighing about one hundred, sixty to one hundred,\r\n     seventy-five pounds (not a hundred, thirty-two pounds, as now) and\r\n     to empty it in the cylinder. We had no overhead hoppers.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: EARLY ENGLISH AND AMERICAN COFFEE ROASTERS\r\n\r\n     1, 2--English charcoal machines. 3, 5, 8--American coal-stove\r\n     roasters. 4--Remington's wheel-of-buckets (American) roaster, 1841.\r\n     6--Wood's roaster. 7--Hyde's stove roaster. 9--Reversible stove\r\n     roaster. 10--Abel Stillman's stove roaster]\r\n\r\n     Later we built in the rear and put in two cylinders of the Chris\r\n     Abele type, having stationary fronts and filling and emptying from\r\n     the front end. We still used soft coal, with the fire sixteen to\r\n     eighteen inches under the cylinder.\r\n\r\n     We had other machines made locally from the Carter pattern. The\r\n     idea of the tight cylinder was to keep out smoke, as well as to\r\n     keep in the aroma. I think we were the first to use perforations,\r\n     because I remember old Jabez Burns coming along after we put in one\r\n     of his machines and remarking on it.... We had a kind of mechanical\r\n     genius for engineer at that time (he also did the roasting) and he\r\n     conceived the idea that we ought to get rid of the moisture in the\r\n     roasting coffee because it would cook quicker. When the holes\r\n     clogged up, he put in loose pieces of wire bent at the ends which\r\n     shook as the cylinder revolved and kept the holes open. Another\r\n     thing, he put a hole in the cylinder head and a stopper with a\r\n     string on it so he could get out a few grains at a time to note the\r\n     progress of the roasting--but he judged mostly by the smoke.\r\n\r\n     The cooling box was as I have described it, but later we put in a\r\n     perforated false bottom which let out some chaff and small stones.\r\n\r\n     On our first watering, we pulled out the slide and dashed in a\r\n     bucket of water, then closed the slide and let it revolve outside\r\n     the furnace. This was hard on the cylinder, so later we used the\r\n     sprinkling can and put on water sparingly.\r\n\r\n     Once we had a party that wanted to put in a soapstone lined\r\n     roaster, and another near us named Salzgerber patented a\r\n     superheated-steam roaster which was shaped like our modern milk\r\n     bottle. This was covered with asbestos and worked on a central\r\n     bearing so it could be depressed for emptying and elevated for\r\n     filling. It did good work.\r\n\r\nMr. Forbes' recollections of the early days of roasting and selling\r\ncoffee at retail in St. Louis are so illuminating, and paint so\r\ninteresting a picture of the period that they are printed here to\r\nillustrate the conditions that prevailed generally at the time when the\r\ncommercial roasting machine of the United States was being developed\r\ninto the modern type. He says further:\r\n\r\n     Selling roasted coffee was uphill work, as every one roasted coffee\r\n     in the kitchen oven. People were buying, say, at twenty cents. Our\r\n     asking twenty-five cents \"roasted\" called for a lot of explanation\r\n     about shrinkage, tight cylinders so the strength and flavor could\r\n     not get away, etc.; while, when they roasted a pound in the oven\r\n     the flavor scented the whole house, thus losing so much strength to\r\n     say nothing of the unevenness of their roasts--part raw, part\r\n     roasted, producing an unpleasant taste. An occasional burned roast\r\n     at home helped some. They tell of a man who, going out in the back\r\n     yard and kicking over a clod by accident, uncovered some burned\r\n     coffee. He called to his wife and wanted an explanation. She\r\n     acknowledged she had burnt it, and hid it so he would not scold. He\r\n     said, \"We had better buy it roasted in the future and avoid such\r\n     accidents.\"\r\n\r\n     We roasted in the cellar. We had an elaborately polished Reed &\r\n     Mann engine in one window, two brass hoppered mills in the other,\r\n     and our boiler was under the sidewalk. We had a mahogany-top\r\n     counter, oil paintings on the wall, and bin fronts of Chinamen,\r\n     etc., done by the celebrated artist, Mat Hastings (now dead); so\r\n     you see we started right.\r\n\r\n     The fight we had to introduce roasted coffee was fierce. Our\r\n     argument was on the saving of fuel, labor, temper, scorched faces,\r\n     and anything we could think of. We talked only three coffees, Rio,\r\n     Java, and Mocha. When Santos began to come, it was hard to change\r\n     them over from the rank Rio flavor to the more mild Santos. The\r\n     latter they claimed did not have the rough taste. They missed it\r\n     and longed for the wild tang of the Rio.\r\n\r\n     We did not import, but bought in New Orleans and from several local\r\n     wholesale grocers. No one delivered. Shipments were f.o.b. St.\r\n     Louis. Draying and packages were extra. Coffee was not cleaned or\r\n     stoned, but was sold as it came from the sack. However, we did not\r\n     use any very low grades then. If any one complained of the stones\r\n     hurting their mills, we advised them to buy ground coffee, showing\r\n     how it kept better ground as it was packed tight, whereas the\r\n     roasted was looser and the air could get through it. It was fully a\r\n     year or more before we began to sell in quantities to make it\r\n     profitable. In roasting for others, we got a cent per pound; and\r\n     after awhile, that became so much a business it paid all our\r\n     expenses. We were the first to roast coffee by steam power west of\r\n     the Mississippi and east of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\n     The tea department helped us to hold out until coffee got its hold\r\n     on the public; for in those days every one used tea and insisted on\r\n     having it good. Price was no object. How different now!\r\n\r\n     Five years later (1862) J. Nevison, an Englishman, drifted into\r\n     town and opened at 85 North Fourth Street. He got out a very\r\n     bombastic circular which caused us to put out the one I enclose\r\n     (illustration, page 436). Then came a party named Childs; and after\r\n     him, Hugh Menown, grand-uncle of the present Menown, of Menown &\r\n     Gregory; and Mat Hunt; all passed over to the Great Majority. After\r\n     the Civil War they multiplied pretty fast, coming and going until\r\n     now we have nineteen roasting establishments in the city.\r\n\r\nThe late Julius J. Schotten also wrote the author as follows concerning\r\nthe days of the Carter roaster and of the wholesale coffee-roasting\r\nbusiness founded by William Schotten in 1862:\r\n\r\n     In the early days, every wholesale grocer was selling coffee; the\r\n     wholesale grocer controlled ninety percent of the trade in the\r\n     country. It did not pay the coffee roaster to have men on the road\r\n     selling coffee in those days. Such being the case, seventy-five\r\n     percent of the roasting done by the coffee roasters was job\r\n     roasting, at one cent a pound.\r\n\r\n     In the beginning there were only two kinds of roasted coffee known\r\n     to the trade in this section of the country (St. Louis) and of\r\n     course one of these brands was \"Rio\"--the other; \"Java\". The former\r\n     was a genuine Rio, but the Java was mostly Jamaica coffee.\r\n\r\n     Roasted coffee then was packed (for city trade) in five and ten\r\n     pound packages, and this size package seemed to supply the wants of\r\n     the ordinary grocer for a week. Occasionally a twenty-five pound\r\n     package, and in a few instances as much as fifty pounds of one\r\n     grade was sold at a time.\r\n\r\n     The class of customers the coffee roasters sold in those days were\r\n     the smaller merchants; the larger stores, having their ideas as to\r\n     quality, bought their coffees green. As they had very little sale\r\n     for the roasted, they would send a half-sack, and sometimes a whole\r\n     sack to have it roasted. It took a number of years to induce the\r\n     larger grocers, and even the average grocers, to purchase their\r\n     coffee already roasted.\r\n\r\n     Coffees were roasted in the old style, \"pull-out\" roaster cylinder.\r\n     That is to say, it was necessary to stop the roaster and to pull\r\n     out the cylinder to sample the coffee in order to know when to take\r\n     the coffee off the fire. When the coffee was ready to take off, the\r\n     cylinder was pulled out its entire length. It was then turned over\r\n     and a slide nine inches wide, running the full length of the\r\n     cylinder, was opened and the contents were dumped in the cooling\r\n     box. When the coffee reached the cooling box, it took two men with\r\n     hoes or wooden shovels to stir and turn it until it was properly\r\n     cooled, there being no cooling arrangements then as we have\r\n     nowadays.\r\n\r\n     At that time there were no stoning or separating machines; and as a\r\n     bag of the ordinary green Jamaica coffee contained from three to\r\n     five pounds of stones and sticks, it was necessary to hand-pick the\r\n     coffee after it was roasted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY FOREIGN AND AMERICAN COFFEE-MAKING DEVICES\r\n\r\n1--English adaptation of French boiler. 2--English coffee biggin.\r\n3--Improved Rumford percolator. 4--Jones's exterior-tube percolator.\r\n5--Parker's steam-fountain coffee maker. 6--Platow's filterer.\r\n7--Brain's Vacuum, or pneumatic filter. 8--Beart's percolator.\r\n9--American coffee biggin. 10--cloth-bag drip pot. 11--Vienna coffee\r\npot. 12--Le Brun's cafetière. 13--Reversible Potsdam cafetière. 14,\r\n15--Gen.

Remington, of Baltimore, on a roaster employing a wheel of\r\nbuckets to move the green coffee beans singly through a charcoal heated\r\ntrough. It never became a commercial success. (See 4, page 630.)\r\n\r\nIn 1847-48, William and Elizabeth Dakin were granted patents in England\r\non an apparatus for \"cleaning and roasting coffee and for making\r\ndecoctions.\" The roaster specification covered a gold, silver, platinum,\r\nor alloy-lined roasting cylinder and traversing carriage on an overhead\r\nrailway to move the roaster in and out of the roasting oven; and the\r\n\"decoction\" specification covered an arrangement for twisting a\r\ncloth-bag ground-coffee-container in a coffee biggin, or applied a screw\r\nmotion to a disk within a perforated cylinder containing the ground\r\ncoffee, so as to squeeze the liquid out of the grounds after infusion\r\nhad taken place.\r\n\r\nThe roaster has survived, but the coffee maker was not so fortunate. The\r\nDakin idea was that coffee was injuriously affected by coming in contact\r\nwith iron during the roasting process. The roasting cylinder was\r\nenclosed in an oven instead of being directly exposed to the furnace\r\nheat. The apparatus was provided also with a \"taster,\" or sampler, the\r\nfirst of its kind, to enable the operator to examine the roasting\r\nberries without stopping the machine. As will be seen by referring to\r\nthe picture of the model shown, the apparatus was ingenious and not\r\nwithout considerable merit. Dakin & Co. are still in existence in\r\nLondon, operating a machine very like the original model.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, Thomas John Knowlys was granted a patent in England on a\r\nperforated roasting cylinder coated with enamel.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted in passing that this idea of handling the green bean\r\nwith extreme delicacy, evidently obtained from the French, was never\r\ntaken seriously in the United States, whose inventors chose to handle it\r\nwith rough courage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DAKIN ROASTING MACHINE OF 1848]\r\n\r\nThe first English patent on a coffee grinder was granted to Luke\r\nHerbert in 1848.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, Apoleoni Pierre Preterre, of Havre, was granted an English\r\npatent on a coffee roaster mounted on a weighing apparatus to indicate\r\nloss of weight in roasting and automatically stop the roasting process.\r\nAt the same time he secured an English patent on a vacuum percolator,\r\nnot unlike Durant's of 1827.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 also, Thomas R. Wood, of Cincinnati, was granted a United States\r\npatent on a spherical coffee roaster for use on kitchen stoves. It\r\nattained considerable popularity among housewives who preferred to do\r\ntheir own roasting. (See 6, page 630.)\r\n\r\nIn 1852, Edward Gee secured a patent in England on a coffee roaster\r\nfitted with inclined flanges for turning the beans while roasting.\r\n\r\nC.W. Van Vliet, of Fishkill Landing, N.Y., was granted a United States\r\npatent in 1855 on a household coffee mill employing upper breaking and\r\nlower grinding cones. He assigned it to Charles Parker of Meriden, Conn.\r\nIn 1860-61 several United States patents were granted John and Edmund\r\nParker on coffee grinders for home use.\r\n\r\nIn 1862, E.J. Hyde, of Philadelphia, was granted a United States patent\r\non a combined coffee-roaster and stove fitted with a crane on which the\r\nroasting cylinder was revolved and swung out horizontally for emptying\r\nand refilling. This machine proved to be a commercial success. Benedickt\r\nFischer used one in his first roasting plant in New York. It is still\r\nbeing manufactured by the Bramhall Deane Company of New York.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GLOBULAR STOVE ROASTER OF 1860]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HYDE'S COMBINED ROASTER AND STOVE]\r\n\r\nIn 1864, Jabez Burns, of New York, was granted a United States patent on\r\nthe original Burns coffee roaster, the first machine which did not have\r\nto be moved away from the fire for discharging the roasted coffee, and\r\none that marked a distinct advance in the manufacture of coffee-roasting\r\napparatus. It was a closed iron cylinder set in brickwork. (See\r\nillustration, page 635.)\r\n\r\nJabez Burns had been a student of coffee roasting in New York for twenty\r\nyears before he produced the machine that was to revolutionize the\r\ncoffee business of the United States. He had brought with him from\r\nEngland a knowledge of the trade in that country, where he first began\r\nhis business training by selling Java coffee at fourteen cents and\r\nSumatra at eleven cents to hotels, boarding-houses, and private\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of the Civil War, the contrivances employed for roasting\r\ncoffee in every case necessitated the removal of the roasting\r\napparatus--whether pan, globe, or cylinder--from the fire. The process\r\nof causing coffee to discharge from the end of the roasting cylinder at\r\nthe pleasure of the operator while the cylinder was still in motion was\r\nnew; and the double set of flanges to produce this effect, and at the\r\nsame time, during the process of roasting, to keep the coffee equally\r\ndistributed from end to end of the cylinder, was new. Some one suggested\r\nthis last improvement was simply an Archimedean screw placed in a\r\ncylinder, but Mr. Burns replied: \"It is a double screw, a thing never\r\nsuggested by the Archimedean screw. It is, in fact, a double right and\r\nleft augur, one within the other, firmly secured together and also to\r\nthe shell or cylinder, and when the cylinder revolves the desired\r\nresult is obtained--the idea being entirely original.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Burns had watched the development of the coffee business from the\r\ntime when the preparation of coffee was largely confined to the home,\r\nwhere the approved roasting implements were hot stones, or tiles, iron\r\nplates, skillets, and frying pans. Some of these were still in use\r\ntwenty years after he produced his first machine; and he often said that\r\ncoffee evenly roasted by such methods was just as good as if done by the\r\nbest mechanical device ever invented. He also said: \"Coffee can be\r\nroasted in very simple machinery. Some of the best we ever saw was done\r\nin a corn popper. Patent portable roasters are almost as numerous as rat\r\ntraps or churns.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ORIGINAL BURNS ROASTER, 1864]\r\n\r\nHe early saw the practise of domestic roasting falling into disuse, as\r\nit was becoming possible to supply the consumer with roasted coffee for\r\nonly a trifle more than in the green state, with all the labor and\r\nannoyance of roasting done away with--a talking point that John Arbuckle\r\nwas quick to seize upon in his first Ariosa advertising.\r\n\r\nIn almost every town of any size there were concerns engaged in the\r\nroasting business. Within a few years, Burns machines were placed in all\r\nthe principal roasting centers. Pupke & Reid in New York; Flint, Evans &\r\nCo., and James H. Forbes in St. Louis; Arbuckles & Co., in Pittsburgh;\r\nthe Weikel & Smith Spice Co. in Philadelphia; Theodore F. Johnson & Co.,\r\nin Newark; Evans & Walker in Detroit; W. & J.G. Flint in Milwaukee; and\r\nParker & Harrison in Cincinnati, were among his first customers.\r\n\r\nIt is said that in 1845 there were facilities in and around New York to\r\nroast as much coffee as was then consumed in Great Britain. Steam power\r\nwas being extensively used, and the roasting was done here for a large\r\npart of the country. The habit was to buy roasted coffee from the coffee\r\nand spice mills by the bag or larger quantity for country consumption;\r\nand the grocers and small tea stores, for local consumption, bought from\r\ntwenty-five pounds upward at a time. This method cheapened the roasting\r\nof coffee to half a cent a pound; and then good profits could be made,\r\nfor everything was cheap in those days. Even at that, it would have been\r\nimpossible for each tea dealer to have roasted his own coffee for\r\nseveral times the amount, so the practise was generally adhered to all\r\nover the country.\r\n\r\nJabez Burns wrote in 1874:\r\n\r\n     It is preposterous to suppose that household roasting will be\r\n     continued long in any part of this country, if coffee properly\r\n     prepared can be had. This is demonstrated by the remarkable\r\n     advances made in Pittsburgh and other places, where only a few\r\n     years ago the sales were chiefly in green coffee. Now the amount\r\n     roasted in Pittsburgh alone by those who make a business of it,\r\n     exceeds the entire consumption of coffee of any kind in the United\r\n     States fifty years ago. It will never pay for small stores to roast\r\n     if the large manufactories will do the work well, and if they will\r\n     not, small dealers will add proper machinery, and will eventually\r\n     become strong competing dealers. By doing the work with proper care\r\n     they will not only secure a reputation with large sales for\r\n     themselves, but will command the roasting for other parties.\r\n\r\nUntil the Burns roaster appeared, coffee roasters were usually cylinders\r\nthat revolved upon an axis; the other devices that were tried were not\r\nsuccessful. Jabez Burns thus describes the first roaster he ever saw at\r\nHull, England:\r\n\r\n     It consisted of a furnace, open at the top, and a perforated\r\n     cylinder with a slide door. The axis, or shaft, of the cylinder had\r\n     bearings on a frame which passed outside the furnace, while the\r\n     cylinder went down into the fire pit, the top of which could be\r\n     covered over. In this position it could be turned by means of a\r\n     crank on the end of a shaft The only means of testing was by the\r\n     escape of the steam or aroma, whichever predominated, passing out\r\n     through the perforations at the top; but so expert was the operator\r\n     and so quick to detect the aroma, that he seldom had to return the\r\n     cylinder to the fire to produce a satisfactory roast. This man\r\n     roasted fifty pounds or less in a batch for a number of retail\r\n     stores.\r\n\r\n     Globes, consisting of two hemispheres, made of cast-iron and so\r\n     arranged that they opened to fill and discharge, but operated\r\n     substantially as above, only with the method of lowering into the\r\n     fire changed somewhat, I have seen in use in Scotland in 1840. They\r\n     were called French roasters.\r\n\r\n     In this country a few years ago the use of the long sheet-iron\r\n     cylinder was almost universal, varying only in the method of\r\n     placing the cylinder over the fire--some sideways on a track,\r\n     others endwise, sliding on a long shaft or by turning on a crane,\r\n     in either case causing considerable labor and loss of time, which\r\n     often resulted in the hands of the inexperienced in more or less\r\n     spoiling the batch of coffee.\r\n\r\nFrom his expert knowledge of coffee and coffee-roasting problems, Jabez\r\nBurns quickly rose to a commanding position in the industry. He was a\r\ntrade teacher and a trade builder. He had very definite ideas on\r\nroasting. He said:\r\n\r\n     The object of roasting is not attained until all the moisture\r\n     (water of vegetation) is driven off. Roast properly--uniformly and\r\n     sufficiently--and you will get all the aroma there is in the bean.\r\n     Coffees of various kinds can not be roasted to a uniform color.\r\n     Some will be of a light shade when sufficiently roasted while\r\n     others will have to be roasted dark to develop the aroma.\r\n     Therefore, appearance alone is not a proper test. Aroma-saving\r\n     devices have had their day. Coffee is of no use unless the aroma is\r\n     fully developed, and the more it is developed by roasting the\r\n     better it is. What passes off in the roasting process can not be\r\n     saved and is so small that if all of it in the country could be\r\n     collected and freed of all foreign matter, it would not weigh an\r\n     ounce.\r\n\r\n     Roast coffee over a slow fire so that it will be an hour before it\r\n     has the color of roasted coffee, and, in contrast, produce in\r\n     another batch of like quantity the same color in thirty minutes,\r\n     and it will be found for all intended purposes, either to grind,\r\n     sell or drink, that the latter will be, beyond all comparison, the\r\n     best. Coffee should be roasted uniform and as quickly as possible,\r\n     only it must not be scorched or spotted, otherwise it will have a\r\n     bitter burned taste. If roasted properly it will very considerably\r\n     increase its bulk and will be plump, swelled out and crisp; easily\r\n     crushed in the hand or between the fingers.\r\n\r\nIn his _Spice Mill Companion_, published in 1879, Jabez Burns said\r\nfurther in regard to roasting:\r\n\r\n     All coffees do not roast alike; some will be a bright light color\r\n     when done, and others will be dark before done. There are two\r\n     infallible rules, which if properly appreciated and tried will\r\n     prove to be practically useful. One is, when the aroma is\r\n     sufficiently developed to produce a sharp, cutting, but aromatic\r\n     sensation in the nose. Those who practice that way do not need to\r\n     see the roast. The other rule is that when a berry is broken it is\r\n     crisp and uniform in color inside and out. Those who are accustomed\r\n     to this method may be good coffee roasters, albeit they may not\r\n     have any nose at all. But we must state in this connection, that a\r\n     man who has no smell and is color blind is not a fit candidate for\r\n     the coffee roasting profession; and, moreover, we affirm that any\r\n     person who can not roast coffee, so far as judgment is concerned,\r\n     after a few trials, will never make a good operator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURNS GRANULATING MILL, 1872-74]\r\n\r\nIn 1867, Jabez Burns was granted a United States patent on an improved\r\ncoffee cooler, mixer, and grinding mill, or granulator. Another\r\ngranulator patent was issued to him in 1872. Mr. Burns had also given\r\nthe subject of cooling coffees considerable study, and his cooler was\r\nthe result. He argued that it was necessary to cool quickly. Before his\r\nday, various methods had been employed, such as placing the coffee in\r\nrevolving drums covered with wire cloth. Sometimes a draft of cold air\r\nwas applied to the cooling drums, and the dirt and chaff blown through\r\nthe wire cloth. It was also customary in wholesale establishments to\r\nblow cold air up through a perforated bottom, and this had been found\r\neffective when properly applied. The Burns idea was to cool by means of\r\nsuction, causing a downward draft through the coffee and wire-cloth\r\nbottomed box, which was found to be more uniform and efficient for\r\ncooling purposes, as well as in controlling smoke, heat, and dust, which\r\nby this means could be blown out of the roasting room by any convenient\r\noutlet.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of grinding, likewise, Mr. Burns had reached some\r\ndefinite conclusions. The French and English lap and wall mills, the\r\nEnglish steel mills, and the Swift mills were all used in the United\r\nStates. Troemner's, the Enterprise, and others--to be mentioned later in\r\nchronological order--were extending their use in a retail way; but Jabez\r\nBurns confined his attention to a practicable mill for wholesale\r\ngrinding establishments.\r\n\r\nFor manufacturing purposes, burstone mills were for many years\r\nexclusively employed, especially one first known as the Prentiss & Page,\r\nand later as the Page mill. There was a time when all the coffee\r\nestablishments in New York sent their coffee to Prentiss & Page to be\r\nground. Some of the places roasted by hand, others by horse power; and\r\nif by steam, it was limited, and they did not have enough to spare for\r\ngrinding.\r\n\r\nWith the march of improvement, burstone mills went into the discard. The\r\ndifficulty lay in finding men experienced in stone dressing to run them;\r\nand the demand grew for a better style of grinding than could be done in\r\na mill out of face and balance. This demand was met in an altogether\r\ndifferent style of machine, which for twenty-five years was well known\r\nas the Barbor mill. It was for improvements on this mill that Jabez\r\nBurns in 1867, 1872, and 1874 obtained his granulator patents.\r\n\r\nThe mill comprised cutters in the form of an iron roller running in near\r\ncontact with a concave, also of iron, and a revolving cylinder provided\r\nwith sieves, or screens, that received the ground material, rolled it\r\nover the wire surface, sifting out the fine and discharging the coarse\r\nautomatically into the cutter, to be again manipulated until it was fine\r\nenough to pass through the meshes of the screen.\r\n\r\nJabez Burns patented an improved form of his roaster in 1881, and a\r\nsample-coffee roaster in 1883, before he died in 1888; and since that\r\ntime his sons, who continue the business, have perfected a number of\r\nimprovements and brought out new machines which will be referred to in\r\nchronological order.\r\n\r\nJames H. Nason, of Franklin, Mass., was granted a United States patent\r\nin 1865 on a percolator with fluid joints.\r\n\r\nP.H. Vanderweyde, of Philadelphia, was granted United States patents in\r\n1866 on a percolator and a continuous coffee-filtering machine.\r\n\r\nRaparlier was granted a French patent on a pocket coffee-making device\r\nin 1867. In later years, his invention became very popular among French\r\ncoffee drinkers. It was one of the early practicable forms of\r\ndouble-glass-globe filtration devices.\r\n\r\nE.B. Manning of Middletown, Conn., was granted his first patent on a tea\r\nand coffee pot in 1868. Others followed in 1870 and 1876. In the latter\r\nyear, John Bowman brought out the valve-type percolator which\r\nsubsequently attained great favor in American households.\r\n\r\nThomas Smith & Son (Elkington & Company, Ltd., successors) began to\r\nmanufacture at Glasgow, Scotland, about 1870, the Napierian vacuum\r\ncoffee machine which had been invented in 1840--but never patented--by\r\nRobert Napier of the celebrated firm of Clyde shipbuilders. This machine\r\nmakes coffee by distillation and filtration. It employs a metal globe,\r\nand a brewer from which the coffee is syphoned over into the globe\r\nthrough a tube, around the strainer-end of which, as it rests in the\r\ncoffee liquid in the brewer, there is tied a filter cloth. It is still\r\nbeing manufactured by Elkington & Company.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NAPIER'S VACUUM MACHINE, 1840]\r\n\r\nThomas Page, a New York millwright, began the manufacture of a pull-out\r\ncoffee roaster similar to the old Carter machine, in 1868. Later, Chris\r\nAbele, who was foreman in the Page shop, succeeded to the business; and\r\nin 1882, he was granted a United States patent on an improvement on a\r\ncoffee roaster similar to the original Burns machine (the patent had\r\nthen expired) which he marketed under the name of Knickerbocker.\r\n\r\n\r\n_German Coffee Machinery_\r\n\r\nThe Germans first began to show an active interest in coffee machinery\r\nin 1860. In that year, Alexius Van Gulpen, of Emmerich, produced a\r\ngreen-coffee grader; and later (1868), in partnership with J.H. Lensing\r\nand Theodore von Gimborn, began the manufacture of coffee-roasting\r\nmachines. From this start there developed in Emmerich quite an industry\r\nin coffee-machinery building. In 1870, Alexius Van Gulpen introduced to\r\nthe German trade a globular coffee roaster employing wood and coke as\r\nfuel and having perforations and an exhauster. Van Gulpen and von\r\nGimborn are the two names most often met with in the development of\r\nGerman coffee-roasting machinery.\r\n\r\nThe first recorded German patent on a coffee roaster was issued to G.\r\nTubermann's Son in 1877, for \"a coffee burner with vertically adjusted\r\nstirring works.\" German patents were issued in 1878 to R. Muhlberg, of\r\nTaucha, for coffee roasters with movable partitions and \"screw-shaped\r\ndeclining walls.\" Six roaster patents were issued to other inventors in\r\n1878-79.\r\n\r\nPeter Pearson, of Manchester, took out a German patent on a\r\ncoffee-roasting apparatus in 1880. Fleury & Barker, of London, were\r\ngranted a coffee-roaster patent in Germany in 1881.\r\n\r\nAfter 1870, Van Gulpen devoted himself to the cylinder type of roaster,\r\non which he obtained several patents. The partnership between Messrs.\r\nVan Gulpen, Lensing and von Gimborn was dissolved in 1906. They were\r\nsucceeded by the Emmericher Maschinenfabrik und Eissengiesserei, and Van\r\nGulpen & Co. Van Gulpen died in 1920. Among his inventions were a\r\ncircular air fan to supply fresh air to the beans while roasting; a\r\nfire-dampening device; roasting and cooling exhausters; and a\r\n\"withdrawable\" mixer remaining inside the cylinder during the roasting\r\nprocess, but designed to be withdrawn at the end, discharging the\r\ncontents with a jerk into a circular cooler. These improvements are\r\nfeatured in Van Gulpen & Co.'s latest Meteor machine. They make also the\r\nTyphoon and Comet machines, and a line of globular roasters.\r\n\r\nA dozen coffee-roaster patents were issued in Germany in 1880-82. Among\r\nthem was one to the Emmerich Machine Factory and Iron Foundry, Van\r\nGulpen, Lensing & von Gimborn, Emmerich, in 1882.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GERMAN GAS AND COAL ROASTING MACHINES\r\n\r\nLeft, Perfekt gas roaster--Right, Probat coal roaster]\r\n\r\nNumerous coffee-cooling, coffee-grinding, and coffee-making devices were\r\npatented in Germany from 1877 to 1885; among them Newstadt's\r\ncoffee-extract machine in 1882, safety attachments, rapid filters,\r\nVienna coffee makers, etc. The first Vienna coffee maker seems to have\r\nbeen patented in Germany in 1879.\r\n\r\nThe Emmerich Machine Factory and Iron Foundry acquired certain Danish\r\nand Austrian coffee-roaster patents in 1881, and in 1892 it was granted\r\na German patent on a ball roaster. In the eighties this concern began\r\nthe manufacture of a closed ball, or globular, roaster with gas-heater\r\nattachment. It acquired, in 1889, the rights for Germany to manufacture\r\ngas roasters under the Dutch Henneman patents of 1888. In 1892, Theodore\r\nvon Gimborn was granted French and English patents on a coffee roaster\r\nemploying a naked gas flame in a rotary cylinder. In 1897, the\r\nEmmericher concern was granted a German patent on an automatic circular\r\ntipping cooler with power drive. Today, this factory features the Probat\r\nand Perfekt roasters, but manufactures a general line of cylinder and\r\nball machines for coal, coke, and gas.\r\n\r\nAmong others engaged in the manufacture of coffee machines in Germany\r\nare G. W. Barth, Ludwigsburg, and Ferd. Gothot, Mulheim on Rhur. The\r\nlatter manufactures a coke or gas heated quick-roaster known as the\r\nIdeal-Rapid, and a smaller hand-power machine, of the same type, called\r\nFavour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OTHER GERMAN COFFEE ROASTERS\r\n\r\nLeft, globular machine--Right, Meteor quick-roasting outfit]\r\n\r\n\r\n_American, French, and British Machines_\r\n\r\nIn 1869, Élie Moneuse and L. Duparquet, of New York, were granted three\r\nUnited States patents on a coffee pot or urn made of sheet copper and\r\nlined with pure sheet block tin. These patents were the foundation of\r\nthe successful coffee-urn business afterward built up under the name of\r\nthe Duparquet, Huot & Moneuse Co.\r\n\r\nThomas Smith & Son (Elkington & Co., Ltd., successors) began, in 1870,\r\nthe manufacture of the Napierian coffee-making machine at Glasgow,\r\nScotland. This was a device for making coffee by distillation, employing\r\na metal globe syphon and brewer with filter cloth. The principle was\r\nsubsequently used in the Napier-List steam coffee machine for ships and\r\ninstitutions, patented in England in 1891.\r\n\r\nJohn Gulick Baker, of Philadelphia, one of the founders of the\r\nEnterprise Manufacturing Co. of Pennsylvania, was granted a United\r\nStates patent in 1870, on a coffee grinder introduced to the trade as\r\nthe Enterprise Champion No. 1 store mill. Another Baker patent was\r\ngranted in 1873, and this became known as the Enterprise Champion Globe\r\nNo. 0. These mills were the pioneer machines for store use.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, Delphine, Sr., of Marourme, France, was granted a French patent\r\non a tubular coffee roaster which turned over a flame.\r\n\r\nIn the sixties and seventies, French inventors became quite active on\r\ncoffee-roaster improvements. Many patents were granted, and quite a few\r\nwere for practical small-capacity machines that have survived, and are\r\nin use today in France and on the continent. Some supplied inspiration\r\nfor inventors in neighboring countries. Among the more notable names,\r\nmention should be made of Martin, of St. Quentin, who produced a\r\nsheet-iron cylinder roaster with \"interior gatherer\" in 1860; Marchand,\r\nof Paris, \"fan roaster with movable fire box,\" 1866 and 1869; Lauzaune,\r\nParis, \"rocking system of roasting coffee in a round stove,\" 1873;\r\nIttel's glass sphere, Lyons, 1874; and Marchand and Hignette, Paris,\r\n1877, a ball coffee roaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Evolution of the Gas Roaster_\r\n\r\nAccording to the patent records, Roure, of Marseilles, appears to have\r\nproduced the original gas coffee roaster in 1877. The evolution of the\r\ngas roasting-machine was as follows:\r\n\r\nIn 1879, H. Faulder, of Stockport, England, obtained an English patent\r\non an external air-blast burner applied to a cylinder gas machine, which\r\nis still being manufactured by the Grocers Engineering and Whitmee,\r\nLtd., of London. Fleury and Barker, of London, followed with another\r\nEnglish gas machine in 1880, the heat being supplied from gas jets over\r\nthe roasting cylinder. In 1881, Peter Pearson, of Manchester, produced a\r\ngas roaster which consisted of a wire-gauze cylinder revolving under a\r\nmetal plate heated by gas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORIGINAL ENTERPRISE MILL]\r\n\r\nBeeston Tupholme, of London, was granted an English patent in 1887, on a\r\ndirect-flame gas roaster which he assigned to Joseph Baker & Sons.\r\n\r\nKarel F. Henneman, the Hague, Netherlands, took out his first patent on\r\nthe Henneman direct-flame gas roaster in Spain in 1888; and the\r\nfollowing year, he obtained patents in Belgium, France, and England. His\r\nUnited States patents were granted in 1893-95.\r\n\r\nPostulart secured a patent in France for a gas coffee roaster in 1888.\r\n\r\nThe Germans also began, in the eighties, to take the quick gas coffee\r\nroaster seriously. In 1889, Carl Alexander Otto, of Dresden, secured a\r\nGerman patent on a spiral tubular machine to roast coffee in three and a\r\nhalf minutes. It was first manufactured and sold by Max Thurmer, of\r\nDresden, in 1891-93.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAX THURMER'S QUICK GAS ROASTER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOADING COFFEE ON ZAMBOEKS AT HODEIDA\r\n\r\nThese boats then transfer their cargoes to steamships lying in the\r\nroads]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PICTURESQUE CAMEL AND BULLOCK CARTS\r\n\r\nUsed for local coffee transport in Aden and Hodeida]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRIMITIVE TRANSPORTATION METHODS IN ARABIA]\r\n\r\nThe subject of quick roasting has greatly agitated German and French\r\ncoffee men. Otto found that coffee roasted in small quantities (say\r\nfifty grams) on a sample-roaster produced a finer flavor and aroma than\r\nthat roasted in the big machines. He set out to produce a machine that\r\nwould roast continuous small quantities in the shortest time. He built\r\nthe first commercial machine under his patent in 1893. It was shown at\r\nthe International Food Exhibition in Dresden in 1894. The latest type\r\nmanufactured by Max Thurmer, Dresden, in which firm Otto is a partner,\r\nhas a spiral five meters long and an hourly production of about 450\r\npounds. The Thurmer machine, as it is called, has been sold to the trade\r\nsince 1914.\r\n\r\nQuick roasting is gone in for quite extensively in Germany, even in the\r\nbig trade-roasting plants, where machines to roast in ten to seventeen\r\nminutes are common. Natural, slow cooling is most necessary with quick\r\nroasting, according to Thurmer. On the other hand, A. Mottant, of Paris,\r\nwho also manufactures a line of quick gas-roasting machines, called\r\nMagic, argues that quick cooling is essential after quick roasting.\r\nThree of the Mottant machines are illustrated on pages 642 and 644.\r\n\r\nOther quick-roasting machines of German make are the Combinator,\r\nTornado, and Rekord.\r\n\r\nIn a lecture before the Society of Medical Officers of Health, London,\r\nOctober 24, 1912, William Lawton demonstrated to the satisfaction of his\r\naudience that coffee could be roasted in 3 minutes, using a perforated\r\ngas-roaster of his own invention.[365]\r\n\r\nThe first direct-flame gas coffee roaster in America was installed in\r\nthe plant of the Potter-Parlin Co., New York, by F.T. Holmes, in 1893.\r\nThis was Tupholme's machine, patented in England in 1887, and in the\r\nUnited States in 1896-97. The Potter-Parlin Co. subsequently placed the\r\nTupholme machines throughout the United States on a daily rental basis,\r\nlimiting its leases to one firm in a city, having obtained the exclusive\r\nAmerican rights from the Waygood, Tupholme Co., now the Grocers\r\nEngineering and Whitmee, Ltd.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ENGLISH GAS COFFEE-ROASTING PLANT\r\n\r\nThe machines are the Morewood (Improved Faulder) sliding-burner indirect\r\ntype]\r\n\r\nNatural gas was first used in the United States as fuel for roasting\r\ncoffee in 1896, when it was introduced under coal roasting cylinders in\r\nPennsylvania and Indiana by improvised gas burners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRENCH GLOBULAR ROASTER]\r\n\r\nEdwin Crawley and W.T. Johnston, Newport, Ky., assignors to the\r\nPotter-Parlin Co., New York, were granted four United States patents on\r\ngas coffee-roasting machines.\r\n\r\nIn 1897, a special gas burner, not to be confused with the direct-flame\r\nmachine, was first attached to a regular Burns roaster in the United\r\nStates, and was made the basis of application for a patent.\r\n\r\nIn 1897-99, David B. Fraser, of New York, began to market in the United\r\nStates a central-heated gas-fuel machine with an inner wire-cloth\r\ncylinder to keep the coffee from dropping into the flame, developed\r\nunder United States patents granted to Carl H. Duehring, of Hoboken, in\r\n1897, and to D.B. Fraser in 1899.\r\n\r\nM.F. Hamsley, of Brooklyn, was granted a United States patent on an\r\nimproved direct-flame gas roaster in 1898.\r\n\r\nEllis M. Potter, New York, was granted in 1899, a United States patent\r\non an improved direct-flame gas roaster in which the flame was spread\r\nover a large area to avoid scorching and to insure a more thorough and\r\nuniform roast. In the Tupholme machine, the gas flame entered at one\r\nend, and the smoke and flame went out through a stack on top. In the\r\nPotter machine, the stack was put on the end opposite the gas intake,\r\nwith a fan to pull the flame all the way through.\r\n\r\nThe Burns direct-flame gas roaster, with patented swing-gate head for\r\nfeeding and discharging, was introduced to the trade in 1900. The Burns\r\ngas sample-roaster followed.\r\n\r\nIn 1901, Joseph Lambert, of Marshall, Mich., introduced to the trade one\r\nof the earliest indirect gas roasting machines.\r\n\r\nIn 1901, also, T.C. Morewood, of Brentford, England, was granted an\r\nEnglish patent on a gas roaster fitted with a sliding burner and a\r\nremovable sampling tube. This machine is now being made by the Grocers\r\nEngineering and Whitmee, Ltd.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, 1901, F.T. Holmes, formerly with the Potter-Parlin\r\nCo., joined the Huntley Manufacturing Co., Silver Creek, N.Y., which\r\nthen began to build the Monitor direct-flame gas coffee roaster. Mr.\r\nHolmes still further improved the Tupholme idea by putting gas burners\r\nin both ends of the roasting cylinder, with the pipes bent down so as to\r\ncause the gas flame to go first to the bottom and then up to the stack\r\non top. This improvement was never patented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIROCCO MACHINE (FRENCH)]\r\n\r\nThe Henneman direct-flame gas roaster was introduced to the United\r\nStates trade in 1905, by C.A. Cross & Co., wholesale grocers, of\r\nFitchburg, Mass. It was marketed here seven years, but was never a\r\ngreat success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENGLISH ROASTING AND GRINDING EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nShowing one 168-pound Simplex gas roaster, with a Rapid disk grinding\r\nmachine having a capacity of 300 to 400 pounds per hour]\r\n\r\nIn 1906, F.T. Holmes was granted a United States patent on a coffee\r\nroaster which he assigned to the Huntley Manufacturing Co.\r\n\r\nJ.C. Prims, of Battle Creek, Mich., was granted a United States patent\r\nin 1908, on a corrugated cylinder improvement for a gas and coal roaster\r\ndesigned for retail stores. The A.J. Deer Co., Hornell, N.Y., acquired\r\nthis machine in 1909, and began to market it as the Royal coffee\r\nroaster. An improvement patented in 1915 by J.C. Prims was assigned to\r\nthe A.J. Deer Co.\r\n\r\nIn 1915, and again in 1919, Jabez Burns & Sons, New York, patented their\r\nJubilee roaster, an inner-heated machine in which the gas is burned\r\ninside a revolving cylinder in a combustion chamber protected from\r\ndirect coffee contact. The heat is deflected downward and then passes\r\nupward through the coffee.\r\n\r\nIn 1919, William Fullard (_d._ 1921), of Philadelphia, was granted a\r\nUnited States patent on a \"heated fresh air system\" roaster, in which\r\nthe fresh air is forced by an electric fan through a pipe to a set of\r\ncoils over gas, coal, or oil flame. At the top of the coils is a\r\nmanifold, the hot air being forced through small holes to circulate in\r\nand around a regulation perforated roasting cylinder; the vapors and\r\nspent air are then drawn into an overhead exhaust pipe that connects\r\nwith a pipe provided with a fresh-air intake, the idea being to return\r\nthem to the roasting cylinder after being mixed with fresh air and\r\nheated in the coils as before. This patent has not been successfully\r\nmarketed at the time of writing. The purpose is to roast by heated air\r\nnot mixed with any furnace gases. Whether this can be done with\r\nsufficient fuel economy, and whether coffee thus roasted would have any\r\ngreater value, are questions that are raised by the coffee experts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee-Grinding and Coffee-Making Chronology_\r\n\r\nTo return to our coffee-grinding and coffee-making chronology, it is to\r\nbe noted that in 1875-76-78, Turner Strowbridge, of New Brighton, Pa.,\r\nwas granted three United States patents on a box coffee mill, first made\r\nby Logan & Strowbridge, later the Logan & Strowbridge Iron Company, the\r\nlatter being succeeded by the Wrightsville Hardware Co. in 1906.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAGIC GAS MACHINE (FRENCH)]\r\n\r\nIn 1878, a United States patent was issued to Rudolphus L. Webb,\r\nassignor to Landers, Frary & Clark, New Britain, Conn., on an improved\r\nbox coffee grinder for home use.\r\n\r\nIn 1878, and in 1880, United States patents were issued to John C. Dell\r\nof Philadelphia on a store coffee mill.\r\n\r\nIn 1879, and in 1880, United States patents were issued to Orson W.\r\nStowe, of the Peck, Stowe & Wilcox Co., Southington, Conn., on a\r\nhousehold coffee mill.\r\n\r\nIn 1879, Charles Halstead, of New York, was granted the first United\r\nStates patent on a metal coffee pot having a china interior. It was an\r\ninfuser for home use.\r\n\r\nIn 1880, coffee pots, with tops having muslin bottoms for clarifying and\r\nstraining, were first made in the United States by the Duparquet, Huot &\r\nMoneuse Co., of New York.\r\n\r\nThe name Hungerford first appears in the United States patent records in\r\n1880-81, in connection with patents granted to G.W. and G.S. Hungerford\r\non machines for cleaning, scouring, and polishing coffee. In 1882, the\r\nHungerfords, father and son, brought out a roaster. This machine and the\r\none patented by Chris Abele, of New York, already referred to, were\r\nconstructions resulting from the expiration of the original Burns patent\r\nof 1864. In 1881, Jabez Burns patented the improved Burns roaster,\r\ncomprising a turn-over front head serving for both feeding and\r\ndischarging. Additional United States coffee-roaster patents were issued\r\nto G.W. Hungerford in 1887-89. In the latter year, David Fraser, who\r\ncame to the United States from Glasgow in 1886, established the\r\nHungerford Co., succeeding the business of the Hungerfords, and later\r\nbeing granted certain United States patents, already mentioned. In 1910,\r\nthe Hungerford Co. business was discontinued in New York; and David B.\r\nFraser moved to Jersey City, where he continued to operate as the Fraser\r\nManufacturing Co. This business was discontinued in 1918.\r\n\r\nChris Abele was an active competitor of the Hungerfords and of the\r\nFraser Manufacturing Co.; and his Knickerbocker roaster was sold over a\r\nwide territory. He died in 1910; and his son-in-law, Gottfried Bay,\r\nsucceeded to the business.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURNS JUBILEE GAS MACHINE]\r\n\r\nIn 1881, the Morgan Brothers, Edgar H. and Charles, began the\r\nmanufacture of household coffee mills, the business being acquired in\r\n1885 by the Arcade Manufacturing Co., of Freeport, Ill. The latter\r\nconcern brought out the first pound coffee mill in 1889. Its mills\r\nbecame very popular in the United States. In 1900, Charles Morgan was\r\ngranted a United States patent on a glass-jar coffee mill, with\r\nremovable glass measuring cup.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOUBLE AROMATIC GAS ROASTING OUTFIT (FRENCH)]\r\n\r\nIn 1881, Harvey Ricker, of Brooklyn, later of Minneapolis, introduced to\r\nthe trade in the United States a \"minute coffee pot\" and urn known as\r\nthe Boss, the name being subsequently changed to Minute. He improved and\r\npatented the device in 1901 as the Half-Minute coffee pot. It is a\r\nfiltration device employing a cotton sack with a thickened bottom.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, Chris Abele, of New York, patented an improvement on the\r\nold-style Burns roaster, with openings cut in the front plate. It was\r\nknown as the Knickerbocker. As already noted, the machine was a\r\ncompetitor of the Hungerford machine patented the same year.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, a German patent was granted to Emil Newstadt, of Berlin, on one\r\nof the earliest coffee-extract machines.\r\n\r\nIn 1883, Jabez Burns was granted a United States patent on his improved\r\nsample-coffee roaster.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, the Star coffee pot, later known as the Marion Harland, was\r\nintroduced to the trade. It employed a wire-gauze drip device, called a\r\n\"filter,\" which was fitted to a metal pot. It was extensively advertised\r\nand attained considerable popularity. The same year, Finley Acker, of\r\nPhiladelphia, brought out an improved coffee pot for family trade.\r\nLater, he produced his Mo-Kof-Fee pot and an individual porcelain drip\r\npot for testing-table use.\r\n\r\nIn 1885, F.A. Cauchois, New York, brought out an improved\r\nporcelain-lined urn.\r\n\r\nIn 1887-88, the Etruscan coffee pot was invented and put on the market\r\nby the Etruscan Coffee Pot Co., of Philadelphia. It employed a muslin\r\ncylinder with metal ends and a mechanism for combining \"agitation,\r\ndistillation and infusion.\" It was not unlike the Dakin device of 1848,\r\npreviously mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn 1890, A. Mottant, Bar-le-Duc, France, began to manufacture a line of\r\ncoffee-roasting machinery which included vertical ball-and-cylinder\r\nmachines, using wood, coal, coke, or gas for fuel. His best known makes\r\nare Magic and Sirocco (see page 642).\r\n\r\nBefore 1895, the commercial roaster was little used in France. Since\r\nthen, the industry has developed, but without displacing the smaller\r\nroaster for family use. Ball roasters are popular with shop-keepers,\r\nespecially the variety manufactured by the Établissements Lauzaune at\r\nParis, and known as Aromatic, being equipped with electric motors. This\r\nfirm builds also a larger machine known as Moderne.\r\n\r\nOther makes of roasters that have attained prominence in France are the\r\nLambert, equipped with a steam condenser; Van den Brouck's, having the\r\nroasting cylinder lined with wire gauze; and Resson's machine for\r\nwholesale plants.\r\n\r\nThe French led off with glass-cylinder roasters for home use in the\r\nearly seventies. They are still popular. One of the developments of the\r\nlast decade was known as the Bijou, and was operated by clock work. A\r\nsimilar automatic machine, made of glass, was manufactured and sold in\r\nNew York in 1908 under the name of the Home roaster. As late as 1914, an\r\nAmerican inventor produced a home roaster for use in a stove hole. This\r\ndevice had a stirrer in the cover to be rotated by hand. A similar\r\ndevice was sold in 1917 under the name Savo. Home roasting, however, has\r\nbecome a lost art in America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAMBERT'S VICTORY GAS MACHINE]\r\n\r\nIn 1897, Joseph Lambert, of Vermont, began the manufacture and sale in\r\nBattle Creek, Mich., of the Lambert self-contained coffee roaster\r\nwithout the brick setting then required for coffee-roasting machines. In\r\n1900, he was joined by A.P. Grohens. In 1901, the Lambert Food and\r\nMachinery Co. was organized. In 1904, the company was reorganized. Since\r\nthen, many improvements have been made under Mr. Grohens' direction. The\r\nLambert gas roaster, one of the first machines employing gas as fuel for\r\nindirect roasting, dates back to 1901, as previously mentioned. The\r\nEconomic roaster is Mr. Grohens' latest development for coal or coke\r\nfuel. It is a compact self-contained equipment operating in connection\r\nwith a new-type rotary cooler. He has also recently (1922) brought out a\r\ngas-fired, electrically operated 600-pound Victory roaster and a\r\nfifty-pound miniature coffee-roasting plant designed for retail stores.\r\n\r\nIn 1897, the Enterprise Manufacturing Co. of Pennsylvania was the first\r\nregularly to employ electric motors for driving commercial coffee mills\r\nby means of belt-and-pulley attachments.\r\n\r\nIn 1898, the Hobart Manufacturing Co., of Troy, Ohio, introduced to the\r\ntrade another early coffee grinder connected with an electric motor and\r\ndriven by belt-and-pulley attachment.\r\n\r\nIn 1900, the first gear-driven electric coffee grinder was put on the\r\nmarket by the Enterprise Manufacturing Co. of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIn 1902, the Coles Manufacturing Co., (Braun Co., successor) and Henry\r\nTroemner, of Philadelphia, began the manufacture and sale of gear-driven\r\nelectric coffee grinders.\r\n\r\nIn 1905, the A.J. Deer Co., Buffalo, N.Y., (now at Hornell, N.Y.) began\r\nto sell its Royal electric coffee mills direct to dealers on the\r\ninstalment plan, revolutionizing the former practise of selling coffee\r\nmills through hardware jobbers.\r\n\r\nIn 1905, H.L. Johnston was granted a United States patent on a coffee\r\nmill. He assigned the patent to the Hobart Manufacturing Co.\r\n\r\nIn 1900, Charles Lewis was granted a United States patent on an improved\r\nreversible filtration coffee pot known as the Kin-Hee. This pot has\r\nsince been further improved, and the patent rights sold in several\r\nforeign countries. It employs a filter cloth in place of the metal or\r\nchina strainer used in the French drip pot.\r\n\r\nIn 1901, Landers, Frary & Clark's improved Universal percolator was\r\npatented in the United States. This pot has proved to be one of the most\r\npopular percolators on the American market. This firm brought out the\r\nUniversal Cafenoira, a double glass filtration device, in 1916. It is\r\ncovered by design and structural patents issued in 1916 and 1917.\r\n\r\nIn 1900, the Burns swing-gate sample-roasting outfit was patented in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIn 1901, Robert Burns, of New York, was granted two United States\r\npatents on a coffee roaster and cooler.\r\n\r\nIn 1901, Freidrich Kuchelmeister, Brux, Austria-Hungary, was granted a\r\nUnited States patent on a coffee roaster having a double-walled drum,\r\nthe inner being of wire gauze, and the outer of solid iron, designed to\r\nprevent scorching of the beans.\r\n\r\nIn 1902, W.M. Still & Sons, London, were granted an English patent on a\r\nsteam coffee-making machine employing twelve ounces of coffee to the\r\ngallon.\r\n\r\nIn 1902, T.K. Baker, of Minneapolis, was granted two United States\r\npatents on a cloth-filter coffee-making device.\r\n\r\nIn 1903, A.E. Bronson, Jr., assignor to the Bronson-Walton Company,\r\nCleveland, Ohio, was granted a United States patent on a coffee mill.\r\n\r\nIn 1903, John Arbuckle was granted a United States patent on a\r\ncoffee-roasting apparatus employing a fan to force the hot fire gases\r\ninto the roasting cylinder. From this was developed the Jumbo roaster,\r\nnow used in the Arbuckle plant, which roasts ten thousand pounds an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Electric Coffee-Roasting_\r\n\r\nIn 1903, George C. Lester, of New York, was granted a United States\r\npatent on an electric coffee roaster, that is, a machine to roast by\r\nelectric heat. There were two cylinders, the inner being of wire gauze,\r\nand the outer of copper and asbestos. Between the two, four electric\r\nheaters were placed.\r\n\r\nThere was demonstrated in Germany, in 1906, an electric coffee roaster\r\nemploying a number of resistance coils, consisting of strips of Krupp\r\nmetal two and one-half mm. thick, five mm. broad, and thirteen and\r\none-half mm. long, wound on porcelain tubes, which transmitted the heat\r\nto the air within the roasting cylinder. Analysis showed that coffee\r\nelectrically roasted contained more substances soluble in water than\r\nthat roasted by coke, as well as considerably more material soluble in\r\nether. This machine was invented by Captain Carl Moegling about 1900.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE FIRST ELECTRIC COFFEE MILLS]\r\n\r\nAnother electric-fuel-machine patent was granted in the United States to\r\nRobert H. Talbutt, of Baltimore, in 1911. This machine had the electric\r\nheater in the center of the roasting cylinder. An electrically heated\r\nmachine called the Ben Franklin was demonstrated in New York in 1918.\r\n\r\nIn 1919, Everett T. Shortt, Dallas, Tex., was granted a United States\r\npatent on an electrical roaster.\r\n\r\nUp to the present writing, no great progress has been made in the United\r\nStates with the roasting of coffee by electric heat.\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix Electrical Heating Co. manufactured, and the Uno Company,\r\nLtd., of London, marketed an electrically heated roaster as far back as\r\n1909. The machine was not altogether satisfactory, even to the makers;\r\nand the Uno Company is now (1922) experimenting with a new type of\r\nelectric roaster which it expects will remedy the defects of the early\r\nmachine. The 1909 roaster was made of two concentric cylinders revolving\r\naround a set of fixed heating elements, consisting of a series of\r\nspiral wires held in position on fireproof clay insulators, these wires\r\nbeing assembled, insulated, and brought out through the fixed center to\r\na terminal, or a set of terminals, at one end. In this way, no contact\r\nbrushes or rings were needed. The machine had a sampling device at one\r\nend which threw out a few berries each time it was operated. It was not\r\npossible to return these sample berries. Such an arrangement appeared\r\nnecessary, however, unless one was prepared to have the heating element\r\non the outside of the machine and to pick up the current by means of\r\nrings or brushes. When the operator became accustomed to the coffee he\r\nwas roasting, this was not a matter of great moment, because in England,\r\nat least, the average coffee roaster does not require a testing sample\r\nuntil he is about ready to turn out and to cool the roast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENGLISH ELECTRIC-FUEL ROASTER]\r\n\r\nThe Uno machine had a capacity of seven pounds, and the time occupied in\r\nroasting was from eight to ten minutes, depending on whether the roaster\r\nhad been freshly switched on or had been running for a few minutes. The\r\nwattage was 5,520. The consumption per hundred-weight was under thirteen\r\nunits. The makers gave, as the most economical pressure on which to\r\nwork, 220 to 240 volts. The machine was operated for eighteen months in\r\nthe show window of a London retail grocer.\r\n\r\nIn 1921, a United States patent was granted to Mark T. Seymour, Stowe,\r\nN.Y., on an electric coffee and peanut roaster, which has the heating\r\nelement embedded in a cement-lined cylinder that contains a roasting\r\ncage.\r\n\r\nIn 1921, Fred J. Kuhlemeir and Ralph J. Quelle, of Burlington, Ia., were\r\ngranted a United States patent on a small household coffee roaster\r\nelectrically equipped, and roasting by electric heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Machinery Patents_\r\n\r\nIn 1903, Luigi Giacomini, of Florence, Italy, was granted a United\r\nStates patent on a process for roasting coffee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEN FRANKLIN ELECTRIC COFFEE ROASTER]\r\n\r\nIn 1905, A.A. Warner, assignor to Landers, Frary & Clark, New Britain,\r\nConn., was granted two United States patents on a coffee mill.\r\n\r\nIn 1906, Ludwig Schmidt, assignor to the Essmueller Mill Furnishing\r\nCo., St. Louis, was granted a United States patent on a coffee roaster.\r\nThis company and the Reuter-Jones Manufacturing Co., also of St. Louis,\r\nwere making machines similar to the original Burns model. The\r\nReuter-Jones Manufacturing Co., in 1910, brought out a self-contained\r\ngas roaster called the St. Louis, Jr. In 1913, at a receiver's sale,\r\nA.P. Grohens, of the Lambert Machine Co., acquired all the machinery and\r\npatent rights of the Reuter-Jones Manufacturing Company.\r\n\r\nIn 1904, J.W. Chapman and G.W. Kooman, assignors to Manning, Bowman &\r\nCo., Meriden, Conn., were granted a United States patent on a coffee or\r\ntea pot. The same year, George E. Savage and G.W. Hope were granted two\r\nUnited States patents on coffee or tea pots, also assigned to Manning,\r\nBowman & Co.\r\n\r\nIn 1904, Sigmund Sternau, J.P. Steppe, and L. Strassberger, assignors to\r\nS. Sternau & Co., New York, were granted a United States patent on a\r\npercolator. Six others were granted to Charles Nelson, and assigned to\r\nS. Sternau & Co., in 1912 and 1913, for a percolator, the manufacture\r\nand sale of which were discontinued in 1915.\r\n\r\nIn 1905, a celebrated case was decided in Kansas City involving\r\nlitigation between William E. Baker, of Baker & Co., Minneapolis, and\r\nthe F.A. Duncombe Manufacturing Co., of St. Joseph, Mo., over Mr.\r\nBaker's patent rights in a machine to produce steel-cut coffee. The suit\r\nwas brought in 1903, and Mr. Baker contended that his patent gave him\r\nthe exclusive right to the \"uniformity of granules by means of the\r\nsharply dressed mechanism\" and by the use of a fan for blowing away the\r\nsilver skins, produced by his machine; while the defendant said he\r\nobtained the same result (steel-cut coffee) by grading the granules\r\nthrough screens or sieves. The defense was that Mr. Baker's process was\r\nnot a discovery; because, grinding coffee was as old as the world's\r\nknowledge, and winnowing the chaff was equally ancient. The lower court\r\ndismissed the bill, because the \"patents sued upon are devoid of\r\npatentable invention\"; and the United States Court of Appeals confirmed\r\nthe decision.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTERPRISE HAND STORE MILL]\r\n\r\nIn 1905, Frederick A. Cauchois, of New York, brought out his Private\r\nEstate coffee maker, a clever combination of the French drip and filter\r\nprocesses, employing a thin layer of Japanese paper as a filtering\r\nagent. The same year, Finley Acker, of Philadelphia, was granted a\r\nUnited States patent on a percolator employing two cylinders, perforated\r\non the sides, with a sheet of percolator paper placed between them to\r\nact as a filtering medium.\r\n\r\nIn 1906, George Savage and J.W. Chapman, assignors to Manning, Bowman &\r\nCo. of Meriden, Conn., were granted a United States patent on a coffee\r\npercolator.\r\n\r\nIn 1906, Alonzo A. Warner, assignor to Landers, Frary & Clark, New\r\nBritain, Conn., was granted a United States patent on a coffee\r\npercolator.\r\n\r\nIn 1906, H.D. Kelly, Kansas City, was granted a United States patent on\r\nthe Kellum Automatic coffee urn, employing a coffee extractor in which\r\nground coffee is continually agitated before percolation by a vacuum\r\nprocess. Sixteen patents followed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LATEST TYPES OF ELECTRICALLY DRIVEN STORE MILLS]\r\n\r\nIn 1907, Desiderio Pavoni, of Milan, Italy, was granted a patent in\r\nItaly for an improvement on the Bezzara system for preparing and serving\r\ncoffee as a rapid infusion of a single cup, first introduced in\r\n1903-1904. It is known as the Ideale urn, and makes 150 cups per hour.\r\nAmong other Italian rapid coffee-making machines which, with this one,\r\nhave attained considerable prominence in Europe and South America,\r\nmention should be made of La Victoria Arduino made by Pier Teresio\r\nArduino, of Turin, Italy, introduced in 1909, that makes 1000 cups per\r\nhour. It was patented in the United States in 1920. There are, also,\r\nL'Italiana Sovereign Filter Machine (1440 cups per hour) made by Bossi,\r\nVernetti & Bartolini, Turin, (subsequently merged with La Victoria\r\nArduino-Societa Anonima); and José Baro's Express, Buenos Aires, making\r\n600 cups an hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE IDEALE MACHINE (CENTER) MAKES 150 CUPS OF COFFEE AN\r\nHOUR. THE MACHINE AT THE LEFT MAKES 1,000 CUPS AN HOUR\r\n\r\nA MACHINE OF THE TYPE OF THE ONE AT THE RIGHT WILL PRODUCE FROM 1,440 TO\r\n1,800 CUPS OF COFFEE AN HOUR\r\n\r\nTYPES OF ITALIAN RAPID COFFEE-MAKING MACHINES]\r\n\r\nIn 1908, A.E. White, Chicago, was granted a United States patent on a\r\ncoffee urn. He assigned it to the James Heekin Co., of Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nIn 1908, I.D. Richheimer, Chicago, introduced his Tricolator to the\r\ntrade and the consumer. This is an aluminum device to fit any coffee\r\npot, combining French drip and filtration ideas, with Japanese paper as\r\nthe filtration medium.\r\n\r\nIn 1908, an improved type of Burns roaster was patented in the United\r\nStates. The improvement consisted of an open perforated cylinder with\r\nflexible back-head and balanced front bearing. The following year, the\r\nBurns tilting sample-roaster for gas or electric heating units was\r\npatented.\r\n\r\nIn 1909, Frederick A. Cauchois, of New York, was granted a United States\r\npatent on a coffee urn fitted with a centrifugal pump for repouring.\r\n\r\nIn 1909, C.F. Blanke, of St. Louis, was granted two United States\r\npatents on a china coffee pot with a cloth filter, the sides tightly,\r\nand the bottom loosely, woven.\r\n\r\nIn 1911, Edward Aborn, of New York, was granted a United States patent\r\non his Make-Right coffee-filter device. This was later incorporated with\r\nimprovements in a Tru-Bru coffee pot, on which he was granted another\r\npatent in 1920.\r\n\r\nIn 1912, John E. King, of Detroit, was granted a United States patent on\r\nan improved coffee percolator for restaurants, employing a sheet of\r\nfilter paper on a ring in a metal basket; the ring to be removed once\r\nthe filter paper was in position on the perforated bottom plate of the\r\npercolator basket.\r\n\r\nIn 1913, F.F. Wear, Los Angeles, perfected a coffee-making device in\r\nwhich a metal perforated clamp was employed to apply a filter paper to\r\nthe under-side of an English earthenware adaptation of the French drip\r\npot.\r\n\r\nIn 1912, William Lawton demonstrated in London a gas coffee roaster of\r\nhis own invention, by means of which he roasted coffee \"in suspension\"\r\nto a light brown color in three minutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOWING HOW THE ITALIAN RAPID COFFEE MACHINE WORKS\r\n\r\nLeft, putting coffee in the filter--Center, applying filter to\r\nfaucet--Right, turning on water and steam to make the drink]\r\n\r\nHerbert L. Johnston, assignor to the Hobart Electric Manufacturing Co.,\r\nTroy, Ohio, was granted a United States patent on a machine for refining\r\ncoffee in 1913.\r\n\r\nIn 1914, the Phylax coffee maker, embodying an improvement on the French\r\ndrip principle, was introduced to the trade. The process was\r\ndemonstrated by Benjamin H. Calkin, of Detroit, in 1921, as \"an art of\r\nbrewing coffee.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA VICTORIA ARDUINO MIGNONNE\r\n\r\nAn electric rapid coffee maker]\r\n\r\nIn 1914, Robert Burns, assignor to Jabez Burns & Sons, New York, was\r\ngranted a United States patent on a coffee-granulating mill.\r\n\r\nIn 1914-15, Herbert Galt, of Chicago, was granted three United States\r\npatents on the Gait coffee pot, made of aluminum, and having two parts,\r\na removable cylinder employing the French drip principle, and the\r\ncontaining pot.\r\n\r\nIn 1915, the Burns Jubilee (inner-heated) gas coffee roaster was\r\npatented in the United States and put on the market.\r\n\r\nIn 1915, the National Coffee Roasters Association Home coffee mill,\r\nemploying an improved set screw operating on a cog-and ratchet\r\nprinciple, was introduced to the trade.\r\n\r\nIn 1916, a United States patent was granted to I.D. Richheimer, Chicago,\r\nfor an infuser improvement on his Tricolator.\r\n\r\nIn 1916, Saul Blickman, assignor to S. Blickman, New York, was granted a\r\nUnited States patent on an apparatus for making and dispensing coffee.\r\n\r\nIn 1916, Orville W. Chamberlain, New Orleans, was granted a United\r\nStates patent on an automatic drip coffee pot.\r\n\r\nIn 1916, Jules Le Page, Darlington, Ind., obtained two United States\r\npatents on cutting rolls to cut--and not to grind or crush--corn, wheat,\r\nor coffee. These were subsequently incorporated in the Ideal steel-cut\r\ncoffee mill and marketed to the trade by the B.F. Gump Co., Chicago.\r\n\r\nIn 1917, Richard A. Greene and William G. Burns, assignors to Jabez\r\nBurns & Sons, New York, were granted patents in the United States on\r\nthe Burns flexible-arm cooler (for roasted batches) providing full\r\nfan-suction to a cooler box at all points in its track travel.\r\n\r\nIn 1919, Joseph F. Smart, assignor to Landers, Frary & Clark, New\r\nBritain, Conn., was granted a United States patent on a percolator.\r\n\r\nIn 1919, Charles Morgan, assignor to the Arcade Manufacturing Co.,\r\nFreeport, Ill., was granted a United States patent on an improved\r\ngrinding mill.\r\n\r\nIn 1919, Edward F. Schnuck, assignor to Jabez Burns & Sons, New York,\r\nwas granted a United States patent on an improvement for a gas coffee\r\nroaster. In 1920, he was granted a United States patent on an improved\r\nprocess of twice cutting coffee and removing the chaff after each\r\ncutting.\r\n\r\nIn 1920, Natale de Mattei, of Turin, Italy, was granted a United States\r\npatent on a rapid coffee-filtering machine.\r\n\r\nIn 1920, Frederick H. Muller, of Chicago, was granted a United States\r\npatent on \"an art of making coffee,\" and on an improved apparatus for\r\nhotels and restaurants, which comprised a series of superposed metal\r\ncontainers, or cartridges, of ground coffee placed in a perforated\r\nbucket designed to rest in a coffee urn, the cartridges being lifted out\r\nas the boiling water poured on them sinks with the drawing off of the\r\n\"decoction\" at the faucet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE N.C.R.A. HOME COFFEE MILL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MANTHEY-ZORN RAPID COFFEE INFUSER AND DISPENSER]\r\n\r\nIn 1920, Alfredo M. Salazar, of New York, was granted a United States\r\npatent on a coffee urn in which the coffee is made at the time of\r\nserving by using steam pressure to force the boiling water through\r\nground coffee held in a cloth sack attached to the faucet.\r\n\r\nIn 1920, William H. Bruning, Evansville, Ind., was granted a United\r\nStates patent on an improved French drip pot made of aluminum and\r\nprovided with a vacuum jacket in the dripper section, and a hot-water\r\njacket in the serving portion, to keep the beverage hot.\r\n\r\nIn 1921, the Manthey-Zorn Laboratories Co., of Cleveland, brought out a\r\nrapid coffee-infuser and dispenser employing in the infuser a\r\ncentrifugal to make an extract in thirty-eight seconds, and designed to\r\ndeliver a gallon of concentrated liquid, or coffee base, every three\r\nminutes. The dispenser automatically combines the coffee base with\r\nboiling water in a differential faucet in the proportion desired,\r\nusually one of base to four of water. The dispenser serves 600 cups per\r\nhour. An additional faucet may be added which will double the capacity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TRICOLETTE, A PAPER-FILTER DEVICE FOR A SINGLE CUP\r\n\r\nAbove; In position on cup--Below; opened, showing parts]\r\n\r\nAmong foreign coffee makers applying the French drip principle, the\r\nVienna coffee-making machine, known in the United States as the Bohemian\r\ncoffee pot, has met with much favor in this country. Elsewhere it is\r\nknown as the Carlsbad. It is made of china, and the European\r\nmanufacturer has a patent on the porcelain strainer, or grid, which is\r\nprovided with slits that are very fine on the inner side but that widen\r\non the outer side to permit careful straining and to facilitate\r\ncleaning.\r\n\r\nSome of the latest developments in coffee apparatus were shown at the\r\nindustrial exposition at the National Coffee Roasters Association, held\r\nin New York, November 1-3, 1921. Among items of distinction not\r\nheretofore included in this work, mention should be made of: an\r\nAmerican-French coffee biggin, being a French drip pot made of American\r\nporcelain and fitted with a muslin strainer; a glass urn-liner, intended\r\nto supplant the porcelain liner; and an electric repouring pump,\r\ndesigned to be attached to any type of coffee urn.\r\n\r\nCareful research of the records of the United States patent office\r\ndiscloses that the number of patents relating to coffee apparatus and\r\ncoffee preparations, issued from 1789 to 1921, is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES COFFEE PATENTS\r\n\r\n_Devices_                                          _Patents_\r\nCoffee Mills                                             185\r\nCoffee-roasting devices, and improvements thereon        312\r\nCoffee-making devices                                    835\r\nCoffee-cleaning, hulling, drying, polishing,\r\n  and plantation machinery in general                    175\r\nMiscellaneous patents (for coating, glazing, treated\r\n  coffees, substitutes, etc.)                            300\r\n                                                      ________\r\n\r\n      Total                                            1,807\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that there was a number of patents granted on\r\nmachines that were intended for, and used for, coffee, but that did not\r\nmention coffee in the specifications. Many coffee driers were listed as\r\n\"grain driers,\" for instance. Also, many excellent devices have been\r\nmade that were never patented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nWORLD'S COFFEE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS\r\n\r\n     _How coffee is roasted, prepared, and served in all the leading\r\n     civilized countries--The Arabian coffee ceremony--The present-day\r\n     coffee houses of Turkey--Twentieth-century improvements in Europe\r\n     and the United States_\r\n\r\n\r\nCoffee manners and customs have shown little change in the Orient in the\r\nsix hundred-odd years since the coffee drink was discovered by Sheik\r\nOmar in Arabia. As a beverage for western peoples, however, and more\r\nparticularly in America, there have been many improvements in making and\r\nserving it.\r\n\r\nA brief survey of the coffee conventions and coffee service in the\r\nprincipal countries where coffee has become a fixed item in the dietary\r\nis presented here, with a view to show how different peoples have\r\nadapted the universal drink to their national needs and preferences.\r\n\r\nTo proceed in alphabetical order, and beginning with Africa, coffee\r\ndrinking is indulged in largely in Abyssinia, Algeria, Egypt, Portuguese\r\nEast Africa, and the Union of South Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Manners and Customs in Africa_\r\n\r\nIn Abyssinia and Somaliland, among the native population, the most\r\nprimitive methods of coffee making still obtain. Here the wandering\r\nGalla still mix their pulverized coffee beans with fats as a food\r\nration, and others of the native tribes favor the _kisher_, or beverage\r\nmade from the toasted coffee hulls. An hour's boiling produces a\r\nstraw-colored decoction, of a slightly sweetish taste. Where the Arabian\r\ncustoms have taken root, the drink is prepared from the roasted beans\r\nafter the Arabian and Turkish method. The white inhabitants usually\r\nprepare and serve the beverage as in the homeland; so that it is\r\npossible to obtain it after the English, French, German, Greek, or\r\nItalian styles. Adaptations of the French sidewalk café, and of the\r\nTurkish coffee house, may be seen in the larger towns.\r\n\r\nIn the equatorial provinces of Egypt, and in Uganda, the natives eat the\r\nraw berries; or first cook them in boiling water, dry them in the sun,\r\nand then eat them. It is a custom to exchange coffee beans in friendly\r\ngreeting.\r\n\r\nIndividual earthen vessels for making coffee, painted red and yellow,\r\nare made by some of the native tribes in Abyssinia, and usually\r\naccompany disciples of Islam when they journey to Mecca, where the\r\nvessels find a ready sale among the pilgrims, most of whom are\r\ncoffee-devotees.\r\n\r\nTurkish and Arabian coffee customs prevail in Algeria and Egypt,\r\nmodified to some extent by European contact. The Moorish cafés of Cairo,\r\nTunis, and Algiers have furnished inspiration and copy for writers,\r\nartists, and travelers for several centuries. They change little with\r\nthe years. The _mazagran_--sweetened cold coffee to which water or ice\r\nhas been added--originated in Algeria. It probably took its name from\r\nthe fortress of the same name reserved to France by the treaty of the\r\nTafna in 1837. It is said that the French colonial troops were first\r\nserved with a drink made from coffee syrup and cold water on marches\r\nnear Mazagran, formerly spelled Masagran. Upon their return to the\r\nFrench capital, they introduced the idea, with the added fillip of\r\nservice in tall glasses, in their favorite cafés, where it became known\r\nas _café mazagran_. Variants are coffee syrup with seltzer, and with\r\nhot water. \"This fashion of serving coffee in glasses\", says Jardin,\r\n\"has no _raison d'être_, and nothing can justify abandoning the cup for\r\ncoffee.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOORISH COFFEE HOUSE IN ALGIERS]\r\n\r\nIn the principal streets and public squares of any town in Algeria it is\r\na common sight to find a group of Arabs squatting about a portable\r\nstove, and a table on which cups are in readiness to receive the boiling\r\ncoffee. The thirsty Arab approaches the dealer, and for a modest sum he\r\ngets his drink and goes his way; unless he prefers to go inside the\r\ncafé, where he may get several drinks and linger over them, sitting on a\r\nmat with his legs crossed and smoking his _chibouque_. Indeed, this is a\r\ntypical scene throughout the Near East, where sheds or coffee\r\ntents--sketches of the more pretentious coffee houses--coffee shops, and\r\nitinerant coffee-venders are to be met at almost every turn.\r\n\r\nIn an unpublished work, Baron Antoine Rousseau and Th. Roland de Bussy\r\nhave the following description of a typical Moorish café at Algiers:\r\n\r\n     We entered without ceremony into a narrow deep cave, decorated with\r\n     the name of the café. On the right and on the left, along its\r\n     length, were two benches covered with mats; notched cups, tongs, a\r\n     box of brown sugar, all placed near a small stove, completed the\r\n     furniture of the place. In the evening, the dim light from a lamp\r\n     hanging from the ceiling shows the indistinct figures of a double\r\n     row of natives listening to the nasal cadences of a band who play a\r\n     pizzicato accompaniment on small three-stringed violins.\r\n\r\n     Here, as in Europe, the cafés are the providential rendezvous for\r\n     idlers and gossips, exchanges for real-estate brokers and players\r\n     at cards.\r\n\r\n     Europeans recently arrived frequent them particularly. Some go only\r\n     to satisfy their curiosity; others out of an inborn scorn for the\r\n     customs of civilization. They go to sleep as Frenchmen, they awake\r\n     Mohammedans! Their love for \"Turkish art\" only leads them to haunt\r\n     the native shops and to affect oriental poses.\r\n\r\n     If we quit for a moment the interior of the city to follow between\r\n     two hedgerows of mastics or aloes, one of those capricious paths\r\n     which lead one, now up to the summit of a hill, now to the depths\r\n     of some ravine, very soon the tones of a rustic flute, the\r\n     modulations of the _Djou-wak_, will betray some cool and peaceful\r\n     retreat, some rustic café, easily recognized by its facade, pierced\r\n     with large openings. To my eyes, nothing equals the charm of these\r\n     little buildings scattered here and there along the edges of a\r\n     stream, sheltered under the thick foliage, and constantly enlivened\r\n     by the coming and going of the husbandmen of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n     Certain old Moors from the neighboring districts, fleeing the\r\n     noises of the city, are the faithful habitués of these agreeable\r\n     retreats. Here they instal themselves at dawn, and know how to\r\n     enjoy every moment of their day with tales of their travels and\r\n     youthful adventures, and many a legend for which their imagination\r\n     takes all the responsibility.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE HOUSE IN CAIRO]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HULLING COFFEE IN ADEN, ARABIA]\r\n\r\nGérôme's painting of the \"Coffee House at Cairo,\" which hangs in the\r\nMetropolitan Museum of Art, New York, gives one a good idea of the\r\natmosphere of the Egyptian café. The preparation and service is modified\r\nTurkish-Arabian. The coffee is ground to a powder, boiled in an _ibrik_\r\nwith the addition of sugar, and served frothing in small cups.\r\nStory-tellers, singers, and dancers furnish amusement as of yore. The\r\nOriental customs have not changed much in this respect. Trolley cars,\r\nvictorias, and taxis may have replaced the donkeys in the new sections\r\nof the larger Egyptian cities; but in old Alexandria and Cairo, the\r\napproach to the native coffee house is as dirty and as odorous as ever.\r\nCoffee is always served in all business transactions. Nowadays, the\r\nEgyptian women chew gum and the men smoke cigarettes, French department\r\nstores offer bargain sales, and the hotels advertise tea dances; but the\r\nEgyptian coffee drink is still the tiny cup of coffee grounds and sugar\r\nthat it was three hundred years ago, when sugar was first used to\r\nsweeten coffee in Cairo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE SERVICE AT A BARBER SHOP IN CAIRO]\r\n\r\nIn Portuguese East Africa, the natives prepare and drink coffee after\r\nthe approved African native fashion, but the white population follows\r\nEuropean customs. In the Union of South Africa, Dutch and English\r\ncustoms prevail in making and serving the beverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manners and Customs in Asia_\r\n\r\n\"Arabia the Happy\" deserves to be called \"the Blest\", if only for its\r\ngift of coffee to the world. Here it was that the virtues of the drink\r\nwere first made known; here the plant first received intensive\r\ncultivation. After centuries of habitual use of the beverage, we find\r\nthe Arabs, now as then, one of the strongest and noblest races of the\r\nworld, mentally superior to most of them, generally healthy, and growing\r\nold so gracefully that the faculties of the mind seldom give way sooner\r\nthan those of the body. They are an ever living earnest of the\r\nhealthfulness of coffee.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs are proverbially hospitable; and the symbol of their\r\nhospitality for a thousand years has been the great drink of\r\ndemocracy--coffee. Their very houses are built around the cup of human\r\nbrotherhood. William Wallace,[366] writing on Arabian philosophy,\r\nmanners, and customs, says:\r\n\r\n     The principal feature of an Arab house is the _kahwah_ or coffee\r\n     room. It is a large apartment spread with mats, and sometimes\r\n     furnished with carpets and a few cushions. At one end is a small\r\n     furnace or fireplace for preparing coffee. In this room the men\r\n     congregate; here guests are received, and even lodged; women rarely\r\n     enter it, except at times when strangers are unlikely to be\r\n     present. Some of these apartments are very spacious and supported\r\n     by pillars; one wall is usually built transversely to the compass\r\n     direction of the _Ka'ba_ (sacred shrine of Mecca). It serves to\r\n     facilitate the performance of prayer by those who may happen to be\r\n     in the _kahwah_ at the appointed times.\r\n\r\nSeveral rounds of coffee, without milk or sugar, but sometimes flavored\r\nwith cardamom seeds, are served to the guest at first welcome; and\r\ncoffee may be had at all hours between meals, or whenever the occasion\r\ndemands it. Always the beans are freshly roasted, pounded, and boiled.\r\nThe Arabs average twenty-five to thirty cups (findjans) a day.\r\nEverywhere in Arabia there are to be found cafés where the beverage may\r\nbe bought.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHIPS OF THE DESERT LADEN WITH COFFEE, ARABIA]\r\n\r\nThose of the lower classes are thronged throughout the day. In front,\r\nthere is generally a porch or bench where one may sit. The rooms,\r\nbenches, and little chairs lack the cleanliness and elegance of the\r\none-time luxurious \"_caffinets_\" of cities like Damascus and\r\nConstantinople, but the drink is the same. There is not in all Yemen a\r\nsingle market town or hamlet where one does not find upon some simple\r\nhut the legend, \"Shed for drinking coffee\".\r\n\r\nThe Arab drinks water before taking coffee, but never after it. \"Once in\r\nSyria\", says a traveler, \"I was recognized as a foreigner because I\r\nasked for water just after I had taken my coffee. 'If you belonged\r\nhere', said the waiter, 'you would not spoil the taste of coffee in your\r\nmouth by washing it away with water.'\"\r\n\r\nIt is an adventure to partake of coffee prepared in the open, at a\r\nroadside inn, or khan, in Arabia by an _araba_, or diligence driver. He\r\ntakes from his saddle-bag the ever-present coffee kit, containing his\r\nsupply of green beans, of which he roasts just sufficient on a little\r\nperforated iron plate over an open fire, deftly taking off the beans,\r\none at a time, as they turn the right color. Then he pounds them in a\r\nmortar, boils his water in the long, straight-handled open boiler, or\r\n_ibrik_ (a sort of brass mug or _jezveh_), tosses in the coffee powder,\r\nmoving the vessel back and forth from the fire as it boils up to the\r\nrim; and, after repeating this maneuver three times, pours the contents\r\nfoaming merrily into the little egg-like serving cups.\r\n\r\n_Cafée sultan_, or _kisher_, the original decoction, made from dried and\r\ntoasted coffee hulls, is still being drunk in parts of Arabia and\r\nTurkey.\r\n\r\nCoffee in Arabia is part of the ritual of business, as in other Oriental\r\ncountries. Shop-keepers serve it to the customer before the argument\r\nstarts. Recently, a New York barber got some valuable publicity because\r\nhe regaled his customers with tea and music. It was \"old stuff\". The\r\nArabian and Turkish barber shops have been serving coffee, tobacco, and\r\nsweetmeats to their customers for centuries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ARABIAN COFFEE HOUSE]\r\n\r\nFor a faithful description of the ancient coffee ceremony of the Arabs,\r\nwhich, with slight modification, is still observed in Arabian homes, we\r\nturn to Palgrave. First he describes the dwelling and then the ceremony:\r\n\r\n     The K'hawah was a large oblong hall, about twenty feet in\r\n     height, fifty in length, and sixteen, or thereabouts, in breadth;\r\n     the walls were coloured in a rudely decorative manner with brown\r\n     and white wash, and sunk here and there into small triangular\r\n     recesses, destined to the reception of books, though of these\r\n     Ghafil at least had no over-abundance, lamps, and other such like\r\n     objects. The roof of timber, and flat; the floor was strewed with\r\n     fine clean sand, and garnished all round alongside of the walls\r\n     with long strips of carpet, upon which cushions, covered with faded\r\n     silk, were disposed at suitable intervals. In poorer houses felt\r\n     rugs usually take the place of carpets.\r\n\r\n     In one corner, namely, that furthest removed from the door, stood a\r\n     small fireplace, or, to speak more exactly, furnace, formed of a\r\n     large square block of granite, or some other hard stone, about\r\n     twenty inches each way; this is hollowed inwardly into a deep\r\n     funnel, open above, and communicating below with a small horizontal\r\n     tube or pipe-hole, through which the air passes, bellows-driven, to\r\n     the lighted charcoal piled up on a grating about half-way inside\r\n     the cone. In this manner the fuel is soon brought to a white heat,\r\n     and the water in the coffee-pot placed upon the funnel's mouth is\r\n     readily brought to boil. The system of coffee furnaces is universal\r\n     in Djowf and Djebel Shomer, but in Nejed itself, and indeed in\r\n     whatever other yet more distant regions of Arabia I visited to the\r\n     south and east, the furnace is replaced by an open fireplace\r\n     hollowed in the ground floor, with a raised stone border, and\r\n     dog-irons for the fuel, and so forth, like what may be yet seen in\r\n     Spain. This diversity of arrangement, so far as Arabia is\r\n     concerned, is due to the greater abundance of firewood in the\r\n     south, whereby the inhabitants are enabled to light up on a larger\r\n     scale; whereas throughout the Djowf and Djebel Shomer wood is very\r\n     scarce, and the only fuel at hand is bad charcoal, often brought\r\n     from a considerable distance, and carefully husbanded.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: BREWING THE GUEST'S COFFEE IN A MOHAMMEDAN HOME]\r\n\r\n     This corner of the K'hawah is also the place of distinction\r\n     whence honour and coffee radiate by progressive degrees round the\r\n     apartment, and hereabouts accordingly sits the master of the house\r\n     himself, or the guests whom he more especially delighteth to\r\n     honour.\r\n\r\n     On the broad edge of the furnace or fireplace, as the case may be,\r\n     stands an ostentatious range of copper coffee-pots, varying in size\r\n     and form. Here in the Djowf their make resembles that in vogue at\r\n     Damascus; but in Nejed and the eastern districts they are of a\r\n     different and much more ornamental fashioning, very tall and\r\n     slender, with several ornamental circles and mouldings in elegant\r\n     relief, besides boasting long beak-shaped spouts and high steeples\r\n     for covers. The number of these utensils is often extravagantly\r\n     great. I have seen a dozen at a time in a row by one fireside,\r\n     though coffee-making requires, in fact, only three at most. Here in\r\n     the Djowf five or six are considered to be the thing; for the south\r\n     this number must be doubled; all this to indicate the riches and\r\n     munificence of their owner, by implying the frequency of his guests\r\n     and the large amount of coffee that he is in consequence obliged to\r\n     have made for them.\r\n\r\n     Behind this stove sits, at least in wealthy houses, a black slave,\r\n     whose name is generally a diminutive in token of familiarity or\r\n     affection; in the present case it was Soweylim, the diminutive of\r\n     Salim. His occupation is to make and pour out the coffee; where\r\n     there is no slave in the family, the master of the premises\r\n     himself, or perhaps one of his sons, performs that hospitable duty;\r\n     rather a tedious one, as we shall soon see.\r\n\r\n     We enter. On passing the threshold it is proper to say,\r\n     \"_Bismillah_, _i.e._, in the name of God;\" not to do so would be\r\n     looked on as a bad augury alike for him who enters and for those\r\n     within. The visitor next advances in silence, till on coming about\r\n     half-way across the room, he gives to all present, but looking\r\n     specially at the master of the house, the customary\r\n     \"_Es-salamu'aleykum_,\" or \"Peace be with you,\" literally, \"on you.\"\r\n     All this while every one else in the room has kept his place,\r\n     motionless, and without saying a word. But on receiving the salaam\r\n     of etiquette, the master of the house rises, and if a strict\r\n     Wahhabee, or at any rate desirous of seeming such, replies with\r\n     the full-length traditionary formula. \"_W' 'aleykumu-s-salamu,\r\n     w'rahmat' Ullahi w'barakátuh_,\" which is, as every one knows, \"And\r\n     with (or, on) you be peace, and the mercy of God, and his\r\n     blessings.\" But should he happen to be of anti-Wahhabee\r\n     tendencies the odds are that he will say \"_Marhaba_,\" or \"_Ahlan w'\r\n     sahlan_,\" _i.e._, \"welcome\" or \"worthy, and pleasurable,\" or the\r\n     like; for of such phrases there is an infinite, but elegant\r\n     variety.\r\n\r\n     All present follow the example thus given, by rising and saluting.\r\n     The guest then goes up to the master of the house, who has also\r\n     made a step or two forwards, and places his open hand in the palm\r\n     of his host's, but without grasping or shaking, which would hardly\r\n     pass for decorous, and at the same time each repeats once more his\r\n     greeting, followed by the set phrases of polite enquiry, \"How are\r\n     you?\" \"How goes the world with you?\" and so forth, all in a tone of\r\n     great interest, and to be gone over three or four times, till one\r\n     or other has the discretion to say \"_El hamdu l'illah_,\" \"Praise\r\n     be to God\", or, in equivalent value, \"all right,\" and this is a\r\n     signal for a seasonable diversion to the ceremonious interrogatory.\r\n\r\n     The guest then, after a little contest of courtesy, takes his seat\r\n     in the honoured post by the fireplace, after an apologetical\r\n     salutation to the black slave on the one side, and to his nearest\r\n     neighbour on the other. The best cushions and newest looking\r\n     carpets have been of course prepared for his honoured weight. Shoes\r\n     or sandals, for in truth the latter alone are used in Arabia, are\r\n     slipped off on the sand just before reaching the carpet, and there\r\n     they remain on the floor close by. But the riding stick or wand,\r\n     the inseparable companion of every true Arab, whether Bedouin or\r\n     townsman, rich or poor, gentle or simple, is to be retained in the\r\n     hand, and will serve for playing with during the pauses of\r\n     conversation, like the fan of our great-grandmothers in their days\r\n     of conquest.\r\n\r\n     Without delay Soweylim begins his preparations for coffee. These\r\n     open by about five minutes of blowing with the bellows and\r\n     arranging the charcoal till a sufficient heat has been produced.\r\n     Next he places the largest of the coffee-pots, a huge machine, and\r\n     about two-thirds full of clear water, close by the edge of the\r\n     glowing coal-pit, that its contents may become gradually warm while\r\n     other operations are in progress. He then takes a dirty knotted rag\r\n     out of a niche in the wall close by, and having untied it, empties\r\n     out of it three or four handfuls of unroasted coffee, the which he\r\n     places on a little trencher of platted grass, and picks carefully\r\n     out any blackened grains, or other non-homologous substances,\r\n     commonly to be found intermixed with the berries when purchased in\r\n     gross; then, after much cleansing and shaking, he pours the grain\r\n     so cleansed into a large open iron ladle, and places it over the\r\n     mouth of the funnel, at the same time blowing the bellows and\r\n     stirring the grains gently round and round till they crackle,\r\n     redden, and smoke a little, but carefully withdrawing them from the\r\n     heat long before they turn black or charred, after the erroneous\r\n     fashion of Turkey and Europe; after which he puts them to cool a\r\n     moment on the grass platter.\r\n\r\n     He then sets the warm water in the large coffee-pot over the fire\r\n     aperture, that it may be ready boiling at the right moment, and\r\n     draws in close between his own trouserless legs a large stone\r\n     mortar, with a narrow pit in the middle, just enough to admit the\r\n     large stone pestle of a foot long and an inch and a half thick,\r\n     which he now takes in hand. Next, pouring the half-roasted berries\r\n     into the mortar, he proceeds to pound them, striking right into the\r\n     narrow hollow with wonderful dexterity, nor ever missing his blow\r\n     till the beans are smashed, but not reduced into powder. He then\r\n     scoops them out, now reduced to a sort of coarse reddish grit, very\r\n     unlike the fine charcoal dust which passes in some countries for\r\n     coffee, and out of which every particle of real aroma has long\r\n     since been burnt or ground.\r\n\r\n     After all these operations, each performed with as intense a\r\n     seriousness and deliberate nicety as if the welfare of the entire\r\n     Djowf depended on it, he takes a smaller coffee-pot in hand, fills\r\n     it more than half with hot water from the larger vessel, and then\r\n     shaking the pounded coffee into it, sets it on the fire to boil,\r\n     occasionally stirring it with a small stick as the water rises to\r\n     check the ebullition and prevent overflowing. Nor is the boiling\r\n     stage to be long or vehement: on the contrary, it is and should be\r\n     as light as possible. In the interim he takes out of another\r\n     rag-knot a few aromatic seeds called heyl, an Indian product, but\r\n     of whose scientific name I regret to be wholly ignorant, or a\r\n     little saffron, and after slightly pounding these ingredients,\r\n     throws them into the simmering coffee to improve its flavour, for\r\n     such an additional spicing is held indispensable in Arabia though\r\n     often omitted elsewhere in the East. Sugar would be a totally\r\n     unheard of profanation. Last of all, he strains off the liquor\r\n     through some fibres of the inner palm-bark placed for that purpose\r\n     in the jug-spout, and gets ready the tray of delicate\r\n     parti-coloured grass, and the small coffee cups ready for pouring\r\n     out. All these preliminaries have taken up a good half-hour.\r\n\r\n     Meantime we have become engaged in active conversation with our\r\n     host and his friends. But our Sherarat guide, Suleyman, like a true\r\n     Bedouin, feels too awkward when among townsfolk to venture on the\r\n     upper places, though repeatedly invited, and accordingly has\r\n     squatted down on the sand near the entrance. Many of Ghafil's\r\n     relations are present; their silver-decorated swords proclaim the\r\n     importance of the family. Others, too, have come to receive us, for\r\n     our arrival, announced beforehand by those we had met at the\r\n     entrance pass, is a sort of event in the town; the dress of some\r\n     betokens poverty, others are better clad, but all have a very\r\n     polite and decorous manner. Many a question is asked about our\r\n     native land and town, that is to say, Syria and Damascus,\r\n     conformably to the disguise already adopted, and which it was\r\n     highly important to keep well up; then follow enquiries regarding\r\n     our journey, our business, what we have brought with us, about our\r\n     medicines, our goods and wares, etc., etc. From the very first it\r\n     is easy for us to perceive that patients and purchasers are likely\r\n     to abound. Very few travelling merchants, if any, visit the Djowf\r\n     at this time of year, for one must be mad, or next door to it, to\r\n     rush into the vast desert around during the heats of June and July;\r\n     I for one have certainly no intention of doing it again. Hence we\r\n     had small danger of competitors, and found the market almost at our\r\n     absolute disposal.\r\n\r\n     But before a quarter of an hour has passed, and while blacky is\r\n     still roasting or pounding his coffee, a tall thin lad, Ghafil's\r\n     eldest son, appears, charged with a large circular dish,\r\n     grass-platted like the rest, and throws it with a graceful jerk on\r\n     the sandy floor close before us. He then produces a large wooden\r\n     bowl full of dates, bearing in the midst of the heap a cup full of\r\n     melted butter; all this he places on the circular mat, and says,\r\n     \"_Semmoo_,\" literally, \"pronounce the Name\", of God, understood;\r\n     this means \"set to work at it.\" Hereon the master of the house\r\n     quits his place by the fireside and seats himself on the sand\r\n     opposite to us; we draw nearer to the dish, and four or five\r\n     others, after some respectful coyness, join the circle. Every one\r\n     then picks out a date or two from the juicy half-amalgamated mass,\r\n     dips them into the butter, and thus goes on eating till he has had\r\n     enough, when he rises and washes his hands.\r\n\r\n     By this time the coffee is ready, and Soweylim begins his round,\r\n     the coffee-pot in one hand; the tray and cups on the other. The\r\n     first pouring out he must in etiquette drink himself, by way of a\r\n     practical assurance that there is no \"death in the pot;\" the guests\r\n     are next served, beginning with those next the honourable fireside;\r\n     the master of the house receives his cup last of all. To refuse\r\n     would be a positive and unpardonable insult; but one has not much\r\n     to swallow at a time, for the coffee-cups, or finjans, are about\r\n     the size of a large egg-shell at most, and are never more than\r\n     half-filled. This is considered essential to good breeding, and a\r\n     brimmer would here imply exactly the reverse of what it does in\r\n     Europe; why it should be so I hardly know, unless perhaps the\r\n     rareness of cup-stands or \"zarfs\" (see Lane's \"Modern Egyptians\")\r\n     in Arabia, though these implements are universal in Egypt and\r\n     Syria, might render an over-full cup inconveniently hot for the\r\n     fingers that must grasp it without medium. Be that as it may, \"fill\r\n     the cup for your enemy\" is an adage common to all, Bedouins or\r\n     townsmen, throughout the Peninsula. The beverage itself is\r\n     singularly aromatic and refreshing, a real tonic, and very\r\n     different from the black mud sucked by the Levantine, or the watery\r\n     roast-bean preparations of France. When the slave or freeman,\r\n     according to circumstances, presents you with a cup, he never fails\r\n     to accompany it with a \"_Semm'_,\" \"say the name of God,\" nor must\r\n     you take it without answering \"_Bismillah_.\"\r\n\r\n     When all have been thus served, a second round is poured out, but\r\n     in inverse order, for the host this time drinks first, and the\r\n     guests last. On special occasions, a first reception, for instance,\r\n     the ruddy liquor is a third time handed round; nay, a fourth cup is\r\n     sometimes added. But all these put together do not come up to\r\n     one-fourth of what a European imbibes in a single draught at\r\n     breakfast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NATIVE CAFÉ, HARAR, ABYSSINIA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY MANNER OF SERVING COFFEE, TEA AND CHOCOLATE\r\n\r\nFrom a drawing in Dufour's _Traités Nouveaux et Curieux du Café, du The\r\net du Chocolat_]\r\n\r\nFor a more recent pen picture of coffee manners and customs in Arabia,\r\nwe turn to Charles M. Daughty's \"_Travels in Arabia Deserta_\"[367]:\r\n\r\n     Hirfa ever demanded of her husband towards which part should \"the\r\n     house\" be built. \"Dress the face\". Zeyd would answer, \"to this\r\n     part\", showing her with his hands the south, for if his booth's\r\n     face be all day turned to the hot sun there will come in fewer\r\n     young loitering and parasitical fellows that would be his\r\n     coffee-drinkers. Since the _sheukh_, or heads, alone receive their\r\n     tribes' _surra_, it is not much that they should be to the arms [of\r\n     his] coffee-hosts. I have seen Zeyd avoid [them] as he saw them\r\n     approach, or even rise ungraciously upon such men's presenting\r\n     themselves (the half of every booth, namely the men's side, is at\r\n     all times open, and any enter there that will, in the free\r\n     desert), and they murmuring he tells them, _wellah_, his affairs do\r\n     call him forth, adieu; he must away to the _mejlis_; go they and\r\n     seek the coffee elsewhere. But were there any _sheykh_ with them, a\r\n     coffee lord, Zeyd could not honestly choose but abide and serve\r\n     them with coffee; and if he be absent himself, yet any _sheykhly_\r\n     man coming to a _sheykh's_ tent, coffee must be made for him,\r\n     except he gently protest \"_billah_, he would not drink.\" Hirfa, a\r\n     _sheykh's_ daughter and his nigh kinswoman, was a faithful mate to\r\n     Zeyd in all his sparing policy.\r\n\r\n     Our _menzil_ now standing, the men step over to Zeyd's coffee-fire,\r\n     if the _sheykh_ be not gone forth to the _mejlis_ to drink his\r\n     mid-day cup there. A few gathered sticks are flung down beside the\r\n     hearth; with flint and steel one stoops and strikes fire in tinder,\r\n     he blows and cherishes those seeds of the cheerful flame in some\r\n     dry camel-dung, sets the burning shred under dry straws, and\r\n     powders over more dry camel-dung. As the fire kindles, the _sheykh_\r\n     reaches for his _dellàl_, coffee pots, which are carried in the\r\n     _fatya_, coffee-gear basket; this people of a nomad life bestow\r\n     each thing of theirs in a proper _beyt_; it would otherwise be lost\r\n     in their daily removings. One rises to go to fill up the pots at\r\n     the water-skins, or a bowl of water is handed over the curtain from\r\n     the woman's side; the pot at the fire, Hirfa reaches over her\r\n     little palm-ful of green coffee berries.... These are roasted and\r\n     brayed; as all is boiling he sets out his little cups, _fenjeyl_\r\n     (for fenjeyn). When, with a pleasant gravity, he has unbuckled his\r\n     _gutia_ or cup-box, we see the nomad has not above three or four\r\n     fenjeyns, wrapt in a rusty clout, with which he scours them busily,\r\n     as if this should make his cups clean. The roasted beans are\r\n     pounded amongst Arabs with a magnanimous rattle--and (as all their\r\n     labor) rhythmical--in brass of the town, or an old wooden mortar,\r\n     gaily studded with nails, the work of some nomad smith. The water\r\n     bubbling in the small _dellàl_, he casts in his fine coffee powder,\r\n     _el-bunn_, and withdraws the pot to simmer a moment. From a knot in\r\n     his kerchief he takes then a head of cloves, a piece of cinnamon or\r\n     other spice, _bahar_, and braying these he casts their dust in\r\n     after. Soon he pours out some hot drops to essay his coffee; if the\r\n     taste be to his liking, making dexterously a nest of all the cups\r\n     in his hand, with pleasant clattering, he is ready to pour out for\r\n     all the company, and begins upon his right hand; and first, if such\r\n     be present, to any considerable _sheykh_ and principal persons. The\r\n     _fenjeyn kahwah_ is but four sips; to fill it up to a guest, as in\r\n     the northern towns, were among Bedouins an injury, and of such\r\n     bitter meaning, \"This drink thou and depart.\"\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: NUBIAN SLAVE GIRL WITH COFFEE SERVICE, PERSIA]\r\n\r\n     Then is often seen a contention in courtesy amongst them,\r\n     especially in any greater assemblies, who shall drink first. Some\r\n     man that receives the _fenjeyn_ in his turn will not drink yet--he\r\n     proffers it to one sitting in order under him, as to the more\r\n     honourable; but the other putting off with his hand will answer\r\n     _ebbeden_, \"Nay, it shall never be, by Ullah! but do thou drink.\"\r\n     Thus licensed, the humble man is despatched in three sips, and\r\n     hands up his empty _fenjeyn_. But if he have much insisted, by this\r\n     he opens his willingness to be reconciled with one not his friend.\r\n     That neighbor, seeing the company of coffee-drinkers watching him,\r\n     may with an honest grace receive the cup, and let it seem not\r\n     willingly; but an hard man will sometimes rebut the other's gentle\r\n     proffer.\r\n\r\n     Some may have taken lower seats than becoming their _sheykhly_\r\n     blood, of which the nomads are jealous; entering untimely, they sat\r\n     down out of order, sooner than trouble all the company. A _sheykh_,\r\n     coming late and any business going forward, will often sit far out\r\n     in the assembly; and show himself a popular person in this kind of\r\n     honourable humility. The more inward in the booth is the higher\r\n     place; where also is, with the _sheykhs_, the seat of a stranger.\r\n     To sit in the loose circuit without and before the tent, is for the\r\n     common sort. A tribesman arriving presents himself at that part or\r\n     a little lower, where in the eyes of all men his pretension will be\r\n     well allowed; and in such observances of good nurture, is a nomad\r\n     man's honour among his tribesmen. And this is nigh all that serves\r\n     the nomad for a conscience, namely, that which men will hold of\r\n     him. A poor person, approaching from behind, stands obscurely,\r\n     wrapped in his tattered mantle, with grave ceremonial, until those\r\n     sitting indolently before him in the sand shall vouchsafe to take\r\n     notice of him; then they rise unwillingly, and giving back enlarge\r\n     the coffee-circle to receive him. But if there arrive a _sheykh_, a\r\n     coffee-host, a richard amongst them of a few cattle, all the\r\n     coxcomb companions within will hail him with their pleasant\r\n     adulation _taad henneyi_, \"Step thou up hither.\"\r\n\r\n     The astute Fukara _sheukh_ surpass all men in their coffee-drinking\r\n     courtesy, and Zeyd himself was more than any large of this\r\n     gentlemen-like imposture: he was full of swaggering complacence and\r\n     compliments to an humbler person. With what suavity could he\r\n     encourage, and gently too compel a man, and rising himself yield\r\n     him parcel of another man's room! In such fashions Zeyd showed\r\n     himself a bountiful great man, who indeed was the greatest niggard.\r\n     The cups are drunk twice about, each one sipping after other's lips\r\n     without misliking; to the great coffee _sheykhs_ the cup may be\r\n     filled more times, but this is an adulation of the coffee-server.\r\n     There are some of the Fukara _sheukh_ so delicate Sybarites that of\r\n     those three bitter sips, to draw out all their joyance, twisting,\r\n     turning, and tossing again the cup, they could make ten. The\r\n     coffee-service ended, the grounds are poured out from the small\r\n     into the great store-pot that is reserved full of warm water; with\r\n     the bitter lye the nomads will make their next bever, and think\r\n     they spare coffee.\r\n\r\nHere is an Arabian recipe[368] for making coffee as given by Kadhi\r\nHodhat, the best informed man of his time:\r\n\r\n     Tadj-Eddin-Aid-Almaknab-ben-Yacoub-Mekki Molki, chief of all the\r\n     cantons of Hedjaz, (May God have mercy on him!) I learned it when\r\n     once in his company at the time of the Holy Feasts.... He informed\r\n     me that nothing is more beneficial than to drink cold water before\r\n     coffee, because it lessens the dryness of the coffee and thus taken\r\n     it does not cause insomnia to the same degree. The poet did not\r\n     forget to explain this manner of taking coffee:\r\n\r\nAs with art 'tis prepared, one should drink it with art.\r\nThe mere commonplace drinks one absorbs with free heart;\r\nBut this--once with care from the bright flame removed,\r\nAnd the lime set aside that its value has proved--\r\nTake it first in deep draughts, meditative and slow,\r\nQuit it now, now resume, thus imbibe with gusto;\r\nWhile charming the palate it burns yet enchants,\r\nIn the hour of its triumph the virtue it grants\r\nPenetrates every tissue; its powers condense.\r\nCirculate cheering warmths, bring new life to each sense.\r\nFrom the cauldron profound spiced aromas unseen\r\nMount to tease and delight your olfactories keen,\r\nThe while you inhale with felicity fraught,\r\nThe enchanting perfume that a zephyr has brought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PERSIAN COFFEE SERVICE, 1737]\r\n\r\nGone are the \"luxurious and magnificent\" coffee houses of Constantinople\r\n(if they ever existed--at least as we understand luxury and\r\nmagnificence) which first brought the beverage world-wide fame; such\r\n_caffinets_ as the one pictured by Thomas Allom and described by the\r\nRev. Robert Walsh, in _Constantinople, Illustrated_:\r\n\r\n     The caffinet, or coffee-house, is something more splendid, and the\r\n     Turk expends all his notions of finery and elegance on this, his\r\n     favorite place of indulgence. The edifice is generally decorated in\r\n     a very gorgeous manner, supported on pillars, and open in front. It\r\n     is surrounded on the inside by a raised platform, covered with mats\r\n     or cushions, on which the Turks sit cross-legged. On one side are\r\n     musicians, generally Greeks, with mandolins and tambourines,\r\n     accompanying singers, whose melody consists in vociferation; and\r\n     the loud and obstreperous concert forms a strong contrast to the\r\n     stillness and taciturnity of Turkish meetings. On the opposite side\r\n     are men, generally of a respectable class, some of whom are found\r\n     here every day, and all day long, dozing under the double influence\r\n     of coffee and tobacco. The coffee is served in very small cups, not\r\n     larger than egg-cups, grounds and all, without cream or sugar, and\r\n     so black, thick, and bitter that it has been aptly compared to\r\n     \"stewed soot\". Besides the ordinary chibouk for tobacco, there is\r\n     another implement, called narghillai, used for smoking in a\r\n     caffinet, of a more elaborate construction. It consists of a glass\r\n     vase, filled with water, and often scented with distilled rose or\r\n     other flowers. This is surmounted with a silver or brazen head,\r\n     from which issues a long flexible tube; a pipe-bowl is placed on\r\n     the top, and so constructed that the smoke is drawn, and comes\r\n     bubbling up through the water, cool and fragrant to the mouth. A\r\n     peculiar kind of tobacco, grown at Shiraz in Persia, and resembling\r\n     small pieces of cut leather, is used with this instrument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN A TURKISH COFFEE HOUSE]\r\n\r\nCertainly there never was any such thing as a coffee-house architecture.\r\nIt may be that up to the time of Abdul Hamid, when money was more\r\nplentiful than it has been for the past fifty years, there were coffee\r\nhouses more comfortably appointed than now exist.\r\n\r\nThe coffee house in a modernized form is, however, quite as numerous in\r\nTurkey as in the days of Amurath III and the notorious Kuprili.\r\n\r\nH.G. Dwight[369] writing on the present day Turkish coffee house, says:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROASTING COFFEE BEFORE A CAFÉ, TURKEY]\r\n\r\n     There are thoroughfares in any Turkish city that carry on almost no\r\n     other form of traffic. There is no quarter so miserable or so\r\n     remote as to be without one or two. They are the clubs of the\r\n     poorer classes. Men of a street, a trade, a province, or a\r\n     nationality--for a Turkish coffee-house may also be Albanian,\r\n     Armenian, Greek, Hebrew, Kurd, almost anything you please--meet\r\n     regularly when their work is done, at coffee-houses kept by their\r\n     own people. So much are the humbler coffee-houses frequented by a\r\n     fixed clientèle that a student of types or dialects may realize for\r\n     himself how truly they used to be called Schools of Knowledge.\r\n\r\n     The arrangement of a Turkish coffee-house is of the simplest. The\r\n     essential is that the place should provide the beverage for which\r\n     it exists and room for enjoying the same. A sketch of a coffee-shop\r\n     may often be seen on the street, in a scrap of shade or sunshine\r\n     according to the season, where a stool or two invite the passer-by\r\n     to a moment of contemplation. Larger establishments, though they\r\n     are rarely very large, are most often installed in a room longer\r\n     than it is wide, having as many windows as possible at the street\r\n     end and what we would call the bar at the other. It is a bar that\r\n     always makes me regret I do not etch, with its pleasing curves, its\r\n     high lights of brass and porcelain striking out of deep shadow, and\r\n     its usually picturesque _kahvehji_.\r\n\r\n     You do not stand at it. You sit on one of the benches running down\r\n     the sides of the room. They are more or less comfortably cushioned,\r\n     though sometimes higher and broader than a foreigner finds to his\r\n     taste. In that case you slip off your shoes, if you would do as the\r\n     Romans do, and tuck your feet up under you. A table stands in front\r\n     of you to hold your coffee--and often in summer an aromatic pot of\r\n     basil to keep the flies away. Chairs or stools are scattered about.\r\n     Decorative Arabic texts, sometimes wonderful prints, adorn the\r\n     walls. There may even be hanging rugs and china to entertain your\r\n     eyes. And there you are.\r\n\r\n     The habit of the coffee-house is one that requires a certain\r\n     leisure. You must not bolt coffee as you bolt the fire-waters of\r\n     the West, without ceremony, in retreats withdrawn from the public\r\n     eye. Being a less violent and a less shameful passion, I suppose,\r\n     it is indulged in with more of the humanities. The etiquette of the\r\n     coffee-house, of those coffee-houses which have not been too much\r\n     infected by Europe, is one of their most characteristic features.\r\n     Something like it prevails in Italy, where you tip your hat on\r\n     entering and leaving a _caffè_. In Turkey, however, I have seen a\r\n     new-comer salute one after another each person in a crowded\r\n     coffee-room, once on entering the door and again after taking his\r\n     seat, and be so saluted in return--either by putting the right hand\r\n     to the heart and uttering the greeting _Merhabah_, or by making the\r\n     _temennah_, that triple sweep of the hand which is the most\r\n     graceful of salutes. I have also seen an entire company rise upon\r\n     the entrance of an old man, and yield him the corner of honor.\r\n\r\n     Such courtesies take time. Then you must wait for your coffee to be\r\n     made. To this end coffee, roasted fresh as required by turning in\r\n     an iron cylinder over a fire of sticks and ground to the fineness\r\n     of powder in a brass mill, is put into a small uncovered brass pot\r\n     with a long handle. There it is boiled to a froth three times on a\r\n     charcoal brazier, with or without sugar as you prefer. But to\r\n     desecrate it by the admixture of milk is an unheard of sacrilege.\r\n     Some _kahvehjis_ replace the pot in the embers with a smart rap in\r\n     order to settle the grounds. You in the meanwhile smoke. That also\r\n     takes time, particularly if you \"drink\" a _narguileh_, as the Turks\r\n     say. This is familiar enough in the West to require no great\r\n     description. It is a big carafe with a metal top for holding\r\n     tobacco and a long coil of leather tube for inhaling the\r\n     water-cooled fumes thereof. The effect is wonderfully soothing and\r\n     innocent at first, though wonderfully deadly in the end to the\r\n     novice. The tobacco used is not the ordinary weed, but a much\r\n     coarser and stronger one called _tunbeki_, which comes from Persia.\r\n     The same sort of tobacco used to be smoked a great deal in shallow\r\n     red earthenware pipes with long mouthpieces. They are now chiefly\r\n     seen in antiquity shops.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: INTERIOR OF A TURKISH CAFFINET, EARLY NINETEENTH\r\n     CENTURY--AFTER ALLAN]\r\n\r\n     When your coffee is ready it is poured into an after-dinner\r\n     coffee-cup or into a miniature bowl, and brought to you on a tray\r\n     with a glass of water. A foreigner can almost always be spotted by\r\n     the manner in which he finally partakes of these refreshments. A\r\n     Turk sips his water first, partly to prepare the way for the\r\n     coffee, but also because he is a connoisseur of the former liquid\r\n     as other men are of stronger ones. And he lifts his coffee-cup by\r\n     the saucer, whether it possess a handle or no, managing the two\r\n     together in a dexterous way of his own. The current price for all\r\n     this, not including the water-pipe, is ten paras--a trifle over a\r\n     cent--for which the _kahvehji_ will cry you \"Blessing\". More\r\n     pretentious establishments charge twenty paras, while a giddy few\r\n     rise to a piaster--not quite five cents--or a piaster and a half.\r\n     That, however, begins to look like extortion. And mark that you do\r\n     not tip the waiter. I have often been surprised to be charged no\r\n     more than the tariff, although I gave a larger piece to be changed\r\n     and it was perfectly evident that I was a foreigner. That is an\r\n     experience which rarely befalls a traveller among his own\r\n     coreligionaries. It has even happened to me, which is rarer still,\r\n     to be charged nothing at all, nay, to be steadfastly refused when I\r\n     persisted in attempting to pay, simply because I was a foreigner,\r\n     and therefore a guest.\r\n\r\n     There is no reason, however, why you should go away when you have\r\n     had your coffee--or your glass of tea--and your smoke. On the\r\n     contrary, there are reasons why you should stay, particularly if\r\n     you happen into the coffee-house not too long after sunset. Then\r\n     coffee-houses of the most local color are at their best. Earlier in\r\n     the day their clients are likely to be at work. Later they will\r\n     have disappeared altogether. For Constantinople has not quite\r\n     forgotten the habits of the tent. Stamboul, except during the holy\r\n     month of Ramazan, is a deserted city at night. But just after dark\r\n     it is full of a life which an outsider is often content simply to\r\n     watch through the lighted windows of coffee-rooms. These are also\r\n     barber-shops, where men have shaved not only their chins, but\r\n     different parts of their heads according to their \"countries\". In\r\n     them likewise checkers, the Persian backgammon, and various games\r\n     of long narrow cards are played. They say that Bridge came from\r\n     Constantinople. Indeed, I believe a club of Pera claims the honor\r\n     of having communicated that passion to the Western World. But I\r\n     must confess that I have yet to see an open hand in a coffee-house\r\n     of the people.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: COFFEE MAKING IN TURKEY]\r\n\r\n     One of the pleasantest forms of amusement to be obtained in\r\n     coffee-houses is unfortunately getting to be one of the rarest. It\r\n     is that afforded by itinerant story-tellers, who still carry on in\r\n     the East the tradition of the troubadours. The stories they tell\r\n     are more or less on the order of the Arabian Nights, though perhaps\r\n     even less suitable for mixed companies--which for the rest are\r\n     never found in coffee-shops. These men are sometimes wonderfully\r\n     clever at character monologue or dialogue. They collect their pay\r\n     at a crucial moment of the action, refusing to continue until the\r\n     audience has testified to the sincerity of its interest by some\r\n     token more substantial.\r\n\r\n     Music is much more common. There are those, to be sure, who find no\r\n     music in the sounds poured forth oftenest by a gramophone, often by\r\n     a pair of gypsies with a flaring pipe and two small gourd drums,\r\n     and sometimes by an orchestra so-called of the fine lute--a company\r\n     of musicians on a railed dais who sing long songs while they play\r\n     on stringed instruments of strange curves. For myself I know too\r\n     little of music to tell what relation the recurrent cadences of\r\n     those songs and their broken rhythms may bear to the antique modes.\r\n     But I can listen, as long as musicians will perform, to those\r\n     infinite repetitions, that insistent sounding of the minor key. It\r\n     pleases me to fancy there a music come from far away--from unknown\r\n     river gorges, from camp-fires glimmering on great plains. Does not\r\n     such darkness breathe through it, such melancholy, such haunting of\r\n     elusive airs? There are flashes too of light, of song, the playing\r\n     of shepherd's pipes, the swoop of horsemen and sudden outcries of\r\n     savagery. But the note to which it all comes back is the monotone\r\n     of a primitive life, like the day-long beat of camel bells. And\r\n     more than all, it is the mood of Asia, so rarely penetrated, which\r\n     is neither lightness or despair.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: STREET COFFEE VENDER IN THE LEVANT, 1714]\r\n\r\n     There are seasons in the year when these various forms of\r\n     entertainment abound more than at others, as Ramazan and the two\r\n     Bairams. Throughout the month of Ramazan the purely Turkish\r\n     coffee-houses are closed in the daytime, since the pleasures which\r\n     they minister may not then be indulged in; but they are open all\r\n     night. It is during that one month of the year that Karaghieuz, the\r\n     Turkish shadow-show, may be seen in a few of the larger\r\n     coffee-shops. The Bairams are two festivals of three and four days\r\n     respectively, the former of which celebrates the close of Ramazan,\r\n     while the latter corresponds in certain respects to the Jewish\r\n     Passover. Dancing is a particular feature of the coffee-houses in\r\n     Bairam. The Kurds, who carry the burdens of Constantinople on their\r\n     backs, are above all other men given to this form of\r\n     exercise--though the Lazzes, the boatmen, vie with them. One of\r\n     these dark tribesmen plays a little violin like a pochelle, or two\r\n     of them perform on a pipe and a big drum, while the others dance\r\n     round them in a circle, sometimes till they drop from fatigue. The\r\n     weird music and the picturesque costumes and movements of the\r\n     dancers make the spectacle one to be remembered.\r\n\r\n     Christian coffee-houses also have their own festal seasons. These\r\n     coincide in general with the festivals of the church. But every\r\n     quarter has its patron saint, the saint of the local church or of\r\n     the local holy well, whose feast is celebrated by a three-day\r\n     _panayiri_. The street is dressed with flags and strings of colored\r\n     paper, tables and chairs line the sidewalk, and libations are\r\n     poured forth in honor of the holy person commemorated. For this\r\n     reason, and because of the more volatile character of the Greek,\r\n     the general note of his merrymaking is louder than that of the\r\n     Turk. One may even see the scandalous spectacle of men and women\r\n     dancing together at a Greek _panayiri_. The instrument which sets\r\n     the key of these orgies is the _lanterna_, a species of hand-organ\r\n     peculiar to Constantinople. It is a hand-piano rather, of a loud\r\n     and cheerful voice, whose Eurasian harmonies are enlivened by a\r\n     frequent clash of bells.\r\n\r\n     What first made coffee-houses suspicious to those in authority,\r\n     however, is their true resource--the advantages they offer for\r\n     meeting one's kind, for social converse and the contemplation of\r\n     life. Hence it must be that they have so happy a tact for locality.\r\n     They seek shade, pleasant corners, open squares, the prospect of\r\n     water or wide landscapes. In Constantinople they enjoy an infinite\r\n     choice of site, so huge is the extent of that city, so broken by\r\n     hill and sea, so varied in its spectacle of life. The commonest\r\n     type of city coffee-room looks out upon the passing world from\r\n     under a grape-vine or a climbing wistaria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A COFFEE HOUSE IN SYRIA--AFTER JARDIN]\r\n\r\nCoffee-houses of distinction are to be found also in the Place of the\r\nPines overlooking the Marble Sea, on Giant's Mountain, in the Landing\r\nPlace of the Man-slayer, and along the rivers that flow into the Golden\r\nHorn.\r\n\r\nOriginally the Turkish method of preparing coffee was the Arabian\r\nmethod, and it is so described by Mr. Fellows in his _Excursions through\r\nAsia Minor_:\r\n\r\n     Each cup is made separately, the little saucepan or ladle in which\r\n     it is prepared being about an inch wide and two deep; this is more\r\n     than half filled with coffee, finely pounded with a pestle and\r\n     mortar, and then filled up with water; after being placed for a few\r\n     seconds on the fire, the contents are poured, or rather shaken, out\r\n     (being much thicker than chocolate) without the addition of cream\r\n     or sugar, into a china cup of the size and shape of half an\r\n     egg-shell, which is inclosed in one of ornamented metal for\r\n     convenience of holding in the hand.\r\n\r\nLater, the Turks sought to improve the method by adding sugar (a\r\nconcession to the European sweet tooth) during the boiling process. The\r\nimproved Turkish recipe is as follows:\r\n\r\n     First boil the water. For two cups of the beverage add three lumps\r\n     of sugar and return the boiler to the fire. Add two teaspoonfuls of\r\n     powdered coffee, stirring well and let the pot boil up four times.\r\n     Between each boiling the pot is to be removed from the fire and the\r\n     bottom tapped gently until the froth on the top subsides. After the\r\n     last boiling pour the coffee first into one cup and then the other,\r\n     so as to evenly divide the froth.\r\n\r\nIn Syria and Palestine the Turkish-Arabian methods are followed. The\r\nbrazen dippers, or _ibriks_, are used for boiling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAFETAN\r\n\r\nOriental coffee-house keeper's costume]\r\n\r\nIn the Near East, coffee manners and customs are much the same today as\r\nthey were fifty or even one hundred years ago. Witness Damascus. The\r\nfollowing pen picture of the cafés in this ancient city was written in\r\n1836 to accompany the drawing by Bartlett and Purser, which is\r\nreproduced here; but it might have been written in 1922, so slight have\r\nbeen the changes in the setting or the spirit of the original coffee\r\nhouse that Shemsi first brought to Constantinople from Damascus in\r\n1554.[370]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STREET COFFEE SERVICE IN CONSTANTINOPLE]\r\n\r\n     The Cafés of the kind represented in the plate are, perhaps, the\r\n     greatest luxury that a stranger finds in Damascus. Gardens,\r\n     kiosques, fountains, and groves are abundant around every Eastern\r\n     capital: but Cafés on the very bosom of a rapid river, and bathed\r\n     by its waves, are peculiar to this ancient city: they are formed so\r\n     as to exclude the rays of the sun, while they admit the breeze; the\r\n     light roof is supported by slender rows of pillars, and the\r\n     building is quite open on every side.\r\n\r\n     A few of these houses are situated in the skirts of the town, on\r\n     one of the streams, where the eye rests on the luxuriant vegetation\r\n     of garden and wood: others are in the heart of the city: a flight\r\n     of steps conducts to them from the sultry street, and it is\r\n     delightful to pass in a few moments from the noisy, shadeless\r\n     thoroughfare, where you see only mean gateways and the gable-ends\r\n     of edifices, to a cool, grateful, calm place of rest and\r\n     refreshment, where you can muse and meditate in ease and luxury,\r\n     and feel at every moment the rich breeze from the river. In two or\r\n     three instances, a light wooden bridge leads to the platform, close\r\n     to which, and almost out of it, one or two large and noble trees\r\n     lift the canopy of their spreading branches and leaves, more\r\n     welcome at noonday than the roofs of fretted gold in the \"Arabian\r\n     Nights.\" The high pavilion roof and the pillars are all constructed\r\n     of wood: the floor is of wood, and sometimes of earth, and is\r\n     regularly watered, and raised only a few inches above the level of\r\n     the stream, which rushes by at the feet of the customer, which it\r\n     almost bathes, as he sips his coffee or sherbet. Innumerable small\r\n     seats cover the floor, and you take one of these, and place it in\r\n     the position you like best.\r\n\r\n     Perhaps you wish to sit apart from the crowd, just under the shadow\r\n     of the tree, or in some favourite corner where you can smoke, and\r\n     contemplate the motley guests, formed into calm and solemn groups,\r\n     who wish to hold no communion with the Giaour. There is ample food\r\n     here for the observer of character, costume and pretension: the\r\n     tradesman, the mechanic, the soldier, the gentleman, the dandy, the\r\n     grave old man, looking wise on the past and dimly on the future:\r\n     the hadge, in his green turban, vain of his journey to Mecca, and\r\n     drawing a long bow in his tales and adventures: the long straight\r\n     pipe, the hookah with its soft curling tube and glass vase, are in\r\n     request: but the poorer argille is most commonly used.\r\n\r\n     From sunrise to set, these houses are never empty: we were\r\n     accustomed to visit one of them early every morning, before\r\n     breakfast, and very many persons were already there: yet this\r\n     \"balmy hour of prime\" was the most silent and solitary of the whole\r\n     day; it was the coolest also: the rising sun was glancing redly on\r\n     the waters: there was as yet no heat in the air, and the little\r\n     cup of Mocha coffee and the pipe were handed by an attendant as\r\n     soon as the stranger was seated. His favourite Café was the one\r\n     represented in the plate: the river is the Barrada, the ancient\r\n     Pharpar. Never was the sound of many waters so pleasant to the ear\r\n     as in Damascus: the air is filled with the sound, with which no\r\n     clash of tongues, rolling of wheels, march of footman or horsemen,\r\n     mingle: the numerous groups who love to resort here are silent half\r\n     the time; and when they do converse, their voice is often \"low,\r\n     like that of a familiar spirit,\" or in short grave sentences that\r\n     pass quickly from the ear.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: A RIVERSIDE CAFÉ IN DAMASCUS, NINETEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n     After Bartlett and Purser]\r\n\r\n     Yet much, very much of the excitement of the life of the Turk in\r\n     this city, is absorbed in these coffee-houses: they are his opera,\r\n     his theatre, his conversazione: soon after his eyes are unclosed\r\n     from sleep, he thinks of his Café, and forthwith bends his way\r\n     there: during the day he looks forward to pass the evening on the\r\n     loved floor, to look on the waters, on the stars above, and on the\r\n     faces of his friends; and at the moonlight falling on all. Mahomet\r\n     committed a grievous error in the omission of coffee-houses, in a\r\n     future state: had he ever seen those of Damascus, he would surely\r\n     have given them a place on his rivers of Paradise, persuaded that\r\n     true believers must feel a melancholy void without them.\r\n\r\n     There is no ornament or richness about these houses: no sofas,\r\n     mirrors, or drapery, save that afforded by a few evergreens and\r\n     creepers: the famous silks and damasks of Damascus have no place\r\n     here; all is plain and homely; yet no Parisian Café, with its\r\n     beautiful mirrors, gilding, and luxuriousness, is so welcome to the\r\n     imagination and senses of the traveller. After wandering many days\r\n     over dry, and stony, and desert places, where the lip thirsted for\r\n     the stream, is it not delicious to sit at the brink of a wild,\r\n     impetuous torrent, to gaze on its white foam and breaking waves,\r\n     till you can almost feel their gush in every nerve and fibre, and\r\n     can bathe your very soul in them. And while you slowly smoke your\r\n     pipe of purest tobacco, the sands of the desert, and their burning\r\n     sun, rise again before you, when you prayed for even the shadow of\r\n     a cloud on your way. The banks are in some parts covered with wood,\r\n     whose soft green verdure contrasts beautifully with the clear\r\n     torrent, and almost droops into its bosom.\r\n\r\n     Near the coffee-houses are one or two cataracts several feet high,\r\n     and the perpetual sound of their fall, and the coolness they spread\r\n     around, are exquisite luxuries--in the heat of day, or in the\r\n     dimness of evening. There are two or three Cafés constructed\r\n     somewhat differently from those just described: a low gallery\r\n     divides the platform from the tide; fountains play on the floor,\r\n     which is furnished with very plain sofas and cushions; and music\r\n     and dancing always abound, of the most unrefined description.\r\n\r\n     The only intellectual gratification in these places is afforded by\r\n     the Arab story-tellers, among whom are a few eminent and clever\r\n     men: soon after his entrance, a group begins to form around the\r\n     gifted man, who, after a suitable pause, to collect hearers or whet\r\n     their expectations, begins his story. It is a picturesque sight--of\r\n     the Arab with his wild and graceful gestures, and his auditory,\r\n     hushed into deep and child-like attention, seated at the edge of\r\n     the rushing tide, while the narrator moves from side to side, and\r\n     each accent of his distinct and musical voice is heard throughout\r\n     the Café. The building directly opposite is another house, of a\r\n     similar kind in every respect There are a few small Cafés, more\r\n     select as to company, where the Turkish gentlemen often go, form\r\n     dinner parties, and spend the day.\r\n\r\n     Night is the propitious season to visit these places: the glare of\r\n     the sun, glancing on the waters, is passed away; the company is\r\n     then most numerous, for it is their favourite hour; the lamps,\r\n     suspended from the slender pillars, are lighted; the Turks, in the\r\n     various and brilliant colours of their costume, crowd the platform,\r\n     some standing moveless as the pillars beside them, their long pipe\r\n     in their hand--noble specimens of humanity, if intellect breathed\r\n     within: some reclining against the rails, others seated in groups,\r\n     or solitary as if buried in \"lonely thoughts sublime\"; while the\r\n     rush of the falling waters is sweeter music than that of the pipe\r\n     and the guitar, that faintly strive to be heard. The cataract in\r\n     the plate is a very fine one; on its foam the moonlight was lovely:\r\n     we passed many an hour here on such a night, the clear waters of\r\n     the Pharpar, as they rolled on, reflecting each pillar, each\r\n     Damascene slowly moving by in his waving garments. The glare of the\r\n     lamps mingled strangely with the moonlight, that rested with a soft\r\n     and vivid glory on the waters, and fell beneath pillar and roof on\r\n     the picturesque groups within.\r\n\r\nThe slender brass coffee grinders sometimes serve as a combination\r\nutensil in the equipment of the Turkish officer. Frequently they are\r\nmade of silver. They might be called collapsible, convertible coffee\r\nkits, as they are made to serve as a combination coffee pot, mill, can,\r\nand cup. The green or roasted beans are kept in the lower section. It\r\ntakes but a minute to unscrew the apparatus. To make a cup of coffee,\r\nthe beans are dumped out and three or four of them are put in the middle\r\nsection. The steel crank is fitted over the squared rod projecting from\r\nthe middle section, which revolves, setting in motion the grinding\r\napparatus inside. The ground coffee falls into the bottom section, and\r\nwater is added. The pot is placed on the fire, and the contents brought\r\nto a boil. The coffee pot serves as a cup. The process requires but a\r\nfew minutes. The cup is rinsed out, the beans replaced, the utensils put\r\ntogether, the whole thing is slipped into the officer's tunic, and he\r\ngoes on, refreshed.\r\n\r\nIn Persia, where tea is mostly drunk, the Turkish-Arabian methods of\r\nmaking coffee are followed. In Ceylon and India, the same applies to the\r\nnative population, but the whites follow the European practise. In\r\nIndia, many people look upon coffee as just a _bonne bouche_--a\r\n\"chaser.\" A well known English tea firm has had some success in India\r\nwith a tinned \"French coffee\", which is a blend of Indian coffee and\r\nchicory.\r\n\r\nEuropean methods obtain in making coffee in China and Japan, and in the\r\nFrench and Dutch colonies. When traveling in the Far East one of the\r\ngreatest hardships the coffee lover is called upon to endure is the\r\nEuropean bottled coffee extract, which so often supplies lazy chefs with\r\nthe makings of a most forbidding cup of coffee.\r\n\r\nIn Java, a favorite method is to make a strong extract by the French\r\ndrip process and then to use a spoonful of the extract to a cup of hot\r\nmilk--a good drink when the extract is freshly made for each service.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Making in Europe_\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the coffee drink was first sold by lemonade venders. In\r\nFlorence those who sold coffee, chocolate, and other beverages were not\r\ncalled _caffetiéri_ (coffee sellers) but _limonáji_ (lemonade venders).\r\nPascal's first Paris coffee shop served other drinks as well as coffee;\r\nand Procope's café began as a lemonade shop. It was only when coffee,\r\nwhich was an afterthought, began to lead the other beverages, that he\r\ngave the name café to his whole refreshment place.\r\n\r\nToday, nearly every country in Europe can supply the two extremes of\r\ncoffee making. In Paris and Vienna, one may find it brewed and served in\r\nits highest perfection; but here too it is frequently found as badly\r\ndone as in England, and that is saying a good deal. The principal\r\ndifficulty seems to be in the chicory flavor, for which long years of\r\nuse has cultivated a taste, with most people. Now coffee-and-chicory is\r\nnot at all a bad drink; indeed the author confesses to have developed a\r\ncertain liking for it after a time in France--but it is not coffee. In\r\nEurope, chicory is not regarded as an adulterant--it is an addition, or\r\nmodifier, if you please. And so many people have acquired a\r\ncoffee-and-chicory taste, that it is doubtful if they would appreciate a\r\nreal cup of coffee should they ever meet it. This, of course, is a\r\ngeneralization; and like all generalizations, is dangerous, for it _is_\r\npossible to obtain good coffee, properly made, in any European country,\r\neven England, in the homes of the people, but seldom in the hotels or\r\nrestaurants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE AL FRESCO IN JERUSALEM]\r\n\r\nAUSTRIA. Coffee is made in Austria after the French style, usually by\r\nthe drip method or in the pumping percolator device, commonly called the\r\nVienna coffee machine. The restaurants employ a large-size urn fitted\r\nwith a combination metal sieve and cloth sack. After the ground coffee\r\nhas infused for about six minutes, a screw device raises the metal\r\nsieve, the pressure forcing the liquid through the cloth sack containing\r\nthe ground coffee.\r\n\r\nVienna cafés are famous, but the World War has dimmed their glory. It\r\nused to be said that their equal could not be found for general\r\nexcellence and moderate prices. From half-past eight to ten in the\r\nmorning, large numbers of people were wont to breakfast in them on a cup\r\nof coffee or tea, with a roll and butter. _Mélangé_ is with milk;\r\n\"brown\" coffee is darker, and a _schwarzer_ is without milk. In all the\r\ncafés the visitor may obtain coffee, tea, liqueurs, ices, bottled beer,\r\nham, eggs, etc. The Café Schrangl in the Graben is typical. Then there\r\nare the dairies, with coffee, a unique institution. In the _Prater_\r\n(public park) there are many interesting cafés.\r\n\r\nCharles J. Rosebault says in the _New York Times_:\r\n\r\n     The café of Vienna has been imitated all over the world--but the\r\n     result has never failed to be an imitation. The nearest approach to\r\n     the genuine in my experience was the upstairs room of the old\r\n     Fleischman Café in New York. That was because the average New\r\n     Yorker knew it not and it remained sacred to the internationalists:\r\n     the musicians, artists, writers, and other Bohemians to whom had\r\n     been intrusted the secret of its existence. It is the spirit that\r\n     counts, and it was the spirit of its frequenters that made the\r\n     Vienna café. It was everyman's club, and everywoman's, too, where\r\n     one went to relax and forget all the worries of existence, to look\r\n     over papers and magazines from all parts of the world and printed\r\n     in every known language, to play chess or skat or taracq, to chat\r\n     with friends and to drink the inimitable Viennese coffee, the\r\n     fragrance of which can no more be described than the perfume of\r\n     last year's violets.\r\n\r\n     The café was filled after the noon meal, when busy men took their\r\n     coffee and smoked; again around five o'clock, when all the world\r\n     and his wife paraded along the Graben and the Karntner Strasse, and\r\n     then dropped into a favorite café for coffee or chocolate and\r\n     cakes--horns and crescents of delicious dough filled with jam or,\r\n     possibly, the wonderful Kugelhupf, in comparison with which our\r\n     sponge is like unto lead; finally in the evening, when there were\r\n     family parties and those returning from theatres and concerts and\r\n     opera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph by Burton Holmes\r\n\r\nTHE CAFÉ SCHRANGL IN THE GRABEN, VIENNA, THE CITY THAT COFFEE MADE\r\nFAMOUS]\r\n\r\nWhile the café life of Vienna has been nearly killed by the World War,\r\nit is to be hoped that time will restore at least something of its\r\nformer glory. In spite of the stories of plundering bands of Bolshevists\r\nthat in the latter part of 1921 wrecked some of the better known places,\r\nwe read that Oscar Straus, composer of _The Chocolate Soldier_, is\r\nliving in comparative luxury in Vienna, and spends most of his time in\r\nthe cafés, where he is to be found usually from two until five in the\r\nafternoon and from eleven o'clock at night until some early hour of the\r\nmorning \"surrounded by musicians of lesser note and wealth, whom, to a\r\ndegree, he supports; also with him being many of the leading composers,\r\nlibrettists, actors, actresses, and singers of Vienna.\"\r\n\r\nFor Vienna coffee, the liquor is usually made in a pumping percolator or\r\nby the drip process. In normal times it is served two parts coffee to\r\none of hot milk topped with whipped cream. During 1914-18 and the recent\r\npost-war period, however, the sparkling crown of delicious whipped cream\r\ngave way to condensed milk, and saccharine took the place of sugar.\r\n\r\nBELGIUM. In Belgium, the French drip method is most generally employed.\r\nChicory is freely used as a modifier. The greatest coffee drinker among\r\nreigning monarchs is said to be the King of the Belgians. His majesty\r\ntakes a cup of coffee before breakfast, after breakfast, at his noonday\r\nmeal, in the afternoon, after dinner, and again in the evening.\r\n\r\nBRITISH ISLES. In the British Isles coffee is still being boiled;\r\nalthough the infusion, true percolation (drip), and filtration methods\r\nhave many advocates. A favorite device is the earthenware jug with or\r\nwithout the cotton sack that makes it a coffee biggin. When used without\r\nthe sack, the best practise is first to warm the jug. For each pint of\r\nliquor, one ounce (three dessert-spoonfuls) of freshly ground coffee is\r\nput in the pot. Upon it is poured freshly boiling water--three-fourths\r\nof the amount required. After stirring with a wooden spoon, the\r\nremainder of the water is poured in, and the pot is returned to the\r\n\"hob\" to infuse, and to settle for from three to five minutes. Some stir\r\nit a second time before the final settling.\r\n\r\nThe best trade authorities stress home-grinding, and are opposed to\r\nboiling the beverage. They advocate also its use as a breakfast\r\nbeverage, after lunch, and after the evening meal.\r\n\r\nFrom an American point of view, the principal defects in the English\r\nmethod of making coffee lie in the roasting, handling, and brewing. It\r\nhas been charged that the beans are not properly cooked in the first\r\nplace, and that they are too often stale before being ground. The\r\nEnglish run to a light or cinnamon roast, whereas the best American\r\npractise requires a medium, high, or city roast. A fairly high shade of\r\nbrown is favored on the South Downs with a light shade for Lancashire,\r\nthe West Riding of Yorkshire, and the south of Scotland. The trade\r\ndemands, for the most part, a ripe chestnut brown. Wholesale roasting is\r\ndone by gas and coke machines; while retail dealers use mostly a small\r\ntype of inner-heated gas machine. The large gas machines (with\r\ncapacities running from twenty-five to seven hundred pounds) have\r\nexternal air-blast burners, direct and indirect burners, sliding\r\nburners, etc. The best known are the Faulder and Moorewood machines. In\r\nthe Uno, a popular retail machine, roasting seven to fourteen pounds at\r\na time, the coffee beans are placed in the space between outer and inner\r\nconcentric cylinders, one made of perforated steel, and the other of\r\nwire gauze, revolving together. A gas flame of the Bunsen type burns\r\ninside the inner cylinder, its heat traversing the outer, or coffee\r\ncylinder, while the fumes are driven off through the open ends. The\r\nroasting coffee may be viewed through a mica or wire-gauze panel\r\ninserted in the wall of the outer cylinder. The Faulder machine has an\r\nexternal flame, a capacity of from seven to fourteen pounds; and there\r\nare quick gas machines, with capacities ranging from three pounds to two\r\nhundred and twenty-four pounds, for the retail trade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAVORITE ENGLISH COFFEE-MAKING METHOD]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CAFÉ OF YE MECCA COMPANY, LONDON]\r\n\r\nIn recent years there has been a marked improvement in English coffee\r\nroasting, due to the intelligent study brought to bear upon the subject\r\nby leaders of the trade's thought, and by the retail distributer, who,\r\nin the person of the retail grocer, is, generally speaking, better\r\neducated to his business than the retail grocer in any other country.\r\nYears ago, it was the practise to use butter or lard to improve the\r\nappearance of the bean in roasting; but this is not so common as\r\nformerly.\r\n\r\nThe British consumer, however, will need much instruction before the\r\nnational character of the beverage shows a uniform improvement. While\r\nthe coffee may be more carefully roasted, better \"cooked\" than it was\r\nformerly, it is still remaining too long unsold after roasting, or else\r\nit is being ground too long a time before making. These abuses are,\r\nhowever, being corrected; and the consumer is everywhere being urged to\r\nbuy his coffee freshly roasted and to have it freshly ground. Another\r\nfactor has undoubtedly contributed to give England a bad name among\r\nlovers of good coffee, and that is certain tinned \"coffees,\" composed of\r\nground coffee and chicory, mixtures that attained some vogue for a time\r\nas \"French\" coffee. They found favor, perhaps, because they were easily\r\nhandled. Package coffees have not been developed in England as in\r\nAmerica; but there is a more or less limited field for them, and there\r\nare several good brands of absolutely pure coffee on the market.\r\n\r\nThe demi-tasse is a popular drink after luncheon, after dinner, and\r\neven during the day, especially in the cities. In London, there are\r\ncafés that make a specialty of it; places like Peel's, Groom's, and the\r\nCafé Nero in the city; also the shops of the London Café Co., and Ye\r\nMecca Co.\r\n\r\nWhile, in the home, it is customary to steep the coffee; in hotels and\r\nrestaurants some form of percolating apparatus, extractor, or steam\r\nmachine is employed. There are the Criterion (employing a drip tray for\r\nmaking coffee in the Etzenberger style); Fountain; Platow; Syphon\r\n(Napier); and Verithing extractors, put out by Sumerling & Co. of\r\nLondon; and the well-known J. & S. rapid coffee-making machine, having\r\nan infuser, and producing coffee by steam pressure, manufactured by W.M.\r\nStill & Sons, Ltd., London.\r\n\r\nAmerican visitors complain that coffee in England is too thick and\r\nsyrupy for their liking. Coffee in restaurants is served \"white\" (with\r\nmilk), or black, in earthen, stoneware, or silver pots. In chain\r\nrestaurants, like Lyons' or the A.B.C., there is to be found on the\r\ntariff, \"hot milk with a dash of coffee.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROOM'S COFFEE HOUSE, FLEET STREET, LONDON]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAFÉ MONICO, PICCADILLY CIRCUS, LONDON]\r\n\r\nAs to the boiling method, this is already generally discredited in the\r\ncountries of western Europe. The steeping method so much favored in\r\nEngland may be responsible for some of the unkind things said about\r\nEnglish coffee; because it undoubtedly leads to the abuse of\r\nover-infusion, so that the net result is as bad as boiling.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of the English people are, however, confirmed tea\r\ndrinkers, and it is extremely doubtful if this national habit, ingrained\r\nthrough centuries of use of \"the cup that cheers\" at breakfast and at\r\ntea time in the afternoon can ever be changed.\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned in this work, the London coffee houses of the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries gave way to a type of coffee house\r\nwhose mainstay was its food rather than its drink. In time, these too\r\nbegan to yield to the changing influences of a civilization that\r\ndemanded modern hotels, luxurious tea lounges, smart restaurants, chain\r\nshops, tea rooms, and cafés with and without coffee. A certain type of\r\n\"coffee shop,\" with rough boarded stalls, sanded floors and \"private\r\nrooms,\" frequented by lower class workingmen, were to be found in\r\nEngland for a time; but because of their doubtful character, they were\r\nclosed up by the police.\r\n\r\nAmong other places in London where coffee may be had in English or\r\ncontinental style, mention should be made of the Café Monico, a good\r\nplace to drop in for a coffee and liqueur, and one of the pioneers of\r\nthe modern restaurant; Gatti's, where _café filtré_, or coffee produced\r\nby the filtration method, is a specialty; the cosmopolitan Savoy with\r\nits popular tea lounge (teas, sixty cents); the Piccadilly Hotel, with\r\nits Louis XIV restaurant catering to refined and luxurious tastes; the\r\nWaldorf Hotel, with its American clientèle and its palm court (teas,\r\nthirty-six cents); the Cecil, with its palm court and tea balcony, also\r\nhaving a special attraction for Americans; Lyons' Popular Café (iced\r\ncoffee, twelve cents); the Trocadero with its special Indian curries\r\nprepared by native cooks once each week; the Temple Bar restaurant, an\r\nattractive refectory owned by the semi-philanthropic Trust-Houses, Ltd.,\r\nwhich runs some two hundred similar establishments throughout the\r\ncountry, serving alcoholic drinks but stressing non-intoxicating\r\nbeverages, among them special Mocha at six and eight cents a cup;\r\nSlater's, Ltd., catering mostly to business folk in the city, there\r\nbeing about a score of restaurants and tea rooms under this name with\r\nretail shops attached; the British Tea Table Association, like Slater's,\r\na grown-up sister of the olden bun shop of Queen Victoria's day; and the\r\nKardomah chain of cafés, where one is reasonably sure to get a\r\nsatisfying cup of coffee and a cake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATTI'S, IN THE STRAND, LONDON]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEA LOUNGE OF HOTEL SAVOY, LONDON]\r\n\r\nSupplementing the above, Charles Cooper, some time editor of the\r\n_Epicure_ and _The Table_, has prepared for this work some notes on the\r\nevolution of the old-time London coffee houses into the present-day tea\r\nrooms, tea lounges, cafés, and restaurants for all comers. Mr. Cooper\r\nsays of the transformation:\r\n\r\n     The old-fashioned London coffee-house that flourished forty to\r\n     fifty years ago has within the past thirty years been completely\r\n     extinguished by the modern tea rooms. These old-fashioned\r\n     establishments were mainly situated in and about the Strand and\r\n     Fleet Street, the neighborhood of the Inns of Court, etc. They did\r\n     not sacrifice much to outside show and decoration. They were\r\n     divided into boxes or pews, and were generally speaking clean and\r\n     well ordered; the prices were moderate, and the fare simple but\r\n     superlatively good. There is nothing to equal it now. Chops were\r\n     cooked in the grill. The tea and coffee were of the best; the hams\r\n     were York hams and the bacon the best Wiltshire; they were the last\r\n     places where real buttered toast was made. The art is now lost.\r\n     They catered exclusively to men; and their clientèle consisted of\r\n     journalists, artists, actors, men from the Inns of Court, students,\r\n     _et al._ A man living in chambers could breakfast comfortably at\r\n     one of these places, and read all the morning papers at his ease.\r\n     The most westerly perhaps of the old houses was Stone's in Panton\r\n     Street, Haymarket, which has recently been sold. Groom's in Fleet\r\n     Street, where a good cup of coffee may still be had, is principally\r\n     frequented by barristers about the luncheon hour. They are usually\r\n     men who lunch lightly.\r\n\r\n     The tea rooms, as I have said, have killed the coffee houses. At\r\n     the time the latter flourished, there were no facilities in London\r\n     for a woman, unattended by a man, to obtain refreshment beyond a\r\n     weak cup of tea at a few confectioners'. It mattered the less in\r\n     the days when the girl clerk had not come into being. When the\r\n     field of women's employment widened, fresh requirements were\r\n     created which the coffee shops did not meet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LYONS' \"POPULAR CAFÉ,\" PICCADILLY--ONE OF MANY OPERATED\r\nUNDER THAT NAME]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PALM COURT IN THE WALDORF HOTEL--A POPULAR RESORT FOR\r\nAMERICAN TRAVELERS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO POPULAR PLACES FOR COFFEE IN LONDON]\r\n\r\n     The tea room pioneers in London were the Aërated Bread Company,\r\n     familiarly known as the A.B.C. I think that coffee palaces in\r\n     provincial industrial centers had been started; but as part of a\r\n     temperance propaganda, to counteract the attractions of the public\r\n     house. The Aërated Bread Company was founded about the middle of\r\n     the past century for the manufacture and sale of bread made under\r\n     the patent aërated process of Dr. Daugleish. The shops were opened\r\n     for the sale of bread to the public for home consumption; but to\r\n     give people an opportunity of testing it, facilities were provided\r\n     for obtaining a cup of tea, and bread and butter, on the premises.\r\n     This subsidiary object became in a short time the most important\r\n     part of the company's business. It multiplied its shops, enlarged\r\n     its bill of fare to include cooked foods; and while, nowadays, the\r\n     A.B.C. and its rivals cater to many thousands daily, I doubt if\r\n     anybody ever buys a loaf to take home.\r\n\r\n     The A.B.C. has many competitors, similar shops having been started\r\n     by Lyons, Lipton, Slaters. Express Dairy Company, Cabin, Pioneer\r\n     Cafés, and others. _Ex uno disce omnes._\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: TEMPLE BAR RESTAURANT, LONDON]\r\n\r\n     The fare in all these places is much alike, as are the general\r\n     equipment, prices, and class of customers. They cater for a cheap\r\n     class of business. In the busy centers they are frequented mostly\r\n     by young men and girl clerks and shop assistants, by women in town,\r\n     shopping, and such-like custom. Young employees can get a modest\r\n     mid-day meal at a price to suit a shallow pocket. Before the war,\r\n     the ruling price for a cup of tea, and a roll and butter, was\r\n     fourpence, and the general tariff in proportion. Nowadays, the war\r\n     has run up prices at least fifty percent. During the worst times of\r\n     food control the fare was very scanty and very unappetizing. As a\r\n     rule, it is plain and wholesome, with no pretense of being\r\n     _recherché_. Tea is almost always very good; coffee not on the same\r\n     level. Their tea rooms are all places designed for small, quick\r\n     meals; and are in no sense lounges.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: TEA BALCONY IN THE HOTEL CECIL, LONDON]\r\n\r\n     Lyons have refreshment-houses of different grades. The Popular Café\r\n     is a cut above the tea rooms, and so are the Corner Houses. Two\r\n     years ago, the A.B.C. amalgamated with Buzard's, an old established\r\n     confectioner's in Oxford Street--a famous cake-house.\r\n\r\n     The Monico and Gatti's appeal to a quite different class from that\r\n     catered to by the tea shops, although perhaps not to what Mrs.\r\n     Boffin would call \"the highfliers of fashion\" who frequent the\r\n     lounges of the fashionable hotels. Gatti's original café was under\r\n     the arches of Charing Cross station.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: SLATER'S, A BETTER-CLASS CHAIN SHOP, LONDON]\r\n\r\n     I may add about the Savoy that it was an outcome of the successful\r\n     Gilbert and Sullivan operas of the seventies, D'Oyly Carte having\r\n     expended some of his profits on building the hotel on a piece of\r\n     waste ground by the Savoy Theatre. He brought over M. Ritz from\r\n     Monte Carlo to manage the hotel and restaurant, and Escoffier, the\r\n     greatest chef of the day, to preside over the cuisine. They made\r\n     the Savoy famous for its dinners, and it has always maintained a\r\n     high reputation, although Escoffier, who has now retired, ruled\r\n     later at the Carlton; and Ritz, at the hotel in Piccadilly which\r\n     bears his name.\r\n\r\nBULGARIA. In Bulgaria, Arabian-Turkish methods of making coffee prevail.\r\nThe accompanying illustration shows a group in a caravan of the faithful\r\non the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. The venerable Moslem, who is\r\nambitious of becoming a hadji, is attended by his guards, distinguished\r\nby their fantastic dress; their glittering golden-hafted _hanjars_,\r\nstuck in their shawl girdles; and their silver-mounted pistols; the\r\ngrave turban replaced by a many-tasseled cap. Their accommodation is the\r\nstable of a khan, or serai, shared with their camel. Their refreshment\r\nis coffee, thick, black and bitter, served by the khanji in tiny\r\negg-shaped cups.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. JAMES'S RESTAURANT, PICCADILLY, LONDON]\r\n\r\nIn DENMARK and FINLAND coffee is made and served after the French and\r\nGerman fashion.\r\n\r\nFRANCE. Were it not for the almost inevitable high roast and frequently\r\nthe disconcerting chicory addition, coffee in France might be an\r\nunalloyed delight--at least this is how it appears to American eyes. One\r\nseldom, if ever, finds coffee improperly brewed in France--it is never\r\nboiled.\r\n\r\nSecond only to the United States, France consumes about two million bags\r\nof coffee annually. The varieties include coffee from the East Indies;\r\nMocha; Haitian (a great favorite); Central American; Colombian; and\r\nBrazils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN A.B.C. SHOP, LONDON]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HALT OF CARAVANERS AT A SERAI, BULGARIA]\r\n\r\nAlthough there are many wholesale and retail coffee roasters in France,\r\nhome roasting persists, particularly in the country districts. The\r\nlittle sheet-iron cylinder roasters, that are hand-turned over an iron\r\nbox holding the charcoal fire, find a ready sale even in the modern\r\ndepartment stores of the big cities. In any village or city in France it\r\nis a common sight on a pleasant day to find the householder turning his\r\nroaster on the curb in front of his home. Emmet G. Beeson, in _The Tea\r\nand Coffee Trade Journal_ gives us this vignette of rural coffee\r\nroasting in the south of France:\r\n\r\n     In a certain town in the south of France I saw an old man with an\r\n     outfit a little larger than the home variety, a machine with a\r\n     capacity of about ten pounds. Instead of a cylinder in which to\r\n     roast his coffee, he had perched on a sheet-iron frame a hollow\r\n     round ball made of sheet iron. In the top of this ball there was a\r\n     little slide which was opened by the means of a metal tool. In the\r\n     sheet-iron frame he had kindled his charcoal fire. Directly in\r\n     front of his roaster was a home-made cooling pan, the sides of\r\n     which were of wood, the bottom covered with a fine grade of wire\r\n     screening.\r\n\r\n     On this particular afternoon, the old man had taken up his place on\r\n     the curb; and a big black cat had taken advantage of the warmth\r\n     offered by the charcoal fire and was curled up, sleeping peacefully\r\n     in the pan nearest the fire. The old man paid no attention to the\r\n     cat, but went on rotating his ball of coffee and puffing away\r\n     pensively on his cigarette. When his coffee had become blackened\r\n     and burned, and blackened and burned it was, he stopped rotating\r\n     the ball, opened the slide in the top, turned it over, and the hot,\r\n     burned coffee rolled out, and much to his delight, on the sleeping\r\n     cat, which leaped out of the pan and scampered up the street and\r\n     into a hole under an old building.\r\n\r\n     I afterward learned that this old fellow made a business of going\r\n     about the town gathering up coffee from the houses along the way\r\n     and roasting it at a few sous per kilo, much the same fashion as a\r\n     scissors grinder plies his trade in an American town.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAFÉ DE LA PAIX, WHERE PARIS DRINKS ITS COFFEE OUTDOORS]\r\n\r\nQuite a few grocers roast their own coffee in crude devices much like\r\nthose described above; but the large coffee roasters are gradually\r\neliminating this sort of procedure. There are at Havre several roasters,\r\nbut only two of importance; one does a business of about two hundred and\r\nfifty bags a day, and the next largest has a capacity of about one\r\nhundred and sixty bags a day. In Paris, there are many coffee roasters,\r\nsome quite large, comparatively speaking, one having a capacity of about\r\nseven hundred and fifty bags a day. Shop-keepers in Paris and other\r\nlarge cities roast their coffee fresh daily. The machines used are of\r\nthe ball or cylinder type, employing gas fuel and turned by electric\r\npower. Invariably they stand where they may be seen from the street.\r\n\r\nSample-roasters, or testing tables, in France are conspicuous by their\r\nabsence. Inquiry regarding this subject discloses that coffee is sold on\r\ndescription; and when the French trader is asked, \"How do you know your\r\ndelivery is up to description so far as cup quality is concerned?\" he\r\nanswers that this is arrived at from the general appearance and the\r\nsmell of the coffee in the green. Perhaps one reason for the laxity in\r\nbuying cup quality may be explained by the fact that coffee is roasted\r\nvery high, in fact it is burned almost to a charred state; and unless\r\nthe coffee is unusually bad in character, the burned taste eliminates\r\nany foreign flavor it may have.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIDEWALK ANNEX, CAFÉ DE LA PAIX, PARIS, WITH OPERA HOUSE\r\nIN BACKGROUND--SUMMER OF 1918]\r\n\r\nThe fact that coffee was, and still is, quite generally sold to the\r\nconsumer green, accounts for Central American coffees taking first\r\nplace. Style takes preference over everything else when it comes to\r\nselling to a Frenchman.\r\n\r\nTo the American coffee merchant it seems that the French are carrying\r\ntheir artistic tastes to an unreasonable extreme when they apply them to\r\ncoffee; for coffee is grown to drink and not to look at.\r\n\r\nSince the coming of the large coffee roaster, who delivers roasted\r\ncoffee right down the line to the consumer, Santos has come in for its\r\nshare of the business. The roasters are getting good results out of\r\nSantos blends, up to fifty percent and sixty percent with West Indian\r\nand Central American coffees. Rio is as much in disfavor in France as it\r\nis in the United States, perhaps more so.\r\n\r\nIn Brittany the demand is for peaberry coffee, no matter of what\r\nvariety. This comes about from the fact that the people of this section\r\nof the country still do a great deal of their roasting at home, and have\r\nbecome accustomed to the use of peaberry coffee because they do not have\r\nthe improved hand roasters, and still do a great deal of their roasting\r\nin pans in the ovens of their stoves. The peaberry coffee rolls about so\r\nnicely in the pan that they get a much more uniform roast.\r\n\r\nNearly all the coffee is ground at home, which is not a bad practise for\r\nthe consumer; but perhaps works hardship on the dealer, who can mix some\r\ngrade grinders into his blends without doing them any material harm.\r\nWhere coffee mills are used in the stores, they are of the Strong-Arm\r\nfamily and of an ancient heritage. To get a growl out of the grocer in\r\nFrance, buy a kilo of coffee and ask him to grind it.\r\n\r\nPackage coffee and proprietary brands have not come into their own to\r\nthe extent that they have in the United States, although there are at\r\npresent two firms in Paris which have started in this business and are\r\nadvertising extensively on billboards, in street cars, and in the\r\nsubways. However, most coffee is still sold in bulk. The butter, egg,\r\nand cheese stores of France do a very large business in coffee. Prior to\r\nthe war and high prices, there were some very large firms doing a\r\npremium business in coffee, tea, spices, etc. They still exist, and\r\nhave a very fine trade; but since the high prices of coffees and\r\npremiums, the business has gone down very materially. They operate by\r\nthe wagon-route and solicitor method, just as some of our American\r\ncompanies do. One very large firm in Paris has been in this business for\r\nmore than thirty years, operating branches and wagons in every town,\r\nvillage, and hamlet in France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAFÉ DE LA RÉGENCE, PARIS, SHOWING THE TYPICAL\r\nCONTINENTAL ARRANGEMENT OF SEATS]\r\n\r\nThe consumption of coffee is increasing very materially in France; some\r\nsay, on account of the high price of wine, others hold that coffee is\r\nsimply growing in favor with the people. Among the masses, French\r\nbreakfast consists of a bowl or cup of _café au lait_, or half a cup or\r\nbowl of strong black coffee and chicory, and half a cup of hot milk, and\r\na yard of bread. The workingman turns his bread on end and inserts it\r\ninto his bowl of coffee, allowing it to soak up as much of the liquid as\r\npossible. Then he proceeds to suck this concoction into his system. His\r\napproval is demonstrated by the amount of noise he makes in the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nAmong the better classes, the breakfast is the same, _café au lait_,\r\nwith rolls and butter, and sometimes fruit. The brew is prepared by the\r\ndrip, or true percolator, method or by filtration. Boiling milk is\r\npoured into the cup from a pot held in one hand together with the brewed\r\ncoffee from a pot held in the other, providing a simultaneous mixture.\r\nThe proportions vary from half-and-half to one part coffee and three\r\nparts milk. Sometimes, the service is by pouring into the cup a little\r\ncoffee then the same quantity of milk and alternating in this way until\r\nthe cup is filled.\r\n\r\nCoffee is never drunk with any meal but breakfast, but is invariably\r\nserved _en demi-tasse_ after the noon and the evening meals. In the\r\nhome, the usual thing after luncheon or dinner is to go into the _salon_\r\nand have your demi-tasse and liqueur and cigarettes before a cosy grate\r\nfire. A Frenchman's idea of after-dinner coffee is a brew that is\r\nunusually thick and black, and he invariably takes with it his liqueur,\r\nno matter if he has had a cocktail for an appetizer, a bottle of red\r\nwine with his meat course, and a bottle of white wine with the salad and\r\ndessert course. When the demi-tasse comes along, with it must be served\r\nhis cordial in the shape of cognac, benedictine, or crème de menthe. He\r\ncan not conceive of a man not taking a little alcohol with his\r\nafter-dinner coffee, as an aid, he says, to digestion.\r\n\r\nIn Normandy, there prevails a custom in connection with coffee drinking\r\nthat is unique. They produce in this province great quantities of what\r\nis known as _cidre_, made from a particular variety of apple grown\r\nthere--in other words, just plain hard cider. However, they distil this\r\nhard cider, and from the distillation they get a drink called\r\n_calvados_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAFÉ DE LA RÉGENCE IN 1922]\r\n\r\nThe man from Normandy takes half a cup of coffee, and fills the cup with\r\n_calvados_, sweetened with sugar, and drinks it with seeming relish.\r\nIce-cold coffee will almost sizzle when _calvados_ is poured into it. It\r\ntastes like a corkscrew, and one drink has the same effect as a crack on\r\nthe head with a hammer. From the toddling age up, the Norman takes his\r\n_calvados_ and coffee.\r\n\r\nIn the south of France they make a concoction from the residue of\r\ngrapes. They boil the residue down in water, and get a drink called\r\n_marc_; and it is used in much the same way as the Norman in the north\r\nuses _calvados_. Then there is also the very popular summertime drink\r\nknown as _mazagran_, which in that region means seltzer water and cold\r\ncoffee, or what Americans might call a coffee highball.\r\n\r\nMaking coffee in France has been, and always will be, by the drip and\r\nthe filtration methods. The large hotels and cafés follow these methods\r\nalmost entirely, and so does the housewife. When company comes, and\r\nsomething unusual in coffee is to be served, Mr. Beeson says he has\r\nknown the cook to drip the coffee, using a spoonful of hot water at a\r\ntime, pouring it over tightly packed, finely ground coffee, allowing the\r\nwater to percolate through to extract every particle of oil. They use\r\nmore ground coffee in bulk than they get liquid in the cup, and\r\nsometimes spend an hour producing four or five demi-tasses. It is\r\nneedless to say that it is more like molasses than coffee when ready for\r\ndrinking.\r\n\r\nIt is not unusual in some parts of France to save the coffee grounds for\r\na second or even a third infusion, but this is not considered good\r\npractise.\r\n\r\nVon Liebig's idea of correct coffee making has been adapted to French\r\npractise in some instances after this fashion: put used coffee grounds\r\nin the bottom chamber of a drip coffee pot. Put freshly ground coffee in\r\nthe upper chamber. Pour on boiling water. The theory is that the old\r\ncoffee furnishes body and strength, and the fresh coffee the aroma.\r\n\r\nThe cafés that line the boulevards of Paris and the larger cities of\r\nFrance all serve coffee, either plain or with milk, and almost always\r\nwith liqueur. The coffee house in France may be said to be the wine\r\nhouse; or the wine house may be said to be the coffee house. They are\r\ninseparable. In the smallest or the largest of these establishments\r\ncoffee can be had at any time of day or night. The proprietor of a very\r\nlarge café in Paris says his coffee sales during the day almost equal\r\nhis wine sales.\r\n\r\nThe French, young or old, take a great deal of pleasure in sitting out\r\non the sidewalk in front of a café, sipping coffee or liqueur. Here they\r\nlove to idle away the time just watching the passing show.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, there are hundreds of these cafés lining the boulevards, where\r\none may sit for hours before the small tables reading the newspapers,\r\nwriting letters, or merely idling. In the morning, from eight to eleven,\r\nemployees, men-about-town, tourists, and provincials throng the cafés\r\nfor _café au lait_. The waiters are coldly polite. They bring the\r\npapers, and brush the table--twice for _café créme_ (milk), and three\r\ntimes for _café complet_ (with bread and butter).\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, _café_ means a small cup or glass of _café noir_, or\r\n_café nature_. It is double the usual amount of coffee dripped by\r\npercolator or filtration device, the process consuming eight to ten\r\nminutes. Some understand _café noir_ to mean equal parts of coffee and\r\nbrandy with sugar and vanilla to taste. When _café noir_ is mixed with\r\nan equal quantity of cognac alone it becomes _café gloria_. _Café\r\nmazagran_ is also much in demand in the summertime. The coffee base is\r\nmade as for _café noir_, and it is served in a tall glass with water to\r\ndilute it to one's taste.\r\n\r\nFew of the cafés that made Paris famous in the eighteenth century\r\nsurvive. Among those that are notable for their coffee service are the\r\nCafé de la Paix; the Café de la Régence, founded in 1718; and the Café\r\nPrévost, noted also for chocolate after the theater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE BIARD CAFÉS\r\n\r\nThere are about 200 of these coffee and wine shops in Paris. They are\r\nfrequented mostly by laborers, clerks, and midinettes]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RESTAURANT PROCOPE, 1922\r\n\r\nSuccessor to the famous \"Cave\" of 1689]\r\n\r\nGERMANY. Germany originated the afternoon coffee function known as the\r\nkaffee-klatsch. Even today, the German family's reunion takes place\r\naround the coffee table on Sunday afternoons. In summer, when weather\r\npermits, the family will take a walk into the suburbs, and stop at a\r\ngarden where coffee is sold in pots. The proprietor furnishes the\r\ncoffee, the cups, the spoons and, in normal times, the sugar, two pieces\r\nto each cup; and the patrons bring their own cake. They put one piece of\r\nsugar into each cup and take the other pieces home to the \"canary bird,\"\r\nmeaning the sugar bowl in the pantry.\r\n\r\nCheaper coffee is served in some gardens, which conspicuously display\r\nlarge signs at the entrance, saying: \"Families may cook their own coffee\r\nin this place.\" In such a garden, the patron merely buys the hot water\r\nfrom the proprietor, furnishing the ground coffee and cake himself.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for the coffee to brew, he may listen to the band and\r\nwatch the children play under the trees. French or Vienna drip pots are\r\nused for brewing.\r\n\r\nEvery city in Germany has its cafés, spacious places where patrons sit\r\naround small tables, drinking coffee, \"with or without\" turned or\r\nunturned, steaming or iced, sweetened or unsweetened, depending on the\r\nsugar supply; nibble, at the same time, a piece of cake or pastry,\r\nselected from a glass pyramid; talk, flirt, malign, yawn, read, and\r\nsmoke. Cafés are, in fact, public reading rooms. Some places keep\r\nhundreds of daily and weekly newspapers and magazines on file for the\r\nuse of patrons. If the customer buys only one cup of coffee, he may keep\r\nhis seat for hours, and read one newspaper after another.\r\n\r\nThree of the four corners of Berlin's most important street crossing are\r\noccupied by cafés. This is where Unter den Linden and Friedrichstrasse\r\nmeet. On the southwest corner there is Kranzler's staid old café, a very\r\nrespectable place, where the lower hall is even reserved for\r\nnon-smokers. On the southeast corner is Café Bauer, known the world\r\nover. However, it has seen better days. It has been outdistanced by\r\ncompetitors. On the northeast corner is the Victoria, a new-style place,\r\nvery bright, and less staid. There no room is reserved for non-smokers,\r\nfor most of the ladies, if they do not themselves smoke, will light the\r\ncigars for their escorts.\r\n\r\nAround the Potsdamer Platz there is a number of cafés. Josty's is\r\nperhaps the most frequented in Berlin. It is the best liked on account\r\nof the trees and terraces in front. Farther to the west, on\r\nKuerfuerstendamm, there are dozens of large cafés.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MORNING COFFEE IN FRONT OF A BOULEVARD CAFÉ, PARIS, WITH\r\nA BRITISH BACKGROUND]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR, CAFÉ BAUER, BERLIN]\r\n\r\nSome of the cafés are meeting-places for certain professions and trades.\r\nThe Admiral's café, in Friedrichstrasse, for instance, is the\r\n\"artistes'\" exchange. All the stage folk and stars of the tanbark meet\r\nthere every day. Chorus girls, tumblers, ladies of the flying trapeze,\r\ncontortionists, and bareback riders are to be found there, discussing\r\ntheir grievances, denouncing their managers, swapping their diamonds,\r\nand recounting former triumphs. Cinema-makers come also to pick out a\r\ncast for a new film play. There one can pick out a full cast every\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nThen there is the Café des Westens in Kuerfuerstendamm, the old one,\r\nwhere dreamers and poets congregate. It is called also Café\r\nGroessenwahn, which means that persons suffering from an exaggerated ego\r\nare conspicuous by their presence and their long hair.\r\n\r\nAt almost every table one may find a poet who has written a play that is\r\nbound to enrich its author and any man of means who will put up the\r\nmoney to build a new theater in which to produce it.\r\n\r\nSaxony and Thuringia are proverbial hotbeds of coffee lovers. It is said\r\nthat in Saxony there are more coffee drinkers to the square inch and\r\nmore cups to the single coffee bean than anywhere else upon earth. The\r\nSaxons like their coffee, but seem to be afraid it may be too strong for\r\nthem. So, when over their cups, they always make certain they can see\r\nbottom before raising the steaming bowl to the lip.\r\n\r\nVon Liebig's method of making coffee, whereby three-fourths of the\r\nquantity to be used is first boiled for ten or fifteen minutes, and the\r\nremainder added for a six-minute steeping or infusion, is religiously\r\nfollowed by some housekeepers. Von Liebig advocated coating the bean\r\nwith sugar. In some families, fats, eggs, and egg-shells are used to\r\nsettle and to clarify the beverage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAFÉ BAUER, UNTER DEN LINDEN, BERLIN]\r\n\r\nCoffee in Germany is better cooked (roasted) and more scientifically\r\nprepared than in many other European countries. In recent years, during\r\nthe World War and since, however, there has been an amazing increase in\r\nthe use of coffee substitutes, so that the German cup of coffee is not\r\nthe pure delight it was once.\r\n\r\nGREECE. Coffee is the most popular and most extensively used\r\nnon-alcoholic beverage in Greece, as it is throughout the Near East. Its\r\nannual per capita consumption there is about two pounds, two-thirds of\r\nthe supply coming _via_ Austria and France, Brazil furnishing direct the\r\nbulk of the remaining third.\r\n\r\nCoffee is given a high or city roast, and is used almost entirely in\r\npowdered form. It is prepared for consumption principally in the Turkish\r\ndemi-tasse way. Finely ground coffee is used even in making ordinary\r\ntable, or breakfast, coffee. In private houses the cylindrical brass\r\nhand-grinders, manufactured in Constantinople, are mostly used. In many\r\nof the coffee houses in the villages and country towns throughout Greece\r\nand the Levant, a heavy iron pestle, wielded by a strong man, is\r\nemployed to pulverize the grains in a heavy stone or marble mortar;\r\nwhile the poorer homes use a small brass pestle and mortar, also\r\nmanufactured in Turkey.\r\n\r\nIn his _The Greeks of the Present Day_[371], Edmond François Valentin\r\nAbout says:\r\n\r\n     The coffee which is drunk in all the Greek houses rather astonishes\r\n     the travellers who have neither seen Turkey nor Algeria. One is\r\n     surprised at finding food in a cup in which one expected drink. Yet\r\n     you get accustomed to this coffee-broth and end by finding it more\r\n     savoury, lighter, more perfumed, and especially more wholesome,\r\n     than the extract of coffee you drink in France.\r\n\r\nThen About gives the recipe of his servant Petros, who is \"the first man\r\nin Athens for coffee\":\r\n\r\n     The grain is roasted without burning it; it is reduced to an\r\n     impalpable powder, either in a mortar or in a very close-grained\r\n     mill. Water is set on the fire till it boils up; it is taken off to\r\n     throw in a spoonful of coffee, and a spoonful of pounded sugar for\r\n     each cup it is intended to make; it is carefully mixed; the coffee\r\n     pot is replaced on the fire until the contents seem ready to boil\r\n     over; it is taken off, and set on again; lastly it is quickly\r\n     poured into the cups. Some coffee drinkers have this preparation\r\n     boiled as many as five times. Petros makes a rule of not putting\r\n     his coffee more than three times on the fire. He takes care in\r\n     filling the cups to divide impartially the coloured froth which\r\n     rises above the coffee pot; it is the _kaimaki_ of the coffee. A\r\n     cup without _kaimaki_ is disgraced.\r\n\r\n     When the coffee is poured out you are at liberty to drink it\r\n     boiling and muddy, or cold and clear. Real amateurs drink it\r\n     without waiting. Those who allow the sediment to settle down, do\r\n     not do so from contempt, for they afterwards collect it with the\r\n     little finger and eat it carefully.\r\n\r\n     Thus prepared, coffee may be taken without inconvenience ten times\r\n     a day: five cups of French coffee could not be drunk with impunity\r\n     every day. It is because the coffee of the Turks and the Greeks is\r\n     a diluted tonic, and ours is a concentrated tonic.\r\n\r\n     I have met at Paris many people who took their coffee without\r\n     sugar, to imitate the Orientals. I think I ought to give them\r\n     notice, between ourselves, that in the great coffee-houses of\r\n     Athens, sugar is always presented with the coffee; in the khans and\r\n     second-rate coffee-houses, it is served already sugared; and that\r\n     at Smyrna and Constantinople, it has everywhere been brought to me\r\n     sugared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KRANZLER'S, UNTER DEN LINDEN, BERLIN]\r\n\r\nITALY. In Italy coffee is roasted in a wholesale and retail way as well\r\nas in the home. French, German, Dutch, and Italian machines are used.\r\nThe full city, or Italian, roast is favored. There are cafés as in\r\nFrance and other continental countries, and the drink is prepared in the\r\nFrench fashion. For restaurants and hotels, rapid filtering machines,\r\nfirst developed by the French and Italians, are used. In the homes,\r\npercolators and filtration devices are employed.\r\n\r\nThe De Mattia Brothers have a process designed to conserve the aroma in\r\nroasting. The Italians pay particular attention to the temperature in\r\nroasting and in the cooling operation. There is considerable glazing,\r\nand many coffee additions are used.\r\n\r\nLike the French, the Italians make much of _café au lait_ for breakfast.\r\nAt dinner, the _café noir_ is served.\r\n\r\nCafés of the French school are to be found along the Corso in Rome, the\r\nToledo in Naples, in the Galleria Vittorio Emanuel and the Piazza del\r\nDuomo in Milan, and in the arcades surrounding the Piazza de San Marco\r\nin Venice, where Florian's still flourishes.\r\n\r\nNETHERLANDS. In the Netherlands, too, the French café is a delightful\r\nfeature of the life of the larger cities. The Dutch roast coffee\r\nproperly, and make it well. The service is in individual pots, or in\r\ndemi-tasses on a silver, nickle, or brass tray, and accompanied by a\r\nminiature pitcher containing just enough cream (usually whipped), a\r\nsmall dish about the size of an individual butter plate holding three\r\nsquares of sugar, and a slender glass of water. This service is\r\nuniversal; the glass of water always goes with the coffee. It is the one\r\nsure way for Americans to get a drink of water. It is the custom in\r\nHolland to repair to some open-air café or indoor coffee house for the\r\nafter-dinner cup of coffee. One seldom takes his coffee in the place\r\nwhere he has his dinner. These cafés are many, and some are elaborately\r\ndesigned and furnished. One of the most interesting is the St. Joris at\r\nthe Hague, furnished in the old Dutch style. The approved way of making\r\ncoffee in Holland is the French drip method.\r\n\r\nNORWAY AND SWEDEN. French and German influences mark the roasting,\r\ngrinding, preparing, and serving of coffee in Norway and Sweden.\r\nGenerally speaking, not so much chicory is used, and a great deal of\r\nwhipped cream is employed. In Norway, the boiling method has many\r\nfollowers. A big (open) copper kettle is used. This is filled with\r\nwater, and the coffee is dumped in and boiled. In the poorer-class\r\ncountry homes, the copper kettle is brought to the table and set upon a\r\nwooden plate. The coffee is served directly from the kettle in cups. In\r\nbetter-class homes, the coffee is poured from the kettle into silver\r\ncoffee pots in the kitchen, and the silver coffee pots are brought to\r\nthe table. The only thing approaching coffee houses are the \"coffee\r\nrooms\" which are to be found in Christiania. These are small one-room\r\naffairs in which the plainer sorts of foods, such as porridge, may be\r\npurchased with the coffee. They are cheap, and are largely frequented by\r\nthe poorer class of students, who use them as places in which to study\r\nwhile they drink their coffee.\r\n\r\nIn RUSSIA and SWITZERLAND, French and German methods obtain. Russia,\r\nhowever, drinks more tea than coffee, which by the masses is prepared in\r\nTurkish fashion, when obtainable. Usually, the coffee is only a cheap\r\n\"substitute.\" The so-called _café à la Russe_ of the aristocracy, is\r\nstrong black coffee flavored with lemon. Another Russian recipe calls\r\nfor the coffee to be placed in a large punch bowl, and covered with a\r\nlayer of finely chopped apples and pears; then cognac is poured over the\r\nmass, and a match applied.\r\n\r\nROUMANIA and SERVIA drink coffee prepared after either the Turkish or\r\nthe French style, depending on the class of the drinker and where it is\r\nserved. Substitutes are numerous.\r\n\r\nIn SPAIN and PORTUGAL the French type of café flourishes as in Italy. In\r\nMadrid, some delightful cafés are to be found around the Puerto del Sol,\r\nwhere coffee and chocolate are the favorite drinks. The coffee is made\r\nby the drip process, and is served in French fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Manners and Customs in North America_\r\n\r\nThe introduction of coffee and tea into North America effected a great\r\nchange in the meal-time beverages of the people. Malt beverages had been\r\nsucceeded by alcoholic spirits and by cider. These in turn were\r\nsupplanted by tea and coffee.\r\n\r\nCANADA. In Canada, we find both French and English influences at work in\r\nthe preparation and serving of the beverage; \"Yankee\" ideas also have\r\nentered from across the border. Some years back (about 1910) A. McGill,\r\nchief chemist of the Canadian Inland Revenue Department, suggested an\r\nimprovement upon Baron von Liebig's method, whereby Canadians might\r\nobtain an ideal cup of coffee. It was to combine two well-known methods.\r\nOne was to boil a quantity of ground coffee to get a maximum of body or\r\nsoluble matter. The other was to percolate a similar quantity to get the\r\nneeded caffeol. By combining the decoction and the infusion, a finished\r\nbeverage rich in body and aroma might be had. Most Canadians continue to\r\ndrink tea, however, although coffee consumption is increasing.\r\n\r\nMEXICO. In Mexico, the natives have a custom peculiarly their own. The\r\nroasted beans are pounded to a powder in a cloth bag which is then\r\nimmersed in a pot of boiling water and milk. The _vaquero_, however,\r\npours boiling water on the powdered coffee in his drinking cup, and\r\nsweetens it with a brown sugar stick.\r\n\r\nAmong the upper classes in Mexico the following interesting method\r\nobtains for making coffee:\r\n\r\n     Roast one pound until the beans are brown inside. Mix with the\r\n     roasted coffee one teaspoonful of butter, one of sugar, and a\r\n     little brandy. Cover with a thick cloth. Cool for one hour; then\r\n     grind. Boil one quart of water. When boiling, put in the coffee and\r\n     remove from fire immediately. Let it stand a few hours, and strain\r\n     through a flannel bag, and keep in a stone jar until required for\r\n     use; then heat quantity required.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIDEWALK CAFÉ, LISBON]\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES. In no country has there been so marked an improvement in\r\ncoffee making as in the United States. Although in many parts, the\r\nnational beverage is still indifferently prepared, the progress made in\r\nrecent years has been so great that the friends of coffee are hopeful\r\nthat before long it may be said truly that coffee making in America is a\r\nnational honor and no longer the national disgrace that it was in the\r\npast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THESE COFFEE POTS ARE WIDELY USED IN SWEDEN FOR BOILING\r\nCOFFEE\r\n\r\nLeft, copper pot with wooden handle and iron legs designed to stand in\r\nthe coals--Center, glass-globe pot, for stove use, enclosed in\r\nfelt-lined brass cosey--Right, hand-made hammered-brass kettle for stove\r\nuse]\r\n\r\nAlready, in the more progressive homes, and in the best hotels and\r\nrestaurants, the coffee is uniformly good, and the service all that it\r\nshould be. The American breakfast cup is a food-beverage because of the\r\nadditions of milk or cream and sugar; and unlike Europe, this same\r\ngenerous cup serves again as a necessary part of the noonday and evening\r\nmeals for most people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COFFEE ROOM OF THE HOTEL ADOLPHUS, DALLAS, TEXAS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DAY-AND-NIGHT COFFEE ROOM, RICE HOTEL, HOUSTON, TEXAS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOTEL BARS REPLACED BY COFFEE ROOMS IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nOne effect of prohibition has been to lead many hotels to feature their\r\ncoffee service, bringing back the modern type of coffee room illustrated\r\nabove]\r\n\r\nThe important and indispensable part that sugar plays in the make-up of\r\nthe American cup of coffee was ably set forth by Fred Mason,[372]\r\nvice-president of the American Sugar Refining Co., when he said:\r\n\r\n     The coffee cup and the sugar bowl are inseparable table companions.\r\n     Most of us did not realize this until the war came, with its\r\n     attendant restrictions on everything we did, and we found that the\r\n     sugar bowl had disappeared from all public eating places. No longer\r\n     could we make an unlimited number of trips to the sugar bowl to\r\n     sweeten our coffee; but we had to be content with what was doled\r\n     out to us with scrupulous care--a quantity so small at times that\r\n     it gave only a hint of sweetness to our national beverage.\r\n\r\n     Then it was that we really appreciated how indispensable the proper\r\n     amount of sugar was to a good, savory cup of coffee, and we missed\r\n     it as much as we would seasoning from certain cooked foods.\r\n     Secretly we consoled ourselves with the promise that if the day\r\n     ever came when sugar bowls made their appearance once more, filled\r\n     temptingly with the sweet granules that were \"gone but not\r\n     forgotten,\" we should put an extra lump or an additional spoonful\r\n     of sugar into our coffee to help us forget the joyless war days.\r\n\r\n     Since sugar is so necessary to our enjoyment of this popular\r\n     beverage, it is obvious that a considerable part of all the sugar\r\n     we consume must find its way into the national coffee cup. The\r\n     stupendous amount of 40,000,000,000 cups of coffee is consumed in\r\n     this country each year. Taking two teaspoonfuls or two lumps as a\r\n     fair average per cup, we find that about 800,000,000 pounds of\r\n     sugar, almost one-tenth of our total annual consumption, are\r\n     required to sweeten Uncle Sam's coffee cup. This is specially\r\n     significant when one considers that, with the single exception of\r\n     Australia, the United States consumes more sugar per capita than\r\n     any country on earth.\r\n\r\n     Sugar adds high food value to the stimulative virtues of coffee.\r\n     The beverage itself stimulates the mental and physical powers,\r\n     while the sugar it contains is fuel for the body and furnishes it\r\n     with energy. Sugar is such a concentrated food that the amount used\r\n     by the average person in two cups of coffee is enough to furnish\r\n     the system with more energy than could be derived from 40 oysters\r\n     on the half-shell.\r\n\r\nSince prohibition, the average citizen is drinking one hundred more cups\r\nof coffee a year than he did in the old days; and a good part of the\r\nincrease is attributed to newly formed habits of drinking coffee between\r\nmeals, at soda fountains, in tea and coffee shops, at hotels, and even\r\nin the homes. In other words, the increase is due to coffee drinking\r\nthat directly takes the place of malt and spirituous liquors. There have\r\ncome into being the hotel coffee room; the custom of afternoon coffee\r\ndrinking; and free coffee-service in many factories, stores, and\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nIn colonial days, must or ale first gave way to tea, and then to coffee\r\nas a breakfast beverage. The Boston \"tea party\" clinched the case for\r\ncoffee; but in the meantime, coffee was more or less of an after-dinner\r\nfunction, or a between-meals drink, as in Europe. In Washington's time,\r\ndinner was usually served at three o'clock in the afternoon, and at\r\ninformal dinner parties the company \"sat till sunset--then coffee.\"\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the nineteenth century, coffee became firmly\r\nintrenched as the one great American breakfast beverage; and its\r\nsecurity in this position would seem to be unassailable for all time.\r\n\r\nToday, all classes in the United States begin and end the day with\r\ncoffee. In the home, it is prepared by boiling, infusion or steeping,\r\npercolation, and filtration; in the hotels and restaurants, by infusion,\r\npercolation, and filtration. The best practise favors true percolation\r\n(French drip), or filtration.\r\n\r\nSteeping coffee in American homes (an English heirloom) is usually\r\nperformed in a china or earthenware jug. The ground coffee has boiling\r\nwater poured upon it until the jug is half full. The infusion is stirred\r\nbriskly. Next, the jug is filled by pouring in the remainder of the\r\nboiling water, the infusion is again stirred, then permitted to settle,\r\nand finally is poured through a strainer or filter cloth before serving.\r\n\r\nWhen a pumping percolator or a double glass filtration device is used,\r\nthe water may be cold or boiling at the beginning as the maker prefers.\r\nSome wet the coffee with cold water before starting the brewing process.\r\n\r\nFor genuine percolator, or drip coffee, French and Austrian china drip\r\npots are mostly employed. The latest filtration devices are described in\r\nchapter XXXIV.\r\n\r\nThe Creole, or French market, coffee for which New Orleans has long been\r\nfamous is made from a concentrated coffee extract prepared in a drip\r\npot. First, the ground coffee has poured over it sufficient boiling\r\nwater thoroughly to dampen it, after which further additions of boiling\r\nwater, a tablespoonful at a time, are poured upon it at five minute\r\nintervals. The resulting extract is kept in a tightly corked bottle for\r\nmaking _café au lait_ or _café noir_ as required. A variant of the\r\nCreole method is to brown three tablespoonfuls of sugar in a pan, to add\r\na cup of water, and to allow it to simmer until the sugar is dissolved;\r\nto pour this liquid over ground coffee in a drip pot, to add boiling\r\nwater as required, and to serve black or with cream or hot milk, as\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nIn New Orleans, coffee is often served at the bedside upon waking, as a\r\nkind of early breakfast function.\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876 served to introduce the\r\nVienna café to America. Fleischmann's Vienna Café and Bakery was a\r\nfeature of our first international exposition. Afterward, it was\r\ntransferred to Broadway, New York, where for many years it continued to\r\nserve excellent coffee in Vienna style next door to Grace Church.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is still waiting for the courageous soul who will bring\r\nback to our larger cities this Vienna café or some Americanized form of\r\nthe continental or sidewalk café, making a specialty of tea, coffee, and\r\nchocolate.\r\n\r\nThe old Astor House was famous for its coffee for many years, as was\r\nalso Dorlon's from 1840 to 1922.\r\n\r\nMembers of the family of the late Colonel Roosevelt began to promote a\r\nBrazil coffee-house enterprise in New York in 1919. It was first called\r\nCafé Paulista, but it is now known as the Double R coffee house, or Club\r\nof South America, with a Brazil branch in the 40's and an Argentine\r\nbranch on Lexington Avenue. Coffee is made and served in Brazilian\r\nstyle; that is, full city roast, pulverized grind, filtration made;\r\nservice, black or with hot milk. Sandwiches, cakes, and crullers are\r\nalso to be had.\r\n\r\nOne of New York's newest clubs is known as the Coffee House. It is in\r\nWest Forty-fifth Street, and has been in existence since December, 1915,\r\nwhen it was opened with an informal dinner, at which the late Joseph H.\r\nChoate, one of the original members, outlined the purpose and policies\r\nof the club.\r\n\r\nThe founders of the Coffee House were convinced--as the result of the\r\nhigh dues and constantly increasing formality and discipline in the\r\nsocial clubs in New York--that there was need here for a moderate-priced\r\neating and meeting place, which should be run in the simplest possible\r\nway and with the least possible expense.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of its career, the club framed, adopted, and has since\r\nlived up to, a most informal constitution: \"No officers, no liveries, no\r\ntips, no set speeches, no charge accounts, no RULES.\"\r\n\r\nThe membership is made up, for the most part, of painters, writers,\r\nsculptors, architects, actors, and members of other professions. Members\r\nare expected to pay cash for all orders. There are no proposals of\r\ncandidates for membership. The club invites to join it those whom it\r\nbelieves to be in sympathy with the ideals of its founders.\r\n\r\nThe method of preparing coffee for individual service in the\r\nWaldorf-Astoria, New York, which has been adopted by many first-class\r\nhotels and restaurants that do not serve urn-made coffee exclusively, is\r\nthe French drip plus careful attention to all the contributing factors\r\nfor making coffee in perfection, and is thus described by the hotel's\r\nsteward:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRITANNIA COFFEE POT FROM WHICH ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS OFTEN\r\nSERVED IN NEW SALEM\r\n\r\nIts story is told on page 614]\r\n\r\n     A French china drip coffee pot is used. It is kept in a warm\r\n     heater; and when the coffee is ordered, this pot is scalded with\r\n     hot water. A level tablespoonful of coffee, ground to about the\r\n     consistency of granulated sugar, is put into the upper and\r\n     percolator part of the coffee pot. Fresh boiling water is then\r\n     poured through the coffee and allowed to percolate into the lower\r\n     part of the pot. The secret of success, according to our\r\n     experience, lies in having the coffee freshly ground, and the water\r\n     as near the boiling point as possible, all during the process. For\r\n     this reason, the coffee pot should be placed on a gas stove or\r\n     range. The quantity of coffee can be varied to suit individual\r\n     taste. We use about ten percent more ground coffee for after dinner\r\n     cups than we do for breakfast. Our coffee is a mixture of Old\r\n     Government Java and Bogota.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE SERVICE, HOTEL ASTOR, NEW YORK]\r\n\r\nC. Scotty, chef at the Hotel Ambassador, New York, thus describes the\r\nmethod of making coffee in that hostelry:\r\n\r\n     In the first place, it is essential that the coffee be of the\r\n     finest quality obtainable; secondly, better results are obtained by\r\n     using the French filterer, or coffee bag.\r\n\r\n     Twelve ounces of coffee to one gallon of water for breakfast.\r\n\r\n     Sixteen ounces of coffee to one gallon of water for dinner.\r\n\r\n     Boiling water should be poured over the coffee, sifoned, and put\r\n     back several times. We do not allow the coffee grounds to remain in\r\n     the urn for more than fifteen to twenty minutes at any time.\r\n\r\nThe coffee service at the best hotels is usually in silver pots and\r\npitchers, and includes the freshly made coffee, hot milk or cream\r\n(sometimes both), and domino sugar.\r\n\r\nWithin the last year (1921) many of the leading hotels, and some of the\r\nbig railway systems, have adopted the custom of serving free a\r\ndemi-tasse of coffee as soon as the guest-traveler seats himself at the\r\nbreakfast table or in the dining car. \"Small blacks,\" the waiters call\r\nthem, or \"coffee cocktails,\" according to their fancy.\r\n\r\nAt the Pequot coffee house, 91 Water Street, New York, a noonday\r\nrestaurant in the heart of the coffee trade, an attempt has been made to\r\nintroduce something of the old-time coffee house atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe Childs chain of restaurants recently began printing on its menus, in\r\nbrackets before each item, the number of calories as computed by an\r\nexpert in nutrition. Coffee with a mixture of milk and cream is credited\r\nwith eighty-five calories, a well known coffee substitute with seventy\r\ncalories, and tea with eighteen calories. The Childs chain of 92\r\nrestaurants serves 40,000,000 cups of coffee a year, made from 375 tons\r\nof ground coffee, and figuring an average of 53 cups to the pound.\r\n\r\nThe Thompson chain of one hundred restaurants serves 160,000 cups of\r\ncoffee per day, or more than 58,000,000 cups per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Customs in South America_\r\n\r\nARGENTINE. Coffee is very popular as a beverage in Argentina. _Café con\r\nléche_--coffee with milk, in which the proportion of coffee may vary\r\nfrom one-fourth to two-thirds--is the usual Argentine breakfast\r\nbeverage. A small cup of coffee is generally taken after meals, and it\r\nis also consumed to a considerable extent in cafés.\r\n\r\nBRAZIL. In Brazil every one drinks coffee and at all hours. Cafés making\r\na specialty of the beverage, and modeled after continental originals,\r\nare to be found a-plenty in Rio de Janeiro, Santos, and other large\r\ncities. The custom prevails of roasting the beans high, almost to\r\ncarbonization, grinding them fine, and then boiling after the Turkish\r\nfashion, percolating in French drip pots, steeping in cold water for\r\nseveral hours, straining and heating the liquid for use as needed, or\r\nfiltering by means of conical linen sacks suspended from wire rings.\r\n\r\nThe Brazilian loves to frequent the cafés and to sip his coffee at his\r\nease. He is very continental in this respect. The wide-open doors, and\r\nthe round-topped marble tables, with their small cups and saucers set\r\naround a sugar basin, make inviting pictures. The customer pulls toward\r\nhim one of the cups and immediately a waiter comes and fills it with\r\ncoffee, the charge for which is about three cents. It is a common thing\r\nfor a Brazilian to consume one dozen to two dozen cups of black coffee a\r\nday. If one pays a social visit, calls upon the president of the\r\nRepublic, or any lesser official, or on a business acquaintance, it is a\r\nsignal for an attendant to serve coffee. _Café au lait_ is popular in\r\nthe morning; but except for this service, milk or cream is never used.\r\nIn Brazil, as in the Orient, coffee is a symbol of hospitality.\r\n\r\nIn CHILE, PARAGUAY and URUGUAY, very much the same customs prevail of\r\nmaking and serving the beverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Drinking in Other Countries_\r\n\r\nIn AUSTRALIA and NEW ZEALAND, English methods for roasting, grinding,\r\nand making coffee are standard. The beverage usually contains thirty to\r\nforty percent chicory. In the bush, the water is boiled in a billy can.\r\nThen the powdered coffee is added; and when the liquid comes again to a\r\nboil, the coffee is done. In the cities, practically the same method is\r\nfollowed. The general rule in the antipodes seems to be to \"let it come\r\nto a boil\", and then to remove it from the fire.\r\n\r\nIn CUBA the custom is to grind the coffee fine, to put it in a flannel\r\nsack suspended over a receiving vessel, and to pour cold water on it.\r\nThis is repeated many times, until the coffee mass is well saturated.\r\nThe first drippings are repoured over the bag. The final result is a\r\nhighly concentrated extract, which serves for making _café au lait_, or\r\n_café noir_, as desired.\r\n\r\nIn MARTINIQUE, coffee is made after the French fashion. In PANAMA,\r\nFrench and American methods obtain; as also in the PHILIPPINES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF THE UNIVERSAL BEVERAGE\r\n\r\n     _The evolution of grinding and brewing methods--Coffee was first a\r\n     food, then a wine, a medicine, a devotional refreshment, a\r\n     confection, and finally a beverage--Brewing by boiling, infusion,\r\n     percolation, and filtration--Coffee making in Europe in the\r\n     nineteenth century--Early coffee making in the United\r\n     States--Latest developments in better coffee making--Various\r\n     aspects of scientific coffee brewing--Advice to coffee lovers on\r\n     how to buy coffee, and how to make it in perfection_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coffee drink has had a curious evolution. It began, not as a drink,\r\nbut as a food ration. Its first use as a drink was as a kind of wine.\r\nCivilization knew it first as a medicine. At one stage of its\r\ndevelopment, before it became generally accepted as a liquid\r\nrefreshment, the berries found favor as a confection. As a beverage, its\r\nuse probably dates back about six hundred years.\r\n\r\nThe protein and fat content, that is, the food value, of coffee, so far\r\nas civilized man is concerned, is an absolute waste. The only\r\nconstituents that are of value are those that are water soluble, and can\r\nbe extracted readily with hot water. When coffee is properly made, as by\r\nthe drip method, either by percolation or filtration, the ground coffee\r\ncomes in contact with the hot water for only a few minutes; so the major\r\nportion of the protein, which is not only practically insoluble, but\r\ncoagulates on heating, remains in the unused part of the coffee, the\r\ngrounds. The coffee bean contains a large percent of protein--fourteen\r\npercent. By comparing this figure with twenty-one percent of protein in\r\npeas, twenty-three percent in lentils, twenty-six percent in beans,\r\ntwenty-four percent in peanuts, about eleven percent in wheat flour, and\r\nless than nine percent in white bread, we learn how much of this\r\nvaluable food stuff is lost with the coffee grounds[373].\r\n\r\nThough civilized man (excepting the inhabitants of the Isle de Groix off\r\nthe coast of Brittany) does not use this protein content of coffee, in\r\ncertain parts of Africa it has been put to use in a very ingenious and\r\neffective manner \"from time immemorial\" down to the present day. James\r\nBruce, the Scottish explorer, in his travels to discover the source of\r\nthe Nile in 1768-73, found that this curious use of the coffee bean had\r\nbeen known for centuries. He brought back accounts and specimens of its\r\nuse as a food in the shape of balls made of grease mixed with roasted\r\ncoffee finely ground between stones.\r\n\r\nOther writers have told how the Galla, a wandering tribe of Africa--and\r\nlike most wandering tribes, a warlike one--find it necessary to carry\r\nconcentrated food on their long marches. Before starting on their\r\nmarauding excursions, each warrior equips himself with a number of food\r\nballs. These prototypes of the modern food tablet are about the size of\r\na billiard ball, and consist of pulverized coffee held in shape with\r\nfat. One ball constitutes a day's ration; and although civilized man\r\nmight find it unpalatable, from the purely physiological standpoint it\r\nis not only a concentrated and efficient food, but it also has the\r\nadditional advantage of containing a valuable stimulant in the caffein\r\ncontent which spurs the warrior on to maximum effort. And so the savage\r\nin the African jungle has apparently solved two problems; the\r\nutilization of coffee's protein, and the production of a concentrated\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nFurther research shows that perhaps as early as 800 A.D. this practise\r\nstarted by crushing the whole ripe berries, beans and hulls, in mortars,\r\nmixing them with fats, and rounding them into food balls. Later, the\r\ndried berries were so used. The inhabitants of Groix, also, thrive on a\r\ndiet that includes roasted coffee beans.\r\n\r\nAbout 900, a kind of aromatic wine was made in Africa from the fermented\r\njuice of the hulls and pulp of the ripe berries[374].\r\n\r\nPayen says that the first coffee drinkers did not think of roasting but,\r\nimpressed by the aroma of the dried beans, they put them in cold water\r\nand drank the liquor saturated with their aromatic principles. Crushing\r\nthe raw beans and hulls, and steeping them in water, was a later\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nIt appears that boiled coffee (the name is anathema today) was invented\r\nabout the year 1000 A.D. Even then, the beans were not roasted. We read\r\nof their use in medicine in the form of a decoction. The dried fruit,\r\nbeans and hulls, were boiled in stone or clay cauldrons. The custom of\r\nusing the sun-dried hulls, without roasting, still exists in Africa,\r\nArabia, and parts of southern Asia. The natives of Sumatra neglect the\r\nfruit of the coffee tree and use the leaves to make a tea-like infusion.\r\nJardin relates that in Guiana an agreeable tea is made by drying the\r\nyoung buds of the coffee tree, and rolling them on a copper plate\r\nslightly heated. In Uganda, the natives eat the raw berries; from\r\nbananas and coffee they make also a sweet, savory drink which is called\r\n_menghai_.\r\n\r\nAbout 1200, the practise was common of making a decoction from the dried\r\nhulls alone. There followed the discovery that roasting improved the\r\nflavor. Even today, this drink known as Sultan or Sultana coffee, _café\r\nà la sultane_, or _kisher_, continues in favor in Arabia. Credit for the\r\ninvention of this beverage has been wrongfully given by various French\r\nwriters to Doctor Andry, director of the Faculty of Medicine in Paris.\r\nDr. Andry had his own recipe for making _café à la sultane_, which was\r\nto boil the coffee hulls for half an hour. This gave a lemon-colored\r\nliquid which was drunk with a little sugar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY COFFEE MAKING IN PERSIA\r\n\r\nShowing leather bag for green beans, roasting plate, grinder, boiler,\r\nand serving cups]\r\n\r\nThe Oriental procedure was to toast the hulls in an earthenware pot over\r\na charcoal fire, mixing in with them a small quantity of the silver\r\nskins, and turning them over until they were slightly parched. The hulls\r\nand silver skins, in proportions of four to one, were then thrown into\r\nboiling water and well boiled again for at least a half-hour. The color\r\nof the drink had some resemblance to the best English beer, La Roque\r\nassures us, and it required no sweetening, \"there being no bitterness to\r\ncorrect.\" This was still the coffee drink of the court of Yemen, and of\r\npeople of distinction in the Levant, when La Roque and his\r\nfellow-travelers made their celebrated voyage to Arabia the Happy in\r\n1711-13.\r\n\r\nSome time in the thirteenth century, the practise began of roasting the\r\ndried beans, after the hulling process. This was done first in crude\r\nstone and earthenware trays, and later on metal plates, as described in\r\nchapter XXXIV. A liquor was made from boiling the whole roasted beans.\r\nThe next step was to pound the roasted beans to a powder with a mortar\r\nand pestle; and the decoction was then made by throwing the powder into\r\nboiling water, the drink being swallowed in its entirety, grounds and\r\nall. It was a decoction for the next four centuries.\r\n\r\nWhen the long-handled Arabian metal boiler made its appearance in the\r\nearly part of the sixteenth century, the method of preparation and\r\nservice had much improved. The Arabs and the Turks had made it a social\r\nadjunct, and its use was no longer confined to the physicians and the\r\nchurchmen. It had become a stimulating refreshment for all the people;\r\nand at the same time, the Arabians and the Turks had developed a coffee\r\nceremony for the higher classes which was quite as wonderful as the tea\r\nceremony of Japan.\r\n\r\nThe common early method of preparation throughout the Levant was to\r\nsteep the powder in water for a day, to boil the liquor half away, to\r\nstrain it, and to keep it in earthen pots for use as wanted. In the\r\nsixteenth century, the small coffee boiler, or _ibrik_, caused the\r\npractise to be more of an instantaneous affair. The coffee was ground,\r\nand the powder was dropped into the boiling water, to be withdrawn from\r\nthe fire several times as it boiled up to the rim. While still boiling,\r\ncinnamon and cloves were sometimes added before pouring the liquid off\r\ninto the findjans, or little china cups, to be served with the addition\r\nof a drop of essence of amber. Later, the Turks added sugar during the\r\nboiling process.\r\n\r\nFrom the first simple uncovered _ibrik_ there was developed, about the\r\nmiddle of the seventeenth century, a larger-size covered coffee boiler,\r\nthe forerunner of the modern combination brewing and serving pot. This\r\nwas a copper-plated kettle patterned after the oriental ewer with a\r\nbroad base, bulbous body, and narrow neck. After having poured into it\r\none and a half times as much water as the dish (cup) in which the drink\r\nwas to be served would hold, the pot was placed on a lively fire. When\r\nthe water boiled, the powdered coffee was tossed into the pot; and, as\r\nthe liquid boiled up, it was taken from the fire and returned, probably\r\na dozen times. Then the pot was placed in hot ashes to permit the\r\ngrounds to settle. This done, the drink was served. Dufour, describing\r\nthis process as practised in Turkey and Arabia, says:\r\n\r\n     One ought not to drink coffee, but suck it in as hot as one can. In\r\n     order not to be burned, it is not necessary to place the tongue in\r\n     the cup but hold the edge against the tongue with the lips above\r\n     and below it, forcing it so little that the edges do not bear down,\r\n     and then suck in; that is to say, swallow it sip by sip. If one is\r\n     so delicate he can not stand the bitterness, he can temper it with\r\n     sugar. It is a mistake to stir the coffee in the pot, the grounds\r\n     being worth nothing. In the Levant it is only the scum of the\r\n     people who swallow the grounds.\r\n\r\nLa Roque says:\r\n\r\n     The Arabians, when they take their coffee off the fire, immediately\r\n     wrap the vessel in a wet cloth which fines the liquor instantly,\r\n     makes it cream at the top and occasion a more pungent steam, which\r\n     they take great pleasure in snuffing up as the coffee is pouring\r\n     into the cups. They, like all other nations of the East, drink\r\n     their coffee without sugar.\r\n\r\nSome of the Orientals afterward modified the early coffee-making\r\nprocedure by pouring the boiling water on the powdered coffee in the\r\nserving cups. They thus obtained \"a foaming and perfumed beverage,\" says\r\nJardin, \"to which we (the French) could not accustom ourselves because\r\nof the powder which remains in suspension. Nevertheless, clarified\r\ncoffee may be obtained in the Orient. In Mecca, in order to filter it,\r\nthey strain it through stopples of dried herbs, put into the opening of\r\na jar.\"\r\n\r\nSugar seems to have been introduced into coffee in Cairo about 1625.\r\nVeslingius records that the coffee drinkers in Cairo's three thousand\r\ncoffee houses \"did begin to put sugar in their coffee to correct the\r\nbitterness of it\", and that \"others made sugar plums of the coffee\r\nberries\". This coffee confection later appeared in Paris, and about the\r\nsame time (1700) at Montpellier was introduced a coffee water, \"a sort\r\nof rosa-folis of an agreeable scent that has somewhat of the smell of\r\ncoffee roasted.\" These novelties, however, were designed to please only\r\n\"the most nice lovers of coffee\"; for _ennui_ and boredom demanded new\r\nsensations then as now.\r\n\r\nBoiling continued the favorite method of preparing the beverage until\r\nwell into the eighteenth century. Meanwhile, we learn from English\r\nreferences that it was the custom to buy the beans of apothecaries, to\r\ndry them in an oven, or to roast them in an old pudding dish or frying\r\npan before pounding them to a powder with mortar and pestle, to force\r\nthe powder through a lawn sieve, and then to boil it with spring water\r\nfor a quarter of an hour. The following recipe from a rare book\r\npublished in London, 1662, details the manner of making coffee in the\r\nseventeenth century:\r\n\r\n\r\nCOFFEE MAKING IN 1662\r\n\r\n     To make the drink that is now much used called coffee.\r\n\r\n     The coffee-berries are to be bought at any Druggist, about three\r\n     shillings the pound; take what quantity you please, and over a\r\n     charcoal fire, in an old pudding-pan or frying-pan, keep them\r\n     always stirring until they be quite black, and when you crack one\r\n     with your teeth that it is black within as it is without; yet if\r\n     you exceed, then do you waste the Oyl, which only makes the drink;\r\n     and if less, then will it not deliver its Oyl, which must make the\r\n     drink; and if you should continue fire till it be white, it will\r\n     then make no coffee, but only give you its salt. The Berry prepared\r\n     as above, beaten and forced through a Lawn Sive, is then fit for\r\n     use.\r\n\r\n     Take clean water, and boil one-third of it away what quantity\r\n     soever it be, and it is fit for use. Take one quart of this\r\n     prepared Water, put in it one ounce of your prepared coffee, and\r\n     boil it gently one-quarter of an hour, and it is fit for your use;\r\n     drink one-quarter of a pint as hot as you can sip it.\r\n\r\nIn England, about this time, the coffee drink was not infrequently mixed\r\nwith sugar candy, and even with mustard. In the coffee houses, however,\r\nit was usually served black, without sugar or milk.\r\n\r\nAbout 1660, Nieuhoff, the Dutch ambassador to China, was the first to\r\nmake a trial of coffee with milk in imitation of tea with milk. In 1685,\r\nSieur Monin, a celebrated doctor of Grenoble, France, first recommended\r\n_café au lait_ as a medicine. He prepared it thus: Place on the fire a\r\nbowl of milk. When it begins to rise, throw in to it a bowl of powdered\r\ncoffee, a bowl of moist sugar, and let it boil for some time.\r\n\r\nWe read that in 1669 \"coffee in France was a hot black decoction of\r\nmuddy grounds thickened with syrup.\"\r\n\r\nAngelo Rambaldi in his _Ambrosia Arabica_ thus describes coffee making\r\nin Italy and other European countries in 1691:\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE VASE FOR MAKING THE\r\nDECOCTION, DOSE OF POWDER AND OF THE\r\nWATER NECESSARY AND TIME OF\r\nBOILING IT.\r\n\r\n     Two such vessels having a large paunch to reach the fire, two\r\n     others with long necks and narrow, with a cover to restrain their\r\n     spirituous and volatile particles which when thrown off by the heat\r\n     are easily lost. These vessels are called Ibriq in Arabia. They are\r\n     made of copper--coated with white outside and inside. We, who do\r\n     not possess the art of making them should select an earth vitriate,\r\n     sulphate of copper, or any other material adapted for kitchen ware:\r\n     it might even be of silver.\r\n\r\n     The quantity of water and powder has no certain rule, by reason of\r\n     the difference of our nature and tastes, and each one after some\r\n     experience will use his own judgment to adjust it to his desire and\r\n     liking.\r\n\r\n     Maronita infused two ounces of powder in three litres of water.\r\n     Cotovico in his voyage to Jerusalem affirms that he has observed\r\n     six ounces of the former to 20 litres of the latter, boiled until\r\n     it was reduced to half the quantity. Thévenot asserts that the\r\n     Turks in three cups of water are contented with a good spoonful of\r\n     powder. I have observed however that in Africa, France and England,\r\n     into about six ounces of water (which with them is one cup) a dram\r\n     of the powder is infused and this agrees with my taste--but I have\r\n     wished at times to change the dose.\r\n\r\n     Others put the water into the vase and when it begins to boil add\r\n     the powder, but because it is full of spirit at the first contact\r\n     with the heat it rises and boils over the edge of the vase. Take it\r\n     away from the fire till the boiling ceases, then put it on the fire\r\n     again and let it stay a short time boiling with the cover on: Stand\r\n     it on warm ashes until it settles, after which slowly pour a little\r\n     of the decoction into an earthen vessel, or one of porcelain or any\r\n     other kind, as hot as can be borne, and drink a sip; if it pleases\r\n     your taste, add a portion of cardamom, cloves, nutmeg or cinnamon,\r\n     and dissolve a little sugar in the water; yet because these\r\n     substances will alter the taste of this simple, they are not prized\r\n     by many experts.\r\n\r\n     Modern Arabia, Bassa, Turkey, the Great Orient, those who are\r\n     travelling or in the army, infuse the powder in cold water, and\r\n     then boiling it as directed above, bear witness to its efficacy.\r\n     All times are opportune to take this salutary drink (beverage).\r\n     Among the Turks are those who take it even by night, nor is there a\r\n     business meeting or conversation, where coffee is not taken. Among\r\n     the Great it would be accounted an incivility, if with smoke,\r\n     coffee were not offered: and no one in the day is ashamed to\r\n     frequent the bazaars where it is sold. When I was in London, that\r\n     city of three million people, there were taverns for its special\r\n     use. It is a great stimulant. The sober take it to invigorate the\r\n     stomach. The scrofulous hated it because they thought it stirred up\r\n     the bile on an empty stomach--but experience proving the contrary\r\n     enjoy it as much as others.\r\n\r\nIn 1702, coffee in the American colonies was being used as a refreshment\r\nbetween meals, \"like spirituous liquors.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in 1711 that the infusion idea in coffee making appeared in\r\nFrance. It came in the form of a fustian (cloth) bag which contained the\r\nground coffee in the coffee maker, and the boiling water was poured over\r\nit. This was a decided French novelty, but it made slow headway in\r\nEngland and America, where some people were still boiling the whole\r\nroasted beans and drinking the liquor.\r\n\r\nIn England, as early as 1722, there arose a conscientious objector to\r\nboiled coffee in the person of Humphrey Broadbent, a coffee merchant who\r\nwrote a treatise on _the True Way of Preparing and Making Coffee_[375],\r\nin which he condemned the \"silly\" practise of making coffee by \"boiling\r\nan ounce of the powder in a quart of water,\" then common in the London\r\ncoffee houses, and urging the infusion method. He favored the following\r\nprocedure:\r\n\r\n     Put the quantity of powder you intend, into your pot (which should\r\n     be either of stone, or silver, being much better than tin or\r\n     copper, which takes from it much of its flavour and goodness) then\r\n     pour boiling-hot water upon the aforesaid powder, and let it stand\r\n     to infuse five minutes before the fire. This is an excellent way,\r\n     and far exceeds the common one of boiling, but whether you prepare\r\n     it by boiling or this way, it will sometimes remain thick and\r\n     troubled, after it is made, except you pour in a spoonful or two of\r\n     cold water, which immediately precipitates the more heavy parts at\r\n     the bottom, and makes it clear enough for drinking.\r\n\r\n     Some, make coffee with spring water, but it is not so good as\r\n     river, or _Thames_-water, because the former makes it hard, and\r\n     distasteful, and the other makes it smooth and pleasant, lying soft\r\n     on the stomach. If you have a desire to make good coffee in your\r\n     families, I cannot conceive how you can put less than two ounces of\r\n     powder to a quart, or one ounce to a pint of water; some put two\r\n     ounces and a quarter.\r\n\r\nBy 1760, the decoction, or boiling, method in France had been generally\r\nreplaced by the infusion, or steeping, method.\r\n\r\nIn 1763, Donmartin, a tinsmith of St. Bendit, France, invented a coffee\r\npot, the inside of which was \"filled by a fine sack put in its\r\nentirety,\" and which had a tap to draw the coffee. Many inventions to\r\nmake coffee _sans ebullition_ (without boiling) appeared in France about\r\nthis time; but it was not until 1800 that De Belloy's pot, employing the\r\noriginal French drip method, appeared, signaling another step forward in\r\ncoffee making--percolation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_De Belloy and Count Rumford_\r\n\r\nDe Belloy's pot was probably made of iron or tin, afterward of\r\nporcelain; and it has served as a model for all the percolation devices\r\nthat followed it for the next hundred years. It does not seem to have\r\nbeen patented, and not much is known of the inventor. About this period,\r\nit was the common practise in England to boil coffee in the good\r\nold-fashioned way, and to \"fine\" (clarify) it with isinglass. This moved\r\nCount Rumford (Benjamin Thompson), an American-British scientist, then\r\nliving in Paris, to make a study of scientific coffee-making, and to\r\nproduce an improved drip device known as Rumford's percolator. He has\r\nbeen generally credited with the invention of the percolator; but, as\r\npointed out in a previous chapter, this honor seems to be De Belloy's\r\nand not Rumford's.\r\n\r\nCount Rumford embodied his observations and conclusions in a verbose\r\nessay entitled _Of the excellent qualities of coffee and the art of\r\nmaking it in the highest perfection_, published in London in 1812. In\r\nthis treatise he describes and illustrates the Rumford percolator.\r\n\r\nBrillat-Savarin, the famous French gastronomist, who also wrote on\r\ncoffee in his _VIme Meditation_, said of the De Belloy pot:\r\n\r\n     I have tried, in the course of time, all methods and of all those\r\n     which have been suggested to me up to today (1825) and with a full\r\n     knowledge of the matter in hand. I prefer the De Belloy method,\r\n     which consists of pouring the boiling water upon the coffee which\r\n     has been placed in the vessel of porcelain or silver, pierced with\r\n     very small holes. I have attempted to make coffee in a boiler at\r\n     high pressure, but I have had as a result a coffee full of extracts\r\n     and bitterness which would scrape the throat of a Cossack.\r\n\r\nBrillat-Savarin had something also to say on the subject of grinding\r\ncoffee, his conclusion being that it was \"better to pound the coffee\r\nthan to grind it.\"\r\n\r\nHe refers to M. Du Belloy, archbishop of Paris, \"who loved good things\r\nand was quite an epicure,\" and says that Napoleon showed him deference\r\nand respect. This may have been Jean Baptiste De Belloy, who, according\r\nto Didot, was born in 1709 and died in 1808, and, it is thought likely,\r\nwas the inventor of the De Belloy pot.\r\n\r\nCount Rumford was born in Woburn, Mass., in 1753. He was apprenticed to\r\na storekeeper in Salem in 1766. He became an object of distrust among\r\nthe friends of the cause of American freedom: and, on the evacuation of\r\nBoston by the Royal troops in 1776, he was selected by Governor\r\nWentworth of New Hampshire to carry dispatches to England. He left\r\nEngland in 1802, and resided in France from 1804 until his death in\r\n1814. In 1772, he had married, or rather, as he put it, he was married\r\nby, a wealthy widow, the daughter of a highly respectable minister and\r\none of the first settlers at Rumford, now called Concord, New Hampshire.\r\nIt was from this town that he took his title of Rumford when he was\r\ncreated a Count of the Holy Roman Empire in 1791. His first wife having\r\ndied, he married in Paris, the wealthy widow of the celebrated chemist,\r\nLavoisier; and with her he lived an extremely uncomfortable life until\r\nthey agreed to separate.\r\n\r\nIn his essay on coffee and coffee making, Count Rumford gives us a good\r\npen picture of the preparation of the beverage in England at the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century. He says:\r\n\r\n     Coffee is first roasted in an iron pan, or in a hollow cylinder,\r\n     made of sheet iron, over a brisk fire; and when, from the colour of\r\n     the grain, and the peculiar fragrance which it acquires in this\r\n     process, it is judged to be sufficiently roasted, it is taken from\r\n     the fire, and suffered to cool. When cold it is pounded in a\r\n     mortar; or ground in a hand-mill to a coarse powder, and preserved\r\n     for use.\r\n\r\n     Formerly, the ground Coffee being put into a coffee-pot, with a\r\n     sufficient quantity of water, the coffee-pot was put over the fire,\r\n     and after the water had been made to boil a certain time, the\r\n     coffee-pot was removed from the fire, and the grounds having had\r\n     time to settle, or having been fined down with isinglass, the clear\r\n     liquor was poured off, and immediately served up in cups.\r\n\r\nCount Rumford thought it a mistake to agitate the coffee powder in the\r\nbrewing process, and in this he agreed with De Belloy. His improvement\r\non the latter's pot is described in chapter XXXIV. He was a coffee\r\nconnoisseur; and as such was one of the first to advocate the use of\r\ncream as well as sugar for making an ideal cup of the beverage. He\r\nrefers, though not by name, to De Belloy's percolation method and says,\r\n\"Its usefulness is now universally acknowledged.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Few Definitions_\r\n\r\nJust here, in order to assure a better understanding of the subject, it\r\nmay be well to clear up sundry misconceptions regarding the words\r\npercolation, filtration, decoction, infusion, etc., by the simple\r\nexpedient of definition.\r\n\r\nA decoction is a liquid produced by boiling a substance until its\r\nsoluble properties are extracted. Thus the coffee drink was first a\r\ndecoction; and a decoction is what one gets today when coffee is boiled\r\nin the good old-fashioned way--as \"mother used to make it.\"\r\n\r\nInfusion is the process of steeping--extraction without boiling. It is\r\nextraction accomplished at any temperature below boiling, and is a\r\ngeneral classification of procedure capable of sub-division. As\r\ngenerally and correctly applied, it is the operation wherein hot water\r\nis merely poured upon ground coffee loose in a pot, or in a container\r\nresting on the bottom of the pot. In the strictest sense of the term, an\r\ninfusion is also produced by percolation and filtration, when the water\r\nis not boiled in contact with the coffee.\r\n\r\nPercolation means dripping through fine apertures in china or metal as\r\nin De Belloy's French drip pot.\r\n\r\nFiltration means dripping through a porous substance, usually cloth or\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nPercolation and filtration are practically synonymous, although a shade\r\nof distinction in their meaning has arisen so that often the latter is\r\nconsidered as a step logically succeeding the former. Accomplishing\r\nextraction of a material by permitting a liquid to pass slowly through\r\nit is in fact percolation, whereas filtration of the resultant extract\r\nis effected by interposing in its path some medium which will remove\r\nsolid or semi-solid material from it. Coffee-making practise has in\r\nitself so applied these terms that each is considered a complete\r\nprocess. Percolation is thus applied when the infusion is removed from\r\nthe grounds immediately by dripping through fine perforations in the\r\nchina or metal of which the device is constructed.\r\n\r\nTrue percolation is not produced in the pumping \"percolators\" in which\r\nthe heated water is elevated and sprayed over the ground coffee held in\r\na metal basket in the upper part of the pot, the liquor being\r\nrecirculated until a satisfactory degree of extraction has been reached.\r\nRather, the process is midway between decoction and infusion, for the\r\nweak liquor is boiled during the operation in order to furnish\r\nsufficient steam to cause the pumping action.\r\n\r\nFiltration is accomplished when the ground coffee is retained by cloth\r\nor paper, generally supported by some portion of the brewing device, and\r\nextraction effected by pouring water on the top of the mass, permitting\r\nthe liquid to percolate through, the filtering medium retaining the\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Patents and Devices_\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, the French devoted more attention than any other\r\npeople to coffee brewing. The first French patent on a coffee maker was\r\ngranted in 1802 to Denobe, Henrion, and Rauch for \"a\r\npharmacological-chemical coffee making device by infusion.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1802, Charles Wyatt obtained a patent in London on an apparatus for\r\ndistilling coffee.\r\n\r\nThe first French patent on an improved French drip pot for making coffee\r\n\"by filtration without boiling\" was granted to Hadrot in 1806. Strictly\r\nspeaking, this was not a filtering device, as it was fitted with a tin\r\ncomposition strainer, or grid. It was very like Count Rumford's\r\npercolator announced six years later, as will be seen by comparing the\r\ntwo in chapter XXXIV.\r\n\r\nIn 1815, Sené invented in France his _Cafetière Sené_, another device to\r\nmake coffee \"without boiling.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1817, the coffee biggin appeared in England. It was\r\nsimply a squat earthenware pot with an upper, movable, strainer part\r\nmade of tin, after the French drip pot pattern. Later models employed a\r\ncloth bag suspended from the rim of the pot. It was said to have been\r\ninvented by a Mr. Biggin; and Dr. Murray, of dictionary fame, seems to\r\nhave become convinced of this gentleman's existence, although others\r\nhave doubted it and thought the name was of Dutch origin, the article\r\nhaving been first made for Holland. It has been suggested that, in all\r\nprobability, the name came from the Dutch word _beggelin_, to trickle,\r\nor run down. One thing is certain, coffee biggins came originally from\r\nFrance; so that if there was a Mr. Biggin, he merely introduced them\r\ninto England. The coffee biggin with which Americans are most familiar\r\nis a pot containing a flannel bag or a cylindrical wire strainer to hold\r\nthe ground coffee through which the boiling water is poured. The Marion\r\nHarland pot was an improved metal coffee biggin. The Triumph coffee\r\nfilter was a cloth-bag device which made any coffee pot a biggin.\r\n\r\nIn 1819, Morize, a Paris tinsmith, invented a double drip, reversible\r\ncoffee pot. The device had two movable \"filters\" and was placed bottom\r\nup on the fire until the water boiled, when it was inverted to let the\r\ncoffee \"filter\" or drip through.\r\n\r\nIn 1819, Laurens was granted a French patent on the original\r\npumping-percolator device, in which the water was raised by steam\r\npressure and dripped over the ground coffee.\r\n\r\nIn 1820, Gaudet, another Paris tinsmith, invented a filtration device\r\nthat employed a cloth strainer.\r\n\r\nIn 1822, Louis Bernard Rabaut was granted an English patent on a\r\ncoffee-making device in which the usual French drip process was reversed\r\nby the use of steam pressure to force the boiling water upward through\r\nthe coffee mass. Caseneuve, of Paris, was granted a patent on a similar\r\ndevice in France in 1824.\r\n\r\nIn 1825, the first coffee-pot patent in the United States was granted to\r\nLewis Martelley on a machine \"to condense the steam and essential oils\r\nand return them to the infusion.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1827, the first really practicable pumping percolator, as we\r\nunderstand the meaning today, was invented by Jacques-Augustin Gandais,\r\na manufacturer of plated jewelry in Paris. The boiling water was raised\r\nthrough a tube in the handle and sprayed over the ground coffee\r\nsuspended in a filter basket, but could not be returned for a further\r\nspraying.\r\n\r\nIn 1827, Nicholas Felix Durant, a manufacturer of Chalons-sur-Marne, was\r\ngranted a French patent on a \"percolator\" employing, for the first time,\r\nan inner tube to raise the boiling water for spraying over the ground\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\nIn 1839, James Vardy and Moritz Platow were granted an English patent on\r\na kind of urn \"percolator\", or filter, employing the vacuum process of\r\ncoffee making, the upper vessel being made of glass.\r\n\r\nBy this time, the pumping percolator, working by steam pressure and by\r\npartial vacuum, was in general use in France, England, and Germany. And\r\nthen began the movement toward the next stage in coffee\r\nmaking--filtration.\r\n\r\nAbout this time (1840), Robert Napier (1791-1876) the Scottish marine\r\nengineer, of the celebrated Clyde shipbuilding firm of Robert Napier &\r\nSons, invented a vacuum coffee machine to make coffee by distillation\r\nand filtration. The device was never patented; but thirty years later,\r\nit was being made in the works of Thomas Smith & Son (Elkington & Co.,\r\nLtd., successors) under the direction of Mr. Napier, the aged inventor.\r\nThe device consists of a silver globe, brewer syphon, and strainer, as\r\nillustrated. It operates as follows: a half-cupful of water is put into\r\nthe globe, and the gas flame is lighted. The dry coffee is put into the\r\nreceiver, which is then filled up with boiling water. This will at once\r\nbecome agitated, and will continue so for a few minutes. When it becomes\r\nstill, the gas flame is turned down, and clear coffee is syphoned over\r\ninto the globe through the syphon tube, on the end of which, as it rests\r\nin the coffee liquid, there is a metal strainer covered with a filter\r\ncloth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NAPIER VACUUM COFFEE MAKER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NAPIER-LIST STEAM COFFEE MACHINE]\r\n\r\nThe Napierian coffee machine has enjoyed great popularity in England.\r\nThe principle has in later years been incorporated in the Napier-List\r\nsteam coffee machine for use in hotels, ships, restaurants, etc. Steam\r\nis used as a source of heat, but does not mix with the coffee. List's\r\npatent is for an improvement on the Napierian system and was granted in\r\n1891.\r\n\r\nIt is related that shortly before he died, old Mr. Napier, at the\r\ntermination of a dispute in Smith & Co.'s factory at Glasgow, where the\r\ndevice was being made under his instruction, said to old Mr. Smith:\r\n\r\n\"You may be a guid silversmith, but I am a better engineer.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FINLEY ACKER'S FILTER-PAPER COFFEE POT\r\n\r\nSHOWING METHOD OF OPERATION]\r\n\r\nIn 1841, William Ward Andrews was granted an English patent on an\r\nimproved pot employing a pump to force the boiling water through the\r\nground coffee while contained in a perforated cylinder screwed to the\r\nbottom of the pot.\r\n\r\nIn 1842, the first French patent on a glass coffee-making device was\r\ngranted to Madame Vassieux of Lyons.\r\n\r\nFollowing this, there were numerous patents issued in France and England\r\non double glass-globe coffee-making devices. They were first known as\r\ndouble glass balloons, and most of them employed metal strainers.\r\n\r\nAfter this, there were many \"percolator\" patents in France, England, and\r\nthe United States, some of which were for improved forms of the original\r\ndrip method of the De Belloy device. Others were for the type of machine\r\nwhich came to be known as \"percolators\" because they employed the\r\nprinciple of raising the heated water and spraying it over the ground\r\ncoffee in continuous fashion. The story is told in chronological order\r\nin the chapter on the evolution of coffee apparatus; so it is not\r\nnecessary to repeat it here. Numerous filtration devices also were\r\nproduced abroad and in the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE KIN-HEE POT IN OPERATION]\r\n\r\nAmong the percolators, those of Manning, Bowman & Co., and of Landers,\r\nFrary & Clark, became well known here. In the filtration field, the\r\nfollowing attained considerable distinction: Harvey Ricker's Half-Minute\r\npot, employing a cotton sack with re-inforced bottom, introduced about\r\n1881; the Kin-Hee pot of 1900; Cauchois' Private Estate coffee maker,\r\nusing Japanese filter paper, introduced in 1905; Finley Acker's\r\npercolator, introduced the same year, which also employed a filter paper\r\nbetween two cylinders having side perforations; the Tricolator, 1908;\r\nKing's percolator, using filter paper, in 1912; and the \"Make-Right\",\r\n1911, with its adaptation as presented in the Tru-Bru pot of 1920.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TRICOLATOR IN OPERATION]\r\n\r\nThe Make-Right was the invention of Edward Aborn, New York, and\r\ncomprised two telescoping open wire frames, or baskets, with a flat\r\npiece of muslin between them. In the Tru-Bru pot, the same idea was\r\nemployed, except that the wire frames were so constructed as to furnish\r\nfour drip points to afford better distribution on the ground coffee and\r\nto lessen the time of filtration. There was also a porcelain top, to\r\nhouse and to raise the filtration device, above the brew with an opening\r\nthrough which the boiling water could be poured without exposing the\r\nground coffee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING PERCOLATOR, AS APPLIED TO A HOTEL OR RESTAURANT URN]\r\n\r\nAmong later developments of the genuine percolator principle that have\r\nattracted attention in this country, mention should be made of the\r\nPhylax coffee maker, and the Galt pot.\r\n\r\nIn 1914-16, there was a revival of interest in the United States in the\r\ndouble glass-globe method of making coffee, introduced into France as\r\n\"double glass balloons\" in the first half of the nineteenth century.\r\nAmerican ingenuity produced several clever adaptations, and several\r\nnotable filter improvements. Advertising developed a great demand for\r\nglass percolators, as they were first called; but although five attained\r\nconsiderable prominence, only two survived and, at this writing, are\r\nstill being manufactured. Both are double glass-globe filters employing\r\na spirit lamp, gas, or electricity as heating agents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE TYPES OF AMERICAN COFFEE MAKERS IN OPERATION\r\n\r\nLeft, Blanke's Cloth Filter--Center, Phylax--Right, Galt Vacuum device]\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years, it has become the fashion to obtain patents\r\nin the United States on \"the art of brewing coffee\", or the \"art of\r\nmaking coffee\". Instances are the patents issued to Messrs. Calkin and\r\nMuller. In the Calkin patent (the Phylax device illustrated at the top\r\nof this page) the \"art\" consists in controlling the flow of the boiling\r\nwater by means of the number and spacing of the holes in the\r\nwater-spreader, so as to restrict the volume and the speed, to effect a\r\nquick initial extraction; and then, by means of a new spacing of holes\r\nin the infuser, retarding the drip \"to attain a prolonged extraction of\r\nthe tannin and other elements of slow extraction and combining the\r\nliquids obtained during the initial and subsequent stages of the brew\r\nfor attaining a balanced liquid extract.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE TRU-BRU POT OPERATES]\r\n\r\nMuller's \"art\" (the apparatus is described in chapter XXXIV) consisted\r\nin so supplying and supporting the ground coffee in an urn that it is\r\nnever again subjected to the \"decoction\" after having been exposed to\r\nthe air and steam following the first application of the water.\r\n\r\nIn 1920, William G. Goldsworthy, San Francisco, was granted a United\r\nStates patent on a process for preparing the beans for making the\r\nbeverage. The process consisted of grinding the raw dried beans; then\r\npacking the ground product in non-combustible and non-soluble porous\r\ncontainers, which are securely closed to keep them unimpaired while the\r\ncontained coffee is being roasted; and, after cooling, sealing them with\r\ngelatine. To brew, container and contents are dropped into a cup of hot\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE-MAKING DEVICES USED IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n1--Marlon Harland Pot; 2--Universal Percolator; 3--Galt Vacuum Process\r\nCoffee Maker; 4--Universal Electric Urn; 5--English Coffee Biggin\r\n(Langley Ware); 6--Universal Cafenoira (Glass Filter); 7--Vienna\r\n(Bohemian or Carlsbad) Coffee Machine; 8--Tru-Bru Pot; 9--Tricolator;\r\n10--Manning-Bowman Percolator; 11--Blanke's Sanitary Coffee Pot;\r\n12--Phylax Coffee Maker; 13--Private-Estate Coffee Maker; 14--American\r\nFrench Drip Pot; 15--Kin-Hee Pot; 16--Silex Opalescent Glass Filter;\r\n17--French Drip Pot (Langley Ware).]\r\n\r\nThis brief review of the evolution of coffee brews shows that coffee\r\nmaking started with boiling, and next became an infusion. After that,\r\nthe best practise became divided between simple percolation and\r\nfiltration, which have continued to the present time. Boiling has also\r\ncontinued to find advocates in every country, even in the United States,\r\nwhere it seems to die hard, no matter how much is done to discredit it.\r\nPercolation devices are subdivided into the simple drip pots and the\r\ncontinuous percolation machines, as represented by numerous complicated\r\nand high-priced contrivances on the market. Gradually, however, true\r\ncoffee lovers are realizing that the best results are to be obtained\r\nthrough simple percolation or simple filtration. There are good\r\narguments for both methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee Making in Europe in the Nineteenth Century_\r\n\r\nENGLAND. We have noted Count Rumford's efforts to reform coffee making\r\nin England in the early part of the nineteenth century. Many other\r\nscientific men joined the movement. Among them was Professor Donovan,\r\nwho in the _Dublin Philosophical Journal_ for May, 1826, told of his\r\nexperiments \"to ascertain the best methods for extracting all the\r\nvirtues inherent in the berry.\" The _Penny Magazine_ for June 14, 1834,\r\nafter deploring \"the straw-colored fluid commonly introduced under the\r\nmisnomer of coffee in England\", thus digests Professor Donovan's\r\nfindings:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Donovan found, that what we shall call the medicinal quality of\r\n     coffee resides in it independent of its aromatic flavor,--that it\r\n     is possible to obtain the exhilarating effect of the beverage\r\n     without gratifying the palate,--and, on the other hand, that all\r\n     the aromatic quality may be enjoyed without its producing any\r\n     effect upon the animal economy. His object was to combine the two.\r\n\r\n     The roasting of coffee is requisite for the production of both\r\n     these qualities; but, to secure them in their full degree, it is\r\n     necessary to conduct the process with some skill. The first thing\r\n     to be done is to expose the raw coffee to the heat of a gentle\r\n     fire, in an open vessel, stirring it continually until it assumes a\r\n     yellowish colour. It should then be roughly broken,--a thing very\r\n     easily done,--so that each berry is divided into about four or five\r\n     pieces, when it must be put into the roasting apparatus. This, as\r\n     most commonly used, is made of sheet-iron, and is of a cylindrical\r\n     shape: it no doubt answers the purpose well, and is by no means a\r\n     costly machine, but coffee may be very well roasted in a common\r\n     iron or earthenware pot, the main circumstances to be observed\r\n     being the degree to which the process is carried, and the\r\n     prevention of partial burning, by constant stirring. One of the\r\n     requisites for having good coffee is that it shall have been\r\n     recently roasted.\r\n\r\n     Coffee should be ground very fine for use, and only at the moment\r\n     when it is wanted, or the aromatic flavour will in some measure be\r\n     lost. To extract all its good qualities, the powder requires two\r\n     separate and somewhat opposite modes of treatment, but which do not\r\n     offer any difficulty when explained. On the one hand, the fine\r\n     flavour would be lost by boiling, while, on the other, it is\r\n     necessary to subject the coffee to that degree of heat in order to\r\n     extract its medicinal quality. The mode of proceeding, which, after\r\n     many experiments, Mr. Donovan found to be the most simple and\r\n     efficacious for attaining both these ends, was the following:--\r\n\r\n     The whole water to be used must be divided into two equal parts.\r\n     One half must be put first to the coffee \"cold\", and this must be\r\n     placed over the fire until it \"just comes to a boil\", when it must\r\n     be immediately removed. Allowing it then to subside for a few\r\n     moments the liquid must be poured off as clear as it will run. The\r\n     remaining half of the water, which during this time should have\r\n     been on the fire, must then be added \"at a boiling heat\" to the\r\n     grounds, and placed on the fire, where it must be kept \"boiling\"\r\n     for about three minutes. This will extract the medicinal virtue,\r\n     and if then the liquid be allowed again to subside, and the clear\r\n     fluid be added to the first portion, the preparation will be found\r\n     to combine all the good properties of the berry in as great\r\n     perfection as they can be obtained. If any fining ingredient is\r\n     used it should be mixed with the powder at the beginning of the\r\n     process.\r\n\r\n     Several kinds of apparatus, some of them very ingenious in their\r\n     construction, have been proposed for preparing coffee, but they are\r\n     all made upon the principle of extracting only the aromatic\r\n     flavour, while Professor Donovan's suggestions not only enable us\r\n     to accomplish that desirable object, but superadd the less obvious\r\n     but equally essential matter of extracting and making our own all\r\n     the medicinal virtues.\r\n\r\nWhen Webster and Parkes published their _Encyclopedia of Domestic\r\nEconomy_, London, 1844, they gave the following as \"the most usual\r\nmethod of making coffee in England\":\r\n\r\n     Put fresh ground coffee into a coffee-pot, with a sufficient\r\n     quantity of water, and set this on the fire till it boils for a\r\n     minute or two; then remove it from the fire, pour out a cupful,\r\n     which is to be returned into the coffee-pot to throw down the\r\n     grounds that may be floating; repeat this, and let the coffee-pot\r\n     stand near the fire, but not on too hot a place, until the grounds\r\n     have subsided to the bottom; in a few minutes the coffee will be\r\n     clear without any other preparation, and may be poured into cups;\r\n     in this manner, with good materials in sufficient quantity, and\r\n     proper care, excellent coffee may be made. The most valuable part\r\n     of the coffee is soon extracted, and it is certain that long\r\n     boiling dissipates the fine aroma and flavour. Some make it a rule\r\n     not to suffer the coffee to boil, but only to bring it just to the\r\n     boiling point; but it is said by Mr. Donovan that it requires\r\n     boiling for a little time to extract the whole of the bitter, in\r\n     which he conceives much of the exhilarating qualities of the coffee\r\n     reside.\r\n\r\nThis work had also the following to say on the clearing of coffee, which\r\nwas then a much-mooted question:\r\n\r\n     The clearing of coffee is a circumstance demanding particular\r\n     attention. After the heaviest parts of the grounds have settled,\r\n     there are still fine particles suspended for some time, and if the\r\n     coffee be poured off before these have subsided, the liquor is\r\n     deficient in that transparency which is one test of its perfection;\r\n     for coffee not well cleared has always an unpleasant bitter taste.\r\n     In general, the coffee becomes clear by simply remaining quiet for\r\n     a few minutes, as we have stated; but those who are anxious to have\r\n     it as clear as possible employ some artificial means of assisting\r\n     the clearing. The addition of a little isinglass, hartshorn\r\n     shavings, skins of eels or soles, white of eggs, egg shells, etc.,\r\n     has been recommended for clearing; but it is evident that these\r\n     substances, to produce their effect, which is upon the same\r\n     principle as the fining of beer or wine, should be dissolved\r\n     previously, for if put in without, it would require so much time to\r\n     dissolve, that the flavour of the coffee would vanish.\r\n\r\nCoffee-making devices of this period in England, in addition to the\r\nRumford type of percolator and the popular coffee biggin, included\r\nEvans' machine provided with a tin air-float to which was attached a\r\nfilter bag containing the coffee; Jones' apparatus, a pumping\r\npercolator; Parker's steam-fountain coffee maker, which forced the hot\r\nwater upward through the ground coffee; Platow's patent filter,\r\npreviously mentioned, a single vacuum glass percolator in combination\r\nwith an urn; Brain's vacuum or pneumatic filter employing a \"muslin,\r\nlinen or shamoy leather filter\" and an exhausting pump, designed for\r\nkitchen use; and Palmer's and Beart's pneumatic filtering machines of\r\nsimilar construction.\r\n\r\nCold infusions were common, the practise being to let them stand\r\novernight, to be filtered in the morning, and only heated, not boiled.\r\n\r\nCoffee grinding for these various types of coffee makers was performed\r\nby iron mills; the portable box mill being most favored for family use.\r\n\"It consisted of a square box either of mahogany or iron japanned,\r\ncontaining in the interior a hollow cone of steel with sharp grooves on\r\nthe inside; into this fits a conical piece of hardened iron or steel\r\nhaving spiral grooves cut upon its surface and capable of being turned\r\nround by a handle.\" There was a drawer to receive the finely ground\r\ncoffee. Larger wall-mills employed the same grinding mechanism.\r\n\r\nIn 1855, Dr. John Doran wrote in his \"Table Traits\":\r\n\r\n     With regard to the making of coffee, there is no doubt that the\r\n     Turkish method of pounding the coffee in a mortar is infinitely\r\n     superior to grinding it in a mill, as with us. But after either\r\n     method the process recommended by M. Soyer may be advantageously\r\n     adopted; namely, \"Put two ounces of ground coffee into a stew-pan,\r\n     which set upon the fire, stirring the coffee round with a spoon\r\n     until quite hot, then pour over a pint of boiling water; cover over\r\n     closely for five minutes, pass it through a cloth, warm again, and\r\n     serve.\"\r\n\r\nFrom observations by G.W. Poore, M.D., London, 1883, we are given a\r\nglimpse of coffee making in England in the latter part of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. He said:\r\n\r\n     Those who wish to enjoy really good coffee must have it fresh\r\n     roasted. On the Continent, in every well-regulated household, the\r\n     daily supply of coffee is roasted every morning. In England this is\r\n     rarely done.\r\n\r\n     If roasted coffee has to be kept, it must be kept in an air-tight\r\n     vessel. In France, coffee used to be kept in a wrapper of waxed\r\n     leather, which was always closely tied over the contained coffee.\r\n     In this way the coffee was kept from contact with any air.\r\n\r\n     The Viennese say that coffee should be kept in a glass bottle\r\n     closed with a bung, and that coffee should on no account be kept in\r\n     a tin canister.\r\n\r\n     The coffee having been roasted, it has to be reduced to a coarse\r\n     powder before the infusion is made. The grinding and powdering of\r\n     coffee should be done just before it is wanted, for if the whole\r\n     coffee seeds quickly lose their aroma, how much more quickly will\r\n     the aroma be dissipated from coffee which has been reduced to a\r\n     fine powder? Nothing need be said in the matter of coffee mills.\r\n     They are common enough, varied enough, and cheap enough to suit all\r\n     tastes.\r\n\r\n     To insure a really good cup of coffee attention must be given to\r\n     the following points:\r\n\r\n     1. Be sure that the coffee is good in quality, freshly roasted, and\r\n     fresh ground.\r\n\r\n     2. Use sufficient coffee. I have made some experiments on this\r\n     point, and I have come to the conclusions that one ounce of coffee\r\n     to a pint of water makes poor coffee, 1-1/2 ounces of coffee to a\r\n     pint of water makes fairly good coffee, two ounces of coffee to a\r\n     pint of water makes excellent coffee.\r\n\r\n     3. As to the form of coffee pot I have nothing to say. The\r\n     varieties of coffee machines are very numerous and many of them are\r\n     useless incumbrances. At the best, they can not be regarded as\r\n     absolutely necessary. The Brazilians insist that coffee pots should\r\n     on no account be made of metal, but that porcelain or earthenware\r\n     is alone permissible. I have been in the habit of late of having my\r\n     coffee made in a common jug provided with a strainer, and I believe\r\n     there is nothing better.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE-MAKING MACHINES POPULAR IN ENGLISH HOTELS AND\r\nRESTAURANTS]\r\n\r\n     4. Warm the jug, put the coffee into it, boil the water, and pour\r\n     the boiling water on the coffee, and the thing is done.\r\n\r\n     5. Coffee must not be boiled, or at most it must be allowed just to\r\n     \"come to a boil\", as cook says. If violent ebullition takes place,\r\n     the aroma of the coffee is dissipated, and the beverage is spoiled.\r\n\r\n     The most economical way of making coffee is to put the coffee into\r\n     a jug and pour cold water upon it. This should be done some hours\r\n     before the coffee is wanted--over night, for instance, if the\r\n     coffee be required for breakfast. The light particles of coffee\r\n     will imbibe the water and fall to the bottom of the jug in course\r\n     of time. When the coffee is to be used stand the jug in a saucepan\r\n     of water or a bainmarie and place the outer vessel over the fire\r\n     till the water contained in it boils. The coffee in this way is\r\n     gently brought to the boiling point without violent ebullition, and\r\n     we get the maximum extract without any loss of aroma.\r\n\r\n     Always make your coffee strong. _Café au lait_ is much better if\r\n     made with one-fourth strong coffee and three-fourths milk than if\r\n     made half-and-half with a weaker coffee; this is evident.\r\n\r\n     It is a mistake to suppose that coffee can not be made without a\r\n     great deal of costly and cumbersome apparatus.\r\n\r\nTHE CONTINENT. Rossignon has given us a general view of coffee making on\r\nthe continent of Europe in the middle of the nineteenth century. He\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     Formerly small bags of baize were used to percolate coffee. The\r\n     water was poured on the coffee, and when they were new the coffee\r\n     percolated through them was pretty good, but when they had been\r\n     used a few times they became greasy and it was very difficult to\r\n     clean them by any means. The greasy baize altered the quality of\r\n     the coffee, and in spite of all efforts to keep it clean the coffee\r\n     had a tarnished appearance very disagreeable to the view. Very few\r\n     persons use them at present. The apparatus most in use for the\r\n     percolation of coffee is a tin coffee-pot composed of two parts.\r\n     The upper one has a filter or sieve on which the coffee powder is\r\n     placed and through which the filtered coffee must pass. Boiling\r\n     water is poured on the coffee. The liquor which percolates falls in\r\n     the second part. Then the upper part is removed and the coffee is\r\n     ready as a beverage. There are very many systems of coffee pots.\r\n     One of the best is the Russian one, which consists of a receptacle\r\n     composed of two parts resembling two halves of an egg screwed\r\n     together. One part contains the hot water and the other the ground\r\n     coffee. In the center there is a filter. Turning the pot upside\r\n     down the percolation takes place very slowly and no aroma is lost.\r\n\r\n     The tin plate which is generally used to make the coffee pot has\r\n     many drawbacks. One of them is the dissolution of iron which takes\r\n     place after it has been used for a short time.\r\n\r\n     The quality of coffee, as a beverage, depends principally on the\r\n     degree of heat of the water. Experience has shown that a medium\r\n     class of coffee prepared at a moderate heat gives a very good\r\n     liquor, while excellent coffee on which boiling water has been\r\n     poured did not give a very good liquor. Therefore, instead of\r\n     pouring boiling water at 100°C. in a porcelain or silver\r\n     coffee-pot, those who desire to make a perfect coffee must use\r\n     water heated from 60° to 75°C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Duparquet Still's machine The Kellum\r\n\r\nTHREE WELL KNOWN MAKES OF LARGE COFFEE URNS]\r\n\r\nFRANCE. Also about the middle of the nineteenth century the French\r\nnaturalist, Du Tour, thus describes one manner of making coffee in\r\nFrance:\r\n\r\n     Let the powder be poured into the coffee-pot filled with boiling\r\n     water, in the proportion of two ounces and a half to two pounds, or\r\n     two English pints of water. Let the mixture be stirred with a\r\n     spoon, and the coffee-pot be soon taken off the fire, but suffered\r\n     to remain closely shut, for about at least two hours, on the warm\r\n     ashes of a wood fire. During the infusion the liquor should be\r\n     several times agitated by a chocolate frother, or something of the\r\n     same kind, and be finally left for about a quarter of an hour to\r\n     settle.\r\n\r\n_Café au lait_ was not made by boiling coffee and milk together, as milk\r\nwas not proper to extract the coffee; the coffee was first made as _café\r\nnoir_, only stronger; as much of this coffee was poured in the cup as\r\nwas required, and the cup was then filled up with _boiled_ milk. _Café a\r\nla crème_, was made by adding boiled cream to strong clear coffee and\r\nheating them together.\r\n\r\nIn France, during the latter part of the nineteenth century, coffee was\r\nroasted over charcoal fires in earthenware dishes or saucepans, stirred\r\nwith a spatula or wooden spoon, or in small cylinder or globular\r\nroasters of iron. Gas roasting was also practised. When roasted in large\r\nbatches, the beans were cooled in wicker baskets, tossed into the air.\r\nThe grinding was preferably done in mortars or in box mills of pyramid\r\nshape with receiving drawers, and was not too fine.\r\n\r\nThe usual method of making coffee in France among the better classes at\r\nthis time was by means of improved De Belloy drip devices, double glass\r\nvacuum filters, pumping percolators (double circulation devices), the\r\nRussian egg-shaped pots, and the Viennese machines. The last-named were\r\nmetal pumping percolators with glass tops, usually swung between the\r\nuprights of a carry arrangement, the base of which held a spirit lamp.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous French machines which became well known were:\r\nReparlier's glass \"filter\"; Egrot's steam cloth-filter machine and\r\nMalen's percolator apparatus, both designed for barracks and ships,\r\nwhere previously the coffee had been brewed in soup kettles; Bouillon\r\nMuller's steam percolator; Laurent's whistling coffee pot, a steam\r\npercolator which announced when the coffee was ready; Ed. Loysel's rapid\r\nfilter, a hydrostatic percolator; and those pots to which Morize,\r\nLemare, Grandin, Crepaux, and Gandais gave their names.\r\n\r\nIn 1892, the French minister of war directed that, in the army roasting\r\nand grinding operations, the coffee chaff should no longer be thrown\r\naway, as it had been found that it was rich in caffein and aroma\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POPULAR GERMAN DRIP POT]\r\n\r\nCoffee _à la minute_, which appeared in France in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, was made by decoction or infusion through a funnel pierced with\r\nholes and covered inside with blotting paper, or a woolen strainer\r\ncloth. This system, says Jardin, suggested the economical coffee pot.\r\n\r\nA popular German drip coffee maker of the late nineteenth century\r\nemploys a plug in the spout which provides air pressure to hold back the\r\ninfusion until the plug is removed.\r\n\r\nPierre Joseph Buc'hoz, physician to the king of Poland, in 1787, made a\r\nbusiness of supplying roasted coffee in small packets, each sufficient\r\nfor one cup. He built up quite a trade until one day he was caught\r\nsubstituting roasted rye for coffee. This was the Buc'hoz method of\r\nmaking coffee, much practised by the lower classes because he was looked\r\nupon as an authority:\r\n\r\n     Boil the water in a coffee pot. When it boils, draw it from the\r\n     fire long enough to add an ounce of coffee powder to a pound of\r\n     water. Stir with a spoon. Return it to the fire and when it boils\r\n     move it back somewhat from the heat and let it simmer for eight\r\n     minutes. Clarify with sugar or deer horn powder.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Early Coffee Making in the United States_\r\n\r\nThe coffee drink reached the colonies, first as a beverage for the\r\nwell-to-do, about 1668. When introduced to the general public through\r\nthe coffee houses about 1700, it was first sipped from small dishes as\r\nin England; and no one inquired too closely as to how it was made. When,\r\nhalf a century later, it had displaced beer and tea for breakfast, its\r\ncorrect making became a matter of polite inquiry. It was not until well\r\ninto the nineteenth century that there was any suggestion of scientific\r\ninterest, and not until within the last decade was any real chemical\r\nanalysis of brewed coffee undertaken with a view to producing a\r\nscientific cup of the beverage.\r\n\r\nAt first, owing to the great distances, and difficulties surrounding\r\ncommunications, between the colonies, news of improvements in coffee\r\nmakers and coffee making traveled slowly, and coffee customs brought\r\nfrom Europe by the early settlers became habits that were not easily\r\nchanged. Some of the worst have clung on, ignoring the march of\r\nimprovement, and seem as firmly entrenched in suburban and rural\r\ncommunities today as they were two hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nIndeed, despite the fact that the United States have been the largest\r\nconsumer of coffee among the nations for nearly half a century, it is\r\nonly within the last ten years that coffee properly prepared could be\r\nobtained outside the principal cities. Even today, the average consumer\r\nis sadly in need of education in correct coffee brewing. It would be an\r\nexcellent idea if all the coffee propaganda funds could be concentrated\r\non a study of this one phase of the coffee question for several years,\r\nand the recommendations published in such fashion as firmly to fix in\r\nthe minds of the rising generation a knowledge of correct coffee\r\nbrewing. The facts of the case are that, generally speaking, coffee is\r\nstill prepared in slovenly fashion in the average American home.\r\nHowever, with the good work done in recent years by organized trade\r\neffort to correct this abuse of our national beverage, signs are\r\nplentiful that the time is not far distant when a lasting reformation in\r\ncoffee making will have been accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn colonial times the coffee drink was mostly a decoction. Esther\r\nSingleton tells us that in New Amsterdam coffee was boiled in a copper\r\npot lined with tin and drunk as hot as possible With sugar or honey and\r\nspices. \"Sometimes a pint of fresh milk was brought to the boiling point\r\nand then as much drawn tincture of coffee was added, or the coffee was\r\nput in cold water with the milk and both were boiled together and drunk.\r\nRich people mixed cloves, cinnamon or sugar with ambergris in the\r\ncoffee.[376]\"\r\n\r\nGround cardamom seeds were also used to flavor the decoction.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of New England, the whole beans were frequently boiled\r\nfor hours with not wholly pleasing results in forming either food or\r\ndrink[377].\r\n\r\nIn New Orleans, the ground coffee was put into a tin or pewter coffee\r\ndripper, and the infusion was made by slowly pouring the boiling water\r\nover it after the French fashion. The coffee was not considered good\r\nunless it actually stained the cup. This method still obtains among the\r\nold Creole families.\r\n\r\nBoiling coarsely pounded coffee for fifteen minutes to half an hour was\r\ncommon practise in the colonies before 1800.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the nineteenth century, the best practise was to\r\nroast the coffee in an iron cylinder that stood before the hearth fire.\r\nIt was either turned by a handle or wound up like a jack to go by\r\nitself. The grinding was done in a lap or wall mill; and among the best\r\nknown makes were Kenrick's, Wilson's, Wolf's, John Luther's, George W.M.\r\nVandegrift's, and Charles Parker's Best Quality.\r\n\r\nTo make coffee \"without boiling\" the cookery books of the period advised\r\nthe housewife to obtain \"a biggin, the best of which is what in France\r\nis called a Grecque.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1844, the _Kitchen Directory and American Housewife's_ advice on the\r\nsubject of coffee making was the following:\r\n\r\n     Coffee should be put in an iron pot and dried near a moderate fire\r\n     for several hours before roasting (in pot over hot coals and\r\n     stirring constantly). It is sufficiently roasted when biting one of\r\n     the lightest colored kernels--if brittle the whole is done. A\r\n     coffee roaster is better than an open pot. Use a tablespoonful\r\n     ground to a pint of boiling water. Boil in tin pot twenty to\r\n     twenty-five minutes. If boiled longer it will not taste fresh and\r\n     lively. Let stand four or five minutes to settle, pour off grounds\r\n     into a coffee pot or urn. Put fish skin or isinglass size of a nine\r\n     pence in pot when put on to boil or else the white and shell of\r\n     half an egg to a couple of quarts of coffee. French coffee is made\r\n     in a German filter, the water is turned on boiling hot and\r\n     one-third more coffee is needed than when boiled in the common way.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 the _Ladies' Home Magazine_ (now the _Ladies' Home Journal_)\r\nprinted the following, which fairly sums up the coffee making customs of\r\nthat period:\r\n\r\n     Coffee, if you would have its best flavor, should be roasted at\r\n     home; but _not in an open pan_, for this permits a large amount of\r\n     aroma to escape. The roaster should be a closed sphere or\r\n     cylinder. The aroma, upon which the good taste of the coffee\r\n     depends, is only developed in the berry by the roasting process,\r\n     which also is necessary to diminish its toughness, and fit it for\r\n     grinding. While roasting, coffee loses from fifteen to twenty-five\r\n     percent of its weight, and gains from thirty to fifty percent in\r\n     bulk. More depends upon the proper roasting than upon the quality\r\n     of the coffee itself. One or two scorched or burned berries will\r\n     materially injure the flavor of several cupfuls. Even a slight\r\n     overheating diminishes the good taste.\r\n\r\n     The best mode of roasting, where it is done at home, is to dry the\r\n     coffee first, in an open vessel, until its color is slightly\r\n     changed. This allows the moisture to escape. Then cover it closely\r\n     and scorch it, keeping up a constant agitation, so that no portion\r\n     of a kernel may be unequally heated. Too low and too slow a heat\r\n     dries it up without producing the full aromatic flavor; while too\r\n     great heat dissipates the oily matter and leaves only bitter\r\n     charred kernels. It should be heated so as to acquire a uniform\r\n     deep cinnamon color, and an oily appearance, but never a deep, dark\r\n     brown color. It then should be taken from the fire and kept closely\r\n     covered until cold, and further until used. While unroasted coffee\r\n     improves by age, the roasted berries will very generally lose their\r\n     aroma if not covered very closely. The ground stuff kept on sale in\r\n     barrels, or boxes, or in papers, is not worthy the name of coffee.\r\n\r\n     Coffee should not be ground until just before using. If ground over\r\n     night, it should be covered: or, what is quite as well, put into\r\n     the boiler and covered with water. The water not only retains the\r\n     valuable oil and other aromatic elements, but also prepares it by\r\n     soaking for immediate boiling in the morning.\r\n\r\n     If the coffee pot (the \"_Old Dominion_\", of course, for in a common\r\n     boiler this process would ruin the coffee by wasting the aroma) be\r\n     set on the range or stove, or near the fire, so as to be kept hot\r\n     all night preparatory to boiling in the morning, the beverage will\r\n     be found in the morning, rich, mellow, and of a most delicious\r\n     flavor.\r\n\r\n     Coffee used at supper time should be placed on or near the fire\r\n     immediately after dinner and kept hot or simmering--not\r\n     boiling--all the afternoon.\r\n\r\n     Try this method if you wish coffee in perfection.\r\n\r\n     Wood's improved coffee roaster is acknowledged to be the best\r\n     article of the kind now in use.\r\n\r\n     This patent coffee roaster has been improved by the introduction of\r\n     a triangular flange inside of each of the hemispheres, as seen in\r\n     the cut. These flanges, as the roaster is turned, catch the coffee\r\n     and throw it from the inner surface, thus insuring a perfect\r\n     uniformity in the burning.\r\n\r\nThe Woods roaster (1849) and the Old Dominion Coffee Pot (1856) have\r\nbeen referred to in chapter XXXIV.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Encyclopedia of Practical Cookery_, we learn some more about\r\nthe customs prevailing \"among the first cooks in the country\" in\r\nroasting and making coffee in the United States about the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century. For example:\r\n\r\n\r\nROASTING COFFEE BEANS\r\n\r\n     Put the beans in the roaster, set this before a moderate fire, and\r\n     turn slowly until the Coffee takes a good brown colour; for this it\r\n     should require about twenty-five minutes. Open the cover to see\r\n     when it is done. If browned, transfer it to an earthen jar, cover\r\n     it tightly, and use when needed.\r\n\r\n     Or a more simple plan, and even more effectual, is to take a tin\r\n     baking-dish, butter well the bottom, put the Coffee in it, and set\r\n     it in a moderate oven until the beans take a strong golden colour,\r\n     twenty minutes sufficing for this. Toss them frequently with a\r\n     wooden spoon as they are cooking.\r\n\r\n     Another plan is to put in a small frying-pan 1 1b. of raw\r\n     Coffee-beans and set the pan on the fire, stirring and shaking\r\n     occasionally till the beans are yellow: then cover the frying-pan\r\n     and shake the Coffee about till it is a dark brown. Move the pan\r\n     off the fire, keep the cover on, and when the beans are a little\r\n     cool, break an egg over them and stir them until they are all well\r\n     coated with the egg. Then store the Coffee in tins or jars with\r\n     tight-fitting lids, and grind it as wanted for use.\r\n\r\n     Coffee should always be bought in the bean and ground as required,\r\n     otherwise it is liable to extensive adulteration with chicory (or\r\n     succory); some persons like the addition, but the epicure who is\r\n     really fond of Coffee would not admit of its introduction.\r\n\r\nMAKING BREAKFAST COFFEE.\r\n\r\n     Allow 1 tablespoonful of Coffee to each person. The Coffee when\r\n     ground should be measured, put into the Coffee-pot, and boiling\r\n     water poured over it in the proportion of 3/4 pint to each\r\n     tablespoonful of Coffee, and the pot put on the fire; the instant\r\n     it boils, take the pot off, uncover it, and let it stand a minute\r\n     or two; then cover it again, put it back on the fire, and let it\r\n     boil up again. Take it from the fire and let it stand for five\r\n     minutes to settle. It is then ready to pour out.\r\n\r\nThis work recommended as among the latest and best devices for coffee\r\nmaking, all those manufactured or sold in this country by Adams & Son;\r\nthe English coffee biggin; General Hutchinson's coffee pot and urn,\r\ncombining De Belloy's and Rumford's ideas; Le Brun's Cafetiére for\r\nmaking coffee by distillation and by steam pressure, passing it directly\r\ninto the cup; a Vienna coffee-making machine, and a Russian coffee\r\nreversible pot called the Potsdam.\r\n\r\nAmong two score of coffee recipes for making various kinds of extracts,\r\nices, candies, cakes, etc., flavored with coffee, there is a curious one\r\nfor coffee beer, the invention of Frenchman named Pluehart. \"The\r\ningredients and quantities in a thousand parts are--Strong coffee 300;\r\nrum 300; syrup thickened with gum senegal 65; alcoholic extract of\r\norange peel 10; and water 325.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does not appear to have reached any important degree of popularity\",\r\nadds the editor.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, Godey's _Lady's Book and Magazine_ noted with approval the\r\ngrowing custom of hotel and restaurant guests to order coffee instead of\r\nwines or spirits with their dinners. On the subject of \"How to make a\r\ncup of coffee\" it had this to say:\r\n\r\n     Which is the best way of making coffee? In this particular notions\r\n     differ. For example, the Turks do not trouble themselves to take\r\n     off the bitterness by sugar, nor do they seek to disguise the\r\n     flavor by milk, as is our custom. But they add to each dish a drop\r\n     of the essence of amber, or put a couple of cloves in it, during\r\n     the process of preparation. Such flavoring would not, we opine,\r\n     agree with western tastes. If a cup of the very best coffee,\r\n     prepared in the highest perfection and boiling hot, be placed on a\r\n     table in the middle of a room and suffered to cool, it will, in\r\n     cooling, fill the room with its fragrance: but becoming cold, it\r\n     will lose much of its flavor. Being again heated, its taste and\r\n     flavor will be still further impaired, and heated a third time, it\r\n     will be found vapid and nauseous. The aroma diffused through the\r\n     room proved that the coffee has been deprived of its most volatile\r\n     parts, and hence of its agreeableness and virtue. By pouring\r\n     boiling water on the coffee, and surrounding the containing vessel\r\n     with boiling water, the finer qualities of the coffee will be\r\n     preserved.\r\n\r\n     Boiling coffee in a coffee-pot is neither economical or judicious,\r\n     so much of the aroma being wasted by this method. Count Rumford (no\r\n     mean authority) states that one pound of good Mocha, when roasted\r\n     and ground, will make fifty-six cups of the very best coffee, but\r\n     it must be ground finely, or the surfaces of the particles only\r\n     will be acted upon by the hot water, and much of the essence will\r\n     be left in the grounds.\r\n\r\n     In the East, coffee is said to arouse, exhilarate, and keep awake,\r\n     allaying hunger, and giving to the weary renewed strength and\r\n     vigor, while it imparts a feeling of comfort and repose. The\r\n     Arabians, when they take their coffee off the fire, wrap the vessel\r\n     in a wet cloth, which fines the liquor instantly, and makes it\r\n     cream at the top. There is one great essential to be observed,\r\n     namely, that coffee should not be ground before it is required for\r\n     use, as in a powdered state its finer qualities evaporate.\r\n\r\n     We pass over the usual modes of making coffee, as being familiar to\r\n     every lady who presides over every household; and content ourselves\r\n     with the most modern and approved Parisian methods, though we may\r\n     add that a common recipe for good coffee is--two ounces of coffee\r\n     and one quart of water. Filter or boil ten minutes, and leave to\r\n     clear ten minutes.\r\n\r\n     The French make an extremely strong coffee. For breakfast, they\r\n     drink one-third of the infusion, and two-thirds of hot milk. The\r\n     _café noir_ used after dinner, is the very essence of the berry.\r\n     Only a small cup is taken, sweetened with white sugar or\r\n     sugar-candy, and sometimes a little _eau de vie_ is poured over the\r\n     sugar in a spoon held above the surface, and set on fire; or after\r\n     it, a very small glass of _liqueur_, called a _chasse-café_, is\r\n     immediately drunk. But the best method, prevalent in France, for\r\n     making coffee (and the infusion may be strong or otherwise as taste\r\n     may direct) is to take a large coffee-pot with an upper receptacle\r\n     made to fit close into it, the bottom of which is perforated with\r\n     small holes, containing in its interior two movable metal\r\n     strainers, over the second of which the powder is to be placed, and\r\n     immediately under the third. Upon this upper strainer pour boiling\r\n     water, and continue to do so gently; until it bubbles up through\r\n     the strainer: then shut the cover of the machine close down, place\r\n     it near the fire, and so soon as the water has drained through the\r\n     coffee, repeat the operation until the whole intended quantity be\r\n     passed. No finings are required. Thus all the fragrance of its\r\n     perfume will be retained with all the balsamic and stimulating\r\n     powers of its essence. This is a true Parisian mode, and _voila!_ a\r\n     cup of excellent coffee.\r\n\r\nThis article is most interesting in that it shows the revolt against\r\nboiling coffee had started in the United States; also that the\r\nimportance of fine grinding was being recognized and emphasized by the\r\nleaders of the best thought of the nation.\r\n\r\nProbably the first scientific inquiry into the subject of coffee\r\nroasting and brewing in the United States was that detailed by August T.\r\nDawson and Charles M. Wetherill, Ph.D., M.D., in the _Journal of the\r\nFranklin Institute_ for July and August, 1855. The following is a\r\ndigest:\r\n\r\n     There are two classes of beverages: 1, alcoholic, and 2,\r\n     nitrogenized. Nitrogenized foods are effective to replace the\r\n     substance of the different organs of the body wasted away by the\r\n     process of vitality. Coffee is one of these.\r\n\r\n     Besides the tannin, the coffee berry contains two substances, one\r\n     the nitrogenized quality, caffeine, which is about one percent and\r\n     is not altered in roasting, and the other a volatile oil which is\r\n     developed in roasting and which gives the coffee its flavor. Dr.\r\n     Julius Lehmann (Liebig's Annales LXXXVII. 205) says that coffee\r\n     retards the waste tissues of the body and diminishes the amount of\r\n     food necessary to preserve life. This effect is due to the oil.\r\n     Much of the nutritive portion of coffee is lost by European methods\r\n     of making.\r\n\r\n     Good coffee is very rare. These experiments were made to ascertain\r\n     whether a potable coffee could not be offered to the public at as\r\n     low a price as the raw or roasted now is. In order to be successful\r\n     we needed to extract a larger portion of the nutritive substance\r\n     than is extracted in the household. The experiments have proved\r\n     vain.\r\n\r\n     As a result of our experiments with different ways of roasting and\r\n     brewing coffee, we have found the following plan to be the most\r\n     convenient and the best: the coffee will taste the same every time\r\n     and it will taste good. If a good berry be properly roasted and the\r\n     infusion be of the proper strength, good coffee must result. A\r\n     Mocha berry should be selected and roasted seven or eight pounds at\r\n     a time in a cylindrical drum. After roasting it should be placed in\r\n     a stone jar with a mouth three inches in diameter. The jar should\r\n     be closed air-tight. This will furnish two cups of coffee daily for\r\n     six months. A quart should be taken from the jar at a time and\r\n     ground. The ground coffee should be kept in covered glass jars.\r\n\r\n     The best coffee pot was found to be the common biggin having an\r\n     upper compartment with a perforated bottom upon which to place the\r\n     coffee. To make one cup of this infusion, place half an ounce of\r\n     ground coffee in the upper compartment and six fluid ounces of\r\n     water into the bottom. Put the biggin over a gas lamp. After three\r\n     minutes the water will boil. When steam appears, take the biggin\r\n     from the fire and pour the water into a cup and thence immediately\r\n     into the top of the biggin where it will extract the berry by\r\n     replacement. (Here follows an experiment.)\r\n\r\n     This experiment shows that loss of weight is no criterion that\r\n     coffee is properly roasted, neither is the color (by itself) nor\r\n     the temperature, nor the time.\r\n\r\n     Next we experimented to ascertain whether the aroma developed by\r\n     roasting coffee and which is lost might not be collected and added\r\n     to the coffee at pleasure. An attempt was made to drive the\r\n     volatile oils from roasted coffee by steam and make a dried extract\r\n     of the residual coffee to which the oils were to be later added.\r\n     Two attempts were made and both failed. It appears that but a small\r\n     quantity of the aroma is lost in roasting and that is mixed with\r\n     bad smelling vapors from which it is impossible to free it.\r\n\r\n     Then we tried to make a potable coffee by making an aqueous extract\r\n     of raw coffee, evaporating to dryness and roasting the residue.\r\n     (Here follows the experiment.)\r\n\r\n     This also was unsuccessful. The great trouble here is a dark shiny\r\n     residue, which, while tasteless, is very disagreeable to look at.\r\n     In the preparation of coffee by boiling, two and a half times as\r\n     much matter is extracted as by biggin.\r\n\r\n     The proper method of roasting coffee is as follows: It should be\r\n     placed in a cylinder and turned constantly over a bright fire. When\r\n     white smoke begins to appear, the contents should be closely\r\n     watched. Keep testing the grains. As soon as a grain breaks easily\r\n     at a slight blow, at which time the color will be a light chestnut\r\n     brown, the coffee is done. Cool it by lifting some up and dropping\r\n     it back with a tin cup. If it be left to cool in a heap there is\r\n     great danger of over-roasting. Keep the coffee only in air-tight\r\n     vessels. _Measure_ the infusions, a half ounce of coffee to six\r\n     ounces of water per cup.\r\n\r\n     All \"extracts of coffee\" are worthless. Most of them are composed\r\n     of burned sugar, chicory, carrots, etc.\r\n\r\nIn 1883, an authority of that day, Francis B. Thurber, in his book,\r\n_Coffee; from Plantation to Cup_, which he dedicated to the railroad\r\nrestaurant man at Poughkeepsie, because he served an \"ideal cup of\r\ncoffee\", came out strongly for the good old boiling method with eggs,\r\nshells included. This was the Thurber recipe:\r\n\r\n     Grind moderately fine a large cup or small bowl of coffee; break\r\n     into it one egg with shell; mix well, adding enough cold water to\r\n     thoroughly wet the grounds; upon this pour one pint of boiling\r\n     water: let it boil slowly for ten to fifteen minutes, according to\r\n     the variety of coffee used and the fineness to which it is ground.\r\n     Let it stand three minutes to settle, then pour through a fine\r\n     wire-sieve into a warm coffee pot; this will make enough for four\r\n     persons. At table, first put the sugar into the cup, then fill\r\n     half-full of boiling milk, add your coffee, and you have a\r\n     delicious beverage that will be a revelation to many poor mortals\r\n     who have an indistinct remembrance of, and an intense longing for,\r\n     an ideal cup of coffee. If cream can be procured so much the\r\n     better, and in that case boiling water can be added either in the\r\n     pot or cup to make up for the space occupied by the milk as above;\r\n     or condensed milk will be found a good substitute for cream.\r\n\r\nIn 1886, however, Jabez Burns, who knew something about the practical\r\nmaking of the beverage as well as the roasting and grinding operations,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     Have boiling water handy. Take a clean dry pot and put in the\r\n     ground coffee. Place on fire to warm pot and coffee. Pour on\r\n     sufficient boiling water, not more than two-thirds full. As soon as\r\n     the water boils add a little cold water and remove from fire. To\r\n     extract the greatest virtue of coffee grind it fine and pour\r\n     scalding water over it.\r\n\r\nJohn Cotton Dana, of the Newark Public Library, says he remembers how in\r\nhis old home in Woodstock, Vt., they had always, in the attic, a big\r\nstone jar of green coffee. This was sacred to the great feast days,\r\nThanksgiving, Christmas, etc. Just before those anniversaries, the jar\r\nwas brought forward and the proper amount of coffee was taken out and\r\nroasted in a flat sheet-iron pan on the top of the stove, being stirred\r\nconstantly and watched with great care. \"As my memory seems to say that\r\nthis was not constantly done,\" says Mr. Dana, \"it would seem that, even\r\nthen, my father, who kept the general store in the village, bought\r\nroasted coffee in Boston or New York.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of the century, there were still many advocates of boiling\r\ncoffee; but although the coffee trade was not quite ready to declare its\r\nabsolute independence in this direction, there were many leaders who\r\nboldly proclaimed their freedom from the old prejudice. Arthur Gray, in\r\nhis _Over the Black Coffee_, as late as 1902, quoted \"the largest coffee\r\nimporting house in the United States\" as advocating the use of eggs and\r\negg-shells and boiling the mixture for ten minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Latest Developments in Better Coffee Making_\r\n\r\nBetter coffee making by co-operative trade effort got its initial\r\nstimulus at the 1912 convention of the National Coffee Roasters\r\nAssociation. As a result of discussions at that meeting and thereafter,\r\na Better Coffee Making Committee was created for investigation and\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nThe coffee trade's declaration of independence in the matter of boiled\r\ncoffee was made at the 1913 convention of the National Coffee Roasters\r\nAssociation, when, after hearing the report of the Better Coffee Making\r\nCommittee, presented by Edward Aborn of New York, it adopted a\r\nresolution saying that the recommendations met with its approval and\r\nordering that they be printed and circulated.\r\n\r\nThe work done by the committee included \"the first chemical analysis of\r\nbrewed coffee on record\", a study of grindings, and a comparison of the\r\nresults of four brewing methods. Its conclusions and recommendations\r\nwere embodied in a booklet published by the National Coffee Roasters\r\nAssociation, entitled _From Tree to Cup with Coffee_, and were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\nROASTING\r\n\r\n     The Roaster or \"Coffee Chef\" is the only cook necessary to a good\r\n     cup of coffee. He sends it to the consumer a completely cooked\r\n     product.\r\n\r\n     In the roasting process the berries swell up by the liberation of\r\n     gases within their substance. The aromatic oils contained in the\r\n     cells are sufficiently developed or \"cooked\", and made ready for\r\n     instantaneous solution with boiling water, when the cells are\r\n     thoroughly opened by grinding.\r\n\r\n     The roasting principles of different green coffees vary. Trained\r\n     study and a nice science in timing the roast and manipulating the\r\n     fire is necessary to a perfect development of aroma and flavor.\r\n\r\n     The drinking quality is largely dependent upon the experienced\r\n     knowledge of the coffee roaster and his scientific methods and\r\n     modern machinery, by which the coffee is not only roasted, but\r\n     cleaned, milled and completely manufactured to a high point of\r\n     perfection.\r\n\r\n     In their National Association work, the wholesale roasters are\r\n     giving the public new facts and valuable information, from\r\n     scientific researches, investigations, etc.\r\n\r\n     GRINDING. The roasted berry is constructed of fibrous tissues\r\n     formed into tiny cells visible only under the microscope, which are\r\n     the \"packages\" wherein are stored the whole value of coffee, the\r\n     aromatic oils. Like cutting open an orange, the grinding of coffee\r\n     is the opening of surrounding tissue and pulp, and the finer it is\r\n     cut the more easily are the \"juices\" released.\r\n\r\n     The fibrous tissue itself is waste material, yielding, by boiling\r\n     or too long percolations, a coffee colored liquid which is fibrous\r\n     and twangy in taste, has no aromatic character, and contains\r\n     undesirable elements.\r\n\r\n     The true strength and flavor of roasted coffee is ground out, not\r\n     boiled out. The finer coffee is ground, the more thoroughly are the\r\n     cells opened, the surfaces multiplied, and the aromatic oils made\r\n     ready for separation from their husks. Hence it follows that:\r\n\r\n     Coarse ground coffee is unopened coffee--coffee thrown away.\r\n\r\n     The finer the grind, the better and greater the yield. With\r\n     pulverized coffee (fine as corn meal) the fully released aromatic\r\n     oils are instantaneously soluble with boiling water.\r\n\r\n     In ground coffee the oils are standing in \"open packages,\" escaping\r\n     into the air and absorbing moisture, etc., necessitating quick use\r\n     or confinement in air proof and moisture proof protection.\r\n\r\n     BREWING. From scientific researches by the National Coffee\r\n     Roasters' Association, including the first chemical analysis on\r\n     record of brewed coffee, produced by various brewing methods, the\r\n     fundamental principles of coffee making have been clearly\r\n     established. These principles are simple, and when once understood\r\n     equip any person to intelligently judge the merits and defects of\r\n     the various coffee making devices on the market. They constitute\r\n     the law of coffee brewing, and may be stated as follows:\r\n\r\n     Correct brewing is not \"cooking.\" It is a process of extraction of\r\n     the already cooked aromatic oils from the surrounding fibrous\r\n     tissue, which has no drinkable value. Boiling or stewing cooks in\r\n     the fibre, which should be wholly discarded as dregs, and damages\r\n     the flavor and purity of the liquid. Boiling coffee and water\r\n     together is ruin and waste.\r\n\r\n     The aromatic oils, constituting the whole true flavor, are\r\n     extracted instantly by boiling water when the cells are thoroughly\r\n     opened by fine grinding. The undesirable elements, being less\r\n     quickly soluble, are left in the grounds in a quick contact of\r\n     water and coffee. The coarser the grind the less accessible are the\r\n     oils to the water, thus the inability to get out the strength from\r\n     coffee not finely enough ground.\r\n\r\n     Too long contact of water and coffee causes twang and bitterness,\r\n     and the finer the grind the less the contact should be. The\r\n     infusion, when brewed, is injured by being boiled or overheated. It\r\n     is also damaged by being chilled, which breaks the fusion of oils\r\n     and water. It should be served immediately, or kept hot, as in a\r\n     double boiler.\r\n\r\n     Tests show that water under the boiling point, 212°, is\r\n     inefficient for coffee brewing, and does not extract the aromatic\r\n     oils[378]. Used under this temperature, it is a sure cause of weak\r\n     and insipid flavor. The effort to make up this deficiency by longer\r\n     contact of coffee and water, or repeated pouring through, results\r\n     in no extraction of the oils, but draws out undesirable elements,\r\n     such as coffee-tannin, which is soluble in water at any temperature\r\n     and is governed by the time of contact.\r\n\r\n     Coffee-tannin, which is not the commercial tannic acid, is\r\n     eliminated to practically nothing in the quick brewing methods.\r\n\r\n     The chemical analysis of brewed coffee shows the following:\r\n\r\n                                     Coffee Tannin  Comparative\r\n                                         per Cup    Proportions\r\n\r\nPercolator method,[379] fine gran.          2.90 grains    --------\r\n   5 minutes' steeping\r\n\r\nBoiling Method, medium      \"           2.35    \"        ------\r\n\r\nSteeping Method,   \"        \"           2.31    \"         -----\r\n\r\nFiltration (or Drip) Method }           0.29    \"             -\r\n   Pulverized               }\r\n\r\n     Brewing is the final manufacturing process of coffee. All previous\r\n     perfection is dependent upon it. Like food products which lose\r\n     nutritive value by bad cooking, coffee loses its best values by\r\n     wrong brewing. Brewed by the very simple correct methods, it is an\r\n     unfailingly clear, fragrant, taste-charming beverage, universally\r\n     loved and scientifically approved.\r\n\r\nThe committee made a further report in 1914, and some of the findings\r\nwere subsequently published in an association booklet called _The Coffee\r\nBook_, used in connection with the second National Coffee Week campaign\r\nin 1915. In it were these:\r\n\r\nGRINDING DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n       _Powdered_             _Pulverized_\r\n       Like--flour.           Like--not coarser than\r\n                               fine corn meal.\r\n\r\n  _Very Fine and Fine_          _Medium_\r\nLike--from corn meal to    Like--coarse granulated\r\n fine granulated sugar.              sugar.\r\n\r\nAlso, the committee emphasized its previous findings, particularly this\r\none: \"Filter bags should be kept in cold water when not in use. Drying\r\ncauses decomposition. Keeps sweet if kept wet. Use muslin for filter bag\r\nand pulverized granulation.\"\r\n\r\nThe association brought out this same year, on recommendation of the\r\ncommittee, its Home coffee mill, an \"ideal and standard coffee mill for\r\nhome use.\" It was a wall mill equipped with a glass-front metal hopper\r\nand employing a ratchet spring-lock nut and double-action grinders. The\r\nmill was later improved with an all-glass hopper and a tumbler bracket.\r\nMore than 20,000 of these mills have been sold.\r\n\r\nAt the suggestion of the author, the efficiency of nine different\r\ncoffee-making devices (including boiling and drip pots, pumping\r\npercolators, cloth and paper filters) was investigated in the\r\nlaboratories of the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research of the\r\nUniversity of Pittsburgh in 1915; and Dr. Raymond F. Bacon submitted a\r\nreport that showed that the boiling method produced the highest\r\npercentage of caffetannic acid and caffein; the French drip process the\r\nlowest. The investigation disclosed also a more palatable brew at 195°\r\nto 200° F. than at the boiling point.\r\n\r\nAnother notable contribution to the science of coffee brewing was made\r\nby the Home Economics Laboratories of the University of Kansas in 1916.\r\nThe experiments extended over one year. They showed that strength and\r\ncolor in coffee brews are independent of blend and price and are most\r\nfully obtained by pulverized granulation, which was found to be the most\r\nefficient; that the consumer pays for flavor and that filtration yielded\r\nthe best brew. The French drip, or true percolator, did not figure in\r\nthese experiments.\r\n\r\nAt the 1915 convention of the National Coffee Roasters Association, Mr.\r\nAborn reported that 4,000 copies of the committee's findings on grinding\r\nand brewing had been given away: and the facts were further circulated\r\nin 2,000,000 booklets issued during two years. He told of tests which\r\nshowed that while there might be reasons of commercial expediency for\r\npacking ground coffee, it could not be defended as a quality principle;\r\nalso that plate-grinders produced a more efficient drawing granulation\r\nthan roller grinders, and that the idea that the steel-cut process\r\neliminates dirt was an absurdity, as \"the finest ground coffee is not\r\ndirt but coffee in its most efficient drawing condition.\" He added, \"I\r\nhave paid no attention to chaff removal in these tests as the\r\nuselessness of such removal has been repeatedly shown up.\" The reference\r\nhere was to his 1914 and 1913 reports, in which it was stated that\r\n\"removing the chaff in the steel-cut process does not remove any of the\r\ntannin, and for this purpose the steel-cut process is wholely futile,\r\nand a wasteful and unnecessary tax upon cost\", and that \"the removal of\r\nthe chaff appreciably affects the flavor and depreciates the cup value.\"\r\n\r\nThis report repeated previous findings against the pumping percolator as\r\nproducing an inefficient brew and being a very faulty utensil. Mr.\r\nAborn concluded his report by saying:\r\n\r\n     The old time boiling method has fewer and fewer defenders and holds\r\n     its own only as a superstition. I therefore pass it over as a\r\n     discarded issue.... It is but repetition of former reports for me\r\n     to say that pulverized granulation is the most efficient\r\n     granulation; that it assures the highest quality of brew and the\r\n     lowest proportion of coffee to a given strength; that it is the\r\n     most saving and most satisfying grinding for all to use; that it\r\n     (the coffee) must be fresh ground; that the filtration method is\r\n     the most correct in fundamental principles and that used with a\r\n     muslin bag it assures the consumer coffee of the purest, finest\r\n     flavored quality, highest health value and sure economy.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of education was continued during 1916, producing\r\nencouraging results among schools, colleges, the medical fraternity,\r\nnewspapers, with the trade and the consumer. It marked the first big\r\nconstructive work combining the practical and scientific phases of\r\ngrinding and brewing methods. In his report at the 1916 convention of\r\nthe National Coffee Roasters Association, Mr. Aborn reviewed the four\r\nyears work, and pointed out what had been accomplished. He told of a new\r\nbooklet, to be called the _True Book on Coffee Grinding and Brewing_,\r\nand an educational exhibit box for schools about to be issued. Due to\r\nopposition which developed from trade interests that were putting out\r\nsteel-cut and other grinds of coffee not favored by the committee, and\r\nalso because many members thought the association should not exploit any\r\nparticular method of grinding or brewing, it was decided to make no\r\nfurther publication of the coffee grinding and brewing conclusions of\r\nthe committee until they had been confirmed by laboratory research.\r\n\r\nBoiling and filtration tests in the mountains of the Yellowstone Park by\r\nW.H. Aborn in 1916 showed that the limit of coffee brewing was reached\r\nat an altitude of nine thousand feet.\r\n\r\nAt the 1916 meeting, Dr. Floyd W. Robison of the Detroit Testing\r\nLaboratories, read a notable paper entitled \"What do we know about\r\ncoffee?,\" which hailed coffee as a food product, warned the roasters to\r\nbeware of half-facts, and urged the importance of a research laboratory.\r\nIt was published and given distribution by the association.\r\n\r\nThe educational exhibit box showing samples of coffee from plantation to\r\ncup, including five different grinds, was issued in 1917, and sold for\r\none dollar.\r\n\r\nThe Better Coffee Making Committee also published in this year a booklet\r\nentitled _Coffee Grinding and Brewing_ in which it summarized its work\r\nto date, and presented its special plea for cotton-cloth filters as the\r\nideal coffee-making device.\r\n\r\nThis booklet aroused considerable discussion, particularly between those\r\nwho favored the paper filter and those who, with Mr. Aborn, believed\r\ncotton cloth, such as muslin, to be the most efficient strainer.\r\n\"Cotton\", argued Mr. Aborn, \"is an ideal sanitary strainer because it\r\ncontains no chemical or questionable manufacturing element.\"\r\n\r\nIt was pointed out by Dr. Floyd W. Robison that while cotton cloth, such\r\nas muslin, does give a fairly clear coffee, it is not so clear as by the\r\nmethods where a filter paper is used. He said:\r\n\r\n     Both methods have serious objectionable features. The muslin bag,\r\n     particularly, is decidedly unsanitary, especially when used in\r\n     restaurants and hotels. It is rarely kept clean, and one who has\r\n     frequented restaurants and many hotel kitchens knows that it lends\r\n     itself to very unclean and unsightly methods of handling. The food\r\n     inspector has to check this up perhaps as often as any one feature\r\n     about a restaurant.\r\n\r\n     The objection to the filter paper is not at all on the ground of\r\n     sanitation. It is ideal in this respect. The claim is made, and at\r\n     least, in part, substantiated, that it does hold back valuable\r\n     features of the brew.\r\n\r\n     There are many points about the filter that have not been\r\n     considered at all. Mr. Calkin believes that the very best type of\r\n     filter is a bed of coffee itself, and I must say this has the\r\n     sanction of good laboratory experience.\r\n\r\nI.D. Richheimer[380], attacking the cotton cloth filter, said:\r\n\r\n     It is a known fact that the fats in coffee are very dense and\r\n     represent twelve to fifteen percent of the coffee weight. These\r\n     fats--due to the simplest chemical action of contact with air,\r\n     moisture and continued heat--begin a fermentation in the completed\r\n     beverage. In the cloth-filtering process--due to the rapid passage\r\n     of water through grounds almost as quickly as poured--the largest\r\n     percentage of fats is carried into the beverage. Fat being lighter\r\n     than water rises to the top of water if given a certain amount of\r\n     time during the brewing process. Were there no fats (which ferment)\r\n     in coffee there would be no need for placing cloth-filtering\r\n     material under water, as suggested, to keep them from becoming\r\n     sour.\r\n\r\nIn the booklet referred to, Mr. Aborn expressed himself as follows on\r\nthe filtration method:\r\n\r\n     The filtration method is not new, but well tried, thoroughly proven\r\n     and long used, though often incorrectly. It is the method followed,\r\n     more or less correctly, by all of the first-class hotels in the\r\n     world. It is controlled by no patent or proprietary device, and\r\n     requires a most inexpensive equipment. For a perfect result it but\r\n     demands an accurate adherence to simple but vital principles.\r\n     Deviations from these fundamentals, though apparently slight, cause\r\n     failure. When they, and the necessary _exact_ following of them,\r\n     are clearly understood, any person, even a small child, can brew\r\n     coffee with unvarying success.\r\n\r\n     The first point to consider in filtration is the dimensions of the\r\n     filter bag, or container of the ground coffee, in relation to the\r\n     quantity of coffee used and the granulation of same. If the filter\r\n     be a muslin bag, free on all sides, the filtering surface is\r\n     considerable and permits the necessary quick passage of water\r\n     through the grounds, provided the bag is of a wide enough diameter\r\n     as to prevent too great a depth of grounds through which the water\r\n     cannot quickly penetrate. The error of too narrow a filter is a\r\n     common one. It causes a delayed filtration, which means undesirably\r\n     long contact of water and coffee and also the cooling of the liquid\r\n     which in a correct, undelayed filtration is smoking hot at\r\n     completion. The bag should also not be too long or be allowed to\r\n     hang or soak in the liquid. A filter bag set tightly into a pot\r\n     against its sides, thus surrounded with impenetrable walls, is\r\n     greatly reduced in filtering surface, and the filtration is thereby\r\n     slackened.\r\n\r\n     The filter material should not be too coarse in texture, like\r\n     cheese cloth, or too heavy and impenetrable, like very heavy\r\n     muslin. A moderate weight muslin, not too light, is efficient.\r\n\r\n     The degree of granulation also, of course, affects the rate of\r\n     flow. The coarser the grind the faster the flow, which permits a\r\n     larger quantity of coffee to a given diameter of filter bag.\r\n\r\n     A most frequent fault in the use of the filtration method is the\r\n     failure to understand the fine degree of grinding necessary to the\r\n     best results. When the grind is not sufficiently fine the\r\n     extraction is, of course, weak. A fine grind (like fine cornmeal)\r\n     is essential. It does not retard the flow if the filter is of right\r\n     dimensions. A powdered grind (like flour) is so fine that it is apt\r\n     to \"mat\" itself into a resisting floor.\r\n\r\n     Many users of the filtration method pour the liquid through more\r\n     than once. This gains some added color, but adds undesirable\r\n     element, depreciates flavor and is especially inadvisable when the\r\n     grind is sufficiently fine. _One pouring_ only is recommended for\r\n     the best results.\r\n\r\n     The chinaware, or glazed earthenware pot, sometimes called the\r\n     French drip pot, with a chinaware or earthenware sieve container\r\n     for the grounds at the top through which the water is poured, being\r\n     free of all metal, is inviting in purity and in hygienic merit.\r\n     Together with the filter bag, it is subject to the above remarks on\r\n     dimensions. A chinaware sieve cannot be made as fine as a metal\r\n     sieve and cannot of course hold very fine granulation as can cotton\r\n     cloth. More coffee for a given strength is, therefore, required.\r\n     The upper container should be wide enough, for a given quantity of\r\n     coffee, as to allow an unretarded flow, and the more openings the\r\n     strainer contains the better.\r\n\r\n     In any drip, filtration or percolating method the stirring of the\r\n     grounds causes an over-contact of water and coffee and results in\r\n     an overdrawn liquor of injured flavor. If the water does not pass\r\n     through the grounds readily, the fault is as above indicated and\r\n     cannot be corrected by stirring or agitation. Many complaints of\r\n     bitter taste are traced to this error in the use of the filtration\r\n     method.\r\n\r\n     It is not necessary to pour on the water in driblets. The water may\r\n     be poured slowly, but the grounds should be kept well covered. The\r\n     weight of the water helps the flow downward through the grounds.\r\n     Care should be taken to keep up the temperature of the water. Set\r\n     the kettle back on the stove when not pouring. If the water is\r\n     measured, use a small heated vessel, which fill and empty quickly\r\n     without allowing the water to cool.\r\n\r\nIn 1917, _The Tea and Coffee Trade Journal_ made a comparative\r\ncoffee-brewing test with a regulation coffee pot for boiling, a pumping\r\npercolator, a double glass filtration device, a cloth-filter device, and\r\na paper filter device. The cup tests were made by E.M. Frankel, Ph.D.;\r\nand William B. Harris, coffee expert, United States Department of\r\nAgriculture. The brews were judged for color, flavor (palatability,\r\nsmoothness), body (richness), and aroma. The test showed that the paper\r\nfiltration device produced the most superior brew. The cloth-filter,\r\nglass-filter, percolator, and boiling pot followed in the order named.\r\n\r\nAt the 1917 convention of the National Coffee Roasters Association, John\r\nE. King, of Detroit, announced that laboratory research which he had had\r\nconducted for him showed that the finer the grind, the greater the loss\r\nof aroma, and so he had selected a grind containing ninety percent of\r\nvery fine coffee and ten percent of a coarser nature, which seemed to\r\nretain the aroma. He subsequently secured a United States patent for\r\nthis grind. Mr. King announced also at this meeting that his\r\ninvestigations showed there was more than a strong likelihood that the\r\nmuch-discussed caffetannic acid did not exist in coffee--that it most\r\nprobably was a mixture of chlorogenic and and coffalic acids.\r\n\r\nThe World War operated to interfere with the coffee roasters' plans for\r\na research bureau; and in the meantime the Brazil planters, in 1919,\r\nstarted their million-dollar advertising campaign in the United States,\r\nco-operating with a joint committee representing the green and roasted\r\ncoffee interests. In the following year (June, 1920), this committee\r\narranged with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to start\r\nscientific research work on coffee, the literature of the roasters'\r\nBetter Coffee Making Committee being turned over to it; and the\r\nInstitute began to \"test the results of the committee's work by purely\r\nanalytical methods.\"\r\n\r\nThe first report on the research work at the Massachusetts Institute of\r\nTechnology was made by Professor S.C. Prescott to the Joint Coffee Trade\r\nPublicity Committee in April, 1921. The committee gave out a statement\r\nsaying that Prof. Prescott's report stated that \"caffein, the most\r\ncharacteristic principle of coffee, is, in the moderate quantities\r\nconsumed by the average coffee drinker, a safe stimulant without harmful\r\nafter-effects.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no publication of experimental results; but the announced\r\nfindings were, in the main, a confirmation of the results of previous\r\nworkers, particularly of Hollingworth, with whose statement, that\r\n\"caffein, when taken with food in moderate amount is not in the least\r\ndeleterious,\" the report was quoted as being in entire agreement.\r\n\r\nAt the annual convention of the National Coffee Roasters Association,\r\nNovember 2, 1921, Professor Prescott made a further report, in which he\r\nstated that investigations on coffee brewing had disclosed that coffee\r\nmade with water between 185° and 200° was to be preferred to coffee made\r\nwith the water at actual boiling temperature (212°), that the chemical\r\naction was far less vigorous, and that the resulting infusion retained\r\nall the fine flavors and was freer from certain bitter or astringent\r\nflavors than that made at the higher temperature. Professor Prescott\r\nannounced also that the best materials for coffee-making utensils were\r\nglass (including agate-ware, vitrified ware, porcelain, etc.), aluminum,\r\nnickel or silver plate, copper, and tin plate, in the order named[381].\r\n\r\nThe Joint Coffee Trade Publicity Committee's booklet on _Coffee and\r\nCoffee Making_, issued in 1921, was very guarded in its observations on\r\ngrinding and brewing. It avoided all controversial points, but it did go\r\nso far as to say on the general subject of brewing:\r\n\r\n     Chemists have analyzed the coffee bean and told us that the only\r\n     part of it which should go into our coffee cups for drinking is an\r\n     aromatic oil. This aromatic element is extracted most efficiently\r\n     only by fresh boiling water. The practice of soaking the grounds in\r\n     cold water, therefore, is to be condemned. It is a mistake also to\r\n     let the water and the grounds boil together after the real coffee\r\n     flavor is once extracted. This extraction takes place very quickly,\r\n     especially when the coffee is ground fine. The coarser the\r\n     granulation the longer it is necessary to let the grounds remain in\r\n     contact with the boiling water. Remember that flavor, the only\r\n     flavor worth having, is extracted by the _short_ contact of boiling\r\n     water and coffee grounds and that after this flavor is extracted,\r\n     the coffee grounds become valueless dregs.\r\n\r\nThe report contained also the following helpful generalities on coffee\r\nservice and the various methods of brewing in more or less common use in\r\nthe United States in 1921:\r\n\r\n     Although the above rules are absolutely fundamental to good Coffee\r\n     Making, their importance is so little appreciated that in some\r\n     households the lifeless grounds from the breakfast Coffee are left\r\n     in the pot and resteeped for the next meal, with the addition of a\r\n     small quantity of fresh coffee. Used coffee grounds are of no more\r\n     value in coffee making than ashes are in kindling a fire.\r\n\r\n     After the coffee is brewed the true coffee flavor, now extracted\r\n     from the bean, should be guarded carefully. When the brewed liquid\r\n     is left on the fire or overheated this flavor is cooked away and\r\n     the whole character of the beverage is changed. It is just as fatal\r\n     to let the brew grow cold. If possible, coffee should be served as\r\n     soon as it is made. If service is delayed, it should be kept hot\r\n     but not overheated. For this purpose careful cooks prefer a double\r\n     boiler over a slow flre. The cups should be warmed beforehand, and\r\n     the same is true of a serving pot, if one is used. Brewed coffee,\r\n     once injured by cooling, cannot be restored by reheating.\r\n\r\n     Unsatisfactory results in coffee brewing frequently can be traced\r\n     to a lack of care in keeping utensils clean. The fact that the\r\n     coffee pot is used only for coffee making is no excuse for setting\r\n     it away with a hasty rinse. Coffee making utensils should be\r\n     cleansed after each using with scrupulous care. If a percolator is\r\n     used pay special attention to the small tube through which the hot\r\n     water rises to spray over the grounds. This should be scrubbed with\r\n     the wire-handled brush that comes for the purpose.\r\n\r\n     In cleansing drip or filter bags use cool water. Hot water \"cooks\r\n     in\" the coffee stains. After the bag is rinsed keep it submerged in\r\n     cool water until time to use it again. Never let it dry. This\r\n     treatment protects the cloth from the germs in the air which cause\r\n     souring. New filter bags should be washed before using to remove\r\n     the starch or sizing.\r\n\r\n     DRIP (OR FILTER) COFFEE. The principle behind this method is the\r\n     quick contact of water at full boiling point with coffee ground as\r\n     fine as it is practical to use it. The filtering medium may be of\r\n     cloth or paper, or perforated chinaware or metal. The fineness of\r\n     the grind should be regulated by the nature of the filtering\r\n     medium, the grains being large enough not to slip through the\r\n     perforations.\r\n\r\n     The amount of ground coffee to use may vary from a heaping\r\n     teaspoonful to a rounded tablespoonful for each cup of coffee\r\n     desired, depending upon the granulation, the kind of apparatus used\r\n     and individual taste. A general rule is the finer the grind the\r\n     smaller the amount of dry coffee required.\r\n\r\n     The most satisfactory grind for a cloth drip bag has the\r\n     consistency of powdered sugar and shows a slight grit when rubbed\r\n     between thumb and finger. Unbleached muslin makes the best bag for\r\n     this granulation. For dripping coffee reduced to a powder, as fine\r\n     as flour or confectioner's sugar, use a bag of canton flannel with\r\n     the fuzzy side in. Powdered coffee, however, requires careful\r\n     manipulation and cannot be recommended for everyday household use.\r\n\r\n     Put the ground coffee in the bag or sieve. Bring fresh water to a\r\n     full boil and pour it through the coffee at a steady, gradual rate\r\n     of flow. If a cloth drip bag is used, with a very finely ground\r\n     coffee, one pouring should be enough. No special pot or device is\r\n     necessary. The liquid coffee may be dripped into any handy vessel\r\n     or directly into the cups. Dripping into the coffee cups, however,\r\n     is not to be recommended unless the dripper is moved from cup to\r\n     cup so that no one cup will get more than its share of the first\r\n     flow, which is the strongest and best.\r\n\r\n     The brew is complete when it drips from the grounds, and further\r\n     cooking or \"heating up\" injures the quality. Therefore, since it is\r\n     not necessary to put the brew over the fire, it is possible to make\r\n     use of the hygienic advantages of a glassware, porcelain or\r\n     earthenware serving pot.\r\n\r\n     BOILED (OR STEEPED) COFFEE. For boiling (or steeping) use a medium\r\n     grind. The recipe is a rounded tablespoonful for each cup of coffee\r\n     desired or--as some cooks prefer to remember it--a tablespoonful\r\n     for each cup and \"one for the pot.\" Put the dry coffee in the pot\r\n     and pour over it fresh water _briskly boiling_. Steep for five\r\n     minutes or longer, according to taste, over a low fire. Settle with\r\n     a dash of cold water or strain through muslin or cheesecloth and\r\n     serve at once.\r\n\r\n     PERCOLATED COFFEE. Use a rounded tablespoonful of medium fine\r\n     ground coffee to each cupful of water. The water may be poured into\r\n     the percolator cold or at the boiling point. In the latter case,\r\n     percolation begins at once. Let the water percolate over the\r\n     grounds for five or ten minutes depending upon the intensity of the\r\n     heat and the flavor desired.\r\n\r\nIn response to a request by the author, Charles W. Trigg has contributed\r\nthe following discussion of coffee making:\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIOUS ASPECTS OF SCIENTIFIC COFFEE BREWING\r\n\r\n     Before converting it into the beverage form, coffee must be\r\n     carefully selected and blended, and skillfully roasted, in order\r\n     thus far to assure obtaining a maximum efficiency of results. No\r\n     matter how accurately all this be done, improper brewing of the\r\n     roasted bean will nullify the previous efforts and spoil the drink;\r\n     for roasted coffee is a delicate material, very susceptible to\r\n     deterioration and of doubtful worth as the source of a beverage\r\n     unless properly handled.\r\n\r\n     There probably never was produced a drink which so fits into the\r\n     exacting desires of the human appetite as does coffee. Properly\r\n     prepared, it is a delightful beverage: but incorrectly made, it\r\n     becomes an imposition upon the palates of mankind. Sensitive though\r\n     coffee is to improper manipulation, the best procedure for brewing\r\n     it is also the easiest. Cheap coffee well made excels good coffee\r\n     poorly made.\r\n\r\n     CONSTITUENT CONCEPTS. The roasting of green coffee causes an\r\n     alteration in the constitution of its constituents, with the result\r\n     that some of the compounds present therein which were originally\r\n     water-soluble are rendered insoluble, and some which were insoluble\r\n     are converted into soluble ones. A portion of the original caffein\r\n     content is lost by sublimation. The aromatic conglomerate, caffeol,\r\n     is formed, and a considerable quantity of gas is produced, a\r\n     portion of which, developing pressure in the cells of the beans,\r\n     pops, or swells, them so as to increase the size of each individual\r\n     bean. The constituents which are water-soluble after the\r\n     torrefaction may be generally classified as heavy extractives and\r\n     light aromatic materials. The percentages and nature of these\r\n     materials in the roasted coffee will vary with the type of coffee\r\n     and with the roast which it is given. In general, and in particular\r\n     for purposes of comparison of methods of brewing, they may be\r\n     considered to be the same and to occur in about the same\r\n     proportions in all coffees.\r\n\r\n     The heavy extractives are caffein, mineral matter, proteins,\r\n     caramel and sugars, \"caffetannic acid\", and various organic\r\n     materials of uncertain composition. Some fat will also be found in\r\n     the average coffee brew, being present not by virtue of being water\r\n     soluble, but because it has been melted from the bean by the hot\r\n     water and carried along with the solution.\r\n\r\n     The caffein furnishes the stimulation for which coffee is generally\r\n     consumed. It has only a slightly bitter taste, and because of the\r\n     relatively small percentage in which it is present in a cup of\r\n     coffee, does not contribute to the cup value. The mineral matter,\r\n     together with certain decomposition and hydrolysis products of\r\n     crude fiber and chlorogenic acid, contribute toward the astringency\r\n     or bitterness of the cup. The proteins are present in such small\r\n     quantity that their only rôle is to raise somewhat the almost\r\n     negligible food value of a coffee infusion. The body, or what might\r\n     be called the licorice-like character of coffee, is due to the\r\n     presence of bodies of a glucosidic nature and to caramel.\r\n\r\n     As has been previously pointed out[382], the term \"caffetannic\r\n     acid\" is a misnomer; for the substances which are called by this\r\n     name are in all probability mainly coffalic and chlorogenic acids.\r\n     Neither is a true tannin, and they evince but few of the\r\n     characteristic reactions of tannic acid. Some neutral coffees will\r\n     show as high a \"caffetannic acid\" content as other acid-charactered\r\n     ones. Careful work by Warnier[383] showed the actual acidities of\r\n     some East Indian coffees to vary from 0.013 to 0.033 percent. These\r\n     figures may be taken as reliable examples of the true acid content\r\n     of coffee, and though they seem very low, it is not at all\r\n     incomprehensible that the acids which they indicate produce the\r\n     acidity in a cup of coffee. They probably are mainly volatile\r\n     organic acids together with other acidic-natured products of\r\n     roasting.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: SECTION OF ROASTED BEAN MAGNIFIED 1,000 TIMES]\r\n\r\n     We know that very small quantities of acid are readily detected in\r\n     fruit juices and beer, and that variation in their percentages is\r\n     quickly noticed, while the neutralization of this small amount of\r\n     acidity leaves an insipid drink. Hence it seems quite likely that\r\n     this small acid content gives to the coffee brew its essential\r\n     acidity. A few minor experiments on neutralization have proven the\r\n     production of a very insipid beverage by thus treating a coffee\r\n     infusion. So that the acidity of certain coffees most apparently\r\n     should be attributed to such compounds, rather than to the misnamed\r\n     \"caffetannic acid.\"\r\n\r\n     The light aromatic materials, and the other substances which are\r\n     steam-distillable, i.e. which are driven off when coffee is\r\n     concentrated by boiling, are the main determining factors in the\r\n     individuality of coffees. These compounds, which are collectively\r\n     called \"caffeol\", vary greatly in the percentages present in\r\n     different coffees, and thus are largely responsible for our ability\r\n     to distinguish coffees in the cup. It is these compounds which\r\n     supply the pleasingly aromatic and appetizing odor to coffee.\r\n\r\n     All of these compounds, with the possible exception of the\r\n     proteins, are easily soluble in both hot and cold water. The fact\r\n     that a clear coffee extract made with hot water does not show any\r\n     precipitate immediately upon cooling, proves that cold water will\r\n     give as complete an extraction as hot water. However, speed of\r\n     extraction is materially increased with rise in temperature, due to\r\n     the fact that the rate and degree of solubility of the substances\r\n     in water, and the diffusion of the water through the cell walls of\r\n     the coffee, are accelerated. Also, the resistance which the fat\r\n     content of the bean offers to the wetting of the coffee, and the\r\n     persistency of the \"enfleurage\" action of the fat in retaining the\r\n     caffeol, are less with hot than with cold water. Accordingly, the\r\n     speed of extraction is increased by using hot water, and the\r\n     efficiency of extraction procured per unit time of subjection to\r\n     water is higher.\r\n\r\n     Prolonged contact of coffee with water results in the hydrolysis of\r\n     some of the insoluble materials and subsequent extraction of the\r\n     substances thus formed. The rate of hydrolysis also increases with\r\n     temperature: and as these compounds are of an astringent or bitter\r\n     nature, the solution obtained upon boiling coffee is naturally\r\n     possessed of a flavor unpleasant to the palate of the connoisseur.\r\n     Boiling of the coffee infusion after it has been removed from the\r\n     grounds also has a deleterious effect, as the local overheating of\r\n     the solution at the point of application of the heat results in a\r\n     decomposition, particularly if the solution be converted into steam\r\n     at this point, leaving a thin film of solids temporarily exposed to\r\n     the destructive action of the heat. Some of the more delicate\r\n     constituents are unfavorably affected by such treatment, and\r\n     undergo hydrolysis and oxidation. The products thus formed are\r\n     thrown into relief in the flavor by the loss of the aromatic\r\n     properties through steam distillation which is incidental to\r\n     boiling.\r\n\r\n     It is a well known fact that re-warming a coffee brew has a\r\n     unfavorable effect upon it. This is probably due in part to a\r\n     precipitation of some of the water-soluble proteins upon standing,\r\n     and their subsequent decomposition when heat is applied directly to\r\n     them in reheating the solution. The absorption of air by the\r\n     solution upon cooling, with attendant oxidation, which is\r\n     accentuated by the application of heat in re-warming, must also be\r\n     considered, as well as the other effects of boiling as set forth,\r\n     and the action of the materials of which the coffee pot is\r\n     constructed upon the solution.\r\n\r\n     PHYSICAL CONCEPTION. The coffee bean is composed of a large number\r\n     of cells which function as natural containers and retainers of\r\n     coffee fat and of the aromatic flavoring substances. In order to\r\n     render the soluble solids fully accessible, the resistance which\r\n     these cells offer to the extracting water must be overcome by\r\n     grinding so as to break open all of them. In this manner a grind is\r\n     obtained which will give a maximum removal of the heavy\r\n     extractives. But when all of the cells are broken, great\r\n     opportunity is offered for the escape of the caffeol, which is\r\n     further enhanced by the slight heating which usually accompanies\r\n     such fine grinding. So much caffeol escapes that even our most\r\n     expert cup-testers would experience difficulty in identifying\r\n     powdered coffees in a blind test. What cup-testers, in fact, use\r\n     powdered coffees for making their cup selections?\r\n\r\n     Consider powdered coffee, compared with freshly ground coffee of a\r\n     coarser grind. Neither the former nor its brew possesses the amount\r\n     of characteristic flavor or aroma, attributable to caffeol,\r\n     evidenced by the latter. The explanation of this is that the finer\r\n     the grind, the more readily accessible are the soluble constituents\r\n     of the coffee to the extracting water. Caffeol, however, in\r\n     addition to being water-soluble, is extremely fugacious, so that\r\n     when the grinding is carried to such a fineness that every cell is\r\n     broken, the greater part of the caffeol volatilizes before the\r\n     water comes into contact with it. It is therefore highly desirable\r\n     that a grind be used wherein all of the cells are not broken, but a\r\n     grind that is sufficiently fine to permit efficient extraction. In\r\n     the light of this knowledge, the grind advocated by King[384] seems\r\n     to be logical, for with it--though neither a maximum of the\r\n     non-volatile extractives nor a maximum of caffeol is obtained--an\r\n     all-round maximum of cup quality is procured.\r\n\r\n     The escape, upon grinding, of these volatile aromatic and flavoring\r\n     constituents which lend individuality to coffees, makes it\r\n     essential that the roasted beans be ground immediately prior to\r\n     extraction.\r\n\r\n     DIFFERENT METHODS OF EXTRACTION. The methods employed for preparing\r\n     the coffee drink may be classified under the general headings of\r\n     boiling, steeping, percolation, and filtration. True percolation is\r\n     the simple process known by the trade as filtration; but in this\r\n     classification, the term indicates the style of extraction\r\n     exemplified by the pumping percolator.\r\n\r\n     Boiled coffee is usually cloudy, due to the suspension of fine\r\n     particles resulting from the disintegration of the grounds by the\r\n     violence of boiling. The usual procedure in clarifying the\r\n     decoction is to add the white of an egg or some egg-shells, the\r\n     albumen of which is coagulated upon the fine particles by the heat\r\n     of the solution, and the particles thus weighted sink to the\r\n     bottom. Even this procedure, requiring much attention, does not\r\n     give as clear a solution as some of the other extraction procedures\r\n     employed. The conditions to which coffee is subjected during\r\n     boiling are the worst possible, as both grounds and solution\r\n     undergo hydrolysis, oxidation, and local-overheating, while the\r\n     caffeol is steam-distilled from the brew. Many persons, who have\r\n     long been accustomed to drinking the relatively bitter beverage\r\n     thus produced, are not satisfied by coffee made in any other way;\r\n     but this is purely a perversion of taste, for none of the\r\n     properties are present which make coffee so prized by the epicure.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: CROSS-SECTION OF ROASTED COFFEE BEAN MAGNIFIED 600\r\n     TIMES]\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: COARSE GRIND UNDER THE MICROSCOPE]\r\n\r\n     Steeping, in which cold water is added to the coffee, and the\r\n     mixture brought up to a boil, does not subject the coffee to so\r\n     strenuous conditions. Local overheating and hydrolysis occur, but\r\n     not to so great an extent as in boiling; and most of the effects of\r\n     oxidation and volatization of caffeol are absent. However,\r\n     extraction is rather incomplete, due to lack of thorough admixture\r\n     of the water and coffee.\r\n\r\n     When coffee is to be made under the best conditions, the\r\n     temperature of the water used and of the extract after it is made\r\n     should not fluctuate. In the pumping percolator, as in the steeping\r\n     method, the temperature varies greatly from the time the extraction\r\n     is started to the completion of the operation. This is deleterious.\r\n     Also, local overheating of the infusion occurs at the point of\r\n     application of the heat; and because of the manner in which the\r\n     water is brought into contact with the coffee, the degree of\r\n     extraction shows inefficiency. Spraying of the water over the\r\n     coffee never permits the grounds to be completely covered with\r\n     water at any one time, and the opportunity offered for channeling\r\n     is excessive. The principle of thorough extraction demands that, as\r\n     the substance being extracted becomes progressively more exhausted,\r\n     fresh solvent should be brought into contact with it. In the\r\n     pumping percolator the solution pumped over the grounds becomes\r\n     more concentrated as the grounds become exhausted; so that the time\r\n     taken to reach the degree of extraction desired is longer, and an\r\n     appreciable amount of relatively concentrated liquor is retained by\r\n     the grounds.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: MEDIUM GRIND UNDER THE MICROSCOPE]\r\n\r\n     The simplest procedure to follow is that in which boiling water is\r\n     poured over ground coffee suspended on a filtering medium in such a\r\n     manner that the extracting water will slowly pass through the\r\n     coffee and be received in a containing vessel, which obviates\r\n     further contact of the beverage with the grounds. The water as it\r\n     comes into contact with the ground coffee extracts the soluble\r\n     material, and the solution is removed by gravity. Fresh water takes\r\n     its place; so that, if the filter medium be of the proper fineness,\r\n     the water flows through at the correct rate of speed, and complete\r\n     extraction is effected with the production of a clear solution.\r\n     Thus a maximum extraction of desirable materials is obtained in a\r\n     short time with a minimum of hydrolysis, oxidation, and loss of\r\n     caffeol; and if the infusion be consumed at once, or kept warm in a\r\n     contrivance embodying the double-boiler principle, the effects of\r\n     local overheating are avoided. Also, with the use of an appropriate\r\n     filter, a finer grind of coffee can be used than in the other\r\n     devices, without obtaining a turbid brew. All this works toward the\r\n     production of a desirable drink.\r\n\r\n     There are several devices on the market, some using paper, and some\r\n     cloth, as a filter, which operate on this principle and give very\r\n     good coffee. The use of paper presents the advantage of using a new\r\n     and clean filter for each brew, whereas the cloth must be carefully\r\n     kept immersed in water between brews to prevent its fouling.\r\n\r\n     Contrivances operating on the filtration principle have been\r\n     designed for use on a large scale in conjunction with coffee urns,\r\n     and have proven quite successful in causing all of the water to go\r\n     slowly through the coffee without channeling, thus accomplishing\r\n     practically complete extraction. The majority of urns are still\r\n     operated with bags, of which the ones with sides of heavier\r\n     material than the bottom obtain the most satisfactory results, as\r\n     the majority of the water must pass through the coffee instead of\r\n     out through the sides of the bag. Greatest efficiency, when bags\r\n     are used, is obtained by repouring until all of the liquid has\r\n     passed twice through the coffee; further repouring extracts too\r\n     much of the astringent hydrolysis products. The bags, when not in\r\n     use, should not be allowed to dry but should be kept in a jar of\r\n     cold water. The urns provided with water jackets keep the brew at\r\n     almost a constant temperature and avoid the deterioration incident\r\n     to temperature fluctuation.\r\n\r\n     COMPOSITION OF BREWS. The real tests of the comparative values of\r\n     different methods of brewing are the flavor and palatibility of the\r\n     drink, in conjunction with the number of cups of a given strength\r\n     which are produced, or the relative strengths of brews of the same\r\n     number of cups volume. Chemical analysis has not yet been developed\r\n     to a stage where the results obtained with it are valuably\r\n     indicative. Caffeol is present in quantities so small that no\r\n     comparative results can be obtained. \"Caffetannic acid\"\r\n     determinations are practically meaningless. This compound is of so\r\n     doubtful a composition and physiological action, and the methods\r\n     employed for its determination are so indefinite as to\r\n     interpretation, as to render valueless any attempts at comparison\r\n     of relative percentages. The only accurate analysis which can be\r\n     made is that for caffein.\r\n\r\n     Much advertising emphasis has been placed on the small amount of\r\n     caffein extracted by some devices. What is one of the main reasons\r\n     for the consumption of coffee? The caffein contained therein, of\r\n     course. So that if one device extracts less caffein than another,\r\n     that fact alone is nothing in favor of the former. If the consumer\r\n     does not want caffein in his drink there are caffein-free coffees\r\n     on the market.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: FINE-MEAL GRIND UNDER THE MICROSCOPE]\r\n\r\n     The coffee liquor acts on metals in such a manner as to lower the\r\n     quality of the drink, so that metals of any sort, and by all\r\n     means, irons, should be avoided as far as possible. Instead,\r\n     earthenware or glass, preferably a good grade of the former, should\r\n     be employed as far as possible in the construction of coffee-making\r\n     devices.\r\n\r\n     Of the various metals, silver, aluminum, monel metal, and tin (in\r\n     the order named) are least attacked by coffee infusions; and\r\n     besides these, nickel, copper, and well enameled iron (absolutely\r\n     free from pin holes) may be used without much danger of\r\n     contamination. Rings for coffee-urn bags should be made of tinned\r\n     copper, monel metal, or aluminum. Even if coffee be made in metal\r\n     contrivances, the receptacles in which it stands should be made of\r\n     earthenware or of glass.\r\n\r\n     Painstaking care should be given to the preservation of the\r\n     coffee-makers in a state of cleanliness, as upon this depends the\r\n     value of the brew. Dirt, fine grounds, and fat (which will turn\r\n     rancid quickly) should not be allowed to collect on the sides,\r\n     bottom, or in angles of the device difficult of access. Nor should\r\n     any source of metallic or exterior contamination be allowed to go\r\n     uneliminated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Perfect Cup of Coffee_\r\n\r\nLovers of coffee in the United States are in a better position to obtain\r\nan ideal cup of the beverage than those in any other country. While\r\nimports of green coffee are not so carefully guarded as tea imports,\r\nthere is a large measure of government inspection designed to protect\r\nthe consumer against impurities, and the Department of Agriculture is\r\nzealous in applying the pure food laws to insure against misbranding and\r\nsubstitution. The department has defined coffee as \"a beverage resulting\r\nfrom a water infusion of roasted coffee and nothing else.\"\r\n\r\nToday no reputable merchant would think of selling even loose coffee for\r\nother than what it is. And the consumer can feel that, in the case of\r\npackage coffee, the label tells the truth about the contents.\r\n\r\nWith a hundred different kinds of coffee coming to this market from\r\nnineteen countries, so many combinations are possible, that there is\r\nsure to be a straight coffee or a blend to suit any taste. And those who\r\nmay have been frightened into the belief that coffee is not for them\r\nshould do a little experimenting before exposing themselves to the\r\ndangers of the coffee-substitute habit.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time it was thought that Java and Mocha were the only\r\nworthwhile blend, but now we know that a Bogota coffee from Colombia,\r\nand a Bourbon Santos from Brazil, make a most satisfying drink. And if\r\nthe individual seeker should happen to be a caffein-sensitive, there are\r\ncoffees so low in caffein content, like some Porto Ricans, as to\r\novercome this objection; while there are other coffees from which the\r\ncaffein has been removed by a special treatment. There is no reason why\r\nany person who is fond of coffee should forego its use. Paraphrasing\r\nMakaroff, Be modest, be kind, eat less, and think more, live to serve,\r\nwork and play and laugh and love--it is enough! Do this and you may\r\ndrink coffee without danger to your immortal soul.\r\n\r\nIf you are accustomed to buying loose coffee, have your dealer do a\r\nlittle experimental blending for you until you find a coffee to suit\r\nyour palate. Some expert blends are to be found among the leading\r\npackage brands. But you really can not do better than to trust your case\r\nto a first-class grocer of known reputation. He will guide you right if\r\nhe knows his business; and if he doesn't, then he doesn't know his\r\nbusiness--try elsewhere. Test him out along this line:\r\n\r\nLet us reason together, Mr. Grocer. Let us consider these facts about\r\ncoffee: green coffee improves with age? Granted. As soon as it is\r\nroasted, it begins to lose in flavor and aroma? Certainly. Grinding\r\nhastens the deterioration? Of course. Therefore, it is better to buy a\r\nsmall quantity of freshly roasted coffee in the bean and grind it at the\r\ntime of purchase or at home just before using? Absolutely!\r\n\r\nIf your grocer reacts in this fashion, he need only supply you with a\r\nquality coffee at fair price and you need only to make it properly to\r\nobtain the utmost of coffee satisfaction.\r\n\r\nSome connoisseurs still cling to the good old two-thirds Java and\r\none-third Mocha blend, but the author has for years found great pleasure\r\nin a blend composed of half Medellin Bogota, one-quarter Mandheling\r\n\"Java\", and one-quarter Mocha. However, this blend might not appeal to\r\nanother's taste, and the component parts are not always easy to get. The\r\nretail cost (1922) is about fifty cents.\r\n\r\nAnother pleasing blend is composed of Bogota, washed Maracaibo, and\r\nSantos, equal parts. This should retail from thirty to thirty-five\r\ncents. Good drinking coffees are to be had for prices ranging from\r\ntwenty-five to thirty cents. In the stores of one of the large chain\r\nsystems an excellent blend composed of sixty percent Bourbon Santos,\r\nand forty percent Bogota is to be had (1922) for 29 cents. All these\r\nfigures apply, of course, to normal times.\r\n\r\nIf you are epicurean, you will want to read up on, and to try, the fancy\r\nMexicans, Cobáns, Sumatra growths, Meridas, and some from the \"Kona\r\nside\" of Hawaii.\r\n\r\nIn preparing the perfect cup of coffee, then, the coffee must be of good\r\ngrade, and freshly roasted. It should, if possible, be ground just\r\nbefore using. The author has found a fine grind, about the consistency\r\nof fine granulated sugar, the most satisfactory. For general home use, a\r\ndevice that employs filter paper or filter cloth is best; for the\r\nepicure an improved porcelain French percolator (drip pot) or an\r\nimproved cloth filter will yield the utmost of coffee's delights. Drink\r\nit black, sweetened or unsweetened, with or without cream or hot milk,\r\nas your fancy dictates.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that to make good coffee no special pot or\r\ndevice is necessary. Good coffee can be made with any china vessel and a\r\npiece of muslin. But to make it in perfection pains must be taken with\r\nevery step in the process from roaster to cup.\r\n\r\nHollingworth[385] points out that through taste alone it is impossible\r\nto distinguish between quinine and coffee, or between apple and onion.\r\nThere is something more to coffee than its caffein stimulus, its action\r\non the taste-buds of the tongue and mouth. The sense of smell and the\r\nsense of sight play important rôles. To get all the joy there is in a\r\ncup of coffee, it must look good and smell good, before one can\r\npronounce its taste good. It must woo us through the nostrils with the\r\nwonderful aroma that constitutes much of the lure of coffee.\r\n\r\nAnd that is why, in the preparation of the beverage, the greatest\r\npossible care should be observed to preserve the aroma until the moment\r\nof its psychological release. This can only be done by having it appear\r\nat the same instant that the delicate flavor is extracted--roasting and\r\ngrinding the bean much in advance of the actual making of the beverage\r\nwill defeat this object. Boiling the extraction will perfume the house;\r\nbut the lost fragrance will never return to the dead liquid called\r\ncoffee, when served from the pot whence it was permitted to escape.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, with an added word on service, the correct way to make\r\ncoffee is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Buy a good grade of freshly roasted coffee from a responsible dealer.\r\n\r\n2. Grind it very fine, and at home, just before using.\r\n\r\n3. Allow a rounded tablespoonful for each beverage cup.\r\n\r\n4. Make it in a French drip pot or in some filtration device where\r\nfreshly boiling water is poured through the grind but once. A piece of\r\nmuslin and any china receptacle make an economical filter.\r\n\r\n5. Avoid pumping percolators, or any device for heating water and\r\nforcing it repeatedly through the grounds. Never boil coffee.\r\n\r\n6. Keep the beverage hot and serve it \"black\" with sugar and hot milk,\r\nor cream, or both.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some Coffee Recipes_\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Ida C. Bailey Allen prepared a booklet of recipes for the\r\nJoint Coffee Trade Publicity Committee, she introduced them with the\r\nfollowing remarks on the use of coffee as a flavoring agent:\r\n\r\n     Although coffee is our national beverage, comparatively few cooks\r\n     realize its possibilities as a flavoring agent. Coffee combines\r\n     deliciously with a great variety of food dishes and is especially\r\n     adapted to desserts, sauces and sweets. Thus used it appeals\r\n     particularly to men and to all who like a full-bodied pronounced\r\n     flavor.\r\n\r\n     For flavoring purposes coffee should be prepared just as carefully\r\n     as when it is intended for a beverage. The best results are\r\n     obtained by using freshly made coffee, but when, for reasons of\r\n     economy, it is desirable to utilize a surplus remaining from the\r\n     meal-time brew, care should be taken not to let it stand on the\r\n     grounds and become bitter.\r\n\r\n     When introducing made coffee into a recipe calling for other\r\n     liquid, decrease this liquid in proportion to the amount of coffee\r\n     that has been added. When using it in a cake or in cookies, instead\r\n     of milk, a tablespoonful less to the cup should be allowed, as\r\n     coffee does not have the same thickening properties.\r\n\r\n     In some cases, better results are gained if the coffee is\r\n     introduced into the dish by scalding or cooking the right\r\n     proportion of ground coffee with the liquid which is to form the\r\n     base. By this means the full coffee flavor is obtained, yet the\r\n     richness of the finished product is not impaired by the\r\n     introduction of water, as would be the case were the infused coffee\r\n     used. This method is advisable especially for various desserts\r\n     which have milk as a foundation, as those of the custard variety\r\n     and certain types of Bavarian Creams, Ice Cream, and the like. The\r\n     right proportion of ground coffee, which is generally a\r\n     tablespoonful to the cup, should be combined with the cold milk or\r\n     cream in the double-boiler top and should then be scalded over hot\r\n     water, when the mixture should be put through a very fine strainer\r\n     or cheese cloth, to remove all grounds.\r\n\r\nCoffee can be used as a flavoring in almost any dessert or confection\r\nwhere a flavoring agent is employed.\r\n\r\nOn iced coffee and the use of coffee in summer beverages in general,\r\nMrs. Allen writes as follows:\r\n\r\n     ICED COFFEE. This is not only a delicious summer drink, but it also\r\n     furnishes a mild stimulation that is particularly grateful on a\r\n     wilting hot day. It may be combined with fruit juices and other\r\n     ingredients in a variety of cooling beverages which are less sugary\r\n     and cloying than the average warm weather drink and for that reason\r\n     it is generally popular with men.\r\n\r\n     Coffee that is to be served cold should be made somewhat stronger\r\n     than usual. Brew it according to your favorite method and chill\r\n     before adding sugar and cream. If cracked ice is added make sure\r\n     the coffee is strong enough to compensate for the resulting\r\n     dilution. Mixing the ingredients in a shaker produces a smoother\r\n     beverage topped with an appetizing foam.\r\n\r\n     It is a convenience, however, to have on hand a concentrated syrup\r\n     from which any kind of coffee-flavored drink may be concocted on\r\n     short notice and without the necessity of lighting the stove.\r\n     Coffee left over from meals may be used for the same purpose, but\r\n     it should be kept in a covered glass or china dish and not allowed\r\n     to stand too long. A coffee syrup made after the following recipe\r\n     will keep indefinitely and may be used as a basis for many\r\n     delicious iced drinks:\r\n\r\n     COFFEE SYRUP. Two quarts of very strong coffee; 3-1/2 pounds sugar.\r\n     The coffee should be very strong, as the syrup will be largely\r\n     diluted. The proportion of a pound of coffee to one and\r\n     three-fourths quarts of water will be found satisfactory. This may\r\n     be made by any favorite method, cleared and strained, then combined\r\n     with the sugar, brought to boiling point, and boiled for two or\r\n     three minutes. It should be canned while boiling, in sterilized\r\n     bottles. Fill them to overflowing and seal as for grape juice or\r\n     for any other canned beverage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA COFFEE CHRONOLOGY\r\n\r\n     _Giving dates and events of historical interest in legend, travel,\r\n     literature, cultivation, plantation treatment, trading, and in the\r\n     preparation and use of coffee from the earliest time to the\r\n     present_\r\n\r\n     900[L]--Rhazes, famous Arabian physician, is first writer to\r\n     mention coffee under the name _bunca_ or _bunchum_.[M]\r\n\r\n     1000[L]--Avicenna, Mahommedan physician and philosopher, is the\r\n     first writer to explain the medicinal properties of the coffee\r\n     bean, which he also calls _bunchum_.[M]\r\n\r\n     1258[L]--Sheik Omar, disciple of Sheik Schadheli, patron saint and\r\n     legendary founder of Mocha, by chance discovers coffee as a\r\n     beverage at Ousab in Arabia.[M]\r\n\r\n     1300[L]--The coffee drink is a decoction made from roasted berries,\r\n     crushed in a mortar and pestle, the powder being placed in boiling\r\n     water, and the drink taken down, grounds and all.\r\n\r\n     1350[L]--Persian, Egyptian, and Turkish ewers made of pottery are\r\n     first used for serving coffee.\r\n\r\n     1400-1500--Earthenware or metal coffee-roasting plates with small\r\n     holes, rounded and shaped like a skimmer, come into use in Turkey\r\n     and Persia over braziers.

Lilly thenceforth always saw the stars\r\nfavourable to the Puritans.\r\n\r\n[78] This man was originally a fishing-tackle maker in Tower Street\r\nduring the reign of Charles I; but turning enthusiast, he went about\r\nprognosticating \"the downfall of the King and Popery;\" and as he and his\r\npredictions were all on the popular side, he became a great man with the\r\nsuperstitious \"godly brethren\" of that day.\r\n\r\n[79] Turnball, or Turnbull-street, as it is still called, had been for a\r\ncentury previous of infamous repute.

This\r\nactually amounted to $20,000 per month up to January, 1921. During 1921,\r\nby reason of a short crop and the advance rate of exchange, the\r\nremittances were reduced almost half. In January, 1922, the São Paulo\r\nlegislature on petition of the _Sociedade_ increased the tax to 200 reis\r\nper bag to run for 3 years. In spite of this, the probability is that\r\nanother short crop and a continued low rate of exchange will keep the\r\nBrazil contribution in 1922 down to about $180,000 net. By November,\r\n1921, a total of $671,000 was expended on advertising. Of this, $551,000\r\nwas contributed by the planters of São Paulo, and $120,000 by the coffee\r\ntrade of the United States.\r\n\r\n[347] About this time, the country was flooded with paper money, worth\r\nabout 1 to 75, forcing the price of commodities to unheard-of heights,\r\nshoes for instance, being sold at £20 per pair.\r\n\r\n[348] Much of the information that follows is from an article by M.E.\r\nGoetzinger in the _Percolator_, February, 1921.\r\n\r\n[349] What follows on \"Trade Brooms and Panics\" is from an article\r\nprepared, under the author's direction, by C.K. Trafton, and published\r\nin _The Tea and Coffee Trade Journal_, Nov., 1920 (vol. xxxix: no. 5: p.\r\n563).\r\n\r\n[350] Kauhee (or _kahvé_) is the Turkish for coffee.\r\n\r\n[351] Copyright, 1913.
