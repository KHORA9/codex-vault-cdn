The first edition,\r\nwhich was published five months ago, is already exhausted and a second\r\nis now called for.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there has broken out and is now in progress a war which is\r\ngenerally regarded as the greatest of all time--a war already involving\r\nfive of the six Great Powers and three of the smaller nations of Europe\r\nas well as Japan and Turkey and likely at any time to embroil other\r\ncountries in Europe, Asia, and Africa, which are already embraced in\r\nthe area of military operations.\r\n\r\nThis War of Many Nations had its origin in the Balkan situation.  It\r\nbegan on July 28 with the declaration of the Dual Monarchy {vi} to the\r\neffect that from that moment Austria-Hungary was in a state of war with\r\nServia.  And the fundamental reason for this declaration as given in\r\nthe note or ultimatum to Servia was the charge that the Servian\r\nauthorities had encouraged the Pan-Serb agitation which seriously\r\nmenaced the integrity of Austria-Hungary and had already caused the\r\nassassination at Sarajevo of the Heir to the Throne.\r\n\r\nNo one could have observed at close range the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913\r\nwithout perceiving, always in the background and occasionally in the\r\nforeground, the colossal rival figures of Russia and Austria-Hungary.\r\nAttention was called to the phenomenon at various points in this volume\r\nand especially in the concluding pages.\r\n\r\nThe issue of the Balkan struggles of 1912-1913 was undoubtedly\r\nfavorable to Russia.  By her constant diplomatic support she retained\r\nthe friendship and earned the gratitude of Greece, Montenegro, and\r\nServia; and through her {vii} championship, belated though it was, of\r\nthe claims of Roumania to territorial compensation for benevolent\r\nneutrality during the war of the Allies against Turkey, she won the\r\nfriendship of the predominant Balkan power which had hitherto been\r\nregarded as the immovable eastern outpost of the Triple Alliance.  But\r\nwhile Russia was victorious she did not gain all that she had planned\r\nand hoped for.  Her very triumph at Bukarest was a proof that she had\r\nlost her influence over Bulgaria.  This Slav state after the war\r\nagainst Turkey came under the influence of Austria-Hungary, by whom she\r\nwas undoubtedly incited to strife with Servia and her other partners in\r\nthe late war against Turkey.  Russia was unable to prevent the second\r\nBalkan war between the Allies.  The Czar's summons to the Kings of\r\nBulgaria and Servia on June 9, 1913, to submit, in the name of\r\nPan-Slavism, their disputes to his decision failed to produce the\r\ndesired effect, while this assumption of Russian hegemony in Balkan\r\naffairs greatly {viii} exacerbated Austro-Hungarian sentiment.  That\r\naction of the Czar, however, was clear notification and proof to all\r\nthe world that Russia regarded the Slav States in the Balkans as\r\nobjects of her peculiar concern and protection.\r\n\r\nThe first Balkan War--the war of the Allies against Turkey--ended in a\r\nway that surprised all the world.  Everybody expected a victory for the\r\nTurks.  That the Turks should one day be driven out of Europe was the\r\nuniversal assumption, but it was the equally fixed belief that the\r\nagents of their expulsion would be the Great Powers or some of the\r\nGreat Powers.  That the little independent States of the Balkans should\r\nthemselves be equal to the task no one imagined,--no one with the\r\npossible exception of the government of Russia.  And as Russia rejoiced\r\nover the victory of the Balkan States and the defeat of her secular\r\nMohammedan neighbor, Austria-Hungary looked on not only with amazement\r\nbut with disappointment and chagrin.\r\n\r\n{ix}\r\n\r\nFor the contemporaneous diplomacy of the Austro-Hungarian government\r\nwas based on the assumption that the Balkan States would be vanquished\r\nby Turkey.  And its standing policy had been on the one hand to keep\r\nthe Kingdom of Servia small and weak (for the Dual Monarchy was itself\r\nan important Serb state) and on the other hand to broaden her Adriatic\r\npossessions and also to make her way through Novi Bazar and Macedonia\r\nto Saloniki and the Aegean, when the time came to secure this\r\nconcession from the Sultan without provoking a European war.  It seemed\r\nin 1908 as though the favorable moment had arrived to make a first\r\nmove, and the Austro-Hungarian government put forward a project for\r\nconnecting the Bosnian and Macedonian railway systems.  But the only\r\nresult was to bring to an end the co-operation which had for some years\r\nbeen maintained between the Austrian and Russian governments in the\r\nenforcement upon the Porte of the adoption of reforms in Macedonia.\r\n{x} And now the result of the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913 was the\r\npractical expulsion of Turkey from Europe and the territorial\r\naggrandizement of Servia and the sister state of Montenegro through the\r\nannexation of those very Turkish domains which lay between the\r\nAustro-Hungarian frontier and the Aegean.  At every point\r\nAustro-Hungarian policies had met with reverses.\r\n\r\nOnly one success could possibly be attributed to the diplomacy of the\r\nBallplatz.  The exclusion of Servia from the Adriatic Sea and the\r\nestablishment of the independent State of Albania was the achievement\r\nof Count Berchtold, the Austro-Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs.\r\nThe new State has been a powder magazine from the beginning, and since\r\nthe withdrawal of Prince William of Wied, the government, always\r\npowerless, has fallen into chaos.  Intervention on the part of\r\nneighboring states is inevitable.  And only last month the southern\r\npart of Albania--that is, Northern {xi} Epirus--was occupied by a Greek\r\narmy for the purpose of ending the sanguinary anarchy which has\r\nhitherto prevailed.  This action will be no surprise to the readers of\r\nthis volume.  The occupation, or rather re-occupation, is declared by\r\nthe Greek Government to be provisional and it is apparently approved by\r\nall the Great Powers.  Throughout the rest of Albania similar\r\nintervention will be necessary to establish order, and to protect the\r\nlife and property of the inhabitants without distinction of race,\r\ntribe, or creed.  Servia might perhaps have governed the country, had\r\nshe not been compelled by the Great Powers, at the instigation of\r\nAustria-Hungary, to withdraw her forces.  And her extrusion from the\r\nAdriatic threw her back toward the Aegean, with the result of shutting\r\nBulgaria out of Central Macedonia, which was annexed by Greece and\r\nServia presumably under arrangements satisfactory to the latter for an\r\noutlet to the sea at Saloniki.\r\n\r\nThe war declared by Austria-Hungary {xii} against Servia may be\r\nregarded to some extent as an effort to nullify in the interests of the\r\nformer the enormous advantages which accrued directly to Servia and\r\nindirectly to Russia from the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913.  That Russia\r\nshould have come to the support of Servia was as easy to foresee as any\r\nfuture political event whatever.  And the action of Germany and France\r\nonce war had broken out between their respective allies followed as a\r\nmatter of course.  If the Austro-German Alliance wins in the War of\r\nMany Nations it will doubtless control the eastern Adriatic and open up\r\na way for itself to the Aegean.  Indeed, in that event, German trade\r\nand German political influence would spread unchallenged across the\r\ncontinents from the North Sea to the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean.\r\nTurkey is a friend and ally; but even if Turkey were hostile she would\r\nhave no strength to resist such victorious powers.  And the Balkan\r\nStates, with the defeat of Russia, would be compelled to recognize\r\nGermanic supremacy.\r\n\r\n{xiii}\r\n\r\nIf on the other hand the Allies come out victorious in the War of Many\r\nNations, Servia and perhaps Roumania would be permitted to annex the\r\nprovinces occupied by their brethren in the Dual Monarchy and Servian\r\nexpansion to the Adriatic would be assured.  The Balkan States would\r\nalmost inevitably fall under the controlling influence of Russia, who\r\nwould become mistress of Constantinople and gain an unrestricted outlet\r\nto the Mediterranean through the Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmora, and the\r\nDardanelles.\r\n\r\nIn spite of themselves the destiny of the peoples of the Balkans is\r\nonce more set on the issue of war.  It is not inconceivable, therefore,\r\nthat some or all of those States may be drawn into the present colossal\r\nconflict.  In 1912-1913 the first war showed Bulgaria, Greece,\r\nMontenegro, and Servia allied against Turkey; and in the second war\r\nGreece, Montenegro, and Servia were joined by Roumania in the war\r\nagainst Bulgaria, who was also independently attacked {xiv} by Turkey.\r\nWhat may happen in 1914 or 1915 no one can predict.  But if this\r\nterrible conflagration, which is already devastating Europe and\r\nconvulsing all the continents and vexing all the oceans of the globe,\r\nspreads to the Balkans, one may hazard the guess that Greece,\r\nMontenegro, Servia, and Roumania will stand together on the side of the\r\nAllies and that Bulgaria if she is not carried away by marked\r\nAustro-German victories will remain neutral,--unless indeed the other\r\nBalkan States win her over, as they not inconceivably might do, if they\r\nrose to the heights of unwonted statesmanship by recognizing her claim\r\nto that part of Macedonia in which the Bulgarian element predominates\r\nbut which was ceded to her rivals by the Treaty of Bukarest.\r\n\r\nBut I have said enough to indicate that as in its origin so also in its\r\nresults this awful cataclysm under which the civilized world is now\r\nreeling will be found to be vitally connected with the Balkan Wars of\r\n1912-1913.  And I conclude {xv} with the hope that the present volume,\r\nwhich devotes indeed but little space to military matters and none at\r\nall to atrocities and massacres, may prove helpful to readers who seek\r\nlight on the underlying conditions, the causes, and the consequences of\r\nthose historic struggles.  The favor already accorded to the work and\r\nthe rapid exhaustion of the first edition* seem to furnish some\r\njustification of this hope.\r\n\r\nJACOB GOULD SCHURMAN.\r\n\r\n_November 26, 1914._\r\n\r\n\r\n*The present work is rather a reprint than a new edition, few changes\r\nhaving been made except the correction of typographical errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{1}\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTURKEY AND THE BALKAN STATES\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map: The Balkan Peninsula before the Wars of 1912-1913.]\r\n\r\n{3}\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTURKEY AND THE BALKAN STATES\r\n\r\nThe expulsion of the Turks from Europe was long ago written in the book\r\nof fate.  There was nothing uncertain about it except the date and the\r\nagency of destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TURKISH EMPIRE IN EUROPE\r\n\r\nA little clan of oriental shepherds, the Turks had in two generations\r\ngained possession of the whole of the northwest corner of Asia Minor\r\nand established themselves on the eastern shore of the Bosphorus.  The\r\ngreat city of Brusa, whose groves to-day enshrine the stately beauty of\r\ntheir mosques and sultans' tombs, capitulated to Orkhan, the son of the\r\nfirst Sultan, in 1326; and Nicaea, the cradle of the Greek church and\r\ntemporary capital of the Greek Empire, {4} surrendered in 1330.  On the\r\nother side of the Bosphorus Orkhan could see the domes and palaces of\r\nConstantinople which, however, for another century was to remain the\r\nseat of the Byzantine Empire.\r\n\r\nThe Turks crossed the Hellespont and, favored by an earthquake, marched\r\nin 1358 over the fallen walls and fortifications into the city of\r\nGallipoli.  In 1361 Adrianople succumbed to the attacks of Orkhan's\r\nson, Murad I, whose sway was soon acknowledged in Thrace and Macedonia,\r\nand who was destined to lead the victorious Ottoman armies as far north\r\nas the Danube.\r\n\r\nBut though the provinces of the corrupt and effete Byzantine Empire\r\nwere falling into the hands of the Turks, the Slavs were still\r\nunsubdued.  Lazar the Serb threw down the gauntlet to Murad.  On the\r\nmemorable field of Kossovo, in 1389, the opposing forces met--Murad\r\nsupported by his Asiatic and European vassals and allies, and Lazar\r\nwith his formidable army of {5} Serbs, Bosnians, Albanians, Poles,\r\nMagyars, and Vlachs.  Few battles in the world have produced such a\r\ndeep and lasting impression as this battle of Kossovo, in which the\r\nChristian nations after long and stubborn resistance were vanquished by\r\nthe Moslems.  The Servians still sing ballads which cast a halo of\r\npathetic romance round their great disaster.  And after more than five\r\ncenturies the Montenegrins continue to wear black on their caps in\r\nmourning for that fatal day.\r\n\r\nIn the next two centuries the Ottoman Empire moved on toward the zenith\r\nof its glory.  Mohammed II conquered Constantinople in 1453.  And in\r\n1529 Suleyman the Magnificent was at the gates of Vienna.  Suleyman's\r\nreign forms the climax of Turkish history.  The Turks had become a\r\ncentral European power occupying Hungary and menacing Austria.\r\nSuleyman's dominions extended from Mecca to Buda-Pesth and from Bagdad\r\nto Algiers.  He commanded the Mediterranean, the Euxine, {6} and the\r\nRed Sea, and his navies threatened the coasts of India and Spain.\r\n\r\nBut the conquests of the Turks were purely military.  They did nothing\r\nfor their subjects, whom they treated with contempt, and they wanted\r\nnothing from them but tribute and plunder.  As the Turks were always\r\nnumerically inferior to the aggregate number of the peoples under their\r\nsway, their one standing policy was to keep them divided--_divide et\r\nimpera_.  To fan racial and religious differences among their subjects\r\nwas to perpetuate the rule of the masters.  The whole task of\r\ngovernment, as the Turks conceived it, was to collect tribute from the\r\nconquered and keep them in subjection by playing off their differences\r\nagainst one another.\r\n\r\nBut a deterioration of Turkish rulers set in soon after the time of\r\nSuleyman with a corresponding decline in the character and efficiency\r\nof the army.  And the growth of Russia and the reassertion of Hungary,\r\nPoland, and Austria {7} were fatal to the maintenance of an alien and\r\ndetested empire founded on military domination alone.  By the end of\r\nthe seventeenth century the Turks had been driven out of Austria,\r\nHungary, Transylvania, and Podolia, and the northern boundaries of\r\ntheir Empire were fixed by the Carpathians, the Danube, and the Save.\r\nHow marked and rapid was the further decline of the Ottoman Empire may\r\nbe inferred from the fact that twice in the eighteenth century Austria\r\nand Russia discussed the project of dividing it between them.  But the\r\ninevitable disintegration of the Turkish dominion was not to inure to\r\nthe glorification of any of the Great Powers, though Russia certainly\r\ncontributed to the weakening of the common enemy.  The decline and\r\ndiminution of the Ottoman Empire continued throughout the nineteenth\r\ncentury.  What happened, however, was the revolt of subject provinces\r\nand the creation out of the territory of European Turkey of the\r\nindependent states of Greece, Servia, {8} Roumania, and Bulgaria.  And\r\nit was Bulgarians, Greeks, and Servians, with the active assistance of\r\nthe Montenegrins and the benevolent neutrality of the Roumanians, who,\r\nin the war of 1912-1913, drove the Turk out of Europe, leaving him\r\nnothing but the city of Constantinople and a territorial fringe\r\nbordered by the Chataldja line of fortifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARLIER SLAV EMPIRES\r\n\r\nThere is historic justice in the circumstance that the Turkish Empire\r\nin Europe met its doom at the hands of the Balkan nations themselves.\r\nFor these nationalities had been completely submerged and even their\r\nnational consciousness annihilated under centuries of Moslem\r\nintolerance, misgovernment, oppression, and cruelty.\r\n\r\nNone suffered worse than Bulgaria, which lay nearest to the capital of\r\nthe Mohammedan conqueror.  Yet Bulgaria had had a glorious, if\r\ncheckered, history long before there existed {9} any Ottoman Empire\r\neither in Europe or in Asia.  From the day their sovereign Boris\r\naccepted Christianity in 864 the Bulgarians had made rapid and\r\nconspicuous progress in their ceaseless conflicts with the Byzantine\r\nEmpire.  The Bulgarian church was recognized as independent by the\r\nGreek patriarch at Constantinople; its primates subsequently received\r\nthe title of patriarch, and their see was established at Preslav, and\r\nthen successively westward at Sofia, Vodena, Presba, and finally\r\nOchrida, which looks out on the mountains of Albania.  Under Czar\r\nSimeon, the son of Boris, \"Bulgaria,\" says Gibbon, \"assumed a rank\r\namong the civilized powers of the earth.\"  His dominions extended from\r\nthe Black Sea to the Adriatic and comprised the greater part of\r\nMacedonia, Greece, Albania, Servia, and Dalmatia; leaving only to the\r\nByzantine Empire--whose civilization he introduced and sedulously\r\npromoted among the Bulgarians--the cities of Constantinople, Saloniki,\r\nand Adrianople with {10} the territory immediately surrounding them.\r\nBut this first Bulgarian Empire was short-lived, though the western\r\npart remained independent under Samuel, who reigned, with Ochrida as\r\nhis capital, from 976 to 1014.  Four years later the Byzantine Emperor,\r\nBasil II, annihilated the power of Samuel, and for a hundred and fifty\r\nyears the Bulgarian people remained subject to the rule of\r\nConstantinople.  In 1186 under the leadership of the brothers Asen they\r\nregained their independence.  And the reign of Czar Asen II (1218-1240)\r\nwas the most prosperous period of all Bulgarian history.  He restored\r\nthe Empire of Simeon, his boast being that he had left to the\r\nByzantines nothing but Constantinople and the cities round it, and he\r\nencouraged commerce, cultivated arts and letters, founded and endowed\r\nchurches and monasteries, and embellished his capital, Trnovo, with\r\nbeautiful and magnificent buildings.  After Asen came a period of\r\ndecline culminating in a humiliating defeat by the Servians {11} in\r\n1330.  The quarrels of the Christian races of the Balkans facilitated\r\nthe advance of the Moslem invader, who overwhelmed the Serbs and their\r\nallies on the memorable field of Kossovo in 1389, and four years later\r\ncaptured and burned the Bulgarian capital, Trnovo, Czar Shishman\r\nhimself perishing obscurely in the common destruction.  For five\r\ncenturies Bulgaria remained under Moslem despotism, we ourselves being\r\nthe witnesses of her emancipation in the last thirty-five years.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the Serbs differed only in degree from that of the\r\nBulgarians.  Converted to Christianity in the middle of the ninth\r\ncentury, the major portion of the race remained till the twelfth\r\ncentury under either Bulgarian or Byzantine sovereignty.  But Stephen\r\nNemanyo brought under his rule Herzegovina, Montenegro, and part of\r\nmodern Servia and old Servia, and on his abdication in 1195 in favor of\r\nhis son launched a royal dynasty which reigned over the Serb people for\r\ntwo centuries.  Of {12} that line the most distinguished member was\r\nStephen Dushan, who reigned from 1331 to 1355.  He wrested the whole of\r\nthe Balkan Peninsula from the Byzantine Emperor, and took Belgrade,\r\nBosnia, and Herzegovina from the King of Hungary.  He encouraged\r\nliterature, gave to his country a highly advanced code of laws, and\r\nprotected the church whose head--the Archbishop of Ipek--he raised to\r\nthe dignity of patriarch.  On Easter Day 1346 he had himself crowned at\r\nUskub as \"Emperor of the Greeks and Serbs.\"  A few years later he\r\nembarked on an enterprise by which, had he been successful, he might\r\nhave changed the course of European history.  It was nothing less than\r\nthe capture of Constantinople and the union of Serbs, Bulgarians, and\r\nGreeks into an empire which might defend Christendom against the rising\r\npower of Islam.  Dushan was within forty miles of his goal with an army\r\nof 80,000 men when he died suddenly in camp on the 20th of December,\r\n1355.  Thirty-four years {13} later Dushan's countrymen were\r\nannihilated by the Turks at Kossovo!  All the Slavonic peoples of the\r\nBalkan Peninsula save the brave mountaineers of Montenegro came under\r\nMoslem subjection.  And under Moslem subjection they remained till the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTURKISH OPPRESSION OF SLAVS\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to give any adequate description of the horrors of\r\nTurkish rule in these Christian countries of the Balkans.  Their\r\npeople, disqualified from holding even the smallest office, were\r\nabsolutely helpless under the oppression of their foreign masters, who\r\nground them down under an intolerable load of taxation and plunder.\r\nThe culminating cruelty was the tribute of Christian children from ten\r\nto twelve years of age who were sent to Constantinople to recruit the\r\ncorps of janissaries.  It is not surprising that for the protection of\r\ntheir wives and children and the safeguarding of their interests the\r\nnobles of Bosnia and the {14} Pomaks of Southeastern Bulgaria embraced\r\nthe creed of their conquerors; the wonder is that the people as a whole\r\nremained true to their Christian faith even at the cost of daily\r\nmartyrdom from generation to generation.  Their fate too grew worse as\r\nthe Turkish power declined after the unsuccessful siege of Vienna in\r\n1683.  For at first Ottoman troops ravaged Bulgaria as they marched\r\nthrough the land on their way to Austria; and later disbanded soldiers\r\nin defiance of Turkish authority plundered the country and committed\r\nnameless atrocities.  Servia was to some extent protected by her remote\r\nlocation, but that very circumstance bred insubordination in the\r\njanissaries, who refused to obey the local Turkish governors and gave\r\nthemselves up to looting, brigandage, and massacre.  The national\r\nspirit of the subject races was completely crushed.  The Servians and\r\nBulgarians for three or four centuries lost all consciousness of a\r\nfatherland.  The countrymen of Simeon and Dushan became {15} mere\r\nhewers of wood and drawers of water for their foreign masters.  Servia\r\nand Bulgaria simply disappeared.  As late as 1834 Kinglake in\r\ntravelling to Constantinople from Belgrade must have passed straight\r\nacross Bulgaria.  Yet in \"Eothen,\" in which he describes his travels,\r\nhe never even mentions that country or its people.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand that this history of Turkish horrors should\r\nhave burned itself into the heart and soul of the resurrected Servia\r\nand Bulgaria of our own day.  But there is another circumstance\r\nconnected with the ruthless destruction and long entombment of these\r\nnationalities which it is difficult for foreigners, even the most\r\nintelligent foreigners, to understand or at any rate to grasp in its\r\nfull significance.  Yet the sentiments to which that circumstance has\r\ngiven rise and which it still nourishes are perhaps as potent a factor\r\nin contemporary Balkan politics as the antipathy of the Christian\r\nnations to their former Moslem oppressors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{16}\r\n\r\nGREEK ECCLESIASTICAL DOMINATION OF SLAVS\r\n\r\nI refer to the special and exceptional position held by the Greeks in\r\nthe Turkish dominions.  Though the Moslems had possessed themselves of\r\nthe Greek Empire from the Bosphorus to the Danube, Greek domination\r\nstill survived as an intellectual, ecclesiastical, and commercial\r\nforce.  The nature and effects of that supremacy, and its results upon\r\nthe fortunes of other Balkan nations, we must now proceed to consider.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish government classifies its subjects not on the basis of\r\nnationality but on the basis of religion.  A homogeneous religious\r\ngroup is designated a millet or nation.  Thus the Moslems form the\r\nmillet of Islam.  And at the present time there are among others a\r\nGreek millet, a Catholic millet, and a Jewish millet.  But from the\r\nfirst days of the Ottoman conquest until very recent times all the\r\nChristian population, irrespective of denominational differences, was\r\nassigned by the Sultans to the {17} Greek millet, of which the\r\npatriarch of Constantinople was the head.  The members of this millet\r\nwere all called Greeks; the bishops and higher clergy were exclusively\r\nGreek; and the language of their churches and schools was Greek, which\r\nwas also the language of literature, commerce, and polite society.  But\r\nthe jurisdiction of the patriarch was not restricted even to\r\necclesiastical and educational matters.  It extended to a considerable\r\npart of civil law--notably to questions of marriage, divorce, and\r\ninheritance when they concerned Christians only.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the possession by the Greek patriarch of\r\nConstantinople of this enormous power over the Christian subjects of\r\nthe Turks enabled him to carry on a propaganda of hellenization.  The\r\ndisappearance for three centuries of the national consciousness in\r\nServia and Bulgaria was not the sole work of the Moslem invader; a more\r\nfatal blight to the national languages and culture were the Greek\r\nbishops {18} and clergy who conducted their churches and schools.  And\r\nif Kinglake knew nothing of Bulgaria as late as 1834 it was because\r\nevery educated person in that country called himself a Greek.  For it\r\ncannot be too strongly emphasized that until comparatively recent times\r\nall Christians of whatever nation or sect were officially recognized by\r\nthe Turks as members of the Greek millet and were therefore designated\r\nGreeks.\r\n\r\nThe hostility of the Slavonic peoples in the Balkans, and especially of\r\nthe Bulgarians, to the Greeks, grows out of the ecclesiastical and\r\neducational domination which the Greek clergy and bishops so long and\r\nso relentlessly exercised over them.  Of course the Turkish Sultans are\r\nresponsible for the arrangement.  But there is no evidence that they\r\nhad any other intention than to rid themselves of a disagreeable task.\r\nFor the rest they regarded Greeks and Slavs with equal contempt.  But\r\nthe Greeks quickly recognized the racial advantage of their {19}\r\necclesiastical hegemony.  And it was not in human nature to give it up\r\nwithout a struggle.  The patriarchate retained its exclusive\r\njurisdiction over all orthodox populations till 1870, when the Sultan\r\nissued a firman establishing the Bulgarian exarchate.\r\n\r\nThere were two other spheres in which Greek influence was paramount in\r\nthe Turkish Empire.  The Turk is a soldier and farmer; the Greek is\r\npre-eminent as a trader, and his ability secured him a disproportionate\r\nshare of the trade of the empire.  Again, the Greeks of Constantinople\r\nand other large cities gradually won the confidence of the Turks and\r\nattained political importance.  During the eighteenth century the\r\nhighest officials in the empire were invariably Phanariots, as the\r\nConstantinople Greeks were termed from the quarter of the city in which\r\nthey resided.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the Greeks I have not had in mind the inhabitants of the\r\npresent kingdom of Greece.  Their subjection by the Turks was as {20}\r\ncomplete as that of the Serbs and Bulgarians, though of course they\r\nwere exempt from ecclesiastical domination at the hands of an alien\r\nclergy speaking a foreign language.  The enmity of the Bulgarians may\r\nto-day be visited upon the subjects of King Constantine, but it was not\r\ntheir ancestors who imposed upon Bulgaria foreign schools and churches\r\nbut the Greeks of Constantinople and Thrace, over whom the government\r\nof Athens has never had jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSERVIAN INDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\nSo much of the Balkan countries under Turkish rule.  Their emancipation\r\ndid not come till the nineteenth century.  The first to throw off the\r\nyoke was Servia.  Taking advantage of the disorganization and anarchy\r\nprevailing in the Ottoman Empire the Servian people rose in a body\r\nagainst their oppressors in January, 1804.  Under the able leadership\r\nfirst of Kara-George and afterward of Milosh Obrenovich, Servian {21}\r\nautonomy was definitely established in 1817.  The complete independence\r\nof the country was recognized by the Treaty of Berlin in 1878.  The\r\nboundaries of the new state, however, fell far short of Servian\r\naspirations, excluding as they did large numbers of the Servian\r\npopulation.  The first ruling prince of modern Servia was Milosh\r\nObrenovich; and the subsequent rulers have belonged either to the\r\nObrenovich dynasty or to its rival the dynasty of Kara-George.  King\r\nPeter, who came to the throne in 1903, is a member of the latter family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEK INDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\nScarcely had Servia won her freedom when the Greek war of independence\r\nbroke out.  Archbishop Germanos called the Christian population of the\r\nMorea under the standard of the cross in 1821.  For three years the\r\nGreeks, with the assistance of European money and volunteers (of whom\r\nLord Byron was the most illustrious), conducted a successful campaign\r\n{22} against the Turkish forces; but after the Sultan had in 1824\r\nsummoned to his aid Mehemet Ali, Pasha of Egypt, with his powerful\r\nfleet and disciplined army, the laurels which the Greek patriots had\r\nwon were recovered by the oppressor; and, with the recapture of Athens\r\nin May, 1827, the whole country once more lay under the dominion of the\r\nTurks.  The Powers now recognized that nothing but intervention could\r\nsave Greece for European civilization.  The Egyptian fleet was\r\nannihilated at Navarino in October, 1828, by the fleets of England,\r\nFrance, and Russia.  Greece was constituted an independent monarchy,\r\nthough the Powers who recognized its independence traced the frontier\r\nof the emancipated country in a jealous and niggardly spirit.  Prince\r\nOtto of Bavaria was designated the first King and reigned for thirty\r\nyears.  He was succeeded in 1863 by King George who lived to see the\r\nnorthern boundary of his kingdom advanced to Saloniki, where, like a\r\nfaithful sentinel at his post, he fell, on {23} March 18, 1913, by the\r\nhand of an assassin just as he had attained the glorious fruition of a\r\nreign of fifty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBULGARIAN INDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\nThere had been a literary revival preceding the dawn of independence in\r\nGreece.  In Bulgaria, which was the last of the Balkan states to become\r\nindependent, the national regeneration was also fostered by a literary\r\nand educational movement, of which the founding of the first Bulgarian\r\nschool--that of Gabrovo--in 1835 was undoubtedly the most important\r\nevent.  In the next five years more than fifty Bulgarian schools were\r\nestablished and five Bulgarian printing-presses set up.  The Bulgarians\r\nwere beginning to re-discover their own nationality.  Bulgarian schools\r\nand books produced a reaction against Greek culture and the Greek\r\nclergy who maintained it.  Not much longer would Greek remain the\r\nlanguage of the upper classes in Bulgarian cities; not much {24} longer\r\nwould ignorant peasants, who spoke only Bulgarian, call themselves\r\nGreek.  The days of the spiritual domination of the Greek patriarchate\r\nwere numbered.  The ecclesiastical ascendency of the Greeks had crushed\r\nBulgarian nationality more completely than even the civil power of the\r\nTurks.  The abolition of the spiritual rule of foreigners and the\r\nrestoration of the independent Bulgarian church became the leading\r\nobject of the literary reformers, educators, and patriots.  It was a\r\nlong and arduous campaign--a campaign of education and awakening at\r\nhome and of appeal and discussion in Constantinople.  Finally the\r\nSultan intervened and in 1870 issued a firman establishing the\r\nBulgarian exarchate, conferring on it immediate jurisdiction over\r\nfifteen dioceses, and providing for the addition of other dioceses on a\r\nvote of two-thirds of their Christian population.  The new Bulgarian\r\nexarch was immediately excommunicated by the Greek patriarch.  But the\r\nfirst and most important official step had {25} been taken in the\r\ndevelopment of Bulgarian nationality.\r\n\r\nThe revolt against the Turks followed in 1876.  It was suppressed by\r\nacts of cruelty and horror unparalleled even in the Balkans.  Many\r\nthousands of men, women, and children were massacred and scores of\r\nvillages destroyed.  I remember vividly--for I was then in England--how\r\nGladstone's denunciation of those atrocities aroused a wave of moral\r\nindignation and wrath which swept furiously from one end of Great\r\nBritain to the other, and even aroused the governments and peoples of\r\nthe Continent of Europe.  The Porte refusing to adopt satisfactory\r\nmeasures of reform, Russia declared war and her victorious army\r\nadvanced to the very gates of Constantinople.  The Treaty of San\r\nStefano, which Russia then enforced upon Turkey, created a \"Big\r\nBulgaria\" that extended from the Black Sea to the Albanian Mountains\r\nand from the Danube to the Aegean, leaving to Turkey, however,\r\nAdrianople, Saloniki, and the {26} Chalcidician Peninsula.  But this\r\ntreaty was torn to pieces by the Powers, who feared that \"Big Bulgaria\"\r\nwould become a mere Russian dependency, and they substituted for it the\r\nTreaty of Berlin.  Under this memorable instrument, which dashed to the\r\nground the racial and national aspirations of the Bulgarians which the\r\nTreaty of San Stefano had so completely satisfied, their country was\r\nrestricted to a \"tributary principality\" lying between the Danube and\r\nthe Balkans, Eastern Roumelia to the south being excluded from it and\r\nmade an autonomous province of Turkey.  This breach in the political\r\nlife of the race was healed in 1885 by the union of Eastern Roumelia\r\nwith Bulgaria; and the Ottoman sovereignty, which had become little\r\nmore than a form, was completely ended in 1908 when the ruler of the\r\nenlarged principality of Bulgaria publicly proclaimed it an independent\r\nkingdom.  In spite of a protest from the Porte the independence of\r\nBulgaria was at once recognized by the Powers.  {27} If Bulgaria owed\r\nthe freedom with which the Treaty of Berlin dowered her to the swords,\r\nand also to the pens, of foreigners, her complete independence was her\r\nown achievement.  But it was not brought about till a generation after\r\nthe Treaty of Berlin had recognized the independence of Servia,\r\nMontenegro, and Roumania and delegated to Austria-Hungary the\r\nadministration of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Yet the progress made by\r\nBulgaria first under Prince Alexander and especially since 1887 under\r\nPrince Ferdinand (who subsequently assumed the title of King and later\r\nof Czar) is one of the most astonishing phenomena in the history of\r\nModern Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BALKAN COUNTRIES\r\n\r\nThus in consequence of the events we have here so hastily sketched\r\nTurkey had lost since the nineteenth century opened a large portion of\r\nthe Balkan Peninsula.  Along the Danube and the Save at the north\r\nBulgaria and Servia had {28} become independent kingdoms and Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina had at first practically and later formally been annexed to\r\nAustria-Hungary.  At the extreme southern end of the Balkan Peninsula\r\nthe Greeks had carved out an independent kingdom extending from Cape\r\nMatapan to the Vale of Tempe and the Gulf of Arta.  All that remained\r\nof European Turkey was the territory lying between Greece and the Slav\r\ncountries of Montenegro, Bosnia, Servia, and Bulgaria.  The Porte has\r\ndivided this domain into six provinces or vilayets, besides\r\nConstantinople and its environs.  These vilayets are Scutari and Janina\r\non the Adriatic; Kossovo and Monastir, adjoining them on the east; next\r\nSaloniki, embracing the centre of the area; and finally Adrianople,\r\nextending from the Mesta River to the Black Sea.  In ordinary language\r\nthe ancient classical names are generally used to designate these\r\ndivisions.  The vilayet of Adrianople roughly corresponds to Thrace,\r\nthe Adriatic vilayets to Epirus, and the intervening {29} territory to\r\nMacedonia.  Parts of the domain in question are, however, also known\r\nunder other names.  The district immediately south of Servia is often\r\ncalled Old Servia; and the Adriatic coast lands between Montenegro and\r\nGreece are generally designated Albania on the north and Epirus on the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nThe area of Turkey in Europe in 1912 was 169,300 square kilometers; of\r\nBulgaria 96,300; of Greece 64,600; of Servia 48,300; and of Montenegro\r\n9,000.  The population of European Turkey at the same date was\r\n6,130,000; of Bulgaria 4,329,000; of Greece 2,632,000; of Servia\r\n2,912,000; and of Montenegro 250,000.  To the north of the Balkan\r\nstates, with the Danube on the south and the Black Sea on the east, lay\r\nRoumania having an area of 131,350 square kilometers and a population\r\nof 7,070,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{30}\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF THE FIRST BALKAN WAR\r\n\r\nWhat was the occasion of the war between Turkey and the Balkan states\r\nin 1912?  The most general answer that can be given to that question is\r\ncontained in the one word _Macedonia_.  Geographically Macedonia lies\r\nbetween Greece, Servia, and Bulgaria.  Ethnographically it is an\r\nextension of their races.  And if, as Matthew Arnold declared, the\r\nprimary impulse both of individuals and of nations is the tendency to\r\nexpansion, Macedonia both in virtue of its location and of its\r\npopulation was fore-ordained to be a magnet to the emancipated\r\nChristian nations of the Balkans.  Of course the expansion of Greeks\r\nand Slavs meant the expulsion of Turks.  Hence the Macedonian question\r\nwas the quintessence of the Near Eastern Question.\r\n\r\nBut apart altogether from the expansionist ambitions and the racial\r\nsympathies of their kindred in Bulgaria, Servia, and Greece, the {31}\r\npopulation of Macedonia had the same right to emancipation from Turkish\r\ndomination and oppression as their brethren in these neighboring\r\nstates.  The Moslems had forfeited their sovereign rights in Europe by\r\ntheir unutterable incapacity to govern their Christian subjects.  Had\r\nthe Treaty of Berlin sanctioned, instead of undoing, the Treaty of San\r\nStefano, the whole of Macedonia would have come under Bulgarian\r\nsovereignty; and although Servia and especially Greece would have\r\nprotested against the Bulgarian absorption of their Macedonian brethren\r\n(whom they had always hoped to bring under their own jurisdiction when\r\nthe Turk was expelled) the result would certainly have been better for\r\nall the Christian inhabitants of Macedonia as well as for the\r\nMohammedans (who number 800,000 persons or nearly one third of the\r\nentire population of Macedonia).  As it was these people were all\r\ndoomed to a continuation of Turkish misgovernment, oppression, and\r\nslaughter.  The Treaty of Berlin {32} indeed provided for reforms, but\r\nthe Porte through diplomacy and delay frustrated all the efforts of\r\nEurope to have them put into effect.  For fifteen years the people\r\nwaited for the fulfilment of the European promise of an amelioration of\r\ntheir condition, enduring meanwhile the scandalous misgovernment of\r\nAbdul Hamid II.  But after 1893 revolutionary societies became active.\r\nThe Internal Organization was a local body whose programme was\r\n\"Macedonia for the Macedonians.\"  But both in Bulgaria and in Greece\r\nthere were organized societies which sent insurgent bands into\r\nMacedonia to maintain and assert their respective national interests.\r\nThis was one of the causes of the war between Turkey and Greece in\r\n1897, and the reverses of the Greeks in that war inured to the\r\nadvantage of the Bulgarian propaganda in Macedonia.  Servian bands soon\r\nafter began to appear on the scene.  These hostile activities in\r\nMacedonia naturally produced reprisals at the hands of the Turkish\r\nauthorities.  In one {33} district alone 100 villages were burned, over\r\n8,000 houses destroyed, and 60,000 peasants left without homes at the\r\nbeginning of winter.  Meanwhile the Austrian and Russian governments\r\nintervened and drew up elaborate schemes of reform, but their plans\r\ncould not be adequately enforced and the result was failure.  The\r\nAustro-Russian entente came to an end in 1908, and in the same year\r\nEngland joined Russia in a project aiming at a better administration of\r\njustice and involving more effective European supervision.  Scarcely\r\nhad this programme been announced when the revolution under the Young\r\nTurk party broke out which promised to the world a regeneration of the\r\nOttoman Empire.  Hopeful of these constitutional reformers of Turkey,\r\nEurope withdrew from Macedonia and entrusted its destinies to its new\r\nmaster.  Never was there a more bitter disappointment.  If autocratic\r\nSultans had punished the poor Macedonians with whips, the Young Turks\r\nflayed them with scorpions.  {34} Sympathy, indignation, and horror\r\nconspired with nationalistic aspirations and territorial interests to\r\narouse the kindred populations of the surrounding states.  And in\r\nOctober, 1912, war was declared against Turkey by Bulgaria, Servia,\r\nMontenegro, and Greece.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BALKAN LEAGUE\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the so-called Balkan Alliance about which much has\r\nbeen written and many errors ignorantly propagated.  For months after\r\nthe outbreak of the war against Turkey the development of this Alliance\r\ninto a Confederation of the Balkan states, on the model of the American\r\nor the German constitution, was a theme of constant discussion in\r\nEurope and America.  As a matter of fact there existed no juridical\r\nground for this expectation, and the sentiments of the peoples of the\r\nfour Christian nations, even while they fought together against the\r\nMoslem, were saturated with such an infusion of suspicion {35} and\r\nhostility as to render nugatory any programme of Balkan confederation.\r\nAn alliance had indeed been concluded between Greece and Bulgaria in\r\nMay, 1912, but it was a defensive, not an offensive alliance.  It\r\nprovided that in case Turkey attacked either of these states, the other\r\nshould come to its assistance with all its forces, and that whether the\r\nobject of the attack were the territorial integrity of the nation or\r\nthe rights guaranteed it by international law or special conventions.\r\nWithout the knowledge of the Greek government, an offensive alliance\r\nagainst Turkey had in March, 1912, been concluded between Servia and\r\nBulgaria which determined their respective military obligations in case\r\nof war and the partition between them, in the event of victory, of the\r\nconquered Turkish provinces in Europe.  A similar offensive and\r\ndefensive alliance between Greece and Turkey was under consideration,\r\nbut before the plan was matured Bulgaria and Servia had decided to\r\ndeclare war against Turkey.  This {36} decision had been hastened by\r\nthe Turkish massacres at Kochana and Berane, which aroused the deepest\r\nindignation, especially in Bulgaria.  Servia and Bulgaria informed\r\nGreece that in three days they would mobilize their forces for the\r\npurpose of imposing reforms on Turkey, and, if within a specified time\r\nthey did not receive a satisfactory reply, they would invade the\r\nOttoman territory and declare war.  They invited Greece on this short\r\nnotice to co-operate with them by a simultaneous mobilization.  It was\r\na critical moment not only for the little kingdom of King George, but\r\nfor that great cause of Hellenism which for thousands of years had\r\nanimated, and which still animated, the souls of the Greek population\r\nin all Aegean lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREECE AND THE LEAGUE\r\n\r\nKing George himself was a ruler of large experience, of great practical\r\nwisdom, and of fine diplomatic skill.  He had shortly before {37}\r\nselected as prime minister the former Cretan insurgent, Mr. Eleutherios\r\nVenizelos.  It is significant that the new premier had also taken the\r\nWar portfolio.  He foresaw the impending conflict--as every wise\r\nstatesman in Europe had foreseen it--and began to make preparations for\r\nit.  For the reorganization of the army and navy he secured French and\r\nEnglish experts, the former headed by General Eydoux, the latter by\r\nAdmiral Tufnel.  By 1914 it was estimated that the military and naval\r\nforces of the country would be thoroughly trained and equipped, and war\r\nwas not expected before that date.  But now in 1912 the hand of the\r\nGreek government was forced.  And a decision one way or the other was\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nMr. Venizelos had already proved himself an agitator, an orator, and a\r\npolitician.  He was now to reveal himself not only to Greece but to\r\nEurope as a wise statesman and an effective leader of his people.  The\r\nfirst test came in his answer to the invitation to join Bulgaria and\r\n{38} Servia within three days in a war against Turkey.  Of all\r\npossibilities open to him Mr. Venizelos rejected the programme of\r\ncontinued isolation for Greece.  There were those who glorified it as\r\nsplendid and majestic: to him under the existing circumstances it\r\nseemed stupid in itself and certain to prove disastrous in its results.\r\nGreece alone would never have been able to wage a war against Turkey.\r\nAnd if Greece declined to participate in the inevitable conflict, which\r\nthe action of the two Slav states had only hastened, then whether they\r\nwon or Turkey won, Greece was bound to lose.  It was improbable that\r\nthe Ottoman power should come out of the contest victorious; but, if\r\nthe unexpected happened, what would be the position, not only of the\r\nmillions of Greeks in the Turkish Empire, but of the little kingdom of\r\nGreece itself on whose northern boundary the insolent Moslem oppressor,\r\nflushed with his triumph over Bulgaria, Servia, and Montenegro, would\r\nbe immovably entrenched?  On the other {39} hand, if these Christian\r\nstates themselves should succeed, as seemed likely, in destroying the\r\nOttoman Empire in Europe, the Kingdom of Greece, if she now remained a\r\npassive spectator of their struggles, would find in the end that\r\nMacedonia had come into the possession of the victorious Slavs, and the\r\nGreat Idea of the Greeks--the idea of expansion into Hellenic lands\r\neastward toward Constantinople--exploded as an empty bubble.  It was\r\nMr. Venizelos's conclusion that Greece could not avoid participating in\r\nthe struggle.  Neutrality would have entailed the complete bankruptcy\r\nof Hellenism in the Orient.  There remained only the alternative of\r\nco-operation--co-operation with Turkey or co-operation with the\r\nChristian states of the Balkans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEK AND BULGARIAN ANTIPATHIES\r\n\r\nHow near Greece was to an alliance with Turkey the world may never\r\nknow.  At the time nothing of the sort was even suspected.  It {40} was\r\nnot until Turkey had been overpowered by the forces of the four\r\nChristian states and the attitude of Bulgaria toward the other three on\r\nthe question of the division of the conquered territories had become\r\nirreconcilable and menacing that Mr. Venizelos felt it proper to\r\ncommunicate to the Greek people the history of the negotiations by\r\nwhich the Greek government had bound their country to a partner now\r\nfelt to be so unreasonable and greedy.  Feeling in Greece was running\r\nhigh against Bulgaria.  The attacks on Mr. Venizelos's government were\r\nnumerous and bitter.  He was getting little or no credit for the\r\nvictory that had been won against Turkey, while his opponents denounced\r\nhim for sacrificing the fruits of that victory to Bulgaria.  The Greek\r\nnation especially resented the occupation by Bulgarian troops of the\r\nAegean coast lands with their large Hellenic population which lay\r\nbetween the Struma and the Mesta including the cities of Seres and\r\nDrama and especially Kavala with {41} its fine harbor and its\r\nhinterland famed for crops of choice tobacco.\r\n\r\nIt was on the fourth of July, 1913, a few days after the outbreak of\r\nthe war between Bulgaria and her late allies, that Mr. Venizelos made\r\nhis defence in an eloquent and powerful speech at a special session of\r\nthe Greek parliament.  The accusation against him was not only that\r\nduring the late war he had sacrificed Greek interests to Bulgaria but\r\nthat he had committed a fatal blunder in joining her in the campaign\r\nagainst Turkey.  His reply was that since Greece could not stand alone\r\nhe had to seek allies in the Balkans, and that it was not his fault if\r\nthe choice had fallen on Bulgaria.  He had endeavored to maintain peace\r\nwith Turkey.  Listen to his own words:\r\n\r\n\"I did not seek war against the Ottoman Empire.  I would not have\r\nsought war at a later date if I could have obtained any adjustment of\r\nthe Cretan question--that thorn in the side of Greece which can no\r\nlonger be left as {42} it is without rendering a normal political life\r\nabsolutely impossible for us.  I endeavored to adjust this question, to\r\ncontinue the policy of a close understanding with the neighboring\r\nempire, in the hope of obtaining in this way the introduction of\r\nreforms which would render existence tolerable to the millions of\r\nGreeks within the Ottoman Empire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRETAN PROBLEM\r\n\r\nIt was this Cretan question, even more than the Macedonian question,\r\nwhich in 1897 had driven Greece, single-handed and unprepared, into a\r\nwar with Turkey in which she was destined to meet speedy and\r\noverwhelming defeat.  It was this same \"accursed Cretan question,\" as\r\nMr. Venizelos called it, which now drew the country into a military\r\nalliance against her Ottoman neighbor who, until too late, refused to\r\nmake any concession either to the just claims of the Cretans or to the\r\nconciliatory proposals of the Greek government.\r\n\r\n{43}\r\n\r\nLying midway between three continents, the island of Crete has played a\r\nlarge part both in ancient and modern history.  The explorations and\r\nexcavations of Sir Arthur Evans at Cnossus seem to prove that the\r\nHomeric civilization of Tiryns and Mycenae was derived from Crete,\r\nwhose earliest remains carry us back three thousand years before the\r\nChristian era.  And if Crete gave to ancient Greece her earliest\r\ncivilization she has insisted on giving herself to modern Greece.  It\r\nis a natural union; for the Cretans are Greeks, undiluted with Turk,\r\nAlbanian, or Slav blood, though with some admixture of Italian.  The\r\none obstacle to this marriage of kindred souls has been Turkey.  For\r\nCrete was taken from the Venetians by the Turks in 1669, after a twenty\r\nyears' siege of Candia, the capital.  A portion of the inhabitants\r\nembraced the creed of their conquerors, so that at the present time\r\nperhaps two-thirds of the population are Christian and one-third\r\nMoslem.  The result has been to make Crete the {44} worst governed\r\nprovince of the Ottoman Empire.  In Turkey in Europe diversity of race\r\nhas kept the Christians quarreling with one another; in Crete diversity\r\nof religion plunges the same race into internecine war as often as once\r\nin ten years.  The island had been the scene of chronic insurrections\r\nall through the nineteenth century.  Each ended as a rule with a\r\npromise of the Sultan to confer upon the Cretans some form of local\r\nself-government, with additional privileges, financial or other.  But\r\nthese promises were never fulfilled.  Things went from bad to worse.\r\nThe military intervention of Greece in 1897 led to war with Turkey in\r\nwhich she was disastrously defeated.  The European Powers had meantime\r\nintervened and they decided that Crete should be endowed with autonomy\r\nunder the sovereignty of the Sultan, and in 1898 they appointed Prince\r\nGeorge of Greece as High Commissioner.  Between the political parties\r\nof the island and the representatives of the Powers {45} the Prince,\r\nwho worked steadily for the welfare of Crete, had a difficult task, and\r\nin 1906 he withdrew, his successor being Mr. Zaimis, a former prime\r\nminister of Greece.  The new commissioner was able to report to the\r\nprotecting Powers in 1908 that a gendarmerie had been established, that\r\ntranquility was being maintained, and that the Moslem population\r\nenjoyed safety and security.  Thereupon the Powers began to withdraw\r\ntheir forces from the island.  And the project for annexation with\r\nGreece, which had been proclaimed by the Cretan insurgents under Mr.\r\nVenizelos in 1905 and which the insular assembly had hastened to\r\nendorse, was once more voted by the assembly, who went on to provide\r\nfor the government of the island in the name of the King of Greece.  I\r\nhave not time to follow in detail the history of this programme of\r\nannexation.  Suffice it to say that the Cretans ultimately went so far\r\nas to elect members to sit in the Greek parliament at Athens, and that\r\nTurkey had {46} given notice that their admission to the chamber would\r\nbe regarded as a _casus belli_.  I saw them on their arrival in Athens\r\nin October, 1912, where they received a most enthusiastic welcome from\r\nthe Greeks, while everybody stopped to admire their picturesque dress,\r\ntheir superb physique, and their dignified demeanor.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Venizelos excluded these delegates from the chamber he would\r\ndefy the sentiments of the Greek people.  If he admitted them, Turkey\r\nwould proclaim war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. VENIZELOS'S SOLUTION\r\n\r\nThe course actually pursued by Mr. Venizelos in this predicament he\r\nhimself explained to the parliament in the speech delivered at the\r\nclose of the war against Turkey from which I have already quoted.  He\r\ndeclared to his astonished countrymen that in his desire to reach a\r\nclose understanding with Turkey he had arrived at the point where he no\r\nlonger demanded a union of Crete with Greece, \"knowing it was {47} too\r\nmuch for the Ottoman Empire.\"  What he did ask for was the recognition\r\nof the right of the Cretan deputies to sit in the Greek chamber, while\r\nCrete itself should remain an autonomous state under the sovereignty of\r\nthe Sultan.  Nay, Mr. Venizelos was so anxious to prevent war with\r\nTurkey that he made another concession, for which, he frankly\r\nconfessed, his political opponents if things had turned out differently\r\nwould have impeached him for high treason.  He actually proposed, in\r\nreturn for the recognition of the right of the Cretan deputies to sit\r\nin the Greek chamber, that Greece should pay on behalf of Crete an\r\nannual tribute to the Porte.\r\n\r\nHappily for Mr. Venizelos's government the Young Turk party who then\r\ngoverned the Ottoman Empire rejected all these proposals.  Meanwhile\r\ntheir misgovernment and massacre of Christians in Macedonia were\r\ninflaming the kindred Slav nations and driving them into war against\r\nTurkey.  When matters had {48} reached a crisis, the reactionary and\r\nincompetent Young Turk party were forced out of power and a wise and\r\nprudent statesman, the venerable Kiamil Pasha, succeeded to the office\r\nof Grand Vizier.  He was all for conciliation and compromise with the\r\nGreek government, whom he had often warned against an alliance with\r\nBulgaria, and he had in readiness a solution of the Cretan question\r\nwhich he was certain would be satisfactory to both Greece and Turkey.\r\nBut these concessions were now too late.  Greece had decided to throw\r\nin her lot with Servia and Bulgaria.  And a decree was issued for the\r\nmobilization of the Greek troops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WAR\r\n\r\nThere is not time, nor have I the qualifications, to describe the\r\nmilitary operations which followed.  In Greece the Crown Prince was\r\nappointed commanding general, and the event proved him one of the great\r\ncaptains of our day.  The prime minister, who was also minister {49} of\r\nwar, furnished him with troops and munitions and supplies.  The plains\r\nand hills about Athens were turned into mock battlefields for the\r\ntraining of raw recruits; and young Greeks from all parts of the\r\nworld--tens of thousands of them from America--poured in to protect the\r\nfatherland and to fight the secular enemy of Europe.  The Greek\r\ngovernment had undertaken to raise an army of 125,000 men to co-operate\r\nwith the Allies; it was twice as large a number as even the friends of\r\nGreece dreamed possible; yet before the war closed King Constantine had\r\nunder his banner an army of 250,000 men admirably armed, clothed, and\r\nequipped;--each soldier indeed having munitions fifty per cent in\r\nexcess of the figure fixed by the general staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEK MILITARY AND NAVAL OPERATIONS\r\n\r\nThe Greek army, which had been concentrated at Larissa, entered\r\nMacedonia by the Meluna Pass and the valley of the Xerias River.  {50}\r\nThe Turks met the advancing force at Elassona, but retired after a few\r\nhours' fighting.  They took their stand at the pass of Sarandaporon,\r\nfrom which they were driven by a day's hard fighting on the part of the\r\nGreek army and the masterly tactics of the Crown Prince.  On October 23\r\nthe Greeks were in possession of Serfidje.  Thence they pushed forward\r\non both sides of the Aliakmon River toward Veria, which the Crown\r\nPrince entered with his staff on the morning of October 30.  They had\r\ncovered 150 miles from Larissa, with no facilities but wagons for\r\nfeeding the army and supplying ammunition.  But at Veria they struck\r\nthe line of railway from Monastir to Saloniki.  Not far away was\r\nJenitsa, where the Turkish army numbering from 35,000 to 40,000 had\r\nconcentrated to make a stand for the protection of Saloniki.  The\r\nbattle of Jenitsa was fiercely contested but the Greeks were victorious\r\nthough they lost about 2000 men.  This victory opened the way to\r\nSaloniki.  The Turkish armies {51} which defended it having been\r\nscattered by the Greek forces, that city surrendered to Crown Prince\r\nConstantine on the eighth of November.  It was only three weeks since\r\nthe Greek army had left Larissa and it had disposed of about 60,000\r\nTurks on the way.\r\n\r\nOn the outbreak of war Greece had declared a blockade of all Turkish\r\nports.  To the usual list of contraband articles there were added not\r\nonly coal, concerning which the practice of belligerent nations had\r\nvaried, but also machine oil, which so far as I know was then for the\r\nfirst time declared contraband of war.  As Turkey imported both coal\r\nand lubricants, the purpose of this policy was of course to paralyze\r\ntransportation in the Ottoman Empire.  Incidentally I may say the\r\nprohibition of lubricating oil caused much inconvenience to American\r\ncommerce; not, however, primarily on its own account, but because of\r\nits confusion, in the minds of Greek officials, with such harmless\r\nsubstances as cotton seed oil and oleo.  The {52} Greek navy not only\r\nmaintained a very effective blockade but also took possession of all\r\nthe Aegean Islands under Turkish rule, excepting Rhodes and the\r\nDodecanese, which Italy held as a temporary pledge for the fulfilment\r\nby Turkey of some of the conditions of the treaty by which they had\r\nclosed their recent war.  It will be seen, therefore, that the navy was\r\na most important agent in the campaign, and Greece was the only one of\r\nthe Allies that had a navy.  The Greek navy was sufficient not only to\r\nterrorize the Turkish navy, which it reduced to complete impotence, but\r\nalso to paralyze Turkish trade and commerce with the outside world, to\r\nembarrass railway transportation within the Empire, to prevent the\r\nsending of reinforcements to Macedonia or the Aegean coast of Thrace,\r\nand to detach from Turkey those Aegean Islands over which she still\r\nexercised effective jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{53}\r\n\r\nSERB MILITARY OPERATIONS\r\n\r\nOn land the other Allies had been not less active than Greece.\r\nMontenegro had fired the first shot of the war.  And the brave soldiers\r\nof King Nicholas, the illustrious ruler of the one Balkan state which\r\nthe Turks had never conquered, were dealing deadly blows to their\r\nsecular enemy both in Novi Bazar and Albania.\r\n\r\nAs the Greeks had pressed into southern Macedonia, so the Servian\r\narmies advanced through old Servia into northern and central Macedonia.\r\nIn their great victory over the Turkish forces at Kumanovo they avenged\r\nthe defeat of their ancestors at Kossovo five hundred years before.\r\nStill marching southward they again defeated the enemy in two great\r\nengagements, the one at Prilip and the other at Monastir.  The latter\r\ncity had been the object of the Greek advance to Fiorina, but when the\r\nprize fell to Servia, though the Greeks were disappointed, it made no\r\nbreach in the friendship {54} of the two Allies.  Already no doubt they\r\nwere both gratified that the spheres of their military occupation were\r\nconterminous and that no Turkish territory remained for Bulgaria to\r\noccupy west of the Vardar River.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBULGARIAN MILITARY OPERATIONS\r\n\r\nWhile Greece and Servia were scattering, capturing, or destroying the\r\nTurkish troops stationed in Macedonia, and closing in on that province\r\nfrom north and south like an irresistible vise, it fell to Bulgaria to\r\nmeet the enemy's main army in the plains of Eastern Thrace.  The\r\ndistribution of the forces of the Allies was the natural result of\r\ntheir respective geographical location.  Macedonia to the west of the\r\nVardar and Bregalnitza Rivers was the only part of Turkey which\r\nadjoined Greece and Servia.  Thrace, on the other hand, marched with\r\nthe southern boundary of Bulgaria from the sources of the Mesta River\r\nto the Black Sea, and its eastern half was intersected {55} diagonally\r\nby the main road from Sofia to Adrianople and Constantinople.  Along\r\nthis line the Bulgarians sent their forces against the common enemy as\r\nsoon as war was declared.  The swift story of their military exploits,\r\nthe record of their brilliant victories, struck Europe with amazement.\r\nHere was a country which only thirty-five years earlier had been an\r\nunknown and despised province of Turkey in Europe now overwhelming the\r\narmies of the Ottoman Empire in the great victories of Kirk Kilisse,\r\nLule Burgas, and Chorlu.  In a few weeks the irresistible troops of\r\nKing Ferdinand had reached the Chataldja line of fortifications.  Only\r\ntwenty-five miles beyond lay Constantinople where they hoped to\r\ncelebrate their final triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLLAPSE OF TURKEY\r\n\r\nThe Great Powers of Europe had other views.  Even if the Bulgarian\r\ndelay at Chataldja--a delay probably due to {56} exhaustion--had not\r\ngiven the Turks time to strengthen their defences and reorganize their\r\nforces, it is practically certain that the Bulgarian army would not\r\nhave been permitted to enter Constantinople.  But with the exception of\r\nthe capital and its fortified fringe, all Turkey in Europe now lay at\r\nthe mercy of the Allies.  The entire territory was either already\r\noccupied by their troops or could be occupied at leisure.  Only at\r\nthree isolated points was the Ottoman power unsubdued.  The city of\r\nAdrianople, though closely besieged by the Bulgarians, still held out,\r\nand the great fortresses of Scutari in Northern Albania and Janina in\r\nEpirus remained in the hands of their Turkish garrisons.\r\n\r\nThe power of Turkey had collapsed in a few weeks.  Whether the ruin was\r\ndue to inefficiency and corruption in government or the injection by\r\nthe Young Turk party of politics into the army or exhaustion resulting\r\nfrom the recent war with Italy or to other causes more obscure, {57} we\r\nneed not pause to inquire.  The disaster itself, however, had spread\r\nfar enough in the opinion of Europe, and a Peace Conference was\r\nsummoned in December.  Delegates from the belligerent states and\r\nambassadors from the Great Powers came together in London.  But their\r\nlabors in the cause of peace proved unavailing.  Turkey was unwilling\r\nto surrender Adrianople and Bulgaria insisted on it as a _sine qua\r\nnon_.  The Peace Conference broke up and hostilities were resumed.  The\r\nsiege of Adrianople was pressed by the Bulgarians with the aid of\r\n60,000 Servian troops.  It was taken by storm on March 26.  Already, on\r\nMarch 6, Janina had yielded to the well directed attacks of King\r\nConstantine.  And the fighting ended with the spectacular surrender on\r\nApril 23 of Scutari to King Nicholas, who for a day at least defied the\r\nunited will of Europe.\r\n\r\nTurkey was finally compelled to accept terms of peace.  In January,\r\nwhile the London Peace Conference was still in session, Kiamil Pasha,\r\n{58} who had endeavored to prepare the nation for the territorial\r\nsacrifice he had all along recognized as inevitable, was driven from\r\npower and his war minister, Nazim Pasha, murdered through an uprising\r\nof the Young Turk party executed by Enver Bey, who himself demanded the\r\nresignation of Kiamil and carried it to the Sultan and secured its\r\nacceptance.  The insurgents set up Mahmud Shevket Pasha as Grand Vizier\r\nand made the retention of Adrianople their cardinal policy.  But the\r\nsame inexorable fate overtook the new government in April as faced\r\nKiamil in January.  The Powers were insistent on peace, and the\r\nsuccesses of the Allies left no alternative and no excuse for delay.\r\nThe Young Turk party who had come to power on the Adrianople issue were\r\naccordingly compelled to ratify the cession to the allies of the city\r\nwith all its mosques and tombs and historic souvenirs.  The Treaty of\r\nLondon, which proved to be short-lived, was signed on May 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{59}\r\n\r\nTHE TERMS OF PEACE\r\n\r\nThe treaty of peace provided that beyond a line drawn from Enos near\r\nthe mouth of the Maritza River on the Aegean Sea to Midia on the coast\r\nof the Black Sea all Turkey should be ceded to the Allies except\r\nAlbania, whose boundaries were to be fixed by the Great Powers.  It was\r\nalso stipulated that the Great Powers should determine the destiny of\r\nthe Aegean Islands belonging to Turkey which Greece now claimed by\r\nright of military occupation and the vote of their inhabitants (nearly\r\nall of whom were Greek).  A more direct concession to Greece was the\r\nwithdrawal of Turkish sovereignty over Crete.  The treaty also\r\ncontained financial and other provisions, but they do not concern us\r\nhere.  The essential point is that, with the exception of\r\nConstantinople and a narrow hinterland for its protection, the Moslems\r\nafter more than five centuries of possession had been driven out of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n{60}\r\n\r\nThis great and memorable consummation was the achievement of the united\r\nnations of the Balkans.  It was not a happy augury for the immediate\r\nfuture to recall the historic fact that the past successes of the\r\nMoslems had been due to dissensions and divisions among their Christian\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{61}\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE WAR BETWEEN THE ALLIES\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map showing the Turkish Territories occupied by the\r\nArmies of Bulgaria, Greece, Montenegro, and Servia at the close of the\r\nWar against Turkey.]\r\n\r\n{63}\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE WAR BETWEEN THE ALLIES\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of London officially eliminated Turkey from the further\r\nsettlement of the Balkan question.  Thanks to the good will of the\r\nGreat Powers toward herself or to their rising jealousy of Bulgaria she\r\nwas not stripped of her entire European possessions west of the\r\nChataldja lines where the victorious Bulgarians had planted their\r\nstandards.  The Enos-Midia frontier not only guaranteed to her a\r\nconsiderable portion of territory which the Bulgarians had occupied but\r\nextended her coast line, from the point where the Chataldja lines\r\nstrike the Sea of Marmora, out through the Dardanelles and along the\r\nAegean littoral to the mouth of the Maritza River.  To that extent the\r\nGreat Powers may be said to have re-established the {64} Turks once\r\nmore in Europe from which they had been practically driven by the\r\nBalkan Allies, and especially the Bulgarians.  All the rest of her\r\nEuropean possessions, however, Turkey was forced to surrender either in\r\ntrust to the Great Powers or absolutely to the Balkan Allies.\r\n\r\nThe great question now was how the Allies should divide among\r\nthemselves the spoils of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRIVAL AMBITIONS OF THE ALLIES\r\n\r\nThis was a difficult matter to adjust.  Before the war began, as we\r\nhave already seen, a Treaty of Partition had been negotiated between\r\nBulgaria and Servia, but conditions had changed materially in the\r\ninterval and Servia now demanded a revision of the treaty and refused\r\nto withdraw her troops from Central Macedonia, which the treaty had\r\nmarked for reversion to Bulgaria.  In consequence the relations between\r\nthe governments and peoples of {65} Servia and Bulgaria were\r\ndangerously strained.  The Bulgarians denounced the Servians as\r\nperfidious and faithless and the Servians responded by excoriating the\r\ncolossal greed and intolerance of the Bulgarians.  The immemorial\r\nmutual hatred of the two Slav nations was stirred to its lowest depths,\r\nand it boiled and sputtered like a witches' cauldron.\r\n\r\nIn Eastern Macedonia Bulgarians and Greeks were each eagerly pushing\r\ntheir respective spheres of occupation without much regard to the\r\nrights or feeling of the other Ally.  Though the Bulgarians had not\r\nforgiven the Greeks for anticipating them in the capture of Saloniki in\r\nthe month of November, the rivalry between them in the following winter\r\nand spring had for its stage the territory between the Struma and the\r\nMesta Rivers--and especially the quadrilateral marked by Kavala and\r\nOrphani on the coast and Seres and Drama on the line of railway from\r\nSaloniki to Adrianople.  The Greeks had one advantage over the\r\nBulgarians: {66} their troops could be employed to secure extensions of\r\nterritory for the Hellenic kingdom at a time when Bulgaria still needed\r\nthe bulk of her forces to fight the Turks at Chataldja and Adrianople.\r\nHence the Greeks occupied towns in the district from which Bulgarian\r\ntroops had been recalled.  Nor did they hesitate to dislodge scattered\r\nBulgarian troops which their ally had left behind to establish a claim\r\nof occupation.  Naturally disputes arose between the military\r\ncommanders and these led to repeated armed encounters.  On March 5\r\nGreeks and Bulgarians fought at Nigrita as they subsequently fought at\r\nPravishta, Leftera, Panghaion, and Anghista.\r\n\r\nThis conduct of the Allies toward one another while the common enemy\r\nwas still in the field boded ill for their future relations.  \"Our next\r\nwar will be with Bulgaria,\" said the man on the street in Athens, and\r\nthis bellicose sentiment was reciprocated alike by the Bulgarian people\r\nand the Bulgarian army.  The {67} secular mutual enmities and\r\nanimosities of the Greeks and Bulgarians, which self-interest had\r\nsuppressed long enough to enable the Balkan Allies to make European\r\nTurkey their own, burst forth with redoubled violence under the\r\nstimulus of the imperious demand which the occasion now made upon them\r\nall for an equitable distribution of the conquered territory.  For ages\r\nthe fatal vice of the Balkan nations has been the immoderate and\r\nintolerant assertion by each of its own claims coupled with\r\ncontemptuous disregard of the rights of others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALBANIA A CAUSE OF FRICTION\r\n\r\nThere were also external causes which contributed to the deepening\r\ntragedy in the Balkans.  Undoubtedly the most potent was the\r\ndislocation of the plans of the Allies by the creation of an\r\nindependent Albania.  This new kingdom was called into being by the\r\nvoice of the European concert at the demand of Austria-Hungary\r\nsupported by Italy.\r\n\r\n{68}\r\n\r\nThe controlling force in politics, though not the only force, is\r\nself-interest.  Austria-Hungary had long sought an outlet through\r\nMacedonia to the Aegean by way of Saloniki.  It was also the aim of\r\nServia to reach the Adriatic.  But the foreign policy of\r\nAustria-Hungary, which has millions of Serbs under its dominion, has\r\nsteadily opposed the aggrandizement of Servia.  And now that Servia and\r\nher allies had taken possession of Macedonia and blocked the path of\r\nAustria-Hungary to Saloniki, it was not merely revenge, it was\r\nself-interest pursuing a consistent foreign policy, which moved the\r\nDual Monarchy to make the cardinal feature of its Balkan programme the\r\nexclusion of Servia from access to the Adriatic Sea.  Before the first\r\nBalkan war began the Adriatic littoral was under the dominion of\r\nAustria-Hungary and Italy, for though Montenegro and European Turkey\r\nwere their maritime neighbors neither of them had any naval strength.\r\nNaturally {69} these two dominant powers desired that after the close\r\nof the Balkan war they should not be in a worse position in the\r\nAdriatic than heretofore.  But if Servia were allowed to expand\r\nwestward to the Adriatic, their supremacy might in the future be\r\nchallenged.  For Servia might enter into special relations with her\r\ngreat sister Slav state, Russia, or a confederation might be formed\r\nembracing all the Balkan states between the Black Sea and the Adriatic:\r\nand, in either event, Austria-Hungary and Italy would no longer enjoy\r\nthe unchallenged supremacy on the Adriatic coasts which was theirs so\r\nlong as Turkey held dominion over the maritime country lying between\r\nGreece and Montenegro.  As a necessity of practical politics,\r\ntherefore, there emerged the Austro-Italian policy of an independent\r\nAlbania.  But natural and essential as this policy was for Italy and\r\nAustria-Hungary, it was fatal to Servia's dream of expansion to the\r\nAdriatic; it set narrow limits to the northward extension of {70}\r\nGreece into Epirus, and the southward extension of Montenegro below\r\nScutari; it impelled these Allies to seek compensation in territory\r\nthat Bulgaria had regarded as her peculiar preserve; and as a\r\nconsequence it seriously menaced the existence of the Balkan Alliance\r\ntorn as it already was by mutual jealousies, enmities, aggressions, and\r\nrecriminations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOIL OF SERVIA TOWARD THE AEGEAN\r\n\r\nThe first effect of the European fiat regarding an independent Albania\r\nwas the recoil of Servia against Bulgaria.  Confronted by the _force\r\nmajeure_ of the Great Powers which stopped her advance to the Adriatic,\r\nServia turned her anxious regard toward the Gulf of Saloniki and the\r\nAegean Sea.  Already her victorious armies had occupied Macedonia from\r\nthe Albanian frontier eastward beyond the Vardar River to Strumnitza,\r\nIstib, and Kochana, and southward below Monastir and Ghevgheli, where\r\nthey touched the boundary of the {71} Greek occupation of Southern\r\nMacedonia.  An agreement with the Greeks, who held the city of Saloniki\r\nand its hinterland as well as the whole Chalcidician Peninsula, would\r\nensure Servia an outlet to the sea.  And the merchants of\r\nSaloniki--mostly the descendants of Jews expelled from Spain in the\r\nfifteenth century--were shrewd enough to recognize the advantage to\r\ntheir city of securing the commerce of Servia, especially as they were\r\ndestined to lose, in consequence of hostile tariffs certain to be\r\nestablished by the conquerors, a considerable portion of the trade\r\nwhich had formerly flowed to them without let or hindrance from a large\r\nsection of European Turkey.  The government of Greece was equally\r\nfavorably disposed to this programme; for, in the first place, it was\r\nto its interest to cultivate friendly relations with Servia, in view of\r\npossible embroilments with Bulgaria; and, in the second place, it had\r\nto countercheck the game of those who wanted either to make Saloniki a\r\nfree city or to {72} incorporate it in a Big Bulgaria, and who were\r\nusing with some effect the argument that the annexation of the city to\r\nGreece meant the throttling of its trade and the annihilation of its\r\nprosperity.  The interests of the city of Saloniki, the interests of\r\nGreece, and the interests of Servia all combined to demand the free\r\nflow of Servian trade by way of Saloniki.  And if no other power\r\nobtained jurisdiction over any Macedonian territory through which that\r\ntrade passed, it would be easy for the Greek and Servian governments to\r\ncome to an understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATY RESTRICTIONS\r\n\r\nJust here, however, was the rub.  The secret treaty of March, 1912,\r\nproviding for the offensive and defensive alliance of Bulgaria and\r\nServia against the Ottoman Empire regulated, in case of victory, the\r\ndivision of the conquered territory between the Allies.  And the\r\nextreme limit, on the south and east, of Turkish territory {73}\r\nassigned to Servia by this treaty was fixed by a line starting from\r\nOchrida on the borders of Albania and running northeastward across the\r\nVardar River a few miles above Veles and thence, following the same\r\ngeneral direction, through Ovcepolje and Egri Palanka to Golema Vreh on\r\nthe frontier of Bulgaria--a terminus some twenty miles southeast of the\r\nmeeting point of Servia, Macedonia, and Bulgaria.  During the war with\r\nTurkey the Servian armies had paid no attention to the Ochrida-Golema\r\nVreh line.  The great victory over the Turks at Kumanovo, by which the\r\nSlav defeat at Kossovo five hundred years earlier was avenged, was, it\r\nis true, won at a point north of the line in question.  But the\r\nsubsequent victories of Prilip and Monastir were gained to the south of\r\nit--far, indeed, into the heart of the Macedonian territory recognized\r\nby the treaty as Bulgarian.\r\n\r\nIf you look at a map you will see that the boundary between Servia and\r\nBulgaria, starting {74} from the Danube, runs in a slightly undulating\r\nline due south.  Now what the military forces of King Peter did during\r\nthe war of the Balkan states with the Ottoman Empire was to occupy all\r\nEuropean Turkey south of Servia between the prolongation of that\r\nboundary line and the new Kingdom of Albania till they met the Hellenic\r\narmy advancing northward under Crown Prince Constantine, when the two\r\ngovernments agreed on a common boundary for New Servia and New Greece\r\nalong a line starting from Lake Presba and running eastward between\r\nMonastir and Fiorina to the Vardar River a little to the south of\r\nGhevgheli.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APPLE OF DISCORD\r\n\r\nBut this arrangement between Greece and Servia would leave no territory\r\nfor Bulgaria in Central and Western Macedonia!  Yet Servia had solemnly\r\nbound herself by treaty not to ask for any Turkish territory below the\r\nOchrida-Golema Vreh line.  There was no {75} similar treaty with\r\nGreece, but Bulgaria regarded the northern frontier of New Greece as a\r\nmatter for adjustment between the two governments.  Servia, withdrawn\r\nbehind the Ochrida-Golema Vreh line in accordance with the terms of the\r\ntreaty, would at any rate have nothing to say about the matter.  And,\r\nalthough the Bulgarian government never communicated, officially or\r\nunofficially, its own views to Greece or Servia, I believe we should\r\nnot make much mistake in asserting that a line drawn from Ochrida to\r\nSaloniki (which Bulgaria in spite of the Greek occupation continued to\r\nclaim) would roughly represent the limit of its voluntary concession.\r\nNow if you imagine a base line drawn from Saloniki to Goletna Vreh, you\r\nhave an equilateral triangle resting on Ochrida as apex.  And this\r\nequilateral triangle represents approximately what Bulgaria claimed in\r\nthe western half of Macedonia as her own.\r\n\r\nThe war between the Allies was fought over the possession of this\r\ntriangle.  The larger {76} portion of it had in the war against Turkey\r\nbeen occupied by the forces of Servia; and the nation, inflamed by the\r\nmilitary spirit of the army, had made up its mind that, treaty or no\r\ntreaty, it should not be evacuated.  On the south, especially above\r\nVodena, the Greeks had occupied a section of the fatal triangle.  And\r\nthe two governments had decided that they would not tolerate the\r\ndriving of a Bulgarian wedge between New Servia and New Greece.\r\nBulgaria, on the other hand, was inexorable in her demands on Servia\r\nfor the fulfilment of the terms of the Treaty of Partition.  At the\r\nsame time she worried the Greek government about the future of\r\nSaloniki, and that at a time when the Greek people were criticizing Mr.\r\nVenizelos for having allowed the Bulgarians to occupy regions in\r\nMacedonia and Thrace inhabited by Greeks, notably Seres, Drama, and\r\nKavala, and the adjacent country between the Struma and the Mesta.\r\nThese were additional causes of dissension between the Allies.  But the\r\nprimary {77} disruptive force was the attraction, the incompatible\r\nattraction, exerted on them all by that central Macedonian triangle\r\nwhose apex rested on the ruins of Czar Samuel's palace at Ochrida and\r\nwhose base extended from Saloniki to Golema Vreh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLAIM OF BULGARIA\r\n\r\nFrom that base line to the Black Sea nearly all European Turkey (with\r\nthe exception of the Chalcidician Peninsula, including Saloniki and its\r\nhinterland) had been occupied by the military forces of Bulgaria.  Why\r\nthen was Bulgaria so insistent on getting beyond that base line,\r\ncrossing the Vardar, and possessing herself of Central Macedonia up to\r\nOchrida and the eastern frontier of Albania?\r\n\r\nThe answer, in brief, is that it has been the undeviating policy of\r\nBulgaria, ever since her own emancipation by Russia in 1877, to free\r\nthe Bulgarians still under the Ottoman yoke and unite them in a common\r\nfatherland.  The {78} Great Bulgaria which was created by Russia in the\r\ntreaty she forced on Turkey--the Treaty of San Stefano--was constructed\r\nunder the influence of the idea of a union of the Bulgarian race in a\r\nsingle state under a common government.  This treaty was afterward torn\r\nto pieces by the Congress of Berlin, which set up for the Bulgarians a\r\nvery diminutive principality.  But the Bulgarians, from the palace down\r\nto the meanest hut, have always been animated by that racial and\r\nnational idea.  The annexation of Eastern Roumelia in 1885 was a great\r\nstep in the direction of its realization.  And it was to carry that\r\nprogramme to completion that Bulgaria made war against Turkey in 1912.\r\nHer primary object was the liberation of the Bulgarians in Macedonia\r\nand their incorporation in a Great Bulgaria.  And the Treaty of\r\nPartition with Servia seemed, in the event of victory over Turkey, to\r\nafford a guarantee of the accomplishment of her long-cherished purpose.\r\nIt was a strange irony of {79} fate that while as a result of the\r\ngeographical situation of the belligerents Bulgaria, at the close of\r\nthe war with Turkey, found herself in actual occupation of all European\r\nTurkey from the Black Sea up to the River Struma and beyond,--that is,\r\nall Thrace to Chataldja as well as Eastern Macedonia--her allies were\r\nin possession of the bulk of Macedonia, including the entire triangle\r\nshe had planned to inject between the frontiers of New Servia and New\r\nGreece!\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarians claimed this triangle on ethnological grounds.  Its\r\ninhabitants, they asseverated, were their brethren, as genuinely\r\nBulgarian as the subjects of King Ferdinand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRACIAL PROPAGANDA IN MACEDONIA\r\n\r\nOf all perplexing subjects in the world few can be more baffling than\r\nthe distribution of races in Macedonia.  The Turks classify the\r\npopulation, not by language or by physical characteristics, but by\r\nreligion.  A Greek is a member of the Orthodox Church who {80}\r\nrecognizes the patriarch of Constantinople; a Bulgarian, on the other\r\nhand, is one of the same religious faith who recognizes the exarch; and\r\nsince the Servians in Turkey have no independent church but recognize\r\nthe patriarchate they are often, as opposed to Bulgarians, called\r\nGreeks.  Race, being thus merged in religion--in something that rests\r\non the human will and not on physical characteristics fixed by\r\nnature--can in that part of the world be changed as easily as religion.\r\nA Macedonian may be a Greek to-day, a Bulgarian to-morrow, and a\r\nServian next day.  We have all heard of the captain in the comic opera\r\nwho \"in spite of all temptations to belong to other nations\" remained\r\nan Englishman.  There would have been nothing comic in this assertion\r\nhad the redoubtable captain lived in Macedonia.  In that land a race is\r\na political party composed of members with common customs and religion\r\nwho stand for a \"national idea\" which they strenuously endeavor to\r\nforce on others.\r\n\r\n{81}\r\n\r\nMacedonia is the land of such racial propaganda.  As the Turkish\r\ngovernment forbids public meetings for political purposes, the\r\npropaganda takes an ecclesiastical and linguistic form.  Each \"race\"\r\nseeks to convert the people to its faith by the agency of schools and\r\nchurches, which teach and use its own language.  Up to the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century the Greeks, owing to their privileged\r\necclesiastical position in the Ottoman Empire, had exclusive spiritual\r\nand educational jurisdiction over the members of the Orthodox Church in\r\nMacedonia.  The opposition of the Bulgarians led, as we have already\r\nseen, to the establishment in 1870 of the exarchate, that is, of an\r\nindependent Bulgarian Orthodox Church with the exarch at its head.  The\r\nBulgarian propaganda in Macedonia demanded the appointment of bishops\r\nto conduct churches and schools under the authority of the exarchate.\r\nIn 1891 the Porte conceded Bulgarian bishops to Ochrida and Uskub, in\r\n1894 to Veles and Nevrokop, {82} and in 1898 to Monastir, Strumnitza,\r\nand Dibra.  As has been well said, the church of the exarchate was\r\nreally occupied in creating Bulgarians: it offered to the Slavonic\r\npopulation of Macedonia services and schools conducted in a language\r\nwhich they understood and showed a genuine interest in their education.\r\nBy 1900 Macedonia had 785 Bulgarian schools, 39,892 pupils, and 1,250\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\nThe Servian propaganda in Macedonia was at a disadvantage in comparison\r\nwith the Bulgarian because it had not a separate ecclesiastical\r\norganization.  As we have already seen, the orthodox Serbs owe\r\nallegiance to the Greek patriarch in Constantinople.  And at first they\r\ndid not push their propaganda as zealously or as successfully as the\r\nBulgarians.  In fact the national aspirations of the people of Servia\r\nhad been in the direction of Bosnia and Herzegovina; but after these\r\nprovinces were assigned to Austria by the Treaty of Berlin, a marked\r\n{83} change of attitude occurred in the Servian government and nation.\r\nThey now claimed as Servian the Slavonic population of Macedonia which\r\nhitherto Bulgaria had cultivated as her own.  The course of politics in\r\nBulgaria, notably her embroilment with Russia, inured to the advantage\r\nof the Servian propaganda in Macedonia, which after 1890 made great\r\nheadway.  The Servian government made liberal contributions for\r\nMacedonian schools.  And before the nineteenth century closed the\r\nServian propaganda could claim 178 schools in the vilayets of Saloniki\r\nand Monastir and in Uskub with 321 teachers and 7,200 pupils.\r\n\r\nThese Slav propagandists made serious encroachments upon the Greek\r\ncause, which, only a generation earlier, had possessed a practical\r\nmonopoly in Macedonia.  Greek efforts too were for a time almost\r\nparalyzed in consequence of the disastrous issue of the Greco-Turkish\r\nwar in 1897.  Nevertheless in 1901 the Greeks claimed 927 schools in\r\nthe vilayets of {84} Saloniki and Monastir with 1,397 teachers and\r\n57,607 pupils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRACIAL FACTS AND FALLACIES\r\n\r\nThe more bishops, churches, and schools a nationality could show, the\r\nstronger its claim on the reversion of Macedonia when the Turk should\r\nbe driven out of Europe!  There was no doubt much juggling with\r\nstatistics.  And though schools and churches were provided by Greeks,\r\nServians, and Bulgarians to satisfy the spiritual and intellectual\r\nneeds of their kinsmen in Macedonia, there was always the ulterior\r\n(which was generally the dominant) object of staking out claims in the\r\ndomain soon to drop from the paralyzed hand of the Turk.  The bishops\r\nmay have been good shepherds of their flocks, but the primary\r\nqualification for the office was, I imagine, the gift of aggressive\r\npolitical leadership.  The Turkish government now favored one\r\nnationality and now another as the interests of the moment seemed {85}\r\nto suggest.  With an impish delight in playing off Slav against Greek\r\nand Servian against Bulgarian, its action on applications for\r\nbishoprics was generally taken with a view to embarrassing the rival\r\nChristian nationalities.  And it could when necessary keep the\r\npropagandists within severe limits.  The Bulgarians grew bold after\r\nsecuring so many bishoprics in the nineties and the bishop at Uskub\r\nthought to open new schools and churches.  But the Turkish\r\ngovernor--the Vali--summoned him and delivered this warning: \"O\r\nBulgarian, sit upon the eggs you have, and do not burst your belly by\r\ntrying to lay more.\"\r\n\r\nHow are we to determine the racial complexion of a country in which\r\nrace is certified by religion, in which religion is measured by the\r\nnumber of bishops and churches and schools, in which bishops and\r\nchurches and schools are created and maintained by a propaganda\r\nconducted by competing external powers, and in which the results of the\r\npropaganda {86} are determined largely by money and men sent from\r\nSofia, Athens, and Belgrade, subject always to the caprice and\r\nmanipulation of the Sultan's government at Constantinople?\r\n\r\nIn Southern Macedonia from the Thessalian frontier as far north as the\r\nparallel of Saloniki, the population is almost exclusively Greek, as is\r\nalso the whole of the Chalcidician Peninsula, while further east the\r\ncoast region between the Struma and the Mesta is also predominantly\r\nGreek.  Eastern Macedonia to the north of the line of Seres and Drama\r\nand south of the Kingdom of Bulgaria is generally Bulgarian.  On the\r\nnorthwest from the city of Uskub up to the confines of Servia and\r\nBosnia, Macedonia is mixed Serb, Bulgarian, and Albanian, with the Serb\r\nelement preponderating as you travel northward and the Albanian\r\nwestward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{87}\r\n\r\nPERSONAL OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIENCES\r\n\r\nThe difficulty comes when we attempt to give the racial character of\r\nCentral Macedonia, which is equally remote from Greece, Bulgaria, and\r\nServia.  I travelled through this district last summer.  On June 29,\r\nwhen the war broke out between the Allies I found myself in Uskub.\r\nThrough the courtesy of the Servian authorities I was permitted to ride\r\non the first military train which left the city.  Descending at Veles I\r\ndrove across Central Macedonia by way of Prilip to Monastir, spending\r\nthe first night, for lack of a better bed, in the carriage, which was\r\nguarded by Servian sentries.  From Monastir I motored over execrable\r\nroads to Lake Presba and Lake Ochrida and thence beyond the city of\r\nOchrida to Struga on the Black Drin, from which I looked out on the\r\nmountains of Albania.\r\n\r\nComing from Athens where for many months I had listened to patriotic\r\nstories of {88} the thorough permeation of Macedonia by Greek\r\nsettlements my first surprise was my inability to discover a Greek\r\nmajority in Central Macedonia.  In most of the cities a fraction of the\r\npopulation indeed is Greek and as a rule the colony is prosperous.\r\nThis is especially true in Monastir, which is a stronghold of Greek\r\ninfluence.  But while half the population of Monastir is Mohammedan the\r\nso-called Bulgarians form the majority of the Christian population,\r\nthough both Servians and Roumanians have conducted energetic\r\npropaganda.  In Veles two-thirds of the population are Christians and\r\nnearly all of these are called Bulgarians.  In Ochrida the lower town\r\nis Mohammedan and the upper Christian, and the Christian population is\r\nalmost exclusively of the Bulgarian Church.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow, however, that the people of Central Macedonia, even\r\nif Bulgarian churches are in the ascendant among them, are really\r\nconnected by ties of blood and language {89} with Bulgaria rather than\r\nwith Servia.  If history is invoked we shall have to admit that under\r\nDushan this region was a part of the Serb empire as under Simeon and\r\nAsen it was part of the Bulgarian.  If an appeal is made to\r\nanthropology the answer is still uncertain.  For while the Mongolian\r\nfeatures--broad flat faces, narrow eyes, and straight black hair--which\r\ncharacterize the subjects of King Ferdinand can be seen--I myself have\r\nseen them--as far west as Ochrida, they may also be found all over\r\nNorthern Servia as far as Belgrade though the Servian physical type is\r\nentirely different.  There is no fixed connection between the\r\nanthropological unit and the linguistic or political unit.\r\nFurthermore, while there are well-marked groups who call themselves\r\nSerbs or Bulgarians there is a larger population not so clearly\r\ndifferentiated by physique or language.  Undoubtedly they are Slavs.\r\nBut whether Serb or Bulgarian, or intermediate between the two, no one\r\nto-day can demonstrate.  Central {90} Macedonia has its own dialects,\r\nany one of which under happy literary auspices might have developed\r\ninto a separate language.  And the men who speak them to-day can more\r\nor less understand either Servian or Bulgarian.  Hence as the anonymous\r\nand highly authoritative author of \"Turkey in Europe,\" who calls\r\nhimself Odysseus, declares:\r\n\r\n\"The practical conclusion is that neither Greeks, Servians, nor\r\nBulgarians have a right to claim Central Macedonia.  The fact that they\r\nall do so shows how weak each claim must be.\"\r\n\r\nYet it was Bulgaria's intransigent assertion of her claim to Central\r\nMacedonia which led to the war between the Allies.\r\n\r\nIt will be instructive to consider the attitude of each of the\r\ngovernments concerned on the eve of the conflict.  I hope I am in a\r\nposition correctly to report it.  Certainly I had unusual opportunities\r\nto learn it.  For besides the official position I held in Athens during\r\nthe entire course of both Balkan wars I visited the {91} Balkan states\r\nin June and was accorded the privilege of discussing the then pending\r\ncrisis with the prime ministers of Roumania, Servia, and Bulgaria.  It\r\nwould of course be improper to quote them; nay more, I feel myself\r\nunder special obligation sacredly to respect the confidence they\r\nreposed in me.  But the frank disclosures they made in these\r\nconversations gave me a point of view for the comprehension of the\r\nsituation and the estimate of facts which I have found simply\r\ninvaluable.  And if Mr. Venizelos in Athens, or Mr. Maioresco in\r\nBukarest, or Mr. Pashitch in Belgrade, or Dr. Daneff, who is no longer\r\nprime minister of Bulgaria, should ever chance to read what I am\r\nsaying, I hope each will feel that I have fairly and impartially\r\npresented the attitude which their respective governments had taken at\r\nthis critical moment on the vital issue then confronting them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{92}\r\n\r\nTHE ATTITUDE OF SERVIA\r\n\r\nI have already indicated the situation of Servia.  Compelled by the\r\nGreat Powers to withdraw her troops from Albania, after they had\r\ntriumphantly made their way to the Adriatic, she was now requested by\r\nBulgaria to evacuate Central Macedonia up to the Ochrida-Golema Vreh\r\nline in accordance with the terms of the treaty between the two\r\ncountries which was ratified in March, 1912.  The Servian government\r\nbelieved that for the loss of Albania, which the treaty assumed would\r\nbe annexed to Servia, they were entitled to compensation in Macedonia.\r\nAnd if now, instead of compensation for the loss of an outlet on the\r\nAdriatic, they were to withdraw their forces from Central Macedonia and\r\nallow Bulgaria to establish herself between New Servia and New Greece,\r\nthey would block their own way to Saloniki, which was the only prospect\r\nnow left of a Servian outlet to the sea.  Nor was this the whole {93}\r\nstory by any means.  The army, which comprised all able-bodied\r\nServians, was in possession of Central Macedonia; and the military\r\nleaders, with the usual professional bias in favor of imperialism,\r\ndictated their expansionist views to the government at Belgrade.  If\r\nBulgaria would not voluntarily grant compensation for the loss of\r\nAlbania, the Servian people were ready to take it by force.  They had\r\nalso a direct claim against Bulgaria.  They had sent 60,000 soldiers to\r\nthe siege of Adrianople, which the Bulgarians had hitherto failed to\r\ncapture.  And the Servians were now asking, in bitter irony, whether\r\nthey had gone to war solely for the benefit of Bulgaria; whether\r\nbesides helping her to win all Thrace and Eastern Macedonia they were\r\nnow to present her with Central Macedonia, and that at a time when the\r\nEuropean Concert had stripped them of the expected prize of Albania\r\nwith its much desired Adriatic littoral!  This argument was graphically\r\npresented on a map of which I secured a {94} copy in Belgrade.  The\r\nlegend on this map reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Territories occupied by Servia 55,000 square miles.  Servia cedes to\r\nher allies in the east and south 3,800 square miles.  Servia cedes to\r\nAlbania 15,200 square miles.  Servia retains 36,000 square miles.\r\nTerritories occupied by Bulgaria to Enos-Midia, 51,200 square miles.\r\nThe Bulgarians demand from the Servians still 10,240 square miles.\r\nAccording to Bulgarian pretensions Bulgaria should get 61,520 square\r\nmiles and Servia only 25,760!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPOSED REVISION OF TREATY AND ARBITRATION\r\n\r\nWhen the treaty between Servia and Bulgaria was negotiated, it seems to\r\nhave been assumed that the theatre of a war with Turkey would be\r\nMacedonia and that Thrace--the country from the Mesta to the Black\r\nSea--would remain intact to Turkey.  And if the rest of Turkey in\r\nEurope up to the Adriatic {95} were conquered by the two Allies, the\r\nOchrida-Golema Vreh line would make a fairly equitable division between\r\nthem of the spoils of war.  But with Albania denied to Servia and\r\nThrace occupied by Bulgaria, conditions had wholly changed.  The\r\nServian government declared that the changed conditions had abrogated\r\nthe Treaty of Partition and that it was for the two governments now to\r\nadjust themselves to the logic of events!  On May 28 Mr. Pashitch, the\r\nServian prime minister, formally demanded a revision of the treaty.  A\r\npersonal interview with the Bulgarian prime minister, Mr. Gueshoff,\r\nfollowed on June 2 at Tsaribrod.  And Mr. Gueshoff accepted Mr.\r\nPashitch's suggestion (which originated with Mr. Venizelos, the Greek\r\nprime minister) of a conference of representatives of the four Allies\r\nat St. Petersburg.  For it should be added that, in the Treaty of\r\nPartition, the Czar had been named as arbiter in case of any\r\nterritorial dispute between the two parties.\r\n\r\n{96}\r\n\r\nWhat followed in the next few days has never been clearly disclosed.\r\nBut it was of transcendent importance.  I have always thought that if\r\nMr. Gueshoff, one of the authors of the Balkan Alliance, had been\r\nallowed like Mr. Venizelos and Mr. Pashitch, to finish his work, there\r\nwould have been no war between the Allies.  I did not enjoy the\r\npersonal acquaintance of Mr. Gueshoff, but I regarded him as a wise\r\nstatesman of moderate views, who was disposed to make reasonable\r\nconcessions for the sake of peace.  But a whole nation in arms, flushed\r\nwith the sense of victory, is always dangerous to the authority of\r\ncivil government.  If Mr. Gueshoff was ready to arrange some\r\naccommodation with Mr. Pashitch, the military party in Bulgaria was all\r\nthe more insistent in its demands on Servia for the evacuation of\r\nCentral Macedonia.  Even in Servia Mr. Pashitch had great difficulty in\r\nrepressing the jingo ardor of the army, whose bellicose spirit was\r\nbelieved to find expression in the attitude {97} of the Crown Prince.\r\nBut the provocation in Bulgaria was greater, because, when all was said\r\nand done, Servia was actually violating an agreement with Bulgaria to\r\nwhich she had solemnly set her name.  Possibly the military party\r\ngained the ear of King Ferdinand.  Certainly it was reported that he\r\nwas consulting with leaders of the opposition.  Presumably they were\r\nall dissatisfied with the conciliatory attitude which Mr. Gueshoff had\r\nshown in the Tsaribrod conference.  Whatever the expiation, Mr.\r\nGueshoff resigned on June 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDELAY AND OPPOSITION OF BULGARIA\r\n\r\nOn that very day the Czar summoned the Kings of Bulgaria and Servia to\r\nsubmit their disputes to his decision.  While this demand was based on\r\na specific provision of the Servo-Bulgarian treaty, His Majesty also\r\nurged it on the ground of devotion to the Slav cause.  This pro-Slav\r\nargument provoked much criticism in Austro-Hungarian circles which {98}\r\nresented bitterly the assumption of Slav hegemony in Balkan affairs.\r\nHowever, on June 12 Bulgaria and Servia accepted Russian arbitration.\r\nBut the terms were not agreed upon.  While Mr. Venizelos and Mr.\r\nPashitch impatiently awaited the summons to St. Petersburg they could\r\nget no definite information of the intentions of the Bulgarian\r\ngovernment.  And the rivalry of Austria-Hungary and Russia for\r\npredominance in the Balkans was never more intense than at this\r\ncritical moment.\r\n\r\nOn June 14 Dr. Daneff was appointed prime minister in succession to Mr.\r\nGueshoff.  He had represented Bulgaria in the London Peace Conference\r\nwhere his aggressive and uncompromising attitude had perturbed his\r\nfellow delegates from the other Balkan states and provoked some\r\ncriticism in the European press.  He was known as a Russophil.  And he\r\nseems now to have got assurance from Russia that she would maintain the\r\nBulgarian view of the treaty with Servia, although she {99} had at one\r\ntime favored the Servian demand for an extensive revision of it.\r\nCertainly Dr. Daneff voiced the views and sentiments of the Bulgarian\r\narmy and nation.  I was in Sofia the week before the outbreak of the\r\nwar between the Allies.  And the two points on which everybody insisted\r\nwere, first, that Servia must be compelled to observe the Treaty of\r\nPartition, and, secondly, that Central Macedonia must be annexed to\r\nBulgaria.  For these things all Bulgarians were ready to fight.  And\r\nflushed with their great victories over the main army of Turkey they\r\nbelieved it would be an easy task to overpower the forces of Servia and\r\nGreece.  For the Greeks they entertained a sort of contempt; and as for\r\nthe Servians, had they not already defeated them completely at\r\nSlivnitza in 1886?  Men high in the military service of the nation\r\nassured me that the Bulgarian army would be in Belgrade in eight days\r\nafter war was declared.  The Greeks too would quickly be driven out of\r\nSaloniki.  The idea of {100} a conference to decide the territorial\r\nquestion in dispute between the Allies found no favor in any quarter.\r\n\r\nNow it is important that full justice should be done to Bulgaria.  As\r\nagainst Servia, if Servia had stood alone, she might have appealed to\r\nthe sanctity and inviolability of treaties.  Circumstances had indeed\r\nchanged since the treaty was negotiated.  But was that a good reason,\r\nBulgaria might have asked, why she should be excluded from Central\r\nMacedonia which the treaty guaranteed to her?  Was that a good reason\r\nwhy she should not emancipate her Macedonian brethren for whose sake\r\nshe had waged a bloody and costly war with Turkey?  The Bulgarians saw\r\nnothing in the problem but their treaty with Servia and apparently\r\ncared for no territorial compensation without Central Macedonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{101}\r\n\r\nBULGARIA'S UNCOMPROMISING POLICY\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarians were blind to all facts and considerations but the\r\nabstract terms of the treaty with Servia.  It was a fact, however, that\r\nthe war against Turkey had been fought by four Allies.  It was a fact\r\nthat the Ottoman government had ceded European Turkey (except Albania)\r\nto these four Allies.  No two of the Allies could divide between\r\nthemselves the common possession.  A division made by the four Allies\r\nmight contravene the terms of a treaty which existed between any two of\r\nthe Allies prior to the outbreak of the war.  In any event it was for\r\nthe four Allies together to effect a distribution of the territory\r\nceded to them by Turkey.  For that purpose a conference was an\r\nessential organ.  How otherwise could the four nations reach any\r\nagreement?  Yet the Bulgarians--army, government, and nation--were\r\nobsessed by the fixed idea that Bulgaria enjoyed not only a primacy in\r\nthis {102} matter but a sort of sovereign monopoly by virtue of which\r\nit was her right and privilege to determine how much of the common\r\nspoils she should assign Servia (with whom she had an ante-bellum\r\ntreaty), and, after Servia had been eliminated, how much she could\r\nspare to Greece (with whom no treaty of partition existed), and, when\r\nGreece had been disposed of, whether any crumbs could be flung to\r\nMontenegro, who had indeed very little to hope for from the Bulgarian\r\ngovernment.  And so Bulgaria opposed a conference of the four prime\r\nministers though a conference was the natural, obvious, and necessary\r\nmethod of disposing of the common business pressing upon them.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of Bulgaria left no alternative but war.  Yet the\r\nBulgarian government failed to reckon the cost of war.  Was it not\r\nmadness for Bulgaria to force war upon Greece, Servia, and Montenegro\r\non the west at a time when Roumania was making demands for territorial\r\ncompensation on the north and Turkey was {103} sure to seize the\r\noccasion to win back territory which Bulgaria had just wrested from her\r\non the south?  Never was a government blinder to the significant facts\r\nof a critical situation.  All circumstances conspired to prescribe\r\npeace as the manifest policy for Bulgaria, yet nearly every step taken\r\nby the government was provocative of war.  The Bulgarian army had\r\ncovered itself with glory in the victorious campaign against the\r\nMoslem.  A large part of European Turkey was already in Bulgarian\r\nhands.  To imperil that glory and those possessions by the risk of a\r\nnew war, when the country was exhausted and new enemies lay in wait,\r\nwas as foolish as it was criminal.  That way madness lay.  Yet that way\r\nthe policy pursued by the Bulgarian government infallibly led.  Must we\r\nassume that there is some ground for suspecting that Austria-Hungary\r\nwas inciting Bulgaria to war?  We must leave it to history to answer.\r\nIf the result was a terrible disaster, that was only the old Greek\r\nNemesis of the {104} gods for the outraged principles of reason and\r\nmoderation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONCILIATORY SPIRIT OF GREECE\r\n\r\nThose principles, thanks to the conciliatory spirit of Mr. Venizelos,\r\nthe prime minister, and the steady support of King Constantine, who was\r\nalso commander-in-chief, were loyally followed in Greece.  A few days\r\nafter the declaration of war against the Ottoman Empire, into which\r\nGreece was precipitately hastened by the unexpected action of Servia\r\nand Bulgaria, the Greek foreign minister addressed a communication to\r\nthe Allies on the subject of the division of conquered territory.  He\r\ntraced the line of Greek claims, as based on ethnological grounds, and\r\nadded that, as he foresaw difficulties in the way of a direct\r\nadjustment, he thought the disputed points should be submitted to\r\narbitration.  But months followed months without bringing from Bulgaria\r\nany clear reply to this just and reasonable proposal of the Greek {105}\r\ngovernment.  Nevertheless, Mr. Venizelos persisted in his attitude of\r\nconciliation toward Bulgaria.  He made concessions, not only in Thrace\r\nbut in Eastern Macedonia, for which he was bitterly criticized on the\r\nground of sacrificing vital Greek interests to Bulgaria.  He\r\nrecognized, as his critics refused to do, that the Balkan question\r\ncould not be settled on ethnological principles alone; one had to take\r\naccount also of geographical necessities.  He saw that the Greeks in\r\nThrace must be handed over to Bulgaria.  He demanded only the\r\nMacedonian territory which the Greek forces had actually occupied,\r\nincluding Saloniki with an adequate hinterland.  As the attitude of\r\nBulgaria became more uncompromising, as she pushed her army of\r\noccupation further westward, Mr. Venizelos was even ready to make the\r\nRiver Struma the eastern boundary of New Greece, and to abandon to\r\nBulgaria the Aegean littoral between the Struma and the Mesta Rivers\r\nincluding Greek cities like Kavala, {106} Seres, and Drama.  But these\r\nnew concessions of Mr. Venizelos were in danger of alienating from him\r\nthe support of the Greek nation without yielding anything in return\r\nfrom Bulgaria.  The outbreak of the war between the Allies saved him\r\nfrom a difficult political position.  Yet against that war Mr.\r\nVenizelos strove resolutely to the end.  And when in despite of all his\r\nefforts war came, he was justified in saying, as he did say to the\r\nnational parliament, that the Greeks had the right to present\r\nthemselves before the civilized world with head erect because this new\r\nwar which was bathing with blood the Balkan Peninsula had not been\r\nprovoked by Greece or brought about by the demand of Greece to receive\r\nsatisfaction for all her ethnological claims.  And this position in\r\nwhich he had placed his country was, he proudly declared, a \"moral\r\ncapital\" of the greatest value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{107}\r\n\r\nBULGARIA BEGINS HOSTILITIES\r\n\r\nBulgaria's belated acceptance of Russian arbitration was not destined\r\nto establish peace.  Yet Dr. Daneff, the prime minister, who received\r\nme on June 27 and talked freely of the Balkan situation (perhaps the\r\nmore freely because in this conversation it transpired that we had been\r\nfellow students together at the University of Heidelberg), decided on\r\nJune 28 not to go to war with the Allies.  Yet that very evening at\r\neight o'clock, unknown to Dr. Daneff, an order in cipher and marked\r\n\"very urgent\" was issued by General Savoff to the commander of the\r\nfourth army directing him on the following evening to attack the\r\nServians \"most vigorously along the whole front.\"  On the following\r\nafternoon, the 29th, General Savoff issued another order to the army\r\ncommanders giving further instructions for attacks on the Servians and\r\nGreeks, including an attack on Saloniki, stating that these attacks\r\nwere {108} taking place \"without any official declaration of war,\" and\r\nthat they were undertaken in order to accustom the Bulgarian army to\r\nregard their former allies as enemies, to hasten the activities of the\r\nRussian government, to compel the former allies to be more\r\nconciliatory, and to secure new territories for Bulgaria!  Who was\r\nresponsible for this deplorable lack of harmony between the civil\r\ngovernment and the military authorities has not yet been officially\r\ndisclosed.  Did General Savoff act on his own responsibility?  Or is\r\nthere any truth in the charge that King Ferdinand after a long\r\nconsultation with the Austro-Hungarian Minister instructed the General\r\nto issue the order?  Dr. Daneff knew nothing of it, and though he made\r\nevery effort to stop the resulting hostilities, the dogs of war had\r\nbeen let loose and could not now be torn from one another's throats.\r\n\r\nThere had been sporadic fighting in Macedonia between the Allies for\r\nsome months past.  Greece and Servia had concluded an anti-Bulgarian\r\n{109} alliance on June 1.  They also entered into a convention with\r\nRoumania by which that power agreed to intervene in case of war between\r\nthe late Allies.  And war having been declared, Roumania seized\r\nSilistria at midnight, July 10.  Meanwhile the Servian and Greek forces\r\nwere fighting the Bulgarians hard at Kilkis, Doiran, and other points\r\nbetween the Varclar and the Struma.  And, as if Bulgaria had not\r\nenemies enough on her back already, the Turkish Army on July 12 left\r\nthe Chataldja fortifications, crossed the Enos-Midia line, and in less\r\nthan two weeks, with Enver Bey at its head, re-occupied Adrianople.\r\nBulgaria was powerless to stop the further advance of the Turks, nor\r\nhad she forces to send against the Roumanians who marched unopposed\r\nthrough the neighboring country till Sofia itself was within their\r\npower.\r\n\r\nNo nation could stand up against such fearful odds.  Dr. Daneff\r\nresigned on July 15.  {110} And the new ministry had to make the best\r\nterms it could.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTERMS OF PEACE\r\n\r\nA Peace Conference met at Bukarest on July 28, and peace was signed on\r\nAugust 10.  By this Treaty of Bukarest Servia secured not only all that\r\npart of Macedonia already under her occupation but gained also an\r\neastward extension beyond the Doiran-Istib-Kochana line into purely\r\nBulgarian territory.  Greece fared still better under the treaty; for\r\nit gave her not only all the Macedonian lands she had already occupied\r\nbut extended her domain on the Aegean littoral as far east as the mouth\r\nof the Mesta and away into the interior as far above Seres and Drama as\r\nthey are from the sea,--thus establishing the northern frontier of New\r\nGreece from Lake Presba (near the eastern boundary of Albania) on a\r\nnorthward-ascending line past Ghevgheli and Doiran to Kainchal in\r\nThrace on the other {111} side of the Mesta River.  This assignment of\r\nterritory conquered from Turkey had the effect of shutting out Bulgaria\r\nfrom the Western Aegean; and the littoral left to Bulgaria between the\r\nMesta River and the Turkish boundary has no harbor of any consequence\r\nbut Dedeagach, which is much inferior to Kavala.\r\n\r\nThe new Turkish boundary was arranged by negotiations between the\r\nBulgarian and Ottoman governments.  The terminus on the Black Sea was\r\npushed north from Midia almost up to the southern boundary of Bulgaria.\r\nEnos remained the terminus on the Aegean.  But the two termini were\r\nconnected by a curved line which after following the Maritza River to a\r\npoint between Sufli and Dimotika then swung in a semicircle well beyond\r\nAdrianople to Bulgaria and the Black Sea.  Thus Bulgaria was compelled\r\nto cede back to the Asiatic enemy not only Adrianople but the\r\nbattlefields of Kirk Kilisse, Lule Burgas, and Chorlu on which {112}\r\nher brave soldiers had won such magnificent victories over the Moslems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ATTITUDE OF ROUMANIA\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Bukarest marked the predominance of Roumania in Balkan\r\naffairs.  And of course Roumania had her own reward.  She had long\r\ncoveted the northeastern corner of Bulgaria, from Turtukai on the\r\nDanube to Baltchik on the Black Sea.  And this territory, even some\r\nmiles beyond that line, Bulgaria was now compelled to cede to her by\r\nthe treaty.  It is a fertile area with a population of some 300,000\r\nsouls, many of whom are Turks.\r\n\r\nThe claim of Roumania to compensation for her neutrality during the\r\nfirst Balkan war was severely criticized by the independent press of\r\nwestern Europe.  It was first put forward in the London Peace\r\nConference, but rejected by Dr. Daneff, the Bulgarian delegate.  But\r\nthe Roumanian government persisted in pressing the claim, and the\r\nPowers finally decided to {113} mediate, with the result that the city\r\nof Silistria and the immediately adjoining territory were assigned to\r\nRoumania.  Neither state was satisfied with the award and the second\r\nBalkan war broke out before the transfer had been effected.  This gave\r\nRoumania the opportunity to enforce her original claim, and, despite\r\nthe advice of Austria-Hungary, she used it, as we have already seen.\r\n\r\nThe Roumanian government justifies its position in this matter by two\r\nconsiderations.  In the first place, as Roumania was larger and more\r\npopulous than any of the Balkan states, the Roumanian nation could not\r\nsit still with folded arms while Bulgaria wrested this pre-eminence\r\nfrom her.  And if Bulgaria had not precipitated a war among the Allies,\r\nif she had been content with annexing the portion of European Turkey\r\nwhich she held under military occupation, New Bulgaria would have\r\ncontained a greater area and a larger population than Roumania.  The\r\nRoumanians claim, {114} accordingly, that the course they pursued was\r\ndictated by a legitimate and vital national interest.  And, in the\r\nsecond place, as Greeks, Servians, and Bulgarians based their\r\nrespective claims to Macedonian territory on the racial character of\r\nthe inhabitants, Roumania asserted that the presence of a large\r\nRoumanian (or Vlach) population in that disputed region gave her an\r\nequally valid claim to a share in the common estate.\r\n\r\nIn all Macedonia there may be some 100,000 Vlachs, though Roumanian\r\nofficials put the number much higher.  Many of them are highland\r\nshepherds; others engage in transportation with trains of horses or\r\nmules; those in the lowlands are good farmers.  They are found\r\nespecially in the mountains and valleys between Thessaly and Albania.\r\nThey are generally favorable to the Greek cause.  Most of them speak\r\nGreek as well as Roumanian; and they are all devoted members of the\r\nGreek Orthodox Church.  Yet there has been a Roumanian {115} propaganda\r\nin Macedonia since 1886, and the government at Bukarest has devoted\r\nlarge sums to the maintenance of Roumanian schools, of which the\r\nmaximum number at any time has perhaps not exceeded forty.\r\n\r\nNow if every other nation--Greek, Servian, Bulgarian--which had\r\nhitherto maintained its propaganda of schools and churches in\r\nMacedonia, was to bring its now emancipated children under the benign\r\nsway of the home government and also was to annex the Macedonian lands\r\nwhich they occupied, why, Roumania asked, should she be excluded from\r\nparticipation in the arrangement?  She did not, it is true, join the\r\nAllies in fighting the common Moslem oppressor.  But she maintained a\r\nbenevolent neutrality.  And since Macedonia is not conterminous with\r\nRoumania, she was not seeking to annex any portion of it.  Yet the\r\nrights those Roumanians in Macedonia gave her should be satisfied.  And\r\nso arguing, the Roumanian government claimed as a _quid pro {116} quo_\r\nthe adjoining northeastern corner of Bulgaria, permitting Bulgaria to\r\nrecoup herself by the uncontested annexation of Thrace and Eastern\r\nMacedonia.\r\n\r\nSuch was the Roumanian reasoning.  Certainly it bore hard on Bulgaria.\r\nBut none of the belligerents showed any mercy on Bulgaria.  War is a\r\ngame of ruthless self-interest.  It was Bulgaria who appealed to arms\r\nand she now had to pay the penalty.  Her losses enriched all her\r\nneighbors.  What Lord Bacon says of individuals is still more true of\r\nnations: the folly of one is the fortune of another, and none prospers\r\nso suddenly as by others' errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORK AND REWARD OF MONTENEGRO\r\n\r\nI have already sufficiently described the territorial gains of\r\nRoumania, Servia, and Greece.  But I must not pass over Montenegro in\r\nsilence.  As the invincible warriors of King Nicholas opened the war\r\nagainst the Ottoman Empire, so they joined Servia and Greece in the\r\nstruggle {117} against Bulgaria.  On Sunday, June 29, I saw encamped\r\nacross the street from my hotel in Uskub 15,000 of these Montenegrin\r\nsoldiers who had arrived only a day or two before by train from\r\nMitrowitza, into which they had marched across Novi Bazar.  Tall,\r\nlithe, daring, with countenances bespeaking clean lives, they looked as\r\nfine a body of men as one could find anywhere in the world, and their\r\ncommanding figures and manly bearing were set off to great advantage by\r\ntheir striking and picturesque uniforms.  The officers told me next day\r\nthat in a few hours they would be fighting at Ghevgheli.  Their\r\nsplendid appearance seemed an augury of victory for the Serbs.\r\n\r\nMontenegro too received her reward by an extension of territory on the\r\nsouth to the frontier of Albania (as fixed by the Great Powers) and a\r\nstill more liberal extension on the east in the sandjak of Novi Bazar.\r\nThis patriarchal kingdom will probably remain unchanged so long as the\r\npresent King lives, {118} the much-beloved King Nicholas, a genuinely\r\nHomeric Father of his People.  But forces of an economic, social, and\r\npolitical character are already at work tending to draw it into closer\r\nunion with Servia, and the Balkan wars have given a great impetus to\r\nthese forces.  A united Serb state, with an Adriatic littoral which\r\nwould include the harbors of Antivari and Dulcigno, may be the future\r\nwhich destiny has in store for the sister kingdoms of Servia and\r\nMontenegro.  If so, it is likely to be a mutually voluntary union; and\r\nneither Austria-Hungary nor Italy, the warders of the Adriatic, would\r\nseem to have any good ground to object to such a purely domestic\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM OF ALBANIA\r\n\r\nThe Albanians, though they rather opposed than assisted the Allies in\r\nthe war against Turkey, were set off as an independent nation by the\r\nGreat Powers at the instigation of Austria-Hungary with the support of\r\nItaly.  The {119} determination of the boundaries of the new state was\r\nthe resultant of conflicting forces in operation in the European\r\nconcert.  On the north while Scutari was retained for Albania through\r\nthe insistence of Austria-Hungary, Russian influence was strong enough\r\nto secure the Albanian centres of Ipek and Djakova and Prisrend, as\r\nwell as Dibra on the east, for the allied Serb states.  This was a sort\r\nof compensation to Servia for her loss of an Adriatic outlet at a time\r\nwhen the war between the Allies, which was destined so greatly to\r\nextend her territories, was not foreseen.  But while in this way\r\nAlbanians were excluded from the new state on the north and east, an\r\nincongruous compensation was afforded it on the south by an\r\nunjustifiable extension into northern Epirus, whose population is\r\nprevailingly Greek.\r\n\r\nThe location of the boundary between Albania and New Greece was forced\r\nupon the Great Powers by the stand of Italy.  During the first war the\r\nGreeks had occupied Epirus or southern {120} Albania as far north as a\r\nline drawn from a point a little above Khimara on the coast due east\r\ntoward Lake Presba, so that the cities of Tepeleni and Koritza were\r\nincluded in the Greek area.  But Italy protested that the Greek\r\noccupation of territory on both sides of the Straits of Corfu would\r\nmenace the control of the Adriatic and insisted that the boundary\r\nbetween Albania and Greece should start from a point on the coast\r\nopposite the southern part of the island of Corfu.  Greece,\r\naccordingly, was compelled to evacuate most of the territory she had\r\noccupied above Janina.  And Albania subsequently attempted to assert\r\nher jurisdiction over it.\r\n\r\nBut the task of Albania is bound to be difficult.  For though the Great\r\nPowers have provided it with a ruler--the German Prince William of\r\nWied--there is no organized state.  The Albanians are one of the oldest\r\nraces in Europe, if not the oldest.  But they have never created a\r\nstate.  And to-day they are hopelessly {121} divided.  It is a land of\r\nuniversal opposition--north against south, tribe against tribe, bey\r\nagainst bey.  The majority of the population are Mohammedan but there\r\nare many Roman Catholics in the north and in the south the Greek\r\nOrthodox Church is predominant.  The inhabitants of the north, who are\r\ncalled Ghegs, are divided into numerous tribes whose principal\r\noccupation is fighting with one another under a system of perpetual\r\nblood-feuds and inextinguishable vendettas.  There are no tribes in the\r\nsouth, but the people, who are known as Tosks, live under territorial\r\nmagnates called beys, who are practically the absolute rulers of their\r\ndistricts.  The country as a whole is a strange farrago of survivals of\r\nprimitive conditions.  And it is not only without art and literature,\r\nbut without manufactures or trade or even agriculture.  It is little\r\nwonder that the Greeks of Epirus feel outraged by the destiny which the\r\nEuropean Powers have imposed upon them--to be torn {122} from their own\r\ncivilized and Christian kindred and subjected to the sway of the\r\nbarbarous Mohammedans who occupy Albania.  Nor is it surprising that\r\nsince Hellenic armies have evacuated northern Epirus in conformity with\r\nthe decree of the Great Powers, the inhabitants of the district, all\r\nthe way from Santi Quaranta to Koritza, are declaring their\r\nindependence and fighting the Albanians who attempt to bring them under\r\nthe yoke.\r\n\r\nThe future of Albania is full of uncertainty.  The State, however, was\r\nnot created for the Albanians, who for the rest, are not in a condition\r\nto administer or maintain it.  The state was established in the\r\ninterests of Austria-Hungary and Italy.  And those powers are likely to\r\nshape its future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AEGEAN ISLANDS AND CRETE\r\n\r\nFor the sacrifice demanded of Greece in Epirus the Great Powers\r\npermitted her by way of compensation to retain all the Aegean Islands\r\n{123} occupied by her during the war, except Imbros, Tenedos, and the\r\nRabbit Islands at the mouth of the Dardanelles.  These islands,\r\nhowever, Greece is never to fortify or convert into naval bases.  This\r\nallotment of the Asiatic Islands (which includes all but Rhodes and the\r\nDodecanese, temporarily held by Italy as a pledge of the evacuation of\r\nLibya by the Turkish officers and troops) has given great\r\ndissatisfaction in Turkey, where it is declared it would be better to\r\nhave a war with Greece than cede certain islands especially Chios and\r\nMitylene.  The question of the disposition of the islands had, however,\r\nbeen committed by Turkey to the Great Powers in the Treaty of London.\r\nAnd Turkish unofficial condemnation of the action of the Powers now\r\ncreates a dangerous situation.  Mr. Venizelos declared not long ago,\r\nwith the enthusiastic approval of the chamber, that the security of\r\nGreece lay alone in the possession of a strong navy.\r\n\r\nFor Mr. Venizelos personally nothing in all {124} these great events\r\ncan have been more gratifying than the achievement of the union of\r\nCrete with Greece.  This was consummated on December 14, when the Greek\r\nflag was hoisted on Canea Fort in the presence of King Constantine, the\r\nprime minister, and the consuls of the Great Powers, and saluted with\r\n101 guns by the Greek fleet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKING CONSTANTINE\r\n\r\nFortune in an extraordinary degree has favored the King of the\r\nHellenes--Fortune and his own wise head and valiant arm and the loyal\r\nsupport of his people.  When before has a Prince taken supreme command\r\nof a nation's army and in the few months preceding and succeeding his\r\naccession to the throne by successful generalship doubled the area and\r\npopulation of his country?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map: The Balkan Peninsula after the Wars of 1912-1913.]\r\n\r\n\r\n{125}\r\n\r\nCOST OF THE WAR\r\n\r\nThe Balkan wars have been bloody and costly.  We shall never know of\r\nthe thousands of men, women, and children who died from privation,\r\ndisease, and massacre.  But the losses of the dead and wounded in the\r\narmies were for Montenegro 11,200, for Greece 68,000, for Servia\r\n71,000, for Bulgaria 156,000, and for Turkey about the same as for\r\nBulgaria.  The losses in treasure were as colossal as in blood.  Only\r\nrough computations are possible.  But the direct military expenditures\r\nare estimated at figures varying from a billion and a quarter to a\r\nbillion and a half of dollars.  This of course takes no account of the\r\nparalysis of productive industry, trade, and commerce or of the\r\ndestruction of existing economic values.\r\n\r\nYet great and momentous results have been achieved.  Although seated\r\nagain in his ancient capital of Adrianople, the Moslem has been\r\nexpelled from Europe, or at any rate is no {126} longer a European\r\nPower.  For the first time in more than five centuries, therefore,\r\nconditions of stable equilibrium are now possible for the Christian\r\nnations of the Balkans.  Whether the present alignment of those states\r\ntoward one another and towards the Great Powers is destined to continue\r\nit would be foolhardy to attempt to predict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE OF THE BALKANS\r\n\r\nBut without pretending to cast a horoscope, certain significant facts\r\nmay be mentioned in a concluding word.  If the Balkan states are left\r\nto themselves, if they are permitted to settle their own affairs\r\nwithout the intervention of the Great Powers, there is no reason why\r\nthe existing relations between Greece, Servia, Montenegro, and\r\nRoumania, founded as they are on mutual interest, should not continue;\r\nand if they continue, peace will be assured in spite of Bulgaria's cry\r\nfor revenge and readjustment.  The danger lies in the influence of the\r\n{127} Great Powers with their varying attractions and repulsions.\r\nFrance, Germany, and Great Britain, disconnected with the Balkans and\r\nremote from them, are not likely to exert much direct individual\r\ninfluence.  But their connections with the Triple Alliance and the\r\nTriple Entente would not leave them altogether free to take isolated\r\naction.  And two other members of those European groups--Russia and\r\nAustria-Hungary--have long been vitally interested in the Balkan\r\nquestion; while the opposition to Servian annexation on the Adriatic\r\nlittoral and of Greek annexation in Epirus now for the first time\r\nreveals the deep concern of Italy in the same question.\r\n\r\nThe Serbs are Slavs.  And the unhappy relations between Servia and\r\nAustria-Hungary have always intensified their pro-Russian proclivities.\r\nThe Roumanians are a Romance people, like the French and Italians, and\r\nthey have hitherto been regarded as a Balkan extension of the Triple\r\nAlliance.  The attitude of {128} Austria-Hungary, however, during the\r\nBalkan wars has caused a cooling of Roumanian friendship, so that its\r\ntransference to Russia is no longer inconceivable or even improbable.\r\nGreece desires to be independent of both groups of the European system,\r\nbut the action of Italy in regard to Northern Epirus and in regard to\r\nRhodes and the Dodecanese has produced a feeling of irritation and\r\nresentment among the Greeks which nothing is likely to allay or even\r\ngreatly alleviate.  Bulgaria in the past has carried her desire to live\r\nan independent national life to the point of hostility to Russia, but\r\nsince Stambuloff's time she has shown more natural sentiments towards\r\nher great Slav sister and liberator.  Whether the desire of revenge\r\nagainst Servia (and Greece) will once more draw her toward\r\nAustria-Hungary only time can disclose.\r\n\r\nIn any event it will take a long time for all the Balkan states to\r\nrecover from the terrible exhaustion of the two wars of 1912 and 1913.\r\n{129} Their financial resources have been depleted; their male\r\npopulation has been decimated.  Necessity, therefore, is likely to\r\nco-operate with the community of interest established by the Treaty of\r\nBukarest in the maintenance of conditions of stable equilibrium in the\r\nBalkans.  Of course the peace-compelling forces operative in the Balkan\r\nstates themselves might be counter-acted by hostile activities on the\r\npart of some of the Great Powers.  And there is one danger-point for\r\nwhich the Great Powers themselves are solely responsible.  This, as I\r\nhave already explained, is Albania.  An artificial creation with\r\nunnatural boundaries, it is a grave question whether this so-called\r\nstate can either manage its own affairs or live in peace with its Serb\r\nand Greek neighbors.  At this moment the Greeks of Epirus (whom the\r\nGreat Powers have transferred to Albania) are resisting to the death\r\nincorporation in a state which outrages their deepest and holiest\r\nsentiments of religion, race, nationality, and humane {130}\r\ncivilization.  On the other hand the Hoti and Gruda tribes on the north\r\nfiercely resent annexation to Montenegro (which the Great Powers have\r\ndecreed) and threaten to summon to their support other Malissori tribes\r\nwith whom they have had a defensive alliance for several centuries.  If\r\nPrince William of Wied is unable to cope with these difficulties, Italy\r\nand Austria-Hungary may think it necessary to intervene in Albania.\r\nBut the intervention of either would almost certainly provoke\r\ncompensatory action on the part of other European Powers, especially\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nOne can only hope that the Great Powers may have wisdom granted to them\r\nto find a peaceful solution of the embarrassing problem which they have\r\ncreated in setting up the new state of Albania.  That the Albanians\r\nthemselves will have an opportunity to develop their own national\r\nindependence I find it impossible to believe.  Yet I heard in the\r\nsummer of 1913 at Valona from the lips of Ismail Kemal Bey, {131} the\r\nhead of the provisional government, a most impressive statement of his\r\nhopes and aspirations for an independent Albania and his faith and\r\nconfidence in its future, in which he claimed to voice the sentiments\r\nof the Albanian people.  But, as I have already explained, I think it\r\ndoubtful whether under the most favorable external circumstances the\r\nAlbanians are at present qualified to establish and maintain an\r\nindependent state.  And their destiny is so inextricably entangled with\r\nthe ambitions of some of the Great Powers that the experiment stands no\r\nchance of getting a fair trial.  I heartily wish the circumstances were\r\nother than they are.  For as an American I sympathize with the\r\naspirations of all struggling nationalities to be free and independent.\r\nAnd my interest in Albania is deepened, as the interest of all\r\nAmericans must be deepened, by the fact that a large number of\r\nAlbanians have now found a home in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{133}\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAbdul Hamid II, misgovernment, 32.\r\n\r\nAdrianople, capture by Murad I, 4; left to Turkey, 9, 25; holds out\r\nagainst Bulgaria, 56; _sine qua non_ at Peace Conference, 57; captured,\r\n57; question of retention of, 58; reoccupied by Turkish army, 109;\r\nceded back to Turkey, 111.\r\n\r\nAdriatic, question of supremacy over, 68.\r\n\r\nAegean Islands, Greece takes, 52; left to decision of Powers, 59; given\r\nto Greece, 122.\r\n\r\nAlbania, Montenegrins, 53; to be left to Powers, 59; cause of friction,\r\n67; problem of, 118; given a ruler, 120; danger-point of the Balkans,\r\n129; northern tribes oppose absorption by Montenegro, 130; future of,\r\n131.\r\n\r\nAlexander, Prince, of Bulgaria, 27.\r\n\r\nArea, see under countries.\r\n\r\nAsen brothers, free Bulgaria, 10.\r\n\r\nAthens, recaptured, 22.\r\n\r\nAustria, discusses division of Turkey, 7; given Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\n27; intervenes in Macedonia, 33; demands independent Albania, 67, 118;\r\nopposes Servia, 68; dislikes Slav hegemony, 97; interests in Balkans,\r\n127.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBalkan Alliance, see Balkan states.\r\n\r\nBalkan states, quarrel, 11; peninsula under Moslems, 13; massacres in,\r\n25; large part of peninsula lost to Turkey, 27; dissensions among, 60;\r\nalliance, 34; rival ambitions among, 64; treaty restrictions, 72;\r\ncauses of war between, 75; previous fighting between, 108; make peace,\r\n110; future, 126.\r\n\r\nBalkan wars, cause of first war, 30; cause of second war, 64; division\r\nof fighting, 54; cost, 125.
