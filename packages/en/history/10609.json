(Heidelberg)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO\r\nMY FRIEND\r\nC H T\r\nIN GRATITUDE FOR\r\nHIS CONTINUED HELP IN THE\r\nPREPARATION OF\r\nTHIS BOOK\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nThis book, which presents the whole splendid history of English literature\r\nfrom Anglo-Saxon times to the close of the Victorian Era, has three\r\nspecific aims. The first is to create or to encourage in every student the\r\ndesire to read the best books, and to know literature itself rather than\r\nwhat has been written about literature. The second is to interpret\r\nliterature both personally and historically, that is, to show how a great\r\nbook generally reflects not only the author's life and thought but also the\r\nspirit of the age and the ideals of the nation's history. The third aim is\r\nto show, by a study of each successive period, how our literature has\r\nsteadily developed from its first simple songs and stories to its present\r\ncomplexity in prose and poetry.\r\n\r\nTo carry out these aims we have introduced the following features:\r\n\r\n(1) A brief, accurate summary of historical events and social conditions in\r\neach period, and a consideration of the ideals which stirred the whole\r\nnation, as in the days of Elizabeth, before they found expression in\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n(2) A study of the various literary epochs in turn, showing what each\r\ngained from the epoch preceding, and how each aided in the development of a\r\nnational literature.\r\n\r\n(3) A readable biography of every important writer, showing how he lived\r\nand worked, how he met success or failure, how he influenced his age, and\r\nhow his age influenced him.\r\n\r\n(4) A study and analysis of every author's best works, and of many of the\r\nbooks required for college-entrance examinations.\r\n\r\n(5) Selections enough--especially from earlier writers, and from writers\r\nnot likely to be found in the home or school library--to indicate the\r\nspirit of each author's work; and directions as to the best works to read,\r\nand where such works may be found in inexpensive editions.\r\n\r\n(6) A frank, untechnical discussion of each great writer's work as a whole,\r\nand a critical estimate of his relative place and influence in our\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n(7) A series of helps to students and teachers at the end of each chapter,\r\nincluding summaries, selections for reading, bibliographies, a list of\r\nsuggestive questions, and a chronological table of important events in the\r\nhistory and literature of each period.\r\n\r\n(8) Throughout this book we have remembered Roger Ascham's suggestion, made\r\nover three centuries ago and still pertinent, that \"'tis a poor way to make\r\na child love study by beginning with the things which he naturally\r\ndislikes.\" We have laid emphasis upon the delights of literature; we have\r\ntreated books not as mere instruments of research--which is the danger in\r\nmost of our studies--but rather as instruments of enjoyment and of\r\ninspiration; and by making our study as attractive as possible we have\r\nsought to encourage the student to read widely for himself, to choose the\r\nbest books, and to form his own judgment about what our first Anglo-Saxon\r\nwriters called \"the things worthy to be remembered.\"\r\n\r\nTo those who may use this book in their homes or in their class rooms, the\r\nwriter ventures to offer one or two friendly suggestions out of his own\r\nexperience as a teacher of young people. First, the amount of space here\r\ngiven to different periods and authors is not an index of the relative\r\namount of time to be spent upon the different subjects. Thus, to tell the\r\nstory of Spenser's life and ideals requires as much space as to tell the\r\nstory of Tennyson; but the average class will spend its time more\r\npleasantly and profitably with the latter poet than with the former.\r\nSecond, many authors who are and ought to be included in this history need\r\nnot be studied in the class room. A text-book is not a catechism but a\r\nstorehouse, in which one finds what he wants, and some good things beside.\r\nFew classes will find time to study Blake or Newman, for instance; but in\r\nnearly every class there will be found one or two students who are\r\nattracted by the mysticism of Blake or by the profound spirituality of\r\nNewman. Such students should be encouraged to follow their own spirits, and\r\nto share with their classmates the joy of their discoveries. And they\r\nshould find in their text-book the material for their own study and\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nA third suggestion relates to the method of teaching literature; and here\r\nit might be well to consider the word of a great poet,--that if you would\r\nknow where the ripest cherries are, ask the boys and the blackbirds. It is\r\nsurprising how much a young person will get out of the _Merchant of\r\nVenice_, and somehow arrive at Shakespeare's opinion of Shylock and Portia,\r\nif we do not bother him too much with notes and critical directions as to\r\nwhat he ought to seek and find. Turn a child and a donkey loose in the same\r\nfield, and the child heads straight for the beautiful spots where brooks\r\nare running and birds singing, while the donkey turns as naturally to weeds\r\nand thistles. In our study of literature we have perhaps too much sympathy\r\nwith the latter, and we even insist that the child come back from his own\r\nquest of the ideal to join us in our critical companionship. In reading\r\nmany text-books of late, and in visiting many class rooms, the writer has\r\nreceived the impression that we lay too much stress on second-hand\r\ncriticism, passed down from book to book; and we set our pupils to\r\nsearching for figures of speech and elements of style, as if the great\r\nbooks of the world were subject to chemical analysis. This seems to be a\r\nmistake, for two reasons: first, the average young person has no natural\r\ninterest in such matters; and second, he is unable to appreciate them. He\r\nfeels unconsciously with Chaucer:\r\n\r\n    And as for me, though that my wit be lytë,\r\n    On bookës for to rede I me delytë.\r\n\r\nIndeed, many mature persons (including the writer of this history) are\r\noften unable to explain at first the charm or the style of an author who\r\npleases them; and the more profound the impression made by a book, the more\r\ndifficult it is to give expression to our thought and feeling. To read and\r\nenjoy good books is with us, as with Chaucer, the main thing; to analyze\r\nthe author's style or explain our own enjoyment seems of secondary and\r\nsmall importance. However that may be, we state frankly our own conviction\r\nthat the detailed study and analysis of a few standard works--which is the\r\nonly literary pabulum given to many young people in our schools--bears the\r\nsame relation to true literature that theology bears to religion, or\r\npsychology to friendship. One is a more or less unwelcome mental\r\ndiscipline; the other is the joy of life.\r\n\r\nThe writer ventures to suggest, therefore, that, since literature is our\r\nsubject, we begin and end with good books; and that we stand aside while\r\nthe great writers speak their own message to our pupils. In studying each\r\nsuccessive period, let the student begin by reading the best that the age\r\nproduced; let him feel in his own way the power and mystery of _Beowulf_,\r\nthe broad charity of Shakespeare, the sublimity of Milton, the romantic\r\nenthusiasm of Scott; and then, when his own taste is pleased and satisfied,\r\na new one will arise,--to know something about the author, the times in\r\nwhich he lived, and finally of criticism, which, in its simplicity, is the\r\ndiscovery that the men and women of other ages were very much like\r\nourselves, loving as we love, bearing the same burdens, and following the\r\nsame ideals:\r\n\r\n    Lo, with the ancient\r\n    Roots of man's nature\r\n    Twines the eternal\r\n    Passion of song.\r\n    Ever Love fans it;\r\n    Ever Life feeds it;\r\n    Time cannot age it;\r\n    Death cannot slay.\r\n\r\nTo answer the questions which arise naturally between teacher and pupil\r\nconcerning the books that they read, is one object of this volume. It aims\r\nnot simply to instruct but also to inspire; to trace the historical\r\ndevelopment of English literature, and at the same time to allure its\r\nreaders to the best books and the best writers. And from beginning to end\r\nit is written upon the assumption that the first virtue of such a work is\r\nto be accurate, and the second to be interesting.\r\n\r\nThe author acknowledges, with gratitude and appreciation, his indebtedness\r\nto Professor William Lyon Phelps for the use of his literary map of\r\nEngland, and to the keen critics, teachers of literature and history, who\r\nhave read the proofs of this book, and have improved it by their good\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM J.

A child and a man were one day walking on the\r\nseashore when the child found a little shell and held it to his ear.\r\nSuddenly he heard sounds,--strange, low, melodious sounds, as if the shell\r\nwere remembering and repeating to itself the murmurs of its ocean home. The\r\nchild's face filled with wonder as he listened. Here in the little shell,\r\napparently, was a voice from another world, and he listened with delight to\r\nits mystery and music. Then came the man, explaining that the child heard\r\nnothing strange; that the pearly curves of the shell simply caught a\r\nmultitude of sounds too faint for human ears, and filled the glimmering\r\nhollows with the murmur of innumerable echoes. It was not a new world, but\r\nonly the unnoticed harmony of the old that had aroused the child's wonder.\r\n\r\nSome such experience as this awaits us when we begin the study of\r\nliterature, which has always two aspects, one of simple enjoyment and\r\nappreciation, the other of analysis and exact description. Let a little\r\nsong appeal to the ear, or a noble book to the heart, and for the moment,\r\nat least, we discover a new world, a world so different from our own that\r\nit seems a place of dreams and magic. To enter and enjoy this new world, to\r\nlove good books for their own sake, is the chief thing; to analyze and\r\nexplain them is a less joyous but still an important matter. Behind every\r\nbook is a man; behind the man is the race; and behind the race are the\r\nnatural and social environments whose influence is unconsciously reflected.\r\nThese also we must know, if the book is to speak its whole message. In a\r\nword, we have now reached a point where we wish to understand as well as to\r\nenjoy literature; and the first step, since exact definition is impossible,\r\nis to determine some of its essential qualities.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES OF LITERATURE. The first significant thing is the essentially\r\nartistic quality of all literature. All art is the expression of life in\r\nforms of truth and beauty; or rather, it is the reflection of some truth\r\nand beauty which are in the world, but which remain unnoticed until brought\r\nto our attention by some sensitive human soul, just as the delicate curves\r\nof the shell reflect sounds and harmonies too faint to be otherwise\r\nnoticed. A hundred men may pass a hayfield and see only the sweaty toil and\r\nthe windrows of dried grass; but here is one who pauses by a Roumanian\r\nmeadow, where girls are making hay and singing as they work. He looks\r\ndeeper, sees truth and beauty where we see only dead grass, and he reflects\r\nwhat he sees in a little poem in which the hay tells its own story:\r\n\r\n      Yesterday's flowers am I,\r\n    And I have drunk my last sweet draught of dew.\r\n    Young maidens came and sang me to my death;\r\n    The moon looks down and sees me in my shroud,\r\n      The shroud of my last dew.\r\n    Yesterday's flowers that are yet in me\r\n    Must needs make way for all to-morrow's flowers.\r\n    The maidens, too, that sang me to my death\r\n    Must even so make way for all the maids\r\n      That are to come.\r\n    And as my soul, so too their soul will be\r\n    Laden with fragrance of the days gone by.\r\n    The maidens that to-morrow come this way\r\n    Will not remember that I once did bloom,\r\n    For they will only see the new-born flowers.\r\n    Yet will my perfume-laden soul bring back,\r\n    As a sweet memory, to women's hearts\r\n        Their days of maidenhood.\r\n    And then they will be sorry that they came\r\n        To sing me to my death;\r\n    And all the butterflies will mourn for me.\r\n        I bear away with me\r\n    The sunshine's dear remembrance, and the low\r\n        Soft murmurs of the spring.\r\n    My breath is sweet as children's prattle is;\r\n    I drank in all the whole earth's fruitfulness,\r\n    To make of it the fragrance of my soul\r\n      That shall outlive my death.[1]\r\n\r\nOne who reads only that first exquisite line, \"Yesterday's flowers am I,\"\r\ncan never again see hay without recalling the beauty that was hidden from\r\nhis eyes until the poet found it.\r\n\r\nIn the same pleasing, surprising way, all artistic work must be a kind of\r\nrevelation. Thus architecture is probably the oldest of the arts; yet we\r\nstill have many builders but few architects, that is, men whose work in\r\nwood or stone suggests some hidden truth and beauty to the human senses. So\r\nin literature, which is the art that expresses life in words that appeal to\r\nour own sense of the beautiful, we have many writers but few artists. In\r\nthe broadest sense, perhaps, literature means simply the written records of\r\nthe race, including all its history and sciences, as well as its poems and\r\nnovels; in the narrower sense literature is the artistic record of life,\r\nand most of our writing is excluded from it, just as the mass of our\r\nbuildings, mere shelters from storm and from cold, are excluded from\r\narchitecture. A history or a work of science may be and sometimes is\r\nliterature, but only as we forget the subject-matter and the presentation\r\nof facts in the simple beauty of its expression.\r\n\r\nThe second quality of literature is its suggestiveness, its appeal to our\r\nemotions and imagination rather than to our intellect. It is not so much\r\nwhat it says as what it awakens in us that constitutes its charm. When\r\nMilton makes Satan say, \"Myself am Hell,\" he does not state any fact, but\r\nrather opens up in these three tremendous words a whole world of\r\nspeculation and imagination. When Faustus in the presence of Helen asks,\r\n\"Was this the face that launched a thousand ships?\" he does not state a\r\nfact or expect an answer. He opens a door through which our imagination\r\nenters a new world, a world of music, love, beauty, heroism,--the whole\r\nsplendid world of Greek literature. Such magic is in words. When\r\nShakespeare describes the young Biron as speaking\r\n\r\n        In such apt and gracious words\r\n    That aged ears play truant at his tales,\r\n\r\nhe has unconsciously given not only an excellent description of himself,\r\nbut the measure of all literature, which makes us play truant with the\r\npresent world and run away to live awhile in the pleasant realm of fancy.\r\nThe province of all art is not to instruct but to delight; and only as\r\nliterature delights us, causing each reader to build in his own soul that\r\n\"lordly pleasure house\" of which Tennyson dreamed in his \"Palace of Art,\"\r\nis it worthy of its name.\r\n\r\nThe third characteristic of literature, arising directly from the other\r\ntwo, is its permanence. The world does not live by bread alone.\r\nNotwithstanding its hurry and bustle and apparent absorption in material\r\nthings, it does not willingly let any beautiful thing perish. This is even\r\nmore true of its songs than of its painting and sculpture; though\r\npermanence is a quality we should hardly expect in the present deluge of\r\nbooks and magazines pouring day and night from our presses in the name of\r\nliterature. But this problem of too many books is not modern, as we\r\nsuppose. It has been a problem ever since Caxton brought the first printing\r\npress from Flanders, four hundred years ago, and in the shadow of\r\nWestminster Abbey opened his little shop and advertised his wares as \"good\r\nand chepe.\" Even earlier, a thousand years before Caxton and his printing\r\npress, the busy scholars of the great library of Alexandria found that the\r\nnumber of parchments was much too great for them to handle; and now, when\r\nwe print more in a week than all the Alexandrian scholars could copy in a\r\ncentury, it would seem impossible that any production could be permanent;\r\nthat any song or story could live to give delight in future ages. But\r\nliterature is like a river in flood, which gradually purifies itself in two\r\nways,--the mud settles to the bottom, and the scum rises to the top. When\r\nwe examine the writings that by common consent constitute our literature,\r\nthe clear stream purified of its dross, we find at least two more\r\nqualities, which we call the tests of literature, and which determine its\r\npermanence.\r\n\r\nTESTS OF LITERATURE. The first of these is universality, that is, the\r\nappeal to the widest human interests and the simplest human emotions.\r\nThough we speak of national and race literatures, like the Greek or\r\nTeutonic, and though each has certain superficial marks arising out of the\r\npeculiarities of its own people, it is nevertheless true that good\r\nliterature knows no nationality, nor any bounds save those of humanity. It\r\nis occupied chiefly with elementary passions and emotions,--love and hate,\r\njoy and sorrow, fear and faith,--which are an essential part of our human\r\nnature; and the more it reflects these emotions the more surely does it\r\nawaken a response in men of every race. Every father must respond to the\r\nparable of the prodigal son; wherever men are heroic, they will acknowledge\r\nthe mastery of Homer; wherever a man thinks on the strange phenomenon of\r\nevil in the world, he will find his own thoughts in the Book of Job; in\r\nwhatever place men love their children, their hearts must be stirred by the\r\ntragic sorrow of _Oedipus_ and _King Lear_. All these are but shining\r\nexamples of the law that only as a book or a little song appeals to\r\nuniversal human interest does it become permanent.\r\n\r\nThe second test is a purely personal one, and may be expressed in the\r\nindefinite word \"style.\" It is only in a mechanical sense that style is\r\n\"the adequate expression of thought,\" or \"the peculiar manner of expressing\r\nthought,\" or any other of the definitions that are found in the rhetorics.\r\nIn a deeper sense, style is the man, that is, the unconscious expression of\r\nthe writer's own personality. It is the very soul of one man reflecting, as\r\nin a glass, the thoughts and feelings of humanity. As no glass is\r\ncolorless, but tinges more or less deeply the reflections from its surface,\r\nso no author can interpret human life without unconsciously giving to it\r\nthe native hue of his own soul. It is this intensely personal element that\r\nconstitutes style. Every permanent book has more or less of these two\r\nelements, the objective and the subjective, the universal and the personal,\r\nthe deep thought and feeling of the race reflected and colored by the\r\nwriter's own life and experience.\r\n\r\nTHE OBJECT IN STUDYING LITERATURE. Aside from the pleasure of reading, of\r\nentering into a new world and having our imagination quickened, the study\r\nof literature has one definite object, and that is to know men. Now man is\r\never a dual creature; he has an outward and an inner nature; he is not only\r\na doer of deeds, but a dreamer of dreams; and to know him, the man of any\r\nage, we must search deeper than his history. History records his deeds, his\r\noutward acts largely; but every great act springs from an ideal, and to\r\nunderstand this we must read his literature, where we find his ideals\r\nrecorded. When we read a history of the Anglo-Saxons, for instance, we\r\nlearn that they were sea rovers, pirates, explorers, great eaters and\r\ndrinkers; and we know something of their hovels and habits, and the lands\r\nwhich they harried and plundered. All that is interesting; but it does not\r\ntell us what most we want to know about these old ancestors of ours,--not\r\nonly what they did, but what they thought and felt; how they looked on life\r\nand death; what they loved, what they feared, and what they reverenced in\r\nGod and man. Then we turn from history to the literature which they\r\nthemselves produced, and instantly we become acquainted. These hardy people\r\nwere not simply fighters and freebooters; they were men like ourselves;\r\ntheir emotions awaken instant response in the souls of their descendants.\r\nAt the words of their gleemen we thrill again to their wild love of freedom\r\nand the open sea; we grow tender at their love of home, and patriotic at\r\ntheir deathless loyalty to their chief, whom they chose for themselves and\r\nhoisted on their shields in symbol of his leadership. Once more we grow\r\nrespectful in the presence of pure womanhood, or melancholy before the\r\nsorrows and problems of life, or humbly confident, looking up to the God\r\nwhom they dared to call the Allfather. All these and many more intensely\r\nreal emotions pass through our souls as we read the few shining fragments\r\nof verses that the jealous ages have left us.\r\n\r\nIt is so with any age or people. To understand them we must read not simply\r\ntheir history, which records their deeds, but their literature, which\r\nrecords the dreams that made their deeds possible. So Aristotle was\r\nprofoundly right when he said that \"poetry is more serious and\r\nphilosophical than history\"; and Goethe, when he explained literature as\r\n\"the humanization of the whole world.\"\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF LITERATURE. It is a curious and prevalent opinion that\r\nliterature, like all art, is a mere play of imagination, pleasing enough,\r\nlike a new novel, but without any serious or practical importance. Nothing\r\ncould be farther from the truth. Literature preserves the ideals of a\r\npeople; and ideals--love, faith, duty, friendship, freedom, reverence--are\r\nthe part of human life most worthy of preservation. The Greeks were a\r\nmarvelous people; yet of all their mighty works we cherish only a few\r\nideals,--ideals of beauty in perishable stone, and ideals of truth in\r\nimperishable prose and poetry. It was simply the ideals of the Greeks and\r\nHebrews and Romans, preserved in their literature, which made them what\r\nthey were, and which determined their value to future generations. Our\r\ndemocracy, the boast of all English-speaking nations, is a dream; not the\r\ndoubtful and sometimes disheartening spectacle presented in our legislative\r\nhalls, but the lovely and immortal ideal of a free and equal manhood,\r\npreserved as a most precious heritage in every great literature from the\r\nGreeks to the Anglo-Saxons. All our arts, our sciences, even our inventions\r\nare founded squarely upon ideals; for under every invention is still the\r\ndream of _Beowulf_, that man may overcome the forces of nature; and the\r\nfoundation of all our sciences and discoveries is the immortal dream that\r\nmen \"shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\"\r\n\r\nIn a word, our whole civilization, our freedom, our progress, our homes,\r\nour religion, rest solidly upon ideals for their foundation. Nothing but an\r\nideal ever endures upon earth. It is therefore impossible to overestimate\r\nthe practical importance of literature, which preserves these ideals from\r\nfathers to sons, while men, cities, governments, civilizations, vanish from\r\nthe face of the earth. It is only when we remember this that we appreciate\r\nthe action of the devout Mussulman, who picks up and carefully preserves\r\nevery scrap of paper on which words are written, because the scrap may\r\nperchance contain the name of Allah, and the ideal is too enormously\r\nimportant to be neglected or lost.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE SUBJECT. We are now ready, if not to define, at least to\r\nunderstand a little more clearly the object of our present study.\r\nLiterature is the expression of life in words of truth and beauty; it is\r\nthe written record of man's spirit, of his thoughts, emotions, aspirations;\r\nit is the history, and the only history, of the human soul. It is\r\ncharacterized by its artistic, its suggestive, its permanent qualities. Its\r\ntwo tests are its universal interest and its personal style. Its object,\r\naside from the delight it gives us, is to know man, that is, the soul of\r\nman rather than his actions; and since it preserves to the race the ideals\r\nupon which all our civilization is founded, it is one of the most important\r\nand delightful subjects that can occupy the human mind.\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY.

OUR FIRST POETRY\r\n\r\nBEOWULF. Here is the story of Beowulf, the earliest and the greatest epic,\r\nor heroic poem, in our literature. It begins with a prologue, which is not\r\nan essential part of the story, but which we review gladly for the sake of\r\nthe splendid poetical conception that produced Scyld, king of the Spear\r\nDanes.[2]\r\n\r\nAt a time when the Spear Danes were without a king, a ship came sailing\r\ninto their harbor. It was filled with treasures and weapons of war; and in\r\nthe midst of these warlike things was a baby sleeping. No man sailed the\r\nship; it came of itself, bringing the child, whose name was Scyld.\r\n\r\nNow Scyld grew and became a mighty warrior, and led the Spear Danes for\r\nmany years, and was their king. When his son Beowulf[3] had become strong\r\nand wise enough to rule, then Wyrd (Fate), who speaks but once to any man,\r\ncame and stood at hand; and it was time for Scyld to go. This is how they\r\nburied him:\r\n\r\n    Then Scyld departed, at word of Wyrd spoken,\r\n    The hero to go to the home of the gods.\r\n    Sadly they bore him to brink of the ocean,\r\n    Comrades, still heeding his word of command.\r\n    There rode in the harbor the prince's ship, ready,\r\n    With prow curving proudly and shining sails set.\r\n    Shipward they bore him, their hero beloved;\r\n    The mighty they laid at the foot of the mast.\r\n    Treasures were there from far and near gathered,\r\n    Byrnies of battle, armor and swords;\r\n    Never a keel sailed out of a harbor\r\n    So splendidly tricked with the trappings of war.\r\n    They heaped on his bosom a hoard of bright jewels\r\n    To fare with him forth on the flood's great breast.\r\n    No less gift they gave than the Unknown provided,\r\n    When alone, as a child, he came in from the mere.\r\n    High o'er his head waved a bright golden standard--\r\n    Now let the waves bear their wealth to the holm.\r\n    Sad-souled they gave back its gift to the ocean,\r\n    Mournful their mood as he sailed out to sea.[4]\r\n\r\n\"And no man,\" says the poet, \"neither counselor nor hero, can tell who\r\nreceived that lading.\"\r\n\r\nOne of Scyld's descendants was Hrothgar, king of the Danes; and with him\r\nthe story of our Beowulf begins. Hrothgar in his old age had built near the\r\nsea a mead hall called Heorot, the most splendid hall in the whole world,\r\nwhere the king and his thanes gathered nightly to feast and to listen to\r\nthe songs of his gleemen. One night, as they were all sleeping, a frightful\r\nmonster, Grendel, broke into the hall, killed thirty of the sleeping\r\nwarriors, and carried off their bodies to devour them in his lair under the\r\nsea. The appalling visit was speedily repeated, and fear and death reigned\r\nin the great hall. The warriors fought at first; but fled when they\r\ndiscovered that no weapon could harm the monster. Heorot was left deserted\r\nand silent. For twelve winters Grendel's horrible raids continued, and joy\r\nwas changed to mourning among the Spear Danes.\r\n\r\nAt last the rumor of Grendel crossed over the sea to the land of the Geats,\r\nwhere a young hero dwelt in the house of his uncle, King Hygelac. Beowulf\r\nwas his name, a man of immense strength and courage, and a mighty swimmer\r\nwho had developed his powers fighting the \"nickers,\" whales, walruses and\r\nseals, in the icebound northern ocean. When he heard the story, Beowulf was\r\nstirred to go and fight the monster and free the Danes, who were his\r\nfather's friends.\r\n\r\nWith fourteen companions he crosses the sea. There is an excellent bit of\r\nocean poetry here (ll. 210-224), and we get a vivid idea of the hospitality\r\nof a brave people by following the poet's description of Beowulf's meeting\r\nwith King Hrothgar and Queen Wealhtheow, and of the joy and feasting and\r\nstory-telling in Heorot. The picture of Wealhtheow passing the mead cup to\r\nthe warriors with her own hand is a noble one, and plainly indicates the\r\nreverence paid by these strong men to their wives and mothers. Night comes\r\non; the fear of Grendel is again upon the Danes, and all withdraw after the\r\nking has warned Beowulf of the frightful danger of sleeping in the hall.\r\nBut Beowulf lies down with his warriors, saying proudly that, since weapons\r\nwill not avail against the monster, he will grapple with him bare handed\r\nand trust to a warrior's strength.\r\n\r\n    Forth from the fens, from the misty moorlands,\r\n    Grendel came gliding--God's wrath[5] he bore--\r\n    Came under clouds, until he saw clearly,\r\n    Glittering with gold plates, the mead hall of men.\r\n    Down fell the door, though fastened with fire bands;\r\n    Open it sprang at the stroke of his paw.\r\n    Swollen with rage burst in the bale-bringer;\r\n    Flamed in his eyes a fierce light, likest fire.[6]\r\n\r\nAt the sight of men again sleeping in the hall, Grendel laughs in his\r\nheart, thinking of his feast. He seizes the nearest sleeper, crushes his\r\n\"bone case\" with a bite, tears him limb from limb, and swallows him. Then\r\nhe creeps to the couch of Beowulf and stretches out a claw, only to find it\r\nclutched in a grip of steel. A sudden terror strikes the monster's heart.\r\nHe roars, struggles, tries to jerk his arm free; but Beowulf leaps to his\r\nfeet and grapples his enemy bare handed. To and fro they surge. Tables are\r\noverturned; golden benches ripped from their fastenings; the whole building\r\nquakes, and only its iron bands keep it from falling to pieces. Beowulf's\r\ncompanions are on their feet now, hacking vainly at the monster with swords\r\nand battle-axes, adding their shouts to the crashing of furniture and the\r\nhowling \"war song\" of Grendel. Outside in the town the Danes stand\r\nshivering at the uproar. Slowly the monster struggles to the door, dragging\r\nBeowulf, whose fingers crack with the strain, but who never relaxes his\r\nfirst grip. Suddenly a wide wound opens in the monster's side; the sinews\r\nsnap; the whole arm is wrenched off at the shoulder; and Grendel escapes\r\nshrieking across the moor, and plunges into the sea to die.\r\n\r\nBeowulf first exults in his night's work; then he hangs the huge arm with\r\nits terrible claws from a cross-beam over the king's seat, as one would\r\nhang up a bear's skin after a hunt. At daylight came the Danes; and all day\r\nlong, in the intervals of singing, story-telling, speech making, and gift\r\ngiving, they return to wonder at the mighty \"grip of Grendel\" and to\r\nrejoice in Beowulf's victory.\r\n\r\nWhen night falls a great feast is spread in Heorot, and the Danes sleep\r\nonce more in the great hall. At midnight comes another monster, a horrible,\r\nhalf-human creature,[7] mother of Grendel, raging to avenge her offspring.\r\nShe thunders at the door; the Danes leap up and grasp their weapons; but\r\nthe monster enters, seizes Aeschere, who is friend and adviser of the king,\r\nand rushes away with him over the fens.\r\n\r\nThe old scenes of sorrow are reviewed in the morning; but Beowulf says\r\nsimply:\r\n\r\n    Sorrow not, wise man. It is better for each\r\n    That his friend he avenge than that he mourn much.\r\n    Each of us shall the end await\r\n    Of worldly life: let him who may gain\r\n    Honor ere death. That is for a warrior,\r\n    When he is dead, afterwards best.\r\n    Arise, kingdom's guardian! Let us quickly go\r\n    To view the track of Grendel's kinsman.\r\n    I promise it thee: he will not escape,\r\n    Nor in earth's bosom, nor in mountain-wood,\r\n    Nor in ocean's depths, go where he will.[8]\r\n\r\nThen he girds himself for the new fight and follows the track of the second\r\nenemy across the fens. Here is Hrothgar's description of the place where\r\nlive the monsters, \"spirits of elsewhere,\" as he calls them:\r\n\r\n                    They inhabit\r\n    The dim land that gives shelter to the wolf,\r\n    The windy headlands, perilous fen paths,\r\n    Where, under mountain mist, the stream flows down\r\n    And floods the ground. Not far hence, but a mile,\r\n    The mere stands, over which hang death-chill groves,\r\n    A wood fast-rooted overshades the flood;\r\n    There every night a ghastly miracle\r\n    Is seen, fire in the water. No man knows,\r\n    Not the most wise, the bottom of that mere.\r\n    The firm-horned heath-stalker, the hart, when pressed,\r\n    Wearied by hounds, and hunted from afar,\r\n    Will rather die of thirst upon its bank\r\n    Than bend his head to it. It is unholy.\r\n    Dark to the clouds its yeasty waves mount up\r\n    When wind stirs hateful tempest, till the air\r\n    Grows dreary, and the heavens pour down tears.[9]\r\n\r\nBeowulf plunges into the horrible place, while his companions wait for him\r\noh the shore. For a long time he sinks through the flood; then, as he\r\nreaches bottom, Grendel's mother rushes out upon him and drags him into a\r\ncave, where sea monsters swarm at him from behind and gnash his armor with\r\ntheir tusks. The edge of his sword is turned with the mighty blow he deals\r\nthe _merewif_; but it harms not the monster. Casting the weapon aside, he\r\ngrips her and tries to hurl her down, while her claws and teeth clash upon\r\nhis corslet but cannot penetrate the steel rings. She throws her bulk upon\r\nhim, crushes him down, draws a short sword and plunges it at him; but again\r\nhis splendid byrnie saves him. He is wearied now, and oppressed. Suddenly,\r\nas his eye sweeps the cave, he catches sight of a magic sword, made by the\r\ngiants long ago, too heavy for warriors to wield. Struggling up he seizes\r\nthe weapon, whirls it and brings down a crashing blow upon the monster's\r\nneck. It smashes through the ring bones; the _merewif_ falls, and the fight\r\nis won.\r\n\r\nThe cave is full of treasures; but Beowulf heeds them not, for near him\r\nlies Grendel, dead from the wound received the previous night. Again\r\nBeowulf swings the great sword and strikes off his enemy's head; and lo, as\r\nthe venomous blood touches the sword blade, the steel melts like ice before\r\nthe fire, and only the hilt is left in Beowulf's hand. Taking the hilt and\r\nthe head, the hero enters the ocean and mounts up to the shore.\r\n\r\nOnly his own faithful band were waiting there; for the Danes, seeing the\r\nocean bubble with fresh blood, thought it was all over with the hero and\r\nhad gone home. And there they were, mourning in Heorot, when Beowulf\r\nreturned with the monstrous head of Grendel carried on a spear shaft by\r\nfour of his stoutest followers.\r\n\r\nIn the last part of the poem there is another great fight. Beowulf is now\r\nan old man; he has reigned for fifty years, beloved by all his people. He\r\nhas overcome every enemy but one, a fire dragon keeping watch over an\r\nenormous treasure hidden among the mountains. One day a wanderer stumbles\r\nupon the enchanted cave and, entering, takes a jeweled cup while the\r\nfiredrake sleeps heavily. That same night the dragon, in a frightful rage,\r\nbelching forth fire and smoke, rushes down upon the nearest villages,\r\nleaving a trail of death and terror behind him.\r\n\r\nAgain Beowulf goes forth to champion his people. As he approaches the\r\ndragon's cave, he has a presentiment that death lurks within:\r\n\r\n    Sat on the headland there the warrior king;\r\n    Farewell he said to hearth-companions true,\r\n    The gold-friend of the Geats; his mind was sad,\r\n    Death-ready, restless. And Wyrd was drawing nigh,\r\n    Who now must meet and touch the aged man,\r\n    To seek the treasure that his soul had saved\r\n    And separate his body from his life.[10]\r\n\r\nThere is a flash of illumination, like that which comes to a dying man, in\r\nwhich his mind runs back over his long life and sees something of profound\r\nmeaning in the elemental sorrow moving side by side with magnificent\r\ncourage. Then follows the fight with the firedrake, in which Beowulf,\r\nwrapped in fire and smoke, is helped by the heroism of Wiglaf, one of his\r\ncompanions. The dragon is slain, but the fire has entered Beowulf's lungs\r\nand he knows that Wyrd is at hand. This is his thought, while Wiglaf\r\nremoves his battered armor:\r\n\r\n    \"One deep regret I have: that to a son\r\n    I may not give the armor I have worn,\r\n    To bear it after me. For fifty years\r\n    I ruled these people well, and not a king\r\n    Of those who dwell around me, dared oppress\r\n    Or meet me with his hosts. At home I waited\r\n    For the time that Wyrd controls. Mine own I kept,\r\n    Nor quarrels sought, nor ever falsely swore.\r\n    Now, wounded sore, I wait for joy to come.\"[11]\r\n\r\nHe sends Wiglaf into the firedrake's cave, who finds it filled with rare\r\ntreasures and, most wonderful of all, a golden banner from which light\r\nproceeds and illumines all the darkness. But Wiglaf cares little for the\r\ntreasures; his mind is full of his dying chief. He fills his hands with\r\ncostly ornaments and hurries to throw them at his hero's feet. The old man\r\nlooks with sorrow at the gold, thanks the \"Lord of all\" that by death he\r\nhas gained more riches for his people, and tells his faithful thane how his\r\nbody shall be burned on the Whale ness, or headland:\r\n\r\n    \"My life is well paid for this hoard; and now\r\n    Care for the people's needs. I may no more\r\n    Be with them. Bid the warriors raise a barrow\r\n    After the burning, on the ness by the sea,\r\n    On Hronesness, which shall rise high and be\r\n    For a remembrance to my people. Seafarers\r\n    Who from afar over the mists of waters\r\n    Drive foamy keels may call it Beowulf's Mount\r\n    Hereafter.\" Then the hero from his neck\r\n    Put off a golden collar; to his thane,\r\n    To the young warrior, gave it with his helm,\r\n    Armlet and corslet; bade him use them well.\r\n    \"Thou art the last Waegmunding of our race,\r\n    For fate has swept my kinsmen all away.\r\n    Earls in their strength are to their Maker gone,\r\n    And I must follow them.\"[12]\r\n\r\nBeowulf was still living when Wiglaf sent a messenger hurriedly to his\r\npeople; when they came they found him dead, and the huge dragon dead on the\r\nsand beside him.\r\n\r\n    Then the Goth's people reared a mighty pile\r\n    With shields and armour hung, as he had asked,\r\n    And in the midst the warriors laid their lord,\r\n    Lamenting. Then the warriors on the mount\r\n    Kindled a mighty bale fire; the smoke rose\r\n    Black from the Swedish pine, the sound of flame\r\n    Mingled with sound of weeping; ... while smoke\r\n    Spread over heaven. Then upon the hill\r\n    The people of the Weders wrought a mound,\r\n    High, broad, and to be seen far out at sea.\r\n    In ten days they had built and walled it in\r\n    As the wise thought most worthy; placed in it\r\n    Rings, jewels, other treasures from the hoard.\r\n    They left the riches, golden joy of earls,\r\n    In dust, for earth to hold; where yet it lies,\r\n    Useless as ever. Then about the mound\r\n    The warriors rode, and raised a mournful song\r\n    For their dead king; exalted his brave deeds,\r\n    Holding it fit men honour their liege lord,\r\n    Praise him and love him when his soul is fled.\r\n    Thus the [Geat's] people, sharers of his hearth,\r\n    Mourned their chief's fall, praised him, of kings, of men\r\n    The mildest and the kindest, and to all\r\n    His people gentlest, yearning for their praise.[13]\r\n\r\nOne is tempted to linger over the details of the magnificent ending: the\r\nunselfish heroism of Beowulf, the great prototype of King Alfred; the\r\ngenerous grief of his people, ignoring gold and jewels in the thought of\r\nthe greater treasure they had lost; the memorial mound on the low cliff,\r\nwhich would cause every returning mariner to steer a straight course to\r\nharbor in the remembrance of his dead hero; and the pure poetry which marks\r\nevery noble line. But the epic is great enough and simple enough to speak\r\nfor itself. Search the literatures of the world, and you will find no other\r\nsuch picture of a brave man's death.\r\n\r\nConcerning the history of _Beowulf_ a whole library has been written, and\r\nscholars still differ too radically for us to express a positive judgment.\r\nThis much, however, is clear,--that there existed, at the time the poem was\r\ncomposed, various northern legends of Beowa, a half-divine hero, and the\r\nmonster Grendel. The latter has been interpreted in various\r\nways,--sometimes as a bear, and again as the malaria of the marsh lands.\r\nFor those interested in symbols the simplest interpretation of these myths\r\nis to regard Beowulf's successive fights with the three dragons as the\r\novercoming, first, of the overwhelming danger of the sea, which was beaten\r\nback by the dykes; second, the conquering of the sea itself, when men\r\nlearned to sail upon it; and third, the conflict with the hostile forces of\r\nnature, which are overcome at last by man's indomitable will and\r\nperseverance.\r\n\r\nAll this is purely mythical; but there are historical incidents to reckon\r\nwith. About the year 520 a certain northern chief, called by the chronicler\r\nChochilaicus (who is generally identified with the Hygelac of the epic),\r\nled a huge plundering expedition up the Rhine. After a succession of\r\nbattles he was overcome by the Franks, but--and now we enter a legendary\r\nregion once more--not until a gigantic nephew of Hygelac had performed\r\nheroic feats of valor, and had saved the remnants of the host by a\r\nmarvelous feat of swimming. The majority of scholars now hold that these\r\nhistorical events and personages were celebrated in the epic; but some\r\nstill assert that the events which gave a foundation for _Beowulf_ occurred\r\nwholly on English soil, where the poem itself was undoubtedly written.\r\n\r\nThe rhythm of _Beowulf_ and indeed of all our earliest poetry depended upon\r\naccent and alliteration; that is, the beginning of two or more words in the\r\nsame line with the same sound or letter. The lines were made up of two\r\nshort halves, separated by a pause. No rime was used; but a musical effect\r\nwas produced by giving each half line two strongly accented syllables. Each\r\nfull line, therefore, had four accents, three of which (i.e. two in the\r\nfirst half, and one in the second) usually began with the same sound or\r\nletter. The musical effect was heightened by the harp with which the\r\ngleeman accompanied his singing.. The poetical form will be seen clearly in\r\nthe following selection from the wonderfully realistic description of the\r\nfens haunted by Grendel. It will need only one or two readings aloud to\r\nshow that many of these strange-looking words are practically the same as\r\nthose we still use, though many of the vowel sounds were pronounced\r\ndifferently by our ancestors.\r\n\r\n                              ... Hie dygel lond\r\n    Warigeath, wulf-hleothu,     windige næssas,\r\n      Frecne fen-gelad,      thær fyrgen-stream\r\n    Under næssa genipu     nither gewiteth,\r\n    Flod under foldan.     Nis thæt feor heonon,\r\n    Mil-gemearces,     thaet se mere standeth,\r\n    Ofer thæm hongiath     hrinde bearwas\r\n                     ... They (a) darksome land\r\n    Ward (inhabit), wolf cliffs,     windy nesses,\r\n    Frightful fen paths     where mountain stream\r\n    Under nesses' mists     nether (downward) wanders,\r\n    A flood under earth.     It is not far hence,\r\n    By mile measure,     that the mere stands,\r\n    Over which hang     rimy groves.\r\n\r\nWIDSITH. The poem \"Widsith,\" the wide goer or wanderer, is in part, at\r\nleast, probably the oldest in our language. The author and the date of its\r\ncomposition are unknown; but the personal account of the minstrel's life\r\nbelongs to the time before the Saxons first came to England.[14] It\r\nexpresses the wandering life of the gleeman, who goes forth into the world\r\nto abide here or there, according as he is rewarded for his singing. From\r\nthe numerous references to rings and rewards, and from the praise given to\r\ngenerous givers, it would seem that literature as a paying profession began\r\nvery early in our history, and also that the pay was barely sufficient to\r\nhold soul and body together. Of all our modern poets, Goldsmith wandering\r\nover Europe paying for his lodging with his songs is most suggestive of\r\nthis first recorded singer of our race. His last lines read:\r\n\r\n    Thus wandering, they who shape songs for men\r\n    Pass over many lands, and tell their need,\r\n    And speak their thanks, and ever, south or north,\r\n    Meet someone skilled in songs and free in gifts,\r\n    Who would be raised among his friends to fame\r\n    And do brave deeds till light and life are gone.\r\n    He who has thus wrought himself praise shall have\r\n    A settled glory underneath the stars.[15]\r\n\r\nDEOR'S LAMENT. In \"Deor\" we have another picture of the Saxon scop, or\r\nminstrel, not in glad wandering, but in manly sorrow. It seems that the\r\nscop's living depended entirely upon his power to please his chief, and\r\nthat at any time he might be supplanted by a better poet. Deor had this\r\nexperience, and comforts himself in a grim way by recalling various\r\nexamples of men who have suffered more than himself. The poem is arranged\r\nin strophes, each one telling of some afflicted hero and ending with the\r\nsame refrain: _His sorrow passed away; so will mine_. \"Deor\" is much more\r\npoetic than \"Widsith,\" and is the one perfect lyric[16] of the Anglo-Saxon\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n    Weland for a woman knew too well exile.\r\n    Strong of soul that earl, sorrow sharp he bore;\r\n    To companionship he had care and weary longing,\r\n    Winter-freezing wretchedness. Woe he found again, again,\r\n    After that Nithhad in a need had laid him--\r\n    Staggering sinew-wounds--sorrow-smitten man!\r\n    _That he overwent; this also may I_.[17]\r\n\r\nTHE SEAFARER. The wonderful poem of \"The Seafarer\" seems to be in two\r\ndistinct parts. The first shows the hardships of ocean life; but stronger\r\nthan hardships is the subtle call of the sea. The second part is an\r\nallegory, in which the troubles of the seaman are symbols of the troubles\r\nof this life, and the call of the ocean is the call in the soul to be up\r\nand away to its true home with God. Whether the last was added by some monk\r\nwho saw the allegorical possibilities of the first part, or whether some\r\nsea-loving Christian scop wrote both, is uncertain. Following are a few\r\nselected lines to show the spirit of the poem:\r\n\r\n    The hail flew in showers about me; and there I heard only\r\n    The roar of the sea, ice-cold waves, and the song of the swan;\r\n    For pastime the gannets' cry served me; the kittiwakes' chatter\r\n    For laughter of men; and for mead drink the call of the sea mews.\r\n    When storms on the rocky cliffs beat, then the terns, icy-feathered,\r\n    Made answer; full oft the sea eagle forebodingly screamed,\r\n    The eagle with pinions wave-wet....\r\n    The shadows of night became darker, it snowed from the north;\r\n    The world was enchained by the frost; hail fell upon earth;\r\n    'T was the coldest of grain. Yet the thoughts of my heart now are throbbing\r\n    To test the high streams, the salt waves in tumultuous play.\r\n    Desire in my heart ever urges my spirit to wander,\r\n    To seek out the home of the stranger in lands afar off.\r\n      There is no one that dwells upon earth, so exalted in mind,\r\n    But that he has always a longing, a sea-faring passion\r\n    For what the Lord God shall bestow, be it honor or death.\r\n    No heart for the harp has he, nor for acceptance of treasure,\r\n    No pleasure has he in a wife, no delight in the world,\r\n    Nor in aught save the roll of the billows; but always a longing,\r\n    A yearning uneasiness, hastens him on to the sea.\r\n      The woodlands are captured by blossoms, the hamlets grow fair,\r\n    Broad meadows are beautiful, earth again bursts into life,\r\n    And all stir the heart of the wanderer eager to journey,\r\n    So he meditates going afar on the pathway of tides.\r\n    The cuckoo, moreover, gives warning with sorrowful note,\r\n    Summer's harbinger sings, and forebodes to the heart bitter sorrow.\r\n      Now my spirit uneasily turns in the heart's narrow chamber,\r\n    Now wanders forth over the tide, o'er the home of the whale,\r\n    To the ends of the earth--and comes back to me.\r\n      Eager and greedy,\r\n    The lone wanderer screams, and resistlessly drives my soul onward,\r\n    Over the whale-path, over the tracts of the sea.[18]\r\n\r\nTHE FIGHT AT FINNSBURGH AND WALDERE. Two other of our oldest poems well\r\ndeserve mention. The \"Fight at Finnsburgh\" is a fragment of fifty lines,\r\ndiscovered on the inside of a piece of parchment drawn over the wooden\r\ncovers of a book of homilies. It is a magnificent war song, describing with\r\nHomeric power the defense of a hall by Hnæf[19] with sixty warriors,\r\nagainst the attack of Finn and his army. At midnight, when Hnæf and his men\r\nare sleeping, they are surrounded by an army rushing in with fire and\r\nsword. Hnæf springs to his feet at the first alarm and wakens his warriors\r\nwith a call to action that rings like a bugle blast:\r\n\r\n    This no eastward dawning is, nor is here a dragon flying,\r\n    Nor of this high hall are the horns a burning;\r\n    But they rush upon us here--now the ravens sing,\r\n    Growling is the gray wolf, grim the war-wood rattles,\r\n    Shield to shaft is answering.[20]\r\n\r\nThe fight lasts five days, but the fragment ends before we learn the\r\noutcome: The same fight is celebrated by Hrothgar's gleeman at the feast in\r\nHeorot, after the slaying of Grendel.\r\n\r\n\"Waldere\" is a fragment of two leaves, from which we get only a glimpse of\r\nthe story of Waldere (Walter of Aquitaine) and his betrothed bride\r\nHildgund, who were hostages at the court of Attila. They escaped with a\r\ngreat treasure, and in crossing the mountains were attacked by Gunther and\r\nhis warriors, among whom was Walter's former comrade, Hagen. Walter fights\r\nthem all and escapes. The same story was written in Latin in the tenth\r\ncentury, and is also part of the old German _Nibelungenlied_. Though the\r\nsaga did not originate with the Anglo-Saxons, their version of it is the\r\noldest that has come down to us. The chief significance of these \"Waldere\"\r\nfragments lies in the evidence they afford that our ancestors were familiar\r\nwith the legends and poetry of other Germanic peoples.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. ANGLO-SAXON LIFE\r\n\r\nWe have now read some of our earliest records, and have been surprised,\r\nperhaps, that men who are generally described in the histories as savage\r\nfighters and freebooters could produce such excellent poetry. It is the\r\nobject of the study of all literature to make us better acquainted with\r\nmen,--not simply with their deeds, which is the function of history, but\r\nwith the dreams and ideals which underlie all their actions. So a reading\r\nof this early Anglo-Saxon poetry not only makes us acquainted, but also\r\nleads to a profound respect for the men who were our ancestors. Before we\r\nstudy more of their literature it is well to glance briefly at their life\r\nand language.\r\n\r\nTHE NAME Originally the name Anglo-Saxon denotes two of the three Germanic\r\ntribes,--Jutes, Angles, and Saxons,--who in the middle of the fifth\r\ncentury left their homes on the shores of the North Sea and the Baltic to\r\nconquer and colonize distant Britain. Angeln was the home of one tribe, and\r\nthe name still clings to the spot whence some of our forefathers sailed on\r\ntheir momentous voyage. The old Saxon word _angul_ or _ongul_ means a hook,\r\nand the English verb _angle_ is used invariably by Walton and older writers\r\nin the sense of fishing. We may still think, therefore, of the first Angles\r\nas hook-men, possibly because of their fishing, more probably because the\r\nshore where they lived, at the foot of the peninsula of Jutland, was bent\r\nin the shape of a fishhook. The name Saxon from _seax, sax_, a short sword,\r\nmeans the sword-man, and from the name we may judge something of the temper\r\nof the hardy fighters who preceded the Angles into Britain. The Angles were\r\nthe most numerous of the conquering tribes, and from them the new home was\r\ncalled Anglalond. By gradual changes this became first Englelond and then\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nMore than five hundred years after the landing of these tribes, and while\r\nthey called themselves Englishmen, we find the Latin writers of the Middle\r\nAges speaking of the inhabitants of Britain as _Anglisaxones_,--that is,\r\nSaxons of England,--to distinguish them from the Saxons of the Continent.\r\nIn the Latin charters of King Alfred the same name appears; but it is never\r\nseen or heard in his native speech. There he always speaks of his beloved\r\n\"Englelond\" and of his brave \"Englisc\" people. In the sixteenth century,\r\nwhen the old name of Englishmen clung to the new people resulting from the\r\nunion of Saxon and Norman, the name Anglo-Saxon was first used in the\r\nnational sense by the scholar Camden[21] in his _History of Britain_; and\r\nsince then it has been in general use among English writers. In recent\r\nyears the name has gained a wider significance, until it is now used to\r\ndenote a spirit rather than a nation, the brave, vigorous, enlarging spirit\r\nthat characterizes the English-speaking races everywhere, and that has\r\nalready put a broad belt of English law and English liberty around the\r\nwhole world.\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE. If the literature of a people springs directly out of its life,\r\nthen the stern, barbarous life of our Saxon forefathers would seem, at\r\nfirst glance, to promise little of good literature. Outwardly their life\r\nwas a constant hardship, a perpetual struggle against savage nature and\r\nsavage men. Behind them were gloomy forests inhabited by wild beasts and\r\nstill wilder men, and peopled in their imagination with dragons and evil\r\nshapes. In front of them, thundering at the very dikes for entrance, was\r\nthe treacherous North Sea, with its fogs and storms and ice, but with that\r\nindefinable call of the deep that all men hear who live long beneath its\r\ninfluence. Here they lived, a big, blond, powerful race, and hunted and\r\nfought and sailed, and drank and feasted when their labor was done. Almost\r\nthe first thing we notice about these big, fearless, childish men is that\r\nthey love the sea; and because they love it they hear and answer its call:\r\n\r\n    ... No delight has he in the world,\r\n    Nor in aught save the roll of the billows; but always a longing,\r\n    A yearning uneasiness, hastens him on to the sea.[22]\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, this love of the ocean finds expression in all their\r\npoetry. In _Beowulf_ alone there are fifteen names for the sea, from the\r\n_holm_, that is, the horizon sea, the \"upmounding,\" to the _brim_, which is\r\nthe ocean flinging its welter of sand and creamy foam upon the beach at\r\nyour feet. And the figures used to describe or glorify it--\"the swan road,\r\nthe whale path, the heaving battle plain\"--are almost as numerous. In all\r\ntheir poetry there is a magnificent sense of lordship over the wild sea\r\neven in its hour of tempest and fury:\r\n\r\n    Often it befalls us, on the ocean's highways,\r\n    In the boats our boatmen, when the storm is roaring,\r\n    Leap the billows over, on our stallions of the foam.[23]\r\n\r\nTHE INNER LIFE. A man's life is more than his work; his dream is ever\r\ngreater than his achievement; and literature reflects not so much man's\r\ndeed as the spirit which animates him; not the poor thing that he does, but\r\nrather the splendid thing that he ever hopes to do. In no place is this\r\nmore evident than in the age we are now studying. Those early sea kings\r\nwere a marvelous mixture of savagery and sentiment, of rough living and of\r\ndeep feeling, of splendid courage and the deep melancholy of men who know\r\ntheir limitations and have faced the unanswered problem of death. They were\r\nnot simply fearless freebooters who harried every coast in their war\r\ngalleys. If that were all, they would have no more history or literature\r\nthan the Barbary pirates, of whom the same thing could be said. These\r\nstrong fathers of ours were men of profound emotions. In all their fighting\r\nthe love of an untarnished glory was uppermost; and under the warrior's\r\nsavage exterior was hidden a great love of home and homely virtues, and a\r\nreverence for the one woman to whom he would presently return in triumph.\r\nSo when the wolf hunt was over, or the desperate fight was won, these\r\nmighty men would gather in the banquet hall, and lay their weapons aside\r\nwhere the open fire would flash upon them, and there listen to the songs of\r\nScop and Gleeman,--men who could put into adequate words the emotions and\r\naspirations that all men feel but that only a few can ever express:\r\n\r\n    Music and song where the heroes sat--\r\n    The glee-wood rang, a song uprose\r\n    When Hrothgar's scop gave the hall good cheer.[24]\r\n\r\nIt is this great and hidden life of the Anglo-Saxons that finds expression\r\nin all their literature. Briefly, it is summed up in five great\r\nprinciples,--their love of personal freedom, their responsiveness to\r\nnature, their religion, their reverence for womanhood, and their struggle\r\nfor glory as a ruling motive in every noble life.\r\n\r\nIn reading Anglo-Saxon poetry it is well to remember these five principles,\r\nfor they are like the little springs at the head of a great river,--clear,\r\npure springs of poetry, and out of them the best of our literature has\r\nalways flowed. Thus when we read,\r\n\r\n    Blast of the tempest--it aids our oars;\r\n    Rolling of thunder--it hurts us not;\r\n    Rush of the hurricane--bending its neck\r\n    To speed us whither our wills are bent,\r\n\r\nwe realize that these sea rovers had the spirit of kinship with the mighty\r\nlife of nature; and kinship with nature invariably expresses itself in\r\npoetry. Again, when we read,\r\n\r\n    Now hath the man\r\n    O'ercome his troubles. No pleasure does he lack,\r\n    Nor steeds, nor jewels, nor the joys of mead,\r\n    Nor any treasure that the earth can give,\r\n    O royal woman, if he have but thee,[25]\r\n\r\nwe know we are dealing with an essentially noble man, not a savage; we are\r\nface to face with that profound reverence for womanhood which inspires the\r\ngreater part of all good poetry, and we begin to honor as well as\r\nunderstand our ancestors. So in the matter of glory or honor; it was,\r\napparently, not the love of fighting, but rather the love of honor\r\nresulting from fighting well, which animated our forefathers in every\r\ncampaign. \"He was a man deserving of remembrance\" was the highest thing\r\nthat could be said of a dead warrior; and \"He is a man deserving of praise\"\r\nwas the highest tribute to the living. The whole secret of Beowulf's mighty\r\nlife is summed up in the last line, \"Ever yearning for his people's\r\npraise.\" So every tribe had its scop, or poet, more important than any\r\nwarrior, who put the deeds of its heroes into the expressive words that\r\nconstitute literature; and every banquet hall had its gleeman, who sang the\r\nscop's poetry in order that the deed and the man might be remembered.\r\nOriental peoples built monuments to perpetuate the memory of their dead;\r\nbut our ancestors made poems, which should live and stir men's souls long\r\nafter monuments of brick and stone had crumbled away. It is to this intense\r\nlove of glory and the desire to be remembered that we are indebted for\r\nAnglo-Saxon literature.\r\n\r\nOUR FIRST SPEECH. Our first recorded speech begins with the songs of\r\nWidsith and Deor, which the Anglo-Saxons may have brought with them when\r\nthey first conquered Britain. At first glance these songs in their native\r\ndress look strange as a foreign tongue; but when we examine them carefully\r\nwe find many words that have been familiar since childhood. We have seen\r\nthis in _Beowulf_; but in prose the resemblance of this old speech to our\r\nown is even more striking. Here, for instance, is a fragment of the simple\r\nstory of the conquest of Britain by our Anglo-Saxon ancestors:\r\n\r\nHer Hengest and Æsc his sunu gefuhton with Bryttas, on thaere\r\nstowe the is gecweden Creccanford, and thær ofslogon feower thusenda wera.\r\nAnd tha Bryttas tha forleton Cent-lond, and mid myclum ege flugon to\r\nLundenbyrig. (At this time Hengest and Aesc, his son, fought against the\r\nBritons at the place which is called Crayford and there slew four thousand\r\nmen. And then the Britons forsook Kentland, and with much fear fled to\r\nLondon town.)[26]\r\n\r\nThe reader who utters these words aloud a few times will speedily recognize\r\nhis own tongue, not simply in the words but also in the whole structure of\r\nthe sentences.\r\n\r\nFrom such records we see that our speech is Teutonic in its origin; and\r\nwhen we examine any Teutonic language we learn that it is only a branch of\r\nthe great Aryan or Indo-European family of languages. In life and language,\r\ntherefore, we are related first to the Teutonic races, and through them to\r\nall the nations of this Indo-European family, which, starting with enormous\r\nvigor from their original home (probably in central Europe)[27] spread\r\nsouthward and westward, driving out the native tribes and slowly developing\r\nthe mighty civilizations of India, Persia, Greece, Rome, and the wilder but\r\nmore vigorous life of the Celts and Teutons. In all these\r\nlanguages--Sanskrit, Iranian, Greek, Latin, Celtic, Teutonic--we recognize\r\nthe same root words for father and mother, for God and man, for the common\r\nneeds and the common relations of life; and since words are windows through\r\nwhich we see the soul of this old people, we find certain ideals of love,\r\nhome, faith, heroism, liberty, which seem to have been the very life of our\r\nforefathers, and which were inherited by them from their old heroic and\r\nconquering ancestors. It was on the borders of the North Sea that our\r\nfathers halted for unnumbered centuries on their westward journey, and\r\nslowly developed the national life and language which we now call Anglo-\r\nSaxon.\r\n\r\nIt is this old vigorous Anglo-Saxon language which forms the basis of our\r\nmodern English. If we read a paragraph from any good English book, and then\r\nanalyze it, as we would a flower, to see what it contains, we find two\r\ndistinct classes of words. The first class, containing simple words\r\nexpressing the common things of life, makes up the strong framework of our\r\nlanguage. These words are like the stem and bare branches of a mighty oak,\r\nand if we look them up in the dictionary we find that almost invariably\r\nthey come to us from our Anglo-Saxon ancestors. The second and larger class\r\nof words is made up of those that give grace, variety, ornament, to our\r\nspeech. They are like the leaves and blossoms of the same tree, and when we\r\nexamine their history we find that they come to us from the Celts, Romans,\r\nNormans, and other peoples with whom we have been in contact in the long\r\nyears of our development. The most prominent characteristic of our present\r\nlanguage, therefore, is its dual character. Its best qualities--strength,\r\nsimplicity, directness--come from Anglo-Saxon sources; its enormous added\r\nwealth of expression, its comprehensiveness, its plastic adaptability to\r\nnew conditions and ideas, are largely the result of additions from other\r\nlanguages, and especially of its gradual absorption of the French language\r\nafter the Norman Conquest. It is this dual character, this combination of\r\nnative and foreign, of innate and exotic elements, which accounts for the\r\nwealth of our English language and literature. To see it in concrete form,\r\nwe should read in succession _Beowulf_ and _Paradise Lost_, the two great\r\nepics which show the root and the flower of our literary development.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. CHRISTIAN WRITERS OF THE ANGLO-SAXON PERIOD\r\n\r\nThe literature of this period falls naturally into two divisions,--pagan\r\nand Christian. The former represents the poetry which the Anglo-Saxons\r\nprobably brought with them in the form of oral sagas,--the crude material\r\nout of which literature was slowly developed on English soil; the latter\r\nrepresents the writings developed under teaching of the monks, after the\r\nold pagan religion had vanished, but while it still retained its hold on\r\nthe life and language of the people. In reading our earliest poetry it is\r\nwell to remember that all of it was copied by the monks, and seems to have\r\nbeen more or less altered to give it a religious coloring.\r\n\r\nThe coming of Christianity meant not simply a new life and leader for\r\nEngland; it meant also the wealth of a new language. The scop is now\r\nreplaced by the literary monk; and that monk, though he lives among common\r\npeople and speaks with the English tongue, has behind him all the culture\r\nand literary resources of the Latin language. The effect is seen instantly\r\nin our early prose and poetry.\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBRIAN LITERATURE. In general, two great schools of Christian\r\ninfluence came into England, and speedily put an end to the frightful wars\r\nthat had waged continually among the various petty kingdoms of the\r\nAnglo-Saxons. The first of these, under the leadership of Augustine, came\r\nfrom Rome. It spread in the south and center of England, especially in the\r\nkingdom of Essex. It founded schools and partially educated the rough\r\npeople, but it produced no lasting literature. The other, under the\r\nleadership of the saintly Aidan, came from Ireland, which country had been\r\nfor centuries a center of religion and education for all western Europe.\r\nThe monks of this school labored chiefly in Northumbria, and to their\r\ninfluence we owe all that is best in Anglo-Saxon literature. It is called\r\nthe Northumbrian School; its center was the monasteries and abbeys, such as\r\nJarrow and Whitby, and its three greatest names are Bede, Cædmon, and\r\nCynewulf.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEDE (673-735)\r\n\r\nThe Venerable Bede, as he is generally called, our first great scholar and\r\n\"the father of our English learning,\" wrote almost exclusively in Latin,\r\nhis last work, the translation of the Gospel of John into Anglo-Saxon,\r\nhaving been unfortunately lost. Much to our regret, therefore, his books\r\nand the story of his gentle, heroic life must be excluded from this history\r\nof our literature. His works, over forty in number, covered the whole field\r\nof human knowledge in his day, and were so admirably written that they were\r\nwidely copied as text-books, or rather manuscripts, in nearly all the\r\nmonastery schools of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe work most important to us is the _Ecclesiastical History of the English\r\nPeople_. It is a fascinating history to read even now, with its curious\r\ncombination of accurate scholarship and immense credulity. In all strictly\r\nhistorical matters Bede is a model. Every known authority on the subject,\r\nfrom Pliny to Gildas, was carefully considered; every learned pilgrim to\r\nRome was commissioned by Bede to ransack the archives and to make copies of\r\npapal decrees and royal letters; and to these were added the testimony of\r\nabbots who could speak from personal knowledge of events or repeat the\r\ntraditions of their several monasteries.\r\n\r\nSide by side with this historical exactness are marvelous stories of saints\r\nand missionaries. It was an age of credulity, and miracles were in men's\r\nminds continually. The men of whom he wrote lived lives more wonderful than\r\nany romance, and their courage and gentleness made a tremendous impression\r\non the rough, warlike people to whom they came with open hands and hearts.\r\nIt is the natural way of all primitive peoples to magnify the works of\r\ntheir heroes, and so deeds of heroism and kindness, which were part of the\r\ndaily life of the Irish missionaries, were soon transformed into the\r\nmiracles of the saints. Bede believed these things, as all other men did,\r\nand records them with charming simplicity, just as he received them from\r\nbishop or abbot. Notwithstanding its errors, we owe to this work nearly all\r\nour knowledge of the eight centuries of our history following the landing\r\nof Cæsar in Britain.\r\n\r\nCÆDMON (Seventh Century)\r\n\r\n    Now must we hymn the Master of heaven,\r\n    The might of the Maker, the deeds of the Father,\r\n    The thought of His heart. He, Lord everlasting,\r\n    Established of old the source of all wonders:\r\n    Creator all-holy, He hung the bright heaven,\r\n    A roof high upreared, o'er the children of men;\r\n    The King of mankind then created for mortals\r\n    The world in its beauty, the earth spread beneath them,\r\n    He, Lord everlasting, omnipotent God.[28]\r\n\r\nIf _Beowulf_ and the fragments of our earliest poetry were brought into\r\nEngland, then the hymn given above is the first verse of all native English\r\nsong that has come down to us, and Cædmon is the first poet to whom we can\r\ngive a definite name and date. The words were written about 665 A.D. and\r\nare found copied at the end of a manuscript of Bede's _Ecclesiastical\r\nHistory_.\r\n\r\nLIFE OF CæDMON. What little we know of Cædmon, the Anglo-Saxon Milton, as\r\nhe is properly called, is taken from Bede's account[29] of the Abbess Hilda\r\nand of her monastery at Whitby. Here is a free and condensed translation of\r\nBede's story:\r\n\r\nThere was, in the monastery of the Abbess Hilda, a brother distinguished by\r\nthe grace of God, for that he could make poems treating of goodness and\r\nreligion. Whatever was translated to him (for he could not read) of Sacred\r\nScripture he shortly reproduced in poetic form of great sweetness and\r\nbeauty. None of all the English poets could equal him, for he learned not\r\nthe art of song from men, nor sang by the arts of men. Rather did he\r\nreceive all his poetry as a free gift from God, and for this reason he did\r\nnever compose poetry of a vain or worldly kind.\r\n\r\nUntil of mature age he lived as a layman and had never learned any poetry.\r\nIndeed, so ignorant of singing was he that sometimes, at a feast, where it\r\nwas the custom that for the pleasure of all each guest should sing in turn,\r\nhe would rise from the table when he saw the harp coming to him and go home\r\nashamed. Now it happened once that he did this thing at a certain\r\nfestivity, and went out to the stall to care for the horses, this duty\r\nbeing assigned to him for that night. As he slept at the usual time, one\r\nstood by him saying: \"Cædmon, sing me something.\" \"I cannot sing,\" he\r\nanswered, \"and that is why I came hither from the feast.\" But he who spake\r\nunto him said again, \"Cædmon, sing to me.\" And he said, \"What shall I\r\nsing?\" and he said, \"Sing the beginning of created things.\" Thereupon\r\nCædmon began to sing verses that he had never heard before, of this import:\r\n\"Now should we praise the power and wisdom of the Creator, the works of the\r\nFather.\" This is the sense but not the form of the hymn that he sang while\r\nsleeping.\r\n\r\nWhen he awakened, Cædmon remembered the words of the hymn and added to them\r\nmany more. In the morning he went to the steward of the monastery lands and\r\nshowed him the gift he had received in sleep. The steward brought him to\r\nHilda, who made him repeat to the monks the hymn he had composed, and all\r\nagreed that the grace of God was upon Cædmon. To test him they expounded to\r\nhim a bit of Scripture from the Latin and bade him, if he could, to turn it\r\ninto poetry. He went away humbly and returned in the morning with an\r\nexcellent poem. Thereupon Hilda received him and his family into the\r\nmonastery, made him one of the brethren, and commanded that the whole\r\ncourse of Bible history be expounded to him. He in turn, reflecting upon\r\nwhat he had heard, transformed it into most delightful poetry, and by\r\nechoing it back to the monks in more melodious sounds made his teachers his\r\nlisteners. In all this his aim was to turn men from wickedness and to help\r\nthem to the love and practice of well doing.\r\n\r\n[Then follows a brief record of Cædmon's life and an exquisite picture of\r\nhis death amidst the brethren.] And so it came to pass [says the simple\r\nrecord] that as he served God while living in purity of mind and serenity\r\nof spirit, so by a peaceful death he left the world and went to look upon\r\nHis face.\r\n\r\nCæDMON'S WORKS. The greatest work attributed to Cædmon is the so-called\r\n_Paraphrase_. It is the story of Genesis, Exodus, and a part of Daniel,\r\ntold in glowing, poetic language, with a power of insight and imagination\r\nwhich often raises it from paraphrase into the realm of true poetry. Though\r\nwe have Bede's assurance that Cædmon \"transformed the whole course of Bible\r\nhistory into most delightful poetry,\" no work known certainly to have been\r\ncomposed by him has come down to us. In the seventeenth century this\r\nAnglo-Saxon _Paraphrase_ was discovered and attributed to Cædmon, and his\r\nname is still associated with it, though it is now almost certain that the\r\n_Paraphrase_ is the work of more than one writer.\r\n\r\nAside from the doubtful question of authorship, even a casual reading of\r\nthe poem brings us into the presence of a poet rude indeed, but with a\r\ngenius strongly suggestive at times of the matchless Milton. The book opens\r\nwith a hymn of praise, and then tells of the fall of Satan and his rebel\r\nangels from heaven, which is familiar to us in Milton's _Paradise Lost_.\r\nThen follows the creation of the world, and the _Paraphrase_ begins to\r\nthrill with the old Anglo-Saxon love of nature.\r\n\r\n    Here first the Eternal Father, guard of all,\r\n    Of heaven and earth, raisèd up the firmament,\r\n    The Almighty Lord set firm by His strong power\r\n    This roomy land; grass greened not yet the plain,\r\n    Ocean far spread hid the wan ways in gloom.\r\n    Then was the Spirit gloriously bright\r\n    Of Heaven's Keeper borne over the deep\r\n    Swiftly. The Life-giver, the Angel's Lord,\r\n    Over the ample ground bade come forth Light.\r\n    Quickly the High King's bidding was obeyed,\r\n    Over the waste there shone light's holy ray.\r\n    Then parted He, Lord of triumphant might,\r\n    Shadow from shining, darkness from the light.\r\n    Light, by the Word of God, was first named day.[30]\r\n\r\nAfter recounting the story of Paradise, the Fall, and the Deluge, the\r\n_Paraphrase_ is continued in the Exodus, of which the poet makes a noble\r\nepic, rushing on with the sweep of a Saxon army to battle. A single\r\nselection is given here to show how the poet adapted the story to his\r\nhearers:\r\n\r\n                        Then they saw,\r\n    Forth and forward faring, Pharaoh's war array\r\n    Gliding on, a grove of spears;--glittering the hosts!\r\n    Fluttered there the banners, there the folk the march trod.\r\n    Onwards surged the war, strode the spears along,\r\n    Blickered the broad shields; blew aloud the trumpets....\r\n    Wheeling round in gyres, yelled the fowls of war,\r\n    Of the battle greedy; hoarsely barked the raven,\r\n    Dew upon his feathers, o'er the fallen corpses--\r\n    Swart that chooser of the slain! Sang aloud the wolves\r\n    At eve their horrid song, hoping for the carrion.[31]\r\n\r\nBesides the _Paraphrase_ we have a few fragments of the same general\r\ncharacter which are attributed to the school of Cædmon. The longest of\r\nthese is _Judith_, in which the story of an apocryphal book of the Old\r\nTestament is done into vigorous poetry. Holofernes is represented as a\r\nsavage and cruel Viking, reveling in his mead hall; and when the heroic\r\nJudith cuts off his head with his own sword and throws it down before the\r\nwarriors of her people, rousing them to battle and victory, we reach\r\nperhaps the most dramatic and brilliant point of Anglo-Saxon literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYNEWULF (Eighth Century)\r\n\r\nOf Cynewulf, greatest of the Anglo-Saxon poets, excepting only the unknown\r\nauthor of _Beowulf_, we know very little. Indeed, it was not till 1840,\r\nmore than a thousand years after his death, that even his name became\r\nknown. Though he is the only one of our early poets who signed his works,\r\nthe name was never plainly written, but woven into the verses in the form\r\nof secret runes,[32] suggesting a modern charade, but more difficult of\r\ninterpretation until one has found the key to the poet's signature.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF CYNEWULF. The only signed poems of Cynewulf are _The Christ,\r\nJuliana, The Fates of the Apostles_, and _Elene_. Unsigned poems attributed\r\nto him or his school are _Andreas_, the _Phoenix_, the _Dream of the Rood_,\r\nthe _Descent into Hell_, _Guthlac_, the _Wanderer_, and some of the\r\nRiddles. The last are simply literary conundrums in which some well-known\r\nobject, like the bow or drinking horn, is described in poetic language, and\r\nthe hearer must guess the name. Some of them, like \"The Swan\"[33] and \"The\r\nStorm Spirit,\" are unusually beautiful.\r\n\r\nOf all these works the most characteristic is undoubtedly _The Christ_, a\r\ndidactic poem in three parts: the first celebrating the Nativity; the\r\nsecond, the Ascension; and the third, \"Doomsday,\" telling the torments of\r\nthe wicked and the unending joy of the redeemed. Cynewulf takes his\r\nsubject-matter partly from the Church liturgy, but more largely from the\r\nhomilies of Gregory the Great. The whole is well woven together, and\r\ncontains some hymns of great beauty and many passages of intense dramatic\r\nforce. Throughout the poem a deep love for Christ and a reverence for the\r\nVirgin Mary are manifest. More than any other poem in any language, _The\r\nChrist_ reflects the spirit of early Latin Christianity.\r\n\r\nHere is a fragment comparing life to a sea voyage,--a comparison which\r\noccurs sooner or later to every thoughtful person, and which finds perfect\r\nexpression in Tennyson's \"Crossing the Bar.\"\r\n\r\n    Now 'tis most like as if we fare in ships\r\n    On the ocean flood, over the water cold,\r\n    Driving our vessels through the spacious seas\r\n    With horses of the deep. A perilous way is this\r\n    Of boundless waves, and there are stormy seas\r\n    On which we toss here in this (reeling) world\r\n    O'er the deep paths. Ours was a sorry plight\r\n    Until at last we sailed unto the land,\r\n    Over the troubled main. Help came to us\r\n    That brought us to the haven of salvation,\r\n    God's Spirit-Son, and granted grace to us\r\n    That we might know e'en from the vessel's deck\r\n    Where we must bind with anchorage secure\r\n    Our ocean steeds, old stallions of the waves.\r\n\r\nIn the two epic poems of _Andreas_ and _Elene_ Cynewulf (if he be the\r\nauthor) reaches the very summit of his poetical art. _Andreas_, an unsigned\r\npoem, records the story of St. Andrew, who crosses the sea to rescue his\r\ncomrade St. Matthew from the cannibals. A young ship-master who sails the\r\nboat turns out to be Christ in disguise, Matthew is set free, and the\r\nsavages are converted by a miracle.[34] It is a spirited poem, full of rush\r\nand incident, and the descriptions of the sea are the best in Anglo-Saxon\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\n_Elene_ has for its subject-matter the finding of the true cross. It tells\r\nof Constantine's vision of the Rood, on the eve of battle. After his\r\nvictory under the new emblem he sends his mother Helena (Elene) to\r\nJerusalem in search of the original cross and the nails. The poem, which is\r\nof very uneven quality, might properly be put at the end of Cynewulf's\r\nworks. He adds to the poem a personal note, signing his name in runes; and,\r\nif we accept the wonderful \"Vision of the Rood\" as Cynewulf's work, we\r\nlearn how he found the cross at last in his own heart. There is a\r\nsuggestion here of the future Sir Launfal and the search for the Holy\r\nGrail.\r\n\r\nDECLINE OF NORTHUMBRIAN LITERATURE. The same northern energy which had\r\nbuilt up learning and literature so rapidly in Northumbria was instrumental\r\nin pulling it down again. Toward the end of the century in which Cynewulf\r\nlived, the Danes swept down on the English coasts and overwhelmed\r\nNorthumbria. Monasteries and schools were destroyed; scholars and teachers\r\nalike were put to the sword, and libraries that had been gathered leaf by\r\nleaf with the toil of centuries were scattered to the four winds. So all\r\ntrue Northumbrian literature perished, with the exception of a few\r\nfragments, and that which we now possess[35] is largely a translation in\r\nthe dialect of the West Saxons. This translation was made by Alfred's\r\nscholars, after he had driven back the Danes in an effort to preserve the\r\nideals and the civilization that had been so hardly won. With the conquest\r\nof Northumbria ends the poetic period of Anglo-Saxon literature. With\r\nAlfred the Great of Wessex our prose literature makes a beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\nALFRED (848-901)\r\n\r\n    \"Every craft and every power soon grows\r\n    old and is passed over and forgotten, if it\r\n    be without wisdom.... This is now to be\r\n    said, that whilst I live I wish to live nobly,\r\n    and after life to leave to the men who come\r\n    after me a memory of good works.\"[36]\r\n\r\nSo wrote the great Alfred, looking back over his heroic life. That he lived\r\nnobly none can doubt who reads the history of the greatest of Anglo-Saxon\r\nkings; and his good works include, among others, the education of half a\r\ncountry, the salvage of a noble native literature, and the creation of the\r\nfirst English prose.\r\n\r\nLIFE AND TIMES OF ALFRED. For the history of Alfred's times, and details of\r\nthe terrific struggle with the Northmen, the reader must be referred to the\r\nhistories. The struggle ended with the Treaty of Wedmore, in 878, with the\r\nestablishment of Alfred not only as king of Wessex, but as overlord of the\r\nwhole northern country. Then the hero laid down his sword, and set himself\r\nas a little child to learn to read and write Latin, so that he might lead\r\nhis people in peace as he had led them in war. It is then that Alfred began\r\nto be the heroic figure in literature that he had formerly been in the wars\r\nagainst the Northmen.\r\n\r\nWith the same patience and heroism that had marked the long struggle for\r\nfreedom, Alfred set himself to the task of educating his people. First he\r\ngave them laws, beginning with the Ten Commandments and ending with the\r\nGolden Rule, and then established courts where laws could be faithfully\r\nadministered. Safe from the Danes by land, he created a navy, almost the\r\nfirst of the English fleets, to drive them from the coast. Then, with peace\r\nand justice established within his borders, he sent to Europe for scholars\r\nand teachers, and set them over schools that he established. Hitherto all\r\neducation had been in Latin; now he set himself the task, first, of\r\nteaching every free-born Englishman to read and write his own language, and\r\nsecond, of translating into English the best books for their instruction.\r\nEvery poor scholar was honored at his court and was speedily set to work at\r\nteaching or translating; every wanderer bringing a book or a leaf of\r\nmanuscript from the pillaged monasteries of Northumbria was sure of his\r\nreward. In this way the few fragments of native Northumbrian literature,\r\nwhich we have been studying, were saved to the world. Alfred and his\r\nscholars treasured the rare fragments and copied them in the West-Saxon\r\ndialect. With the exception of Cædmon's Hymn, we have hardly a single leaf\r\nfrom the great literature of Northumbria in the dialect in which it was\r\nfirst written.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF ALFRED. Aside from his educational work, Alfred is known chiefly\r\nas a translator. After fighting his country's battles, and at a time when\r\nmost men were content with military honor, he began to learn Latin, that he\r\nmight translate the works that would be most helpful to his people. His\r\nimportant translations are four in number: Orosius's _Universal History and\r\nGeography_, the leading work in general history for several centuries;\r\nBede's _History_,[37] the first great historical work written on English\r\nsoil; Pope Gregory's _Shepherds' Book_, intended especially for the clergy;\r\nand Boethius's _Consolations of Philosophy_, the favorite philosophical\r\nwork of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nMore important than any translation is the _English_ or _Saxon Chronicle_.\r\nThis was probably at first a dry record, especially of important births and\r\ndeaths in the West-Saxon kingdom. Alfred enlarged this scant record,\r\nbeginning the story with Cæsar's conquest. When it touches his own reign\r\nthe dry chronicle becomes an interesting and connected story, the oldest\r\nhistory belonging to any modern nation in its own language. The record of\r\nAlfred's reign, probably by himself, is a splendid bit of writing and shows\r\nclearly his claim to a place in literature as well as in history. The\r\n_Chronicle_ was continued after Alfred's death, and is the best monument of\r\nearly English prose that is left to us. Here and there stirring songs are\r\nincluded in the narrative, like \"The Battle of Brunanburh\" and \"The Battle\r\nof Maldon.\"[38] The last, entered 991, seventy-five years before the Norman\r\nConquest, is the swan song of Anglo-Saxon poetry. The _Chronicle_ was\r\ncontinued for a century after the Norman Conquest, and is extremely\r\nvaluable not only as a record of events but as a literary monument showing\r\nthe development of our language.\r\n\r\nCLOSE OF THE ANGLO-SAXON PERIOD. After Alfred's death there is little to\r\nrecord, except the loss of the two supreme objects of his heroic struggle,\r\nnamely, a national life and a national literature. It was at once the\r\nstrength and the weakness of the Saxon that he lived apart as a free man\r\nand never joined efforts willingly with any large body of his fellows. The\r\ntribe was his largest idea of nationality, and, with all our admiration, we\r\nmust confess as we first meet him that he has not enough sense of unity to\r\nmake a great nation, nor enough culture to produce a great literature. A\r\nfew noble political ideals repeated in a score of petty kingdoms, and a few\r\nliterary ideals copied but never increased,--that is the summary of his\r\nliterary history. For a full century after Alfred literature was\r\npractically at a standstill, having produced the best of which it was\r\ncapable, and England waited for the national impulse and for the culture\r\nnecessary for a new and greater art. Both of these came speedily, by way of\r\nthe sea, in the Norman Conquest.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF ANGLO-SAXON PERIOD. Our literature begins with songs and stories\r\nof a time when our Teutonic ancestors were living on the borders of the\r\nNorth Sea. Three tribes of these ancestors, the Jutes, Angles, and Saxons,\r\nconquered Britain in the latter half of the fifth century, and laid the\r\nfoundation of the English nation. The first landing was probably by a tribe\r\nof Jutes, under chiefs called by the chronicle Hengist and Horsa. The date\r\nis doubtful; but the year 449 is accepted by most historians.\r\n\r\nThese old ancestors were hardy warriors and sea rovers, yet were capable of\r\nprofound and noble emotions. Their poetry reflects this double nature. Its\r\nsubjects were chiefly the sea and the plunging boats, battles, adventure,\r\nbrave deeds, the glory of warriors, and the love of home. Accent,\r\nalliteration, and an abrupt break in the middle of each line gave their\r\npoetry a kind of martial rhythm. In general the poetry is earnest and\r\nsomber, and pervaded by fatalism and religious feeling. A careful reading\r\nof the few remaining fragments of Anglo-Saxon literature reveals five\r\nstriking characteristics: the love of freedom; responsiveness to nature,\r\nespecially in her sterner moods; strong religious convictions, and a belief\r\nin Wyrd, or Fate; reverence for womanhood; and a devotion to glory as the\r\nruling motive in every warrior's life.\r\n\r\nIn our study we have noted: (1) the great epic or heroic poem _Beowulf_,\r\nand a few fragments of our first poetry, such as \"Widsith,\" \"Deor's\r\nLament,\" and \"The Seafarer.\" (2) Characteristics of Anglo-Saxon life; the\r\nform of our first speech. (3) The Northumbrian school of writers. Bede, our\r\nfirst historian, belongs to this school; but all his extant works are in\r\nLatin. The two great poets are Cædmon and Cynewulf. Northumbrian literature\r\nflourished between 650 and 850. In the year 867 Northumbria was conquered\r\nby the Danes, who destroyed the monasteries and the libraries containing\r\nour earliest literature. (4) The beginnings of English prose writing under\r\nAlfred (848-901). Our most important prose work of this age is the\r\nAnglo-Saxon Chronicle, which was revised and enlarged by Alfred, and which\r\nwas continued for more than two centuries. It is the oldest historical\r\nrecord known to any European nation in its own tongue.\r\n\r\nSELECTIONS FOR READING. _Miscellaneous Poetry_.

HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nTHE NORMANS. The name Norman, which is a softened form of Northman, tells\r\nits own story. The men who bore the name came originally from\r\nScandinavia,--bands of big, blond, fearless men cruising after plunder and\r\nadventure in their Viking ships, and bringing terror wherever they\r\nappeared. It was these same \"Children of Woden\" who, under the Danes' raven\r\nflag, had blotted out Northumbrian civilization in the ninth century. Later\r\nthe same race of men came plundering along the French coast and conquered\r\nthe whole northern country; but here the results were altogether different.\r\nInstead of blotting out a superior civilization, as the Danes had done,\r\nthey promptly abandoned their own. Their name of Normandy still clings to\r\nthe new home; but all else that was Norse disappeared as the conquerors\r\nintermarried with the native Franks and accepted French ideals and spoke\r\nthe French language. So rapidly did they adopt and improve the Roman\r\ncivilization of the natives that, from a rude tribe of heathen Vikings,\r\nthey had developed within a single century into the most polished and\r\nintellectual people in all Europe. The union of Norse and French (i.e.\r\nRoman-Gallic) blood had here produced a race having the best qualities of\r\nboth,--the will power and energy of the one, the eager curiosity and vivid\r\nimagination of the other. When these Norman-French people appeared in\r\nAnglo-Saxon England they brought with them three noteworthy things: a\r\nlively Celtic disposition, a vigorous and progressive Latin civilization,\r\nand a Romance language.[42] We are to think of the conquerors, therefore,\r\nas they thought and spoke of themselves in the Domesday Book and all their\r\ncontemporary literature, not as Normans but as _Franci_, that is,\r\nFrenchmen.\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEST. At the battle of Hastings (1066) the power of Harold, last of\r\nthe Saxon kings, was broken, and William, duke of Normandy, became master\r\nof England. Of the completion of that stupendous Conquest which began at\r\nHastings, and which changed the civilization of a whole nation, this is not\r\nthe place to speak. We simply point out three great results of the Conquest\r\nwhich have a direct bearing on our literature. First, notwithstanding\r\nCæsar's legions and Augustine's monks, the Normans were the first to bring\r\nthe culture and the practical ideals of Roman civilization home to the\r\nEnglish people; and this at a critical time, when England had produced her\r\nbest, and her own literature and civilization had already begun to decay.\r\nSecond, they forced upon England the national idea, that is, a strong,\r\ncentralized government to replace the loose authority of a Saxon chief over\r\nhis tribesmen. And the world's history shows that without a great\r\nnationality a great literature is impossible. Third, they brought to\r\nEngland the wealth of a new language and literature, and our English\r\ngradually absorbed both. For three centuries after Hastings French was the\r\nlanguage of the upper classes, of courts and schools and literature; yet so\r\ntenaciously did the common people cling to their own strong speech that in\r\nthe end English absorbed almost the whole body of French words and became\r\nthe language of the land. It was the welding of Saxon and French into one\r\nspeech that produced the wealth of our modern English.\r\n\r\nNaturally such momentous changes in a nation were not brought about\r\nsuddenly. At first Normans and Saxons lived apart in the relation of\r\nmasters and servants, with more or less contempt on one side and hatred on\r\nthe other; but in an astonishingly short time these two races were drawn\r\npowerfully together, like two men of different dispositions who are often\r\nled into a steadfast friendship by the attraction of opposite qualities,\r\neach supplying what the other lacks. The _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, which was\r\ncontinued for a century after Hastings, finds much to praise in the\r\nconquerors; on the other hand the Normans, even before the Conquest, had no\r\ngreat love for the French nation. After conquering England they began to\r\nregard it as home and speedily developed a new sense of nationality.\r\nGeoffrey's popular _History_,[43] written less than a century after the\r\nConquest, made conquerors and conquered alike proud of their country by its\r\nstories of heroes who, curiously enough, were neither Norman nor Saxon, but\r\ncreations of the native Celts. Thus does literature, whether in a battle\r\nsong or a history, often play the chief role in the development of\r\nnationality.[44] Once the mutual distrust was overcome the two races\r\ngradually united, and out of this union of Saxons and Normans came the new\r\nEnglish life and literature.\r\n\r\nLITERARY IDEALS OF THE NORMANS. The change in the life of the conquerors\r\nfrom Norsemen to Normans, from Vikings to Frenchmen, is shown most clearly\r\nin the literature which they brought with them to England. The old Norse\r\nstrength and grandeur, the magnificent sagas telling of the tragic\r\nstruggles of men and gods, which still stir us profoundly,--these have all\r\ndisappeared. In their place is a bright, varied, talkative literature,\r\nwhich runs to endless verses, and which makes a wonderful romance out of\r\nevery subject it touches. The theme may be religion or love or chivalry or\r\nhistory, the deeds of Alexander or the misdeeds of a monk; but the author's\r\npurpose never varies. He must tell a romantic story and amuse his audience;\r\nand the more wonders and impossibilities he relates, the more surely is he\r\nbelieved. We are reminded, in reading, of the native Gauls, who would stop\r\nevery traveler and compel him to tell a story ere he passed on. There was\r\nmore of the Gaul than of the Norseman in the conquerors, and far more of\r\nfancy than of thought or feeling in their literature. If you would see this\r\nin concrete form, read the _Chanson de Roland_, the French national epic\r\n(which the Normans first put into literary form), in contrast with\r\n_Beowulf_, which voices the Saxon's thought and feeling before the profound\r\nmystery of human life. It is not our purpose to discuss the evident merits\r\nor the serious defects of Norman-French literature, but only to point out\r\ntwo facts which impress the student, namely, that Anglo-Saxon literature\r\nwas at one time enormously superior to the French, and that the latter,\r\nwith its evident inferiority, absolutely replaced the former. \"The fact is\r\ntoo often ignored,\" says Professor Schofield,[45] \"that before 1066 the\r\nAnglo-Saxons had a body of native literature distinctly superior to any\r\nwhich the Normans or French could boast at that time; their prose\r\nespecially was unparalleled for extent and power in any European\r\nvernacular.\" Why, then, does this superior literature disappear and for\r\nnearly three centuries French remain supreme, so much so that writers on\r\nEnglish soil, even when they do not use the French language, still\r\nslavishly copy the French models?\r\n\r\nTo understand this curious phenomenon it is necessary only to remember the\r\nrelative conditions of the two races who lived side by side in England. On\r\nthe one hand the Anglo-Saxons were a conquered people, and without liberty\r\na great literature is impossible. The inroads of the Danes and their own\r\ntribal wars had already destroyed much of their writings, and in their new\r\ncondition of servitude they could hardly preserve what remained. The\r\nconquering Normans, on the other hand, represented the civilization of\r\nFrance, which country, during the early Middle Ages, was the literary and\r\neducational center of all Europe. They came to England at a time when the\r\nidea of nationality was dead, when culture had almost vanished, when\r\nEnglishmen lived apart in narrow isolation; and they brought with them law,\r\nculture, the prestige of success, and above all the strong impulse to share\r\nin the great world's work and to join in the moving currents of the world's\r\nhistory. Small wonder, then, that the young Anglo-Saxons felt the\r\nquickening of this new life and turned naturally to the cultured and\r\nprogressive Normans as their literary models.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. LITERATURE OF THE NORMAN PERIOD\r\n\r\nIn the Advocates' Library at Edinburgh there is a beautifully illuminated\r\nmanuscript, written about 1330, which gives us an excellent picture of the\r\nliterature of the Norman period. In examining it we are to remember that\r\nliterature was in the hands of the clergy and nobles; that the common\r\npeople could not read, and had only a few songs and ballads for their\r\nliterary portion. We are to remember also that parchments were scarce and\r\nvery expensive, and that a single manuscript often contained all the\r\nreading matter of a castle or a village. Hence this old manuscript is as\r\nsuggestive as a modern library. It contains over forty distinct works, the\r\ngreat bulk of them being romances. There are metrical or verse romances of\r\nFrench and Celtic and English heroes, like Roland, Arthur and Tristram, and\r\nBevis of Hampton. There are stories of Alexander, the Greek romance of\r\n\"Flores and Blanchefleur,\" and a collection of Oriental tales called \"The\r\nSeven Wise Masters.\" There are legends of the Virgin and the saints, a\r\nparaphrase of Scripture, a treatise on the seven deadly sins, some Bible\r\nhistory, a dispute among birds concerning women, a love song or two, a\r\nvision of Purgatory, a vulgar story with a Gallic flavor, a chronicle of\r\nEnglish kings and Norman barons, and a political satire. There are a few\r\nother works, similarly incongruous, crowded together in this typical\r\nmanuscript, which now gives mute testimony to the literary taste of the\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nObviously it is impossible to classify such a variety. We note simply that\r\nit is mediæval in spirit, and French in style and expression; and that sums\r\nup the age. All the scholarly works of the period, like William of\r\nMalmesbury's _History_, and Anselm's[46] _Cur Deus Homo_, and Roger Bacon's\r\n_Opus Majus_, the beginning of modern experimental science, were written in\r\nLatin; while nearly all other works were written in French, or else were\r\nEnglish copies or translations of French originals. Except for the advanced\r\nstudent, therefore, they hardly belong to the story of English literature.\r\nWe shall note here only one or two marked literary types, like the Riming\r\nChronicle (or verse history) and the Metrical Romance, and a few writers\r\nwhose work has especial significance.\r\n\r\nGEOFFREY OF MONMOUTH. (d. 1154). Geoffrey's _Historia Regum Britanniae_ is\r\nnoteworthy, not as literature, but rather as a source book from which many\r\nlater writers drew their literary materials. Among the native Celtic tribes\r\nan immense number of legends, many of them of exquisite beauty, had been\r\npreserved through four successive conquests of Britain. Geoffrey, a Welsh\r\nmonk, collected some of these legends and, aided chiefly by his\r\nimagination, wrote a complete history of the Britons. His alleged authority\r\nwas an ancient manuscript in the native Welsh tongue containing the lives\r\nand deeds of all their kings, from Brutus, the alleged founder of Britain,\r\ndown to the coming of Julius Cæsar.[47] From this Geoffrey wrote his\r\nhistory, down to the death of Cadwalader in 689.\r\n\r\nThe \"History\" is a curious medley of pagan and Christian legends, of\r\nchronicle, comment, and pure invention,--all recorded in minute detail and\r\nwith a gravity which makes it clear that Geoffrey had no conscience, or\r\nelse was a great joker. As history the whole thing is rubbish; but it was\r\nextraordinarily successful at the time and made all who heard it, whether\r\nNormans or Saxons, proud of their own country. It is interesting to us\r\nbecause it gave a new direction to the literature of England by showing the\r\nwealth of poetry and romance that lay in its own traditions of Arthur and\r\nhis knights. Shakespeare's _King Lear_, Malory's _Morte d'Arthur_, and\r\nTennyson's _Idylls of the King_ were founded on the work of this monk, who\r\nhad the genius to put unwritten Celtic tradition in the enduring form of\r\nLatin prose.\r\n\r\nWORK OF THE FRENCH WRITERS. The French literature of the Norman period is\r\ninteresting chiefly because of the avidity with which foreign writers\r\nseized upon the native legends and made them popular in England. Until\r\nGeoffrey's preposterous chronicle appeared, these legends had not been used\r\nto any extent as literary material. Indeed, they were scarcely known in\r\nEngland, though familiar to French and Italian minstrels. Legends of Arthur\r\nand his court were probably first taken to Brittany by Welsh emigrants in\r\nthe fifth and sixth centuries. They became immensely popular wherever they\r\nwere told, and they were slowly carried by minstrels and story-tellers all\r\nover Europe. That they had never received literary form or recognition was\r\ndue to a peculiarity of mediæval literature, which required that every tale\r\nshould have some ancient authority behind it. Geoffrey met this demand by\r\ncreating an historical manuscript of Welsh history. That was enough for the\r\nage. With Geoffrey and his alleged manuscript to rest upon, the Norman-\r\nFrench writers were free to use the fascinating stories which had been-for\r\ncenturies in the possession of their wandering minstrels. Geoffrey's Latin\r\nhistory was put into French verse by Gaimar _(c_. 1150) and by Wace (_c_.\r\n1155), and from these French versions the work was first translated into\r\nEnglish. From about 1200 onward Arthur and Guinevere and the matchless band\r\nof Celtic heroes that we meet later (1470) in Malory's _Morte d' Arthur_\r\nbecame the permanent possession of our literature.\r\n\r\nLAYAMON'S BRUT (_c_. 1200). This is the most important of the English\r\nriming chronicles, that is, history related in the form of doggerel verse,\r\nprobably because poetry is more easily memorized than prose. We give here a\r\nfree rendering of selected lines at the beginning of the poem, which tell\r\nus all we know of Layamon, the first who ever wrote as an Englishman for\r\nEnglishmen, including in the term all who loved England and called it home,\r\nno matter where their ancestors were born.\r\n\r\nNow there was a priest in the land named Layamon. He was son of Leovenath\r\n--may God be gracious unto him. He dwelt at Ernley, at a noble church on\r\nSevern's bank. He read many books, and it came to his mind to tell the\r\nnoble deeds of the English. Then he began to journey far and wide over the\r\nland to procure noble books for authority. He took the English book that\r\nSaint Bede made, another in Latin that Saint Albin made,[48] and a third\r\nbook that a French clerk made, named Wace.[49] Layamon laid these works\r\nbefore him and turned the leaves; lovingly he beheld them. Pen he took, and\r\nwrote on book-skin, and made the three books into one.\r\n\r\nThe poem begins with the destruction of Troy and the flight of \"Æneas the\r\nduke\" into Italy. Brutus, a great-grandson of Æneas, gathers his people and\r\nsets out to find a new land in the West. Then follows the founding of the\r\nBriton kingdom, and the last third of the poem, which is over thirty\r\nthousand lines in length, is taken up with the history of Arthur and his\r\nknights. If the _Brut_ had no merits of its own, it would still interest\r\nus, for it marks the first appearance of the Arthurian legends in our own\r\ntongue. A single selection is given here from Arthur's dying speech,\r\nfamiliar to us in Tennyson's _Morte d'Arthur_. The reader will notice here\r\ntwo things: first, that though the poem is almost pure Anglo-Saxon,[50] our\r\nfirst speech has already dropped many inflections and is more easily read\r\nthan _Beowulf_; second, that French influence is already at work in\r\nLayamon's rimes and assonances, that is, the harmony resulting from using\r\nthe same vowel sound in several successive lines:\r\n\r\n    And ich wulle varen to Avalun:  And I will fare to Avalun,\r\n    To vairest alre maidene,        To fairest of all maidens,\r\n    To Argante there quene,         To Argante the queen,\r\n    Alven swithe sceone.            An elf very beautiful.\r\n    And heo seal mine wunden        And she shall my wounds\r\n    Makien alle isunde,             Make all sound;\r\n    Al hal me makien                All whole me make\r\n    Mid haleweiye drenchen.         With healing drinks.\r\n    And seothe ich cumen wulle      And again will I come\r\n    To mine kiueriche               To my kingdom\r\n    And wunien mid Brutten          And dwell with Britons\r\n    Mid muchelere wunne.            With mickle joy.\r\n    Aefne than worden               Even (with) these words\r\n    Ther com of se wenden           There came from the sea\r\n    That wes an sceort bat lithen,  A short little boat gliding,\r\n    Sceoven mid uthen,              Shoved by the waves;\r\n    And twa wimmen ther inne,       And two women therein,\r\n    Wunderliche idihte.             Wondrously attired.\r\n    And heo nomen Arthur anan       And they took Arthur anon\r\n    And an eovste hine vereden      And bore him hurriedly,\r\n    And softe hine adun leiden,     And softly laid him down,\r\n    And forth gunnen lithen.        And forth gan glide.\r\n\r\nMETRICAL ROMANCES. Love, chivalry, and religion, all pervaded by the spirit\r\nof romance,--these are the three great literary ideals which find\r\nexpression in the metrical romances. Read these romances now, with their\r\nknights and fair ladies, their perilous adventures and tender love-making,\r\ntheir minstrelsy and tournaments and gorgeous cavalcades,--as if humanity\r\nwere on parade, and life itself were one tumultuous holiday in the open\r\nair,--and you have an epitome of the whole childish, credulous soul of the\r\nMiddle Ages. The Normans first brought this type of romance into England,\r\nand so popular did it become, so thoroughly did it express the romantic\r\nspirit of the time, that it speedily overshadowed all other forms of\r\nliterary expression.\r\n\r\nThough the metrical romances varied much in form and subject-matter, the\r\ngeneral type remains the same,--a long rambling poem or series of poems\r\ntreating of love or knightly adventure or both. Its hero is a knight; its\r\ncharacters are fair ladies in distress, warriors in armor, giants, dragons,\r\nenchanters, and various enemies of Church and State; and its emphasis is\r\nalmost invariably on love, religion, and duty as defined by chivalry. In\r\nthe French originals of these romances the lines were a definite length,\r\nthe meter exact, and rimes and assonances were both used to give melody. In\r\nEngland this metrical system came in contact with the uneven lines, the\r\nstrong accent and alliteration of the native songs; and it is due to the\r\ngradual union of the two systems, French and Saxon, that our English became\r\ncapable of the melody and amazing variety of verse forms which first find\r\nexpression in Chaucer's poetry.\r\n\r\nIn the enormous number of these verse romances we note three main\r\ndivisions, according to subject, into the romances (or the so-called\r\nmatter) of France, Rome, and Britain.[51] The matter of France deals\r\nlargely with the exploits of Charlemagne and his peers, and the chief of\r\nthese Carlovingian cycles is the _Chanson de Roland_, the national epic,\r\nwhich celebrates the heroism of Roland in his last fight against the\r\nSaracens at Ronceval. Originally these romances were called _Chansons de\r\nGeste_; and the name is significant as indicating that the poems were\r\noriginally short songs[52] celebrating the deeds _(gesta)_ of well-known\r\nheroes. Later the various songs concerning one hero were gathered together\r\nand the _Geste_ became an epic, like the _Chanson de Roland_, or a kind of\r\ncontinued ballad story, hardly deserving the name of epic, like the _Geste\r\nof Robin Hood_.[53]\r\n\r\nThe matter of Rome consisted largely of tales from Greek and Roman sources;\r\nand the two great cycles of these romances deal with the deeds of\r\nAlexander, a favorite hero, and the siege of Troy, with which the Britons\r\nthought they had some historic connection. To these were added a large\r\nnumber of tales from Oriental sources; and in the exuberant imagination of\r\nthe latter we see the influence which the Saracens--those nimble wits who\r\ngave us our first modern sciences and who still reveled in the _Arabian\r\nNights_--had begun to exercise on the literature of Europe.\r\n\r\nTo the English reader, at least, the most interesting of the romances are\r\nthose which deal with the exploits of Arthur and his Knights of the Round\r\nTable,--the richest storehouse of romance which our literature has ever\r\nfound. There were many cycles of Arthurian romances, chief of which are\r\nthose of Gawain, Launcelot, Merlin, the Quest of the Holy Grail, and the\r\nDeath of Arthur. In preceding sections we have seen how these fascinating\r\nromances were used by Geoffrey and the French writers, and how, through the\r\nFrench, they found their way into English, appearing first in our speech in\r\nLayamon's _Brut_. The point to remember is that, while the legends are\r\nCeltic in origin, their literary form is due to French poets, who\r\noriginated the metrical romance. All our early English romances are either\r\ncopies or translations of the French; and this is true not only of the\r\nmatter of France and Rome, but of Celtic heroes like Arthur, and English\r\nheroes like Guy of Warwick and Robin Hood.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of all Arthurian romances are those of the Gawain\r\ncycle,[54] and of these the story of _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_ is\r\nbest worth reading, for many reasons. First, though the material is taken\r\nfrom French sources,[55] the English workmanship is the finest of our early\r\nromances. Second, the unknown author of this romance probably wrote also\r\n\"The Pearl,\" and is the greatest English poet of the Norman period. Third,\r\nthe poem itself with its dramatic interest, its vivid descriptions, and its\r\nmoral purity, is one of the most delightful old romances in any language.\r\n\r\nIn form _Sir Gawain_ is an interesting combination of French and Saxon\r\nelements. It is written in an elaborate stanza combining meter and\r\nalliteration. At the end of each stanza is a rimed refrain, called by the\r\nFrench a \"tail rime.\" We give here a brief outline of the story; but if the\r\nreader desires the poem itself, he is advised to begin with a modern\r\nversion, as the original is in the West Midland dialect and is exceedingly\r\ndifficult to follow.\r\n\r\nOn New Year's day, while Arthur and his knights are keeping the Yuletide\r\nfeast at Camelot, a gigantic knight in green enters the banquet hall on\r\nhorseback and challenges the bravest knight present to an exchange of\r\nblows; that is, he will expose his neck to a blow of his own big battle-ax,\r\nif any knight will agree to abide a blow in return. After some natural\r\nconsternation and a fine speech by Arthur, Gawain accepts the challenge,\r\ntakes the battle-ax, and with one blow sends the giant's head rolling\r\nthrough the hall. The Green Knight, who is evidently a terrible magician,\r\npicks up his head and mounts his horse. He holds out his head and the\r\nghastly lips speak, warning Gawain to be faithful to his promise and to\r\nseek through the world till he finds the Green Chapel. There, on next New\r\nYear's day, the Green Knight will meet him and return the blow.\r\n\r\nThe second canto of the poem describes Gawain's long journey through the\r\nwilderness on his steed Gringolet, and his adventures with storm and cold,\r\nwith, wild beasts and monsters, as he seeks in vain for the Green Chapel.\r\nOn Christmas eve, in the midst of a vast forest, he offers a prayer to\r\n\"Mary, mildest mother so dear,\" and is rewarded by sight of a great castle.\r\nHe enters and is royally entertained by the host, an aged hero, and by his\r\nwife, who is the most beautiful woman the knight ever beheld. Gawain learns\r\nthat he is at last near the Green Chapel, and settles down for a little\r\ncomfort after his long quest.\r\n\r\nThe next canto shows the life in the castle, and describes a curious\r\ncompact between the host, who goes hunting daily, and the knight, who\r\nremains in the castle to entertain the young wife. The compact is that at\r\nnight each man shall give the other whatever good thing he obtains during\r\nthe day. While the host is hunting, the young woman tries in vain to induce\r\nGawain to make love to her, and ends by giving him a kiss. When the host\r\nreturns and gives his guest the game he has killed Gawain returns the kiss.\r\nOn the third day, her temptations having twice failed, the lady offers\r\nGawain a ring, which he refuses; but when she offers a magic green girdle\r\nthat will preserve the wearer from death, Gawain, who remembers the giant's\r\nax so soon to fall on his neck, accepts the girdle as a \"jewel for the\r\njeopardy\" and promises the lady to keep the gift secret. Here, then, are\r\ntwo conflicting compacts. When the host returns and offers his game, Gawain\r\nreturns the kiss but says nothing of the green girdle.\r\n\r\nThe last canto brings our knight to the Green Chapel, after he is\r\nrepeatedly warned to turn back in the face of certain death. The Chapel is\r\na terrible place in the midst of desolation; and as Gawain approaches he\r\nhears a terrifying sound, the grating of steel on stone, where the giant is\r\nsharpening a new battle-ax. The Green Knight appears, and Gawain, true to\r\nhis compact, offers his neck for the blow. Twice the ax swings harmlessly;\r\nthe third time it falls on his shoulder and wounds him. Whereupon Gawain\r\njumps for his armor, draws his sword, and warns the giant that the compact\r\ncalls for only one blow, and that, if another is offered, he will defend\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThen the Green Knight explains things. He is lord of the castle where\r\nGawain has been entertained for days past. The first two swings of the ax\r\nwere harmless because Gawain had been true to his compact and twice\r\nreturned the kiss. The last blow had wounded him because he concealed the\r\ngift of the green girdle, which belongs to the Green Knight and was woven\r\nby his wife. Moreover, the whole thing has been arranged by Morgain the\r\nfay-woman (an enemy of Queen Guinevere, who appears often in the Arthurian\r\nromances). Full of shame, Gawain throws back the gift and is ready to atone\r\nfor his deception; but the Green Knight thinks he has already atoned, and\r\npresents the green girdle as a free gift. Gawain returns to Arthur's court,\r\ntells the whole story frankly, and ever after that the knights of the Round\r\nTable wear a green girdle in his honor.[56]\r\n\r\nTHE PEARL. In the same manuscript with \"Sir Gawain\" are found three other\r\nremarkable poems, written about 1350, and known to us, in order, as \"The\r\nPearl,\" \"Cleanness,\" and \"Patience.\" The first is the most beautiful, and\r\nreceived its name from the translator and editor, Richard Morris, in 1864.\r\n\"Patience\" is a paraphrase of the book of Jonah; \"Cleanness\" moralizes on\r\nthe basis of Bible stories; but \"The Pearl\" is an intensely human and\r\nrealistic picture of a father's grief for his little daughter Margaret, \"My\r\nprecious perle wythouten spot.\" It is the saddest of all our early poems.\r\n\r\nOn the grave of his little one, covered over with flowers, the father pours\r\nout his love and grief till, in the summer stillness, he falls asleep,\r\nwhile we hear in the sunshine the drowsy hum of insects and the faraway\r\nsound of the reapers' sickles. He dreams there, and the dream grows into a\r\nvision beautiful. His body lies still upon the grave while his spirit goes\r\nto a land, exquisite beyond all words, where he comes suddenly upon a\r\nstream that he cannot cross. As he wanders along the bank, seeking in vain\r\nfor a ford, a marvel rises before his eyes, a crystal cliff, and seated\r\nbeneath it a little maiden who raises a happy, shining face,--the face of\r\nhis little Margaret.\r\n\r\n    More then me lyste my drede aros,\r\n    I stod full stylle and dorste not calle;\r\n    Wyth yghen open and mouth ful clos,\r\n    I stod as hende as hawk in halle.\r\n\r\nHe dares not speak for fear of breaking the spell; but sweet as a lily she\r\ncomes down the crystal stream's bank to meet and speak with him, and tell\r\nhim of the happy life of heaven and how to live to be worthy of it. In his\r\njoy he listens, forgetting all his grief; then the heart of the man cries\r\nout for its own, and he struggles to cross the stream to join her. In the\r\nstruggle the dream vanishes; he wakens to find his eyes wet and his head on\r\nthe little mound that marks the spot where his heart is buried.\r\n\r\nFrom the ideals of these three poems, and from peculiarities of style and\r\nmeter, it is probable that their author wrote also _Sir Gawain and the\r\nGreen Knight_. If so, the unknown author is the one genius of the age whose\r\npoetry of itself has power to interest us, and who stands between Cynewulf\r\nand Chaucer as a worthy follower of the one and forerunner of the other.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS LITERATURE OF THE NORMAN PERIOD. It is well-nigh impossible\r\nto classify the remaining literature of this period, and very little of it\r\nis now read, except by advanced students. Those interested in the\r\ndevelopment of \"transition\" English will find in _the Ancren Riwle_, i.e.\r\n\"Rule of the Anchoresses\" (_c_. 1225), the most beautiful bit of old\r\nEnglish prose ever written. It is a book of excellent religious advice and\r\ncomfort, written for three ladies who wished to live a religious life,\r\nwithout, however, becoming nuns or entering any religious orders. The\r\nauthor was Bishop Poore of Salisbury, according to Morton, who first edited\r\nthis old classic in 1853. Orm's _Ormulum_, written soon after the _Brut_,\r\nis a paraphrase of the gospel lessons for the year, somewhat after the\r\nmanner of Cædmon's _Paraphrase_, but without any of Cædmon's poetic fire\r\nand originality. _Cursor Mundi_ (_c_. 1320) is a very long poem which makes\r\na kind of metrical romance out of Bible history and shows the whole dealing\r\nof God with man from Creation to Domesday. It is interesting as showing a\r\nparallel to the cycles of miracle plays, which attempt to cover the same\r\nvast ground. They were forming in this age; but we will study them later,\r\nwhen we try to understand the rise of the drama in England.\r\n\r\nBesides these greater works, an enormous number of fables and satires\r\nappeared in this age, copied or translated from the French, like the\r\nmetrical romances. The most famous of these are \"The Owl and the\r\nNightingale,\"--a long debate between the two birds, one representing the\r\ngay side of life, the other the sterner side of law and morals,--and \"Land\r\nof Cockaygne,\" i.e. \"Luxury Land,\" a keen satire on monks and monastic\r\nreligion.[57]\r\n\r\nWhile most of the literature of the time was a copy of the French and was\r\nintended only for the upper classes, here and there were singers who made\r\nballads for the common people; and these, next to the metrical romances,\r\nare the most interesting and significant of all the works of the Norman\r\nperiod. On account of its obscure origin and its oral transmission, the\r\nballad is always the most difficult of literary subjects.[58] We make here\r\nonly three suggestions, which may well be borne in mind: that ballads were\r\nproduced continually in England from Anglo-Saxon times until the\r\nseventeenth century; that for centuries they were the only really popular\r\nliterature; and that in the ballads alone one is able to understand the\r\ncommon people. Read, for instance, the ballads of the \"merrie greenwood\r\nmen,\" which gradually collected into the _Geste of Robin Hood_, and you\r\nwill understand better, perhaps, than from reading many histories what the\r\ncommon people of England felt and thought while their lords and masters\r\nwere busy with impossible metrical romances.\r\n\r\nIn these songs speaks the heart of the English folk. There is lawlessness\r\nindeed; but this seems justified by the oppression of the times and by the\r\nbarbarous severity of the game laws. An intense hatred of shams and\r\ninjustice lurks in every song; but the hatred is saved from bitterness by\r\nthe humor with which captives, especially rich churchmen, are solemnly\r\nlectured by the bandits, while they squirm at sight of devilish tortures\r\nprepared before their eyes in order to make them give up their golden\r\npurses; and the scene generally ends in a bit of wild horse-play. There is\r\nfighting enough, and ambush and sudden death lurk at every turn of the\r\nlonely roads; but there is also a rough, honest chivalry for women, and a\r\ngenerous sharing of plunder with the poor and needy. All literature is but\r\na dream expressed, and \"Robin Hood\" is the dream of an ignorant and\r\noppressed but essentially noble people, struggling and determined to be\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nFar more poetical than the ballads, and more interesting even than the\r\nromances, are the little lyrics of the period,--those tears and smiles of\r\nlong ago that crystallized into poems, to tell us that the hearts of men\r\nare alike in all ages. Of these, the best known are the \"Luve Ron\" (love\r\nrune or letter) of Thomas de Hales _(c_. 1250); \"Springtime\" _(c_. 1300),\r\nbeginning \"Lenten (spring) ys come with luve to toune\"; and the melodious\r\nlove song \"Alysoun,\" written at the end of the thirteenth century by some\r\nunknown poet who heralds the coming of Chaucer:\r\n\r\n    Bytuene Mersh and Averil,\r\n    When spray biginneth to springe\r\n    The lutel foul[59] hath hire wyl\r\n    On hyre lud[60] to synge.\r\n    Ich libbe[61] in love longinge\r\n    For semlokest[62] of all thinge.\r\n    She may me blisse bringe;\r\n    Icham[63] in hire baundoun.[64]\r\n        An hendy hap ichabbe yhent,[65]\r\n        Ichot[66] from hevene it is me sent,\r\n        From alle wymmen mi love is lent[67]\r\n        And lyht[68] on Alysoun.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE NORMAN PERIOD. The Normans were originally a hardy race of\r\nsea rovers inhabiting Scandinavia. In the tenth century they conquered a\r\npart of northern France, which is still called Normandy, and rapidly\r\nadopted French civilization and the French language. Their conquest of\r\nAnglo-Saxon England under William, Duke of Normandy, began with the battle\r\nof Hastings in 1066. The literature which they brought to England is\r\nremarkable for its bright, romantic tales of love and adventure, in marked\r\ncontrast with the strength and somberness of Anglo-Saxon poetry. During the\r\nthree centuries following Hastings, Normans and Saxons gradually united.\r\nThe Anglo-Saxon speech simplified itself by dropping most of its Teutonic\r\ninflections, absorbed eventually a large part of the French vocabulary, and\r\nbecame our English language. English literature is also a combination of\r\nFrench and Saxon elements. The three chief effects of the conquest were\r\n_(1)_ the bringing of Roman civilization to England; _(2)_ the growth of\r\nnationality, i.e. a strong centralized government, instead of the loose\r\nunion of Saxon tribes; _(3)_ the new language and literature, which were\r\nproclaimed in Chaucer.\r\n\r\nAt first the new literature was remarkably varied, but of small intrinsic\r\nworth; and very little of it is now read. In our study we have noted: (1)\r\nGeoffrey's History, which is valuable as a source book of literature, since\r\nit contains the native Celtic legends of Arthur. (2) The work of the French\r\nwriters, who made the Arthurian legends popular. (3) Riming Chronicles,\r\ni.e. history in doggerel verse, like Layamon's _Brut_. (4) Metrical\r\nRomances, or tales in verse. These were numerous, and of four classes: (a)\r\nthe Matter of France, tales centering about Charlemagne and his peers,\r\nchief of which is the Chanson de Roland; (b) Matter of Greece and Rome, an\r\nendless series of fabulous tales about Alexander, and about the Fall of\r\nTroy; (c) Matter of England, stories of Bevis of Hampton, Guy of Warwick,\r\nRobin Hood, etc.; (d) Matter of Britain, tales having for their heroes\r\nArthur and his knights of the Round Table. The best of these romances is\r\nSir Gawain and the Green Knight. (5) Miscellaneous literature,--the Ancren\r\nRiwle, our best piece of early English prose; Orm's Ormulum; Cursor Mundi,\r\nwith its suggestive parallel to the Miracle plays; and ballads, like King\r\nHorn and the Robin Hood songs, which were the only poetry of the common\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTIONS FOR READING. For advanced students, and as a study of language,\r\na few selections as given in Manly's English Poetry and in Manly's English\r\nProse; or selections from the Ormulum, Brut, Ancren Riwle, and King Horn,\r\netc., in Morris and Skeat's Specimens of Early English.

Two great movements may be noted in the complex life\r\nof England during the fourteenth century. The first is political, and\r\nculminates in the reign of Edward III. It shows the growth of the English\r\nnational spirit following the victories of Edward and the Black Prince on\r\nFrench soil, during the Hundred Years' War. In the rush of this great\r\nnational movement, separating England from the political ties of France\r\nand, to a less degree, from ecclesiastical bondage to Rome, the mutual\r\ndistrust and jealousy which had divided nobles and commons were momentarily\r\nswept aside by a wave of patriotic enthusiasm. The French language lost its\r\nofficial prestige, and English became the speech not only of the common\r\npeople but of courts and Parliament as well.\r\n\r\nThe second movement is social; it falls largely within the reign of\r\nEdward's successor, Richard II, and marks the growing discontent with the\r\ncontrast between luxury and poverty, between the idle wealthy classes and\r\nthe overtaxed peasants. Sometimes this movement is quiet and strong, as\r\nwhen Wyclif arouses the conscience of England; again it has the portentous\r\nrumble of an approaching tempest, as when John Ball harangues a multitude\r\nof discontented peasants on Black Heath commons, using the famous text:\r\n\r\n    When Adam delved and Eve span\r\n    Who was then the gentleman?\r\n\r\nand again it breaks out into the violent rebellion of Wat Tyler. All these\r\nthings show the same Saxon spirit that had won its freedom in a thousand\r\nyears' struggle against foreign enemies, and that now felt itself oppressed\r\nby a social and industrial tyranny in its own midst.\r\n\r\nAside from these two movements, the age was one of unusual stir and\r\nprogress. Chivalry, that mediæval institution of mixed good and evil, was\r\nin its Indian summer,--a sentiment rather than a practical system. Trade,\r\nand its resultant wealth and luxury, were increasing enormously. Following\r\ntrade, as the Vikings had followed glory, the English began to be a\r\nconquering and colonizing people, like the Anglo-Saxons. The native shed\r\nsomething of his insularity and became a traveler, going first to view the\r\nplaces where trade had opened the way, and returning with wider interests\r\nand a larger horizon. Above all, the first dawn of the Renaissance is\r\nheralded in England, as in Spain and Italy, by the appearance of a national\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nFIVE WRITERS OF THE AGE. The literary movement of the age clearly reflects\r\nthe stirring life of the times. There is Langland, voicing the social\r\ndiscontent, preaching the equality of men and the dignity of labor; Wyclif,\r\ngreatest of English religious reformers, giving the Gospel to the people in\r\ntheir own tongue, and the freedom of the Gospel in unnumbered tracts and\r\naddresses; Gower, the scholar and literary man, criticising this vigorous\r\nlife and plainly afraid of its consequences; and Mandeville, the traveler,\r\nromancing about the wonders to be seen abroad. Above all there is\r\nChaucer,--scholar, traveler, business man, courtier, sharing in all the\r\nstirring life of his times, and reflecting it in literature as no other but\r\nShakespeare has ever done. Outside of England the greatest literary\r\ninfluence of the age was that of Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio, whose\r\nworks, then at the summit of their influence in Italy, profoundly affected\r\nthe literature of all Europe.\r\n\r\nCHAUCER (1340?-1400)\r\n\r\n                     'What man artow?' quod he;\r\n    'Thou lokest as thou woldest finde an hare,\r\n    For ever upon the ground I see thee stare.\r\n    Approchë neer, and loke up merily....\r\n    He semeth elvish by his contenaunce.'\r\n                 (The Host's description of Chaucer,\r\n                             Prologue, _Sir Thopas_)\r\n\r\nON READING CHAUCER. The difficulties of reading Chaucer are more apparent\r\nthan real, being due largely to obsolete spelling, and there is small\r\nnecessity for using any modern versions of the poet's work, which seem to\r\nmiss the quiet charm and dry humor of the original. If the reader will\r\nobserve the following general rules (which of necessity ignore many\r\ndifferences in pronunciation of fourteenth-century English), he may, in an\r\nhour or two, learn to read Chaucer almost as easily as Shakespeare: (1) Get\r\nthe lilt of the lines, and let the meter itself decide how final syllables\r\nare to be pronounced. Remember that Chaucer is among the most musical of\r\npoets, and that there is melody in nearly every line. If the verse seems\r\nrough, it is because we do not read it correctly. (2) Vowels in Chaucer\r\nhave much the same value as in modern German; consonants are practically\r\nthe same as in modern English. (3) Pronounce aloud any strange-looking\r\nwords. Where the eye fails, the ear will often recognize the meaning. If\r\neye and ear both fail, then consult the glossary found in every good\r\nedition of the poet's works. (4) Final _e_ is usually sounded (like _a_ in\r\nVirginia) except where the following word begins with a vowel or with _h_.\r\nIn the latter case the final syllable of one word and the first of the word\r\nfollowing are run together, as in reading Virgil. At the end of a line the\r\n_e_, if lightly pronounced, adds melody to the verse.[70]\r\n\r\nIn dealing with Chaucer's masterpiece, the reader is urged to read widely\r\nat first, for the simple pleasure of the stories, and to remember that\r\npoetry and romance are more interesting and important than Middle English.\r\nWhen we like and appreciate Chaucer--his poetry, his humor, his good\r\nstories, his kind heart---it will be time enough to study his language.\r\n\r\nLIFE OF CHAUCER. For our convenience the life of Chaucer is divided into\r\nthree periods. The first, of thirty years, includes his youth and early\r\nmanhood, in which time he was influenced almost exclusively by French\r\nliterary models. The second period, of fifteen years, covers Chaucer's\r\nactive life as diplomat and man of affairs; and in this the Italian\r\ninfluence seems stronger than the French. The third, of fifteen years,\r\ngenerally known as the English period, is the time of Chaucer's richest\r\ndevelopment. He lives at home, observes life closely but kindly, and while\r\nthe French influence is still strong, as shown in the _Canterbury Tales_,\r\nhe seems to grow more independent of foreign models and is dominated\r\nchiefly by the vigorous life of his own English people.\r\n\r\nChaucer's boyhood was spent in London, on Thames Street near the river,\r\nwhere the world's commerce was continually coming and going. There he saw\r\ndaily the shipman of the _Canterbury Tales_ just home in his good ship\r\nMaudelayne, with the fascination of unknown lands in his clothes and\r\nconversation. Of his education we know nothing, except that he was a great\r\nreader. His father was a wine merchant, purveyor to the royal household,\r\nand from this accidental relation between trade and royalty may have arisen\r\nthe fact that at seventeen years Chaucer was made page to the Princess\r\nElizabeth. This was the beginning of his connection with the brilliant\r\ncourt, which in the next forty years, under three kings, he was to know so\r\nintimately.\r\n\r\nAt nineteen he went with the king on one of the many expeditions of the\r\nHundred Years' War, and here he saw chivalry and all the pageantry of\r\nmediæval war at the height of their outward splendor. Taken prisoner at the\r\nunsuccessful siege of Rheims, he is said to have been ransomed by money out\r\nof the royal purse. Returning to England, he became after a few years\r\nsquire of the royal household, the personal attendant and confidant of the\r\nking. It was during this first period that he married a maid of honor to\r\nthe queen. This was probably Philippa Roet, sister to the wife of John of\r\nGaunt, the famous Duke of Lancaster. From numerous whimsical references in\r\nhis early poems, it has been thought that this marriage into a noble family\r\nwas not a happy one; but this is purely a matter of supposition or of\r\ndoubtful inference.\r\n\r\nIn 1370 Chaucer was sent abroad on the first of those diplomatic missions\r\nthat were to occupy the greater part of the next fifteen years. Two years\r\nlater he made his first official visit to Italy, to arrange a commercial\r\ntreaty with Genoa, and from this time is noticeable a rapid development in\r\nhis literary powers and the prominence of Italian literary influences.\r\nDuring the intervals between his different missions he filled various\r\noffices at home, chief of which was Comptroller of Customs at the port of\r\nLondon. An enormous amount of personal labor was involved; but Chaucer\r\nseems to have found time to follow his spirit into the new fields of\r\nItalian literature:\r\n\r\n    For whan thy labour doon al is,\r\n    And hast y-maad thy rekeninges,\r\n    In stede of reste and newe thinges,\r\n    Thou gost hoom to thy hous anoon,\r\n    And, also domb as any stoon,\r\n    Thou sittest at another boke\r\n    Til fully daswed is thy loke,\r\n    And livest thus as an hermyte.[71]\r\n\r\nIn 1386 Chaucer was elected member of Parliament from Kent, and the\r\ndistinctly English period of his life and work begins. Though exceedingly\r\nbusy in public affairs and as receiver of customs, his heart was still with\r\nhis books, from which only nature could win him:\r\n\r\n    And as for me, though that my wit be lyte,\r\n    On bokes for to rede I me delyte,\r\n    And to hem yeve I feyth and ful credence,\r\n    And in myn herte have hem in reverence\r\n    So hertely, that ther is game noon\r\n    That fro my bokes maketh me to goon,\r\n    But hit be seldom, on the holyday;\r\n    Save, certeynly, whan that the month of May\r\n    Is comen, and that I here the foules singe,\r\n    And that the floures ginnen for to springe--\r\n    Farwel my book and my devocioun![72]\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth century politics seems to have been, for honest men, a\r\nvery uncertain business. Chaucer naturally adhered to the party of John of\r\nGaunt, and his fortunes rose or fell with those of his leader. From this\r\ntime until his death he is up and down on the political ladder; to-day with\r\nmoney and good prospects, to-morrow in poverty and neglect, writing his\r\n\"Complaint to His Empty Purs,\" which he humorously calls his \"saveour doun\r\nin this werlde here.\" This poem called the king's attention to the poet's\r\nneed and increased his pension; but he had but few months to enjoy the\r\neffect of this unusual \"Complaint.\" For he died the next year, 1400, and\r\nwas buried with honor in Westminster Abbey. The last period of his life,\r\nthough outwardly most troubled, was the most fruitful of all. His \"Truth,\"\r\nor \"Good Counsel,\" reveals the quiet, beautiful spirit of his life,\r\nunspoiled either by the greed of trade or the trickery of politics:\r\n\r\n    Flee fro the prees, and dwelle with sothfastnesse,\r\n    Suffyce unto thy good, though hit be smal;\r\n    For hord[73] hath hate, and climbing tikelnesse,\r\n    Prees[74] hath envye, and wele[75] blent[76] overal;\r\n    Savour no more than thee bihovë shal;\r\n    Werk[77] wel thyself, that other folk canst rede;\r\n    And trouthe shal delivere, hit is no drede.\r\n    Tempest[78] thee noght al croked to redresse,\r\n    In trust of hir[79] that turneth as a bal:\r\n    Gret reste stant in litel besinesse;\r\n    And eek be war to sporne[80] ageyn an al[81];\r\n    Stryve noght, as doth the crokke with the wal.\r\n    Daunte[82] thyself, that dauntest otheres dede;\r\n    And trouthe shal delivere, hit is no drede.\r\n    That thee is sent, receyve in buxumnesse,\r\n    The wrastling for this worlde axeth a fal.\r\n    Her nis non hoom, her nis but wildernesse:\r\n    Forth, pilgrim, forth! Forth, beste, out of thy stall,\r\n    Know thy contree, look up, thank God of al;\r\n    Hold the hye wey, and lat thy gost thee lede:\r\n    And trouthe shal delivere, hit is no drede.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF CHAUCER, FIRST PERIOD. The works of Chaucer are roughly divided\r\ninto three classes, corresponding to the three periods of his life. It\r\nshould be remembered, however, that it is impossible to fix exact dates for\r\nmost of his works. Some of his _Canterbury Tales_ were written earlier than\r\nthe English period, and were only grouped with the others in his final\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nThe best known, though not the best, poem of the first period is the\r\n_Romaunt of the Rose_,[83] a translation from the French _Roman de la\r\nRose_, the most popular poem of the Middle Ages,--a graceful but\r\nexceedingly tiresome allegory of the whole course of love. The Rose growing\r\nin its mystic garden is typical of the lady Beauty. Gathering the Rose\r\nrepresents the lover's attempt to win his lady's favor; and the different\r\nfeelings aroused--Love, Hate, Envy, Jealousy, Idleness, Sweet Looks--are\r\nthe allegorical persons of the poet's drama. Chaucer translated this\r\nuniversal favorite, putting in some original English touches; but of the\r\npresent _Romaunt_ only the first seventeen hundred lines are believed to be\r\nChaucer's own work.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best poem of this period is the \"Dethe of Blanche the\r\nDuchesse,\" better known, as the \"Boke of the Duchesse,\" a poem of\r\nconsiderable dramatic and emotional power, written after the death of\r\nBlanche, wife of Chaucer's patron, John of Gaunt. Additional poems are the\r\n\"Compleynte to Pite,\" a graceful love poem; the \"A B C,\" a prayer to the\r\nVirgin, translated from the French of a Cistercian monk, its verses\r\nbeginning with the successive letters of the alphabet; and a number of what\r\nChaucer calls \"ballads, roundels, and virelays,\" with which, says his\r\nfriend Gower, \"the land was filled.\" The latter were imitations of the\r\nprevailing French love ditties.\r\n\r\nSECOND PERIOD. The chief work of the second or Italian period is _Troilus\r\nand Criseyde_, a poem of eight thousand lines. The original story was a\r\nfavorite of many authors during the Middle Ages, and Shakespeare makes use\r\nof it in his _Troilus and Cressida_. The immediate source of Chaucer's poem\r\nis Boccaccio's _Il Filostrato,_ \"the love-smitten one\"; but he uses his\r\nmaterial very freely, to reflect the ideals of his own age and society, and\r\nso gives to the whole story a dramatic force and beauty which it had never\r\nknown before.\r\n\r\nThe \"Hous of Fame\" is one of Chaucer's unfinished poems, having the rare\r\ncombination of lofty thought and simple, homely language, showing the\r\ninfluence of the great Italian master. In the poem the author is carried\r\naway in a dream by a great eagle from the brittle temple of Venus, in a\r\nsandy wilderness, up to the hall of fame. To this house come all rumors of\r\nearth, as the sparks fly upward. The house stands on a rock of ice\r\n\r\n                writen ful of names\r\n    Of folk that hadden grete fames.\r\n\r\nMany of these have disappeared as the ice melted; but the older names are\r\nclear as when first written. For many of his ideas Chaucer is indebted to\r\nDante, Ovid, and Virgil; but the unusual conception and the splendid\r\nworkmanship are all his own.\r\n\r\nThe third great poem of the period is the _Legende of Goode Wimmen_. As he\r\nis resting in the fields among the daisies, he falls asleep and a gay\r\nprocession draws near. First comes the love god, leading by the hand\r\nAlcestis, model of all wifely virtues, whose emblem is the daisy; and\r\nbehind them follow a troup of glorious women, all of whom have been\r\nfaithful in love. They gather about the poet; the god upbraids him for\r\nhaving translated the _Romance of the Rose_, and for his early poems\r\nreflecting on the vanity and fickleness of women. Alcestis intercedes for\r\nhim, and offers pardon if he will atone for his errors by writing a\r\n\"glorious legend of good women.\" Chaucer promises, and as soon as he awakes\r\nsets himself to the task. Nine legends were written, of which \"Thisbe\" is\r\nperhaps the best. It is probable that Chaucer intended to make this his\r\nmasterpiece, devoting many years to stories of famous women who were true\r\nto love; but either because he wearied of his theme, or because the plan of\r\nthe _Canterbury Tales_ was growing in his mind, he abandoned the task in\r\nthe middle of his ninth legend,--fortunately, perhaps, for the reader will\r\nfind the Prologue more interesting than any of the legends.\r\n\r\nTHIRD PERIOD. Chaucer's masterpiece, the _Canterbury Tales_, one of the\r\nmost famous works in all literature, fills the third or English period of\r\nhis life. The plan of the work is magnificent: to represent the wide sweep\r\nof English life by gathering a motley company together and letting each\r\nclass of society tell its own favorite stories. Though the great work was\r\nnever finished, Chaucer succeeded in his purpose so well that in the\r\n_Canterbury Tales_ he has given us a picture of contemporary English life,\r\nits work and play, its deeds and dreams, its fun and sympathy and hearty\r\njoy of living, such as no other single work of literature has ever equaled.\r\n\r\nPLAN OF THE CANTERBURY TALES. Opposite old London, at the southern end of\r\nLondon Bridge, once stood the Tabard Inn of Southwark, a quarter made\r\nfamous not only by the _Canterbury Tales_, but also by the first playhouses\r\nwhere Shakespeare had his training. This Southwark was the point of\r\ndeparture of all travel to the south of England, especially of those\r\nmediæval pilgrimages to the shrine of Thomas a Becket in Canterbury. On a\r\nspring evening, at the inspiring time of the year when \"longen folk to goon\r\non pilgrimages,\" Chaucer alights at the Tabard Inn, and finds it occupied\r\nby a various company of people bent on a pilgrimage. Chance alone had\r\nbrought them together; for it was the custom of pilgrims to wait at some\r\nfriendly inn until a sufficient company were gathered to make the journey\r\npleasant and safe from robbers that might be encountered on the way.\r\nChaucer joins this company, which includes all classes of English society,\r\nfrom the Oxford scholar to the drunken miller, and accepts gladly their\r\ninvitation to go with them on the morrow.\r\n\r\nAt supper the jovial host of the Tabard Inn suggests that, to enliven the\r\njourney, each of the company shall tell four tales, two going and two\r\ncoming, on whatever subject shall suit him best. The host will travel with\r\nthem as master of ceremonies, and whoever tells the best story shall be\r\ngiven a fine supper at the general expense when they all come back\r\nagain,--a shrewd bit of business and a fine idea, as the pilgrims all\r\nagree.\r\n\r\nWhen they draw lots for the first story the chance falls to the Knight, who\r\ntells one of the best of the _Canterbury Tales_, the chivalric story of\r\n\"Palamon and Arcite.\" Then the tales follow rapidly, each with its prologue\r\nand epilogue, telling how the story came about, and its effects on the\r\nmerry company. Interruptions are numerous; the narrative is full of life\r\nand movement, as when the miller gets drunk and insists on telling his tale\r\nout of season, or when they stop at a friendly inn for the night, or when\r\nthe poet with sly humor starts his story of \"Sir Thopas,\" in dreary\r\nimitation of the metrical romances of the day, and is roared at by the host\r\nfor his \"drasty ryming.\" With Chaucer we laugh at his own expense, and are\r\nready for the next tale.\r\n\r\nFrom the number of persons in the company, thirty-two in all, it is evident\r\nthat Chaucer meditated an immense work of one hundred and twenty-eight\r\ntales, which should cover the whole life of England. Only twenty-four were\r\nwritten; some of these are incomplete, and others are taken from his\r\nearlier work to fill out the general plan of the _Canterbury Tales_.\r\nIncomplete as they are, they cover a wide range, including stories of love\r\nand chivalry, of saints and legends, travels, adventures, animal fables,\r\nallegory, satires, and the coarse humor of the common people. Though all\r\nbut two are written in verse and abound in exquisite poetical touches, they\r\nare stories as well as poems, and Chaucer is to be regarded as our first\r\nshort-story teller as well as our first modern poet. The work ends with a\r\nkindly farewell from the poet to his reader, and so \"here taketh the makere\r\nof this book his leve.\"\r\n\r\nPROLOGUE TO THE CANTERBURY TALES. In the famous \"Prologue\" the poet makes\r\nus acquainted with the various characters of his drama. Until Chaucer's day\r\npopular literature had been busy chiefly with the gods and heroes of a\r\ngolden age; it had been essentially romantic, and so had never attempted to\r\nstudy men and women as they are, or to describe them so that the reader\r\nrecognizes them, not as ideal heroes, but as his own neighbors. Chaucer not\r\nonly attempted this new realistic task, but accomplished it so well that\r\nhis characters were instantly recognized as true to life, and they have\r\nsince become the permanent possession of our literature. Beowulf and Roland\r\nare ideal heroes, essentially creatures of the imagination; but the merry\r\nhost of the Tabard Inn, Madame Eglantyne, the fat monk, the parish priest,\r\nthe kindly plowman, the poor scholar with his \"bookës black and red,\"--all\r\nseem more like personal acquaintances than characters in a book. Says\r\nDryden: \"I see all the pilgrims, their humours, their features and their\r\nvery dress, as distinctly as if I had supped with them at the Tabard in\r\nSouthwark.\" Chaucer is the first English writer to bring the atmosphere of\r\nromantic interest about the men and women and the daily work of one's own\r\nworld,--which is the aim of nearly all modern literature.\r\n\r\nThe historian of our literature is tempted to linger over this \"Prologue\"\r\nand to quote from it passage after passage to show how keenly and yet\r\nkindly our first modern poet observed his fellow-men. The characters, too,\r\nattract one like a good play: the \"verray parfit gentil knight\" and his\r\nmanly son, the modest prioress, model of sweet piety and society manners,\r\nthe sporting monk and the fat friar, the discreet man of law, the well-fed\r\ncountry squire, the sailor just home from sea, the canny doctor, the\r\nlovable parish priest who taught true religion to his flock, but \"first he\r\nfolwed it himselve\"; the coarse but good-hearted Wyf of Bath, the thieving\r\nmiller leading the pilgrims to the music of his bagpipe,--all these and\r\nmany others from every walk of English life, and all described with a\r\nquiet, kindly humor which seeks instinctively the best in human nature, and\r\nwhich has an ample garment of charity to cover even its faults and\r\nfailings. \"Here,\" indeed, as Dryden says, \"is God's plenty.\" Probably no\r\nkeener or kinder critic ever described his fellows; and in this immortal\r\n\"Prologue\" Chaucer is a model for all those who would put our human life\r\ninto writing. The student should read it entire, as an introduction not\r\nonly to the poet but to all our modern literature.\r\n\r\nTHE KNIGHT'S TALE. As a story, \"Palamon and Arcite\" is, in many respects,\r\nthe best of the _Canterbury Tales_, reflecting as it does the ideals of the\r\ntime in regard to romantic love and knightly duty. Though its dialogues and\r\ndescriptions are somewhat too long and interrupt the story, yet it shows\r\nChaucer at his best in his dramatic power, his exquisite appreciation of\r\nnature, and his tender yet profound philosophy of living, which could\r\noverlook much of human frailty in the thought that\r\n\r\n    Infinite been the sorwes and the teres\r\n    Of oldë folk, and folk of tendre yeres.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the story was borrowed from Boccaccio; but parts of the\r\noriginal tale were much older and belonged to the common literary stock of\r\nthe Middle Ages. Like Shakespeare, Chaucer took the material for his poems\r\nwherever he found it, and his originality consists in giving to an old\r\nstory some present human interest, making it express the life and ideals of\r\nhis own age. In this respect the \"Knight's Tale\" is remarkable. Its names\r\nare those of an ancient civilization, but its characters are men and women\r\nof the English nobility as Chaucer knew them. In consequence the story has\r\nmany anachronisms, such as the mediæval tournament before the temple of\r\nMars; but the reader scarcely notices these things, being absorbed in the\r\ndramatic interest of the narrative.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the \"Knight's Tale\" is the story of two young men, fast friends,\r\nwho are found wounded on the battlefield and taken prisoners to Athens.\r\nThere from their dungeon window they behold the fair maid Emily; both fall\r\ndesperately in love with her, and their friendship turns to strenuous\r\nrivalry. One is pardoned; the other escapes; and then knights, empires,\r\nnature,--the whole universe follows their desperate efforts to win one\r\nsmall maiden, who prays meanwhile to be delivered from both her bothersome\r\nsuitors. As the best of the _Canterbury Tales_ are now easily accessible,\r\nwe omit here all quotations. The story must be read entire, with the\r\nPrioress' tale of Hugh of Lincoln, the Clerk's tale of Patient Griselda,\r\nand the Nun's Priest's merry tale of Chanticleer and the Fox, if the reader\r\nwould appreciate the variety and charm of our first modern poet and\r\nstory-teller.\r\n\r\nFORM OF CHAUCER'S POETRY. There are three principal meters to be found in\r\nChaucer's verse. In the _Canterbury Tales_ he uses lines of ten syllables\r\nand five accents each, and the lines run in couplets:\r\n\r\n    His eyen twinkled in his heed aright\r\n    As doon the sterres in the frosty night.\r\n\r\nThe same musical measure, arranged in seven-line stanzas, but with a\r\ndifferent rime, called the Rime Royal, is found in its most perfect form in\r\n_Troilus_.\r\n\r\n    O blisful light, of whiche the bemes clere\r\n    Adorneth al the thridde hevene faire!\r\n    O sonnes leef, O Joves doughter dere,\r\n    Plesaunce of love, O goodly debonaire,\r\n    In gentil hertes ay redy to repaire!\r\n    O verray cause of hele and of gladnesse,\r\n    Y-heried be thy might and thy goodnesse!\r\n    In hevene and helle, in erthe and salte see\r\n    Is felt thy might, if that I wel descerne;\r\n    As man, brid, best, fish, herbe and grene tree\r\n    Thee fele in tymes with vapour eterne.\r\n    God loveth, and to love wol nought werne;\r\n    And in this world no lyves creature,\r\n    With-outen love, is worth, or may endure.[84]\r\n\r\nThe third meter is the eight-syllable line with four accents, the lines\r\nriming in couplets, as in the \"Boke of the Duchesse\":\r\n\r\n    Thereto she coude so wel pleye,\r\n    Whan that hir liste, that I dar seye\r\n    That she was lyk to torche bright,\r\n    That every man may take-of light\r\n    Ynough, and hit hath never the lesse.\r\n\r\nBesides these principal meters, Chaucer in his short poems used many other\r\npoetical forms modeled after the French, who in the fourteenth century were\r\ncunning workers in every form of verse. Chief among these are the difficult\r\nbut exquisite rondel, \"Now welcom Somer with thy sonne softe,\" which closes\r\nthe \"Parliament of Fowls,\" and the ballad, \"Flee fro the prees,\" which has\r\nbeen already quoted. In the \"Monk's Tale\" there is a melodious measure\r\nwhich may have furnished the model for Spenser's famous stanza.[85]\r\nChaucer's poetry is extremely musical and must be judged by the ear rather\r\nthan by the eye. To the modern reader the lines appear broken and uneven;\r\nbut if one reads them over a few times, he soon catches the perfect swing\r\nof the measure, and finds that he is in the hands of a master whose ear is\r\ndelicately sensitive to the smallest accent. There is a lilt in all his\r\nlines which is marvelous when we consider that he is the first to show us\r\nthe poetic possibilities of the language. His claim upon our gratitude is\r\ntwofold:[86] first, for discovering the music that is in our English\r\nspeech; and second, for his influence in fixing the Midland dialect as the\r\nliterary language of England.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAUCER'S CONTEMPORARIES\r\n\r\nWILLIAM LANGLAND (1332? ....?)\r\n\r\nLIFE. Very little is known of Langland. He was born probably near Malvern,\r\nin Worcestershire, the son of a poor freeman, and in his early life lived\r\nin the fields as a shepherd. Later he went to London with his wife and\r\nchildren, getting a hungry living as clerk in the church. His real life\r\nmeanwhile was that of a seer, a prophet after Isaiah's own heart, if we may\r\njudge by the prophecy which soon found a voice in _Piers Plowman_. In 1399,\r\nafter the success of his great work, he was possibly writing another poem\r\ncalled _Richard the Redeless_, a protest against Richard II; but we are not\r\ncertain of the authorship of this poem, which was left unfinished by the\r\nassassination of the king. After 1399 Langland disappears utterly, and the\r\ndate of his death is unknown.\r\n\r\nPIERS PLOWMAN. \"The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye\r\nthe way of the Lord,\" might well be written at the beginning of this\r\nremarkable poem. Truth, sincerity, a direct and practical appeal to\r\nconscience, and a vision of right triumphant over wrong,--these are the\r\nelements of all prophecy; and it was undoubtedly these elements in _Piers\r\nPlowman_ that produced such an impression on the people of England. For\r\ncenturies literature had been busy in pleasing the upper classes chiefly;\r\nbut here at last was a great poem which appealed directly to the common\r\npeople, and its success was enormous. The whole poem is traditionally\r\nattributed to Langland; but it is now known to be the work of several\r\ndifferent writers. It first appeared in 1362 as a poem of eighteen hundred\r\nlines, and this may have been Langland's work. In the next thirty years,\r\nduring the desperate social conditions which led to Tyler's Rebellion, it\r\nwas repeatedly revised and enlarged by different hands till it reached its\r\nfinal form of about fifteen thousand lines.\r\n\r\nThe poem as we read it now is in two distinct parts, the first containing\r\nthe vision of Piers, the second a series of visions called \"The Search for\r\nDowel, Dobet, Dobest\" (do well, better, best). The entire poem is in\r\nstrongly accented, alliterative lines, something like _Beowulf_, and its\r\nimmense popularity shows that the common people still cherished this easily\r\nmemorized form of Saxon poetry. Its tremendous appeal to justice and common\r\nhonesty, its clarion call to every man, whether king, priest, noble, or\r\nlaborer, to do his Christian duty, takes from it any trace of prejudice or\r\nbigotry with which such works usually abound. Its loyalty to the Church,\r\nwhile denouncing abuses that had crept into it in that period, was one of\r\nthe great influences which led to the Reformation in England. Its two great\r\nprinciples, the equality of men before God and the dignity of honest labor,\r\nroused a whole nation of freemen. Altogether it is one of the world's great\r\nworks, partly because of its national influence, partly because it is the\r\nvery best picture we possess of the social life of the fourteenth century:\r\n\r\nBriefly, _Piers Plowman_ is an allegory of life. In the first vision, that\r\nof the \"Field Full of Folk,\" the poet lies down on the Malvern Hills on a\r\nMay morning, and a vision comes to him in sleep. On the plain beneath him\r\ngather a multitude of folk, a vast crowd expressing the varied life of the\r\nworld. All classes and conditions are there; workingmen are toiling that\r\nothers may seize all the first fruits of their labor and live high on the\r\nproceeds; and the genius of the throng is Lady Bribery, a powerfully drawn\r\nfigure, expressing the corrupt social life of the times.\r\n\r\nThe next visions are those of the Seven Deadly Sins, allegorical figures,\r\nbut powerful as those of _Pilgrim's Progress_, making the allegories of the\r\n_Romaunt of the Rose_ seem like shadows in comparison. These all came to\r\nPiers asking the way to Truth; but Piers is plowing his half acre and\r\nrefuses to leave his work and lead them. He sets them all to honest toil as\r\nthe best possible remedy for their vices, and preaches the gospel of work\r\nas a preparation for salvation. Throughout the poem Piers bears strong\r\nresemblance to John Baptist preaching to the crowds in the wilderness. The\r\nlater visions are proclamations of the moral and spiritual life of man. The\r\npoem grows dramatic in its intensity, rising to its highest power in\r\nPiers's triumph over Death. And then the poet wakes from his vision with\r\nthe sound of Easter bells ringing in his ears.\r\n\r\nHere are a few lines to illustrate the style and language; but the whole\r\npoem must be read if one is to understand its crude strength and prophetic\r\nspirit:\r\n\r\n    In a somer sesun, whon softe was the sonne,\r\n    I schop[87] me into a shroud, as I a scheep were,\r\n    In habite as an heremite, unholy of werkes,\r\n    Went wyde in this world, wondres to here.\r\n    Bote in a Mayes mornynge, on Malverne hulles,\r\n    Me byfel a ferly,[88] of fairie me thoughte.\r\n    I was wery, forwandred, and went me to reste\r\n    Undur a brod banke, bi a bourne[89] side;\r\n    And as I lay and lened, and loked on the watres,\r\n    I slumbred in a slepyng---hit swyed[90] so murie....\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN WYCLIF (1324?-1384)\r\n\r\nWyclif, as a man, is by far the most powerful English figure of the\r\nfourteenth century. The immense influence of his preaching in the native\r\ntongue, and the power of his Lollards to stir the souls of the common folk,\r\nare too well known historically to need repetition. Though a university man\r\nand a profound scholar, he sides with Langland, and his interests are with\r\nthe people rather than with the privileged classes, for whom Chaucer\r\nwrites. His great work, which earned him his title of \"father of English\r\nprose,\" is the translation of the Bible. Wyclif himself translated the\r\ngospels, and much more of the New Testament; the rest was finished by his\r\nfollowers, especially by Nicholas of Hereford. These translations were made\r\nfrom the Latin Vulgate, not from the original Greek and Hebrew, and the\r\nwhole work was revised in 1388 by John Purvey, a disciple of Wyclif. It is\r\nimpossible to overestimate the influence of this work, both on our English\r\nprose and on the lives of the English people.\r\n\r\nThough Wyclif's works are now unread, except by occasional scholars, he\r\nstill occupies a very high place in our literature. His translation of the\r\nBible was slowly copied all over England, and so fixed a national standard\r\nof English prose to replace the various dialects. Portions of this\r\ntranslation, in the form of favorite passages from Scripture, were copied\r\nby thousands, and for the first time in our history a standard of pure\r\nEnglish was established in the homes of the common people.\r\n\r\nAs a suggestion of the language of that day, we quote a few familiar\r\nsentences from the Sermon on the Mount, as given in the later version of\r\nWyclif's Gospel:\r\n\r\nAnd he openyde his mouth, and taughte hem, and seide, Blessid ben pore men\r\nin spirit, for the kyngdom of hevenes is herne.[91] Blessid ben mylde men,\r\nfor thei schulen welde[92] the erthe. Blessid ben thei that mornen, for\r\nthei schulen be coumfortid. Blessid ben thei that hungren and thristen\r\nrightwisnesse,[93] for thei schulen be fulfillid. Blessid ben merciful men,\r\nfor thei schulen gete merci. Blessid ben thei that ben of clene herte, for\r\nthei schulen se God. Blessid ben pesible men, for thei schulen be\r\nclepid[94] Goddis children. Blessid ben thei that suffren persecusioun for\r\nrightfulnesse, for the kyngdom of hevenes is herne.[95] ...\r\n\r\nEftsoone ye han herd, that it was seid to elde men, Thou schalt not\r\nforswere, but thou schalt yelde[96] thin othis to the Lord. But Y seie[97]\r\nto you, that ye swere not for ony thing;... but be youre worde, yhe, yhe;\r\nnay, nay; and that that is more than these, is of yvel....\r\n\r\nYe han herd that it was seid, Thou schalt love thi neighbore, and hate thin\r\nenemye. But Y seie to you, love ye youre enemyes, do ye wel to hem[98] that\r\nhatiden[99] you, and preye ye for hem that pursuen[100] and sclaundren[101]\r\nyou; that ye be the sones of youre Fadir that is in hevenes, that makith\r\nhis sunne to rise upon goode and yvele men, and reyneth[102] on just men\r\nand unjuste.... Therefore be ye parfit, as youre hevenli Fadir is parfit.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN MANDEVILLE\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1356 there appeared in England an extraordinary book called\r\nthe _Voyage and Travail of Sir John Maundeville_, written in excellent\r\nstyle in the Midland dialect, which was then becoming the literary language\r\nof England. For years this interesting work and its unknown author were\r\nsubjects of endless dispute; but it is now fairly certain that this\r\ncollection of travelers' tales is simply a compilation from Odoric, Marco\r\nPolo, and various other sources. The original work was probably in French,\r\nwhich was speedily translated into Latin, then into English and other\r\nlanguages; and wherever it appeared it became extremely popular, its\r\nmarvelous stories of foreign lands being exactly suited to the credulous\r\nspirit of the age.[103] At the present time there are said to be three\r\nhundred copied manuscripts of \"Mandeville\" in various languages,--more,\r\nprobably, than of any other work save the gospels. In the prologue of the\r\nEnglish version the author calls himself John Maundeville and gives an\r\noutline of his wide travels during thirty years; but the name is probably a\r\n\"blind,\" the prologue more or less spurious, and the real compiler is still\r\nto be discovered.\r\n\r\nThe modern reader may spend an hour or two very pleasantly in this old\r\nwonderland. On its literary side the book is remarkable, though a\r\ntranslation, as being the first prose work in modern English having a\r\ndistinctly literary style and flavor. Otherwise it is a most interesting\r\ncommentary on the general culture and credulity of the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE AGE OF CHAUCER. The fourteenth century is remarkable\r\nhistorically for the decline of feudalism (organized by the Normans), for\r\nthe growth of the English national spirit during the wars with France, for\r\nthe prominence of the House of Commons, and for the growing power of the\r\nlaboring classes, who had heretofore been in a condition hardly above that\r\nof slavery.\r\n\r\nThe age produced five writers of note, one of whom, Geoffrey Chaucer, is\r\none of the greatest of English writers. His poetry is remarkable for its\r\nvariety, its story interest, and its wonderful melody. Chaucer's work and\r\nWyclif's translation of the Bible developed the Midland dialect into the\r\nnational language of England.\r\n\r\nIn our study we have noted: (1) Chaucer, his life and work; his early or\r\nFrench period, in which he translated \"The Romance of the Rose\" and wrote\r\nmany minor poems; his middle or Italian period, of which the chief poems\r\nare \"Troilus and Cressida\" and \"The Legend of Good Women\"; his late or\r\nEnglish period, in which he worked at his masterpiece, the famous\r\n_Canterbury Tales_. (2) Langland, the poet and prophet of social reforms.\r\nHis chief work is _Piers Plowman_. (3) Wyclif, the religious reformer, who\r\nfirst translated the gospels into English, and by his translation fixed a\r\ncommon standard of English speech. (4) Mandeville, the alleged traveler,\r\nwho represents the new English interest in distant lands following the\r\ndevelopment of foreign trade. He is famous for _Mandeville's Travels_, a\r\nbook which romances about the wonders to be seen abroad. The fifth writer\r\nof the age is Gower, who wrote in three languages, French, Latin, and\r\nEnglish. His chief English work is the _Confessio Amantis_, a long poem\r\ncontaining one hundred and twelve tales. Of these only the \"Knight Florent\"\r\nand two or three others are interesting to a modern reader.\r\n\r\nSELECTIONS FOR READING. Chaucer's Prologue, the Knight's Tale, Nun's\r\nPriest's Tale, Prioress' Tale, Clerk's Tale. These are found, more or less\r\ncomplete, in Standard English Classics, King's Classics, Riverside\r\nLiterature Series, etc. Skeat's school edition of the Prologue, Knight's\r\nTale, etc., is especially good, and includes a study of fourteenth-century\r\nEnglish. Miscellaneous poems of Chaucer in Manly's English Poetry or Ward's\r\nEnglish Poets. Piers Plowman, in King's Classics.

HISTORY OF THE PERIOD\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CHANGES. The century and a half following the death of Chaucer\r\n(1400-1550) is the most volcanic period of English history. The land is\r\nswept by vast changes, inseparable from the rapid accumulation of national\r\npower; but since power is the most dangerous of gifts until men have\r\nlearned to control it, these changes seem at first to have no specific aim\r\nor direction. Henry V--whose erratic yet vigorous life, as depicted by\r\nShakespeare, was typical of the life of his times--first let Europe feel\r\nthe might of the new national spirit. To divert that growing and unruly\r\nspirit from rebellion at home, Henry led his army abroad, in the apparently\r\nimpossible attempt to gain for himself three things: a French wife, a\r\nFrench revenue, and the French crown itself. The battle of Agincourt was\r\nfought in 1415, and five years later, by the Treaty of Troyes, France\r\nacknowledged his right to all his outrageous demands.\r\n\r\nThe uselessness of the terrific struggle on French soil is shown by the\r\nrapidity with which all its results were swept away. When Henry died in\r\n1422, leaving his son heir to the crowns of France and England, a\r\nmagnificent recumbent statue with head of pure silver was placed in\r\nWestminster Abbey to commemorate his victories. The silver head was\r\npresently stolen, and the loss is typical of all that he had struggled for.\r\nHis son, Henry VI, was but the shadow of a king, a puppet in the hands of\r\npowerful nobles, who seized the power of England and turned it to self-\r\ndestruction. Meanwhile all his foreign possessions were won back by the\r\nFrench under the magic leadership of Joan of Arc. Cade's Rebellion (1450)\r\nand the bloody Wars of the Roses (1455-1485) are names to show how the\r\nenergy of England was violently destroying itself, like a great engine that\r\nhas lost its balance wheel. The frightful reign of Richard III followed,\r\nwhich had, however, this redeeming quality, that it marked the end of civil\r\nwars and the self-destruction of feudalism, and made possible a new growth\r\nof English national sentiment under the popular Tudors.\r\n\r\nIn the long reign of Henry VIII the changes are less violent, but have more\r\npurpose and significance. His age is marked by a steady increase in the\r\nnational power at home and abroad, by the entrance of the Reformation \"by a\r\nside door,\" and by the final separation of England from all ecclesiastical\r\nbondage in Parliament's famous Act of Supremacy. In previous reigns\r\nchivalry and the old feudal system had practically been banished; now\r\nmonasticism, the third mediæval institution with its mixed evil and good,\r\nreceived its death-blow in the wholesale suppression of the monasteries and\r\nthe removal of abbots from the House of Lords. Notwithstanding the evil\r\ncharacter of the king and the hypocrisy of proclaiming such a creature the\r\nhead of any church or the defender of any faith, we acquiesce silently in\r\nStubb's declaration[105] that \"the world owes some of its greatest debts to\r\nmen from whose memory the world recoils.\"\r\n\r\nWhile England during this period was in constant political strife, yet\r\nrising slowly, like the spiral flight of an eagle, to heights of national\r\ngreatness, intellectually it moved forward with bewildering rapidity.\r\nPrinting was brought to England by Caxton (_c_. 1476), and for the first\r\ntime in history it was possible for a book or an idea to reach the whole\r\nnation. Schools and universities were established in place of the old\r\nmonasteries; Greek ideas and Greek culture came to England in the\r\nRenaissance, and man's spiritual freedom was proclaimed in the Reformation.\r\nThe great names of the period are numerous and significant, but literature\r\nis strangely silent. Probably the very turmoil of the age prevented any\r\nliterary development, for literature is one of the arts of peace; it\r\nrequires quiet and meditation rather than activity, and the stirring life\r\nof the Renaissance had first to be lived before it could express itself in\r\nthe new literature of the Elizabethan period.\r\n\r\nTHE REVIVAL OF LEARNING. The Revival of Learning denotes, in its broadest\r\nsense, that gradual enlightenment of the human mind after the darkness of\r\nthe Middle Ages. The names Renaissance and Humanism, which are often\r\napplied to the same movement, have properly a narrower significance. The\r\nterm Renaissance, though used by many writers \"to denote the whole\r\ntransition from the Middle Ages to the modern world,\"[106] is more\r\ncorrectly applied to the revival of art resulting from the discovery and\r\nimitation of classic models in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.\r\nHumanism applies to the revival of classic literature, and was so called by\r\nits leaders, following the example of Petrarch, because they held that the\r\nstudy of the classics, _literae humaniores_,--i.e. the \"more human\r\nwritings,\" rather than the old theology,--was the best means of promoting\r\nthe largest human interests. We use the term Revival of Learning to cover\r\nthe whole movement, whose essence was, according to Lamartine, that \"man\r\ndiscovered himself and the universe,\" and, according to Taine, that man, so\r\nlong blinded, \"had suddenly opened his eyes and seen.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall understand this better if we remember that in the Middle Ages\r\nman's whole world consisted of the narrow Mediterranean and the nations\r\nthat clustered about it; and that this little world seemed bounded by\r\nimpassable barriers, as if God had said to their sailors, \"Hitherto shalt\r\nthou come, but no farther.\" Man's mind also was bounded by the same narrow\r\nlines. His culture as measured by the great deductive system of\r\nScholasticism consisted not in discovery, but rather in accepting certain\r\nprinciples and traditions established by divine and ecclesiastical\r\nauthority as the basis of all truth. These were his Pillars of Hercules,\r\nhis mental and spiritual bounds that he must not pass, and within these,\r\nlike a child playing with lettered blocks, he proceeded to build his\r\nintellectual system. Only as we remember their limitations can we\r\nappreciate the heroism of these toilers of the Middle Ages, giants in\r\nintellect, yet playing with children's toys; ignorant of the laws and\r\nforces of the universe, while debating the essence and locomotion of\r\nangels; eager to learn, yet forbidden to enter fresh fields in the right of\r\nfree exploration and the joy of individual discovery.\r\n\r\nThe Revival stirred these men as the voyages of Da Gama and Columbus\r\nstirred the mariners of the Mediterranean. First came the sciences and\r\ninventions of the Arabs, making their way slowly against the prejudice of\r\nthe authorities, and opening men's eyes to the unexplored realms of nature.\r\nThen came the flood of Greek literature which the new art of printing\r\ncarried swiftly to every school in Europe, revealing a new world of poetry\r\nand philosophy. Scholars flocked to the universities, as adventurers to the\r\nnew world of America, and there the old authority received a deathblow.\r\nTruth only was authority; to search for truth everywhere, as men sought for\r\nnew lands and gold and the fountain of youth,--that was the new spirit\r\nwhich awoke in Europe with the Revival of Learning.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. LITERATURE OF THE REVIVAL\r\n\r\nThe hundred and fifty years of the Revival period are singularly destitute\r\nof good literature. Men's minds were too much occupied with religious and\r\npolitical changes and with the rapid enlargement of the mental horizon to\r\nfind time for that peace and leisure which are essential for literary\r\nresults. Perhaps, also, the floods of newly discovered classics, which\r\noccupied scholars and the new printing presses alike, were by their very\r\npower and abundance a discouragement of native talent. Roger Ascham\r\n(1515-1568), a famous classical scholar, who published a book called\r\n_Toxophilus_ (School of Shooting) in 1545, expresses in his preface, or\r\n\"apology,\" a very widespread dissatisfaction over the neglect of native\r\nliterature when he says, \"And as for ye Latin or greke tongue, every thing\r\nis so excellently done in them, that none can do better: In the Englysh\r\ntonge contrary, every thinge in a maner so meanly, both for the matter and\r\nhandelynge, that no man can do worse.\"\r\n\r\nOn the Continent, also, this new interest in the classics served to check\r\nthe growth of native literatures. In Italy especially, for a full century\r\nafter the brilliant age of Dante and Petrarch, no great literature was\r\nproduced, and the Italian language itself seemed to go backward.[107] The\r\ntruth is that these great writers were, like Chaucer, far in advance of\r\ntheir age, and that the mediæval mind was too narrow, too scantily\r\nfurnished with ideas to produce a varied literature. The fifteenth century\r\nwas an age of preparation, of learning the beginnings of science, and of\r\ngetting acquainted with the great ideals,--the stern law, the profound\r\nphilosophy, the suggestive mythology, and the noble poetry of the Greeks\r\nand Romans. So the mind was furnished with ideas for a new literature.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Malory's _Morte d'Arthur_ (which is still mediæval in\r\nspirit) the student will find little of interest in the literature of this\r\nperiod. We give here a brief summary of the men and the books most \"worthy\r\nof remembrance\"; but for the real literature of the Renaissance one must go\r\nforward a century and a half to the age of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThe two greatest books which appeared in England during this period are\r\nundoubtedly Erasmus's[108] _Praise of Folly_ (_Encomium Moriae_) and More's\r\n_Utopia_, the famous \"Kingdom of Nowhere.\" Both were written in Latin, but\r\nwere speedily translated into all European languages. The _Praise of Folly_\r\nis like a song of victory for the New Learning, which had driven away vice,\r\nignorance, and superstition, the three foes of humanity. It was published\r\nin 1511 after the accession of Henry VIII. Folly is represented as donning\r\ncap and bells and mounting a pulpit, where the vice and cruelty of kings,\r\nthe selfishness and ignorance of the clergy, and the foolish standards of\r\neducation are satirized without mercy.\r\n\r\nMore's _Utopia_, published in 1516, is a powerful and original study of\r\nsocial conditions, unlike anything which had ever appeared in any\r\nliterature.[109] In our own day we have seen its influence in Bellamy's\r\n_Looking Backward_, an enormously successful book, which recently set\r\npeople to thinking of the unnecessary cruelty of modern social conditions.\r\nMore learns from a sailor, one of Amerigo Vespucci's companions, of a\r\nwonderful Kingdom of Nowhere, in which all questions of labor, government,\r\nsociety, and religion have been easily settled by simple justice and common\r\nsense. In this _Utopia_ we find for the first time, as the foundations of\r\ncivilized society, the three great words, Liberty, Fraternity, Equality,\r\nwhich retained their inspiration through all the violence of the French\r\nRevolution and which are still the unrealized ideal of every free\r\ngovernment. As he hears of this wonderful country More wonders why, after\r\nfifteen centuries of Christianity, his own land is so little civilized; and\r\nas we read the book to-day we ask ourselves the same question. The splendid\r\ndream is still far from being realized; yet it seems as if any nation could\r\nbecome Utopia in a single generation, so simple and just are the\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nGreater than either of these books, in its influence upon the common\r\npeople, is Tyndale's translation of the New Testament (1525), which fixed a\r\nstandard of good English, and at the same time brought that standard not\r\nonly to scholars but to the homes of the common people. Tyndale made his\r\ntranslation from the original Greek, and later translated parts of the Old\r\nTestament from the Hebrew. Much of Tyndale's work was included in Cranmer's\r\nBible, known also as the Great Bible, in 1539, and was read in every parish\r\nchurch in England. It was the foundation for the Authorized Version, which\r\nappeared nearly a century later and became the standard for the whole\r\nEnglish-speaking race.\r\n\r\nWYATT AND SURREY. In 1557 appeared probably the first printed collection of\r\nmiscellaneous English poems, known as _Tottel's Miscellany_. It contained\r\nthe work of the so-called courtly makers, or poets, which had hitherto\r\ncirculated in manuscript form for the benefit of the court. About half of\r\nthese poems were the work of Sir Thomas Wyatt (1503?-1542) and of Henry\r\nHoward, Earl of Surrey (1517?-1547). Both together wrote amorous sonnets\r\nmodeled after the Italians, introducing a new verse form which, although\r\nvery difficult, has been a favorite ever since with our English poets.[110]\r\nSurrey is noted, not for any especial worth or originality of his own\r\npoems, but rather for his translation of two books of Virgil \"in strange\r\nmeter.\" The strange meter was the blank verse, which had never before\r\nappeared in English. The chief literary work of these two men, therefore,\r\nis to introduce the sonnet and the blank verse,--one the most dainty, the\r\nother the most flexible and characteristic form of English poetry,--which\r\nin the hands of Shakespeare and Milton were used to make the world's\r\nmasterpieces.\r\n\r\nMALORY'S MORTE D'ARTHUR. The greatest English work of this period, measured\r\nby its effect on subsequent literature, is undoubtedly the _Morte\r\nd'Arthur_, a collection of the Arthurian romances told in simple and vivid\r\nprose. Of Sir Thomas Malory, the author, Caxton[111] in his introduction\r\nsays that he was a knight, and completed his work in 1470, fifteen years\r\nbefore Caxton printed it. The record adds that \"he was the servant of Jesu\r\nboth by day and night.\" Beyond that we know little[112] except what may be\r\ninferred from the splendid work itself.\r\n\r\nMalory groups the legends about the central idea of the search for the Holy\r\nGrail. Though many of the stories, like Tristram and Isolde, are purely\r\npagan, Malory treats them all in such a way as to preserve the whole spirit\r\nof mediæval Christianity as it has been preserved in no other work. It was\r\nto Malory rather than to Layamon or to the early French writers that\r\nShakespeare and his contemporaries turned for their material; and in our\r\nown age he has supplied Tennyson and Matthew Arnold and Swinburne and\r\nMorris with the inspiration for the \"Idylls of the King\" and the \"Death of\r\nTristram\" and the other exquisite poems which center about Arthur and the\r\nknights of his Round Table.\r\n\r\nIn subject-matter the book belongs to the mediæval age; but Malory himself,\r\nwith his desire to preserve the literary monuments of the past, belongs to\r\nthe Renaissance; and he deserves our lasting gratitude for attempting to\r\npreserve the legends and poetry of Britain at a time when scholars were\r\nchiefly busy with the classics of Greece and Rome. As the Arthurian legends\r\nare one of the great recurring motives of English literature, Malory's work\r\nshould be better known. His stories may be and should be told to every\r\nchild as part of his literary inheritance. Then Malory may be read for his\r\nstyle and his English prose and his expression of the mediæval spirit. And\r\nthen the stories may be read again, in Tennyson's \"Idylls,\" to show how\r\nthose exquisite old fancies appeal to the minds of our modern poets.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE REVIVAL OF LEARNING PERIOD. This transition period is at\r\nfirst one of decline from the Age of Chaucer, and then of intellectual\r\npreparation for the Age of Elizabeth. For a century and a half after\r\nChaucer not a single great English work appeared, and the general standard\r\nof literature was very low. There are three chief causes to account for\r\nthis: (1) the long war with France and the civil Wars of the Roses\r\ndistracted attention from books and poetry, and destroyed of ruined many\r\nnoble English families who had been friends and patrons of literature; (2)\r\nthe Reformation in the latter part of the period filled men's minds with\r\nreligious questions; (3) the Revival of Learning set scholars and literary\r\nmen to an eager study of the classics, rather than to the creation of\r\nnative literature. Historically the age is noticeable for its intellectual\r\nprogress, for the introduction of printing, for the discovery of America,\r\nfor the beginning of the Reformation, and for the growth of political power\r\namong the common people.\r\n\r\nIn our study we have noted: (1) the Revival of Learning, what it was, and\r\nthe significance of the terms Humanism and Renaissance; (2) three\r\ninfluential literary works,--Erasmus's _Praise of Folly_, More's _Utopia_,\r\nand Tyndale's translation of the New Testament; (3) Wyatt and Surrey, and\r\nthe so-called courtly makers or poets; (4) Malory's _Morte d'Arthur_, a\r\ncollection of the Arthurian legends in English prose. The Miracle and\r\nMystery Plays were the most popular form of entertainment in this age; but\r\nwe have reserved them for special study in connection with the Rise of the\r\nDrama, in the following chapter.\r\n\r\nSELECTIONS FOR READING.

HISTORY OF THE PERIOD\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL SUMMARY. In the Age of Elizabeth all doubt seems to vanish from\r\nEnglish history. After the reigns of Edward and Mary, with defeat and\r\nhumiliation abroad and persecutions and rebellion at home, the accession of\r\na popular sovereign was like the sunrise after a long night, and, in\r\nMilton's words, we suddenly see England, \"a noble and puissant nation,\r\nrousing herself, like a strong man after sleep, and shaking her invincible\r\nlocks.\" With the queen's character, a strange mingling of frivolity and\r\nstrength which reminds one of that iron image with feet of clay, we have\r\nnothing whatever to do. It is the national life that concerns the literary\r\nstudent, since even a beginner must notice that any great development of\r\nthe national life is invariably associated with a development of the\r\nnational literature. It is enough for our purpose, therefore, to point out\r\ntwo facts: that Elizabeth, with all her vanity and inconsistency, steadily\r\nloved England and England's greatness; and that she inspired all her people\r\nwith the unbounded patriotism which exults in Shakespeare, and with the\r\npersonal devotion which finds a voice in the _Faery Queen_. Under her\r\nadministration the English national life progressed by gigantic leaps\r\nrather than by slow historical process, and English literature reached the\r\nvery highest point of its development. It is possible to indicate only a\r\nfew general characteristics of this great age which had a direct bearing\r\nupon its literature.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF THE ELIZABETHAN AGE. The most characteristic feature of\r\nthe age was the comparative religious tolerance, which was due largely to\r\nthe queen's influence. The frightful excesses of the religious war known as\r\nthe Thirty Years' War on the Continent found no parallel in England. Upon\r\nher accession Elizabeth found the whole kingdom divided against itself; the\r\nNorth was largely Catholic, while the southern counties were as strongly\r\nProtestant. Scotland had followed the Reformation in its own intense way,\r\nwhile Ireland remained true to its old religious traditions, and both\r\ncountries were openly rebellious. The court, made up of both parties,\r\nwitnessed the rival intrigues of those who sought to gain the royal favor.\r\nIt was due partly to the intense absorption of men's minds in religious\r\nquestions that the preceding century, though an age of advancing learning,\r\nproduced scarcely any literature worthy of the name. Elizabeth favored both\r\nreligious parties, and presently the world saw with amazement Catholics and\r\nProtestants acting together as trusted counselors of a great sovereign. The\r\ndefeat of the Spanish Armada established the Reformation as a fact in\r\nEngland, and at the same time united all Englishmen in a magnificent\r\nnational enthusiasm. For the first time since the Reformation began, the\r\nfundamental question of religious toleration seemed to be settled, and the\r\nmind of man, freed from religious fears and persecutions, turned with a\r\ngreat creative impulse to other forms of activity. It is partly from this\r\nnew freedom of the mind that the Age of Elizabeth received its great\r\nliterary stimulus.\r\n\r\n2. It was an age of comparative social contentment, in strong contrast with\r\nthe days of Langland. The rapid increase of manufacturing towns gave\r\nemployment to thousands who had before been idle and discontented.\r\nIncreasing trade brought enormous wealth to England, and this wealth was\r\nshared to this extent, at least, that for the first time some systematic\r\ncare for the needy was attempted. Parishes were made responsible for their\r\nown poor, and the wealthy were taxed to support them or give them\r\nemployment. The increase of wealth, the improvement in living, the\r\nopportunities for labor, the new social content--these also are factors\r\nwhich help to account for the new literary activity.\r\n\r\n3. It is an age of dreams, of adventure, of unbounded enthusiasm springing\r\nfrom the new lands of fabulous riches revealed by English explorers. Drake\r\nsails around the world, shaping the mighty course which English colonizers\r\nshall follow through the centuries; and presently the young philosopher\r\nBacon is saying confidently, \"I have taken all knowledge for my province.\"\r\nThe mind must search farther than the eye; with new, rich lands opened to\r\nthe sight, the imagination must create new forms to people the new worlds.\r\nHakluyt's famous _Collection of Voyages_, and _Purchas, His Pilgrimage_,\r\nwere even more stimulating to the English imagination than to the English\r\nacquisitiveness. While her explorers search the new world for the Fountain\r\nof Youth, her poets are creating literary works that are young forever.\r\nMarston writes:[114] \"Why, man, all their dripping pans are pure gold. The\r\nprisoners they take are fettered in gold; and as for rubies and diamonds,\r\nthey goe forth on holydayes and gather 'hem by the seashore to hang on\r\ntheir children's coates.\" This comes nearer to being a description of\r\nShakespeare's poetry than of the Indians in Virginia. Prospero, in _The\r\nTempest_, with his control over the mighty powers and harmonies of nature,\r\nis only the literary dream of that science which had just begun to grapple\r\nwith the forces of the universe. Cabot, Drake, Frobisher, Gilbert, Raleigh,\r\nWilloughby, Hawkins,--a score of explorers reveal a new earth to men's\r\neyes, and instantly literature creates a new heaven to match it. So dreams\r\nand deeds increase side by side, and the dream is ever greater than the\r\ndeed. That is the meaning of literature.\r\n\r\n4. To sum up, the Age of Elizabeth was a time of intellectual liberty, of\r\ngrowing intelligence and comfort among all classes, of unbounded\r\npatriotism, and of peace at home and abroad. For a parallel we must go back\r\nto the Age of Pericles in Athens, or of Augustus in Rome, or go forward a\r\nlittle to the magnificent court of Louis XIV, when Corneille, Racine, and\r\nMolière brought the drama in France to the point where Marlowe,\r\nShakespeare, and Jonson had left it in England half a century earlier. Such\r\nan age of great thought and great action, appealing to the eyes as well as\r\nto the imagination and intellect, finds but one adequate literary\r\nexpression; neither poetry nor the story can express the whole man,--his\r\nthought, feeling, action, and the resulting character; hence in the Age of\r\nElizabeth literature turned instinctively to the drama and brought it\r\nrapidly to the highest stage of its development.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE NON-DRAMATIC POETS OF THE ELIZABETHAN AGE\r\n\r\nEDMUND SPENSER (1552-1599)\r\n\r\n    _(Cuddie)_\r\n        \"Piers, I have pipéd erst so long with pain\r\n        That all mine oaten reeds been rent and wore,\r\n        And my poor Muse hath spent her sparéd store,\r\n        Yet little good hath got, and much less gain.\r\n        Such pleasaunce makes the grasshopper so poor,\r\n        And ligge so layd[115] when winter doth her strain.\r\n        The dapper ditties that I wont devise,\r\n        To feed youth's fancy, and the flocking fry\r\n        Delghten much--what I the bet forthy?\r\n        They han the pleasure, I a slender prize:\r\n        I beat the bush, the birds to them do fly:\r\n        What good thereof to Cuddie can arise?\r\n    (_Piers_)\r\n        Cuddie, the praise is better than the price,\r\n        The glory eke much greater than the gain:...\"\r\n                _Shepherd's Calendar_, October\r\n\r\nIn these words, with their sorrowful suggestion of Deor, Spenser reveals\r\nhis own heart, unconsciously perhaps, as no biographer could possibly do.\r\nHis life and work seem to center about three great influences, summed up in\r\nthree names: Cambridge, where he grew acquainted with the classics and the\r\nItalian poets; London, where he experienced the glamour and the\r\ndisappointment of court life; and Ireland, which steeped him in the beauty\r\nand imagery of old Celtic poetry and first gave him leisure to write his\r\nmasterpiece.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Of Spenser's early life and parentage we know little, except that he\r\nwas born in East Smithfield, near the Tower of London, and was poor. His\r\neducation began at the Merchant Tailors' School in London and was continued\r\nin Cambridge, where as a poor sizar and fag for wealthy students he earned\r\na scant living. Here in the glorious world that only a poor scholar knows\r\nhow to create for himself he read the classics, made acquaintance with the\r\ngreat Italian poets, and wrote numberless little poems of his own. Though\r\nChaucer was his beloved master, his ambition was not to rival the\r\n_Canterbury Tales_, but rather to express the dream of English chivalry,\r\nmuch as Ariosto had done for Italy in _Orlando Furioso_.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Cambridge (1576) Spenser went to the north of England, on\r\nsome unknown work or quest. Here his chief occupation was to fall in love\r\nand to record his melancholy over the lost Rosalind in the _Shepherd's\r\nCalendar_. Upon his friend Harvey's advice he came to London, bringing his\r\npoems; and here he met Leicester, then at the height of royal favor, and\r\nthe latter took him to live at Leicester House. Here he finished the\r\n_Shepherd's Calendar_, and here he met Sidney and all the queen's\r\nfavorites. The court was full of intrigues, lying and flattery, and\r\nSpenser's opinion of his own uncomfortable position is best expressed in a\r\nfew lines from \"Mother Hubbard's Tale\":\r\n\r\n    Full little knowest thou, that has not tried,\r\n    What hell it is, in suing long to bide:\r\n    To lose good days, that might be better spent;\r\n    To waste long nights in pensive discontent;\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n    To fret thy soul with crosses and with cares;\r\n    To eat thy heart through comfortless despairs;\r\n    To fawn, to crouch, to wait, to ride, to run,\r\n    To spend, to give, to want, to be undone.\r\n\r\nIn 1580, through Leicester's influence, Spenser, who was utterly weary of\r\nhis dependent position, was made secretary to Lord Grey, the queen's deputy\r\nin Ireland, and the third period of his life began. He accompanied his\r\nchief through one campaign of savage brutality in putting down an Irish\r\nrebellion, and was given an immense estate with the castle of Kilcolman, in\r\nMunster, which had been confiscated from Earl Desmond, one of the Irish\r\nleaders. His life here, where according to the terms of his grant he must\r\nreside as an English settler, he regarded as lonely exile:\r\n\r\n    My luckless lot,\r\n    That banished had myself, like wight forlore,\r\n    Into that waste, where I was quite forgot.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note here a gentle poet's view of the \"unhappy\r\nisland.\" After nearly sixteen years' residence he wrote his _View of the\r\nState of Ireland_ (1596),[116] his only prose work, in which he submits a\r\nplan for \"pacifying the oppressed and rebellious people.\" This was to bring\r\na huge force of cavalry and infantry into the country, give the Irish a\r\nbrief time to submit, and after that to hunt them down like wild beasts. He\r\ncalculated that cold, famine, and sickness would help the work of the\r\nsword, and that after the rebels had been well hounded for two winters the\r\nfollowing summer would find the country peaceful. This plan, from the poet\r\nof harmony and beauty, was somewhat milder than the usual treatment of a\r\nbrave people whose offense was that they loved liberty and religion.\r\nStrange as it may seem, the _View_ was considered most statesmanlike, and\r\nwas excellently well received in England.\r\n\r\nIn Kilcolman, surrounded by great natural beauty, Spenser finished the\r\nfirst three books of the _Faery Queen_. In 1589 Raleigh visited him, heard\r\nthe poem with enthusiasm, hurried the poet off to London, and presented him\r\nto Elizabeth. The first three books met with instant success when published\r\nand were acclaimed as the greatest work in the English language. A yearly\r\npension of fifty pounds was conferred by Elizabeth, but rarely paid, and\r\nthe poet turned back to exile, that is, to Ireland again.\r\n\r\nSoon after his return, Spenser fell in love with his beautiful Elizabeth,\r\nan Irish girl; wrote his _Amoretti_, or sonnets, in her honor; and\r\nafterwards represented her, in the _Faery Queen_, as the beautiful woman\r\ndancing among the Graces. In 1594 he married Elizabeth, celebrating his\r\nwedding with his \"Epithalamion,\" one of the most beautiful wedding hymns in\r\nany language.\r\n\r\nSpenser's next visit to London was in 1595, when he published \"Astrophel,\"\r\nan elegy on the death of his friend Sidney, and three more books of the\r\n_Faery Queen_. On this visit he lived again at Leicester House, now\r\noccupied by the new favorite Essex, where he probably met Shakespeare and\r\nthe other literary lights of the Elizabethan Age. Soon after his return to\r\nIreland, Spenser was appointed Sheriff of Cork, a queer office for a poet,\r\nwhich probably brought about his undoing. The same year Tyrone's Rebellion\r\nbroke out in Munster. Kilcolman, the ancient house of Desmond, was one of\r\nthe first places attacked by the rebels, and Spenser barely escaped with\r\nhis wife and two children. It is supposed that some unfinished parts of the\r\n_Faery Queen_ were burned in the castle.\r\n\r\nFrom the shock of this frightful experience Spenser never recovered. He\r\nreturned to England heartbroken, and in the following year (1599) he died\r\nin an inn at Westminster. According to Ben Jonson he died \"for want of\r\nbread\"; but whether that is a poetic way of saying that he had lost his\r\nproperty or that he actually died of destitution, will probably never be\r\nknown. He was buried beside his master Chaucer in Westminster Abbey, the\r\npoets of that age thronging to his funeral and, according to Camden,\r\n\"casting their elegies and the pens that had written them into his tomb.\"\r\n\r\nSPENSER'S WORKS. _The Faery Queen_ is the great work upon which the poet's\r\nfame chiefly rests. The original plan of the poem included twenty-four\r\nbooks, each of which was to recount the adventure and triumph of a knight\r\nwho represented a moral virtue. Spenser's purpose, as indicated in a letter\r\nto Raleigh which introduces the poem, is as follows:\r\n\r\nTo pourtraict in Arthure, before he was king, the image of a brave Knight,\r\nperfected in the twelve private Morall Vertues, as Aristotle hath devised;\r\nwhich is the purpose of these first twelve bookes: which if I finde to be\r\nwell accepted, I may be perhaps encoraged to frame the other part of\r\nPolliticke Vertues in his person, after that hee came to be king.\r\n\r\nEach of the Virtues appears as a knight, fighting his opposing Vice, and\r\nthe poem tells the story of the conflicts. It is therefore purely\r\nallegorical, not only in its personified virtues but also in its\r\nrepresentation of life as a struggle between good and evil. In its strong\r\nmoral element the poem differs radically from _Orlando Furioso_, upon which\r\nit was modeled. Spenser completed only six books, celebrating Holiness,\r\nTemperance, Chastity, Friendship, Justice, and Courtesy. We have also a\r\nfragment of the seventh, treating of Constancy; but the rest of this book\r\nwas not written, or else was lost in the fire at Kilcolman. The first three\r\nbooks are by far the best; and judging by the way the interest lags and the\r\nallegory grows incomprehensible, it is perhaps as well for Spenser's\r\nreputation that the other eighteen books remained a dream.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT OF THE FAERY QUEEN. From the introductory letter we learn that the\r\nhero visits the queen's court in Fairy Land, while she is holding a\r\ntwelve-days festival. On each day some distressed person appears\r\nunexpectedly, tells a woful story of dragons, of enchantresses, or of\r\ndistressed beauty or virtue, and asks for a champion to right the wrong and\r\nto let the oppressed go free. Sometimes a knight volunteers or begs for the\r\ndangerous mission; again the duty is assigned by the queen; and the\r\njourneys and adventures of these knights are the subjects of the several\r\nbooks. The first recounts the adventures of the Redcross Knight,\r\nrepresenting Holiness, and the lady Una, representing Religion. Their\r\ncontests are symbolical of the world-wide struggle between virtue and faith\r\non the one hand, and sin and heresy on the other. The second book tells the\r\nstory of Sir Guyon, or Temperance; the third, of Britomartis, representing\r\nChastity; the fourth, fifth, and sixth, of Cambel and Triamond\r\n(Friendship), Artegall (Justice), and Sir Calidore (Courtesy). Spenser's\r\nplan was a very elastic one and he filled up the measure of his narrative\r\nwith everything that caught his fancy,--historical events and personages\r\nunder allegorical masks, beautiful ladies, chivalrous knights, giants,\r\nmonsters, dragons, sirens, enchanters, and adventures enough to stock a\r\nlibrary of fiction. If you read Homer or Virgil, you know his subject in\r\nthe first strong line; if you read Cædmon's _Paraphrase_ or Milton's epic,\r\nthe introduction gives you the theme; but Spenser's great poem--with the\r\nexception of a single line in the prologue, \"Fierce warres and faithfull\r\nloves shall moralize my song\"--gives hardly a hint of what is coming.\r\n\r\nAs to the meaning of the allegorical figures, one is generally in doubt. In\r\nthe first three books the shadowy Faery Queen sometimes represents the\r\nglory of God and sometimes Elizabeth, who was naturally flattered by the\r\nparallel. Britomartis is also Elizabeth. The Redcross Knight is Sidney, the\r\nmodel Englishman. Arthur, who always appears to rescue the oppressed, is\r\nLeicester, which is another outrageous flattery. Una is sometimes religion\r\nand sometimes the Protestant Church; while Duessa represents Mary Queen of\r\nScots, or general Catholicism. In the last three books Elizabeth appears\r\nagain as Mercilla; Henry IV of France as Bourbon; the war in the\r\nNetherlands as the story of Lady Belge; Raleigh as Timias; the earls of\r\nNorthumberland and Westmoreland (lovers of Mary or Duessa) as Blandamour\r\nand Paridell; and so on through the wide range of contemporary characters\r\nand events, till the allegory becomes as difficult to follow as the second\r\npart of Goethe's _Faust_.\r\n\r\nPOETICAL FORM. For the _Faery Queen_ Spenser invented a new verse form,\r\nwhich has been called since his day the Spenserian stanza. Because of its\r\nrare beauty it has been much used by nearly all our poets in their best\r\nwork. The new stanza was an improved form of Ariosto's _ottava rima_ (i.e.\r\neight-line stanza) and bears a close resemblance to one of Chaucer's most\r\nmusical verse forms in the \"Monk's Tale.\" Spenser's stanza is in nine\r\nlines, eight of five feet each and the last of six feet, riming\r\n_ababbcbcc_. A few selections from the first book, which is best worth\r\nreading, are reproduced here to show the style and melody of the verse.\r\n\r\n      A Gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine,\r\n      Ycladd[117] in mightie armes and silver shielde,\r\n      Wherein old dints of deepe woundes did remaine\r\n      The cruell markes of many a bloody fielde;\r\n      Yet armes till that time did he never wield:\r\n      His angry steede did chide his foming bitt,\r\n      As much disdayning to the curbe to yield:\r\n      Full iolly[118] knight he seemd, and faire did sitt,\r\n    As one for knightly giusts[119] and fierce encounters fitt.\r\n      And on his brest a bloodie crosse he bore,\r\n      The deare remembrance of his dying Lord,\r\n      For whose sweete sake that glorious badge he wore,\r\n      And dead, as living ever, him ador'd:\r\n      Upon his shield the like was also scor'd,\r\n      For soveraine hope, which in his helpe he had,\r\n      Right faithfull true he was in deede and word;\r\n      But of his cheere[120] did seeme too solemne sad;\r\n    Yet nothing did he dread, but ever was ydrad.[121]\r\n\r\nThis sleepy bit, from the dwelling of Morpheus, invites us to linger:\r\n\r\n      And, more to lulle him in his slumber soft,\r\n      A trickling streame from high rock tumbling downe,\r\n      And ever-drizling raine upon the loft,\r\n      Mixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne\r\n      Of swarming bees, did cast him in a swowne.\r\n      No other noyse, nor peoples troublous cryes,\r\n      As still are wont t'annoy the walled towne,\r\n      Might there be heard: but carelesse Quiet lyes,\r\n      Wrapt in eternal silence farre from enimyes.\r\n\r\nThe description of Una shows the poet's sense of ideal beauty:\r\n\r\n      One day, nigh wearie of the yrkesome way,\r\n      From her unhastie beast she did alight;\r\n      And on the grasse her dainty limbs did lay\r\n      In secrete shadow, far from all mens sight;\r\n      From her fayre head her fillet she undight,[122]\r\n      And layd her stole aside; Her angels face,\r\n      As the great eye of heaven, shynéd bright,\r\n      And made a sunshine in the shady place;\r\n    Did never mortall eye behold such heavenly grace.\r\n      It fortunéd, out of the thickest wood\r\n      A ramping lyon rushéd suddeinly,\r\n      Hunting full greedy after salvage blood:\r\n      Soone as the royall Virgin he did spy,\r\n      With gaping mouth at her ran greedily,\r\n      To have at once devourd her tender corse:\r\n      But to the pray whenas he drew more ny,\r\n      His bloody rage aswaged with remorse,[123]\r\n    And, with the sight amazd, forgat his furious forse.\r\n      Instead thereof he kist her wearie feet,\r\n      And lickt her lilly hands with fawning tong;\r\n      As he her wrongéd innocence did weet.[124]\r\n      O how can beautie maister the most strong,\r\n      And simple truth subdue avenging wrong!\r\n\r\nMINOR POEMS. Next to his masterpiece, the _Shepherd's Calendar_ (1579) is\r\nthe best known of Spenser's poems; though, as his first work, it is below\r\nmany others in melody. It consists of twelve pastoral poems, or eclogues,\r\none for each month of the year. The themes are generally rural life,\r\nnature, love in the fields; and the speakers are shepherds and\r\nshepherdesses. To increase the rustic effect Spenser uses strange forms of\r\nspeech and obsolete words, to such an extent that Jonson complained his\r\nworks are not English or any other language. Some are melancholy poems on\r\nhis lost Rosalind; some are satires on the clergy; one, \"The Briar and the\r\nOak,\" is an allegory; one flatters Elizabeth, and others are pure fables\r\ntouched with the Puritan spirit. They are written in various styles and\r\nmeters, and show plainly that Spenser was practicing and preparing himself\r\nfor greater work.\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy poems are \"Mother Hubbard's Tale,\" a satire on society;\r\n\"Astrophel,\" an elegy on the death of Sidney; _Amoretti_, or sonnets, to\r\nhis Elizabeth; the marriage hymn, \"Epithalamion,\" and four \"Hymns,\" on\r\nLove, Beauty, Heavenly Love, and Heavenly Beauty. There are numerous other\r\npoems and collections of poems, but these show the scope of his work and\r\nare best worth reading.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF THE SHEPHERD'S CALENDAR. The publication of this work, in\r\n1579, by an unknown writer who signed himself modestly \"Immerito,\" marks an\r\nimportant epoch in our literature. We shall appreciate this better if we\r\nremember the long years during which England had been without a great poet.\r\nChaucer and Spenser are often studied together as poets of the Renaissance\r\nperiod, and the idea prevails that they were almost contemporary. In fact,\r\nnearly two centuries passed after Chaucer's death,--years of enormous\r\npolitical and intellectual development,--and not only did Chaucer have no\r\nsuccessor but our language had changed so rapidly that Englishmen had lost\r\nthe ability to read his lines correctly.[125]\r\n\r\nThis first published work of Spenser is noteworthy in at least four\r\nrespects: first, it marks the appearance of the first national poet in two\r\ncenturies; second, it shows again the variety and melody of English verse,\r\nwhich had been largely a tradition since Chaucer; third, it was our first\r\npastoral, the beginning of a long series of English pastoral compositions\r\nmodeled on Spenser, and as such exerted a strong influence on subsequent\r\nliterature; and fourth, it marks the real beginning of the outburst of\r\ngreat Elizabethan poetry.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF SPENSER'S POETRY. The five main qualities of Spenser's\r\npoetry are (1) a perfect melody; (2) a rare sense of beauty; (3) a splendid\r\nimagination, which could gather into one poem heroes, knights, ladies,\r\ndwarfs, demons and dragons, classic mythology, stories of chivalry, and the\r\nthronging ideals of the Renaissance,--all passing in gorgeous procession\r\nacross an ever-changing and ever-beautiful landscape; (4) a lofty moral\r\npurity and seriousness; (5) a delicate idealism, which could make all\r\nnature and every common thing beautiful. In contrast with these excellent\r\nqualities the reader will probably note the strange appearance of his lines\r\ndue to his fondness for obsolete words, like _eyne_ (eyes) and _shend_\r\n(shame), and his tendency to coin others, like _mercify_, to suit his own\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nIt is Spenser's idealism, his love of beauty, and his exquisite melody\r\nwhich have caused him to be known as \"the poets' poet.\" Nearly all our\r\nsubsequent singers acknowledge their delight in him and their indebtedness.\r\nMacaulay alone among critics voices a fault which all who are not poets\r\nquickly feel, namely that, with all Spenser's excellences, he is difficult\r\nto read. The modern man loses himself in the confused allegory of the\r\n_Faery Queen_, skips all but the marked passages, and softly closes the\r\nbook in gentle weariness. Even the best of his longer poems, while of\r\nexquisite workmanship and delightfully melodious, generally fail to hold\r\nthe reader's attention. The movement is languid; there is little dramatic\r\ninterest, and only a suggestion of humor. The very melody of his verses\r\nsometimes grows monotonous, like a Strauss waltz too long continued. We\r\nshall best appreciate Spenser by reading at first only a few well-chosen\r\nselections from the _Faery Queen_ and the _Shepherd's Calendar_, and a few\r\nof the minor poems which exemplify his wonderful melody.\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON BETWEEN CHAUCER AND SPENSER. At the outset it is well to\r\nremember that, though Spenser regarded Chaucer as his master, two centuries\r\nintervene between them, and that their writings have almost nothing in\r\ncommon. We shall appreciate this better by a brief comparison between our\r\nfirst two modern poets.\r\n\r\nChaucer was a combined poet and man of affairs, with the latter\r\npredominating. Though dealing largely with ancient or mediæval material, he\r\nhas a curiously modern way of looking at life. Indeed, he is our only\r\nauthor preceding Shakespeare with whom we feel thoroughly at home. He threw\r\naside the outgrown metrical romance, which was practically the only form of\r\nnarrative in his day, invented the art of story-telling in verse, and\r\nbrought it to a degree of perfection which has probably never since been\r\nequaled. Though a student of the classics, he lived wholly in the present,\r\nstudied the men and women of his own time, painted them as they were, but\r\nadded always a touch of kindly humor or romance to make them more\r\ninteresting. So his mission appears to be simply to amuse himself and his\r\nreaders. His mastery of various and melodious verse was marvelous and has\r\nnever been surpassed in our language; but the English of his day was\r\nchanging rapidly, and in a very few years men were unable to appreciate his\r\nart, so that even to Spenser and Dryden, for example, he seemed deficient\r\nin metrical skill. On this account his influence on our literature has been\r\nmuch less than we should expect from the quality of his work and from his\r\nposition as one of the greatest of English poets.\r\n\r\nLike Chaucer, Spenser was a busy man of affairs, but in him the poet and\r\nthe scholar always predominates. He writes as the idealist, describing men\r\nnot as they are but as he thinks they should be; he has no humor, and his\r\nmission is not to amuse but to reform. Like Chaucer he studies the classics\r\nand contemporary French and Italian writers; but instead of adapting his\r\nmaterial to present-day conditions, he makes poetry, as in his Eclogues for\r\ninstance, more artificial even than his foreign models. Where Chaucer looks\r\nabout him and describes life as he sees it, Spenser always looks backward\r\nfor his inspiration; he lives dreamily in the past, in a realm of purely\r\nimaginary emotions and adventures. His first quality is imagination, not\r\nobservation, and he is the first of our poets to create a world of dreams,\r\nfancies, and illusions. His second quality is a wonderful sensitiveness to\r\nbeauty, which shows itself not only in his subject-matter but also in the\r\nmanner of his poetry. Like Chaucer, he is an almost perfect workman; but in\r\nreading Chaucer we think chiefly of his natural characters or his ideas,\r\nwhile in reading Spenser we think of the beauty of expression. The\r\nexquisite Spenserian stanza and the rich melody of Spenser's verse have\r\nmade him the model of all our modern poets.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR POETS\r\n\r\nThough Spenser is the one great non-dramatic poet of the Elizabethan Age, a\r\nmultitude of minor poets demand attention of the student who would\r\nunderstand the tremendous literary activity of the period. One needs only\r\nto read _The Paradyse of Daynty Devises_ (1576), or _A Gorgeous Gallery of\r\nGallant Inventions_ (1578), or any other of the miscellaneous collections\r\nto find hundreds of songs, many of them of exquisite workmanship, by poets\r\nwhose names now awaken no response. A glance is enough to assure one that\r\nover all England \"the sweet spirit of song had arisen, like the first\r\nchirping of birds after a storm.\" Nearly two hundred poets are recorded in\r\nthe short period from 1558 to 1625, and many of them were prolific writers.\r\nIn a work like this, we can hardly do more than mention a few of the best\r\nknown writers, and spend a moment at least with the works that suggest\r\nMarlowe's description of \"infinite riches in a little room.\" The reader\r\nwill note for himself the interesting union of action and thought in these\r\nmen, so characteristic of the Elizabethan Age; for most of them were\r\nengaged chiefly in business or war or politics, and literature was to them\r\na pleasant recreation rather than an absorbing profession.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS SACKVILLE (1536-1608). Sir Thomas Sackville, Earl of Dorset and Lord\r\nHigh Treasurer of England, is generally classed with Wyatt and Surrey among\r\nthe predecessors of the Elizabethan Age. In imitation of Dante's _Inferno_,\r\nSackville formed the design of a great poem called _The Mirror for\r\nMagistrates_. Under guidance of an allegorical personage called Sorrow, he\r\nmeets the spirits of all the important actors in English history. The idea\r\nwas to follow Lydgate's _Fall of Princes_ and let each character tell his\r\nown story; so that the poem would be a mirror in which present rulers might\r\nsee themselves and read this warning: \"Who reckless rules right soon may\r\nhope to rue.\" Sackville finished only the \"Induction\" and the \"Complaint of\r\nthe Duke of Buckingham.\" These are written in the rime royal, and are\r\nmarked by strong poetic feeling and expression. Unfortunately Sackville\r\nturned from poetry to politics, and the poem was carried on by two inferior\r\npoets, William Baldwin and George Ferrers.\r\n\r\nSackville wrote also, in connection with Thomas Norton, the first English\r\ntragedy, _Ferrex and Porrex_, called also _Gorboduc_, which will be\r\nconsidered in the following section on the Rise of the Drama.\r\n\r\nPHILIP SIDNEY (1554-1586). Sidney, the ideal gentleman, the Sir Calidore of\r\nSpenser's \"Legend of Courtesy,\" is vastly more interesting as a man than as\r\na writer, and the student is recommended to read his biography rather than\r\nhis books. His life expresses, better than any single literary work, the\r\ntwo ideals of the age,--personal honor and national greatness.\r\n\r\nAs a writer he is known by three principal works, all published after his\r\ndeath, showing how little importance he attached to his own writing, even\r\nwhile he was encouraging Spenser. The _Arcadia_ is a pastoral romance,\r\ninterspersed with eclogues, in which shepherds and shepherdesses sing of\r\nthe delights of rural life. Though the work was taken up idly as a summer's\r\npastime, it became immensely popular and was imitated by a hundred poets.\r\nThe _Apologie for Poetrie_ (1595), generally called the _Defense of\r\nPoesie_, appeared in answer to a pamphlet by Stephen Gosson called _The\r\nSchool of Abuse_ (1579), in which the poetry of the age and its unbridled\r\npleasure were denounced with Puritan thoroughness and conviction. The\r\n_Apologie_ is one of the first critical essays in English; and though its\r\nstyle now seems labored and unnatural,--the pernicious result of Euphues\r\nand his school,--it is still one of the best expressions of the place and\r\nmeaning of poetry in any language. _Astrophel and Stella_ is a collection\r\nof songs and sonnets addressed to Lady Penelope Devereux, to whom Sidney\r\nhad once been betrothed. They abound in exquisite lines and passages,\r\ncontaining more poetic feeling and expression than the songs of any other\r\nminor writer of the age.\r\n\r\nGEORGE CHAPMAN (1559?-1634). Chapman spent his long, quiet life among the\r\ndramatists, and wrote chiefly for the stage. His plays, which were for the\r\nmost part merely poems in dialogue, fell far below the high dramatic\r\nstandard of his time and are now almost unread. His most famous work is the\r\nmetrical translation of the _Iliad_ (1611) and of the _Odyssey_ (1614).\r\nChapman's _Homer_, though lacking the simplicity and dignity of the\r\noriginal, has a force and rapidity of movement which makes it superior in\r\nmany respects to Pope's more familiar translation. Chapman is remembered\r\nalso as the finisher of Marlowe's _Hero and Leander_, in which, apart from\r\nthe drama, the Renaissance movement is seen at perhaps its highest point in\r\nEnglish poetry. Out of scores of long poems of the period, _Hero and\r\nLeander_ and the _Faery Queen_ are the only two which are even slightly\r\nknown to modern readers.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL DRAYTON (1563-1631). Drayton is the most voluminous and, to\r\nantiquarians at least, the most interesting of the minor poets. He is the\r\nLayamon of the Elizabethan Age, and vastly more scholarly than his\r\npredecessor. His chief work is _Polyolbion_, an enormous poem of many\r\nthousand couplets, describing the towns, mountains, and rivers of Britain,\r\nwith the interesting legends connected with each. It is an extremely\r\nvaluable work and represents a lifetime of study and research. Two other\r\nlong works are the _Barons' Wars_ and the _Heroic Epistle of England;_ and\r\nbesides these were many minor poems. One of the best of these is the\r\n\"Battle of Agincourt,\" a ballad written in the lively meter which Tennyson\r\nused with some variations in the \"Charge of the Light Brigade,\" and which\r\nshows the old English love of brave deeds and of the songs that stir a\r\npeople's heart in memory of noble ancestors.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE FIRST ENGLISH DRAMATISTS\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF THE DRAMA. First the deed, then the story, then the play;\r\nthat seems to be the natural development of the drama in its simplest form.\r\nThe great deeds of a people are treasured in its literature, and later\r\ngenerations represent in play or pantomime certain parts of the story which\r\nappeal most powerfully to the imagination. Among primitive races the deeds\r\nof their gods and heroes are often represented at the yearly festivals; and\r\namong children, whose instincts are not yet blunted by artificial habits,\r\none sees the story that was heard at bedtime repeated next day in vigorous\r\naction, when our boys turn scouts and our girls princesses, precisely as\r\nour first dramatists turned to the old legends and heroes of Britain for\r\ntheir first stage productions. To act a part seems as natural to humanity\r\nas to tell a story; and originally the drama is but an old story retold to\r\nthe eye, a story put into action by living performers, who for the moment\r\n\"make believe\" or imagine themselves to be the old heroes.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the matter simply, there was a great life lived by him who\r\nwas called the Christ. Inevitably the life found its way into literature,\r\nand we have the Gospels. Around the life and literature sprang up a great\r\nreligion. Its worship was at first simple,--the common prayer, the evening\r\nmeal together, the remembered words of the Master, and the closing hymn.\r\nGradually a ritual was established, which grew more elaborate and\r\nimpressive as the centuries went by. Scenes from the Master's life began to\r\nbe represented in the churches, especially at Christmas time, when the\r\nstory of Christ's birth was made more effective, to the eyes of a people\r\nwho could not read, by a babe in a manger surrounded by magi and shepherds,\r\nwith a choir of angels chanting the _Gloria in Excelsis_.[126] Other\r\nimpressive scenes from the Gospel followed; then the Old Testament was\r\ncalled upon, until a complete cycle of plays from the Creation to the Final\r\nJudgment was established, and we have the Mysteries and Miracle plays of\r\nthe Middle Ages. Out of these came directly the drama of the Elizabethan\r\nAge.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERIODS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DRAMA\r\n\r\n1. THE RELIGIOUS PERIOD. In Europe, as in Greece, the drama had a\r\ndistinctly religious origin.[127] The first characters were drawn from the\r\nNew Testament, and the object of the first plays was to make the church\r\nservice more impressive, or to emphasize moral lessons by showing the\r\nreward of the good and the punishment of the evil doer. In the latter days\r\nof the Roman Empire the Church found the stage possessed by frightful\r\nplays, which debased the morals of a people already fallen too low. Reform\r\nseemed impossible; the corrupt drama was driven from the stage, and plays\r\nof every kind were forbidden. But mankind loves a spectacle, and soon the\r\nChurch itself provided a substitute for the forbidden plays in the famous\r\nMysteries and Miracles.\r\n\r\nMIRACLE AND MYSTERY PLAYS. In France the name _miracle_ was given to any\r\nplay representing the lives of the saints, while the _mystère_ represented\r\nscenes from the life of Christ or stories from the Old Testament associated\r\nwith the coming of Messiah. In England this distinction was almost unknown;\r\nthe name Miracle was used indiscriminately for all plays having their\r\norigin in the Bible or in the lives of the saints; and the name Mystery, to\r\ndistinguish a certain class of plays, was not used until long after the\r\nreligious drama had passed away.\r\n\r\nThe earliest Miracle of which we have any record in England is the _Ludus\r\nde Sancta Katharina_, which was performed in Dunstable about the year\r\n1110.[128] It is not known who wrote the original play of St. Catherine,\r\nbut our first version was prepared by Geoffrey of St. Albans, a French\r\nschool-teacher of Dunstable. Whether or not the play was given in English\r\nis not known, but it was customary in the earliest plays for the chief\r\nactors to speak in Latin or French, to show their importance, while minor\r\nand comic parts of the same play were given in English.\r\n\r\nFor four centuries after this first recorded play the Miracles increased\r\nsteadily in number and popularity in England. They were given first very\r\nsimply and impressively in the churches; then, as the actors increased in\r\nnumber and the plays in liveliness, they overflowed to the churchyards; but\r\nwhen fun and hilarity began to predominate even in the most sacred\r\nrepresentations, the scandalized priests forbade plays altogether on church\r\ngrounds. By the year 1300 the Miracles were out of ecclesiastical hands and\r\nadopted eagerly by the town guilds; and in the following two centuries we\r\nfind the Church preaching against the abuse of the religious drama which it\r\nhad itself introduced, and which at first had served a purely religious\r\npurpose.[129] But by this time the Miracles had taken strong hold upon the\r\nEnglish people, and they continued to be immensely popular until, in the\r\nsixteenth century, they were replaced by the Elizabethan drama.\r\n\r\nThe early Miracle plays of England were divided into two classes: the\r\nfirst, given at Christmas, included all plays connected with the birth of\r\nChrist; the second, at Easter, included the plays relating to his death and\r\ntriumph. By the beginning of the fourteenth century all these plays were,\r\nin various localities, united in single cycles beginning with the Creation\r\nand ending with the Final Judgment. The complete cycle was presented every\r\nspring, beginning on Corpus Christi day; and as the presentation of so many\r\nplays meant a continuous outdoor festival of a week or more, this day was\r\nlooked forward to as the happiest of the whole year.\r\n\r\nProbably every important town in England had its own cycle of plays for its\r\nown guilds to perform, but nearly all have been lost. At the present day\r\nonly four cycles exist (except in the most fragmentary condition), and\r\nthese, though they furnish an interesting commentary on the times, add very\r\nlittle to our literature. The four cycles are the Chester and York plays,\r\nso called from the towns in which they were given; the Towneley or\r\nWakefield plays, named for the Towneley family, which for a long time owned\r\nthe manuscript; and the Coventry plays, which on doubtful evidence have\r\nbeen associated with the Grey Friars (Franciscans) of Coventry. The Chester\r\ncycle has 25 plays, the Wakefield 30, the Coventry 42, and the York 48. It\r\nis impossible to fix either the date or the authorship of any of these\r\nplays; we only know certainly that they were in great favor from the\r\ntwelfth to the sixteenth century. The York plays are generally considered\r\nto be the best; but those of Wakefield show more humor and variety, and\r\nbetter workmanship. The former cycle especially shows a certain unity\r\nresulting from its aim to represent the whole of man's life from birth to\r\ndeath. The same thing is noticeable in _Cursor Mundi_, which, with the York\r\nand Wakefield cycles, belongs to the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\nAt first the actors as well as the authors of the Miracles were the priests\r\nand their chosen assistants. Later, when The town guilds took up the plays\r\nand each guild became responsible for one or more of the series, the actors\r\nwere carefully selected and trained. By four o'clock on the morning of\r\nCorpus Christi all the players had to be in their places in the movable\r\ntheaters, which were scattered throughout the town in the squares and open\r\nplaces. Each of these theaters consisted of a two-story platform, set on\r\nwheels. The lower story was a dressing room for the actors; the upper story\r\nwas the stage proper, and was reached by a trapdoor from below. When the\r\nplay was over the platform was dragged away, and the next play in the cycle\r\ntook its place. So in a single square several plays would be presented in\r\nrapid sequence to the same audience. Meanwhile the first play moved on to\r\nanother square, where another audience was waiting to hear it.\r\n\r\nThough the plays were distinctly religious in character, there is hardly\r\none without its humorous element. In the play of Noah, for instance, Noah's\r\nshrewish wife makes fun for the audience by wrangling with her husband. In\r\nthe Crucifixion play Herod is a prankish kind of tyrant who leaves the\r\nstage to rant among the audience; so that to \"out-herod Herod\" became a\r\ncommon proverb. In all the plays the devil is a favorite character and the\r\nbutt of every joke. He also leaves the stage to play pranks or frighten the\r\nwondering children. On the side of the stage was often seen a huge dragon's\r\nhead with gaping red jaws, belching forth fire and smoke, out of which\r\npoured a tumultuous troop of devils with clubs and pitchforks and gridirons\r\nto punish the wicked characters and to drag them away at last, howling and\r\nshrieking, into hell-mouth, as the dragon's head was called. So the fear of\r\nhell was ingrained into an ignorant people for four centuries. Alternating\r\nwith these horrors were bits of rough horse-play and domestic scenes of\r\npeace and kindliness, representing the life of the English fields and\r\nhomes. With these were songs and carols, like that of the Nativity, for\r\ninstance:\r\n\r\n    As I out rode this enderes (last) night,\r\n    Of three jolly shepherds I saw a sight,\r\n    And all about their fold a star shone bright;\r\n         They sang _terli terlow_,\r\n    So merryly the shepherds their pipes can blow.\r\n    Down from heaven, from heaven so high,\r\n    Of angels there came a great companye\r\n    With mirth, and joy, and great solemnitye;\r\n         They sang _terli terlow_,\r\n    So merryly the shepherds their pipes can blow.\r\n\r\nSuch songs were taken home by the audience and sung for a season, as a\r\npopular tune is now caught from the stage and sung on the streets; and at\r\ntimes the whole audience would very likely join in the chorus.\r\n\r\nAfter these plays were written according to the general outline of the\r\nBible stories, no change was tolerated, the audience insisting, like\r\nchildren at \"Punch and Judy,\" upon seeing the same things year after year.\r\nNo originality in plot or treatment was possible, therefore; the only\r\nvariety was in new songs and jokes, and in the pranks of the devil.\r\nChildish as such plays seem to us, they are part of the religious\r\ndevelopment of all uneducated people. Even now the Persian play of the\r\n\"Martyrdom of Ali\" is celebrated yearly, and the famous \"Passion Play,\" a\r\ntrue Miracle, is given every ten years at Oberammergau.\r\n\r\n2. THE MORAL PERIOD OF THE DRAMA.[130] The second or moral period of the\r\ndrama is shown by the increasing prevalence of the Morality plays. In these\r\nthe characters were allegorical personages,--Life, Death, Repentance,\r\nGoodness, Love, Greed, and other virtues and vices. The Moralities may be\r\nregarded, therefore, as the dramatic counterpart of the once popular\r\nallegorical poetry exemplified by the _Romance of the Rose_. It did not\r\noccur to our first, unknown dramatists to portray men and women as they are\r\nuntil they had first made characters of abstract human qualities.\r\nNevertheless, the Morality marks a distinct advance over the Miracle in\r\nthat it gave free scope to the imagination for new plots and incidents. In\r\nSpain and Portugal these plays, under the name _auto_, were wonderfully\r\ndeveloped by the genius of Calderon and Gil Vicente; but in England the\r\nMorality was a dreary kind of performance, like the allegorical poetry\r\nwhich preceded it.\r\n\r\nTo enliven the audience the devil of the Miracle plays was introduced; and\r\nanother lively personage called the Vice was the predecessor of our modern\r\nclown and jester. His business was to torment the \"virtues\" by mischievous\r\npranks, and especially to make the devil's life a burden by beating him\r\nwith a bladder or a wooden sword at every opportunity. The Morality\r\ngenerally ended in the triumph of virtue, the devil leaping into hell-mouth\r\nwith Vice on his back.\r\n\r\nThe best known of the Moralities is \"Everyman,\" which has recently been\r\nrevived in England and America. The subject of the play is the summoning of\r\nevery man by Death; and the moral is that nothing can take away the terror\r\nof the inevitable summons but an honest life and the comforts of religion.\r\nIn its dramatic unity it suggests the pure Greek drama; there is no change\r\nof time or scene, and the stage is never empty from the beginning to the\r\nend of the performance. Other well-known Moralities are the \"Pride of\r\nLife,\" \"Hyckescorner,\" and \"Castell of Perseverance.\" In the latter, man is\r\nrepresented as shut up in a castle garrisoned by the virtues and besieged\r\nby the vices.\r\n\r\nLike the Miracle plays, most of the old Moralities are of unknown date and\r\norigin. Of the known authors of Moralities, two of the best are John\r\nSkelton, who wrote \"Magnificence,\" and probably also \"The Necromancer\"; and\r\nSir David Lindsay (1490-1555), \"the poet of the Scotch Reformation,\" whose\r\nreligious business it was to make rulers uncomfortable by telling them\r\nunpleasant truths in the form of poetry. With these men a new element\r\nenters into the Moralities. They satirize or denounce abuses of Church and\r\nState, and introduce living personages thinly disguised as allegories; so\r\nthat the stage first becomes a power in shaping events and correcting\r\nabuses.\r\n\r\nTHE INTERLUDES. It is impossible to draw any accurate line of distinction\r\nbetween the Moralities and Interludes. In general we may think of the\r\nlatter as dramatic scenes, sometimes given by themselves (usually with\r\nmusic and singing) at banquets and entertainments where a little fun was\r\nwanted; and again slipped into a Miracle play to enliven the audience after\r\na solemn scene. Thus on the margin of a page of one of the old Chester\r\nplays we read, \"The boye and pigge when the kinges are gone.\" Certainly\r\nthis was no part of the original scene between Herod and the three kings.\r\nSo also the quarrel between Noah and his wife is probably a late addition\r\nto an old play. The Interludes originated, undoubtedly, in a sense of\r\nhumor; and to John Heywood (1497?-1580?), a favorite retainer and jester at\r\nthe court of Mary, is due the credit for raising the Interlude to the\r\ndistinct dramatic form known as comedy.\r\n\r\nHeywood's Interludes were written between 1520 and 1540. His most famous is\r\n\"The Four P's,\" a contest of wit between a \"Pardoner, a Palmer, a Pedlar\r\nand a Poticary.\" The characters here strongly suggest those of\r\nChaucer.[131] Another interesting Interlude is called \"The Play of the\r\nWeather.\" In this Jupiter and the gods assemble to listen to complaints\r\nabout the weather and to reform abuses. Naturally everybody wants his own\r\nkind of weather. The climax is reached by a boy who announces that a boy's\r\npleasure consists in two things, catching birds and throwing snowballs, and\r\nbegs for the weather to be such that he can always do both. Jupiter decides\r\nthat he will do just as he pleases about the weather, and everybody goes\r\nhome satisfied.\r\n\r\nAll these early plays were written, for the most part, in a mingling of\r\nprose and wretched doggerel, and add nothing to our literature. Their great\r\nwork was to train actors, to keep alive the dramatic spirit, and to prepare\r\nthe way for the true drama.\r\n\r\n3. THE ARTISTIC PERIOD OF THE DRAMA. The artistic is the final stage in the\r\ndevelopment of the English drama. It differs radically from the other two\r\nin that its chief purpose is not to point a moral but to represent human\r\nlife as it is. The artistic drama may have purpose, no less than the\r\nMiracle play, but the motive is always subordinate to the chief end of\r\nrepresenting life itself.\r\n\r\nThe first true play in English, with a regular plot, divided into acts and\r\nscenes, is probably the comedy, \"Ralph Royster Doyster.\" It was written by\r\nNicholas Udall, master of Eton, and later of Westminster school, and was\r\nfirst acted by his schoolboys some time before 1556. The story is that of a\r\nconceited fop in love with a widow, who is already engaged to another man.\r\nThe play is an adaptation of the _Miles Gloriosus_, a classic comedy by\r\nPlautus, and the English characters are more or less artificial; but as\r\nfurnishing a model of a clear plot and natural dialogue, the influence of\r\nthis first comedy, with its mixture of classic and English elements, can\r\nhardly be overestimated.\r\n\r\nThe next play, \"Gammer Gurton's Needle\" _(cir_. 1562), is a domestic\r\ncomedy, a true bit of English realism, representing the life of the peasant\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nGammer Gurton is patching the leather breeches of her man Hodge, when Gib,\r\nthe cat, gets into the milk pan. While Gammer chases the cat the family\r\nneedle is lost, a veritable calamity in those days. The whole household is\r\nturned upside down, and the neighbors are dragged into the affair. Various\r\ncomical situations are brought about by Diccon, a thieving vagabond, who\r\ntells Gammer that her neighbor, Dame Chatte, has taken her needle, and who\r\nthen hurries to tell Dame Chatte that she is accused by Gammer of stealing\r\na favorite rooster. Naturally there is a terrible row when the two irate\r\nold women meet and misunderstand each other. Diccon also drags Doctor Rat,\r\nthe curate, into the quarrel by telling him that, if he will but creep into\r\nDame Chatte's cottage by a hidden way, he will find her using the stolen\r\nneedle. Then Diccon secretly warns Dame Chatte that Gammer Gurton's man\r\nHodge is coming to steal her chickens; and the old woman hides in the dark\r\npassage and cudgels the curate soundly with the door bar. All the parties\r\nare finally brought before the justice, when Hodge suddenly and painfully\r\nfinds the lost needle--which is all the while stuck in his leather\r\nbreeches--and the scene ends uproariously for both audience and actors.\r\n\r\nThis first wholly English comedy is full of fun and coarse humor, and is\r\nwonderfully true to the life it represents. It was long attributed to John\r\nStill, afterwards bishop of Bath; but the authorship is now definitely\r\nassigned to William Stevenson.[132] Our earliest edition of the play was\r\nprinted in 1575; but a similar play called \"Dyccon of Bedlam\" was licensed\r\nin 1552, twelve years before Shakespeare's birth.\r\n\r\nTo show the spirit and the metrical form of the play we give a fragment of\r\nthe boy's description of the dullard Hodge trying to light a fire on the\r\nhearth from the cat's eyes, and another fragment of the old drinking song\r\nat the beginning of the second act.\r\n\r\n    At last in a dark corner two sparkes he thought he sees\r\n    Which were, indede, nought els but Gyb our cat's two eyes.\r\n    \"Puffe!\" quod Hodge, thinking therby to have fyre without doubt;\r\n    With that Gyb shut her two eyes, and so the fyre was out.\r\n    And by-and-by them opened, even as they were before;\r\n    With that the sparkes appeared, even as they had done of yore.\r\n    And, even as Hodge blew the fire, as he did thincke,\r\n    Gyb, as she felt the blast, strayght-way began to wyncke,\r\n    Tyll Hodge fell of swering, as came best to his turne,\r\n    The fier was sure bewicht, and therfore wold not burne.\r\n    At last Gyb up the stayers, among the old postes and pinnes,\r\n    And Hodge he hied him after till broke were both his shinnes,\r\n    Cursynge and swering othes, were never of his makyng,\r\n    That Gyb wold fyre the house if that shee were not taken.\r\n\r\n        _Fyrste a Songe:_\r\n    _Backe and syde, go bare, go bare;\r\n      Booth foote and hande, go colde;\r\n    But, bellye, God sende thee good ale ynoughe,\r\n      Whether it be newe or olde_!\r\n    I can not eate but lytle meate,\r\n      My stomacke is not good;\r\n    But sure I thinke that I can dryncke\r\n      With him that weares a hood.\r\n    Thoughe I go bare, take ye no care,\r\n      I am nothinge a-colde,\r\n    I stuffe my skyn so full within\r\n      Of ioly good ale and olde.\r\n    _Backe and syde, go bare_, etc.\r\n\r\nOur first tragedy, \"Gorboduc,\" was written by Thomas Sackville and Thomas\r\nNorton, and was acted in 1562, only two years before the birth of\r\nShakespeare. It is remarkable not only as our first tragedy, but as the\r\nfirst play to be written in blank verse, the latter being most significant,\r\nsince it started the drama into the style of verse best suited to the\r\ngenius of English playwrights.\r\n\r\nThe story of \"Gorboduc\" is taken from the early annals of Britain and\r\nrecalls the story used by Shakespeare in _King Lear_. Gorboduc, king of\r\nBritain, divides his kingdom between his sons Ferrex and Porrex. The sons\r\nquarrel, and Porrex, the younger, slays his brother, who is the queen's\r\nfavorite. Videna, the queen, slays Porrex in revenge; the people rebel and\r\nslay Videna and Gorboduc; then the nobles kill the rebels, and in turn fall\r\nto fighting each other. The line of Brutus being extinct with the death of\r\nGorboduc, the country falls into anarchy, with rebels, nobles, and a\r\nScottish invader all fighting for the right of succession. The curtain\r\nfalls upon a scene of bloodshed and utter confusion.\r\n\r\nThe artistic finish of this first tragedy is marred by the authors' evident\r\npurpose to persuade Elizabeth to marry. It aims to show the danger to which\r\nEngland is exposed by the uncertainty of succession. Otherwise the plan of\r\nthe play follows the classical rule of Seneca. There is very little action\r\non the stage; bloodshed and battle are announced by a messenger; and the\r\nchorus, of four old men of Britain, sums up the situation with a few moral\r\nobservations at the end of each of the first four acts.\r\n\r\nCLASSICAL INFLUENCE UPON THE DRAMA. The revival of Latin literature had a\r\ndecided influence upon the English drama as it developed from the Miracle\r\nplays. In the fifteenth century English teachers, in order to increase the\r\ninterest in Latin, began to let their boys act the plays which they had\r\nread as literature, precisely as our colleges now present Greek or German\r\nplays at the yearly festivals. Seneca was the favorite Latin author, and\r\nall his tragedies were translated into English between 1559 and 1581. This\r\nwas the exact period in which the first English playwrights were shaping\r\ntheir own ideas; but the severe simplicity of the classical drama seemed at\r\nfirst only to hamper the exuberant English spirit. To understand this, one\r\nhas only to compare a tragedy of Seneca or of Euripides with one of\r\nShakespeare, and see how widely the two masters differ in methods.\r\n\r\nIn the classic play the so-called dramatic unities of time, place, and\r\naction were strictly observed. Time and place must remain the same; the\r\nplay could represent a period of only a few hours, and whatever action was\r\nintroduced must take place at the spot where the play began. The\r\ncharacters, therefore, must remain unchanged throughout; there was no\r\npossibility of the child becoming a man, or of the man's growth with\r\nchanging circumstances. As the play was within doors, all vigorous action\r\nwas deemed out of place on the stage, and battles and important events were\r\nsimply announced by a messenger. The classic drama also drew a sharp line\r\nbetween tragedy and comedy, all fun being rigorously excluded from serious\r\nrepresentations.\r\n\r\nThe English drama, on the other hand, strove to represent the whole sweep\r\nof life in a single play. The scene changed rapidly; the same actors\r\nappeared now at home, now at court, now on the battlefield; and vigorous\r\naction filled the stage before the eyes of the spectators. The child of one\r\nact appeared as the man of the next, and the imagination of the spectator\r\nwas called upon to bridge the gaps from place to place and from year to\r\nyear. So the dramatist had free scope to present all life in a single place\r\nand a single hour. Moreover, since the world is always laughing and always\r\ncrying at the same moment, tragedy and comedy were presented side by side,\r\nas they are in life itself. As Hamlet sings, after the play that amused the\r\ncourt but struck the king with deadly fear:\r\n\r\n    Why, let the stricken deer go weep,\r\n    The hart ungalled play;\r\n    For some must watch, while some must sleep:\r\n    So runs the world away.\r\n\r\nNaturally, with these two ideals struggling to master the English drama,\r\ntwo schools of writers arose. The University Two Schools Wits, as men of\r\nlearning were called, generally of Drama upheld the classical ideal, and\r\nridiculed the crude-ness of the new English plays. Sackville and Norton\r\nwere of this class, and \"Gorboduc\" was classic in its construction. In the\r\n\"Defense of Poesie\" Sidney upholds the classics and ridicules the too\r\nambitious scope of the English drama. Against these were the popular\r\nplaywrights, Lyly, Peele, Greene, Marlowe, and many others, who recognized\r\nthe English love of action and disregarded the dramatic unities in their\r\nendeavor to present life as it is. In the end the native drama prevailed,\r\naided by the popular taste which had been trained by four centuries of\r\nMiracles. Our first plays, especially of the romantic type, were extremely\r\ncrude and often led to ridiculously extravagant scenes; and here is where\r\nthe classic drama exercised an immense influence for good, by insisting\r\nupon beauty of form and definiteness of structure at a time when the\r\ntendency was to satisfy a taste for stage spectacles without regard to\r\neither.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1574 a royal permit to Lord Leicester's actors allowed them \"to\r\ngive plays anywhere throughout our realm of England,\" and this must be\r\nregarded as the beginning of the regular drama. Two years later the first\r\nplayhouse, known as \"The Theater,\" was built for these actors by James\r\nBurbage in Finsbury Fields, just north of London. It was in this theater\r\nthat Shakespeare probably found employment when he first came to the city.\r\nThe success of this venture was immediate, and the next thirty years saw a\r\nscore of theatrical companies, at least seven regular theaters, and a dozen\r\nor more inn yards permanently fitted for the giving of plays,--all\r\nestablished in the city and its immediate suburbs. The growth seems all the\r\nmore remarkable when we remember that the London of those days would now be\r\nconsidered a small city, having (in 1600) only about a hundred thousand\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nA Dutch traveler, Johannes de Witt, who visited London in 1596, has given\r\nus the only contemporary drawing we possess of the interior of one of these\r\ntheaters. They were built of stone and wood, round or octagonal in shape,\r\nand without a roof, being simply an inclosed courtyard. At one side was the\r\nstage, and before it on the bare ground, or pit, stood that large part of\r\nthe audience who could afford to pay only an admission fee. The players and\r\nthese groundlings were exposed to the weather; those that paid for seats\r\nwere in galleries sheltered by a narrow porch-roof projecting inwards from\r\nthe encircling walls; while the young nobles and gallants, who came to be\r\nseen and who could afford the extra fee, took seats on the stage itself,\r\nand smoked and chaffed the actors and threw nuts at the groundlings.[133]\r\nThe whole idea of these first theaters, according to De Witt, was like that\r\nof the Roman amphitheater; and the resemblance was heightened by the fact\r\nthat, when no play was on the boards, the stage might be taken away and the\r\npit given over to bull and bear baiting.\r\n\r\nIn all these theaters, probably, the stage consisted of a bare platform,\r\nwith a curtain or \"traverse\" across the middle, separating the front from\r\nthe rear stage. On the latter unexpected scenes or characters were\r\n\"discovered\" by simply drawing the curtain aside. At first little or no\r\nscenery was used, a gilded sign being the only announcement of a change of\r\nscene; and this very lack of scenery led to better acting, since the actors\r\nmust be realistic enough to make the audience forget its shabby\r\nsurroundings.[134] By Shakespeare's day, however, painted scenery had\r\nappeared, first at university plays, and then in the regular theaters.[135]\r\nIn all our first plays female parts were taken by boy actors, who evidently\r\nwere more distressing than the crude scenery, for contemporary literature\r\nhas many satirical references to their acting,[136] and even the tolerant\r\nShakespeare writes:\r\n\r\n    Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, the stage was deemed unfit for women, and actresses\r\nwere unknown in England until after the Restoration.\r\n\r\nSHAKESPEARE'S PREDECESSORS IN THE DRAMA. The English drama as it developed\r\nfrom the Miracle plays has an interesting history. It began with\r\nschoolmasters, like Udall, who translated and adapted Latin plays for their\r\nboys to act, and who were naturally governed by classic ideals. It was\r\ncontinued by the choir masters of St. Paul and the Royal and the Queen's\r\nChapel, whose companies of choir-boy actors were famous in London and\r\nrivaled the players of the regular theaters.[137] These choir masters were\r\nour first stage managers. They began with masques and interludes and the\r\ndramatic presentation of classic myths modeled after the Italians; but some\r\nof them, like Richard Edwards (choir master of the Queen's Chapel in 1561),\r\nsoon added farces from English country life and dramatized some of\r\nChaucer's stories. Finally, the regular playwrights, Kyd, Nash, Lyly,\r\nPeele, Greene, and Marlowe, brought the English drama to the point where\r\nShakespeare began to experiment upon it.\r\n\r\nEach of these playwrights added or emphasized some essential element in the\r\ndrama, which appeared later in the work of Shakespeare. Thus John Lyly\r\n(1554?-1606), who is now known chiefly as having developed the pernicious\r\nliterary style called euphuism,[138] is one of the most influential of the\r\nearly dramatists. His court comedies are remarkable for their witty\r\ndialogue and for being our first plays to aim definitely at unity and\r\nartistic finish. Thomas Kyd's _Spanish Tragedy_ (_c._ 1585) first gives us\r\nthe drama, or rather the melodrama, of passion, copied by Marlowe and\r\nShakespeare. This was the most popular of the early Elizabethan plays; it\r\nwas revised again and again, and Ben Jonson is said to have written one\r\nversion and to have acted the chief part of Hieronimo.[139] And Robert\r\nGreene (1558?-1592) plays the chief part in the early development of\r\nromantic comedy, and gives us some excellent scenes of English country life\r\nin plays like _Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay_.\r\n\r\nEven a brief glance at the life and work of these first playwrights shows\r\nthree noteworthy things which have a bearing on Shakespeare's career: (1)\r\nThese men were usually actors as well as dramatists. They knew the stage\r\nand the audience, and in writing their plays they remembered not only the\r\nactor's part but also the audience's love for stories and brave spectacles.\r\n\"Will it act well, and will it please our audience,\" were the questions of\r\nchief concern to our early dramatists. (2) Their training began as actors;\r\nthen they revised old plays, and finally became independent writers. In\r\nthis their work shows an exact parallel with that of Shakespeare. (3) They\r\noften worked together, probably as Shakespeare worked with Marlowe and\r\nFletcher, either in revising old plays or in creating new ones. They had a\r\ncommon store of material from which they derived their stories and\r\ncharacters, hence their frequent repetition of names; and they often\r\nproduced two or more plays on the same subject. Much of Shakespeare's work\r\ndepends, as we shall see, on previous plays; and even his _Hamlet_ uses the\r\nmaterial of an earlier play of the same name, probably by Kyd, which was\r\nwell known to the London stage in 1589, some twelve years before\r\nShakespeare's great work was written.\r\n\r\nAll these things are significant, if we are to understand the Elizabethan\r\ndrama and the man who brought it to perfection. Shakespeare was not simply\r\na great genius; he was also a great worker, and he developed in exactly the\r\nsame way as did all his fellow craftsmen. And, contrary to the prevalent\r\nopinion, the Elizabethan drama is not a Minerva-like creation, springing\r\nfull grown from the head of one man; it is rather an orderly though rapid\r\ndevelopment, in which many men bore a part. All our early dramatists are\r\nworthy of study for the part they played in the development of the drama;\r\nbut we can here consider only one, the most typical of all, whose best work\r\nis often ranked with that of Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER MARLOWE (1564-1593)\r\n\r\nMarlowe is one of the most suggestive figures of the English Renaissance,\r\nand the greatest of Shakespeare's predecessors. The glory of the\r\nElizabethan drama dates from his _Tamburlaine_ (1587), wherein the whole\r\nrestless temper of the age finds expression:\r\n\r\n    Nature, that framed us of four elements\r\n    Warring within our breasts for regiment,\r\n    Doth teach us all to have aspiring minds:\r\n    Our souls--whose faculties can comprehend\r\n    The wondrous architecture of the world,\r\n    And measure every wandering planet's course,\r\n    Still climbing after knowledge infinite,\r\n    And always moving as the restless spheres--\r\n    Will us to wear ourselves and never rest.\r\n    _Tamburlaine_, Pt. I, II, vii.\r\n\r\nLife. Marlowe was born in Canterbury, only a few months before Shakespeare.\r\nHe was the son of a poor shoemaker, but through the kindness of a patron\r\nwas educated at the town grammar school and then at Cambridge. When he came\r\nto London (_c._ 1584), his soul was surging with the ideals of the\r\nRenaissance, which later found expression in Faustus, the scholar longing\r\nfor unlimited knowledge and for power to grasp the universe. Unfortunately,\r\nMarlowe had also the unbridled passions which mark the early, or Pagan\r\nRenaissance, as Taine calls it, and the conceit of a young man just\r\nentering the realms of knowledge. He became an actor and lived in a\r\nlow-tavern atmosphere of excess and wretchedness. In 1587, when but\r\ntwenty-three years old, he produced _Tamburlaine_, which brought him\r\ninstant recognition. Thereafter, notwithstanding his wretched life, he\r\nholds steadily to a high literary purpose. Though all his plays abound in\r\nviolence, no doubt reflecting many of the violent scenes in which he lived,\r\nhe develops his \"mighty line\" and depicts great scenes in magnificent\r\nbursts of poetry, such as the stage had never heard before. In five years,\r\nwhile Shakespeare was serving his apprenticeship, Marlowe produced all his\r\ngreat work. Then he was stabbed in a drunken brawl and died wretchedly, as\r\nhe had lived. The Epilogue of _Faustus_ might be written across his\r\ntombstone:\r\n\r\n    Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight,\r\n    And burned is Apollo's laurel bough\r\n    That sometime grew within this learnéd man.\r\n\r\nMARLOWE'S WORKS. In addition to the poem \"Hero and Leander,\" to which we\r\nhave referred,[140] Marlowe is famous for four dramas, now known as the\r\nMarlowesque or one-man type of tragedy, each revolving about one central\r\npersonality who is consumed by the lust of power. The first of these is\r\n_Tamburlaine_, the story of Timur the Tartar. Timur begins as a shepherd\r\nchief, who first rebels and then triumphs over the Persian king.\r\nIntoxicated by his success, Timur rushes like a tempest over the whole\r\nEast. Seated on his chariot drawn by captive kings, with a caged emperor\r\nbefore him, he boasts of his power which overrides all things. Then,\r\nafflicted with disease, he raves against the gods and would overthrow them\r\nas he has overthrown earthly rulers. _Tamburlaine_ is an epic rather than a\r\ndrama; but one can understand its instant success with a people only half\r\ncivilized, fond of military glory, and the instant adoption of its \"mighty\r\nline\" as the instrument of all dramatic expression.\r\n\r\n_Faustus_, the second play, is one of the best of Marlowe's works.[141] The\r\nstory is that of a scholar who longs for infinite knowledge, and who turns\r\nfrom Theology, Philosophy, Medicine, and Law, the four sciences of the\r\ntime, to the study of magic, much as a child might turn from jewels to\r\ntinsel and colored paper. In order to learn magic he sells himself to the\r\ndevil, on condition that he shall have twenty-four years of absolute power\r\nand knowledge. The play is the story of those twenty-four years. Like\r\n_Tamburlaine_, it is lacking in dramatic construction,[142] but has an\r\nunusual number of passages of rare poetic beauty. Milton's Satan suggests\r\nstrongly that the author of _Paradise Lost_ had access to _Faustus_ and\r\nused it, as he may also have used _Tamburlaine_, for the magnificent\r\npanorama displayed by Satan in _Paradise Regained_. For instance, more than\r\nfifty years before Milton's hero says, \"Which way I turn is hell, myself am\r\nhell,\" Marlowe had written:\r\n\r\n    _Faust_. How comes it then that thou art out of hell?\r\n    _Mephisto_. Why this is hell, nor am I out of it.\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n        Hell hath no limits, nor is circumscribed\r\n        In one self place; for where we are is hell,\r\n        And where hell is there must we ever be.\r\n\r\nMarlowe's third play is _The Jew of Malta_, a study of the lust for wealth,\r\nwhich centers about Barabas, a terrible old money lender, strongly\r\nsuggestive of Shylock in _The Merchant of Venice_. The first part of the\r\nplay is well constructed, showing a decided advance, but the last part is\r\nan accumulation of melodramatic horrors. Barabas is checked in his\r\nmurderous career by falling into a boiling caldron which he had prepared\r\nfor another, and dies blaspheming, his only regret being that he has not\r\ndone more evil in his life.\r\n\r\nMarlowe's last play is _Edward II_, a tragic study of a king's weakness and\r\nmisery. In point of style and dramatic construction, it is by far the best\r\nof Marlowe's plays, and is a worthy predecessor of Shakespeare's historical\r\ndrama.\r\n\r\nMarlowe is the only dramatist of the time who is ever compared with\r\nShakespeare.[143] When we remember that he died at twenty-nine, probably\r\nbefore Shakespeare had produced a single great play, we must wonder what he\r\nmight have done had he outlived his wretched youth and become a man. Here\r\nand there his work is remarkable for its splendid imagination, for the\r\nstateliness of its verse, and for its rare bits of poetic beauty; but in\r\ndramatic instinct, in wide knowledge of human life, in humor, in\r\ndelineation of woman's character, in the delicate fancy which presents an\r\nAriel as perfectly as a Macbeth,--in a word, in all that makes a dramatic\r\ngenius, Shakespeare stands alone. Marlowe simply prepared the way for the\r\nmaster who was to follow.\r\n\r\nVARIETY OF THE EARLY DRAMA. The thirty years between our first regular\r\nEnglish plays and Shakespeare's first comedy[144] witnessed a development\r\nof the drama which astonishes us both by its rapidity and variety. We shall\r\nbetter appreciate Shakespeare's work if we glance for a moment at the plays\r\nthat preceded him, and note how he covers the whole field and writes almost\r\nevery form and variety of the drama known to his age.\r\n\r\nFirst in importance, or at least in popular interest, are the new Chronicle\r\nplays, founded upon historical events and characters. They show the strong\r\nnational spirit of the Elizabethan Age, and their popularity was due\r\nlargely to the fact that audiences came to the theaters partly to gratify\r\ntheir awakened national spirit and to get their first knowledge of national\r\nhistory. Some of the Moralities, like Bayle's _King Johan_ (1538), are\r\ncrude Chronicle plays, and the early Robin Hood plays and the first\r\ntragedy, _Gorboduc_, show the same awakened popular interest in English\r\nhistory. During the reign of Elizabeth the popular Chronicle plays\r\nincreased till we have the record of over two hundred and twenty, half of\r\nwhich are still extant, dealing with almost every important character, real\r\nor legendary, in English history. Of Shakespeare's thirty-seven dramas, ten\r\nare true Chronicle plays of English kings; three are from the legendary\r\nannals of Britain; and three more are from the history of other nations.\r\n\r\nOther types of the early drama are less clearly defined, but we may sum\r\nthem up under a few general heads: (1) The Domestic Drama began with crude\r\nhome scenes introduced into the Miracles and developed in a score of\r\ndifferent ways, from the coarse humor of _Gammer Gurton's Needle_ to the\r\nComedy of Manners of Jonson and the later dramatists. Shakespeare's _Taming\r\nof the Shrew_ and _Merry Wives of Windsor_ belong to this class. (2) The\r\nso-called Court Comedy is the opposite of the former in that it represented\r\na different kind of life and was intended for a different audience. It was\r\nmarked by elaborate dialogue, by jests, retorts, and endless plays on\r\nwords, rather than by action. It was made popular by Lyly's success, and\r\nwas imitated in Shakespeare's first or \"Lylian\" comedies, such as _Love's\r\nLabour's Lost_, and the complicated _Two Gentlemen of Verona_. (3) Romantic\r\nComedy and Romantic Tragedy suggest the most artistic and finished types of\r\nthe drama, which were experimented upon by Peele, Greene, and Marlowe, and\r\nwere brought to perfection in _The Merchant of Venice, Romeo and Juliet_,\r\nand _The Tempest_. (4) In addition to the above types were several\r\nothers,--the Classical Plays, modeled upon Seneca and favored by cultivated\r\naudiences; the Melodrama, favorite of the groundlings, which depended not\r\non plot or characters but upon a variety of striking scenes and incidents;\r\nand the Tragedy of Blood, always more or less melodramatic, like Kyd's\r\n_Spanish Tragedy_, which grew more blood-and-thundery in Marlowe and\r\nreached a climax of horrors in Shakespeare's _Titus Andronicus_. It is\r\nnoteworthy that _Hamlet, Lear_, and _Macbeth_ all belong to this class, but\r\nthe developed genius of the author raised them to a height such as the\r\nTragedy of Blood had never known before.\r\n\r\nThese varied types are quite enough to show with what doubtful and unguided\r\nexperiments our first dramatists were engaged, like men first setting out\r\nin rafts and dugouts on an unknown sea. They are the more interesting when\r\nwe remember that Shakespeare tried them all; that he is the only dramatist\r\nwhose plays cover the whole range of the drama from its beginning to its\r\ndecline. From the stage spectacle he developed the drama of human life; and\r\ninstead of the doggerel and bombast of our first plays he gives us the\r\npoetry of _Romeo and Juliet_ and _Midsummer Night's Dream_. In a word,\r\nShakespeare brought order out of dramatic chaos. In a few short years he\r\nraised the drama from a blundering experiment to a perfection of form and\r\nexpression which has never since been rivaled.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. SHAKESPEARE\r\n\r\nOne who reads a few of Shakespeare's great plays and then the meager story\r\nof his life is generally filled with a vague wonder. Here is an unknown\r\ncountry boy, poor and poorly educated according to the standards of his\r\nage, who arrives at the great city of London and goes to work at odd jobs\r\nin a theater. In a year or two he is associated with scholars and\r\ndramatists, the masters of their age, writing plays of kings and clowns, of\r\ngentlemen and heroes and noble women, all of whose lives he seems to know\r\nby intimate association. In a few years more he leads all that brilliant\r\ngroup of poets and dramatists who have given undying glory to the Age of\r\nElizabeth. Play after play runs from his pen, mighty dramas of human life\r\nand character following one another so rapidly that good work seems\r\nimpossible; yet they stand the test of time, and their poetry is still\r\nunrivaled in any language. For all this great work the author apparently\r\ncares little, since he makes no attempt to collect or preserve his\r\nwritings. A thousand scholars have ever since been busy collecting,\r\nidentifying, classifying the works which this magnificent workman tossed\r\naside so carelessly when he abandoned the drama and retired to his native\r\nvillage. He has a marvelously imaginative and creative mind; but he invents\r\nfew, if any, new plots or stories. He simply takes an old play or an old\r\npoem, makes it over quickly, and lo! this old familiar material glows with\r\nthe deepest thoughts and the tenderest feelings that ennoble our humanity;\r\nand each new generation of men finds it more wonderful than the last. How\r\ndid he do it? That is still an unanswered question and the source of our\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\nThere are, in general, two theories to account for Shakespeare. The\r\nromantic school of writers have always held that in him \"all came from\r\nwithin\"; that his genius was his sufficient guide; and that to the\r\novermastering power of his genius alone we owe all his great works.\r\nPractical, unimaginative men, on the other hand, assert that in Shakespeare\r\n\"all came from without,\" and that we must study his environment rather than\r\nhis genius, if we are to understand him. He lived in a play-loving age; he\r\nstudied the crowds, gave them what they wanted, and simply reflected their\r\nown thoughts and feelings. In reflecting the English crowd about him he\r\nunconsciously reflected all crowds, which are alike in all ages; hence his\r\ncontinued popularity. And in being guided by public sentiment he was not\r\nsingular, but followed the plain path that every good dramatist has always\r\nfollowed to success.\r\n\r\nProbably the truth of the matter is to be found somewhere between these two\r\nextremes. Of his great genius there can be no question; but there are other\r\nthings to consider. As we have already noticed, Shakespeare was trained,\r\nlike his fellow workmen, first as an actor, second as a reviser of old\r\nplays, and last as an independent dramatist. He worked with other\r\nplaywrights and learned their secret. Like them, he studied and followed\r\nthe public taste, and his work indicates at least three stages, from his\r\nfirst somewhat crude experiments to his finished masterpieces. So it would\r\nseem that in Shakespeare we have the result of hard work and of orderly\r\nhuman development, quite as much as of transcendent genius.\r\n\r\nLIFE (1564-1616). Two outward influences were powerful in developing the\r\ngenius of Shakespeare,--the little village of Stratford, center of the most\r\nbeautiful and romantic district in rural England, and the great city of\r\nLondon, the center of the world's political activity. In one he learned to\r\nknow the natural man in his natural environment; in the other, the social,\r\nthe artificial man in the most unnatural of surroundings.\r\n\r\nFrom the register of the little parish church at Stratford-on-Avon we learn\r\nthat William Shakespeare was baptized there on the twenty-sixth of April,\r\n1564 (old style). As it was customary to baptize children on the third day\r\nafter birth, the twenty-third of April (May 3, according to our present\r\ncalendar) is generally accepted as the poet's birthday.\r\n\r\nHis father, John Shakespeare, was a farmer's son from the neighboring\r\nvillage of Snitterfield, who came to Stratford about 1551, and began to\r\nprosper as a trader in corn, meat, leather, and other agricultural\r\nproducts. His mother, Mary Arden, was the daughter of a prosperous farmer,\r\ndescended from an old Warwickshire family of mixed Anglo-Saxon and Norman\r\nblood. In 1559 this married couple sold a piece of land, and the document\r\nis signed, \"The marke + of John Shacksper. The marke + of Mary Shacksper\";\r\nand from this it has been generally inferred that, like the vast majority\r\nof their countrymen, neither of the poet's parents could read or write.\r\nThis was probably true of his mother; but the evidence from Stratford\r\ndocuments now indicates that his father could write, and that he also\r\naudited the town accounts; though in attesting documents he sometimes made\r\na mark, leaving his name to be filled in by the one who drew up the\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\nOf Shakespeare's education we know little, except that for a few years he\r\nprobably attended the endowed grammar school at Stratford, where he picked\r\nup the \"small Latin and less Greek\" to which his learned friend Ben Jonson\r\nrefers. His real teachers, meanwhile, were the men and women and the\r\nnatural influences which surrounded him. Stratford is a charming little\r\nvillage in beautiful Warwickshire, and near at hand were the Forest of\r\nArden, the old castles of Warwick and Kenilworth, and the old Roman camps\r\nand military roads, to appeal powerfully to the boy's lively imagination.\r\nEvery phase of the natural beauty of this exquisite region is reflected in\r\nShakespeare's poetry; just as his characters reflect the nobility and the\r\nlittleness, the gossip, vices, emotions, prejudices, and traditions of the\r\npeople about him.\r\n\r\n    I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,\r\n    The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,\r\n    With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;\r\n    Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,\r\n    Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste\r\n    Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,\r\n    Told of a many thousand warlike French\r\n    That were embattailed and ranked in Kent.[145]\r\n\r\nSuch passages suggest not only genius but also a keen, sympathetic\r\nobserver, whose eyes see every significant detail. So with the nurse in\r\n_Romeo and Juliet_, whose endless gossip and vulgarity cannot quite hide a\r\nkind heart. She is simply the reflection of some forgotten nurse with whom\r\nShakespeare had talked by the wayside.\r\n\r\nNot only the gossip but also the dreams, the unconscious poetry that sleeps\r\nin the heart of the common people, appeal tremendously to Shakespeare's\r\nimagination and are reflected in his greatest plays. Othello tries to tell\r\na curt soldier's story of his love; but the account is like a bit of\r\nMandeville's famous travels, teeming with the fancies that filled men's\r\nheads when the great round world was first brought to their attention by\r\ndaring explorers. Here is a bit of folklore, touched by Shakespeare's\r\nexquisite fancy, which shows what one boy listened to before the fire at\r\nHalloween:\r\n\r\n                               She comes\r\n    In shape no bigger than an agate-stone\r\n    On the fore-finger of an alderman,\r\n    Drawn with a team of little atomies\r\n    Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;\r\n    Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners' legs,\r\n    The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,\r\n    The traces of the smallest spider's web,\r\n    The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,\r\n    Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,\r\n    Her waggoner a small grey-coated gnat,\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n    Her chariot is an empty hazel nut\r\n    Made by the joiner squirrel, or old grub,\r\n    Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.\r\n    And in this state she gallops night by night\r\n    Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n    O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,\r\n    O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream.[146]\r\n\r\nSo with Shakespeare's education at the hands of Nature, which came from\r\nkeeping his heart as well as his eyes wide open to the beauty of the world.\r\nHe speaks of a horse, and we know the fine points of a thoroughbred; he\r\nmentions the duke's hounds, and we hear them clamoring on a fox trail,\r\ntheir voices matched like bells in the frosty air; he stops for an instant\r\nin the sweep of a tragedy to note a flower, a star, a moonlit bank, a\r\nhilltop touched by the sunrise, and instantly we know what our own hearts\r\nfelt but could not quite express when we saw the same thing. Because he\r\nnotes and remembers every significant thing in the changing panorama of\r\nearth and sky, no other writer has ever approached him in the perfect\r\nnatural setting of his characters.\r\n\r\nWhen Shakespeare was about fourteen years old his father lost his little\r\nproperty and fell into debt, and the boy probably left school to help\r\nsupport the family of younger children. What occupation he followed for the\r\nnext eight years is a matter of conjecture. From evidence found in his\r\nplays, it is alleged with some show of authority that he was a country\r\nschoolmaster and a lawyer's clerk, the character of Holofernes, in _Love's\r\nLabour's Lost_, being the warrant for one, and Shakespeare's knowledge of\r\nlaw terms for the other. But if we take such evidence, then Shakespeare\r\nmust have been a botanist, because of his knowledge of wild flowers; a\r\nsailor, because he knows the ropes; a courtier, because of his\r\nextraordinary facility in quips and compliments and courtly language; a\r\nclown, because none other is so dull and foolish; a king, because Richard\r\nand Henry are true to life; a woman, because he has sounded the depths of a\r\nwoman's feelings; and surely a Roman, because in _Coriolanus_ and _Julius\r\nCæsar_ he has shown us the Roman spirit better than have the Roman writers\r\nthemselves. He was everything, in his imagination, and it is impossible\r\nfrom a study of his scenes and characters to form a definite opinion as to\r\nhis early occupation.\r\n\r\nIn 1582 Shakespeare was married to Anne Hathaway, the daughter of a peasant\r\nfamily of Shottery, who was eight years older than her boy husband. From\r\nnumerous sarcastic references to marriage made by the characters in his\r\nplays, and from the fact that he soon left his wife and family and went to\r\nLondon, it is generally alleged that the marriage was a hasty and unhappy\r\none; but here again the evidence is entirely untrustworthy. In many\r\nMiracles as well as in later plays it was customary to depict the seamy\r\nside of domestic life for the amusement of the crowd; and Shakespeare may\r\nhave followed the public taste in this as he did in other things. The\r\nreferences to love and home and quiet joys in Shakespeare's plays are\r\nenough, if we take such evidence, to establish firmly the opposite\r\nsupposition, that his love was a very happy one. And the fact that, after\r\nhis enormous success in London, he retired to Stratford to live quietly\r\nwith his wife and daughters, tends to the same conclusion.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1587 Shakespeare left his family and went to London and\r\njoined himself to Burbage's company of players. A persistent tradition says\r\nthat he had incurred the anger of Sir Thomas Lucy, first by poaching deer\r\nin that nobleman's park, and then, when haled before a magistrate, by\r\nwriting a scurrilous ballad about Sir Thomas, which so aroused the old\r\ngentleman's ire that Shakespeare was obliged to flee the country. An old\r\nrecord[147] says that the poet \"was much given to all unluckiness in\r\nstealing venison and rabbits,\" the unluckiness probably consisting in\r\ngetting caught himself, and not in any lack of luck in catching the\r\nrabbits. The ridicule heaped upon the Lucy family in _Henry IV_ and the\r\n_Merry Wives of Windsor_ gives some weight to this tradition. Nicholas\r\nRowe, who published the first life of Shakespeare,[148] is the authority\r\nfor this story; but there is some reason to doubt whether, at the time when\r\nShakespeare is said to have poached in the deer park of Sir Thomas Lucy at\r\nCharlescote, there were any deer or park at the place referred to. The\r\nsubject is worthy of some scant attention, if only to show how worthless is\r\nthe attempt to construct out of rumor the story of a great life which,\r\nfortunately perhaps, had no contemporary biographer.\r\n\r\nOf his life in London from 1587 to 1611, the period of his greatest\r\nliterary activity, we know nothing definitely. We can judge only from his\r\nplays, and from these it is evident that he entered into the stirring life\r\nof England's capital with the same perfect sympathy and understanding that\r\nmarked him among the plain people of his native Warwickshire. The first\r\nauthentic reference to him is in 1592, when Greene's[149] bitter attack\r\nappeared, showing plainly that Shakespeare had in five years assumed an\r\nimportant position among playwrights. Then appeared the apology of the\r\npublishers of Greene's pamphlet, with their tribute to the poet's sterling\r\ncharacter, and occasional literary references which show that he was known\r\namong his fellows as \"the gentle Shakespeare.\" Ben Jonson says of him: \"I\r\nloved the man and do honor his memory, on this side idolatry, as much as\r\nany. He was indeed honest, and of an open and free nature.\" To judge from\r\nonly three of his earliest plays[150] it would seem reasonably evident that\r\nin the first five years of his London life he had gained entrance to the\r\nsociety of gentlemen and scholars, had caught their characteristic\r\nmannerisms and expressions, and so was ready by knowledge and observation\r\nas well as by genius to weave into his dramas the whole stirring life of\r\nthe English people. The plays themselves, with the testimony of\r\ncontemporaries and his business success, are strong evidence against the\r\ntradition that his life in London was wild and dissolute, like that of the\r\ntypical actor and playwright of his time.\r\n\r\nShakespeare's first work may well have been that of a general helper, an\r\nodd-job man, about the theater; but he soon became an actor, and the\r\nrecords of the old London theaters show that in the next ten years he\r\ngained a prominent place, though there is little reason to believe that he\r\nwas counted among the \"stars.\" Within two years he was at work on plays,\r\nand his course here was exactly like that of other playwrights of his time.\r\nHe worked with other men, and he revised old plays before writing his own,\r\nand so gained a practical knowledge of his art. _Henry VI _(_c_. 1590-1591)\r\nis an example of this tinkering work, in which, however, his native power\r\nis unmistakably manifest. The three parts of _Henry VI_ (and _Richard III_,\r\nwhich belongs with them) are a succession of scenes from English Chronicle\r\nhistory strung together very loosely; and only in the last is there any\r\ndefinite attempt at unity. That he soon fell under Marlowe's influence is\r\nevident from the atrocities and bombast of _Titus Andronicus_ and _Richard\r\nIII_. The former may have been written by both playwrights in\r\ncollaboration, or may be one of Marlowe's horrors left unfinished by his\r\nearly death and brought to an end by Shakespeare. He soon broke away from\r\nthis apprentice work, and then appeared in rapid succession _Love's\r\nLabour's Lost, Comedy of Errors, Two Gentlemen of Verona_, the first\r\nEnglish Chronicle plays,[151] _A Midsummer Night's Dream_, and _Romeo and\r\nJuliet_. This order is more or less conjectural; but the wide variety of\r\nthese plays, as well as their unevenness and frequent crudities, marks the\r\nfirst or experimental stage of Shakespeare's work. It is as if the author\r\nwere trying his power, or more likely trying the temper of his audience.\r\nFor it must be remembered that to please his audience was probably the\r\nruling motive of Shakespeare, as of the other early dramatists, during the\r\nmost vigorous and prolific period of his career.\r\n\r\nShakespeare's poems, rather than his dramatic work, mark the beginning of\r\nhis success. \"Venus and Adonis\" became immensely popular in London, and its\r\ndedication to the Earl of Southampton brought, according to tradition, a\r\nsubstantial money gift, which may have laid the foundation for\r\nShakespeare's business success. He appears to have shrewdly invested his\r\nmoney, and soon became part owner of the Globe and Blackfriars theaters, in\r\nwhich his plays were presented by his own companies. His success and\r\npopularity grew amazingly. Within a decade of his unnoticed arrival in\r\nLondon he was one of the most famous actors and literary men in England.\r\n\r\nFollowing his experimental work there came a succession of wonderful\r\nplays,--_Merchant of Venice, As You Like It, Twelfth Night, Julius Cæsar,\r\nHamlet, Macbeth, Othello, King Lear, Antony and Cleopatra_. The great\r\ntragedies of this period are associated with a period of gloom and sorrow\r\nin the poet's life; but of its cause we have no knowledge. It may have been\r\nthis unknown sorrow which turned his thoughts back to Stratford and caused,\r\napparently, a dissatisfaction with his work and profession; but the latter\r\nis generally attributed to other causes. Actors and playwrights were in his\r\nday generally looked upon with suspicion or contempt; and Shakespeare, even\r\nin the midst of success, seems to have looked forward to the time when he\r\ncould retire to Stratford to live the life of a farmer and country\r\ngentleman. His own and his father's families were first released from debt;\r\nthen, in 1597, he bought New Place, the finest house in Stratford, and soon\r\nadded a tract of farming land to complete his estate. His profession may\r\nhave prevented his acquiring the title of \"gentleman,\" or he may have only\r\nfollowed a custom of the time[152] when he applied for and obtained a coat\r\nof arms for his father, and so indirectly secured the title by inheritance.\r\nHis home visits grew more and more frequent till, about the year 1611, he\r\nleft London and retired permanently to Stratford.\r\n\r\nThough still in the prime of life, Shakespeare soon abandoned his dramatic\r\nwork for the comfortable life of a country gentleman. Of his later plays,\r\n_Coriolanus, Cymbeline, Winter's Tale_, and _Pericles_ show a decided\r\nfalling off from his previous work, and indicate another period of\r\nexperimentation; this time not to test his own powers but to catch the\r\nfickle humor of the public. As is usually the case with a theater-going\r\npeople, they soon turned from serious drama to sentimental or more\r\nquestionable spectacles; and with Fletcher, who worked with Shakespeare and\r\nsucceeded him as the first playwright of London, the decline of the drama\r\nhad already begun. In 1609, however, occurred an event which gave\r\nShakespeare his chance for a farewell to the public. An English ship\r\ndisappeared, and all on board were given up for lost. A year later the\r\nsailors returned home, and their arrival created intense excitement. They\r\nhad been wrecked on the unknown Bermudas, and had lived there for ten\r\nmonths, terrified by mysterious noises which they thought came from spirits\r\nand devils. Five different accounts of this fascinating shipwreck were\r\npublished, and the Bermudas became known as the \"Ile of Divels.\"\r\nShakespeare took this story--which caused as much popular interest as that\r\nlater shipwreck which gave us _Robinson Crusoe_--and wove it into _The\r\nTempest_. In the same year (1611) he probably sold his interest in the\r\nGlobe and Blackfriars theaters, and his dramatic work was ended. A few\r\nplays were probably left unfinished[153] and were turned over to Fletcher\r\nand other dramatists.\r\n\r\nThat Shakespeare thought little of his success and had no idea that his\r\ndramas were the greatest that the world ever produced seems evident from\r\nthe fact that he made no attempt to collect or publish his works, or even\r\nto save his manuscripts, which were carelessly left to stage managers of\r\nthe theaters, and so found their way ultimately to the ragman. After a few\r\nyears of quiet life, of which we have less record than of hundreds of\r\nsimple country gentlemen of the time, Shakespeare died on the probable\r\nanniversary of his birth, April 23, 1616. He was given a tomb in the\r\nchancel of the parish church, not because of his preëminence in literature,\r\nbut because of his interest in the affairs of a country village. And in the\r\nsad irony of fate, the broad stone that covered his tomb--now an object of\r\nveneration to the thousands that yearly visit the little church--was\r\ninscribed as follows:\r\n\r\n    Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbeare\r\n    To dig the dust enclosed heare;\r\n    Bleste be the man that spares these stones,\r\n    And curst be he that moves my bones.\r\n\r\nThis wretched doggerel, over the world's greatest poet, was intended, no\r\ndoubt, as a warning to some stupid sexton, lest he should empty the grave\r\nand give the honored place to some amiable gentleman who had given more\r\ntithes to the parish.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF SHAKESPEARE. At the time of Shakespeare's death twenty-one plays\r\nexisted in manuscripts in the various theaters. A few others had already\r\nbeen printed in quarto form, and the latter are the only publications that\r\ncould possibly have met with the poet's own approval. More probably they\r\nwere taken down in shorthand by some listener at the play and then\r\n\"pirated\" by some publisher for his own profit. The first printed\r\ncollection of his plays, now called the First Folio (1623), was made by two\r\nactors, Heming and Condell, who asserted that they had access to the papers\r\nof the poet and had made a perfect edition, \"in order to keep the memory of\r\nso worthy a friend and fellow alive.\" This contains thirty-six of the\r\nthirty-seven plays generally attributed to Shakespeare, _Pericles_ being\r\nomitted. This celebrated First Folio was printed from playhouse manuscripts\r\nand from printed quartos containing many notes and changes by individual\r\nactors and stage managers. Moreover, it was full of typographical errors,\r\nthough the editors alleged great care and accuracy; and so, though it is\r\nthe only authoritative edition we have, it is of little value in\r\ndetermining the dates, or the classification of the plays as they existed\r\nin Shakespeare's mind.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this uncertainty, a careful reading of the plays and poems\r\nleaves us with an impression of four different periods of work, probably\r\ncorresponding with the growth and experience of the poet's life. These are:\r\n(1) a period of early experimentation. It is marked by youthfulness and\r\nexuberance of imagination, by extravagance of language, and by the frequent\r\nuse of rimed couplets with his blank verse. The period dates from his\r\narrival in London to 1595. Typical works of this first period are his early\r\npoems, _Love's Labour's Lost, Two Gentlemen of Verona_, and _Richard III_.\r\n(2) A period of rapid growth and development, from 1595 to 1600. Such plays\r\nas _The Merchant of Venice, Midsummer Night's Dream, As You Like It_, and\r\n_Henry IV_, all written in this period, show more careful and artistic\r\nwork, better plots, and a marked increase in knowledge of human nature. (3)\r\nA period of gloom and depression, from 1600 to 1607, which marks the full\r\nmaturity of his powers. What caused this evident sadness is unknown; but it\r\nis generally attributed to some personal experience, coupled with the\r\npolitical misfortunes of his friends, Essex and Southampton. The _Sonnets_\r\nwith their note of personal disappointment, _Twelfth Night_, which is\r\nShakespeare's \"farewell to mirth,\" and his great tragedies, _Hamlet, Lear,\r\nMacbeth, Othello_, and _Julius Cæsar_, belong to this period. (4) A period\r\nof restored serenity, of calm after storm, which marked the last years of\r\nthe poet's literary work. _The Winter's Tale_ and _The Tempest_ are the\r\nbest of his later plays; but they all show a falling off from his previous\r\nwork, and indicate a second period of experimentation with the taste of a\r\nfickle public.\r\n\r\nTo read in succession four plays, taking a typical work from each of the\r\nabove periods, is one of the very best ways of getting quickly at the real\r\nlife and mind of Shakespeare. Following is a complete list with the\r\napproximate dates of his works, classified according to the above four\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nFirst Period, Early Experiment. _Venus and Adonis, Rape of Lucrece_, 1594;\r\n_Titus Andronicus, Henry VI_ (three parts), 1590-1591; _Love's Labour's\r\nLost_, 1590; _Comedy of Errors, Two Gentlemen of Verona_, 1591-1592;\r\n_Richard-III_, 1593; _Richard II, King John_, 1594-1595.\r\n\r\nSecond Period, Development. _Romeo and Juliet, Midsummer Night's Dream_,\r\n1595; _Merchant of Venice, Henry IV_ (first part), 1596; _Henry IV_ (second\r\npart), _Merry Wives of Windsor_, 1597; _Much Ado About Nothing_, 1598; _As\r\nYou Like It, Henry V_, 1599.\r\n\r\nThird Period, Maturity and Gloom. _Sonnets_ (1600-?), _Twelfth Night_,\r\n1600; _Taming of the Shrew, Julius Cæsar, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida_,\r\n1601-1602; _All's Well That Ends Well, Measure for Measure_, 1603;\r\n_Othello_, 1604; _King Lear_, 1605; _Macbeth_, 1606; _Antony and Cleopatra,\r\nTimon of Athens_, 1607.\r\n\r\nFourth Period, Late Experiment. _Coriolanus, Pericles_, 1608; _Cymbeline_,\r\n1609; _Winter's Tale_, 1610-1611; _The Tempest_, 1611; _Henry VIII_\r\n(unfinished).\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION ACCORDING TO SOURCE. In history, legend, and story,\r\nShakespeare found the material for nearly all his dramas; and so they are\r\noften divided into three classes, called historical plays, like _Richard\r\nIII_ and _Henry V;_ legendary or partly historical plays, like _Macbeth,\r\nKing Lear_, and _Julius Cæsar;_ and fictional plays, like _Romeo and\r\nJuliet_ and _The Merchant of Venice_. Shakespeare invented few, if any, of\r\nthe plots or stories upon which his dramas are founded, but borrowed them\r\nfreely, after the custom of his age, wherever he found them. For his\r\nlegendary and historical material he depended, largely on _Holinshed's\r\nChronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland_, and on North's translation\r\nof Plutarch's famous _Lives_.\r\n\r\nA full half of his plays are fictional, and in these he used the most\r\npopular romances of the day, seeming to depend most on the Italian\r\nstory-tellers. Only two or three of his plots, as in _Love's Labour's Lost_\r\nand _Merry Wives of Windsor_, are said to be original, and even these are\r\ndoubtful. Occasionally Shakespeare made over an older play, as in _Henry\r\nVI, Comedy of Errors_, and _Hamlet;_ and in one instance at least he seized\r\nupon an incident of shipwreck in which London was greatly interested, and\r\nmade out of it the original and fascinating play of _The Tempest_, in much\r\nthe same spirit which leads our modern playwrights when they dramatize a\r\npopular novel or a war story to catch the public fancy.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION ACCORDING TO DRAMATIC TYPE. Shakespeare's dramas are usually\r\ndivided into three classes, called tragedies, comedies, and historical\r\nplays. Strictly speaking the drama has but two divisions, tragedy and\r\ncomedy, in which are included the many subordinate forms of tragi-comedy,\r\nmelodrama, lyric drama (opera), farce, etc. A tragedy is a drama in which\r\nthe principal characters are involved in desperate circumstances or led by\r\noverwhelming passions. It is invariably serious and dignified. The movement\r\nis always stately, but grows more and more rapid as it approaches the\r\nclimax; and the end is always calamitous, resulting in death or dire\r\nmisfortune to the principals. As Chaucer's monk says, before he begins to\r\n\"biwayle in maner of tragedie\":\r\n\r\n    Tragedie is to seyn a certeyn storie\r\n    Of him that stood in great prosperitee,\r\n    And is y-fallen out of heigh degree\r\n    Into miserie, and endeth wrecchedly.\r\n\r\nA comedy, on the other hand, is a drama in which the characters are placed\r\nin more or less humorous situations. The movement is light and often\r\nmirthful, and the play ends in general good will and happiness. The\r\nhistorical drama aims to present some historical age or character, and may\r\nbe either a comedy or a tragedy. The following list includes the best of\r\nShakespeare's plays in each of the three classes; but the order indicates\r\nmerely the author's personal opinion of the relative merits of the plays in\r\neach class. Thus _Merchant of Venice_ would be the first of the comedies\r\nfor the beginner to read, and _Julius Cæsar_ is an excellent introduction\r\nto the historical plays and the tragedies.\r\n\r\nComedies. _Merchant of Venice, Midsummer Night's Dream, As You Like It,\r\nWinter's Tale, The Tempest, Twelfth Night_.\r\n\r\nTragedies. _Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, Hamlet, King Lear, Othello_.\r\n\r\nHistorical Plays. _Julius Cæsar, Richard III, Henry IV, Henry V,\r\nCoriolanus, Antony and Cleopatra_.\r\n\r\nDOUBTFUL PLAYS. It is reasonably certain that some of the plays generally\r\nattributed to Shakespeare are partly the work of other dramatists. The\r\nfirst of these doubtful plays, often called the Pre-Shakespearian Group,\r\nare _Titus Andronicus_ and the first part of _Henry VI_. Shakespeare\r\nprobably worked with Marlowe in the two last parts of _Henry VI_ and in\r\n_Richard III_. The three plays, _Taming of the Shrew, Timon_, and\r\n_Pericles_ are only partly Shakespeare's work, but the other authors are\r\nunknown. _Henry VIII_ is the work of Fletcher and Shakespeare, opinion\r\nbeing divided as to whether Shakespeare helped Fletcher, or whether it was\r\nan unfinished work of Shakespeare which was put into Fletcher's hands for\r\ncompletion. _Two Noble Kinsmen_ is a play not ordinarily found in editions\r\nof Shakespeare, but it is often placed among his doubtful works. The\r\ngreater part of the play is undoubtedly by Fletcher. _Edward III_ is one of\r\nseveral crude plays published at first anonymously and later attributed to\r\nShakespeare by publishers who desired to sell their wares. It contains a\r\nfew passages that strongly suggest Shakespeare; but the external evidence\r\nis all against his authorship.\r\n\r\nSHAKESPEARE'S POEMS. It is generally asserted that, if Shakespeare had\r\nwritten no plays, his poems alone would have given him a commanding place\r\nin the Elizabethan Age. Nevertheless, in the various histories of our\r\nliterature there is apparent a desire to praise and pass over all but the\r\n_Sonnets_ as rapidly as possible; and the reason may be stated frankly. His\r\ntwo long poems, \"Venus and Adonis\" and \"The Rape of Lucrece,\" contain much\r\npoetic fancy; but it must be said of both that the subjects are unpleasant,\r\nand that they are dragged out to unnecessary length in order to show the\r\nplay of youthful imagination. They were extremely popular in Shakespeare's\r\nday, but in comparison with his great dramatic works these poems are now of\r\nminor importance.\r\n\r\nShakespeare's _Sonnets_, one hundred and fifty-four in number, are the only\r\ndirect expression of the poet's own feelings that we possess; for his plays\r\nare the most impersonal in all literature. They were published together in\r\n1609; but if they had any unity in Shakespeare's mind, their plan and\r\npurpose are hard to discover. By some critics they are regarded as mere\r\nliterary exercises; by others as the expression of some personal grief\r\nduring the third period of the poet's literary career. Still others, taking\r\na hint from the sonnet beginning \"Two loves I have, of comfort and\r\ndespair,\" divide them all into two classes, addressed to a man who was\r\nShakespeare's friend, and to a woman who disdained his love. The reader may\r\nwell avoid such classifications and read a few sonnets, like the twenty-\r\nninth, for instance, and let them speak their own message. A few are\r\ntrivial and artificial enough, suggesting the elaborate exercises of a\r\npiano player; but the majority are remarkable for their subtle thought and\r\nexquisite expression. Here and there is one, like that beginning\r\n\r\n    When to the sessions of sweet silent thought\r\n    I summon up remembrance of things past,\r\n\r\nwhich will haunt the reader long afterwards, like the remembrance of an old\r\nGerman melody.\r\n\r\nSHAKESPEARE'S PLACE AND INFLUENCE. Shakespeare holds, by general\r\nacclamation, the foremost place in the world's literature, and his\r\noverwhelming greatness renders it difficult to criticise or even to praise\r\nhim. Two poets only, Homer and Dante, have been named with him; but each of\r\nthese wrote within narrow limits, while Shakespeare's genius included all\r\nthe world of nature and of men. In a word, he is the universal poet. To\r\nstudy nature in his works is like exploring a new and beautiful country; to\r\nstudy man in his works is like going into a great city, viewing the motley\r\ncrowd as one views a great masquerade in which past and present mingle\r\nfreely and familiarly, as if the dead were all living again. And the\r\nmarvelous thing, in this masquerade of all sorts and conditions of men, is\r\nthat Shakespeare lifts the mask from every face, lets us see the man as he\r\nis in his own soul, and shows us in each one some germ of good, some \"soul\r\nof goodness\" even in things evil. For Shakespeare strikes no uncertain\r\nnote, and raises no doubts to add to the burden of your own. Good always\r\novercomes evil in the long run; and love, faith, work, and duty are the\r\nfour elements that in all ages make the world right. To criticise or praise\r\nthe genius that creates these men and women is to criticise or praise\r\nhumanity itself.\r\n\r\nOf his influence in literature it is equally difficult to speak. Goethe\r\nexpresses the common literary judgment when he says, \"I do not remember\r\nthat any book or person or event in my life ever made so great an\r\nimpression upon me as the plays of Shakespeare.\" His influence upon our own\r\nlanguage and thought is beyond calculation. Shakespeare and the King James\r\nBible are the two great conservators of the English speech; and one who\r\nhabitually reads them finds himself possessed of a style and vocabulary\r\nthat are beyond criticism. Even those who read no Shakespeare are still\r\nunconsciously guided by him, for his thought and expression have so\r\npervaded our life and literature that it is impossible, so long as one\r\nspeaks the English language, to escape his influence.\r\n\r\n    His life was gentle, and the elements\r\n    So mixed in him, that Nature might stand up\r\n    And say to all the world, \"This was a man!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nV. SHAKESPEARE'S CONTEMPORARIES AND SUCCESSORS IN THE DRAMA\r\n\r\nDECLINE OF THE DRAMA. It was inevitable that the drama should decline after\r\nShakespeare, for the simple reason that there was no other great enough to\r\nfill his place. Aside from this, other causes were at work, and the chief\r\nof these was at the very source of the Elizabethan dramas. It must be\r\nremembered that our first playwrights wrote to please their audiences; that\r\nthe drama rose in England because of the desire of a patriotic people to\r\nsee something of the stirring life of the times reflected on the stage. For\r\nthere were no papers or magazines in those days, and people came to the\r\ntheaters not only to be amused but to be informed. Like children, they\r\nwanted to see a story acted; and like men, they wanted to know what it\r\nmeant. Shakespeare fulfilled their desire. He gave them their story, and\r\nhis genius was great enough to show in every play not only their own life\r\nand passions but something of the meaning of all life, and of that eternal\r\njustice which uses the war of human passions for its own great ends. Thus\r\ngood and evil mingle freely in his dramas; but the evil is never\r\nattractive, and the good triumphs as inevitably as fate. Though his\r\nlanguage is sometimes coarse, we are to remember that it was the custom of\r\nhis age to speak somewhat coarsely, and that in language, as in thought and\r\nfeeling, Shakespeare is far above most of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nWith his successors all this was changed. The audience itself had gradually\r\nchanged, and in place of plain people eager for a story and for\r\ninformation, we see a larger and larger proportion of those who went to the\r\nplay because they had nothing else to do. They wanted amusement only, and\r\nsince they had blunted by idleness the desire for simple and wholesome\r\namusement, they called for something more sensational. Shakespeare's\r\nsuccessors catered to the depraved tastes of this new audience. They lacked\r\nnot only Shakespeare's genius, but his broad charity, his moral insight\r\ninto life. With the exception of Ben Jonson, they neglected the simple fact\r\nthat man in his deepest nature is a moral being, and that only a play which\r\nsatisfies the whole nature of man by showing the triumph of the moral law\r\ncan ever wholly satisfy an audience or a people. Beaumont and Fletcher,\r\nforgetting the deep meaning of life, strove for effect by increasing the\r\nsensationalism of their plays; Webster reveled in tragedies of blood and\r\nthunder; Massinger and Ford made another step downward, producing evil and\r\nlicentious scenes for their own sake, making characters and situations more\r\nimmoral till, notwithstanding these dramatists' ability, the stage had\r\nbecome insincere, frivolous, and bad. Ben Jonson's ode, \"Come Leave the\r\nLoathed Stage,\" is the judgment of a large and honest nature grown weary of\r\nthe plays and the players of the time. We read with a sense of relief that\r\nin 1642, only twenty-six years after Shakespeare's death, both houses of\r\nParliament voted to close the theaters as breeders of lies and immorality.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEN JONSON (1573?-1637)\r\n\r\nPersonally Jonson is the most commanding literary figure among the\r\nElizabethans. For twenty-five years he was the literary dictator of London,\r\nthe chief of all the wits that gathered nightly at the old Devil Tavern.\r\nWith his great learning, his ability, and his commanding position as poet\r\nlaureate, he set himself squarely against his contemporaries and the\r\nromantic tendency of the age. For two things he fought bravely,--to restore\r\nthe classic form of the drama, and to keep the stage from its downward\r\ncourse. Apparently he failed; the romantic school fixed its hold more\r\nstrongly than ever; the stage went swiftly to an end as sad as that of the\r\nearly dramatists. Nevertheless his influence lived and grew more powerful\r\ntill, aided largely by French influence, it resulted in the so-called\r\nclassicism of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Jonson was born at Westminster about the year 1573. His father, an\r\neducated gentleman, had his property confiscated and was himself thrown\r\ninto prison by Queen Mary; so we infer the family was of some prominence.\r\nFrom his mother he received certain strong characteristics, and by a single\r\nshort reference in Jonson's works we are led to see the kind of woman she\r\nwas. It is while Jonson is telling Drummond of the occasion when he was\r\nthrown into prison, because some passages in the comedy of _Eastward Ho!_\r\ngave offense to King James, and he was in danger of a horrible death, after\r\nhaving his ears and nose cut off. He tells us how, after his pardon, he was\r\nbanqueting with his friends, when his \"old mother\" came in and showed a\r\npaper full of \"lusty strong poison,\" which she intended to mix with his\r\ndrink just before the execution. And to show that she \"was no churl,\" she\r\nintended first to drink of the poison herself. The incident is all the more\r\nsuggestive from the fact that Chapman and Marston, one his friend and the\r\nother his enemy, were first cast into prison as the authors of _Eastward\r\nHo!_ and rough Ben Jonson at once declared that he too had had a small hand\r\nin the writing and went to join them in prison.\r\n\r\nJonson's father came out of prison, having given up his estate, and became\r\na minister. He died just before the son's birth, and two years later the\r\nmother married a bricklayer of London. The boy was sent to a private\r\nschool, and later made his own way to Westminster School, where the\r\nsubmaster, Camden, struck by the boy's ability, taught and largely\r\nsupported him. For a short time he may have studied at the university in\r\nCambridge; but his stepfather soon set him to learning the bricklayer's\r\ntrade. He ran away from this, and went with the English army to fight\r\nSpaniards in the Low Countries. His best known exploit there was to fight a\r\nduel between the lines with one of the enemy's soldiers, while both armies\r\nlooked on. Jonson killed his man, and took his arms, and made his way back\r\nto his own lines in a way to delight the old Norman troubadours. He soon\r\nreturned to England, and married precipitately when only nineteen or twenty\r\nyears old. Five years later we find him employed, like Shakespeare, as\r\nactor and reviser of old plays in the theater. Thereafter his life is a\r\nvaried and stormy one. He killed an actor in a duel, and only escaped\r\nhanging by pleading \"benefit of clergy\";[154] but he lost all his poor\r\ngoods and was branded for life on his left thumb. In his first great play,\r\n_Every Man in His Humour_ (1598), Shakespeare acted one of the parts; and\r\nthat may have been the beginning of their long friendship. Other plays\r\nfollowed rapidly. Upon the accession of James, Jonson's masques won him\r\nroyal favor, and he was made poet laureate. He now became undoubted leader\r\nof the literary men of his time, though his rough honesty and his hatred of\r\nthe literary tendencies of the age made him quarrel with nearly all of\r\nthem. In 1616, soon after Shakespeare's retirement, he stopped writing for\r\nthe stage and gave himself up to study and serious work. In 1618 he\r\ntraveled on foot to Scotland, where he visited Drummond, from whom we have\r\nthe scant records of his varied life. His impressions of this journey,\r\ncalled _Foot Pilgrimage_, were lost in a fire before publication.\r\nThereafter he produced less, and his work declined in vigor; but spite of\r\ngrowing poverty and infirmity we notice in his later work, especially in\r\nthe unfinished _Sad Shepherd_, a certain mellowness and tender human\r\nsympathy which were lacking in his earlier productions. He died poverty\r\nstricken in 1637. Unlike Shakespeare's, his death was mourned as a national\r\ncalamity, and he was buried with all honor in Westminster Abbey. On his\r\ngrave was laid a marble slab, on which the words \"O rare Ben Jonson\" were\r\nhis sufficient epitaph.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF BEN JONSON. Jonson's work is in strong contrast with that of\r\nShakespeare and of the later Elizabethan dramatists. Alone he fought\r\nagainst the romantic tendency of the age, and to restore the classic\r\nstandards. Thus the whole action of his drama usually covers only a few\r\nhours, or a single day. He never takes liberties with historical facts, as\r\nShakespeare does, but is accurate to the smallest detail. His dramas abound\r\nin classical learning, are carefully and logically constructed, and comedy\r\nand tragedy are kept apart, instead of crowding each other as they do in\r\nShakespeare and in life. In one respect his comedies are worthy of careful\r\nreading,--they are intensely realistic, presenting men and women of the\r\ntime exactly as they were. From a few of Jonson's scenes we can\r\nunderstand--better than from all the plays of Shakespeare--how men talked\r\nand acted during the Age of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nJonson's first comedy, _Every Man in His Humour_, is a key to all his\r\ndramas. The word \"humour\" in his age stood for some characteristic whim or\r\nquality of society. Jonson gives to his leading character some prominent\r\nhumor, exaggerates it, as the cartoonist enlarges the most characteristic\r\nfeature of a face, and so holds it before our attention that all other\r\nqualities are lost sight of; which is the method that Dickens used later in\r\nmany of his novels. _Every Man in His Humour_ was the first of three\r\nsatires. Its special aim was to ridicule the humors of the city. The\r\nsecond, _Cynthia's Revels_, satirizes the humors of the court; while the\r\nthird, _The Poetaster_, the result of a quarrel with his contemporaries,\r\nwas leveled at the false standards of the poets of the age.\r\n\r\nThe three best known of Jonson's comedies are _Volpone, or the Fox, The\r\nAlchemist_, and _Epicoene, or the Silent Woman. Volpone_ is a keen and\r\nmerciless analysis of a man governed by an overwhelming love of money for\r\nits own sake. The first words in the first scene are a key to the whole\r\ncomedy:\r\n\r\n    _(Volpone)_\r\n        Good morning to the day; and next, my gold!\r\n        Open the shrine that I may see my saint.\r\n            (_Mosca withdraws a curtain and discovers piles of\r\n             gold, plate, jewels, etc._)\r\n        Hail the world's soul, and mine!\r\n\r\nVolpone's method of increasing his wealth is to play upon the avarice of\r\nmen. He pretends to be at the point of death, and his \"suitors,\" who know\r\nhis love of gain and that he has no heirs, endeavor hypocritically to\r\nsweeten his last moments by giving him rich presents, so that he will leave\r\nthem all his wealth. The intrigues of these suitors furnish the story of\r\nthe play, and show to what infamous depths avarice will lead a man.\r\n\r\n_The Alchemist_ is a study of quackery on one side and of gullibility on\r\nthe other, founded on the mediæval idea of the philosopher's stone,[155]\r\nand applies as well to the patent medicines and get-rich-quick schemes of\r\nour day as to the peculiar forms of quackery with which Jonson was more\r\nfamiliar. In plot and artistic construction _The Alchemist_ is an almost\r\nperfect specimen of the best English drama. It has some remarkably good\r\npassages, and is the most readable of Jonson's plays.\r\n\r\n_Epicoene, or the Silent Woman_, is a prose comedy exceedingly well\r\nconstructed, full of life, abounding in fun and unexpected situations. Here\r\nis a brief outline from which the reader may see of what materials Jonson\r\nmade up his comedies.\r\n\r\nThe chief character is Morose, a rich old codger whose humor is a horror of\r\nnoise. He lives in a street so narrow that it will admit no carriages; he\r\npads the doors; plugs the keyhole; puts mattresses on the stairs. He\r\ndismisses a servant who wears squeaky boots; makes all the rest go about in\r\nthick stockings; and they must answer him by signs, since he cannot bear to\r\nhear anybody but himself talk. He disinherits his poor nephew Eugenie, and,\r\nto make sure that the latter will not get any money out of him, resolves to\r\nmarry. His confidant in this delicate matter is Cutbeard the barber, who,\r\nunlike his kind, never speaks unless spoken to, and does not even knick his\r\nscissors as he works. Cutbeard (who is secretly in league with the nephew)\r\ntells him of Epicoene, a rare, silent woman, and Morose is so delighted\r\nwith her silence that he resolves to marry her on the spot. Cutbeard\r\nproduces a parson with a bad cold, who can speak only in a whisper, to\r\nmarry them; and when the parson coughs after the ceremony Morose demands\r\nback five shillings of the fee. To save it the parson coughs more, and is\r\nhurriedly bundled out of the house. The silent woman finds her voice\r\nimmediately after the marriage, begins to talk loudly and to make reforms\r\nin the household, driving Morose to distraction. A noisy dinner party from\r\na neighboring house, with drums and trumpets and a quarreling man and wife,\r\nis skillfully guided in at this moment to celebrate the wedding. Morose\r\nflees for his life, and is found perched like a monkey on a crossbeam in\r\nthe attic, with all his nightcaps tied over his ears. He seeks a divorce,\r\nbut is driven frantic by the loud arguments of a lawyer and a divine, who\r\nare no other than Cutbeard and a sea captain disguised. When Morose is past\r\nall hope the nephew offers to release him from his wife and her noisy\r\nfriends if he will allow him five hundred pounds a year. Morose offers him\r\nanything, everything, to escape his torment, and signs a deed to that\r\neffect. Then comes the surprise of the play when Eugenie whips the wig from\r\nEpicoene and shows a boy in disguise.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the _Silent Woman_, with its rapid action and its\r\nunexpected situations, offers an excellent opportunity for the actors; but\r\nthe reading of the play, as of most of Jonson's comedies, is marred by low\r\nintrigues showing a sad state of morals among the upper classes.\r\n\r\nBesides these, and many other less known comedies, Jonson wrote two great\r\ntragedies, _Sejanus_ (1603) and _Catiline_ (1611), upon severe classical\r\nlines. After ceasing his work for the stage, Jonson wrote many masques in\r\nhonor of James I and of Queen Anne, to be played amid elaborate scenery by\r\nthe gentlemen of the court. The best of these are \"The Satyr,\" \"The\r\nPenates,\" \"Masque of Blackness,\" \"Masque of Beauty,\" \"Hue and Cry after\r\nCupid,\" and \"The Masque of Queens.\" In all his plays Jonson showed a strong\r\nlyric gift, and some of his little poems and songs, like \"The Triumph of\r\nCharis,\" \"Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes,\" and \"To the Memory of my\r\nBeloved Mother,\" are now better known than his great dramatic works. A\r\nsingle volume of prose, called _Timber, or Discoveries made upon Men and\r\nMatter_, is an interesting collection of short essays which are more like\r\nBacon's than any other work of the age.\r\n\r\nBEAUMONT AND FLETCHER. The work of these two men is so closely interwoven\r\nthat, though Fletcher outlived Beaumont by nine years and the latter had no\r\nhand in some forty of the plays that bear their joint names, we still class\r\nthem together, and only scholars attempt to separate their works so as to\r\ngive each writer his due share. Unlike most of the Elizabethan dramatists,\r\nthey both came from noble and cultured families and were university\r\ntrained. Their work, in strong contrast with Jonson's, is intensely\r\nromantic, and in it all, however coarse or brutal the scene, there is\r\nstill, as Emerson pointed out, the subtle \"recognition of gentility.\"\r\n\r\nBeaumont (1584-1616) was the brother of Sir John Beaumont of\r\nLeicestershire. From Oxford he came to London to study law, but soon gave\r\nit up to write for the stage. Fletcher (1579-1625) was the son of the\r\nbishop of London, and shows in all his work the influence of his high\r\nsocial position and of his Cambridge education. The two dramatists met at\r\nthe Mermaid tavern under Ben Jonson's leadership and soon became\r\ninseparable friends, living and working together. Tradition has it that\r\nBeaumont supplied the judgment and the solid work of the play, while\r\nFletcher furnished the high-colored sentiment and the lyric poetry, without\r\nwhich an Elizabethan play would have been incomplete. Of their joint plays,\r\nthe two best known are _Philaster_, whose old theme, like that of\r\n_Cymbeline_ and _Griselda_, is the jealousy of a lover and the faithfulness\r\nof a girl, and _The Maid's Tragedy_. Concerning Fletcher's work the most\r\ninteresting literary question is how much did he write of Shakespeare's\r\n_Henry VIII_, and how much did Shakespeare help him in _The Two Noble\r\nKinsmen_.\r\n\r\nJOHN WEBSTER. Of Webster's personal history we know nothing except that he\r\nwas well known as a dramatist under James I. His extraordinary powers of\r\nexpression rank him with Shakespeare; but his talent seems to have been\r\nlargely devoted to the blood-and-thunder play begun by Marlowe. His two\r\nbest known plays are _The White Devil_ (pub. 1612) and _The Duchess of\r\nMalfi_ (pub. 1623). The latter, spite of its horrors, ranks him as one of\r\nthe greatest masters of English tragedy. It must be remembered that he\r\nsought in this play to reproduce the Italian life of the sixteenth century,\r\nand for this no imaginary horrors are needed. The history of any Italian\r\ncourt or city in this period furnishes more vice and violence and dishonor\r\nthan even the gloomy imagination of Webster could conceive. All the\r\nso-called blood tragedies of the Elizabethan period, from Thomas Kyd's\r\n_Spanish Tragedy_ down, however much they may condemn the brutal taste of\r\nthe English audiences, are still only so many search lights thrown upon a\r\nhistory of horrible darkness.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS MIDDLETON (1570?-1627). Middleton is best known by two great plays,\r\n_The Changeling_[156] and _Women Beware Women_. In poetry and diction they\r\nare almost worthy at times to rank with Shakespeare's plays; otherwise, in\r\ntheir sensationalism and unnaturalness they do violence to the moral sense\r\nand are repulsive to the modern reader. Two earlier plays, _A Trick to\r\ncatch the Old One_, his best comedy, and _A Fair Quarrel_, his earliest\r\ntragedy, are less mature in thought and expression, but more readable,\r\nbecause they seem to express Middleton's own idea of the drama rather than\r\nthat of the corrupt court and playwrights of his later age.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS HEYWOOD (1580?-1650?). Heywood's life, of which we know little in\r\ndetail, covers the whole period of the Elizabethan drama. To the glory of\r\nthat drama he contributed, according to his own statement, the greater\r\npart, at least, of nearly two hundred and twenty plays. It was an enormous\r\namount of work; but he seems to have been animated by the modern literary\r\nspirit of following the best market and striking while the financial iron\r\nis hot. Naturally good work was impossible, even to genius, under such\r\ncircumstances, and few of his plays are now known. The two best, if the\r\nreader would obtain his own idea of Heywood's undoubted ability, are _A\r\nWoman killed with Kindness_, a pathetic story of domestic life, and _The\r\nFair Maid of the West_, a melodrama with plenty of fighting of the popular\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS DEKKER (1570-?). Dekker is in pleasing contrast with most of the\r\ndramatists of the time. All we know of him must be inferred from his works,\r\nwhich show a happy and sunny nature, pleasant and good to meet. The reader\r\nwill find the best expression of Dekker's personality and erratic genius in\r\n_The Shoemakers' Holiday_, a humorous study of plain working people, and\r\n_Old Fortunatus_, a fairy drama of the wishing hat and no end of money.\r\nWhether intended for children or not, it had the effect of charming the\r\nelders far more than the young people, and the play became immensely\r\npopular.\r\n\r\nMASSINGER, FORD, SHIRLEY. These three men mark the end of the Elizabethan\r\ndrama. Their work, done largely while the struggle was on between the\r\nactors and the corrupt court, on one side, and the Puritans on the other,\r\nshows a deliberate turning away not only from Puritan standards but from\r\nthe high ideals of their own art to pander to the corrupt taste of the\r\nupper classes.\r\n\r\nPhilip Massinger (1584-1640) was a dramatic poet of great natural ability;\r\nbut his plots and situations are usually so strained and artificial that\r\nthe modern reader finds no interest in them. In his best comedy, _A New Way\r\nto Pay Old Debts_, he achieved great popularity and gave us one figure, Sir\r\nGiles Overreach, which is one of the typical characters of the English\r\nstage. His best plays are _The Great Duke of Florence, The Virgin Martyr_,\r\nand _The Maid of Honour_.\r\n\r\nJohn Ford (1586-1642?) and James Shirley (1596-1666) have left us little of\r\npermanent literary value, and their works are read only by those who wish\r\nto understand the whole rise and fall of the drama. An occasional scene in\r\nFord's plays is as strong as anything that the Elizabethan Age produced;\r\nbut as a whole the plays are unnatural and tiresome. Probably his best play\r\nis _The Broken Heart_ (1633). Shirley was given to imitation of his\r\npredecessors, and his very imitation is characteristic of an age which had\r\nlost its inspiration. A single play, _Hyde Park_, with its frivolous,\r\nrealistic dialogue, is sometimes read for its reflection of the fashionable\r\ngossipy talk of the day. Long before Shirley's death the actors said,\r\n\"Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone.\" Parliament voted to close the\r\ntheaters, thereby saving the drama from a more inglorious death by\r\ndissipation.[157]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE PROSE WRITERS\r\n\r\nFRANCIS BACON (1561-1626)\r\n\r\nIn Bacon we see one of those complex and contradictory natures which are\r\nthe despair of the biographer. If the writer be an admirer of Bacon, he\r\nfinds too much that he must excuse or pass over in silence; and if he takes\r\nhis stand on the law to condemn the avarice and dishonesty of his subject,\r\nhe finds enough moral courage and nobility to make him question the justice\r\nof his own judgment. On the one hand is rugged Ben Jonson's tribute to his\r\npower and ability, and on the other Hallam's summary that he was \"a man\r\nwho, being intrusted with the highest gifts of Heaven, habitually abused\r\nthem for the poorest purposes of earth--hired them out for guineas,\r\nplaces, and titles in the service of injustice, covetousness, and\r\noppression.\"\r\n\r\nLaying aside the opinions of others, and relying only upon the facts of\r\nBacon's life, we find on the one side the politician, cold, calculating,\r\nselfish, and on the other the literary and scientific man with an\r\nimpressive devotion to truth for its own great sake; here a man using\r\nquestionable means to advance his own interests, and there a man seeking\r\nwith zeal and endless labor to penetrate the secret ways of Nature, with no\r\nother object than to advance the interests of his fellow-men. So, in our\r\nignorance of the secret motives and springs of the man's life, judgment is\r\nnecessarily suspended. Bacon was apparently one of those double natures\r\nthat only God is competent to judge, because of the strange mixture of\r\nintellectual strength and moral weakness that is in them.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Bacon was the son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper of the Seal, and\r\nof the learned Ann Cook, sister-in-law to Lord Burleigh, greatest of the\r\nqueen's statesmen. From these connections, as well as from native gifts, he\r\nwas attracted to the court, and as a child was called by Elizabeth her\r\n\"Little Lord Keeper.\" At twelve he went to Cambridge, but left the\r\nuniversity after two years, declaring the whole plan of education to be\r\nradically wrong, and the system of Aristotle, which was the basis of all\r\nphilosophy in those days, to be a childish delusion, since in the course of\r\ncenturies it had \"produced no fruit, but only a jungle of dry and useless\r\nbranches.\" Strange, even for a sophomore of fourteen, thus to condemn the\r\nwhole system of the universities; but such was the boy, and the system!\r\nNext year, in order to continue his education, he accompanied the English\r\nambassador to France, where he is said to have busied himself chiefly with\r\nthe practical studies of statistics and diplomacy.\r\n\r\nTwo years later he was recalled to London by the death of his father.\r\nWithout money, and naturally with expensive tastes, he applied to his Uncle\r\nBurleigh for a lucrative position. It was in this application that he used\r\nthe expression, so characteristic of the Elizabethan Age, that he \"had\r\ntaken all knowledge for his province.\" Burleigh, who misjudged him as a\r\ndreamer and self-seeker, not only refused to help him at the court but\r\nsuccessfully opposed his advancement by Elizabeth. Bacon then took up the\r\nstudy of law, and was admitted to the bar in 1582. That he had not lost his\r\nphilosophy in the mazes of the law is shown by his tract, written about\r\nthis time, \"On the Greatest Birth of Time,\" which was a plea for his\r\ninductive system of philosophy, reasoning from many facts to one law,\r\nrather than from an assumed law to particular facts, which was the\r\ndeductive method that had been in use for centuries. In his famous plea for\r\nprogress Bacon demanded three things: the free investigation of nature, the\r\ndiscovery of facts instead of theories, and the verification of results by\r\nexperiment rather than by argument. In our day these are the A, B, C of\r\nscience, but in Bacon's time they seemed revolutionary.\r\n\r\nAs a lawyer he became immediately successful; his knowledge and power of\r\npleading became widely known, and it was almost at the beginning of his\r\ncareer that Jonson wrote, \"The fear of every one that heard him speak was\r\nthat he should make an end.\" The publication of his _Essays_ added greatly\r\nto his fame; but Bacon was not content. His head was buzzing with huge\r\nschemes,--the pacification of unhappy Ireland, the simplification of\r\nEnglish law, the reform of the church, the study of nature, the\r\nestablishment of a new philosophy. Meanwhile, sad to say, he played the\r\ngame of politics for his personal advantage. He devoted himself to Essex,\r\nthe young and dangerous favorite of the queen, won his friendship, and then\r\nused him skillfully to better his own position. When the earl was tried for\r\ntreason it was partly, at least, through Bacon's efforts that he was\r\nconvicted and beheaded; and though Bacon claims to have been actuated by a\r\nhigh sense of justice, we are not convinced that he understood either\r\njustice or friendship in appearing as queen's counsel against the man who\r\nhad befriended him. His coldbloodedness and lack of moral sensitiveness\r\nappear even in his essays on \"Love\" and \"Friendship.\" Indeed, we can\r\nunderstand his life only upon the theory that his intellectuality left him\r\ncold and dead to the higher sentiments of our humanity.\r\n\r\nDuring Elizabeth's reign Bacon had sought repeatedly for high office, but\r\nhad been blocked by Burleigh and perhaps also by the queen's own shrewdness\r\nin judging men. With the advent of James I (1603) Bacon devoted himself to\r\nthe new ruler and rose rapidly in favor. He was knighted, and soon\r\nafterwards attained another object of his ambition in marrying a rich wife.\r\nThe appearance of his great work, the _Advancement of Learning_, in 1605,\r\nwas largely the result of the mental stimulus produced by his change in\r\nfortune. In 1613 he was made attorney-general, and speedily made enemies by\r\nusing the office to increase his personal ends. He justified himself in his\r\ncourse by his devotion to the king's cause, and by the belief that the\r\nhigher his position and the more ample his means the more he could do for\r\nscience. It was in this year that Bacon wrote his series of _State Papers_,\r\nwhich show a marvelous grasp of the political tendencies of his age. Had\r\nhis advice been followed, it would have certainly averted the struggle\r\nbetween king and parliament that followed speedily. In 1617 he was\r\nappointed to his father's office, Lord Keeper of the Seal, and the next\r\nyear to the high office of Lord Chancellor. With this office he received\r\nthe title of Baron Verulam, and later of Viscount St. Alban, which he\r\naffixed with some vanity to his literary work. Two years later appeared his\r\ngreatest work, the _Novum Organum_, called after Aristotle's famous\r\n_Organon_.\r\n\r\nBacon did not long enjoy his political honors. The storm which had been\r\nlong gathering against James's government broke suddenly upon Bacon's head.\r\nWhen Parliament assembled in 1621 it vented its distrust of James and his\r\nfavorite Villiers by striking unexpectedly at their chief adviser. Bacon\r\nwas sternly accused of accepting bribes, and the evidence was so great that\r\nhe confessed that there was much political corruption abroad in the land,\r\nthat he was personally guilty of some of it, and he threw himself upon the\r\nmercy of his judges. Parliament at that time was in no mood for mercy.\r\nBacon was deprived of his office and was sentenced to pay the enormous fine\r\nof 40,000 pounds, to be imprisoned during the king's pleasure, and\r\nthereafter to be banished forever from Parliament and court. Though the\r\nimprisonment lasted only a few days and the fine was largely remitted,\r\nBacon's hopes and schemes for political honors were ended; and it is at\r\nthis point of appalling adversity that the nobility in the man's nature\r\nasserts itself strongly. If the reader be interested to apply a great man's\r\nphilosophy to his own life, he will find the essay, \"Of Great Place,\" most\r\ninteresting in this connection.\r\n\r\nBacon now withdrew permanently from public life, and devoted his splendid\r\nability to literary and scientific work. He completed the _Essays_,\r\nexperimented largely, wrote history, scientific articles, and one\r\nscientific novel, and made additions to his _Instauratio Magna_, the great\r\nphilosophical work which was never finished. In the spring of 1626, while\r\ndriving in a snowstorm, it occurred to him that snow might be used as a\r\npreservative instead of salt. True to his own method of arriving at truth,\r\nhe stopped at the first house, bought a fowl, and proceeded to test his\r\ntheory. The experiment chilled him, and he died soon after from the effects\r\nof his exposure. As Macaulay wrote, \"the great apostle of experimental\r\nphilosophy was destined to be its martyr.\"\r\n\r\nWORKS OF BACON. Bacon's philosophic works, _The Advancement of Learning_\r\nand the _Novum Organum_, will be best understood in connection with the\r\n_Instauratio Magna_, or _The Great Institution of True Philosophy_, of\r\nwhich they were parts. The _Instauratio_ was never completed, but the very\r\nidea of the work was magnificent,--to sweep away the involved philosophy of\r\nthe schoolmen and the educational systems of the universities, and to\r\nsubstitute a single great work which should be a complete education, \"a\r\nrich storehouse for the glory of the Creator and for the relief of man's\r\nestate.\" The object of this education was to bring practical results to all\r\nthe people, instead of a little selfish culture and much useless\r\nspeculation, which, he conceived, were the only products of the\r\nuniversities.\r\n\r\nTHE INSTAURATIO MAGNA. This was the most ambitious, though it is not the\r\nbest known, of Bacon's works. For the insight it gives us into the author's\r\nmind, we note here a brief outline of his subject. It was divided into six\r\nparts, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. _Partitiones Scientiarum_. This was to be a classification and summary\r\nof all human knowledge. Philosophy and all speculation must be cast out and\r\nthe natural sciences established as the basis of all education. The only\r\npart completed was _The Advancement of Learning_, which served as an\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\n2. _Novum Organum_, or the \"new instrument,\" that is, the use of reason and\r\nexperiment instead of the old Aristotelian logic. To find truth one must do\r\ntwo things: (_a_) get rid of all prejudices or idols, as Bacon called them.\r\nThese \"idols\" are four: \"idols of the tribe,\" that is, prejudices due to\r\ncommon methods of thought among all races; \"idols of the cave or den,\" that\r\nis, personal peculiarities and prejudices; \"idols of the market place,\" due\r\nto errors of language; and \"idols of the theater,\" which are the unreliable\r\ntraditions of men. (_b_) After discarding the above \"idols\" we must\r\ninterrogate nature; must collect facts by means of numerous experiments,\r\narrange them in order, and then determine the law that underlies them.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen at a glance that the above is the most important of Bacon's\r\nworks. The _Organum_ was to be in several books, only two of which he\r\ncompleted, and these he wrote and rewrote twelve times until they satisfied\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n3. _Historic Naturalis et Experimentalis_, the study of all the phenomena\r\nof nature. Of four parts of this work which he completed, one of them at\r\nleast, the _Sylva Sylvarum_, is decidedly at variance with his own idea of\r\nfact and experiment. It abounds in fanciful explanations, more worthy of\r\nthe poetic than of the scientific mind. Nature is seen to be full of\r\ndesires and instincts; the air \"thirsts\" for light and fragrance; bodies\r\nrise or sink because they have an \"appetite\" for height or depth; the\r\nqualities of bodies are the result of an \"essence,\" so that when we\r\ndiscover the essences of gold and silver and diamonds it will be a simple\r\nmatter to create as much of them as we may need.\r\n\r\n4. _Scala Intellectus_, or \"Ladder of the Mind,\" is the rational\r\napplication of the _Organum_ to all problems. By it the mind should ascend\r\nstep by step from particular facts and instances to general laws and\r\nabstract principles.\r\n\r\n5. _Prodromi_, \"Prophecies or Anticipations,\" is a list of discoveries that\r\nmen shall make when they have applied Bacon's methods of study and\r\nexperimentation.\r\n\r\n6. _Philosophia Secunda_, which was to be a record of practical results of\r\nthe new philosophy when the succeeding ages should have applied it\r\nfaithfully.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to regard even the outline of such a vast work without an\r\ninvoluntary thrill of admiration for the bold and original mind which\r\nconceived it. \"We may,\" said Bacon, \"make no despicable beginnings. The\r\ndestinies of the human race must complete the work ... for upon this will\r\ndepend not only a speculative good but all the fortunes of mankind and all\r\ntheir power.\" There is the unconscious expression of one of the great minds\r\nof the world. Bacon was like one of the architects of the Middle Ages, who\r\ndrew his plans for a mighty cathedral, perfect in every detail from the\r\ndeep foundation stone to the cross on the highest spire, and who gave over\r\nhis plans to the builders, knowing that, in his own lifetime, only one tiny\r\nchapel would be completed; but knowing also that the very beauty of his\r\nplans would appeal to others, and that succeeding ages would finish the\r\nwork which he dared to begin.\r\n\r\nTHE ESSAYS. Bacon's famous _Essays_ is the one work which will interest all\r\nstudents of our literature. His _Instauratio_ was in Latin, written mostly\r\nby paid helpers from short English abstracts. He regarded Latin as the only\r\nlanguage worthy of a great work; but the world neglected his Latin to seize\r\nupon his English,--marvelous English, terse, pithy, packed with thought, in\r\nan age that used endless circumlocutions. The first ten essays, published\r\nin 1597, were brief notebook jottings of Bacon's observations. Their\r\nsuccess astonished the author, but not till fifteen years later were they\r\nrepublished and enlarged. Their charm grew upon Bacon himself, and during\r\nhis retirement he gave more thought to the wonderful language which he had\r\nat first despised as much as Aristotle's philosophy. In 1612 appeared a\r\nsecond edition containing thirty-eight essays, and in 1625, the year before\r\nhis death, he republished the _Essays_ in their present form, polishing and\r\nenlarging the original ten to fifty-eight, covering a wide variety of\r\nsubjects suggested by the life of men around him.\r\n\r\nConcerning the best of these essays there are as many opinions as there are\r\nreaders, and what one gets out of them depends largely upon his own thought\r\nand intelligence. In this respect they are like that Nature to which Bacon\r\ndirected men's thoughts. The whole volume may be read through in an\r\nevening; but after one has read them a dozen times he still finds as many\r\nplaces to pause and reflect as at the first reading. If one must choose out\r\nof such a storehouse, we would suggest \"Studies,\" \"Goodness,\" \"Riches,\"\r\n\"Atheism,\" \"Unity in Religion,\" \"Adversity,\" \"Friendship,\" and \"Great\r\nPlace\" as an introduction to Bacon's worldly-wise philosophy.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS WORKS. Other works of Bacon are interesting as a revelation\r\nof the Elizabethan mind, rather than because of any literary value. _The\r\nNew Atlantis_ is a kind of scientific novel describing another Utopia as\r\nseen by Bacon. The inhabitants of Atlantis have banished Philosophy and\r\napplied Bacon's method of investigating Nature, using the results to better\r\ntheir own condition. They have a wonderful civilization, in which many of\r\nour later discoveries--academies of the sciences, observatories, balloons,\r\nsubmarines, the modification of species, and several others--were\r\nforeshadowed with a strange mixture of cold reason and poetic intuition.\r\n_De Sapientia Veterum_ is a fanciful attempt to show the deep meaning\r\nunderlying ancient myths,--a meaning which would have astonished the myth\r\nmakers themselves. The _History of Henry VII_ is a calm, dispassionate, and\r\nremarkably accurate history, which makes us regret that Bacon did not do\r\nmore historical work. Besides these are metrical versions of certain\r\nPsalms--which are valuable, in view of the controversy anent Shakespeare's\r\nplays, for showing Bacon's utter inability to write poetry--and a large\r\nnumber of letters and state papers showing the range and power of his\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\nBACON'S PLACE AND WORK. Although Bacon was for the greater part of his life\r\na busy man of affairs, one cannot read his work without becoming conscious\r\nof two things,--a perennial freshness, which the world insists upon in all\r\nliterature that is to endure, and an intellectual power which marks him as\r\none of the great minds of the world.\r\n\r\nOf late the general tendency is to give less and less prominence to his\r\nwork in science and philosophy; but criticism of his _Instauratio_, in view\r\nof his lofty aim, is of small consequence. It is true that his \"science\"\r\nto-day seems woefully inadequate; true also that, though he sought to\r\ndiscover truth, he thought perhaps to monopolize it, and so looked with the\r\nsame suspicion upon Copernicus as upon the philosophers. The practical man\r\nwho despises philosophy has simply misunderstood the thing he despises. In\r\nbeing practical and experimental in a romantic age he was not unique, as is\r\noften alleged, but only expressed the tendency of the English mind in all\r\nages. Three centuries earlier the monk Roger Bacon did more practical\r\nexperimenting than the Elizabethan sage; and the latter's famous \"idols\"\r\nare strongly suggestive of the former's \"Four Sources of Human Ignorance.\"\r\nAlthough Bacon did not make any of the scientific discoveries at which he\r\naimed, yet the whole spirit of his work, especially of _the Organum_, has\r\nstrongly influenced science in the direction of accurate observation and of\r\ncarefully testing every theory by practical experiment. \"He that regardeth\r\nthe clouds shall not sow,\" said a wise writer of old; and Bacon turned\r\nmen's thoughts from the heavens above, with which they had been too busy,\r\nto the earth beneath, which they had too much neglected. In an age when men\r\nwere busy with romance and philosophy, he insisted that the first object of\r\neducation is to make a man familiar with his natural environment; from\r\nbooks he turned to men, from theory to fact, from philosophy to nature,--\r\nand that is perhaps his greatest contribution to life and literature. Like\r\nMoses upon Pisgah, he stood high enough above his fellows to look out over\r\na promised land, which his people would inherit, but into which he himself\r\nmight never enter.\r\n\r\nRICHARD HOOKER (1554?-1600) In strong contrast with Bacon is Richard\r\nHooker, one of the greatest prose writers of the Elizabethan Age. One must\r\nread the story of his life, an obscure and lowly life animated by a great\r\nspirit, as told by Izaak Walton, to appreciate the full force of this\r\ncontrast. Bacon took all knowledge for his province, but mastered no single\r\npart of it. Hooker, taking a single theme, the law and practice of the\r\nEnglish Church, so handled it that no scholar even of the present day would\r\ndream of superseding it or of building upon any other foundation than that\r\nwhich Hooker laid down. His one great work is _The Laws of Ecclesiastical\r\nPolity_,[158] a theological and argumentative book; but, entirely apart\r\nfrom its subject, it will be read wherever men desire to hear the power and\r\nstateliness of the English language. Here is a single sentence, remarkable\r\nnot only for its perfect form but also for its expression of the reverence\r\nfor law which lies at the heart of Anglo-Saxon civilization:\r\n\r\nOf law there can be no less acknowledged than that her seat is the bosom of\r\nGod, her voice the harmony of the world; all things in heaven and earth do\r\nher homage; the very least as feeling her care, and the greatest as not\r\nexempted from her power; both angels and men, and creatures of what\r\ncondition soever, though each in different sort and manner, yet all with\r\nuniform consent admiring her as the mother of their peace and joy.\r\n\r\nSIDNEY AND RALEIGH. Among the prose writers of this wonderful literary age\r\nthere are many others that deserve passing notice, though they fall far\r\nbelow the standard of Bacon and Hooker. Sir Philip Sidney (1554-1586), who\r\nhas already been considered as a poet, is quite as well known by his prose\r\nworks, _Arcadia_, a pastoral romance, and the _Defense of Poesie_, one of\r\nour earliest literary essays. Sidney, whom the poet Shelley has eulogized,\r\nrepresents the whole romantic tendency of his age; while Sir Walter Raleigh\r\n(1552?-1618) represents its adventurous spirit and activity. The life of\r\nRaleigh is an almost incomprehensible mixture of the poet, scholar, and\r\nadventurer; now helping the Huguenots or the struggling Dutch in Europe,\r\nand now leading an expedition into the unmapped wilds of the New World;\r\nbusy here with court intrigues, and there with piratical attempts to\r\ncapture the gold-laden Spanish galleons; one moment sailing the high seas\r\nin utter freedom, and the next writing history and poetry to solace his\r\nimprisonment. Such a life in itself is a volume far more interesting than\r\nanything that he wrote. He is the restless spirit of the Elizabethan Age\r\npersonified.\r\n\r\nRaleigh's chief prose works are the _Discoverie of Guiana_, a work which\r\nwould certainly have been interesting enough had he told simply what he\r\nsaw, but which was filled with colonization schemes and visions of an El\r\nDorado to fill the eyes and ears of the credulous; and the _History of the\r\nWorld_, written to occupy his prison hours. The history is a wholly\r\nuntrustworthy account of events from creation to the downfall of the\r\nMacedonian Empire. It is interesting chiefly for its style, which is simple\r\nand dignified, and for the flashes of wit and poetry that break into the\r\nfantastic combination of miracles, traditions, hearsay, and state records\r\nwhich he called history. In the conclusion is the famous apostrophe to\r\nDeath, which suggests what Raleigh might have done had he lived less\r\nstrenuously and written more carefully.\r\n\r\nO eloquent, just, and mighty Death! whom none could advise thou hast\r\npersuaded; what none hath dared thou hast done; and whom all the world hath\r\nflattered thou only hast cast out of the world and despised; thou hast\r\ndrawn together all the star-stretched greatness, all the pride, cruelty,\r\nand ambition of man, and covered it all over with these two narrow words,\r\n_Hic jacet_!\r\n\r\nJOHN FOXE (1516-1587). Foxe will be remembered always for his famous _Book\r\nof Martyrs_, a book that our elders gave to us on Sundays when we were\r\nyoung, thinking it good discipline for us to afflict our souls when we\r\nwanted to be roaming the sunlit fields, or when in our enforced idleness we\r\nwould, if our own taste in the matter had been consulted, have made good\r\nshift to be quiet and happy with _Robinson Crusoe_. So we have a gloomy\r\nmemory of Foxe, and something of a grievance, which prevent a just\r\nappreciation of his worth.\r\n\r\nFoxe had been driven out of England by the Marian persecutions, and in a\r\nwandering but diligent life on the Continent he conceived the idea of\r\nwriting a history of the persecutions of the church from the earliest days\r\nto his own. The part relating to England and Scotland was published, in\r\nLatin, in 1559 under a title as sonorous and impressive as the Roman office\r\nfor the dead,--_Rerum in Ecclesia Gestarum Maximarumque per Europam\r\nPersecutionum Commentarii_. On his return to England Foxe translated this\r\nwork, calling it the _Acts and Monuments_; but it soon became known as the\r\n_Book of Martyrs_, and so it will always be called. Foxe's own bitter\r\nexperience causes him to write with more heat and indignation than his\r\nsaintly theme would warrant, and the \"holy tone\" sometimes spoils a\r\nnarrative that would be impressive in its bare simplicity. Nevertheless the\r\nbook has made for itself a secure place in our literature. It is strongest\r\nin its record of humble men, like Rowland Taylor and Thomas Hawkes, whose\r\nsublime heroism, but for this narrative, would have been lost amid the\r\ngreat names and the great events that fill the Elizabethan Age.\r\n\r\nCAMDEN AND KNOX. Two historians, William Camden and John Knox, stand out\r\nprominently among the numerous historical writers of the age. Camden's\r\n_Britannia_ (1586) is a monumental work, which marks the beginning of true\r\nantiquarian research in the field of history; and his _Annals of Queen\r\nElizabeth_ is worthy of a far higher place than has thus far been given it.\r\nJohn Knox, the reformer, in his _History of the Reformation in Scotland_,\r\nhas some very vivid portraits of his helpers and enemies. The personal and\r\naggressive elements enter too strongly for a work of history; but the\r\nautobiographical parts show rare literary power. His account of his famous\r\ninterview with Mary Queen of Scots is clear-cut as a cameo, and shows the\r\nman's extraordinary power better than a whole volume of biography. Such\r\nscenes make one wish that more of his time had been given to literary work,\r\nrather than to the disputes and troubles of his own Scotch kirk.\r\n\r\nHAKLUYT AND PURCHAS. Two editors of this age have made for themselves an\r\nenviable place in our literature. They are Richard Hakluyt (1552?-1616) and\r\nSamuel Purchas (1575?-1626). Hakluyt was a clergyman who in the midst of\r\nhis little parish set himself to achieve two great patriotic ends,--to\r\npromote the wealth and commerce of his country, and to preserve the memory\r\nof all his countrymen who added to the glory of the realm by their travels\r\nand explorations. To further the first object he concerned himself deeply\r\nwith the commercial interests of the East India Company, with Raleigh's\r\ncolonizing plans in Virginia, and with a translation of De Soto's travels\r\nin America. To further the second he made himself familiar with books of\r\nvoyages in all foreign languages and with the brief reports of explorations\r\nof his own countrymen. His _Principal Navigations, Voyages, and Discoveries\r\nof the English Nation_, in three volumes, appeared first in 1589, and a\r\nsecond edition followed in 1598-1600. The first volume tells of voyages to\r\nthe north; the second to India and the East; the third, which is as large\r\nas the other two, to the New World. With the exception of the very first\r\nvoyage, that of King Arthur to Iceland in 517, which is founded on a myth,\r\nall the voyages are authentic accounts of the explorers themselves, and are\r\nimmensely interesting reading even at the present day. No other book of\r\ntravels has so well expressed the spirit and energy of the English race, or\r\nbetter deserves a place in our literature.\r\n\r\nSamuel Purchas, who was also a clergyman, continued the work of Hakluyt,\r\nusing many of the latter's unpublished manuscripts and condensing the\r\nrecords of numerous other voyages. His first famous book, _Purchas, His\r\nPilgrimage_, appeared in 1613, and was followed by _Hakluytus Posthumus, or\r\nPurchas His Pilgrimes_, in 1625. The very name inclines one to open the\r\nbook with pleasure, and when one follows his inclination--which is, after\r\nall, one of the best guides in literature--he is rarely disappointed.\r\nThough it falls far below the standard of Hakluyt, both in accuracy and\r\nliterary finish, there is still plenty to make one glad that the book was\r\nwritten and that he can now comfortably follow Purchas on his pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS NORTH. Among the translators of the Elizabethan Age Sir Thomas North\r\n(1535?-1601?) is most deserving of notice because of his version of\r\n_Plutarch's Lives_ (1579) from which Shakespeare took the characters and\r\nmany of the incidents for three great Roman plays. Thus in North we read:\r\n\r\nCæsar also had Cassius in great jealousy and suspected him much: whereupon\r\nhe said on a time to his friends: \"What will Cassius do, think ye? I like\r\nnot his pale looks.\" Another time when Cæsar's friends warned him of\r\nAntonius and Dolabella, he answered them again, \"I never reckon of them;\r\nbut these pale-visaged and carrion lean people, I fear them most,\" meaning\r\nBrutus and Cassius.\r\n\r\nShakespeare merely touches such a scene with the magic of his genius, and\r\nhis Cæsar speaks:\r\n\r\n    Let me have men about me that are fat:\r\n    Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights.\r\n    Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look:\r\n    He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.\r\n\r\nA careful reading of North's _Plutarch_ and then of the famous Roman plays\r\nshows to how great an extent Shakespeare was dependent upon his obscure\r\ncontemporary.\r\n\r\nNorth's translation, to which we owe so many heroic models in our\r\nliterature, was probably made not from Plutarch but from Amyot's excellent\r\nFrench translation. Nevertheless he reproduces the spirit of the original,\r\nand notwithstanding our modern and more accurate translations, he remains\r\nthe most inspiring interpreter of the great biographer whom Emerson calls\r\n\"the historian of heroism.\"\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE AGE OF ELIZABETH. This period is generally regarded as the\r\ngreatest in the history of our literature. Historically, we note in this\r\nage the tremendous impetus received from the Renaissance, from the\r\nReformation, and from the exploration of the New World. It was marked by a\r\nstrong national spirit, by patriotism, by religious tolerance, by social\r\ncontent, by intellectual progress, and by unbounded enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nSuch an age, of thought, feeling, and vigorous action, finds its best\r\nexpression in the drama; and the wonderful development of the drama,\r\nculminating in Shakespeare, is the most significant characteristic of the\r\nElizabethan period. Though the age produced some excellent prose works, it\r\nis essentially an age of poetry; and the poetry is remarkable for its\r\nvariety, its freshness, its youthful and romantic feeling. Both the poetry\r\nand the drama were permeated by Italian influence, which was dominant in\r\nEnglish literature from Chaucer to the Restoration. The literature of this\r\nage is often called the literature of the Renaissance, though, as we have\r\nseen, the Renaissance itself began much earlier, and for a century and a\r\nhalf added very little to our literary possessions.\r\n\r\nIn our study of this great age we have noted (1) the Non-dramatic Poets,\r\nthat is, poets who did not write for the stage. The center of this group is\r\nEdmund Spenser, whose _Shepherd's Calendar_ (1579) marked the appearance of\r\nthe first national poet since Chaucer's death in 1400. His most famous work\r\nis _The Faery Queen_. Associated with Spenser are the minor poets, Thomas\r\nSackville, Michael Drayton, George Chapman, and Philip Sidney. Chapman is\r\nnoted for his completion of Marlowe's poem, _Hero and Leander_, and for his\r\ntranslation of Homer's _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_. Sidney, besides his poetry,\r\nwrote his prose romance _Arcadia_, and _The Defense of Poesie_, one of our\r\nearliest critical essays.\r\n\r\n(2) The Rise of the Drama in England; the Miracle plays, Moralities, and\r\nInterludes; our first play, \"Ralph Royster Doyster\"; the first true English\r\ncomedy, \"Gammer Gurton's Needle,\" and the first tragedy, \"Gorboduc\"; the\r\nconflict between classic and native ideals in the English drama.\r\n\r\n(3) Shakespeare's Predecessors, Lyly, Kyd, Nash, Peele, Greene, Marlowe;\r\nthe types of drama with which they experimented,--the Marlowesque, one-man\r\ntype, or tragedy of passion, the popular Chronicle plays, the Domestic\r\ndrama, the Court or Lylian comedy, Romantic comedy and tragedy, Classical\r\nplays, and the Melodrama. Marlowe is the greatest of Shakespeare's\r\npredecessors. His four plays are \"Tamburlaine,\" \"Faustus,\" \"The Jew of\r\nMalta,\" and \"Edward II.\"\r\n\r\n(4) Shakespeare, his life, work, and influence.\r\n\r\n(5) Shakespeare's Successors, Ben Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, Webster,\r\nMiddleton, Heywood, Dekker; and the rapid decline of the drama. Ben Jonson\r\nis the greatest of this group. His chief comedies are \"Every Man in His\r\nHumour,\" \"The Silent Woman,\" and \"The Alchemist\"; his two extant tragedies\r\nare \"Sejanus\" and \"Catiline.\"\r\n\r\n(6) The Prose Writers, of whom Bacon is the most notable. His chief\r\nphilosophical work is the _Instauratio Magna_ (incomplete), which includes\r\n\"The Advancement of Learning\" and the \"Novum Organum\"; but he is known to\r\nliterary readers by his famous _Essays_. Minor prose writers are Richard\r\nHooker, John Foxe, the historians Camden and Knox, the editors Hakluyt and\r\nPurchas, who gave us the stirring records of exploration, and Thomas North,\r\nthe translator of Plutarch's _Lives_.\r\n\r\nSELECTIONS FOR READING. _Spenser_.

HISTORICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nTHE PURITAN MOVEMENT. In its broadest sense the Puritan movement may be\r\nregarded as a second and greater Renaissance, a rebirth of the moral nature\r\nof man following the intellectual awakening of Europe in the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries. In Italy, whose influence had been uppermost in\r\nElizabethan literature, the Renaissance had been essentially pagan and\r\nsensuous. It had hardly touched the moral nature of man, and it brought\r\nlittle relief from the despotism of rulers. One can hardly read the\r\nhorrible records of the Medici or the Borgias, or the political\r\nobservations of Machiavelli, without marveling at the moral and political\r\ndegradation of a cultured nation. In the North, especially among the German\r\nand English peoples, the Renaissance was accompanied by a moral awakening,\r\nand it is precisely that awakening in England, \"that greatest moral and\r\npolitical reform which ever swept over a nation in the short space of half\r\na century,\" which is meant by the Puritan movement. We shall understand it\r\nbetter if we remember that it had two chief objects: the first was personal\r\nrighteousness; the second was civil and religious liberty. In other words,\r\nit aimed to make men honest and to make them free.\r\n\r\nSuch a movement should be cleared of all the misconceptions which have\r\nclung to it since the Restoration, when the very name of Puritan was made\r\nridiculous by the jeers of the gay courtiers of Charles II. Though the\r\nspirit of the movement was profoundly religious, the Puritans were not a\r\nreligious sect; neither was the Puritan a narrow-minded and gloomy\r\ndogmatist, as he is still pictured even in the histories. Pym and Hampden\r\nand Eliot and Milton were Puritans; and in the long struggle for human\r\nliberty there are few names more honored by freemen everywhere. Cromwell\r\nand Thomas Hooker were Puritans; yet Cromwell stood like a rock for\r\nreligious tolerance; and Thomas Hooker, in Connecticut, gave to the world\r\nthe first written constitution, in which freemen, before electing their\r\nofficers, laid down the strict limits of the offices to which they were\r\nelected. That is a Puritan document, and it marks one of the greatest\r\nachievements in the history of government.\r\n\r\nFrom a religious view point Puritanism included all shades of belief. The\r\nname was first given to those who advocated certain changes in the form of\r\nworship of the reformed English Church under Elizabeth; but as the ideal of\r\nliberty rose in men's minds, and opposed to it were the king and his evil\r\ncounselors and the band of intolerant churchmen of whom Laud is the great\r\nexample, then Puritanism became a great national movement. It included\r\nEnglish churchmen as well as extreme Separatists, Calvinists, Covenanters,\r\nCatholic noblemen,--all bound together in resistance to despotism in Church\r\nand State, and with a passion for liberty and righteousness such as the\r\nworld has never since seen. Naturally such a movement had its extremes and\r\nexcesses, and it is from a few zealots and fanatics that most of our\r\nmisconceptions about the Puritans arise. Life was stern in those days, too\r\nstern perhaps, and the intensity of the struggle against despotism made men\r\nnarrow and hard. In the triumph of Puritanism under Cromwell severe laws\r\nwere passed, many simple pleasures were forbidden, and an austere standard\r\nof living was forced upon an unwilling people. So the criticism is made\r\nthat the wild outbreak of immorality which followed the restoration of\r\nCharles was partly due to the unnatural restrictions of the Puritan era.\r\nThe criticism is just; but we must not forget the whole spirit of the\r\nmovement. That the Puritan prohibited Maypole dancing and horse racing is\r\nof small consequence beside the fact that he fought for liberty and\r\njustice, that he overthrew despotism and made a man's life and property\r\nsafe from the tyranny of rulers. A great river is not judged by the foam on\r\nits surface, and certain austere laws and doctrines which we have ridiculed\r\nare but froth on the surface of the mighty Puritan current that has flowed\r\nsteadily, like a river of life, through English and American history since\r\nthe Age of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nCHANGING IDEALS. The political upheaval of the period is summed up in the\r\nterrible struggle between the king and Parliament, which resulted in the\r\ndeath of Charles at the block and the establishment of the Commonwealth\r\nunder Cromwell. For centuries the English people had been wonderfully loyal\r\nto their sovereigns; but deeper than their loyalty to kings was the old\r\nSaxon love for personal liberty. At times, as in the days of Alfred and\r\nElizabeth, the two ideals went hand in hand; but more often they were in\r\nopen strife, and a final struggle for supremacy was inevitable. The crisis\r\ncame when James I, who had received the right of royalty from an act of\r\nParliament, began, by the assumption of \"divine right,\" to ignore the\r\nParliament which had created him. Of the civil war which followed in the\r\nreign of Charles I, and of the triumph of English freedom, it is\r\nunnecessary to write here. The blasphemy of a man's divine right to rule\r\nhis fellow-men was ended. Modern England began with the charge of\r\nCromwell's brigade of Puritans at Naseby.\r\n\r\nReligiously the age was one of even greater ferment than that which marked\r\nthe beginning of the Reformation. A great ideal, the ideal of a national\r\nchurch, was pounding to pieces, like a ship in the breakers, and in the\r\nconfusion of such an hour the action of the various sects was like that of\r\nfrantic passengers, each striving to save his possessions from the wreck.\r\nThe Catholic church, as its name implies, has always held true to the ideal\r\nof a united church, a church which, like the great Roman government of the\r\nearly centuries, can bring the splendor and authority of Rome to bear upon\r\nthe humblest village church to the farthest ends of the earth. For a time\r\nthat mighty ideal dazzled the German and English reformers; but the\r\npossibility of a united Protestant church perished with Elizabeth. Then,\r\ninstead of the world-wide church which was the ideal of Catholicism, came\r\nthe ideal of a purely national Protestantism. This was the ideal of Laud\r\nand the reactionary bishops, no less than of the scholarly Richard Hooker,\r\nof the rugged Scotch Covenanters, and of the Puritans of Massachusetts Bay.\r\nIt is intensely interesting to note that Charles called Irish rebels and\r\nScotch Highlanders to his aid by promising to restore their national\r\nreligions; and that the English Puritans, turning to Scotland for help,\r\nentered into the solemn Covenant of 1643, establishing a national\r\nPresbyterianism, whose object was:\r\n\r\nTo bring the churches of God in the three kingdoms to uniformity in\r\nreligion and government, to preserve the rights of Parliament and the\r\nliberties of the Kingdom; ... that we and our posterity may as brethren\r\nlive in faith and love, and the Lord may delight to live in the midst of\r\nus.\r\n\r\nIn this famous Covenant we see the national, the ecclesiastical, and the\r\npersonal dream of Puritanism, side by side, in all their grandeur and\r\nsimplicity.\r\n\r\nYears passed, years of bitter struggle and heartache, before the\r\nimpossibility of uniting the various Protestant sects was generally\r\nrecognized. The ideal of a national church died hard, and to its death is\r\ndue all the religious unrest of the period. Only as we remember the\r\nnational ideal, and the struggle which it caused, can we understand the\r\namazing life and work of Bunyan, or appreciate the heroic spirit of the\r\nAmerican colonists who left home for a wilderness in order to give the new\r\nideal of a free church in a free state its practical demonstration.\r\n\r\nLITERARY CHARACTERISTICS. In literature also the Puritan Age was one of\r\nconfusion, due to the breaking up of old ideals. Mediaeval standards of\r\nchivalry, the impossible loves and romances of which Spenser furnished the\r\ntypes, perished no less surely than the ideal of a national church; and in\r\nthe absence of any fixed standard of literary criticism there was nothing\r\nto prevent the exaggeration of the \"metaphysical\" poets, who are the\r\nliterary parallels to religious sects like the Anabaptists. Poetry took new\r\nand startling forms in Donne and Herbert, and prose became as somber as\r\nBurton's _Anatomy of Melancholy_. The spiritual gloom which sooner or later\r\nfastens upon all the writers of this age, and which is unjustly attributed\r\nto Puritan influence, is due to the breaking up of accepted standards in\r\ngovernment and religion. No people, from the Greeks to those of our own\r\nday, have suffered the loss of old ideals without causing its writers to\r\ncry, \"Ichabod! the glory has departed.\" That is the unconscious tendency of\r\nliterary men in all times, who look backward for their golden age; and it\r\nneed not concern the student of literature, who, even in the break-up of\r\ncherished institutions, looks for some foregleams of a better light which\r\nis to break upon the world. This so-called gloomy age produced some minor\r\npoems of exquisite workmanship, and one great master of verse whose work\r\nwould glorify any age or people,--John Milton, in whom the indomitable\r\nPuritan spirit finds its noblest expression.\r\n\r\nThere are three main characteristics in which Puritan literature differs\r\nfrom that of the preceding age: (1) Elizabethan literature, with all its\r\ndiversity, had a marked unity in spirit, resulting from the patriotism of\r\nall classes and their devotion to a queen who, with all her faults, sought\r\nfirst the nation's welfare. Under the Stuarts all this was changed. The\r\nkings were the open enemies of the people; the country was divided by the\r\nstruggle for political and religious liberty; and the literature was as\r\ndivided in spirit as were the struggling parties. (2) Elizabethan\r\nliterature is generally inspiring; it throbs with youth and hope and\r\nvitality. That which follows speaks of age and sadness; even its brightest\r\nhours are followed by gloom, and by the pessimism inseparable from the\r\npassing of old standards. (3) Elizabethan literature is intensely romantic;\r\nthe romance springs from the heart of youth, and believes all things, even\r\nthe impossible. The great schoolman's _credo_, \"I believe because it is\r\nimpossible,\" is a better expression of Elizabethan literature than of\r\nmediæval theology. In the literature of the Puritan period one looks in\r\nvain for romantic ardor. Even in the lyrics and love poems a critical,\r\nintellectual spirit takes its place, and whatever romance asserts itself is\r\nin form rather than in feeling, a fantastic and artificial adornment of\r\nspeech rather than the natural utterance of a heart in which sentiment is\r\nso strong and true that poetry is its only expression.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. LITERATURE OF THE PURITAN PERIOD\r\n\r\nTHE TRANSITION POETS. When one attempts to classify the literature of the\r\nfirst half of the seventeenth century, from the death of Elizabeth (1603)\r\nto the Restoration (1660), he realizes the impossibility of grouping poets\r\nby any accurate standard. The classifications attempted here have small\r\ndependence upon dates or sovereigns, and are suggestive rather than\r\naccurate. Thus Shakespeare and Bacon wrote largely in the reign of James I,\r\nbut their work is Elizabethan in spirit; and Bunyan is no less a Puritan\r\nbecause he happened to write after the Restoration. The name Metaphysical\r\npoets, given by Dr. Johnson, is somewhat suggestive but not descriptive of\r\nthe followers of Donne; the name Caroline or Cavalier poets brings to mind\r\nthe careless temper of the Royalists who followed King Charles with a\r\ndevotion of which he was unworthy; and the name Spenserian poets recalls\r\nthe little band of dreamers who clung to Spenser's ideal, even while his\r\nromantic mediæval castle was battered down by Science at the one gate and\r\nPuritanism at the other. At the beginning of this bewildering confusion of\r\nideals expressed in literature, we note a few writers who are generally\r\nknown as Jacobean poets, but whom we have called the Transition poets\r\nbecause, with the later dramatists, they show clearly the changing\r\nstandards of the age.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL DANIEL (1562-1619). Daniel, who is often classed with the first\r\nMetaphysical poets, is interesting to us for two reasons,--for his use of\r\nthe artificial sonnet, and for his literary desertion of Spenser as a model\r\nfor poets. His _Delia_, a cycle of sonnets modeled, perhaps, after Sidney's\r\n_Astrophel and Stella_, helped to fix the custom of celebrating love or\r\nfriendship by a series of sonnets, to which some pastoral pseudonym was\r\naffixed. In his sonnets, many of which rank with Shakespeare's, and in his\r\nlater poetry, especially the beautiful \"Complaint of Rosamond\" and his\r\n\"Civil Wars,\" he aimed solely at grace of expression, and became\r\ninfluential in giving to English poetry a greater individuality and\r\nindependence than it had ever known. In matter he set himself squarely\r\nagainst the mediæval tendency:\r\n\r\n    Let others sing of kings and paladines\r\n    In aged accents and untimely words,\r\n    Paint shadows in imaginary lines.\r\n\r\nThis fling at Spenser and his followers marks the beginning of the modern\r\nand realistic school, which sees in life as it is enough poetic material,\r\nwithout the invention of allegories and impossible heroines. Daniel's\r\npoetry, which was forgotten soon after his death, has received probably\r\nmore homage than it deserves in the praises of Wordsworth, Southey, Lamb,\r\nand Coleridge. The latter says: \"Read Daniel, the admirable Daniel. The\r\nstyle and language are just such as any pure and manly writer of the\r\npresent day would use. It seems quite modern in comparison with the style\r\nof Shakespeare.\"\r\n\r\nTHE SONG WRITERS. In strong contrast with the above are two distinct\r\ngroups, the Song Writers and the Spenserian poets. The close of the reign\r\nof Elizabeth was marked by an outburst of English songs, as remarkable in\r\nits sudden development as the rise of the drama. Two causes contributed to\r\nthis result,--the increasing influence of French instead of Italian verse,\r\nand the rapid development of music as an art at the close of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. The two song writers best worth studying are Thomas Campion\r\n(1567?-1619) and Nicholas Breton (1545?-1626?). Like all the lyric poets of\r\nthe age, they are a curious mixture of the Elizabethan and the Puritan\r\nstandards. They sing of sacred and profane love with the same zest, and a\r\ncareless love song is often found on the same page with a plea for divine\r\ngrace.\r\n\r\nTHE SPENSERIAN POETS. Of the Spenserian poets Giles Fletcher and Wither are\r\nbest worth studying. Giles Fletcher (1588?-1623) has at times a strong\r\nsuggestion of Milton (who was also a follower of Spenser in his early\r\nyears) in the noble simplicity and majesty of his lines. His best known\r\nwork, \"Christ's Victory and Triumph\" (1610), was the greatest religious\r\npoem that had appeared in England since \"Piers Plowman,\" and is not an\r\nunworthy predecessor of _Paradise Lost_.\r\n\r\nThe life of George Wither (1588-1667) covers the whole period of English\r\nhistory from Elizabeth to the Restoration, and the enormous volume of his\r\nwork covers every phase of the literature of two great ages. His life was a\r\nvaried one; now as a Royalist leader against the Covenanters, and again\r\nannouncing his Puritan convictions, and suffering in prison for his faith.\r\nAt his best Wither is a lyric poet of great originality, rising at times to\r\npositive genius; but the bulk of his poetry is intolerably dull. Students\r\nof this period find him interesting as an epitome of the whole age in which\r\nhe lived; but the average reader is more inclined to note with interest\r\nthat he published in 1623 _Hymns and Songs of the Church_, the first hymn\r\nbook that ever appeared in the English language.\r\n\r\nTHE METAPHYSICAL POETS. This name--which was given by Dr. Johnson in\r\nderision, because of the fantastic form of Donne's poetry--is often applied\r\nto all minor poets of the Puritan Age. We use the term here in a narrower\r\nsense, excluding the followers of Daniel and that later group known as the\r\nCavalier poets. It includes Donne, Herbert, Waller, Denham, Cowley,\r\nVaughan, Davenant, Marvell, and Crashaw. The advanced student finds them\r\nall worthy of study, not only for their occasional excellent poetry, but\r\nbecause of their influence on later literature. Thus Richard Crashaw\r\n(1613?-1649), the Catholic mystic, is interesting because his troubled life\r\nis singularly like Donne's, and his poetry is at times like Herbert's set\r\non fire.[160] Abraham Cowley (1618-1667), who blossomed young and who, at\r\ntwenty-five, was proclaimed the greatest poet in England, is now scarcely\r\nknown even by name, but his \"Pindaric Odes\"[161] set an example which\r\ninfluenced English poetry throughout the eighteenth century. Henry Vaughan\r\n(1622-1695) is worthy of study because he is in some respects the\r\nforerunner of Wordsworth;[162] and Andrew Marvell (1621-1678), because of\r\nhis loyal friendship with Milton, and because his poetry shows the conflict\r\nbetween the two schools of Spenser and Donne. Edmund Waller (1606-1687)\r\nstands between the Puritan Age and the Restoration. He was the first to use\r\nconsistently the \"closed\" couplet which dominated our poetry for the next\r\ncentury. By this, and especially by his influence over Dryden, the greatest\r\nfigure of the Restoration, he occupies a larger place in our literature\r\nthan a reading of his rather tiresome poetry would seem to warrant.\r\n\r\nOf all these poets, each of whom has his special claim, we can consider\r\nhere only Donne and Herbert, who in different ways are the types of revolt\r\nagainst earlier forms and standards of poetry. In feeling and imagery both\r\nare poets of a high order, but in style and expression they are the leaders\r\nof the fantastic school whose influence largely dominated poetry during the\r\nhalf century of the Puritan period.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN DONNE (1573-1631)\r\n\r\nLIFE. The briefest outline of Donne's life shows its intense human\r\ninterest. He was born in London, the son of a rich iron merchant, at the\r\ntime when the merchants of England were creating a new and higher kind of\r\nprinces. On his father's side he came from an old Welsh family, and on his\r\nmother's side from the Heywoods and Sir Thomas More's family. Both families\r\nwere Catholic, and in his early life persecution was brought near; for his\r\nbrother died in prison for harboring a proscribed priest, and his own\r\neducation could not be continued in Oxford and Cambridge because of his\r\nreligion. Such an experience generally sets a man's religious standards for\r\nlife; but presently Donne, as he studied law at Lincoln's Inn, was\r\ninvestigating the philosophic grounds of all faith. Gradually he left the\r\nchurch in which he was born, renounced all denominations, and called\r\nhimself simply Christian. Meanwhile he wrote poetry and shared his wealth\r\nwith needy Catholic relatives. He joined the expedition of Essex for Cadiz\r\nin 1596, and for the Azores in 1597, and on sea and in camp found time to\r\nwrite poetry. Two of his best poems, \"The Storm\" and \"The Calm,\" belong to\r\nthis period. Next he traveled in Europe for three years, but occupied\r\nhimself with study and poetry. Returning home, he became secretary to Lord\r\nEgerton, fell in love with the latter's young niece, Anne More, and married\r\nher; for which cause Donne was cast into prison. Strangely enough his\r\npoetical work at this time is not a song of youthful romance, but \"The\r\nProgress of the Soul,\" a study of transmigration. Years of wandering and\r\npoverty followed, until Sir George More forgave the young lovers and made\r\nan allowance to his daughter. Instead of enjoying his new comforts, Donne\r\ngrew more ascetic and intellectual in his tastes. He refused also the\r\nnattering offer of entering the Church of England and of receiving a\r\ncomfortable \"living.\" By his \"Pseudo Martyr\" he attracted the favor of\r\nJames I, who persuaded him to be ordained, yet left him without any place\r\nor employment. When his wife died her allowance ceased, and Donne was left\r\nwith seven children in extreme poverty. Then he became a preacher, rose\r\nrapidly by sheer intellectual force and genius, and in four years was the\r\ngreatest of English preachers and Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral in London.\r\nThere he \"carried some to heaven in holy raptures and led others to amend\r\ntheir lives,\" and as he leans over the pulpit with intense earnestness is\r\nlikened by Izaak Walton to \"an angel leaning from a cloud.\"\r\n\r\nHere is variety enough to epitomize his age, and yet in all his life,\r\nstronger than any impression of outward weal or woe, is the sense of\r\nmystery that surrounds Donne. In all his work one finds a mystery, a hiding\r\nof some deep thing which the world would gladly know and share, and which\r\nis suggested in his haunting little poem, \"The Undertaking\":\r\n\r\n    I have done one braver thing\r\n    Than all the worthies did;\r\n    And yet a braver thence doth spring,\r\n    Which is, to keep that hid.\r\n\r\nDONNE'S POETRY. Donne's poetry is so uneven, at times so startling and\r\nfantastic, that few critics would care to recommend it to others. Only a\r\nfew will read his works, and they must be left to their own browsing, to\r\nfind what pleases them, like deer which, in the midst of plenty, take a\r\nbite here and there and wander on, tasting twenty varieties of food in an\r\nhour's feeding. One who reads much will probably bewail Donne's lack of any\r\nconsistent style or literary standard. For instance, Chaucer and Milton are\r\nas different as two poets could well be; yet the work of each is marked by\r\na distinct and consistent style, and it is the style as much as the matter\r\nwhich makes the _Tales_ or the _Paradise Lost_ a work for all time. Donne\r\nthrew style and all literary standards to the winds; and precisely for this\r\nreason he is forgotten, though his great intellect and his genius had\r\nmarked him as one of those who should do things \"worthy to be remembered.\"\r\nWhile the tendency of literature is to exalt style at the expense of\r\nthought, the world has many men and women who exalt feeling and thought\r\nabove expression; and to these Donne is good reading. Browning is of the\r\nsame school, and compels attention. While Donne played havoc with\r\nElizabethan style, he nevertheless influenced our literature in the way of\r\nboldness and originality; and the present tendency is to give him a larger\r\nplace, nearer to the few great poets, than he has occupied since Ben Jonson\r\ndeclared that he was \"the first poet of the world in some things,\" but\r\nlikely to perish \"for not being understood.\" For to much of his poetry we\r\nmust apply his own satiric verses on another's crudities:\r\n\r\n    Infinite work! which doth so far extend\r\n    That none can study it to any end.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE HERBERT (1593-1633)\r\n\r\n\"O day most calm, most bright,\" sang George Herbert, and we may safely take\r\nthat single line as expressive of the whole spirit of his writings.\r\nProfessor Palmer, whose scholarly edition of this poet's works is a model\r\nfor critics and editors, calls Herbert the first in English poetry who\r\nspoke face to face with God. That may be true; but it is interesting to\r\nnote that not a poet of the first half of the seventeenth century, not even\r\nthe gayest of the Cavaliers, but has written some noble verse of prayer or\r\naspiration, which expresses the underlying Puritan spirit of his age.\r\nHerbert is the greatest, the most consistent of them all. In all the others\r\nthe Puritan struggles against the Cavalier, or the Cavalier breaks loose\r\nfrom the restraining Puritan; but in Herbert the struggle is past and peace\r\nhas come. That his life was not all calm, that the Puritan in him had\r\nstruggled desperately before it subdued the pride and idleness of the\r\nCavalier, is evident to one who reads between his lines:\r\n\r\n    I struck the board and cry'd, No more!\r\n         I will abroad.\r\n    What? Shall I ever sigh and pine?\r\n    My lines and life are free, free as the road,\r\n    Loose as the wind.\r\n\r\nThere speaks the Cavalier of the university and the court; and as one reads\r\nto the end of the little poem, which he calls by the suggestive name of\r\n\"The Collar,\" he may know that he is reading condensed biography.\r\n\r\nThose who seek for faults, for strained imagery and fantastic verse forms\r\nin Herbert's poetry, will find them in abundance; but it will better repay\r\nthe reader to look for the deep thought and fine feeling that are hidden in\r\nthese wonderful religious lyrics, even in those that appear most\r\nartificial. The fact that Herbert's reputation was greater, at times, than\r\nMilton's, and that his poems when published after his death had a large\r\nsale and influence, shows certainly that he appealed to the men of his age;\r\nand his poems will probably be read and appreciated, if only by the few,\r\njust so long as men are strong enough to understand the Puritan's spiritual\r\nconvictions.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Herbert's life is so quiet and uneventful that to relate a few\r\nbiographical facts can be of little advantage. Only as one reads the whole\r\nstory by Izaak Walton can he share the gentle spirit of Herbert's poetry.\r\nHe was born at Montgomery Castle,[163] Wales, 1593, of a noble Welsh\r\nfamily. His university course was brilliant, and after graduation he waited\r\nlong years in the vain hope of preferment at court. All his life he had to\r\nbattle against disease, and this is undoubtedly the cause of the long delay\r\nbefore each new step in his course. Not till he was thirty-seven was he\r\nordained and placed over the little church of Bemerton. How he lived here\r\namong plain people, in \"this happy corner of the Lord's field, hoping all\r\nthings and blessing all people, asking his own way to Sion and showing\r\nothers the way,\" should be read in Walton. It is a brief life, less than\r\nthree years of work before being cut off by consumption, but remarkable for\r\nthe single great purpose and the glorious spiritual strength that shine\r\nthrough physical weakness. Just before his death he gave some manuscripts\r\nto a friend, and his message is worthy of John Bunyan:\r\n\r\nDeliver this little book to my dear brother Ferrar, and tell him he shall\r\nfind in it a picture of the many spiritual conflicts that have passed\r\nbetwixt God and my soul before I could subject mine to the will of Jesus my\r\nmaster, in whose service I have now found perfect freedom. Desire him to\r\nread it; and then, if he can think it may turn to the advantage of any\r\ndejected poor soul, let it be made public; if not, let him burn it, for I\r\nand it are less than the least of God's mercies.\r\n\r\nHERBERT'S POEMS. Herbert's chief work, _The Temple_, consists of over one\r\nhundred and fifty short poems suggested by the Church, her holidays and\r\nceremonials, and the experiences of the Christian life. The first poem,\r\n\"The Church Porch,\" is the longest and, though polished with a care that\r\nforeshadows the classic school, the least poetical. It is a wonderful\r\ncollection of condensed sermons, wise precepts, and moral lessons,\r\nsuggesting Chaucer's \"Good Counsel,\" Pope's \"Essay on Man,\" and Polonius's\r\nadvice to Laertes, in _Hamlet;_ only it is more packed with thought than\r\nany of these. Of truth-speaking he says:\r\n\r\n    Dare to be true. Nothing can need a lie;\r\n    A fault which needs it most grows two thereby.\r\n\r\nand of calmness in argument:\r\n\r\n    Calmness is great advantage: he that lets\r\n    Another chafe may warm him at his fire.\r\n\r\nAmong the remaining poems of _The Temple_ one of the most suggestive is\r\n\"The Pilgrimage.\" Here in six short stanzas, every line close-packed with\r\nthought, we have the whole of Bunyan's _Pilgrim's Progress_. The poem was\r\nwritten probably before Bunyan was born, but remembering the wide influence\r\nof Herbert's poetry, it is an interesting question whether Bunyan received\r\nthe idea of his immortal work from this \"Pilgrimage.\" Probably the best\r\nknown of all his poems is the one called \"The Pulley,\" which generally\r\nappears, however under the name \"Rest,\" or \"The Gifts of God.\"\r\n\r\n     When God at first made man,\r\n    Having a glass of blessings standing by,\r\n    Let us, said he, pour on him all we can:\r\n    Let the world's riches, which dispersed lie,\r\n      Contract into a span.\r\n     So strength first made a way;\r\n    Then beauty flowed; then wisdom, honor, pleasure.\r\n    When almost all was out, God made a stay,\r\n    Perceiving that, alone of all his treasure,\r\n      Rest in the bottom lay.\r\n     For, if I should, said he,\r\n    Bestow this jewel also on my creature,\r\n    He would adore my gifts instead of me,\r\n    And rest in Nature, not the God of Nature:\r\n      So both should losers be.\r\n     Yet let him keep the rest,\r\n    But keep them with repining restlessness:\r\n    Let him be rich and weary, that at least,\r\n    If goodness lead him not, yet weariness\r\n      May toss him to my breast.\r\n\r\nAmong the poems which may be read as curiosities of versification, and\r\nwhich arouse the wrath of the critics against the whole metaphysical\r\nschool, are those like \"Easter Wings\" and \"The Altar,\" which suggest in the\r\nprinted form of the poem the thing of which the poet sings. More ingenious\r\nis the poem in which rime is made by cutting off the first letter of a\r\npreceding word, as in the five stanzas of \"Paradise \":\r\n\r\n    I bless thee, Lord, because I grow\r\n    Among thy trees, which in a row\r\n    To thee both fruit and order ow.\r\n\r\nAnd more ingenious still are odd conceits like the poem \"Heaven,\" in which\r\nEcho, by repeating the last syllable of each line, gives an answer to the\r\npoet's questions.\r\n\r\nTHE CAVALIER POETS. In the literature of any age there are generally found\r\ntwo distinct tendencies. The first expresses the dominant spirit of the\r\ntimes; the second, a secret or an open rebellion. So in this age, side by\r\nside with the serious and rational Puritan, lives the gallant and trivial\r\nCavalier. The Puritan finds expression in the best poetry of the period,\r\nfrom Donne to Milton, and in the prose of Baxter and Bunyan; the Cavalier\r\nin a small group of poets,--Herrick, Lovelace, Suckling, and Carew,--who\r\nwrite songs generally in lighter vein, gay, trivial, often licentious, but\r\nwho cannot altogether escape the tremendous seriousness of Puritanism.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS CAREW (1598?-1639?). Carew may be called the inventor of Cavalier\r\nlove poetry, and to him, more than to any other, is due the peculiar\r\ncombination of the sensual and the religious which marked most of the minor\r\npoets of the seventeenth century. His poetry is the Spenserian pastoral\r\nstripped of its refinement of feeling and made direct, coarse, vigorous.\r\nHis poems, published in 1640, are generally, like his life, trivial or\r\nsensual; but here and there is found one, like the following, which\r\nindicates that with the Metaphysical and Cavalier poets a new and\r\nstimulating force had entered English literature:\r\n\r\n    Ask me no more where Jove bestows,\r\n    When June is past, the fading rose,\r\n    For in your beauty's orient deep\r\n    These flowers, as in their causes, sleep.\r\n    Ask me no more where those stars light\r\n    That downwards fall in dead of night,\r\n    For in your eyes they sit, and there\r\n    Fixèd become as in their sphere.\r\n    Ask me no more if east or west\r\n    The phoenix builds her spicy nest,\r\n    For unto you at last she flies,\r\n    And in your fragrant bosom dies.\r\n\r\nROBERT HERRICK (1591-1674). Herrick is the true Cavalier, gay, devil-may-\r\ncare in disposition, but by some freak of fate a clergyman of Dean Prior,\r\nin South Devon, a county made famous by him and Blackmore. Here, in a\r\ncountry parish, he lived discontentedly, longing for the joys of London and\r\nthe Mermaid Tavern, his bachelor establishment consisting of an old\r\nhousekeeper, a cat, a dog, a goose, a tame lamb, one hen,--for which he\r\nthanked God in poetry because she laid an egg every day,--and a pet pig\r\nthat drank beer with Herrick out of a tankard. With admirable good nature,\r\nHerrick made the best of these uncongenial surroundings. He watched with\r\nsympathy the country life about him and caught its spirit in many lyrics, a\r\nfew of which, like \"Corinna's Maying,\" \"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,\"\r\nand \"To Daffodils,\" are among the best known in our language. His poems\r\ncover a wide range, from trivial love songs, pagan in spirit, to hymns of\r\ndeep religious feeling. Only the best of his poems should be read; and\r\nthese are remarkable for their exquisite sentiment and their graceful,\r\nmelodious expression. The rest, since they reflect something of the\r\ncoarseness of his audience, may be passed over in silence.\r\n\r\nLate in life Herrick published his one book, _Hesperides and Noble Numbers_\r\n(1648). The latter half contains his religious poems, and one has only to\r\nread there the remarkable \"Litany\" to see how the religious terror that\r\nfinds expression in Bunyan's _Grace Abounding_ could master even the most\r\ncareless of Cavalier singers.\r\n\r\nSUCKLING AND LOVELACE. Sir John Suckling (1609-1642) was one of the most\r\nbrilliant wits of the court of Charles I, who wrote poetry as he exercised\r\na horse or fought a duel, because it was considered a gentleman's\r\naccomplishment in those days. His poems, \"struck from his wild life like\r\nsparks from his rapier,\" are utterly trivial, and, even in his best known\r\n\"Ballad Upon a Wedding,\" rarely rise above mere doggerel. It is only the\r\nromance of his life--his rich, brilliant, careless youth, and his poverty\r\nand suicide in Paris, whither he fled because of his devotion to the\r\nStuarts--that keeps his name alive in our literature.\r\n\r\nIn his life and poetry Sir Richard Lovelace (1618-1658) offers a remarkable\r\nparallel to Suckling, and the two are often classed together as perfect\r\nrepresentatives of the followers of King Charles. Lovelace's _Lucasta_, a\r\nvolume of love lyrics, is generally on a higher plane than Suckling's work;\r\nand a few of the poems like \"To Lucasta,\" and \"To Althea, from Prison,\"\r\ndeserve the secure place they have won. In the latter occur the oft-quoted\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n    Stone walls do not a prison make,\r\n      Nor iron bars a cage;\r\n    Minds innocent and quiet take\r\n      That for an hermitage.\r\n    If I have freedom in my love,\r\n      And in my soul am free,\r\n    Angels alone that soar above\r\n      Enjoy such liberty.\r\n\r\nJOHN MILTON (1608-1674)\r\n\r\n    Thy soul was like a star and dwelt apart;\r\n    Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea--\r\n    Pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free;\r\n    So didst thou travel on life's common way\r\n    In cheerful godliness: and yet thy heart\r\n    The lowliest duties on herself did lay.\r\n        (From Wordsworth's \"Sonnet on Milton\")\r\n\r\nShakespeare and Milton are the two figures that tower conspicuously above\r\nthe goodly fellowship of men who have made our literature famous. Each is\r\nrepresentative of the age that produced him, and together they form a\r\nsuggestive commentary upon the two forces that rule our humanity,--the\r\nforce of impulse and the force of a fixed purpose. Shakespeare is the poet\r\nof impulse, of the loves, hates, fears, jealousies, and ambitions that\r\nswayed the men of his age. Milton is the poet of steadfast will and\r\npurpose, who moves like a god amid the fears and hopes and changing\r\nimpulses of the world, regarding them as trivial and momentary things that\r\ncan never swerve a great soul from its course.\r\n\r\nIt is well to have some such comparison in mind while studying the\r\nliterature of the Elizabethan and the Puritan Age. While Shakespeare and\r\nBen Jonson and their unequaled company of wits make merry at the Mermaid\r\nTavern, there is already growing up on the same London street a poet who\r\nshall bring a new force into literature, who shall add to the Renaissance\r\nculture and love of beauty the tremendous moral earnestness of the Puritan.\r\nSuch a poet must begin, as the Puritan always began, with his own soul, to\r\ndiscipline and enlighten it, before expressing its beauty in literature.\r\n\"He that would hope to write well hereafter in laudable things,\" says\r\nMilton, \"ought himself to be a true poem; that is, a composition and\r\npattern of the best and most honorable things.\" Here is a new proposition\r\nin art which suggests the lofty ideal of Fra Angelico, that before one can\r\nwrite literature, which is the expression of the ideal, he must first\r\ndevelop in himself the ideal man. Because Milton is human he must know the\r\nbest in humanity; therefore he studies, giving his days to music, art, and\r\nliterature, his nights to profound research and meditation. But because he\r\nknows that man is more than mortal he also prays, depending, as he tells\r\nus, on \"devout prayer to that Eternal Spirit who can enrich with all\r\nutterance and knowledge.\" Such a poet is already in spirit far beyond the\r\nRenaissance, though he lives in the autumn of its glory and associates with\r\nits literary masters. \"There is a spirit in man,\" says the old Hebrew poet,\r\n\"and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth him understanding.\" Here, in a\r\nword, is the secret of Milton's life and writing. Hence his long silences,\r\nyears passing without a word; and when he speaks it is like the voice of a\r\nprophet who begins with the sublime announcement, \"The Spirit of the Lord\r\nis upon me.\" Hence his style, producing an impression of sublimity, which\r\nhas been marked for wonder by every historian of our literature. His style\r\nwas unconsciously sublime because he lived and thought consciously in a\r\nsublime atmosphere.\r\n\r\nLIFE OF MILTON. Milton is like an ideal in the soul, like a lofty mountain\r\non the horizon. We never attain the ideal; we never climb the mountain; but\r\nlife would be inexpressibly poorer were either to be taken away.\r\n\r\nFrom childhood Milton's parents set him apart for the attainment of noble\r\nends, and so left nothing to chance in the matter of training. His father,\r\nJohn Milton, is said to have turned Puritan while a student at Oxford and\r\nto have been disinherited by his family; whereupon he settled in London and\r\nprospered greatly as a scrivener, that is, a kind of notary. In character\r\nthe elder Milton was a rare combination of scholar and business man, a\r\nradical Puritan in politics and religion, yet a musician, whose hymn tunes\r\nare still sung, and a lover of art and literature. The poet's mother was a\r\nwoman of refinement and social grace, with a deep interest in religion and\r\nin local charities. So the boy grew up in a home which combined the culture\r\nof the Renaissance with the piety and moral strength of early Puritanism.\r\nHe begins, therefore, as the heir of one great age and the prophet of\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nApparently the elder Milton shared Bacon's dislike for the educational\r\nmethods of the time and so took charge of his son's training, encouraging\r\nhis natural tastes, teaching him music, and seeking out a tutor who helped\r\nthe boy to what he sought most eagerly, not the grammar and mechanism of\r\nGreek and Latin but rather the stories, the ideals, the poetry that hide in\r\ntheir incomparable literatures. At twelve years we find the boy already a\r\nscholar in spirit, unable to rest till after midnight because of the joy\r\nwith which his study was rewarded. From boyhood two great principles seem\r\nto govern Milton's career: one, the love of beauty, of music, art,\r\nliterature, and indeed of every form of human culture; the other, a\r\nsteadfast devotion to duty as the highest object in human life.\r\n\r\nA brief course at the famous St. Paul's school in London was the prelude to\r\nMilton's entrance to Christ's College, Cambridge. Here again he followed\r\nhis natural bent and, like Bacon, found himself often in opposition to the\r\nauthorities. Aside from some Latin poems, the most noteworthy song of this\r\nperiod of Milton's life is his splendid ode, '\"On the Morning of Christ's\r\nNativity,\" which was begun on Christmas day, 1629. Milton, while deep in\r\nthe classics, had yet a greater love for his native literature. Spenser was\r\nfor years his master; in his verse we find every evidence of his \"loving\r\nstudy\" of Shakespeare, and his last great poems show clearly how he had\r\nbeen influenced by Fletcher's _Christ's Victory and Triumph_. But it is\r\nsignificant that this first ode rises higher than anything of the kind\r\nproduced in the famous Age of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nWhile at Cambridge it was the desire of his parents that Milton should take\r\norders in the Church of England; but the intense love of mental liberty\r\nwhich stamped the Puritan was too strong within him, and he refused to\r\nconsider the \"oath of servitude,\" as he called it, which would mark his\r\nordination. Throughout his life Milton, though profoundly religious, held\r\naloof from the strife of sects. In belief, he belonged to the extreme\r\nPuritans, called Separatists, Independents, Congregationalists, of which\r\nour Pilgrim Fathers are the great examples; but he refused to be bound by\r\nany creed or church discipline:\r\n\r\n    As ever in my great Task-Master's eye.\r\n\r\nIn this last line of one of his sonnets[164] is found Milton's rejection of\r\nevery form of outward religious authority in face of the supreme Puritan\r\nprinciple, the liberty of the individual soul before God.\r\n\r\nA long period of retirement followed Milton's withdrawal from the\r\nuniversity in 1632. At his father's country home in Horton he gave himself\r\nup for six years to solitary reading and study, roaming over the wide\r\nfields of Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Spanish, French, Italian, and English\r\nliteratures, and studying hard at mathematics, science, theology, and\r\nmusic,--a curious combination. To his love of music we owe the melody of\r\nall his poetry, and we note it in the rhythm and balance which make even\r\nhis mighty prose arguments harmonious. In \"Lycidas,\" \"L'Allegro,\" \"Il\r\nPenseroso,\" \"Arcades,\" \"Comus,\" and a few \"Sonnets,\" we have the poetic\r\nresults of this retirement at Horton,--few, indeed, but the most perfect of\r\ntheir kind that our literature has recorded.\r\n\r\nOut of solitude, where his talent was perfected, Milton entered the busy\r\nworld where his character was to be proved to the utmost. From Horton he\r\ntraveled abroad, through France, Switzerland, and Italy, everywhere\r\nreceived with admiration for his learning and courtesy, winning the\r\nfriendship of the exiled Dutch scholar Grotius, in Paris, and of Galileo in\r\nhis sad imprisonment in Florence.[165] He was on his way to Greece when\r\nnews reached him of the break between king and parliament. With the\r\npractical insight which never deserted him Milton saw clearly the meaning\r\nof the news. His cordial reception in Italy, so chary of praise to anything\r\nnot Italian, had reawakened in Milton the old desire to write an epic which\r\nEngland would \"not willingly let die\"; but at thought of the conflict for\r\nhuman freedom all his dreams were flung to the winds. He gave up his\r\ntravels and literary ambitions and hurried to England. \"For I thought it\r\nbase,\" he says, \"to be traveling at my ease for intellectual culture while\r\nmy fellow-countrymen at home were fighting for liberty.\"\r\n\r\nThen for nearly twenty years the poet of great achievement and still\r\ngreater promise disappears. We hear no more songs, but only the prose\r\ndenunciations and arguments which are as remarkable as his poetry. In all\r\nour literature there is nothing more worthy of the Puritan spirit than this\r\nlaying aside of personal ambitions in order to join in the struggle for\r\nhuman liberty. In his best known sonnet, \"On His Blindness,\" which reflects\r\nhis grief, not at darkness, but at his abandoned dreams, we catch the\r\nsublime spirit of this renunciation.\r\n\r\nMilton's opportunity to serve came in the crisis of 1649. The king had been\r\nsent to the scaffold, paying the penalty of his own treachery, and England\r\nsat shivering at its own deed, like a child or a Russian peasant who in\r\nsudden passion resists unbearable brutality and then is afraid of the\r\nconsequences. Two weeks of anxiety, of terror and silence followed; then\r\nappeared Milton's _Tenure of Kings and Magistrates_. To England it was like\r\nthe coming of a strong man, not only to protect the child, but to justify\r\nhis blow for liberty. Kings no less than people are subject to the eternal\r\nprinciple of law; the divine right of a people to defend and protect\r\nthemselves,--that was the mighty argument which calmed a people's dread and\r\nproclaimed that a new man and a new principle had arisen in England. Milton\r\nwas called to be Secretary for Foreign Tongues in the new government; and\r\nfor the next few years, until the end of the Commonwealth, there were two\r\nleaders in England, Cromwell the man of action, Milton the man of thought.\r\nIt is doubtful to which of the two humanity owes most for its emancipation\r\nfrom the tyranny of kings and prelates.\r\n\r\nTwo things of personal interest deserve mention in this period of Milton's\r\nlife, his marriage and his blindness. In 1643 he married Mary Powell, a\r\nshallow, pleasure-loving girl, the daughter of a Royalist; and that was the\r\nbeginning of sorrows. After a month, tiring of the austere life of a\r\nPuritan household, she abandoned her husband, who, with the same radical\r\nreasoning with which he dealt with affairs of state, promptly repudiated\r\nthe marriage. His _Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce_ and his\r\n_Tetrachordon_ are the arguments to justify his position; but they aroused\r\na storm of protest in England, and they suggest to a modern reader that\r\nMilton was perhaps as much to blame as his wife, and that he had scant\r\nunderstanding of a woman's nature. When his wife, fearing for her position,\r\nappeared before him in tears, all his ponderous arguments were swept aside\r\nby a generous impulse; and though the marriage was never a happy one,\r\nMilton never again mentioned his wife's desertion. The scene in _Paradise\r\nLost_, where Eve comes weeping to Adam, seeking peace and pardon, is\r\nprobably a reflection of a scene in Milton's own household. His wife died\r\nin 1653, and a few years later he married another, whom we remember for the\r\nsonnet, \"Methought I saw my late espoused saint,\" in which she is\r\ncelebrated. She died after fifteen months, and in 1663 he married a third\r\nwife, who helped the blind old man to manage his poor household.\r\n\r\nFrom boyhood the strain on the poet's eyes had grown more and more severe;\r\nbut even when his sight was threatened he held steadily to his purpose of\r\nusing his pen in the service of his country. During the king's imprisonment\r\na book appeared called _Eikon Basilike_ (Royal Image), giving a rosy\r\npicture of the king's piety, and condemning the Puritans. The book speedily\r\nbecame famous and was the source of all Royalist arguments against the\r\nCommonwealth. In 1649 appeared Milton's _Eikonoklastes_ (Image Breaker),\r\nwhich demolished the flimsy arguments of the _Eikon Basilike_ as a charge\r\nof Cromwell's Ironsides had overwhelmed the king's followers. After the\r\nexecution of the king appeared another famous attack upon the Puritans,\r\n_Defensio Regia pro Carlo I_, instigated by Charles II, who was then living\r\nin exile. It was written in Latin by Salmasius, a Dutch professor at\r\nLeyden, and was hailed by the Royalists as an invincible argument. By order\r\nof the Council of State Milton prepared a reply. His eyesight had sadly\r\nfailed, and he was warned that any further strain would be disastrous. His\r\nreply was characteristic of the man and the Puritan. As he had once\r\nsacrificed his poetry, so he was now ready, he said, to sacrifice his eyes\r\nalso on the altar of English liberty. His magnificent _Defensio pro Populo\r\nAnglicano_ is one of the most masterly controversial works in literature.\r\nThe power of the press was already strongly felt in England, and the new\r\nCommonwealth owed its standing partly to Milton's prose, and partly to\r\nCromwell's policy. The _Defensio_ was the last work that Milton saw.\r\nBlindness fell upon him ere it was finished, and from 1652 until his death\r\nhe labored in total darkness.\r\n\r\nThe last part of Milton's life is a picture of solitary grandeur unequaled\r\nin literary history. With the Restoration all his labors and sacrifices for\r\nhumanity were apparently wasted. From his retirement he could hear the\r\nbells and the shouts that welcomed back a vicious monarch, whose first act\r\nwas to set his foot upon his people's neck. Milton was immediately marked\r\nfor persecution; he remained for months in hiding; he was reduced to\r\npoverty, and his books were burned by the public hangman. His daughters,\r\nupon whom he depended in his blindness, rebelled at the task of reading to\r\nhim and recording his thoughts. In the midst of all these sorrows we\r\nunderstand, in _Samson_, the cry of the blind champion of Israel:\r\n\r\n    Now blind, disheartened, shamed, dishonored, quelled,\r\n    To what can I be useful? wherein serve\r\n    My nation, and the work from Heaven imposed?\r\n    But to sit idle on the household hearth,\r\n    A burdenous drone; to visitants a gaze,\r\n    Or pitied object.\r\n\r\nMilton's answer is worthy of his own great life. Without envy or bitterness\r\nhe goes back to the early dream of an immortal poem and begins with superb\r\nconsciousness of power to dictate his great epic.\r\n\r\n_Paradise Lost_ was finished in 1665, after seven years' labor in darkness.\r\nWith great difficulty he found a publisher, and for the great work, now the\r\nmost honored poem in our literature, he received less than certain verse\r\nmakers of our day receive for a little song in one of our popular\r\nmagazines. Its success was immediate, though, like all his work, it met\r\nwith venomous criticism. Dryden summed up the impression made on thoughtful\r\nminds of his time when he said, \"This man cuts us all out, and the ancients\r\ntoo.\" Thereafter a bit of sunshine came into his darkened home, for the\r\nwork stamped him as one of the world's great writers, and from England and\r\nthe Continent pilgrims came in increasing numbers to speak their gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe next year Milton began his _Paradise Regained_. In 1671 appeared his\r\nlast important work, _Samson Agonistes_, the most powerful dramatic poem on\r\nthe Greek model which our language possesses. The picture of Israel's\r\nmighty champion, blind, alone, afflicted by thoughtless enemies but\r\npreserving a noble ideal to the end, is a fitting close to the life work of\r\nthe poet himself. For years he was silent, dreaming who shall say what\r\ndreams in his darkness, and saying cheerfully to his friends, \"Still guides\r\nthe heavenly vision.\" He died peacefully in 1674, the most sublime and the\r\nmost lonely figure in our literature.\r\n\r\nMILTON'S EARLY POETRY.[166] In his early work Milton appears as the\r\ninheritor of all that was best in Elizabethan literature, and his first\r\nwork, the ode \"On the Morning of Christ's Nativity,\" approaches the\r\nhigh-water mark of lyric poetry in England. In the next six years, from\r\n1631 to 1637, he wrote but little, scarcely more than two thousand lines,\r\nbut these are among the most exquisite and the most perfectly finished in\r\nour language.\r\n\r\n\"L'Allegro\" and \"II Penseroso\" are twin poems, containing many lines and\r\nshort descriptive passages which linger in the mind like strains of music,\r\nand which are known and loved wherever English is spoken. \"L'Allegro\" (the\r\njoyous or happy man) is like an excursion into the English fields at\r\nsunrise. The air is sweet; birds are singing; a multitude of sights,\r\nsounds, fragrances, fill all the senses; and to this appeal of nature the\r\nsoul of man responds by being happy, seeing in every flower and hearing in\r\nevery harmony some exquisite symbol of human life. \"Il Penseroso\" takes us\r\nover the same ground at twilight and at moonrise. The air is still fresh\r\nand fragrant; the symbolism is, if possible, more tenderly beautiful than\r\nbefore; but the gay mood is gone, though its memory lingers in the\r\nafterglow of the sunset. A quiet thoughtfulness takes the place of the\r\npure, joyous sensation of the morning, a thoughtfulness which is not sad,\r\nthough like all quiet moods it is akin to sadness, and which sounds the\r\ndeeps of human emotion in the presence of nature. To quote scattered lines\r\nof either poem is to do injustice to both. They should be read in their\r\nentirety the same day, one at morning, the other at eventide, if one is to\r\nappreciate their beauty and suggestiveness.\r\n\r\nThe \"Masque of Comus\" is in many respects the most perfect of Milton's\r\npoems. It was written in 1634 to be performed at Ludlow Castle before the\r\nearl of Bridgewater and his friends. There is a tradition that the earl's\r\nthree children had been lost in the woods, and, whether true or not, Milton\r\ntakes the simple theme of a person lost, calls in an Attendant Spirit to\r\nprotect the wanderer, and out of this, with its natural action and\r\nmelodious songs, makes the most exquisite pastoral drama that we possess.\r\nIn form it is a masque, like those gorgeous products of the Elizabethan age\r\nof which Ben Jonson was the master. England had borrowed the idea of the\r\nmasque from Italy and had used it as the chief entertainment at all\r\nfestivals, until it had become to the nobles of England what the miracle\r\nplay had been to the common people of a previous generation. Milton, with\r\nhis strong Puritan spirit, could not be content with the mere entertainment\r\nof an idle hour. \"Comus\" has the gorgeous scenic effects, the music and\r\ndancing of other masques; but its moral purpose and its ideal teachings are\r\nunmistakable. \"The Triumph of Virtue\" would be a better name for this\r\nperfect little masque, for its theme is that virtue and innocence can walk\r\nthrough any peril of this world without permanent harm. This eternal\r\ntriumph of good over evil is proclaimed by the Attendant Spirit who has\r\nprotected the innocent in this life and who now disappears from mortal\r\nsight to resume its life of joy:\r\n\r\n    Mortals, that would follow me,\r\n    Love Virtue; she alone is free.\r\n    She can teach ye how to climb\r\n    Higher than the sphery chime;\r\n    Or if Virtue feeble were,\r\n    Heaven itself would stoop to her.\r\n\r\nWhile there are undoubted traces of Jonson and John Fletcher in Milton's\r\n\"Comus,\" the poem far surpasses its predecessors in the airy beauty and\r\nmelody of its verses.\r\n\r\nIn the next poem, \"Lycidas,\" a pastoral elegy written in 1637, and the last\r\nof his Horton poems, Milton is no longer the inheritor of the old age, but\r\nthe prophet of a new. A college friend, Edward King, had been drowned in\r\nthe Irish Sea, and Milton follows the poetic custom of his age by\r\nrepresenting both his friend and himself in the guise of shepherds leading\r\nthe pastoral life. Milton also uses all the symbolism of his predecessors,\r\nintroducing fauns, satyrs, and sea nymphs; but again the Puritan is not\r\ncontent with heathen symbolism, and so introduces a new symbol of the\r\nChristian shepherd responsible for the souls of men, whom he likens to\r\nhungry sheep that look up and are not fed. The Puritans and Royalists at\r\nthis time were drifting rapidly apart, and Milton uses his new symbolism to\r\ndenounce the abuses that had crept into the Church. In any other poet this\r\nmoral teaching would hinder the free use of the imagination; but Milton\r\nseems equal to the task of combining high moral purpose with the noblest\r\npoetry. In its exquisite finish and exhaustless imagery \"Lycidas\" surpasses\r\nmost of the poetry of what is often called the pagan Renaissance.\r\n\r\nBesides these well-known poems, Milton wrote in this early period a\r\nfragmentary masque called \"Arcades\"; several Latin poems which, like his\r\nEnglish, are exquisitely finished; and his famous \"Sonnets,\" which brought\r\nthis Italian form of verse nearly to the point of perfection. In them he\r\nseldom wrote of love, the usual subject with his predecessors, but of\r\npatriotism, duty, music, and subjects of political interest suggested by\r\nthe struggle into which England was drifting. Among these sonnets each\r\nreader must find his own favorites. Those best known and most frequently\r\nquoted are \"On His Deceased Wife,\" \"To the Nightingale,\" \"On Reaching the\r\nAge of Twenty-three,\" \"The Massacre in Piedmont,\" and the two \"On His\r\nBlindness.\"\r\n\r\nMILTON'S PROSE. Of Milton's prose works there are many divergent opinions,\r\nranging from Macaulay's unbounded praise to the condemnation of some of our\r\nmodern critics. From a literary view point Milton's prose would be stronger\r\nif less violent, and a modern writer would hardly be excused for using his\r\nlanguage or his methods; but we must remember the times and the methods of\r\nhis opponents. In his fiery zeal against injustice the poet is suddenly\r\ndominated by the soldier's spirit. He first musters his facts in\r\nbattalions, and charges upon the enemy to crush and overpower without\r\nmercy. For Milton hates injustice and, because it is an enemy of his\r\npeople, he cannot and will not spare it. When the victory is won, he exults\r\nin a paean of victory as soul-stirring as the Song of Deborah. He is the\r\npoet again, spite of himself, and his mind fills with magnificent images.\r\nEven with a subject so dull, so barren of the bare possibilities of poetry,\r\nas his \"Animadversions upon the Remonstrants' Defense,\" he breaks out into\r\nan invocation, \"Oh, Thou that sittest in light and glory unapproachable,\r\nparent of angels and men,\" which is like a chapter from the Apocalypse. In\r\nsuch passages Milton's prose is, as Taine suggests, \"an outpouring of\r\nsplendors,\" which suggests the noblest poetry.\r\n\r\nOn account of their controversial character these prose works are seldom\r\nread, and it is probable that Milton never thought of them as worthy of a\r\nplace in literature. Of them all _Areopagitica_ has perhaps the most\r\npermanent interest and is best worth reading. In Milton's time there was a\r\nlaw forbidding the publication of books until they were indorsed by the\r\nofficial censor. Needless to say, the censor, holding his office and salary\r\nby favor, was naturally more concerned with the divine right of kings and\r\nbishops than with the delights of literature, and many books were\r\nsuppressed for no better reason than that they were displeasing to the\r\nauthorities. Milton protested against this, as against every other form of\r\ntyranny, and his _Areopagitica_--so called from the Areopagus or Forum of\r\nAthens, the place of public appeal, and the Mars Hill of St. Paul's\r\naddress--is the most famous plea in English for the freedom of the press.\r\n\r\nMILTON'S LATER POETRY. Undoubtedly the noblest of Milton's works, written\r\nwhen he was blind and suffering, are _Paradise Lost, Paradise Regained_,\r\nand _Samson Agonistes_. The first is the greatest, indeed the only\r\ngenerally acknowledged epic in our literature since _Beowulf;_ the last is\r\nthe most perfect specimen of a drama after the Greek method in our\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nOf the history of the great epic we have some interesting glimpses. In\r\nCambridge there is preserved a notebook of Milton's containing a list of\r\nnearly one hundred subjects[167] for a great poem, selected while he was a\r\nboy at the university. King Arthur attracted him at first; but his choice\r\nfinally settled upon the Fall of Man, and we have four separate outlines\r\nshowing Milton's proposed treatment of the subject. These outlines indicate\r\nthat he contemplated a mighty drama or miracle play; but whether because of\r\nPuritan antipathy to plays and players, or because of the wretched dramatic\r\ntreatment of religious subjects which Milton had witnessed in Italy, he\r\nabandoned the idea of a play and settled on the form of an epic poem; most\r\nfortunately, it must be conceded, for Milton had not the knowledge of men\r\nnecessary for a drama. As a study of character _Paradise Lost_ would be a\r\ngrievous failure. Adam, the central character, is something of a prig;\r\nwhile Satan looms up a magnificent figure, entirely different from the\r\ndevil of the miracle plays and completely overshadowing the hero both in\r\ninterest and in manliness. The other characters, the Almighty, the Son,\r\nRaphael, Michael, the angels and fallen spirits, are merely mouthpieces for\r\nMilton's declamations, without any personal or human interest. Regarded as\r\na drama, therefore, _Paradise Lost_ could never have been a success; but as\r\npoetry, with its sublime imagery, its harmonious verse, its titanic\r\nbackground of heaven, hell, and the illimitable void that lies between, it\r\nis unsurpassed in any literature.\r\n\r\nIn 1658 Milton in his darkness sat down to dictate the work which he had\r\nplanned thirty years before. In order to understand the mighty sweep of the\r\npoem it is necessary to sum up the argument of the twelve books, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nBook I opens with a statement of the subject, the Fall of Man, and a noble\r\ninvocation for light and divine guidance. Then begins the account of Satan\r\nand the rebel angels, their banishment from heaven, and their plot to\r\noppose the design of the Almighty by dragging down his children, our first\r\nparents, from their state of innocence. The book closes with a description\r\nof the land of fire and endless pain where the fallen spirits abide, and\r\nthe erection of Pandemonium, the palace of Satan. Book II is a description\r\nof the council of evil spirits, of Satan's consent to undertake the\r\ntemptation of Adam and Eve, and his journey to the gates of hell, which are\r\nguarded by Sin and Death. Book III transports us to heaven again. God,\r\nforeseeing the fall, sends Raphael to warn Adam and Eve, so that their\r\ndisobedience shall be upon their own heads. Then the Son offers himself a\r\nsacrifice, to take away the sin of the coming disobedience of man. At the\r\nend of this book Satan appears in a different scene, meets Uriel, the Angel\r\nof the Sun, inquires from him the way to earth, and takes his journey\r\nthither disguised as an angel of light. Book IV shows us Paradise and the\r\ninnocent state of man. An angel guard is set over Eden, and Satan is\r\narrested while tempting Eve in a dream, but is curiously allowed to go free\r\nagain. Book V shows us Eve relating her dream to Adam, and then the morning\r\nprayer and the daily employment of our first parents. Raphael visits them,\r\nis entertained by a banquet (which Eve proposes in order to show him that\r\nall God's gifts are not kept in heaven), and tells them of the revolt of\r\nthe fallen spirits. His story is continued in Book VI. In Book VII we read\r\nthe story of the creation of the world as Raphael tells it to Adam and Eve.\r\nIn Book VIII Adam tells Raphael the story of his own life and of his\r\nmeeting with Eve. Book IX is the story of the temptation by Satan,\r\nfollowing the account in Genesis. Book X records the divine judgment upon\r\nAdam and Eve; shows the construction by Sin and Death of a highway through\r\nchaos to the earth, and Satan's return to Pandemonium. Adam and Eve repent\r\nof their disobedience and Satan and his angels are turned into serpents. In\r\nBook XI the Almighty accepts Adam's repentance, but condemns him to be\r\nbanished from Paradise, and the archangel Michael is sent to execute the\r\nsentence. At the end of the book, after Eve's feminine grief at the loss of\r\nParadise, Michael begins a prophetic vision of the destiny of man. Book XII\r\ncontinues Michael's vision. Adam and Eve are comforted by hearing of the\r\nfuture redemption of their race. The poem ends as they wander forth out of\r\nParadise and the door closes behind them.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this is a colossal epic, not of a man or a hero, but\r\nof the whole race of men; and that Milton's characters are such as no human\r\nhand could adequately portray. But the scenes, the splendors of heaven, the\r\nhorrors of hell, the serene beauty of Paradise, the sun and planets\r\nsuspended between celestial light and gross darkness, are pictured with an\r\nimagination that is almost superhuman. The abiding interest of the poem is\r\nin these colossal pictures, and in the lofty thought and the marvelous\r\nmelody with which they are impressed on our minds. The poem is in blank\r\nverse, and not until Milton used it did we learn the infinite variety and\r\nharmony of which it is capable. He played with it, changing its melody and\r\nmovement on every page, \"as an organist out of a single theme develops an\r\nunending variety of harmony.\"\r\n\r\nLamartine has described _Paradise Lost_ as the dream of a Puritan fallen\r\nasleep over his Bible, and this suggestive description leads us to the\r\ncurious fact that it is the dream, not the theology or the descriptions of\r\nBible scenes, that chiefly interests us. Thus Milton describes the\r\nseparation of earth and water, and there is little or nothing added to the\r\nsimplicity and strength of _Genesis_; but the sunset which follows is\r\nMilton's own dream, and instantly we are transported to a land of beauty\r\nand poetry:\r\n\r\n    Now came still Evening on, and Twilight gray\r\n    Had in her sober livery all things clad;\r\n    Silence accompanied; for beast and bird,\r\n    They to their grassy couch, these to their nests\r\n    Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale.\r\n    She all night long her amorous descant sung:\r\n    Silence was pleased. Now glowed the firmament\r\n    With living sapphires; Hesperus, that led\r\n    The starry host, rode brightest, till the Moon,\r\n    Rising in clouded majesty, at length\r\n    Apparent queen, unveiled her peerless light,\r\n    And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw.\r\n\r\nSo also Milton's Almighty, considered purely as a literary character, is\r\nunfortunately tinged with the narrow and literal theology of the time. He\r\nis a being enormously egotistic, the despot rather than the servant of the\r\nuniverse, seated upon a throne with a chorus of angels about him eternally\r\nsinging his praises and ministering to a kind of divine vanity. It is not\r\nnecessary to search heaven for such a character; the type is too common\r\nupon earth. But in Satan Milton breaks away from crude mediæval\r\nconceptions; he follows the dream again, and gives us a character to admire\r\nand understand:\r\n\r\n    \"Is this the region, this the soil, the clime,\"\r\n    Said then the lost Archangel, \"this the seat\r\n    That we must change for Heaven?--this mournful gloom\r\n    For that celestial light? Be it so, since He\r\n    Who now is sovran can dispose and bid\r\n    What shall be right: farthest from Him is best,\r\n    Whom reason hath equalled, force hath made supreme\r\n    Above his equals. Farewell, happy fields,\r\n    Where joy forever dwells! Hail, horrors! hail,\r\n    Infernal World! and thou, profoundest Hell,\r\n    Receive thy new possessor--one who brings\r\n    A mind not to be changed by place or time.\r\n    The mind is its own place, and in itself\r\n    Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.\r\n    What matter where, if I be still the same,\r\n    And what I should be, all but less than he\r\n    Whom thunder hath made greater? Here at least\r\n    We shall be free; the Almighty hath not built\r\n    Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:\r\n    Here we may reign secure; and, in my choice,\r\n    To reign is worth ambition, though in Hell:\r\n    Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.\"\r\n\r\nIn this magnificent heroism Milton has unconsciously immortalized the\r\nPuritan spirit, the same unconquerable spirit that set men to writing poems\r\nand allegories when in prison for the faith, and that sent them over the\r\nstormy sea in a cockleshell to found a free commonwealth in the wilds of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nFor a modern reader the understanding of _Paradise Lost_ presupposes two\r\nthings,--a knowledge of the first chapters of the Scriptures, and of the\r\ngeneral principles of Calvinistic theology; but it is a pity to use the\r\npoem, as has so often been done, to teach a literal acceptance of one or\r\nthe other. Of the theology of _Paradise Lost_ the least said the better;\r\nbut to the splendor of the Puritan dream and the glorious melody of its\r\nexpression no words can do justice. Even a slight acquaintance will make\r\nthe reader understand why it ranks with the _Divina Commedia_ of Dante, and\r\nwhy it is generally accepted by critics as the greatest single poem in our\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nSoon after the completion of _Paradise Lost_, Thomas Ellwood, a friend of\r\nMilton, asked one day after reading the Paradise manuscript, \"But what hast\r\nthou to say of Paradise Found?\" It was in response to this suggestion that\r\nMilton wrote the second part of the great epic, known to us as _Paradise\r\nRegained_. The first tells how mankind, in the person of Adam, fell at the\r\nfirst temptation by Satan and became an outcast from Paradise and from\r\ndivine grace; the second shows how mankind, in the person of Christ,\r\nwithstands the tempter and is established once more in the divine favor.\r\nChrist's temptation in the wilderness is the theme, and Milton follows the\r\naccount in the fourth chapter of Matthew's gospel. Though _Paradise\r\nRegained_ was Milton's favorite, and though it has many passages of noble\r\nthought and splendid imagery equal to the best of _Paradise Lost_, the poem\r\nas a whole falls below the level of the first, and is less interesting to\r\nread.\r\n\r\nIn _Samson Agonistes_ Milton turns to a more vital and personal theme, and\r\nhis genius transfigures the story of Samson, the mighty champion of Israel,\r\nnow blind and scorned, working as a slave among the Philistines. The poet's\r\naim was to present in English a pure tragedy, with all the passion and\r\nrestraint which marked the old Greek dramas. That he succeeded where others\r\nfailed is due to two causes: first, Milton himself suggests the hero of one\r\nof the Greek tragedies,--his sorrow and affliction give to his noble nature\r\nthat touch of melancholy and calm dignity which is in perfect keeping with\r\nhis subject. Second, Milton is telling his own story. Like Samson he had\r\nstruggled mightily against the enemies of his race; he had taken a wife\r\nfrom the Philistines and had paid the penalty; he was blind, alone, scorned\r\nby his vain and thoughtless masters. To the essential action of the tragedy\r\nMilton could add, therefore, that touch of intense yet restrained personal\r\nfeeling which carries more conviction than any argument. _Samson_ is in\r\nmany respects the most convincing of his works. Entirely apart from the\r\ninterest of its subject and treatment, one may obtain from it a better idea\r\nof what great tragedy was among the Greeks than from any other work in our\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n    Nothing is here for tears, nothing to wail\r\n    Or knock the breast, no weakness, no contempt,\r\n    Dispraise or blame,--nothing but well and fair,\r\n    And what may quiet us in a death so noble.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. PROSE WRITERS OF THE PURITAN PERIOD\r\n\r\nJOHN BUNYAN (1628-1688)\r\n\r\nAs there is but one poet great enough to express the Puritan spirit, so\r\nthere is but one commanding prose writer, John Bunyan. Milton was the child\r\nof the Renaissance, inheritor of all its culture, and the most profoundly\r\neducated man of his age. Bunyan was a poor, uneducated tinker. From the\r\nRenaissance he inherited nothing; but from the Reformation he received an\r\nexcess of that spiritual independence which had caused the Puritan struggle\r\nfor liberty. These two men, representing the extremes of English life in\r\nthe seventeenth century, wrote the two works that stand to-day for the\r\nmighty Puritan spirit. One gave us the only epic since _Beowulf_; the other\r\ngave us our only great allegory, which has been read more than any other\r\nbook in our language save the Bible.\r\n\r\nLIFE OF BUNYAN. Bunyan is an extraordinary figure; we must study him, as\r\nwell as his books. Fortunately we have his life story in his own words,\r\nwritten with the same lovable modesty and sincerity that marked all his\r\nwork. Reading that story now, in _Grace Abounding_, we see two great\r\ninfluences at work in his life. One, from within, was his own vivid\r\nimagination, which saw visions, allegories, parables, revelations, in every\r\ncommon event. The other, from without, was the spiritual ferment of the\r\nage, the multiplication of strange sects,--Quakers, Free-Willers, Ranters,\r\nAnabaptists, Millenarians,--and the untempered zeal of all classes, like an\r\nengine without a balance wheel, when men were breaking away from authority\r\nand setting up their own religious standards. Bunyan's life is an epitome\r\nof that astonishing religious individualism which marked the close of the\r\nEnglish Reformation.\r\n\r\nHe was born in the little village of Elstow, near Bedford, in 1628, the son\r\nof a poor tinker. For a little while the boy was sent to school, where he\r\nlearned to read and write after a fashion; but he was soon busy in his\r\nfather's shop, where, amid the glowing pots and the fire and smoke of his\r\nlittle forge, he saw vivid pictures of hell and the devils which haunted\r\nhim all his life. When he was sixteen years old his father married the\r\nsecond time, whereupon Bunyan ran away and became a soldier in the\r\nParliamentary army.\r\n\r\nThe religious ferment of the age made a tremendous impression on Bunyan's\r\nsensitive imagination. He went to church occasionally, only to find himself\r\nwrapped in terrors and torments by some fiery itinerant preacher; and he\r\nwould rush violently away from church to forget his fears by joining in\r\nSunday sports on the village green. As night came on the sports were\r\nforgotten, but the terrors returned, multiplied like the evil spirits of\r\nthe parable. Visions of hell and the demons swarmed in his brain. He would\r\ngroan aloud in his remorse, and even years afterwards he bemoans the sins\r\nof his early life. When we look for them fearfully, expecting some shocking\r\ncrimes and misdemeanors, we find that they consisted of playing ball on\r\nSunday and swearing. The latter sin, sad to say, was begun by listening to\r\nhis father cursing some obstinate kettle which refused to be tinkered, and\r\nit was perfected in the Parliamentary army. One day his terrible swearing\r\nscared a woman, \"a very loose and ungodly wretch,\" as he tells us, who\r\nreprimanded him for his profanity. The reproach of the poor woman went\r\nstraight home, like the voice of a prophet. All his profanity left him; he\r\nhung down his head with shame. \"I wished with all my heart,\" he says, \"that\r\nI might be a little child again, that my father might learn me to speak\r\nwithout this wicked way of swearing.\" With characteristic vehemence Bunyan\r\nhurls himself upon a promise of Scripture, and instantly the reformation\r\nbegins to work in his soul. He casts out the habit, root and branch, and\r\nfinds to his astonishment that he can speak more freely and vigorously than\r\nbefore. Nothing is more characteristic of the man than this sudden seizing\r\nupon a text, which he had doubtless heard many times before, and being\r\nsuddenly raised up or cast down by its influence.\r\n\r\nWith Bunyan's marriage to a good woman the real reformation in his life\r\nbegan. While still in his teens he married a girl as poor as himself. \"We\r\ncame together,\" he says, \"as poor as might be, having not so much household\r\nstuff as a dish or spoon between us both.\" The only dowry which the girl\r\nbrought to her new home was two old, threadbare books, _The Plain Man's\r\nPathway to Heaven_, and _The Practice of Piety_[168] Bunyan read these\r\nbooks, which instantly gave fire to his imagination. He saw new visions and\r\ndreamed terrible new dreams of lost souls; his attendance at church grew\r\nexemplary; he began slowly and painfully to read the Bible for himself, but\r\nbecause of his own ignorance and the contradictory interpretations of\r\nScripture which he heard on every side, he was tossed about like a feather\r\nby all the winds of doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe record of the next few years is like a nightmare, so terrible is\r\nBunyan's spiritual struggle. One day he feels himself an outcast; the next\r\nthe companion of angels; the third he tries experiments with the Almighty\r\nin order to put his salvation to the proof. As he goes along the road to\r\nBedford he thinks he will work a miracle, like Gideon with his fleece. He\r\nwill say to the little puddles of water in the horses' tracks, \"Be ye dry\";\r\nand to all the dry tracks he will say, \"Be ye puddles.\" As he is about to\r\nperform the miracle a thought occurs to him: \"But go first under yonder\r\nhedge and pray that the Lord will make you able to perform a miracle.\" He\r\ngoes promptly and prays. Then he is afraid of the test, and goes on his way\r\nmore troubled than before.\r\n\r\nAfter years of such struggle, chased about between heaven and hell, Bunyan\r\nat last emerges into a saner atmosphere, even as Pilgrim came out of the\r\nhorrible Valley of the Shadow. Soon, led by his intense feelings, he\r\nbecomes an open-air preacher, and crowds of laborers gather about him on\r\nthe village green. They listen in silence to his words; they end in groans\r\nand tears; scores of them amend their sinful lives. For the Anglo-Saxon\r\npeople are remarkable for this, that however deeply they are engaged in\r\nbusiness or pleasure, they are still sensitive as barometers to any true\r\nspiritual influence, whether of priest or peasant; they recognize what\r\nEmerson calls the \"accent of the Holy Ghost,\" and in this recognition of\r\nspiritual leadership lies the secret of their democracy. So this village\r\ntinker, with his strength and sincerity, is presently the acknowledged\r\nleader of an immense congregation, and his influence is felt throughout\r\nEngland. It is a tribute to his power that, after the return of Charles II,\r\nBunyan was the first to be prohibited from holding public meetings.\r\n\r\nConcerning Bunyan's imprisonment in Bedford jail, which followed his\r\nrefusal to obey the law prohibiting religious meetings without the\r\nauthority of the Established Church, there is a difference of opinion. That\r\nthe law was unjust goes without saying; but there was no religious\r\npersecution, as we understand the term. Bunyan was allowed to worship when\r\nand how he pleased; he was simply forbidden to hold public meetings, which\r\nfrequently became fierce denunciations of the Established Church and\r\ngovernment. His judges pleaded with Bunyan to conform with the law. He\r\nrefused, saying that when the Spirit was upon him he must go up and down\r\nthe land, calling on men everywhere to repent. In his refusal we see much\r\nheroism, a little obstinacy, and perhaps something of that desire for\r\nmartyrdom which tempts every spiritual leader. That his final sentence to\r\nindefinite imprisonment was a hard blow to Bunyan is beyond question. He\r\ngroaned aloud at the thought of his poor family, and especially at the\r\nthought of leaving his little blind daughter:\r\n\r\nI found myself a man encompassed with infirmities; the parting was like\r\npulling the flesh from my bones.... Oh, the thoughts of the hardship I\r\nthought my poor blind one might go under would break my heart to pieces.\r\nPoor child, thought I, what sorrow thou art like to have for thy portion in\r\nthis world; thou must be beaten, must beg, suffer hunger, cold, nakedness,\r\nand a thousand calamities, though I cannot now endure that the wind should\r\nblow upon thee.[169]\r\n\r\nAnd then, because he thinks always in parables and seeks out most curious\r\ntexts of Scripture, he speaks of \"the two milch kine that were to carry the\r\nark of God into another country and leave their calves behind them.\" Poor\r\ncows, poor Bunyan! Such is the mind of this extraordinary man.\r\n\r\nWith characteristic diligence Bunyan set to work in prison making shoe\r\nlaces, and so earned a living for his family. His imprisonment lasted for\r\nnearly twelve years; but he saw his family frequently, and was for some\r\ntime a regular preacher in the Baptist church in Bedford. Occasionally he\r\neven went about late at night, holding the proscribed meetings and\r\nincreasing his hold upon the common people. The best result of this\r\nimprisonment was that it gave Bunyan long hours for the working of his\r\npeculiar mind and for study of his two only books, the King James Bible and\r\nFoxe's _Book of Martyrs_. The result of his study and meditation was _The\r\nPilgrim's Progress_, which was probably written in prison, but which for\r\nsome reason he did not publish till long after his release.\r\n\r\nThe years which followed are the most interesting part of Bunyan's strange\r\ncareer. The publication of _Pilgrim's Progress_ in 1678 made him the most\r\npopular writer, as he was already the most popular preacher, in England.\r\nBooks, tracts, sermons, nearly sixty works in all, came from his pen; and\r\nwhen one remembers his ignorance, his painfully slow writing, and his\r\nactivity as an itinerant preacher, one can only marvel. His evangelistic\r\njourneys carried him often as far as London, and wherever he went crowds\r\nthronged to hear him. Scholars, bishops, statesmen went in secret to listen\r\namong the laborers, and came away wondering and silent. At Southwark the\r\nlargest building could not contain the multitude of his hearers; and when\r\nhe preached in London, thousands would gather in the cold dusk of the\r\nwinter morning, before work began, and listen until he had made an end of\r\nspeaking. \"Bishop Bunyan\" he was soon called on account of his missionary\r\njourneys and his enormous influence.\r\n\r\nWhat we most admire in the midst of all this activity is his perfect mental\r\nbalance, his charity and humor in the strife of many sects. He was badgered\r\nfor years by petty enemies, and he arouses our enthusiasm by his tolerance,\r\nhis self-control, and especially by his sincerity. To the very end he\r\nretained that simple modesty which no success could spoil. Once when he had\r\npreached with unusual power some of his friends waited after the service to\r\ncongratulate him, telling him what a \"sweet sermon\" he had delivered.\r\n\"Aye,\" said Bunyan, \"you need not remind me; the devil told me that before\r\nI was out of the pulpit.\"\r\n\r\nFor sixteen years this wonderful activity continued without interruption.\r\nThen, one day when riding through a cold storm on a labor of love, to\r\nreconcile a stubborn man with his own stubborn son, he caught a severe cold\r\nand appeared, ill and suffering but rejoicing in his success, at the house\r\nof a friend in Reading. He died there a few days later, and was laid away\r\nin Bunhill Fields burial ground, London, which has been ever since a _campo\r\nsanto_ to the faithful.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF BUNYAN. The world's literature has three great\r\nallegories,--Spenser's _Faery Queen_, Dante's _Divina Commedia_, and\r\nBunyan's _Pilgrim's Progress_. The first appeals to poets, the second to\r\nscholars, the third to people of every age and condition. Here is a brief\r\noutline of the famous work:\r\n\r\n\"As I walked through the wilderness of this world I lighted on a certain\r\nplace where was a den [Bedford jail] and laid me down in that place to\r\nsleep; and, as I slept, I dreamed a dream.\" So the story begins. He sees a\r\nman called Christian setting out with a book in his hand and a great load\r\non his back from the city of Destruction. Christian has two objects,--to\r\nget rid of his burden, which holds the sins and fears of his life, and to\r\nmake his way to the Holy City. At the outset Evangelist finds him weeping\r\nbecause he knows not where to go, and points him to a wicket gate on a hill\r\nfar away. As Christian goes forward his neighbors, friends, wife and\r\nchildren call to him to come back; but he puts his fingers in his ears,\r\ncrying out, \"Life, life, eternal life,\" and so rushes across the plain.\r\n\r\nThen begins a journey in ten stages, which is a vivid picture of the\r\ndifficulties and triumphs of the Christian life. Every trial, every\r\ndifficulty, every experience of joy or sorrow, of peace or temptation, is\r\nput into the form and discourse of a living character. Other allegorists\r\nwrite in poetry and their characters are shadowy and unreal; but Bunyan\r\nspeaks in terse, idiomatic prose, and his characters are living men and\r\nwomen. There are Mr. Worldly Wiseman, a self-satisfied and dogmatic kind of\r\nman, youthful Ignorance, sweet Piety, courteous Demas, garrulous Talkative,\r\nhonest Faithful, and a score of others, who are not at all the bloodless\r\ncreatures of the _Romance of the Rose_, but men real enough to stop you on\r\nthe road and to hold your attention. Scene after scene follows, in which\r\nare pictured many of our own spiritual experiences. There is the Slough of\r\nDespond, into which we all have fallen, out of which Pliable scrambles on\r\nthe hither side and goes back grumbling, but through which Christian\r\nstruggles mightily till Helpful stretches him a hand and drags him out on\r\nsolid ground and bids him go on his way. Then come Interpreter's house, the\r\nPalace Beautiful, the Lions in the way, the Valley of Humiliation, the hard\r\nfight with the demon Apollyon, the more terrible Valley of the Shadow,\r\nVanity Fair, and the trial of Faithful. The latter is condemned to death by\r\na jury made up of Mr. Blindman, Mr. Nogood, Mr. Heady, Mr. Liveloose, Mr.\r\nHatelight, and others of their kind to whom questions of justice are\r\ncommitted by the jury system. Most famous is Doubting Castle, where\r\nChristian and Hopeful are thrown into a dungeon by Giant Despair. And then\r\nat last the Delectable Mountains of Youth, the deep river that Christian\r\nmust cross, and the city of All Delight and the glorious company of angels\r\nthat come singing down the streets. At the very end, when in sight of the\r\ncity and while he can hear the welcome with which Christian is greeted,\r\nIgnorance is snatched away to go to his own place; and Bunyan quaintly\r\nobserves, \"Then I saw that there was a way to hell even from the gates of\r\nheaven as well as from the city of Destruction. So I awoke, and behold it\r\nwas a dream!\"\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief, is the story, the great epic of a Puritan's individual\r\nexperience in a rough world, just as _Paradise Lost_ was the epic of\r\nmankind as dreamed by the great Puritan who had \"fallen asleep over his\r\nBible.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief fact which confronts the student of literature as he pauses\r\nbefore this great allegory is that it has been translated into seventy-five\r\nlanguages and dialects, and has been read more than any other book save one\r\nin the English language.\r\n\r\nAs for the secret of its popularity, Taine says, \"Next to the Bible, the\r\nbook most widely read in England is the _Pilgrim's Progress_....\r\nProtestantism is the doctrine of salvation by grace, and no writer has\r\nequaled Bunyan in making this doctrine understood.\" And this opinion is\r\nechoed by the majority of our literary historians. It is perhaps sufficient\r\nanswer to quote the simple fact that _Pilgrim's Progress_ is not\r\nexclusively a Protestant study; it appeals to Christians of every name, and\r\nto Mohammedans and Buddhists in precisely the same way that it appeals to\r\nChristians. When it was translated into the languages of Catholic\r\ncountries, like France and Portugal, only one or two incidents were\r\nomitted, and the story was almost as popular there as with English readers.\r\nThe secret of its success is probably simple. It is, first of all, not a\r\nprocession of shadows repeating the author's declamations, but a real\r\nstory, the first extended story in our language. Our Puritan fathers may\r\nhave read the story for religious instruction; but all classes of men have\r\nread it because they found in it a true personal experience told with\r\nstrength, interest, humor,--in a word, with all the qualities that such a\r\nstory should possess. Young people have read it, first, for its intrinsic\r\nworth, because the dramatic interest of the story lured them on to the very\r\nend; and second, because it was their introduction to true allegory. The\r\nchild with his imaginative mind--the man also, who has preserved his\r\nsimplicity--naturally personifies objects, and takes pleasure in giving\r\nthem powers of thinking and speaking like himself. Bunyan was the first\r\nwriter to appeal to this pleasant and natural inclination in a way that all\r\ncould understand. Add to this the fact that _Pilgrim's Progress_ was the\r\nonly book having any story interest in the great majority of English and\r\nAmerican homes for a full century, and we have found the real reason for\r\nits wide reading.\r\n\r\n_The Holy War_, published in 1665, is the first important work of Bunyan.\r\nIt is a prose _Paradise Lost_, and would undoubtedly be known as a\r\nremarkable allegory were it not overshadowed by its great rival. _Grace\r\nAbounding to the Chief of Sinners_, published in 1666, twelve years before\r\n_Pilgrim's Progress_, is the work from which we obtain the clearest insight\r\ninto Bunyan's remarkable life, and to a man with historical or antiquarian\r\ntastes it is still excellent reading. In 1682 appeared _The Life and Death\r\nof Mr. Badman_, a realistic character study which is a precursor of the\r\nmodern novel; and in 1684 the second part of _Pilgrim's Progress_, showing\r\nthe journey of Christiana and her children to the city of All Delight.\r\nBesides these Bunyan published a multitude of treatises and sermons, all in\r\nthe same style,--direct, simple, convincing, expressing every thought and\r\nemotion perfectly in words that even a child can understand. Many of these\r\nare masterpieces, admired by workingmen and scholars alike for their\r\nthought and expression. Take, for instance, \"The Heavenly Footman,\" put it\r\nside by side with the best work of Latimer, and the resemblance in style is\r\nstartling. It is difficult to realize that one work came from an ignorant\r\ntinker and the other from a great scholar, both engaged in the same general\r\nwork. As Bunyan's one book was the Bible, we have here a suggestion of its\r\ninfluence in all our prose literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR PROSE WRITERS\r\n\r\nThe Puritan Period is generally regarded as one destitute of literary\r\ninterest; but that was certainly not the result of any lack of books or\r\nwriters. Says Burton in his _Anatomy of Melancholy:_\r\n\r\nI have ... new books every day, pamphlets, currantoes, stories, whole\r\ncatalogues of volumes of all sorts, new paradoxes, opinions, schisms,\r\nheresies, controversies in philosophy and religion. Now come tidings of\r\nweddings, maskings, entertainments, jubilees, embassies, sports, plays;\r\nthen again, as in a new-shipped scene, treasons, cheatings, tricks,\r\nrobberies, enormous villainies in all kinds, funerals, deaths, new\r\ndiscoveries, expeditions; now comical, then tragical matters.....\r\n\r\nSo the record continues, till one rubs his eyes and thinks he must have\r\npicked up by mistake the last literary magazine. And for all these\r\nkaleidoscopic events there were waiting a multitude of writers, ready to\r\nseize the abundant material and turn it to literary account for a tract, an\r\narticle, a volume, or an encyclopedia.\r\n\r\nIf one were to recommend certain of these books as expressive of this age\r\nof outward storm and inward calm, there are three that deserve more than a\r\npassing notice, namely, the _Religio Medici_, _Holy Living_, and _The\r\nCompleat Angler_. The first was written by a busy physician, a supposedly\r\nscientific man at that time; the second by the most learned of English\r\nchurchmen; and the third by a simple merchant and fisherman. Strangely\r\nenough, these three great books--the reflections of nature, science, and\r\nrevelation--all interpret human life alike and tell the same story of\r\ngentleness, charity, and noble living. If the age had produced only these\r\nthree books, we could still be profoundly grateful to it for its inspiring\r\nmessage.\r\n\r\nROBERT BURTON (1577-1640). Burton is famous chiefly as the author of the\r\n_Anatomy of Melancholy_, one of the most astonishing books in all\r\nliterature, which appeared in 1621. Burton was a clergyman of the\r\nEstablished Church, an incomprehensible genius, given to broodings and\r\nmelancholy and to reading of every conceivable kind of literature. Thanks\r\nto his wonderful memory, everything he read was stored up for use or\r\nornament, till his mind resembled a huge curiosity shop. All his life he\r\nsuffered from hypochondria, but curiously traced his malady to the stars\r\nrather than to his own liver. It is related of him that he used to suffer\r\nso from despondency that no help was to be found in medicine or theology;\r\nhis only relief was to go down to the river and hear the bargemen swear at\r\none another.\r\n\r\nBurton's _Anatomy_ was begun as a medical treatise on morbidness, arranged\r\nand divided with all the exactness of the schoolmen's demonstration of\r\ndoctrines; but it turned out to be an enormous hodgepodge of quotations and\r\nreferences to authors, known and unknown, living and dead, which seemed to\r\nprove chiefly that \"much study is a weariness to the flesh.\" By some freak\r\nof taste it became instantly popular, and was proclaimed one of the\r\ngreatest books in literature. A few scholars still explore it with delight,\r\nas a mine of classic wealth; but the style is hopelessly involved, and to\r\nthe ordinary reader most of his numerous references are now as unmeaning as\r\na hyper-jacobian surface.\r\n\r\nSIR THOMAS BROWNE (1605-1682). Browne was a physician who, after much study\r\nand travel, settled down to his profession in Norwich; but even then he\r\ngave far more time to the investigation of natural phenomena than to the\r\nbarbarous practices which largely constituted the \"art\" of medicine in his\r\nday. He was known far and wide as a learned doctor and an honest man, whose\r\nscientific studies had placed him in advance of his age, and whose\r\nreligious views were liberal to the point of heresy. With this in mind, it\r\nis interesting to note, as a sign of the times, that this most scientific\r\ndoctor was once called to give \"expert\" testimony in the case of two old\r\nwomen who were being tried for the capital crime of witchcraft. He\r\ntestified under oath that \"the fits were natural, but heightened by the\r\ndevil's coöperating with the witches, at whose instance he [the alleged\r\ndevil] did the villainies.\"\r\n\r\nBrowne's great work is the _Religio Medici_, i.e. The Religion of a\r\nPhysician (1642), which met with most unusual success. \"Hardly ever was a\r\nbook published in Britain,\" says Oldys, a chronicler who wrote nearly a\r\ncentury later, \"that made more noise than the _Religio Medici_.\" Its\r\nsuccess may be due largely to the fact that, among thousands of religious\r\nworks, it was one of the few which saw in nature a profound revelation, and\r\nwhich treated purely religious subjects in a reverent, kindly, tolerant\r\nway, without ecclesiastical bias. It is still, therefore, excellent\r\nreading; but it is not so much the matter as the manner--the charm, the\r\ngentleness, the remarkable prose style--which has established the book as\r\none of the classics of our literature.\r\n\r\nTwo other works of Browne are _Vulgar Errors_ (1646), a curious combination\r\nof scientific and credulous research in the matter of popular superstition,\r\nand _Urn Burial_, a treatise suggested by the discovery of Roman burial\r\nurns at Walsingham. It began as an inquiry into the various methods of\r\nburial, but ended in a dissertation on the vanity of earthly hope and\r\nambitions. From a literary point of view it is Browne's best work, but is\r\nless read than the _Religio Medici_.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS FULLER (1608-1661). Fuller was a clergyman and royalist whose lively\r\nstyle and witty observations would naturally place him with the gay\r\nCaroline poets. His best known works are _The Holy War, The Holy State and\r\nthe Profane State, Church History of Britain_, and the _History of the\r\nWorthies of England. The Holy and Profane State_ is chiefly a biographical\r\nrecord, the first part consisting of numerous historical examples to be\r\nimitated, the second of examples to be avoided. The _Church History_ is not\r\na scholarly work, notwithstanding its author's undoubted learning, but is a\r\nlively and gossipy account which has at least one virtue, that it\r\nentertains the reader. The _Worthies_, the most widely read of his works,\r\nis a racy account of the important men of England. Fuller traveled\r\nconstantly for years, collecting information from out-of-the-way sources\r\nand gaining a minute knowledge of his own country. This, with his\r\noverflowing humor and numerous anecdotes and illustrations, makes lively\r\nand interesting reading. Indeed, we hardly find a dull page in any of his\r\nnumerous books.\r\n\r\nJEREMY TAYLOR (1613-1667). Taylor was the greatest of the clergymen who\r\nmade this period famous, a man who, like Milton, upheld a noble ideal in\r\nstorm and calm, and himself lived it nobly. He has been called \"the\r\nShakespeare of divines,\" and \"a kind of Spenser in a cassock,\" and both\r\ndescriptions apply to him very well. His writings, with their exuberant\r\nfancy and their noble diction, belong rather to the Elizabethan than to the\r\nPuritan age.\r\n\r\nFrom the large number of his works two stand out as representative of the\r\nman himself: _The Liberty of Prophesying_ (1646), which Hallam calls the\r\nfirst plea for tolerance in religion, on a comprehensive basis and on\r\ndeep-seated foundations; and _The Rules and Exercises of Holy Living_\r\n(1650). To the latter might be added its companion volume, _Holy Dying_,\r\npublished in the following year. _The Holy Living and Dying_, as a single\r\nvolume, was for many years read in almost every English cottage. With\r\nBaxter's _Saints' Rest, Pilgrim's Progress_, and the _King James Bible_, it\r\noften constituted the entire library of multitudes of Puritan homes; and as\r\nwe read its noble words and breathe its gentle spirit, we cannot help\r\nwishing that our modern libraries were gathered together on the same\r\nthoughtful foundations.\r\n\r\nRICHARD BAXTER (1615-1691). This \"busiest man of his age\" strongly suggests\r\nBunyan in his life and writings. Like Bunyan, he was poor and uneducated, a\r\nnonconformist minister, exposed continually to insult and persecution; and,\r\nlike Bunyan, he threw himself heart and soul into the conflicts of his age,\r\nand became by his public speech a mighty power among the common people.\r\nUnlike Jeremy Taylor, who wrote for the learned, and whose involved\r\nsentences and classical allusions are sometimes hard to follow, Baxter went\r\nstraight to his mark, appealing directly to the judgment and feeling of his\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\nThe number of his works is almost incredible when one thinks of his busy\r\nlife as a preacher and the slowness of manual writing. In all, he left\r\nnearly one hundred and seventy different works, which if collected would\r\nmake fifty or sixty volumes. As he wrote chiefly to influence men on the\r\nimmediate questions of the day, most of this work has fallen into oblivion.\r\nHis two most famous books are _The Saints' Everlasting Rest_ and _A Call to\r\nthe Unconverted_, both of which were exceedingly popular, running through\r\nscores of successive editions, and have been widely read in our own\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nIZAAK WALTON (1593-1683). Walton was a small tradesman of London, who\r\npreferred trout brooks and good reading to the profits of business and the\r\ndoubtful joys of a city life; so at fifty years, when he had saved a little\r\nmoney, he left the city and followed his heart out into the country. He\r\nbegan his literary work, or rather his recreation, by writing his famous\r\n_Lives_,--kindly and readable appreciations of Donne, Wotton, Hooker,\r\nHerbert, and Sanderson, which stand at the beginning of modern biographical\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nIn 1653 appeared _The Compleat Angler_, which has grown steadily in\r\nappreciation, and which is probably more widely read than any other book on\r\nthe subject of fishing. It begins with a conversation between a falconer, a\r\nhunter, and an angler; but the angler soon does most of the talking, as\r\nfishermen sometimes do; the hunter becomes a disciple, and learns by the\r\neasy method of hearing the fisherman discourse about his art. The\r\nconversations, it must be confessed, are often diffuse and pedantic; but\r\nthey only make us feel most comfortably sleepy, as one invariably feels\r\nafter a good day's fishing. So kindly is the spirit of the angler, so\r\nexquisite his appreciation of the beauty of the earth and sky, that one\r\nreturns to the book, as to a favorite trout stream, with the undying\r\nexpectation of catching something. Among a thousand books on angling it\r\nstands almost alone in possessing a charming style, and so it will probably\r\nbe read as long as men go fishing. Best of all, it leads to a better\r\nappreciation of nature, and it drops little moral lessons into the reader's\r\nmind as gently as one casts a fly to a wary trout; so that one never\r\nsuspects his better nature is being angled for. Though we have sometimes\r\nseen anglers catch more than they need, or sneak ahead of brother fishermen\r\nto the best pools, we are glad, for Walton's sake, to overlook such\r\nunaccountable exceptions, and agree with the milkmaid that \"we love all\r\nanglers, they be such honest, civil, quiet men.\"\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE PURITAN PERIOD. The half century between 1625 and 1675 is\r\ncalled the Puritan period for two reasons: first, because Puritan standards\r\nprevailed for a time in England; and second, because the greatest literary\r\nfigure during all these years was the Puritan, John Milton. Historically\r\nthe age was one of tremendous conflict. The Puritan struggled for\r\nrighteousness and liberty, and because he prevailed, the age is one of\r\nmoral and political revolution. In his struggle for liberty the Puritan\r\noverthrew the corrupt monarchy, beheaded Charles I, and established the\r\nCommonwealth under Cromwell. The Commonwealth lasted but a few years, and\r\nthe restoration of Charles II in 1660 is often put as the end of the\r\nPuritan period. The age has no distinct limits, but overlaps the\r\nElizabethan period on one side, and the Restoration period on the other.\r\n\r\nThe age produced many writers, a few immortal books, and one of the world's\r\ngreat literary leaders. The literature of the age is extremely diverse in\r\ncharacter, and the diversity is due to the breaking up of the ideals of\r\npolitical and religious unity. This literature differs from that of the\r\npreceding age in three marked ways: (1) It has no unity of spirit, as in\r\nthe days of Elizabeth, resulting from the patriotic enthusiasm of all\r\nclasses. (2) In contrast with the hopefulness and vigor of Elizabethan\r\nwritings, much of the literature of this period is somber in character; it\r\nsaddens rather than inspires us. (3) It has lost the romantic impulse of\r\nyouth, and become critical and intellectual; it makes us think, rather than\r\nfeel deeply.\r\n\r\nIn our study we have noted (1) the Transition Poets, of whom Daniel is\r\nchief; (2) the Song Writers, Campion and Breton; (3) the Spenserian Poets,\r\nWither and Giles Fletcher; (4) the Metaphysical Poets, Donne and Herbert;\r\n(5) the Cavalier Poets, Herrick, Carew, Lovelace, and Suckling; (6) John\r\nMilton, his life, his early or Horton poems, his militant prose, and his\r\nlast great poetical works; (7) John Bunyan, his extraordinary life, and his\r\nchief work, _The Pilgrim's Progress;_ (8) the Minor Prose Writers, Burton,\r\nBrowne, Fuller, Taylor, Baxter, and Walton. Three books selected from this\r\ngroup are Browne's _Religio Medici_, Taylor's _Holy Living and Dying_, and\r\nWalton's _Complete Angler_.\r\n\r\nSELECTIONS FOR READING. _Milton_.

It seems a curious contradiction, at first glance,\r\nto place the return of Charles II at the beginning of modern England, as\r\nour historians are wont to do; for there was never a time when the progress\r\nof liberty, which history records, was more plainly turned backwards. The\r\nPuritan régime had been too severe; it had repressed too many natural\r\npleasures. Now, released from restraint, society abandoned the decencies of\r\nlife and the reverence for law itself, and plunged into excesses more\r\nunnatural than had been the restraints of Puritanism. The inevitable effect\r\nof excess is disease, and for almost an entire generation following the\r\nRestoration, in 1660, England lay sick of a fever. Socially, politically,\r\nmorally, London suggests an Italian city in the days of the Medici; and its\r\nliterature, especially its drama, often seems more like the delirium of\r\nillness than the expression of a healthy mind. But even a fever has its\r\nadvantages. Whatever impurity is in the blood \"is burnt and purged away,\"\r\nand a man rises from fever with a new strength and a new idea of the value\r\nof life, like King Hezekiah, who after his sickness and fear of death\r\nresolved to \"go softly\" all his days. The Restoration was the great crisis\r\nin English history; and that England lived through it was due solely to the\r\nstrength and excellence of that Puritanism which she thought she had flung\r\nto the winds when she welcomed back a vicious monarch at Dover. The chief\r\nlesson of the Restoration was this,--that it showed by awful contrast the\r\nnecessity of truth and honesty, and of a strong government of free men, for\r\nwhich the Puritan had stood like a rock in every hour of his rugged\r\nhistory. Through fever, England came slowly back to health; through gross\r\ncorruption in society and in the state England learned that her people were\r\nat heart sober, sincere, religious folk, and that their character was\r\nnaturally too strong to follow after pleasure and be satisfied. So\r\nPuritanism suddenly gained all that it had struggled for, and gained it\r\neven in the hour when all seemed lost, when Milton in his sorrow\r\nunconsciously portrayed the government of Charles and his Cabal in that\r\ntremendous scene of the council of the infernal peers in Pandemonium,\r\nplotting the ruin of the world.\r\n\r\nOf the king and his followers it is difficult to write temperately. Most of\r\nthe dramatic literature of the time is atrocious, and we can understand it\r\nonly as we remember the character of the court and society for which it was\r\nwritten. Unspeakably vile in his private life, the king had no redeeming\r\npatriotism, no sense of responsibility to his country for even his public\r\nacts. He gave high offices to blackguards, stole from the exchequer like a\r\ncommon thief, played off Catholics and Protestants against each other,\r\ndisregarding his pledges to both alike, broke his solemn treaty with the\r\nDutch and with his own ministers, and betrayed his country for French money\r\nto spend on his own pleasures. It is useless to paint the dishonor of a\r\ncourt which followed gayly after such a leader. The first Parliament, while\r\nit contained some noble and patriotic members, was dominated by young men\r\nwho remembered the excess of Puritan zeal, but forgot the despotism and\r\ninjustice which had compelled Puritanism to stand up and assert the manhood\r\nof England. These young politicians vied with the king in passing laws for\r\nthe subjugation of Church and State, and in their thirst for revenge upon\r\nall who had been connected with Cromwell's iron government. Once more a\r\nwretched formalism--that perpetual danger to the English Church--came to\r\nthe front and exercised authority over the free churches. The House of\r\nLords was largely increased by the creation of hereditary titles and\r\nestates for ignoble men and shameless women who had flattered the king's\r\nvanity. Even the Bench, that last strong refuge of English justice, was\r\ncorrupted by the appointment of judges, like the brutal Jeffreys, whose\r\naim, like that of their royal master, was to get money and to exercise\r\npower without personal responsibility. Amid all this dishonor the foreign\r\ninfluence and authority of Cromwell's strong government vanished like\r\nsmoke. The valiant little Dutch navy swept the English fleet from the sea,\r\nand only the thunder of Dutch guns in the Thames, under the very windows of\r\nLondon, awoke the nation to the realization of how low it had fallen.\r\n\r\nTwo considerations must modify our judgment of this disheartening\r\nspectacle. First, the king and his court are not England. Though our\r\nhistories are largely filled with the records of kings and soldiers, of\r\nintrigues and fighting, these no more express the real life of a people\r\nthan fever and delirium express a normal manhood. Though king and court and\r\nhigh society arouse our disgust or pity, records are not wanting to show\r\nthat private life in England remained honest and pure even in the worst\r\ndays of the Restoration. While London society might be entertained by the\r\ndegenerate poetry of Rochester and the dramas of Dryden and Wycherley,\r\nEnglish scholars hailed Milton with delight; and the common people followed\r\nBunyan and Baxter with their tremendous appeal to righteousness and\r\nliberty. Second, the king, with all his pretensions to divine right,\r\nremained only a figurehead; and the Anglo-Saxon people, when they tire of\r\none figurehead, have always the will and the power to throw it overboard\r\nand choose a better one. The country was divided into two political\r\nparties: the Whigs, who sought to limit the royal power in the interests of\r\nParliament and the people; and the Tories, who strove to check the growing\r\npower of the people in the interests of their hereditary rulers. Both\r\nparties, however, were largely devoted to the Anglican Church; and when\r\nJames II, after four years of misrule, attempted to establish a national\r\nCatholicism by intrigues which aroused the protest of the Pope[171] as well\r\nas of Parliament, then Whigs and Tories, Catholics and Protestants, united\r\nin England's last great revolution.\r\n\r\nThe complete and bloodless Revolution of 1688, which called William of\r\nOrange to the throne, was simply the indication of England's restored\r\nhealth and sanity. It proclaimed that she had not long forgotten, and could\r\nnever again forget, the lesson taught her by Puritanism in its hundred\r\nyears of struggle and sacrifice. Modern England was firmly established by\r\nthe Revolution, which was brought about by the excesses of the Restoration.\r\n\r\nLITERARY CHARACTERISTICS. In the literature of the Restoration we note a\r\nsudden breaking away from old standards, just as society broke away from\r\nthe restraints of Puritanism. Many of the literary men had been driven out\r\nof England with Charles and his court, or else had followed their patrons\r\ninto exile in the days of the Commonwealth. On their return they renounced\r\nold ideals and demanded that English poetry and drama should follow the\r\nstyle to which they had become accustomed in the gayety of Paris. We read\r\nwith astonishment in Pepys's _Diary_ (1660-1669) that he has been to see a\r\nplay called _Midsummer Night's Dream_, but that he will never go again to\r\nhear Shakespeare, \"for it is the most insipid, ridiculous play that ever I\r\nsaw in my life.\" And again we read in the diary of Evelyn,--another writer\r\nwho reflects with wonderful accuracy the life and spirit of the\r\nRestoration,--\"I saw _Hamlet_ played; but now the old plays begin to\r\ndisgust this refined age, since his Majesty's being so long abroad.\" Since\r\nShakespeare and the Elizabethans were no longer interesting, literary men\r\nbegan to imitate the French writers, with whose works they had just grown\r\nfamiliar; and here begins the so-called period of French influence, which\r\nshows itself in English literature for the next century, instead of the\r\nItalian influence which had been dominant since Spenser and the\r\nElizabethans.\r\n\r\nOne has only to consider for a moment the French writers of this period,\r\nPascal, Bossuet, Fénelon, Malherbe, Corneille, Racine, Molière,--all that\r\nbrilliant company which makes the reign of Louis XIV the Elizabethan Age of\r\nFrench literature,--to see how far astray the early writers of the\r\nRestoration went in their wretched imitation. When a man takes another for\r\nhis model, he should copy virtues not vices; but unfortunately many English\r\nwriters reversed the rule, copying the vices of French comedy without any\r\nof its wit or delicacy or abundant ideas. The poems of Rochester, the plays\r\nof Dryden, Wycherley, Congreve, Vanbrugh, and Farquhar, all popular in\r\ntheir day, are mostly unreadable. Milton's \"sons of Belial, flown with\r\ninsolence and wine,\" is a good expression of the vile character of the\r\ncourt writers and of the London theaters for thirty years following the\r\nRestoration. Such work can never satisfy a people, and when Jeremy\r\nCollier,[172] in 1698, published a vigorous attack upon the evil plays and\r\nthe playwrights of the day, all London, tired of the coarseness and\r\nexcesses of the Restoration, joined the literary revolution, and the\r\ncorrupt drama was driven from the stage.\r\n\r\nWith the final rejection of the Restoration drama we reach a crisis in the\r\nhistory of our literature. The old Elizabethan spirit, with its patriotism,\r\nits creative vigor, its love of romance, and the Puritan spirit with its\r\nmoral earnestness and individualism, were both things of the past; and at\r\nfirst there was nothing to take their places. Dryden, the greatest writer\r\nof the age, voiced a general complaint when he said that in his prose and\r\npoetry he was \"drawing the outlines\" of a new art, but had no teacher to\r\ninstruct him. But literature is a progressive art, and soon the writers of\r\nthe age developed two marked tendencies of their own,--the tendency to\r\nrealism, and the tendency to that preciseness and elegance of expression\r\nwhich marks our literature for the next hundred years.\r\n\r\nIn realism--that is, the representation of men exactly as they are, the\r\nexpression of the plain, unvarnished truth without regard to ideals or\r\nromance--the tendency was at first thoroughly bad. The early Restoration\r\nwriters sought to paint realistic pictures of a corrupt court and society,\r\nand, as we have suggested, they emphasized vices rather than virtues, and\r\ngave us coarse, low plays without interest or moral significance. Like\r\nHobbes, they saw only the externals of man, his body and appetites, not his\r\nsoul and its ideals; and so, like most realists, they resemble a man lost\r\nin the woods, who wanders aimlessly around in circles, seeing the confusing\r\ntrees but never the whole forest, and who seldom thinks of climbing the\r\nnearest high hill to get his bearings. Later, however, this tendency to\r\nrealism became more wholesome. While it neglected romantic poetry, in which\r\nyouth is eternally interested, it led to a keener study of the practical\r\nmotives which govern human action.\r\n\r\nThe second tendency of the age was toward directness and simplicity of\r\nexpression, and to this excellent tendency our literature is greatly\r\nindebted. In both the Elizabethan and the Puritan ages the general tendency\r\nof writers was towards extravagance of thought and language. Sentences were\r\noften involved, and loaded with Latin quotations and classical allusions.\r\nThe Restoration writers opposed this vigorously. From France they brought\r\nback the tendency to regard established rules for writing, to emphasize\r\nclose reasoning rather than romantic fancy, and to use short, clean-cut\r\nsentences without an unnecessary word. We see this French influence in the\r\nRoyal Society,[173] which had for one of its objects the reform of English\r\nprose by getting rid of its \"swellings of style,\" and which bound all its\r\nmembers to use \"a close, naked, natural way of speaking ... as near to\r\nmathematical plainness as they can.\" Dryden accepted this excellent rule\r\nfor his prose, and adopted the heroic couplet, as the next best thing, for\r\nthe greater part of his poetry. As he tells us himself:\r\n\r\n    And this unpolished rugged verse I chose\r\n    As fittest for discourse, and nearest prose.\r\n\r\nIt is largely due to him that writers developed that formalism of style,\r\nthat precise, almost mathematical elegance, miscalled classicism, which\r\nruled English literature for the next century.[174]\r\n\r\nAnother thing which the reader will note with interest in Restoration\r\nliterature is the adoption of the heroic couplet; that is, two iambic\r\npentameter lines which rime together, as the most suitable form of poetry.\r\nWaller,[175] who began to use it in 1623, is generally regarded as the\r\nfather of the couplet, for he is the first poet to use it consistently in\r\nthe bulk of his poetry. Chaucer had used the rimed couplet wonderfully well\r\nin his _Canterbury Tales_, but in Chaucer it is the poetical thought more\r\nthan the expression which delights us. With the Restoration writers, form\r\ncounts for everything. Waller and Dryden made the couplet the prevailing\r\nliterary fashion, and in their hands the couplet becomes \"closed\"; that is,\r\neach pair of lines must contain a complete thought, stated as precisely as\r\npossible. Thus Waller writes:\r\n\r\n    The soul's dark cottage, battered and decayed,\r\n    Lets in new light through chinks that time has made.[176]\r\n\r\nThat is a kind of aphorism such as Pope made in large quantities in the\r\nfollowing age. It contains a thought, is catchy, quotable, easy to\r\nremember; and the Restoration writers delighted in it. Soon this mechanical\r\nclosed couplet, in which the second line was often made first,[177] almost\r\nexcluded all other forms of poetry. It was dominant in England for a full\r\ncentury, and we have grown familiar with it, and somewhat weary of its\r\nmonotony, in such famous poems as Pope's \"Essay on Man\" and Goldsmith's\r\n\"Deserted Village.\" These, however, are essays rather than poems. That even\r\nthe couplet is capable of melody and variety is shown in Chaucer's _Tales_\r\nand in Keats's exquisite _Endymion_.\r\n\r\nThese four things, the tendency to vulgar realism in the drama, a general\r\nformalism which came from following set rules, the development of a simpler\r\nand more direct prose style, and the prevalence of the heroic couplet in\r\npoetry are the main characteristics of Restoration literature. They are all\r\nexemplified in the work of one man, John Dryden.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN DRYDEN (1631-1700)\r\n\r\nDryden is the greatest literary figure of the Restoration, and in his work\r\nwe have an excellent reflection of both the good and the evil tendencies of\r\nthe age in which he lived. If we can think for a moment of literature as a\r\ncanal of water, we may appreciate the figure that Dryden is the \"lock by\r\nwhich the waters of English poetry were let down from the mountains of\r\nShakespeare and Milton to the plain of Pope\"; that is, he stands between\r\ntwo very different ages, and serves as a transition from one to the other.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Dryden's life contains so many conflicting elements of greatness and\r\nlittleness that the biographer is continually taken away from the facts,\r\nwhich are his chief concern, to judge motives, which are manifestly outside\r\nhis knowledge and business. Judged by his own opinion of himself, as\r\nexpressed in the numerous prefaces to his works, Dryden was the soul of\r\ncandor, writing with no other master than literature, and with no other\r\nobject than to advance the welfare of his age and nation. Judged by his\r\nacts, he was apparently a timeserver, catering to a depraved audience in\r\nhis dramas, and dedicating his work with much flattery to those who were\r\neasily cajoled by their vanity into sharing their purse and patronage. In\r\nthis, however, he only followed the general custom of the time, and is\r\nabove many of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nDryden was born in the village of Aldwinkle, Northamptonshire, in 1631. His\r\nfamily were prosperous people, who brought him up in the strict Puritan\r\nfaith, and sent him first to the famous Westminster school and then to\r\nCambridge. He made excellent use of his opportunities and studied eagerly,\r\nbecoming one of the best educated men of his age, especially in the\r\nclassics. Though of remarkable literary taste, he showed little evidence of\r\nliterary ability up to the age of thirty. By his training and family\r\nconnections he was allied to the Puritan party, and his only well-known\r\nwork of this period, the \"Heroic Stanzas,\" was written on the death of\r\nCromwell:\r\n\r\n    His grandeur he derived from Heaven alone,\r\n      For he was great ere Fortune made him so;\r\n    And wars, like mists that rise against the sun,\r\n      Made him but greater seem, not greater grow.\r\n\r\nIn these four lines, taken almost at random from the \"Heroic Stanzas,\" we\r\nhave an epitome of the thought, the preciseness, and the polish that mark\r\nall his literary work.\r\n\r\nThis poem made Dryden well known, and he was in a fair way to become the\r\nnew poet of Puritanism when the Restoration made a complete change in his\r\nmethods. He had come to London for a literary life, and when the Royalists\r\nwere again in power he placed himself promptly on the winning side. His\r\n\"Astraea Redux,\" a poem of welcome to Charles II, and his \"Panegyric to his\r\nSacred Majesty,\" breathe more devotion to \"the old goat,\" as the king was\r\nknown to his courtiers, than had his earlier poems to Puritanism.\r\n\r\nIn 1667 he became more widely known and popular by his \"Annus Mirabilis,\" a\r\nnarrative poem describing the terrors of the great fire in London and some\r\nevents of the disgraceful war with Holland; but with the theaters reopened\r\nand nightly filled, the drama offered the most attractive field to one who\r\nmade his living by literature; so Dryden turned to the stage and agreed to\r\nfurnish three plays yearly for the actors of the King's Theater. For nearly\r\ntwenty years, the best of his life, Dryden gave himself up to this\r\nunfortunate work. Both by nature and habit he seems to have been clean in\r\nhis personal life; but the stage demanded unclean plays, and Dryden\r\nfollowed his audience. That he deplored this is evident from some of his\r\nlater work, and we have his statement that he wrote only one play, his\r\nbest, to please himself. This was _All for Love_, which was written in\r\nblank verse, most of the others being in rimed couplets.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Dryden had become the best known literary man of London,\r\nand was almost as much a dictator to the literary set which gathered in the\r\ntaverns and coffeehouses as Ben Jonson had been before him. His work,\r\nmeanwhile, was rewarded by large financial returns, and by his being\r\nappointed poet laureate and collector of the port of London. The latter\r\noffice, it may be remembered, had once been held by Chaucer.\r\n\r\nAt fifty years of age, and before Jeremy Collier had driven his dramas from\r\nthe stage, Dryden turned from dramatic work to throw himself into the\r\nstrife of religion and politics, writing at this period his numerous prose\r\nand poetical treatises. In 1682 appeared his _Religio Laici_ (Religion of a\r\nLayman), defending the Anglican Church against all other sects, especially\r\nthe Catholics and Presbyterians; but three years later, when James II came\r\nto the throne with schemes to establish the Roman faith, Dryden turned\r\nCatholic and wrote his most famous religious poem, \"The Hind and the\r\nPanther,\" beginning:\r\n\r\n    A milk-white Hind, immortal and unchanged,\r\n    Fed on the lawns and in the forest ranged;\r\n    Without unspotted, innocent within,\r\n    She feared no danger, for she knew no sin.\r\n\r\nThis hind is a symbol for the Roman Church; and the Anglicans, as a\r\npanther, are represented as persecuting the faithful. Numerous other\r\nsects--Calvinists, Anabaptists, Quakers--were represented by the wolf,\r\nboar, hare, and other animals, which gave the poet an excellent chance for\r\nexercising his satire. Dryden's enemies made the accusation, often since\r\nrepeated, of hypocrisy in thus changing his church; but that he was sincere\r\nin the matter can now hardly be questioned, for he knew how to \"suffer for\r\nthe faith\" and to be true to his religion, even when it meant misjudgment\r\nand loss of fortune. At the Revolution of 1688 he refused allegiance to\r\nWilliam of Orange; he was deprived of all his offices and pensions, and as\r\nan old man was again thrown back on literature as his only means of\r\nlivelihood. He went to work with extraordinary courage and energy, writing\r\nplays, poems, prefaces for other men, eulogies for funeral occasions,--\r\nevery kind of literary work that men would pay for. His most successful\r\nwork at this time was his translations, which resulted in the complete\r\n_Aeneid_ and many selections from Homer, Ovid, and Juvenal, appearing in\r\nEnglish rimed couplets. His most enduring poem, the splendid ode called\r\n\"Alexander's Feast,\" was written in 1697. Three years later he published\r\nhis last work, _Fables_, containing poetical paraphrases of the tales of\r\nBoccaccio and Chaucer, and the miscellaneous poems of his last years. Long\r\nprefaces were the fashion in Dryden's day, and his best critical work is\r\nfound in his introductions. The preface to the _Fables_ is generally\r\nadmired as an example of the new prose style developed by Dryden and his\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\nFrom the literary view point these last troubled years were the best of\r\nDryden's life, though they were made bitter by obscurity and by the\r\ncriticism of his numerous enemies. He died in 1700 and was buried near\r\nChaucer in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF DRYDEN. The numerous dramatic works of Dryden are best left in\r\nthat obscurity into which they have fallen. Now and then they contain a bit\r\nof excellent lyric poetry, and in _All for Love_, another version of\r\n_Antony and Cleopatra_, where he leaves his cherished heroic couplet for\r\nthe blank verse of Marlowe and Shakespeare, he shows what he might have\r\ndone had he not sold his talents to a depraved audience. On the whole,\r\nreading his plays is like nibbling at a rotting apple; even the good spots\r\nare affected by the decay, and one ends by throwing the whole thing into\r\nthe garbage can, where most of the dramatic works of this period belong.\r\n\r\nThe controversial and satirical poems are on a higher plane; though, it\r\nmust be confessed, Dryden's satire often strikes us as cutting and\r\nrevengeful, rather than witty. The best known of these, and a masterpiece\r\nof its kind, is \"Absalom and Achitophel,\" which is undoubtedly the most\r\npowerful political satire in our language. Taking the Bible story of David\r\nand Absalom, he uses it to ridicule the Whig party and also to revenge\r\nhimself upon his enemies. Charles II appeared as King David; his natural\r\nson, the Duke of Monmouth, who was mixed up in the Rye House Plot, paraded\r\nas Absalom; Shaftesbury was Achitophel, the evil Counselor; and the Duke of\r\nBuckingham was satirized as Zimri. The poem had enormous political\r\ninfluence, and raised Dryden, in the opinion of his contemporaries, to the\r\nfront rank of English poets. Two extracts from the powerful\r\ncharacterizations of Achitophel and Zimri are given here to show the style\r\nand spirit of the whole work.\r\n\r\n            (SHAFTESBURY)\r\n    Of these the false Achitophel was first;\r\n    A name to all succeeding ages cursed:\r\n    For close designs and crooked counsels fit;\r\n    Sagacious, bold, and turbulent of wit;\r\n    Restless, unfixed in principles and place;\r\n    In power unpleased, impatient of disgrace:\r\n    A fiery soul, which, working out its way,\r\n    Fretted the pygmy body to decay....\r\n    A daring pilot in extremity,\r\n    Pleased with the danger, when the waves went high\r\n    He sought the storms: but for a calm unfit,\r\n    Would steer too nigh the sands to boast his wit.\r\n    Great wits are sure to madness near allied,\r\n    And thin partitions do their bounds divide;\r\n    Else why should he, with wealth and honor blest,\r\n    Refuse his age the needful hours of rest?\r\n    Punish a body which he could not please;\r\n    Bankrupt of life, yet prodigal of ease?\r\n    And all to leave what with his toil he won,\r\n    To that unfeathered two-legged thing, a son....\r\n    In friendship false, implacable in hate;\r\n    Resolved to ruin or to rule the state;...\r\n    Then seized with fear, yet still affecting fame,\r\n    Usurped a patriot's all-atoning name.\r\n    So easy still it proves in factious times\r\n    With public zeal to cancel private crimes.\r\n         (THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM)\r\n    Some of their chiefs were princes of the land;\r\n    In the first rank of these did Zimri stand,\r\n    A man so various, that he seemed to be\r\n    Not one, but all mankind's epitome:\r\n    Stiff in opinions, always in the wrong,\r\n    Was everything by starts and nothing long;\r\n    But, in the course of one revolving moon,\r\n    Was chymist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon;\r\n    Then all for women, painting, rhyming, drinking,\r\n    Besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking.\r\n    Blest madman, who could every hour employ\r\n    With something new to wish or to enjoy!\r\n    Railing and praising were his usual themes,\r\n    And both, to show his judgment, in extremes:\r\n    So over-violent, or over-civil,\r\n    That every man with him was God or devil.\r\n\r\nOf the many miscellaneous poems of Dryden, the curious reader will get an\r\nidea of his sustained narrative power from the _Annus Mirabilis_. The best\r\nexpression of Dryden's literary genius, however, is found in \"Alexander's\r\nFeast,\" which is his most enduring ode, and one of the best in our\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nAs a prose writer Dryden had a very marked influence on our literature in\r\nshortening his sentences, and especially in writing naturally, without\r\ndepending on literary ornamentation to give effect to what he is saying. If\r\nwe compare his prose with that of Milton, or Browne, or Jeremy Taylor, we\r\nnote that Dryden cares less for style than any of the others, but takes\r\nmore pains to state his thought clearly and concisely, as men speak when\r\nthey wish to be understood. The classical school, which followed the\r\nRestoration, looked to Dryden as a leader, and to him we owe largely that\r\ntendency to exactness of expression which marks our subsequent prose\r\nwriting. With his prose, Dryden rapidly developed his critical ability, and\r\nbecame the foremost critic[178] of his age. His criticisms, instead of\r\nbeing published as independent works, were generally used as prefaces or\r\nintroductions to his poetry. The best known of these criticisms are the\r\npreface to the _Fables_, \"Of Heroic Plays,\" \"Discourse on Satire,\" and\r\nespecially the \"Essay of Dramatic Poesy\" (1668), which attempts to lay a\r\nfoundation for all literary criticism.\r\n\r\nDRYDEN'S INFLUENCE ON LITERATURE. Dryden's place among authors is due\r\npartly to his great influence on the succeeding age of classicism. Briefly,\r\nthis influence may be summed up by noting the three new elements which he\r\nbrought into our literature. These are: (1) the establishment of the heroic\r\ncouplet as the fashion for satiric, didactic, and descriptive poetry; (2)\r\nhis development of a direct, serviceable prose style such as we still\r\ncultivate; and (3) his development of the art of literary criticism in his\r\nessays and in the numerous prefaces to his poems. This is certainly a large\r\nwork for one man to accomplish, and Dryden is worthy of honor, though\r\ncomparatively little of what he wrote is now found on our bookshelves.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL BUTLER (1612-1680). In marked contrast with Dryden, who devoted his\r\nlife to literature and won his success by hard work, is Samuel Butler, who\r\njumped into fame by a single, careless work, which represents not any\r\nserious intent or effort, but the pastime of an idle hour. We are to\r\nremember that, though the Royalists had triumphed in the Restoration, the\r\nPuritan spirit was not dead, nor even sleeping, and that the Puritan held\r\nsteadfastly to his own principles. Against these principles of justice,\r\ntruth, and liberty there was no argument, since they expressed the manhood\r\nof England; but many of the Puritan practices were open to ridicule, and\r\nthe Royalists, in revenge for their defeat, began to use ridicule without\r\nmercy. During the early years of the Restoration doggerel verses ridiculing\r\nPuritanism, and burlesque,--that is, a ridiculous representation of serious\r\nsubjects, or a serious representation of ridiculous subjects,--were the\r\nmost popular form of literature with London society. Of all this burlesque\r\nand doggerel the most famous is Butler's _Hudibras_, a work to which we can\r\ntrace many of the prejudices that still prevail against Puritanism.\r\n\r\nOf Butler himself we know little; he is one of the most obscure figures in\r\nour literature. During the days of Cromwell's Protectorate he was in the\r\nemploy of Sir Samuel Luke, a crabbed and extreme type of Puritan nobleman,\r\nand here he collected his material and probably wrote the first part of his\r\nburlesque, which, of course, he did not dare to publish until after the\r\nRestoration.\r\n\r\n_Hudibras_ is plainly modeled upon the _Don Quixote_ of Cervantes. It\r\ndescribes the adventures of a fanatical justice of the peace, Sir Hudibras,\r\nand of his squire, Ralpho, in their endeavor to put down all innocent\r\npleasures. In Hudibras and Ralpho the two extreme types of the Puritan\r\nparty, Presbyterians and Independents, are mercilessly ridiculed. When the\r\npoem first appeared in public, in 1663, after circulating secretly for\r\nyears in manuscript, it became at once enormously popular. The king carried\r\na copy in his pocket, and courtiers vied with each other in quoting its\r\nmost scurrilous passages. A second and a third part, continuing the\r\nadventures of Hudibras, were published in 1664 and 1668. At best the work\r\nis a wretched doggerel, but it was clever enough and strikingly original;\r\nand since it expressed the Royalist spirit towards the Puritans, it\r\nspeedily found its place in a literature which reflects every phase of\r\nhuman life. A few odd lines are given here to show the character of the\r\nwork, and to introduce the reader to the best known burlesque in our\r\nlanguage:\r\n\r\n      He was in logic a great critic,\r\n    Profoundly skilled in analytic;\r\n    He could distinguish, and divide\r\n    A hair 'twixt south and southwest side;\r\n    On either which he would dispute,\r\n    Confute, change hands, and still confute;\r\n    He'd undertake to prove, by force\r\n    Of argument, a man's no horse;\r\n    He'd run in debt by disputation,\r\n    And pay with ratiocination.\r\n    For he was of that stubborn crew\r\n    Of errant saints, whom all men grant\r\n    To be the true Church Militant;\r\n    Such as do build their faith upon\r\n    The holy text of pike and gun;\r\n    Decide all controversies by\r\n    Infallible artillery;\r\n    And prove their doctrine orthodox\r\n    By apostolic blows and knocks;\r\n    Compound for sins they are inclined to,\r\n    By damning those they have no mind to.\r\n\r\nHOBBES AND LOCKE. Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) is one of the writers that\r\npuzzle the historian with a doubt as to whether or not he should be\r\nincluded in the story of literature. The one book for which he is famous is\r\ncalled _Leviathan, or the Matter, Form, and Power of a Commonwealth_\r\n(1651). It is partly political, partly a philosophical book, combining two\r\ncentral ideas which challenge and startle the attention, namely, that\r\nself-interest is the only guiding power of humanity, and that blind\r\nsubmission to rulers is the only true basis of government.[179] In a word,\r\nHobbes reduced human nature to its purely animal aspects, and then asserted\r\nconfidently that there was nothing more to study. Certainly, therefore, as\r\na reflection of the underlying spirit of Charles and his followers it has\r\nno equal in any purely literary work of the time.\r\n\r\nJohn Locke (1632-1704) is famous as the author of a single great\r\nphilosophical work, the _Essay concerning Human Understanding_ (1690). This\r\nis a study of the nature of the human mind and of the origin of ideas,\r\nwhich, far more than the work of Bacon and Hobbes, is the basis upon which\r\nEnglish philosophy has since been built. Aside from their subjects, both\r\nworks are models of the new prose, direct, simple, convincing, for which\r\nDryden and the Royal Society labored. They are known to every student of\r\nphilosophy, but are seldom included in a work of literature.[180]\r\n\r\nEVELYN AND PEPYS. These two men, John Evelyn (1620-1706) and Samuel Pepys\r\n(1633-1703), are famous as the writers of diaries, in which they jotted\r\ndown the daily occurrences of their own lives, without any thought that the\r\nworld would ever see or be interested in what they had written.\r\n\r\nEvelyn was the author of _Sylva_, the first book on trees and forestry in\r\nEnglish, and _Terra_, which is the first attempt at a scientific study of\r\nagriculture; but the world has lost sight of these two good books, while it\r\ncherishes his diary, which extends over the greater part of his life and\r\ngives us vivid pictures of society in his time, and especially of the\r\nfrightful corruption of the royal court.\r\n\r\nPepys began life in a small way as a clerk in a government office, but soon\r\nrose by his diligence and industry to be Secretary of the Admiralty. Here\r\nhe was brought into contact with every grade of society, from the king's\r\nministers to the poor sailors of the fleet. Being inquisitive as a blue\r\njay, he investigated the rumors and gossip of the court, as well as the\r\nsmall affairs of his neighbors, and wrote them all down in his diary with\r\nevident interest. But because he chattered most freely, and told his little\r\nbook a great many secrets which it were not well for the world to know, he\r\nconcealed everything in shorthand,--and here again he was like the blue\r\njay, which carries off and hides every bright trinket it discovers. The\r\n_Diary_ covers the years from 1660 to 1669, and gossips about everything,\r\nfrom his own position and duties at the office, his dress and kitchen and\r\ncook and children, to the great political intrigues of office and the\r\nscandals of high society. No other such minute-picture of the daily life of\r\nan age has been written. Yet for a century and a half it remained entirely\r\nunknown, and not until 1825 was Pepys's shorthand deciphered and published.\r\nSince then it has been widely read, and is still one of the most\r\ninteresting examples of diary writing that we possess. Following are a few\r\nextracts,[181] covering only a few days in April, 1663, from which one may\r\ninfer the minute and interesting character of the work that this clerk,\r\npolitician, president of the Royal Society, and general busybody wrote to\r\nplease himself:\r\n\r\nApril 1st. I went to the Temple to my Cozen Roger Pepys, to see and talk\r\nwith him a little: who tells me that, with much ado, the Parliament do\r\nagree to throw down Popery; but he says it is with so much spite and\r\npassion, and an endeavor of bringing all Nonconformists into the same\r\ncondition, that he is afeard matters will not go so well as he could\r\nwish.... To my office all the afternoon; Lord! how Sir J. Minnes, like a\r\nmad coxcomb, did swear and stamp, swearing that Commissioner Pett hath\r\nstill the old heart against the King that ever he had, ... and all the\r\ndamnable reproaches in the world, at which I was ashamed, but said little;\r\nbut, upon the whole, I find him still a foole, led by the nose with stories\r\ntold by Sir W. Batten, whether with or without reason. So, vexed in my mind\r\nto see things ordered so unlike gentlemen, or men of reason, I went home\r\nand to bed.\r\n\r\n3d. To White Hall and to Chappell, which being most monstrous full, I could\r\nnot go into my pew, but sat among the quire. Dr. Creeton, the Scotchman,\r\npreached a most admirable, good, learned, honest, and most severe sermon,\r\nyet comicall.... He railed bitterly ever and anon against John Calvin and\r\nhis brood, the Presbyterians, and against the present terme, now in use, of\r\n\"tender consciences.\" He ripped up Hugh Peters (calling him the execrable\r\nskellum), his preaching and stirring up the mayds of the city to bring in\r\ntheir bodkins and thimbles. Thence going out of White Hall, I met Captain\r\nGrove, who did give me a letter directed to myself from himself. I\r\ndiscerned money to be in it, and took it, knowing, as I found it to be, the\r\nproceed of the place I have got him, the taking up of vessels for Tangier.\r\nBut I did not open it till I came home to my office, and there I broke it\r\nopen, not looking into it till all the money was out, that I might say I\r\nsaw no money in the paper, if ever I should be questioned about it. There\r\nwas a piece of gold and 4£ in silver.\r\n\r\n4th. To my office. Home to dinner, whither by and by comes Roger Pepys,\r\netc. Very merry at, before, and after dinner, and the more for that my\r\ndinner was great, and most neatly dressed by our owne only mayde. We had a\r\nfricasee of rabbits and chickens, a leg of mutton boiled, three carps in a\r\ndish, a great dish of a side of lambe, a dish of roasted pigeons, a dish of\r\nfour lobsters, three tarts, a lamprey pie (a most rare pie), a dish of\r\nanchovies, good wine of several sorts, and all things mighty noble and to\r\nmy great content.\r\n\r\n5th (Lord's day). Up and spent the morning, till the Barber came, in\r\nreading in my chamber part of Osborne's Advice to his Son, which I shall\r\nnot never enough admire for sense and language, and being by and by\r\ntrimmed, to Church, myself, wife, Ashwell, etc. Home and, while dinner was\r\nprepared, to my office to read over my vows with great affection and to\r\nvery good purpose. Then to church again, where a simple bawling young Scot\r\npreached.\r\n\r\n19th (Easter day). Up and this day put on my close-kneed coloured suit,\r\nwhich, with new stockings of the colour, with belt and new gilt-handled\r\nsword, is very handsome. To church alone, and after dinner to church again,\r\nwhere the young Scotchman preaching, I slept all the while. After supper,\r\nfell in discourse of dancing, and I find that Ashwell hath a very fine\r\ncarriage, which makes my wife almost ashamed of herself to see herself so\r\noutdone, but to-morrow she begins to learn to dance for a month or two. So\r\nto prayers and to bed. Will being gone, with my leave, to his father's this\r\nday for a day or two, to take physique these holydays.\r\n\r\n23d. St. George's day and Coronacion, the King and Court being at Windsor,\r\nat the installing of the King of Denmarke by proxy and the Duke of\r\nMonmouth.... Spent the evening with my father. At cards till late, and\r\nbeing at supper, my boy being sent for some mustard to a neat's tongue, the\r\nrogue staid half an houre in the streets, it seems at a bonfire, at which I\r\nwas very angry, and resolve to beat him to-morrow.\r\n\r\n24th. Up betimes, and with my salt eele went down into the parler and there\r\ngot my boy and did beat him till I was fain to take breath two or three\r\ntimes, yet for all I am afeard it will make the boy never the better, he is\r\ngrown so hardened in his tricks, which I am sorry for, he being capable of\r\nmaking a brave man, and is a boy that I and my wife love very well.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE RESTORATION PERIOD. The chief thing to note in England\r\nduring the Restoration is the tremendous social reaction from the\r\nrestraints of Puritanism, which suggests the wide swing of a pendulum from\r\none extreme to the other. For a generation many natural pleasures had been\r\nsuppressed; now the theaters were reopened, bull and bear baiting revived,\r\nand sports, music, dancing,--a wild delight in the pleasures and vanities\r\nof this world replaced that absorption in \"other-worldliness\" which\r\ncharacterized the extreme of Puritanism.\r\n\r\nIn literature the change is no less marked. From the Elizabethan drama\r\nplaywrights turned to coarse, evil scenes, which presently disgusted the\r\npeople and were driven from the stage. From romance, writers turned to\r\nrealism; from Italian influence with its exuberance of imagination they\r\nturned to France, and learned to repress the emotions, to follow the head\r\nrather than the heart, and to write in a clear, concise, formal style,\r\naccording to set rules. Poets turned from the noble blank verse of\r\nShakespeare and Milton, from the variety and melody which had characterized\r\nEnglish poetry since Chaucer's day, to the monotonous heroic couplet with\r\nits mechanical perfection.\r\n\r\nThe greatest writer of the age is John Dryden, who established the heroic\r\ncouplet as the prevailing verse form in English poetry, and who developed a\r\nnew and serviceable prose style suited to the practical needs of the age.\r\nThe popular ridicule of Puritanism in burlesque and doggerel is best\r\nexemplified in Butler's _Hudibras_. The realistic tendency, the study of\r\nfacts and of men as they are, is shown in the work of the Royal Society, in\r\nthe philosophy of Hobbes and Locke, and in the diaries of Evelyn and Pepys,\r\nwith their minute pictures of social life. The age was one of transition\r\nfrom the exuberance and vigor of Renaissance literature to the formality\r\nand polish of the Augustan Age. In strong contrast with the preceding ages,\r\ncomparatively little of Restoration literature is familiar to modern\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTIONS FOR READING. _Dryden_.

AUGUSTAN OR CLASSIC AGE\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE PERIOD. The Revolution of 1688, which banished the last of\r\nthe Stuart kings and called William of Orange to the throne, marks the end\r\nof the long struggle for political freedom in England. Thereafter the\r\nEnglishman spent his tremendous energy, which his forbears had largely\r\nspent in fighting for freedom, in endless political discussions and in\r\nefforts to improve his government. In order to bring about reforms, votes\r\nwere now necessary; and to get votes the people of England must be\r\napproached with ideas, facts, arguments, information. So the newspaper was\r\nborn,[182] and literature in its widest sense, including the book, the\r\nnewspaper, and the magazine, became the chief instrument of a nation's\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nThe first half of the eighteenth century is remarkable for the rapid social\r\ndevelopment in England. Hitherto men had been more or less governed by the\r\nnarrow, isolated standards of the Middle Ages, and when they differed they\r\nfell speedily to blows. Now for the first time they set themselves to the\r\ntask of learning the art of living together, while still holding different\r\nopinions. In a single generation nearly two thousand public coffeehouses,\r\neach a center of sociability, sprang up in London alone, and the number of\r\nprivate clubs is quite as astonishing.[183] This new social life had a\r\nmarked effect in polishing men's words and manners. The typical Londoner of\r\nQueen Anne's day was still rude, and a little vulgar in his tastes; the\r\ncity was still very filthy, the streets unlighted and infested at night by\r\nbands of rowdies and \"Mohawks\"; but outwardly men sought to refine their\r\nmanners according to prevailing standards; and to be elegant, to have \"good\r\nform,\" was a man's first duty, whether he entered society or wrote\r\nliterature. One can hardly read a book or poem of the age without feeling\r\nthis superficial elegance. Government still had its opposing Tory and Whig\r\nparties, and the Church was divided into Catholics, Anglicans, and\r\nDissenters; but the growing social life offset many antagonisms, producing\r\nat least the outward impression of peace and unity. Nearly every writer of\r\nthe age busied himself with religion as well as with party politics, the\r\nscientist Newton as sincerely as the churchman Barrow, the philosophical\r\nLocke no less earnestly than the evangelical Wesley; but nearly all\r\ntempered their zeal with moderation, and argued from reason and Scripture,\r\nor used delicate satire upon their opponents, instead of denouncing them as\r\nfollowers of Satan. There were exceptions, of course_;_ but the general\r\ntendency of the age was toward toleration. Man had found himself in the\r\nlong struggle for personal liberty; now he turned to the task of\r\ndiscovering his neighbor, of finding in Whig and Tory, in Catholic and\r\nProtestant, in Anglican and Dissenter, the same general human\r\ncharacteristics that he found in himself. This good work was helped,\r\nmoreover, by the spread of education and by the growth of the national\r\nspfrit, following the victories of Marlborough on the Continent. In the\r\nmidst of heated argument it needed only a word--Gibraltar, Blenheim,\r\nRamillies, Malplaquet--or a poem of victory written in a garret[184] to\r\ntell a patriotic people that under their many differences they were all\r\nalike Englishmen.\r\n\r\nIn the latter half of the century the political and social progress is\r\nalmost bewildering. The modern form of cabinet government responsible to\r\nParliament and the people had been established under George I; and in 1757\r\nthe cynical and corrupt practices of Walpole, premier of the first Tory\r\ncabinet, were replaced by the more enlightened policies of Pitt. Schools\r\nwere established; clubs and coffeehouses increased; books and magazines\r\nmultiplied until the press was the greatest visible power in England; the\r\nmodern great dailies, the _Chronicle, Post_, and _Times_, began their\r\ncareer of public education. Religiously, all the churches of England felt\r\nthe quickening power of that tremendous spiritual revival known as\r\nMethodism, under the preaching of Wesley and Whitefield. Outside her own\r\nborders three great men--Clive in India, Wolfe on the Plains of Abraham,\r\nCook in Australia and the islands of the Pacific--were unfurling the banner\r\nof St. George over the untold wealth of new lands, and spreading the\r\nworld-wide empire of the Anglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\nLITERARY CHARACTERISTICS. In every preceding age we have noted especially\r\nthe poetical works, which constitute, according to Matthew Arnold, the\r\nglory of English literature. Now for the first time we must chronicle the\r\ntriumph of English prose. A multitude of practical interests arising from\r\nthe new social and political conditions demanded expression, not simply in\r\nbooks, but more especially in pamphlets, magazines, and newspapers. Poetry\r\nwas inadequate for such a task; hence the development of prose, of the\r\n\"unfettered word,\" as Dante calls it,--a development which astonishes us by\r\nits rapidity and excellence. The graceful elegance of Addison's essays, the\r\nterse vigor of Swift's satires, the artistic finish of Fielding's novels,\r\nthe sonorous eloquence of Gibbon's history and of Burke's orations,--these\r\nhave no parallel in the poetry of the age. Indeed, poetry itself became\r\nprosaic in this respect, that it was used not for creative works of\r\nimagination, but for essays, for satire, for criticism,--for exactly the\r\nsame practical ends as was prose. The poetry of the first half of the\r\ncentury, as typified in the work of Pope, is polished and witty enough, but\r\nartificial; it lacks fire, fine feeling, enthusiasm, the glow of the\r\nElizabethan Age and the moral earnestness of Puritanism. In a word, it\r\ninterests us as a study of life, rather than delights or inspires us by its\r\nappeal to the imagination. The variety and excellence of prose works, and\r\nthe development of a serviceable prose style, which had been begun by\r\nDryden, until it served to express clearly every human interest and\r\nemotion,--these are the chief literary glories of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn the literature of the preceding age we noted two marked tendencies,--the\r\ntendency to realism in subject-matter, and the tendency to polish and\r\nrefinement of expression. Both these tendencies were continued in the\r\nAugustan Age, and are seen clearly in the poetry of Pope, who brought the\r\ncouplet to perfection, and in the prose of Addison. A third tendency is\r\nshown in the prevalence of satire, resulting from the unfortunate union of\r\npolitics with literature. We have already noted the power of the press in\r\nthis age, and the perpetual strife of political parties. Nearly every\r\nwriter of the first half of the century was used and rewarded by Whigs or\r\nTories for satirizing their enemies and for advancing their special\r\npolitical interests. Pope was a marked exception, but he nevertheless\r\nfollowed the prose writers in using satire too largely in his poetry. Now\r\nsatire--that is, a literary work which searches out the faults of men or\r\ninstitutions in order to hold them up to ridicule--is at best a destructive\r\nkind of criticism. A satirist is like a laborer who clears away the ruins\r\nand rubbish of an old house before the architect and builders begin on a\r\nnew and beautiful structure. The work may sometimes be necessary, but it\r\nrarely arouses our enthusiasm. While the satires of Pope, Swift, and\r\nAddison are doubtless the best in our language, we hardly place them with\r\nour great literature, which is always constructive in spirit; and we have\r\nthe feeling that all these men were capable of better things than they ever\r\nwrote.\r\n\r\nTHE CLASSIC AGE. The period we are studying is known to us by various\r\nnames. It is often called the Age of Queen Anne; but, unlike Elizabeth,\r\nthis \"meekly stupid\" queen had practically no influence upon our\r\nliterature. The name Classic Age is more often heard; but in using it we\r\nshould remember clearly these three different ways in which the word\r\n\"classic\" is applied to literature: (1) the term \"classic\" refers, in\r\ngeneral, to writers of the highest rank in any nation. As used in our\r\nliterature, it was first applied to the works of the great Greek and Roman\r\nwriters, like Homer and Virgil; and any English book which followed the\r\nsimple and noble method of these writers was said to have a classic style.\r\nLater the term was enlarged to cover the great literary works of other\r\nancient nations; so that the Bible and the Avestas, as well as the Iliad\r\nand the Aeneid, are called classics. (2) Every national literature has at\r\nleast one period in which an unusual number of great writers are producing\r\nbooks, and this is called the classic period of a nation's literature. Thus\r\nthe reign of Augustus is the classic or golden age of Rome; the generation\r\nof Dante is the classic age of Italian literature; the age of Louis XIV is\r\nthe French classic age; and the age of Queen Anne is often called the\r\nclassic age of England. (3) The word \"classic\" acquired an entirely\r\ndifferent meaning in the period we are studying; and we shall better\r\nunderstand this by reference to the preceding ages. The Elizabethan writers\r\nwere led by patriotism, by enthusiasm, and, in general, by romantic\r\nemotions. They wrote in a natural style, without regard to rules; and\r\nthough they exaggerated and used too many words, their works are delightful\r\nbecause of their vigor and freshness and fine feeling. In the following age\r\npatriotism had largely disappeared from politics and enthusiasm from\r\nliterature. Poets no longer wrote naturally, but artificially, with strange\r\nand fantastic verse forms to give effect, since fine feeling was wanting.\r\nAnd this is the general character of the poetry of the Puritan Age.[185]\r\nGradually our writers rebelled against the exaggerations of both the\r\nnatural and the fantastic style. They demanded that poetry should follow\r\nexact rules; and in this they were influenced by French writers, especially\r\nby Boileau and Rapin, who insisted on precise methods of writing poetry,\r\nand who professed to have discovered their rules in the classics of Horace\r\nand Aristotle. In our study of the Elizabethan drama we noted the good\r\ninfluence of the classic movement in insisting upon that beauty of form and\r\ndefiniteness of expression which characterize the dramas of Greece and\r\nRome; and in the work of Dryden and his followers we see a revival of\r\nclassicism in the effort to make English literature conform to rules\r\nestablished by the great writers of other nations. At first the results\r\nwere excellent, especially in prose; but as the creative vigor of the\r\nElizabethans was lacking in this age, writing by rule soon developed a kind\r\nof elegant formalism, which suggests the elaborate social code of the time.\r\nJust as a gentleman might not act naturally, but must follow exact rules in\r\ndoffing his hat, or addressing a lady, or entering a room, or wearing a\r\nwig, or offering his snuffbox to a friend, so our writers lost\r\nindividuality and became formal and artificial. The general tendency of\r\nliterature was to look at life critically, to emphasize intellect rather\r\nthan imagination, the form rather than the content of a sentence. Writers\r\nstrove to repress all emotion and enthusiasm, and to use only precise and\r\nelegant methods of expression. This is what is often meant by the\r\n\"classicism\" of the ages of Pope and Johnson. It refers to the critical,\r\nintellectual spirit of many writers, to the fine polish of their heroic\r\ncouplets or the elegance of their prose, and not to any resemblance which\r\ntheir work bears to true classic literature. In a word, the classic\r\nmovement had become pseudo-classic, i.e. a false or sham classicism; and\r\nthe latter term is now often used to designate a considerable part of\r\neighteenth-century literature.[186] To avoid this critical difficulty we\r\nhave adopted the term Augustan Age, a name chosen by the writers\r\nthemselves, who saw in Pope, Addison, Swift, Johnson, and Burke the modern\r\nparallels to Horace, Virgil, Cicero, and all that brilliant company who\r\nmade Roman literature famous in the days of Augustus.\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER POPE (1688-1744)\r\n\r\nPope is in many respects a unique figure. In the first place, he was for a\r\ngeneration \"the poet\" of a great nation. To be sure, poetry was limited in\r\nthe early eighteenth century; there were few lyrics, little or no love\r\npoetry, no epics, no dramas or songs of nature worth considering; but in\r\nthe narrow field of satiric and didactic verse Pope was the undisputed\r\nmaster. His influence completely dominated the poetry of his age, and many\r\nforeign writers, as well as the majority of English poets, looked to him as\r\ntheir model. Second, he was a remarkably clear and adequate reflection of\r\nthe spirit of the age in which he lived. There is hardly an ideal, a\r\nbelief, a doubt, a fashion, a whim of Queen Anne's time, that is not neatly\r\nexpressed in his poetry. Third, he was the only important writer of that\r\nage who gave his whole life to letters. Swift was a clergyman and\r\npolitician; Addison was secretary of state; other writers depended on\r\npatrons or politics or pensions for fame and a livelihood; but Pope was\r\nindependent, and had no profession but literature. And fourth, by the sheer\r\nforce of his ambition he won his place, and held it, in spite of religious\r\nprejudice, and in the face of physical and temperamental obstacles that\r\nwould have discouraged a stronger man. For Pope was deformed and sickly,\r\ndwarfish in soul and body. He knew little of the world of nature or of the\r\nworld of the human heart. He was lacking, apparently, in noble feeling, and\r\ninstinctively chose a lie when the truth had manifestly more advantages.\r\nYet this jealous, peevish, waspish little man became the most famous poet\r\nof his age and the acknowledged leader of English literature. We record the\r\nfact with wonder and admiration; but we do not attempt to explain it.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Pope was born in London in 1688, the year of the Revolution. His\r\nparents were both Catholics, who presently removed from London and settled\r\nin Binfield, near Windsor, where the poet's childhood was passed. Partly\r\nbecause of an unfortunate prejudice against Catholics in the public\r\nschools, partly because of his own weakness and deformity, Pope received\r\nvery little school education, but browsed for himself among English books\r\nand picked up a smattering of the classics. Very early he began to write\r\npoetry, and records the fact with his usual vanity:\r\n\r\n    As yet a child, nor yet a fool to fame,\r\n    I lisped in numbers, for the numbers came.\r\n\r\nBeing debarred by his religion from many desirable employments, he resolved\r\nto make literature his life work; and in this he resembled Dryden, who, he\r\ntells us, was his only master, though much of his work seems to depend on\r\nBoileau, the French poet and critic.[187] When only sixteen years old he\r\nhad written his \"Pastorals\"; a few years later appeared his \"Essay on\r\nCriticism,\" which made him famous. With the publication of the _Rape of the\r\nLock_, in 1712, Pope's name was known and honored all over England, and\r\nthis dwarf of twenty-four years, by the sheer force of his own ambition,\r\nhad jumped to the foremost place in English letters. It was soon after this\r\nthat Voltaire called him \"the best poet of England and, at present, of all\r\nthe world,\"--which is about as near the truth as Voltaire generally gets in\r\nhis numerous universal judgments. For the next twelve years Pope was busy\r\nwith poetry, especially with his translations of Homer; and his work was so\r\nsuccessful financially that he bought a villa at Twickenham, on the Thames,\r\nand remained happily independent of wealthy patrons for a livelihood.\r\n\r\nLed by his success, Pope returned to London and for a time endeavored to\r\nlive the gay and dissolute life which was supposed to be suitable for a\r\nliterary genius; but he was utterly unfitted for it, mentally and\r\nphysically, and soon retired to Twickenham. There he gave himself up to\r\npoetry, manufactured a little garden more artificial than his verses, and\r\ncultivated his friendship with Martha Blount, with whom for many years he\r\nspent a good part of each day, and who remained faithful to him to the end\r\nof his life. At Twickenham he wrote his _Moral Epistles_ (poetical satires\r\nmodeled after Horace) and revenged himself upon all his critics in the\r\nbitter abuse of the _Dunciad_. He died in 1744 and was buried at\r\nTwickenham, his religion preventing him from the honor, which was certainly\r\nhis due, of a resting place in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF POPE. For convenience we may separate Pope's work into three\r\ngroups, corresponding to the early, middle, and later period of his life.\r\nIn the first he wrote his \"Pastorals,\" \"Windsor Forest,\" \"Messiah,\" \"Essay\r\non Criticism,\" \"Eloise to Abelard,\" and the _Rape of the Lock;_ in the\r\nsecond, his translations of Homer; in the third the _Dunciad_ and the\r\n_Epistles_, the latter containing the famous \"Essay on Man\" and the\r\n\"Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot,\" which is in truth his \"Apologia,\" and in which\r\nalone we see Pope's life from his own view point.\r\n\r\nThe \"Essay on Criticism\" sums up the art of poetry as taught first by\r\nHorace, then by Boileau and the eighteenth-century classicists. Though\r\nwritten in heroic couplets, we hardly consider this as a poem but rather as\r\na storehouse of critical maxims. \"For fools rush in where angels fear to\r\ntread\"; \"To err is human, to forgive divine\"; \"A little learning is a\r\ndangerous thing,\"--these lines, and many more like them from the same\r\nsource, have found their way into our common speech, and are used, without\r\nthinking of the author, whenever we need an apt quotation.\r\n\r\nThe _Rape of the Lock_ is a masterpiece of its kind, and comes nearer to\r\nbeing a \"creation\" than anything else that Pope has written. The occasion\r\nof the famous poem was trivial enough. A fop at the court of Queen Anne,\r\none Lord Petre, snipped a lock of hair from the abundant curls of a pretty\r\nmaid of honor named Arabella Fermor. The young lady resented it, and the\r\ntwo families were plunged into a quarrel which was the talk of London.\r\nPope, being appealed to, seized the occasion to construct, not a ballad, as\r\nthe Cavaliers would have done, nor an epigram, as French poets love to do,\r\nbut a long poem in which all the mannerisms of society are pictured in\r\nminutest detail and satirized with the most delicate wit. The first\r\nedition, consisting of two cantos, was published in 1712; and it is amazing\r\nnow to read of the trivial character of London court life at the time when\r\nEnglish soldiers were battling for a great continent in the French and\r\nIndian wars. Its instant success caused Pope to lengthen the poem by three\r\nmore cantos; and in order to make a more perfect burlesque of an epic poem,\r\nhe introduces gnomes, sprites, sylphs, and salamanders,[188] instead of the\r\ngods of the great epics, with which his readers were familiar. The poem is\r\nmodeled after two foreign satires: Boileau's _Le Lutrin_ (reading desk), a\r\nsatire on the French clergy, who raised a huge quarrel over the location of\r\na lectern; and _La Secchia Rapita_ (stolen bucket), a famous Italian satire\r\non the petty causes of the endless Italian wars. Pope, however, went far\r\nahead of his masters in style and in delicacy of handling a mock-heroic\r\ntheme, and during his lifetime the _Rape of the Lock_ was considered as the\r\ngreatest poem of its kind in all literature. The poem is still well worth\r\nreading; for as an expression of the artificial life of the age--of its\r\ncards, parties, toilettes, lapdogs, tea-drinking, snuff-taking, and idle\r\nvanities--it is as perfect in its way as _Tamburlaine_, which reflects the\r\nboundless ambition of the Elizabethans.\r\n\r\nThe fame of Pope's _Iliad_, which was financially the most successful of\r\nhis books, was due to the fact that he interpreted Homer in the elegant,\r\nartificial language of his own age. Not only do his words follow literary\r\nfashions but even the Homeric characters lose their strength and become\r\nfashionable men of the court. So the criticism of the scholar Bentley was\r\nmost appropriate when he said, \"It is a pretty poem, Mr. Pope, but you must\r\nnot call it Homer.\" Pope translated the entire _Iliad_ and half of the\r\n_Odyssey_; and the latter work was finished by two Cambridge scholars,\r\nElijah Fenton and William Broome, who imitated the mechanical couplets so\r\nperfectly that it is difficult to distinguish their work from that of the\r\ngreatest poet of the age. A single selection is given to show how, in the\r\nnobler passages, even Pope may faintly suggest the elemental grandeur of\r\nHomer:\r\n\r\n    The troops exulting sat in order round,\r\n    And beaming fires illumined all the ground.\r\n    As when the moon, refulgent lamp of night,\r\n    O'er Heaven's clear azure spreads her sacred light,\r\n    When not a breath disturbs the deep serene,\r\n    And not a cloud o'ercasts the solemn scene;\r\n    Around her throne the vivid planets roll,\r\n    And stars unnumbered gild the glowing pole,\r\n    O'er the dark trees a yellower verdure shed,\r\n    And tip with silver every mountain's head.\r\n\r\nThe \"Essay\" is the best known and the most quoted of all Pope's works.\r\nExcept in form it is not poetry, and when one considers it as an essay and\r\nreduces it to plain prose, it is found to consist of numerous literary\r\nornaments without any very solid structure of thought to rest upon. The\r\npurpose of the essay is, in Pope's words, to \"vindicate the ways of God to\r\nMan\"; and as there are no unanswered problems in Pope's philosophy, the\r\nvindication is perfectly accomplished in four poetical epistles, concerning\r\nman's relations to the universe, to himself, to society, and to happiness.\r\nThe final result is summed up in a few well-known lines:\r\n\r\n    All nature is but art, unknown to thee;\r\n    All chance, direction which thou canst not see;\r\n    All discord, harmony not understood;\r\n    All partial evil, universal good:\r\n    And, spite of pride, in erring reason's spite,\r\n    One truth is clear, whatever is, is right.\r\n\r\nLike the \"Essay on Criticism,\" the poem abounds in quotable lines, such as\r\nthe following, which make the entire work well worth reading:\r\n\r\n    Hope springs eternal in the human breast:\r\n    Man never is, but always to be blest.\r\n    Know then thyself, presume not God to scan;\r\n    The proper study of Mankind is Man.\r\n    The same ambition can destroy or save,\r\n    And makes a patriot as it makes a knave.\r\n    Honor and shame from no condition rise;\r\n    Act well your part, there all the honor lies.\r\n      Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,\r\n    As, to be hated, needs but to be seen;\r\n    Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,\r\n    We first endure, then pity, then embrace.\r\n      Behold the child, by Nature's kindly law,\r\n    Pleased with a rattle, tickled with a straw:\r\n    Some livelier plaything gives his youth delight,\r\n    A little louder, but as empty quite:\r\n    Scarfs, garters, gold, amuse his riper stage,\r\n    And beads and prayer books are the toys of age:\r\n    Pleased with this bauble still, as that before;\r\n    Till tired he sleeps, and Life's poor play is o'er.[189]\r\n\r\n_The Dunciad_ (i.e. the \"Iliad of the Dunces\") began originally as a\r\ncontroversy concerning Shakespeare, but turned out to be a coarse and\r\nrevengeful satire upon all the literary men of the age who had aroused\r\nPope's anger by their criticism or lack of appreciation of his genius.\r\nThough brilliantly written and immensely popular at one time, its present\r\neffect on the reader is to arouse a sense of pity that a man of such\r\nacknowledged power and position should abuse both by devoting his talents\r\nto personal spite and petty quarrels. Among the rest of his numerous works\r\nthe reader will find Pope's estimate of himself best set forth in his\r\n\"Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot,\" and it will be well to close our study of this\r\nstrange mixture of vanity and greatness with \"The Universal Prayer,\" which\r\nshows at least that Pope had considered, and judged himself, and that all\r\nfurther judgment is consequently superfluous.\r\n\r\n\r\nJONATHAN SWIFT (1667-1745)\r\n\r\nIn each of Marlowe's tragedies we have the picture of a man dominated by a\r\nsingle passion, the lust of power for its own sake. In each we see that a\r\npowerful man without self-control is like a dangerous instrument in the\r\nhands of a child; and the tragedy ends in the destruction of the man by the\r\nungoverned power which he possesses. The life of Swift is just such a\r\nliving tragedy. He had the power of gaining wealth, like the hero of the\r\n_Jew of Malta_; yet he used it scornfully, and in sad irony left what\r\nremained to him of a large property to found a hospital for lunatics. By\r\nhard work he won enormous literary power, and used it to satirize our\r\ncommon humanity. He wrested political power from the hands of the Tories,\r\nand used it to insult the very men who had helped him, and who held his\r\nfate in their hands. By his dominant personality he exercised a curious\r\npower over women, and used it brutally to make them feel their inferiority.\r\nBeing loved supremely by two good women, he brought sorrow and death to\r\nboth, and endless misery to himself. So his power brought always tragedy in\r\nits wake. It is only when we remember his life of struggle and\r\ndisappointment and bitterness that we can appreciate the personal quality\r\nin his satire, and perhaps find some sympathy for this greatest genius of\r\nall the Augustan writers.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Swift was born in Dublin, of English parents, in 1667. His father\r\ndied before he was born; his mother was poor, and Swift, though proud as\r\nLucifer, was compelled to accept aid from relatives, who gave it\r\ngrudgingly. At the Kilkenny school, and especially at Dublin University, he\r\ndetested the curriculum, reading only what appealed to his own nature; but,\r\nsince a degree was necessary to his success, he was compelled to accept it\r\nas a favor from the examiners, whom he despised in his heart. After\r\ngraduation the only position open to him was with a distant relative, Sir\r\nWilliam Temple, who gave him the position of private secretary largely on\r\naccount of the unwelcome relationship.\r\n\r\nTemple was a statesman and an excellent diplomatist; but he thought himself\r\nto be a great writer as well, and he entered into a literary controversy\r\nconcerning the relative merits of the classics and modern literature.\r\nSwift's first notable work, _The Battle of the Books_, written at this time\r\nbut not published, is a keen satire upon both parties in the controversy.\r\nThe first touch of bitterness shows itself here; for Swift was in a galling\r\nposition for a man of his pride, knowing his intellectual superiority to\r\nthe man who employed him, and yet being looked upon as a servant and eating\r\nat the servants' table. Thus he spent ten of the best years of his life in\r\nthe pretty Moor Park, Surrey, growing more bitter each year and steadily\r\ncursing his fate. Nevertheless he read and studied widely, and, after his\r\nposition with Temple grew unbearable, quarreled with his patron, took\r\norders, and entered the Church of England. Some years later we find him\r\nsettled in the little church of Laracor, Ireland,--a country which he\r\ndisliked intensely, but whither he went because no other \"living\" was open\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, faithful to his church duties, Swift labored to better the\r\ncondition of the unhappy people around him. Never before had the poor of\r\nhis parishes been so well cared for; but Swift chafed under his yoke,\r\ngrowing more and more irritated as he saw small men advanced to large\r\npositions, while he remained unnoticed in a little country church,--largely\r\nbecause he was too proud and too blunt with those who might have advanced\r\nhim. While at Laracor he finished his _Tale of a Tub_, a satire on the\r\nvarious churches of the day, which was published in London with the _Battle\r\nof the Books_ in 1704. The work brought him into notice as the most\r\npowerful satirist of the age, and he soon gave up his church to enter the\r\nstrife of party politics. The cheap pamphlet was then the most powerful\r\npolitical weapon known; and as Swift had no equal at pamphlet writing, he\r\nsoon became a veritable dictator. For several years, especially from 1710\r\nto 1713, Swift was one of the most important figures in London. The Whigs\r\nfeared the lash of his satire; the Tories feared to lose his support. He\r\nwas courted, flattered, cajoled on every side; but the use he made of his\r\nnew power is sad to contemplate. An unbearable arrogance took possession of\r\nhim. Lords, statesmen, even ladies were compelled to sue for his favor and\r\nto apologize for every fancied slight to his egoism. It is at this time\r\nthat he writes in his _Journal to Stella:_\r\n\r\nMr. Secretary told me the Duke of Buckingham had been talking much about me\r\nand desired my acquaintance. I answered it could not be, for he had not yet\r\nmade sufficient advances; then Shrewsbury said he thought the Duke was not\r\nused to make advances. I said I could not help that, for I always expected\r\nadvances in proportion to men's quality, and more from a Duke than any\r\nother man.\r\n\r\nWriting to the Duchess of Queensberry he says:\r\n\r\nI am glad you know your duty; for it has been a known and established rule\r\nabove twenty years in England that the first advances have been constantly\r\nmade me by all ladies who aspire to my acquaintance, and the greater their\r\nquality the greater were their advances.\r\n\r\nWhen the Tories went out of power Swift's position became uncertain. He\r\nexpected and had probably been promised a bishopric in England, with a seat\r\namong the peers of the realm; but the Tories offered him instead the place\r\nof dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin. It was galling to a man of\r\nhis proud spirit; but after his merciless satire on religion, in _The Tale\r\nof a Tub_, any ecclesiastical position in England was rendered impossible.\r\nDublin was the best he could get, and he accepted it bitterly, once more\r\ncursing the fate which he had brought upon himself.\r\n\r\nWith his return to Ireland begins the last act in the tragedy of his life.\r\nHis best known literary work, _Gulliver's Travels_, was done here; but the\r\nbitterness of life grew slowly to insanity, and a frightful personal\r\nsorrow, of which he never spoke, reached its climax in the death of Esther\r\nJohnson, a beautiful young woman, who had loved Swift ever since the two\r\nhad met in Temple's household, and to whom he had written his _Journal to\r\nStella_. During the last years of his life a brain disease, of which he had\r\nshown frequent symptoms, fastened its terrible hold upon Swift, and he\r\nbecame by turns an idiot and a madman. He died in 1745, and when his will\r\nwas opened it was found that he had left all his property to found St.\r\nPatrick's Asylum for lunatics and incurables. It stands to-day as the most\r\nsuggestive monument of his peculiar genius.\r\n\r\nTHE WORKS OF SWIFT. From Swift's life one can readily foresee the kind of\r\nliterature he will produce. Taken together his works are a monstrous satire\r\non humanity; and the spirit of that satire is shown clearly in a little\r\nincident of his first days in London. There was in the city at that time a\r\ncertain astrologer named Partridge, who duped the public by calculating\r\nnativities from the stars, and by selling a yearly almanac predicting\r\nfuture events. Swift, who hated all shams, wrote, with a great show of\r\nlearning, his famous _Bickerstaff Almanac_, containing \"Predictions for the\r\nYear 1708, as Determined by the Unerring Stars.\" As Swift rarely signed his\r\nname to any literary work, letting it stand or fall on its own merits, his\r\nburlesque appeared over the pseudonym of Isaac Bickerstaff, a name\r\nafterwards made famous by Steele in _The Tatler_. Among the predictions was\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\nMy first prediction is but a trifle; yet I will mention it to show how\r\nignorant those sottish pretenders to astrology are in their own concerns:\r\nit relates to Partridge the almanack maker; I have consulted the star of\r\nhis nativity by my own rules, and find he will infallibly die upon the 29th\r\nof March next, about eleven at night, of a raging fever; therefore I advise\r\nhim to consider of it, and settle his affairs in time.\r\n\r\nOn March 30, the day after the prediction was to be fulfilled, there\r\nappeared in the newspapers a letter from a revenue officer giving the\r\ndetails of Partridge's death, with the doings of the bailiff and the coffin\r\nmaker; and on the following morning appeared an elaborate \"Elegy of Mr.\r\nPartridge.\" When poor Partridge, who suddenly found himself without\r\ncustomers, published a denial of the burial, Swift answered with an\r\nelaborate \"Vindication of Isaac Bickerstaff,\" in which he proved by\r\nastrological rules that Partridge was dead, and that the man now in his\r\nplace was an impostor trying to cheat the heirs out of their inheritance.\r\n\r\nThis ferocious joke is suggestive of all Swift's satires. Against any case\r\nof hypocrisy or injustice he sets up a remedy of precisely the same kind,\r\nonly more atrocious, and defends his plan with such seriousness that the\r\nsatire overwhelms the reader with a sense of monstrous falsity. Thus his\r\nsolemn \"Argument to prove that the Abolishing of Christianity may be\r\nattended with Some Inconveniences\" is such a frightful satire upon the\r\nabuses of Christianity by its professed followers that it is impossible for\r\nus to say whether Swift intended to point out needed reforms, or to satisfy\r\nhis conscience,[190] or to perpetrate a joke on the Church, as he had done\r\non poor Partridge. So also with his \"Modest Proposal,\" concerning the\r\nchildren of Ireland, which sets up the proposition that poor Irish farmers\r\nought to raise children as dainties, to be eaten, like roast pigs, on the\r\ntables of prosperous Englishmen. In this most characteristic work it is\r\nimpossible to find Swift or his motive. The injustice under which Ireland\r\nsuffered, her perversity in raising large families to certain poverty, and\r\nthe indifference of English politicians to her suffering and protests are\r\nall mercilessly portrayed; but why? That is still the unanswered problem of\r\nSwift's life and writings.\r\n\r\nSwift's two greatest satires are his _Tale of a Tub_ and _Gulliver's\r\nTravels_. The _Tale_ began as a grim exposure of the alleged weaknesses of\r\nthree principal forms of religious belief, Catholic, Lutheran, and\r\nCalvinist, as opposed to the Anglican; but it ended in a satire upon all\r\nscience and philosophy.\r\n\r\nSwift explains his whimsical title by the custom of mariners in throwing\r\nout a tub to a whale, in order to occupy the monster's attention and divert\r\nit from an attack upon the ship,--which only proves how little Swift knew\r\nof whales or sailors. But let that pass. His book is a tub thrown out to\r\nthe enemies of Church and State to keep them occupied from further attacks\r\nor criticism; and the substance of the argument is that all churches, and\r\nindeed all religion and science and statesmanship, are arrant hypocrisy.\r\nThe best known part of the book is the allegory of the old man who died and\r\nleft a coat (which is Christian Truth) to each of his three sons, Peter,\r\nMartin, and Jack, with minute directions for its care and use. These three\r\nnames stand for Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists; and the way in which\r\nthe sons evade their father's will and change the fashion of their garment\r\nis part of the bitter satire upon all religious sects. Though it professes\r\nto defend the Anglican Church, that institution fares perhaps worse than\r\nthe others; for nothing is left to her but a thin cloak of custom under\r\nwhich to hide her alleged hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nIn _Gulliver's Travels_ the satire grows more unbearable. Strangely enough,\r\nthis book, upon which Swift's literary fame generally rests, was not\r\nwritten from any literary motive, but rather as an outlet for the author's\r\nown bitterness against fate and human society. It is still read with\r\npleasure, as _Robinson Crusoe_ is read, for the interesting adventures of\r\nthe hero; and fortunately those who read it generally overlook its\r\ndegrading influence and motive.\r\n\r\n_Gulliver's Travels_ records the pretended four voyages of one Lemuel\r\nGulliver, and his adventures in four astounding countries. The first book\r\ntells of his voyage and shipwreck in Lilliput, where the inhabitants are\r\nabout as tall as one's thumb, and all their acts and motives are on the\r\nsame dwarfish scale. In the petty quarrels of these dwarfs we are supposed\r\nto see the littleness of humanity. The statesmen who obtain place and favor\r\nby cutting monkey capers on the tight rope before their sovereign, and the\r\ntwo great parties, the Littleendians and Bigendians, who plunge the country\r\ninto civil war over the momentous question of whether an egg should be\r\nbroken on its big or on its little end, are satires on the politics of\r\nSwift's own day and generation. The style is simple and convincing; the\r\nsurprising situations and adventures are as absorbing as those of Defoe's\r\nmasterpiece; and altogether it is the most interesting of Swift's satires.\r\n\r\nOn the second voyage Gulliver is abandoned in Brobdingnag, where the\r\ninhabitants are giants, and everything is done upon an enormous scale. The\r\nmeanness of humanity seems all the more detestable in view of the greatness\r\nof these superior beings. When Gulliver tells about his own people, their\r\nambitions and wars and conquests, the giants can only wonder that such\r\ngreat venom could exist in such little insects.\r\n\r\nIn the third voyage Gulliver continues his adventures in Laputa, and this\r\nis a satire upon all the scientists and philosophers. Laputa is a flying\r\nisland, held up in the air by a loadstone; and all the professors of the\r\nfamous academy at Lagado are of the same airy constitution. The philosopher\r\nwho worked eight years to extract sunshine from cucumbers is typical of\r\nSwift's satiric treatment of all scientific problems. It is in this voyage\r\nthat we hear of the Struldbrugs, a ghastly race of men who are doomed to\r\nlive upon earth after losing hope and the desire for life. The picture is\r\nall the more terrible in view of the last years of Swift's own life, in\r\nwhich he was compelled to live on, a burden to himself and his friends.\r\n\r\nIn these three voyages the evident purpose is to strip off the veil of\r\nhabit and custom, with which men deceive themselves, and show the crude\r\nvices of humanity as Swift fancies he sees them. In the fourth voyage the\r\nmerciless satire is carried out to its logical conclusion. This brings us\r\nto the land of the Houyhnhnms, in which horses, superior and intelligent\r\ncreatures, are the ruling animals. All our interest, however, is centered\r\non the Yahoos, a frightful race, having the form and appearance of men, but\r\nliving in unspeakable degradation.\r\n\r\nThe _Journal to Stella_, written chiefly in the years 1710-1713 for the\r\nbenefit of Esther Johnson, is interesting to us for two reasons. It is,\r\nfirst, an excellent commentary on contemporary characters and political\r\nevents, by one of the most powerful and original minds of the age; and\r\nsecond, in its love passages and purely personal descriptions it gives us\r\nthe best picture we possess of Swift himself at the summit of his power and\r\ninfluence. As we read now its words of tenderness for the woman who loved\r\nhim, and who brought almost the only ray of sunlight into his life, we can\r\nonly wonder and be silent. Entirely different are his _Drapier's Letters_,\r\na model of political harangue and of popular argument, which roused an\r\nunthinking English public and did much benefit to Ireland by preventing the\r\npoliticians' plan of debasing the Irish coinage. Swift's poems, though\r\nvigorous and original (like Defoe's, of the same period), are generally\r\nsatirical, often coarse, and seldom rise above doggerel. Unlike his friend\r\nAddison, Swift saw, in the growing polish and decency of society, only a\r\nmask for hypocrisy; and he often used his verse to shock the new-born\r\nmodesty by pointing out some native ugliness which his diseased mind\r\ndiscovered under every beautiful exterior.\r\n\r\nThat Swift is the most original writer of his time, and one of the greatest\r\nmasters of English prose, is undeniable. Directness, vigor, simplicity,\r\nmark every page. Among writers of that age he stands almost alone in his\r\ndisdain of literary effects. Keeping his object steadily before him, he\r\ndrives straight on to the end, with a convincing power that has never been\r\nsurpassed in our language. Even in his most grotesque creations, the reader\r\nnever loses the sense of reality, of being present as an eyewitness of the\r\nmost impossible events, so powerful and convincing is Swift's prose. Defoe\r\nhad the same power; but in writing _Robinson Crusoe_, for instance, his\r\ntask was comparatively easy, since his hero and his adventures were both\r\nnatural; while Swift gives reality to pygmies, giants, and the most\r\nimpossible situations, as easily as if he were writing of facts.\r\nNotwithstanding these excellent qualities, the ordinary reader will do well\r\nto confine himself to _Gulliver's Travels_ and a book of well-chosen\r\nselections. For, it must be confessed, the bulk of Swift's work is not\r\nwholesome reading. It is too terribly satiric and destructive; it\r\nemphasizes the faults and failings of humanity; and so runs counter to the\r\ngeneral course of our literature, which from Cynewulf to Tennyson follows\r\nthe Ideal, as Merlin followed the Gleam,[191] and is not satisfied till the\r\nhidden beauty of man's soul and the divine purpose of his struggle are\r\nmanifest.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH ADDISON (1672-1719)\r\n\r\nIn the pleasant art of living with one's fellows, Addison is easily a\r\nmaster. It is due to his perfect expression of that art, of that new social\r\nlife which, as we have noted, was characteristic of the Age of Anne, that\r\nAddison occupies such a large place in the history of literature. Of less\r\npower and originality than Swift, he nevertheless wields, and deserves to\r\nwield, a more lasting influence. Swift is the storm, roaring against the\r\nice and frost of the late spring of English life. Addison is the sunshine,\r\nwhich melts the ice and dries the mud and makes the earth thrill with light\r\nand hope. Like Swift, he despised shams, but unlike him, he never lost\r\nfaith in humanity; and in all his satires there is a gentle kindliness\r\nwhich makes one think better of his fellow-men, even while he laughs at\r\ntheir little vanities.\r\n\r\nTwo things Addison did for our literature which are of inestimable value.\r\nFirst, he overcame a certain corrupt tendency bequeathed by Restoration\r\nliterature. It was the apparent aim of the low drama, and even of much of\r\nthe poetry of that age, to make virtue ridiculous and vice attractive.\r\nAddison set himself squarely against this unworthy tendency. To strip off\r\nthe mask of vice, to show its ugliness and deformity, but to reveal virtue\r\nin its own native loveliness,--that was Addison's purpose; and he succeeded\r\nso well that never, since his day, has our English literature seriously\r\nfollowed after false gods. As Macaulay says, \"So effectually did he retort\r\non vice the mockery which had recently been directed against virtue, that\r\nsince his time the open violation of decency has always been considered\r\namongst us a sure mark of a fool.\" And second, prompted and aided by the\r\nmore original genius of his friend Steele, Addison seized upon the new\r\nsocial life of the clubs and made it the subject of endless pleasant essays\r\nupon types of men and manners. _The Tatler_ and _The Spectator_ are the\r\nbeginning of the modern essay; and their studies of human character, as\r\nexemplified in Sir Roger de Coverley, are a preparation for the modern\r\nnovel.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Addison's life, like his writings, is in marked contrast to that of\r\nSwift. He was born in Milston, Wiltshire, in 1672. His father was a\r\nscholarly English clergyman, and all his life Addison followed naturally\r\nthe quiet and cultured ways to which he was early accustomed. At the famous\r\nCharterhouse School, in London, and in his university life at Oxford, he\r\nexcelled in character and scholarship and became known as a writer of\r\ngraceful verses. He had some intention, at one time, of entering the\r\nChurch, but was easily persuaded by his friends to take up the government\r\nservice instead. Unlike Swift, who abused his political superiors, Addison\r\ntook the more tactful way of winning the friendship of men in large places.\r\nHis lines to Dryden won that literary leader's instant favor, and one of\r\nhis Latin poems, \"The Peace of Ryswick\" (1697), with its kindly\r\nappreciation of King William's statesmen, brought him into favorable\r\npolitical notice. It brought him also a pension of three hundred pounds a\r\nyear, with a suggestion that he travel abroad and cultivate the art of\r\ndiplomacy; which he promptly did to his own great advantage.\r\n\r\nFrom a literary view point the most interesting work of Addison's early\r\nlife is his _Account of the Greatest English Poets_ (1693), written while\r\nhe was a fellow of Oxford University. One rubs his eyes to find Dryden\r\nlavishly praised, Spenser excused or patronized, while Shakespeare is not\r\neven mentioned. But Addison was writing under Boileau's \"classic\" rules;\r\nand the poet, like the age, was perhaps too artificial to appreciate\r\nnatural genius.\r\n\r\nWhile he was traveling abroad, the death of William and the loss of power\r\nby the Whigs suddenly stopped Addison's pension; necessity brought him\r\nhome, and for a time he lived in poverty and obscurity. Then occurred the\r\nbattle of Blenheim, and in the effort to find a poet to celebrate the\r\nevent, Addison was brought to the Tories' attention. His poem, \"The\r\nCampaign,\" celebrating the victory, took the country by storm. Instead of\r\nmaking the hero slay his thousands and ten thousands, like the old epic\r\nheroes, Addison had some sense of what is required in a modern general, and\r\nso made Marlborough direct the battle from the outside, comparing him to an\r\nangel riding on the whirlwind:\r\n\r\n    'T was then great Marlbro's mighty soul was proved,\r\n    That, in the shock of charging hosts unmoved,\r\n    Amidst confusion, horror, and despair,\r\n    Examined all the dreadful scenes of war;\r\n    In peaceful thought the field of death surveyed,\r\n    To fainting squadrons sent the timely aid,\r\n    Inspired repulsed battalions to engage,\r\n    And taught the doubtful battle where to rage.\r\n    So when an angel by divine command\r\n    With rising tempests shakes a guilty land,\r\n    (Such as of late o'er pale Britannia past,)\r\n    Calm and serene he drives the furious blast;\r\n    And, pleased th' Almighty's orders to perform,\r\n    Rides in the whirlwind, and directs the storm.\r\n\r\nThat one doubtful simile made Addison's fortune. Never before or since was\r\na poet's mechanical work so well rewarded. It was called the finest thing\r\never written, and from that day Addison rose steadily in political favor\r\nand office. He became in turn Undersecretary, member of Parliament,\r\nSecretary for Ireland, and finally Secretary of State. Probably no other\r\nliterary man, aided by his pen alone, ever rose so rapidly and so high in\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe rest of Addison's life was divided between political duties and\r\nliterature. His essays for the _Tatler_ and _Spectator_, which we still\r\ncherish, were written between 1709 and 1714; but he won more literary fame\r\nby his classic tragedy _Cato_, which we have almost forgotten. In 1716 he\r\nmarried a widow, the Countess of Warwick, and went to live at her home, the\r\nfamous Holland House. His married life lasted only three years, and was\r\nprobably not a happy one. Certainly he never wrote of women except with\r\ngentle satire, and he became more and more a clubman, spending most of his\r\ntime in the clubs and coffeehouses of London. Up to this time his life had\r\nbeen singularly peaceful; but his last years were shadowed by quarrels,\r\nfirst with Pope, then with Swift, and finally with his lifelong friend\r\nSteele. The first quarrel was on literary grounds, and was largely the\r\nresult of Pope's jealousy. The latter's venomous caricature of Addison as\r\nAtticus shows how he took his petty revenge on a great and good man who had\r\nbeen his friend. The other quarrels with Swift, and especially with his old\r\nfriend Steele, were the unfortunate result of political differences, and\r\nshow how impossible it is to mingle literary ideals with party politics. He\r\ndied serenely in 1719. A brief description from Thackeray's _English\r\nHumorists_ is his best epitaph:\r\n\r\nA life prosperous and beautiful, a calm death; an immense fame and\r\naffection afterwards for his happy and spotless name.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF ADDISON. The most enduring of Addison's works are his famous\r\n_Essays_, collected from the _Tatler_ and _Spectator._ We have spoken of\r\nhim as a master of the art of gentle living, and these essays are a\r\nperpetual inducement to others to know and to practice the same fine art.\r\nTo an age of fundamental coarseness and artificiality he came with a\r\nwholesome message of refinement and simplicity, much as Ruskin and Arnold\r\nspoke to a later age of materialism; only Addison's success was greater\r\nthan theirs because of his greater knowledge of life and his greater faith\r\nin men. He attacks all the little vanities and all the big vices of his\r\ntime, not in Swift's terrible way, which makes us feel hopeless of\r\nhumanity, but with a kindly ridicule and gentle humor which takes speedy\r\nimprovement for granted. To read Swift's brutal \"Letters to a Young Lady,\"\r\nand then to read Addison's \"Dissection of a Beau's Head\" and his\r\n\"Dissection of a Coquette's Heart,\" is to know at once the secret of the\r\nlatter's more enduring influence.\r\n\r\nThree other results of these delightful essays are worthy of attention:\r\nfirst, they are the best picture we possess of the new social life of\r\nEngland, with its many new interests; second, they advanced the art of\r\nliterary criticism to a much higher stage than it had ever before reached,\r\nand however much we differ from their judgment and their interpretation of\r\nsuch a man as Milton, they certainly led Englishmen to a better knowledge\r\nand appreciation of their own literature; and finally, in Ned Softly the\r\nliterary dabbler, Will Wimble the poor relation, Sir Andrew Freeport the\r\nmerchant, Will Honeycomb the fop, and Sir Roger the country gentleman, they\r\ngive us characters that live forever as part of that goodly company which\r\nextends from Chaucer's country parson to Kipling's Mulvaney. Addison and\r\nSteele not only introduced the modern essay, but in such characters as\r\nthese they herald the dawn of the modern novel. Of all his essays the best\r\nknown and loved are those which introduce us to Sir Roger de Coverley, the\r\ngenial dictator of life and manners in the quiet English country.\r\n\r\nIn style these essays are remarkable as showing the growing perfection of\r\nthe English language. Johnson says, \"Whoever wishes to attain an English\r\nstyle, familiar but not coarse, and elegant but not ostentatious, must give\r\nhis days and nights to the volumes of Addison.\" And again he says, \"Give\r\nnights and days, sir, to the study of Addison if you mean to be a good\r\nwriter, or, what is more worth, an honest man.\" That was good criticism for\r\nits day, and even at the present time critics are agreed that Addison's\r\n_Essays_ are well worth reading once for their own sake, and many times for\r\ntheir influence in shaping a clear and graceful style of writing.\r\n\r\nAddison's poems, which were enormously popular in his day, are now seldom\r\nread. His _Cato_, with its classic unities and lack of dramatic power, must\r\nbe regarded as a failure, if we study it as tragedy; but it offers an\r\nexcellent example of the rhetoric and fine sentiment which were then\r\nconsidered the essentials of good writing. The best scene from this tragedy\r\nis in the fifth act, where Cato soliloquizes, with Plato's _Immortality of\r\nthe Soul_ open in his hand, and a drawn sword on the table before him:\r\n\r\n    It must be so--Plato, thou reason'st well!--\r\n    Else whence this pleasing hope, this fond desire,\r\n    This longing after immortality?\r\n    Or whence this secret dread, and inward horror,\r\n    Of falling into nought? why shrinks the soul\r\n    Back on herself, and startles at destruction?\r\n    'Tis the divinity that stirs within us;\r\n    'Tis heaven itself, that points out an hereafter,\r\n    And intimates eternity to man.\r\n\r\nMany readers make frequent use of one portion of Addison's poetry without\r\nknowing to whom they are indebted. His devout nature found expression in\r\nmany hymns, a few of which are still used and loved in our churches. Many a\r\ncongregation thrills, as Thackeray did, to the splendid sweep of his \"God\r\nin Nature,\" beginning, \"The spacious firmament on high.\" Almost as well\r\nknown and loved are his \"Traveler's Hymn,\" and his \"Continued Help,\"\r\nbeginning, \"When all thy mercies, O my God.\" The latter hymn--written in a\r\nstorm at sea off the Italian coast, when the captain and crew were\r\ndemoralized by terror--shows that poetry, especially a good hymn that one\r\ncan sing in the same spirit as one would say his prayers, is sometimes the\r\nmost practical and helpful thing in the world.\r\n\r\nRICHARD STEELE (1672-1729). Steele was in almost every respect the\r\nantithesis of his friend and fellow-worker,--a rollicking, good-hearted,\r\nemotional, lovable Irishman. At the Charterhouse School and at Oxford he\r\nshared everything with Addison, asking nothing but love in return. Unlike\r\nAddison, he studied but little, and left the university to enter the Horse\r\nGuards. He was in turn soldier, captain, poet, playwright, essayist, member\r\nof Parliament, manager of a theater, publisher of a newspaper, and twenty\r\nother things,--all of which he began joyously and then abandoned, sometimes\r\nagainst his will, as when he was expelled from Parliament, and again\r\nbecause some other interest of the moment had more attraction. His poems\r\nand plays are now little known; but the reader who searches them out will\r\nfind one or two suggestive things about Steele himself. For instance, he\r\nloves children; and he is one of the few writers of his time who show a\r\nsincere and unswerving respect for womanhood. Even more than Addison he\r\nridicules vice and makes virtue lovely. He is the originator of the\r\n_Tatler_, and joins with Addison in creating the _Spectator_,--the two\r\nperiodicals which, in the short space of less than four years, did more to\r\ninfluence subsequent literature than all other magazines of the century\r\ncombined. Moreover, he is the original genius of Sir Roger, and of many\r\nother characters and essays for which Addison usually receives the whole\r\ncredit. It is often impossible in the _Tatler_ essays to separate the work\r\nof the two men; but the majority of critics hold that the more original\r\nparts, the characters, the thought, the overflowing kindliness, are largely\r\nSteele's creation; while to Addison fell the work of polishing and\r\nperfecting the essays, and of adding that touch of humor which made them\r\nthe most welcome literary visitors that England had ever received.\r\n\r\nTHE TATLER AND THE SPECTATOR. On account of his talent in writing political\r\npamphlets, Steele was awarded the position of official gazetteer. While in\r\nthis position, and writing for several small newspapers, the idea occurred\r\nto Steele to publish a paper which should contain not only the political\r\nnews, but also the gossip of the clubs and coffeehouses, with some light\r\nessays on the life and manners of the age. The immediate result--for Steele\r\nnever let an idea remain idle--was the famous _Tatler_, the first number of\r\nwhich appeared April 12, 1709. It was a small folio sheet, appearing on\r\npost days, three times a week, and it sold for a penny a copy. That it had\r\na serious purpose is evident from this dedication to the first volume of\r\ncollected _Tatler_ essays:\r\n\r\nThe general purpose of this paper is to expose the false arts of life, to\r\npull off the disguises of cunning, vanity, and affectation, and to\r\nrecommend a general simplicity in our dress, our discourse, and our\r\nbehavior.\r\n\r\nThe success of this unheard-of combination of news, gossip, and essay was\r\ninstantaneous. Not a club or a coffeehouse in London could afford to be\r\nwithout it, and over it's pages began the first general interest in\r\ncontemporary English life as expressed in literature. Steele at first wrote\r\nthe entire paper and signed his essays with the name of Isaac Bickerstaff,\r\nwhich had been made famous by Swift a few years before. Addison is said to\r\nhave soon recognized one of his own remarks to Steele, and the secret of\r\nthe Authorship was out. From that time Addison was a regular contributor,\r\nand occasionally other writers added essays on the new social life of\r\nEngland.[192]\r\n\r\nSteele lost his position as gazetteer, and the _Tatler_ was discontinued\r\nafter less than two years' life, but not till it won an astonishing\r\npopularity and made ready the way for its successor. Two months later, on\r\nMarch 1, 1711, appeared the first number of the _Spectator_. In the new\r\nmagazine politics and news, as such, were ignored; it was a literary\r\nmagazine, pure and simple, and its entire contents consisted of a single\r\nlight essay. It was considered a crazy venture at the time, but its instant\r\nsuccess proved that men were eager for some literary expression of the new\r\nsocial ideals. The following whimsical letter to the editor may serve to\r\nindicate the part played by the _Spectator_ in the daily life of London:\r\n\r\nMr. Spectator,--Your paper is a part of my tea equipage; and my servant\r\nknows my humor so well, that in calling for my breakfast this morning (it\r\nbeing past my usual hour) she answered, the _Spectator_ was not yet come\r\nin, but the teakettle boiled, and she expected it every moment.\r\n\r\nIt is in the incomparable _Spectator_ papers that Addison shows himself\r\nmost \"worthy to be remembered.\" He contributed the majority of its essays,\r\nand in its first number appears this description of the Spectator, by which\r\nname Addison is now generally known:\r\n\r\nThere is no place of general resort wherein I do not often make my\r\nappearance; sometimes I am seen thrusting my head into a round of\r\npoliticians at Will's [Coffeehouse] and listening with great attention to\r\nthe narratives that are made in those little circular audiences. Sometimes\r\nI smoke a pipe at Child's, and, whilst I seem attentive to nothing but _The\r\nPostman_, overhear the conversation of every table in the room. I appear on\r\nSunday nights at St. James's, and sometimes join the little committee of\r\npolitics in the inner room, as one who comes to hear and improve. My face\r\nis likewise very well known at the Grecian, the Cocoa Tree, and in the\r\ntheaters both of Drury Lane and the Haymarket. I have been taken for a\r\nmerchant upon the Exchange for above these ten years; and sometimes pass\r\nfor a Jew in the assembly of stock jobbers at Jonathan's.... Thus I live in\r\nthe world rather as a spectator of mankind than as one of the species,...\r\nwhich is the character I intend to preserve in this paper.\r\n\r\nThe large place which these two little magazines hold in our literature\r\nseems most disproportionate to their short span of days. In the short space\r\nof four years in which Addison and Steele worked together the light essay\r\nwas established as one of the most important forms of modern literature,\r\nand the literary magazine won its place as the expression of the social\r\nlife of a nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL JOHNSON (1709-1784)\r\n\r\nThe reader of Boswell's _Johnson_, after listening to endless grumblings\r\nand watching the clumsy actions of the hero, often finds himself wondering\r\nwhy he should end his reading with a profound respect for this \"old bear\"\r\nwho is the object of Boswell's groveling attention. Here is a man who was\r\ncertainly not the greatest writer of his age, perhaps not even a great\r\nwriter at all, but who was nevertheless the dictator of English letters,\r\nand who still looms across the centuries of a magnificent literature as its\r\nmost striking and original figure. Here, moreover, is a huge, fat, awkward\r\nman, of vulgar manners and appearance, who monopolizes conversation, argues\r\nviolently, abuses everybody, clubs down opposition,--\"Madam\" (speaking to\r\nhis cultivated hostess at table), \"talk no more nonsense\"; \"Sir\" (turning\r\nto a distinguished guest), \"I perceive you are a vile Whig.\" While talking\r\nhe makes curious animal sounds, \"sometimes giving a half whistle, sometimes\r\nclucking like a hen\"; and when he has concluded a violent dispute and laid\r\nhis opponents low by dogmatism or ridicule, he leans back to \"blow out his\r\nbreath like a whale\" and gulp down numberless cups of hot tea. Yet this\r\ncurious dictator of an elegant age was a veritable lion, much sought after\r\nby society; and around him in his own poor house gathered the foremost\r\nartists, scholars, actors, and literary men of London,--all honoring the\r\nman, loving him, and listening to his dogmatism as the Greeks listened to\r\nthe voice of their oracle.\r\n\r\nWhat is the secret of this astounding spectacle? If the reader turns\r\nnaturally to Johnson's works for an explanation, he will be disappointed.\r\nReading his verses, we find nothing to delight or inspire us, but rather\r\ngloom and pessimism, with a few moral observations in rimed couplets:\r\n\r\n    But, scarce observed, the knowing and the bold\r\n    Fall in the general massacre of gold;\r\n    Wide-wasting pest! that rages unconfined,\r\n    And crowds with crimes the records of mankind;\r\n    For gold his sword the hireling ruffian draws,\r\n    For gold the hireling judge distorts the laws;\r\n    Wealth heaped on wealth nor truth nor safety buys;\r\n    The dangers gather as the treasures rise.[193]\r\n\r\nThat is excellent common sense, but it is not poetry; and it is not\r\nnecessary to hunt through Johnson's bulky volumes for the information,\r\nsince any moralist can give us offhand the same doctrine. As for his\r\n_Rambler_ essays, once so successful, though we marvel at the big words,\r\nthe carefully balanced sentences, the classical allusions, one might as\r\nwell try to get interested in an old-fashioned, three-hour sermon. We read\r\na few pages listlessly, yawn, and go to bed.\r\n\r\nSince the man's work fails to account for his leadership and influence, we\r\nexamine his personality; and here everything is interesting. Because of a\r\nfew oft-quoted passages from Boswell's biography, Johnson appears to us as\r\nan eccentric bear, who amuses us by his growlings and clumsy antics. But\r\nthere is another Johnson, a brave, patient, kindly, religious soul, who, as\r\nGoldsmith said, had \"nothing of the bear but his skin\"; a man who battled\r\nlike a hero against poverty and pain and melancholy and the awful fear of\r\ndeath, and who overcame them manfully. \"_That trouble passed away; so will\r\nthis,_\" sang the sorrowing Deor in the first old Anglo-Saxon lyric; and\r\nthat expresses the great and suffering spirit of Johnson, who in the face\r\nof enormous obstacles never lost faith in God or in himself. Though he was\r\na reactionary in politics, upholding the arbitrary power of kings and\r\nopposing the growing liberty of the people, yet his political theories,\r\nlike his manners, were no deeper than his skin; for in all London there was\r\nnone more kind to the wretched, and none more ready to extend an open hand\r\nto every struggling man and woman who crossed his path. When he passed poor\r\nhomeless Arabs sleeping in the streets he would slip a coin into their\r\nhands, in order that they might have a happy awakening; for he himself knew\r\nwell what it meant to be hungry. Such was Johnson,--a \"mass of genuine\r\nmanhood,\" as Carlyle called him, and as such, men loved and honored\r\nhim.[194]\r\n\r\nLife of Johnson. Johnson was born in Lichfield, Staffordshire, in 1709. He\r\nwas the son of a small bookseller, a poor man, but intelligent and fond of\r\nliterature, as booksellers invariably were in the good days when every town\r\nhad its bookshop. From his childhood Johnson had to struggle against\r\nphysical deformity and disease and the consequent disinclination to hard\r\nwork. He prepared for the university, partly in the schools, but largely by\r\nomnivorous reading in his father's shop, and when he entered Oxford he had\r\nread more classical authors than had most of the graduates. Before\r\nfinishing his course he had to leave the university on account of his\r\npoverty, and at once he began his long struggle as a hack writer to earn\r\nhis living.\r\n\r\nAt twenty-five years he married a woman old enough to be his mother,--a\r\ngenuine love match, he called it,--and with her dowry of £800 they started\r\na private school together, which was a dismal failure. Then, without money\r\nor influential friends, he left his home and wife in Lichfield and tramped\r\nto London, accompanied only by David Garrick, afterwards the famous actor,\r\nwho had been one of his pupils. Here, led by old associations, Johnson made\r\nhimself known to the booksellers, and now and then earned a penny by\r\nwriting prefaces, reviews, and translations.\r\n\r\nIt was a dog's life, indeed, that he led there with his literary brethren.\r\nMany of the writers of the day, who are ridiculed in Pope's heartless\r\n_Dunciad_, having no wealthy patrons to support them, lived largely in the\r\nstreets and taverns, sleeping on an ash heap or under a wharf, like rats;\r\nglad of a crust, and happy over a single meal which enabled them to work\r\nfor a while without the reminder of hunger. A few favored ones lived in\r\nwretched lodgings in Grub Street, which has since become a synonym for the\r\nfortunes of struggling writers.[195] Often, Johnson tells us, he walked the\r\nstreets all night long, in dreary weather, when it was too cold to sleep,\r\nwithout food or shelter. But he wrote steadily for the booksellers and for\r\nthe _Gentleman's Magazine_, and presently he became known in London and\r\nreceived enough work to earn a bare living.\r\n\r\nThe works which occasioned this small success were his poem, \"London,\" and\r\nhis _Life of the Poet Savage_, a wretched life, at best, which were perhaps\r\nbetter left without a biographer. But his success was genuine, though\r\nsmall, and presently the booksellers of London are coming to him to ask him\r\nto write a dictionary of the English language. It was an enormous work,\r\ntaking nearly eight years of his time, and long before he had finished it\r\nhe had eaten up the money which he received for his labor. In the leisure\r\nintervals of this work he wrote \"The Vanity of Human Wishes\" and other\r\npoems, and finished his classic tragedy of _Irene_.\r\n\r\nLed by the great success of the _Spectator_, Johnson started two magazines,\r\n_The Rambler_ (1750--1752) and _The Idler_ (1758--1760). Later the\r\n_Rambler_ essays were published in book form and ran rapidly through ten\r\neditions; but the financial returns were small, and Johnson spent a large\r\npart of his earnings in charity. When his mother died, in 1759, Johnson,\r\nalthough one of the best known men in London, had no money, and hurriedly\r\nfinished _Rasselas_, his only romance, in order, it is said, to pay for his\r\nmother's burial.\r\n\r\nIt was not till 1762, when Johnson was fifty-three years old, that his\r\nliterary labors were rewarded in the usual way by royalty, and he received\r\nfrom George III a yearly pension of three hundred pounds. Then began a\r\nlittle sunshine in his life. With Joshua Reynolds, the artist, he founded\r\nthe famous Literary Club, of which Burke, Pitt, Fox, Gibbon, Goldsmith, and\r\nindeed all the great literary men and politicians of the time, were\r\nmembers. This is the period of Johnson's famous conversations, which were\r\ncaught in minutest detail by Boswell and given to the world. His idea of\r\nconversation, as shown in a hundred places in Boswell, is to overcome your\r\nadversary at any cost; to knock him down by arguments, or, when these fail,\r\nby personal ridicule; to dogmatize on every possible question, pronounce a\r\nfew oracles, and then desist with the air of victory. Concerning the\r\nphilosopher Hume's view of death he says: \"Sir, if he really thinks so, his\r\nperceptions are disturbed, he is mad. If he does not think so, he lies.\"\r\nExit opposition. There is nothing more to be said. Curiously enough, it is\r\noften the palpable blunders of these monologues that now attract us, as if\r\nwe were enjoying a good joke at the dictator's expense. Once a lady asked\r\nhim, \"Dr. Johnson, why did you define _pastern_ as the knee of a horse?\"\r\n\"Ignorance, madame, pure ignorance,\" thundered the great authority.\r\n\r\nWhen seventy years of age, Johnson was visited by several booksellers of\r\nthe city, who were about to bring out a new edition of the English poets,\r\nand who wanted Johnson, as the leading literary man of London, to write the\r\nprefaces to the several volumes. The result was his _Lives of the Poets_,\r\nas it is now known, and this is his last literary work. He died in his poor\r\nFleet Street house, in 1784, and was buried among England's honored poets\r\nin Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nJOHNSON'S WORKS. \"A book,\" says Dr. Johnson, \"should help us either to\r\nenjoy life or to endure it.\" Judged by this standard, one is puzzled what\r\nto recommend among Johnson's numerous books. The two things which belong\r\namong the things \"worthy to be remembered\" are his _Dictionary_ and his\r\n_Lives of the Poets_, though both these are valuable, not as literature,\r\nbut rather as a study of literature. The _Dictionary_, as the first\r\nambitious attempt at an English lexicon, is extremely valuable,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that his derivations are often faulty, and that he\r\nfrequently exercises his humor or prejudice in his curious definitions. In\r\ndefining \"oats,\" for example, as a grain given in England to horses and in\r\nScotland to the people, he indulges his prejudice against the Scotch, whom\r\nhe never understood, just as, in his definition of \"pension,\" he takes\r\noccasion to rap the writers who had flattered their patrons since the days\r\nof Elizabeth; though he afterwards accepted a comfortable pension for\r\nhimself. With characteristic honesty he refused to alter his definition in\r\nsubsequent editions of the _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\nThe _Lives of the Poets_ are the simplest and most readable of his literary\r\nworks. For ten years before beginning these biographies he had given\r\nhimself up to conversation, and the ponderous style of his _Rambler_ essays\r\nhere gives way to a lighter and more natural expression. As criticisms they\r\nare often misleading, giving praise to artificial poets, like Cowley and\r\nPope, and doing scant justice or abundant injustice to nobler poets like\r\nGray and Milton; and they are not to be compared with those found in Thomas\r\nWarton's _History of English Poetry_, which was published in the same\r\ngeneration. As biographies, however, they are excellent reading, and we owe\r\nto them some of our best known pictures of the early English poets.\r\n\r\nOf Johnson's poems the reader will have enough if he glance over \"The\r\nVanity of Human Wishes.\" His only story, _Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia_,\r\nis a matter of rhetoric rather than of romance, but is interesting still to\r\nthe reader who wants to hear Johnson's personal views of society,\r\nphilosophy, and religion. Any one of his _Essays_, like that on \"Reading,\"\r\nor \"The Pernicious Effects of Revery,\" will be enough to acquaint the\r\nreader with the Johnsonese style, which was once much admired and copied by\r\norators, but which happily has been replaced by a more natural way of\r\nspeaking. Most of his works, it must be confessed, are rather tiresome. It\r\nis not to his books, but rather to the picture of the man himself, as given\r\nby Boswell, that Johnson owes his great place in our literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOSWELL'S \"LIFE OF JOHNSON\"\r\n\r\nIn James Boswell (1740-1795) we have another extraordinary figure,--a\r\nshallow little Scotch barrister, who trots about like a dog at the heels of\r\nhis big master, frantic at a caress and groveling at a cuff, and abundantly\r\ncontented if only he can be near him and record his oracles. All his life\r\nlong Boswell's one ambition seems to have been to shine in the reflected\r\nglory of great men, and his chief task to record their sayings and doings.\r\nWhen he came to London, at twenty-two years of age, Johnson, then at the\r\nbeginning of his great fame, was to this insatiable little glory-seeker\r\nlike a Silver Doctor to a hungry trout. He sought an introduction as a man\r\nseeks gold, haunted every place where Johnson declaimed, until in Davies's\r\nbookstore the supreme opportunity came. This is his record of the great\r\nevent:\r\n\r\nI was much agitated [says Boswell] and recollecting his prejudice against\r\nthe Scotch, of which I had heard much, I said to Davies, \"Don't tell him\r\nwhere I come from.\" \"From Scotland,\" cried Davies roguishly. \"Mr. Johnson,\"\r\nsaid I, \"I do indeed come from Scotland, but I cannot help it.\"... \"That,\r\nsir\" [cried Johnson], \"I find is what a very great many of your countrymen\r\ncannot help.\" This stroke stunned me a good deal; and when we had sat down\r\nI felt myself not a little embarrassed, and apprehensive of what might come\r\nnext.\r\n\r\nThen for several years, with a persistency that no rebuffs could abate, and\r\nwith a thick skin that no amount of ridicule could render sensitive, he\r\nfollows Johnson; forces his way into the Literary Club, where he is not\r\nwelcome, in order to be near his idol; carries him off on a visit to the\r\nHebrides; talks with him on every possible occasion; and, when he is not\r\ninvited to a feast, waits outside the house or tavern in order to walk home\r\nwith his master in the thick fog of the early morning. And the moment the\r\noracle is out of sight and in bed, Boswell patters home to record in detail\r\nall that he has seen and heard. It is to his minute record that we owe our\r\nonly perfect picture of a great man; all his vanity as well as his\r\ngreatness, his prejudices, superstitions, and even the details of his\r\npersonal appearance:\r\n\r\nThere is the gigantic body, the huge face seamed with the scars of disease,\r\nthe brown coat, the black worsted stockings, the gray wig with the scorched\r\nforetop, the dirty hands, the nails bitten and pared to the quick. We see\r\nthe eyes and mouth moving with convulsive twitches; we see the heavy form\r\nrolling; we hear it puffing; and then comes the \"Why, sir!\" and the \"What\r\nthen, sir?\" and the \"No, sir!\" and the \"You don't see your way through the\r\nquestion, sir!\"[196]\r\n\r\nTo Boswell's record we are indebted also for our knowledge of those famous\r\nconversations, those wordy, knockdown battles, which made Johnson famous in\r\nhis time and which still move us to wonder. Here is a specimen\r\nconversation, taken almost at random from a hundred such in Boswell's\r\nincomparable biography. After listening to Johnson's prejudice against\r\nScotland, and his dogmatic utterances on Voltaire, Robertson, and twenty\r\nothers, an unfortunate theorist brings up a recent essay on the possible\r\nfuture life of brutes, quoting some possible authority from the sacred\r\nscriptures:\r\n\r\nJohnson, who did not like to hear anything concerning a future state which\r\nwas not authorized by the regular canons of orthodoxy, discouraged this\r\ntalk; and being offended at its continuation, he watched an opportunity to\r\ngive the gentleman a blow of reprehension. So when the poor speculatist,\r\nwith a serious, metaphysical, pensive face, addressed him, \"But really,\r\nsir, when we see a very sensible dog, we don't know what to think of him\";\r\nJohnson, rolling with joy at the thought which beamed in his eye, turned\r\nquickly round and replied, \"True, sir; and when we see a very _foolish\r\nfellow_, we don't know what to think of _him_.\" He then rose up, strided to\r\nthe fire, and stood for some time laughing and exulting.\r\n\r\nThen the oracle proceeds to talk of scorpions and natural history, denying\r\nfacts, and demanding proofs which nobody could possibly furnish:\r\n\r\nHe seemed pleased to talk of natural philosophy. \"That woodcocks,\" said he,\r\n\"fly over the northern countries is proved, because they have been observed\r\nat sea. Swallows certainly sleep all the winter. A number of them\r\nconglobulate together by flying round and round, and then all in a heap\r\nthrow themselves under water and lie in the bed of a river.\" He told us one\r\nof his first essays was a Latin poem upon the glowworm: I am sorry I did\r\nnot ask where it was to be found.\r\n\r\nThen follows an astonishing array of subjects and opinions. He catalogues\r\nlibraries, settles affairs in China, pronounces judgment on men who marry\r\nwomen superior to themselves, flouts popular liberty, hammers Swift\r\nunmercifully, and adds a few miscellaneous oracles, most of which are about\r\nas reliable as his knowledge of the hibernation of swallows.\r\n\r\nWhen I called upon Dr. Johnson next morning I found him highly satisfied\r\nwith his colloquial prowess the preceding evening. \"Well,\" said he, \"we had\r\ngood talk.\" \"Yes, sir\" [says I], \"you tossed and gored several persons.\"\r\n\r\nFar from resenting this curious mental dictatorship, his auditors never\r\nseem to weary. They hang upon his words, praise him, flatter him, repeat\r\nhis judgments all over London the next day, and return in the evening\r\nhungry for more. Whenever the conversation begins to flag, Boswell is like\r\na woman with a parrot, or like a man with a dancing bear. He must excite\r\nthe creature, make him talk or dance for the edification of the company. He\r\nsidles obsequiously towards his hero and, with utter irrelevancy, propounds\r\na question of theology, a social theory, a fashion of dress or marriage, a\r\nphilosophical conundrum: \"Do you think, sir, that natural affections are\r\nborn with us?\" or, \"Sir, if you were shut up in a castle and a newborn babe\r\nwith you, what would you do?\" Then follow more Johnsonian laws, judgments,\r\noracles; the insatiable audience clusters around him and applauds; while\r\nBoswell listens, with shining face, and presently goes home to write the\r\nwonder down. It is an astonishing spectacle; one does not know whether to\r\nlaugh or grieve over it. But we know the man, and the audience, almost as\r\nwell as if we had been there; and that, unconsciously, is the superb art of\r\nthis matchless biographer.\r\n\r\nWhen Johnson died the opportunity came for which Boswell had been watching\r\nand waiting some twenty years. He would shine in the world now, not by\r\nreflection, but by his own luminosity. He gathered together his endless\r\nnotes and records, and began to write his biography; but he did not hurry.\r\nSeveral biographies of Johnson appeared, in the four years after his death,\r\nwithout disturbing Boswell's perfect complacency. After seven years' labor\r\nhe gave the world his _Life of Johnson_. It is an immortal work; praise is\r\nsuperfluous; it must be read to be appreciated. Like the Greek sculptors,\r\nthe little slave produced a more enduring work than the great master. The\r\nman who reads it will know Johnson as he knows no other man who dwells\r\nacross the border; and he will lack sensitiveness, indeed, if he lay down\r\nthe work without a greater love and appreciation of all good literature.\r\n\r\nLATER AUGUSTAN WRITERS. With Johnson, who succeeded Dryden and Pope in the\r\nchief place of English letters, the classic movement had largely spent its\r\nforce; and the latter half of the eighteenth century gives us an imposing\r\narray of writers who differ so widely that it is almost impossible to\r\nclassify them. In general, three schools of writers are noticeable: first,\r\nthe classicists, who, under Johnson's lead, insisted upon elegance and\r\nregularity of style; second, the romantic poets, like Collins, Gray,\r\nThomson, and Burns, who revolted from Pope's artificial couplets and wrote\r\nof nature and the human heart[197]; third, the early novelists, like Defoe\r\nand Fielding, who introduced a new type of literature. The romantic poets\r\nand the novelists are reserved for special chapters; and of the other\r\nwriters--Berkeley and Hume in philosophy; Robertson, Hume, and Gibbon in\r\nhistory; Chesterfield and Lady Montagu in letter writing; Adam Smith in\r\neconomics; Pitt, Burke, Fox, and a score of lesser writers in politics--we\r\nselect only two, Burke and Gibbon, whose works are most typical of the\r\nAugustan, i.e. the elegant, classic style of prose writing.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDMUND BURKE (1729--1797)\r\n\r\nTo read all of Burke's collected works, and so to understand him\r\nthoroughly, is something of a task. Few are equal to it. On the other hand,\r\nto read selections here and there, as most of us do, is to get a wrong idea\r\nof the man and to join either in fulsome praise of his brilliant oratory,\r\nor in honest confession that his periods are ponderous and his ideas often\r\nburied under Johnsonian verbiage. Such are the contrasts to be found on\r\nsuccessive pages of Burke's twelve volumes, which cover the enormous range\r\nof the political and economic thought of the age, and which mingle fact and\r\nfancy, philosophy, statistics, and brilliant flights of the imagination, to\r\na degree never before seen in English literature. For Burke belongs in\r\nspirit to the new romantic school, while in style he is a model for the\r\nformal classicists. We can only glance at the life of this marvelous\r\nIrishman, and then consider his place in our literature.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Burke was born in Dublin, the son of an Irish barrister, in 1729.\r\nAfter his university course in Trinity College he came to London to study\r\nlaw, but soon gave up the idea to follow literature, which in turn led him\r\nto politics. He had the soul, the imagination of a poet, and the law was\r\nonly a clog to his progress. His two first works, _A Vindication of Natural\r\nSociety_ and _The Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and the Beautiful_,\r\nbrought him political as well as literary recognition, and several small\r\noffices were in turn given to him. When thirty-six years old he was elected\r\nto Parliament as member from Wendover; and for the next thirty years he was\r\nthe foremost figure in the House of Commons and the most eloquent orator\r\nwhich that body has ever known. Pure and incorruptible in his politics as\r\nin his personal life, no more learned or devoted servant of the\r\nCommonwealth ever pleaded for justice and human liberty. He was at the\r\nsummit of his influence at the time when the colonies were struggling for\r\nindependence; and the fact that he championed their cause in one of his\r\ngreatest speeches, \"On Conciliation with America,\" gives him an added\r\ninterest in the eyes of American readers. His championship of America is\r\nall the more remarkable from the fact that, in other matters, Burke was far\r\nfrom liberal. He set himself squarely against the teachings of the romantic\r\nwriters, who were enthusiastic over the French Revolution; he denounced the\r\nprinciples of the Revolutionists, broke with the liberal Whig party to join\r\nthe Tories, and was largely instrumental in bringing on the terrible war\r\nwith France, which resulted in the downfall of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nIt is good to remember that, in all the strife and bitterness of party\r\npolitics, Burke held steadily to the noblest personal ideals of truth and\r\nhonesty; and that in all his work, whether opposing the slave trade, or\r\npleading for justice for America, or protecting the poor natives of India\r\nfrom the greed of corporations, or setting himself against the popular\r\nsympathy for France in her desperate struggle, he aimed solely at the\r\nwelfare of humanity. When he retired on a pension in 1794, he had won, and\r\nhe deserved, the gratitude and affection of the whole nation.\r\n\r\nWORKS. There are three distinctly marked periods in Burke's career, and\r\nthese correspond closely to the years in which he was busied with the\r\naffairs of America, India, and France successively. The first period was\r\none of prophecy. He had studied the history and temper of the American\r\ncolonies, and he warned England of the disaster which must follow her\r\npersistence in ignoring the American demands, and especially the American\r\nspirit. His great speeches, \"On American Taxation\" and \"On Conciliation\r\nwith America,\" were delivered in 1774 and 1775, preceding the Declaration\r\nof Independence. In this period Burke's labor seemed all in vain; he lost\r\nhis cause, and England her greatest colony.\r\n\r\nThe second period is one of denunciation rather than of prophecy. England\r\nhad won India; but when Burke studied the methods of her victory and\r\nunderstood the soulless way in which millions of poor natives were made to\r\nserve the interests of an English monopoly, his soul rose in revolt, and\r\nagain he was the champion of an oppressed people. His two greatest speeches\r\nof this period are \"The Nabob of Arcot's Debts\" and his tremendous\r\n\"Impeachment of Warren Hastings.\" Again he apparently lost his cause,\r\nthough he was still fighting on the side of right. Hastings was acquitted,\r\nand the spoliation of India went on; but the seeds of reform were sown, and\r\ngrew and bore fruit long after Burke's labors were ended.\r\n\r\nThe third period is, curiously enough, one of reaction. Whether because the\r\nhorrors of the French Revolution had frightened him with the danger of\r\npopular liberty, or because his own advance in office and power had made\r\nhim side unconsciously with the upper classes, is unknown. That he was as\r\nsincere and noble now as in all his previous life is not questioned. He\r\nbroke with the liberal Whigs and joined forces with the reactionary Tories.\r\nHe opposed the romantic writers, who were on fire with enthusiasm over the\r\nFrench Revolution, and thundered against the dangers which the\r\nrevolutionary spirit must breed, forgetting that it was a revolution which\r\nhad made modern England possible. Here, where we must judge him to have\r\nbeen mistaken in his cause, he succeeded for the first time. It was due\r\nlargely to Burke's influence that the growing sympathy for the French\r\npeople was checked in England, and war was declared, which ended in the\r\nfrightful victories of Trafalgar and Waterloo.\r\n\r\nBurke's best known work of this period is his _Reflections on the French\r\nRevolution_, which he polished and revised again Essay on and again before\r\nit was finally printed. This ambitious literary essay, though it met with\r\nremarkable success, is a disappointment to the reader. Though of Celtic\r\nblood, Burke did not understand the French, or the principles for which the\r\ncommon people were fighting in their own way[198]; and his denunciations\r\nand apostrophes to France suggest a preacher without humor, hammering away\r\nat sinners who are not present in his congregation. The essay has few\r\nilluminating ideas, but a great deal of Johnsonian rhetoric, which make its\r\nperiods tiresome, notwithstanding our admiration for the brilliancy of its\r\nauthor. More significant is one of Burke's first essays, _A Philosophical\r\nInquiry Into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful_, which\r\nis sometimes read in order to show the contrast in style with Addison's\r\n_Spectator_ essays on the \"Pleasures of the Imagination.\"\r\n\r\nBurke's best known speeches, \"On Conciliation with America,\" \"American\r\nTaxation,\" and the \"Impeachment of Warren Hastings,\" are still much studied\r\nin our schools as models of English prose; and this fact tends to give them\r\nan exaggerated literary importance. Viewed purely as literature, they have\r\nfaults enough; and the first of these, so characteristic of the Classic\r\nAge, is that they abound in fine rhetoric but lack simplicity.[199] In a\r\nstrict sense, these eloquent speeches are not literature, to delight the\r\nreader and to suggest ideas, but studies in rhetoric and in mental\r\nconcentration. All this, however, is on the surface. A careful study of any\r\nof these three famous speeches reveals certain admirable qualities which\r\naccount for the important place they are given in the study of English.\r\nFirst, as showing the stateliness and the rhetorical power of our language,\r\nthese speeches are almost unrivaled. Second, though Burke speaks in prose,\r\nhe is essentially a poet, whose imagery, like that of Milton's prose works,\r\nis more remarkable than that of many of our writers of verse. He speaks in\r\nfigures, images, symbols; and the musical cadence of his sentences reflects\r\nthe influence of his wide reading of poetry. Not only in figurative\r\nexpression, but much more in spirit, he belongs with the poets of the\r\nrevival. At times his language is pseudo-classic, reflecting the influence\r\nof Johnson and his school; but his thought is always romantic; he is\r\ngoverned by ideal rather than by practical interests, and a profound\r\nsympathy for humanity is perhaps his most marked characteristic.\r\n\r\nThird, the supreme object of these orations, so different from the majority\r\nof political speeches, is not to win approval or to gain votes, but to\r\nestablish the truth. Like our own Lincoln, Burke had a superb faith in the\r\ncompelling power of the truth, a faith in men also, who, if the history of\r\nour race means anything, will not willingly follow a lie. The methods of\r\nthese two great leaders are strikingly similar in this respect, that each\r\nrepeats his idea in many ways, presenting the truth from different view\r\npoints, so that it will appeal to men of widely different experiences.\r\nOtherwise the two men are in marked contrast. The uneducated Lincoln speaks\r\nin simple, homely words, draws his illustrations from the farm, and often\r\nadds a humorous story, so apt and \"telling\" that his hearers can never\r\nforget the point of his argument. The scholarly Burke speaks in ornate,\r\nmajestic periods, and searches all history and all literature for his\r\nillustrations. His wealth of imagery and allusions, together with his rare\r\ncombination of poetic and logical reasoning, make these orations\r\nremarkable, entirely apart from their subject and purpose.\r\n\r\nFourth (and perhaps most significant of the man and his work), Burke takes\r\nhis stand squarely upon the principle of justice. He has studied history,\r\nand he finds that to establish justice, between man and man and between\r\nnation and nation, has been the supreme object of every reformer since the\r\nworld began. No small or merely temporary success attracts him; only the\r\ntruth will suffice for an argument; and nothing less than justice will ever\r\nsettle a question permanently. Such is his platform, simple as the Golden\r\nRule, unshakable as the moral law. Hence, though he apparently fails of his\r\nimmediate desire in each of these three orations, the principle for which\r\nhe contends cannot fail. As a modern writer says of Lincoln, \"The full,\r\nrich flood of his life through the nation's pulse is yet beating\"; and his\r\nwords are still potent in shaping the course of English politics in the way\r\nof justice.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD GIBBON (1737-1794)\r\n\r\nTo understand Burke or Johnson, one must read a multitude of books and be\r\nwary in his judgment; but with Gibbon the task is comparatively easy, for\r\none has only to consider two books, his _Memoirs_ and the first volume of\r\nhis _History_, to understand the author. In his _Memoirs_ we have an\r\ninteresting reflection of Gibbon's own personality,--a man who looks with\r\nsatisfaction on the material side of things, who seeks always the easiest\r\npath for himself, and avoids life's difficulties and responsibilities. \"I\r\nsighed as a lover; but I obeyed as a son,\" he says, when, to save his\r\ninheritance, he gave up the woman he loved and came home to enjoy the\r\npaternal loaves and fishes. That is suggestive of the man's whole life. His\r\n_History_, on the other hand, is a remarkable work. It was the first in our\r\nlanguage to be written on scientific principles, and with a solid basis of\r\nfact; and the style is the very climax of that classicism which had ruled\r\nEngland for an entire century. Its combination of historical fact and\r\nliterary style makes _The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_ the one\r\nthing of Gibbon's life that is \"worthy to be remembered.\"\r\n\r\nGIBBON'S HISTORY. For many years Gibbon had meditated, like Milton, upon an\r\nimmortal work, and had tried several historical subjects, only to give them\r\nup idly. In his _Journal_ he tells us how his vague resolutions were\r\nbrought to a focus:\r\n\r\nIt was at Rome, on the fifteenth of October, 1764, as I sat musing amidst\r\nthe ruins of the Capitol, while the barefooted friars were singing vespers\r\nin the Temple of Jupiter, that the idea of writing the decline and fall of\r\nthe city first started to my mind.\r\n\r\nTwelve years later, in 1776, Gibbon published the first volume of _The\r\nDecline and Fall of the Roman Empire;_ and the enormous success of the work\r\nencouraged him to go on with the other five volumes, which were published\r\nat intervals during the next twelve years. The History begins with the\r\nreign of Trajan, in A.D. 98, and \"builds a straight Roman road\" through the\r\nconfused histories of thirteen centuries, ending with the fall of the\r\nByzantine Empire in 1453. The scope of the History is enormous. It includes\r\nnot only the decline of the Roman Empire, but such movements as the descent\r\nof the northern barbarians, the spread of Christianity, the reorganization\r\nof the European nations, the establishment of the great Eastern Empire, the\r\nrise of Mohammedanism, and the splendor of the Crusades. On the one hand it\r\nlacks philosophical insight, being satisfied with facts without\r\ncomprehending the causes; and, as Gibbon seems lacking in ability to\r\nunderstand spiritual and religious movements, it is utterly inadequate in\r\nits treatment of the tremendous influence of Christianity. On the other\r\nhand, Gibbon's scholarship leaves little to criticise; he read enormously,\r\nsifted his facts out of multitudes of books and records, and then marshaled\r\nthem in the imposing array with which we have grown familiar. Moreover, he\r\nis singularly just and discriminating in the use of all documents and\r\nauthorities at his command. Hence he has given us the first history in\r\nEnglish that has borne successfully the test of modern research and\r\nscholarship.\r\n\r\nThe style of the work is as imposing as his great subject. Indeed, with\r\nalmost any other subject the sonorous roll of his majestic sentences would\r\nbe out of place. While it deserves all the adjectives that have been\r\napplied to it by enthusiastic admirers,--finished, elegant, splendid,\r\nrounded, massive, sonorous, copious, elaborate, ornate, exhaustive,--it\r\nmust be confessed, though one whispers the confession, that the style\r\nsometimes obscures our interest in the narrative. As he sifted his facts\r\nfrom a multitude of sources, so he often hides them again in endless\r\nperiods, and one must often sift them out again in order to be quite sure\r\nof even the simple facts. Another drawback is that Gibbon is hopelessly\r\nworldly in his point of view; he loves pageants and crowds rather than\r\nindividuals, and he is lacking in enthusiasm and in spiritual insight. The\r\nresult is so frankly material at times that one wonders if he is not\r\nreading of forces or machines, rather than of human beings. A little\r\nreading of his History here and there is an excellent thing, leaving one\r\nimpressed with the elegant classical style and the scholarship; but a\r\ncontinued reading is very apt to leave us longing for simplicity, for\r\nnaturalness, and, above all, for the glow of enthusiasm which makes the\r\ndead heroes live once more in the written pages.\r\n\r\nThis judgment, however, must not obscure the fact that the book had a\r\nremarkably large sale; and that this, of itself, is an evidence that\r\nmultitudes of readers found it not only erudite, but readable and\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nII. THE REVIVAL OF ROMANTIC POETRY\r\n\r\n      The old order changeth, yielding place to new;\r\n      And God fulfills Himself in many ways,\r\n      Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.\r\n                     Tennyson's \"The Passing of Arthur.\"\r\n\r\nTHE MEANING OF ROMANTICISM. While Dryden, Pope, and Johnson were\r\nsuccessively the dictators of English letters, and while, under their\r\nleadership, the heroic couplet became the fashion of poetry, and literature\r\nin general became satiric or critical in spirit, and formal in expression,\r\na new romantic movement quietly made its appearance. Thomson's _The\r\nSeasons_ (1730) was the first noteworthy poem of the romantic revival; and\r\nthe poems and the poets increased steadily in number and importance till,\r\nin the age of Wordsworth and Scott, the spirit of Romanticism dominated our\r\nliterature more completely than Classicism had ever done. This romantic\r\nmovement--which Victor Hugo calls \"liberalism in literature\"--is simply the\r\nexpression of life as seen by imagination, rather than by prosaic \"common\r\nsense,\" which was the central doctrine of English philosophy in the\r\neighteenth century. It has six prominent characteristics which distinguish\r\nit from the so-called classic literature which we have just studied:\r\n\r\n1. The romantic movement was marked, and is always marked, by a strong\r\nreaction and protest against the bondage of rule and custom, which, in\r\nscience and theology, as well as in literature, generally tend to fetter\r\nthe free human spirit.\r\n\r\n2. Romanticism returned to nature and to plain humanity for its material,\r\nand so is in marked contrast to Classicism, which had confined itself\r\nlargely to the clubs and drawing-rooms, and to the social and political\r\nlife of London. Thomson's _Seasons_, whatever its defects, was a revelation\r\nof the natural wealth and beauty which, for nearly a century, had been\r\nhardly noticed by the great writers of England.\r\n\r\n3. It brought again the dream of a golden age[200] in which the stern\r\nrealities of life were forgotten and the ideals of youth were established\r\nas the only permanent realities. \"For the dreamer lives forever, but the\r\ntoiler dies in a day,\" expresses, perhaps, only the wild fancy of a modern\r\npoet; but, when we think of it seriously, the dreams and ideals of a people\r\nare cherished possessions long after their stone monuments have crumbled\r\naway and their battles are forgotten. The romantic movement emphasized\r\nthese eternal ideals of youth, and appealed to the human heart as the\r\nclassic elegance of Dryden and Pope could never do.\r\n\r\n4. Romanticism was marked by intense human sympathy, and by a consequent\r\nunderstanding of the human heart. Not to intellect or to science does the\r\nheart unlock its treasures, but rather to the touch of a sympathetic\r\nnature; and things that are hidden from the wise and prudent are revealed\r\nunto children. Pope had no appreciable humanity; Swift's work is a\r\nfrightful satire; Addison delighted polite society, but had no message for\r\nplain people; while even Johnson, with all his kindness, had no feeling for\r\nmen in the mass, but supported Sir Robert Walpole in his policy of letting\r\nevils alone until forced by a revolution to take notice of humanity's\r\nappeal. With the romantic revival all this was changed. While Howard was\r\nworking heroically for prison reform, and Wilberforce for the liberation of\r\nthe slaves, Gray wrote his \"short and simple annals of the poor,\" and\r\nGoldsmith his _Deserted Village_, and Cowper sang,\r\n\r\n                     My ear is pained,\r\n    My soul is sick with every day's report\r\n    Of wrong and outrage with which earth is filled.\r\n    There is no flesh in man's obdurate heart,\r\n    It does not feel for man.[201]\r\n\r\nThis sympathy for the poor, and this cry against oppression, grew stronger\r\nand stronger till it culminated in \"Bobby\" Burns, who, more than any other\r\nwriter in any language, is the poet of the unlettered human heart.\r\n\r\n5. The romantic movement was the expression of individual genius rather\r\nthan of established rules. In consequence, the literature of the revival is\r\nas varied as the characters and moods of the different writers. When we\r\nread Pope, for instance, we have a general impression of sameness, as if\r\nall his polished poems were made in the same machine; but in the work of\r\nthe best romanticists there is endless variety. To read them is like\r\npassing through a new village, meeting a score of different human types,\r\nand finding in each one something to love or to remember. Nature and the\r\nheart of man are as new as if we had never studied them. Hence, in reading\r\nthe romanticists, who went to these sources for their material, we are\r\nseldom wearied but often surprised; and the surprise is like that of the\r\nsunrise, or the sea, which always offers some new beauty and stirs us\r\ndeeply, as if we had never seen it before.\r\n\r\n6. The romantic movement, while it followed its own genius, was not\r\naltogether unguided. Strictly speaking, there is no new movement either in\r\nhistory or in literature; each grows out of some good thing which has\r\npreceded it, and looks back with reverence to past masters. Spenser,\r\nShakespeare, and Milton were the inspiration of the romantic revival; and\r\nwe can hardly read a poem of the early romanticists without finding a\r\nsuggestion of the influence of one of these great leaders.[202]\r\n\r\nThere are various other characteristics of Romanticism, but these six--the\r\nprotest against the bondage of rules, the return to nature and the human\r\nheart, the interest in old sagas and mediæval romances as suggestive of a\r\nheroic age, the sympathy for the toilers of the world, the emphasis upon\r\nindividual genius, and the return to Milton and the Elizabethans, instead\r\nof to Pope and Dryden, for literary models--are the most noticeable and\r\nthe most interesting. Remembering them, we shall better appreciate the work\r\nof the following writers who, in varying degree, illustrate the revival of\r\nromantic poetry in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS GRAY (1716-1771)\r\n\r\n    The curfew tolls the knell of parting day;\r\n    The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea;\r\n    The plowman homeward plods his weary way,\r\n    And leaves the world to darkness and to me.\r\n    Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,\r\n    And all the air a solemn stillness holds,\r\n    Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,\r\n    And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds.\r\n\r\nSo begins \"the best known poem in the English language,\" a poem full of the\r\ngentle melancholy which marks all early romantic poetry. It should be read\r\nentire, as a perfect model of its kind. Not even Milton's \"Il Penseroso,\"\r\nwhich it strongly suggests, excels it in beauty and suggestiveness.\r\n\r\nLIFE OF GRAY. The author of the famous \"Elegy\" is the most scholarly and\r\nwell-balanced of all the early romantic poets. In his youth he was a\r\nweakling, the only one of twelve children who survived infancy; and his\r\nunhappy childhood, the tyranny of his father, and the separation from his\r\nloved mother, gave to his whole life the stamp of melancholy which is\r\nnoticeable in all his poems. At the famous Eton school and again at\r\nCambridge, he seems to have followed his own scholarly tastes rather than\r\nthe curriculum, and was shocked, like Gibbon, at the general idleness and\r\naimlessness of university life. One happy result of his school life was his\r\nfriendship for Horace Walpole, who took him abroad for a three years' tour\r\nof the Continent.\r\n\r\nNo better index of the essential difference between the classical and the\r\nnew romantic school can be imagined than that which is revealed in the\r\nletters of Gray and Addison, as they record their impressions of foreign\r\ntravel. Thus, when Addison crossed the Alps, some twenty-five years before,\r\nin good weather, he wrote: \"A very troublesome journey.... You cannot\r\nimagine how I am pleased with the sight of a plain.\" Gray crossed the Alps\r\nin the beginning of winter, \"wrapped in muffs, hoods and masks of beaver,\r\nfur boots, and bearskins,\" but wrote ecstatically, \"Not a precipice, not a\r\ntorrent, not a cliff but is pregnant with religion and poetry.\"\r\n\r\nOn his return to England, Gray lived for a short time at Stoke Poges, where\r\nhe wrote his \"Ode on Eton,\" and probably sketched his \"Elegy,\" which,\r\nhowever, was not finished till 1750, eight years later. During the latter\r\nyears of his shy and scholarly life he was Professor of Modern History and\r\nLanguages at Cambridge, without any troublesome work of lecturing to\r\nstudents. Here he gave himself up to study and to poetry, varying his work\r\nby \"prowlings\" among the manuscripts of the new British Museum, and by his\r\n\"Lilliputian\" travels in England and Scotland. He died in his rooms at\r\nPembroke College in 1771, and was buried in the little churchyard of Stoke\r\nPoges.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF GRAY. Gray's _Letters_, published in 1775, are excellent reading,\r\nand his _Journal_ is still a model of natural description; but it is to a\r\nsingle small volume of poems that he owes his fame and his place in\r\nliterature. These poems divide themselves naturally into three periods, in\r\nwhich we may trace the progress of Gray's emancipation from the classic\r\nrules which had so long governed English literature. In the first period he\r\nwrote several minor poems, of which the best are his \"Hymn to Adversity\"\r\nand the odes \"To Spring\" and \"On a Distant Prospect of Eton College.\" These\r\nearly poems reveal two suggestive things: first, the appearance of that\r\nmelancholy which characterizes all the poetry of the period; and second,\r\nthe study of nature, not for its own beauty or truth, but rather as a\r\nsuitable background for the play of human emotions.\r\n\r\nThe second period shows the same tendencies more strongly developed. The\r\n\"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard\" (1750), the most perfect poem of\r\nthe age, belongs to this period. To read Milton's \"Il Penseroso\" and Gray's\r\n\"Elegy\" is to see the beginning and the perfection of that \"literature of\r\nmelancholy\" which largely occupied English poets for more than a century.\r\nTwo other well-known poems of this second period are the Pindaric odes,\r\n\"The Progress of Poesy\" and \"The Bard.\" The first is strongly suggestive of\r\nDryden's \"Alexander's Feast,\" but shows Milton's influence in a greater\r\nmelody and variety of expression. \"The Bard\" is, in every way, more\r\nromantic and original. An old minstrel, the last of the Welsh singers,\r\nhalts King Edward and his army in a wild mountain pass, and with fine\r\npoetic frenzy prophesies the terror and desolation which must ever follow\r\nthe tyrant. From its first line, \"Ruin seize thee, ruthless King!\" to the\r\nend, when the old bard plunges from his lofty crag and disappears in the\r\nriver's flood, the poem thrills with the fire of an ancient and noble race\r\nof men. It breaks absolutely with the classical school and proclaims a\r\nliterary declaration of independence.\r\n\r\nIn the third period Gray turns momentarily from his Welsh material and\r\nreveals a new field of romantic interest in two Norse poems, \"The Fatal\r\nSisters\" and \"The Descent of Odin\" (1761). Gray translated his material\r\nfrom the Latin, and though these two poems lack much of the elemental\r\nstrength and grandeur of the Norse sagas, they are remarkable for calling\r\nattention to the unused wealth of literary material that was hidden in\r\nNorthern mythologv. To Gray and to Percy (who published his _Northern\r\nAntiquities_ in 1770) is due in large measure the profound interest in the\r\nold Norse sagas which has continued to our own day.\r\n\r\nTaken together, Gray's works form a most interesting commentary on the\r\nvaried life of the eighteenth century. He was a scholar, familiar with all\r\nthe intellectual interests of his age, and his work has much of the\r\nprecision and polish of the classical school; but he shares also the\r\nreawakened interest in nature, in common man, and in mediæval culture, and\r\nhis work is generally romantic both in style and in spirit. The same\r\nconflict between the classic and romantic schools, and the triumph of\r\nRomanticism, is shown clearly in the most versatile of Gray's\r\ncontemporaries, Oliver Goldsmith.\r\n\r\nOLIVER GOLDSMITH (1728-1774)\r\n\r\nBecause _The Deserted Village_ is one of the most familiar poems in our\r\nlanguage, Goldsmith is generally given a high place among the poets of the\r\nromantic dawn. But the _Village_, when we read it carefully, turns out to\r\nbe a rimed essay in the style of Pope's famous _Essay on Man_; it owes its\r\npopularity to the sympathetic memories which it awakens, rather than to its\r\npoetic excellence. It is as a prose writer that Goldsmith excels. He is an\r\nessayist, with Addison's fine polish but with more sympathy for human life;\r\nhe is a dramatist, one of the very few who have ever written a comedy that\r\ncan keep its popularity unchanged while a century rolls over its head; but\r\ngreater, perhaps, than the poet and essayist and dramatist is Goldsmith the\r\nnovelist, who set himself to the important work of purifying the early\r\nnovel of its brutal and indecent tendencies, and who has given us, in _The\r\nVicar of Wakefield_, one of the most enduring characters in English\r\nfiction. In his manner, especially in his poetry, Goldsmith was too much\r\ninfluenced by his friend Johnson and the classicists; but in his matter, in\r\nhis sympathy for nature and human life, he belongs unmistakably to the new\r\nromantic school. Altogether he is the most versatile, the most charming,\r\nthe most inconsistent, and the most lovable genius of all the literary men\r\nwho made famous the age of Johnson.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Goldsmith's career is that of an irresponsible, unbalanced genius,\r\nwhich would make one despair if the man himself did not remain so lovable\r\nin all his inconsistencies. He was born in the village of Pallas, Ireland,\r\nthe son of a poor Irish curate whose noble character is portrayed in Dr.\r\nPrimrose, of _The Vicar of Wakefield_, and in the country parson of _The\r\nDeserted Village_. After an unsatisfactory course in various schools, where\r\nhe was regarded as hopelessly stupid, Goldsmith entered Trinity College,\r\nDublin, as a sizar, i.e. a student who pays with labor for his tuition. By\r\nhis escapades he was brought into disfavor with the authorities, but that\r\ntroubled him little. He was also wretchedly poor, which troubled him less;\r\nfor when he earned a few shillings by writing ballads for street singers,\r\nhis money went oftener to idle beggars than to the paying of his honest\r\ndebts. After three years of university life he ran away, in dime-novel\r\nfashion, and nearly starved to death before he was found and brought back\r\nin disgrace. Then he worked a little, and obtained his degree in 1749.\r\n\r\nStrange that such an idle and irresponsible youth should have been urged by\r\nhis family to take holy orders; but such was the fact. For two years more\r\nGoldsmith labored with theology, only to be rejected when he presented\r\nhimself as a candidate for the ministry. He tried teaching, and failed.\r\nThen his fancy turned to America, and, provided with money and a good\r\nhorse, he started off for Cork, where he was to embark for the New World.\r\nHe loafed along the pleasant Irish ways, missed his ship, and presently\r\nturned up cheerfully amongst his relatives, minus all his money, and riding\r\na sorry nag called Fiddleback, for which he had traded his own on the\r\nway.[203] He borrowed fifty pounds more, and started for London to study\r\nlaw, but speedily lost his money at cards, and again appeared, amiable and\r\nirresponsible as ever, among his despairing relatives. The next year they\r\nsent him to Edinburgh to study medicine. Here for a couple of years he\r\nbecame popular as a singer of songs and a teller of tales, to whom medicine\r\nwas only a troublesome affliction. Suddenly the _Wanderlust_ seized him and\r\nhe started abroad, ostensibly to complete his medical education, but in\r\nreality to wander like a cheerful beggar over Europe, singing and playing\r\nhis flute for food and lodging. He may have studied a little at Leyden and\r\nat Padua, but that was only incidental. After a year or more of vagabondage\r\nhe returned to London with an alleged medical degree, said to have been\r\nobtained at Louvain or Padua.\r\n\r\nThe next few years are a pitiful struggle to make a living as tutor,\r\napothecary's assistant, comedian, usher in a country school, and finally as\r\na physician in Southwark. Gradually he drifted into literature, and lived\r\nfrom hand to mouth by doing hack work for the London booksellers. Some of\r\nhis essays and his _Citizen of the World_ (1760-1761) brought him to the\r\nattention of Johnson, who looked him up, was attracted first by his poverty\r\nand then by his genius, and presently declared him to be \"one of the first\r\nmen we now have as an author.\" Johnson's friendship proved invaluable, and\r\npresently Goldsmith found himself a member of the exclusive Literary Club.\r\nHe promptly justified Johnson's confidence by publishing _The Traveller_\r\n(1764), which was hailed as one of the finest poems of the century. Money\r\nnow came to him liberally, with orders from the booksellers; he took new\r\nquarters in Fleet Street and furnished them gorgeously; but he had an\r\ninordinate vanity for bright-colored clothes, and faster than he earned\r\nmoney he spent it on velvet cloaks and in indiscriminate charity. For a\r\ntime he resumed his practice as a physician, but his fine clothes did not\r\nbring patients, as he expected; and presently he turned to writing again,\r\nto pay his debts to the booksellers. He produced several superficial and\r\ngrossly inaccurate schoolbooks,--like his _Animated Nature_ and his\r\nhistories of England, Greece, and Rome,--which brought him bread and more\r\nfine clothes, and his _Vicar of Wakefield, The Deserted Village_, and _She\r\nStoops to Conquer_, which brought him undying fame.\r\n\r\nAfter meeting with Johnson, Goldsmith became the object of Boswell's magpie\r\ncuriosity; and to Boswell's _Life of Johnson_ we are indebted for many of\r\nthe details of Goldsmith's life,--his homeliness, his awkward ways, his\r\ndrolleries and absurdities, which made him alternately the butt and the wit\r\nof the famous Literary Club. Boswell disliked Goldsmith, and so draws an\r\nunflattering Portrait, but even this does not disguise the contagious good\r\nhumor which made men love him. When in his forty-seventh year, he fell sick\r\nof a fever, and with childish confidence turned to a quack medicine to cure\r\nhimself. He died in 1774, and Johnson placed a tablet, with a sonorous\r\nLatin epitaph, in Westminster Abbey, though Goldsmith was buried elsewhere.\r\n\"Let not his frailties be remembered; he was a very great man,\" said\r\nJohnson; and the literary world--which, like that old dictator, is kind\r\nenough at heart, though often rough in its methods--is glad to accept and\r\nrecord the verdict.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF GOLDSMITH. Of Goldsmith's early essays and his later school\r\nhistories little need be said. They have settled into their own place, far\r\nout of sight of the ordinary reader. Perhaps the most interesting of these\r\nis a series of letters for the _Public Ledger_ (afterwards published as\r\n_The Citizen of the World_), written from the view point of an alleged\r\nChinese traveler, and giving the latter's comments on English\r\ncivilization.[204] The following five works are those upon which\r\nGoldsmith's fame chiefly rests:\r\n\r\n_The Traveller_ (1764) made Goldsmith's reputation among his\r\ncontemporaries, but is now seldom read, except by students who would\r\nunderstand how Goldsmith was, at one time, dominated by Johnson and his\r\npseudo-classic ideals. It is a long poem, in rimed couplets, giving a\r\nsurvey and criticism of the social life of various countries in Europe, and\r\nreflects many of Goldsmith's own wanderings and impressions.\r\n\r\n_The Deserted Village_ (1770), though written in the same mechanical style,\r\nis so permeated with honest human sympathy, and voices so perfectly the\r\nrevolt of the individual man against institutions, that a multitude of\r\ncommon people heard it gladly, without consulting the critics as to whether\r\nthey should call it good poetry. Notwithstanding its faults, to which\r\nMatthew Arnold has called sufficient attention, it has become one of our\r\nbest known poems, though we cannot help wishing that the monotony of its\r\ncouplets had been broken by some of the Irish folk songs and ballads that\r\ncharmed street audiences in Dublin, and that brought Goldsmith a welcome\r\nfrom the French peasants wherever he stopped to sing. In the village parson\r\nand the schoolmaster, Goldsmith has increased Chaucer's list by two lovable\r\ncharacters that will endure as long as the English language. The criticism\r\nthat the picture of prosperous \"Sweet Auburn\" never applied to any village\r\nin Ireland is just, no doubt, but it is outside the question. Goldsmith was\r\na hopeless dreamer, bound to see everything, as he saw his debts and his\r\ngay clothes, in a purely idealistic way.\r\n\r\n_The Good-Natured Man_ and _She Stoops to Conquer_ are Goldsmith's two\r\ncomedies. The former, a comedy of character, though it has some laughable\r\nscenes and one laughable character, Croaker, met with failure on the stage,\r\nand has never been revived with any success. The latter, a comedy of\r\nintrigue, is one of the few plays that has never lost its popularity. Its\r\nlively, bustling scenes, and its pleasantly absurd characters, Marlowe, the\r\nHardcastles, and Tony Lumpkin, still hold the attention of modern theater\r\ngoers; and nearly every amateur dramatic club sooner or later places _She\r\nStoops to Conquer_ on its list of attractions.\r\n\r\n_The Vicar of Wakefield_ is Goldsmith's only novel, and the first in any\r\nlanguage that gives to home life an enduring romantic interest. However\r\nmuch we admire the beginnings of the English novel, to which we shall\r\npresently refer, we are nevertheless shocked by its frequent brutalities\r\nand indecencies. Goldsmith like Steele, had the Irish reverence for pure\r\nwomanhood, and this reverence made him shun as a pest the vulgarity and\r\ncoarseness in which contemporary novelists, like Smollett and Sterne,\r\nseemed to delight. So he did for the novel what Addison and Steele had done\r\nfor the satire and the essay; he refined and elevated it, making it worthy\r\nof the old Anglo-Saxon ideals which are our best literary heritage.\r\n\r\nBriefly, _The Vicar of Wakefield_ is the story of a simple English\r\nclergyman, Dr. Primrose, and his family, who pass from happiness through\r\ngreat tribulation. Misfortunes, which are said never to come singly, appear\r\nin this case in flocks; but through poverty, sorrow, imprisonment, and the\r\nunspeakable loss of his daughters, the Vicar's faith in God and man emerges\r\ntriumphant. To the very end he is like one of the old martyrs, who sings\r\n_Alleluia_ while the lions roar about him and his children in the arena.\r\nGoldsmith's optimism, it must be confessed, is here stretched to the\r\nbreaking point. The reader is sometimes offered fine Johnsonian phrases\r\nwhere he would naturally expect homely and vigorous language; and he is\r\ncontinually haunted by the suspicion that, even in this best of all\r\npossible worlds, the Vicar's clouds of affliction were somewhat too easily\r\nconverted into showers of blessing; yet he is forced to read on, and at the\r\nend he confesses gladly that Goldsmith has succeeded in making a most\r\ninteresting story out of material that, in other hands, would have\r\ndeveloped either a burlesque or a brutal tragedy. Laying aside all romantic\r\npassion, intrigue, and adventure, upon which other novelists depended,\r\nGoldsmith, in this simple story of common life, has accomplished three\r\nnoteworthy results: he has made human fatherhood almost a divine thing; he\r\nhas glorified the moral sentiments which cluster about the family life as\r\nthe center of civilization; and he has given us, in Dr. Primrose, a\r\nstriking and enduring figure, which seems more like a personal acquaintance\r\nthan a character in a book.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM COWPER (1731--1800)\r\n\r\nIn Cowper we have another interesting poet, who, like Gray and Goldsmith,\r\nshows the struggle between romantic and classic ideals. In his first volume\r\nof poems, Cowper is more hampered by literary fashions than was Goldsmith\r\nin his _Traveller_ and his _Deserted Village_. In his second period,\r\nhowever, Cowper uses blank verse freely; and his delight in nature and in\r\nhomely characters, like the teamster and the mail carrier of _The Task_,\r\nshows that his classicism is being rapidly thawed out by romantic feeling.\r\nIn his later work, especially his immortal \"John Gilpin,\" Cowper flings\r\nfashions aside, gives Pegasus the reins, takes to the open road, and so\r\nproves himself a worthy predecessor of Burns, who is the most spontaneous\r\nand the most interesting of all the early romanticists.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Cowper's life is a pathetic story of a shy and timid genius, who\r\nfound the world of men too rough, and who withdrew to nature like a wounded\r\nanimal. He was born at Great Berkhamstead, Hertfordshire, in 1731, the son\r\nof an English clergyman. He was a delicate, sensitive child, whose early\r\nlife was saddened by the death of his mother and by his neglect at home. At\r\nsix years he was sent away to a boys' school, where he was terrified by\r\nyoung barbarians who made his life miserable. There was one atrocious bully\r\ninto whose face Cowper could never look; he recognized his enemy by his\r\nshoe buckles, and shivered at his approach. The fierce invectives of his\r\n\"Tirocinium, or a Review of Schools\" (1784), shows how these school\r\nexperiences had affected his mind and health. For twelve years he studied\r\nlaw, but at the approach of a public examination for an office he was so\r\nterrified that he attempted suicide. The experience unsettled his reason,\r\nand the next twelve months were spent in an asylum at St. Alban's. The\r\ndeath of his father, in 1756, had brought the poet a small patrimony, which\r\nplaced him above the necessity of struggling, like Goldsmith, for his daily\r\nbread. Upon his recovery he boarded for years at the house of the Unwins,\r\ncultured people who recognized the genius hidden in this shy and melancholy\r\nyet quaintly humorous man. Mrs. Unwin, in particular, cared for him as a\r\nson; and whatever happiness he experienced in his poor life was the result\r\nof the devotion of this good woman, who is the \"Mary\" of all his poems.\r\n\r\nA second attack of insanity was brought on by Cowper's morbid interest in\r\nreligion, influenced, perhaps, by the untempered zeal of one John Newton, a\r\ncurate, with whom Cowper worked in the small parish of Olney, and with whom\r\nhe compiled the famous Olney Hymns. The rest of his life, between intervals\r\nof melancholia or insanity, was spent in gardening, in the care of his\r\nnumerous pets, and in writing his poems, his translation of Homer, and his\r\ncharming letters. His two best known poems were suggested by a lively and\r\ncultivated widow, Lady Austen, who told him the story of John Gilpin and\r\ncalled for a ballad on the subject. She also urged him to write a long poem\r\nin blank verse; and when he demanded a subject, she whimsically suggested\r\nthe sofa, which was a new article of furniture at that time. Cowper\r\nimmediately wrote \"The Sofa,\" and, influenced by the poetic possibilities\r\nthat lie in unexpected places, he added to this poem from time to time, and\r\ncalled his completed work _The Task_. This was published in 1785, and the\r\nauthor was instantly recognized as one of the chief poets of his age. The\r\nlast years of his life were a long battle with insanity, until death\r\nmercifully ended the struggle in 1800. His last poem, \"The Castaway,\" is a\r\ncry of despair, in which, under guise of a man washed overboard in a storm,\r\nhe describes himself perishing in the sight of friends who are powerless to\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\nCOWPER'S WORKS. Cowper's first volume of poems, containing \"The Progress of\r\nError,\" \"Truth,\" \"Table Talk,\" etc., is interesting chiefly as showing how\r\nthe poet was bound by the classical rules of his age. These poems are\r\ndreary, on the whole, but a certain gentleness, and especially a vein of\r\npure humor, occasionally rewards the reader. For Cowper was a humorist, and\r\nonly the constant shadow of insanity kept him from becoming famous in that\r\nline alone.\r\n\r\n_The Task_, written in blank verse, and published in 1785, is Cowper's\r\nlongest poem. Used as we are to the natural poetry of Wordsworth and\r\nTennyson, it is hard for us to appreciate the striking originality of this\r\nwork. Much of it is conventional and \"wooden,\" to be sure, like much of\r\nWordsworth's poetry; but when, after reading the rimed essays and the\r\nartificial couplets of Johnson's age, we turn suddenly to Cowper's\r\ndescription of homely scenes, of woods and brooks, of plowmen and teamsters\r\nand the letter carrier on his rounds, we realize that we are at the dawn of\r\na better day in poetry:\r\n\r\n    He comes, the herald of a noisy world,\r\n    With spatter'd boots, strapp'd waist, and frozen locks:\r\n    News from all nations lumbering at his back.\r\n    True to his charge, the close-packed load behind,\r\n    Yet careless what he brings, his one concern\r\n    Is to conduct it to the destined inn,\r\n    And, having dropped the expected bag, pass on.\r\n    He whistles as he goes, light-hearted wretch,\r\n    Cold and yet cheerful: messenger of grief\r\n    Perhaps to thousands, and of joy to some;\r\n    To him indifferent whether grief or joy.\r\n    Houses in ashes, and the fall of stocks,\r\n    Births, deaths, and marriages, epistles wet\r\n    With tears that trickled down the writer's cheeks\r\n    Fast as the periods from his fluent quill,\r\n    Or charged with amorous sighs of absent swains,\r\n    Or nymphs responsive, equally affect\r\n    His horse and him, unconscious of them all.\r\n\r\nCowper's most laborious work, the translation of Homer in blank verse, was\r\npublished in 1791. Its stately, Milton-like movement, and its better\r\nrendering of the Greek, make this translation far superior to Pope's\r\nartificial couplets. It is also better, in many respects, than Chapman's\r\nmore famous and more fanciful rendering; but for some reason it was not\r\nsuccessful, and has never received the recognition which it deserves.\r\nEntirely different in spirit are the poet's numerous hymns, which were\r\npublished in the Olney Collection in 1779 and which are still used in our\r\nchurches. It is only necessary to mention a few first lines--\"God moves in\r\na mysterious way,\" \"Oh, for a closer walk with God,\" \"Sometimes a light\r\nsurprises\"--to show how his gentle and devout spirit has left its impress\r\nupon thousands who now hardly know his name. With Cowper's charming\r\n_Letters_, published in 1803, we reach the end of his important works, and\r\nthe student who enjoys reading letters will find that these rank among the\r\nbest of their kind. It is not, however, for his ambitious works that Cowper\r\nis remembered, but rather for his minor poems, which have found their own\r\nway into so many homes. Among these, the one that brings quickest response\r\nfrom hearts that understand is his little poem, \"On the Receipt of My\r\nMother's Picture.\" beginning with the striking line, \"Oh, that those lips\r\nhad language.\" Another, called \"Alexander Selkirk,\" beginning, \"I am\r\nmonarch of all I survey,\" suggests how Selkirk's experiences as a castaway\r\n(which gave Defoe his inspiration for _Robinson Crusoe_) affected the\r\npoet's timid nature and imagination. Last and most famous of all is his\r\nimmortal \"John Gilpin.\" Cowper was in a terrible fit of melancholy when\r\nLady Austen told him the story, which proved to be better than medicine,\r\nfor all night long chuckles and suppressed laughter were heard in the\r\npoet's bedroom. Next morning at breakfast he recited the ballad that had\r\nafforded its author so much delight in the making. The student should read\r\nit, even if he reads nothing else by Cowper; and he will be lacking in\r\nhumor or appreciation if he is not ready to echo heartily the last stanza:\r\n\r\n    Now let us sing, Long live the King,\r\n    And Gilpin, long live he!\r\n    And when he next doth ride abroad\r\n    May I be there to see.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT BURNS (1759-1796)\r\n\r\nAfter a century and more of Classicism, we noted with interest the work of\r\nthree men, Gray, Goldsmith, and Cowper, whose poetry, like the chorus of\r\nawakening birds, suggests the dawn of another day. Two other poets of the\r\nsame age suggest the sunrise. The first is the plowman Burns, who speaks\r\nstraight from the heart to the primitive emotions of the race; the second\r\nis the mystic Blake, who only half understands his own thoughts, and whose\r\nwords stir a sensitive nature as music does, or the moon in midheaven,\r\nrousing in the soul those vague desires and aspirations which ordinarily\r\nsleep, and which can never be expressed because they have no names. Blake\r\nlived his shy, mystic, spiritual life in the crowded city, and his message\r\nis to the few who can understand. Burns lived his sad, toilsome, erring\r\nlife in the open air, with the sun and the rain, and his songs touch all\r\nthe world. The latter's poetry, so far as it has a philosophy, rests upon\r\ntwo principles which the classic school never understood,--that common\r\npeople are at heart romantic and lovers of the ideal, and that simple human\r\nemotions furnish the elements of true poetry. Largely because he follows\r\nthese two principles, Burns is probably the greatest song writer of the\r\nworld. His poetic creed may be summed up in one of his own stanzas:\r\n\r\n    Give me ae spark o' Nature's fire,\r\n    That's a' the learning I desire;\r\n    Then, though I trudge thro' dub an' mire\r\n           At pleugh or cart,\r\n    My Muse, though hamely in attire,\r\n           May touch the heart.\r\n\r\nLIFE.[205] Burns's life is \"a life of fragments,\" as Carlyle called it; and\r\nthe different fragments are as unlike as the noble \"Cotter's Saturday\r\nNight\" and the rant and riot of \"The Jolly Beggars.\" The details of this\r\nsad and disjointed life were better, perhaps, forgotten. We call attention\r\nonly to the facts which help us to understand the man and his poetry.\r\n\r\nBurns was born in a clay cottage at Alloway, Scotland, in the bleak winter\r\nof 1759. His father was an excellent type of the Scotch peasant of those\r\ndays,--a poor, honest, God-fearing man, who toiled from dawn till dark to\r\nwrest a living for his family from the stubborn soil. His tall figure was\r\nbent with unceasing labor; his hair was thin and gray, and in his eyes was\r\nthe careworn, hunted look of a peasant driven by poverty and unpaid rents\r\nfrom one poor farm to another. The family often fasted of necessity, and\r\nlived in solitude to avoid the temptation of spending their hard-earned\r\nmoney. The children went barefoot and bareheaded in all weathers, and\r\nshared the parents' toil and their anxiety over the rents. At thirteen\r\nBobby, the eldest, was doing a peasant's full day's labor; at sixteen he\r\nwas chief laborer on his father's farm; and he describes the life as \"the\r\ncheerless gloom of a hermit, and the unceasing moil of a galley slave.\" In\r\n1784 the father, after a lifetime of toil, was saved from a debtor's prison\r\nby consumption and death. To rescue something from the wreck of the home,\r\nand to win a poor chance of bread for the family, the two older boys set up\r\na claim for arrears of wages that had never been paid. With the small sum\r\nallowed them, they buried their father, took another farm, Mossgiel, in\r\nMauchline, and began again the long struggle with poverty.\r\n\r\nSuch, in outline, is Burns's own story of his early life, taken mostly from\r\nhis letters. There is another and more pleasing side to the picture, of\r\nwhich we have glimpses in his poems and in his Common-place Book. Here we\r\nsee the boy at school; for like most Scotch peasants, the father gave his\r\nboys the best education he possibly could. We see him following the plow,\r\nnot like a slave, but like a free man, crooning over an old Scotch song and\r\nmaking a better one to match the melody. We see him stop the plow to listen\r\nto what the wind is saying, or turn aside lest he disturb the birds at\r\ntheir singing and nest making. At supper we see the family about the table,\r\nhappy notwithstanding their scant fare, each child with a spoon in one hand\r\nand a book in the other. We hear Betty Davidson reciting, from her great\r\nstore, some heroic ballad that fired the young hearts to enthusiasm and\r\nmade them forget the day's toil. And in \"The Cotter's Saturday Night\" we\r\nhave a glimpse of Scotch peasant life that makes us almost reverence these\r\nheroic men and women, who kept their faith and their self-respect in the\r\nface of poverty, and whose hearts, under their rough exteriors, were tender\r\nand true as steel.\r\n\r\nA most unfortunate change in Burns's life began when he left the farm, at\r\nseventeen, and went to Kirkoswald to study surveying. The town was the\r\nhaunt of smugglers, rough-living, hard-drinking men; and Burns speedily\r\nfound his way into those scenes of \"riot and roaring dissipation\" which\r\nwere his bane ever afterwards. For a little while he studied diligently,\r\nbut one day, while taking the altitude of the sun, he saw a pretty girl in\r\nthe neighboring garden, and love put trigonometry to flight. Soon he gave\r\nup his work and wandered back to the farm and poverty again.\r\n\r\nWhen twenty-seven years of age Burns first attracted literary attention,\r\nand in the same moment sprang to the first place in Scottish letters. In\r\ndespair over his poverty and personal habits, he resolved to emigrate to\r\nJamaica, and gathered together a few of his early poems, hoping to sell\r\nthem for enough to pay the expenses of his journey. The result was the\r\nfamous Kilmarnock edition of Burns, published in 1786, for which he was\r\noffered twenty pounds. It is said that he even bought his ticket, and on\r\nthe night before the ship sailed wrote his \"Farewell to Scotland,\"\r\nbeginning, \"The gloomy night is gathering fast,\" which he intended to be\r\nhis last song on Scottish soil.\r\n\r\nIn the morning he changed his mind, led partly by some dim foreshadowing of\r\nthe result of his literary adventure; for the little book took all Scotland\r\nby storm. Not only scholars and literary men, but \"even plowboys and maid\r\nservants,\" says a contemporary, eagerly spent their hard-earned shillings\r\nfor the new book. Instead of going to Jamaica, the young poet hurried to\r\nEdinburgh to arrange for another edition of his work. His journey was a\r\nconstant ovation, and in the capital he was welcomed and feasted by the\r\nbest of Scottish society. This inexpected triumph lasted only one winter.\r\nBurns's fondness for taverns and riotous living shocked his cultured\r\nentertainers, and when he returned to Edinburgh next winter, after a\r\npleasure jaunt through the Highlands, he received scant attention. He left\r\nthe city in anger and disappointment, and went back to the soil where he\r\nwas more at home.\r\n\r\nThe last few years of Burns's life are a sad tragedy, and we pass over them\r\nhurriedly. He bought the farm Ellisland, Dumfriesshire, and married the\r\nfaithful Jean Armour, in 1788, That he could write of her,\r\n\r\n    I see her in the dewy flowers,\r\n    I see her sweet and fair;\r\n    I hear her in the tunefu' birds,\r\n    I hear her charm the air:\r\n    There's not a bonie flower that springs\r\n    By fountain, shaw, or green;\r\n    There's not a bonie bird that sings,\r\n    But minds me o' my Jean,\r\n\r\nis enough for us to remember. The next year he was appointed exciseman,\r\ni.e. collector of liquor revenues, and the small salary, with the return\r\nfrom his poems, would have been sufficient to keep his family in modest\r\ncomfort, had he but kept away from taverns. For a few years his life of\r\nalternate toil and dissipation was occasionally illumined by his splendid\r\nlyric genius, and he produced many songs--\"Bonnie Doon,\" \"My Love's like a\r\nRed, Red Rose,\" \"Auld Lang Syne,\" \"Highland Mary,\" and the soul-stirring\r\n\"Scots wha hae,\" composed while galloping over the moor in a storm--which\r\nhave made the name of Burns known wherever the English language is spoken,\r\nand honored wherever Scotchmen gather together. He died miserably in 1796,\r\nwhen only thirty-seven years old. His last letter was an appeal to a friend\r\nfor money to stave off the bailiff, and one of his last poems a tribute to\r\nJessie Lewars, a kind lassie who helped to care for him in his illness.\r\nThis last exquisite lyric, \"O wert thou in the cauld blast,\" set to\r\nMendelssohn's music, is one of our best known songs, though its history is\r\nseldom suspected by those who sing it.\r\n\r\nTHE POETRY OF BURNS. The publication of the Kilmarnock Burns, with the\r\ntitle _Poems Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect_ (1786), marks an epoch in the\r\nhistory of English Literature, like the publication of Spenser's\r\n_Shepherd's Calendar_. After a century of cold and formal poetry, relieved\r\nonly by the romanticism of Gray and Cowper, these fresh inspired songs went\r\nstraight to the heart, like the music of returning birds in springtime. It\r\nwas a little volume, but a great book; and we think of Marlowe's line,\r\n\"Infinite riches in a little room,\" in connection with it. Such poems as\r\n\"The Cotter's Saturday Night,\" \"To a Mouse,\" \"To Mountain Daisy,\" \"Man was\r\nMade To Mourn,\" \"The Twa Dogs,\" \"Address to the Deil,\" and \"Halloween,\"\r\nsuggest that the whole spirit of the romantic revival is embodied in this\r\nobscure plowman. Love, humor, pathos, the response to nature,--all the\r\npoetic qualities that touch the human heart are here; and the heart was\r\ntouched as it had not been since the days of Elizabeth. If the reader will\r\nnote again the six characteristics of the romantic movement, and then read\r\nsix poems of Burns, he will see at once how perfectly this one man\r\nexpresses the new idea. Or take a single suggestion,--\r\n\r\n    Ae fond kiss, and then we sever!\r\n    Ae farewell, and then forever!\r\n    Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee,\r\n    Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee.\r\n    Who shall say that Fortune grieves him\r\n    While the star of hope she leaves him?\r\n    Me, nae cheerfu' twinkle lights me;\r\n    Dark despair around benights me.\r\n    I'll ne'er blame my partial fancy,\r\n    Naething could resist my Nancy;\r\n    But to see her was to love her;\r\n    Love but her, and love forever.\r\n    Had we never lov'd sae kindly,\r\n    Had we never lov'd sae blindly,\r\n    Never met--or never parted--\r\n    We had ne'er been broken-hearted.\r\n\r\nThe \"essence of a thousand love tales\" is in that one little song. Because\r\nhe embodies the new spirit of romanticism, critics give him a high place in\r\nthe history of our literature; and because his songs go straight to the\r\nheart, he is the poet of common men.\r\n\r\nOf Burns's many songs for music little need be said. They have found their\r\nway into the hearts of a whole people, and there they speak for themselves.\r\nThey range from the exquisite \"O wert thou in the cauld blast,\" to the\r\ntremendous appeal to Scottish patriotism in \"Scots wha hae wi' Wallace\r\nbled,\" which, Carlyle said, should be sung with the throat of the\r\nwhirlwind. Many of these songs were composed in his best days, when\r\nfollowing the plow or resting after his work, while the music of some old\r\nScotch song was ringing in his head. It is largely because he thought of\r\nmusic while he composed that so many of his poems have the singing quality,\r\nsuggesting a melody as we read them.\r\n\r\nAmong his poems of nature, \"To a Mouse\" and \"To a Mountain Daisy\" are\r\nunquestionably the best, suggesting the poetical possibilities that daily\r\npass unnoticed under our feet. These two poems are as near as Burns ever\r\ncomes to appreciating nature for its own sake. The majority of his poems,\r\nlike \"Winter\" and \"Ye banks and braes o' bonie Doon,\" regard nature in the\r\nsame way that Gray regarded it, as a background for the play of human\r\nemotions.\r\n\r\nOf his poems of emotion there is an immense number. It is a curious fact\r\nthat the world is always laughing and crying at the same moment; and we can\r\nhardly read a page of Burns without finding this natural juxtaposition of\r\nsmiles and tears. It is noteworthy also that all strong emotions, when\r\nexpressed naturally, lend themselves to poetry; and Burns, more than any\r\nother writer, has an astonishing faculty of describing his own emotions\r\nwith vividness and simplicity, so that they appeal instantly to our own.\r\nOne cannot read, \"I love my Jean,\" for instance, without being in love with\r\nsome idealized woman; or \"To Mary in Heaven,\" without sharing the personal\r\ngrief of one who has loved and lost.\r\n\r\nBesides the songs of nature and of human emotion, Burns has given us a\r\nlarge number of poems for which no general title can be given. Noteworthy\r\namong these are \"A man's a man for a' that,\" which voices the new romantic\r\nestimate of humanity; \"The Vision,\" from which we get a strong impression\r\nof Burns's early ideals; the \"Epistle to a Young Friend,\" from which,\r\nrather than from his satires, we learn Burns's personal views of religion\r\nand honor; the \"Address to the Unco Guid,\" which is the poet's plea for\r\nmercy in judgment; and \"A Bard's Epitaph,\" which, as a summary of his own\r\nlife, might well be written at the end of his poems. \"Halloween,\" a picture\r\nof rustic merrymaking, and \"The Twa Dogs\" a contrast between the rich and\r\npoor, are generally classed among the poet's best works; but one unfamiliar\r\nwith the Scotch dialect will find them rather difficult.\r\n\r\nOf Burns's longer poems the two best worth reading are \"The Cotter's\r\nSaturday Night\" and \"Tam o' Shanter,\"--the one giving the most perfect\r\npicture we possess of a noble poverty; the other being the most lively and\r\nthe least objectionable of his humorous works. It would be difficult to\r\nfind elsewhere such a combination of the grewsome and the ridiculous as is\r\npacked up in \"Tam o' Shanter.\" With the exception of these two, the longer\r\npoems add little to the author's fame or to our own enjoyment. It is better\r\nfor the beginner to read Burns's exquisite songs and gladly to recognize\r\nhis place in the hearts of a people, and forget the rest, since they only\r\nsadden us and obscure the poet's better nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BLAKE (1757-1827)\r\n\r\n    Piping down the valleys wild,\r\n      Piping songs of pleasant glee,\r\n    On a cloud I saw a child,\r\n      And he laughing said to me:\r\n    \"Pipe a song about a lamb;\"\r\n      So I piped with merry cheer.\r\n    \"Piper, pipe that song again;\"\r\n      So I piped:, he wept to hear.\r\n    \"Piper, sit thee down and write\r\n      In a book, that all may read;\"\r\n    So he vanished from my sight,\r\n      And I plucked a hollow reed,\r\n    And I made a rural pen,\r\n      And I stained the water clear,\r\n    And I wrote my happy songs\r\n      Every child may joy to hear.[206]\r\n\r\nOf all the romantic poets of the eighteenth century, Blake is the most\r\nindependent and the most original. In his earliest work, written when he\r\nwas scarcely more than a child, he seems to go back to the Elizabethan song\r\nwriters for his models; but for the greater part of his life he was the\r\npoet of inspiration alone, following no man's lead, and obeying no voice\r\nbut that which he heard in his own mystic soul. Though the most\r\nextraordinary literary genius of his age, he had practically no influence\r\nupon it. Indeed, we hardly yet understand this poet of pure fancy, this\r\nmystic this transcendental madman, who remained to the end of his busy life\r\nan incomprehensible child.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Blake, the son of a London tradesman, was a strange, imaginative\r\nchild, whose soul was more at home with brooks and flowers and fairies than\r\nwith the crowd of the city streets. Beyond learning to read and write, he\r\nreceived education; but he began, at ten years, to copy prints and to write\r\nverses. He also began a long course of art study, which resulted in his\r\npublishing his own books, adorned with marginal engravings colored by\r\nhand,--an unusual setting, worthy of the strong artistic sense that shows\r\nitself in many of his early verses. As a child he had visions of God and\r\nthe angels looking in at his window; and as a man he thought he received\r\nvisits from the souls of the great dead, Moses, Virgil, Homer, Dante,\r\nMilton,--\"majestic shadows, gray but luminous,\" he calls them. He seems\r\nnever to have asked himself the question how far these visions were pure\r\nillusions, but believed and trusted them implicitly. To him all nature was\r\na vast spiritual symbolism, wherein he saw elves, fairies, devils,\r\nangels,--all looking at him in friendship or enmity through the eyes of\r\nflowers and stars:\r\n\r\n    With the blue sky spread over with wings,\r\n      And the mild sun that mounts and sings;\r\n    With trees and fields full of fairy elves,\r\n      And little devils who fight for themselves;\r\n    With angels planted in hawthorne bowers,\r\n      And God himself in the passing hours.\r\n\r\nAnd this curious, pantheistic conception of nature was not a matter of\r\ncreed, but the very essence of Blake's life. Strangely enough, he made no\r\nattempt to found a new religious cult, but followed his own way, singing\r\ncheerfully, working patiently, in the face of discouragement and failure.\r\nThat writers of far less genius were exalted to favor, while he remained\r\npoor and obscure, does not seem to have troubled him in the least. For over\r\nforty years he labored diligently at book engraving, guided in his art by\r\nMichael Angelo. but inventing his own curious designs, at which we still\r\nwonder. The illustrations for Young's \"Night Thoughts,\" for Blair's\r\n\"Grave,\" and the \"Inventions to the Book of Job,\" show the peculiarity of\r\nBlake's mind quite as clearly as his poems. While he worked at his trade he\r\nflung off--for he never seemed to compose--disjointed visions and\r\nincomprehensible rhapsodies, with an occasional little gem that still sets\r\nour hearts to singing:\r\n\r\n    Ah, sunflower, weary of time,\r\n      Who countest the steps of the sun;\r\n    Seeking after that sweet golden clime\r\n      Where the traveller's journey is done;\r\n    Where the youth pined away with desire,\r\n      And the pale virgin shrouded in snow,\r\n    Rise from their graves, and aspire\r\n      Where my sunflower wishes to go!\r\n\r\nThat is a curious flower to find growing in the London street; but it\r\nsuggests Blake's own life, which was outwardly busy and quiet, but inwardly\r\nfull of adventure and excitement. His last huge prophetic works, like\r\n_Jerusalem_ and _Milton_ (1804), were dictated to him, he declares, by\r\nsupernatural means, and even against his own will. They are only half\r\nintelligible, but here and there one sees flashes of the same poetic beauty\r\nthat marks his little poems. Critics generally dismiss Blake with the word\r\n\"madman\"; but that is only an evasion. At best, he is the writer of\r\nexquisite lyrics; at worst, he is mad only \"north-northwest,\" like Hamlet;\r\nand the puzzle is to find the method in his madness. The most amazing thing\r\nabout him is the perfectly sane and cheerful way in which he moved through\r\npoverty and obscurity, flinging out exquisite poems or senseless\r\nrhapsodies, as a child might play with gems or straws or sunbeams\r\nindifferently. He was a gentle, kindly, most unworldly little man, with\r\nextraordinary eyes, which seem even in the lifeless portraits to reflect\r\nsome unusual hypnotic power. He died obscurely, smiling at a vision of\r\nParadise, in 1827. That was nearly a century ago, yet he still remains one\r\nof the most incomprehensible figures in our literature.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF BLAKE. The _Poetical Sketches_, published in 1783, is a collection\r\nof Blake's earliest poetry, much of it written in boyhood. It contains much\r\ncrude and incoherent work, but also a few lyrics of striking originality.\r\nTwo later and better known volumes are _Songs of Innocence_ and _Songs of\r\nExperience_, reflecting two widely different views of the human soul. As in\r\nall his works, there is an abundance of apparently worthless stuff in these\r\nsongs; but, in the language of miners, it is all \"pay dirt\"; it shows\r\ngleams of golden grains that await our sifting, and now and then we find a\r\nnugget unexpectedly:\r\n\r\n    My lord was like a flower upon the brows\r\n    Of lusty May; ah life as frail as flower!\r\n    My lord was like a star in highest heaven\r\n    Drawn down to earth by spells and wickedness;\r\n    My lord was like the opening eye of day;\r\n    But he is darkened; like the summer moon\r\n    Clouded; fall'n like the stately tree, cut down;\r\n    The breath of heaven dwelt among his leaves.\r\n\r\nOn account of the chaotic character of most of Blake's work, it is well to\r\nbegin our reading with a short book of selections, containing the best\r\nsongs of these three little volumes. Swinburne calls Blake the only poet of\r\n\"supreme and simple poetic genius\" of the eighteenth century, the one man\r\nof that age fit, on all accounts, to rank with the old great masters.[207]\r\nThe praise is doubtless extravagant, and the criticism somewhat\r\nintemperate; but when we have read \"The Evening Star,\" \"Memory,\" \"Night,\"\r\n\"Love,\" \"To the Muses,\" \"Spring,\" \"Summer,\" \"The Tiger,\" \"The Lamb,\" \"The\r\nClod and the Pebble,\" we may possibly share Swinburne's enthusiasm.\r\nCertainly, in these three volumes we have some of the most perfect and the\r\nmost original songs in our language.\r\n\r\nOf Blake's longer poems, his titanic prophecies and apocalyptic splendors,\r\nit is impossible to write justly in such a brief work as this. Outwardly\r\nthey suggest a huge chaff pile, and the scattered grains of wheat hardly\r\nwarrant the labor of winnowing. The curious reader will get an idea of\r\nBlake's amazing mysticism by dipping into any of the works of his middle\r\nlife,--_Urizen, Gates of Paradise, Marriage of Heaven and Hell, America,\r\nThe French Revolution_, or _The Vision of the Daughters of Albion_. His\r\nlatest works, like _Jerusalem_ and _Milton_, are too obscure to have any\r\nliterary value. To read any of these works casually is to call the author a\r\nmadman; to study them, remembering Blake's songs and his genius, is to\r\nquote softly his own answer to the child who asked about the land of\r\ndreams:\r\n\r\n    \"O what land is the land of dreams,\r\n    What are its mountains and what are its streams?\r\n    --O father, I saw my mother there,\r\n    Among the lilies by waters fair.\"\r\n    \"Dear child, I also by pleasant streams\r\n    Have wandered all night in the land of dreams;\r\n    But though calm and warm the waters wide,\r\n    I could not get to the other side.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR POETS OF THE REVIVAL\r\n\r\nWe have chosen the five preceding poets, Gray, Goldsmith, Cowper, Burns,\r\nand Blake, as the most typical and the most interesting of the writers who\r\nproclaimed the dawn of Romanticism in the eighteenth century. With them we\r\nassociate a group of minor writers, whose works were immensely popular in\r\ntheir own day. The ordinary reader will pass them by, but to the student\r\nthey are all significant as expressions of very different phases of the\r\nromantic revival.\r\n\r\nJAMES THOMSON (1700-1748). Thomson belongs among the pioneers of\r\nRomanticism. Like Gray and Goldsmith, he wavered between Pseudo-classic and\r\nthe new romantic ideals, and for this reason, if for no other, his early\r\nwork is interesting, like the uncertainty of a child who hesitates whether\r\nto creep safely on all fours or risk a fall by walking. He is \"worthy to be\r\nremembered\" for three poems,--\"Rule Britannia,\" which is still one of the\r\nnational songs of England _The Castle of Indolence_, and _The Seasons_. The\r\ndreamy and romantic _Castle_ (1748), occupied by enchanter Indolence and\r\nhis willing captives in the land of Drowsyhed, is purely Spenserian in its\r\nimagery, and is written in the Spenserian stanza. _The Seasons_ (1726-\r\n1730), written in blank verse, describes the sights and sounds of the\r\nchanging year and the poet's own feelings in the presence of nature. These\r\ntwo poems, though rather dull to a modern reader, were significant of the\r\nearly romantic revival in three ways: they abandoned the prevailing heroic\r\ncouplet; they went back to the Elizabethans, instead of to Pope, for their\r\nmodels; and they called attention to the long-neglected life of nature as a\r\nsubject for poetry.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM COLLINS (1721-1759). Collins, the friend and disciple of Thomson,\r\nwas of a delicate, nervous temperament, like Cowper; and over him also\r\nbrooded the awful shadow of insanity. His first work, _Oriental Eclogues_\r\n(1742), is romantic in feeling, but is written in the prevailing mechanical\r\ncouplets. All his later work is romantic in both thought and expression.\r\nHis \"Ode on the Popular Superstitions of the Highlands\" (1750) is an\r\ninteresting event in the romantic revival, for it introduced a new world,\r\nof witches, pygmies, fairies, and mediæval kings, for the imagination to\r\nplay in. Collins's best known poems are the odes \"To Simplicity,\" \"To\r\nFear,\" \"To the Passions,\" the little unnamed lyric beginning \"How sleep the\r\nbrave,\" and the exquisite \"Ode to Evening.\" In reading the latter, one is\r\nscarcely aware that the lines are so delicately balanced that they have no\r\nneed of rime to accentuate their melody.\r\n\r\nGEORGE CRABBE (1754-1832). Crabbe is an interesting combination of realism\r\nand romanticism, his work of depicting common life being, at times, vaguely\r\nsuggestive of Fielding's novels. _The Village_ (1783), a poem without a\r\nrival as a picture of the workingmen of his age, is sometimes like Fielding\r\nin its coarse vigor, and again like Dryden in its precise versification.\r\nThe poem was not successful at first, and Crabbe abandoned his literary\r\ndreams. For over twenty years he settled down as a clergyman in a country\r\nparish, observing keenly the common life about him. Then he published more\r\npoems, exactly like _The Village_, which immediately brought him fame and\r\nmoney. They brought him also the friendship of Walter Scott, who, like\r\nothers, regarded Crabbe as one of the first poets of the age. These later\r\npoems, _The Parish Register_ (1807), _The Borough_ (1810), _Tales in Verse_\r\n(1812), and _Tales of the Hall_ (1819), are in the same strain. They are\r\nwritten in couplets; they are reflections of nature and of country life;\r\nthey contain much that is sordid and dull, but are nevertheless real\r\npictures of real men and women, just as Crabbe saw them, and as such they\r\nare still interesting. Goldsmith and Burns had idealized the poor, and we\r\nadmire them for their sympathy and insight. It remained for Crabbe to show\r\nthat in wretched fishing villages, in the lives of hardworking men and\r\nwomen, children, laborers, smugglers, paupers,--all sorts and conditions\r\nof common men,--there is abundant romantic without exaggerating or\r\nidealizing their vices and virtues.\r\n\r\nJAMES MACPHERSON (1736-1796). In Macpherson we have an unusual figure, who\r\ncatered to the new romantic interest in the old epic heroes, and won\r\nimmense though momentary fame, by a series of literary forgeries.\r\nMacpherson was a Scotch schoolmaster, an educated man, but evidently not\r\nover-tender of conscience, whose imagination had been stirred by certain\r\nold poems which he may have heard in Gaelic among the Highlanders. In 1760\r\nhe published his _Fragments of Ancient Poetry collected in the Highlands_,\r\nand alleged that his work was but a translation of Gaelic manuscripts.\r\nWhether the work of itself would have attracted attention is doubtful; but\r\nthe fact that an abundance of literary material might be awaiting discovery\r\nled to an interest such as now attends the opening of an Egyptian tomb, and\r\na subscription was promptly raised in Edinburgh to send Macpherson through\r\nthe Highlands to collect more \"manuscripts.\" The result was the epic\r\n_Fingal_ (1762), \"that lank and lamentable counterfeit of poetry,\" as\r\nSwinburne calls it, which the author professed to have translated from the\r\nGaelic of the poet Ossian. Its success was astonishing, and Macpherson\r\nfollowed it up with _Temora_ (1763), another epic in the same strain. In\r\nboth these works Macpherson succeeds in giving an air of primal grandeur to\r\nhis heroes; the characters are big and shadowy; the imagery is at times\r\nmagnificent; the language is a kind of chanting, bombastic prose:\r\n\r\nNow Fingal arose in his might and thrice he reared his voice. Cromla\r\nanswered around, and the sons of the desert stood still. They bent their\r\nred faces to earth, ashamed at the presence of Fingal. He came like a cloud\r\nof rain in the days of the sun, when slow it rolls on the hill, and fields\r\nexpect the shower. Swaran beheld the terrible king of Morven, and stopped\r\nin the midst of his course. Dark he leaned on his spear rolling his red\r\neyes around. Silent and tall he seemed as an oak on the banks of Lubar,\r\nwhich had its branches blasted of old by the lightning of heaven. His\r\nthousands pour around the hero, and the darkness of battle gathers on the\r\nhill.[208]\r\n\r\nThe publication of this gloomy, imaginative work produced a literary storm.\r\nA few critics, led by Dr. Johnson, demanded to see the original\r\nmanuscripts, and when Macpherson refused to produce them,[209] the Ossianic\r\npoems were branded as a forgery; nevertheless they had enormous success.\r\nMacpherson was honored as a literary explorer; he was given an official\r\nposition, carrying a salary for life; and at his death, in 1796, he was\r\nburied in Westminster Abbey. Blake, Burns, and indeed most of the poets of\r\nthe age were influenced by this sham poetry. Even the scholarly Gray was\r\ndeceived and delighted with \"Ossian\"; and men as far apart as Goethe and\r\nNapoleon praised it immoderately.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS CHATTERTON (1752-1770). This \"marvelous boy,\" to whom Keats\r\ndedicated his \"Endymion,\" and who is celebrated in Shelley's \"Adonais,\" is\r\none of the saddest and most interesting figures of the romantic revival.\r\nDuring his childhood he haunted the old church of St. Mary Redcliffe, in\r\nBristol, where he was fascinated by the mediæval air of the place, and\r\nespecially by one old chest, known as Canynge's coffer, containing musty\r\ndocuments which had been preserved for three hundred years. With strange,\r\nuncanny intentness the child pored over these relics of the past, copying\r\nthem instead of his writing book, until he could imitate not only the\r\nspelling and language but even the handwriting of the original. Soon after\r\nthe \"Ossian\" forgeries appeared, Chatterton began to produce documents,\r\napparently very old, containing mediæval poems, legends, and family\r\nhistories, centering around two characters,--Thomas Rowley, priest and\r\npoet, and William Canynge, merchant of Bristol in the days of Henry VI. It\r\nseems incredible that the whole design of these mediæval romances should\r\nhave been worked out by a child of eleven, and that he could reproduce the\r\nstyle and the writing of Caxton's day so well that the printers were\r\ndeceived; but such is the fact. More and more _Rowley Papers_, as they were\r\ncalled, were produced by Chatterton,--apparently from the archives of the\r\nold church; in reality from his own imagination,--delighting a large circle\r\nof readers, and deceiving all but Gray and a few scholars who recognized\r\nthe occasional misuse of fifteenth-century English words. All this work was\r\ncarefully finished, and bore the unmistakable stamp of literary genius.\r\nReading now his \"Ælla,\" or the \"Ballad of Charite,\" or the long poem in\r\nballad style called \"Bristowe Tragedie,\" it is hard to realize that it is a\r\nboy's work. At seventeen years of age Chatterton went for a literary career\r\nto London, where he soon afterwards took poison and killed himself in a fit\r\nof childish despondency, brought on by poverty and hunger.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS PERCY (1729-1811). To Percy, bishop of the Irish church, in Dromore,\r\nwe are indebted for the first attempt at a systematic collection of the\r\nfolk songs and ballads which are counted among the treasures of a nation's\r\nliterature.[210] In 1765 he published, in three volumes, his famous\r\n_Reliques of Ancient English Poetry_. The most valuable part of this work\r\nis the remarkable collection of old English and Scottish Ballads, such as\r\n\"Chevy Chase,\" the \"Nut Brown Mayde,\" \"Children of the Wood,\" \"Battle of\r\nOtterburn,\" and many more, which but for his labor might easily have\r\nperished. We have now much better and more reliable editions of these same\r\nballads; for Percy garbled his materials, adding and subtracting freely,\r\nand even inventing a few ballads of his own. Two motives probably\r\ninfluenced him in this. First, the different versions of the same ballad\r\nvaried greatly; and Percy, in changing them to suit himself, took the same\r\nliberty as had many other writers in dealing with the same material.\r\nSecond; Percy was under the influence of Johnson and his school, and\r\nthought it necessary to add a few elegant ballads \"to atone for the\r\nrudeness of the more obsolete poems.\" That sounds queer now, used as we are\r\nto exactness in dealing with historical and literary material; but it\r\nexpresses the general spirit of the age in which he lived.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these drawbacks, Percy's _Reliques_ marks an epoch in the\r\nhistory of Romanticism, and it is difficult to measure its influence on the\r\nwhole romantic movement. Scott says of it, \"The first time I could scrape a\r\nfew shillings together, I bought myself a copy of these beloved volumes;\r\nnor do I believe I ever read a book half so frequently, or with half the\r\nenthusiasm.\" Scott's own poetry is strongly modeled upon these early\r\nballads, and his _Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border_ is due chiefly to the\r\ninfluence of Percy's work.\r\n\r\nBesides the _Reliques_, Percy has given us another good work in his\r\n_Northern Antiquities_ (1770) translated from the French of Mallet's\r\n_History of Denmark_. This also was of immense influence, since it\r\nintroduced to English readers a new and fascinating mythology, more rugged\r\nand primitive than that of the Greeks; and we are still, in music as in\r\nletters, under the spell of Thor and Odin, of Frea and the Valkyr maidens,\r\nand of that stupendous drama of passion and tragedy which ended in the\r\n\"Twilight of the Gods.\" The literary world owes a debt of gratitude to\r\nPercy, who wrote nothing of importance himself, but who, by collecting and\r\ntranslating the works of other men, did much to hasten the triumph of\r\nRomanticism in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE FIRST ENGLISH NOVELISTS\r\n\r\nThe chief literary phenomena of the complex eighteenth century are the\r\nreign of so-called Classicism, the revival of romantic poetry, and the\r\ndiscovery of the modern novel. Of these three, the last is probably the\r\nmost important. Aside from the fact that the novel is the most modern, and\r\nat present the most widely read and influential type of literature, we have\r\na certain pride in regarding it as England's original contribution to the\r\nworld of letters. Other great types of literature, like the epic, the\r\nromance, and the drama, were first produced by other nations; but the idea\r\nof the modern novel seems to have been worked out largely on English\r\nsoil;[211] and in the number and the fine quality of her novelists, England\r\nhas hardly been rivaled by any other nation. Before we study the writers\r\nwho developed this new type of literature, it is well to consider briefly\r\nits meaning and history.\r\n\r\nMEANING OF THE NOVEL. Probably the most significant remark made by the\r\nordinary reader concerning a work of fiction takes the form of a question:\r\nIs it a good story? For the reader of to-day is much like the child and the\r\nprimitive man in this respect, that he must be attracted and held by the\r\nstory element of a narrative before he learns to appreciate its style or\r\nmoral significance. The story element is therefore essential to the novel;\r\nbut where the story originates is impossible to say. As well might we seek\r\nfor the origin of the race; for wherever primitive men are found, there we\r\nsee them gathering eagerly about the story-teller. In the halls of our\r\nSaxon ancestors the scop and the tale-bringer were ever the most welcome\r\nguests; and in the bark wigwams of the American Indians the man who told\r\nthe legends of Hiawatha had an audience quite as attentive as that which\r\ngathered at the Greek festivals to hear the story of Ulysses's wanderings.\r\nTo man's instinct or innate love for a story we are indebted for all our\r\nliterature; and the novel must in some degree satisfy this instinct, or\r\nfail of appreciation.\r\n\r\nThe second question which we ask concerning a work of fiction is, How far\r\ndoes the element of imagination enter into it? For upon the element of\r\nimagination depends, largely, our classification of works of fiction into\r\nnovels, romances, and mere adventure stories. The divisions here are as\r\nindefinite as the border land between childhood and youth, between instinct\r\nand reason; but there are certain principles to guide us. We note, in the\r\ndevelopment of any normal child, that there comes a time when for his\r\nstories he desires knights, giants, elves, fairies, witches, magic, and\r\nmarvelous adventures which have no basis in experience. He tells\r\nextraordinary tales about himself, which may be only the vague remembrances\r\nof a dream or the creations of a dawning imagination,--both of which are as\r\nreal to him as any other part of life. When we say that such a child\r\n\"romances,\" we give exactly the right name to it; for this sudden interest\r\nin extraordinary beings and events marks the development of the human\r\nimagination,--running riot at first, because it is not guided by reason,\r\nwhich is a later development,--and to satisfy this new interest the\r\nromance[212] was invented. The romance is, originally, a work of fiction in\r\nwhich the imagination is given full play without being limited by facts or\r\nprobabilities. It deals with extraordinary events, with heroes whose powers\r\nare exaggerated, and often adds the element of superhuman or supernatural\r\ncharacters. It is impossible to draw the line where romance ends; but this\r\nelement of excessive imagination and of impossible heroes and incidents is\r\nits distinguishing mark in every literature.\r\n\r\nWhere the novel begins it is likewise impossible to say; but again we have\r\na suggestion in the experience of every reader. There comes a time,\r\nnaturally and inevitably, in the life of every youth when the romance no\r\nlonger enthralls him. He lives in a world of facts; gets acquainted with\r\nmen and women, some good, some bad, but all human; and he demands that\r\nliterature shall express life as he knows it by experience. This is the\r\nstage of the awakened intellect, and in our stories the intellect as well\r\nas the imagination must now be satisfied. At the beginning of this stage we\r\ndelight in _Robinson Crusoe;_ we read eagerly a multitude of adventure\r\nnarratives and a few so-called historical novels; but in each case we must\r\nbe lured by a story, must find heroes and \"moving accidents by flood and\r\nfield\" to appeal to our imagination; and though the hero and the adventure\r\nmay be exaggerated, they must both be natural and within the bounds of\r\nprobability. Gradually the element of adventure or surprising incident\r\ngrows less and less important, as we learn that true life is not\r\nadventurous, but a plain, heroic matter of work and duty, and the daily\r\nchoice between good and evil. Life is the most real thing in the world\r\nnow,--not the life of kings, or heroes, or superhuman creatures, but the\r\nindividual life with its struggles and temptations and triumphs or\r\nfailures, like our own; and any work that faithfully represents life\r\nbecomes interesting. So we drop the adventure story and turn to the novel.\r\nFor the novel is a work of fiction in which the imagination and the\r\nintellect combine to express life in the form of a story and the\r\nimagination is always directed and controlled by the intellect. It is\r\ninterested chiefly, not in romance or adventure, but in men and women as\r\nthey are; it aims to show the motives and influences which govern human\r\nlife, and the effects of personal choice upon character and destiny. Such\r\nis the true novel,[213] and as such it opens a wider and more interesting\r\nfield than any other type of literature.\r\n\r\nPRECURSORS OF THE NOVEL. Before the novel could reach its modern stage, of\r\na more or less sincere attempt to express human life and character, it had\r\nto pass through several centuries of almost imperceptible development.\r\nAmong the early precursors of the novel we must place a collection of tales\r\nknown as the Greek Romances, dating from the second to the sixth centuries.\r\nThese are imaginative and delightful stories of ideal love and marvelous\r\nadventure,[214] which profoundly affected romance writing for the next\r\nthousand years. A second group of predecessors is found in the Italian and\r\nSpanish pastoral romances, which were inspired by the _Eclogues_ of Virgil.\r\nThese were extremely popular in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and\r\ntheir influence is seen later in Sidney's _Arcadia_, which is the best of\r\nthis type in English.\r\n\r\nThe third and most influential group of predecessors of the novel is made\r\nup of the romances of chivalry, such as are found in Malory's _Morte\r\nd'Arthur_. It is noticeable, in reading these beautiful old romances in\r\ndifferent languages, that each nation changes them somewhat, so as to make\r\nthem more expressive of national traits and ideals. In a word, the old\r\nromance tends inevitably towards realism, especially in England, where the\r\nexcessive imagination is curbed and the heroes become more human. In\r\nMalory, in the unknown author of _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_, and\r\nespecially in Chaucer, we see the effect of the practical English mind in\r\ngiving these old romances a more natural setting, and in making the heroes\r\nsuggest, though faintly, the men and women of their own day. The\r\n_Canterbury Tales_, with their story interest and their characters\r\ndelightfully true to nature, have in them the suggestion, at least, of a\r\nconnected story whose chief aim is to reflect life as it is.\r\n\r\nIn the Elizabethan Age the idea of the novel grows more definite. In\r\nSidney's _Arcadia_ (1580), a romance of chivalry, the pastoral setting at\r\nleast is generally true to nature; our credulity is not taxed, as in the\r\nold romances, by the continual appearance of magic or miracles; and the\r\ncharacters, though idealized till they become tiresome, occasionally give\r\nthe impression of being real men and women. In Bacon's _The New Atlantis_\r\n(1627) we have the story of the discovery by mariners of an unknown\r\ncountry, inhabited by a superior race of men, more civilized than\r\nourselves,--an idea which had been used by More in his _Utopia_ in 1516.\r\nThese two books are neither romances nor novels, in the strict sense, but\r\nstudies of social institutions. They use the connected story as a means of\r\nteaching moral lessons, and of bringing about needed reforms; and this\r\nvaluable suggestion has been adopted by many of our modern writers in the\r\nso-called problem novels and novels of purpose.\r\n\r\nNearer to the true novel is Lodge's romantic story of _Rosalynde_, which\r\nwas used by Shakespeare in _As You Like It_. This was modeled upon the\r\nItalian novella, or short story, which became very popular in England\r\nduring the Elizabethan Age. In the same age we have introduced into England\r\nthe Spanish picaresque novel (from _picaro_, a knave or rascal), which at\r\nfirst was a kind of burlesque on the mediæval romance, and which took for\r\nits hero some low scoundrel or outcast, instead of a knight, and followed\r\nhim through a long career of scandals and villainies. One of the earliest\r\ntypes of this picaresque novel in English is Nash's _The Unfortunate\r\nTraveller, or the Life of Jack Wilton_ (1594), which is also a forerunner\r\nof the historical novel, since its action takes place during that gorgeous\r\ninterview between Henry VIII and the king of France on the Field of the\r\nCloth of Gold. In all these short stories and picaresque novels the\r\nemphasis was laid not so much on life and character as on the adventures of\r\nthe hero; and the interest consisted largely in wondering what would happen\r\nnext, and how the plot would end. The same method is employed in all trashy\r\nnovels and it is especially the bane of many modern story-writers. This\r\nexcessive interest in adventures or incidents for their own sake, and not\r\nfor their effect on character, is what distinguishes the modern adventure\r\nstory from the true novel.\r\n\r\nIn the Puritan Age we approach still nearer to the modern novel, especially\r\nin the work of Bunyan; and as the Puritan always laid emphasis on\r\ncharacter, stories appeared having a definite moral purpose. Bunyan's _The\r\nPilgrim's Progress_ (1678) differs from the _Faery Queen_, and from all\r\nother mediæval allegories, in this important respect,--that the characters,\r\nfar from being bloodless abstractions, are but thinly disguised men and\r\nwomen. Indeed, many a modern man, reading the story of the Christian;--has\r\nfound in it the reflection of his own life and experience. In _The Life and\r\nDeath of Mr. Badman_ (1682) we have another and even more realistic study\r\nof a man as he was in Bunyan's day. These two striking figures, Christian\r\nand Mr. Badman, belong among the great characters of English fiction.\r\nBunyan's good work,--his keen insight, his delineation of character, and\r\nhis emphasis upon the moral effects of individual action,--was carried on\r\nby Addison and Steele some thirty years later. The character of Sir Roger\r\nde Coverley is a real reflection of English country life in the eighteenth\r\ncentury; and with Steele's domestic sketches in _The Tatler, The\r\nSpectator_, and _The Guardian_ (1709-1713), we definitely cross the border\r\nland that lies outside of romance, and enter the region of character study\r\nwhere the novel has its beginning.\r\n\r\nTHE DISCOVERY OF THE MODERN NOVEL. Notwithstanding this long history of\r\nfiction, to which we have called attention, it is safe to say that, until\r\nthe publication of Richardson's _Pamela_ in 1740, no true novel had\r\nappeared in any literature. By a true novel we mean simply a work of\r\nfiction which relates the story of a plain human life, under stress of\r\nemotion, which depends for its interest not on incident or adventure, but\r\non its truth to nature. A number of English novelists--Goldsmith,\r\nRichardson, Fielding, Smollett, Sterne--all seem to have seized upon the\r\nidea of reflecting life as it is, in the form of a story, and to have\r\ndeveloped it simultaneously. The result was an extraordinary awakening of\r\ninterest, especially among people who had never before been greatly\r\nconcerned with literature. We are to remember that, in previous periods,\r\nthe number of readers was comparatively small; and that, with the exception\r\nof a few writers like Langland and Bunyan, authors wrote largely for the\r\nupper classes. In the eighteenth century the spread of education and the\r\nappearance of newspapers and magazines led to an immense increase in the\r\nnumber of readers; and at the same time the middle-class people assumed a\r\nforemost place in English life and history. These new readers and this new,\r\npowerful middle class had no classic tradition to hamper them. They cared\r\nlittle for the opinions of Dr. Johnson and the famous Literary Club; and,\r\nso far as they read fiction at all, they apparently took little interest in\r\nthe exaggerated romances, of impossible heroes and the picaresque stories\r\nof intrigue and villainy which had interested the upper classes. Some new\r\ntype of literature was demanded, this new type must express the new ideal\r\nof the eighteenth century, namely, the value and the importance of the\r\nindividual life. So the novel was born, expressing, though in a different\r\nway, exactly the same ideals of personality and of the dignity of common\r\nlife which were later proclaimed in the American and in the French\r\nRevolution, and were welcomed with rejoicing by the poets of the romantic\r\nrevival. To tell men, not about knights or kings or types of heroes, but\r\nabout themselves in the guise of plain men and women, about their own\r\nthoughts and motives and struggles, and the results of actions upon their\r\nown characters,--this was the purpose of our first novelists. The eagerness\r\nwith which their chapters were read in England, and the rapidity with which\r\ntheir work was copied abroad, show how powerfully the new discovery\r\nappealed to readers everywhere.\r\n\r\nBefore we consider the work of these writers who first developed the modern\r\nnovel, we must glance at the work of a pioneer, Daniel Defoe, whom we place\r\namong the early novelists for the simple reason that we do not know how\r\nelse to classify him.\r\n\r\n\r\nDANIEL DEFOE (1661(?)-1731)\r\n\r\nTo Defoe is often given the credit for the discovery of the modern novel;\r\nbut whether or not he deserves that honor is an open question. Even a\r\ncasual reading of _Robinson Crusoe_ (1719), which generally heads the list\r\nof modern fiction, shows that this exciting tale is largely an adventure\r\nstory, rather than the study of human character which Defoe probably\r\nintended it to be. Young people still read it as they might a dime novel,\r\nskipping its moralizing passages and hurrying on to more adventures; but\r\nthey seldom appreciate the excellent mature reasons which banish the dime\r\nnovel to a secret place in the haymow, while _Crusoe_ hangs proudly on the\r\nChristmas tree or holds an honored place on the family bookshelf. Defoe's\r\n_Apparition of Mrs. Veal, Memoirs of a Cavalier_, and _Journal of the\r\nPlague Year_ are such mixtures of fact, fiction, and credulity that they\r\ndefy classification; while other so-called \"novels,\" like _Captain\r\nSingleton, Moll Flanders_, and _Roxana_, are but, little better than\r\npicaresque stories, with a deal of unnatural moralizing and repentance\r\nadded for puritanical effect. In _Crusoe_, Defoe brought the realistic\r\nadventure story to a very high stage of its development; but his works\r\nhardly deserve, to be classed as true novels, which must subordinate\r\nincident to the faithful portrayal of human life and character.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Defoe was the son of a London butcher named Foe, and kept his family\r\nname until he was forty years of age, when he added the aristocratic prefix\r\nwith which we have grown familiar. The events of his busy seventy years of\r\nlife, in which he passed through all extremes, from poverty to wealth, from\r\nprosperous brickmaker to starveling journalist, from Newgate prison to\r\nimmense popularity and royal favor, are obscure enough in details; but four\r\nfacts stand out clearly, which help the reader to understand the character\r\nof his work. First, Defoe was a jack-at-all-trades, as well as a writer;\r\nhis interest was largely with the working classes, and notwithstanding many\r\nquestionable practices, he seems to have had some continued purpose of\r\neducating and uplifting the common people. This partially accounts for the\r\nenormous popularity of his works, and for the fact that they were\r\ncriticised by literary men as being \"fit only for the kitchen.\" Second, he\r\nwas a radical Nonconformist in religion, and was intended by his father for\r\nthe independent ministry. The Puritan zeal for reform possessed him, and he\r\ntried to do by his pen what Wesley was doing by his preaching, without,\r\nhowever, having any great measure of the latter's sincerity or singleness\r\nof purpose. This zeal for reform marks all his numerous works, and accounts\r\nfor the moralizing to be found everywhere. Third, Defoe was a journalist\r\nand pamphleteer, with a reporter's eye for the picturesque and a newspaper\r\nman's instinct for making a \"good story.\" He wrote an immense number of\r\npamphlets, poems, and magazine articles; conducted several papers,--one of\r\nthe most popular, the _Review_, being issued from prison,--and the fact\r\nthat they often blew hot and cold upon the same question was hardly\r\nnoticed. Indeed, so extraordinarily interesting and plausible were Defoe's\r\narticles that he generally managed to keep employed by the party in power,\r\nwhether Whig or Tory. This long journalistic career, lasting half a\r\ncentury, accounts for his direct, simple, narrative style, which holds us\r\neven now by its intense reality. To Defoe's genius we are also indebted for\r\ntwo discoveries, the \"interview\" and the leading editorial, both of which\r\nare still in daily use in our best newspapers.\r\n\r\nThe fourth fact to remember is that Defoe knew prison life; and thereby\r\nhangs a tale. In 1702 Defoe published a remarkable pamphlet called \"The\r\nShortest Way with the Dissenters,\" supporting the claims of the free\r\nchurches against the \"High Fliers,\" i.e. Tories and Anglicans. In a vein of\r\ngrim humor which recalls Swift's \"Modest Proposal,\" Defoe advocated hanging\r\nall dissenting ministers, and sending all members of the free churches into\r\nexile; and so ferociously realistic was the satire that both Dissenters and\r\nTories took the author literally. Defoe was tried, found guilty of\r\nseditious libel, and sentenced to be fined, to stand three days in the\r\npillory, and to be imprisoned. Hardly had the sentence been pronounced when\r\nDefoe wrote his \"Hymn to the Pillory,\"--\r\n\r\n    Hail hieroglyphic state machine,\r\n    Contrived to punish fancy in,--\r\n\r\na set of doggerel verses ridiculing his prosecutors, which Defoe, with a\r\nkeen eye for advertising, scattered all over London. Crowds flocked to\r\ncheer him in the pillory; and seeing that Defoe was making popularity out\r\nof persecution, his enemies bundled him off to Newgate prison. He turned\r\nthis experience also to account by publishing a popular newspaper, and by\r\ngetting acquainted with rogues, pirates, smugglers, and miscellaneous\r\noutcasts, each one with a \"good story\" to be used later. After his release\r\nfrom prison, in 1704, he turned his knowledge of criminals to further\r\naccount, and entered the government employ as a kind of spy or secret-\r\nservice agent. His prison experience, and the further knowledge of\r\ncriminals gained in over twenty years as a spy, accounts for his numerous\r\nstories of thieves and pirates, _Jonathan Wild_ and _Captain Avery_, and\r\nalso for his later novels, which deal almost exclusively with villains and\r\noutcasts.\r\n\r\nWhen Defoe was nearly sixty years of age he turned to fiction and wrote the\r\ngreat work by which he is remembered. _Robinson Crusoe_ was an instant\r\nsuccess, and the author became famous all over Europe. Other stories\r\nfollowed rapidly, and Defoe earned money enough to retire to Newington and\r\nlive in comfort; but not idly, for his activity in producing fiction is\r\nrivaled only by that of Walter Scott. Thus, in 1720 appeared _Captain\r\nSingleton, Duncan Campbell_, and _Memoirs of a Cavalier_; in 1722, _Colonel\r\nJack, Moll Flanders_, and the amazingly realistic _Journal of the Plague\r\nYear_. So the list grows with astonishing rapidity, ending with the\r\n_History of the Devil_ in 1726.\r\n\r\nIn the latter year Defoe's secret connection with the government became\r\nknown, and a great howl of indignation rose against him in the public\r\nprint, destroying in an hour the popularity which he had gained by a\r\nlifetime of intrigue and labor. He fled from his home to London, where he\r\ndied obscurely, in 1731, while hiding from real or imaginary enemies.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF DEFOE. At the head of the list stands _Robinson Crusoe_ (1719-\r\n1720), one of the few books in any literature which has held its popularity\r\nundiminished for nearly two centuries. The story is based upon the\r\nexperiences of Alexander Selkirk, or Selcraig, who had been marooned in the\r\nisland of Juan Fernandez, off the coast of Chile, and who had lived there\r\nin solitude for five years. On his return to England in 1709, Selkirk's\r\nexperiences became known, and Steele published an account of them in _The\r\nEnglishman_, without, however, attracting any wide attention. That Defoe\r\nused Selkirk's story is practically certain; but with his usual duplicity\r\nhe claimed to have written _Crusoe_ in 1708, a year before Selkirk's\r\nreturn. However that may be, the story itself is real enough to have come\r\nstraight from a sailor's logbook. Defoe, as shown in his _Journal of the\r\nPlague Year_ and his _Memoirs of a Cavalier_, had the art of describing\r\nthings he had never seen with the accuracy of an eyewitness.\r\n\r\nThe charm of the story is its intense reality, in the succession of\r\nthoughts, feelings, incidents, which every reader recognizes to be\r\nabsolutely true to life. At first glance it would seem that one man on a\r\ndesert island could not possibly furnish the material for a long story; but\r\nas we read we realize with amazement that every slightest thought and\r\naction--the saving of the cargo of the shipwrecked vessel, the preparation\r\nfor defense against imaginary foes, the intense agitation over the\r\ndiscovery of a footprint in the sand--is a record of what the reader\r\nhimself would do and feel if he were alone in such a place. Defoe's long\r\nand varied experience now stood him in good stead; in fact, he \"was the\r\nonly man of letters in his time who might have been thrown on a desert\r\nisland without finding himself at a loss what to do;\"[215] and he puts\r\nhimself so perfectly in his hero's place that he repeats his blunders as\r\nwell as his triumphs. Thus, what reader ever followed Defoe's hero through\r\nweary, feverish months of building a huge boat, which was too big to be\r\nlaunched by one man, without recalling some boy who spent many stormy days\r\nin shed or cellar building a boat or dog house, and who, when the thing was\r\npainted and finished, found it a foot wider than the door, and had to knock\r\nit to pieces? This absolute naturalness characterizes the whole story. It\r\nis a study of the human will also,--of patience, fortitude, and the\r\nindomitable Saxon spirit overcoming all obstacles; and it was this element\r\nwhich made Rousseau recommend _Robinson Crusoe_ as a better treatise on\r\neducation than anything which Aristotle or the moderns had ever written.\r\nAnd this suggests the most significant thing about Defoe's masterpiece,\r\nnamely, that the hero represents the whole of human society, doing with his\r\nown hands all the things which, by the division of labor and the demands of\r\nmodern civilization, are now done by many different workers. He is\r\ntherefore the type of the whole civilized race of men.\r\n\r\nIn the remaining works of Defoe, more than two hundred in number, there is\r\nan astonishing variety; but all are marked by the same simple, narrative\r\nstyle, and the same intense realism. The best known of these are the\r\n_Journal of the Plague Year_, in which the horrors of a frightful plague\r\nare minutely recorded; the _Memoirs of a Cavalier_, so realistic that\r\nChatham quoted it as history in Parliament; and several picaresque novels,\r\nlike _Captain Singleton, Colonel Jack, Moll Flanders_, and _Roxana_. The\r\nlast work is by some critics given a very high place in realistic fiction,\r\nbut like the other three, and like Defoe's minor narratives of Jack\r\nSheppard and Cartouche, it is a disagreeable study of vice, ending with a\r\nforced and unnatural repentance.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL RICHARDSON (1689-1761)\r\n\r\nTo Richardson belongs the credit of writing the first modern novel. He was\r\nthe son of a London joiner, who, for economy's sake, resided in some\r\nunknown town in Derbyshire, where Samuel was born in 1689. The boy received\r\nvery little education, but he had a natural talent for writing letters, and\r\neven as a boy we find him frequently employed by working girls to write\r\ntheir love letters for them. This early experience, together with his\r\nfondness for the society of \"his dearest ladies\" rather than of men, gave\r\nhim that intimate knowledge of the hearts of sentimental and uneducated\r\nwomen which is manifest in all his work. Moreover, he was a keen observer\r\nof manners, and his surprisingly accurate descriptions often compel us to\r\nlisten, even when he is most tedious. At seventeen years of age he went to\r\nLondon and learned the printer's trade, which he followed to the end of his\r\nlife. When fifty years of age he had a small reputation as a writer of\r\nelegant epistles, and this reputation led certain publishers to approach\r\nhim with a proposal that he write a series of _Familiar Letters_, which\r\ncould be used as models by people unused to writing. Richardson gladly\r\naccepted the proposal, and had the happy inspiration to make these letters\r\ntell the connected story of a girl's life. Defoe had told an adventure\r\nstory of human life on a desert island, but Richardson would tell the story\r\nof a girl's inner life in the midst of English neighbors. That sounds\r\nsimple enough now, but it marked an epoch in the history of literature.\r\nLike every other great and simple discovery, it makes us wonder why some\r\none had not thought of it before.\r\n\r\nRICHARDSON'S NOVELS. The result of Richardson's inspiration was _Pamela, or\r\nVirtue Rewarded_, an endless series of letters[216] telling of the trials,\r\ntribulations, and the final happy marriage of a too sweet young maiden,\r\npublished in four volumes extending over the years 1740 and 1741. Its chief\r\nfame lies in the fact that it is our first novel in the modern sense. Aside\r\nfrom this important fact, and viewed solely as a novel, it is sentimental,\r\ngrandiloquent, and wearisome. Its success at the time was enormous, and\r\nRichardson began another series of letters (he could tell a story in no\r\nother way) which occupied his leisure hours for the next six years. The\r\nresult was _Clarissa, or The History of a Young Lady_, published in eight\r\nvolumes in 1747-1748. This was another, and somewhat better, sentimental\r\nnovel; and it was received with immense enthusiasm. Of all Richardson's\r\nheroines Clarissa is the most human. In her doubts and scruples of\r\nconscience, and especially in her bitter grief and humiliation, she is a\r\nreal woman, in marked contrast with the mechanical hero, Lovelace, who\r\nsimply illustrates the author's inability to portray a man's character. The\r\ndramatic element in this novel is strong, and is increased by means of the\r\nletters, which enable the reader to keep close to the characters of the\r\nstory and to see life from their different view points. Macaulay, who was\r\ndeeply impressed by _Clarissa_, is said to have made the remark that, were\r\nthe novel lost, he could restore almost the whole of it from memory.\r\n\r\nRichardson now turned from his middle-class heroines, and in five or six\r\nyears completed another series of letters, in which he attempted to tell\r\nthe story of a man and an aristocrat. The result was _Sir Charles\r\nGrandison_ (1754), a novel in seven volumes, whose hero was intended to be\r\na model of aristocratic manners and virtues for the middle-class people,\r\nwho largely constituted the novelist's readers. For Richardson, who began\r\nin _Pamela_ with the purpose of teaching his hearers how to write, ended\r\nwith the deliberate purpose of teaching them how to live; and in most of\r\nhis work his chief object was, in his own words, to inculcate virtue and\r\ngood deportment. His novels, therefore, suffer as much from his purpose as\r\nfrom his own limitations. Notwithstanding his tedious moralizing and his\r\nother defects, Richardson in these three books gave something entirely new\r\nto the literary world, and the world appreciated the gift. This was the\r\nstory of human life, told from within, and depending for its interest not\r\non incident or adventure, but on its truth to human nature. Reading his\r\nwork is, on the whole, like examining the antiquated model of a stern-wheel\r\nsteamer; it is interesting for its undeveloped possibilities rather than\r\nfor its achievement.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY FIELDING (1707-1754)\r\n\r\nLIFE. Judged by his ability alone, Fielding was the greatest of this new\r\ngroup of novel writers, and one of the most artistic that our literature\r\nhas produced. He was born in East Stour, Dorsetshire, in 1707. In contrast\r\nwith Richardson, he was well educated, having spent several years at the\r\nfamous Eton school, and taken a degree in letters at the University of\r\nLeyden in 1728. Moreover, he had a deeper knowledge of life, gained from\r\nhis own varied and sometimes riotous experience. For several years after\r\nreturning from Leyden he gained a precarious living by writing plays,\r\nfarces, and buffoneries for the stage. In 1735 he married an admirable\r\nwoman, of whom we have glimpses in two of his characters, Amelia, and\r\nSophia Western, and lived extravagantly on her little fortune at East\r\nStour. Having used up all his money, he returned to London and studied law,\r\ngaining his living by occasional plays and by newspaper work. For ten\r\nyears, or more, little is definitely known of him, save that he published\r\nhis first novel, _Joseph Andrews_, in 1742, and that he was made justice of\r\nthe peace for Westminster in 1748. The remaining years of his life, in\r\nwhich his best novels were written, were not given to literature, but\r\nrather to his duties as magistrate, and especially to breaking up the gangs\r\nof thieves and cutthroats which infested the streets of London after\r\nnightfall. He died in Lisbon, whither he had gone for his health, in 1754,\r\nand lies buried there in the English cemetery. The pathetic account of this\r\nlast journey, together with an inkling of the generosity and\r\nkind-heartedness of the man, notwithstanding the scandals and\r\nirregularities of his life, are found in his last work, the _Journal of a\r\nVoyage to Lisbon_.\r\n\r\nFIELDING'S WORK. Fielding's first novel, _Joseph Andrews_ (1742), was\r\ninspired by the success of _Pamela_, and began as a burlesque of the false\r\nsentimentality and the conventional virtues of Richardson's heroine. He\r\ntook for his hero the alleged brother of Pamela, who was exposed to the\r\nsame kind of temptations, but who, instead of being rewarded for his\r\nvirtue, was unceremoniously turned out of doors by his mistress. There the\r\nburlesque ends; the hero takes to the open road, and Fielding forgets all\r\nabout Pamela in telling the adventures of Joseph and his companion, Parson\r\nAdams. Unlike Richardson, who has no humor, who minces words, and\r\nmoralizes, and dotes on the sentimental woes of his heroines, Fielding is\r\ndirect, vigorous, hilarious, and coarse to the point of vulgarity. He is\r\nfull of animal spirits, and he tells the story of a vagabond life, not for\r\nthe sake of moralizing, like Richardson, or for emphasizing a forced\r\nrepentance, like Defoe, but simply because it interests him, and his only\r\nconcern is \"to laugh men out of their follies.\" So his story, though it\r\nabounds in unpleasant incidents, generally leaves the reader with the\r\nstrong impression of reality.\r\n\r\nFielding's later novels are _Jonathan Wild_, the story of a rogue, which\r\nsuggests Defoe's narrative; _The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling_ (1749),\r\nhis best work; and _Amelia_ (1751), the story of a good wife in contrast\r\nwith an unworthy husband. His strength in all these works is in the\r\nvigorous but coarse figures, like those of Jan Steen's pictures, which fill\r\nmost of his pages; his weakness is in lack of taste, and in barrenness of\r\nimagination or invention, which leads him to repeat his plots and incidents\r\nwith slight variations. In all his work sincerity is perhaps the most\r\nmarked characteristic. Fielding likes virile men, just as they are, good\r\nand bad, but detests shams of every sort. His satire has none of Swift's\r\nbitterness, but is subtle as that of Chaucer, and good-natured as that of\r\nSteele. He never moralizes, though some of his powerfully drawn scenes\r\nsuggest a deeper moral lesson than anything in Defoe or Richardson; and he\r\nnever judges even the worst of his characters without remembering his own\r\nfrailty and tempering justice with mercy. On the whole, though much of his\r\nwork is perhaps in bad taste and is too coarse for pleasant or profitable\r\nreading, Fielding must be regarded as an artist, a very great artist, in\r\nrealistic fiction; and the advanced student who reads him will probably\r\nconcur in the judgment of a modern critic that, by giving us genuine\r\npictures of men and women of his own age, without moralizing over their\r\nvices and virtues, he became the real founder of the modern novel.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMOLLETT AND STERNE\r\n\r\nTobias Smollett (1721-1771) apparently tried to carry on Fielding's work;\r\nbut he lacked Fielding's genius, as well as his humor and inherent\r\nkindness, and so crowded his pages with the horrors and brutalities which\r\nare sometimes mistaken for realism. Smollett was a physician, of eccentric\r\nmanners and ferocious instincts, who developed his unnatural peculiarities\r\nby going as a surgeon on a battleship, where he seems to have picked up all\r\nthe evils of the navy and of the medical profession to use later in his\r\nnovels.\r\n\r\nHis three best known works are _Roderick Random_ (1748), a series of\r\nadventures related by the hero; _Peregrine Pickle_ (1751) in which he\r\nreflects with brutal directness the worst of his experiences at sea; and\r\n_Humphrey Clinker_ (1771), his last work, recounting the mild adventures of\r\na Welsh family in a journey through England and Scotland. This last alone\r\ncan be generally read without arousing the readers profound disgust.\r\nWithout any particular ability, he models his novels on _Don Quixote_, and\r\nthe result is simply a series of coarse adventures which are characteristic\r\nof the picaresque novel of his age. Were it not for the fact that he\r\nunconsciously imitates Jonson's _Every Man in His Humour_, he would hardly\r\nbe named among our writers of fiction; but in seizing upon some grotesque\r\nhabit or peculiarity and making a character out of it--such as Commodore\r\nTrunnion in _Peregrine Pickle_, Matthew Bramble in _Humphrey Clinker_, and\r\nBowling in _Roderick Random_--he laid the foundation for that exaggeration\r\nin portraying human eccentricities which finds a climax in Dickens's\r\ncaricatures.\r\n\r\nLawrence Sterne (1713-1768) has been compared to a \"little bronze satyr of\r\nantiquity in whose hollow body exquisite odors were stored.\" That is true,\r\nso far as the satyr is concerned; for a more weazened, unlovely personality\r\nwould be hard to find. The only question in the comparison is in regard to\r\nthe character of the odors, and that is a matter of taste. In his work he\r\nis the reverse of Smollett, the latter being given over to coarse\r\nvulgarities, which are often mistaken for realism; the former to whims and\r\nvagaries and sentimental tears, which frequently only disguise a sneer at\r\nhuman grief and pity.\r\n\r\nThe two books by which Sterne is remembered are _Tristram Shandy_ and _A\r\nSentimental Journey through France and Italy_. These are termed novels for\r\nthe simple reason that we know not what else to call them. The former was\r\nbegun, in his own words, \"with no real idea of how it was to turn out\"; its\r\nnine volumes, published at intervals from 1760 to 1767, proceeded in the\r\nmost aimless way, recording the experiences of the eccentric Shandy family;\r\nand the book was never finished. Its strength lies chiefly in its brilliant\r\nstyle, the most remarkable of the age, and in its odd characters, like\r\nUncle Toby and Corporal Trim, which, with all their eccentricities, are so\r\nhumanized by the author's genius that they belong among the great\r\n\"creations\" of our literature. The _Sentimental Journey_ is a curious\r\ncombination of fiction, sketches of travel, miscellaneous essays on odd\r\nsubjects,--all marked by the same brilliancy of style, and all stamped with\r\nSterne's false attitude towards everything in life. Many of its best\r\npassages were either adapted or taken bodily from Burton, Rabelais, and a\r\nscore of other writers; so that, in reading Sterne, one is never quite sure\r\nhow much is his own work, though the mark of his grotesque genius is on\r\nevery page.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST NOVELISTS AND THEIR WORK. With the publication of Goldsmith's\r\n_Vicar of Wakefield_ in 1766 the first series of English novels came to a\r\nsuitable close. Of this work, with its abundance of homely sentiment\r\nclustering about the family life as the most sacred of Anglo-Saxon\r\ninstitutions, we have already spoken[217] If we except _Robinson Crusoe_,\r\nas an adventure story, the _Vicar of Wakefield_ is the only novel of the\r\nperiod which can be freely recommended to all readers, as giving an\r\nexcellent idea of the new literary type, which was perhaps more remarkable\r\nfor its promise than for its achievement. In the short space of twenty-five\r\nyears there suddenly appeared and flourished a new form of literature,\r\nwhich influenced all Europe for nearly a century, and which still furnishes\r\nthe largest part of our literary enjoyment. Each successive novelist\r\nbrought some new element to the work, as when Fielding supplied animal\r\nvigor and humor to Richardson's analysis of a human heart, and Sterne added\r\nbrilliancy, and Goldsmith emphasized purity and the honest domestic\r\nsentiments which are still the greatest ruling force among men. So these\r\nearly workers were like men engaged in carving a perfect cameo from the\r\nreverse side. One works the profile, another the eyes, a third the mouth\r\nand the fine lines of character; and not till the work is finished, and the\r\ncameo turned, do we see the complete human face and read its meaning. Such,\r\nin a parable, is the story of the English novel.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. The period we are studying is included\r\nbetween the English Revolution of 1688 and the beginning of the French\r\nRevolution of 1789. Historically, the period begins in a remarkable way by\r\nthe adoption of the Bill of Rights in 1689. This famous bill was the third\r\nand final step in the establishment of constitutional government, the first\r\nstep being the Great Charter (1215), and the second the Petition of Right\r\n(1628). The modern form of cabinet government was established in the reign\r\nof George I (1714-1727). The foreign prestige of England was strengthened\r\nby the victories of Marlborough on the Continent, in the War of the Spanish\r\nSuccession; and the bounds of empire were enormously increased by Clive in\r\nIndia, by Cook in Australia and the islands of the Pacific, and by English\r\nvictories over the French in Canada and the Mississippi Valley, during the\r\nSeven Years', or French and Indian, Wars. Politically, the country was\r\ndivided into Whigs and Tories: the former seeking greater liberty for the\r\npeople; the latter upholding the king against popular government. The\r\ncontinued strife between these two political parties had a direct (and\r\ngenerally a harmful) influence on literature, as many of the great writers\r\nwere used by the Whig or Tory party to advance its own interests and to\r\nsatirize its enemies. Notwithstanding this perpetual strife of parties, the\r\nage is remarkable for the rapid social development, which soon expressed\r\nitself in literature. Clubs and coffeehouses multiplied, and the social\r\nlife of these clubs resulted in better manners, in a general feeling of\r\ntoleration, and especially in a kind of superficial elegance which shows\r\nitself in most of the prose and poetry of the period. On the other hand,\r\nthe moral standard of the nation was very low; bands of rowdies infested\r\nthe city streets after nightfall; bribery and corruption were the rule in\r\npolitics; and drunkenness was frightfully prevalent among all classes.\r\nSwift's degraded race of Yahoos is a reflection of the degradation to be\r\nseen in multitudes of London saloons. This low standard of morals\r\nemphasizes the importance of the great Methodist revival under Whitefield\r\nand Wesley, which began in the second quarter of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe literature of the century is remarkably complex, but we may classify it\r\nall under three general heads,--the Reign of so-called Classicism, the\r\nRevival of Romantic Poetry, and the Beginning of the Modern Novel. The\r\nfirst half of the century, especially, is an age of prose, owing largely to\r\nthe fact that the practical and social interests of the age demanded\r\nexpression. Modern newspapers, like the _Chronicle, Post_, and _Times_, and\r\nliterary magazines, like the _Tatler_ and _Spectator_, which began in this\r\nage, greatly influenced the development of a serviceable prose style. The\r\npoetry of the first half of the century, as typified in Pope, was polished,\r\nunimaginative, formal; and the closed couplet was in general use,\r\nsupplanting all other forms of verse. Both prose and poetry were too\r\nfrequently satiric, and satire does not tend to produce a high type of\r\nliterature. These tendencies in poetry were modified, in the latter part of\r\nthe century, by the revival of romantic poetry.\r\n\r\nIn our study we have noted: (1) the Augustan or Classic Age; the meaning of\r\nClassicism; the life and work of Alexander Pope, the greatest poet of the\r\nage; of Jonathan Swift, the satirist; of Joseph Addison, the essayist; of\r\nRichard Steele, who was the original genius of the _Tatler_ and the\r\n_Spectator_; of Samuel Johnson, who for nearly half a century was the\r\ndictator of English letters; of James Boswell, who gave us the immortal\r\n_Life of Johnson_; of Edmund Burke, the greatest of English orators; and of\r\nEdward Gibbon, the historian, famous for his _Decline and Fall of the Roman\r\nEmpire_.\r\n\r\n(2) The Revival of Romantic Poetry; the meaning of Romanticism; the life\r\nand work of Thomas Gray; of Oliver Goldsmith, famous as poet, dramatist,\r\nand novelist; of William Cowper; of Robert Burns, the greatest of Scottish\r\npoets; of William Blake, the mystic; and the minor poets of the early\r\nromantic movement,--James Thomson, William Collins, George Crabbe, James\r\nMacpherson, author of the Ossian poems, Thomas Chatterton, the boy who\r\noriginated the Rowley Papers, and Thomas Percy, whose work for literature\r\nwas to collect the old ballads, which he called the _Reliques of Ancient\r\nEnglish Poetry_, and to translate the stories of Norse mythology in his\r\n_Northern Antiquities_.\r\n\r\n(3) The First English Novelists; the meaning and history of the modern\r\nnovel; the life and work of Daniel Defoe, author of _Robinson Crusoe_, who\r\nis hardly to be called a novelist, but whom we placed among the pioneers;\r\nand the novels of Richardson, Fielding, Smollett, Sterne, and Goldsmith.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTIONS FOR READING.

Just as we understand the tremendous energizing influence of\r\nPuritanism in the matter of English liberty by remembering that the common\r\npeople had begun to read, and that their book was the Bible, so we may\r\nunderstand this age of popular government by remembering that the chief\r\nsubject of romantic literature was the essential nobleness of common men\r\nand the value of the individual. As we read now that brief portion of\r\nhistory which lies between the Declaration of Independence (1776) and the\r\nEnglish Reform Bill of 1832, we are in the presence of such mighty\r\npolitical upheavals that \"the age of revolution\" is the only name by which\r\nwe can adequately characterize it. Its great historic movements become\r\nintelligible only when we read what was written in this period; for the\r\nFrench Revolution and the American commonwealth, as well as the\r\nestablishment of a true democracy in England by the Reform Bill, were the\r\ninevitable results of ideas which literature had spread rapidly through the\r\ncivilized world. Liberty is fundamentally an ideal; and that\r\nideal--beautiful, inspiring, compelling, as a loved banner in the wind--was\r\nkept steadily before men's minds by a multitude of books and pamphlets as\r\nfar apart as Burns's _Poems_ and Thomas Paine's _Rights of Man_,--all read\r\neagerly by the common people, all proclaiming the dignity of common life,\r\nand all uttering the same passionate cry against every form of class or\r\ncaste oppression.\r\n\r\nFirst the dream, the ideal in some human soul; then the written word which\r\nproclaims it, and impresses other minds with its truth and beauty; then the\r\nunited and determined effort of men to make the dream a reality,--that\r\nseems to be a fair estimate of the part that literature plays, even in our\r\npolitical progress.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL SUMMARY. The period we are considering begins in the latter half\r\nof the reign of George III and ends with the accession of Victoria in 1837.\r\nWhen on a foggy morning in November, 1783, King George entered the House of\r\nLords and in a trembling voice recognized the independence of the United\r\nStates of America, he unconsciously proclaimed the triumph of that free\r\ngovernment by free men which had been the ideal of English literature for\r\nmore than a thousand years; though it was not till 1832, when the Reform\r\nBill became the law of the land, that England herself learned the lesson\r\ntaught her by America, and became the democracy of which her writers had\r\nalways dreamed.\r\n\r\nThe half century between these two events is one of great turmoil, yet of\r\nsteady advance in every department of English life. The storm center of the\r\npolitical unrest was the French Revolution, that frightful uprising which\r\nproclaimed the natural rights of man and the abolition of class\r\ndistinctions. Its effect on the whole civilized world is beyond\r\ncomputation. Patriotic clubs and societies multiplied in England, all\r\nasserting the doctrine of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, the watchwords of\r\nthe Revolution. Young England, led by Pitt the younger, hailed the new\r\nFrench republic and offered it friendship; old England, which pardons no\r\nrevolutions but her own, looked with horror on the turmoil in France and,\r\nmisled by Burke and the nobles of the realm, forced the two nations into\r\nwar. Even Pitt saw a blessing in this at first; because the sudden zeal for\r\nfighting a foreign nation--which by some horrible perversion is generally\r\ncalled patriotism--might turn men's thoughts from their own to their\r\nneighbors' affairs, and so prevent a threatened revolution at home.\r\n\r\nThe causes of this threatened revolution were not political but economic.\r\nBy her invention in steel and machinery, and by her monopoly of the\r\ncarrying trade, England had become the workshop of the world. Her wealth\r\nhad increased beyond her wildest dreams; but the unequal distribution of\r\nthat wealth was a spectacle to make angels weep. The invention of machinery\r\nat first threw thousands of skilled hand workers out of employment; in\r\norder to protect a few agriculturists, heavy duties were imposed on corn\r\nand wheat, and bread rose to famine prices just when laboring men had the\r\nleast money to pay for it. There followed a curious spectacle. While\r\nEngland increased in wealth, and spent vast sums to support her army and\r\nsubsidize her allies in Europe, and while nobles, landowners,\r\nmanufacturers, and merchants lived in increasing luxury, a multitude of\r\nskilled laborers were clamoring for work. Fathers sent their wives and\r\nlittle children into the mines and factories, where sixteen hours' labor\r\nwould hardly pay for the daily bread; and in every large city were riotous\r\nmobs made up chiefly of hungry men and women. It was this unbearable\r\neconomic condition, and not any political theory, as Burke supposed, which\r\noccasioned the danger of another English revolution.\r\n\r\nIt is only when we remember these conditions that we can understand two\r\nbooks, Adam Smith's _Wealth of Nations_ and Thomas Paine's _Rights of Man_,\r\nwhich can hardly be considered as literature, but which exercised an\r\nenormous influence in England. Smith was a Scottish thinker, who wrote to\r\nuphold the doctrine that labor is the only source of a nation's wealth, and\r\nthat any attempt to force labor into unnatural channels, or to prevent it\r\nby protective duties from freely obtaining the raw materials for its\r\nindustry, is unjust and destructive. Paine was a curious combination of\r\nJekyll and Hyde, shallow and untrustworthy personally, but with a\r\npassionate devotion to popular liberty. His _Rights of Man_ published in\r\nLondon in 1791, was like one of Burns's lyric outcries against institutions\r\nwhich oppressed humanity. Coming so soon after the destruction of the\r\nBastille, it added fuel to the flames kindled in England by the French\r\nRevolution. The author was driven out of the country, on the curious ground\r\nthat he endangered the English constitution, but not until his book had\r\ngained a wide sale and influence.\r\n\r\nAll these dangers, real and imaginary, passed away when England turned from\r\nthe affairs of France to remedy her own economic conditions. The long\r\nContinental war came to an end with Napoleon's overthrow at Waterloo, in\r\n1815; and England, having gained enormously in prestige abroad, now turned\r\nto the work of reform at home. The destruction of the African slave trade;\r\nthe mitigation of horribly unjust laws, which included poor debtors and\r\npetty criminals in the same class; the prevention of child labor; the\r\nfreedom of the press; the extension of manhood suffrage; the abolition of\r\nrestrictions against Catholics in Parliament; the establishment of hundreds\r\nof popular schools, under the leadership of Andrew Bell and Joseph\r\nLancaster,--these are but a few of the reforms which mark the progress of\r\ncivilization in a single half century. When England, in 1833, proclaimed\r\nthe emancipation of all slaves in all her colonies, she unconsciously\r\nproclaimed her final emancipation from barbarism.\r\n\r\nLITERARY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE AGE. It is intensely interesting to note\r\nhow literature at first reflected the political turmoil of the age; and\r\nthen, when the turmoil was over and England began her mighty work of\r\nreform, how literature suddenly developed a new creative spirit, which\r\nshows itself in the poetry of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, Keats,\r\nand in the prose of Scott, Jane Austen, Lamb, and De Quincey,--a wonderful\r\ngroup of writers, whose patriotic enthusiasm suggests the Elizabethan days,\r\nand whose genius has caused their age to be known as the second creative\r\nperiod of our literature. Thus in the early days, when old institutions\r\nseemed crumbling with the Bastille, Coleridge and Southey formed their\r\nyouthful scheme of a \"Pantisocracy on the banks of the Susquehanna,\"--an\r\nideal commonwealth, in which the principles of More's _Utopia_ should be\r\nput in practice. Even Wordsworth, fired with political enthusiasm, could\r\nwrite,\r\n\r\n    Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,\r\n    But to be young was very heaven.\r\n\r\nThe essence of Romanticism was, it must be remembered, that literature must\r\nreflect all that is spontaneous and unaffected in nature and in man, and be\r\nfree to follow its own fancy in its own way. We have already noted this\r\ncharacteristic in the work of the Elizabethan dramatists, who followed\r\ntheir own genius in opposition to all the laws of the critics. In Coleridge\r\nwe see this independence expressed in \"Kubla Khan\" and \"The Ancient\r\nMariner,\" two dream pictures, one of the populous Orient, the other of the\r\nlonely sea. In Wordsworth this literary independence led him inward to the\r\nheart of common things. Following his own instinct, as Shakespeare does, he\r\ntoo\r\n\r\n    Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,\r\n    Sermons in stones, and good in everything.\r\n\r\nAnd so, more than any other writer of the age, he invests the common life\r\nof nature, and the souls of common men and women, with glorious\r\nsignificance. These two poets, Coleridge and Wordsworth, best represent the\r\nromantic genius of the age in which they lived, though Scott had a greater\r\nliterary reputation, and Byron and Shelley had larger audiences.\r\n\r\nThe second characteristic of this age is that it is emphatically an age of\r\npoetry. The previous century, with its practical outlook on life, was\r\nlargely one of prose; but now, as in the Elizabethan Age, the young\r\nenthusiasts turned as naturally to poetry as a happy man to singing. The\r\nglory of the age is in the poetry of Scott, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron,\r\nShelley, Keats, Moore, and Southey. Of its prose works, those of Scott\r\nalone have attained a very wide reading, though the essays of Charles Lamb\r\nand the novels of Jane Austen have slowly won for their authors a secure\r\nplace in the history of our literature. Coleridge and Southey (who with\r\nWordsworth form the trio of so-called Lake Poets) wrote far more prose than\r\npoetry; and Southey's prose is much better than his verse. It was\r\ncharacteristic of the spirit of this age, so different from our own, that\r\nSouthey could say that, in order to earn money, he wrote in verse \"what\r\nwould otherwise have been better written in prose.\"\r\n\r\nIt was during this period that woman assumed, for the first time, an\r\nimportant place in our literature. Probably the chief reason for this\r\ninteresting phenomenon lies in the fact that woman was for the first time\r\ngiven some slight chance of education, of entering into the intellectual\r\nlife of the race; and as is always the case when woman is given anything\r\nlike a fair opportunity she responded magnificently. A secondary reason may\r\nbe found in the nature of the age itself, which was intensely emotional.\r\nThe French Revolution stirred all Europe to its depths, and during the\r\nfollowing half century every great movement in literature, as in politics\r\nand religion, was characterized by strong emotion; which is all the more\r\nnoticeable by contrast with the cold, formal, satiric spirit of the early\r\neighteenth century. As woman is naturally more emotional than man, it may\r\nwell be that the spirit of this emotional age attracted her, and gave her\r\nthe opportunity to express herself in literature.\r\n\r\nAs all strong emotions tend to extremes, the age produced a new type of\r\nnovel which seems rather hysterical now, but which in its own day delighted\r\nmultitudes of readers whose nerves were somewhat excited, and who reveled\r\nin \"bogey\" stories of supernatural terror. Mrs. Anne Radcliffe (1764-1823)\r\nwas one of the most successful writers of this school of exaggerated\r\nromance. Her novels, with their azure-eyed heroines, haunted castles,\r\ntrapdoors, bandits, abductions, rescues in the nick of time, and a general\r\nmedley of overwrought joys and horrors,[219] were immensely popular, not\r\nonly with the crowd of novel readers, but also with men of unquestioned\r\nliterary genius, like Scott and Byron.\r\n\r\nIn marked contrast to these extravagant stories is the enduring work of\r\nJane Austen, with her charming descriptions of everyday life, and of Maria\r\nEdgeworth, whose wonderful pictures of Irish life suggested to Walter Scott\r\nthe idea of writing his Scottish romances. Two other women who attained a\r\nmore or less lasting fame were Hannah More, poet, dramatist, and novelist,\r\nand Jane Porter, whose _Scottish Chiefs_ and _Thaddeus of Warsaw_ are still\r\nin demand in our libraries. Beside these were Fanny Burney (Madame\r\nD'Arblay) and several other writers whose works, in the early part of the\r\nnineteenth century, raised woman to the high place in literature which she\r\nhas ever since maintained.\r\n\r\nIn this age literary criticism became firmly established by the appearance\r\nof such magazines as the _Edinburgh Review_ (18O2), _The Quarterly Review_\r\n(1808), _Blackwood's Magazine_ (1817), the _Westminster Review_ (1824),\r\n_The Spectator_ (1828), _The Athenæum_ (1828), and _Fraser's Magazine_\r\n(1830). These magazines, edited by such men as Francis Jeffrey, John Wilson\r\n(who is known to us as Christopher North), and John Gibson Lockhart, who\r\ngave us the _Life of Scott_, exercised an immense influence on all\r\nsubsequent literature. At first their criticisms were largely destructive,\r\nas when Jeffrey hammered Scott, Wordsworth, and Byron most unmercifully;\r\nand Lockhart could find no good in either Keats or Tennyson; but with added\r\nwisdom, criticism assumed its true function of construction. And when these\r\nmagazines began to seek and to publish the works of unknown writers, like\r\nHazlitt, Lamb, and Leigh Hunt, they discovered the chief mission of the\r\nmodern magazine, which is to give every writer of ability the opportunity\r\nto make his work known to the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE POETS OF ROMANTICISM\r\n\r\nWILLIAM WORDSWORTH (1770-1850)\r\n\r\nIt was in 1797 that the new romantic movement in our literature assumed\r\ndefinite form. Wordsworth and Coleridge retired to the Quantock Hills,\r\nSomerset, and there formed the deliberate purpose to make literature\r\n\"adapted to interest mankind permanently,\" which, they declared, classic\r\npoetry could never do. Helping the two poets was Wordsworth's sister\r\nDorothy, with a woman's love for flowers and all beautiful things; and a\r\nwoman's divine sympathy for human life even in its lowliest forms. Though a\r\nsilent partner, she furnished perhaps the largest share of the inspiration\r\nwhich resulted in the famous _Lyrical Ballads_ of 1798. In their\r\npartnership Coleridge was to take up the \"supernatural, or at least\r\nromantic\"; while Wordsworth was \"to give the charm of novelty to things of\r\neveryday ... by awakening the mind's attention from the lethargy of custom\r\nand directing it to the loveliness and the wonders of the world before us.\"\r\nThe whole spirit of their work is reflected in two poems of this remarkable\r\nlittle volume, \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\" which is Coleridge's\r\nmasterpiece, and \"Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey,\" which\r\nexpresses Wordsworth's poetical creed, and which is one of the noblest and\r\nmost significant of our poems. That the _Lyrical Ballads_ attracted no\r\nattention,[220] and was practically ignored by a public that would soon go\r\ninto raptures over Byron's _Childe Harold_ and _Don Juan_, is of small\r\nconsequence. Many men will hurry a mile to see skyrockets, who never notice\r\nOrion and the Pleiades from their own doorstep. Had Wordsworth and\r\nColeridge written only this one little book, they would still be among the\r\nrepresentative writers of an age that proclaimed the final triumph of\r\nRomanticism.\r\n\r\nLIFE OF WORDSWORTH. To understand the life of him who, in Tennyson's words,\r\n\"uttered nothing base,\" it is well to read first _The Prelude_, which\r\nrecords the impressions made upon Wordsworth's mind from his earliest\r\nrecollection until his full manhood, in 1805, when the poem was\r\ncompleted.[221] Outwardly his long and uneventful life divides itself\r\nnaturally into four periods: (1) his childhood and youth, in the Cumberland\r\nHills, from 1770 to 1787; (2) a period of uncertainty, of storm and stress,\r\nincluding his university life at Cambridge, his travels abroad, and his\r\nrevolutionary experience, from 1787 to 1797; (3) a short but significant\r\nperiod of finding himself and his work, from 1797 to 1799; (4) a long\r\nperiod of retirement in the northern lake region, where he was born, and\r\nwhere for a full half century he lived so close to nature that her\r\ninfluence is reflected in all his poetry. When one has outlined these four\r\nperiods he has told almost all that can be told of a life which is marked,\r\nnot by events, but largely by spiritual experiences.\r\n\r\nWordsworth was born in 1770 at Cockermouth, Cumberland, where the Derwent,\r\n\r\n          Fairest of all rivers, loved\r\n    To blend his murmurs with my nurse's song,\r\n    And from his alder shades and rocky falls,\r\n    And from his fords and shallows, sent a voice\r\n    That flowed along my dreams.\r\n\r\nIt is almost a shock to one who knows Wordsworth only by his calm and noble\r\npoetry to read that he was of a moody and violent temper, and that his\r\nmother despaired of him alone among her five children. She died when he was\r\nbut eight years old, but not till she had exerted an influence which lasted\r\nall his life, so that he could remember her as \"the heart of all our\r\nlearnings and our loves.\" The father died some six years later, and the\r\norphan was taken in charge by relatives, who sent him to school at\r\nHawkshead, in the beautiful lake region. Here, apparently, the unroofed\r\nschool of nature attracted him more than the discipline of the classics,\r\nand he learned more eagerly from the flowers and hills and stars than from\r\nhis books; but one must read Wordsworth's own record, in _The Prelude_, to\r\nappreciate this. Three things in this poem must impress even the casual\r\nreader: first, Wordsworth loves to be alone, and is never lonely, with\r\nnature; second, like every other child who spends much time alone in the\r\nwoods and fields, he feels the presence of some living spirit, real though\r\nunseen, and companionable though silent; third, his impressions are exactly\r\nlike our own, and delightfully familiar. When he tells of the long summer\r\nday spent in swimming, basking in the sun, and questing over the hills; or\r\nof the winter night when, on his skates, he chased the reflection of a star\r\nin the black ice; or of his exploring the lake in a boat, and getting\r\nsuddenly frightened when the world grew big and strange,--in all this he is\r\nsimply recalling a multitude of our own vague, happy memories of childhood.\r\nHe goes out into the woods at night to tend his woodcock snares; he runs\r\nacross another boy's snares, follows them, finds a woodcock caught, takes\r\nit, hurries away through the night. And then,\r\n\r\n    I heard among the solitary hills\r\n    Low breathings coming after me, and sounds\r\n    Of undistinguishable motion.\r\n\r\nThat is like a mental photograph. Any boy who has come home through the\r\nwoods at night will recognize it instantly. Again he tells as of going\r\nbird's-nesting on the cliffs:\r\n\r\n            Oh, when I have hung\r\n    Above the raven's nest, by knots of grass\r\n    And half-inch fissures in the slippery rock\r\n    But ill-sustained, and almost (so it seemed)\r\n    Suspended by the blast that blew amain,\r\n    Shouldering the naked crag,--oh, at that time,\r\n    While on the perilous ridge I hung alone,\r\n    With what strange utterance did the loud dry wind\r\n    Blow through my ear! The sky seemed not a sky\r\n    Of earth,--and with what motion moved the clouds!\r\n\r\nNo man can read such records without finding his own boyhood again, and his\r\nown abounding joy of life, in the poet's early impressions.\r\n\r\nThe second period of Wordsworth's life begins with his university course at\r\nCambridge, in 1787. In the third book of _The Prelude_ we find a\r\ndispassionate account of student life, with its trivial occupations, its\r\npleasures and general aimlessness. Wordsworth proved to be a very ordinary\r\nscholar, following his own genius rather than the curriculum, and looking\r\nforward more eagerly to his vacation among the hills than to his\r\nexaminations. Perhaps the most interesting thing in his life at Cambridge\r\nwas his fellowship with the young political enthusiasts, whose spirit is\r\nexpressed in his remarkable poem on the French Revolution,--a poem which is\r\nbetter than a volume of history to show the hopes and ambitions that\r\nstirred all Europe in the first days of that mighty upheaval. Wordsworth\r\nmade two trips to France, in 1790 and 1791, seeing things chiefly through\r\nthe rosy spectacles of the young Oxford Republicans. On his second visit he\r\njoined the Girondists, or the moderate Republicans, and only the decision\r\nof his relatives, who cut off his allowance and hurried him back to\r\nEngland, prevented his going headlong to the guillotine with the leaders of\r\nhis party. Two things rapidly cooled Wordsworth's revolutionary enthusiasm,\r\nand ended the only dramatic interest of his placid life. One was the\r\nexcesses of the Revolution itself, and especially the execution of Louis\r\nXVI; the other was the rise of Napoleon, and the slavish adulation accorded\r\nby France to this most vulgar and dangerous of tyrants. His coolness soon\r\ngrew to disgust and opposition, as shown by his subsequent poems; and this\r\nbrought upon him the censure of Shelley, Byron, and other extremists,\r\nthough it gained the friendship of Scott, who from the first had no\r\nsympathy with the Revolution or with the young English enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nOf the decisive period of Wordsworth's life, when he was living with his\r\nsister Dorothy and with Coleridge at Alfoxden, we have already spoken. The\r\nimportance of this decision to give himself to poetry is evident when we\r\nremember that, at thirty years of age, he was without money or any definite\r\naim or occupation in life. He considered the law, but confessed he had no\r\nsympathy for its contradictory precepts and practices; he considered the\r\nministry, but though strongly inclined to the Church, he felt himself not\r\ngood enough for the sacred office; once he had wanted to be a soldier and\r\nserve his country, but had wavered at the prospect of dying of disease in a\r\nforeign land and throwing away his life without glory or profit to anybody.\r\nAn apparent accident, which looks more to us like a special Providence,\r\ndetermined his course. He had taken care of a young friend, Raisley\r\nCalvert, who died of consumption and left Wordsworth heir to a few hundred\r\npounds, and to the request that he should give his life to poetry. It was\r\nthis unexpected gift which enabled Wordsworth to retire from the world and\r\nfollow his genius. All his life he was poor, and lived in an atmosphere of\r\nplain living and high thinking. His poetry brought him almost nothing in\r\nthe way of money rewards, and it was only by a series of happy accidents\r\nthat he was enabled to continue his work. One of these accidents was that\r\nhe became a Tory, and soon accepted the office of a distributor of stamps,\r\nand was later appointed poet laureate by the government,--which occasioned\r\nBrowning's famous but ill-considered poem of \"The Lost Leader\":\r\n\r\n    Just for a handful of silver he left us,\r\n    Just for a riband to stick in his coat.\r\n\r\nThe last half century of Wordsworth's life, in which he retired to his\r\nbeloved lake district and lived successively at Grasmere and Rydal Mount,\r\nremind one strongly of Browning's long struggle for literary recognition.\r\nIt was marked by the same steadfast purpose, the same trusted ideal, the\r\nsame continuous work, and the same tardy recognition by the public. His\r\npoetry was mercilessly ridiculed by nearly all the magazine critics, who\r\nseized upon the worst of his work as a standard of judgment; and book after\r\nbook of poems appeared without meeting any success save the approval of a\r\nfew loyal friends. Without doubt or impatience he continued his work,\r\ntrusting to the future to recognize and approve it. His attitude here\r\nreminds one strongly of the poor old soldier whom he met in the hills,[222]\r\nwho refused to beg or to mention his long service or the neglect of his\r\ncountry, saying with noble simplicity,\r\n\r\n      My trust is in the God of Heaven\r\n    And in the eye of him who passes me.\r\n\r\nSuch work and patience are certain of their reward, and long before\r\nWordsworth's death he felt the warm sunshine of general approval. The wave\r\nof popular enthusiasm for Scott and Byron passed by, as their limitations\r\nwere recognized; and Wordsworth was hailed by critics as the first living\r\npoet, and one of the greatest that England had ever produced. On the death\r\nof Southey (1843) he was made poet laureate, against his own inclination.\r\nThe late excessive praise left him quite as unmoved as the first excessive\r\nneglect. The steady decline in the quality of his work is due not, as might\r\nbe expected, to self-satisfaction at success, but rather to his intense\r\nconservatism, to his living too much alone and failing to test his work by\r\nthe standards and judgment of other literary men. He died tranquilly in\r\n1850, at the age of eighty years, and was buried in the churchyard at\r\nGrasmere.\r\n\r\nSuch is the brief outward record of the world's greatest interpreter of\r\nnature's message; and only one who is acquainted with both nature and the\r\npoet can realize how inadequate is any biography; for the best thing about\r\nWordsworth must always remain unsaid. It is a comfort to know that his\r\nlife, noble, sincere, \"heroically happy,\" never contradicted his message.\r\nPoetry was his life; his soul was in all his work; and only by reading what\r\nhe has written can we understand the man.\r\n\r\nTHE POETRY OF WORDSWORTH. There is often a sense of disappointment when one\r\nreads Wordsworth for the first time; and this leads us to speak first of\r\ntwo difficulties which may easily prevent a just appreciation of the poet's\r\nworth. The first difficulty is in the reader, who is often puzzled by\r\nWordsworth's absolute simplicity. We are so used to stage effects in\r\npoetry, that beauty unadorned is apt to escape our notice,--like\r\nWordsworth's \"Lucy\":\r\n\r\n    A violet by a mossy stone,\r\n      Half hidden from the eye;\r\n    Fair as a star, when only one\r\n      Is shining in the sky.\r\n\r\nWordsworth set himself to the task of freeing poetry from all its\r\n\"conceits,\" of speaking the language of simple truth, and of portraying man\r\nand nature as they are; and in this good work we are apt to miss the\r\nbeauty, the passion, the intensity, that hide themselves under his simplest\r\nlines. The second difficulty is in the poet, not in the reader. It must be\r\nconfessed that Wordsworth is not always melodious; that he is seldom\r\ngraceful, and only occasionally inspired. When he is inspired, few poets\r\ncan be compared with him; at other times the bulk of his verse is so wooden\r\nand prosy that we wonder how a poet could have written it. Moreover he is\r\nabsolutely without humor, and so he often fails to see the small step that\r\nseparates the sublime from the ridiculous. In no other way can we explain\r\n\"The Idiot Boy,\" or pardon the serious absurdity of \"Peter Bell\" and his\r\ngrieving jackass.\r\n\r\nOn account of these difficulties it is well to avoid at first the longer\r\nworks and begin with a good book of selections.[223] When we read these\r\nexquisite shorter poems, with their noble lines that live forever in our\r\nmemory, we realize that Wordsworth is the greatest poet of nature that our\r\nliterature has produced. If we go further, and study the poems that impress\r\nus, we shall find four remarkable characteristics: (1) Wordsworth is\r\nsensitive as a barometer to every subtle change in the world about him. In\r\n_The Prelude_ he compares himself to an æolian harp, which answers with\r\nharmony to every touch of the wind; and the figure is strikingly accurate,\r\nas well as interesting, for there is hardly a sight or a sound, from a\r\nviolet to a mountain and from a bird note to the thunder of the cataract,\r\nthat is not reflected in some beautiful way in Wordsworth's poetry.\r\n\r\n(2) Of all the poets who have written of nature there is none that compares\r\nwith him in the truthfulness of his representation. Burns, like Gray, is\r\napt to read his own emotions into natural objects, so that there is more of\r\nthe poet than of nature even in his mouse and mountain daisy; but\r\nWordsworth gives you the bird and the flower, the wind and the tree and the\r\nriver, just as they are, and is content to let them speak their own\r\nmessage.\r\n\r\n(3) No other poet ever found such abundant beauty in the common world. He\r\nhad not only sight, but insight, that is, he not only sees clearly and\r\ndescribes accurately, but penetrates to the heart of things and always\r\nfinds some exquisite meaning that is not written on the surface. It is idle\r\nto specify or to quote lines on flowers or stars, on snow or vapor. Nothing\r\nis ugly or commonplace in his world; on the contrary, there is hardly one\r\nnatural phenomenon which he has not glorified by pointing out some beauty\r\nthat was hidden from our eyes.\r\n\r\n(4) It is the _life_ of nature which is everywhere recognized; not mere\r\ngrowth and cell changes, but sentient, personal life; and the recognition\r\nof this personality in nature characterizes all the world's great poetry.\r\nIn his childhood Wordsworth regarded natural objects, the streams, the\r\nhills, the flowers, even the winds, as his companions; and with his mature\r\nbelief that all nature is the reflection of the living God, it was\r\ninevitable that his poetry should thrill with the sense of a Spirit that\r\n\"rolls through all things.\" Cowper, Burns, Keats, Tennyson,--all these\r\npoets give you the outward aspects of nature in varying degrees; but\r\nWordsworth gives you her very life, and the impression of some personal\r\nliving spirit that meets and accompanies the man who goes alone through the\r\nwoods and fields. We shall hardly find, even in the philosophy of Leibnitz,\r\nor in the nature myths of our Indians, any such impression of living nature\r\nas this poet awakens in us. And that suggests another delightful\r\ncharacteristic of Wordsworth's poetry, namely, that he seems to awaken\r\nrather than create an impression; he stirs our memory deeply, so that in\r\nreading him we live once more in the vague, beautiful wonderland of our own\r\nchildhood.\r\n\r\nSuch is the philosophy of Wordsworth's nature poetry. If we search now for\r\nhis philosophy of human life, we shall find four more doctrines, which rest\r\nupon his basal conception that man is not apart from nature, but is the\r\nvery \"life of her life.\" (1) In childhood man is sensitive as a wind harp\r\nto all natural influences; he is an epitome of the gladness and beauty of\r\nthe world. Wordsworth explains this gladness and this sensitiveness to\r\nnature by the doctrine that the child comes straight from the Creator of\r\nnature:\r\n\r\n    Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:\r\n    The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,\r\n      Hath had elsewhere its setting,\r\n        And cometh from afar:\r\n      Not in entire forgetfulness\r\n      And not in utter nakedness,\r\n    But trailing clouds of glory do we come\r\n      From God, who is our home.\r\n\r\nIn this exquisite ode, which he calls \"Intimations of Immortality from\r\nRecollections of Early Childhood\" (1807), Wordsworth sums up his philosophy\r\nof childhood; and he may possibly be indebted here to the poet Vaughan,\r\nwho, more than a century before, had proclaimed in \"The Retreat\" the same\r\ndoctrine. This kinship with nature and with God, which glorifies childhood,\r\nought to extend through a man's whole life and ennoble it. This is the\r\nteaching of \"Tintern Abbey,\" in which the best part of our life is shown to\r\nbe the result of natural influences. According to Wordsworth, society and\r\nthe crowded unnatural life of cities tend to weaken and pervert humanity;\r\nand a return to natural and simple living is the only remedy for human\r\nwretchedness.\r\n\r\n(2) The natural instincts and pleasures of childhood are the true standards\r\nof a man's happiness in this life. All artificial pleasures soon grow\r\ntiresome. The natural pleasures, which a man so easily neglects in his\r\nwork, are the chief means by which we may expect permanent and increasing\r\njoy. In \"Tintern Abbey,\" \"The Rainbow,\" \"Ode to Duty,\" and \"Intimations of\r\nImmortality\" we see this plain teaching; but we can hardly read one of\r\nWordsworth's pages without finding it slipped in unobtrusively, like the\r\nfragrance of a wild flower.\r\n\r\n(3) The _truth_ of humanity, that is, the common life which labors and loves\r\nand shares the general heritage of smiles and tears, is the only subject of\r\npermanent literary interest. Burns and the early poets of the Revival began\r\nthe good work of showing the romantic interest of common life; and\r\nWordsworth continued it in \"Michael,\" \"The Solitary Reaper,\" \"To a Highland\r\nGirl,\" \"Stepping Westward,\" _The Excursion_, and a score of lesser poems.\r\nJoy and sorrow, not of princes or heroes, but \"in widest commonalty\r\nspread,\" are his themes; and the hidden purpose of many of his poems is to\r\nshow that the keynote of all life is happiness,--not an occasional thing,\r\nthe result of chance or circumstance, but a heroic thing, to be won, as one\r\nwould win any other success, by work and patience.\r\n\r\n(4) To this natural philosophy of man Wordsworth adds a mystic element, the\r\nresult of his own belief that in every natural object there is a reflection\r\nof the living God. Nature is everywhere transfused and illumined by Spirit;\r\nman also is a reflection of the divine Spirit; and we shall never\r\nunderstand the emotions roused by a flower or a sunset until we learn that\r\nnature appeals through the eye of man to his inner spirit. In a word,\r\nnature must be \"spiritually discerned.\" In \"Tintern Abbey\" the spiritual\r\nappeal of nature is expressed in almost every line; but the mystic\r\nconception of man is seen more clearly in \"Intimations of Immortality,\"\r\nwhich Emerson calls \"the high-water mark of poetry in the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\" In this last splendid ode Wordsworth adds to his spiritual\r\ninterpretation of nature and man the alluring doctrine of preëxistence,\r\nwhich has appealed so powerfully to Hindoo and Greek in turn, and which\r\nmakes of human life a continuous, immortal thing, without end or beginning.\r\n\r\nWordsworth's longer poems, since they contain much that is prosy and\r\nuninteresting, may well be left till after we have read the odes, sonnets,\r\nand short descriptive poems that have made him famous. As showing a certain\r\nheroic cast of Wordsworth's mind, it is interesting to learn that the\r\ngreater part of his work, including _The Prelude_ and _The Excursion_, was\r\nintended for a place in a single great poem, to be called _The Recluse_,\r\nwhich should treat of nature, man, and society. _The Prelude_, treating of\r\nthe growth of a poet's mind, was to introduce the work. The _Home at\r\nGrasmere_, which is the first book of _The Recluse_, was not published till\r\n1888, long after the poet's death. _The Excursion_ (1814) is the second\r\nbook of _The Recluse_; and the third was never completed, though Wordsworth\r\nintended to include most of his shorter poems in this third part, and so\r\nmake an immense personal epic of a poet's life and work. It is perhaps just\r\nas well that the work remained unfinished. The best of his work appeared in\r\nthe _Lyrical Ballads_ (1798) and in the sonnets, odes, and lyrics of the\r\nnext ten years; though \"The Duddon Sonnets\" (1820), \"To a Skylark\" (1825),\r\nand \"Yarrow Revisited\" (1831) show that he retained till past sixty much of\r\nhis youthful enthusiasm. In his later years, however, he perhaps wrote too\r\nmuch; his poetry, like his prose, becomes dull and unimaginative; and we\r\nmiss the flashes of insight, the tender memories of childhood, and the\r\nrecurrence of noble lines--each one a poem--that constitutes the surprise\r\nand the delight of reading Wordsworth.\r\n\r\n    The outward shows of sky and earth,\r\n      Of hill and valley, he has viewed;\r\n    And impulses of deeper birth\r\n      Have come to him in solitude.\r\n    In common things that round us lie\r\n      Some random truths he can impart--\r\n    The harvest of a quiet eye\r\n      That broods and sleeps on his own heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE (1772-1834)\r\n\r\n    A grief without a pang, void, dark and drear,\r\n      A stifled, drowsy, unimpassioned grief,\r\n    Which finds no natural outlet, no relief,\r\n      In word, or sigh, or tear.\r\n\r\nIn the wonderful \"Ode to Dejection,\" from which the above fragment is\r\ntaken, we have a single strong impression of Coleridge's whole life,--a\r\nsad, broken, tragic life, in marked contrast with the peaceful existence of\r\nhis friend Wordsworth. For himself, during the greater part of his life,\r\nthe poet had only grief and remorse as his portion; but for everybody else,\r\nfor the audiences that were charmed by the brilliancy of his literary\r\nlectures, for the friends who gathered about him to be inspired by his\r\nideals and conversation, and for all his readers who found unending delight\r\nin the little volume which holds his poetry, he had and still has a\r\ncheering message, full of beauty and hope and inspiration. Such is\r\nColeridge, a man of grief who makes the world glad.\r\n\r\nLIFE. In 1772 there lived in Ottery St. Mary, Devonshire, a queer little\r\nman, the Rev. John Coleridge, vicar of the parish church and master of the\r\nlocal grammar school. In the former capacity he preached profound sermons,\r\nquoting to open-mouthed rustics long passages from the Hebrew, which he\r\ntold them was the very tongue of the Holy Ghost. In the latter capacity he\r\nwrote for his boys a new Latin grammar, to mitigate some of the\r\ndifficulties of traversing that terrible jungle by means of ingenious\r\nbypaths and short cuts. For instance, when his boys found the ablative a\r\nsomewhat difficult case to understand, he told them to think of it as the\r\n_quale-quare-quidditive_ case, which of course makes its meaning perfectly\r\nclear. In both these capacities the elder Coleridge was a sincere man,\r\ngentle and kindly, whose memory was \"like a religion\" to his sons and\r\ndaughters. In that same year was born Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the youngest\r\nof thirteen children. He was an extraordinarily precocious child, who could\r\nread at three years of age, and who, before he was five, had read the Bible\r\nand the Arabian Nights, and could remember an astonishing amount from both\r\nbooks. From three to six he attended a \"dame\" school; and from six till\r\nnine (when his father died and left the family destitute) he was in his\r\nfather's school, learning the classics, reading an enormous quantity of\r\nEnglish books, avoiding novels, and delighting in cumbrous theological and\r\nmetaphysical treatises. At ten he was sent to the Charity School of\r\nChrist's Hospital, London, where he met Charles Lamb, who records his\r\nimpression of the place and of Coleridge in one of his famous essays.[224]\r\nColeridge seems to have remained in this school for seven or eight years\r\nwithout visiting his home,--a poor, neglected boy, whose comforts and\r\nentertainments were all within himself. Just as, when a little child, he\r\nused to wander over the fields with a stick in his hand, slashing the tops\r\nfrom weeds and thistles, and thinking himself to be the mighty champion of\r\nChristendom against the infidels, so now he would lie on the roof of the\r\nschool, forgetting the play of his fellows and the roar of the London\r\nstreets, watching the white clouds drifting over and following them in\r\nspirit into all sorts of romantic adventures.\r\n\r\nAt nineteen this hopeless dreamer, who had read more books than an old\r\nprofessor, entered Cambridge as a charity student. He remained for nearly\r\nthree years, then ran away because of a trifling debt and enlisted in the\r\nDragoons, where he served several months before he was discovered and\r\nbrought back to the university. He left in 1794 without taking his degree;\r\nand presently we find him with the youthful Southey,--a kindred spirit, who\r\nhad been fired to wild enthusiasm by the French Revolution,--founding his\r\nfamous Pantisocracy for the regeneration of human society. \"The Fall of\r\nRobespierre,\" a poem composed by the two enthusiasts, is full of the new\r\nrevolutionary spirit. The Pantisocracy, on the banks of the Susquehanna,\r\nwas to be an ideal community, in which the citizens combined farming and\r\nliterature; and work was to be limited to two hours each day. Moreover,\r\neach member of the community was to marry a good woman, and take her with\r\nhim. The two poets obeyed the latter injunction first, marrying two\r\nsisters, and then found that they had no money to pay even their traveling\r\nexpenses to the new Utopia.\r\n\r\nDuring all the rest of his career a tragic weakness of will takes\r\npossession of Coleridge, making it impossible for him, with all his genius\r\nand learning, to hold himself steadily to any one work or purpose. He\r\nstudied in Germany; worked as a private secretary, till the drudgery wore\r\nupon his free spirit; then he went to Rome and remained for two years, lost\r\nin study. Later he started _The Friend_, a paper devoted to truth and\r\nliberty; lectured on poetry and the fine arts to enraptured audiences in\r\nLondon, until his frequent failures to meet his engagements scattered his\r\nhearers; was offered an excellent position and a half interest (amounting\r\nto some £2000) in the _Morning Post_ and _The Courier_, but declined it,\r\nsaying \"that I would not give up the country and the lazy reading of old\r\nfolios for two thousand times two thousand pounds,--in short, that beyond\r\n£350 a year I considered money a real evil.\" His family, meanwhile, was\r\nalmost entirely neglected; he lived apart, following his own way, and the\r\nwife and children were left in charge of his friend Southey. Needing money,\r\nhe was on the point of becoming a Unitarian minister, when a small pension\r\nfrom two friends enabled him to live for a few years without regular\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\nA terrible shadow in Coleridge's life was the apparent cause of most of his\r\ndejection. In early life he suffered from neuralgia, and to ease the pain\r\nbegan to use opiates. The result on such a temperament was almost\r\ninevitable. He became a slave to the drug habit; his naturally weak will\r\nlost all its directing and sustaining force, until, after fifteen years of\r\npain and struggle and despair, he gave up and put himself in charge of a\r\nphysician, one Mr. Gillman, of Highgate. Carlyle, who visited him at this\r\ntime, calls him \"a king of men,\" but records that \"he gave you the idea of\r\na life that had been full of sufferings, a life heavy-laden,\r\nhalf-vanquished, still swimming painfully in seas of manifold physical and\r\nother bewilderment.\"\r\n\r\nThe shadow is dark indeed; but there are gleams of sunshine that\r\noccasionally break through the clouds. One of these is his association with\r\nWordsworth and his sister Dorothy, in the Quantock hills, out of which came\r\nthe famous _Lyrical Ballads_ of 1798. Another was his loyal devotion to\r\npoetry for its own sake. With the exception of his tragedy _Remorse_, which\r\nthrough Byron's influence was accepted at Drury Lane Theater, and for which\r\nhe was paid £400, he received almost nothing for his poetry. Indeed, he\r\nseems not to have desired it; for he says: \"Poetry has been to me its own\r\nexceeding great reward; it has soothed my afflictions; it has multiplied\r\nand refined my enjoyments; it has endeared solitude, and it has given me\r\nthe habit of wishing to discover the good and the beautiful in all that\r\nmeets and surrounds me.\" One can better understand his exquisite verse\r\nafter such a declaration. A third ray of sunlight came from the admiration\r\nof his contemporaries; for though he wrote comparatively little, he was by\r\nhis talents and learning a leader among literary men, and his conversations\r\nwere as eagerly listened to as were those of Dr. Johnson. Wordsworth says\r\nof him that, though other men of the age had done some wonderful things,\r\nColeridge was the only wonderful man he had ever known. Of his lectures on\r\nliterature a contemporary says: \"His words seem to flow as from a person\r\nrepeating with grace and energy some delightful poem.\" And of his\r\nconversation it is recorded: \"Throughout a long-drawn summer's day would\r\nthis man talk to you in low, equable but clear and musical tones,\r\nconcerning things human and divine; marshalling all history, harmonizing\r\nall experiment, probing the depths of your consciousness, and revealing\r\nvisions of glory and terror to the imagination.\"\r\n\r\nThe last bright ray of sunlight comes from Coleridge's own soul, from the\r\ngentle, kindly nature which made men love and respect him in spite of his\r\nweaknesses, and which caused Lamb to speak of him humorously as \"an\r\narchangel a little damaged.\" The universal law of suffering seems to be\r\nthat it refines and softens humanity; and Coleridge was no exception to the\r\nlaw. In his poetry we find a note of human sympathy, more tender and\r\nprofound than can be found in Wordsworth or, indeed, in any other of the\r\ngreat English poets. Even in his later poems, when he has lost his first\r\ninspiration and something of the splendid imaginative power that makes his\r\nwork equal to the best of Blake's, we find a soul tender, triumphant,\r\nquiet, \"in the stillness of a great peace.\" He died in 1834, and was buried\r\nin Highgate Church. The last stanza of the boatman's song, in _Remorse_,\r\nserves better to express the world's judgment than any epitaph:\r\n\r\n    Hark! the cadence dies away\r\n    On the quiet moon-lit sea;\r\n    The boatmen rest their oars and say,\r\n      _Miserere Domini!_\r\n\r\nWORKS OF COLERIDGE. The works of Coleridge naturally divide themselves into\r\nthree classes,--the poetic, the critical, and the philosophical,\r\ncorresponding to the early, the middle, and the later periods of his\r\ncareer. Of his poetry Stopford Brooke well says: \"All that he did\r\nexcellently might be bound up in twenty pages, but it should be bound in\r\npure gold.\" His early poems show the influence of Gray and Blake,\r\nespecially of the latter. When Coleridge begins his \"Day Dream\" with the\r\nline, \"My eyes make pictures when they're shut,\" we recall instantly\r\nBlake's haunting _Songs of Innocence_. But there is this difference between\r\nthe two poets,--in Blake we have only a dreamer; in Coleridge we have the\r\nrare combination of the dreamer and the profound scholar. The quality of\r\nthis early poetry, with its strong suggestion of Blake, may be seen in such\r\npoems as \"A Day Dream,\" \"The Devil's Thoughts,\" \"The Suicide's Argument,\"\r\nand \"The Wanderings of Cain.\" His later poems, wherein we see his\r\nimagination bridled by thought and study, but still running very freely,\r\nmay best be appreciated in \"Kubla Khan,\" \"Christabel,\" and \"The Rime of the\r\nAncient Mariner.\" It is difficult to criticise such poems; one can only\r\nread them and wonder at their melody, and at the vague suggestions which\r\nthey conjure up in the mind. \"Kubla Khan\" is a fragment, painting a\r\ngorgeous Oriental dream picture, such as one might see in an October\r\nsunset. The whole poem came to Coleridge one morning when he had fallen\r\nasleep over Purchas, and upon awakening he began to write hastily,\r\n\r\n    In Xanadu did Kubla Khan\r\n    A stately pleasure-dome decree:\r\n    Where Alph, the sacred river, ran\r\n    Through caverns measureless to man\r\n    Down to a sunless sea.\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted after fifty-four lines were written, and he never\r\nfinished the poem.\r\n\r\n\"Christabel\" is also a fragment, which seems to have been planned as the\r\nstory of a pure young girl who fell under the spell of a sorcerer, in the\r\nshape of the woman Geraldine. It is full of a strange melody, and contains\r\nmany passages of exquisite poetry; but it trembles with a strange, unknown\r\nhorror, and so suggests the supernatural terrors of the popular hysterical\r\nnovels, to which we have referred. On this account it is not wholesome\r\nreading; though one flies in the face of Swinburne and of other critics by\r\nventuring to suggest such a thing.\r\n\r\n\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" is Coleridge's chief contribution to the\r\n_Lyrical Ballads_ of 1798, and is one of the world's masterpieces. Though\r\nit introduces the reader to a supernatural realm, with a phantom ship, a\r\ncrew of dead men, the overhanging curse of the albatross, the polar spirit,\r\nand the magic breeze, it nevertheless manages to create a sense of absolute\r\nreality concerning these manifest absurdities. All the mechanisms of the\r\npoem, its meter, rime, and melody are perfect; and some of its descriptions\r\nof the lonely sea have never been equaled. Perhaps we should say\r\nsuggestions, rather than descriptions; for Coleridge never describes\r\nthings, but makes a suggestion, always brief and always exactly right, and\r\nour own imagination instantly supplies the details. It is useless to quote\r\nfragments; one must read the entire poem, if he reads nothing else of the\r\nromantic school of poetry.\r\n\r\nAmong Coleridge's shorter poems there is a wide variety, and each reader\r\nmust be left largely to follow his own taste. The beginner will do well to\r\nread a few of the early poems, to which we have referred, and then try the\r\n\"Ode to France,\" \"Youth and Age,\" \"Dejection,\" \"Love Poems,\" \"Fears in\r\nSolitude,\" \"Religious Musings,\" \"Work Without Hope,\" and the glorious \"Hymn\r\nBefore Sunrise in the Vale of Chamouni.\" One exquisite little poem from the\r\nLatin, \"The Virgin's Cradle Hymn,\" and his version of Schiller's\r\n_Wallenstein_, show Coleridge's remarkable power as a translator. The\r\nlatter is one of the best poetical translations in our literature.\r\n\r\nOf Coleridge's prose works, the _Biographia, Literaria, or Sketches of My\r\nLiterary Life and Opinions_ (1817), his collected _Lectures on Shakespeare_\r\n(1849), and _Aids to Reflection_ (1825) are the most interesting from a\r\nliterary view point. The first is an explanation and criticism of\r\nWordsworth's theory of poetry, and contains more sound sense and\r\nilluminating ideas on the general subject of poetry than any other book in\r\nour language. The _Lectures_, as refreshing as a west wind in midsummer,\r\nare remarkable for their attempt to sweep away the arbitrary rules which\r\nfor two centuries had stood in the way of literary criticism of\r\nShakespeare, in order to study the works themselves. No finer analysis and\r\nappreciation of the master's genius has ever been written. In his\r\nphilosophical work Coleridge introduced the idealistic philosophy of\r\nGermany into England. He set himself in line with Berkeley, and squarely\r\nagainst Bentham, Malthus, Mill, and all the materialistic tendencies which\r\nwere and still are the bane of English philosophy. The _Aids to Reflection_\r\nis Coleridge's most profound work, but is more interesting to the student\r\nof religion and philosophy than to the readers of literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT SOUTHEY (1774-1843)\r\n\r\nClosely associated with Wordsworth and Coleridge is Robert Southey; and the\r\nthree, on account of their residence in the northern lake district, were\r\nreferred to contemptuously as the \"Lakers\" by the Scottish magazine\r\nreviewers. Southey holds his place in this group more by personal\r\nassociation than by his literary gifts. He was born at Bristol, in 1774;\r\nstudied at Westminster School, and at Oxford, where he found himself in\r\nperpetual conflict with the authorities on account of his independent\r\nviews. He finally left the university and joined Coleridge in his scheme of\r\na Pantisocracy. For more than fifty years he labored steadily at\r\nliterature, refusing to consider any other occupation. He considered\r\nhimself seriously as one of the greatest writers of the day, and a reading\r\nof his ballads--which connected him at once with the romantic school--leads\r\nus to think that, had he written less, he might possibly have justified his\r\nown opinion of himself. Unfortunately he could not wait for inspiration,\r\nbeing obliged to support not only his own family but also, in large\r\nmeasure, that of his friend Coleridge.\r\n\r\nSouthey gradually surrounded himself with one of the most extensive\r\nlibraries in England, and set himself to the task of of writing something\r\nevery working day. The results of his industry were one hundred and nine\r\nvolumes, besides some hundred and fifty articles for the magazines, most of\r\nwhich are now utterly forgotten. His most ambitious poems are _Thalaba_, a\r\ntale of Arabian enchantment; _The Curse of Kehama_, a medley of Hindoo\r\nmythology; _Madoc_, a legend of a Welsh prince who discovered the western\r\nworld; and _Roderick_, a tale of the last of the Goths. All these, and many\r\nmore, although containing some excellent passages, are on the whole\r\nexaggerated and unreal, both in manner and in matter. Southey wrote far\r\nbetter prose than poetry, and his admirable _Life of Nelson_ is still often\r\nread. Besides these are his _Lives of British Admirals_, his lives of\r\nCowper and Wesley, and his histories of Brazil and of the Peninsular War.\r\n\r\nSouthey was made Poet Laureate in 1813, and was the first to raise that\r\noffice from the low estate into which it had fallen since the death of\r\nDryden. The opening lines of Thalaba, beginning,\r\n\r\n    How beautiful is night!\r\n    A dewy freshness fills the silent air,\r\n\r\nare still sometimes quoted; and a few of his best known short poems, like\r\n\"The Scholar,\" \"Auld Cloots,\" \"The Well of St. Keyne,\" \"The Inchcape Rock,\"\r\nand \"Lodore,\" will repay the curious reader. The beauty of Southey's\r\ncharacter, his patience and helpfulness, make him a worthy associate of the\r\ntwo greater poets with whom he is generally named.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALTER SCOTT (1771-1832)\r\n\r\nWe have already called attention to two significant movements of the\r\neighteenth century, which we must for a moment recall if we are to\r\nappreciate Scott, not simply as a delightful teller of tales, but as a\r\ntremendous force in modern literature. The first is the triumph of romantic\r\npoetry in Wordsworth and Coleridge; the second is the success of our first\r\nEnglish novelists, and the popularization of literature by taking it from\r\nthe control of a few patrons and critics and putting it into the hands of\r\nthe people as one of the forces which mold our modern life. Scott is an\r\nepitome of both these movements. The poetry of Wordsworth and Coleridge was\r\nread by a select few, but Scott's _Marmion_ and _Lady of the Lake_ aroused\r\na whole nation to enthusiasm, and for the first time romantic poetry became\r\nreally popular. So also the novel had been content to paint men and women\r\nof the present, until the wonderful series of Waverley novels appeared,\r\nwhen suddenly, by the magic of this \"Wizard of the North,\" all history\r\nseemed changed. The past, which had hitherto appeared as a dreary region of\r\ndead heroes, became alive again, and filled with a multitude of men and\r\nwomen who had the surprising charm of reality. It is of small consequence\r\nthat Scott's poetry and prose are both faulty; that his poems are read\r\nchiefly for the story, rather than for their poetic excellence; and that\r\nmuch of the evident crudity and barbarism of the Middle Ages is ignored or\r\nforgotten in Scott's writings. By their vigor, their freshness, their rapid\r\naction, and their breezy, out-of-door atmosphere, Scott's novels attracted\r\nthousands of readers who else had known nothing of the delights of\r\nliterature. He is, therefore, the greatest known factor in establishing and\r\nin popularizing that romantic element in prose and poetry which has been\r\nfor a hundred years the chief characteristic of our literature.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Scott was born in Edinburgh, on August 15, 1771. On both his mother's\r\nand father's side he was descended from old Border families, distinguished\r\nmore for their feuds and fighting than for their intellectual attainments.\r\nHis father was a barrister, a just man, who often lost clients by advising\r\nthem to be, first of all, honest in their lawsuits. His mother was a woman\r\nof character and education, strongly imaginative, a teller of tales which\r\nstirred young Walter's enthusiasm by revealing the past as a world of\r\nliving heroes.\r\n\r\nAs a child, Scott was lame and delicate, and was therefore sent away from\r\nthe city to be with his grandmother in the open country at Sandy Knowe, in\r\nRoxburghshire, near the Tweed. This grandmother was a perfect treasure-\r\nhouse of legends concerning the old Border feuds. From her wonderful tales\r\nScott developed that intense love of Scottish history and tradition which\r\ncharacterizes all his work.\r\n\r\nBy the time he was eight years old, when he returned to Edinburgh, Scott's\r\ntastes were fixed for life. At the high school he was a fair scholar, but\r\nwithout enthusiasm, being more interested in Border stories than in the\r\ntext-books. He remained at school only six or seven years, and then entered\r\nhis father's office to study law, at the same time attending lectures at\r\nthe university. He kept this up for some six years without developing any\r\ninterest in his profession, not even when he passed his examinations and\r\nwas admitted to the Bar, in 1792. After nineteen years of desultory work,\r\nin which he showed far more zeal in gathering Highland legends than in\r\ngaining clients, he had won two small legal offices which gave him enough\r\nincome to support him comfortably. His home, meanwhile, was at Ashestiel on\r\nthe Tweed, where all his best poetry was written.\r\n\r\nScott's literary work began with the translation from the German of\r\nBürger's romantic ballad of _Lenore_ (1796) and of Goethe's _Götz von\r\nBerlichingen_ (1799); but there was romance enough in his own loved\r\nHighlands, and in 1802-1803 appeared three volumes of his _Minstrelsy of\r\nthe Scottish Border_, which he had been collecting for many years. In 1805,\r\nwhen Scott was 34 years old, appeared his first original work, _The Lay of\r\nthe Last Minstrel_. Its success was immediate, and when _Marmion_ (1808)\r\nand _The Lady of the Lake_ (1810) aroused Scotland and England to intense\r\nenthusiasm, and brought unexpected fame to the author,--without in the\r\nleast spoiling his honest and lovable nature,--Scott gladly resolved to\r\nabandon the law, in which he had won scant success, and give himself wholly\r\nto literature. Unfortunately, however, in order to increase his earnings,\r\nhe entered secretly into partnership with the firms of Constable and the\r\nbrothers Ballantyne, as printer-publishers,--a sad mistake, indeed, and the\r\ncause of that tragedy which closed the life of Scotland's greatest writer.\r\n\r\nThe year 1811 is remarkable for two things in Scott's life. In this year he\r\nseems to have realized that, notwithstanding the success of his poems, he\r\nhad not yet \"found himself\"; that he was not a poetic genius, like Burns;\r\nthat in his first three poems he had practically exhausted his material,\r\nthough he still continued to write verse; and that, if he was to keep his\r\npopularity, he must find some other work. The fact that, only a year later,\r\nByron suddenly became the popular favorite, shows how correctly Scott had\r\njudged himself and the reading public, which was even more fickle than\r\nusual in this emotional age. In that same year, 1811, Scott bought the\r\nestate of Abbotsford, on the Tweed, with which place his name is forever\r\nassociated. Here he began to spend large sums, and to dispense the generous\r\nhospitality of a Scotch laird, of which he had been dreaming for years. In\r\n1820 he was made a baronet; and his new title of Sir Walter came nearer to\r\nturning his honest head than had all his literary success. His business\r\npartnership was kept secret, and during all the years when the Waverley\r\nnovels were the most popular books in the world, their authorship remained\r\nunknown; for Scott deemed it beneath the dignity of his title to earn money\r\nby business or literature, and sought to give the impression that the\r\nenormous sums spent at Abbotsford in improving the estate and in\r\nentertaining lavishly were part of the dignity of the position and came\r\nfrom ancestral sources.\r\n\r\nIt was the success of Byron's _Childe Harold_, and the comparative failure\r\nof Scott's later poems, _Rokeby_, _The Bridal of Triermain_, and _The Lord\r\nof the Isles_, which led our author into the new field, where he was to be\r\nwithout a rival. Rummaging through a cabinet one day in search of some\r\nfishing tackle, Scott found the manuscript of a story which he had begun\r\nand laid aside nine years before. He read this old story eagerly, as if it\r\nhad been another's work; finished it within three weeks, and published it\r\nwithout signing his name. The success of this first novel, _Waverley_\r\n(1814), was immediate and unexpected. Its great sales and the general\r\nchorus of praise for its unknown author were without precedent; and when\r\n_Guy Mannering, The Antiquary, Black Dwarf, Old Mortality, Rob Roy_, and\r\n_The Heart of Midlothian_ appeared within the next four years, England's\r\ndelight and wonder knew no bounds. Not only at home, but also on the\r\nContinent, large numbers of these fresh and fascinating stories were sold\r\nas fast as they could be printed.\r\n\r\nDuring the seventeen years which followed the appearance of _Waverley_,\r\nScott wrote on an average nearly two novels per year, creating an unusual\r\nnumber of characters and illustrating many periods of Scotch, English, and\r\nFrench history, from the time of the Crusades to the fall of the Stuarts.\r\nIn addition to these historical novels, he wrote _Tales of a Grandfather,\r\nDemonology and Witchcraft_, biographies of Dryden and of Swift, the _Life\r\nof Napoleon_, in nine volumes, and a large number of articles for the\r\nreviews and magazines. It was an extraordinary amount of literary work, but\r\nit was not quite so rapid and spontaneous as it seemed. He had been very\r\ndiligent in looking up old records, and we must remember that, in nearly\r\nall his poems and novels, Scott was drawing upon a fund of legend,\r\ntradition, history, and poetry, which he had been gathering for forty\r\nyears, and which his memory enabled him to produce at will with almost the\r\naccuracy of an encyclopedia.\r\n\r\nFor the first six years Scott held himself to Scottish history, giving us\r\nin nine remarkable novels the whole of Scotland, its heroism, its superb\r\nfaith and enthusiasm, and especially its clannish loyalty to its hereditary\r\nchiefs; giving us also all parties and characters, from Covenanters to\r\nRoyalists, and from kings to beggars. After reading these nine volumes we\r\nknow Scotland and Scotchmen as we can know them in no other way. In 1819 he\r\nturned abruptly from Scotland, and in _Ivanhoe_, the most popular of his\r\nworks, showed what a mine of neglected wealth lay just beneath the surface\r\nof English history. It is hard to realize now, as we read its rapid,\r\nmelodramatic action, its vivid portrayal of Saxon and Norman character, and\r\nall its picturesque details, that it was written rapidly, at a time when\r\nthe author was suffering from disease and could hardly repress an\r\noccasional groan from finding its way into the rapid dictation. It stands\r\nto-day as the best example of the author's own theory that the will of a\r\nman is enough to hold him steadily, against all obstacles, to the task of\r\n\"doing what he has a mind to do.\" _Kenilworth, Nigel, Peveril_, and\r\n_Woodstock_, all written in the next few years, show his grasp of the\r\nromantic side of English annals; _Count Robert_ and _The Talisman_ show his\r\nenthusiasm for the heroic side of the Crusaders' nature; and _Quentin\r\nDurward_ and _Anne of Geierstein_ suggest another mine of romance which he\r\ndiscovered in French history.\r\n\r\nFor twenty years Scott labored steadily at literature, with the double\r\nobject of giving what was in him, and of earning large sums to support the\r\nlavish display which he deemed essential to a laird of Scotland. In 1826,\r\nwhile he was blithely at work on _Woodstock_, the crash came. Not even the\r\nvast earnings of all these popular novels could longer keep the wretched\r\nbusiness of Ballantyne on its feet, and the firm failed, after years of\r\nmismanagement. Though a silent partner, Scott assumed full responsibility,\r\nand at fifty-five years of age, sick, suffering, and with all his best work\r\nbehind him, he found himself facing a debt of over half a million dollars.\r\nThe firm could easily have compromised with its creditors; but Scott\r\nrefused to hear of bankruptcy laws under which he could have taken refuge.\r\nHe assumed the entire debt as a personal one, and set resolutely to work to\r\npay every penny. Times were indeed changed in England when, instead of a\r\nliterary genius starving until some wealthy patron gave him a pension, this\r\nman, aided by his pen alone, could confidently begin to earn that enormous\r\namount of money. And this is one of the unnoticed results of the\r\npopularization of literature. Without a doubt Scott would have accomplished\r\nthe task, had he been granted only a few years of health. He still lived at\r\nAbbotsford, which he had offered to his creditors, but which they\r\ngenerously refused to accept; and in two years, by miscellaneous work, had\r\npaid some two hundred thousand dollars of his debt, nearly half of this sum\r\ncoming from his _Life of Napoleon_. A new edition of the Waverley novels\r\nappeared, which was very successful financially, and Scott had every reason\r\nto hope that he would soon face the world owing no man a penny, when he\r\nsuddenly broke under the strain. In 1830 occurred a stroke of paralysis\r\nfrom which he never fully recovered; though after a little time he was\r\nagain at work, dictating with splendid patience and resolution. He writes\r\nin his diary at this time: \"The blow is a stunning one, I suppose, for I\r\nscarcely feel it. It is singular, but it comes with as little surprise as\r\nif I had a remedy ready, yet God knows I am at sea in the dark, and the\r\nvessel leaky.\"\r\n\r\nIt is good to remember that governments are not always ungrateful, and to\r\nrecord that, when it became known that a voyage to Italy might improve\r\nScott's health, the British government promptly placed a naval vessel at\r\nthe disposal of a man who had led no armies to the slaughter, but had only\r\ngiven pleasure to multitudes of peaceable men and women by his stories. He\r\nvisited Malta, Naples, and Rome; but in his heart he longed for Scotland,\r\nand turned homeward after a few months of exile. The river Tweed, the\r\nScotch hills, the trees of Abbotsford, the joyous clamor of his dogs,\r\nbrought forth the first exclamation of delight which had passed Scott's\r\nlips since he sailed away. He died in September of the same year, 1832, and\r\nwas buried with his ancestors in the old Dryburgh Abbey.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF SCOTT. Scott's work is of a kind which the critic gladly passes\r\nover, leaving each reader to his own joyous and uninstructed opinion. From\r\na literary view point the works are faulty enough, if one is looking for\r\nfaults; but it is well to remember that they were intended to give delight,\r\nand that they rarely fail of their object. When one has read the stirring\r\n_Marmion_ or the more enduring _Lady of the Lake_, felt the heroism of the\r\nCrusaders in _The Talisman_, the picturesqueness of chivalry in _Ivanhoe_,\r\nthe nobleness of soul of a Scotch peasant girl in _The Heart of\r\nMidlothian_, and the quality of Scotch faith in _Old Mortality_, then his\r\nown opinion of Scott's genius will be of more value than all the criticisms\r\nthat have ever been written.\r\n\r\nAt the outset we must confess frankly that Scott's poetry is not artistic,\r\nin the highest sense, and that it lacks the deeply imaginative and\r\nsuggestive qualities which make a poem the noblest and most enduring work\r\nof humanity. We read it now, not for its poetic excellence, but for its\r\nabsorbing story interest. Even so, it serves an admirable purpose.\r\n_Marmion_ and _The Lady of the Lake_, which are often the first long poems\r\nread by the beginner in literature, almost invariably lead to a deeper\r\ninterest in the subject; and many readers owe to these poems an\r\nintroduction to the delights of poetry. They are an excellent beginning,\r\ntherefore, for young readers, since they are almost certain to hold the\r\nattention, and to lead indirectly to an interest in other and better poems.\r\nAside from this, Scott's poetry is marked by vigor and youthful abandon;\r\nits interest lies in its vivid pictures, its heroic characters, and\r\nespecially in its rapid action and succession of adventures, which hold and\r\ndelight us still, as they held and delighted the first wondering readers.\r\nAnd one finds here and there terse descriptions, or snatches of song and\r\nballad, like the \"Boat Song\" and \"Lochinvar,\" which are among the best\r\nknown in our literature.\r\n\r\nIn his novels Scott plainly wrote too rapidly and too much. While a genius\r\nof the first magnitude, the definition of genius as \"the infinite capacity\r\nfor taking pains\" hardly belongs to him. For details of life and history,\r\nfor finely drawn characters, and for tracing the logical consequences of\r\nhuman action, he has usually no inclination. He sketches a character\r\nroughly, plunges him into the midst of stirring incidents, and the action\r\nof the story carries us on breathlessly to the end. So his stories are\r\nlargely adventure stories, at the best; and it is this element of adventure\r\nand glorious action, rather than the study of character, which makes Scott\r\na perennial favorite of the young. The same element of excitement is what\r\ncauses mature readers to turn from Scott to better novelists, who have more\r\npower to delineate human character, and to create, or discover, a romantic\r\ninterest in the incidents of everyday life rather than in stirring\r\nadventure.[225]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these limitations, it is well--especially in these days,\r\nwhen we hear that Scott is outgrown--to emphasize four noteworthy things\r\nthat he accomplished.\r\n\r\n(1) He created the historical novel[226]; and all novelists of the last\r\ncentury who draw upon history for their characters and events are followers\r\nof Scott and acknowledge his mastery.\r\n\r\n(2) His novels are on a vast scale, covering a very wide range of action,\r\nand are concerned with public rather than with private interests. So, with\r\nthe exception of _The Bride of Lammermoor_, the love story in his novels is\r\ngenerally pale and feeble; but the strife and passions of big parties are\r\nmagnificently portrayed. A glance over even the titles of his novels shows\r\nhow the heroic side of history for over six hundred years finds expression\r\nin his pages; and all the parties of these six centuries--Crusaders,\r\nCovenanters, Cavaliers, Roundheads, Papists, Jews, Gypsies, Rebels--start\r\ninto life again, and fight or give a reason for the faith that is in them.\r\nNo other novelist in England, and only Balzac in France, approaches Scott\r\nin the scope of his narratives.\r\n\r\n(3) Scott was the first novelist in any language to make the scene an\r\nessential element in the action. He knew Scotland, and loved it; and there\r\nis hardly an event in any of his Scottish novels in which we do not breathe\r\nthe very atmosphere of the place, and feel the presence of its moors and\r\nmountains. The place, morever, is usually so well chosen and described that\r\nthe action seems almost to be the result of natural environment. Perhaps\r\nthe most striking illustration of this harmony between scene and incident\r\nis found in _Old Mortality_, where Morton approaches the cave of the old\r\nCovenanter, and where the spiritual terror inspired by the fanatic's\r\nstruggle with imaginary fiends is paralleled by the physical terror of a\r\ngulf and a roaring flood spanned by a slippery tree trunk. A second\r\nillustration of the same harmony of scene and incident is found in the\r\nmeeting of the arms and ideals of the East and West, when the two champions\r\nfight in the burning desert, and then eat bread together in the cool shade\r\nof the oasis, as described in the opening chapter of _The Talisman_. A\r\nthird illustration is found in that fascinating love scene, where Ivanhoe\r\nlies wounded, raging at his helplessness, while the gentle Rebecca\r\nalternately hides and reveals her love as she describes the terrific\r\nassault on the castle, which goes on beneath her window. His thoughts are\r\nall on the fight; hers on the man she loves; and both are natural, and both\r\nare exactly what we expect under the circumstances. These are but striking\r\nexamples of the fact that, in all his work, Scott tries to preserve perfect\r\nharmony between the scene and the action.\r\n\r\n(4) Scott's chief claim to greatness lies in the fact that he was the first\r\nnovelist to recreate the past; that he changed our whole conception of\r\nhistory by making it to be, not a record of dry facts, but a stage on which\r\nliving men and women played their parts. Carlyle's criticism is here most\r\npertinent: \"These historical novels have taught this truth ... unknown to\r\nwriters of history: that the bygone ages of the world were actually filled\r\nby living men, not by protocols, state papers, controversies, and\r\nabstractions of men.\" Not only the pages of history, but all the hills and\r\nvales of his beloved Scotland are filled with living characters,--lords and\r\nladies, soldiers, pirates, gypsies, preachers, schoolmasters, clansmen,\r\nbailiffs, dependents,--all Scotland is here before our eyes, in the reality\r\nof life itself. It is astonishing, with his large numbers of characters,\r\nthat Scott never repeats himself. Naturally he is most at home in Scotland,\r\nand with humble people. Scott's own romantic interest in feudalism caused\r\nhim to make his lords altogether too lordly; his aristocratic maidens are\r\nusually bloodless, conventional, exasperating creatures, who talk like\r\nbooks and pose like figures in an old tapestry. But when he describes\r\ncharacters like Jeanie Deans, in _The Heart of Midlothian_, and the old\r\nclansman, Evan Dhu, in _Waverley_, we know the very soul of Scotch\r\nwomanhood and manhood.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one thing more should be said, or rather repeated, of Scott's\r\nenduring work. He is always sane, wholesome, manly, inspiring. We know the\r\nessential nobility of human life better, and we are better men and women\r\nourselves, because of what he has written.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE GORDON, LORD BYRON (1788-1824)\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct sides to Byron and his poetry, one good, the other\r\nbad; and those who write about him generally describe one side or the other\r\nin superlatives. Thus one critic speaks of his \"splendid and imperishable\r\nexcellence of sincerity and strength\"; another of his \"gaudy charlatanry,\r\nblare of brass, and big bow-wowishness.\" As both critics are fundamentally\r\nright, we shall not here attempt to reconcile their differences, which\r\narise from viewing one side of the man's nature and poetry to the exclusion\r\nof the other. Before his exile from England, in 1816, the general\r\nimpression made by Byron is that of a man who leads an irregular life,\r\nposes as a romantic hero, makes himself out much worse than he really is,\r\nand takes delight in shocking not only the conventions but the ideals of\r\nEnglish society. His poetry of this first period is generally, though not\r\nalways, shallow and insincere in thought, and declamatory or bombastic in\r\nexpression. After his exile, and his meeting with Shelley in Italy, we note\r\na gradual improvement, due partly to Shelley's influence and partly to his\r\nown mature thought and experience. We have the impression now of a\r\ndisillusioned man who recognizes his true character, and who, though\r\ncynical and pessimistic, is at least honest in his unhappy outlook on\r\nsociety. His poetry of this period is generally less shallow and\r\nrhetorical, and though he still parades his feelings in public, he often\r\nsurprises us by being manly and sincere. Thus in the third canto of _Childe\r\nHarold_, written just after his exile, he says:\r\n\r\n    In my youth's summer I did sing of one,\r\n    The wandering outlaw of his own dark mind;\r\n\r\nand as we read on to the end of the splendid fourth canto--with its poetic\r\nfeeling for nature, and its stirring rhythm that grips and holds the reader\r\nlike martial music--we lay down the book with profound regret that this\r\ngifted man should have devoted so much of his talent to describing trivial\r\nor unwholesome intrigues and posing as the hero of his own verses. The real\r\ntragedy of Byron's life is that he died just as he was beginning to find\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Byron was born in London in 1788, the year preceding the French\r\nRevolution. We shall understand him better, and judge him more charitably,\r\nif we remember the tainted stock from which he sprang. His father was a\r\ndissipated spendthrift of unspeakable morals; his mother was a Scotch\r\nheiress, passionate and unbalanced. The father deserted his wife after\r\nsquandering her fortune; and the boy was brought up by the mother who\r\n\"alternately petted and abused\" him. In his eleventh year the death of a\r\ngranduncle left him heir to Newstead Abbey and to the baronial title of one\r\nof the oldest houses in England. He was singularly handsome; and a lameness\r\nresulting from a deformed foot lent a suggestion of pathos to his make-up.\r\nAll this, with his social position, his pseudo-heroic poetry, and his\r\ndissipated life,--over which he contrived to throw a veil of romantic\r\nsecrecy,--made him a magnet of attraction to many thoughtless young men and\r\nfoolish women, who made the downhill path both easy and rapid to one whose\r\ninclinations led him in that direction. Naturally he was generous, and\r\neasily led by affection. He is, therefore, largely a victim of his own\r\nweakness and of unfortunate surroundings.\r\n\r\nAt school at Harrow, and in the university at Cambridge, Byron led an\r\nunbalanced life, and was more given to certain sports from which he was not\r\ndebarred by lameness, than to books and study. His school life, like his\r\ninfancy, is sadly marked by vanity, violence, and rebellion against every\r\nform of authority; yet it was not without its hours of nobility and\r\ngenerosity. Scott describes him as \"a man of real goodness of heart, and\r\nthe kindest and best feelings, miserably thrown away by his foolish\r\ncontempt of public opinion.\" While at Cambridge, Byron published his first\r\nvolume of poems, _Hours of Idleness_, in 1807. A severe criticism of the\r\nvolume in the _Edinburgh Review_ wounded Byron's vanity, and threw him into\r\na violent passion, the result of which was the now famous satire called\r\n_English Bards and Scotch Reviewers_, in which not only his enemies, but\r\nalso Scott, Wordsworth, and nearly all the literary men of his day, were\r\nsatirized in heroic couplets after the manner of Pope's _Dunciad_. It is\r\nonly just to say that he afterwards made friends with Scott and with others\r\nwhom he had abused without provocation; and it is interesting to note, in\r\nview of his own romantic poetry, that he denounced all masters of romance\r\nand accepted the artificial standards of Pope and Dryden. His two favorite\r\nbooks were the Old Testament and a volume of Pope's poetry. Of the latter\r\nhe says, \"His is the greatest name in poetry ... all the rest are\r\nbarbarians.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1809 Byron, when only twenty-one years of age, started on a tour of\r\nEurope and the Orient. The poetic results of this trip were the first two\r\ncantos of _Childe Harold's Pilgrimage_, with their famous descriptions of\r\nromantic scenery. The work made him instantly popular, and his fame\r\novershadowed Scott's completely. As he says himself, \"I awoke one morning\r\nto find myself famous,\" and presently he styles himself \"the grand Napoleon\r\nof the realms of rhyme.\" The worst element in Byron at this time was his\r\ninsincerity, his continual posing as the hero of his poetry. His best works\r\nwere translated, and his fame spread almost as rapidly on the Continent as\r\nin England. Even Goethe was deceived, and declared that a man so wonderful\r\nin character had never before appeared in literature, and would never\r\nappear again. Now that the tinsel has worn off, and we can judge the man\r\nand his work dispassionately, we see how easily even the critics of the age\r\nwere governed by romantic impulses.\r\n\r\nThe adulation of Byron lasted only a few years in England. In 1815 he\r\nmarried Miss Milbanke, an English heiress, who abruptly left him a year\r\nlater. With womanly reserve she kept silence; but the public was not slow\r\nto imagine plenty of reasons for the separation. This, together with the\r\nfact that men had begun to penetrate the veil of romantic secrecy with\r\nwhich Byron surrounded himself and found a rather brassy idol beneath,\r\nturned the tide of public opinion against him. He left England under a\r\ncloud of distrust and disappointment, in 1816, and never returned. Eight\r\nyears were spent abroad, largely in Italy, where he was associated with\r\nShelley until the latter's tragic death in 1822. His house was ever the\r\nmeeting place for Revolutionists and malcontents calling themselves\r\npatriots, whom he trusted too greatly, and with whom he shared his money\r\nmost generously. Curiously enough, while he trusted men too easily, he had\r\nno faith in human society or government, and wrote in 1817: \"I have\r\nsimplified my politics to an utter detestation of all existing\r\ngovernments.\" During his exile he finished _Childe Harold, The Prisoner of\r\nChillon_, his dramas _Cain_ and _Manfred_, and numerous other works, in\r\nsome of which, as in _Don Juan_, he delighted in revenging himself upon his\r\ncountrymen by holding up to ridicule all that they held most sacred.\r\n\r\nIn 1824 Byron went to Greece to give himself and a large part of his\r\nfortune to help that country in its struggle for liberty against the Turks.\r\nHow far he was led by his desire for posing as a hero, and how far by a\r\ncertain vigorous Viking spirit that was certainly in him, will never be\r\nknown. The Greeks welcomed him and made him a leader, and for a few months\r\nhe found himself in the midst of a wretched squabble of lies, selfishness,\r\ninsincerity, cowardice, and intrigue, instead of the heroic struggle for\r\nliberty which he had anticipated. He died of fever, in Missolonghi, in\r\n1824. One of his last poems, written there on his thirty-sixth birthday, a\r\nfew months before he died, expresses his own view of his disappointing\r\nlife:\r\n\r\n    My days are in the yellow leaf,\r\n    The flowers and fruits of love are gone:\r\n    The worm, the canker, and the grief\r\n        Are mine alone.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF BYRON. In reading Byron it is well to remember that he was a\r\ndisappointed and embittered man, not only in his personal life, but also in\r\nhis expectation of a general transformation of human society. As he pours\r\nout his own feelings, chiefly, in his poetry, he is the most expressive\r\nwriter of his age in voicing the discontent of a multitude of Europeans who\r\nwere disappointed at the failure of the French Revolution to produce an\r\nentirely new form of government and society.\r\n\r\nOne who wishes to understand the whole scope of Byron's genius and poetry\r\nwill do well to begin with his first work, _Hours of Idleness_, written\r\nwhen he was a young man at the university. There is very little poetry in\r\nthe volume, only a striking facility in rime, brightened by the devil-may-\r\ncare spirit of the Cavalier poets; but as a revelation of the man himself\r\nit is remarkable. In a vain and sophomoric preface he declares that poetry\r\nis to him an idle experiment, and that this is his first and last attempt\r\nto amuse himself in that line. Curiously enough, as he starts for Greece on\r\nhis last, fatal journey, he again ridicules literature, and says that the\r\npoet is a \"mere babbler.\" It is this despising of the art which alone makes\r\nhim famous that occasions our deepest disappointment. Even in his\r\nmagnificent passages, in a glowing description of nature or of a Hindoo\r\nwoman's exquisite love, his work is frequently marred by a wretched pun, or\r\nby some cheap buffoonery, which ruins our first splendid impression of his\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\nByron's later volumes, _Manfred_ and _Cain_, the one a curious, and perhaps\r\nunconscious, parody of _Faust_, the other of _Paradise Lost_, are his two\r\nbest known dramatic works. Aside from the question of their poetic value,\r\nthey are interesting as voicing Byron's excessive individualism and his\r\nrebellion against society. The best known and the most readable of Byron's\r\nworks _Mazeppa, The Prisoner of Chillon_, and _Childe Harold's Pilgrimage_.\r\nThe first two cantos of _Childe Harold_ (1812) are perhaps more frequently\r\nread than any other work of the same author, partly because of their\r\nmelodious verse, partly because of their descriptions of places along the\r\nlines of European travel; but the last two cantos (1816-1818) written after\r\nhis exile from England, have more sincerity, and are in every way better\r\nexpressions of Byron's mature genius. Scattered through all his works one\r\nfinds magnificent descriptions of natural scenery, and exquisite lyrics of\r\nlove and despair; but they are mixed with such a deal of bombast and\r\nrhetoric, together with much that is unwholesome, that the beginner will do\r\nwell to confine himself to a small volume of well-chosen selections.[227]\r\n\r\nByron is often compared with Scott, as having given to us Europe and the\r\nOrient, just as Scott gave us Scotland and its people; but while there is a\r\ncertain resemblance in the swing and dash of the verses, the resemblance is\r\nall on the surface, and the underlying difference between the two poets is\r\nas great as that between Thackeray and Bulwer-Lytton. Scott knew his\r\ncountry well,--its hills and valleys which are interesting as the abode of\r\nliving and lovable men and women. Byron pretended to know the secret,\r\nunwholesome side of Europe, which generally hides itself in the dark; but\r\ninstead of giving us a variety of living men, he never gets away from his\r\nown unbalanced and egotistical self. All his characters, in _Cain, Manfred,\r\nThe Corsair, The Giaour, Childe Harold, Don Juan_, are tiresome repetitions\r\nof himself,--a vain, disappointed, cynical man, who finds no good in life\r\nor love or anything. Naturally, with such a disposition, he is entirely\r\nincapable of portraying a true woman. To nature alone, especially in her\r\nmagnificent moods, Byron remains faithful; and his portrayal of the night\r\nand the storm and the ocean in _Childe Harold_ are unsurpassed in our\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY (1792-1822)\r\n\r\n    Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is:\r\n      What if my leaves are falling like its own!\r\n    The tumult of thy mighty harmonies\r\n      Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone,\r\n    Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, spirit fierce,\r\n      My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!\r\n\r\nIn this fragment, from the \"Ode to the West Wind,\" we have a suggestion of\r\nShelley's own spirit, as reflected in all his poetry. The very spirit of\r\nnature, which appeals to us in the wind and the cloud, the sunset and the\r\nmoonrise, seems to have possessed him, at times, and made him a chosen\r\ninstrument of melody. At such times he is a true poet, and his work is\r\nunrivaled. At other times, unfortunately, Shelley joins with Byron in\r\nvoicing a vain rebellion against society. His poetry, like his life,\r\ndivides itself into two distinct moods. In one he is the violent reformer,\r\nseeking to overthrow our present institutions and to hurry the millennium\r\nout of its slow walk into a gallop. Out of this mood come most of his\r\nlonger poems, like _Queen Mab, Revolt of Islam, Hellas_, and _The Witch of\r\nAtlas_, which are somewhat violent diatribes against government, priests,\r\nmarriage, religion, even God as men supposed him to be. In a different\r\nmood, which finds expression _Alastor, Adonais_, and his wonderful lyrics,\r\nShelley is like a wanderer following a vague, beautiful vision, forever sad\r\nand forever unsatisfied. In the latter mood he appeals profoundly to all\r\nmen who have known what it is to follow after an unattainable ideal.\r\n\r\nSHELLEY'S LIFE. There are three classes of men who see visions, and all\r\nthree are represented in our literature. The first is the mere dreamer,\r\nlike Blake, who stumbles through a world of reality without noticing it,\r\nand is happy in his visions. The second is the seer, the prophet, like\r\nLangland, or Wyclif, who sees a vision and quietly goes to work, in ways\r\nthat men understand, to make the present world a little more like the ideal\r\none which he sees in his vision. The third, who appears in many forms,--as\r\nvisionary, enthusiast, radical, anarchist, revolutionary, call him what you\r\nwill,--sees a vision and straightway begins to tear down all human\r\ninstitutions, which have been built up by the slow toil of centuries,\r\nsimply because they seem to stand in the way of his dream. To the latter\r\nclass belongs Shelley, a man perpetually at war with the present world, a\r\nmartyr and exile, simply because of his inability to sympathize with men\r\nand society as they are, and because of his own mistaken judgment as to the\r\nvalue and purpose of a vision.\r\n\r\nShelley was born in Field Place, near Horsham, Sussex, in 1792. On both his\r\nfather's and his mother's side he was descended from noble old families,\r\nfamous in the political and literary history of England. From childhood he\r\nlived, like Blake, in a world of fancy, so real that certain imaginary\r\ndragons and headless creatures of the neighboring wood kept him and his\r\nsisters in a state of fearful expectancy. He learned rapidly, absorbed the\r\nclassics as if by intuition, and, dissatisfied with ordinary processes of\r\nlearning, seems to have sought, like Faustus, the acquaintance of spirits,\r\nas shown in his \"Hymn to Intellectual Beauty\":\r\n\r\n    While yet a boy, I sought for ghosts, and sped\r\n      Through many a listening chamber, cave and ruin,\r\n      And starlight wood, with fearful steps pursuing\r\n    Hopes of high talk with the departed dead.\r\n\r\nShelley's first public school, kept by a hard-headed Scotch master, with\r\nits floggings and its general brutality, seemed to him like a combination\r\nof hell and prison; and his active rebellion against existing institutions\r\nwas well under way when, at twelve years of age, he entered the famous\r\npreparatory school at Eton. He was a delicate, nervous, marvelously\r\nsensitive boy, of great physical beauty; and, like Cowper, he suffered\r\ntorments at the hands of his rough schoolfellows. Unlike Cowper, he was\r\npositive, resentful, and brave to the point of rashness; soul and body rose\r\nup against tyranny; and he promptly organized a rebellion against the\r\nbrutal fagging system. \"Mad Shelley\" the boys called him, and they chivied\r\nhim like dogs around a little coon that fights and cries defiance to the\r\nend. One finds what he seeks in this world, and it is not strange that\r\nShelley, after his Eton experiences, found causes for rebellion in all\r\nexisting forms of human society, and that he left school \"to war among\r\nmankind,\" as he says of himself in the _Revolt of Islam_. His university\r\ndays are but a repetition of his earlier experiences. While a student at\r\nOxford he read some scraps of Hume's philosophy, and immediately published\r\na pamphlet called \"The Necessity of Atheism.\" It was a crude, foolish piece\r\nof work, and Shelley distributed it by post to every one to whom it might\r\ngive offense. Naturally this brought on a conflict with the authorities,\r\nbut Shelley would not listen to reason or make any explanation, and was\r\nexpelled from the university in 1811.\r\n\r\nShelley's marriage was even more unfortunate. While living in London, on a\r\ngenerous sister's pocket money, a certain young schoolgirl, Harriet\r\nWestbrook, was attracted by Shelley's crude revolutionary doctrines. She\r\npromptly left school, as her own personal part in the general rebellion,\r\nand refused to return or even to listen to her parents upon the subject.\r\nHaving been taught by Shelley, she threw herself upon his protection; and\r\nthis unbalanced couple were presently married, as they said, \"in deference\r\nto anarch custom.\" The two infants had already proclaimed a rebellion\r\nagainst the institution of marriage, for which they proposed to substitute\r\nthe doctrine of elective affinity. For two years they wandered about\r\nEngland, Ireland, and Wales, living on a small allowance from Shelley's\r\nfather, who had disinherited his son because of his ill-considered\r\nmarriage. The pair soon separated, and two years later Shelley, having\r\nformed a strong friendship with one Godwin,--a leader of young enthusiasts\r\nand a preacher of anarchy,--presently showed his belief in Godwin's\r\ntheories by eloping with his daughter Mary. It is a sad story, and the\r\ndetails were perhaps better forgotten. We should remember that in Shelley\r\nwe are dealing with a tragic blend of high-mindedness and light-headedness.\r\nByron wrote of him, \"The most gentle, the most amiable, and the least\r\nworldly-minded person I ever met!\"\r\n\r\nLed partly by the general hostility against him, and partly by his own\r\ndelicate health, Shelley went to Italy in 1818, and never returned to\r\nEngland. After wandering over Italy he finally settled in Pisa, beloved of\r\nso many English poets,--beautiful, sleepy Pisa, where one looks out of his\r\nwindow on the main street at the busiest hour of the day, and the only\r\nliving thing in sight is a donkey, dozing lazily, with his head in the\r\nshade and his body in the sunshine. Here his best poetry was written, and\r\nhere he found comfort in the friendship of Byron, Hunt, and Trelawney, who\r\nare forever associated with Shelley's Italian life. He still remained\r\nhostile to English social institutions; but life is a good teacher, and\r\nthat Shelley dimly recognized the error of his rebellion is shown in the\r\nincreasing sadness of his later poems:\r\n\r\n    O world, O life, O time!\r\n    On whose last steps I climb,\r\n      Trembling at that where I had stood before;\r\n    When will return the glory of your prime?\r\n      No more--oh, never more!\r\n    Out of the day and night\r\n    A joy has taken flight;\r\n      Fresh spring, and summer, and winter hoar,\r\n    Move my faint heart with grief, but with delight\r\n      No more--oh, never more!\r\n\r\nIn 1822, when only thirty years of age, Shelley was drowned while sailing\r\nin a small boat off the Italian coast. His body was washed ashore several\r\ndays later, and was cremated, near Viareggio, by his friends, Byron, Hunt,\r\nand Trelawney. His ashes might, with all reverence, have been given to the\r\nwinds that he loved and that were a symbol of his restless spirit; instead,\r\nthey found a resting place near the grave of Keats, in the English cemetery\r\nat Rome. One rarely visits the spot now without finding English and\r\nAmerican visitors standing in silence before the significant inscription,\r\n_Cor Cordium_.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF SHELLEY. As a lyric poet, Shelley is one of the supreme geniuses\r\nof our literature; and the reader will do well to begin with the poems\r\nwhich show him at his very best. \"The Cloud,\" \"To a Skylark,\" \"Ode to the\r\nWest Wind,\" \"To Night,\"--poems like these must surely set the reader to\r\nsearching among Shelley's miscellaneous works, to find for himself the\r\nthings \"worthy to be remembered.\"\r\n\r\nIn reading Shelley's longer poems one must remember that there are in this\r\npoet two distinct men: one, the wanderer, seeking ideal beauty and forever\r\nunsatisfied; the other, the unbalanced reformer, seeking the overthrow of\r\npresent institutions and the establishment of universal happiness.\r\n_Alastor, or the Spirit of Solitude_ (1816) is by far the best expression\r\nof Shelley's greater mood. Here we see him wandering restlessly through the\r\nvast silences of nature, in search of a loved dream-maiden who shall\r\nsatisfy his love of beauty. Here Shelley is the poet of the moonrise, and\r\nof the tender exquisite fancies that can never be expressed. The charm of\r\nthe poem lies in its succession of dreamlike pictures; but it gives\r\nabsolutely no impressions of reality. It was written when Shelley, after\r\nhis long struggle, had begun to realize that the world was too strong for\r\nhim. _Alastor_ is therefore the poet's confession, not simply of failure,\r\nbut of undying hope in some better thing that is to come.\r\n\r\n_Prometheus Unbound_ (1818-1820), a lyrical drama, is the best work of\r\nShelley's revolutionary enthusiasm, and the most characteristic of all his\r\npoems. Shelley's philosophy (if one may dignify a hopeless dream by such a\r\nname) was a curious aftergrowth of the French Revolution, namely, that it\r\nis only the existing tyranny of State, Church, and society which keeps man\r\nfrom growth into perfect happiness. Naturally Shelley forgot, like many\r\nother enthusiasts, that Church and State and social laws were not imposed\r\nupon man from without, but were created by himself to minister to his\r\nnecessities. In Shelley's poem the hero, Prometheus, represents mankind\r\nitself,--a just and noble humanity, chained and tortured by Jove, who is\r\nhere the personification of human institutions.[228] In due time Demogorgon\r\n(which is Shelley's name for Necessity) overthrows the tyrant Jove and\r\nreleases Prometheus (Mankind), who is presently united to Asia, the spirit\r\nof love and goodness in nature, while the earth and the moon join in a\r\nwedding song, and everything gives promise that they shall live together\r\nhappy ever afterwards.\r\n\r\nShelley here looks forward, not back, to the Golden Age, and is the prophet\r\nof science and evolution. If we compare his Titan with similar characters\r\nin _Faust_ and _Cain_, we shall find this interesting difference,--that\r\nwhile Goethe's Titan is cultured and self-reliant, and Byron's stoic and\r\nhopeless, Shelley's hero is patient under torture, seeing help and hope\r\nbeyond his suffering. And he marries Love that the earth may be peopled\r\nwith superior beings who shall substitute brotherly love for the present\r\nlaws and conventions of society. Such is his philosophy; but the beginner\r\nwill read this poem, not chiefly for its thought, but for its youthful\r\nenthusiasm, for its marvelous imagery, and especially for its ethereal\r\nmusic. Perhaps we should add here that _Prometheus_ is, and probably always\r\nwill be, a poem for the chosen few who can appreciate its peculiar\r\nspiritlike beauty. In its purely pagan conception of the world, it\r\nsuggests, by contrast, Milton's Christian philosophy in _Paradise\r\nRegained_.\r\n\r\nShelley's revolutionary works, _Queen Mab_ (1813), _The Revolt of Islam_\r\n(1818), _Hellas_ (1821), and _The Witch of Atlas_ (1820), are to be judged\r\nin much the same way as is _Prometheus Unbound_. They are largely\r\ninvectives against religion, marriage, kingcraft, and priestcraft, most\r\nimpractical when considered as schemes for reform, but abounding in\r\npassages of exquisite beauty, for which alone they are worth reading. In\r\nthe drama called _The Cenci_ (1819), which is founded upon a morbid Italian\r\nstory, Shelley for the first and only time descends to reality. The\r\nheroine, Beatrice, driven to desperation by the monstrous wickedness of her\r\nfather, kills him and suffers the death penalty in consequence. She is the\r\nonly one of Shelley's characters who seems to us entirely human.\r\n\r\nFar different in character is _Epipsychidion_ (1821), a rhapsody\r\ncelebrating Platonic love, the most impalpable, and so one of the most\r\ncharacteristic, of all Shelley's works. It was inspired by a beautiful\r\nItalian girl, Emilia Viviani, who was put into a cloister against her will,\r\nand in whom Shelley imagined he found his long-sought ideal of womanhood.\r\nWith this should be read _Adonais_ (1821), the best known of all Shelley's\r\nlonger poems. _Adonais_ is a wonderful threnody, or a song of grief, over\r\nthe death of the poet Keats. Even in his grief Shelley still preserves a\r\nsense of unreality, and calls in many shadowy allegorical figures,--Sad\r\nSpring, Weeping Hours, Glooms, Splendors, Destinies,--all uniting in\r\nbewailing the loss of a loved one. The whole poem is a succession of dream\r\npictures, exquisitely beautiful, such as only Shelley could imagine; and it\r\nholds its place with Milton's _Lycidas_ and Tennyson's _In Memoriam_ as one\r\nof the three greatest elegies in our language.\r\n\r\nIn his interpretation of nature Shelley suggests Wordsworth, both by\r\nresemblance and by contrast. To both poets all natural objects are symbols\r\nof truth; both regard nature as permeated by the great spiritual life which\r\nanimates all things; but while Wordsworth finds a spirit of thought, and so\r\nof communion between nature and the soul of man, Shelley finds a spirit of\r\nlove, which exists chiefly for its own delight; and so \"The Cloud,\" \"The\r\nSkylark,\" and \"The West Wind,\" three of the most beautiful poems in our\r\nlanguage, have no definite message for humanity. In his \"Hymn to\r\nIntellectual Beauty\" Shelley is most like Wordsworth; but in his \"Sensitive\r\nPlant,\" with its fine symbolism and imagery, he is like nobody in the world\r\nbut himself. Comparison is sometimes an excellent thing; and if we compare\r\nShelley's exquisite \"Lament,\" beginning \"O world, O life, O time,\" with\r\nWordsworth's \"Intimations of Immortality,\" we shall perhaps understand both\r\npoets better. Both poems recall many happy memories of youth; both express\r\na very real mood of a moment; but while the beauty of one merely saddens\r\nand disheartens us, the beauty of the other inspires us with something of\r\nthe poet's own faith and hopefulness. In a word, Wordsworth found and\r\nShelley lost himself in nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN KEATS (1795-1821)\r\n\r\nKeats was not only the last but also the most perfect of the Romanticists.\r\nWhile Scott was merely telling stories, and Wordsworth reforming poetry or\r\nupholding the moral law, and Shelley advocating impossible reforms, and\r\nByron voicing his own egoism and the political discontent of the times,\r\nKeats lived apart from men and from all political measures, worshiping\r\nbeauty like a devotee, perfectly content to write what was in his own\r\nheart, or to reflect some splendor of the natural world as he saw or\r\ndreamed it to be. He had, moreover, the novel idea that poetry exists for\r\nits own sake, and suffers loss by being devoted to philosophy or politics\r\nor, indeed, to any cause, however great or small. As he says in \"Lamia\":\r\n\r\n                ... Do not all charms fly\r\n    At the mere touch of cold philosophy?\r\n    There was an awful rainbow once in heaven:\r\n    We know her woof, her texture; she is given\r\n    In the dull catalogue of common things.\r\n    Philosophy will clip an Angel's wings,\r\n    Conquer all mysteries by rule and line,\r\n    Empty the haunted air, and gnomed mine--\r\n    Unweave a rainbow, as it erewhile made\r\n    The tender-person'd Lamia melt into a shade.\r\n\r\nPartly because of this high ideal of poetry, partly because he studied and\r\nunconsciously imitated the Greek classics and the best works of the\r\nElizabethans, Keats's last little volume of poetry is unequaled by the work\r\nof any of his contemporaries. When we remember that all his work was\r\npublished in three short years, from 1817 to 1820, and that he died when\r\nonly twenty-five years old, we must judge him to be the most promising\r\nfigure of the early nineteenth century, and one of the most remarkable in\r\nthe history of literature.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Keats's life of devotion to beauty and to poetry is all the more\r\nremarkable in view of his lowly origin. He was the son of a hostler and\r\nstable keeper, and was born in the stable of the Swan and Hoop Inn, London,\r\nin 1795. One has only to read the rough stable scenes from our first\r\nnovelists, or even from Dickens, to understand how little there was in such\r\nan atmosphere to develop poetic gifts. Before Keats was fifteen years old\r\nboth parents died, and he was placed with his brothers and sisters in\r\ncharge of guardians. Their first act seems to have been to take Keats from\r\nschool at Enfield, and to bind him as an apprentice to a surgeon at\r\nEdmonton. For five years he served his apprenticeship, and for two years\r\nmore he was surgeon's helper in the hospitals; but though skillful enough\r\nto win approval, he disliked his work, and his thoughts were on other\r\nthings. \"The other day, during a lecture,\" he said to a friend, \"there came\r\na sunbeam into the room, and with it a whole troop of creatures floating in\r\nthe ray; and I was off with them to Oberon and fairyland.\" A copy of\r\nSpenser's _Faery Queen_, which had been given him by Charles Cowden Clark,\r\nwas the prime cause of his abstraction. He abandoned his profession in\r\n1817, and early in the same year published his first volume of _Poems_. It\r\nwas modest enough in spirit, as was also his second volume, _Endymion_\r\n(1818); but that did not prevent brutal attacks upon the author and his\r\nwork by the self-constituted critics of _Blackwood's Magazine_ and the\r\n_Quarterly_. It is often alleged that the poet's spirit and ambition were\r\nbroken by these attacks;[229] but Keats was a man of strong character, and\r\ninstead of quarreling with his reviewers, or being crushed by their\r\ncriticism, he went quietly to work with the idea of producing poetry that\r\nshould live forever. As Matthew Arnold says, Keats \"had flint and iron in\r\nhim\"; and in his next volume he accomplished his own purpose and silenced\r\nunfriendly criticism.\r\n\r\nFor the three years during which Keats wrote his poetry he lived chiefly in\r\nLondon and in Hampstead, but wandered at times over England and Scotland,\r\nliving for brief spaces in the Isle of Wight, in Devonshire, and in the\r\nLake district, seeking to recover his own health, and especially to restore\r\nthat of his brother. His illness began with a severe cold, but soon\r\ndeveloped into consumption; and added to this sorrow was another,--his love\r\nfor Fannie Brawne, to whom he was engaged, but whom he could not marry on\r\naccount of his poverty and growing illness. When we remember all this\r\npersonal grief and the harsh criticism of literary men, the last small\r\nvolume, _Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems_ (1820), is\r\nmost significant, as showing not only Keats's wonderful poetic gifts, but\r\nalso his beautiful and indomitable spirit. Shelley, struck by the beauty\r\nand promise of \"Hyperion,\" sent a generous invitation to the author to come\r\nto Pisa and live with him; but Keats refused, having little sympathy with\r\nShelley's revolt against society. The invitation had this effect, however,\r\nthat it turned Keats's thoughts to Italy, whither he soon went in the\r\neffort to save his life. He settled in Rome with his friend Severn, the\r\nartist, but died soon after his arrival, in February, 1821. His grave, in\r\nthe Protestant cemetery at Rome, is still an object of pilgrimage to\r\nthousands of tourists; for among all our poets there is hardly another\r\nwhose heroic life and tragic death have so appealed to the hearts of poets\r\nand young enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nTHE WORK OF KEATS. \"None but the master shall praise us; and none but the\r\nmaster shall blame\" might well be written on the fly leaf of every volume\r\nof Keats's poetry; for never was there a poet more devoted to his ideal,\r\nentirely independent of success or failure. In strong contrast with his\r\ncontemporary, Byron, who professed to despise the art that made him famous,\r\nKeats lived for poetry alone, and, as Lowell pointed out, a virtue went out\r\nof him into everything he wrote. In all his work we have the impression of\r\nthis intense loyalty to his art; we have the impression also of a profound\r\ndissatisfaction that the deed falls so far short of the splendid dream.\r\nThus after reading Chapman's translation of Homer he writes:\r\n\r\n    Much have I travelled in the realms of gold,\r\n    And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;\r\n    Round many western islands have I been\r\n    Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.\r\n    Oft of one wide expanse had I been told\r\n    That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne;\r\n    Yet did I never breathe its pure serene\r\n    Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:\r\n    Then felt I like some watcher of the skies\r\n    When a new planet swims into his ken;\r\n    Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes\r\n    He stared at the Pacific--and all his men\r\n    Looked at each other with a wild surmise--\r\n    Silent, upon a peak in Darien.\r\n\r\nIn this striking sonnet we have a suggestion of Keats's high ideal, and of\r\nhis sadness because of his own ignorance, when he published his first\r\nlittle volume of poems in 1817. He knew no Greek; yet Greek literature\r\nabsorbed and fascinated him, as he saw its broken and imperfect reflection\r\nin an English translation. Like Shakespeare, who also was but poorly\r\neducated in the schools, he had a marvelous faculty of discerning the real\r\nspirit of the classics,--a faculty denied to many great scholars, and to\r\nmost of the \"classic\" writers of the preceding century,--and so he set\r\nhimself to the task of reflecting in modern English the spirit of the old\r\nGreeks.\r\n\r\nThe imperfect results of this attempt are seen in his next volume,\r\n_Endymion_, which is the story of a young shepherd beloved by a moon\r\ngoddess. The poem begins with the striking lines:\r\n\r\n    A thing of beauty is a joy forever;\r\n    Its loveliness increases; it will never\r\n    Pass into nothingness; but still will keep\r\n    A bower quiet for us; and a sleep\r\n    Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing,\r\n\r\nwhich well illustrate the spirit of Keats's later work, with its perfect\r\nfinish and melody. It has many quotable lines and passages, and its \"Hymn\r\nto Pan\" should be read in connection with Wordsworth's famous sonnet\r\nbeginning, \"The world is too much with us.\" The poem gives splendid\r\npromise, but as a whole it is rather chaotic, with too much ornament and\r\ntoo little design, like a modern house. That Keats felt this defect\r\nstrongly is evident from his modest preface, wherein he speaks of\r\n_Endymion_, not as a deed accomplished, but only as an unsuccessful attempt\r\nto suggest the underlying beauty of Greek mythology.\r\n\r\nKeats's third and last volume, _Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes, and\r\nOther Poems_ (1820), is the one with which the reader should begin his\r\nacquaintance with this master of English verse. It has only two subjects,\r\nGreek mythology and mediæval romance. \"Hyperion\" is a magnificent fragment,\r\nsuggesting the first arch of a cathedral that was never finished. Its theme\r\nis the overthrow of the Titans by the young sun-god Apollo. Realizing his\r\nown immaturity and lack of knowledge, Keats laid aside this work, and only\r\nthe pleadings of his publisher induced him to print the fragment with his\r\ncompleted poems.\r\n\r\nThroughout this last volume, and especially in \"Hyperion,\" the influence of\r\nMilton is apparent, while Spenser is more frequently suggested in reading\r\n_Endymion_.\r\n\r\nOf the longer poems in the volume, \"Lamia\" is the most suggestive. It is\r\nthe story of a beautiful enchantress, who turns from a serpent into a\r\nglorious woman and fills every human sense with delight, until, as a result\r\nof the foolish philosophy of old Apollonius, she vanishes forever from her\r\nlover's sight. \"The Eve of St. Agnes,\" the most perfect of Keats's mediæval\r\npoems, is not a story after the manner of the metrical romances, but rather\r\na vivid painting of a romantic mood, such as comes to all men, at times, to\r\nglorify a workaday world. Like all the work of Keats and Shelley, it has an\r\nelement of unreality; and when we read at the end,\r\n\r\n    And they are gone; aye, ages long ago\r\n    These lovers fled away into the storm,\r\n\r\nit is as if we were waking from a dream,--which is the only possible ending\r\nto all of Keats's Greek and mediæval fancies. We are to remember, however,\r\nthat no beautiful thing, though it be intangible as a dream, can enter a\r\nman's life and leave him quite the same afterwards. Keats's own word is\r\nhere suggestive. \"The imagination,\" he said, \"may be likened to Adam's\r\ndream; he awoke and found it true.\"\r\n\r\nIt is by his short poems that Keats is known to the majority of present-day\r\nreaders. Among these exquisite shorter poems we mention only the four odes,\r\n\"On a Grecian Urn,\" \"To a Nightingale,\" \"To Autumn,\" and \"To Psyche.\" These\r\nare like an invitation to a feast; one who reads them will hardly be\r\nsatisfied until he knows more of such delightful poetry. Those who study\r\nonly the \"Ode to a Nightingale\" may find four things,--a love of sensuous\r\nbeauty, a touch of pessimism, a purely pagan conception of nature, and a\r\nstrong individualism,--which are characteristic of this last of the\r\nromantic poets.\r\n\r\nAs Wordsworth's work is too often marred by the moralizer, and Byron's by\r\nthe demagogue, and Shelley's by the reformer, so Keats's work suffers by\r\nthe opposite extreme of aloofness from every human interest; so much so,\r\nthat he is often accused of being indifferent to humanity. His work is also\r\ncriticised as being too effeminate for ordinary readers. Three things\r\nshould be remembered in this connection. First, that Keats sought to\r\nexpress beauty for its own sake; that beauty is as essential to normal\r\nhumanity as is government or law; and that the higher man climbs in\r\ncivilization the more imperative becomes his need of beauty as a reward for\r\nhis labors. Second, that Keats's letters are as much an indication of the\r\nman as is his poetry; and in his letters, with their human sympathy, their\r\neager interest in social problems, their humor, and their keen insight into\r\nlife, there is no trace of effeminacy, but rather every indication of a\r\nstrong and noble manhood. The third thing to remember is that all Keats's\r\nwork was done in three or four years, with small preparation, and that,\r\ndying at twenty-five, he left us a body of poetry which will always be one\r\nof our most cherished possessions. He is often compared with \"the marvelous\r\nboy\" Chatterton, whom he greatly admired, and to whose memory he dedicated\r\nhis _Endymion_; but though both died young, Chatterton was but a child,\r\nwhile Keats was in all respects a man. It is idle to prophesy what he might\r\nhave done, had he been granted a Tennyson's long life and scholarly\r\ntraining. At twenty five his work was as mature as was Tennyson's at fifty,\r\nthough the maturity suggests the too rapid growth of a tropical plant which\r\nunder the warm rains and the flood of sunlight leaps into life, grows,\r\nblooms in a day, and dies.\r\n\r\nAs we have stated, Keats's work was bitterly and unjustly condemned by the\r\ncritics of his day. He belonged to what was derisively called the cockney\r\nschool of poetry, of which Leigh Hunt was chief, and Proctor and Beddoes\r\nwere fellow-workmen. Not even from Wordsworth and Byron, who were ready\r\nenough to recommend far less gifted writers, did Keats receive the\r\nslightest encouragement. Like young Lochinvar, \"he rode all unarmed and he\r\nrode all alone.\" Shelley, with his sincerity and generosity, was the first\r\nto recognize the young genius, and in his noble _Adonais_--written, alas,\r\nlike most of our tributes, when the subject of our praise is dead--he spoke\r\nthe first true word of appreciation, and placed Keats, where he\r\nunquestionably belongs, among our greatest poets. The fame denied him in\r\nhis sad life was granted freely after his death. Most fitly does he close\r\nthe list of poets of the romantic revival, because in many respects he was\r\nthe best workman of them all. He seems to have studied words more carefully\r\nthan did his contemporaries, and so his poetic expression, or the harmony\r\nof word and thought, is generally more perfect than theirs. More than any\r\nother he lived for poetry, as the noblest of the arts. More than any other\r\nhe emphasized beauty, because to him, as shown by his \"Grecian Urn,\" beauty\r\nand truth were one and inseparable. And he enriched the whole romantic\r\nmovement by adding to its interest in common life the spirit, rather than\r\nthe letter, of the classics and of Elizabethan poetry. For these reasons\r\nKeats is, like Spenser, a poet's poet; his work profoundly influenced\r\nTennyson and, indeed, most of the poets of the present era.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. PROSE WRITERS OF THE ROMANTIC PERIOD\r\n\r\nAside from the splendid work of the novel writers--Walter Scott, whom we\r\nhave considered, and Jane Austen, to whom we shall presently return--the\r\nearly nineteenth century is remarkable for the development of a new and\r\nvaluable type of critical prose writing. If we except the isolated work of\r\nDryden and of Addison, it is safe to say that literary criticism, in its\r\nmodern sense, was hardly known in England until about the year 1825. Such\r\ncriticism as existed seems to us now to have been largely the result of\r\npersonal opinion or prejudice. Indeed we could hardly expect anything else\r\nbefore some systematic study of our literature as a whole had been\r\nattempted. In one age a poem was called good or bad according as it\r\nfollowed or ran counter to so-called classic rules; in another we have the\r\ndogmatism of Dr. Johnson; in a third the personal judgment of Lockhart and\r\nthe editors of the _Edinburgh Review_ and the _Quarterly_, who so violently\r\nabused Keats and the Lake poets in the name of criticism. Early in the\r\nnineteenth century there arose a new school of criticism which was guided\r\nby knowledge of literature, on the one hand, and by what one might call the\r\nfear of God on the other. The latter element showed itself in a profound\r\nhuman sympathy,--the essence of the romantic movement,--and its importance\r\nwas summed up by De Quincey when he said, \"Not to sympathize is not to\r\nunderstand.\" These new critics, with abundant reverence for past masters,\r\ncould still lay aside the dogmatism and prejudice which marked Johnson and\r\nthe magazine editors, and read sympathetically the work of a new author,\r\nwith the sole idea of finding what he had contributed, or tried to\r\ncontribute, to the magnificent total of our literature. Coleridge, Hunt,\r\nHazlitt, Lamb, and De Quincey were the leaders in this new and immensely\r\nimportant development; and we must not forget the importance of the new\r\nperiodicals, like the _Londen Magazine,_ founded in 1820, in which Lamb, De\r\nQuincey, and Carlyle found their first real encouragement.\r\n\r\nOf Coleridge's _Biographica Literaria_ and his _Lectures on Shakespeare_ we\r\nhave already spoken. Leigh Hunt (1784-1859) wrote continuously for more\r\nthan thirty years, as editor and essayist; and his chief object seems to\r\nhave been to make good literature known and appreciated. William Hazlitt\r\n(1778-1830), in a long series of lectures and essays, treated all reading\r\nas a kind of romantic journey into new and pleasant countries. To his work\r\nlargely, with that of Lamb, was due the new interest in Elizabethan\r\nliterature, which so strongly influenced Keats's last and best volume of\r\npoetry. For those interested in the art of criticism, and in the\r\nappreciation of literature, both Hunt and Hazlitt will well repay study;\r\nbut we must pass over their work to consider the larger literary interest\r\nof Lamb and De Quincey, who were not simply critics of other men's labor,\r\nbut who also produced some delightful work of their own, which the world\r\nhas carefully put away among the \"things worthy to be remembered.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES LAMB (1775-1834)\r\n\r\nIn Lamb and Wordsworth we have two widely different views of the romantic\r\nmovement; one shows the influence of nature and solitude, the other of\r\nsociety. Lamb was a lifelong friend of Coleridge, and an admirer and\r\ndefender of the poetic creed of Wordsworth; but while the latter lived\r\napart from men, content with nature and with reading an occasional moral\r\nlesson to society, Lamb was born and lived in the midst of the London\r\nstreets. The city crowd, with its pleasures and occupations, its endless\r\nlittle comedies and tragedies, alone interested him. According to his own\r\naccount, when he paused in the crowded street tears would spring to his\r\neyes,--tears of pure pleasure at the abundance of so much good life; and\r\nwhen he wrote, he simply interpreted that crowded human life of joy and\r\nsorrow, as Wordsworth interpreted the woods and waters, without any desire\r\nto change or to reform them. He has given us the best pictures we possess\r\nof Coleridge, Hazlitt, Landor, Hood, Cowden Clarke, and many more of the\r\ninteresting men and women of his age; and it is due to his insight and\r\nsympathy that the life of those far-off days seems almost as real to us as\r\nif we ourselves remembered it. Of all our English essayists he is the most\r\nlovable; partly because of his delicate, old-fashioned style and humor, but\r\nmore because of that cheery and heroic struggle against misfortune which\r\nshines like a subdued light in all his writings.\r\n\r\nLIFE. In the very heart of London there is a curious, old-fashioned place\r\nknown as the Temple,--an enormous, rambling, apparently forgotten\r\nstructure, dusty and still, in the midst of the endless roar of the city\r\nstreets. Originally it was a chapter house of the Knights Templars, and so\r\nsuggests to us the spirit of the Crusades and of the Middle Ages; but now\r\nthe building is given over almost entirely to the offices and lodgings of\r\nLondon lawyers. It is this queer old place which, more than all others, is\r\nassociated with the name of Charles Lamb. \"I was born,\" he says, \"and\r\npassed the first seven years of my life in the Temple. Its gardens, its\r\nhalls, its fountain, its river... these are my oldest recollections.\" He\r\nwas the son of a poor clerk, or rather servant, of one of the barristers,\r\nand was the youngest of seven children, only three of whom survived\r\ninfancy. Of these three, John, the elder, was apparently a selfish\r\ncreature, who took no part in the heroic struggle of his brother and\r\nsister. At seven years, Charles was sent to the famous \"Bluecoat\" charity\r\nschool of Christ's Hospital. Here he remained seven years; and here he\r\nformed his lifelong friendship for another poor, neglected boy, whom the\r\nworld remembers as Coleridge.[230]\r\n\r\nWhen only fourteen years old, Lamb left the charity school and was soon at\r\nwork as a clerk in the South Sea House. Two years later he became a clerk\r\nin the famous India House, where he worked steadily for thirty-three years,\r\nwith the exception of six weeks, in the winter of 1795-1796, spent within\r\nthe walls of an asylum. In 1796 Lamb's sister Mary, who was as talented and\r\nremarkable as Lamb himself, went violently insane and killed her own\r\nmother. For a long time after this appalling tragedy she was in an asylum\r\nat Hoxton; then Lamb, in 1797, brought her to his own little house, and for\r\nthe remainder of his life cared for her with a tenderness and devotion\r\nwhich furnishes one of the most beautiful pages in our literary history. At\r\ntimes the malady would return to Mary, giving sure warning of its terrible\r\napproach; and then brother and sister might be seen walking silently, hand\r\nin hand, to the gates of the asylum, their cheeks wet with tears. One must\r\nremember this, as well as Lamb's humble lodgings and the drudgery of his\r\ndaily work in the-big commercial house, if he would appreciate the pathos\r\nof \"The Old Familiar Faces,\" or the heroism which shines through the most\r\nhuman and the most delightful essays in our language.\r\n\r\nWhen Lamb was fifty years of age the East India Company, led partly by his\r\nliterary fame following his first _Essays of Elia_, and partly by his\r\nthirty-three years of faithful service, granted him a comfortable pension;\r\nand happy as a boy turned loose from school he left India House forever to\r\ngive himself up to literary work.[231] He wrote to Wordsworth, in April,\r\n1825, \"I came home _forever_ on Tuesday of last week--it was like passing\r\nfrom life into eternity.\" Curiously enough Lamb seems to lose power after\r\nhis release from drudgery, and his last essays, published in 1833, lack\r\nsomething of the grace and charm of his earlier work. He died at Edmonton\r\nin 1834; and his gifted sister Mary sank rapidly into the gulf from which\r\nhis strength and gentleness had so long held her back. No literary man was\r\never more loved and honored by a rare circle of friends; and all who knew\r\nhim bear witness to the simplicity and goodness which any reader may find\r\nfor himself between the lines of his essays.\r\n\r\nWORKS. The works of Lamb divide themselves naturally into three periods.\r\nFirst, there are his early literary efforts, including the poems signed \"C.\r\nL.\" in Coleridge's _Poems on Various Subjects_ (1796); his romance\r\n_Rosamund Gray_ (1798); his poetical drama _John Woodvil_ (1802); and\r\nvarious other immature works in prose and poetry. This period comes to an\r\nend in 1803, when he gave up his newspaper work, especially the\r\ncontribution of six jokes, puns, and squibs daily to the _Morning Post_ at\r\nsixpence apiece. The second period was given largely to literary criticism;\r\nand the _Tales from Shakespeare_ (1807)--written by Charles and Mary Lamb,\r\nthe former reproducing the tragedies, and the latter the comedies--may be\r\nregarded as his first successful literary venture. The book was written\r\nprimarily for children; but so thoroughly had brother and sister steeped\r\nthemselves in the literature of the Elizabethan period that young and old\r\nalike were delighted with this new version of Shakespeare's stories, and\r\nthe _Tales_ are still regarded as the best of their kind in our literature.\r\nIn 1808 appeared his _Specimens of English Dramatic Poets Contemporary with\r\nShakespeare_. This carried out the splendid critical work of Coleridge, and\r\nwas the most noticeable influence in developing the poetic qualities of\r\nKeats, as shown in his last volume.\r\n\r\nThe third period includes Lamb's criticisms of life, which are gathered\r\ntogether in his _Essays of Elia_ (1823), and his _Last Essays of Elia_,\r\nwhich were published ten years later. These famous essays began in 1820\r\nwith the appearance of the new _London Magazine_[232] and were continued\r\nfor many years, such subjects as the \"Dissertation on Roast Pig,\" \"Old\r\nChina,\" \"Praise of Chimney Sweepers,\" \"Imperfect Sympathies,\" \"A Chapter on\r\nEars,\" \"Mrs. Battle's Opinions on Whist,\" \"Mackery End,\" \"Grace Before\r\nMeat,\" \"Dream Children,\" and many others being chosen apparently at random,\r\nbut all leading to a delightful interpretation of the life of London, as it\r\nappeared to a quiet little man who walked unnoticed through its crowded\r\nstreets. In the first and last essays which we have mentioned,\r\n\"Dissertation on Roast Pig\" and \"Dream Children,\" we have the extremes of\r\nLamb's humor and pathos.\r\n\r\nThe style of all these essays is gentle, old-fashioned, irresistibly\r\nattractive. Lamb was especially fond of old writers and borrowed\r\nunconsciously from the style of Burton's _Anatomy of Melancholy_ and from\r\nBrowne's _Religio Medici_ and from the early English dramatists. But this\r\nstyle had become a part of Lamb by long reading, and he was apparently\r\nunable to express his new thought without using their old quaint\r\nexpressions. Though these essays are all criticisms or appreciations of the\r\nlife of his age, they are all intensely personal. In other words, they are\r\nan excellent picture of Lamb and of humanity. Without a trace of vanity or\r\nself-assertion, Lamb begins with himself, with some purely personal mood or\r\nexperience, and from this he leads the reader to see life and literature as\r\nhe saw it. It is this wonderful combination of personal and universal\r\ninterests, together with Lamb's rare old style and quaint humor, which make\r\nthe essays remarkable. They continue the best tradition of Addison and\r\nSteele, our first great essayists; but their sympathies are broader and\r\ndeeper, and their humor more delicious than any which preceded them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS DE QUINCY (1785-1859)\r\n\r\nIn De Quincey the romantic element is even more strongly developed than in\r\nLamb, not only in his critical work, but also in his erratic and\r\nimaginative life. He was profoundly educated, even more so than Coleridge,\r\nand was one of the keenest intellects of the age; yet his wonderful\r\nintellect seems always subordinate to his passion for dreaming. Like Lamb,\r\nhe was a friend and associate of the Lake poets, making his headquarters in\r\nWordsworth's old cottage at Grasmere for nearly twenty years. Here the\r\nresemblance ceases, and a marked contrast begins. As a man, Lamb is the\r\nmost human and lovable of all our essayists; while De Quincey is the most\r\nuncanny and incomprehensible. Lamb's modest works breathe the two essential\r\nqualities of sympathy and humor; the greater number of De Quincey's essays,\r\nwhile possessing more or less of both these qualities, are characterized\r\nchiefly by their brilliant style. Life, as seen through De Quincey's eyes,\r\nis nebulous and chaotic, and there is a suspicion of the fabulous in all\r\nthat he wrote. Even in _The Revolt of the Tartars_ the romantic element is\r\nuppermost, and in much of De Quincey's prose the element of unreality is\r\nmore noticeable than in Shelley's poetry. Of his subject-matter, his facts,\r\nideas, and criticisms, we are generally suspicious; but of his style,\r\nsometimes stately and sometimes headlong, now gorgeous as an Oriental\r\ndream, now musical as Keats's _Endymion_, and always, even in the most\r\nviolent contrasts, showing a harmony between the idea and the expression\r\nsuch as no other English writer, with the possible exception of Newman, has\r\never rivaled,--say what you will of the marvelous brilliancy of De\r\nQuincey's style, you have still only half expressed the truth. It is the\r\nstyle alone which makes these essays immortal.\r\n\r\nLIFE. De Quincey was born in Manchester in 1785. In neither his father, who\r\nwas a prosperous merchant, nor his mother, who was a quiet, unsympathetic\r\nwoman, do we see any suggestion of the son's almost uncanny genius. As a\r\nchild he was given to dreams, more vivid and intense but less beautiful\r\nthan those of the young Blake to whom he bears a strong resemblance. In the\r\ngrammar school at Bath he displayed astonishing ability, and acquired Greek\r\nand Latin with a rapidity that frightened his slow tutors. At fifteen he\r\nnot only read Greek, but spoke it fluently; and one of his astounded\r\nteachers remarked, \"That boy could harangue an Athenian mob better than you\r\nor I could address an English one.\" From the grammar school at Manchester,\r\nwhither he was sent in 1800, he soon ran away, finding the instruction far\r\nbelow his abilities, and the rough life absolutely intolerable to his\r\nsensitive nature. An uncle, just home from India, interceded for the boy\r\nlest he be sent back to the school, which he hated; and with an allowance\r\nof a guinea a week he started a career of vagrancy, much like that of\r\nGoldsmith, living on the open hills, in the huts of shepherds and charcoal\r\nburners, in the tents of gypsies, wherever fancy led him. His fear of the\r\nManchester school finally led him to run away to London, where, without\r\nmoney or friends, his life was even more extraordinary than his gypsy\r\nwanderings. The details of this vagrancy are best learned in his\r\n_Confessions of an English Opium-Eater_, where we meet not simply the facts\r\nof his life, but also the confusion of dreams and fancies in the midst of\r\nwhich he wandered like a man lost on the mountains, with storm clouds under\r\nhis feet hiding the familiar earth. After a year of vagrancy and starvation\r\nhe was found by his family and allowed to go to Oxford, where his career\r\nwas marked by the most brilliant and erratic scholarship. When ready for a\r\ndegree, in 1807, he passed his written tests successfully, but felt a\r\nsudden terror at the thought of the oral examination and disappeared from\r\nthe university, never to return.\r\n\r\nIt was in Oxford that De Quincey began the use of opium; to relieve the\r\npains of neuralgia, and the habit increased until he was an almost hopeless\r\nslave to the drug. Only his extraordinary will power enabled him to break\r\naway from the habit, after some thirty years of misery. Some peculiarity of\r\nhis delicate constitution enabled De Quincey to take enormous quantities of\r\nopium, enough to kill several ordinary men; and it was largely opium,\r\nworking upon a sensitive imagination, which produced his gorgeous dreams,\r\nbroken by intervals of weakness and profound depression. For twenty years\r\nhe resided at Grasmere in the companionship of the Lake poets; and here,\r\nled by the loss of his small fortune, he began to write, with the idea of\r\nsupporting his family. In 1821 he published his first famous work, the\r\n_Confessions of an English Opium-Eater_, and for nearly forty years\r\nafterwards he wrote industriously, contributing to various magazines an\r\nastonishing number of essays on a great variety of subjects. Without\r\nthought of literary fame, he contributed these articles anonymously; but\r\nfortunately, in 1853, he began to collect his own works, and the last of\r\nfourteen volumes was published just after his death.\r\n\r\nIn 1830, led by his connection with _Blackwood's Magazine_, to which he was\r\nthe chief contributor, De Quincey removed with his family to Edinburgh,\r\nwhere his erratic genius and his singularly childlike ways produced enough\r\namusing anecdotes to fill a volume. He would take a room in some place\r\nunknown to his friends and family; would live in it for a few years, until\r\nhe had filled it, even to the bath tub, with books and with his own chaotic\r\nmanuscripts, allowing no one to enter or disturb his den; and then, when\r\nthe place became too crowded, he would lock the door and go away and take\r\nanother lodging, where he repeated the same extraordinary performance. He\r\ndied in Edinburgh in 1859. Like Lamb, he was a small, boyish figure,\r\ngentle, and elaborately courteous. Though excessively shy, and escaping as\r\noften as possible to solitude, he was nevertheless fond of society, and his\r\nwide knowledge and vivid imagination made his conversations almost as\r\nprized as those of his friend Coleridge.\r\n\r\nWORKS. De Quincey's works may be divided into two general classes. The\r\nfirst includes his numerous critical articles, and the second his\r\nautobiographical sketches. All his works, it must be remembered, were\r\ncontributed to various magazines, and were hastily collected just before\r\nhis death. Hence the general impression of chaos which we get from reading\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFrom a literary view point the most illuminating of De Quincey's critical\r\nworks is his. _Literary Reminiscences_. This contains brilliant\r\nappreciations of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Lamb, Shelley, Keats, Hazlitt, and\r\nLandor, as well as some interesting studies of the literary figures of the\r\nage preceding. Among the best of his brilliant critical essays are _On the\r\nKnocking at the Gate in Macbeth_ (1823), which is admirably suited to show\r\nthe man's critical genius, and _Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts_\r\n(1827), which reveals his grotesque humor Other suggestive critical works,\r\nif one must choose among such a multitude, are his _Letters to a Young Man_\r\n(1823), _Joan of Arc_ (1847), _The Revolt of the Tartars_ (1840), and _The\r\nEnglish Mail-Coach_ (1849). In the last-named essay the \"Dream Fugue\" is\r\none of the most imaginative of all his curious works.\r\n\r\nOf De Quincey's autobiographical sketches the best known is his\r\n_Confessions of an English Opium-Eater_ (1821). This is only partly a\r\nrecord of opium dreams, and its chief interest lies in glimpses it gives us\r\nof De Quincey's own life and wanderings. This should be followed by\r\n_Suspiria de Profundis_ (1845), which is chiefly a record of gloomy and\r\nterrible dreams produced by opiates. The most interesting parts of his\r\n_Suspiria_, showing De Quincey's marvelous insight into dreams, are those\r\nin which we are brought face to face with the strange feminine creations\r\n\"Levana,\" \"Madonna,\" \"Our Lady of Sighs,\" and \"Our Lady of Darkness.\" A\r\nseries of nearly thirty articles which he collected in 1853, called\r\n_Autobiographic Sketches_, completes the revelation of the author's own\r\nlife. Among his miscellaneous works may be mentioned, in order to show his\r\nwide range of subjects, _Klosterheim_, a novel, _Logic of Political\r\nEconomy_, the _Essays on Style and Rhetoric, Philosophy of Herodotus_, and\r\nhis articles on Goethe, Pope, Schiller, and Shakespeare which he\r\ncontributed to the _Encyclopedia Britannica_.\r\n\r\nDe Quincey's style is a revelation of the beauty of the English language,\r\nand it profoundly influenced Ruskin and other prose writers of the\r\nVictorian Age. It has two chief faults,--diffuseness, which continually\r\nleads De Quincey away from his object, and triviality, which often makes\r\nhim halt in the midst of a marvelous paragraph to make some light jest or\r\nwitticism that has some humor but no mirth in it. Notwithstanding these\r\nfaults, De Quincey's prose is still among the few supreme examples of style\r\nin our language. Though he was profoundly influenced by the seventeenth-\r\ncentury writers, he attempted definitely to create a new style which should\r\ncombine the best elements of prose and poetry. In consequence, his prose\r\nworks are often, like those of Milton, more imaginative and melodious than\r\nmuch of our poetry. He has been well called \"the psychologist of style,\"\r\nand as such his works will never be popular; but to the few who can\r\nappreciate him he will always be an inspiration to better writing. One has\r\na deeper respect for our English language and literature after reading him.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY WRITERS OF ROMANTICISM. One has only to glance back over the\r\nauthors we have been studying--Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey, Byron,\r\nShelley, Keats, Scott, Lamb, De Quincey--to realize the great change which\r\nswept over the life and literature of England in a single half century,\r\nunder two influences which we now know as the French Revolution in history\r\nand the Romantic Movement in literature. In life men had rebelled against\r\nthe too strict authority of state and society; in literature they rebelled\r\neven more vigorously against the bonds of classicism, which had sternly\r\nrepressed a writer's ambition to follow his own ideals and to express them\r\nin his own way. Naturally such an age of revolution was essentially\r\npoetic,--only the Elizabethan Age surpasses it in this respect,--and it\r\nproduced a large number of minor writers, who followed more or less closely\r\nthe example of its great leaders. Among novelists we have Jane Austen,\r\nFrances Burney, Maria Edgeworth, Jane Porter, and Susan Ferrier,--all\r\nwomen, be it noted; among the poets, Campbell, Moore, Hogg (\"the Ettrick\r\nShepherd\"), Mrs. Hemans, Heber, Keble, Hood, and \"Ingoldsby\" (Richard\r\nBarham); and among miscellaneous writers, Sidney Smith, \"Christopher North\"\r\n(John Wilson), Chalmers, Lockhart, Leigh Hunt, Hazlitt, Hallam, and Landor.\r\nHere is an astonishing variety of writers, and to consider all their claims\r\nto remembrance would of itself require a volume. Though these are generally\r\nclassed as secondary writers, much of their work has claims to popularity,\r\nand some of it to permanence. Moore's _Irish Melodies_, Campbell's lyrics,\r\nKeble's _Christian Year_, and Jane Porter's _Thaddeus of Warsaw_ and\r\n_Scottish Chiefs_ have still a multitude of readers, where Keats, Lamb, and\r\nDe Quincey are prized only by the cultured few; and Hallam's historical and\r\ncritical works are perhaps better known than those of Gibbon, who\r\nnevertheless occupies a larger place in our literature. Among all these\r\nwriters we choose only two, Jane Austen and Walter Savage Landor, whose\r\nworks indicate a period of transition from the Romantic to the Victorian\r\nAge.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANE AUSTEN (1775-1817)\r\n\r\nWe have so lately rediscovered the charm and genius of this gifted young\r\nwoman that she seems to be a novelist of yesterday, rather than the\r\ncontemporary of Wordsworth and Coleridge; and few even of her readers\r\nrealize that she did for the English novel precisely what the Lake poets\r\ndid for English poetry,--she refined and simplified it, making it a true\r\nreflection of English life. Like the Lake poets, she met with scanty\r\nencouragement in her own generation. Her greatest novel, _Pride and\r\nPrejudice_, was finished in 1797, a year before the appearance of the\r\nfamous _Lyrical Ballads_ of Wordsworth and Coleridge; but while the latter\r\nbook was published and found a few appreciative readers, the manuscript of\r\nthis wonderful novel went begging for sixteen years before it found a\r\npublisher. As Wordsworth began with the deliberate purpose of making poetry\r\nnatural and truthful, so Miss Austen appears to have begun writing with the\r\nidea of presenting the life of English country society exactly as it was,\r\nin opposition to the romantic extravagance of Mrs. Radcliffe and her\r\nschool. But there was this difference,--that Miss Austen had in large\r\nmeasure the saving gift of humor, which Wordsworth sadly lacked. Maria\r\nEdgeworth, at the same time, set a sane and excellent example in her tales\r\nof Irish life, _The Absentee_ and _Castle Rackrent;_ and Miss Austen\r\nfollowed up the advantage with at least six works, which have grown\r\nsteadily in value until we place them gladly in the first rank of our\r\nnovels of common life. It is not simply for her exquisite charm, therefore,\r\nthat we admire her, but also for her influence in bringing our novels back\r\nto their true place as an expression of human life. It is due partly, at\r\nleast, to her influence that a multitude of readers were ready to\r\nappreciate Mrs. Gaskell's _Cranford_, and the powerful and enduring work of\r\nGeorge Eliot.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Jane Austen's life gives little opportunity for the biographer,\r\nunless, perchance, he has something of her own power to show the beauty and\r\ncharm of commonplace things. She was the seventh child of Rev. George\r\nAusten, rector of Steventon, and was born in the parsonage of the village\r\nin 1775. With her sisters she was educated at home, and passed her life\r\nvery quietly, cheerfully, in the doing of small domestic duties, to which\r\nlove lent the magic lamp that makes all things beautiful. She began to\r\nwrite at an early age, and seems to have done her work on a little table in\r\nthe family sitting room, in the midst of the family life. When a visitor\r\nentered, she would throw a paper or a piece of sewing over her work, and\r\nshe modestly refused to be known as the author of novels which we now count\r\namong our treasured possessions. With the publishers she had little\r\nsuccess. _Pride and Prejudice_ went begging, as we have said, for sixteen\r\nyears; and _Northanger Abbey_ (1798) was sold for a trivial sum to a\r\npublisher, who laid it aside and forgot it, until the appearance and\r\nmoderate success of _Sense and Sensibility_ in 1811. Then, after keeping\r\nthe manuscript some fifteen years, he sold it back to the family, who found\r\nanother publisher.\r\n\r\nAn anonymous article in the _Quarterly Review_, following the appearance of\r\n_Emma_ in 1815, full of generous appreciation of the charm of the new\r\nwriter, was the beginning of Jane Austen's fame; and it is only within a\r\nfew years that we have learned that the friendly and discerning critic was\r\nWalter Scott. He continued to be her admirer until her early death; but\r\nthese two, the greatest writers of fiction in their age, were never brought\r\ntogether. Both were home-loving people, and Miss Austen especially was\r\naverse to publicity and popularity. She died, quietly as she had lived, at\r\nWinchester, in 1817, and was buried in the cathedral. She was a bright,\r\nattractive little woman, whose sunny qualities are unconsciously reflected\r\nin all her books.\r\n\r\nWORKS. Very few English writers ever had so narrow a field of work as Jane\r\nAusten. Like the French novelists, whose success seems to lie in choosing\r\nthe tiny field that they know best, her works have an exquisite perfection\r\nthat is lacking in most of our writers of fiction. With the exception of an\r\noccasional visit to the watering place of Bath, her whole life was spent in\r\nsmall country parishes, whose simple country people became the characters\r\nof her novels. Her brothers were in the navy, and so naval officers furnish\r\nthe only exciting elements in her stories; but even these alleged heroes\r\nlay aside their imposing martial ways and act like themselves and other\r\npeople. Such was her literary field, in which the chief duties were of the\r\nhousehold, the chief pleasures in country gatherings, and the chief\r\ninterests in matrimony. Life, with its mighty interests, its passions,\r\nambitions, and tragic struggles, swept by like a great river; while the\r\nsecluded interests of a country parish went round and round quietly, like\r\nan eddy behind a sheltering rock. We can easily understand, therefore, the\r\nlimitations of Jane Austen; but within her own field she is unequaled. Her\r\ncharacters are absolutely true to life, and all her work has the perfection\r\nof a delicate miniature painting. The most widely read of her novels is\r\n_Pride and Prejudice;_ but three others, _Sense and Sensibility, Emma_, and\r\n_Mansfield Park_, have slowly won their way to the front rank of fiction.\r\nFrom a literary view point _Northanger Abbey_ is perhaps the best; for in\r\nit we find that touch of humor and delicate satire with which this gentle\r\nlittle woman combated the grotesque popular novels of the _Udolpho_ type.\r\nReading any of these works, one is inclined to accept the hearty\r\nindorsement of Sir Walter Scott: \"That young lady has a talent for\r\ndescribing the involvements and feelings and characters of ordinary life\r\nwhich is to me the most wonderful I ever met with. The big bowwow strain I\r\ncan do myself, like any now going; but the exquisite touch which renders\r\nordinary commonplace things and characters interesting from the truth of\r\nthe description and the sentiment, is denied to me. What a pity such a\r\ngifted creature died so early!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWALTER SAVAGE LANDOR (1775-1864)\r\n\r\nWhile Hazlitt, Lamb, De Quincey, and other romantic critics went back to\r\nearly English literature for their inspiration, Landor shows a reaction\r\nfrom the prevailing Romanticism by his imitation of the ancient classic\r\nwriters. His life was an extraordinary one and, like his work, abounded in\r\nsharp contrasts. On the one hand, there are his egoism, his unncontrollable\r\nanger, his perpetual lawsuits, and the last sad tragedy with his children,\r\nwhich suggests _King Lear_ and his daughters; on the other hand there is\r\nhis steady devotion to the classics and to the cultivation of the deep\r\nwisdom of the ancients, which suggests Pindar and Cicero. In his works we\r\nfind the wild extravagance of _Gebir_, followed by the superb classic style\r\nand charm of _Pericles and Aspasia_. Such was Landor, a man of high ideals,\r\nperpetually at war with himself and the world.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Lander's stormy life covers the whole period from Wordsworth's\r\nchildhood to the middle of the Victorian Era. He was the son of a\r\nphysician, and was born at Warwick, in 1775. From his mother he inherited a\r\nfortune; but it was soon scattered by large expenditures and law quarrels;\r\nand in his old age, refused help by his own children, only Browning's\r\ngenerosity kept Landor from actual want. At Rugby, and at Oxford, his\r\nextreme Republicanism brought him into constant trouble; and his fitting\r\nout a band of volunteers to assist the Spaniards against Napoleon, in 1808,\r\nallies him with Byron and his Quixotic followers. The resemblance to Byron\r\nis even more strikingly shown in the poem _Gebir_, published in 1798, a\r\nyear made famous by the _Lyrical Ballads_ of Wordsworth and Coleridge.\r\n\r\nA remarkable change in Lander's life is noticeable in 1821, when, at\r\nforty-six years of age, after having lost his magnificent estate of\r\nLlanthony Abbey, in Glamorganshire, and after a stormy experience in Como,\r\nhe settled down for a time at Fiesole near Florence. To this period of calm\r\nafter storm we owe the classical prose works for which he is famous. The\r\ncalm, like that at the center of a whirlwind, lasted but a short time, and\r\nLandor, leaving his family in great anger, returned to Bath, where he lived\r\nalone for more than twenty years. Then, in order to escape a libel suit,\r\nthe choleric old man fled back to Italy. He died at Florence, in 1864. The\r\nspirit of his whole life may be inferred from the defiant farewell which he\r\nflung to it:\r\n\r\n    I strove with none, for none was worth my strife;\r\n       Nature I loved, and next to Nature Art;\r\n    I warmed both hands before the fire of life;\r\n       It sinks, and I am ready to depart.\r\n\r\nWORKS. Landor's reaction from Romanticism is all the more remarkable in\r\nview of his early efforts, such as _Gebir_, a wildly romantic poem, which\r\nrivals any work of Byron or Shelley in its extravagance. Notwithstanding\r\nits occasional beautiful and suggestive lines, the work was not and never\r\nhas been successful; and the same may be said of all his poetical works.\r\nHis first collection of poems was published in 1795, his last a full half\r\ncentury later, in 1846. In the latter volume, _The Hellenics_,--which\r\nincluded some translations of his earlier Latin poems, called _Idyllia\r\nHeroica,--_one has only to read \"The Hamadryad,\" and compare it with the\r\nlyrics of the first volume, in order to realize the astonishing literary\r\nvigor of a man who published two volumes, a half century apart, without any\r\nappreciable diminution of poetical feeling. In all these poems one is\r\nimpressed by the striking and original figures of speech which Landor uses\r\nto emphasize his meaning.\r\n\r\nIt is by his prose works, largely, that Landor has won a place in our\r\nliterature; partly because of their intrinsic worth, their penetrating\r\nthought, and severe classic style; and partly because of their profound\r\ninfluence upon the writers of the present age. The most noted of his prose\r\nworks are his six volumes of _Imaginary Conversations_ (1824-1846). For\r\nthese conversations Landor brings together, sometimes in groups, sometimes\r\nin couples, well-known characters, or rather shadows, from the four corners\r\nof the earth and from the remotest ages of recorded history. Thus Diogenes\r\ntalks with Plato, Æsop with a young slave girl in Egypt, Henry VIII with\r\nAnne Boleyn in prison, Dante with Beatrice, Leofric with Lady Godiva,--all\r\nthese and many others, from Epictetus to Cromwell, are brought together and\r\nspeak of life and love and death, each from his own view point.\r\nOccasionally, as in the meeting of Henry and Anne Boleyn, the situation is\r\ntense and dramatic; but as a rule the characters simply meet and converse\r\nin the same quiet strain, which becomes, after much reading, somewhat\r\nmonotonous. On the other hand, one who reads the _Imaginary Conversations_\r\nis lifted at once into a calm and noble atmosphere which braces and\r\ninspires him, making him forget petty things, like a view from a hilltop.\r\nBy its combination of lofty thought and severely classic style the book has\r\nwon, and deserves, a very high place among our literary records.\r\n\r\nThe same criticism applies to _Pericles and Aspasia_, which is a series of\r\nimaginary letters, telling the experiences of Aspasia, a young lady from\r\nAsia Minor, who visits Athens at the summit of its fame and glory, in the\r\ngreat age of Pericles. This is, in our judgment, the best worth reading of\r\nall Landor's works. One gets from it not only Landor's classic style,\r\nbut--what is well worth while--a better picture of Greece in the days of\r\nits greatness than can be obtained from many historical volumes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE AGE OF ROMANTICISM. This period extends from the war with\r\nthe colonies, following the Declaration of Independence, in 1776, to the\r\naccession of Victoria in 1837, both limits being very indefinite, as will\r\nbe seen by a glance at the Chronology following. During the first part of\r\nthe period especially, England was in a continual turmoil, produced by\r\npolitical and economic agitation at home, and by the long wars that covered\r\ntwo continents and the wide sea between them. The mighty changes resulting\r\nfrom these two causes have given this period the name of the Age of\r\nRevolution. The storm center of all the turmoil at home and abroad was the\r\nFrench Revolution, which had a profound influence on the life and\r\nliterature of all Europe. On the Continent the overthrow of Napoleon at\r\nWaterloo (1815) apparently checked the progress of liberty, which had\r\nstarted with the French Revolution,[233] but in England the case was\r\nreversed. The agitation for popular liberty, which at one time threatened a\r\nrevolution, went steadily forward till it resulted in the final triumph of\r\ndemocracy, in the Reform Bill of 1832, and in a number of exceedingly\r\nimportant reforms, such as the extension of manhood suffrage, the removal\r\nof the last unjust restrictions against Catholics, the establishment of a\r\nnational system of schools, followed by a rapid increase in popular\r\neducation, and the abolition of slavery in all English colonies (1833). To\r\nthis we must add the changes produced by the discovery of steam and the\r\ninvention of machinery, which rapidly changed England from an agricultural\r\nto a manufacturing nation, introduced the factory system, and caused this\r\nperiod to be known as the Age of Industrial Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe literature of the age is largely poetical in form, and almost entirely\r\nromantic in spirit. For, as we have noted, the triumph of democracy in\r\ngovernment is generally accompanied by the triumph of romanticism in\r\nliterature. At first the literature, as shown especially in the early work\r\nof Wordsworth, Byron, and Shelley, reflected the turmoil of the age and the\r\nwild hopes of an ideal democracy occasioned by the French Revolution. Later\r\nthe extravagant enthusiasm subsided, and English writers produced so much\r\nexcellent literature that the age is often called the Second Creative\r\nperiod, the first being the Age of Elizabeth. The six chief characteristics\r\nof the age are: the prevalence of romantic poetry; the creation of the\r\nhistorical novel by Scott; the first appearance of women novelists, such as\r\nMrs. Anne Radcliffe, Jane Porter, Maria Edgeworth, and Jane Austen; the\r\ndevelopment of literary criticism, in the work of Lamb, De Quincey,\r\nColeridge, and Hazlitt; the practical and economic bent of philosophy, as\r\nshown in the work of Malthus, James Mill, and Adam Smith; and the\r\nestablishment of great literary magazines, like the _Edinburgh Review_, the\r\n_Quarterly_, _Blackwood's_, and the _Athenaeum_.\r\n\r\nIn our study we have noted (1) the Poets of Romanticism: the importance of\r\nthe _Lyrical Ballads_ of 1798; the life and work of Wordsworth, Coleridge,\r\nScott, Byron, Shelley, and Keats; (2) the Prose Writers: the novels of\r\nScott; the development of literary criticism; the life and work of the\r\nessayists, Lamb, De Quincey, Landor, and of the novelist Jane Austen.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTIONS FOR READING.

In a period like the Age of Romanticism, the\r\npoems and essays chosen for special study vary so widely that only a few\r\ngeneral questions on the selections for reading are attempted.)\r\n\r\n1. Why is this period of Romanticism (1789-1837) called the Age of\r\nRevolution? Give some reasons for the influence of the French Revolution on\r\nEnglish literature, and illustrate from poems or essays which you have\r\nread. Explain the difference between Classicism and Romanticism. Which of\r\nthese two types of literature do you prefer?\r\n\r\n2. What are the general characteristics of the literature of this period?\r\nWhat two opposing tendencies are illustrated in the novels of Scott and\r\nJane Austen? in the poetry of Byron and Wordsworth?\r\n\r\n3. _Wordsworth_. Tell briefly the story of Wordsworth's life, and name some\r\nof his best poems. Why do the _Lyrical Ballads_ (1798) mark an important\r\nliterary epoch? Read carefully, and make an analysis of the \"Intimations of\r\nImmortality\"; of \"Tintern Abbey.\" Can you explain what political conditions\r\nare referred to in Wordsworth's \"Sonnet on Milton\"? in his \"French\r\nRevolution\"? Does he attempt to paint a picture in his sonnet on\r\nWestminster Bridge, or has he some other object in view? What is the\r\ncentral teaching of the \"Ode to Duty\"? Compare Wordsworth's two Skylark\r\npoems with Shelley's. Make a brief comparison between Wordsworth's sonnets\r\nand those of Shakespeare and of Milton, having in mind the thought, the\r\nmelody, the view of nature, and the imagery of the three poets. Quote from\r\nWordsworth's poems to show his belief that nature is conscious; to show the\r\ninfluence of nature on man; to show his interest in children; his\r\nsensitiveness to sounds; to illustrate the chastening influence of sorrow.\r\nMake a brief comparison between the characters of Wordsworth's \"Michael\"\r\nand of Burns's \"The Cotter's Saturday Night.\" Compare Wordsworth's point of\r\nview and method, in the three poems \"To a Daisy,\" with Burns's view, as\r\nexpressed in his famous lines on the same subject.\r\n\r\n4. _Coleridge_. What are the general characteristics of Coleridge's life?\r\nWhat explains the profound sympathy for humanity that is reflected in his\r\npoems? For what, beside his poems, is he remarkable? Can you quote any\r\npassages from his poetry which show, the influence of Wordsworth? What are\r\nthe characters in \"The Ancient Mariner\"? In what respect is this poem\r\nromantic? Give your own reasons for its popularity. Does the thought or the\r\nstyle of this poem impress you? If you have read any of the _Lectures on\r\nShakespeare_, explain why Coleridge's work is called romantic criticism.\r\n\r\n5. _Scott_. Tell the story of Scott's life, and name his chief poems and\r\nnovels. Do you recall any passage from his poetry which suggests his own\r\nheroism? Why was he called \"the wizard of the North\"? What is the general\r\ncharacter of his poetry? Compare _Marmion_ with one of the old ballads,\r\nhaving in mind the characters, the dramatic interest of the story, and the\r\nstyle of writing. In what sense is he the creator of the historical novel?\r\nUpon what does he depend to hold the reader's attention? Compare him, in\r\nthis respect, with Jane Austen. Which of his characters impress you as\r\nbeing the most lifelike? Name any novels of the present day which copy\r\nScott or show his influence. Read _Ivanhoe_ and the _Lady of the Lake_;\r\nmake a brief analysis of each work, having in mind the style, the plot, the\r\ndramatic interest, the use of adventure, and the truth to nature of the\r\ndifferent characters.\r\n\r\n6. _Byron_. Why is Byron called the revolutionary poet? (Illustrate, if\r\npossible, from his poetry.) What is the general character of his work? In\r\nwhat kind of poetry does he excel? (Quote from _Childe Harold_ to\r\nillustrate your opinion.) Describe the typical Byronic hero. Can you\r\nexplain his great popularity at first, and his subsequent loss of\r\ninfluence? Why is he still popular on the Continent? Do you find more of\r\nthought or of emotion in his poetry? Compare him, in this respect, with\r\nShelley; with Wordsworth. Which is the more brilliant writer, Byron or\r\nWordsworth? Which has the more humor? Which has the healthier mind? Which\r\nhas the higher ideal of poetry? Which is the more inspiring and helpful? Is\r\nit fair to say that Byron's quality is power, not charm?\r\n\r\n7. _Shelley_. What are the chief characteristics of Shelley's poetry? Is it\r\nmost remarkable for its thought, form, or imagery? What poems show the\r\ninfluence of the French Revolution? What subjects are considered in \"Lines\r\nwritten among the Euganean Hills\"? What does Shelley try to teach in \"The\r\nSensitive Plant\"? Compare Shelley's view of nature, as reflected in \"The\r\nCloud\" or \"The West Wind,\" with Wordsworth's view, as reflected in \"The\r\nPrelude,\" \"Tintern Abbey,\" \"Daffodils,\" etc. To what class of poems does\r\n\"Adonais\" belong? What is the subject of the poem? Name others of the same\r\nclass. How does Shelley describe himself in this poem? Compare Shelley's\r\n\"Adonais\" and Milton's \"Lycidas\" with regard to the view of life after\r\ndeath as expressed in the poems. What kinds of scenes does Shelley like\r\nbest to describe? Compare his characters with those of Wordsworth; of\r\nByron. Do you recall any poems in which he writes of ordinary people or of\r\nordinary experiences?\r\n\r\n8. _Keats_. What is the essence of Keats's poetical creed, as expressed in\r\nthe \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\"? What are the remarkable elements in his life\r\nand work? What striking difference do you find between his early poems and\r\nthose of Shelley and Byron? What are the chief subjects of his verse? What\r\npoems show the influence of the classics? of Elizabethan literature? Can\r\nyou explain why his work has been called literary poetry? Keats and Shelley\r\nare generally classed together. What similarities do you find in their\r\npoems? Give some reasons why Keats introduces the old Bedesman in \"The Eve\r\nof Saint Agnes.\" Name some of the literary friends mentioned in Keats's\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\nCompare Keats's characters with those of Wordsworth; of Byron. Does Keats\r\never remind you of Spenser? In what respects? Is your personal preference\r\nfor Wordsworth, Byron, Shelley, or Keats? Why?\r\n\r\n9. _Lamb_. Tell briefly the story of Lamb's life and name his principal\r\nworks. Why is he called the most human of essayists? His friends called him\r\n\"the last of the Elizabethans.\" Why? What is the general character of the\r\n_Essays of Elia_? How is the personality of Lamb shown in all these essays?\r\nCite any passages showing Lamb's skill in portraying people. Make a brief\r\ncomparison between Lamb and Addison, having in mind the subjects treated,\r\nthe style, the humor, and the interest of both essayists. Which do you\r\nprefer, and why?\r\n\r\n10. _De Quincey_. What are the general characteristics of De Quincey's\r\nessays? Explain why he is called the psychologist of style. What accounts\r\nfor a certain unreal element in all his work. Read a passage from _The\r\nEnglish Mail-Coach_, or from _Joan of Arc_, or from _Levana, Our Lady of\r\nSorrows_, and comment freely upon it, with regard to style, ideas,\r\ninterest, and the impression of reality or unreality which it leaves.\r\n\r\n11. _Landor_. In what respect does Landor show a reaction from Romanticism?\r\nWhat qualities make Landor's poems stand out so clearly in the memory? Why,\r\nfor instance, do you think Lamb was so haunted by \"Rose Aylmer\"? Quote from\r\nLandor's poems to illustrate his tenderness, his sensitiveness to beauty,\r\nhis power of awakening emotion, his delicacy of characterization. Do you\r\nfind the same qualities in his prose? Can you explain why much of his prose\r\nseems like a translation from the Greek? Compare a passage from the\r\n_Imaginary Conversations_ with a passage from Gibbon or Johnson, to show\r\nthe difference between the classic and the pseudo-classic style. Compare\r\none of Landor's characters, in _Imaginary Conversations_, with the same\r\ncharacter in history.\r\n\r\n12. _Jane Austen_. How does Jane Austen show a reaction from Romanticism?\r\nWhat important work did she do for the novel? To what kind of fiction was\r\nher work opposed? In what does the charm of her novels consist? Make a\r\nbrief comparison between Jane Austen and Scott (as illustrated in _Pride\r\nand Prejudice_ and _Ivanhoe_), having in mind the subject, the characters,\r\nthe manner of treatment, and the interest of both narratives. Do Jane\r\nAusten's characters have to be explained by the author, or do they explain\r\nthemselves? Which method calls for the greater literary skill? What does\r\nJane Austen say about Mrs. Radcliffe, in _Northanger Abbey_? Does she make\r\nany other observations on eighteenth-century novelists?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHRONOLOGY\r\n      _End of the Eighteenth and Beginning of the Nineteenth Century_\r\n============================================================================\r\n  HISTORY                            |  LITERATURE\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n1760-1820.

Coleridge,\r\nShelley, Keats, Byron, and Scott had passed away, and it seemed as if there\r\nwere no writers in England to fill their places. Wordsworth had written, in\r\n1835,\r\n\r\n    Like clouds that rake, the mountain summits,\r\n      Or waves that own no curbing hand,\r\n    How fast has brother followed brother,\r\n      From sunshine to the sunless land!\r\n\r\nIn these lines is reflected the sorrowful spirit of a literary man of the\r\nearly nineteenth century who remembered the glory that had passed away from\r\nthe earth. But the leanness of these first years is more apparent than\r\nreal. Keats and Shelley were dead, it is true, but already there had\r\nappeared three disciples of these poets who were destined to be far more\r\nwidely, read than were their masters. Tennyson had been publishing poetry\r\nsince 1827, his first poems appearing almost simultaneously with the last\r\nwork of Byron, Shelley, and Keats; but it was not until 1842, with the\r\npublication of his collected poems, in two volumes, that England recognized\r\nin him one of her great literary leaders. So also Elizabeth Barrett had\r\nbeen writing since 1820, but not till twenty years later did her poems\r\nbecome deservedly popular; and Browning had published his _Pauline_ in\r\n1833, but it was not until 1846, when he published the last of the series\r\ncalled _Bells and Pomegranates_, that the reading public began to\r\nappreciate his power and originality. Moreover, even as romanticism seemed\r\npassing away, a group of great prose writers--Dickens, Thackeray, Carlyle,\r\nand Ruskin--had already begun to proclaim the literary glory of a new age,\r\nwhich now seems to rank only just below the Elizabethan and the Romantic\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL SUMMARY. Amid the multitude of social and political forces of\r\nthis great age, four things stand out clearly. First, the long struggle of\r\nthe Anglo-Saxons for personal liberty is definitely settled, and democracy\r\nbecomes the established order of the day. The king, who appeared in an age\r\nof popular weakness and ignorance, and the peers, who came with the Normans\r\nin triumph, are both stripped of their power and left as figureheads of a\r\npast civilization. The last vestige of personal government and of the\r\ndivine right of rulers disappears; the House of Commons becomes the ruling\r\npower in England; and a series of new reform bills rapidly extend the\r\nsuffrage, until the whole body of English people choose for themselves the\r\nmen who shall represent them.\r\n\r\nSecond, because it is an age of democracy, it is an age of popular\r\neducation, of religious tolerance, of growing brotherhood, and of profound\r\nsocial unrest. The slaves had been freed in 1833; but in the middle of the\r\ncentury England awoke to the fact that slaves are not necessarily negroes,\r\nstolen in Africa to be sold like cattle in the market place, but that\r\nmultitudes of men, women, and little children in the mines and factories\r\nwere victims of a more terrible industrial and social slavery. To free\r\nthese slaves also, the unwilling victims of our unnatural competitive\r\nmethods, has been the growing purpose of the Victorian Age until the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nThird, because it is an age of democracy and education, it is an age of\r\ncomparative peace. England begins to think less of the pomp and false\r\nglitter of fighting, and more of its moral evils, as the nation realizes\r\nthat it is the common people who bear the burden and the sorrow and the\r\npoverty of war, while the privileged classes reap most of the financial and\r\npolitical rewards. Moreover, with the growth of trade and of friendly\r\nforeign relations, it becomes evident that the social equality for which\r\nEngland was contending at home belongs to the whole race of men; that\r\nbrotherhood is universal, not insular; that a question of justice is never\r\nsettled by fighting; and that war is generally unmitigated horror and\r\nbarbarism. Tennyson, who came of age when the great Reform Bill occupied\r\nattention, expresses the ideals of the Liberals of his day who proposed to\r\nspread the gospel of peace,\r\n\r\n    Till the war-drum throbb'd no longer, and the battle-flags were furled\r\n    In the Parliament of Man, the Federation of the world.\r\n\r\nFourth, the Victorian Age is especially remarkable because of its rapid\r\nprogress in all the arts and sciences and in mechanical inventions. A\r\nglance at any record of the industrial achievements of the nineteenth\r\ncentury will show how vast they are, and it is unnecessary to repeat here\r\nthe list of the inventions, from spinning looms to steamboats, and from\r\nmatches to electric lights. All these material things, as well as the\r\ngrowth of education, have their influence upon the life of a people, and it\r\nis inevitable that they should react upon its prose and poetry; though as\r\nyet we are too much absorbed in our sciences and mechanics to determine\r\naccurately their influence upon literature. When these new things shall by\r\nlong use have became familiar as country roads, or have been replaced by\r\nnewer and better things, then they also will have their associations and\r\nmemories, and a poem on the railroads may be as suggestive as Wordsworth's\r\nsonnet on Westminster Bridge; and the busy, practical workingmen who to-day\r\nthrong our streets and factories may seem, to a future and greater age, as\r\nquaint and poetical as to us seem the slow toilers of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nLITERARY CHARACTERISTICS. When one is interested enough to trace the\r\ngenealogy of Victoria he finds, to his surprise, that in her veins flowed\r\nthe blood both of William the Conqueror and of Cerdic, the first Saxon king\r\nof England; and this seems to be symbolic of the literature of her age,\r\nwhich embraces the whole realm of Saxon and Norman life,--the strength and\r\nideals of the one, and the culture and refinement of the other. The\r\nromantic revival had done its work, and England entered upon a new free\r\nperiod, in which every form of literature, from pure romance to gross\r\nrealism, struggled for expression. At this day it is obviously impossible\r\nto judge the age as a whole; but we are getting far enough away from the\r\nearly half of it to notice certain definite characteristics. First, though\r\nthe age produced many poets, and two who deserve to rank among the\r\ngreatest, nevertheless this is emphatically an age of prose. And since the\r\nnumber of readers has increased a thousandfold with the spread of popular\r\neducation, it is the age of the newspaper, the magazine, and the modern\r\nnovel,--the first two being the story of the world's daily life, and the\r\nlast our pleasantest form of literary entertainment, as well as our most\r\nsuccessful method of presenting modern problems and modern ideals. The\r\nnovel in this age fills a place which the drama held in the days of\r\nElizabeth; and never before, in any age or language, has the novel appeared\r\nin such numbers and in such perfection.\r\n\r\n[Moral Purpose] The second marked characteristic of the age is that\r\nliterature, both in prose and in poetry, seems to depart from the purely\r\nartistic standard, of art for art's sake, and to be actuated by a definite\r\nmoral purpose Tennyson, Browning, Carlyle, Ruskin,--who and what were these\r\nmen if not the teachers of England, not vaguely but definitely, with superb\r\nfaith in their message, and with the conscious moral purpose to uplift and\r\nto instruct? Even the novel breaks away from Scott's romantic influence,\r\nand first studies life as it is, and then points out what life may and\r\nought to be. Whether we read the fun and sentiment of Dickens, the social\r\nminiatures of Thackeray, or the psychological studies of George Eliot, we\r\nfind in almost every case a definite purpose to sweep away error and to\r\nreveal the underlying truth of human life. So the novel sought to do for\r\nsociety in this age precisely what Lyell and Darwin sought to do for\r\nscience, that is, to find the truth, and to show how it might be used to\r\nuplift humanity. Perhaps for this reason the Victorian Age is emphatically\r\nan age of realism rather than of romance,--not the realism of Zola and\r\nIbsen, but a deeper realism which strives to tell the whole truth, showing\r\nmoral and physical diseases as they are, but holding up health and hope as\r\nthe normal conditions of humanity.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat customary to speak of this age as an age of doubt and\r\npessimism, following the new conception of man and of the universe which\r\nwas formulated by science under the name of involution. It is spoken of\r\nalso as a prosaic age, lacking in great ideals. Both these criticisms seem\r\nto be the result of judging a large thing when we are too close to it to\r\nget its true proportions, just as Cologne Cathedral, one of the world's\r\nmost perfect structures, seems to be a shapeless pile of stone when we\r\nstand too close beneath its mighty walls and buttresses. Tennyson's\r\nimmature work, like that of the minor poets, is sometimes in a doubtful or\r\ndespairing strain; but his _In Memoriam_ is like the rainbow after storm;\r\nand Browning seems better to express the spirit of his age in the strong,\r\nmanly faith of \"Rabbi Ben Ezra,\" and in the courageous optimism of all his\r\npoetry. Stedman's _Victorian Anthology_ is, on the whole, a most inspiring\r\nbook of poetry. It would be hard to collect more varied cheer from any age.\r\nAnd the great essayists, like Macaulay, Carlyle, Ruskin, and the great\r\nnovelists, like Dickens, Thackeray, George Eliot, generally leave us with a\r\nlarger charity and with a deeper faith in our humanity.\r\n\r\nSo also the judgment that this age is too practical for great ideals may be\r\nonly a description of the husk that hides a very full ear of corn. It is\r\nwell to remember that Spenser and Sidney judged their own age (which we now\r\nconsider to be the greatest in our literary history) to be altogether given\r\nover to materialism, and to be incapable of literary greatness. Just as\r\ntime has made us smile at their blindness, so the next century may correct\r\nour judgment of this as a material age, and looking upon the enormous\r\ngrowth of charity and brotherhood among us, and at the literature which\r\nexpresses our faith in men, may judge the Victorian Age to be, on the\r\nwhole, the noblest and most inspiring in the history of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE POETS OF THE VICTORIAN AGE\r\n\r\nALFRED TENNYSON (1809-1892)\r\n\r\n    O young Mariner,\r\n    You from the haven\r\n    Under the sea-cliff,\r\n    You that are watching\r\n    The gray Magician\r\n    With eyes of wonder,\r\n    _I_ am Merlin,\r\n    And _I_ am dying,\r\n    _I_ am Merlin\r\n    Who follow The Gleam.\r\n      .  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n    O young Mariner,\r\n    Down to the haven\r\n    Call your companions,\r\n    Launch your vessel,\r\n    And crowd your canvas,\r\n    And, ere it vanishes\r\n    Over the margin,\r\n    After it, follow it,\r\n    Follow The Gleam.\r\n\r\nOne who reads this haunting poem of \"Merlin and The Gleam\" finds in it a\r\nsuggestion of the spirit of the poet's whole life,--his devotion to the\r\nideal as expressed in poetry, his early romantic impressions, his\r\nstruggles, doubts, triumphs, and his thrilling message to his race.\r\nThroughout the entire Victorian period Tennyson stood at the summit of\r\npoetry in England. Not in vain was he appointed laureate at the death of\r\nWordsworth, in 1850; for, almost alone among those who have held the\r\noffice, he felt the importance of his place, and filled and honored it. For\r\nnearly half a century Tennyson was not only a man and a poet; he was a\r\nvoice, the voice of a whole people, expressing in exquisite melody their\r\ndoubts and their faith, their griefs and their triumphs. In the wonderful\r\nvariety of his verse he suggests all the qualities of England's greatest\r\npoets. The dreaminess of Spenser, the majesty of Milton, the natural\r\nsimplicity of Wordsworth, the fantasy of Blake and Coleridge, the melody of\r\nKeats and Shelley, the narrative vigor of Scott and Byron,--all these\r\nstriking qualities are evident on successive pages of Tennyson's poetry.\r\nThe only thing lacking is the dramatic power of the Elizabethans. In\r\nreflecting the restless spirit of this progressive age Tennyson is as\r\nremarkable as Pope was in voicing the artificiality of the early eighteenth\r\ncentury. As a poet, therefore, who expresses not so much a personal as a\r\nnational spirit, he is probably the most representative literary man of the\r\nVictorian era.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Tennyson's life is a remarkable one in this respect, that from\r\nbeginning to end he seems to have been dominated by a single impulse, the\r\nimpulse of poetry. He had no large or remarkable experiences, no wild oats\r\nto sow, no great successes or reverses, no business cares or public\r\noffices. For sixty-six years, from the appearance of the _Poems by Two\r\nBrothers_, in 1827, until his death in 1892, he studied and practiced his\r\nart continually and exclusively. Only Browning, his fellow-worker,\r\nresembles him in this; but the differences in the two men are world-wide.\r\nTennyson was naturally shy, retiring, indifferent to men, hating noise and\r\npublicity, loving to be alone with nature, like Wordsworth. Browning was\r\nsociable, delighting in applause, in society, in travel, in the noise and\r\nbustle of the big world.\r\n\r\nTennyson was born in the rectory of Somersby, Lincolnshire, in 1809. The\r\nsweet influences of his early natural surroundings can be better understood\r\nfrom his early poems than from any biography. He was one of the twelve\r\nchildren of the Rev. George Clayton Tennyson, a scholarly clergyman, and\r\nhis wife Elizabeth Fytche, a gentle, lovable woman, \"not learned, save in\r\ngracious household ways,\" to whom the poet pays a son's loyal tribute near\r\nthe close of _The Princess_. It is interesting to note that most of these\r\nchildren were poetically inclined, and that two of the brothers, Charles\r\nand Frederick, gave far greater promise than did Alfred.\r\n\r\nWhen seven years old the boy went to his grandmother's house at Louth, in\r\norder to attend a famous grammar school at that place. Not even a man's\r\nmemory, which generally makes light of hardship and glorifies early\r\nexperiences, could ever soften Tennyson's hatred of school life. His\r\ncomplaint was not so much at the roughness of the boys, which had so\r\nfrightened Cowper, as at the brutality of the teachers, who put over the\r\nschool door a wretched Latin inscription translating Solomon's barbarous\r\nadvice about the rod and the child. In these psychologic days, when the\r\nchild is more important than the curriculum, and when we teach girls and\r\nboys rather than Latin and arithmetic, we read with wonder Carlyle's\r\ndescription of his own schoolmaster, evidently a type of his kind, who\r\n\"knew of the human soul thus much, that it had a faculty called memory, and\r\ncould be acted on through the muscular integument by appliance of birch\r\nrods.\" After four years of most unsatisfactory school life, Tennyson\r\nreturned home, and was fitted for the university by his scholarly father.\r\nWith his brothers he wrote many verses, and his first efforts appeared in a\r\nlittle volume called _Poems by Two Brothers_, in 1827. The next year he\r\nentered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became the center of a\r\nbrilliant circle of friends, chief of whom was the young poet Arthur Henry\r\nHallam.\r\n\r\nAt the university Tennyson soon became known for his poetical ability, and\r\ntwo years after his entrance he gained the prize of the Chancellor's Medal\r\nfor a poem called \"Timbuctoo,\" the subject, needless to say, being chosen\r\nby the chancellor. Soon after winning this honor Tennyson published his\r\nfirst signed work, called _Poems Chiefly Lyrical_ (1830), which, though it\r\nseems somewhat crude and disappointing to us now, nevertheless contained\r\nthe germ of all his later poetry. One of the most noticeable things in this\r\nvolume is the influence which Byron evidently exerted over the poet in his\r\nearly days; and it was perhaps due largely to the same romantic influence\r\nthat Tennyson and his friend Hallam presently sailed away to Spain, with\r\nthe idea of joining the army of insurgents against King Ferdinand.\r\nConsidered purely as a revolutionary venture, this was something of a\r\nfiasco, suggesting the noble Duke of York and his ten thousand men,--\"he\r\nmarched them up a hill, one day; and he marched them down again.\" From a\r\nliterary view point, however, the experience was not without its value. The\r\ndeep impression which the wild beauty of the Pyrenees made upon the young\r\npoet's mind is reflected clearly in the poem \"Oenone.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1831 Tennyson left the university without taking his degree. The reasons\r\nfor this step are not clear; but the family was poor, and poverty may have\r\nplayed a large part in his determination. His father died a few months\r\nlater; but, by a generous arrangement with the new rector, the family\r\nretained the rectory at Somersby, and here, for nearly six years, Tennyson\r\nlived in a retirement which strongly suggests Milton at Horton. He read and\r\nstudied widely, cultivated an intimate acquaintance with nature, thought\r\ndeeply on the problems suggested by the Reform Bill which was then\r\nagitating England, and during his leisure hours wrote poetry. The first\r\nfruits of this retirement appeared, late in 1832, in a wonderful little\r\nvolume bearing the simple name _Poems_. As the work of a youth only\r\ntwenty-three, this book is remarkable for the variety and melody of its\r\nverse. Among its treasures we still read with delight \"The Lotos Eaters,\"\r\n\"Palace of Art,\" \"A Dream of Fair Women,\" \"The Miller's Daughter,\"\r\n\"Oenone,\" and \"The Lady of Shalott\"; but the critics of the _Quarterly_,\r\nwho had brutally condemned his earlier work, were again unmercifully\r\nsevere. The effect of this harsh criticism upon a sensitive nature was most\r\nunfortunate; and when his friend Hallam died, in 1833, Tennyson was plunged\r\ninto a period of gloom and sorrow. The sorrow may be read in the exquisite\r\nlittle poem beginning, \"Break, break, break, On thy cold gray stones, O\r\nSea!\" which was his first published elegy for his friend; and the\r\ndepressing influence of the harsh and unjust criticism is suggested in\r\n\"Merlin and The Gleam,\" which the reader will understand only after he has\r\nread Tennyson's biography.\r\n\r\nFor nearly ten years after Hallam's death Tennyson published nothing, and\r\nhis movements are hard to trace as the family went here and there, seeking\r\npeace and a home in various parts of England. But though silent, he\r\ncontinued to write poetry, and it was in these sad wandering days that he\r\nbegan his immortal _In Memoriam_ and his _Idylls of the King_. In 1842 his\r\nfriends persuaded him to give his work to the world, and with some\r\nhesitation he published his _Poems_. The success of this work was almost\r\ninstantaneous, and we can appreciate the favor with which it was received\r\nwhen we read the noble blank verse of \"Ulysses\" and \"Morte d'Arthur,\" the\r\nperfect little song of grief for Hallam which we have already mentioned,\r\nand the exquisite idyls like \"Dora\" and \"The Gardener's Daughter,\" which\r\naroused even Wordsworth's enthusiasm and brought from him a letter saying\r\nthat he had been trying all his life to write such an English pastoral as\r\n\"Dora\" and had failed. From this time forward Tennyson, with increasing\r\nconfidence in himself and his message, steadily maintained his place as the\r\nbest known and best loved poet in England.\r\n\r\nThe year 1850 was a happy one for Tennyson. He was appointed poet laureate,\r\nto succeed Wordsworth; and he married Emily Sellwood,\r\n\r\n    Her whose gentle will has changed my fate\r\n      And made my life a perfumed altar flame,\r\n\r\nwhom he had loved for thirteen years, but whom his poverty had prevented\r\nhim from marrying. The year is made further remarkable by the publication\r\nof _In Memoriam_, probably the most enduring of his poems, upon which he\r\nhad worked at intervals for sixteen years. Three years later, with the\r\nmoney that his work now brought him, he leased the house Farringford, in\r\nthe Isle of Wight, and settled in the first permanent home he had known\r\nsince he left the rectory at Somersby.\r\n\r\nFor the remaining forty years of his life he lived, like Wordsworth, \"in\r\nthe stillness of a great peace,\" writing steadily, and enjoying the\r\nfriendship of a large number of people, some distinguished, some obscure,\r\nfrom the kindly and sympathetic Victoria to the servants on his own farm.\r\nAll of these he called with equal sincerity his friends, and to each one he\r\nwas the same man, simple, strong, kindly, and noble. Carlyle describes him\r\nas \"a fine, large-featured, dim-eyed, bronze-colored, shaggy-headed man,\r\n... most restful, brotherly, solid-hearted.\" Loving solitude and hating\r\npublicity as he did, the numerous tourists from both sides of the ocean,\r\nwho sought him out in his retreat and insisted upon seeing him, made his\r\nlife at times intolerable. Influenced partly by the desire to escape such\r\npopularity, he bought land and built for himself a new house, Aldworth, in\r\nSurrey, though he made his home in Farringford for the greater part of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nHis labor during these years and his marvelous freshness and youthfulness\r\nof feeling are best understood by a glance at the contents of his complete\r\nworks. Inferior poems, like _The Princess_, which was written in the first\r\nflush of his success, and his dramas, which were written against the advice\r\nof his best friends, may easily be criticised; but the bulk of his verse\r\nshows an astonishing originality and vigor to the very end. He died very\r\nquietly at Aldworth, with his family about him in the moonlight, and beside\r\nhim a volume of Shakespeare, open at the dirge in _Cymbeline:_\r\n\r\n    Fear no more the heat o' the sun,\r\n      Nor the furious winter's rages;\r\n    Thou thy worldly task hast done,\r\n      Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages.\r\n\r\nThe strong and noble spirit of his life is reflected in one of his best\r\nknown poems, \"Crossing the Bar,\" which was written in his eighty-first\r\nyear, and which he desired should be placed at the end of his collected\r\nworks:\r\n\r\n    Sunset and evening star,\r\n      And one clear call for me!\r\n    And may there be no moaning of the bar,\r\n      When I put out to sea,\r\n    But such a tide as, moving, seems asleep,\r\n      Too full for sound and foam,\r\n    When that which drew from out the boundless deep\r\n      Turns again home.\r\n    Twilight and evening bell,\r\n      And after that the dark!\r\n    And may there be no sadness of farewell,\r\n      When I embark;\r\n    For tho' from out our bourne of Time and Place\r\n      The flood may bear me far,\r\n    I hope to see my Pilot face to face\r\n      When I have crost the bar.\r\n\r\nWORKS. At the outset of our study of Tennyson's works it may be well to\r\nrecord two things, by way of suggestion. First, Tennyson's poetry is not so\r\nmuch to be studied as to be read and appreciated; he is a poet to have open\r\non one's table, and to enjoy as one enjoys his daily exercise. And second,\r\nwe should by all means begin to get acquainted with Tennyson in the days of\r\nour youth. Unlike Browning, who is generally appreciated by more mature\r\nminds, Tennyson is for enjoyment, for inspiration, rather than for\r\ninstruction. Only youth can fully appreciate him; and youth, unfortunately,\r\nexcept in a few rare, beautiful cases, is something which does not dwell\r\nwith us long after our school days. The secret of poetry, especially of\r\nTennyson's poetry, is to be eternally young, and, like Adam in Paradise, to\r\nfind every morning a new world, fresh, wonderful, inspiring, as if just\r\nfrom the hands of God.\r\n\r\nExcept by the student, eager to understand the whoje range of poetry in\r\nthis age, Tennyson's earlier poems and his later dramas may well be\r\nomitted. Opinions vary about both; but the general judgment seems to be\r\nthat the earlier poems show too much of Byron's influence, and their\r\ncrudeness suffers by comparison with the exquisitely finished work of\r\nTennyson's middle life. Of dramatic works he wrote seven, his great\r\nambition being to present a large part of the history of England in a\r\nseries of dramas. _Becket_ was one of the best of these works and met with\r\nconsiderable favor on the stage; but, like all the others, it indicates\r\nthat Tennyson lacked the dramatic power and the humor necessary for a\r\nsuccessful playwright.\r\n\r\nAmong the remaining poems there is such a wide variety that every reader\r\nmust be left largely to follow his own delightful choice.[235] Of the\r\n_Poems_ of 1842 we have already mentioned those best worth reading. _The\r\nPrincess, a Medley_ (1847), a long poem of over three thousand lines of\r\nblank verse, is Tennyson's answer to the question of woman's rights and\r\nwoman's sphere, which was then, as in our own day, strongly agitating the\r\npublic mind. In this poem a baby finally solves the problem which\r\nphilosophers have pondered ever since men began to think connectedly about\r\nhuman society. A few exquisite songs, like \"Tears, Idle Tears,\" \"Bugle\r\nSong,\" and \"Sweet and Low,\" form the most delightful part of this poem,\r\nwhich in general is hardly up to the standard of the poet's later work.\r\n_Maud_ (1855) is what is called in literature a monodrama, telling the\r\nstory of a lover who passes from morbidness to ecstasy, then to anger and\r\nmurder, followed by insanity and recovery. This was Tennyson's favorite,\r\nand among his friends he read aloud from it more than from any other poem.\r\nPerhaps if we could hear Tennyson read it, we should appreciate it better;\r\nbut, on the whole, it seems overwrought and melodramatic. Even its lyrics,\r\nlike \"Come into the Garden, Maud,\" which make this work a favorite with\r\nyoung lovers, are characterized by \"prettiness\" rather than by beauty or\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most loved of all Tennyson's works is _In Memoriam_, which, on\r\naccount of both its theme and its exquisite workmanship, is \"one of the few\r\nimmortal names that were not born to die.\" The immediate occasion of this\r\nremarkable poem was Tennyson's profound personal grief at the death of his\r\nfriend Hallam. As he wrote lyric after lyric, inspired by this sad subject,\r\nthe poet's grief became less personal, and the greater grief of humanity\r\nmourning for its dead and questioning its immortality took possession of\r\nhim. Gradually the poem became an expression, first, of universal doubt,\r\nand then of universal faith, a faith which rests ultimately not on reason\r\nor philosophy but on the soul's instinct for immortality. The immortality\r\nof human love is the theme of the poem, which is made up of over one\r\nhundred different lyrics. The movement takes us through three years, rising\r\nslowly from poignant sorrow and doubt to a calm peace and hope, and ending\r\nwith a noble hymn of courage and faith,--a modest courage and a humble\r\nfaith, love-inspired,--which will be a favorite as long as saddened men\r\nturn to literature for consolation. Though Darwin's greatest books had not\r\nyet been written, science had already overturned many old conceptions of\r\nlife; and Tennyson, who lived apart and thought deeply on all the problems\r\nof his day, gave this poem to the world as his own answer to the doubts and\r\nquestionings of men. This universal human interest, together with its\r\nexquisite form and melody, makes the poem, in popular favor at least, the\r\nsupreme threnody, or elegiac poem, of our literature; though Milton's\r\n_Lycidas_ is, from the critical view point, undoubtedly a more artistic\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n_The Idylls of the King_ ranks among the greatest of Tennyson's later\r\nworks. Its general subject is the Celtic legends of King Arthur and his\r\nknights of the Round Table, and the chief source of its material is\r\nMalory's _Morte d'Arthur_. Here, in this mass of beautiful legends, is\r\ncertainly the subject of a great national epic; yet after four hundred\r\nyears, during which many poets have used the material, the great epic is\r\nstill unwritten. Milton and Spenser, as we have already noted, considered\r\nthis material carefully; and Milton alone, of all English writers, had\r\nperhaps the power to use it in a great epic. Tennyson began to use these\r\nlegends in his _Morte d'Arthur_ (1842); but the epic idea probably occurred\r\nto him later, in 1856, when he began \"Geraint and Enid,\" and he added the\r\nstories of \"Vivien,\" \"Elaine,\" \"Guinevere,\" and other heroes and heroines\r\nat intervals, until \"Balin,\" the last of the _Idylls_, appeared in 1885.\r\nLater these works were gathered together and arranged with an attempt at\r\nunity. The result is in no sense an epic poem, but rather a series of\r\nsingle poems loosely connected by a thread of interest in Arthur, the\r\ncentral personage, and in his unsuccessful attempt to found an ideal\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nEntirely different in spirit is another collection of poems called _English\r\nIdyls,_[236] which began in the _Poems_ of 1842, and which Tennyson\r\nintended should reflect the ideals of widely different types of English\r\nlife. Of these varied poems, \"Dora,\" \"The Gardener's Daughter,\" \"Ulysses,\"\r\n\"Locksley Hall\" and \"Sir Galahad\" are the best; but all are worthy of\r\nstudy. One of the most famous of this series is \"Enoch Arden\" (1864), in\r\nwhich Tennyson turns from mediæval knights, from lords, heroes, and fair\r\nladies, to find the material for true poetry among the lowly people that\r\nmake up the bulk of English life. Its rare melody, its sympathy for common\r\nlife, and its revelation of the beauty and heroism which hide in humble men\r\nand women everywhere, made this work an instant favorite. Judged by its\r\nsales alone, it was the most popular of his works during the poet's\r\nlifetime.\r\n\r\nTennyson's later volumes, like the _Ballads_ (1880) and _Demeter_ (1889),\r\nshould not be overlooked, since they contain some of his best work. The\r\nformer contains stirring war songs, like \"The Defence of Lucknow,\" and\r\npictures of wild passionate grief, like \"Rizpah\"; the latter is notable for\r\n\"Romney's Remorse,\" a wonderful piece of work; \"Merlin and The Gleam,\"\r\nwhich expresses the poet's lifelong ideal; and several exquisite little\r\nsongs, like \"The Throstle,\" and \"The Oak,\" which show how marvelously the\r\naged poet retained his youthful freshness and inspiration. Here certainly\r\nis variety enough to give us long years of literary enjoyment; and we need\r\nhardly mention miscellaneous poems, like \"The Brook\" and \"The Charge of the\r\nLight Brigade,\" which are known to every schoolboy; and \"Wages\" and \"The\r\nHigher Pantheism,\" which should be read by every man who thinks about the\r\nold, old problem of life and death.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF TENNYSON'S POETRY. If we attempt to sum up the quality\r\nof Tennyson, as shown in all these works, the task is a difficult one; but\r\nthree things stand out more or less plainly. First, Tennyson is essentially\r\nthe artist. No other in his age studied the art of poetry so constantly or\r\nwith such singleness of purpose; and only Swinburne rivals him in melody\r\nand the perfect finish of his verse. Second, like all the great writers of\r\nhis age, he is emphatically a teacher, often a leader. In the preceding\r\nage, as the result of the turmoil produced by the French Revolution,\r\nlawlessness was more or less common, and individuality was the rule in\r\nliterature. Tennyson's theme, so characteristic of his age, is the reign of\r\norder,--of law in the physical world, producing evolution, and of law in\r\nthe spiritual world, working out the perfect man. _In Memoriam, Idylls of\r\nthe King, The Princess_,-here are three widely different poems; yet the\r\ntheme of each, so far as poetry is a kind of spiritual philosophy and\r\nweighs its words before it utters them, is the orderly development of law\r\nin the natural and in the spiritual world.\r\n\r\nThis certainly is a new doctrine in poetry, but the message does not end\r\nhere. Law implies a source, a method, an object. Tennyson, after facing his\r\ndoubts honestly and manfully, finds law even in the sorrows and losses of\r\nhumanity. He gives this law an infinite and personal source, and finds the\r\nsupreme purpose of all law to be a revelation of divine love. All earthly\r\nlove, therefore, becomes an image of the heavenly. What first perhaps\r\nattracted readers to Tennyson, as to Shakespeare, was the character of his\r\nwomen,--pure, gentle, refined beings, whom we must revere as our Anglo-\r\nSaxon forefathers revered the women they loved. Like Browning, the poet had\r\nloved one good woman supremely, and her love made clear the meaning of all\r\nlife. The message goes one step farther. Because law and love are in the\r\nworld, faith is the only reasonable attitude toward life and death, even\r\nthough we understand them not. Such, in a few words, seems to be Tennyson's\r\nwhole message and philosophy.\r\n\r\nIf we attempt now to fix Tennyson's permanent place in literature, as the\r\nresult of his life and work, we must apply to him the same test that we\r\napplied to Milton and Wordsworth, and, indeed, to all our great poets, and\r\nask with the German critics, \"What new thing has he said to the world or\r\neven to his own country?\" The answer is, frankly, that we do not yet know\r\nsurely; that we are still too near Tennyson to judge him impersonally. This\r\nmuch, however, is clear. In a marvelously complex age, and amid a hundred\r\ngreat men, he was regarded as a leader. For a full half century he was the\r\nvoice of England, loved and honored as a man and a poet, not simply by a\r\nfew discerning critics, but by a whole people that do not easily give their\r\nallegiance to any one man. And that, for the present, is Tennyson's\r\nsufficient eulogy.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT BROWNING (1812-1889)\r\n\r\n    How good is man's life, the mere living! how fit to employ\r\n    All the heart and the soul and the senses for ever in joy!\r\n\r\nIn this new song of David, from Browning's _Saul_, we have a suggestion of\r\nthe astonishing vigor and hope that characterize all the works of Browning,\r\nthe one poet of the age who, after thirty years of continuous work, was\r\nfinally recognized and placed beside Tennyson, and whom future ages may\r\njudge to be a greater poet,--perhaps, even, the greatest in our literature\r\nsince Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty in reading Browning is the obscurity of his style,\r\nwhich the critics of half a century ago held up to ridicule. Their attitude\r\ntowards the poet's early work may be inferred from Tennyson's humorous\r\ncriticism of _Sordello_. It may be remembered that the first line of this\r\nobscure poem is, \"Who will may hear Sordello's story told\"; and that the\r\nlast line is, \"Who would has heard Sordello's story told.\" Tennyson\r\nremarked that these were the only lines in the whole poem that he\r\nunderstood, and that they were evidently both lies. If we attempt to\r\nexplain this obscurity, which puzzled Tennyson and many less friendly\r\ncritics, we find that it has many sources. First, the poet's thought is\r\noften obscure, or else so extremely subtle that language expresses it\r\nimperfectly,--\r\n\r\n    Thoughts hardly to be packed\r\n    Into a narrow act,\r\n    Fancies that broke through language and escaped.\r\n\r\nSecond, Browning is led from one thing to another by his own mental\r\nassociations, and forgets that the reader's associations may be of an\r\nentirely different kind. Third, Browning is careless in his English, and\r\nfrequently clips his speech, giving us a series of ejaculations. As we do\r\nnot quite understand his processes of thought, we must stop between the\r\nejaculations to trace out the connections. Fourth, Browning's, allusions\r\nare often far-fetched, referring to some odd scrap of information which he\r\nhas picked up in his wide reading, and the ordinary reader finds it\r\ndifficult to trace and understand them. Finally, Browning wrote too much\r\nand revised too Little. The time which he should have given to making one\r\nthought clear was used in expressing other thoughts that flitted through\r\nhis head like a flock of swallows. His field was the individual soul, never\r\nexactly alike in any two men, and he sought to express the hidden motives\r\nand principles which govern individual action. In this field he is like a\r\nminer delving underground, sending up masses of mingled earth and ore; and\r\nthe reader must sift all this material to separate the gold from the dross.\r\n\r\nHere, certainly, are sufficient reasons for Browning's obscurity; and we\r\nmust add the word that the fault seems unpardonable, for the simple reason\r\nthat Browning shows himself capable, at times, of writing directly,\r\nmelodiously, and with noble simplicity.\r\n\r\nSo much for the faults, which must be faced and overlooked before one finds\r\nthe treasure that is hidden in Browning's poetry. Of all the poets in our\r\nliterature, no other is so completely, so consciously, so magnificently a\r\nteacher of men. He feels his mission of faith and courage in a world of\r\ndoubt and timidity. For thirty years he faced indifference or ridicule,\r\nworking bravely and cheerfully the while, until he made the world recognize\r\nand follow him. The spirit of his whole life is well expressed in his\r\n_Paracelsus_, written when he was only twenty-two years old:\r\n\r\n    I see my way as birds their trackless way.\r\n    I shall arrive,--what time, what circuit first,\r\n    I ask not; but unless God send his hail\r\n    Or blinding fire-balls, sleet or stifling snow,\r\n    In some time, his good time, I shall arrive;\r\n    He guides me and the bird. In his good time.\r\n\r\nHe is not, like so many others, an entertaining poet. One cannot read him\r\nafter dinner, or when settled in a comfortable easy-chair. One must sit up,\r\nand think, and be alert when he reads Browning. If we accept these\r\nconditions, we shall probably find that Browning is the most stimulating\r\npoet in our language. His influence upon our life is positive and\r\ntremendous. His strength, his joy of life, his robust faith, and his\r\ninvincible optimism enter into us, making us different and better men after\r\nreading him. And perhaps the best thing he can say of Browning is that his\r\nthought is slowly but surely taking possession of all well-educated men and\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Browning's father was outwardly a business man, a clerk for fifty\r\nyears in the Bank of England; inwardly he was an interesting combination of\r\nthe scholar and the artist, with the best tastes of both. His mother was a\r\nsensitive, musical woman, evidently very lovely in character, the daughter\r\nof a German shipowner and merchant who had settled in Scotland. She was of\r\nCeltic descent, and Carlyle describes her as the true type of a Scottish\r\ngentlewoman. From his neck down, Browning was the typical Briton,--short,\r\nstocky, large-chested, robust; but even in the lifeless portrait his face\r\nchanges as we view it from different angles. Now it is like an English\r\nbusiness man, now like a German scientist, and now it has a curious\r\nsuggestion of Uncle Remus,--these being, no doubt, so many different\r\nreflections of his mixed and unremembered ancestors.\r\n\r\nHe was born in Camberwell, on the outskirts of London, in 1812. From his\r\nhome and from his first school, at Peckham, he could see London; and the\r\ncity lights by night and the smoky chimneys by day had the same powerful\r\nfascination for the child that the woods and fields and the beautiful\r\ncountry had for his friend Tennyson. His schooling was short and desultory,\r\nhis education being attended to by private tutors and by his father, who\r\nleft the boy largely to follow his own inclination. Like the young Milton,\r\nBrowning was fond of music, and in many of his poems, especially in \"Abt\r\nVogler\" and \"A Toccata of Galuppi's,\" he interprets the musical temperament\r\nbetter, perhaps, than any other writer in our literature. But unlike\r\nMilton, through whose poetry there runs a great melody, music seems to have\r\nhad no consistent effect upon his verse, which is often so jarring that one\r\nmust wonder how a musical ear could have endured it.\r\n\r\nLike Tennyson, this boy found his work very early, and for fifty years\r\nhardly a week passed that he did not write poetry. He began at six to\r\nproduce verses, in imitation of Byron; but fortunately this early work has\r\nbeen lost. Then he fell under the influence of Shelley, and his first known\r\nwork, _Pauline_ (1833), must be considered as a tribute to Shelley and his\r\npoetry. Tennyson's earliest work, _Poems by Two Brothers_, had been\r\npublished and well paid for, five years before; but Browning could find no\r\npublisher who would even consider _Pauline_, and the work was published by\r\nmeans of money furnished by an indulgent relative. This poem received scant\r\nnotice from the reviewers, who had pounced like hawks on a dovecote upon\r\nTennyson's first two modest volumes. Two years later appeared _Paracelsus_,\r\nand then his tragedy _Strafford_ was put upon the stage; but not till\r\n_Sordello_ was published, in 1840, did he attract attention enough to be\r\ndenounced for the obscurity and vagaries of his style. Six years later, in\r\n1846, he suddenly became famous, not because he finished in that year his\r\n_Bells and Pomegranates_ (which is Browning's symbolic name for \"poetry and\r\nthought\" or \"singing and sermonizing\"), but because he eloped with the best\r\nknown literary woman in England, Elizabeth Barrett, whose fame was for many\r\nyears, both before and after her marriage, much greater than Browning's,\r\nand who was at first considered superior to Tennyson. Thereafter, until his\r\nown work compelled attention, he was known chiefly as the man who married\r\nElizabeth Barrett. For years this lady had been an almost helpless invalid,\r\nand it seemed a quixotic thing when Browning, having failed to gain her\r\nfamily's consent to the marriage, carried her off romantically. Love and\r\nItaly proved better than her physicians, and for fifteen years Browning and\r\nhis wife lived an ideally happy life in Pisa and in Florence. The exquisite\r\nromance of their love is preserved in Mrs. Browning's _Sonnets from the\r\nPortuguese_, and in the volume of _Letters_ recently published,--wonderful\r\nletters, but so tender and intimate that it seems almost a sacrilege for\r\ninquisitive eyes to read them.\r\n\r\nMrs. Browning died in Florence in 1861. The loss seemed at first too much\r\nto bear, and Browning fled with his son to England. For the remainder of\r\nhis life he lived alternately in London and in various parts of Italy,\r\nespecially at the Palazzo Rezzonico, in Venice, which is now an object of\r\npilgrimage to almost every tourist who visits the beautiful city. Wherever\r\nhe went he mingled with men and women, sociable, well dressed, courteous,\r\nloving crowds and popular applause, the very reverse of his friend\r\nTennyson. His earlier work had been much better appreciated in America than\r\nin England; but with the publication of _The Ring and the Book_, in 1868,\r\nhe was at last recognized by his countrymen as one of the greatest of\r\nEnglish poets. He died in Venice, on December 12, 1889, the same day that\r\nsaw the publication of his last work, _Asolando_. Though Italy offered him\r\nan honored resting place, England claimed him for her own, and he lies\r\nburied beside Tennyson in Westminster Abbey. The spirit of his whole life\r\nis magnificently expressed in his own lines, in the Epilogue of his last\r\nbook:\r\n\r\n    One who never turned his back, but marched breast forward,\r\n        Never doubted clouds would break,\r\n    Never dreamed, tho' right were worsted, wrong would triumph,\r\n        Held we fall to rise, are baffled to fight better,\r\n                     Sleep to wake.\r\n\r\nWORKS. A glance at even the titles which Browning gave to his best known\r\nvolumes--_Dramatic Lyrics_ (1842), _Dramatic Romances and Lyrics_ (1845),\r\n_Men and Women_ (1853), _Dramatis Persona_ (1864)--will suggest how strong\r\nthe dramatic element is in all his work. Indeed, all his poems may be\r\ndivided into three classes,--pure dramas, like _Strafford_ and _A Blot in\r\nthe 'Scutcheon_; dramatic narratives, like _Pippa Passes_, which are\r\ndramatic in form, but were not meant to be acted; and dramatic lyrics, like\r\n_The Last Ride Together_, which are short poems expressing some strong\r\npersonal emotion, or describing some dramatic episode in human life, and in\r\nwhich the hero himself generally tells the story.\r\n\r\nThough Browning is often compared with Shakespeare, the reader will\r\nunderstand that he has very little of Shakespeare's dramatic talent. He\r\ncannot bring a group of people together and let the actions and words of\r\nhis characters show us the comedy and tragedy of human life. Neither can\r\nthe author be disinterested, satisfied, as Shakespeare was, with life\r\nitself, without drawing any moral conclusions. Browning has always a moral\r\nready, and insists upon giving us his own views of life, which Shakespeare\r\nnever does. His dramatic power lies in depicting what he himself calls the\r\nhistory of a soul. Sometimes, as in _Paracelsus_, he endeavors to trace the\r\nprogress of the human spirit. More often he takes some dramatic moment in\r\nlife, some crisis in the ceaseless struggle between good and evil, and\r\ndescribes with wonderful insight the hero's own thoughts and feelings; but\r\nhe almost invariably tells us how, at such and such a point, the good or\r\nthe evil in his hero must inevitably have triumphed. And generally, as in\r\n\"My Last Duchess,\" the speaker adds a word here and there, aside from the\r\nstory, which unconsciously shows the kind of man he is. It is this power of\r\nrevealing the soul from within that causes Browning to fascinate those who\r\nstudy him long enough. His range is enormous, and brings all sorts and\r\nconditions of men under analysis. The musician in \"Abt Vogler,\" the artist\r\nin \"Andrea del Sarto,\" the early Christian in \"A Death in the Desert,\" the\r\nArab horseman in \"Muteykeh,\" the sailor in \"Herve Kiel,\" the mediæval\r\nknight in \"Childe Roland,\" the Hebrew in \"Saul,\" the Greek in \"Balaustion's\r\nAdventure,\" the monster in \"Caliban,\" the immortal dead in \"Karshish,\"--all\r\nthese and a hundred more histories of the soul show Browning's marvelous\r\nversatility. It is this great range of sympathy with many different types\r\nof life that constitutes Browning's chief likeness to Shakespeare, though\r\notherwise there is no comparison between the two men.\r\n\r\nIf we separate all these dramatic poems into three main periods,--the\r\nearly, from 1833 to 1841; the middle, from 1841 to 1868; and the late, from\r\n1868 to 1889,--the work of the beginner will be much more easily\r\ndesignated. Of his early soul studies, _Pauline_ (1833), _Paracelsus_\r\n(1835), and _Sordello_ (1840), little need be said here, except perhaps\r\nthis: that if we begin with these works, we shall probably never read\r\nanything else by Browning. And that were a pity. It is better to leave\r\nthese obscure works until his better poems have so attracted us to Browning\r\nthat we will cheerfully endure his worst faults for the sake of his\r\nundoubted virtues. The same criticism applies, though in less degree, to\r\nhis first drama, _Strafford_ (1837), which belongs to the early period of\r\nhis work.\r\n\r\nThe merciless criticism which greeted _Sordello_ had a wholesome effect on\r\nBrowning, as is shown in the better work of his second period. Moreover,\r\nhis new power was developing rapidly, as may be seen by comparing the eight\r\nnumbers of his famous _Bells and Pomegranates_ series (1841-1846) with his\r\nearlier work. Thus, the first number of this wonderful series, published in\r\n1841, contains _Pippa Passes_, which is, on the whole, the most perfect of\r\nhis longer poems; and another number contains _A Blot in the 'Scutcheon_,\r\nwhich is the most readable of his dramas. Even a beginner must be thrilled\r\nby the beauty and the power of these two works. Two other noteworthy dramas\r\nof the period are _Colombe's Birthday_ (1844) and _In a Balcony_ (1855),\r\nwhich, however, met with scant appreciation on the stage, having too much\r\nsubtle analysis and too little action to satisfy the public. Nearly all his\r\nbest lyrics, dramas, and dramatic poems belong to this middle period of\r\nlabor; and when _The Ring and the Book_ appeared, in 1868, he had given to\r\nthe world the noblest expression of his poetic genius.\r\n\r\nIn the third period, beginning when Browning was nearly sixty years old, he\r\nwrote even more industriously than before, and published on an average\r\nnearly a volume of poetry a year. Such volumes as _Fifine at the Fair, Red\r\nCotton Night-Cap Country, The Inn Album, Jocoseria_, and many others, show\r\nhow Browning gains steadily in the power of revealing the hidden springs of\r\nhuman action; but he often rambles most tiresomely, and in general his work\r\nloses in sustained interest. It is perhaps significant that most of his\r\nbest work was done under Mrs. Browning's influence.\r\n\r\nWHAT TO READ. Of the short miscellaneous poems there is such an unusual\r\nvariety that one must hesitate a little in suggesting this or that to the\r\nbeginner's attention. \"My Star,\" \"Evelyn Hope,\" \"Wanting is--What?\" \"Home\r\nThoughts from Abroad,\" \"Meeting at Night,\" \"One Word More\" (an exquisite\r\ntribute to his dead wife), \"Prospice\" (Look Forward); songs from _Pippa\r\nPasses;_ various love poems like \"By the Fireside\" and \"The Last Ride\r\nTogether\"; the inimitable \"Pied Piper,\" and the ballads like \"Hervé Riel\"\r\nand \"How They Brought the Good News,\"--these are a mere suggestion,\r\nexpressing only the writer's personal preference; but a glance at the\r\ncontents of Browning's volumes will reveal scores of other poems, which\r\nanother writer might recommend as being better in themselves or more\r\ncharacteristic of Browning.[237]\r\n\r\nAmong Browning's dramatic soul studies there is also a very wide choice.\r\n\"Andrea del Sarto\" is one of the best, revealing as it does the strength\r\nand the weakness of \"the perfect painter,\" whose love for a soulless woman\r\nwith a pretty face saddens his life and hampers his best work. Next in\r\nimportance to \"Andrea\" stands \"An Epistle,\" reciting the experiences of\r\nKarshish, an Arab physician, which is one of the best examples of\r\nBrowning's peculiar method of presenting the truth. The half-scoffing,\r\nhalf-earnest, and wholly bewildered state of this Oriental scientist's mind\r\nis clearly indicated between the lines of his letter to his old master. His\r\ndescription of Lazarus, whom he meets by chance, and of the state of mind\r\nof one who, having seen the glories of immortality, must live again in the\r\nmidst of the jumble of trivial and stupendous things which constitute our\r\nlife, forms one of the most original and suggestive poems in our\r\nliterature. \"My Last Duchess\" is a short but very keen analysis of the soul\r\nof a selfish man, who reveals his character unconsciously by his words of\r\npraise concerning his dead wife's picture. In \"The Bishop Orders his Tomb\"\r\nwe have another extraordinarily interesting revelation of the mind of a\r\nvain and worldly man, this time a churchman, whose words tell you far more\r\nthan he dreams about his own character. \"Abt Vogler,\" undoubtedly one of\r\nBrowning's finest poems, is the study of a musician's soul. \"Muléykeh\"\r\ngives us the soul of an Arab, vain and proud of his fast horse, which was\r\nnever beaten in a race. A rival steals the horse and rides away upon her\r\nback; but, used as she is to her master's touch, she will not show her best\r\npace to the stranger. Muléykeh rides up furiously; but instead of striking\r\nthe thief from his saddle, he boasts about his peerless mare, saying that\r\nif a certain spot on her neck were touched with the rein, she could never\r\nbe overtaken. Instantly the robber touches the spot, and the mare answers\r\nwith a burst of speed that makes pursuit hopeless. Muléykeh has lost his\r\nmare; but he has kept his pride in the unbeaten one, and is satisfied.\r\n\"Rabbi Ben Ezra,\" which refuses analysis, and which must be read entire to\r\nbe appreciated, is perhaps the most quoted of all Browning's works, and\r\ncontains the best expression of his own faith in life, both here and\r\nhereafter. All these wonderful poems are, again, merely a suggestion. They\r\nindicate simply the works to which one reader turns when he feels mentally\r\nvigorous enough to pick up Browning. Another list of soul studies, citing\r\n\"A Toccata of Galuppi's,\" \"A Grammarian's Funeral,\" \"Fra Lippo Lippi,\"\r\n\"Saul,\" \"Cleon,\" \"A Death in the Desert,\" and \"Soliloquy of the Spanish\r\nCloister,\" might, in another's judgment, be more interesting and\r\nsuggestive.\r\n\r\n[Pippa Passes] Among Browning's longer poems there are two, at least, that\r\nwell deserve our study. _Pippa Passes_, aside from its rare poetical\r\nqualities, is a study of unconscious influence. The idea of the poem was\r\nsuggested to Browning while listening to a gypsy girl singing in the woods\r\nnear his home; but he transfers the scene of the action to the little\r\nmountain town of Asolo, in Italy. Pippa is a little silk weaver, who goes\r\nout in the morning to enjoy her one holiday of the whole year. As she\r\nthinks of her own happiness she is vaguely wishing that she might share it,\r\nand do some good. Then, with her childish imagination, she begins to weave\r\na little romance in which she shares in the happiness of the four greatest\r\nand happiest people in Asolo. It never occurs to her that perhaps there is\r\nmore of misery than of happiness in the four great ones of whom she dreams;\r\nand so she goes on her way singing,\r\n\r\n    The year's at the spring\r\n    And day's at the morn;\r\n    Morning's at seven;\r\n    The hillside's dew-pearled;\r\n    The lark's on the wing;\r\n    The snail's on the thorn:\r\n    God's in his heaven--\r\n    All's right with the world!\r\n\r\nFate wills it that the words and music of her little songs should come to\r\nthe ears of four different groups of people at the moment when they are\r\nfacing the greatest crises of their lives, and turn the scale from evil to\r\ngood. But Pippa knows nothing of this. She enjoys her holiday, and goes to\r\nbed still singing, entirely ignorant of the good she has done in the world.\r\nWith one exception, it is the most perfect of all Browning's works. At best\r\nit is not easy, nor merely entertaining reading; but it richly repays\r\nwhatever hours we spend in studying it.\r\n\r\n_The Ring and the Book_ is Browning's masterpiece. It is an immense poem,\r\ntwice as long as _Paradise Lost_, and longer by some two thousand lines\r\nthan the _Iliad;_ and before we begin the undoubted task of reading it, we\r\nmust understand that there is no interesting story or dramatic development\r\nto carry us along. In the beginning we have an outline of the story, such\r\nas it is--a horrible story of Count Guido's murder of his beautiful young\r\nwife; and Browning tells us in detail just when and how he found a book\r\ncontaining the record of the crime and the trial. There the story element\r\nends, and the symbolism of the book begins. The title of the poem is\r\nexplained by the habit of the old Etruscan goldsmiths who, in making one of\r\ntheir elaborately chased rings, would mix the pure gold with an alloy, in\r\norder to harden it. When the ring was finished, acid was poured upon it;\r\nand the acid ate out the alloy, leaving the beautiful design in pure gold.\r\nBrowning purposes to follow the same plan with his literary material, which\r\nconsists simply of the evidence given at the trial of Guido in Rome, in\r\n1698. He intends to mix a poet's fancy with the crude facts, and create a\r\nbeautiful and artistic work.\r\n\r\nThe result of Browning's purpose is a series of monologues, in which the\r\nsame story is retold nine different times by the different actors in the\r\ndrama. The count, the young wife, the suspected priest, the lawyers, the\r\nPope who presides at the trial,--each tells the story, and each\r\nunconsciously reveals the depths of his own nature in the recital. The most\r\ninteresting of the characters are Guido, the husband, who changes from bold\r\ndefiance to abject fear; Caponsacchi, the young priest, who aids the wife\r\nin her flight from her brutal husband, and is unjustly accused of false\r\nmotives; Pompilia, the young wife, one of the noblest characters in\r\nliterature, fit in all respects to rank with Shakespeare's great heroines;\r\nand the Pope, a splendid figure, the strongest of all Browning's masculine\r\ncharacters. When we have read the story, as told by these four different\r\nactors, we have the best of the poet's work, and of the most original poem\r\nin our language.\r\n\r\nBROWNING'S PLACE AND MESSAGE. Browning's place in our literature will be\r\nbetter appreciated by comparison with his friend Tennyson, whom we have\r\njust studied. In one respect, at least, these poets are in perfect accord.\r\nEach finds in love the supreme purpose and meaning of life. In other\r\nrespects, especially in their methods of approaching the truth, the two men\r\nare the exact opposites. Tennyson is first the artist and then the teacher;\r\nbut with Browning the message is always the important thing, and he is\r\ncareless, too careless, of the form in which it is expressed. Again,\r\nTennyson is under the influence of the romantic revival, and chooses his\r\nsubjects daintily; but \"all's fish\" that comes to Browning's net. He takes\r\ncomely and ugly subjects with equal pleasure, and aims to show that truth\r\nlies hidden in both the evil and the good. This contrast is all the more\r\nstriking when we remember that Browning's essentially scientific attitude\r\nwas taken by a man who refused to study science. Tennyson, whose work is\r\nalways artistic, never studied art, but was devoted to the sciences; while\r\nBrowning, whose work is seldom artistic in form, thought that art was the\r\nmost suitable subject for a man's study.\r\n\r\nThe two poets differ even more widely in their respective messages.\r\nTennyson's message reflects the growing order of the age, and is summed up\r\nin the word \"law.\" in his view, the individual will must be suppressed; the\r\nself must always be subordinate. His resignation is at times almost\r\nOriental in its fatalism, and occasionally it suggests Schopenhauer in its\r\nmixture of fate and pessimism. Browning's message, on the other hand, is\r\nthe triumph of the individual will over all obstacles; the self is not\r\nsubordinate but supreme. There is nothing Oriental, nothing doubtful,\r\nnothing pessimistic in the whole range of his poetry. His is the voice of\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon, standing up in the face of all obstacles and saying, \"I\r\ncan and I will.\" He is, therefore, far more radically English than is\r\nTennyson; and it may be for this reason that he is the more studied, and\r\nthat, while youth delights in Tennyson, manhood is better satisfied with\r\nBrowning. Because of his invincible will and optimism, Browning is at\r\npresent regarded as the poet who has spoken the strongest word of faith to\r\nan age of doubt. His energy, his cheerful courage, his faith in life and in\r\nthe development that awaits us beyond the portals of death, are like a\r\nbugle-call to good living. This sums up his present influence upon the\r\nminds of those who have learned to appreciate him. Of the future we can\r\nonly say that, both at home and abroad, he seems to be gaining steadily in\r\nappreciation as the years go by.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR POETS OF THE VISTORIAN AGE\r\n\r\nELIZABETH BARRETT. Among the minor poets of the past century Elizabeth\r\nBarrett (Mrs. Browning) occupies perhaps the highest place in popular\r\nfavor. She was born at Coxhoe Hall, near Durham, in 1806; but her childhood\r\nand early youth were spent in Herefordshire, among the Malvern Hills made\r\nfamous by _Piers Plowman_. In 1835 the Barrett family moved to London,\r\nwhere Elizabeth gained a literary reputation by the publication of _The\r\nSeraphim and Other Poems_ (1838). Then illness and the shock caused by the\r\ntragic death of her brother, in 1840, placed her frail life in danger, and\r\nfor six years she was confined to her own room. The innate strength and\r\nbeauty of her spirit here showed itself strongly in her daily study, her\r\npoetry, and especially in her interest in the social problems which sooner\r\nor later occupied all the Victorian writers. \"My mind to me a kingdom is\"\r\nmight well have been written over the door of the room where this delicate\r\ninvalid worked and suffered in loneliness and in silence.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 Miss Barrett published her _Poems_, which, though somewhat\r\nimpulsive and overwrought, met with remarkable public favor. Such poems as\r\n\"The Cry of the Children,\" which voices the protest of humanity against\r\nchild labor, appealed tremendously to the readers of the age, and this\r\nyoung woman's fame as a poet temporarily overshadowed that of Tennyson and\r\nBrowning. Indeed, as late as 1850, when Wordsworth died, she was seriously\r\nconsidered for the position of poet laureate, which was finally given to\r\nTennyson. A reference to Browning, in \"Lady Geraldine's Courtship,\" is\r\nsupposed to have first led the poet to write to Miss Barrett in 1845. Soon\r\nafterwards he visited the invalid; they fell in love almost at first sight,\r\nand the following year, against the wishes of her father,--who was\r\nevidently a selfish old tyrant,--Browning carried her off and married her.\r\nThe exquisite romance of their love is reflected in Mrs. Browning's\r\n_Sonnets from the Portuguese_ (1850). This is a noble and inspiring book of\r\nlove poems; and Stedman regards the opening sonnet, \"I thought once how\r\nTheocritus had sung,\" as equal to any in our language.\r\n\r\nFor fifteen years the Brownings lived an ideally happy life at Pisa, and at\r\nCasa Guidi, Florence, sharing the same poetical ambitions. And love was the\r\ngreatest thing in the world,--\r\n\r\n    How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.\r\n    I love thee to the depth and breadth and height\r\n    My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight\r\n    For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.\r\n    I love thee to the level of everyday's\r\n    Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.\r\n    I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;\r\n    I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise;\r\n    I love thee with the passion put to use\r\n    In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith;\r\n    I love thee with a love I seemed to lose\r\n    With my lost saints--I love thee with the breath,\r\n    Smiles, tears, of all my life!--and, if God choose,\r\n    I shall but love thee better after death.\r\n\r\nMrs. Browning entered with whole-souled enthusiasm into the aspirations of\r\nItaly in its struggle against the tyranny of Austria; and her _Casa Guidi\r\nWindows_ (1851) is a combination of poetry and politics, both, it must be\r\nconfessed, a little too emotional. In 1856 she published _Aurora Leigh_, a\r\nnovel in verse, having for its hero a young social reformer, and for its\r\nheroine a young woman, poetical and enthusiastic, who strongly suggests\r\nElizabeth Barrett herself. It emphasizes in verse precisely the same moral\r\nand social ideals which Dickens and George Eliot were proclaiming in all\r\ntheir novels. Her last two volumes were _Poems before Congress_ (1860), and\r\n_Last Poems_, published after her death. She died suddenly in 1861 and was\r\nburied in Florence. Browning's famous line, \"O lyric love, half angel and\r\nhalf bird,\" may well apply to her frail life and aerial spirit.\r\n\r\nROSSETTI. Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828-1882), the son of an exiled Italian\r\npainter and scholar, was distinguished both as a painter and as a poet. He\r\nwas a leader in the Pre-Raphaelite movement[238] and published in the first\r\nnumbers of _The Germ_ his \"Hand and Soul,\" a delicate prose study, and his\r\nfamous \"The Blessed Damozel,\" beginning,\r\n\r\n    The blessed damozel leaned out\r\n      From the gold bar of Heaven;\r\n    Her eyes were deeper than the depth\r\n      Of waters stilled at even;\r\n    She had three lilies in her hand,\r\n      And the stars in her hair were seven.\r\n\r\nThese two early works, especially \"The Blessed Damozel,\" with its\r\nsimplicity and exquisite spiritual quality, are characteristic of the\r\nideals of the Pre-Raphaelites.\r\n\r\nIn 1860, after a long engagement, Rossetti married Elizabeth Siddal, a\r\ndelicate, beautiful English girl, whom he has immortalized both in his\r\npictures and in his poetry. She died two years later, and Rossetti never\r\nentirely recovered from the shock. At her burial he placed in her coffin\r\nthe manuscripts of all his unpublished poems, and only at the persistent\r\ndemands of his friends did he allow them to be exhumed and printed in 1870.\r\nThe publication of this volume of love poems created a sensation in\r\nliterary circles, and Rossetti was hailed as one of the greatest of living\r\npoets. In 1881 he published his _Ballads and Sonnets_, a remarkable volume\r\ncontaining, among other poems, \"The Confession,\" modeled after Browning;\r\n\"The Ballad of Sister Helen,\" founded on a mediæval superstition; \"The\r\nKing's Tragedy,\" a masterpiece of dramatic narrative; and \"The House of\r\nLife,\" a collection of one hundred and one sonnets reflecting the poet's\r\nlove and loss. This last collection deserves to rank with Mrs. Browning's\r\n_Sonnets from the Portuguese_ and with Shakespeare's _Sonnets_, as one of\r\nthe three great cycles of love poems in our language. It has been well said\r\nthat both Rossetti and Morris paint pictures as well in their poems as on\r\ntheir canvases, and this pictorial quality of their verse is its chief\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\nMORRIS. William Morris (1834-1896) is a most interesting combination of\r\nliterary man and artist. In the latter capacity, as architect, designer,\r\nand manufacturer of furniture, carpets, and wall paper, and as founder of\r\nthe Kelmscott Press for artistic printing and bookbinding, he has laid us\r\nall under an immense debt of gratitude. From boyhood he had steeped himself\r\nin the legends and ideals of the Middle Ages, and his best literary work is\r\nwholly mediæval in spirit. _The Earthly Paradise_ (1868-1870) is generally\r\nregarded as his masterpiece. This delightful collection of stories in verse\r\ntells of a roving band of Vikings, who are wrecked on the fabled island of\r\nAtlantis, and who discover there a superior race of men having the\r\ncharacteristics of ideal Greeks. The Vikings remain for a year, telling\r\nstories of their own Northland, and listening to the classic and Oriental\r\ntales of their hosts. Morris's interest in Icelandic literature is further\r\nshown by his _Sigurd the Volsung_, an epic founded upon one of the old\r\nsagas, and by his prose romances, _The House of the Wolfings, The Story of\r\nthe Glittering Plain_, and _The Roots of the Mountains_. Later in life he\r\nbecame deeply interested in socialism, and two other romances, _The Dream\r\nof John Ball_ and _News from Nowhere_, are interesting as modern attempts\r\nat depicting an ideal society governed by the principles of More's\r\n_Utopia_.\r\n\r\nSWINBURNE. Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837-1909) is, chronologically, the\r\nlast of the Victorian poets. As an artist in technique--having perfect\r\ncommand of all old English verse forms and a remarkable faculty for\r\ninventing new--he seems at the present time to rank among the best in our\r\nliterature. Indeed, as Stedman says, \"before his advent we did not realize\r\nthe full scope of English verse.\" This refers to the melodious and\r\nconstantly changing form rather than to the content of Swinburne's poetry.\r\nAt the death of Tennyson, in 1892, he was undoubtedly the greatest living\r\npoet, and only his liberal opinions, his scorn of royalty and of\r\nconventions, and the prejudice aroused by the pagan spirit of his early\r\nwork prevented his appointment as poet laureate. He has written a very\r\nlarge number of poems, dramas, and essays in literary criticism; but we are\r\nstill too near to judge of the permanence of his work or of his place in\r\nliterature. Those who would read and estimate his work for themselves will\r\ndo well to begin with a volume of selected poems, especially those which\r\nshow his love of the sea and his exquisite appreciation of child life. His\r\n_Atalanta in Calydon_ (1864), a beautiful lyric drama modeled on the Greek\r\ntragedy, is generally regarded as his masterpiece. In all his work\r\nSwinburne carries Tennyson's love of melody to an extreme, and often\r\nsacrifices sense to sound. His poetry is always musical, and, like music,\r\nappeals almost exclusively to the emotions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have chosen, somewhat arbitrarily, these four writers--Mrs. Browning, D.\r\nG. Rossetti, Morris, and Swinburne--as representative of the minor poets of\r\nthe age; but there are many others who are worthy of study,--Arthur Hugh\r\nClough and Matthew Arnold,[239] who are often called the poets of\r\nskepticism, but who in reality represent a reverent seeking for truth\r\nthrough reason and human experience; Frederick William Faber, the Catholic\r\nmystic, author of some exquisite hymns; and the scholarly John Keble,\r\nauthor of _The Christian Year_, our best known book of devotional verse;\r\nand among the women poets, Adelaide Procter, Jean Ingelow, and Christina\r\nRossetti, each of whom had a large, admiring circle of readers. It would be\r\na hopeless task at the present time to inquire into the relative merits of\r\nall these minor poets. We note only their careful workmanship and exquisite\r\nmelody, their wide range of thought and feeling, their eager search for\r\ntruth, each in his own way, and especially the note of freshness and\r\nvitality which they have given to English poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE NOVELISTS OF THE VICTORIAN AGE\r\n\r\nCHARLES DICKENS (1812-1870)\r\n\r\nWhen we consider Dickens's life and work, in comparison with that of the\r\ntwo great poets we have been studying, the contrast is startling. While\r\nTennyson and Browning were being educated for the life of literature, and\r\nshielded most tenderly from the hardships of the world, Dickens, a poor,\r\nobscure, and suffering child, was helping to support a shiftless family by\r\npasting labels on blacking bottles, sleeping under a counter like a\r\nhomeless cat, and once a week timidly approaching the big prison where his\r\nfather was confined for debt. In 1836 his _Pickwick_ was published, and\r\nlife was changed as if a magician had waved his wand over him. While the\r\ntwo great poets were slowly struggling for recognition, Dickens, with\r\nplenty of money and too much fame, was the acknowledged literary hero of\r\nEngland, the idol of immense audiences which gathered to applaud him\r\nwherever he appeared. And there is also this striking contrast between the\r\nnovelist and the poets,--that while the whole tendency of the age was\r\ntoward realism, away from the extremes of the romanticists and from the\r\noddities and absurdities of the early novel writers, it was precisely by\r\nemphasizing oddities and absurdities, by making caricatures rather than\r\ncharacters, that Dickens first achieved his popularity.\r\n\r\nLIFE. In Dickens's early life we see a stern but unrecognized preparation\r\nfor the work that he was to do. Never was there a better illustration of\r\nthe fact that a boy's early hardship and suffering are sometimes only\r\ndivine messengers disguised, and that circumstances which seem only evil\r\nare often the source of a man's strength and of the influence which he is\r\nto wield in the world. He was the second of eight poor children, and was\r\nborn at Landport in 1812. His father, who is supposed to be the original of\r\nMr. Micawber, was a clerk in a navy office. He could never make both ends\r\nmeet, and after struggling with debts in his native town for many years,\r\nmoved to London when Dickens was nine years old. The debts still pursued\r\nhim, and after two years of grandiloquent misfortune he was thrown into the\r\npoor-debtors' prison. His wife, the original of Mrs. Micawber, then set up\r\nthe famous Boarding Establishment for Young Ladies; but, in Dickens's\r\nwords, no young ladies ever came. The only visitors were creditors, and\r\nthey were quite ferocious. In the picture of the Micawber family, with its\r\ntears and smiles and general shiftlessness, we have a suggestion of\r\nDickens's own family life.\r\n\r\nAt eleven years of age the boy was taken out of school and went to work in\r\nthe cellar of a blacking factory. At this time he was, in his own words, a\r\n\"queer small boy,\" who suffered as he worked; and we can appreciate the boy\r\nand the suffering more when we find both reflected in the character of\r\nDavid Copperfield. It is a heart-rending picture, this sensitive child\r\nworking from dawn till dark for a few pennies, and associating with toughs\r\nand waifs in his brief intervals of labor; but we can see in it the sources\r\nof that intimate knowledge of the hearts of the poor and outcast which was\r\nsoon to be reflected in literature and to startle all England by its appeal\r\nfor sympathy. A small legacy ended this wretchedness, bringing the father\r\nfrom the prison and sending the boy to Wellington House Academy,--a\r\nworthless and brutal school, evidently, whose head master was, in Dickens's\r\nwords, a most ignorant fellow and a tyrant. He learned little at this\r\nplace, being interested chiefly in stories, and in acting out the heroic\r\nparts which appealed to his imagination; but again his personal experience\r\nwas of immense value, and resulted in his famous picture of Dotheboys Hall,\r\nin _Nicholas Nickleby_, which helped largely to mitigate the evils of\r\nprivate schools in England. Wherever he went, Dickens was a marvelously\r\nkeen observer, with an active imagination which made stories out of\r\nincidents and characters that ordinary men would have hardly noticed.\r\nMoreover he was a born actor, and was at one time the leading spirit of a\r\nband of amateurs who gave entertainments for charity all over England.\r\nThese three things, his keen observation, his active imagination, and the\r\nactor's spirit which animated him, furnish a key to his life and writings.\r\n\r\nWhen only fifteen years old, he left the school and again went to work,\r\nthis time as clerk in a lawyer's office. By night he studied shorthand, in\r\norder to fit himself to be a reporter,--this in imitation of his father,\r\nwho was now engaged by a newspaper to report the speeches in Parliament.\r\nEverything that Dickens attempted seems to have been done with vigor and\r\nintensity, and within two years we find him reporting important speeches,\r\nand writing out his notes as the heavy coach lurched and rolled through the\r\nmud of country roads on its dark way to London town. It was largely during\r\nthis period that he gained his extraordinary knowledge of inns and stables\r\nand \"horsey\" persons, which is reflected in his novels. He also grew\r\nambitious, and began to write on his own account. At the age of twenty-one\r\nhe dropped his first little sketch \"stealthily, with fear and trembling,\r\ninto a dark letter-box, in a dark office up a dark court in Fleet Street.\"\r\nThe name of this first sketch was \"Mr. Minns and his Cousin,\" and it\r\nappeared with other stories in his first book, _Sketches by Boz_, in 1835.\r\nOne who reads these sketches now, with their intimate knowledge of the\r\nhidden life of London, can understand Dickens's first newspaper success\r\nperfectly. His best known work, _Pickwick_, was published serially in\r\n1836-1837, and Dickens's fame and fortune were made. Never before had a\r\nnovel appeared so full of vitality and merriment. Though crude in design, a\r\nmere jumble of exaggerated characters and incidents, it fairly bubbled over\r\nwith the kind of humor in which the British public delights, and it still\r\nremains, after three quarters of a century, one of our most care-dispelling\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of Dickens's life is largely a record of personal triumphs.\r\n_Pickwick_ was followed rapidly by _Oliver Twist, Nicholas Nickleby, Old\r\nCuriosity Shop_, and by many other works which seemed to indicate that\r\nthere was no limit to the new author's invention of odd, grotesque,\r\nuproarious, and sentimental characters. In the intervals of his novel\r\nwriting he attempted several times to edit a weekly paper; but his power\r\nlay in other directions, and with the exception of _Household Words_, his\r\njournalistic ventures were not a marked success. Again the actor came to\r\nthe surface, and after managing a company of amateur actors successfully,\r\nDickens began to give dramatic readings from his own works. As he was\r\nalready the most popular writer in the English language, these readings\r\nwere very successful. Crowds thronged to hear him, and his journeys became\r\na continuous ovation. Money poured into his pockets from his novels and\r\nfrom his readings, and he bought for himself a home, Gadshill Place, which\r\nhe had always desired, and which is forever associated with his memory.\r\nThough he spent the greater part of his time and strength in travel at this\r\nperiod, nothing is more characteristic of the man than the intense energy\r\nwith which he turned from his lecturing to his novels, and then, for\r\nrelaxation, gave himself up to what he called the magic lantern of the\r\nLondon streets.\r\n\r\nIn 1842, while still a young man, Dickens was invited to visit the United\r\nStates and Canada, where his works were even better known than in England,\r\nand where he was received as the guest of the nation and treated with every\r\nmark of honor and appreciation. At this time America was, to most\r\nEuropeans, a kind of huge fairyland, where money sprang out of the earth,\r\nand life was happy as a long holiday. Dickens evidently shared this rosy\r\nview, and his romantic expectations were naturally disappointed. The crude,\r\nunfinished look of the big country seems to have roused a strong prejudice\r\nin his mind, which was not overcome at the time of his second visit,\r\ntwenty-five years later, and which brought forth the harsh criticism of his\r\n_American Notes_ (1842) and of _Martin Chuzzlewit_ (1843-1844). These two\r\nunkind books struck a false note, and Dickens began to lose something of\r\nhis great popularity. In addition he had spent money beyond his income. His\r\ndomestic life, which had been at first very happy, became more and more\r\nirritating, until he separated from his wife in 1858. To get inspiration,\r\nwhich seemed for a time to have failed, he journeyed to Italy, but was\r\ndisappointed. Then he turned back to the London streets, and in the five\r\nyears from 1848 to 1853 appeared _Dombey and Son, David Copperfield_, and\r\n_Bleak House_,--three remarkable novels, which indicate that he had\r\nrediscovered his own power and genius. Later he resumed the public\r\nreadings, with their public triumph and applause, which soon came to be a\r\nnecessity to one who craved popularity as a hungry man craves bread. These\r\nexcitements exhausted Dickens, physically and spiritually, and death was\r\nthe inevitable result. He died in 1870, over his unfinished _Edwin Drood_,\r\nand was buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nDICKENS'S WORK IN VIEW OF HIS LIFE. A glance through even this\r\nunsatisfactory biography gives us certain illuminating suggestions in\r\nregard to all of Dickens's work. First, as a child, poor and lonely,\r\nlonging for love and for society, he laid the foundation for those\r\nheartrending pictures of children, which have moved so many readers to\r\nunaccustomed tears. Second, as clerk in a lawyer's office and in the\r\ncourts, he gained his knowledge of an entirely different side of human\r\nlife. Here he learned to understand both the enemies and the victims of\r\nsociety, between whom the harsh laws of that day frequently made no\r\ndistinction. Third, as a reporter, and afterwards as manager of various\r\nnewspapers, he learned the trick of racy writing, and of knowing to a\r\nnicety what would suit the popular taste. Fourth, as an actor, always an\r\nactor in spirit, he seized upon every dramatic possibility, every tense\r\nsituation, every peculiarity of voice and gesture in the people whom he\r\nmet, and reproduced these things in his novels, exaggerating them in the\r\nway that most pleased his audience.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn from his outward training to his inner disposition we find two\r\nstrongly marked elements. The first is his excessive imagination, which\r\nmade good stories out of incidents that ordinarily pass unnoticed, and\r\nwhich described the commonest things--a street, a shop, a fog, a lamp-post,\r\na stagecoach--with a wealth of detail and of romantic suggestion that makes\r\nmany of his descriptions like lyric poems. The second element is his\r\nextreme sensibility, which finds relief only in laughter and tears. Like\r\nshadow and sunshine these follow one another closely throughout all his\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nRemembering these two things, his training and disposition, we can easily\r\nforesee the kind of novel he must produce. He will be sentimental,\r\nespecially over children and outcasts; he will excuse the individual in\r\nview of the faults of society; he will be dramatic or melodramatic; and his\r\nsensibility will keep him always close to the public, studying its tastes\r\nand playing with its smiles and tears. If pleasing the public be in itself\r\nan art, then Dickens is one of our greatest artists. And it is well to\r\nremember that in pleasing his public there was nothing of the hypocrite or\r\ndemagogue in his make-up. He was essentially a part of the great drifting\r\npanoramic crowd that he loved. His sympathetic soul made all their joys and\r\ngriefs his own. He fought against injustice; he championed the weak against\r\nthe strong; he gave courage to the faint, and hope to the weary in heart;\r\nand in the love which the public gave him in return he found his best\r\nreward. Here is the secret of Dickens's unprecedented popular success, and\r\nwe may note here a very significant parallel with Shakespeare. The great\r\ndifferent in the genius and work of the two men does not change the fact\r\nthat each won success largely because he studied and pleased his public.\r\n\r\nGENERAL PLAN OF DICKENS'S NOVELS. An interesting suggestion comes to us\r\nfrom a study of the conditions which led to Dickens's first three novels.\r\n_Pickwick_ was written, at the suggestion of an editor, for serial\r\npublication. Each chapter was to be accompanied by a cartoon by Seymor (a\r\ncomic artist of the day), and the object was to amuse the public, and,\r\nincidentally, to sell the paper. The result was a series of characters and\r\nscenes and incidents which for vigor and boundless fun have never been\r\nequaled in our language. Thereafter, no matter what he wrote, Dickins was\r\nlbeled a humorist. Like a certain American writer of our own generation,\r\neverything he said, whether for a feast or a funeral, was spposed to\r\ncontain a laugh. In a word, he was the victim of his own book. Dickens was\r\nkeen enough to understand his danger, and his next novel, _Oliver Twist_,\r\nhad the serious purpose of  mitigating the evils under which the poor were\r\nsuffering. Its hero was a poor child, the unfortunate victim of society;\r\nand, in order to draw attention to the real need, Dickens exaggerated the\r\nwoeful condition of the poor, and filled his pages with sentiment which\r\neasily slipped over into sentimentality. This also was a popular success,\r\nand in his third novel, _Nicholas Nickleby,_ and indeed in most of his\r\nremaining works, Dickens combined the principles of his first two books,\r\ngiving us mirth on the one hand, injustice and suffering on the other;\r\nmingling humor and pathos, tears and laughter, as we find them in life\r\nitself. And in order to increase the lights and shadows in his scenes, and\r\nto give greater dramatic effect to his narrative, he introduced odious and\r\nlothsome characters, and made vice more hateful by contrasting it with\r\ninnocence and virtue.\r\n\r\nWe find, therefore, in most of Dickens's novels three or four widely\r\ndifferent types of character: first, the innocent little child, like\r\nOliver, Joe, Paul, Tiny Tim, and Little Nell, appealing powerfully to the\r\nchild love in every human heart; scond, the horrible or grotesque foil,\r\nlike Sqeers, Fagin, Quilp, Uriah Heep, and Bill Sykes; third, the\r\ngrandiloquent or broadly humorous fellow, the fun maker, like Micawber and\r\nSam Weller; and fourth, a tenderly or powerfully drawn figure, like Lady\r\nDeadlock of _Bleak House,_ and Sydney Carton of _A Tale of Two Cities,_\r\nwhich rise to the dignity of true characters. We note also that most of\r\nDickens's novels belong decidely to the class of purpose or problem novels.\r\nThus _Bleak House_ attacks \"the law's delays\"; _Little Dorrit,_ the\r\ninjustice which persecutes poor debtors; _Nicholas Nickleby,_ the abuses of\r\ncharity schools and brutal schoolmasters; and _Oliver Twist,_ the\r\nunnecessary degradation and suffering of the poor in English workhouses.\r\nDickens's serious purpose was to make the novel the instrument of morality\r\nand justice, and whatver we may think of the exaggeration of his\r\ncharacters, it is certain that his stories did more to correct the general\r\nselfishness and injustice of society toward the poor than all the works of\r\nother literary men of his age combined.\r\n\r\nTHE LIMITATIONS OF DICKENS. Any severe criticism of Dickens as a novelist\r\nmust seem, at first glance, unkind an unnecessary. In almost every house he\r\nis a welcome guest, a personal friend who has beguiled many an hour with\r\nhis stories, and who has furnished us much  good laughter and a few good\r\ntears. Moreover, he has always a cheery message. He emphasizes the fact\r\nthat this is an excellant world; that some errors have crept into it, due\r\nlargely to thoughtlessness, but that they can be easily remedied by a\r\nlittle human sympathy. That is a most welcome creed to an age overburdened\r\nwith social problems; and to criticise our cheery companion seems as\r\ndiscourteous as to speak unkindly of a guest who has just left our home.\r\nBut we must consider Dickens not merely as a friend, but as a novelist, and\r\napply to his work the same standards of art which we apply to other\r\nwriters; and when we do this we are sometimes a little disappointed. We\r\nmust confess that his novels, while they contain many realistic details,\r\nseldom give the impression of reality. His characters, though we laugh or\r\nweep or shudder at them, are sometimes only caricatures, each one an\r\nexaggeration of some peculiarity, which suggest Ben Jonson's _Every Man in\r\nHis Humour_. It is Dickens's art to give his heroes sufficient reality to\r\nmake them suggest certain types of men and women whom we know; but in\r\nreading him we find ourselves often in the mental state of a man who is\r\nwatching through a microscope the swarming life of a water drop. Here are\r\nlively, bustling, extraordinary creatures, some beautiful, some grotesque,\r\nbut all far apart from the life that we know in daily experience. It is\r\ncertainly not the reality of these characters, but rather the genius of the\r\nauthor in managing them, which interests us and holds our attention.\r\nNotwithstanding this criticism, which we would gladly have omitted, Dickens\r\nis excellent reading, and his novels will continue to be popular just so\r\nlong as men enjoy a wholesome and absorbing story.\r\n\r\nWHAT TO READ. Aside from the reforms in schools and prisons and workhouses\r\nwhich Dickens accomplished, he has laid us all, rich and poor alike, under\r\na debt of gratitude. After the year 1843 the one literary work which he\r\nnever neglected was to furnish a Christmas story for his readers; and it is\r\ndue in some measure to the help of these stories, brimming over with good\r\ncheer, that Christmas has become in all English-speaking countries a season\r\nof gladness, of gift giving at home, and of remembering those less\r\nfortunate than ourselves, who are still members of a common brotherhood. If\r\nwe read nothing else of Dickens, once a year, at Christmas time, we should\r\nremember him and renew our youth by reading one of his holiday stories,--\r\n_The Cricket on the Hearth, The Chimes_, and above all the unrivaled\r\n_Christmas Carol_. The latter especially will be read and loved as long as\r\nmen are moved by the spirit of Christmas.\r\n\r\nOf the novels, _David Copperfield_ is regarded by many as Dickens's\r\nmasterpiece. It is well to begin with this novel, not simply for the\r\nunusual interest of the story, but also for the glimpse it gives us of the\r\nauthor's own boyhood and family. For pure fun and hilarity _Pickwick_ will\r\nalways be a favorite; but for artistic finish, and for the portrayal of one\r\ngreat character, Sydney Carton, nothing else that Dickens wrote is\r\ncomparable to _A Tale of Two Cities_. Here is an absorbing story, with a\r\ncarefully constructed plot, and the action moves swiftly to its thrilling,\r\ninevitable conclusion. Usually Dickens introduces several pathetic or\r\ngrotesque or laughable characters besides the main actors, and records\r\nvarious unnecessary dramatic episodes for their own sake; but in _A Tale of\r\nTwo Cities_ everything has its place in the development of the main story.\r\nThere are, as usual, many characters,--Sydney Carton, the outcast, who lays\r\ndown his life for the happiness of one whom he loves; Charles Darnay, an\r\nexiled young French noble; Dr. Manette, who has been \"recalled to life\"\r\nfrom a frightful imprisonment, and his gentle daughter Lucie, the heroine;\r\nJarvis Lorry, a lovable, old-fashioned clerk in the big banking house; the\r\nterrible Madame Defarge, knitting calmly at the door of her wine shop and\r\nrecording, with the ferocity of a tiger licking its chops, the names of all\r\nthose who are marked for vengeance; and a dozen others, each well drawn,\r\nwho play minor parts in the tragedy. The scene is laid in London and Paris,\r\nat the time of the French Revolution; and, though careless of historical\r\ndetails, Dickens reproduces the spirit of the Reign of Terror so well that\r\n_A Tale of Two Cities_ is an excellent supplement to the history of the\r\nperiod. It is written in Dickens's usual picturesque style, and reveals his\r\nusual imaginative outlook on life and his fondness for fine sentiments and\r\ndramatic episodes. Indeed, all his qualities are here shown, not\r\nbrilliantly or garishly, as in other novels, but subdued and softened, like\r\na shaded light, for artistic effect.\r\n\r\nThose who are interested in Dickens's growth and methods can hardly do\r\nbetter than to read in succession his first three novels, _Pickwick, Oliver\r\nTwist_, and _Nicholas Nickleby_, which, as we have indicated, show clearly\r\nhow he passed from fun to serious purpose, and which furnish in combination\r\nthe general plan of all his later works. For the rest, we can only indicate\r\nthose which, in our personal judgment, seem best worth reading,--_Bleak\r\nHouse, Dombey and Son, Our Mutual Friend_, and _Old Curiosity Shop_,--but\r\nwe are not yet far enough away from the first popular success of these\r\nworks to determine their permanent value and influence.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY (1811-1863)\r\n\r\nAs the two most successful novelists of their day, it is natural for us, as\r\nit was for their personal friends and admirers, to compare Dickens and\r\nThackeray with respect to their life and work, and their attitude toward\r\nthe world in which they lived. Dickens, after a desperately hard struggle\r\nin his boyhood, without friends or higher education, comes into manhood\r\ncheery, self-confident, energetic, filled with the joy of his work; and in\r\nthe world, which had at first treated him so harshly, he finds good\r\neverywhere, even in the jails and in the slums, simply because he is\r\nlooking for it. Thackeray, after a boyhood spent in the best of English\r\nschools, with money, friends, and comforts of every kind, faces life\r\ntimidly, distrustfully, and dislikes the literary work which makes him\r\nfamous. He has a gracious and lovable personality, is kind of heart, and\r\nreveres all that is pure and good in life; yet he is almost cynical toward\r\nthe world which uses him so well, and finds shams, deceptions, vanities\r\neverywhere, because he looks for them. One finds what one seeks in this\r\nworld, but it is perhaps significant that Dickens sought his golden fleece\r\namong plain people, and Thackeray in high society. The chief difference\r\nbetween the two novelists, however, is not one of environment but of\r\ntemperament. Put Thackeray in a workhouse, and he will still find material\r\nfor another _Book of Snobs;_ put Dickens in society, and he cannot help\r\nfinding undreamed-of possibilities among bewigged and bepowdered high lords\r\nand ladies. For Dickens is romantic and emotional, and interprets the world\r\nlargely through his imagination; Thackeray is the realist and moralist, who\r\njudges solely by observation and reflection. He aims to give us a true\r\npicture of the society of his day, and as he finds it pervaded by intrigues\r\nand snobbery he proceeds to satirize it and point out its moral evils. In\r\nhis novels he is influenced by Swift and Fielding, but he is entirely free\r\nfrom the bitterness of the one and the coarseness of the other, and his\r\nsatire is generally softened by a noble tenderness. Taken together, the\r\nnovels of Dickens and Thackeray give us a remarkable picture of all classes\r\nof English society in the middle of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Thackeray was born in 1811, in Calcutta, where his father held a\r\ncivil position under the Indian government. When the boy was five years old\r\nhis father died, and the mother returned with her child to England.\r\nPresently she married again, and Thackeray was sent to the famous\r\nCharterhouse school, of which he has given us a vivid picture in _The\r\nNewcomes_. Such a school would have been a veritable heaven to Dickens, who\r\nat this time was tossed about between poverty and ambition; but Thackeray\r\ndetested it for its rude manners, and occasionally referred to it as the\r\n\"Slaughterhouse.\" Writing to his mother he says: \"There are three hundred\r\nand seventy boys in the school. I wish, there were only three hundred and\r\nsixty-nine.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1829 Thackeray entered Trinity College, Cambridge, but left after less\r\nthan two years, without taking a degree, and went to Germany and France\r\nwhere he studied with the idea of becoming an artist. When he became of\r\nage, in 1832, he came into possession of a comfortable fortune, returned to\r\nEngland, and settled down in the Temple to study law. Soon he began to\r\ndislike the profession intensely, and we have in _Pendennis_ a reflection\r\nof his mental attitude toward the law and the young men who studied it. He\r\nsoon lost his fortune, partly by gambling and speculation, partly by\r\nunsuccessful attempts at running a newspaper, and at twenty-two began for\r\nthe first time to earn his own living, as an artist and illustrator. An\r\ninteresting meeting between Thackeray and Dickens at this time (1836)\r\nsuggests the relative importance of the two writers. Seymour, who was\r\nillustrating the _Pickwick Papers_, had just died, and Thackeray called\r\nupon Dickens with a few drawings and asked to be allowed to continue the\r\nillustrations. Dickens was at this time at the beginning of his great\r\npopularity. The better literary artist, whose drawings were refused, was\r\nalmost unknown, and had to work hard for more than ten years before he\r\nreceived recognition. Disappointed by his failure as an illustrator, he\r\nbegan his literary career by writing satires on society for _Fraser's\r\nMagazine_. This was the beginning of his success; but though the\r\n_Yellowplush Papers, The Great Hoggarty Diamond, Catherine, The Fitz\r\nBoodlers, The Book of Snobs, Barry Lyndon_, and various other immature\r\nworks made him known to a few readers of _Punch_ and of _Fraser's\r\nMagazine_, it was not till the publication of _Vanity Fair_ (1847-1848)\r\nthat he began to be recognized as one of the great novelists of his day.\r\nAll his earlier works are satires, some upon society, others upon the\r\npopular novelists,--Bulwer, Disraeli, and especially Dickens,--with whose\r\nsentimental heroes and heroines he had no patience whatever. He had\r\nmarried, meanwhile, in 1836, and for a few years was very happy in his\r\nhome. Then disease and insanity fastened upon his young wife, and she was\r\nplaced in an asylum. The whole after life of our novelist was darkened by\r\nthis loss worse than death. He became a man of the clubs, rather than of\r\nhis own home, and though his wit and kindness made him the most welcome of\r\nclubmen, there was an undercurrent of sadness in all that he wrote. Long\r\nafterwards he said that, though his marriage ended in shipwreck, he \"would\r\ndo it over again; for behold Love is the crown and completion of all\r\nearthly good.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the moderate success of _Vanity Fair_, Thackeray wrote the three\r\nnovels of his middle life upon which his fame chiefly rests,--_Pendennis_\r\nin 1850, _Henry Esmond_ in 1852, and _The Newcomes_ in 1855. Dickens's\r\ngreat popular success as a lecturer and dramatic reader had led to a\r\ngeneral desire on the part of the public to see and to hear literary men,\r\nand Thackeray, to increase his income, gave two remarkable courses of\r\nlectures, the first being _English Humorists of the Eighteenth Century_,\r\nand the second _The Four Georges_,--both courses being delivered with\r\ngratifying success in England and especially in America. Dickens, as we\r\nhave seen, was disappointed in America and vented his displeasure in\r\noutrageous criticism; but Thackeray, with his usual good breeding, saw only\r\nthe best side of his generous entertainers, and in both his public and\r\nprivate utterances emphasized the virtues of the new land, whose restless\r\nenergy seemed to fascinate him. Unlike Dickens, he had no confidence in\r\nhimself when he faced an audience, and like most literary men he disliked\r\nlecturing, and soon gave it up. In 1860 he became editor of the _Cornhill\r\nMagazine_, which prospered in his hands, and with a comfortable income he\r\nseemed just ready to do his best work for the world (which has always\r\nbelieved that he was capable of even better things than he ever wrote) when\r\nhe died suddenly in 1863. His body lies buried in Kensal Green, and only a\r\nbust does honor to his memory in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF THACKERAY. The beginner will do well to omit the earlier satires\r\nof Thackeray, written while he was struggling to earn a living from the\r\nmagazines, and open _Henry Esmond_ (1852), his most perfect novel, though\r\nnot the most widely known and read. The fine historical and literary,\r\nflavor of this story is one of its most marked characteristics, and only\r\none who knows something of the history and literature of the eighteenth\r\ncentury can appreciate its value. The hero, Colonel Esmond; relates his own\r\nstory, carrying the reader through the courts and camps of Queen Anne's\r\nreign, and giving the most complete and accurate picture of a past age that\r\nhas ever appeared in a novel. Thackeray is, as we have said, a realist, and\r\nhe begins his story by adopting the style and manner of a scholarly\r\ngentleman of the period he is describing. He has an extraordinary knowledge\r\nof eighteenth-century literature, and he reproduces its style in detail,\r\ngoing so far as to insert in his narrative an alleged essay from the\r\n_Tatler_. And so perfectly is it done that it is impossible to say wherein\r\nit differs from the style of Addison and Steele.\r\n\r\nIn his matter also Thackeray is realistic, reflecting not the pride and\r\npomp of war, which are largely delusions, but its brutality and barbarism,\r\nwhich are all too real; painting generals and leaders, not as the newspaper\r\nheroes to whom we are accustomed, but as moved by intrigues, petty\r\njealousies, and selfish ambitions; showing us the great Duke of Marlborough\r\nnot as the military hero, the idol of war-crazed multitudes, but as without\r\npersonal honor, and governed by despicable avarice. In a word, Thackeray\r\ngives us the \"back stairs\" view of war, which is, as a rule, totally\r\nneglected in our histories. When he deals with the literary men of the\r\nperiod, he uses the same frank realism, showing us Steele and Addison and\r\nother leaders, not with halos about their heads, as popular authors, but in\r\nslippers and dressing gowns, smoking a pipe in their own rooms, or else\r\ngrowing tipsy and hilarious in the taverns,--just as they appeared in daily\r\nlife. Both in style and in matter, therefore, _Esmond_ deserves to rank as\r\nprobably the best historical novel in our language.\r\n\r\nThe plot of the story is, like most of Thackeray's plots, very slight, but\r\nperfectly suited to the novelist's purpose. The plans of his characters\r\nfail; their ideals grow dim; there is a general disappearance of youthful\r\nambitions. There is a love story at the center; but the element of romance,\r\nwhich furnishes the light and music and fragrance of love, is\r\ninconspicuous. The hero, after ten years of devotion to a young woman, a\r\nparagon of beauty, finally marries her mother, and ends with a few pious\r\nobservations concerning Heaven's mercy and his own happy lot. Such an\r\nending seems disappointing, almost bizarre, in view of the romantic novels\r\nto which we are accustomed; but we must remember that Thackeray's purpose\r\nwas to paint life as he saw it, and that in life men and things often take\r\na different way from that described in romances. As we grow acquainted with\r\nThackeray's characters, we realize that no other ending was possible to his\r\nstory, and conclude that his plot, like his style, is perhaps as near\r\nperfection as a realistic novelist can ever come.\r\n\r\n_Vanity Fair_ (1847--1848) is the best known of Thackeray's novels. It was\r\nhis first great work, and was intended to express his own views of the\r\nsocial life about him, and to protest against the overdrawn heroes of\r\npopular novels. He takes for his subject that Vanity Fair to which\r\nChristian and Faithful were conducted on their way to the Heavenly City, as\r\nrecorded in _Pilgrim's Progress_. In this fair there are many different\r\nbooths, given over to the sale of \"all sorts of vanities,\" and as we go\r\nfrom one to another we come in contact with \"juggling, cheats, games,\r\nplays, fools, apes, knaves, rogues, and that of every kind.\" Evidently this\r\nis a picture of one side of social life; but the difference between Bunyan\r\nand Thackeray is simply this,--that Bunyan made Vanity Fair a small\r\nincident in a long journey, a place through which most of us pass on our\r\nway to better things; while Thackeray, describing high society in his own\r\nday, makes it a place of long sojourn, wherein his characters spend the\r\ngreater part of their lives. Thackeray styles this work \"a novel without a\r\nhero.\" The whole action of the story, which is without plot or development,\r\nrevolves about two women,--Amelia, a meek creature of the milk-and-water\r\ntype, and Becky Sharp, a keen, unprincipled intriguer, who lets nothing\r\nstand in the way of her selfish desire to get the most out of the fools who\r\nlargely constitute society. On the whole, it is the most powerful but not\r\nthe most wholesome of Thackeray's works.\r\n\r\nIn his second important novel, _Pendennis_ (1849-1850), we have a\r\ncontinuation of the satire on society begun in _Vanity Fair_. This novel,\r\nwhich the beginner should read after _Esmond_, is interesting to us for two\r\nreasons,--because it reflects more of the details of Thackeray's life than\r\nall his other writings, and because it contains one powerfully drawn\r\ncharacter who is a perpetual reminder of the danger of selfishness. The\r\nhero is \"neither angel nor imp,\" in Thackeray's words, but the typical\r\nyoung man of society, whom he knows thoroughly, and whom he paints exactly\r\nas he is,--a careless, good-natured but essentially selfish person, who\r\ngoes through life intent on his own interests. _Pendennis_ is a profound\r\nmoral study, and the most powerful arraignment of well-meaning selfishness\r\nin our literature, not even excepting George Eliot's _Romola_, which it\r\nsuggests.\r\n\r\nTwo other novels, _The Newcomes_ (1855) and _The Virginians_ (1859),\r\ncomplete the list of Thackeray's great works of fiction. The former is a\r\nsequel to _Pendennis_, and the latter to _Henry Esmond;_ and both share the\r\ngeneral fate of sequels in not being quite equal in power or interest to\r\ntheir predecessors. _The Newcomes_, however, deserves a very high place,--\r\nsome critics, indeed, placing it at the head of the author's works. Like\r\nall Thackeray's novels, it is a story of human frailty; but here the\r\nauthor's innate gentleness and kindness are seen at their best, and the\r\nhero is perhaps the most genuine and lovable of all his characters.\r\n\r\nThackeray is known in English literature as an essayist as well as a\r\nnovelist. His _English Humorists_ and _The Four Georges_ are among the\r\nfinest essays of the nineteenth century. In the former especially,\r\nThackeray shows not only a wide knowledge but an extraordinary\r\nunderstanding of his subject. Apparently this nineteenth-century writer\r\nknows Addison, Fielding, Swift, Smollett, and other great writers of the\r\npast century almost as intimately as one knows his nearest friend; and he\r\ngives us the fine flavor of their humor in a way which no other writer,\r\nsave perhaps Larnb, has ever rivaled.[240] _The Four Georges_ is in a vein\r\nof delicate satire, and presents a rather unflattering picture of four of\r\nEngland's rulers and of the courts in which they moved. Both these works\r\nare remarkable for their exquisite style, their gentle humor, their keen\r\nliterary criticisms, and for the intimate knowledge and sympathy which\r\nmakes the' people of a past age live once more in the written pages.\r\n\r\nGENERAL CHARACTERISTICS. In treating of Thackeray's view of life, as\r\nreflected in his novels, critics vary greatly, and the following summary\r\nmust be taken not as a positive judgment but only as an attempt to express\r\nthe general impression of his works on an uncritical reader. He is first of\r\na realist, who paints life as he sees it. As he says himself, \"I have no\r\nbrains above my eyes; I describe what I see.\". His pictures of certain\r\ntypes, notably the weak and vicious elements of society, are accurate and\r\ntrue to life, but they seem to play too large a part in his books, and have\r\nperhaps too greatly influenced his general judgment of humanity. An\r\nexcessive sensibility, or the capacity for fine feelings and emotions, is a\r\nmarked characteristic of Thackeray, as it is of Dickens and Carlyle. He is\r\neasily offended, as they are, by the shams of society; but he cannot find\r\nan outlet, as Dickens does, in laughter and tears, and he is too gentle to\r\nfollow Carlyle in violent denunciations and prophecies. He turns to\r\nsatire,--influenced, doubtless, by eighteenth-century literature which he\r\nknew so well, and in which satire played too large a part.[241] His satire\r\nis never personal, like Pope's, or brutal, like Swift's, and is tempered by\r\nkindness and humor; but it is used too freely, and generally lays too much\r\nemphasis on faults and foibles to be considered a true picture of any large\r\nclass of English society.\r\n\r\nBesides being a realist and satirist, Thackeray is essentially a moralist,\r\nlike Addison, aiming definitely in all his work at producing a moral\r\nimpression. So much does he revere goodness, and so determined is he that\r\nhis Pendennis or his Becky Sharp shall be judged at their true value, that\r\nhe is not content, like Shakespeare, to be simply an artist, to tell an\r\nartistic tale and let it speak its own message; he must explain and\r\nemphasize the moral significance of his work. There is no need to consult\r\nour own conscience over the actions of Thackeray's characters; the beauty\r\nof virtue and the ugliness of vice are evident on every page.\r\n\r\nWhatever we may think of Thackeray's matter, there is one point in which\r\ncritics are agreed,--that he is master of a pure and simple English style.\r\nWhether his thought be sad or humorous, commonplace or profound, he\r\nexpresses it perfectly, without effort or affectation. In all his work\r\nthere is a subtle charm, impossible to describe, which gives the impression\r\nthat we are listening to a gentleman. And it is the ease, the refinement,\r\nthe exquisite naturalness of Thackeray's style that furnishes a large part\r\nof our pleasure in reading him.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARY ANN EVANS, GEORGE ELIOT (1819-1880)\r\n\r\nIn nearly all the writers of the Victorian Age we note, on the one hand, a\r\nstrong intellectual tendency to analyze the problems of life, and on the\r\nother a tendency to teach, that is, to explain to men the method by which\r\nthese problems may be solved. The novels especially seem to lose sight of\r\nthe purely artistic ideal of writing, and to aim definitely at moral\r\ninstruction. In George Eliot both these tendencies reach a climax. She is\r\nmore obviously, more consciously a preacher and moralizer than any of her\r\ngreat contemporaries. Though profoundly religious at heart, she was largely\r\noccupied by the scientific spirit of the age; and finding no religious\r\ncreed or political system satisfactory, she fell back upon duty as the\r\nsupreme law of life. All her novels aim, first, to show in individuals the\r\nplay of universal moral forces, and second, to establish the moral law as\r\nthe basis of human society. Aside from this moral teaching, we look to\r\nGeorge Eliot for the reflection of country life in England, just as we look\r\nto Dickens for pictures of the city streets, and to Thackeray for the\r\nvanities of society. Of all the women writer's who have helped and are\r\nstill helping to place our English novels at the head of the world's\r\nfiction, she holds at present unquestionably the highest rank.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Mary Ann (or Marian) Evans, known to us by her pen name of George\r\nEliot, began to write late in life, when nearly forty years of age, and\r\nattained the leading position among living English novelists in the ten\r\nyears between 1870 and 1880, after Thackeray and Dickens had passed away.\r\nShe was born at Arbury Farm, Warwickshire, some twenty miles from\r\nStratford-on-Avon, in 1819. Her parents were plain, honest folk, of the\r\nfarmer class, who brought her up in the somewhat strict religious manner of\r\nthose days. Her father seems to have been a man of sterling integrity and\r\nof practical English sense,--one of those essentially noble characters who\r\ndo the world's work silently and well, and who by their solid worth obtain\r\na position of influence among their fellow-men.\r\n\r\nA few months after George Eliot's birth the family moved to another home,\r\nin the parish of Griff, where her childhood was largely passed. The scenery\r\nof the Midland counties and many details of her own family life are\r\nreflected in her earlier novels. Thus we find her and her brother, as\r\nMaggie and Tom Tulliver, in _The Mill on the Floss;_ her aunt, as Dinah\r\nMorris, and her mother, as Mrs. Poyser, in _Adam Bede_. We have a\r\nsuggestion of her father in the hero of the latter novel, but the picture\r\nis more fully drawn as Caleb Garth, in _Middlemarch_. For a few years she\r\nstudied at two private schools for young ladies, at Nuneaton and Coventry;\r\nbut the death of her mother called her, at seventeen years of age, to take\r\nentire charge of the household. Thereafter her education was gained wholly\r\nby miscellaneous reading. We have a suggestion of her method in one of her\r\nearly letters, in which she says: \"My mind presents an assemblage of\r\ndisjointed specimens of history, ancient and modern; scraps of poetry\r\npicked up from Shakespeare, Cowper, Wordsworth, and Milton; newspaper\r\ntopics, morsels of Addison and Bacon, Latin verbs, geometry, entomology,\r\nand chemistry; reviews and metaphysics, all arrested and petrified and\r\nsmothered by the fast-thickening everyday accession of actual events,\r\nrelative anxieties, and household cares and vexations.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mary was twenty-one years old the family again moved, this time to\r\nFoleshill Road, near Coventry. Here she became acquainted with the family\r\nof Charles Bray, a prosperous ribbon manufacturer, whose house was a\r\ngathering place for the freethinkers of the neighborhood. The effect of\r\nthis liberal atmosphere upon Miss Evans, brought up in a narrow way, with\r\nno knowledge of the world, was to unsettle many of her youthful\r\nconvictions. From a narrow, intense dogmatism, she went to the other\r\nextreme of radicalism; then (about 1860) she lost all sympathy with the\r\nfreethinkers, and, being instinctively religious, seemed to be groping\r\nafter a definite faith while following the ideal of duty. This spiritual\r\nstruggle, which suggests that of Carlyle, is undoubtedly the cause of that\r\ngloom and depression which hang, like an English fog, over much of her\r\nwork; though her biographer, Cross, tells us that she was not by any means\r\na sad or gloomy woman.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 Miss Evans's father died, and the Brays took her abroad for a tour\r\nof the continent. On her return to England she wrote several liberal\r\narticles for the _Westminster Review_, and presently was made assistant\r\neditor of that magazine. Her residence in London at this time marks a\r\nturning point in her career and the real beginning of her literary life.\r\nShe made strong friendships with Spencer, Mill, and other scientists of the\r\nday, and through Spencer met George Henry Lewes, a miscellaneous writer,\r\nwhom she afterwards married.\r\n\r\nUnder his sympathetic influence she began to write fiction for the\r\nmagazines, her first story being \"Amos Barton\" (1857), which was later\r\nincluded in the _Scenes of Clerical Life_ (1858). Her first long novel,\r\n_Adam Bede_, appeared early in 1859 and met with such popular favor that to\r\nthe end of her life she despaired of ever again repeating her triumph. But\r\nthe unexpected success proved to be an inspiration, and she completed _The\r\nMill on the Floss_ and began _Silas Marner_ during the following year. Not\r\nuntil the great success of these works led to an insistent demand to know\r\nthe author did the English public learn that it was a woman, and not an\r\nEnglish clergyman, as they supposed, who had suddenly jumped to the front\r\nrank of living writers.\r\n\r\nUp to this point George Eliot had confined herself to English country life,\r\nbut now she suddenly abandoned the scenes and the people with whom she was\r\nmost familiar in order to write an historical novel. It was in 1860, while\r\ntraveling in Italy, that she formed \"the great project\" of _Romola_,--a\r\nmingling of fiction and moral philosophy, against the background of the\r\nmighty Renaissance movement. In this she was writing of things of which she\r\nhad no personal knowledge, and the book cost her many months of hard and\r\ndepressing labor. She said herself that she was a young woman when she\r\nbegan the work, and an old woman when she finished it. _Romola_ (1862--\r\n1863) was not successful with the public, and the same may be said of\r\n_Felix Holt the Radical_ (1866) and _The Spanish Gypsy_ (1868). The\r\nlast-named work was the result of the author's ambition to write a dramatic\r\npoem which should duplicate the lesson of _Romola_; and for the purpose of\r\ngathering material she visited Spain, which she had decided upon as the\r\nscene of her poetical effort. With the publication of _Middlemarch_\r\n(1871-1872) George Eliot came back again into popular favor, though this\r\nwork is less spontaneous, and more labored and pedantic, than her earlier\r\nnovels. The fault of too much analysis and moralizing was even more\r\nconspicuous in _Daniei Deronda_ (1876), which she regarded as her greatest\r\nbook. Her life during all this time was singularly uneventful, and the\r\nchief milestones along the road mark the publication of her successive\r\nnovels.\r\n\r\nDuring all the years of her literary success her husband Lewes had been a\r\nmost sympathetic friend and critic, and when he died, in 1878, the loss\r\nseemed to be more than she could bear. Her letters of this period are\r\ntouching in their loneliness and their craving for sympathy. Later she\r\nastonished everybody by marrying John Walter Cross, much younger than\r\nherself, who is known as her biographer. \"Deep down below there is a river\r\nof sadness, but ... I am able to enjoy my newly re-opened life,\" writes\r\nthis woman of sixty, who, ever since she was the girl whom we know as\r\nMaggie Tulliver, must always have some one to love and to depend upon. Her\r\nnew interest in life lasted but a few months, for she died in December of\r\nthe same year (1880). One of the best indications of her strength and her\r\nlimitations is her portrait, with its strong masculine features, suggesting\r\nboth by resemblance and by contrast that wonderful portrait of Savonarola\r\nwhich hangs over his old desk in the monastery at Florence.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF GEORGE ELIOT. These are conveniently divided into three groups,\r\ncorresponding to the three periods of her life. The first group includes\r\nall her early essays and miscellaneous work, from her translation of\r\nStrauss's _Leben Jesu_, in 1846, to her union with Lewes in 1854. The\r\nsecond group includes _Scenes of Clerical Life, Adam Bede, Mill on the\r\nFloss_, and _Silas Marner_, all published between 1858 and 1861. These four\r\nnovels of the middle period are founded on the author's own life and\r\nexperience; their scenes are laid in the country, and their characters are\r\ntaken from the stolid people of the Midlands, with whom George Eliot had\r\nbeen familiar since childhood. They are probably the author's most enduring\r\nworks. They have a naturalness, a spontaneity, at times a flash of real\r\nhumor, which are lacking in her later novels; and they show a rapid\r\ndevelopment of literary power which reaches a climax in _Silas Marner_.\r\n\r\nThe novel of Italian life, _Romola_ (1862-1863), marks a transition to the\r\nthird group, which includes three more novels,--_Felix Holt_ (1866),\r\n_Middlemarch_ (1871-1872), _Daniel Deronda_ (1876), the ambitious dramatic\r\npoem _The Spanish Gypsy_ (1868), and a collection of miscellaneous essays\r\ncalled _The Impressions of Theophrastus Such_ (1879). The general\r\nimpression, of these works is not so favorable as that produced by the\r\nnovels of the middle period. They are more labored and less interesting;\r\nthey contain much deep reflection and analysis of character, but less\r\nobservation, less delight in picturing country life as it is, and very\r\nlittle of what we call inspiration. We must add, however, that this does\r\nnot express a unanimous literary judgment, for critics are not wanting who\r\nassert that _Daniel Deronda_ is the highest expression of the author's\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nThe general character of all these novels may be described, in the author's\r\nown term, as psychologic realism. This means that George Eliot sought to do\r\nin her novels what Browning attempted in his poetry; that is, to represent\r\nthe inner struggle of a soul, and to reveal the motives, impulses, and\r\nhereditary influences which govern human action. Browning generally stops\r\nwhen he tells his story, and either lets you draw your own conclusion or\r\nelse gives you his in a few striking lines. But George Eliot is not content\r\nuntil she has minutely explained the motives of her characters and the\r\nmoral lesson to be learned from them. Moreover, it is the development of a\r\nsoul, the slow growth or decline of moral power, which chiefly interests\r\nher. Her heroes and heroines differ radically from those of Dickens and\r\nThackeray in this respect,--that when we meet the men and women of the\r\nlatter novelists, their characters are already formed, and we are\r\nreasonably sure what they will do under given circumstances. In George\r\nEliot's novels the characters develop gradually as we come to know them.\r\nThey go from weakness to strength, or from strength to weakness, according\r\nto the works that they do and the thoughts that they cherish. In _Romola_,\r\nfor instance, Tito, as we first meet him, may be either good or bad, and we\r\nknow not whether he will finally turn to the right hand or to the left. As\r\ntime passes, we see him degenerate steadily because he follows his selfish\r\nimpulses, while Romola, whose character is at first only faintly indicated,\r\ngrows into beauty and strength with every act of self-renunciation.\r\n\r\nIn these two characters, Tito and Romola, we have an epitome of our\r\nauthor's moral teaching. The principle of law was in the air during the\r\nVictorian era, and we have already noted how deeply Tennyson was influenced\r\nby it. With George Eliot law is like fate; it overwhelms personal freedom\r\nand inclination. Moral law was to her as inevitable, as automatic, as\r\ngravitation. Tito's degeneration, and the sad failure of Dorothea and\r\nLydgate in _Middlemarch_, may be explained as simply as the fall of an\r\napple, or as a bruised knee when a man loses his balance. A certain act\r\nproduces a definite moral effect on the individual; and character is the\r\nadded sum of all, the acts of a man's; life,--just as the weight of a body\r\nis the sum of the weights of many different atoms which constitute it. The\r\nmatter of rewards and punishments, therefore, needs no final judge or\r\njudgment, since these things take care of themselves automatically in a\r\nworld of inviolable moral law.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one thing more should be added to the general characteristics of\r\nGeorge Eliot's novels,--they are all rather depressing. The gladsomeness of\r\nlife, the sunshine of smiles and laughter, is denied her. It is said that\r\nonce, when her husband remarked that her novels were all essentially sad,\r\nshe wept, and answered that she must describe life as she had found it.\r\n\r\nWHAT TO READ. George Eliot's first stories are in some respects her best,\r\nthough her literary power increases during her second period, culminating\r\nin _Silas Marner_, and her psychological analysis is more evident in\r\n_Daniel Deronda_. On the whole, it is an excellent way to begin with the\r\nfreshness and inspiration of the _Scenes of Clerical Life_ and read her\r\nbooks in the order in which they were written. In the first group of novels\r\n_Adam Bede_ is the most natural, and probably interests more readers than\r\nall the others combined. _The Mill on the Floss_ has a larger personal\r\ninterest, because it reflects much of George Eliot's history and the scenes\r\nand the friends of her early life. The lack of proportion in this story,\r\nwhich gives rather too much space to the girl-and-boy experiences, is\r\nnaturally explained by the tendency in every man and woman to linger over\r\nearly memories.\r\n\r\n_Silas Marner_ is artistically the most perfect of George Eliot's novels,\r\nand we venture to analyze it as typical of her ideals and methods. We note\r\nfirst the style, which is heavy and a little self-conscious, lacking the\r\nvigor and picturesqueness of Dickens, and the grace and naturalness of\r\nThackeray. The characters are the common people of the Midlands, the hero\r\nbeing a linen weaver, a lonely outcast who hoards and gloats over his\r\nhard-earned money, is robbed, thrown into utter despair, and brought back\r\nto life and happiness by the coming of an abandoned child to his fire. In\r\nthe development of her story the author shows herself, first, a realist, by\r\nthe naturalness of her characters and the minute accuracy with which she\r\nreproduces their ways and even the accents of their speech; second, a\r\npsychologist, by the continual analysis and explanation of motives; third,\r\na moralist, by showing in each individual the action and reaction of\r\nuniversal moral forces, and especially by making every evil act bring\r\ninevitable punishment to the man who does it. Tragedy, therefore, plays a\r\nlarge part in the story; for, according to George Eliot, tragedy and\r\nsuffering walk close behind us, or lurk at every turn in the road of life.\r\nLike all her novels, _Silas Marner_ is depressing. We turn away from even\r\nthe wedding of Eppie--which is just as it should be--with a sense of\r\nsadness and incompleteness. Finally, as we close the book, we are conscious\r\nof a powerful and enduring impression of reality. Silas, the poor weaver;\r\nGodfrey Cass, the well-meaning, selfish man; Mr. Macey, the garrulous, and\r\nobservant parish clerk; Dolly Winthrop, the kind-hearted countrywoman who\r\ncannot understand the mysteries of religion and so interprets God in terms\r\nof human love,--these are real people, whom having once met we can never\r\nforget.\r\n\r\n_Romola_ has the same general moral theme as the English novels; but the\r\nscenes are entirely different, and opinion is divided as to the comparative\r\nmerit of the work. It is a study, a very profound study of moral\r\ndevelopment in one character and of moral degeneracy in another. Its\r\ncharacters and its scenes are both Italian, and the action takes place\r\nduring a critical period of the Renaissance movement, when Savonarola was\r\nat the height of his power in Florence. Here is a magnificent theme and a\r\nsuperb background for a great novel, and George Eliot read and studied till\r\nshe felt sure that she understood the place, the time, and the people of\r\nher story. _Romola_ is therefore interesting reading, in many respects the\r\nmost interesting of her works. It has been called one of our greatest\r\nhistorical novels; but as such it has one grievous fault. It is not quite\r\ntrue to the people or even to the locality which it endeavors to represent.\r\nOne who reads it here, in a new and different land, thinks only of the\r\nstory and of the novelist's power; but one who reads it on the spot which\r\nit describes, and amidst the life which it pictures, is continually haunted\r\nby the suggestion that George Eliot understood neither Italy nor the\r\nItalians. It is this lack of harmony with Italian life itself which caused\r\nMorris and Rossetti and even Browning, with all his admiration for the\r\nauthor, to lay aside the book, unable to read it with pleasure or profit.\r\nIn a word, _Romola_ is a great moral study and a very interesting book; but\r\nthe characters are not Italian, and the novel as a whole lacks the strong\r\nreality which marks George Eliot's English studies.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR NOVELISTS OF THE VICTORIAN AGE\r\n\r\nIn the three great novelists just considered we have an epitome of the\r\nfiction of the age, Dickens using the novel to solve social problems,\r\nThackeray to paint the life of society as he saw it, and George Eliot to\r\nteach the fundamental principles of morality. The influence of these three\r\nwriters is reflected in all the minor novelists of the Victorian Age. Thus,\r\nDickens is reflected in Charles Reade, Thackeray in Anthony Trollope and\r\nthe Brontë sisters, and George Eliot's psychology finds artistic expression\r\nin George Meredith. To these social and moral and realistic studies we\r\nshould add the element of romance, from which few of our modern novelist's\r\ncan long escape. The nineteenth century, which began with the romanticism\r\nof Walter Scott, returns to its first love, like a man glad to be home, in\r\nits delight over Blackmore's _Lorna Doone_ and the romances of Robert Louis\r\nStevenson.\r\n\r\nCHARLES READE. In his fondness for stage effects, for picturing the\r\nromantic side of common life, and for using the novel as the instrument of\r\nsocial reform, there is a strong suggestion of Dickens in the work of\r\nCharles Reade (1814-1884). Thus his _Peg Woffington_ is a study of stage\r\nlife from behind the scenes; _A Terrible Temptation_ is a study of social\r\nreforms and reformers; and _Put yourself in his Place_ is the picture of a\r\nworkingman who struggles against the injustice of the trades unions. His\r\nmasterpiece, _The Cloister and the Hearth_ (1861), one of our best\r\nhistorical novels, is a somewhat laborious study of student and vagabond\r\nlife in Europe in the days of the German Renaissance. It has small\r\nresemblance to George Eliot's _Romola_, whose scene is laid in Italy during\r\nthe same period; but the two works may well be read in succession, as the\r\nefforts of two very different novelists of the same period to restore the\r\nlife of an age long past.\r\n\r\nANTHONY TROLLOPE. In his realism, and especially in his conception of the\r\nnovel as the entertainment of an idle hour, Trollope (1815-1882) is a\r\nreflection of Thackeray. It would be hard to find a better duplicate of\r\nBecky Sharp, the heroine of _Vanity Fair_, for instance, than is found in\r\nLizzie Eustace, the heroine of _The Eustace Diamonds_. Trollope was the\r\nmost industrious and systematic of modern novelists, writing a definite\r\namount each day, and the wide range of his characters suggests the _Human\r\nComedy_ of Balzac. His masterpiece is _Barchester Towers_ (1857). This is a\r\nstudy of life in a cathedral town, and is remarkable for its minute\r\npictures of bishops and clergymen, with their families and dependents. It\r\nwould be well to read this novel in connection with _The Warden_ (1855),\r\n_The Last Chronicle of Barset_ (1867), and other novels of the same series,\r\nsince the scenes and characters are the same in all these books, and they\r\nare undoubtedly the best expression of the author's genius. Hawthorne says\r\nof his novels: \"They precisely suit my taste,--solid and substantial, and\r\n... just as real as if some giant had hewn a great lump out of the earth\r\nand put it under a glass case, with all the inhabitants going about their\r\ndaily business and not suspecting that they were being made a show of.\"\r\n\r\nCHARLOTTE BRONTë. We have another suggestion of Thackeray in the work of\r\nCharlotte Brontë (1816-1855). She aimed to make her novels a realistic\r\npicture of society, but she added to Thackeray's realism the element of\r\npassionate and somewhat unbalanced romanticism. The latter element was\r\npartly the expression of Miss Brontë's own nature, and partly the result of\r\nher lonely and grief-stricken life, which was darkened by a succession of\r\nfamily tragedies. It will help us to understand her work if we remember\r\nthat both Charlotte Brontë and her sister Emily[242] turned to literature\r\nbecause they found their work as governess and teacher unendurable, and\r\nsought to relieve the loneliness and sadness of their own lot by creating a\r\nnew world of the imagination. In this new world, however, the sadness of\r\nthe old remains, and all the Brontë novels have behind them an aching\r\nheart. Charlotte Brontë's best known work is _Jane Eyre_ (1847), which,\r\nwith all its faults, is a powerful and fascinating study of elemental love\r\nand hate, reminding us vaguely of one of Marlowe's tragedies. This work won\r\ninstant favor with the public, and the author was placed in the front rank\r\nof living novelists. Aside from its value as a novel, it is interesting, in\r\nmany of its early passages, as the reflection of the author's own life and\r\nexperience. _Shirley_ (1849) and _Villette_ (1853) make up the trio of\r\nnovels by which this gifted woman is generally remembered.\r\n\r\nBULWER LYTTON. Edward Bulwer Lytton (1803-1873) was an extremely versatile\r\nwriter, who tried almost every kind of novel known to the nineteenth\r\ncentury. In his early life he wrote poems and dramas, under the influence\r\nof Byron; but his first notable work, _Pelham_ (1828), one of the best of\r\nhis novels, was a kind of burlesque on the Byronic type of gentleman. As a\r\nstudy of contemporary manners in high society, _Pelham_ has a suggestion of\r\nThackeray, and the resemblance is more noticeable in other novels of the\r\nsame type, such as _Ernest Maltravers_ (1837), _The Caxtons_ (1848-1849),\r\n_My Novel_ (1853), and _Kenelm Chillingly_ (1873). We have a suggestion of\r\nDickens in at least two of Lytton's novels, _Paul Clifford_ and _Eugene\r\nAram_, the heroes of which are criminals, pictured as the victims rather\r\nthan as the oppressors of society. Lytton essayed also, with considerable\r\npopular success, the romantic novel in _The Pilgrims of the Rhine_ and\r\n_Zanoni_, and tried the ghost story in _The Haunted and the Haunters_. His\r\nfame at the present day rests largely upon his historical novels, in\r\nimitation of Walter Scott, _The Last Days of Pompeii_ (1834), _Riettza_\r\n(1835), and _Harold_ (1848), the last being his most ambitious attempt to\r\nmake the novel the supplement of history. In all his novels Lytton is\r\ninclined to sentimentalism and sensationalism, and his works, though\r\ngenerally interesting, seem hardly worthy of a high place in the history of\r\nfiction.\r\n\r\nKINGSLEY. Entirely different in spirit are the novels of the scholarly\r\nclergyman, Charles Kingsley (1819-1875). His works naturally divide\r\nthemselves into three classes. In the first are his social studies and\r\nproblem novels, such as _Alton Locke_ (1850), having for its hero a London\r\ntailor and poet, and _Yeast_ (1848), which deals with the problem of the\r\nagricultural laborer. In the second class are his historical novels,\r\n_Hereward the Wake, Hypatia_, and _Westward Ho! Hypatia_ is a dramatic\r\nstory of Christianity in contact with paganism, having its scene laid in\r\nAlexandria at the beginning of the fifth century. _Westward Ho_! (1855),\r\nhis best known work, is a stirring tale of English conquest by land and sea\r\nin the days of Elizabeth. In the third class are his various miscellaneous\r\nworks, not the least of which is _Water-Babies_, a fascinating story of a\r\nchimney sweep, which mothers read to their children at bedtime,--to the\r\ngreat delight of the round-eyed little listeners under the counterpane.\r\n\r\nMRS. GASKELL. Mrs. Elizabeth Gaskell (1810-1865) began, like Kingsley, with\r\nthe idea of making the novel the instrument of social reform. As the wife\r\nof a clergyman in Manchester, she had come in close contact with the\r\nstruggles and ideals of the industrial poor of a great city, and she\r\nreflected her sympathy as well as her observation in _Mary Barton_ (1848)\r\nand in _North and South_ (1855). Between these two problem novels she\r\npublished her masterpiece, _Cranford_, in 1853. The original of this\r\ncountry village, which is given over to spinsters, is undoubtedly\r\nKnutsford, in Cheshire, where Mrs. Gaskell had spent her childhood. The\r\nsympathy, the keen observation, and the gentle humor with which the small\r\naffairs of a country village are described make _Cranford_ one of the most\r\ndelightful stories in the English language. We are indebted to Mrs. Gaskell\r\nalso for the _Life of Charlotte Brontë_, which is one of our best\r\nbiographies.\r\n\r\nBLACKMORE. Richard Doddridge Blackrhore (1825--1900) was a prolific writer,\r\nbut he owes his fame almost entirely to one splendid novel, _Lorna Doone_,\r\nwhich was published in 1869. The scene of this fascinating romance is laid\r\nin Exmoor in the seventeenth century. The story abounds in romantic scenes\r\nand incidents; its descriptions of natural scenery are unsurpassed; the\r\nrhythmic language is at times almost equal to poetry; and the whole tone of\r\nthe book is wholesome and refreshing. Altogether it would be hard to find a\r\nmore delightful romance in any language, and it well deserves the place it\r\nhas won as one of the classics of our literature. Other works of Blackmore\r\nwhich will repay the reader are _Clara Vaughan_ (1864), his first novel,\r\n_The Maid of Sker_ (1872), _Springhaven_ (1887), _Perlycross_ (1894), and\r\n_Tales from the Telling House_ (1896); but none of these, though he counted\r\nthem his best work, has met with the same favor as _Lorna Doone_.\r\n\r\nMEREDITH. So much does George Meredith (1828-1909) belong to our own day\r\nthat it is difficult to think of him as one of the Victorian novelists. His\r\nfirst notable work, _The Ordeal of Richard Feverel_, was published in 1859,\r\nthe same year as George Eliot's _Adam Bede;_ but it was not till the\r\npublication of _Diana of the Crossways_ in 1885, that his power as a\r\nnovelist was widely recognized. He resembles Browning not only in his\r\ncondensed style, packed with thought, but also in this respect,--that he\r\nlabored for years in obscurity, and after much of his best work was\r\npublished and apparently forgotten he slowly won the leading place in\r\nEnglish fiction. We are still too near him to speak of the permanence of\r\nhis work, but a casual reading of any of his novels suggests a comparison\r\nand a contrast with George Eliot. Like her, he is a realist and a\r\npsychologist; but while George Eliot uses tragedy to teach a moral lesson,\r\nMeredith depends more upon comedy, making vice not terrible but ridiculous.\r\nFor the hero or heroine of her novel George Eliot invariably takes an\r\nindividual, and shows in each one the play of universal moral forces.\r\nMeredith constructs a type-man as a hero, and makes this type express his\r\npurpose and meaning. So his characters seldom speak naturally, as George\r\nEliot's do; they are more like Browning's characters in packing a whole\r\nparagraph into a single sentence or an exclamation. On account of his\r\nenigmatic style and his psychology, Meredith will never be popular; but by\r\nthoughtful men and women he will probably be ranked among our greatest\r\nwriters of fiction. The simplest and easiest of his novels for a beginner\r\nis _The Adventures of Henry Richmond_ (1871). Among the best of his works,\r\nbesides the two mentioned above, are _Beauchamp's Career_ (1876) and _The\r\nEgoist_ (1879). The latter is, in our personal judgment, one of the\r\nstrongest and most convincing novels of the Victorian Age.\r\n\r\nHARDY. Thomas Hardy (1840-) seems, like Meredith, to belong to the present\r\nrather than to a past age, and an interesting comparison may be drawn\r\nbetween these two novelists. In style, Meredith is obscure and difficult,\r\nwhile Hardy is direct and simple, aiming at realism in all things. Meredith\r\nmakes man the most important phenomenon in the universe; and the struggles\r\nof men are brightened by the hope of victory. Hardy makes man an\r\ninsignificant part of the world, struggling against powers greater than\r\nhimself,--sometimes against systems which he cannot reach or influence,\r\nsometimes against a kind of grim world-spirit who delights in making human\r\naffairs go wrong. He is, therefore, hardly a realist, but rather a man\r\nblinded by pessimism; and his novels, though generally powerful and\r\nsometimes fascinating, are not pleasant or wholesome reading. From the\r\nreader's view point some of his earlier works, like the idyllic love story\r\n_Under the Greenwood Tree_ (1872) and _A Pair of Blue Eyes_ (1873), are the\r\nmost interesting. Hardy became noted, however, when he published _Far from\r\nthe Madding Crowd_, a book which, when it appeared anonymously in the\r\n_Cornhill Magazine_ (1874), was generally attributed to George Eliot, for\r\nthe simple reason that no other novelist was supposed to be capable of\r\nwriting it. _The Return of the Native_ (1878) and _The Woodlanders_ are\r\ngenerally regarded as Hardy's masterpieces; but two novels of our own day,\r\n_Tess of the D'Ubervilles_ (1891) and _Jude the Obscure_ (1895), are better\r\nexpressions of Hardy's literary art and of his gloomy philosophy.\r\n\r\nSTEVENSON. In pleasing contrast with Hardy is Robert Louis Stevenson\r\n(1850-1894), a brave, cheery, wholesome spirit, who has made us all braver\r\nand cheerier by what he has written. Aside from their intrinsic value,\r\nStevenson's novels are interesting in this respect,--that they mark a\r\nreturn to the pure romanticism of Walter Scott. The novel of the nineteenth\r\ncentury had, as we have shown, a very definite purpose. It aimed not only\r\nto represent life but to correct it, and to offer a solution to pressing\r\nmoral and social problems. At the end of the century Hardy's gloom in the\r\nface of modern social conditions became oppressive, and Stevenson broke\r\naway from it into that land of delightful romance in which youth finds an\r\nanswer to all its questions. Problems differ, but youth is ever the same,\r\nand therefore Stevenson will probably be regarded by future generations as\r\none of our most enduring writers. To his life, with its \"heroically happy\"\r\nstruggle, first against poverty, then against physical illness, it is\r\nimpossible to do justice in a short article. Even a longer biography is\r\ninadequate, for Stevenson's spirit, not the incidents of his life, is the\r\nimportant thing; and the spirit has no biographer. Though he had written\r\nmuch better work earlier, he first gained fame by his _Treasure Island_\r\n(1883), an absorbing story of pirates and of a hunt for buried gold. _Dr.\r\nJekyll and Mr. Hyde_ (1886) is a profound ethical parable, in which,\r\nhowever, Stevenson leaves the psychology and the minute analysis of\r\ncharacter to his readers, and makes the story the chief thing in his novel.\r\n_Kidnapped_ (1886), _The Master of Ballantrae_ (1889), and _David Balfour_\r\n(1893) are novels of adventure, giving us vivid pictures of Scotch life.\r\nTwo romances left unfinished by his early death in Samoa are _The Weir of\r\nHermiston_ and _St. Ives_. The latter was finished by Quiller-Couch in\r\n1897; the former is happily just as Stevenson left it, and though\r\nunfinished is generally regarded as his masterpiece. In addition to these\r\nnovels, Stevenson wrote a large number of essays, the best of which are\r\ncollected in _Virginibus Puerisque, Familiar Studies of Men and Books_, and\r\n_Memories and Portraits_. Delightful sketches of his travels are found in\r\n_An Inland Voyage_ (1878), _Travels with a Donkey_ (1879), _Across the\r\nPlains_ (1892), and _The Amateur Emigrant_ (1894). _Underwoods_ (1887) is\r\nan exquisite little volume of poetry, and _A Child's Garden of Verses_ is\r\none of the books that mothers will always keep to read to their children.\r\n\r\nIn all his books Stevenson gives the impression of a man at play rather\r\nthan at work, and the reader soon shares in the happy spirit of the author.\r\nBecause of his beautiful personality, and because of the love and\r\nadmiration he awakened for himself in multitudes of readers, we are\r\nnaturally inclined to exaggerate his importance as a writer. However that\r\nmay be, a study of his works shows him to be a consummate literary artist.\r\nHis style is always simple, often perfect, and both in his manner and in\r\nhis matter he exercises a profound influence, on the writers of the present\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. ESSAYISTS OF THE VICTORIAN AGE\r\n\r\nTHOMAS BABINGTON MACAULAY (1800-1859)\r\n\r\nMacaulay is one of the most typical figures of the nineteenth century.\r\nThough not a great writer, if we compare him with Browning or Thackeray, he\r\nwas more closely associated than any of his literary contemporaries with\r\nthe social and political struggles of the age. While Carlyle was\r\nproclaiming the gospel of labor, and Dickens writing novels to better the\r\ncondition of the poor, Macaulay went vigorously to work on what he thought\r\nto be the most important task of the hour, and by his brilliant speeches\r\ndid perhaps more than any other single man to force the passage of the\r\nfamous Reform Bill. Like many of the Elizabethans, he was a practical man\r\nof affairs rather than a literary man, and though we miss in his writings\r\nthe imagination and the spiritual insight which stamp the literary genius,\r\nwe have the impression always of a keen, practical, honest mind, which\r\nlooks at present problems in the light of past experience. Moreover, the\r\nman himself, with his marvelous mind, his happy spirit, and his absolute\r\nintegrity of character, is an inspiration to better living.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Macaulay was born at Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, in 1800. His\r\nfather, of Scotch descent, was at one time governor of the Sierra Leone\r\ncolony for liberated negroes, and devoted a large part of his life to the\r\nabolition of the slave trade. His mother, of Quaker parentage, was a\r\nbrilliant, sensitive woman, whose character is reflected in that of her\r\nson. The influence of these two, and the son's loyal devotion to his\r\nfamily, can best be read in Trevelyan's interesting biography.\r\n\r\nAs a child, Macaulay is strongly suggestive of Coleridge. At three years of\r\nage he began to read eagerly; at five he \"talked like a book\"; at ten he\r\nhad written a compendium of universal history, besides various hymns, verse\r\nromances, arguments for Christianity, and one ambitious epic poem. The\r\nhabit of rapid reading, begun in childhood, continued throughout his life,\r\nand the number and vari ety of books which he read is almost incredible.\r\nHis memory was phenomenal. He could repeat long poems and essays after a\r\nsingle reading; he could quote not only passages but the greater part of\r\nmany books, including _Pilgrim's Progress, Paradise Lost_, and various\r\nnovels like _Clarissa_. Once, to test his memory, he recited two newspaper\r\npoems which he had read in a coffeehouse forty years before, and which he\r\nhad never thought of in the interval.\r\n\r\nAt twelve years of age this remarkable boy was sent to a private school at\r\nLittle Shelford, and at eighteen he eqgered Trinity College, Cambridge.\r\nHere he made a reputation as a classical scholar and a brilliant talker,\r\nbut made a failure of his mathematics. In a letter to his mother he wrote:\r\n\"Oh for words to express my abomination of that science.... Discipline of\r\nthe mind! Say rather starvation, confinement, torture, annihilation!\" We\r\nquote this as a commentary on Macaulay's later writings, which are\r\nfrequently lacking in the exactness and the logical sequence of the science\r\nwhich he detested.\r\n\r\nAfter his college course Macaulay studied law, was admitted to the bar,\r\ndevoted himself largely to politics, entered Parliament in 1830, and almost\r\nimmediately won a reputation as the best debater and the most eloquent\r\nspeaker, of the Liberal or Whig party. Gladstone says of him: \"Whenever he\r\narose to speak it was a summons like a trumpet call to fill the benches.\"\r\nAt the time of his election he was poor, and the loss of his father's\r\nproperty threw upon him the support of his brothers and sisters; but he\r\ntook up the burden with cheerful courage, and by his own efforts soon\r\nplaced himself and his family in comfort. His political progress was rapid,\r\nand was due not to favoritism or intrigue, but to his ability, his hard\r\nwork, and his sterling character. He was several times elected to\r\nParliament, was legal adviser to the Supreme Council of India, was a member\r\nof the cabinet, and declined many offices for which other men labor a\r\nlifetime. In 1857 his great ability and services to his country were\r\nrecognized by his being raised to the peerage with the title of Baron\r\nMacaulay of Rothley.\r\n\r\nMacaulay's literary work began in college with the contribution of various\r\nballads and essays to the magazines. In his later life practical affairs\r\nclaimed the greater part of his time, and his brilliant essays were written\r\nin the early morning or late at night. His famous _Essay on Milton_\r\nappeared in the _Edinburgh Review_ in 1825. It created a sensation, and\r\nMacaulay, having gained the ear of the public, never once lost it during\r\nthe twenty years in which he was a contributor to the magazines. His _Lays\r\nof Ancient Rome_ appeared in 1842, and in the following year three volumes\r\nof his collected _Essays_. In 1847 he lost his seat in Parliament,\r\ntemporarily, through his zealous efforts in behalf of religious toleration;\r\nand the loss was most fortunate, since it gave him opportunity to begin his\r\n_History of England_,--a monumental work which he had been planning for\r\nmany years. The first two volumes appeared in 1848, and their success can\r\nbe compared only to that of the most popular novels. The third and fourth\r\nvolumes of the _History_ (1855) were even more successful, and Macaulay was\r\nhard at work on the remaining volumes when he died, quite suddenly, in\r\n1859. He was buried, near Addison, in the Poets' Corner of Westminster\r\nAbbey. A paragraph from one of his letters, written at the height of his\r\nfame and influence, may give us an insight into his life and work:\r\n\r\nI can truly say that I have not, for many years, been so happy as I am at\r\npresent.... I am free. I am independent. I am in Parliament, as honorably\r\nseated as man can be. My family is comfortably off. I have leisure for\r\nliterature, yet I am not reduced to the necessity of writing for money. If\r\nI had to choose a lot from all that there are in human life, I am not sure\r\nthat I should prefer any to that which has fallen to me. I am sincerely and\r\nthoroughly contented.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF MACAULAY. Macaulay is famous in literature for his essays, for his\r\nmartial ballads, and for his _History of England_. His first important\r\nwork, the _Essay on Milton_ (1825), is worthy of study not only for itself,\r\nas a critical estimate of the Puritan poet, but as a key to all Macaulay's\r\nwritings. Here, first of all, is an interesting work, which, however much\r\nwe differ from the author's opinion, holds our attention and generally\r\nmakes us regret that the end comes so soon. The second thing to note is the\r\nhistorical flavor of the essay. We study not only Milton, but also the\r\ntimes in which he lived, and the great movements of which he was a part.\r\nHistory and literature properly belong together, and Macaulay was one of\r\nthe first writers to explain the historical conditions which partly account\r\nfor a writer's work and influence. The third thing to note is Macaulay's\r\nenthusiasm for his subject,--an enthusiasm which is often partisan, but\r\nwhich we gladly share for the moment as we follow the breathless narrative.\r\nMacaulay generally makes a hero of his man, shows him battling against\r\nodds, and the heroic side of our own nature awakens and responds to the\r\nauthor's plea. The fourth, and perhaps most characteristic thing in the\r\nessay is the style, which is remarkably clear, forceful, and convincing.\r\nJeffrey, the editor of the _Edinburgh Review_, wrote enthusiastically when\r\nhe received the manuscript, \"The more I think, the less I can conceive\r\nwhere you picked up that style.\" We still share in the editor's wonder; but\r\nthe more we think, the less we conceive that such a style could be picked\r\nup. It was partly the result of a well-stored mind, partly of unconscious\r\nimitation of other writers, and partly of that natural talent for clear\r\nspeaking and writing which is manifest in all Macaulay's work.\r\n\r\nIn the remaining essays we find the same general qualities which\r\ncharacterize Macaulay's first attempt. They cover a wide range of subjects,\r\nbut they may be divided into two general classes, the literary or critical,\r\nand the historical. Of the literary essays the best are those on Milton,\r\nAddison, Goldsmith, Byron, Dryden, Leigh Hunt, Bunyan, Bacon, and Johnson.\r\nAmong the best known of the historical essays are those on Lord Clive,\r\nChatham, Warren Hastings, Hallam's Constitutional History, Von Ranke's\r\nHistory of the Papacy, Frederick the Great, Horace Walpole, William Pitt,\r\nSir William Temple, Machiavelli, and Mirabeau. Most of these were produced\r\nin the vigor of young manhood, between 1825 and 1845, while the writer was\r\nbusy with practical affairs of state. They are often one-sided and\r\ninaccurate, but always interesting, and from them a large number of busy\r\npeople have derived their first knowledge of history and literature.\r\n\r\nThe best of Macaulay's poetical work is found in the _Lays of Ancient Rome_\r\n(1842), a collection of ballads in the style of Scott, which sing of the\r\nold heroic days of the Rome Roman republic. The ballad does not require\r\nmuch thought or emotion. It demands clearness, vigor, enthusiasm, action;\r\nand it suited Macaulay's genius perfectly. He was, however, much more\r\ncareful than other ballad writers in making his narrative true to\r\ntradition. The stirring martial spirit of these ballads, their fine\r\nworkmanship, and their appeal to courage and patriotism made them instantly\r\npopular. Even to-day, after more than fifty years, such ballads as those on\r\nVirginius and Horatius at the Bridge are favorite pieces in many school\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\nThe _History of England_, Macaulay's masterpiece, is still one of the most\r\npopular historical works in the English language. Originally it was\r\nintended to cover the period from the accession of James II, in 1685, to\r\nthe death of George IV, in 1830. Only five volumes of the work were\r\nfinished, and so thoroughly did Macaulay go into details that these five\r\nvolumes cover only sixteen years. It has been estimated that to complete\r\nthe work on the same scale would require some fifty volumes and the labor\r\nof one man for over a century.\r\n\r\nIn his historical method Macaulay suggests Gibbon. His own knowledge of\r\nhistory was very great, but before writing he read numberless pages,\r\nconsulted original documents, and visited the scenes which he intended to\r\ndescribe. Thackeray's remark, that \"Macaulay reads twenty books to write a\r\nsentence and travels one hundred miles to make a line of description,\" is,\r\nin view of his industry, a well-warranted exaggeration.\r\n\r\nAs in his literary essays, he is fond of making heroes, and he throws\r\nhimself so heartily into the spirit of the scene he is describing that his\r\nword pictures almost startle us by their vivid reality. The story of\r\nMonmouth's rebellion, for instance, or the trial of the seven bishops, is\r\nas fascinating as the best chapters of Scott's historical novels.\r\n\r\nWhile Macaulay's search for original sources of information suggests the\r\nscientific historian, his use of his material is much more like that of a\r\nnovelist or playwright. In his essay on Machiavelli he writes: \"The best\r\nportraits are perhaps those in which there is a slight mixture of\r\ncaricature, and we are not certain that the best histories are not those in\r\nwhich a little of the exaggeration of fictitious narrative is judiciously\r\nemployed. Something is lost in accuracy, but much is gained in\r\neffect.\"[243] Whether this estimate of historical writing be true or false,\r\nMacaulay employed it in his own work and made his narrative as absorbing as\r\na novel. To all his characters he gives the reality of flesh and blood, and\r\nin his own words he \"shows us over their houses and seats us at their\r\ntables.\" All that is excellent, but it has its disadvantages. In his\r\nadmiration for heroism, Macaulay makes some of his characters too good and\r\nothers too bad. In his zeal for details he misses the importance of great\r\nmovements, and of great leaders who are accustomed to ignore details; and\r\nin his joy of describing events he often loses sight of underlying causes.\r\nIn a word, he is without historical insight, and his work, though\r\nfascinating, is seldom placed among the reliable histories of England.\r\n\r\nGENERAL CHARACTERISTICS. To the reader who studies Macaulay's brilliant\r\nessays and a few chosen chapters of his _History_, three things soon become\r\nmanifest. First, Macaulay's art is that of a public speaker rather than\r\nthat of a literary man. He has a wonderful command of language, and he\r\nmakes his meaning clear by striking phrases, vigorous antitheses,\r\nanecdotes, and illustrations. His style is so clear that \"he who runs may\r\nread,\" and from beginning to end he never loses the attention of his\r\nreaders. Second, Macaulay's good spirits and enthusiasm are contagious. As\r\nhe said himself, he wrote \"out of a full head,\" chiefly for his own\r\npleasure or recreation; and one who writes joyously generally awakens a\r\nsense of pleasure in his readers. Third, Macaulay has \"the defect of his\r\nqualities.\" He reads and remembers so much that he has no time to think or\r\nto form settled opinions. As Gladstone said, Macaulay is \"always conversing\r\nor recollecting or reading or composing, but reflecting never.\" So he wrote\r\nhis brilliant _Essay on Milton_, which took all England by storm, and said\r\nof it afterward that it contained \"scarcely a paragraph which his mature\r\njudgment approved.\" Whether he speaks or writes, he has always before him\r\nan eager audience, and he feels within him the born orator's power to hold\r\nand fascinate. So he gives loose rein to his enthusiasm, quotes from a\r\nhundred books, and in his delight at entertaining us forgets that the first\r\nquality of a critical or historical work is to be accurate, and the second\r\nto be interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS CARLYLE (1795-1881)\r\n\r\nIn marked contrast with Macaulay, the brilliant and cheerful essayist, is\r\nThomas Carlyle, the prophet and censor of the nineteenth century. Macaulay\r\nis the practical man of affairs, helping and rejoicing in the progress of\r\nhis beloved England. Carlyle lives apart from all practical interests,\r\nlooks with distrust on the progress of his age, and tells men that truth,\r\njustice, and immortality are the only worthy objects of human endeavor.\r\nMacaulay is delighted with material comforts; he is most at home in\r\nbrilliant and fashionable company; and he writes, even when ill and\r\nsuffering, with unfailing hopefulness and good nature. Carlyle is like a\r\nHebrew prophet just in from the desert, and the burden of his message is,\r\n\"Woe to them that are at ease in Zion!\" Both men are, in different ways,\r\ntypical of the century, and somewhere between the two extremes--the\r\npractical, helpful activity of Macaulay and the spiritual agony and\r\nconflict of Carlyle--we shall find the measure of an age which has left the\r\ndeepest impress upon our own.\r\n\r\nLIFE OF CARLYLE. Carlyle was born at Ecclefechan, Dumfriesshire, in 1795, a\r\nfew months before Burns's death, and before Scott had published his first\r\nwork. Like Burns, he came of peasant stock,--strong, simple, God-fearing\r\nfolk, whose influence in Carlyle's later life is beyond calculation. Of his\r\nmother he says, \"She was too mild and peaceful for the planet she lived\r\nin\"; and of his father, a stone mason, he writes, \"Could I write my books\r\nas he built his houses, walk my way so manfully through this shadow world,\r\nand leave it with so little blame, it were more than all my hopes.\"\r\n\r\nOf Carlyle's early school life we have some interesting glimpses in _Sartor\r\nResartus_. At nine years he entered the Annan grammar school, where he was\r\nbullied by the older boys, who nicknamed him Tom the Tearful. For the\r\nteachers of those days he has only ridicule, calling them \"hide-bound\r\npedants,\" and he calls the school by the suggestive German name of\r\n_Hinterschlag Gymnasium_. At the wish of his parents, who intended Carlyle\r\nfor the ministry, he endured this hateful school life till 1809, when he\r\nentered Edinburgh University. There he spent five miserable years, of which\r\nhis own record is: \"I was without friends, experience, or connection in the\r\nsphere of human business, was of sly humor, proud enough and to spare, and\r\nhad begun my long curriculum of dyspepsia.\" This nagging illness was the\r\ncause of much of that irritability of temper which frequently led him to\r\nscold the public, and for which he has been harshly handled by unfriendly\r\ncritics.\r\n\r\nThe period following his university course was one of storm and stress for\r\nCarlyle. Much to the grief of the father whom he loved, he had given up the\r\nidea of entering the ministry. Wherever he turned, doubts like a thick fog\r\nsurrounded him,--doubts of God, of his fellow-men, of human progress, of\r\nhimself. He was poor, and to earn an honest living was his first problem.\r\nHe tried successively teaching school, tutoring, the study of law, and\r\nwriting miscellaneous articles for the _Edinburgh Encyclopedia_. All the\r\nwhile he was fighting his doubts, living, as he says, \"in a continual,\r\nindefinite, pining fear.\" After six or seven years of mental agony, which\r\nhas at times a suggestion of Bunyan's spiritual struggle, the crisis came\r\nin 1821, when Carlyle suddenly shook off his doubts and found himself. \"All\r\nat once,\" he says in _Sartor_, \"there arose a thought in me, and I asked\r\nmyself: 'What _Art_ thou afraid of? Wherefore like a coward dost thou\r\nforever pip and whimper, and go cowering and trembling? Despicable biped!\r\nWhat is the sum total of the worst that lies before thee? Death? Well,\r\nDeath; and say the pangs of Tophet too, and all that the Devil and Man may,\r\nwill, or can do against thee! Hast thou not a heart; canst thou not suffer\r\nwhatsoever it be; and, as a Child of Freedom, though outcast, trample\r\nTophet itself under thy feet, while it consumes thee? Let it come then; I\r\nwill meet it and defy it!' And as I so thought, there rushed like a stream\r\nof fire over my whole soul; and I shook base Fear away from me forever.\"\r\nThis struggle between fear and faith, and the triumph of the latter, is\r\nrecorded in two remarkable chapters, \"The Everlasting No\" and \"The\r\nEverlasting Yea,\" of _Sartor Resartus_.\r\n\r\nCarlyle now definitely resolved on a literary life, and began with any work\r\nthat offered a bare livelihood. He translated Legendre's _Geometry_ from\r\nthe French, wrote numerous essays for the magazines, and continued his\r\nstudy of German while making translations from that language. His\r\ntranslation of Goethe's _Wilhelm Meister_ Appeared in 1824, his _Life of\r\nSchiller_ in 1825, and his _Specimens of German Romance_ in 1827. He began\r\nat this time a correspondence with Goethe, his literary hero, which lasted\r\ntill the German poet's death in 1832. While still busy with \"hack work,\"\r\nCarlyle, in 1826, married Jane Welsh, a brilliant and beautiful woman,\r\nwhose literary genius almost equaled that of her husband. Soon afterwards,\r\ninfluenced chiefly by poverty, the Carlyles retired to a farm, at Craigen-\r\nputtoch (Hawks' Hill), a dreary and lonely spot, far from friends and even\r\nneighbors. They remained here six years, during which time Carlyle wrote\r\nmany of his best essays, and _Sartor Resartus_, his most original work. The\r\nlatter went begging among publishers for two years, and was finally\r\npublished serially in _Fraser's Magazine_, in 1833-1834. By this time\r\nCarlyle had begun to attract attention as a writer, and, thinking that one\r\nwho made his living by the magazines should be in close touch with the\r\neditors, took his wife's advice and moved to London \"to seek work and\r\nbread.\" He settled in Cheyne Row, Chelsea,--a place made famous by More,\r\nErasmus, Bolingbroke, Smollett, Leigh Hunt, and many lesser lights of\r\nliterature,--and began to enjoy the first real peace he had known since\r\nchildhood. In 1837 appeared _The French Revolution_, which first made\r\nCarlyle famous; and in the same year, led by the necessity of earning\r\nmoney, he began the series of lectures--_German. Literature_ (1837),\r\n_Periods of European Culture_ (1838), _Revolutions of Modern Europe_\r\n(1839), _Heroes and Hero Worship_ (1841)--which created a sensation in\r\nLondon. \"It was,\" says Leigh Hunt, \"as if some Puritan had come to life\r\nagain, liberalized by German philosophy and his own intense reflection and\r\nexperience.\"\r\n\r\nThough Carlyle set himself against the spirit of his age, calling the\r\nfamous Reform Bill a \"progress into darkness,\" and democracy \"the rule of\r\nthe worst rather than the best,\" his rough sincerity was unquestioned, and\r\nhis remarks were more quoted than those of any other living man. He was\r\nsupported, moreover, by a rare circle of friends,--Edward Irving, Southey,\r\nSterling, Landor, Leigh Hunt, Dickens, Mill, Tennyson, Browning, and, most\r\nhelpful of all, Emerson, who had visited Carlyle at Craigenputtoch in 1833.\r\nIt was due largely to Emerson's influence that Carlyle's works were better\r\nappreciated, and brought better financial rewards, in America than in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nCarlyle's fame reached its climax in the monumental _History of Frederick\r\nthe Great_ (1858-1865), published after thirteen years of solitary toil,\r\nwhich, in his own words, \"made entire devastation of home life and\r\nhappiness.\" The proudest moment of his life was when he was elected to\r\nsucceed Gladstone as lord rector of Edinburgh University, in 1865, the year\r\nin which _Frederick the Great_ was finished. In the midst of his triumph,\r\nand while he was in Scotland to deliver his inaugural address, his\r\nhappiness was suddenly destroyed by the death of his wife,--a terrible\r\nblow, from which he never recovered. He lived on for fifteen years, shorn\r\nof his strength and interest in life; and his closing hours were like the\r\ndull sunset of a November day. Only as we remember his grief and remorse at\r\nthe death of the companion who had shared his toil but not his triumph, can\r\nwe understand the sorrow that pervades the pages of his _Reminiscences_. He\r\ndied in 1881, and at his own wish was buried, not in Westminster Abbey, but\r\namong his humble kinsfolk in Ecclefechan. However much we may differ from\r\nhis philosophy or regret the harshness of his minor works, we shall\r\nprobably all agree in this sentiment from one of his own letters,--that the\r\nobject of all his struggle and writing was \"that men should find out and\r\nbelieve the truth, and match their lives to it.\"\r\n\r\nWORKS OF CARLYLE. There are two widely different judgments of Carlyle as a\r\nman and a writer. The first, which is founded largely on his minor\r\nwritings, like _Chartism, Latter-Day Pamphlets_, and _Shooting Niagara_,\r\ndeclares that he is a misanthrope and dyspeptic with a barbarous style of\r\nwriting; that he denounces progress, democracy, science, America, Darwin,\r\n--everybody and everything that he does not understand; that his literary\r\nopinions are largely prejudices; that he began as a prophet and ended as a\r\nscold; and that in denouncing shams of every sort he was something of a\r\nsham himself, since his practice was not in accord with his own preaching.\r\nThe second judgment, which is founded upon _Heroes and Hero Worship,\r\nCromwell_, and _Sartor Resartus_, declares that these works are the supreme\r\nmanifestation of genius; that their rugged, picturesque style makes others\r\nlook feeble or colorless by comparison; and that the author is the greatest\r\nteacher, leader, and prophet of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nSomewhere between these two extremes will be found the truth about Carlyle.\r\nWe only note here that, while there are some grounds for the first\r\nunfavorable criticism, we are to judge an author by his best rather than by\r\nhis worst work; and that a man's aims as well as his accomplishments must\r\nbe taken into consideration. As it is written, \"Whereas it was in thine\r\nheart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine\r\nheart.\" Whatever the defects of Carlyle and his work, in his heart he was\r\nalways planning a house or temple to the God of truth and justice.\r\n\r\nCarlyle's important works may be divided into three general classes,--\r\ncritical and literary essays, historical works, and _Sartor Resartus_, the\r\nlast being in a class by itself, since there is nothing like it in\r\nliterature. To these should be added a biography, the admirable _Life of\r\nJohn Sterling_, and Carlyle's _Letters_ and _Reminiscences_, which are more\r\ninteresting and suggestive than some of his better known works. We omit\r\nhere all consideration of translations, and his intemperate denunciations\r\nof men and institutions in _Chartism, Latter-Day Pamphlets_, and other\r\nessays, which add nothing to the author's fame or influence.\r\n\r\nOf the essays, which are all characterized by Carlyle's zeal to get at the\r\nheart of things, and to reveal the soul rather than the works of a writer,\r\nthe best are those on \"Burns,\" \"Scott,\" \"Novalis,\" \"Goethe,\"\r\n\"Characteristics,\" \"Signs of the Times,\" and \"Boswell's Life of\r\nJohnson.\"[244] In the famous _Essay on Burns_, which is generally selected\r\nfor special study, we note four significant things: (1) Carlyle is\r\npeculiarly well fitted for his task, having many points in common with his\r\nhero. (2) In most of his work Carlyle, by his style and mannerisms and\r\npositive opinions, generally attracts our attention away from his subject;\r\nbut in this essay he shows himself capable of forgetting himself for a\r\nmoment. To an unusual extent he sticks to his subject, and makes us think\r\nof Burns rather than of Carlyle. The style, though unpolished, is fairly\r\nsimple and readable, and is free from the breaks, crudities, ejaculations,\r\nand general \"nodulosities\" which disfigure much of his work. (3) Carlyle\r\nhas an original and interesting theory of biography and criticism. The\r\nobject of criticism is to show the man himself, his aims, ideals, and\r\noutlook on the universe; the object of biography is \"to show what and how\r\nproduced was the effect of society upon him; what and how produced was his\r\neffect on society.\" (4) Carlyle is often severe, even harsh, in his\r\nestimates of other men, but in this case the tragedy of Burns's \"life of\r\nfragments\" attracts and softens him. He grows enthusiastic and--a rare\r\nthing for Carlyle--apologizes for his enthusiasm in the striking sentence,\r\n\"We love Burns, and we pity him; and love and pity are prone to magnify.\"\r\nSo he gives us the most tender and appreciative of his essays, and one of\r\nthe most illuminating criticisms of Burns that has appeared in our\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThe central idea of Carlyle's historical works is found in his _Heroes and\r\nHero Worship_ (1841), his most widely read book. \"Universal history,\" he\r\nsays, \"is at bottom the history of the great men who have worked here.\" To\r\nget at the truth of history we must study not movements but men, and read\r\nnot state papers but the biographies of heroes. His summary of history as\r\npresented in this work has six divisions: (1) The Hero as Divinity, having\r\nfor its general subject Odin, the \"type Norseman,\" who, Carlyle thinks, was\r\nsome old heroic chief, afterwards deified by his countrymen; (2) The Hero\r\nas Prophet, treating of Mahomet and the rise of Islam; (3) The Hero as\r\nPoet, in which Dante and Shakespeare are taken as types; (4) The Hero as\r\nPriest, or religious leader, in which Luther appears as the hero of the\r\nReformation, and Knox as the hero of Puritanism; (5) The Hero as Man of\r\nLetters, in which we have the curious choice of Johnson, Rousseau, and\r\nBurns; (6) The Hero as King, in which Cromwell and Napoleon appear as the\r\nheroes of reform by revolution.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that _Heroes_ is not a book of history; neither is it\r\nscientifically written in the manner of Gibbon. With science in any form\r\nCarlyle had no patience; and he miscalculated the value of that patient\r\nsearch for facts and evidence which science undertakes before building any\r\ntheories, either of kings or cabbages. The book, therefore, abounds in\r\nerrors; but they are the errors of carelessness and are perhaps of small\r\nconsequence. His misconception of history, however, is more serious. With\r\nthe modern idea of history, as the growth of freedom among all classes, he\r\nhas no sympathy. The progress of democracy was to him an evil thing, a\r\n\"turning of the face towards darkness and anarchy.\" At certain periods,\r\naccording to Carlyle, God sends us geniuses, sometimes as priests or poets,\r\nsometimes as soldiers or statesmen; but in whatever guise they appear,\r\nthese are our real rulers. He shows, moreover, that whenever such men\r\nappear, multitudes follow them, and that a man's following is a sure index\r\nof his heroism and kingship.\r\n\r\nWhether we agree with Carlyle or not, we must accept for the moment his\r\npeculiar view of history, else _Heroes_ can never open its treasures to us.\r\nThe book abounds in startling ideas, expressed with originality and power,\r\nand is pervaded throughout by an atmosphere of intense moral earnestness.\r\nThe more we read it, the more we find to admire and to remember.\r\n\r\nCarlyle's _French Revolution_ (1837) is to be taken more seriously as a\r\nhistorical work; but here again his hero worship comes to the front, and\r\nhis book is a series of flashlights thrown upon men in dramatic situations,\r\nrather than a tracing of causes to their consequences. The very titles of\r\nhis chapters--\"Astraea Redux,\" \"Windbags,\" \"Broglie the War God\"--do\r\nviolence to our conception of history, and are more suggestive of Carlyle's\r\nindividualism than of French history. He is here the preacher rather than\r\nthe historian; his text is the eternal justice; and his message is that all\r\nwrongdoing is inevitably followed by vengeance. His method is intensely\r\ndramatic. From a mass of historical details he selects a few picturesque\r\nincidents and striking figures, and his vivid pictures of the storming of\r\nthe Bastille, the rush of the mob to Versailles, the death of Louis XVI,\r\nand the Reign of Terror, seem like the work of an eyewitness describing\r\nsome terrible catastrophe. At times, as it portrays Danton, Robespierre,\r\nand the great characters of the tragedy, Carlyle's work is suggestive of an\r\nhistorical play of Shakespeare; and again, as it describes the rush and\r\nriot of men led by elemental passion, it is more like a great prose epic.\r\nThough not a reliable history in any sense, it is one of the most dramatic\r\nand stirring narratives in our language.\r\n\r\nTwo other historical works deserve at least a passing notice. The _History\r\nof Frederick the Great_ (1858-1865), in six volumes, is a colossal picture\r\nof the life and times of the hero of the Prussian Empire. _Oliver\r\nCromwell's Letters and Speeches_ is, in our personal judgment, Carlyle's\r\nbest historical work. His idea is to present the very soul of the great\r\nPuritan leader. He gives us, as of first importance, Cromwell's own words,\r\nand connects them by a commentary in which other men and events are\r\ndescribed with vigor and vividness. Cromwell was one of Carlyle's greatest\r\nheroes, and in this case he is most careful to present the facts which\r\noccasion his own enthusiasm. The result is, on the whole, the most lifelike\r\npicture of a great historical character that we possess. Other historians\r\nhad heaped calumny upon Cromwell till the English public regarded him with\r\nprejudice and horror; and it is an indication of Carlyle's power that by a\r\nsingle book he revolutionized England's opinion of one of her greatest men.\r\n\r\nCarlyle's _Sartor Resartus_ (1834), his only creative work, is a mixture of\r\nphilosophy and romance, of wisdom and nonsense,--a chaotic jumble of the\r\nauthor's thoughts, feelings, and experiences during the first thirty-five\r\nyears of his life. The title, which means \"The Tailor Patched-up,\" is taken\r\nfrom an old Scotch song. The hero is Diogenes Teufelsdroeckh, a German\r\nprofessor at the University of Weissnichtwo (don't know where); the\r\nnarrative concerns this queer professor's life and opinions; and the\r\ncentral thought of the book is the philosophy of clothes, which are\r\nconsidered symbolically as the outward expression of spirit. Thus, man's\r\nbody is the outward garment of his soul, and the universe is the visible\r\ngarment of the invisible God. The arrangement of _Sartor_ is clumsy and\r\nhard to follow. In order to leave himself free to bring in everything he\r\nthought about, Carlyle assumed the position of one who was translating and\r\nediting the old professor's manuscripts, which are supposed to consist of\r\nnumerous sheets stuffed into twelve paper bags, each labeled with a sign of\r\nthe zodiac. The editor pretends to make order out of this chaos; but he is\r\nfree to jump from one subject to another and to state the most startling\r\nopinion by simply using quotation marks and adding a note that he is not\r\nresponsible for Teufelsdroeckh's crazy notions,--which are in reality\r\nCarlyle's own dreams and ideals. Partly because of the matter, which is\r\nsometimes incoherent, partly because of the style, which, though\r\npicturesque, is sometimes confused and ungrammatical, _Sartor_ is not easy\r\nreading; but it amply repays whatever time and study we give to it. Many of\r\nits passages are more like poetry than prose; and one cannot read such\r\nchapters as \"The Everlasting No,\" \"The Everlasting Yea,\" \"Reminiscences,\"\r\nand \"Natural Supernaturalism,\" and be quite the same man afterwards; for\r\nCarlyle's thought has entered into him, and he walks henceforth more\r\ngently, more reverently through the world, as in the presence of the\r\nEternal.\r\n\r\nGENERAL CHARACTERISTICS. Concerning Carlyle's style there are almost as\r\nmany opinions as there are readers. This is partly because he impresses\r\ndifferent people in widely different ways, and partly because his\r\nexpression varies greatly. At times he is calm, persuasive, grimly\r\nhumorous, as if conversing; at other times, wildly exclamatory, as if he\r\nwere shouting and waving his arms at the reader. We have spoken of\r\nMacaulay's style as that of the finished orator, and we might reasonably\r\nspeak of Carlyle's as that of the exhorter, who cares little for methods so\r\nlong as he makes a strong impression on his hearers. \"Every sentence is\r\nalive to its finger tips,\" writes a modern critic; and though Carlyle often\r\nviolates the rules of grammar and rhetoric, we can well afford to let an\r\noriginal genius express his own intense conviction in his own vivid and\r\npicturesque way.\r\n\r\nCarlyle's message may be summed up in two imperatives,--labor, and be\r\nsincere. He lectured and wrote chiefly for the upper classes who had begun\r\nto think, somewhat sentimentally, of the conditions of the laboring men of\r\nthe world; and he demanded for the latter, not charity or pity, but justice\r\nand honor. All labor, whether of head or hand, is divine; and labor alone\r\njustifies a man as a son of earth and heaven. To society, which Carlyle\r\nthought to be occupied wholly with conventional affairs, he came with the\r\nstamp of sincerity, calling upon men to lay aside hypocrisy and to think\r\nand speak and live the truth. He had none of Addison's delicate satire and\r\nhumor, and in his fury at what he thought was false he was generally\r\nunsympathetic and often harsh; but we must not forget that Thackeray--who\r\nknew society much better than did Carlyle--gave a very unflattering picture\r\nof it in _Vanity Fair_ and _The Book of Snobs_. Apparently the age needed\r\nplain speaking, and Carlyle furnished it in scripture measure. Harriet\r\nMartineau, who knew the world for which Carlyle wrote, summed up his\r\ninfluence when she said that he had \"infused into the mind of the English\r\nnation ... sincerity, earnestness, healthfulness, and courage.\" If we add\r\nto the above message Carlyle's conceptions of the world as governed by a\r\nGod of justice who never forgets, and of human history as \"an inarticulate\r\nBible,\" slowly revealing the divine purpose, we shall understand better the\r\nforce of his ethical appeal and the profound influence he exercised on the\r\nmoral and intellectual life of the past century.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN RUSKIN (1819-1900)\r\n\r\nIn approaching the study of Ruskin we are to remember, first of all, that\r\nwe are dealing with a great and good man, who is himself more inspiring\r\nthan any of his books. In some respects he is like his friend Carlyle,\r\nwhose disciple he acknowledged himself to be; but he is broader in his\r\nsympathies, and in every way more hopeful, helpful, and humane. Thus, in\r\nthe face of the drudgery and poverty of the competitive system, Carlyle\r\nproposed, with the grim satire of Swift's \"Modest Proposal,\" to organize an\r\nannual hunt in which successful people should shoot the unfortunate, and to\r\nuse the game for the support of the army and navy. Ruskin, facing the same\r\nproblem, wrote: \"I will endure it no longer quietly; but henceforward, with\r\nany few or many who will help, do my best to abate this misery.\" Then,\r\nleaving the field of art criticism, where he was the acknowledged leader,\r\nhe begins to write of labor and justice; gives his fortune in charity, in\r\nestablishing schools and libraries; and founds his St. George's Guild of\r\nworkingmen, to put in practice the principles of brotherhood and\r\ncooperation for which he and Carlyle contended. Though his style marks him\r\nas one of the masters of English prose, he is generally studied not as a\r\nliterary man but as an ethical teacher, and we shall hardly appreciate his\r\nworks unless we see behind every book the figure of the heroically sincere\r\nman who wrote it.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Ruskin was born in London, in 1819. His father was a prosperous wine\r\nmerchant who gained a fortune in trade, and who spent his leisure hours in\r\nthe company of good books and pictures. On his tombstone one may still read\r\nthis inscription written by Ruskin: \"He was an entirely honest merchant and\r\nhis memory is to all who keep it dear and helpful. His son, whom he loved\r\nto the uttermost and taught to speak truth, says this of him.\" Ruskin's\r\nmother, a devout and somewhat austere woman, brought her son up with\r\nPuritanical strictness, not forgetting Solomon's injunction that \"the rod\r\nand reproof give wisdom.\"\r\n\r\nOf Ruskin's early years at Herne Hill, on the outskirts of London, it is\r\nbetter to read his own interesting record in _Praeterita_. It was in some\r\nrespects a cramped and lonely childhood, but certain things which strongly\r\nmolded his character are worthy of mention. First, he was taught by word\r\nand example in all things to speak the truth, and he never forgot the\r\nlesson. Second, he had few toys, and spent much time in studying the\r\nleaves, the flowers, the grass, the clouds, even the figures and colors of\r\nthe carpet, and so laid the foundation for that minute and accurate\r\nobservation which is manifest in all his writings. Third, he was educated\r\nfirst by his mother, then by private tutors, and so missed the discipline\r\nof the public schools. The influence of this lonely training is evident in\r\nall his work. Like Carlyle, he is often too positive and dogmatic,--the\r\nresult of failing to test his work by the standards of other men of his\r\nage. Fourth, he was obliged to read the Bible every day and to learn long\r\npassages verbatim. The result of this training was, he says, \"to make every\r\nword of the Scriptures familiar to my ear in habitual music.\" We can hardly\r\nread a page of his later work without finding some reflection of the noble\r\nsimplicity or vivid imagery of the sacred records. Fifth, he traveled much\r\nwith his father and mother, and his innate love of nature was intensified\r\nby what he saw on his leisurely journeys through the most beautiful parts\r\nof England and the Continent.\r\n\r\nRuskin entered Christ Church College, Oxford, in 1836, when only seventeen\r\nyears old. He was at this time a shy, sensitive boy, a lover of nature and\r\nof every art which reflects nature, but almost entirely ignorant of the\r\nways of boys and men. An attack of consumption, with which he had long been\r\nthreatened, caused him to leave Oxford in 1840, and for nearly two years he\r\nwandered over Italy searching for health and cheerfulness, and gathering\r\nmaterials for the first volume of _Modern Painters_, the book that made him\r\nfamous.\r\n\r\nRuskin's literary work began in childhood, when he was encouraged to write\r\nfreely in prose and poetry. A volume of poems illustrated by his own\r\ndrawings was published in 1859, after he had won fame as a prose writer,\r\nbut, save for the drawings, it is of small importance. The first volume of\r\n_Modern Painters_ (1843) was begun as a heated defense of the artist\r\nTurner, but it developed into an essay on art as a true picture of nature,\r\n\"not only in her outward aspect but in her inward spirit.\" The work, which\r\nwas signed simply \"Oxford Graduate,\" aroused a storm of mingled approval\r\nand protest; but however much critics warred over its theories of art, all\r\nwere agreed that the unknown author was a master of descriptive prose.\r\nRuskin now made frequent trips to the art galleries of the Continent, and\r\nproduced four more volumes of _Modern Painters_ during the next seventeen\r\nyears. Meanwhile he wrote other books,--_Seven Lamps of Architecture_\r\n(1849), _Stones of Venice_ (1851-1853), _Pre-Raphaelitism_, and numerous\r\nlectures and essays, which gave him a place in the world of art similar to\r\nthat held by Matthew Arnold in the world of letters. In 1869 he was\r\nappointed professor of art at Oxford, a position which greatly increased\r\nhis prestige and influence, not only among students but among a great\r\nvariety of people who heard his lectures and read his published works.\r\n_Lectures on Art, Aratra Pentelici_ (lectures on sculpture), _Ariadne\r\nFlorentina_ (lectures on engraving), _Michael Angela and Tintoret, The Art\r\nof England, Val d'Arno_ (lectures on Tuscan art), _St. Mark's Rest_ (a\r\nhistory of Venice), _Mornings in Florence_ (studies in Christian art, now\r\nmuch used as a guidebook to the picture galleries of Florence), _The Laws\r\nof Fiesole_ (a treatise on drawing and painting for schools), _Academy of\r\nFine Arts in Venice, Pleasures of England_,--all these works on art show\r\nRuskin's literary industry. And we must also record _Love's Meinie_ (a\r\nstudy of birds), _Proserpina_ (a study of flowers), _Deucalion_ (a study of\r\nwaves and stones), besides various essays on political economy which\r\nindicate that Ruskin, like Arnold, had begun to consider the practical\r\nproblems of his age.\r\n\r\nAt the height of his fame, in 1860, Ruskin turned for a time from art, to\r\nconsider questions of wealth and labor,--terms which were used glibly by\r\nthe economists of the age without much thought for their fundamental\r\nmeaning. \"There is no wealth but life,\" announced Ruskin,--\"life, including\r\nall its powers of love, of joy, and of admiration. That country is the\r\nrichest which nourishes the greatest number of noble and happy human\r\nbeings.\" Such a doctrine, proclaimed by Goldsmith in his _Deserted\r\nVillage_, was regarded as a pretty sentiment, but coming from one of the\r\ngreatest leaders and teachers of England it was like a bombshell. Ruskin\r\nwrote four essays establishing this doctrine and pleading for a more\r\nsocialistic form of government in which reform might be possible. The\r\nessays were published in the _Cornhill Magazine_, of which Thackeray was\r\neditor, and they aroused such a storm that the publication was\r\ndiscontinued. Ruskin then published the essays in book form, with the title\r\n_Unto This Last_, in 1862. _Munera Pulveris_ (1862) was another work in\r\nwhich the principles of capital and labor and the evils of the competitive\r\nsystem were discussed in such a way that the author was denounced as a\r\nvisionary or a madman. Other works of this practical period are _Time and\r\nTide, Fors Clavigera, Sesame and Lilies_, and the _Crown of Wild Olive_.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of Ruskin's life was a time of increasing sadness, due\r\npartly to the failure of his plans, and partly to public attacks upon his\r\nmotives or upon his sanity. He grew bitter at first, as his critics\r\nridiculed or denounced his principles, and at times his voice is as\r\nquerulous as that of Carlyle. We are to remember, however, the conditions\r\nunder which he struggled. His health had been shattered by successive\r\nattacks of disease; he had been disappointed in love; his marriage was\r\nunhappy; and his work seemed a failure. He had given nearly all his fortune\r\nin charity, and the poor were more numerous than ever before. His famous\r\nSt. George's Guild was not successful, and the tyranny of the competitive\r\nsystem seemed too deeply rooted to be overthrown. On the death of his\r\nmother he left London and, in 1879, retired to Brantwood, on Coniston Lake,\r\nin the beautiful region beloved of Wordsworth. Here he passed the last\r\nquiet years of his life under the care of his cousin, Mrs. Severn, the\r\n\"angel of the house,\" and wrote, at Professor Norton's suggestion,\r\n_Praeterita_, one of his most interesting books, in which he describes the\r\nevents of his youth from his own view point. He died quietly in 1900, and\r\nwas buried, as he wished, without funeral pomp or public ceremony, in the\r\nlittle churchyard at Coniston.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF RUSKIN. There are three little books which, in popular favor,\r\nstand first on the list of Ruskin's numerous works,--_Ethics-of-the-Dust_,\r\na series of Lectures to Little Housewives, which appeals most to women;\r\n_Crown of Wild Olive_, three lectures on Work, Traffic, and War, which\r\nappeals to thoughtful men facing the problems of work and duty; and _Sesame\r\nand Lilies_, which appeals to men and women alike. The last is the most\r\nwidely known of Ruskin's works and the best with which to begin our\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nThe first thing we notice in _Sesame and Lilies_ is the symbolical title.\r\n\"Sesame,\" taken from the story of the robbers' cave in the _Arabian\r\nNights_, means a secret word or talisman which unlocks a treasure house. It\r\nwas intended, no doubt, to introduce the first part of the work, called \"Of\r\nKings' Treasuries,\" which treats of books and reading. \"Lilies,\" taken from\r\nIsaiah as a symbol of beauty, purity, and peace, introduces the second\r\nlecture, \"Of Queens' Gardens,\" which is an exquisite study of woman's life\r\nand education. These two lectures properly constitute the book, but a third\r\nis added, on \"The Mystery of Life.\" The last begins in a monologue upon his\r\nown failures in life, and is pervaded by an atmosphere of sadness,\r\nsometimes of pessimism, quite different from the spirit of the other two\r\nlectures.\r\n\r\nThough the theme of the first lecture is books, Ruskin manages to present\r\nto his audience his whole philosophy of life. He gives us, with a wealth of\r\ndetail, a description of what constitutes a real book; he looks into the\r\nmeaning of words, and teaches us how to read, using a selection from\r\nMilton's _Lycidas_ as an illustration. This study of words gives us the key\r\nwith which we are to unlock \"Kings' Treasuries,\" that is, the books which\r\ncontain the precious thoughts of the kingly minds of all ages. He shows the\r\nreal meaning and end of education, the value of labor and of a purpose in\r\nlife; he treats of nature, science, art, literature, religion; he defines\r\nthe purpose of government, showing that soul-life, not money or trade, is\r\nthe measure of national greatness; and he criticises the general injustice\r\nof his age, quoting a heartrending story of toil and suffering from the\r\nnewspapers to show how close his theory is to daily needs. Here is an\r\nastonishing variety in a small compass; but there is no confusion. Ruskin's\r\nmind was wonderfully analytical, and one subject develops naturally from\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nIn the second lecture, \"Of Queens' Gardens,\" he considers the question of\r\nwoman's place and education, which Tennyson had attempted to answer in _The\r\nPrincess_. Ruskin's theory is that the purpose of all education is to\r\nacquire power to bless and to redeem human society; and that in this noble\r\nwork woman must always play the leading part. He searches all literature\r\nfor illustrations, and his description of literary heroines, especially of\r\nShakespeare's perfect women, is unrivaled. Ruskin is always at his best in\r\nwriting of women or for women, and the lofty idealism of this essay,\r\ntogether with its rare beauty of expression, makes it, on the whole, the\r\nmost delightful and inspiring of his works.\r\n\r\nAmong Ruskin's practical works the reader will find in _Fors Clavigera_, a\r\nseries of letters to workingmen, and _Unto This Last_, four essays on the\r\nprinciples of political economy, the substance of his economic teachings.\r\nIn the latter work, starting with the proposition that our present\r\ncompetitive system centers about the idea of wealth, Ruskin tries to find\r\nout what wealth is; and the pith of his teaching is this,--that men are of\r\nmore account than money; that a man's real wealth is found in his soul; not\r\nin his pocket; and that the prime object of life and labor is \"the\r\nproducing of as many as possible full-breathed, bright-eyed, and happy-\r\nhearted human creatures.\" To make this ideal practical, Ruskin makes four\r\nsuggestions: (1) that training schools be established to teach young men\r\nand women three things,--the laws and practice of health, habits of\r\ngentleness and justice, and the trade or calling by which they are to live;\r\n(2) that the government establish farms and workshops for the production of\r\nall the necessaries of life, where only good and honest work shall be\r\ntolerated and where a standard of work and wages shall be maintained; (3)\r\nthat any person out of employment shall be received at the nearest\r\ngovernment school: if ignorant he shall be educated, and if competent to do\r\nany work he shall have the opportunity to do it; (4) that comfortable homes\r\nbe provided for the sick and for the aged, and that this be done in\r\njustice, not in charity. A laborer serves his country as truly as does a\r\nsoldier or a statesman, and a pension should be no more disgraceful in one\r\ncase than in the other.\r\n\r\nAmong Ruskin's numerous books treating of art, we recommend the _Seven\r\nLamps of Architecture_ (1849), _Stones of Venice_ (1851-1853), and the\r\nfirst two volumes of _Modern Painters_ (1843-1846). With Ruskin's art\r\ntheories, which, as Sydney Smith prophesied, \"worked a complete revolution\r\nin the world of taste,\" we need not concern ourselves here. We simply point\r\nout four principles that are manifest in all his work: (1) that the object\r\nof art, as of every other human endeavor, is to find and to express the\r\ntruth; (2) that art, in order to be true, must break away from\r\nconventionalities and copy nature; (3) that morality is closely allied with\r\nart, and that a careful study of any art reveals the moral strength or\r\nweakness of the people that produced it; (4) that the main purpose of art\r\nis not to delight a few cultured people but to serve the daily uses of\r\ncommon life. \"The giving brightness to pictures is much,\" he says, \"but the\r\ngiving brightness to life is more.\" In this attempt to make art serve the\r\npractical ends of life, Ruskin is allied with all the great writers of the\r\nperiod, who use literature as the instrument of human progress.\r\n\r\nGENERAL CHARACTERISTICS. One who reads Ruskin is in a state of mind\r\nanalogous to that of a man who goes through a picture gallery, pausing now\r\nto admire a face or a landscape for its own sake, and again to marvel at\r\nthe technical skill of the artist, without regard to his subject. For\r\nRuskin is a great literary artist and a great ethical teacher, and we\r\nadmire one page for its style, and the next for its message to humanity.\r\nThe best of his prose, which one may find in the descriptive passages of\r\n_Præterita_ and _Modern Painters_, is written in a richly ornate style,\r\nwith a wealth of figures and allusions, and at times a rhythmic, melodious\r\nquality which makes it almost equal to poetry. Ruskin had a rare\r\nsensitiveness to beauty in every form, and more, perhaps, than any other\r\nwriter in our language, he has helped us to see and appreciate the beauty\r\nof the world around us.\r\n\r\nAs for Ruskin's ethical teaching, it appears in so many forms and in so\r\nmany different works that any summary must appear inadequate. For a full\r\nhalf century he was \"the apostle of beauty\" in England, and the beauty for\r\nwhich he pleaded was never sensuous or pagan, as in the Renaissance, but\r\nalways spiritual, appealing to the soul of man rather than to his eyes,\r\nleading to better work and better living. In his economic essays Ruskin is\r\neven more directly and positively ethical. To mitigate the evils of the\r\nunreasonable competitive system under which we labor and sorrow; to bring\r\nmaster and man together in mutual trust and helpfulness; to seek beauty,\r\ntruth, goodness as the chief ends of life, and, having found them, to make\r\nour characters correspond; to share the best treasures of art and\r\nliterature with rich and poor alike; to labor always, and, whether we work\r\nwith hand or head, to do our work in praise of something that we love,--\r\nthis sums up Ruskin's purpose and message. And the best of it is that, like\r\nChaucer's country parson, he practiced his doctrine before he preached it.\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTHEW ARNOLD (1822-1888)\r\n\r\nIn the world of literature Arnold has occupied for many years an\r\nauthoritative position as critic and teacher, similar to that held by\r\nRuskin in the world of art. In his literary work two very different moods\r\nare manifest. In his poetry he reflects the doubt of an age which witnessed\r\nthe conflict between science and revealed religion. Apparently he never\r\npassed through any such decisive personal struggle as is recorded in\r\n_Sartor Resartus_, and he has no positive conviction such as is voiced in\r\n\"The Everlasting Yea.\" He is beset by doubts which he never settles, and\r\nhis poems generally express sorrow or regret or resignation. In his prose\r\nhe shows the cavalier spirit,--aggressive, light-hearted, self-confident.\r\nLike Carlyle, he dislikes shams, and protests against what he calls the\r\nbarbarisms of society; but he writes with a light touch, using satire and\r\nbanter as the better part of his argument. Carlyle denounces with the zeal\r\nof a Hebrew prophet, and lets you know that you are hopelessly lost if you\r\nreject his message. Arnold is more like the cultivated Greek; his voice is\r\nsoft, his speech suave, but he leaves the impression, if you happen to\r\ndiffer with him, that you must be deficient in culture. Both these men, so\r\ndifferent in spirit and methods, confronted the same problems, sought the\r\nsame ends, and were dominated by the same moral sincerity.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Arnold was born in Laleham, in the valley of the Thames, in 1822. His\r\nfather was Dr. Thomas Arnold, head master of Rugby, with whom many of us\r\nhave grown familiar by reading _Tom Brown's School Days_. After fitting for\r\nthe university at Winchester and at Rugby, Arnold entered Balliol College,\r\nOxford, where he was distinguished by winning prizes in poetry and by\r\ngeneral excellence in the classics. More than any other poet Arnold\r\nreflects the spirit of his university. \"The Scholar-Gipsy\" and \"Thyrsis\"\r\ncontain many references to Oxford and the surrounding country, but they are\r\nmore noticeable for their spirit of aloofness,--as if Oxford men were too\r\nmuch occupied with classic dreams and ideals to concern themselves with the\r\npractical affairs of life.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the university Arnold first taught the classics at Rugby;\r\nthen, in 1847, he became private secretary to Lord Lansdowne, who appointed\r\nthe young poet to the position of inspector of schools under the\r\ngovernment. In this position Arnold worked patiently for the next thirty-\r\nfive years, traveling about the country, examining teachers, and correcting\r\nendless examination papers. For ten years (1857-1867) he was professor of\r\npoetry at Oxford, where his famous lectures _On Translating Homer_ were\r\ngiven. He made numerous reports on English and foreign schools, and was\r\nthree times sent abroad to study educational methods on the Continent. From\r\nthis it will be seen that Arnold led a busy, often a laborious life, and we\r\ncan appreciate his statement that all his best literary work was done late\r\nat night, after a day of drudgery. It is well to remember that, while\r\nCarlyle was preaching about labor, Arnold labored daily; that his work was\r\ncheerfully and patiently done; and that after the day's work he hurried\r\naway, like Lamb, to the Elysian fields of literature. He was happily\r\nmarried, loved his home, and especially loved children, was free from all\r\nbitterness and envy, and, notwithstanding his cold manner, was at heart\r\nsincere, generous, and true. We shall appreciate his work better if we can\r\nsee the man himself behind all that he has written.\r\n\r\nArnold's literary work divides itself into three periods, which we may call\r\nthe poetical, the critical, and the practical. He had written poetry since\r\nhis school days, and his first volume, _The Strayed Reveller and Other\r\nPoems_, appeared anonymously in 1849. Three years later he published\r\n_Empedocles on Etna and other Poems;_ but only a few copies of these\r\nvolumes were sold, and presently both were withdrawn from circulation. In\r\n1853-1855 he published his signed _Poems_, and twelve years later appeared\r\nhis last volume of poetry. Compared with the early work of Tennyson, these\r\nworks met with little favor, and Arnold practically abandoned poetry in\r\nfavor of critical writing.\r\n\r\nThe chief works of his critical period are the lectures _On Translating\r\nHomer_ (1861) and the two volumes of _Essays in Criticism_ (1865-1888),\r\nwhich made Arnold one of the best known literary men in England. Then, like\r\nRuskin, he turned to practical questions, and his _Friendship's Garland_\r\n(1871) was intended to satirize and perhaps reform the great middle class\r\nof England, whom he called the Philistines. _Culture and Anarchy_, the most\r\ncharacteristic work of his practical period, appeared in 1869. These were\r\nfollowed by four books on religious subjects,--_St. Paul and Protestantism_\r\n(1870), _Literature and Dogma_ (1873), _God and the Bible_ (1875), and\r\n_Last Essays on Church and Religion_ (1877). The _Discourses in America_\r\n(1885) completes the list of his important works. At the height of his fame\r\nand influence he died suddenly, in 1888, and was buried in the churchyard\r\nat Laleham. The spirit of his whole life is well expressed in a few lines\r\nof one of his own early sonnets:\r\n\r\n    One lesson, Nature, let me learn of thee,\r\n    One lesson which in every wind is blown,\r\n    One lesson of two duties kept at one\r\n    Though the loud world proclaim their enmity--\r\n    Of toil unsever'd from tranquillity;\r\n    Of labour, that in lasting fruit outgrows\r\n    Far noisier schemes, accomplish'd in repose,\r\n    Too great for haste, too high for rivalry.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF MATTHEW ARNOLD. We shall better appreciate Arnold's poetry if we\r\nremember two things: First, he had been taught in his home a simple and\r\ndevout faith in revealed religion, and in college he was thrown into a\r\nworld of doubt and questioning. He faced these doubts honestly,\r\nreverently,--in his heart longing to accept the faith of his fathers, but\r\nin his head demanding proof and scientific exactness. The same struggle\r\nbetween head and heart, between reason and intuition, goes on to-day, and\r\nthat is one reason why Arnold's poetry, which wavers on the borderland\r\nbetween doubt and faith, is a favorite with many readers. Second, Arnold,\r\nas shown in his essay on _The Study of Poetry_, regarded poetry as \"a\r\ncriticism of life under the conditions fixed for such criticism by the laws\r\nof poetic truth and poetic beauty.\" Naturally, one who regards poetry as a\r\n\"criticism\" will write very differently from one who regards poetry as the\r\nnatural language of the soul. He will write for the head rather than for\r\nthe heart, and will be cold and critical rather than enthusiastic.\r\nAccording to Arnold, each poem should be a unit, and he protested against\r\nthe tendency of English poets to use brilliant phrases and figures of\r\nspeech which only detract attention from the poem as a whole. For his\r\nmodels he went to Greek poetry, which he regarded as \"the only sure\r\nguidance to what is sound and true in poetical art.\" Arnold is, however,\r\nmore indebted than he thinks to English masters, especially to Wordsworth\r\nand Milton, whose influence is noticeable in a large part of his poetry.\r\n\r\nOf Arnold's narrative poems the two best known are _Balder Dead_ (1855), an\r\nincursion into the field of Norse mythology which is suggestive of Gray,\r\nand _Sohrab and Rustum_ (1853), which takes us into the field of legendary\r\nPersian history. The theme of the latter poem is taken from the _Shah-\r\nNamah_ (Book of Kings) of the Persian poet Firdausi, who lived and wrote in\r\nthe eleventh century.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the story is of one Rustem or Rustum, a Persian Achilles, who fell\r\nasleep one day when he had grown weary of hunting. While he slept a band of\r\nrobbers stole his favorite horse, Ruksh. In trailing the robbers Rustum\r\ncame to the palace of the king of Samengan, where he was royally welcomed,\r\nand where he fell in love with the king's daughter, Temineh, and married\r\nher. But he was of a roving, adventurous disposition, and soon went back to\r\nfight among his own people, the Persians. While he was gone his son Sohrab\r\nwas born, grew to manhood, and became the hero of the Turan army. War arose\r\nbetween the two peoples, and two hostile armies were encamped by the Oxus.\r\nEach army chose a champion, and Rustum and Sohrab found themselves matched\r\nin mortal combat between the lines. At this point Sohrab, whose chief\r\ninterest in life was to find his father, demanded to know if his enemy were\r\nnot Rustum; but the latter was disguised and denied his identity. On the\r\nfirst day of the fight Rustum was overcome, but his life was spared by a\r\ntrick and by the generosity of Sohrab. On the second day Rustum prevailed,\r\nand mortally wounded his antagonist. Then he recognized his own son by a\r\ngold bracelet which he had long ago given to his wife Temineh. The two\r\narmies, rushing into battle, were stopped by the sight of father and son\r\nweeping in each other's arms. Sohrab died, the war ceased, and Rustum went\r\nhome to a life of sorrow and remorse.\r\n\r\nUsing this interesting material, Arnold produced a poem which has the rare\r\nand difficult combination of classic reserve and romantic feeling. It is\r\nwritten in blank verse, and one has only to read the first few lines to see\r\nthat the poet is not a master of his instrument. The lines are seldom\r\nharmonious, and we must frequently change the accent of common words, or\r\nlay stress on unimportant particles, to show the rhythm. Arnold frequently\r\ncopies Milton, especially in his repetition of ideas and phrases; but the\r\npoem as a whole is lacking in Milton's wonderful melody.\r\n\r\nThe classic influence on _Sohrab and Rustum_ is especially noticeable in\r\nArnold's use of materials. Fights are short; grief is long; therefore the\r\npoet gives few lines to the combat, but lingers over the son's joy at\r\nfinding his father, and the father's quenchless sorrow at the death of his\r\nson. The last lines especially, with their \"passionate grief set to solemn\r\nmusic,\" make this poem one of the best, on the whole, that Arnold has\r\nwritten. And the exquisite ending, where the Oxus, unmindful of the trivial\r\nstrifes of men, flows on sedately to join \"his luminous home of waters\" is\r\nmost suggestive of the poet's conception of the orderly life of nature, in\r\ncontrast with the doubt and restlessness of human life.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to the narrative poems are the elegies, \"Thyrsis,\" \"The\r\nScholar-Gipsy,\" \"Memorial Verses,\" \"A Southern Night,\" \"Obermann,\" \"Stanzas\r\nfrom the Grande Chartreuse,\" and \"Rugby Chapel.\" All these are worthy of\r\ncareful reading, but the best is \"Thyrsis,\" a lament for the poet Clough,\r\nwhich is sometimes classed with Milton's _Lycidas_ and Shelley's _Adonais_.\r\nAmong the minor poems the reader will find the best expression of Arnold's\r\nideals and methods in \"Dover Beach,\" the love lyrics entitled\r\n\"Switzerland,\" \"Requiescat,\" \"Shakespeare,\" \"The Future,\" \"Kensington\r\nGardens,\" \"Philomela,\" \"Human Life,\" \"Callicles's Song,\" \"Morality,\" and\r\n\"Geist's Grave.\"--the last being an exquisite tribute to a little dog\r\nwhich, like all his kind, had repaid our scant crumbs of affection with a\r\nwhole life's devotion.\r\n\r\nThe first place among Arnold's prose works must be given to the _Essays in\r\nCriticism_, which raised the author to the front rank of living critics.\r\nHis fundamental idea of criticism appeals to us strongly. The business of\r\ncriticism, he says, is neither to find fault nor to display the critic's\r\nown learning or influence; it is to know \"the best which has been thought\r\nand said in the world,\" and by using this knowledge to create a current of\r\nfresh and free thought. If a choice must be made among these essays, which\r\nare all worthy of study, we would suggest \"The Study of Poetry,\"\r\n\"Wordsworth,\" \"Byron,\" and \"Emerson.\" The last-named essay, which is found\r\nin the _Discourses in America_, is hardly a satisfactory estimate of\r\nEmerson, but its singular charm of manner and its atmosphere of\r\nintellectual culture make it perhaps the most characteristic of Arnold's\r\nprose writings.\r\n\r\nAmong the works of Arnold's practical period there are two which may be\r\ntaken as typical of all the rest. _Literature and Dogma_ (1873) is, in\r\ngeneral, a plea for liberality in religion. Arnold would have us read the\r\nBible, for instance, as we would read any other great work, and apply to it\r\nthe ordinary standards of literary criticism.\r\n\r\n_Culture and Anarchy_ (1869) contains most of the terms--culture, sweetness\r\nand light, Barbarian, Philistine, Hebraism, and many others--which are now\r\nassociated with Arnold's work and influence. The term \"Barbarian\" refers to\r\nthe aristocratic classes, whom Arnold thought to be essentially crude in\r\nsoul, notwithstanding their good clothes and superficial graces.\r\n\"Philistine\" refers to the middle classes,--narrow-minded and\r\nself-satisfied people, according to Arnold, whom he satirizes with the idea\r\nof opening their minds to new ideas. \"Hebraism\" is Arnold's term for moral\r\neducation. Carlyle had emphasized the Hebraic or moral element in life, and\r\nArnold undertook to preach the Hellenic or intellectual element, which\r\nwelcomes new ideas, and delights in the arts that reflect the beauty of the\r\nworld. \"The uppermost idea with. Hellenism,\" he says, \"is to see things as\r\nthey are; the uppermost idea with Hebraism is conduct and obedience.\" With\r\ngreat clearness, sometimes with great force, and always with a play of\r\nhumor and raillery aimed at the \"Philistines,\" Arnold pleads for both these\r\nelements in life which together aim at \"Culture,\" that is, at moral and\r\nintellectual perfection.\r\n\r\nGENERAL CHARACTERISTICS. Arnold's influence in our literature may be summed\r\nup, in a word, as intellectual rather than inspirational. One cannot be\r\nenthusiastic over his poetry, for the simple reason that he himself lacked\r\nenthusiasm. He is, however, a true reflection of a very real mood of the\r\npast century, the mood of doubt and sorrow; and a future generation may\r\ngive him a higher place than he now holds as a poet. Though marked by \"the\r\nelemental note of sadness,\" all Arnold's poems are distinguished by\r\nclearness, simplicity, and the restrained emotion of his classic models.\r\n\r\nAs a prose writer the cold intellectual quality, which mars his poetry by\r\nrestraining romantic feeling, is of first importance, since it leads him to\r\napproach literature with an open mind and with the single desire to find\r\n\"the best which has been thought and said in the world.\" We cannot yet\r\nspeak with confidence of his rank in literature; but by his crystal-clear\r\nstyle, his scientific spirit of inquiry and comparison, illumined here and\r\nthere by the play of humor, and especially by his broad sympathy and\r\nintellectual culture, he seems destined to occupy a very high place among\r\nthe masters of literary criticism.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN HENRY NEWMAN (1801-1890)\r\n\r\nAny record of the prose literature of the Victorian era, which includes the\r\nhistorical essays of Macaulay and the art criticism of Ruskin, should\r\ncontain also some notice of its spiritual leaders. For there was never a\r\ntime when the religious ideals that inspire the race were kept more\r\nconstantly before men's minds through the medium of literature.\r\n\r\nAmong the religious writers of the age the first place belongs\r\nunquestionably to Cardinal Newman. Whether we consider him as a man, with\r\nhis powerful yet gracious personality, or as a religious reformer, who did\r\nmuch to break down old religious prejudices by showing the underlying\r\nbeauty and consistency of the Roman church, or as a prose writer whose\r\nstyle is as near perfection as we have ever reached, Newman is one of the\r\nmost interesting figures of the whole nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nLIFE. Three things stand out clearly in Newman's life: first, his unshaken\r\nfaith in the divine companionship and guidance; second, his desire to find\r\nand to teach the truth of revealed religion; third, his quest of an\r\nauthoritative standard of faith, which should remain steadfast through the\r\nchanging centuries and amid all sorts and conditions of men. The first led\r\nto that rare and beautiful spiritual quality which shines in all his work;\r\nthe second to his frequent doctrinal and controversial essays; the third to\r\nhis conversion to the Catholic church, which he served as priest and\r\nteacher for the last forty-five years of his life. Perhaps we should add\r\none more characteristic,--the practical bent of his religion; for he was\r\nnever so busy with study or controversy that he neglected to give a large\r\npart of his time to gentle ministration among the poor and needy.\r\n\r\nHe was born in London, in 1801. His father was an English banker; his\r\nmother, a member of a French Huguenot family, was a thoughtful, devout\r\nwoman, who brought up her son in a way which suggests the mother of Ruskin.\r\nOf his early training, his reading of doctrinal and argumentative works,\r\nand of his isolation from material things in the thought that there were\r\n\"two and only two absolute and luminously self-evident beings in the\r\nworld,\" himself and his Creator, it is better to read his own record in the\r\n_Apologia_, which is a kind of spiritual biography.\r\n\r\nAt the age of fifteen Newman had begun his profound study of theological\r\nsubjects. For science, literature, art, nature,--all the broad interests\r\nwhich attracted other literary men of his age,--he cared little, his mind\r\nbeing wholly occupied with the history and doctrines of the Christian\r\nchurch, to which he had already devoted his life. He was educated first at\r\nthe school in Ealing, then at Oxford, taking his degree in the latter place\r\nin 1820. Though his college career was not more brilliant than that of many\r\nunknown men, his unusual ability was recognized and he was made a fellow of\r\nOriel College, retaining the fellowship, and leading a scholarly life for\r\nover twenty years. In 1824 he was ordained in the Anglican church, and four\r\nyears later was chosen vicar of St. Mary's, at Oxford, where his sermons\r\nmade a deep impression on the cultivated audiences that gathered from far\r\nand near to hear him.\r\n\r\nA change is noticeable in Newman's life after his trip to the Mediterranean\r\nin 1832. He had begun his life as a Calvinist, but while in Oxford, then\r\nthe center of religious unrest, he described himself as \"drifting in the\r\ndirection of Liberalism.\" Then study and bereavement and an innate\r\nmysticism led him to a profound sympathy with the mediæval Church. He had\r\nfrom the beginning opposed Catholicism; but during his visit to Italy,\r\nwhere he saw the Roman church at the center of Its power and splendor, many\r\nof his prejudices were overcome. In this enlargement of his spiritual\r\nhorizon Newman was greatly influenced by his friend Hurrell Froude, with\r\nwhom he made the first part of the journey. His poems of this period\r\n(afterwards collected in the _Lyra Apostolica_), among which is the famous\r\n\"Lead, Kindly Light,\" are noticeable for their radiant spirituality; but\r\none who reads them carefully sees the beginning of that mental struggle\r\nwhich ended in his leaving the church in which he was born. Thus he writes\r\nof the Catholic church, whose services he had attended as \"one who in a\r\nforeign land receives the gifts of a good Samaritan\":\r\n\r\n    O that thy creed were sound!\r\n      For thou dost soothe the heart, thou church of Rome,\r\n    By thy unwearied watch and varied round\r\n      Of service, in thy Saviour's holy home.\r\n    I cannot walk the city's sultry streets,\r\n    But the wide porch invites to still retreats,\r\n      Where passion's thirst is calmed, and care's unthankful gloom.\r\n\r\nOn his return to England, in 1833, he entered into the religious struggle\r\nknown as the Oxford or Tractarian Movement,[245] and speedily became its\r\nacknowledged leader. Those who wish to follow this attempt at religious\r\nreform, which profoundly affected the life of the whole English church,\r\nwill find it recorded in the _Tracts for the Times_, twenty-nine of which\r\nwere written by Newman, and in his _Parochial and Plain Sermons_ (1837-\r\n1843). After nine years of spiritual conflict Newman retired to Littlemore,\r\nwhere, with a few followers, he led a life of almost monastic seclusion,\r\nstill striving to reconcile his changing belief with the doctrines of his\r\nown church. Two years later he resigned his charge at St. Mary's and left\r\nthe Anglican communion,--not bitterly, but with a deep and tender regret.\r\nHis last sermon at Littlemore on \"The Parting of Friends\" still moves us\r\nprofoundly, like the cry of a prophet torn by personal anguish in the face\r\nof duty. In 1845 he was received into the Catholic church, and the\r\nfollowing year, at Rome, he joined the community of St. Philip Neri, \"the\r\nsaint of gentleness and kindness,\" as Newman describes him, and was\r\nordained to the Roman priesthood.\r\n\r\nBy his preaching and writing Newman had exercised a strong influence over\r\nhis cultivated English hearers, and the effect of his conversion was\r\ntremendous. Into the theological controversy of the next twenty years we\r\nhave no mind to enter. Through it all Newman retained his serenity, and,\r\nthough a master of irony and satire, kept his literary power always\r\nsubordinate to his chief aim, which was to establish the truth as he saw\r\nit. Whether or not we agree with his conclusions, we must all admire the\r\nspirit of the man, which is above praise or criticism. His most widely read\r\nwork, _Apologia Pro Vita Sua_ (1864), was written in answer to an\r\nunfortunate attack by Charles Kingsley, which would long since have been\r\nforgotten had it not led to this remarkable book. In 1854 Newman was\r\nappointed rector of the Catholic University in Dublin, but after four years\r\nreturned to England and founded a Catholic school at Edgbaston. In 1879 he\r\nwas made cardinal by Pope Leo XIII. The grace and dignity of his life,\r\nquite as much as the sincerity of his _Apologia_, had long since disarmed\r\ncriticism, and at his death, in 1890, the thought of all England might well\r\nbe expressed by his own lines in \"The Dream of Gerontius\":\r\n\r\n    I had a dream. Yes, some one softly said,\r\n      \"He's gone,\" and then a sigh went round the room;\r\n    And then I surely heard a priestly voice\r\n        Cry _Subvenite_; and they knelt in prayer.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF NEWMAN. Readers approach Newman from so many different motives,\r\nsome for doctrine, some for argument, some for a pure prose style, that it\r\nis difficult to recommend the best works for the beginner's use. As an\r\nexpression of Newman's spiritual struggle the _Apologia Pro Vita Sua_ is\r\nperhaps the most significant. This book is not light reading and one who\r\nopens it should understand clearly the reasons for which it was written.\r\nNewman had been accused of insincerity, not only by Kingsley but by many\r\nother men, in the public press. His retirement to solitude and meditation\r\nat Littlemore had been outrageously misunderstood, and it was openly\r\ncharged that his conversion was a cunningly devised plot to win a large\r\nnumber of his followers to the Catholic church. This charge involved\r\nothers, and it was to defend them, as well as to vindicate himself, that\r\nNewman wrote the _Apologia_. The perfect sincerity with which he traced his\r\nreligious history, showing that his conversion was only the final step in a\r\ncourse he had been following since boyhood, silenced his critics and\r\nrevolutionized public opinion concerning himself and the church which he\r\nhad joined. As the revelation of a soul's history, and as a model of pure,\r\nsimple, unaffected English, this book, entirely apart from its doctrinal\r\nteaching, deserves a high place in our prose literature.\r\n\r\nIn Newman's doctrinal works, the _Via Media_, the _Grammar of Assent_, and\r\nin numerous controversial essays the student of literature will have little\r\ninterest. Much more significant are his sermons, the unconscious reflection\r\nof a rare spiritual nature, of which Professor Shairp said: \"His power\r\nshows itself clearly in the new and unlooked-for way in which he touched\r\ninto life old truths, moral or spiritual.... And as he spoke, how the old\r\ntruth became new! and how it came home with a meaning never felt before! He\r\nlaid his finger how gently yet how powerfully on some inner place in the\r\nhearer's heart, and told him things about himself he had never known till\r\nthen. Subtlest truths, which would have taken philosophers pages of\r\ncircumlocution and big words to state, were dropped out by the way in a\r\nsentence or two of the most transparent Saxon.\" Of greater interest to the\r\ngeneral reader are _The Idea of a University_, discourses delivered at\r\nDublin, and his two works of fiction, _Loss and Gain_, treating of a man's\r\nconversion to Catholicism, and _Callista_, which is, in his own words, \"an\r\nattempt to express the feelings and mutual relations of Christians and\r\nheathens in the middle of the third century.\" The latter is, in our\r\njudgment, the most readable and interesting of Newman's works. The\r\ncharacter of Callista, a beautiful Greek sculptor of idols, is powerfully\r\ndelineated; the style is clear and transparent as air, and the story of the\r\nheroine's conversion and death makes one of the most fascinating chapters\r\nin fiction, though it is not the story so much as the author's unconscious\r\nrevelation of himself that charms us. It would be well to read this novel\r\nin connection with Kingsley's _Hypatia_, which attempts to reconstruct the\r\nlife and ideals of the same period.\r\n\r\nNewman's poems are not so well known as his prose, but the reader who\r\nexamines the _Lyra Apostolica_ and _Verses on Various Occasions_ will find\r\nmany short poems that stir a religious nature profoundly by their pure and\r\nlofty imagination; and future generations may pronounce one of these poems,\r\n\"The Dream of Gerontius,\" to be Newman's most enduring work. This poem aims\r\nto reproduce the thoughts and feelings of a man whose soul is just quitting\r\nthe body, and who is just beginning a new and greater life. Both in style\r\nand in thought \"The Dream\" is a powerful and original poem and is worthy of\r\nattention not only for itself but, as a modern critic suggests, \"as a\r\nrevelation of that high spiritual purpose which animated Newman's life from\r\nbeginning to end.\"\r\n\r\nOf Newman's style it is as difficult to write as it would be to describe\r\nthe dress of a gentleman we had met, who was so perfectly dressed that we\r\npaid no attention to his clothes. His style is called transparent, because\r\nat first we are not conscious of his manner; and unobtrusive, because we\r\nnever think of Newman himself, but only of the subject he is discussing. He\r\nis like the best French prose writers in expressing his thought with such\r\nnaturalness and apparent ease that, without thinking of style, we receive\r\nexactly the impression which he means to convey. In his sermons and essays\r\nhe is wonderfully simple and direct; in his controversial writings, gently\r\nironical and satiric, and the satire is pervaded by a delicate humor; but\r\nwhen his feelings are aroused he speaks with poetic images and symbols, and\r\nhis eloquence is like that of the Old Testament prophets. Like Ruskin's,\r\nhis style is modeled largely on that of the Bible, but not even Ruskin\r\nequals him in the poetic beauty and melody of his sentences. On the whole\r\nhe comes nearer than any other of his age to our ideal of a perfect prose\r\nwriter.\r\n\r\nOTHER ESSAYISTS OF THE VICTORIAN AGE. We have selected the above five\r\nessayists, Macaulay, Carlyle, Arnold, Newman, and Ruskin, as representative\r\nwriters of the Victorian Age; but there are many others who well repay our\r\nstudy. Notable among these are John Addington Symonds, author of _The\r\nRenaissance in Italy_, undoubtedly his greatest work, and of many critical\r\nessays; Walter Pater, whose _Appreciations_ and numerous other works mark\r\nhim as one of our best literary critics; and Leslie Stephen, famous for his\r\nwork on the monumental _Dictionary of National Biography_, and for his\r\n_Hours in a Library_, a series of impartial and excellent criticisms,\r\nbrightened by the play of an original and delightful humor.\r\n\r\nAmong the most famous writers of the age are the scientists, Lyell, Darwin,\r\nHuxley, Spencer, Tyndall, and Wallace,--a wonderful group of men whose\r\nworks, though they hardly belong to our present study, have exercised an\r\nincalculable influence on our life and literature. Darwin's _Origin of\r\nSpecies_ (1859), which apparently established the theory of evolution, was\r\nan epoch-making book. It revolutionized not only our conceptions of natural\r\nhistory, but also our methods of thinking on all the problems of human\r\nsociety. Those who would read a summary of the greatest scientific\r\ndiscovery of the age will find it in Wallace's _Darwinism_,--a most\r\ninteresting book, written by the man who claims, with Darwin, the honor of\r\nfirst announcing the principle of evolution. And, from a multitude of\r\nscientific works, we recommend also to the general reader Huxley's\r\n_Autobiography_ and his _Lay Sermons, Addresses, and Reviews_, partly\r\nbecause they are excellent expressions of the spirit and methods of\r\nscience, and partly because Huxley as a writer is perhaps the clearest and\r\nthe most readable of the scientists.\r\n\r\nTHE SPIRIT OF MODERN LITERATURE. As we reflect on the varied work of the\r\nVictorian writers, three marked characteristics invite our attention.\r\nFirst, our great literary men, no less than our great scientists, have made\r\ntruth the supreme object of human endeavor. All these eager poets,\r\nnovelists, and essayists, questing over so many different ways, are equally\r\nintent on discovering the truth of life. Men as far apart as Darwin and\r\nNewman are strangely alike in spirit, one seeking truth in the natural, the\r\nother in the spiritual history of the race. Second, literature has become\r\nthe mirror of truth; and the first requirement of every serious novel or\r\nessay is to be true to the life or the facts which it represents. Third,\r\nliterature has become animated by a definite moral purpose. It is not\r\nenough for the Victorian writers to create or attempt an artistic work for\r\nits own sake; the work must have a definite lesson for humanity. The poets\r\nare not only singers, but leaders; they hold up an ideal, and they compel\r\nmen to recognize and follow it. The novelists tell a story which pictures\r\nhuman life, and at the same time call us to the work Of social reform, or\r\ndrive home a moral lesson. The essayists are nearly all prophets or\r\nteachers, and use literature as the chief instrument of progress and\r\neducation. Among them all we find comparatively little of the exuberant\r\nfancy, the romantic ardor, and the boyish gladness of the Elizabethans.\r\nThey write books not primarily to delight the artistic sense, but to give\r\nbread to the hungry and water to the thirsty in soul. Milton's famous\r\nsentence, \"A good book is the precious life-blood of a master spirit,\"\r\nmight be written across the whole Victorian era. We are still too near\r\nthese writers to judge how far their work suffers artistically from their\r\npractical purpose; but this much is certain,--that whether or not they\r\ncreated immortal works, their books have made the present world a better\r\nand a happier place to live in. And that is perhaps the best that can be\r\nsaid of the work of any artist or artisan.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE VICTORIAN AGE. The year 1830 is generally placed at the\r\nbeginning of this period, but its limits are very indefinite. In general we\r\nmay think of it as covering the reign of Victoria (1837-1901). Historically\r\nthe age is remarkable for the growth of democracy following the Reform Bill\r\nof 1832; for the spread of education among all classes; for the rapid\r\ndevelopment of the arts and sciences; for important mechanical inventions;\r\nand for the enormous extension of the bounds of human knowledge by the\r\ndiscoveries of science.\r\n\r\nAt the accession of Victoria the romantic movement had spent its force;\r\nWordsworth had written his best work; the other romantic poets, Coleridge,\r\nShelley, Keats, and Byron, had passed away; and for a time no new\r\ndevelopment was apparent in English poetry. Though the Victorian Age\r\nproduced two great poets, Tennyson and Browning, the age, as a whole, is\r\nremarkable for the variety and excellence of its prose. A study of all the\r\ngreat writers of the period reveals four general characteristics: (1)\r\nLiterature in this Age has come very close to daily life, reflecting its\r\npractical problems and interests, and is a powerful instrument of human\r\nprogress. (2) The tendency of literature is strongly ethical; all the great\r\npoets, novelists, and essayists of the age are moral teachers. (3) Science\r\nin this age exercises an incalculable influence. On the one hand it\r\nemphasizes truth as the sole object of human endeavor; it has established\r\nthe principle of law throughout the universe; and it has given us an\r\nentirely new view of life, as summed up in the word \"evolution,\" that is,\r\nthe principle of growth or development from simple to complex forms. On the\r\nother hand, its first effect seems to be to discourage works of the\r\nimagination. Though the age produced an incredible number of books, very\r\nfew of them belong among the great creative works of literature. (4) Though\r\nthe age is generally characterized as practical and materialistic, it is\r\nsignificant that nearly all the writers whom the nation delights to honor\r\nvigorously attack materialism, and exalt a purely ideal conception of life.\r\nOn the whole, we are inclined to call this an idealistic age fundamentally,\r\nsince love, truth, justice, brotherhood--all great ideals--are emphasized\r\nas the chief ends of life, not only by its poets but also by its novelists\r\nand essayists.\r\n\r\nIn our study we have considered: (1) The Poets; the life and works of\r\nTennyson and Browning; and the chief characteristics of the minor poets,\r\nElizabeth Barrett (Mrs. Browning), Rossetti, Morris, and Swinburne. (2) The\r\nNovelists; the life and works of Dickens, Thackeray, and George Eliot; and\r\nthe chief works of Charles Reade, Anthony Trollope, Charlotte Brontë,\r\nBulwer-Lytton, Kingsley, Mrs. Gaskell, Blackmore, George Meredith, Hardy,\r\nand Stevenson. (3) The Essayists; the life and works of Macaulay, Matthew\r\nArnold, Carlyle, Newman, and Ruskin. These were selected, from among many\r\nessayists and miscellaneous writers, as most typical of the Victorian Age.\r\nThe great scientists, like Lyell, Darwin, Huxley, Wallace, Tyndall, and\r\nSpencer, hardly belong to our study of literature, though their works are\r\nof vast importance; and we omit the works of living writers who belong to\r\nthe present rather than to the past century.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTIONS FOR READING.

What are the\r\nchief characteristics of Victorian literature? Name the chief writers of\r\nthe period in prose and poetry. What books of this period are, in your\r\njudgment, worthy to be placed among the great works of literature? What\r\neffect did the discoveries of science have upon the literature of the age?\r\nWhat poet reflects the new conception of law and evolution? What historical\r\nconditions account for the fact that most of the Victorian writers are\r\nethical teachers?\r\n\r\n2. _Tennyson_. Give a brief sketch of Tennyson's life, and name his chief\r\nworks. Why is he, like Chaucer, a national poet? Is your pleasure in\r\nreading Tennyson due chiefly to the thought or the melody of expression?\r\nNote this figure in \"The Lotos Eaters\":\r\n\r\n    Music that gentlier on the spirit lies\r\n    Than tired eyelids upon tired eyes.\r\n\r\nWhat does this suggest concerning Tennyson's figures of speech in general?\r\nCompare \"Locksley Hall\" with \"Locksley Hall Sixty Years After.\" What\r\ndifferences do you find in thought, in workmanship, and in poetic\r\nenthusiasm? What is Tennyson's idea of faith and immortality as expressed\r\nin _In Memoriam_?\r\n\r\n3. _Browning_. In what respects is Browning like Shakespeare? What is meant\r\nby the optimism of his poetry? Can you explain why many thoughtful persons\r\nprefer him to Tennyson? What is Browning's creed as expressed in \"Rabbi Ben\r\nEzra\"? Read \"Fra Lippo Lippi\" or \"Andrea del Sarto,\" and tell what is meant\r\nby a dramatic monologue. In \"Andrea\" what is meant by the lines,\r\n\r\n    Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp,\r\n    Or what's a heaven for?\r\n\r\n4. _Dickens_. What experiences in Dickens's life are reflected in his\r\nnovels? What are his favorite types of character? What is meant by the\r\nexaggeration of Dickens? What was the serious purpose of his novels? Make a\r\nbrief analysis of the _Tale of Two Cities_, having in mind the plot, the\r\ncharacters, and the style, as compared with Dickens's other novels.\r\n\r\n5. _Thackeray_. Read _Henry Esmond_ and explain Thackeray's realism. What\r\nis there remarkable in the style of this novel? Compare it with _Ivanhoe_\r\nas a historical novel. What is the general character of Thackeray's satire?\r\nWhat are the chief characteristics of his novels? Describe briefly the\r\nworks which show his great skill as a critical writer.\r\n\r\n6. _George Eliot_. Read _Silas Marner_ and make a brief analysis, having in\r\nmind the plot, the characters, the style, and the ethical teaching of the\r\nnovel. Is the moral teaching of George Eliot convincing; that is, does it\r\nsuggest itself from the story, or is it added for effect? What is the\r\ngeneral impression left by her books? How do her characters compare with\r\nthose of Dickens and Thackeray?\r\n\r\n7. _Carlyle_. Why is Carlyle called a prophet, and why a censor? Read the\r\n_Essay on Burns_ and make an analysis, having in mind the style, the idea\r\nof criticism, and the picture which this essay presents of the Scotch poet.\r\nIs Carlyle chiefly interested in Burns or in his poetry? Does he show any\r\nmarked appreciation of Burns's power as a lyric poet? What is Carlyle's\r\nidea of history as shown in _Heroes and Hero Worship_? What experiences of\r\nhis own life are reflected in _Sartor Resartus_? What was Carlyle's message\r\nto his age? What is meant by a \"Carlylese\" style?\r\n\r\n8. _Macaulay_. In what respects is Macaulay typical of his age? Compare his\r\nview of life with that of Carlyle. Read one of the essays, on Milton or\r\nAddison, and make an analysis, having in mind the style, the interest, and\r\nthe accuracy of the essay. What useful purpose does Macaulay's historical\r\nknowledge serve in writing his literary essays? What is the general\r\ncharacter of Macaulay's _History of England_? Rqad a chapter from\r\nMacaulay's _History_, another from Carlyle's _French Revolution_, and\r\ncompare the two. How does each writer regard history and historical\r\nwriting? What differences do you note in their methods? What are the best\r\nqualities of each work? Why are both unreliable?\r\n\r\n9. _Arnold_. What elements of Victorian life are reflected in Arnold's\r\npoetry? How do you account for the coldness and sadness of his verses? Read\r\n_Sohrab and Rustum_ and write an account of it, having in mind the story,\r\nArnold's use of his material, the style, and the classic elements in the\r\npoem. How does it compare in melody with the blank verse of Milton or\r\nTennyson? What marked contrasts do you find between the poetry and the\r\nprose of Arnold?\r\n\r\n10. _Ruskin_. In what respects is Ruskin \"the prophet of modern society\"?\r\nRead the first two lectures in _Sesame and Lilies_ and then give Ruskin's\r\nviews of labor, wealth, books, education, woman's sphere, and human\r\nsociety. How does he regard the commercialism of his age? What elements of\r\nstyle do you find in these lectures? Give the chief resemblances and\r\ndifferences between Carlyle and Ruskin.\r\n\r\n11. Read Mrs. Gaskell's _Cranford_ and describe it, having in mind the\r\nstyle, the interest, and the characters of the story. How does it compare,\r\nas a picture of country life, with George Eliot's novels?\r\n\r\n12. Read Blackmore's _Lorna Doone_ and describe it (as in the question\r\nabove). What are the romantic elements in the story? How does it compare\r\nwith Scott's romances in style, in plot, in interest, and in truthfulness\r\nto life?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHRONOLOGY\r\n                       _Nineteenth Century_\r\n============================================================================\r\n  HISTORY                        |  LITERATURE\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                                 | 1825.

The following lists include the books most\r\nuseful for general reference work and for supplementary reading.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of history is of great advantage in the study of literature. In\r\neach of the preceding chapters we have given a brief summary of historical\r\nevents and social conditions, but the student should do more than simply\r\nread these summaries. He should review rapidly the whole history of each\r\nperiod by means of a good textbook. Montgomery's _English History_ and\r\nCheyney's _Short History of England_ are recommended, but any other\r\nreliable text-book will serve the purpose.\r\n\r\nFor literary texts and selections for reading a few general collections,\r\nsuch as are given below, are useful; but the important works of each author\r\nmay now be obtained in excellent and inexpensive school editions. At the\r\nbeginning of the course the teacher, or the home student, should write for\r\nthe latest catalogue of such publications as the Standard English Classics,\r\nEveryman's Library, etc., which offer a very wide range of reading at small\r\ncost. Nearly every publishing house issues a series of good English books\r\nfor school use, and the list is constantly increasing.\r\n\r\n_HISTORY_\r\n\r\n_Text-books:_ Montgomery's English History; Cheyney's Short History of\r\nEngland (Ginn and Company).\r\n\r\n_General Works:_ Green's Short History of the English People, 1 vol., or A\r\nHistory of the English People, 4 vols.

It refers, probably, to some\r\nlegend of the Anglo-Saxons which we have supplied from other sources, aided\r\nby some vague suggestions and glimpses of the past in the poem itself.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:   This is not the Beowulf who is hero of the poem.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:   _Beowulf_, ll. 26-50, a free rendering to suggest the\r\nalliteration of the original.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:   Grendel, of the Eoten (giant) race, the death shadow, the\r\nmark stalker, the shadow ganger, is also variously called god's foe, fiend\r\nof hell, Cain's brood, etc. It need hardly be explained that the latter\r\nterms are additions to the original poem, made, probably, by monks who\r\ncopied the manuscript. A belief in Wyrd, the mighty power controlling the\r\ndestinies of men, is the chief religious motive of the epic. In line 1056\r\nwe find a curious blending of pagan and Christian belief, where Wyrd is\r\nwithstood by the \"wise God.\"\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:   Summary of ll. 710-727. We have not indicated in our\r\ntranslation (or in quotations from Garnett, Morley, Brooke, etc.) where\r\nparts of the text are omitted.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:   Grendel's mother belongs also to the Eoten (giant) race. She\r\nis called _brimwylf_ (sea wolf), _merewif_ (sea woman), _grundwyrgen_\r\n(bottom master), etc.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:   From Garnett's _Beowulf_, ll. 1384-1394.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:   From Morley's version, ll. 1357-1376.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:   _Beowulf_, ll. 2417-2423, a free rendering.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:   Lines 2729-2740, a free rendering.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:   Morley's version, ll. 2799-2816.\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:   Lines 3156-3182 (Morley's version).\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:   Probably to the fourth century, though some parts of the\r\npoem must have been added later. Thus the poet says (II. 88-102) that he\r\nvisited Eormanric, who died _cir_. 375, and Queen Ealhhild whose father,\r\nEadwin, died _cir_. 561. The difficulty of fixing a date to the poem is\r\napparent. It contains several references to scenes and characters in\r\n_Beowulf_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:   Lines 135-143 (Morley's version).\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:   A lyric is a short poem reflecting some personal emotion,\r\nlike love or grief. Two other Anglo-Saxon poems, \"The Wife's Complaint\" and\r\n\"The Husband's Message,\" belong to this class.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:   First strophe of Brooke's version, _History of Early English\r\nLiterature_\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:   _Seafarer_, Part I, Iddings' version, in _Translations from\r\nOld English Poetry._\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:   It is an open question whether this poem celebrates the\r\nfight at which Hnæf, the Danish leader, fell, or a later fight led by\r\nHengist, to avenge Hnæf's death.\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:   Brooke's translation, _History of Early English Literature_,\r\nFor another early battle-song see Tennyson's \"Battle of Brunanburh.\"\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:   William Camden (1551-1623), one of England's earliest and\r\ngreatest antiquarians. His first work, _Britannia_, a Latin history of\r\nEngland, has been called \"the common sun whereat our modern writers have\r\nall kindled their little torches.\"\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:   From Iddings' version of _The Seafarer_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:   From _Andreas_, ll. 511 ff., a free translation. The whole\r\npoem thrills with the Old Saxon love of the sea and of ships.\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:   From _Beowulf_, ll. 1063 ff., a free translation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:   Translated from _The Husband's Message_, written on a piece\r\nof bark. With wonderful poetic insight the bark itself is represented as\r\ntelling its story to the wife, from the time when the birch tree grew\r\nbeside the sea until the exiled man found it and stripped the bark and\r\ncarved on its surface a message to the woman he loved. This first of all\r\nEnglish love songs deserves to rank with Valentine's description of Silvia:\r\n\r\n               Why, man, she is mine own,\r\n    And I as rich in having such a jewel\r\n    As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,\r\n    The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.\r\n_Two Gentlemen of Verona_, II, 4.\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:   From the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, record of the year 457.\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:   According to Sweet the original home of the Aryans is placed\r\nin central or northern Europe, rather than in Asia, as was once assumed.\r\nSee _The History of Language_, p. 103.\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:   \"Cædmon's Hymn,\" Cook's version, in _Translations from Old\r\nEnglish Poetry_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:   _Ecclesiastical History_, IV, xxiv.\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:   Genesis, 112-131 (Morley).\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:   Exodus, 155 ff. (Brooke).\r\n\r\nFootnote 32:   Runes were primitive letters of the old northern alphabet.\r\nIn a few passages Cynewulf uses each rune to represent not only a letter\r\nbut a word beginning with that letter. Thus the rune-equivalent of C stands\r\nfor _cene_ (keen, courageous), Y for _yfel_ (evil, in the sense of\r\nwretched), N for _nyd_ (need), W for _ivyn_ (joy), U for _ur_ (our), L for\r\n_lagu_ (lake), F for _feoh_ (fee, wealth). Using the runes equivalent to\r\nthese seven letters, Cynewulf hides and at the same time reveals his name\r\nin certain verses of _The Christ_, for instance:\r\n\r\n    Then the _Courage-hearted_ quakes, when the King (Lord) he hears\r\n    Speak to those who once on earth but obeyed Him weakly,\r\n    While as yet their _Yearning fain_ and their _Need_\r\n    most easily Comfort might discover.... Gone is then the _Winsomeness_\r\n    Of the earth's adornments! What to _Us_ as men belonged\r\n    Of the joys of life was locked, long ago, in _Lake-flood_.\r\n    All the _Fee_ on earth.\r\nSee Brooke's _History of Early English Literature_, pp. 377-379, or _The\r\nChrist of Cynewulf_, ed. by Cook, also by Gollancz.\r\n\r\nFootnote 33:\r\n    My robe is noiseless while I tread the earth,\r\n    Or tarry 'neath the banks, or stir the shallows;\r\n    But when these shining wings, this depth of air,\r\n    Bear me aloft above the bending shores\r\n    Where men abide, and far the welkin's strength\r\n    Over the multitudes conveys me, then\r\n    With rushing whir and clear melodious sound\r\n    My raiment sings. And like a wandering spirit\r\n    I float unweariedly o'er flood and field.\r\n(Brougham's version, in _Transl. from Old Eng. Poetry_.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:   The source of _Andreas_ is an early Greek legend of St.\r\nAndrew that found its way to England and was probably known to Cynewulf in\r\nsome brief Latin form, now lost.\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:   Our two chief sources are the famous Exeter Book, in Exeter\r\nCathedral, a collection of Anglo-Saxon poems presented by Bishop Leofric\r\n(_c_. 1050), and the Vercelli Book, discovered in the monastery of\r\nVercelli, Italy, in 1822. The only known manuscript of _Beowulf_ was\r\ndiscovered _c_. 1600, and is now in the Cotton Library of the British\r\nMuseum. All these are fragmentary copies, and show the marks of fire and of\r\nhard usage. The Exeter Book contains _the Christ, Guthlac, the Phoenix,\r\nJuliana, Widsith, The Seafarer, Deor's Lament, The Wife's Complaint, The\r\nLover's Message_, ninety-five Riddles, and many short hymns and\r\nfragments,--an astonishing variety for a single manuscript.\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:   From Alfred's _Boethius_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:   It is not certain that the translation of Bede is the work\r\nof Alfred.\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:   See _Translations from Old English Poetry_. Only a brief\r\naccount of the fight is given in the _Chronicle_. The song known as \"The\r\nBattle of Maldon,\" or \"Byrhtnoth's Death,\" is recorded in another\r\nmanuscript.\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:   This is an admirable little book, containing the cream of\r\nAnglo-Saxon poetry, in free translations, with notes. Translations from\r\n_Old English Prose_ is a companion volume.\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:   For full titles and publishers of general reference books,\r\nand for a list of inexpensive texts and helps, see General Bibliography at\r\nthe end of this book.\r\n\r\nFootnote 41:   The chief object of these questions is not to serve as a\r\nreview, or to prepare for examination, but rather to set the student\r\nthinking for himself about what he has read. A few questions of an advanced\r\nnature are inserted which call for special study and research in\r\ninteresting fields.\r\n\r\nFootnote 42:   A Romance language is one whose basis is Latin,--not the\r\nclassic language of literature, but a vulgar or popular Latin spoken in the\r\nmilitary camps and provinces. Thus Italian, Spanish, and French were\r\noriginally different dialects of the vulgar Latin, slightly modified by the\r\nmingling of the Roman soldiers with the natives of the conquered provinces.\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:   See p. 51.\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:   It is interesting to note that all the chroniclers of the\r\nperiod, whether of English or Norman birth, unite in admiration of the\r\ngreat figures of English history, as it was then understood. Brutus,\r\nArthur, Hengist, Horsa, Edward the Confessor, and William of Normandy are\r\nall alike set down as English heroes. In a French poem of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, for instance, we read that \"there is no land in the world where so\r\nmany good kings and saints have lived as in the isle of the English ...\r\nsuch as the strong and brave Arthur, Edmund, and Cnut.\" This national poem,\r\ncelebrating the English Edward, was written in French by a Norman monk of\r\nWestminster Abbey, and its first heroes are a Celt, a Saxon, and a Dane.\r\n(See Jusserand, _Literary History of the English People_, I, 112 ff.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:   _English Literature from the Norman Conquest to Chaucer_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:   Anselm was an Italian by birth, but wrote his famous work\r\nwhile holding the see of Canterbury.\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:   During the Roman occupancy of Britain occurred a curious\r\nmingling of Celtic and Roman traditions. The Welsh began to associate their\r\nnational hero Arthur with Roman ancestors; hence the story of Brutus,\r\ngreat-grandson of Aeneas, the first king of Britain, as related by Geoffrey\r\nand Layamon.\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:   Probably a Latin copy of Bede.\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:   Wace's translation of Geoffrey.\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:   Only one word in about three hundred and fifty is of French\r\norigin. A century later Robert Mannyng uses one French word in eighty,\r\nwhile Chaucer has one in six or seven. This includes repetitions, and is a\r\nfair estimate rather than an exact computation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 51:   The matter of Britain refers strictly to the Arthurian, i.e.\r\nthe Welsh romances; and so another division, the matter of England, may be\r\nnoted. This includes tales of popular English heroes, like Bevis of\r\nHampton, Guy of Warwick, Horn Child, etc.\r\n\r\nFootnote 52:   According to mediæval literary custom these songs were\r\nrarely signed. Later, when many songs were made over into a long poem, the\r\nauthor signed his name to the entire work, without indicating what he had\r\nborrowed\r\n\r\nFootnote 53:   An English book in which such romances were written was\r\ncalled a Gest or Jest Book. So also at the beginning of _Cursor Mundi_\r\n(_c_. 1320) we read:\r\n\r\n    Men yernen jestis for to here\r\n    And romaunce rede in diverse manere,\r\n\r\nand then follows a summary of the great cycles of romance, which we are\r\nconsidering.\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:   Tennyson goes farther than Malory in making Gawain false and\r\nirreverent. That seems to be a mistake; for in all the earliest romances\r\nGawain is, next to Arthur, the noblest of knights, the most loved and\r\nhonored of all the heroes of the Round Table.\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:   There were various French versions of the story; but it came\r\noriginally from the Irish, where the hero was called Cuchulinn.\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:   It is often alleged that in this romance we have a very\r\npoetical foundation for the Order of the Garter, which was instituted by\r\nEdward III, in 1349; but the history of the order makes this extremely\r\ndoubtful. The reader will be chiefly interested in comparing this romance\r\nwith _Beowulf_, for instance, to see what new ideals have taken root in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:   Originally Cockaygne (variously spelled) was intended to\r\nridicule the mythical country of Avalon, somewhat as Cervantes' _Don\r\nQuixote_ later ridicules the romances of chivalry. In Luxury Land\r\neverything was good to eat; houses were built of dainties and shingled with\r\ncakes; buttered larks fell instead of rain; the streams ran with good wine;\r\nand roast geese passed slowly down the streets, turning themselves as they\r\nwent.\r\n\r\nFootnote 58:   Child's _English and Scottish Popular Ballads_ is the most\r\nscholarly and complete collection in our language. Gummere's _Old English\r\nBallads_ is a good short work. Professor Kittredge's Introduction to the\r\nCambridge edition of Child's _Ballads_ is the best summary of a very\r\ndifficult subject. For an extended discussion of the literary character of\r\nthe ballad, see Gummere's _The Popular Ballad_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:   little bird.\r\n\r\nFootnote 60:   in her language.\r\n\r\nFootnote 61:   I live\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:   fairest\r\n\r\nFootnote 63:   I am\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:   power, bondage.\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:   a pleasant fate I have attained.\r\n\r\nFootnote 66:   I know\r\n\r\nFootnote 67:   gone\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:   lit, alighted\r\n\r\nFootnote 69:   For titles and publishers of reference books see General\r\nBibliography at the end of this book.\r\n\r\nFootnote 70:   The reader may perhaps be more interested in these final\r\nletters, which are sometimes sounded and again silent, if he remembers that\r\nthey represent the decaying inflections of our old Anglo-Saxon speech.\r\n\r\nFootnote 71:   _House of Fame_, II, 652 ff.

Individual poems, essays, etc., are\r\nin Roman letters with quotation marks. Thus we have the \"Knight's Tale,\" or\r\nthe story of \"Palamon and Arcite,\" in the _Canterbury Tales_. This system\r\nseems on the whole the best, though it may result in some inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nFootnote 84:   _Troilus and Criseyde_, III.\r\n\r\nFootnote 85:   See p. 107.\r\n\r\nFootnote 86:   For a summary of Chaucer's work and place in our literature,\r\nsee the Comparison with Spenser, p. 111.\r\n\r\nFootnote 87:   clad.\r\n\r\nFootnote 88:   wonder.\r\n\r\nFootnote 89:   brook.\r\n\r\nFootnote 90:   sounded.\r\n\r\nFootnote 91:   theirs\r\n\r\nFootnote 92:   rule\r\n\r\nFootnote 93:   righteousness\r\n\r\nFootnote 94:   called\r\n\r\nFootnote 95:   theirs\r\n\r\nFootnote 96:   yield\r\n\r\nFootnote 97:   say\r\n\r\nFootnote 98:   them\r\n\r\nFootnote 99:   hate\r\n\r\nFootnote 100:   persecute\r\n\r\nFootnote 101:   slander\r\n\r\nFootnote 102:   rains\r\n\r\nFootnote 103:   In its English form the alleged Mandeville describes the\r\nlands and customs he has seen, and brings in all the wonders he has heard\r\nabout. Many things he has seen himself, he tells us, and these are\r\ncertainly true; but others he has heard in his travels, and of these the\r\nreader must judge for himself. Then he incidentally mentions a desert where\r\nhe saw devils as thick as grasshoppers. As for things that he has been told\r\nby devout travelers, here are the dog-faced men, and birds that carry off\r\nelephants, and giants twenty-eight feet tall, and dangerous women who have\r\nbright jewels in their heads instead of eyes, \"and if they behold any man\r\nin wrath, they slay him with a look, as doth the basilisk.\" Here also are\r\nthe folk of Ethiopia, who have only one leg, but who hop about with\r\nextraordinary rapidity. Their one foot is so big that, when they lie in the\r\nsun, they raise it to shade their bodies; in rainy weather it is as good as\r\nan umbrella. At the close of this interesting book of travel, which is a\r\nguide for pilgrims, the author promises to all those who say a prayer for\r\nhim a share in whatever heavenly grace he may himself obtain for all his\r\nholy pilgrimages.\r\n\r\nFootnote 104:   For titles and publishers of reference works see General\r\nBibliography at the end of this book.\r\n\r\nFootnote 105:   _Constitutional History of England_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 106:   Symonds, _Revival of Learning_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 107:   Sismondi attributes this to two causes: first, the lack of\r\ngeneral culture; and second, the absorption of the schools in the new study\r\nof antiquity.

He was born at\r\nRotterdam (_c_. 1466), but lived the greater part of his life in France,\r\nSwitzerland, England, and Italy. His _Encomium Moriae_ was sketched on a\r\njourney from Italy (1509) and written while he was the guest of Sir Thomas\r\nMore in London.\r\n\r\nFootnote 109:   Unless, perchance, the reader finds some points of\r\nresemblance in Plato's \"Republic.\"\r\n\r\nFootnote 110:   See Wordsworth's sonnet, _On the Sonnet_.

He learned the art abroad, probably at Cologne or Bruges, and\r\nabout the year 1476 set up the first wooden printing press in England. His\r\ninfluence in fixing a national language to supersede the various dialects,\r\nand in preparing the way for the literary renaissance of the Elizabethan\r\nage, is beyond calculation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 112:   Malory has, in our own day, been identified with an English\r\ncountry gentleman and soldier, who was member of Parliament for\r\nWarwickshire in 1445.\r\n\r\nFootnote 113:   For titles and publishers of general works see General\r\nBibliography at the end of this book.\r\n\r\nFootnote 114:   _Eastward Ho!_ a play given in Blackfriars Theater about\r\n1603.

An\r\nexquisite account of this most impressive service is preserved in St.\r\nEthelwold's Latin manual of church services, written about 965. The Latin\r\nand English versions are found in Chambers's _Mediaeval Stage_, Vol. II.\r\nFor a brief, interesting description, see Gayley, _Plays of Our\r\nForefathers_, pp. 14 ff.\r\n\r\nFootnote 127:   How much we are indebted to the Norman love of pageantry\r\nfor the development of the drama in England is an unanswered question.\r\nDuring the Middle Ages it was customary, in welcoming a monarch or in\r\ncelebrating a royal wedding, to represent allegorical and mythological\r\nscenes, like the combat of St. George and the dragon, for instance, on a\r\nstage constructed for the purpose. These pageants were popular all over\r\nEurope and developed during the Renaissance into the dramatic form known as\r\nthe Masque. Though the drama was of religious origin, we must not overlook\r\nthese secular pageants as an important factor in the development of\r\ndramatic art.\r\n\r\nFootnote 128:   Miracles were acted on the Continent earlier than this. The\r\nNormans undoubtedly brought religious plays with them, but it is probable\r\nthat they began in England before the Conquest (1066). See Manly,\r\n_Specimens of the Pre-Shaksperean Drama_, I, xix.\r\n\r\nFootnote 129:   See Jusserand, _A Literary History of the English People_,\r\nI, iii, vi. For our earliest plays and their authors see Gayley, _Plays of\r\nOur Forefathers_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 130:   These three periods are not historically accurate. The\r\nauthor uses them to emphasize three different views of our earliest plays\r\nrather than to suggest that there was any orderly or chronological\r\ndevelopment from Miracle to Morality and thence to the Interludes. The\r\nlatter is a prevalent opinion, but it seems hardly warranted by the facts.\r\nThus, though the Miracles precede the Moralities by two centuries (the\r\nfirst known Morality, \"The Play of the Lord's Prayer,\" mentioned by Wyclif,\r\nwas given probably about 1375), some of the best known Moralities, like\r\n\"Pride of Life,\" precede many of the later York Miracles. And the term\r\nInterlude, which is often used as symbolical of the transition from the\r\nmoral to the artistic period of the drama, was occasionally used in England\r\n(fourteenth century) as synonymous with Miracle and again (sixteenth\r\ncentury) as synonymous with Comedy. That the drama had these three stages\r\nseems reasonably certain; but it is impossible to fix the limits of any one\r\nof them, and all three are sometimes seen together in one of the later\r\nMiracles of the Wakefield cycle.\r\n\r\nFootnote 131:   In fact, Heywood \"cribbed\" from Chaucer's _Tales_ in\r\nanother Interlude called \"The Pardoner and the Frere.\"\r\n\r\nFootnote 132:   Schelling, _Elizabethan Drama_, I, 86.\r\n\r\nFootnote 133:   That these gallants were an unmitigated nuisance, and had\r\nfrequently to be silenced by the common people who came to enjoy the play,\r\nseems certain. Dekker's _Gull's Hornbook_ (1609) has an interesting chapter\r\non \"How a Gallant should behave Himself in a Playhouse.\"\r\n\r\nFootnote 134:   The first actors were classed with thieves and vagabonds;\r\nbut they speedily raised their profession to an art and won a reputation\r\nwhich extended far abroad. Thus a contemporary, Fynes Moryson, writes in\r\nhis _Itinerary:_ \"So I remember that when some of our cast despised stage\r\nplayers came ... into Germany and played at Franckford ... having nether a\r\ncomplete number of actors, nor any good aparell, nor any ornament of the\r\nstage, yet the Germans, not understanding a worde they sayde, both men and\r\nwemen, flocked wonderfully to see their gesture and action.\"\r\n\r\nFootnote 135:   Schelling, _Elizabethan Drama_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 136:   Baker, in his _Development of Shakespeare as a Dramatist_,\r\npp. 57-62, takes a different view, and shows how carefully many of the boy\r\nactors were trained. It would require, however, a vigorous use of the\r\nimagination to be satisfied with a boy's presentation of Portia, Juliet,\r\nCordelia, Rosalind, or any other of Shakespeare's wonderful women.\r\n\r\nFootnote 137:   These choir masters had royal permits to take boys of good\r\nvoice, wherever found, and train them as singers and actors. The boys were\r\ntaken from their parents and were often half starved and most brutally\r\ntreated. The abuse of this unnatural privilege led to the final withdrawal\r\nof all such permits.\r\n\r\nFootnote 138:   So called from Euphues, the hero of Lyly's two prose works,\r\n_Euphues, the Anatomy of Wit_ (1579), and _Euphues and his England_ (1580).\r\nThe style is affected and over-elegant, abounds in odd conceits, and uses\r\nhopelessly involved sentences. It is found in nearly all Elizabethan prose\r\nwriters, and partially accounts for their general tendency to\r\nartificiality. Shakespeare satirizes euphuism in the character of Don\r\nAdriano of _Love's Labour's Lost_, but is himself tiresomely euphuistic at\r\ntimes, especially in his early or \"Lylian\" comedies. Lyly, by the way, did\r\nnot invent the style, but did more than any other to diffuse it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 139:   See Schelling, I, 211.\r\n\r\nFootnote 140:   See p. 114.\r\n\r\nFootnote 141:   In 1587 the first history of Johann Faust, a half-legendary\r\nGerman necromancer, appeared in Frankfort. Where Marlowe found the story is\r\nunknown; but he used it, as Goethe did two centuries later, for the basis\r\nof his great tragedy.\r\n\r\nFootnote 142:   We must remember, however, that our present version of\r\n_Faustus_ is very much mutilated, and does not preserve the play as Marlowe\r\nwrote it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 143:   The two dramatists may have worked together in such\r\ndoubtful plays as _Richard III_, the hero of which is like Timur in an\r\nEnglish dress, and _Titus Andronicus_, with its violence and horror. In\r\nmany strong scenes in Shakespeare's works Marlowe's influence is manifest.\r\n\r\nFootnote 144:   _Gammer Gurton's Needle_ appeared _c_. 1562; _Love's\r\nLabour's Lost, c_. 1591.\r\n\r\nFootnote 145:   _King John_, IV, 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 146:   Queen Mab, in _Romeo and Juliet_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 147:   By Archdeacon Davies, in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nFootnote 148:   In 1709, nearly a century after the poet's death.\r\n\r\nFootnote 149:   Robert Greene, one of the popular playwrights of the time,\r\nwho attacked Shakespeare in a pamphlet called \"A Groat's Worth of Wit\r\nBought with a Million of Repentance.\" The pamphlet, aside from its jealousy\r\nof Shakespeare, is a sad picture of a man of genius dying of dissipation,\r\nand contains a warning to other playwrights of the time, whose lives were\r\napparently almost as bad as that of Greene.\r\n\r\nFootnote 150:   _Love's Labour's Lost, Comedy of Errors, Two Gentlemen of\r\nVerona_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 151:   _Henry VI, Richard III, Richard II, King John_. Prior to\r\n1588 only three true Chronicle plays are known to have been acted. The\r\ndefeat of the Armada in that year led to an outburst of national feeling\r\nwhich found one outlet in the theaters, and in the next ten years over\r\neighty Chronicle plays appeared. Of these Shakespeare furnished nine or\r\nten. It was the great popular success of _Henry VI_, a revision of an old\r\nplay, in 1592 that probably led to Greene's jealous attack.\r\n\r\nFootnote 152:   See Lee's _Life of William Shakespeare_, pp. 188-196.\r\n\r\nFootnote 153:   Like _Henry VIII_, and possibly the lost _Cardenio_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 154:   A name given to the privilege--claimed by the mediæval\r\nChurch for its clergy--of being exempt from trial by the regular law\r\ncourts. After the Reformation the custom survived for a long time, and\r\nspecial privileges were allowed to ministers and their families. Jonson\r\nclaimed the privilege as a minister's son.\r\n\r\nFootnote 155:   A similar story of quackery is found in Chaucer, \"The\r\nCanon's Yeoman's Tale.\"\r\n\r\nFootnote 156:   In this and in _A Fair Quarrel_ Middleton collaborated with\r\nWilliam Rowley, of whom little is known except that he was an actor from\r\n_c_. 1607-1627.\r\n\r\nFootnote 157:   The reader will find wholesome criticism of these writers,\r\nand selections from their works, in Charles Lamb's _Specimens of English\r\nDramatic Poets_, an excellent book, which helps us to a better knowledge\r\nand appreciation of the lesser Elizabethan dramatists.\r\n\r\nFootnote 158:   The first five books were published 1594-1597, and are as\r\nHooker wrote them. The last three books, published after his death, are of\r\ndoubtful authorship, but they are thought to have been completed from\r\nHooker's notes.\r\n\r\nFootnote 159:   For titles and publishers of reference works see General\r\nBibliography at the end of this book.\r\n\r\nFootnote 160:   See, for instance, the \"Hymn to St. Theresa\" and \"The\r\nFlaming Heart.\"\r\n\r\nFootnote 161:   So called from Pindar, the greatest lyric poet of Greece.\r\n\r\nFootnote 162:   See, for instance, \"Childhood,\" \"The Retreat,\"\r\n\"Corruption,\" \"The Bird,\" \"The Hidden Flower,\" for Vaughan's mystic\r\ninterpretation of childhood and nature.\r\n\r\nFootnote 163:   There is some doubt as to whether he was born at the\r\nCastle, or at Black Hall.

Thus his Horton poems are joyous, almost Elizabethan in\r\ncharacter; his prose is stern, militant, unyielding, like the Puritan in\r\nhis struggle for liberty; his later poetry, following the apparent failure\r\nof Puritanism in the Restoration, has a note of sadness, yet proclaims the\r\neternal principles of liberty and justice for which he had lived.\r\n\r\nFootnote 167:   Of these sixty were taken from the Bible, thirty-three from\r\nEnglish and five from Scotch history.\r\n\r\nFootnote 168:   The latter was by Lewis Bayly, bishop of Bangor. It is\r\ninteresting to note that this book, whose very title is unfamiliar to us,\r\nwas speedily translated into five different languages. It had an enormous\r\nsale, and ran through fifty editions soon after publication.\r\n\r\nFootnote 169:   Abridged from _Grace Abounding_, Part 3; _Works_ (ed.\r\n1873), p. 71.\r\n\r\nFootnote 170:   For titles and publishers of reference works, see General\r\nBibliography at the end of this book.\r\n\r\nFootnote 171:   Guizot's _History of the Revolution in England_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 172:   Jeremy Collier (1650-1726), a clergyman and author, noted\r\nfor his scholarly _Ecclesiastical History of Great Britain_ (1708-1714) and\r\nhis _Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage_\r\n(1698). The latter was largely instrumental in correcting the low tendency\r\nof the Restoration drama.\r\n\r\nFootnote 173:   The Royal Society, for the investigation and discussion of\r\nscientific questions, was founded in 1662, and soon included practically\r\nall of the literary and scientific men of the age. It encouraged the work\r\nof Isaac Newton, who was one of its members; and its influence for\r\ntruth--at a time when men were still trying to compound the philosopher's\r\nstone, calculating men's actions from the stars, and hanging harmless old\r\nwomen for witches--can hardly be overestimated.\r\n\r\nFootnote 174:   If the reader would see this in concrete form, let him read\r\na paragraph of Milton's prose, or a stanza of his poetry, and compare its\r\nexuberant, melodious diction with Dryden's concise method of writing.\r\n\r\nFootnote 175:   Edmund Waller (1606-1687), the most noted poet of the\r\nRestoration period until his pupil Dryden appeared. His works are now\r\nseldom read.\r\n\r\nFootnote 176:   From _Divine Poems_, \"Old Age and Death.\"\r\n\r\nFootnote 177:   Following the advice of Boileau (1676-1711), a noted French\r\ncritic, whom Voltaire called \"the lawgiver of Parnassus.\"\r\n\r\nFootnote 178:   By a critic we mean simply one who examines the literary\r\nworks of various ages, separates the good from the bad, and gives the\r\nreasons for his classification. It is noticeable that critical writings\r\nincrease in an age, like that of the Restoration, when great creative works\r\nare wanting.\r\n\r\nFootnote 179:   Two other principles of this book should be noted: (1) that\r\nall power originates in the people; and (2) that the object of all\r\ngovernment is the common good. Here evidently is a democratic doctrine,\r\nwhich abolishes the divine right of kings; but Hobbes immediately destroys\r\ndemocracy by another doctrine,--that the power given by the people to the\r\nruler could not be taken away. Hence the Royalists could use the book to\r\njustify the despotism of the Stuarts on the ground that the people had\r\nchosen them. This part of the book is in direct opposition to Milton's\r\n_Defense of the English People_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 180:   Locke's _Treatises on Government_ should also be mentioned,\r\nfor they are of profound interest to American students of history and\r\npolitical science. It was from Locke that the framers of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence and of the Constitution drew many of their ideas, and even\r\nsome of their most striking phrases. \"All men are endowed with certain\r\ninalienable rights\"; \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\"; \"the\r\norigin and basis of government is in the consent of the governed,\"--these\r\nand many more familiar and striking expressions are from Locke. It is\r\ninteresting to note that he was appointed to draft a constitution for the\r\nnew province of Carolina; but his work was rejected,--probably because it\r\nwas too democratic for the age in which he lived.\r\n\r\nFootnote 181:   A few slight changes and omissions from the original text,\r\nas given in Wheatley's edition of Pepys (London, 1892, 9 vols.), are not\r\nindicated in these brief quotations.\r\n\r\nFootnote 182:   The first daily newspaper, _The Daily Courant_, appeared in\r\nLondon in 1702.\r\n\r\nFootnote 183:   See Lecky, _England in the Eighteenth Century_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 184:   Addison's \"Campaign\" (1704), written to celebrate the\r\nbattle of Blenheim.\r\n\r\nFootnote 185:   Great writers in every age, men like Shakespeare and\r\nMilton, make their own style. They are therefore not included in this\r\nsummary. Among the minor writers also there are exceptions to the rule; and\r\nfine feeling is often manifest in the poetry of Donne, Herbert, Vaughan,\r\nand Herrick.\r\n\r\nFootnote 186:   We have endeavored here simply to show the meaning of terms\r\nin general use in our literature; but it must be remembered that it is\r\nimpossible to classify or to give a descriptive name to the writers of any\r\nperiod or century. While \"classic\" or \"pseudo-classic\" may apply to a part\r\nof eighteenth-century literature, every age has both its romantic and its\r\nclassic movements. In this period the revolt against classicism is shown in\r\nthe revival of romantic poetry under Gray, Collins, Burns, and Thomson, and\r\nin the beginning of the English novel under Defoe, Richardson, and\r\nFielding. These poets and novelists, who have little or no connection with\r\nclassicism, belong chronologically to the period we are studying. They are\r\nreserved for special treatment in the sections following.\r\n\r\nFootnote 187:   Pope's satires, for instance, are strongly suggested in\r\nBoileau; his _Rape of the Lock_ is much like the mock-heroic _Le Lutrin;_\r\nand the \"Essay on Criticism,\" which made him famous, is an English edition\r\nand improvement of _L'Art Poétique_. The last was, in turn, a combination\r\nof the _Ars Poetica_ of Horace and of many well-known rules of the\r\nclassicists.\r\n\r\nFootnote 188:   These are the four kinds of spirits inhabiting the four\r\nelements, according to the Rosicrucians,--a fantastic sect of spiritualists\r\nof that age. In the dedication of the poem Pope says he took the idea from\r\na French book called _Le Comte de Gabalis_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 189:   Compare this with Shakespeare's \"All the world's a stage,\"\r\nin _As You Like it_, II, 7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 190:   It is only fair to point out that Swift wrote this and two\r\nother pamphlets on religion at a time when he knew that they would damage,\r\nif not destroy, his own prospects of political advancement.\r\n\r\nFootnote 191:   See Tennyson's \"Merlin and the Gleam.\"\r\n\r\nFootnote 192:   Of the _Tatler_ essays Addison contributed forty-two;\r\nthirty-six others were written in collaboration with Steele; while at least\r\na hundred and eighty are the work of Steele alone.\r\n\r\nFootnote 193:   From \"The Vanity of Human Wishes\"\r\n\r\nFootnote 194:   A very lovable side of Johnson's nature is shown by his\r\ndoing penance in the public market place for his unfilial conduct as a boy.\r\n(See, in Hawthorne's _Our Old Home_, the article on \"Lichfield and\r\nJohnson.\") His sterling manhood is recalled in his famous letter to Lord\r\nChesterfield, refusing the latter's patronage for the _Dictionary_. The\r\nstudent should read this incident entire, in Boswell's _Life of Johnson_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 195:   In Johnson's _Dictionary_ we find this definition:\r\n\"Grub-street, the name of a street in London much inhabited by writers of\r\nsmall histories, _dictionaries_, and temporary poems; whence any mean\r\nproduction is called Grub-street.\"\r\n\r\nFootnote 196:   From Macaulay's review of Boswell's _Life of Johnson_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 197:   Many of the writers show a mingling of the classic and the\r\nromantic tendencies. Thus Goldsmith followed Johnson and opposed the\r\nromanticists; but his _Deserted Village_ is romantic in spirit, though its\r\nclassic couplets are almost as mechanical as Pope's. So Burke's orations\r\nare \"elegantly classic\" in style, but are illumined by bursts of emotion\r\nand romantic feeling.\r\n\r\nFootnote 198:   A much more interesting work is Thomas Paine's _Rights of\r\nMan_, which was written in answer to Burke's essay, and which had enormous\r\ninfluence in England and America.\r\n\r\nFootnote 199:   In the same year, 1775, in which Burke's magnificent\r\n\"Conciliation\" oration was delivered, Patrick Henry made a remarkable\r\nlittle speech before a gathering of delegates in Virginia. Both men were\r\npleading the same cause of justice, and were actuated by the same high\r\nideals. A very interesting contrast, however, may be drawn between the\r\nmethods and the effects of Henry's speech and of Burke's more brilliant\r\noration. Burke makes us wonder at his learning, his brilliancy, his\r\neloquence; but he does not move us to action. Patrick Henry calls us, and\r\nwe spring to follow him. That suggests the essential difference between the\r\ntwo orators.\r\n\r\nFootnote 200:   The romantic revival is marked by renewed interest in\r\nmediæval ideals and literature; and to this interest is due the success of\r\nWalpole's romance, _The Castle of Otranto_, and of Chatterton's forgeries\r\nknown as the _Rowley Papers_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 201:   From _The Task_, Book II.\r\n\r\nFootnote 202:   See, for instance, Phelps, _Beginnings of the Romantic\r\nMovement_, for a list of Spenserian imitators from 1700 to 1775.\r\n\r\nFootnote 203:   Such is Goldsmith's version of a somewhat suspicious\r\nadventure, whose details are unknown.\r\n\r\nFootnote 204:   Goldsmith's idea, which was borrowed from Walpole,\r\nreappears in the pseudo _Letters from a Chinese Official_, which recently\r\nattracted considerable attention.\r\n\r\nFootnote 205:   Fitz-Greene Halleck's poem \"To a Rose from near Alloway\r\nKirk\" (1822) is a good appreciation of Burns and his poetry. It might be\r\nwell to read this poem before the sad story of Burns's life.\r\n\r\nFootnote 206:   Introduction, _Songs of Innocence_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 207:   Swinburne's _William Blake_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 208:   There are several omissions from the text in this fragment\r\nfrom _Fingal_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 209:   Several fragments of Gaelic poetry, attributed to Ossian or\r\nOisin, are now known to have existed at that time in the Highlands.\r\nMacpherson used these as a basis for his epic, but most of the details were\r\nfurnished by his own imagination. The alleged text of \"Ossian\" was\r\npublished in 1807, some eleven years after Macpherson's death. It only\r\nadded another mystery to the forgery; for, while it embodied a few old and\r\nprobably genuine fragments, the bulk of it seems to be Macpherson's work\r\ntranslated back into Gaelic.\r\n\r\nFootnote 210:   For various other collections of songs and ballads,\r\nantedating Percy's, see Phelps's _Beginnings of the English Romantic\r\nMovement_, ch. vii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 211:   The first books to which the term \"novel,\" in the modern\r\nsense, may be applied, appeared almost simultaneously in England, France,\r\nand Germany. The rapid development of the English novel had an immense\r\ninfluence in all European nations.\r\n\r\nFootnote 212:   The name \"romance\" was given at first to any story in one\r\nof the Romance languages, like the French metrical romances, which we have\r\nconsidered. Because these stories were brought to England at a time when\r\nthe childish mind of the Middle Ages delighted in the most impossible\r\nstories, the name \"romance\" was retained to cover any work of the unbridled\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nFootnote 213:   This division of works of fiction into romances and novels\r\nis a somewhat arbitrary one, but it seems, on the whole, the most natural\r\nand the most satisfactory. Many writers use the generic term \"novel\" to\r\ninclude all prose fiction. They divide novels into two classes, stories and\r\nromances; the story being a form of the novel which relates certain\r\nincidents of life with as little complexity as possible; and the romance\r\nbeing a form of novel which describes life as led by strong emotions into\r\ncomplex and unusual circumstances. Novels are otherwise divided into novels\r\nof personality, like _Vicar of Wakefield_ and _Silas Marner_; historical\r\nnovels, _Ivanhoe_; novels of romance, like _Lorna Doone_ and novels of\r\npurpose, like _Oliver Twist_ and _Uncle Tom's Cabin_. All such\r\nclassifications are imperfect, and the best of them is open to objections.\r\n\r\nFootnote 214:   One of these tales was called _The Wonderful Things beyond\r\nThule_. It is the story of a youth, Dinias, who for love of a girl,\r\nDercyllis, did heroic things and undertook many adventures, including a\r\njourney to the frozen north, and another to the moon. A second tale,\r\n_Ephesiaca_, is the story of a man and a maid, each of whom scoffs at love.\r\nThey meet and fall desperately in love; but the course of true love does\r\nnot run smooth, and they separate, and suffer, and go through many perils,\r\nbefore they \"live happily ever after.\" This tale is the source of the\r\nmediæval story, _Apollonius of Tyre_, which is used in Gower's _Confessio\r\nAmantis_ and in Shakespeare's _Pericles_. A third tale is the pastoral love\r\nstory, _Daphnis and Chloe_, which reappeared in many forms in subsequent\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nFootnote 215:   Minto's _Life of Defoe_, p. 139.\r\n\r\nFootnote 216:   These were not what the booksellers expected. They wanted a\r\n\"handy letter writer,\" something like a book of etiquette; and it was\r\npublished in 1741, a few months after _Pamela_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 217:   See p. 315.\r\n\r\nFootnote 218:   For titles and publishers of general reference works, and\r\nof inexpensive texts, see General Bibliography at end of this book.\r\n\r\nFootnote 219:   Mrs. Radcliffe's best work is the _Mysteries of Udolpho_.\r\nThis is the story of a tender heroine shut up in a gloomy castle. Over her\r\nbroods the terrible shadow of an ancestor's crime. There are the usual\r\n\"goose-flesh\" accompaniments of haunted rooms, secret doors, sliding\r\npanels, mysterious figures behind old pictures, and a subterranean passage\r\nleading to a vault, dark and creepy as a tomb. Here the heroine finds a\r\nchest with blood-stained papers. By the light of a flickering candle she\r\nreads, with chills and shivering, the record of long-buried crimes. At the\r\npsychologic moment the little candle suddenly goes out. Then out of the\r\ndarkness a cold, clammy hand--ugh! Foolish as such stories seem to us now,\r\nthey show, first, a wild reaction from the skepticism of the preceding age;\r\nand second, a development of the mediæval romance of adventure; only the\r\nadventure is here inward rather than outward. It faces a ghost instead of a\r\ndragon; and for this work a nun with her beads is better than a knight in\r\narmor. So heroines abound, instead of heroes. The age was too educated for\r\nmedieval monsters and magic, but not educated enough to reject ghosts and\r\nother bogeys.\r\n\r\nFootnote 220:   The _Lyrical Ballads_ were better appreciated in America\r\nthan in England. The first edition was printed here in 1802.\r\n\r\nFootnote 221:   _The Prelude_ was not published till after Wordsworth's\r\ndeath, nearly half a century later.\r\n\r\nFootnote 222:   _The Prelude_, Book IV.\r\n\r\nFootnote 223:   Dowden's _Selections from Wordsworth_ is the best of many\r\nsuch collections. See Selections for Reading, and Bibliography, at the end\r\nof this chapter.\r\n\r\nFootnote 224:   See \"Christ's Hospital Five and Thirty Years Ago,\" in\r\n_Essays of Elia_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 225:   See Scott's criticism of his own work, in comparison with\r\nJane Austen's, p. 439.\r\n\r\nFootnote 226:   Scott's novels were not the first to have an historical\r\nbasis. For thirty years preceding the appearance of _Waverley_, historical\r\nromances were popular; but it was due to Scott's genius that the historical\r\nnovel became a permanent type of literature. See Cross, _The Development of\r\nthe English Novel_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 227:   See Selections for Reading, and Bibliography, at the end of\r\nthis chapter.\r\n\r\nFootnote 228:   Shelley undoubtedly took his idea from a lost drama of\r\nAeschylus, a sequel to _Prometheus Bound_, in which the great friend of\r\nmankind was unchained from a precipice, where he had been placed by the\r\ntyrant Zeus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 229:   This idea is suppported by Shelley's poem _Adonais_, and by\r\nByron's parody against the reviewers, beginning, \"Who killed John Keats? I,\r\nsays the Quarterly.\"\r\n\r\nFootnote 230:   See \"Christ's Hospital Five and Thirty Years Ago,\" in\r\n_Essays of Elia_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 231:   See _Essays of Elia,_ \"The Superannuated Man.\"\r\n\r\nFootnote 232:   In the first essay, \"The South Sea House,\" Lamb assumed as\r\na joke the name of a former clerk, Elia. Other essays followed, and the\r\nname was retained when several successful essays were published in book\r\nform, in 1823. In these essays \"Elia\" is Lamb himself, and \"Cousin Bridget\"\r\nis his sister Mary.\r\n\r\nFootnote 233:   See histories for the Congress of Vienna (1814) and the\r\nHoly Alliance (1815).\r\n\r\nFootnote 234:   For full titles and publishers of general reference books,\r\nsee General Bibliography at end of this book.\r\n\r\nFootnote 235:   An excellent little volume for the beginner is Van Dyke's\r\n\"Poems by Tennyson,\" which shows the entire range of the poet's work from\r\nhis earliest to his latest years. (See Selections for Reading, at the end\r\nof this chapter.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 236:   Tennyson made a distinction in spelling between the _Idylls\r\nof the King_, and the _English Idyls_, like \"Dora.\"\r\n\r\nFootnote 237:   An excellent little book for the beginner is Lovett's\r\n_Selections from Browning_. (See Selections for Reading, at the end of this\r\nchapter.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 238:   This term, which means simply Italian painters before\r\nRaphael, is generally applied to an artistic movement in the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century. The term was first used by a brotherhood of German\r\nartists who worked together in the convent of San Isodoro, in Rome, with\r\nthe idea of restoring art to its mediæval purity and simplicity. The term\r\nnow generally refers to a company of seven young men,--Dante Gabriel\r\nRossetti and his brother William, William Holman Hunt, John Everett\r\nMillais, James Collinson, Frederick George Stevens, and Thomas Woolner,--\r\nwho formed the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood in England in 1848. Their\r\nofficial literary organ was called _The Germ_, in which much of the early\r\nwork of Morris and Rossetti appeared. They took for their models the early\r\nItalian painters who, they declared, were \"simple, sincere, and religious.\"\r\nTheir purpose was to encourage simplicity and naturalness in art and\r\nliterature; and one of their chief objects, in the face of doubt and\r\nmaterialism, was to express the \"wonder, reverence, and awe\" which\r\ncharacterizes mediæval art. In its return to the mysticism and symbolism of\r\nthe mediæval age, this Pre-Raphaelitism suggests the contemporary Oxford or\r\nTractarian movement in religion. (See footnote, p. 554).\r\n\r\nFootnote 239:   Arnold was one of the best known poets of the age, but\r\nbecause he has exerted a deeper influence on our literature as a critic, we\r\nhave reserved him for special study among the essayists. (See p. xxx)\r\n\r\nFootnote 240:   It should be pointed out that the _English Humorists_ is\r\nsomewhat too highly colored to be strictly accurate. In certain cases also,\r\nnotably that of Steele, the reader may well object to Thackeray's\r\npatronizing attitude toward his subject.\r\n\r\nFootnote 241:   See pp. 260-261.\r\n\r\nFootnote 242:   Emily Brontë (1818-1848) was only a little less gifted than\r\nher famous sister. Her best known work is _Wuthering Heights_ (1847), a\r\nstrong but morbid novel of love and suffering. Matthew Arnold said of her\r\nthat, \"for the portrayal of passion, vehemence, and grief,\" Emily Brontë\r\nhad no equal save Byron. An exquisite picture of Emily is given in\r\nCharlotte Brontë's novel _Shirley_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 243:   _Essays_, Riverside edition, I, 318.\r\n\r\nFootnote 244:   The student should remember that Carlyle's literary\r\nopinions, though very positive, are to be received with caution. Sometimes,\r\nindeed, they are so one-sided and prejudiced that they are more valuable as\r\na revelation of Carlyle himself than as a study of the author he is\r\nconsidering.\r\n\r\nFootnote 245:   The Oxford movement in religion has many points of\r\nresemblance to the Pre-Raphaelite movement in art. Both protested against\r\nthe materialism of the age, and both went back for their models to the\r\nMiddle Ages. Originally the movement was intended to bring new life to the\r\nAnglican church by a revival of the doctrine and practices of an earlier\r\nperiod. Recognizing the power of the press, the leaders chose literature\r\nfor their instrument of reform, and by their _Tracts for the Times_ they\r\nbecame known as Tractarians. To oppose liberalism and to restore the\r\ndoctrine and authority of the early Church was the center of their\r\nteaching. Their belief might be summed up in one great article of the\r\nCreed, with all that it implies,--\"I believe in one Catholic and Apostolic\r\nChurch.\" The movement began at Oxford with Keble's famous sermon on\r\n\"National Apostasy,\" in 1833; but Newman was the real leader of the\r\nmovement, which practically ended when he entered the Catholic church in\r\n1845.",
