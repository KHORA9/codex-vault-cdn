During the first four months of this\r\nassignment, I was engaged in field work which included the recovery of\r\nlooted works of art from such out-of-the-way places as a monastery in\r\nCzechoslovakia, a salt mine in Austria, and a castle in Bavaria. Later,\r\nas Deputy Chief of the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Section, Office\r\nof Military Government, U. S. Zone, I participated in the restitution of\r\nrecovered art treasures to the countries of rightful ownership.\r\n\r\nThis book is primarily an account of my own experiences in connection\r\nwith these absorbing tasks; but I have also chronicled the activities of\r\na number of my fellow officers, hoping thereby to provide the reader with\r\na more comprehensive estimate of the work as a whole than the _resumé_ of\r\nmy own duties could have afforded.\r\n\r\nFor many helpful suggestions, I am indebted to Captain Edith A. Standen,\r\nLieutenant Lamont Moore and Mr. David Bramble; and for invaluable\r\nphotographic material, I am particularly grateful to Captain Stephen\r\nKovalyak, Captain P. J. Kelleher, Captain Edward E. Adams and Lieutenant\r\nCraig Smyth, USNR.\r\n\r\nFor permission to reproduce three _International News Service_\r\nphotographs, I wish to thank Mr. Clarence Lindner of the San Francisco\r\n_Examiner_.\r\n\r\n                                                    THOMAS CARR HOWE, JR.\r\n\r\n    San Francisco\r\n    July 1946.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER                                              PAGE\r\n\r\n     1 PARIS—LONDON—VERSAILLES                           13\r\n\r\n     2 ASSIGNED TO FRANKFURT                             35\r\n\r\n     3 MUNICH AND THE BEGINNING OF FIELD WORK            54\r\n\r\n     4 MASTERPIECES IN A MONASTERY                       80\r\n\r\n     5 SECOND TRIP TO HOHENFURTH                        104\r\n\r\n     6 LOOT UNDERGROUND: THE SALT MINE AT ALT AUSSEE    130\r\n\r\n     7 THE ROTHSCHILD JEWELS; THE GÖRING COLLECTION     171\r\n\r\n     8 LOOTERS’ CASTLE: SCHLOSS NEUSCHWANSTEIN          219\r\n\r\n     9 HIDDEN TREASURES AT NÜRNBERG                     243\r\n\r\n    10 MISSION TO AMSTERDAM; THE WIESBADEN MANIFESTO    259\r\n\r\n       APPENDIX                                         297\r\n\r\n       INDEX                                            321\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Special Evacuation Team.

It wasn’t on her list.\r\n\r\n“Let’s see what they know about this at the main office,” she said with\r\nan encouraging smile as she dialed Naval Air Transport in Washington.\r\nThe next ten minutes were grim. The officer at the other end of the\r\nline wanted to know with whom I had checked. Had it been someone in his\r\noffice? I didn’t know. All I knew was that I had to get on that plane.\r\nI had important papers which had to be delivered to our Paris office\r\nwithout delay. Was I a courier? Yes, I was—well, that is, almost, I\r\nfaltered to the WAVE ensign who had been transmitting my replies. “Here,\r\nyou talk to him,” she said, adding, as she handed me the receiver, “I\r\nthink he can fix it up.”\r\n\r\nAfter going through the same questions and getting the same answers a\r\nsecond time, the officer in Washington asked to speak to the yeoman who\r\nwas supervising the loading of the plane. He was called in and I waited\r\non tenterhooks until I heard him say, “Yes, sir, I can make room for the\r\nlieutenant and his gear.” Turning the phone over to the WAVE, he asked\r\nwith a reassuring grin, “Feel better, Lieutenant?”\r\n\r\nI was so limp with relief that I scarcely noticed the tall spare man in\r\ncivilian clothes who had just come up to the counter. “That’s Lindbergh,”\r\nsaid Craig in a low voice. “Do you suppose he’s going over too?”\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later we trooped out across the faintly lighted field to\r\nthe C-54 which stood waiting. Lindbergh, dressed now in the olive-drab\r\nuniform of a Naval Technician, preceded us up the steps. There were ten\r\nof us in all. With the exception of three leather-cushioned chairs, there\r\nwere only bucket seats. Craig and I settled ourselves in two of these\r\nuninviting hollows and began fumbling clumsily with the seat belts.\r\nSeeing that we were having trouble, Lindbergh came over and with a\r\nfriendly smile asked if he could give us a hand. After deftly adjusting\r\nour belts, he returned to one of the cushioned seats across the way.\r\n\r\nDoors slammed, the engines began to roar and, a few seconds later, we\r\nwere off. We mounted swiftly into the star-filled sky and, peering\r\nout, watched the dark Maryland hills drop away. We dozed despite the\r\ndiscomfort of our bent-over positions and didn’t come to again until\r\nthe steward roused us several hours later with coffee and sandwiches.\r\nAfterward he brought out army cots and motioned to us to set them up if\r\nwe wanted to stretch out. As soon as we got the cots unfolded and the\r\npegs set in place, he turned out the lights.\r\n\r\nCraig was dead to the world in a few minutes but I couldn’t get back to\r\nsleep. To the accompaniment of the humming motors, the events of the past\r\nweeks began to pass in review: that quiet April afternoon at Western Sea\r\nFrontier Headquarters in San Francisco when my overseas orders had come\r\nthrough—those orders I had been waiting for so long, more than a year. It\r\nwas in March of 1944 that I first learned there was a chance of getting\r\na European assignment, to join the group of officers working with our\r\narmies in the “protection and salvaging of artistic monuments in war\r\nareas.” That was the cumbersome way it was described. The President had\r\nappointed a commission with a long name, but it came to be known simply\r\nas the Roberts Commission. Justice Roberts of the Supreme Court was the\r\nhead of it. It was the first time in history that a country had taken\r\nsuch precautions to safeguard cultural monuments lying in the paths of\r\nits invading armies.\r\n\r\nIt was the commission’s job to recommend to the War Department servicemen\r\nwhose professional qualifications fitted them for this work. I had\r\nbeen in the Navy for two years. Before that I had been director of the\r\nCalifornia Palace of the Legion of Honor, one of San Francisco’s two\r\nmunicipal museums of the fine arts. The commission had recommended me,\r\nbut it was up to me to obtain my own release. I had been in luck on that\r\nscore. My commanding officer had agreed to let me go. And more important,\r\nmy wife had too. Only Francesca had wanted to know why Americans should\r\nbe meddling with Europe’s art treasures. Weren’t there enough museum\r\ndirectors over there to take care of things? Of course there were in\r\nnormal times. But now they needed men in uniform—to go in with the armies.\r\n\r\nAnd after all that planning nothing had happened, until three weeks ago.\r\nThen everything had happened at once. The orders directed me to report to\r\nSHAEF for duty with the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Section, G-5,\r\nand additional duty with the Allied Control Council for Germany.\r\n\r\nThe papers had been full of stories about German salt mines—the big one\r\nat Merkers where our troops had found the Nazi gold and the treasures\r\nfrom the Berlin museums. I was going to Germany. Would I find anything\r\nlike that?\r\n\r\nI had flown to Washington to receive last-minute instructions. I was\r\nto make the trip across by air and was given an extra allowance of\r\ntwenty-five pounds to enable me to take along a dozen Baedekers and a\r\nquantity of photographic paper for distribution among our officers in the\r\nfield. I had been introduced to Craig Smyth while in the midst of these\r\nfinal preparations. Like me, he was a naval lieutenant and his orders\r\nwere identical with mine. He was a grave young Princetonian, formerly on\r\nthe staff of the National Gallery of Art in Washington.\r\n\r\nIt was raining when we reached Stevensville, Newfoundland, early the\r\nnext morning. After an hour’s stop we were on our way again. Shortly\r\nbefore noon we struck good weather and all day long sea and sky remained\r\nunvaryingly blue. Late in the afternoon we landed on the island of\r\nTerceira in the Azores. We had set our watches ahead two hours at\r\nStevensville. Now we set them ahead again. We took off promptly at seven.\r\nThis was the last lap of the journey—we’d be in Paris in the morning.\r\nPresently our fellow passengers settled down for the night. Two of the\r\ncushioned chairs were empty, so Craig and I took possession. They were\r\nmore comfortable than the cots, and as soon as the steward turned out the\r\nlights I dropped off to sleep.\r\n\r\nIt was still dark when I awoke hours later, but there was enough light\r\nfor me to distinguish two black masses of land rising from the sea. On\r\none, the beacon of a lighthouse revolved with monotonous regularity. We\r\nhad just passed over two of the Channel Islands. The dawn came rapidly\r\nand a pink light edged the eastern horizon. It was not long before we\r\nsighted the coast of France. We flew into rosy clouds and, as they\r\nbillowed about the plane, we caught tantalizing glimpses of the shore\r\nline below. The steward pointed out one promontory and told us it was\r\nBrest. Soon we had a spectacular view of Mont St. Michel and the long\r\ncauseway over which I had driven years before on a sketching tour in\r\nNormandy. I wondered what had become of Mère Poulard and her wonderful\r\nomelettes and lobster. Some people said they had brought more visitors to\r\nMont St. Michel than the architecture. Very likely she was dead and the\r\nGermans had probably disposed of her fabulous cuisine.\r\n\r\nWe had lost two more hours in the course of the night, so it was only\r\nseven-thirty when we swooped down at Orly field, half an hour from\r\nParis. It was a beautiful morning and the sun was so bright that it\r\ntook us a few minutes to get accustomed to the glare. As we walked over\r\nto the airport office, we had our first glimpse of war damage at close\r\nrange—bombed-out hangars and, scattered about the field, the wreckage\r\nof German planes. But the airport was being repaired rapidly. Trim new\r\noffices had been built and additional barracks were nearing completion.\r\nCraig and I booked places on the afternoon plane for London and then\r\nclimbed onto the bus waiting to take us into Paris.\r\n\r\nThanks to various delays in getting out of Washington, we had missed\r\nthe Paris celebration of VE-Day by a margin of three days. So we were\r\nabout to see the wonderful old city at the beginning of a period of\r\nreadjustment. But a peaceful Sunday morning is no time to judge any\r\ncity—least of all Paris. Everything looked the same. The arcades along\r\nthe right side of the Rue de Rivoli and the gardens at the left were\r\nempty, as one would expect them to be. We turned into the Rue Castiglione\r\nand came to a halt by the column in the Place Vendôme.\r\n\r\nAfter we had checked our bags at the ATC office, we walked over to the\r\nRed Cross Club on the Place de la Concorde. We shaved, washed and then\r\nhad doughnuts and coffee in the canteen.\r\n\r\nOur next move was to call Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Webb, the British\r\nofficer who was head of the MFA&A Section at SHAEF headquarters in\r\nVersailles. Before the war, Colonel Webb had been Slade Professor of\r\nArt at Cambridge. I explained to him that Smyth and I had arrived but\r\nthat our orders directed us to report first to Naval Headquarters in\r\nLondon—ComNavEu—and that as soon as we had complied with them we would\r\nbe back. That was all right with the colonel. He said that Lieutenant\r\nKuhn, USNR, his deputy, was away on a three-day field trip and wouldn’t\r\nbe returning before the middle of the week. And we were primarily Charlie\r\nKuhn’s problem.\r\n\r\nWith that formality out of the way, we retrieved our luggage and\r\nwheedled the ATC into giving us transportation to the Royal Monceau,\r\nthe Navy hotel out near the Étoile. It was time to relax and luxuriate\r\nin the thought that it was May and that we were in Paris—that climatic\r\nand geographic combination so long a favorite theme of song-writers. I\r\nthought about this as we drove along the Champs Élysées. The song writers\r\nhad something, all right—Paris in May was a wonderful sight. But they\r\nhad been mooning about a gala capital filled with carefree people, and\r\nthe Paris of May 1945 wasn’t like that. Architecturally, the city was\r\nas elegant as ever, but the few people one saw along the streets looked\r\nanything but carefree. And there were no taxis. Taxis have always seemed\r\nto me as much a part of Paris as the buildings themselves. In spite of a\r\nsuperficial sameness, Paris had an air of empty magnificence that made\r\none think of a beautiful woman struck dumb by shock. I wondered if my\r\nthoughts were running away with me, but found that Craig’s impressions\r\nwere much the same.\r\n\r\nThese musings were cut short by our arrival at the hotel. The Navy had\r\ndone all right for itself. The same efficient French staff that had\r\npresided over this de luxe establishment in prewar days was still in\r\ncharge. I left the Baedekers and photographic paper for Charlie Kuhn, and\r\nthen Craig and I walked to Naval Headquarters in the Rue Presbourg. There\r\nwe attended to routine matters in connection with our orders. It was\r\nalmost noon by the time we got squared away, so we retraced our steps to\r\nthe Monceau. Lunch there was a demonstration of what a French chef could\r\ndo with GI food.\r\n\r\nMidafternoon found us headed back to Orly in a Navy jeep. Our plane was\r\nscheduled to leave at four. This was no bucket-seat job, but a luxurious\r\nC-47 equipped with chairs of the Pullman-car variety, complete with\r\nantimacassars. We landed at Bovingdon less than two hours later and\r\nfrom there took a bus up to London. Naval Headquarters was in Grosvenor\r\nSquare. With the American Embassy on one side of it, the Navy on another,\r\nand the park in the center used by the Navy motor pool, the dignified old\r\nsquare was pretty thoroughly Americanized.\r\n\r\nLondon was still crowded with our armed forces. The hotels were full, so\r\nwe were assigned to lodgings in Wimpole Street. These were on the third\r\nfloor of a pleasant, eighteenth century house, within a stone’s throw\r\nof No. 50, where Elizabeth Barrett had been wooed and won by Robert\r\nBrowning. An inspection of our quarters revealed that the plumbing was\r\nof the Barrett-Browning period; but the place was clean and, anyway, it\r\nwasn’t likely that we’d be spending much time there. It had been a long\r\nday and we were too tired to think of anything beyond getting a bite to\r\neat and hitting the sack.\r\n\r\nFor our two days in London we had “Queen’s weather”—brilliant sunshine\r\nand cloudless skies. Our first port of call early the next morning\r\nwas the Medical Office, where we were given various inoculations. From\r\nthere Craig and I went across the square to the American Embassy for\r\na long session with Sumner Crosby, at that time acting as the liaison\r\nbetween the Roberts Commission and its British counterpart, the Macmillan\r\nCommittee. Sumner provided us with a great deal of useful information.\r\nThe latest reports from Germany indicated that caches of looted art\r\nwere being uncovered from day to day. The number of these hiding places\r\nran into the hundreds. The value of their contents was, of course,\r\nincalculable. Only a fraction of the finds had as yet been released to\r\nthe press.\r\n\r\nCraig and I began licking our chops at the prospect of what lay ahead.\r\nHad we made a mistake in planning to stay two days in London? Perhaps\r\nwe could get a plane back to Paris that evening. Sumner thought not.\r\nThere were several things for us to do on the spot, things that would be\r\nof use to us in our future activities. One was to call on Colonel Sir\r\nLeonard Woolley, the British archaeologist who, with his wife, was doing\r\nimportant work for the Macmillan Committee. Another was to see Jim Plaut,\r\na naval lieutenant at the London office of OSS. He would probably have\r\nvaluable information about German museum personnel. It would be helpful\r\nto know the whereabouts of certain German scholars, specifically those\r\nwhose records were, from our point of view, “clean.”\r\n\r\nSumner made several appointments for us and then hurried off to keep one\r\nof his own. Craig and I stayed on at the office to study the reports.\r\nSumner had already given us the glittering highlights. By noon our heads\r\nwere filled with facts and figures that made E. Phillips Oppenheim seem\r\npositively unimaginative. And _The Arabian Nights_—that was just old\r\nstuff.\r\n\r\nIt was late afternoon when we finished calling on the various people\r\nSumner had advised us to see, but plenty of time remained to do a little\r\nsightseeing before dinner. The cabbie took us past Buckingham Palace,\r\nalong the Embankment, Birdcage Walk, the Abbey, the Houses of Parliament\r\nand finally to St. Paul’s. What we saw was enough to give a cruel picture\r\nof the damage the Germans had inflicted on the fine old monuments of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nCraig and I flew back to Orly the following evening, arriving too late\r\nto obtain transportation into Paris. We spent an uncomfortable night in\r\nthe barracks at the airport and drove to the Royal Monceau early the\r\nnext morning. It was stiflingly hot and I was in a bad humor in spite of\r\nthe soothing effect of a short haircut—the kind Francesca said needed a\r\ncouple of saber scars to make it look right. My spirits fell still lower\r\nwhen Craig and I were told that we could stay only two nights at the\r\nhotel. Since we were assigned to SHAEF, it was up to the Army to billet\r\nus. It seemed rather unfriendly of the Navy, but that’s the way it was\r\nand there wasn’t anything we could do about it.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch we set out for Versailles in a Navy jeep. It was a glorious\r\nday despite the heat, and the lovely drive through the Bois and on\r\npast Longchamps made us forget our irritation at the Navy’s lack of\r\nhospitality. The office of the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Section\r\nwas in two tiny “between-floor” rooms in the Grandes Écuries—the big\r\nstables which, together with their matching twin, the Petites Écuries,\r\nface the main palace.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived Colonel Webb was deep in conference with a lady war\r\ncorrespondent. The tall, rangy colonel, who reminded me of a humorous\r\nand grizzled giraffe, came out to welcome Craig and me. His cordiality\r\nwas overwhelming at first, but we soon learned the reason. Miss Bonney,\r\nthe correspondent, was giving the colonel a bad time and he needed moral\r\nsupport. She was firing a rapid barrage of searching questions, and in\r\nsome cases the colonel didn’t want to answer. I was fascinated by his\r\ntechnique. He obviously didn’t wish to offend his inquisitor, but on the\r\nother hand he wasn’t going to be pressed for an expression of opinion\r\non certain subjects. At times he would parry her query with one of his\r\nown. At others he would snort some vague reply which got lost in a\r\nhearty laugh. Before the interview was over, it was Miss Bonney who was\r\nanswering the questions—often her own—not the colonel.\r\n\r\nNeither Craig nor I could make much of what we heard, but after Miss\r\nBonney’s departure the colonel took us into his confidence. Somewhere\r\nthis indomitable lady had got hold of stray bits of information which,\r\nproperly pieced together, made one of the most absorbing stories of the\r\nwar, as far as Nazi looting of art treasures was concerned. The time was\r\nnot yet ripe to break the story, according to the colonel, so it had been\r\nup to him to avoid giving answers which would have filled in the missing\r\npieces of the puzzle.\r\n\r\nThen the colonel proceeded to tell us about the _Einsatzstab Rosenberg_,\r\nthe infamous “task force”—to translate the word literally—organized\r\nunder the direction of Alfred Rosenberg, the “ideological and spiritual\r\nleader” of the Reich, for the methodical plundering of the great Jewish\r\ncollections and the accumulated artistic wealth of other recognized\r\n“enemies of the state.” Rosenberg was officially responsible for cultural\r\ntreasures confiscated in the occupied countries. He had virtually\r\nunlimited resources at his command. In the fall of 1940, not long after\r\nhis appointment, Rosenberg received a congratulatory letter from Göring\r\nin which the Reichsmarschall promised to support energetically the work\r\nof his staff and to place at its disposal “means of transportation and\r\nguard personnel,” and specifically assured him the “utmost assistance”\r\nof the Luftwaffe. Even before the war, German agents had accumulated\r\nexhaustive information concerning collections which were later to be\r\nconfiscated. The whereabouts of every object of artistic importance was\r\nknown. Paintings, sculpture, tapestries, furniture, porcelain, enamels,\r\njewels, gold and silver—all were a matter of record. When the Nazis\r\noccupied Paris, the Rosenberg Task Force was able to go into operation\r\nwith clocklike precision. And so accurate was their information that\r\nin many instances they even knew the hiding places in which their more\r\nforesighted victims had concealed their valuables.\r\n\r\nThe headquarters of the E.R.R.[1] had been set up in the Musée du Jeu\r\nde Paume, the little museum in the corner of the Tuileries Gardens\r\noverlooking the Place de la Concorde. The large staff was composed mainly\r\nof Germans, but some of the members were French. Looted treasures poured\r\ninto the building, to be checked, labeled and shipped off to Germany.\r\nBut it was more than a clearing house. The choicest things were placed\r\non exhibition and to these displays the top-flight Nazis were invited—to\r\nselect whatever caught their fancy. Hitler had first choice, Göring\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nIt did not occur to the members of the E.R.R. staff that their every move\r\nwas watched. A courageous Frenchwoman named Rose Valland had ingratiated\r\nherself with the “right people” and had become a trusted member of the\r\nstaff. During the months she worked at the museum, she had two main\r\nobjectives. One was to sabotage the daily work as much as possible by\r\nmaking intentionally stupid mistakes and by encouraging the French\r\nlaborers, engaged by the Germans, to do likewise. The other, and far and\r\naway the more important, was the compilation of a file, complete with\r\nbiographical data and photographs, of the German personnel at the Jeu\r\nde Paume. How she ever accomplished this is a mystery. The colonel said\r\nthat Mlle. Valland, now a captain in the French Army, was working with\r\nthe official French committee for Fine Arts. She had already provided\r\nour Versailles office with a copy of her E.R.R. file. Later in the\r\nsummer I met Captain Valland, a robust woman with gray hair and the most\r\npenetrating brown eyes I have ever seen. I asked her how she had ever\r\nhad the courage to do what she had done. She said with a laugh, “I could\r\nnever do it again. The Gestapo followed me home every night.”\r\n\r\nAfter regaling us with this account of the E.R.R., Colonel Webb whetted\r\nour appetites still further with an outline of what his deputy, Charlie\r\nKuhn, was up to. As the result of a “signal,” he had taken off by plane\r\nfor Germany, and at the moment was either in the eastern part of Bavaria\r\nor over the Austrian border, trying to trace two truckloads of paintings\r\nand tapestries which two high-ranking Nazis had spirited away from the\r\nLaufen salt mine at the eleventh hour. Latest information indicated\r\nthat the finest things from the Vienna Museum had been stored at\r\nLaufen, which was in the mountains east of Salzburg; and it was further\r\nbelieved that the “top cream” of the stuff—the Breughels, Titians and\r\nVelásquezes—was in those two trucks. These pictures were world-famous\r\nand consequently not marketable, so there was the appalling possibility\r\nthat the highjackers had carried them off with the idea of destroying\r\nthem—Hitler’s mad Götterdämmerung idea. There was also the possibility\r\nthat they intended to hold the pictures as a bribe against their own\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nBack at the hotel that night, Craig and I reviewed the events of the day.\r\nWhat we had learned from Colonel Webb was only an affirmation of the\r\nexciting things we had gleaned from the reports in the London office.\r\nWe were desperately anxious to get into Germany where we could be a\r\npart of all these unbelievable adventures instead of hearing about them\r\nsecondhand. Strict censorship was still in force, so we weren’t able to\r\nshare our exuberance with our respective families in letters home. But we\r\ncould at least exult together over the fantastic future shaping up before\r\nus.\r\n\r\nWe found Charlie Kuhn at the office the next morning. He was a tall\r\nquiet fellow with a keen sense of humor, whom I had first known when\r\nwe had been fellow students at Harvard back in the twenties. During\r\nthe intervening years we had met only at infrequent intervals. He had\r\nremained to teach and had become an outstanding member of the Fine Arts\r\nfaculty in Cambridge, while I had gone to a museum. His special field\r\nof scholarship was German painting and it was this attribute which had\r\nled the Roberts Commission to nominate him for his present assignment as\r\nDeputy Chief of the MFA&A Section. He had already been in the Navy for\r\ntwo years when this billet was offered him. Notwithstanding his obvious\r\nqualifications for his present job, he had so distinguished himself in\r\nthe earlier work upon which he had been engaged—special interrogation\r\nof German prisoners—that it had required White House intervention to\r\n“liberate” him for his new duties. No closeted scholar, Charlie chafed\r\nunder the irritations of administrative and personnel problems which\r\noccupied most of his time.\r\n\r\nThat morning at Versailles he was fresh from his adventures in the field,\r\nand we buttonholed him for a firsthand account. Yes, the trucks had been\r\nlocated. They had been abandoned by the roadside, but everything had\r\nbeen found intact. The reports had not been exaggerated: the trucks had\r\ncontained some of the finest of the Vienna pictures and also some of\r\nthe best tapestries. They were now in a warehouse at Salzburg and would\r\nprobably remain there until they could be returned to Vienna. As to\r\ntheir condition, the pictures were all right; the tapestries had mildewed\r\na bit, but the damage wasn’t serious.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to settle down to the humdrum of office routine after his\r\nrecital of these adventures. Charlie said he wanted to ship us off to\r\nGermany as soon as possible because there was so much to be done and so\r\nfew officers were available.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that we weren’t destined for nearly so swift an invasion of\r\nGermany as we had hoped. Later that afternoon Charlie received a letter\r\nfrom the Medical Officer at Naval Headquarters in Paris informing him\r\nthat Lieutenants Howe and Smyth had not completed their course of typhus\r\nshots, and that he would not recommend their being sent into Germany\r\nuntil thirty days after the second and final shot. Charlie wanted to know\r\nwhat this was all about, and we had to admit that we had not been given\r\ntyphus injections before leaving the States, and had only received the\r\nfirst one in London. After deliberating about it most of the following\r\nmorning, Colonel Webb and Charlie decided that, if we were willing to\r\ntake the chance, they’d cut the waiting period to ten days. We were only\r\ntoo willing.\r\n\r\nCraig and I made good use of the waiting period. We were put to work on\r\nthe reports submitted at regular intervals by our officers in the field.\r\nThese reports contained information concerning art repositories. It was\r\nour job to keep the card file on them up to date; to make a card for each\r\nnew one; to sort out and place in a separate file those which had become\r\nobsolete; to check duplications. Each card bore the name of the place, a\r\nbrief description of the contents, and a map reference consisting of two\r\nco-ordinates. In Germany there was much duplication in the names of small\r\ntowns and villages, so these map references were of great importance.\r\n\r\nThere was also a file on outstanding works of art which were known to\r\nhave been carried off by the Germans or hidden away for safekeeping, but\r\nthe whereabouts of which were as yet unknown—such things, for example, as\r\nthe crown jewels of the Holy Roman Empire, the Michelangelo _Madonna and\r\nChild_ from Bruges, the Ghent altarpiece, the treasure from the Cathedral\r\nof Metz, the stained glass from Strasbourg Cathedral, and the Veit Stoss\r\naltarpiece. The list read like an Almanach de Gotha of the art world.\r\n\r\nSo far as our creature comforts were concerned, they suffered a great\r\ndecline when we moved out to Versailles. Our lodging there was a barren,\r\nfour-story house at No. 1 Rue Berthier. Craig had a room on the ground\r\nfloor, while I shared one under the eaves with Charlie Kuhn. Judging from\r\nthe signs still tacked up in various parts of the house, it had been\r\nused as a German billet during the occupation; and judging by its meager\r\ncomforts, only the humblest ranks had been quartered there. No spruce\r\nPrussian would have put up with such austerity. A couple of British\r\nsoldiers also were living there. They were batmen for two officers\r\nquartered in a near-by hotel and, for a hundred francs a week, they\r\nagreed to do for us as well. They brought us hot water in the morning,\r\npolished our shoes each day and pressed our uniforms.\r\n\r\nOutwardly our life was rather magnificent, for we usually had our meals\r\nat the Trianon Palace Hotel just inside the park grounds. It was a\r\npleasant walk from the Rue Berthier, and an even pleasanter one from\r\nthe office, involving a short cut behind the main palace and across the\r\nlovely gardens. On the whole the gardens had been well kept up and a\r\nstroll about the terraces or through the long _allées_ was something to\r\nlook forward to when the weather was fine. Craig and I got into the habit\r\nof retiring to a quiet corner of the gardens after work with our German\r\nbooks. There we would quiz each other for an hour or two a day. We made\r\noccasional trips into Paris but, more often than not, we followed a\r\nroutine in which the bright lights—what few there were—played little part.\r\n\r\nAt the end of our ten-day “incubation” period, Charlie gave us our\r\ninstructions. We were to go to Frankfurt by air and from there to Bad\r\nHomburg by car. At Bad Homburg we were to report to ECAD headquarters,\r\nthat is, the European Civil Affairs Division, where we would be issued\r\nfurther orders. As members of a pool of officers attached to ECAD, we\r\ncould be shifted about from one part of Germany to another.\r\n\r\nCharlie told us that he and Colonel Webb would be moving to Frankfurt in\r\na few days as SHAEF Headquarters was soon to be set up there. The MFA&A\r\noffice would continue to function with a joint British and American\r\nstaff until the dissolution of SHAEF later in the summer. But that would\r\nnot take place, he said, until the four zones of occupation had been\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nWe left for the airport at six-thirty in the morning. Our French driver\r\nasked us which airport we wanted. Craig and I looked at each other in\r\nsurprise. What field was there besides Orly? The answer was Villacoublay.\r\nWe had never heard of it, so we said Orly. We couldn’t have been more\r\nwrong. When we finally reached Villacoublay we found great confusion. We\r\ncouldn’t even find out whether our plane had taken off.\r\n\r\nAfter making three attempts to get a coherent answer from the second\r\nlieutenant who appeared to be quietly going mad behind the information\r\ncounter, I gave up.\r\n\r\n“This is where you take over, Craig,” I said. I had suddenly developed an\r\nevil headache and had lost all interest in going any place. I walked over\r\nto my luggage, which I had dumped in front of the building, and plunked\r\nmyself down on top of it, put on dark glasses and went to sleep. An hour\r\nlater, Craig shook me.\r\n\r\n“Come on,” he said. “I’ve found a B-17 that’s going to Frankfurt.” We\r\npiled our gear onto a truck and rumbled out over the bumpy field for a\r\ndistance of half a mile. One of the B-17’s crew was sitting unconcernedly\r\nin the grass.\r\n\r\n“We’d like to go to Frankfurt,” said Craig.\r\n\r\n“Okay,” he said, “we’ll be going along pretty soon.” He was\r\ndisconcertingly casual. But the trip wasn’t. We ran into heavy fog\r\nand got lost, so it took us nearly three hours to make the run which\r\nshouldn’t have taken more than two.\r\n\r\nWe finally landed in a green meadow near Hanau. Craig said he’d look for\r\ntransportation if I’d stand guard over our luggage. It was an agreeable\r\nassignment. The day was warm, the meadow soft and inviting. I took out my\r\nGerman book and a chocolate bar, curled up in the grass and hoped he’d be\r\ngone a long time.\r\n\r\nCraig came back an hour and a half later with a jeep. We were about\r\ntwenty miles outside Frankfurt. On the way in the driver said that the\r\ncity had been eighty percent destroyed. He hadn’t exaggerated. As we\r\nturned into the Mainzer Landstrasse, we saw nothing but gutted buildings\r\non either side. We continued up the Taunus Anlage and I recognized the\r\nOpera House ahead. At first I thought it was undamaged. Then I saw\r\nthat the roof was gone, and only the outer walls remained. Most of the\r\nbuildings were like that. This was just the shell of a city.\r\n\r\nOur first stop was SHAEF headquarters, newly established in the vast I.\r\nG. Farben building which, either by accident or design, was completely\r\nundamaged. There we got another car to take us to Bad Homburg.\r\n\r\nThe little resort town where the fashionable world of Edward VII’s day\r\nhad gone to drink the waters and enjoy the mineral baths consisted\r\nmostly of hotels. Some of them were occupied by our troops. Others were\r\nbeing used as hospitals for wounded German soldiers. The big Kurhaus\r\nhad received a direct hit, but the rest of the buildings appeared to be\r\nundamaged.\r\n\r\nAt ECAD headquarters we were assigned a billet in the Grand Hotel Parc.\r\nThat sounded pretty snappy to us—another Royal Monceau, maybe. The\r\nbilleting officer must have guessed our thoughts, because he shook his\r\nhead glumly and said, “’Tain’t anything special. Don’t get your hopes up.”\r\n\r\nIt was nice of him to have prepared us for the rat hole which was the\r\nGrand Hotel Parc. This shabby structure, built around three sides of\r\na narrow courtyard, had an air of vanished refinement about it, but\r\nit could hardly have rated a star in Baedeker. Yet it must have had a\r\ncertain cachet fifty years ago, for in the entrance hallway hung a white\r\nmarble plaque. Its dim gold letters told us that Bismarck’s widow had\r\nspent her declining years “in peaceful happiness beneath this hospitable\r\nroof.”\r\n\r\nOur room was on the fourth floor. The stairs, reminiscent of a\r\nlighthouse, might have been designed for a mountain goat. We thought we\r\nhad struck the ultimate in drabness at the Rue Berthier, but this was\r\nworse. The room itself was worthy of its approach. When I opened the\r\nbig wardrobe I half expected a body to fall out. Two sofas masquerading\r\nas beds occupied corners by the window. The window gave onto the dingy\r\ncourtyard. We silently made up our beds with Army blankets and sprinkled\r\nthem lavishly with DDT powder.\r\n\r\n“Do you suppose there’s such a thing as a bathroom?” Craig asked.\r\n\r\n“I’d sooner expect to find one in an igloo,” I said. “Maybe there’s a\r\npump or a trough somewhere out in back. Why don’t you go and see?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Residenz at Würzburg. The palace of the Prince-Bishops\r\nwas gutted by fire in March 1945.

Only the\r\ntower and the walls of the nave remain standing. _International News\r\nPhoto_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Central Collecting Point at Munich, formerly the\r\nAdministration Building of the Nazi Party. The director of the Central\r\nCollecting Point was Lieutenant Craig Smyth, USNR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A typical storage room in the Central Collecting Point at\r\nMunich. The racks for pictures were built by civilian carpenters under\r\nthe direction of American Monuments officers.]\r\n\r\nWhen he returned fifteen minutes later he was in high spirits. “There’s\r\na bathroom all right and it’s got hot water,” he said, “but you have to\r\nbe a combination of Theseus and Daniel Boone to find it. Come along, I’ll\r\nshow you the way.”\r\n\r\nIt was clever of him to find it a second time. I took a piece of red\r\ncrayon with me and marked little arrows on the walls to show which turns\r\nto make. They were a timesaver to us during the next couple days.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast the next morning, we telephoned 12th Army Group\r\nHeadquarters in Wiesbaden and talked with Lieutenant George Stout, USNR,\r\nwho, with Captain Bancel La Farge, was in charge of the advance office\r\nof MFA&A in Germany. Stout suggested that we come on over. It was a\r\npleasant drive along the Autobahn, with the blue Taunus mountains in the\r\ndistance. Parts of Wiesbaden had been badly mauled, but the destruction\r\nwas negligible compared with Frankfurt. Although many buildings along the\r\nmain streets had been hit, the colonnaded Kurhaus, now a Red Cross Club,\r\nwas intact. So was the Opera House.\r\n\r\nWe found George on the top floor of a dingy building in the center of\r\nthe town. I hadn’t seen him for fifteen years but he hadn’t changed.\r\nHis face was a healthy brown, his eyes were as keen and his teeth as\r\ndazzlingly white as ever. George was in his middle forties. His oldest\r\nboy was in the Navy but George didn’t look a day over thirty. The Roberts\r\nCommission had played in luck when they had got him. Of course he was an\r\nobvious choice—tops in his field, the technical care and preservation\r\nof pictures. He was known and respected throughout the world for his\r\nbrilliant research work at Harvard, where he presided over the laboratory\r\nof the Fogg Museum.\r\n\r\n“Bancel’s got jobs lined up for you fellows, but I think he’d like to\r\ntell you about them himself,” George said. “He ought to be back tonight.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t you tell us in a general way what they are?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“I think one of them is going to be in Frankfurt and the other will\r\nprobably be in Munich. You see, all the stuff from the Merkers mine is in\r\nthe vaults of the Reichsbank at Frankfurt and it ought to be moved to a\r\nplace where it can be permanently stored.”\r\n\r\nThe “stuff” he referred to was the enormous collection of paintings and\r\nsculpture—comprising the principal treasures of the Berlin museums—which\r\nGeorge himself had brought out of the Merkers mine in Thuringia. He had\r\ncarried out the operation virtually singlehanded and in the face of\r\nextraordinary difficulties just before the end of hostilities.\r\n\r\n“As for Munich,” he continued, “repositories are springing up like\r\nmushrooms all through Bavaria. Most of it is loot and we’re going to have\r\nto set up some kind of depot where we can put the things until they can\r\nbe returned to the countries from which the Nazis stole them.”\r\n\r\n“What are your plans?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Well, if the trucks show up,” he said, “I want to get started for Siegen\r\nthis afternoon. That’s in Westphalia. It’s another mine—copper, not\r\nsalt—and it’s full of things from the Rhineland museums. I’ve got to take\r\nthem up to Marburg. We have two good depots there.”\r\n\r\nWe lunched with George and then returned to Bad Homburg. There wasn’t\r\nanything for us to do but wait around until we heard from Captain La\r\nFarge. To fill in the time we took our German books and spent the\r\nafternoon studying in the Kurpark.\r\n\r\nThe telephone was ringing in the entrance lobby as we walked in at five.\r\nIt was Captain La Farge. He had just returned and wanted to see us at\r\nonce. I said I didn’t know whether we could get transportation. He\r\nchuckled and said, “Tell them a general wants to see you.” Craig and I\r\ndashed over to the Transportation Office and tried it out. It worked.\r\nSo, for the second time that day, we found ourselves on the road to\r\nWiesbaden.\r\n\r\nCaptain La Farge was waiting for us in the office where we had seen\r\nGeorge that morning. He was a tall, slender man in his early forties.\r\nWith a high-domed head and a long, rather narrow face, he was the classic\r\nNew Englander. His eyes were hazel and, at that first meeting, very\r\nweary. But he had one of the most ingratiating smiles and one of the\r\nmost pleasant voices I had ever heard. He reminded me of an early Copley\r\nportrait.\r\n\r\nWithout much preamble he launched into a detailed explanation of the\r\nplans he had for us.\r\n\r\n“I want you to take over the Frankfurt job,” he said to me, “and I am\r\nsending you down to Munich, Smyth. As George probably told you, we’ve\r\ngot to set up two big depots. The one in Frankfurt will be mainly for\r\nGerman-owned art which is now coming in from repositories all over this\r\npart of Germany. The one in Munich will be chiefly for loot, though there\r\nwill be German-owned things down in Bavaria too. Both jobs are equally\r\ninteresting, equally important and, above all, equally urgent.”\r\n\r\nWe were to get started without delay. Craig would be attached to the\r\nRegional Military Government office in Munich, I to the Military\r\nGovernment Detachment in Frankfurt. Captain La Farge suggested that I\r\ninvestigate the possibility of requisitioning the university buildings\r\nfor a depot, and advised Craig to consider one of the large Nazi party\r\nbuildings in Munich which he had been told was available.\r\n\r\nOn the way home that night Craig and I compared notes on our new\r\nassignments. I was frankly envious of Craig, not only because there was\r\nsomething alluring about all that loot, but because I loved Munich and\r\nthe picturesque country around it. In turn, Craig thought I had drawn\r\na fascinating job—one that involved handling the wonderful riches of\r\nBerlin’s “Kaiser Friedrich,” admittedly one of the world’s greatest\r\nmuseums.\r\n\r\nThe following morning we parted on the steps of the Grand Parc Hotel.\r\nCraig took off first, in a jeep with trailer attached, a crusty major for\r\nhis companion. Half an hour later a jeep appeared for me. On the way over\r\nto Frankfurt I thought about the experiences of the past three weeks.\r\nIt had been fun sharing them with Craig and I wished that we might have\r\ncontinued this odyssey together. I didn’t realize how soon our paths were\r\nto cross again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)\r\n\r\n_ASSIGNED TO FRANKFURT_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Military Government Detachment had its headquarters in a gray stone\r\nbuilding behind the Opera House. It was one of the few in the city that\r\nhad suffered relatively little damage. I reported to the Executive\r\nOfficer, a white-haired major named James Franklin. After I had explained\r\nthe nature of the work I was expected to do, he took me around to the\r\noffice of Lieutenant Julius Buchman, the Education and Religious Affairs\r\nOfficer, who had also the local MFA&A problems as part of his duties.\r\nBuchman couldn’t have been more pleasant, and said he’d do everything\r\nhe could to help. There was an air of quiet good humor about him that I\r\nliked at once. I learned that he was an architect by profession and had\r\nstudied at the Bauhaus in Dessau before the war. He spoke fluent German.\r\nI told him that first of all I’d like to get settled, so he guided me to\r\nCaptain Wyman Ooley, the Billeting Officer.\r\n\r\nOoley was a happy-go-lucky fellow, the only Billeting Officer I ever\r\nmet who was always cheerful. He had been a schoolteacher in Arkansas.\r\nTogether we drove out to the residential section where a group of houses\r\nhad been set aside for the Military Government officers. This part of the\r\ncity had not been heavily bombed and each one of the houses had a pretty\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you, I’ve got a real nice room in that house over there,” he\r\nsaid, pointing to a gray stucco house partly screened by a row of trees.\r\n“But it’s for lieutenant colonels. It’s empty right now, but I might have\r\nto throw you out later.” Thinking that lieutenant colonels would be very\r\nlikely to have ideas about good plumbing, I quickly said I’d take the\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nThe front door was locked. Ooley called, “Lucienne!” One of the upper\r\nwindows was instantly flung open and a woman, dust-cloth in hand,\r\nleaned out, waved and disappeared. A moment later she reappeared at the\r\nfront door. Lucienne, all smiles, was as French as the tricolor. Ooley\r\nexplained in pidgin French, with gestures, that I was to have a room on\r\nthe second floor, wished me luck and departed. Lucienne bustled up to the\r\nsecond floor chattering away at a great rate, expressing surprise and\r\ndelight that I was “officier de la Marine” and also taking considerable\r\nsatisfaction in having recognized my branch of the service.\r\n\r\nShe threw open a door and then dashed off to the floor above, still\r\nchattering and gesticulating. I was left alone to contemplate the\r\nsplendor before me—an enormous, airy bedroom looking out on a garden\r\nfilled with scarlet roses. This couldn’t be true. Even lieutenant\r\ncolonels didn’t deserve this. The room had cream-colored walls, paneled\r\nand decorated with chinoiserie designs. A large chest of drawers and\r\na low table were decorated in the same manner. In one corner was an\r\ninviting chaise longue, covered in rose brocade. Along the end wall\r\nstood the bed—complete with sheets and a pillow. The built-in wardrobe\r\nhad full-length mirrors which reflected the tall French windows and the\r\ngarden beyond.\r\n\r\nAs I stood there trying to take it all in, Lucienne appeared again. With\r\nher was a dapper little fellow whom she introduced as her husband, René.\r\nHe acknowledged the introduction and then solemnly introduced Lucienne.\r\nAfter this bit of mock formality, he explained that he and Lucienne had\r\ncharge of all the houses in the block. If anything was not to my liking I\r\nwas to let them know and it would be righted at once.\r\n\r\nFurther conversation revealed that the two of them had been deported from\r\nParis early in 1941 and been obliged to remain in Frankfurt, working\r\nfor the Germans, ever since. All through the bombings, I asked? But of\r\ncourse, and they had been too terrible. During one of the worst raids\r\nthey had been imprisoned in the bomb shelter. The falling stones had\r\nblocked the exit. They had had to remain under the ground for forty-eight\r\nhours. They had been made deaf by the noise, yes, for two months. And the\r\nconcussion had made them bleed from the nose and the ears. I asked if\r\nthey expected to go back to Paris. Yes, of course, but they were in no\r\nhurry. It was very nice in Germany, now that the Americans were there.\r\nWith that they left me to unpack and get settled.\r\n\r\nWhen I had finished, I decided to explore a bit. There were two other\r\nbedrooms on the second floor. Neat labels on the doors indicated that\r\nthey were occupied by lieutenant colonels. There were two other doors at\r\nthe end of the hall. Neither one was labeled, so I peered in. They were\r\nthe bathrooms. And what bathrooms! Marble floors, tiled walls, double\r\nwashbasins and built-in tubs. Although it was only the middle of the\r\nmorning, I had to sample one of those magnificent tubs. And as a kind of\r\ntribute to all this elegance, I felt constrained to discard my khakis and\r\nput on blues.\r\n\r\nCaptain La Farge had stressed the urgency of setting up an art depot, so\r\nthe next ten days were given over to that project. Buchman generously\r\nshelved his own work to help me with it. Together we inspected the\r\nUniversity of Frankfurt. The newest of the German universities, it\r\nhad opened its doors at the outbreak of the first World War. The main\r\nadministration building, an imposing structure of red sandstone, had\r\nbeen badly damaged by incendiaries but could be repaired. It would be a\r\nbig job, but we could worry about that later. The first step was to have\r\nit allocated for our use. That had to be done through the proper Army\r\n“channels.” Buchman steered me through. Then we had to obtain an estimate\r\nof the repairs. It took three days to get one from the university\r\narchitect. It was thorough but impractical and had to be completely\r\nrevised. We took the revised estimate to the Army Engineers and asked\r\nthem to make an inspection of the building and check the architect’s\r\nfigures. They were swamped with work. It would be a week before they\r\ncould do anything. I said it was a high priority job, hoping to speed\r\nthings along. But the Engineers had heard that one before. We’d have to\r\nbe patient.\r\n\r\nCharlie Kuhn and Colonel Webb had moved up to Frankfurt and were\r\nestablished at SHAEF headquarters in the I. G. Farben building. Their\r\noffice was only a few blocks from mine, and during my negotiations for\r\nthe use of the university building I was in daily communication with them.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for the Engineers to make the promised inspection, I made\r\na couple of field trips with Buchman. The first was a visit to Schloss\r\nKronberg, a few kilometers from Frankfurt. It was a picturesque medieval\r\ncastle, unoccupied since the first part of the seventeenth century.\r\nValuable archives were stored there. We wanted to see if they were in\r\ngood condition, and also to make sure that the place had been posted with\r\nthe official “Off Limits” signs.\r\n\r\nA flock of geese scattered before us as we drove up to the entrance\r\nat the end of a narrow, winding road. We knocked on the door of the\r\ncaretaker’s cottage and explained the purpose of our visit to the old\r\nfellow who timidly appeared with a large bunch of keys. He limped ahead\r\nof us across the cobbled courtyard, and we waited while he fitted one of\r\nthe keys into the lock.\r\n\r\nA wave of heavy perfume issued from the dark room as the door swung\r\nopen. When our eyes had become accustomed to the dim light, we saw that\r\nwe were in the original _Waffenraum_ of the castle. But, in addition to\r\nthe clustered weapons affixed to the walls, there were five sarcophagi\r\nin the center of the vaulted room. Around them stood vases filled with\r\nspring flowers. On the central sarcophagus rested a spiked helmet of the\r\nfirst World War. The others were unadorned.\r\n\r\nThe old caretaker explained that the central tomb was that of the\r\nLandgraf of Hesse who had died thirty years ago. Those on either side\r\ncontained the remains of his two sons who had likewise died in the first\r\nWorld War. The other two coffins were those of the elder son’s wife and\r\nof a princess of Baden who had been killed in one of the air raids on\r\nFrankfurt in 1944. All five sarcophagi had originally stood in the little\r\nchapel across the courtyard. It had been destroyed by an incendiary bomb\r\nthe winter before.\r\n\r\nWe left this funerary chamber with a feeling of relief and continued\r\nour inspection of the castle. A winding ramp in one of the towers led\r\nto the floors above. From the top story we had a superb view of the\r\nbroad Frankfurt plain spread out below. The caretaker told us he had\r\nwatched the bombings from that vantage point. The great banqueting\r\nhall, with a musicians’ gallery at one end, had been emptied of its\r\noriginal furnishings and was now a jumble of papers stacked in piles of\r\nvarying heights. These were part of the Frankfurt archives. Others were\r\nstored in two rooms on the ground floor. All of the rooms were dry and\r\nweatherproof, so there was nothing further to be done about them for the\r\npresent. There was no place in Frankfurt as yet to which they could be\r\nmoved. “Off Limits” signs had been posted. They would discourage souvenir\r\nhunters from unauthorized delving.\r\n\r\nOn our way back to the car the caretaker told us that the castle still\r\nbelonged to Margarethe, Landgräfin of Hesse, the youngest sister of the\r\nlast Kaiser. Although she was now in her seventies, she came every day\r\nto put fresh flowers beside the tombs of her husband and her two sons.\r\nShe lived at a newer castle, Schloss Friedrichshof, only a few kilometers\r\naway. He apparently didn’t know that Schloss Friedrichshof had been\r\ntaken over by the Army and was being used as an officers’ country club.\r\nThe old Landgräfin was living modestly in one of the small houses on\r\nthe property. Her scapegrace son, Prince Philip, as I learned later,\r\nhad played an active role in the artistic depredations of the Nazi\r\nringleaders. I was to hear more of the Hesse family before the end of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nA second excursion took us still farther afield. On an overcast morning\r\ntwo days later, Buchman, Charlie Kuhn, Captain Rudolph Vassalle (who was\r\nthe Public Safety Officer of the detachment) and I set out in the little\r\nOpel sedan which had been assigned the MFA&A office. We struck out to the\r\neast of Frankfurt on the road to Gelnhausen. We stopped at this pleasant\r\nlittle town with its lovely, early Gothic church and went through the\r\nformality of obtaining clearance from the local Military Government\r\nDetachment to make an inspection in that area.\r\n\r\nFrom there we continued by a winding secondary road which led us through\r\nincreasingly hilly country to Bad Brückenau. Our mission there was\r\ntwofold: Captain Vassalle wanted to track down a young Nazi officer,\r\nreportedly a member of the SS, and to find a warehouse said to contain\r\nvaluable works of art. I had gathered from Buchman that many such reports\r\npetered out on investigation. Still, there was always the chance that\r\nthe one you dismissed as of no importance would turn out to be something\r\nworth while.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The bronze coffin of Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia was\r\nfound in a mine near Bernterode.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Canova’s life-size marble statue of Napoleon’s sister was\r\nfound at the monastery of Hohenfurth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The administration buildings at the salt mine at Alt\r\nAussee, Austria. Removal of stolen art treasures from the mine was\r\ncarried out late in 1945.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Truck at entrance to the main building of the mine is\r\nbeing loaded with paintings, to be taken to Munich for dispersal to their\r\nowner nations.]\r\n\r\nAfter making several inquiries, we eventually located a small house on\r\nthe edge of town. In response to our insistent hammering, the door of\r\nthe house was finally opened by a pallid young man probably in his late\r\ntwenties. If he was the object of the captain’s search he had certainly\r\nundergone a remarkable metamorphosis, for he bore little resemblance to\r\nthe dapper officer of whom Captain Vassalle carried a photograph for\r\nidentification. The captain seemed satisfied that he was the man. So\r\nleaving them in conversation, the three of us followed up the business\r\nof the reported works of art. The other two occupants of the house—an\r\nold man and a young woman who may have been the wife of the man who\r\nhad opened the door—responded to our questions with alacrity and took\r\nus to the cellar. There we were shown a cache of pictures, all of them\r\nunframed and none of them of any value. They appeared to be what the old\r\nman claimed—their own property, brought to Bad Brückenau when they had\r\nleft Frankfurt to escape the bombings. In any case, we made a listing of\r\nthe canvases, identifying them as best we could and making notations of\r\nthe sizes, and also admonishing the couple not to remove them from the\r\npremises.\r\n\r\nAfter that the old man took us across the back yard to a large modern\r\nbarn which was heavily padlocked. Once inside he unshuttered a row of\r\nwindows along one side of the main, ground-floor room. It was jammed to\r\nthe ceiling with every conceivable item of household furnishings: chairs,\r\ntables, beds, bedding, kitchen utensils and porcelain. But no pictures.\r\nWe poked around enough to satisfy ourselves that first appearances were\r\nnot deceiving. They weren’t, so, having made certain that the old fellow,\r\nwho claimed to be merely the custodian of these things, understood the\r\nregulations forbidding their removal, we picked up Captain Vassalle. He\r\nhad completed his interrogation of the alleged SS officer and placed him\r\nunder house arrest.\r\n\r\nOur next objective was an old Schloss which, according to our map, was\r\nstill a good hour’s drive to the northeast. As it was nearly noon and we\r\nwere all hungry, we decided to investigate the possibilities of food in\r\nthe neighborhood. On our way back through Bad Brückenau we stopped at\r\nthe office of a small detachment of troops and asked where we could get\r\nsome lunch. The hospitable second lieutenant on duty in the little stucco\r\nbuilding, which had once been part of the Kurhaus establishment, gave us\r\ndirections to the sprawling country hotel, high up above the town, where\r\nhis outfit was quartered. He said that he would telephone ahead to warn\r\nthe mess sergeant of our arrival.\r\n\r\nFor a little way we followed along the Sinn, which flows through the\r\ngrassy valley in which Bad Brückenau nestles. Then we began to mount\r\nsharply and, for the next fifteen minutes, executed a series of hairpin\r\nturns and ended abruptly beside a rambling structure which commanded a\r\nwonderful view of the valley and the wooded hills on the other side. Our\r\nhosts were a group of friendly young fellows who seemed delighted to have\r\nthe monotony of their rural routine interrupted by our visit. They asked\r\nCharlie and me the usual question—what was the Navy doing in the middle\r\nof Germany—and got our stock reply: we are planning to dig a canal from\r\nthe North Sea to the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nWe had a heavy downpour during lunch, and we waited for the rain to let\r\nup before starting out again. Then we took the winding road down into\r\ntown, crossed the river and drove up into the hills on the other side of\r\nthe valley. An hour’s drive brought us to upland meadow country and a\r\ngrove of handsome lindens. At the end of a long double row of these fine\r\ntrees stood Schloss Rossbach. “Castle” was a rather pompous name for the\r\nbig seventeenth century country house with whitewashed walls and heavily\r\nbarred ground-floor windows.\r\n\r\nWe were received by the owners, a Baron Thüngen and his wife, and\r\nexplained that we had come to examine the condition of the works of\r\nart, which, according to our information, had been placed there for\r\nsafekeeping. They ushered us up to a comfortable sitting room on the\r\nsecond floor where we settled down to wait while the baroness went off to\r\nget the keys. In the meantime we had a few words with her husband. His\r\nmanner was that of the haughty landed proprietor, and he looked the part.\r\nHe was a big, burly man in his sixties. He was dressed in rough tweeds\r\nand wore a matching hat, adorned with a bushy “shaving brush,” which he\r\nhadn’t bothered to remove indoors. That may have been unintentional, but\r\nI idly wondered if it weren’t deliberate discourtesy and rather wished\r\nthat I had kept my own cap on. I wished also that I could have matched\r\nhis insolent expression, but thought it unlikely because I was frankly\r\nenjoying the obvious distaste which our visit was causing the old codger.\r\n\r\nHowever, his attitude was almost genial compared with that of his waspish\r\nwife, who reappeared about that time, armed with a huge hoop from which\r\na great lot of keys jangled. The baroness, who was much younger than\r\nher husband, had very black hair and discontented dark eyes. She spoke\r\nexcellent English, without a trace of accent. I felt reasonably sure that\r\nshe was not German but couldn’t guess her nationality. It turned out that\r\nshe was from the Argentine. She was a sullen piece and made no effort to\r\nconceal her irritation at our intrusion. She explained that neither she\r\nnor her husband had anything to do with the things stored there; that, in\r\nfact, it was a great inconvenience having to put up with them. She had\r\nasked the young woman who knew all about them to join us.\r\n\r\nThe young woman in question arrived and was completely charming. She\r\ntook no apparent notice of the baroness’ indifference, which was that\r\nof a mistress toward a servant whom she scarcely knew. Her fresh, open\r\nmanner cleared the atmosphere instantly. She introduced herself as Frau\r\nHolzinger, wife of the director of Frankfurt’s most famous museum, the\r\nStaedelsches Kunstinstitut. Because of conditions in Frankfurt, and more\r\nparticularly because their house had been requisitioned by the American\r\nmilitary authorities, she had come to Schloss Rossbach with her two young\r\nchildren. Country life, she continued, was better for the youngsters and,\r\nbesides, her husband had thought that she might help with the things\r\nstored at the castle. I had met Dr. Holzinger when I went one day to\r\nhave a look at what remained of the museum, so his wife and I hit it off\r\nat once. I was interested to learn that she was Swiss and a licensed\r\nphysician. She smilingly suggested that we make a tour of the castle and\r\nshe would show us what was there.\r\n\r\nThe first room to be inspected was a library adjoining the sitting room\r\nin which we had been waiting. Here we found a quantity of excellent\r\nFrench Impressionist paintings, all from the permanent collection of the\r\nStaedel, and a considerable number of fine Old Master drawings. Most of\r\nthese were likewise the property of the museum, but a few—I remember one\r\nsuperb Rembrandt sketch—appeared to have come from Switzerland. Those\r\nwould, of course, have to be looked into later, to determine their exact\r\norigin and how they came to be on loan at the museum. But for the moment\r\nwe were concerned primarily with storage conditions and the problem of\r\nsecurity. In another room we found an enormous collection of books, the\r\nlibrary of one of the Frankfurt museums. In a third we encountered an\r\narray of medieval sculpture—saints of all sizes and description, some of\r\ncarved wood, others of stone, plain or polychromed. These too were of\r\nmuseum origin.\r\n\r\nThe last storage room was below ground, a vast, cavernous chamber beneath\r\nthe house. Here was row upon row of pictures, stacked in two tiers down\r\nthe center of the room and also along two sides. From what we could make\r\nof them in the poor light, they were not of high quality. During the\r\nsummer months they would be all right in this underground room, but we\r\nthought that the place would be very damp in the winter. Frau Holzinger\r\nassured us that this was so and that the pictures should be removed\r\nbefore the bad weather set in.\r\n\r\nThe baroness chipped in at this point and affably agreed with that idea,\r\nundoubtedly happy to further any scheme which involved getting rid of\r\nthese unwelcome objects. She also warned us that the castle was far from\r\nsafe as it was, what with roving bands of Poles all over the countryside.\r\nAs we indicated that we were about to take our leave, she elaborated upon\r\nthis theme, declaring that their very lives were in danger, that every\r\nnight she and her husband could hear prowlers in the park. Since they—as\r\nGermans—were not allowed to have firearms, they would be at the mercy\r\nof these foreign ruffians if they should succeed in breaking into the\r\ncastle. By this time we were all pretty fed up with the whining baroness.\r\nAs we turned to go, Charlie Kuhn, eyeing her coldly, asked, “Who brought\r\nthose Poles here in the first place, madam? We didn’t.”\r\n\r\nTo our delight, the weather had cleared and the sun was shining. Ahead\r\nof us on the roadway, the foliage of the lindens made a gaily moving\r\npattern. Our work for the day was done and we still had half the\r\nafternoon. I got out the map and, after making some quick calculations,\r\nproposed that we could take in Würzburg and still get back to Frankfurt\r\nat a reasonable hour. We figured out that, with the extra jerry can of\r\ngas we had with us, we could just about make it. We would be able to fill\r\nup at Würzburg for the return trip. So, instead of continuing on the road\r\nback to Bad Brückenau, we turned south in the direction of Karlstadt.\r\n\r\nIt was pleasant to be traveling a good secondary road instead of the\r\nbroad, characterless Autobahn, on which there were no unexpected\r\nturns, no picturesque villages. There was little traffic, so we made\r\nvery good time. In half an hour we had threaded our way through\r\nKarlstadt-on-the-Main. In this part of Franconia the Main is a capricious\r\nriver, winding casually in and out of the gently undulating hills.\r\nA little later we passed the village of Veitschöchheim where the\r\nPrince-Bishops of Würzburg had an elaborate country house during the\r\neighteenth century. The house still stands, and its gardens, with a tiny\r\nlake and grottoes in the Franco-Italian manner, remain one of the finest\r\nexamples of garden planning of that day. As we drove by we were glad that\r\nthis inviting spot had not attracted the attention of our bombers.\r\n\r\nAlas, such was not the case with Würzburg, as we realized the minute we\r\nreached its outskirts! The once-gracious city, surely one of the most\r\nbeautiful in all Germany, was an appalling sight. Its broad avenues\r\nwere now lined with nothing but the gaping, ruined remnants of the\r\nstately eighteenth century buildings which had lent the city an air of\r\nunparalleled distinction and consistency of design. High on its hilltop\r\nabove the Main, the mellow walls of the medieval fortress of Marienberg\r\ncaught the rays of the late afternoon sun. From the distance, the\r\nsilhouette of that vast structure appeared unchanged, but the proud city\r\nof the Prince-Bishops which it overlooked was laid low.\r\n\r\nWe drove slowly along streets not yet cleared of rubble, until we came\r\nto the Residenz, the great palace of the Prince-Bishops, those lavish\r\npatrons of the arts to whom the city owed so much of its former grandeur.\r\nThis magnificent building, erected in the first half of the eighteenth\r\ncentury by the celebrated baroque architect, Johann Balthasar Neumann,\r\nfor two Prince-Bishops of the Schönborn family, was now a ghost palace,\r\nits staring glassless windows and blackened walls pathetic vestiges of\r\nits pristine splendor.\r\n\r\nWe walked up to the main entrance wondering if it could really be true\r\nthat the crowning glory of the Residenz—the glorious ceiling by Tiepolo,\r\nrepresenting Olympus and the Four Continents—was, as we had been told,\r\nstill intact. With misgivings we turned left across the entrance hall to\r\nthe Treppenhaus and mounted the grand staircase. We looked up and there\r\nit was—as dazzling and majestically beautiful as ever—that incomparable\r\nfresco, the masterpiece of the last great Italian painter. Someone with\r\na far greater gift for words than I may be able to convey the exaltation\r\none experiences on seeing that ceiling, not just for the first time\r\nbut at any time. I can’t. It leaves artist and layman alike absolutely\r\nspeechless. I think that, if I had to choose one great work of art, it\r\nwould be this ceiling in the Residenz. You can have even the Sistine\r\nceiling. I’ll take the Tiepolo.\r\n\r\nFor the next half hour we examined every corner of it. Aside from a few\r\nminor discolorations, the result of water having seeped through the lower\r\nside of the vault just above the cornice, the fresco was undamaged.\r\nConsidering the destruction throughout the rest of the building, I\r\ncould not understand how this portion of the palace could be in such a\r\nremarkable state of preservation. The explanation was an interesting\r\nexample of how good can sometimes come out of evil. Some forty years\r\nago, as I remember the story, there was a fire in the Residenz. The\r\nwooden roof over a large portion, if not all, of the building was burned\r\naway. When it came to replacing the roof, the city fathers decided\r\nit would be a prudent idea to cover the part above the Tiepolo with\r\nsteel and concrete. This was done, and consequently, when the terrible\r\nconflagration of March 1945 swept Würzburg—following the single raid of\r\ntwenty minutes which destroyed the city—the fresco was spared. As we\r\nwandered through other rooms of the Residenz—the Weisser Saal with its\r\nelaborate stucco ornamentation and the sumptuous Kaiser Saal facing the\r\ngarden, once classic examples of the Rococo—I wished that those city\r\nfathers had gone a little farther with their steel and concrete.\r\n\r\nWe stopped briefly to examine the chapel in the south wing. Here,\r\nmiraculously enough, there had been relatively little damage, but the\r\ncaretaker expressed concern over the condition of the roof and said that\r\nif it weren’t repaired before the heavy rains the ceiling would be lost.\r\nKnowing how hard it was to obtain building materials for even the most\r\nhistoric monuments when people didn’t have a roof over their heads, we\r\ncouldn’t reassure him with much conviction.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of ruined Würzburg had a depressing effect upon us, so we\r\nweren’t very talkative on our way back to Frankfurt. We passed through\r\nonly one town of any size, Aschaffenburg, which, like Würzburg, had\r\nsuffered severe damage. Although I had not been long in Germany and\r\nhad seen but few of her cities, I was beginning to realize that the\r\nreports of the Allied air attacks had not been exaggerated. I was ready\r\nto believe that there were only small towns and villages left in this\r\nravaged country.\r\n\r\nOne morning Charlie Kuhn rang up to say that I should meet him at the\r\nReichsbank early that afternoon. This was something I had been looking\r\nforward to for some time, the chance to look at the wonderful things\r\nfrom the Merkers mine which were temporarily stored there. With Charlie\r\ncame two members of the MFA&A organization whom I had not seen since\r\nVersailles and then only briefly. They had been stationed at Barbizon, as\r\npart of the Allied Group Control Council for Germany (usually referred\r\nto simply as “Group CC”) the top level policy-making body as opposed\r\nto SHAEF, which dealt with the operational end of things. These two\r\ngentlemen were John Nicholas Brown, who had come over to Germany with the\r\nassimilated rank of colonel as General Eisenhower’s adviser on cultural\r\naffairs, and Major Mason Hammond, in civilian life professor of the\r\nClassics at Harvard.\r\n\r\nIt had been decided, now that we were about to acquire a permanent\r\ndepot in which to store the treasures, to make one Monuments officer\r\nresponsible for the entire collection. By this transfer of custody, the\r\nProperty Control Officer in whose charge the things were at present,\r\ncould be relieved of that responsibility. Major Hammond had with him a\r\npaper designating me as custodian. Knowing in a general way what was\r\nstored in the bank, I felt that I was on the point of being made a sort\r\nof director, pro tem, of the Kaiser Friedrich Museum.\r\n\r\nThe genial Property Control Officer, Captain William Dunn, was all\r\nsmiles at the prospect of turning his burden over to someone else. But\r\nbefore this transfer could be made, a complete check of every item was\r\nnecessary. Major Hammond knew just how he wanted this done. I was to have\r\ntwo assistants, who could come over the next morning from his office in\r\nHoechst, twenty minutes from Frankfurt. The three of us, in company with\r\nCaptain Dunn, would make the inventory.\r\n\r\nWe wandered through the series of rooms in which the things were stored.\r\nIn the first room were something like four hundred pictures lined up\r\nagainst the wall in a series of rows. In two adjoining rooms were great\r\nwooden cases piled one above another. In a fourth were leather-bound\r\nboxes containing the priceless etchings, engravings and woodcuts from the\r\nBerlin Print Room. Still another room was filled with cases containing\r\nthe renowned Egyptian collections. It was rumored that one of them held\r\nthe world-famous head of Queen Nefertete, probably the best known and\r\ncertainly the most beloved single piece of all Egyptian sculpture. It had\r\noccupied a place of special honor in the Berlin Museum, in a gallery all\r\nto itself.\r\n\r\nStill other rooms were jammed with cases of paintings and sculpture of\r\nthe various European schools. In a series of smaller alcoves were heaped\r\nhuge piles of Oriental rugs and rare fabrics. And last, one enormous\r\nroom with bookshelves was filled from floor to ceiling with some thirty\r\nthousand volumes from the Berlin Patent Office. Quite separate and apart\r\nfrom all these things was a unique collection of ecclesiastical vessels\r\nof gold and silver, the greater part of them looted from Poland. These\r\nextremely precious objects were kept in a special vault on the floor\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunn brought out a thick stack of papers. It was the complete\r\ninventory. Major Hammond said that the two officers who would help\r\nwith the checking were a Captain Edwin Rae and a WAC lieutenant named\r\nStanden. Aside from having heard that Rae had been a student of Charlie\r\nKuhn’s at Harvard, I knew nothing about him. But the name Standen rang\r\na bell: was she, by any chance, Edith Standen who had been curator of\r\nthe Widener Collection? Major Hammond smilingly replied, “The same.” I\r\nhad known her years ago in Cambridge where we had taken Professor Sachs’\r\ncourse in Museum Administration at the same time. I remembered her as\r\na tall, dark, distinguished-looking English girl. To be exact, she was\r\nhalf English: her father had been a British Army officer, her mother a\r\nBostonian. Recalling her very reserved manner and her scholarly tastes, I\r\nfound it difficult to imagine her in uniform.\r\n\r\nEarly the following morning, I met my cohorts at the entrance to the\r\nReichsbank. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Captain Rae was\r\nan old acquaintance if not an old friend. He also had been around the\r\nFogg Museum in my time. Edith looked very smart in her uniform. She had\r\na brisk, almost jovial manner which was not to be reconciled with her\r\naloof and dignified bearing in the marble halls of the Widener house at\r\nElkins Park. We hunted up Captain Dunn and set to work. Our first task\r\nwas to count and check off the paintings stacked in the main room. We\r\ngot through them with reasonable speed, refraining with some difficulty\r\nfrom pausing to admire certain pictures we particularly fancied. Then we\r\ntackled the Oriental rugs, and that proved to be a thoroughly thankless\r\nand arduous task. We had a crew of eight PWs—prisoners of war—to help us\r\nspread the musty carpets out on the floor. Owing to the fact that the\r\nsmaller carpets—in some cases they were hardly more than fragments—had\r\nbeen rolled up inside larger ones, we ended with nearly a hundred more\r\nitems than the inventory called for. That troubled Captain Dunn a bit,\r\nbut I told him that it didn’t matter so long as we were over. We’d have\r\nto start worrying only if we came out short. By five o’clock we were\r\ntired and dirty and barely a third of the way through with the job.\r\n\r\nThe next day we started in on the patent records. There had been a fire\r\nin the mine where the records were originally stored. Many of them were\r\nslightly charred, and all of them had been impregnated with smoke.\r\nWhen we had finished counting the whole thirty thousand, we smelled\r\njust the way they did. As a matter of fact we hadn’t wanted to assume\r\nresponsibility for these records in the first place. Certainly they had\r\nnothing to do with art. But Major Hammond had felt that they properly\r\nfell to us as archives. And of course they were archives of a sort.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the third day, as I was about to leave my office for\r\nthe Reichsbank, I had a phone call from Charlie Kuhn. He asked me how the\r\nwork was coming along and then, in a guarded voice, said that something\r\nunexpected had turned up and that he might have to send me away for a few\r\ndays. He told me he couldn’t talk about it on the telephone, and anyway,\r\nit wasn’t definite. He’d probably know by afternoon. I was to call him\r\nlater. This was hardly the kind of conversation to prepare one for a\r\nhumdrum day of taking inventory, even if one were counting real treasure.\r\nAnd for a person with my curiosity, the morning’s work was torture.\r\n\r\nWhen I called Charlie after lunch he was out but had left word that I was\r\nto come to his office at two o’clock. When I got there he was sitting at\r\nhis desk. He looked up from the dispatch he was reading and said with\r\na rueful smile, “Tom, I am going to send you out on a job I’d give my\r\neyeteeth to have for myself.” Then he explained that certain developments\r\nhad suddenly made it necessary to step up the work of evacuating art\r\nrepositories down in Bavaria and in even more distant areas. For the\r\nfirst time in my life I knew what was meant by the expression “my heart\r\njumped a beat”—for that was exactly what happened to mine! No wonder\r\nCharlie was envious. This sounded like the real thing.\r\n\r\nCharlie told me that I was to fly down to Munich the next morning and\r\nthat I would probably be gone about ten days. To save time he had already\r\nhad my orders cut. All I had to do was to pick them up at the AG office.\r\nI was to report to Third Army Headquarters and get in touch with George\r\nStout as soon as possible. Charlie didn’t know just where I’d find\r\nGeorge. He was out in the wilds somewhere. As a matter of fact he wasn’t\r\ntoo sure about the exact location of Third Army Headquarters. A new\r\nheadquarters was being established and the only information he had was\r\nthat it would be somewhere in or near Munich. The name, he said, would be\r\n“Lucky Rear” and I would simply have to make inquiries and be guided by\r\nsigns posted along the streets.\r\n\r\nI asked Charlie what I should do about the completion of the inventory\r\nat the Reichsbank, and also about the impending report from the Corps of\r\nEngineers on the University of Frankfurt building. He suggested that I\r\nleave the former in Captain Rae’s hands and the latter with Lieutenant\r\nBuchman. Upon my return I could take up where I had left off.\r\n\r\nThat evening I threw my things together, packing only enough clothes to\r\nsee me through the next ten days. Not knowing where I would be billeted I\r\ntook the precaution of including my blankets. Even at that my luggage was\r\ncompact and light, which was desirable as I was traveling by air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(3)\r\n\r\n_MUNICH AND THE BEGINNING OF FIELD WORK_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning I was up before six and had early breakfast. It was a\r\nwonderful day for the trip, brilliantly clear. The corporal in our office\r\ntook me out to the airfield, the one near Hanau where Craig Smyth and I\r\nhad landed weeks before. It was going to be fun to see Craig again and\r\nfind out what he had been up to since we had parted that morning in Bad\r\nHomburg. The drive to the airfield took about forty-five minutes. There\r\nwas a wait of half an hour at the field, and it was after ten when we\r\ntook off in our big C-47. We flew over little villages with red roofs,\r\noccasionally a large town—but none that I could identify—and now and then\r\na silvery lake.\r\n\r\nJust before we reached Munich, someone said, “There’s Dachau.” Directly\r\nbelow us, on one side of a broad sweep of dark pine trees, we saw a group\r\nof low buildings and a series of fenced-in enclosures. On that sunny\r\nmorning the place looked deserted and singularly peaceful. Yet only a\r\nfew weeks before it had been filled with the miserable victims of Nazi\r\nbrutality.\r\n\r\nIn another ten minutes we landed on the dusty field of the principal\r\nMunich airport. Most of the administration buildings had a slightly\r\nbattered look but were in working order. It was a welcome relief to\r\ntake refuge from the blazing sunshine in the cool hallway of the main\r\nbuilding. The imposing yellow brick lobby was decorated with painted\r\nshields of the different German states or “Länder.” The arms of Bavaria,\r\nSaxony, Hesse-Nassau and the rest formed a colorful frieze around the\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nA conveyance of some kind was scheduled to leave for town in a few\r\nminutes. Meanwhile there were sandwiches and coffee for the plane\r\npassengers. By the time we had finished, a weapons carrier had pulled\r\nup before the entrance. Several of us climbed into its dust-encrusted\r\ninterior. It took me a little while to get my bearings as we drove toward\r\nMunich. I had spotted the familiar pepper-pot domes of the Frauenkirche\r\nfrom the air but had recognized no other landmark of the flat, sprawling\r\ncity which I had known well before the war.\r\n\r\nIt was not until we turned into the broad Prinz Regenten-Strasse that\r\nI knew exactly where I was. As we drove down this handsome avenue, I\r\ngot a good look at a long, colonnaded building of white stone. The roof\r\nwas draped with what appeared to be an enormous, dark green fishnet.\r\nThe billowing scallops of the net flapped about the gleaming cornice of\r\nthe building. It was the Haus der Deutschen Kunst, the huge exhibition\r\ngallery dedicated by Hitler in the middle thirties to the kind of art\r\nof which he approved—an art in which there was no place for untrammeled\r\nfreedom of expression, only the pictorial and plastic representation\r\nof all the Nazi regime stood for. The dangling fishnet was part of the\r\nelaborate camouflage. I judged from the condition of the building that\r\nthe net had admirably served its purpose.\r\n\r\nIn a moment we rounded the corner by the Prinz Karl Palais. Despite the\r\ndisfiguring coat of ugly olive paint which covered its classic façade, it\r\nhad not escaped the bombs. The little palace, where Mussolini had stayed,\r\nhad a hollow, battered look and the formal garden behind it was a waste\r\nof furrowed ground and straggling weeds. We turned left into the wide\r\nLudwig-Strasse and came to a grinding halt beside a bleak gray building\r\nwhose walls were pockmarked with artillery fire. I asked our driver if\r\nthis were Lucky Rear headquarters and was told curtly that it wasn’t,\r\nbut that it was the end of the line. It was MP headquarters and I’d have\r\nto see if they’d give me a car to take me to my destination, which the\r\ndriver said was “’way the hell” on the other side of town.\r\n\r\nBefore going inside I looked down the street to the left. The familiar\r\nold buildings were still standing, but they were no longer the trim,\r\ncream-colored structures which had once given that part of the city such\r\na clean, orderly air. Most of them were burned out. Farther along on\r\nthe right, the Theatinerkirche was masked with scaffolding. At the end\r\nof the street the Feldherren-Halle, Ludwig I’s copy of the Loggia dei\r\nLanzi, divested of its statuary, reared its columns in the midst of the\r\ndesolation.\r\n\r\nIt was gray and cool in the rooms of the MP building, but the place was\r\ncrowded. Soldiers were everywhere and things seemed to be at sixes and\r\nsevens. After making several inquiries and being passed from one desk to\r\nanother, I finally got hold of a brisk young sergeant to whom I explained\r\nmy troubles. At first he said there wasn’t a chance of getting a ride out\r\nto Lucky Rear. Every jeep was tied up and would be for hours. They had\r\njust moved into Munich and hadn’t got things organized yet. Then all at\r\nonce he relented and with a grin said, “Oh, you’re Navy, aren’t you? In\r\nthat case I’ll have to fix you up somehow. We can’t have the Navy saying\r\nthe Army doesn’t co-operate.”\r\n\r\nHe walked over to a window that looked down on the courtyard below,\r\nshouted instructions to someone and then told me I’d find a jeep and\r\ndriver outside. “Think nothing of it, Lieutenant,” he said in answer to\r\nmy thanks. “Maybe I’ll be wanting a ship to take me home one of these\r\ndays before long. Have to keep on the good side of the Navy.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In the Kaiser Josef chamber of the Alt Aussee mine Karl\r\nSieber and Lieutenant Kern view Michelangelo’s Madonna and Child, stolen\r\nfrom a church at Bruges.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lieutenants Kovalyak, Stout and Howe pack the Michelangelo\r\nMadonna for return to Bruges.

We turned the corner and followed the\r\nPrinz Regenten-Strasse to the river. I noticed for the first time that\r\na temporary track had been laid along one side. This had been done, the\r\ndriver said, in order to cart away the rubble which had accumulated\r\nin the downtown section. We turned right and followed the Isar for\r\nseveral blocks, crossed to the left over the Ludwig bridge, then drove\r\nout the Rosenheimer-Strasse to the east for a distance of about three\r\nmiles. Our destination was the enormous complex of buildings called the\r\nReichszeugmeisterei, or Quartermaster Corps buildings, in which the\r\nrear echelon of General Patton’s Third Army had just established its\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\nEven in the baking sunlight of that June day, the place had a cold,\r\nunfriendly appearance. We halted for identification at the entrance, and\r\nthere I was introduced to Third Army discipline. One of the guards gave\r\nme a black look and growled, “Put your cap on.” Startled by this burly\r\norder, I hastily complied and then experienced a feeling of extreme\r\nirritation at having been so easily cowed. I could at least have asked\r\nhim to say “sir.”\r\n\r\nThe driver, sensing my discomfiture, remarked good-naturedly, “You’ll get\r\nused to that sort of thing around here, sir. They’re very, very fussy now\r\nthat the shooting’s over. Seems like they don’t have anything else to\r\nworry about, except enforcing a lot of regulations.” This was my first\r\nsample of what I learned to call by its popular name, “chicken”—a prudent\r\nabbreviation for the exasperating rules and regulations one finds at an\r\nArmy headquarters. Third Army had its share of them—perhaps a little\r\nmore than its share. But I didn’t find that out all at once. It took me\r\nall of two days.\r\n\r\nMy driver let me out in front of the main building, over the central\r\ndoorway of which the emblem of the Third Army was proudly displayed—a\r\nbold “A” inside a circle. The private at the information desk had never\r\nheard of the “Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Section,” but said that\r\nif it was a part of G-5 it would be on the fifth floor. I found the\r\noffice of the Assistant Chief of Staff and was directed to a room at the\r\nend of a corridor at least two blocks long. I was told that the officer I\r\nshould see was Captain Robert Posey. I knew that name from the reports I\r\nhad studied at Versailles, as well as from a magazine article describing\r\nhis discovery, months before, of some early frescoes in the little\r\nRomanesque church of Mont St. Martin which had been damaged by bombing.\r\nThe article had been written by an old friend of mine, Lincoln Kirstein,\r\nwho was connected with the MFA&A work in Europe.\r\n\r\nWhen I opened the door of the MFA&A office, George Stout was standing in\r\nthe middle of the room. The expression of surprise on his face changed to\r\nrelief after he had read the letter I handed him from Charlie Kuhn.\r\n\r\n“You couldn’t have arrived at a more opportune time,” he said. “I came\r\ndown from Alt Aussee today to see Posey, but I just missed him. He left\r\nthis morning for a conference in Frankfurt. I wanted to find out what\r\nhad happened to the armed escort he promised me for my convoys. We’re\r\nevacuating the mine and desperately shorthanded, so I’ve got to get back\r\ntonight. It’s a six-hour drive.”\r\n\r\n“Charlie said you needed help. What do you want me to do?” I asked. I\r\nhoped he would take me along.\r\n\r\n“I’d like to have you stay here until we get this escort problem\r\nstraightened out. I was promised two half-tracks, but they didn’t show\r\nup this morning. I’ve got a call in about them right now. It’s three\r\no’clock. I ought to make Salzburg by five-thirty. There’ll surely be some\r\nword about the escort by that time, and I’ll phone you from there.”\r\n\r\nBefore he left, George introduced me to Lieutenant Colonel William\r\nHamilton, the Assistant Chief of Staff, and explained to him that I had\r\ncome down on special orders from SHAEF to help with the evacuation work.\r\nGeorge told the colonel that I would be joining him at the mine as soon\r\nas Captain Posey returned and provided me with the necessary clearance.\r\nAfter we had left Colonel Hamilton’s office, I asked George what he meant\r\nby “clearance.” He laughed and said that I would have to obtain a written\r\npermit from Posey before I could operate in Third Army territory. As\r\nThird Army’s Monuments Officer, Posey had absolute jurisdiction in all\r\nmatters pertaining to the fine arts in the area occupied by his Army. At\r\nthat time it included a portion of Austria which later came under General\r\nMark Clark’s command.\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry,” said George. “I’ll have you at the mine in a few days, and\r\nyou’ll probably be sorry you ever laid eyes on the place.”\r\n\r\nI went back to the MFA&A office and was about to settle down at Captain\r\nPosey’s vacant desk. I looked across to a corner of the room where\r\na lanky enlisted man sat hunched up at a typewriter. It was Lincoln\r\nKirstein, looking more than ever like a world-weary Rachmaninoff. Lincoln\r\na private in the U. S. Army! What a far cry from the world of modern art\r\nand the ballet! He was thoroughly enjoying my astonishment.\r\n\r\n“This is a surprise, but it explains a lot of things,” I said, dragging a\r\nchair over to his desk. “So you are the Svengali of the Fine Arts here at\r\nThird Army.”\r\n\r\n“You mustn’t say things like that around this headquarters,” he said\r\napprehensively.\r\n\r\nDuring the next two hours we covered a lot of territory. First of all, I\r\nwanted to know why he was an enlisted man chained to a typewriter. With\r\nhis extraordinary intelligence and wide knowledge of the Fine Arts, he\r\ncould have been more useful as an officer. He said that he had applied\r\nfor a commission and had been turned down. I was sorry I had brought up\r\nthe subject, but knowing Lincoln’s fondness for the dramatic I thought it\r\nquite possible that he had wanted to be able to say in later years that\r\nhe had gone through the war as an enlisted man. He agreed that he could\r\nhave been of greater service to the Fine Arts project as an officer.\r\n\r\nThen I asked him what his “boss”—he was to be mine too—was like. He said\r\nthat Captain Posey, an architect in civilian life, had had a spectacular\r\ncareer during combat. In the face of almost insurmountable obstacles,\r\nsuch as lack of personnel and transportation and especially the lack of\r\nany real co-operation from the higher-ups, he had accomplished miracles.\r\nNow that the press was devoting more and more space to the work the\r\nMonuments officers were doing—the discovery of treasures in salt mines\r\nand so on—they were beginning to pay loving attention to Captain Posey\r\naround the headquarters.\r\n\r\nI gathered from Lincoln that the present phase of our activities appealed\r\nto the captain less than the protection and repair of historic monuments\r\nunder fire. If true, this was understandable enough. He was an architect.\r\nWhy would he, except as a matter of general cultural interest, find\r\nwork that lay essentially in the domain of a museum man particularly\r\nabsorbing? It seemed reasonable to assume that Captain Posey would\r\nwelcome museum men to shoulder a part of the burden. But I was to learn\r\nlater that my assumption was not altogether correct.\r\n\r\nEventually I had to interrupt our conversation. It was getting late, and\r\nstill no word about the escort vehicles. Lincoln told me where I would\r\nfind the officer who was to have called George. He was Captain Blyth, a\r\nrough-and-ready kind of fellow, an ex-trooper from the state of Virginia.\r\nThe outlook was not encouraging. No vehicles were as yet available.\r\nFinally, at six o’clock, he rang up to say that he wouldn’t know anything\r\nbefore morning.\r\n\r\nLincoln returned from chow, I gave him the message in case George called\r\nwhile I was out and went down to eat. It was after eight when George\r\ntelephoned. The connection from Salzburg was bad, and so was his temper\r\nwhen I told him I had nothing to report.\r\n\r\nLincoln usually spent his evenings at the office. That night we stayed\r\ntill after eleven. Here and there he had picked up some fascinating\r\nGerman art books and magazines, all of them Nazi publications lavishly\r\nillustrated. They bore eloquent testimony to Hitler’s patronage of\r\nthe arts. The banality of the contemporary work in painting was\r\nstultifying—dozens of rosy-cheeked, buxom maidens and stalwart,\r\nbrown-limbed youths reeking with “strength through joy,” and acres of\r\nidyllic landscapes. The sculpture was better, though too often the\r\ntendency toward the colossal was tiresomely in evidence. It was in\r\nrecording the art of the past, notably in the monographs dealing with\r\nthe great monuments of the Middle Ages and the Baroque, that admirable\r\nprogress had been made. I asked Lincoln enviously how he had got hold of\r\nthese things. He answered laconically that he had “liberated” them.\r\n\r\nCaptain Blyth had good news for me the next morning. Two armored vehicles\r\nhad left Munich for the mine. I gave the message to George when he called\r\njust before noon.\r\n\r\n“They’re a little late,” he said. “Thanks to the fine co-operation of\r\nthe 11th Armored Division, I am being taken care of from this end of the\r\nline. I’ll try to catch your fellows in Salzburg and tell them to go\r\nback where they came from. I am sending you a letter by the next convoy.\r\nIt’s about a repository which ought to be evacuated right away. I can’t\r\ngive you any of the details over the phone without violating security\r\nregulations. As soon as Posey gets back, you ought to go to work on it.\r\nAfter that I want you to help me here.”\r\n\r\nAfter George had hung up, I asked Lincoln if he had any idea what\r\nrepository George had in mind. Lincoln said it might be the monastery at\r\nHohenfurth. It was in Czechoslovakia, just over the border from Austria.\r\nWhile we were discussing this possibility, Craig Smyth walked in.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had recovered from the surprise of finding me at Captain\r\nPosey’s desk, he explained the reason for his visit. Something had to\r\nbe done right away about the building he was setting up as a collecting\r\npoint. He had been promised a twenty-four-hour guard. He had been\r\npromised a barrier of barbed wire. So far, Third Army had failed to\r\nprovide either one. A lot of valuable stuff had already been delivered to\r\nthe building, and George was sending in more. He couldn’t wait any longer.\r\n\r\n“Let’s have a talk with Colonel Hamilton,” I said. As we walked down to\r\nthe Assistant Chief of Staff’s office, Craig told me that the buildings\r\nhe had requisitioned were the ones Bancel La Farge had suggested when we\r\nsaw him at Wiesbaden a month ago.\r\n\r\n“Can’t this matter wait until Captain Posey returns?” the colonel asked.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid it can’t, sir,” said Craig. “As you know, the two buildings\r\nwere the headquarters of the Nazi party. The Nazis meant to destroy them\r\nbefore Munich fell. Having failed to do so, I think it quite possible\r\nthat they may still attempt it. Both buildings are honeycombed with\r\nunderground passageways. Only this morning we located the exit of one\r\nof them. It was half a block from the building. We hadn’t known of its\r\nexistence before. The works of art stored in the building at present are\r\nworth millions of dollars. In the circumstances, I am not willing to\r\naccept the responsibility for what may happen to them. I must have guards\r\nor a barrier at once.”\r\n\r\nThe colonel reached for the telephone and gave orders that a cordon of\r\nguards was to be placed on the buildings immediately. He made a second\r\ncall, this time about the barbed wire. When he had finished he told Craig\r\nthat the guard detail would report that afternoon; the barbed wire would\r\nbe strung around the building the next morning. We thanked the colonel\r\nand returned to Posey’s office.\r\n\r\nWe found two officers who had just come in from Dachau. They were waiting\r\nto see someone connected with Property Control. They had brought with\r\nthem a flour sack filled with gold wedding rings; a large carton stuffed\r\nwith gold teeth, bridgework, crowns and braces (in children’s sizes);\r\na sack containing gold coins (for the most part Russian) and American\r\ngreenbacks. As we looked at these mementos of the concentration camp, I\r\nthought of the atrocity film I had seen at Versailles and wondered how\r\nanyone could believe that those pictures had been an exaggeration.\r\n\r\nI went back with Craig to his office at the Königsplatz. The damage to\r\nMunich was worse than I had realized. The great Deutsches Museum by the\r\nriver was a hollow-eyed specter, but sufficiently intact to house DPs.\r\nAside from its twin towers, little was left of the Frauenkirche. The\r\nbuildings lining the Brienner-Strasse had been blasted and burned. Along\r\nthe short block leading from the Carolinen Platz to the Königsplatz,\r\nthe destruction was total: on the left stood the jagged remnants of the\r\nlittle villa Hitler had given D’Annunzio; on the right was a heap of\r\nrubble which had been the Braun Haus. But practically untouched were the\r\ntwo Ehrentempel—the memorials to the “martyrs” of the 1923 beer-hall\r\n“putsch.” The colonnades were draped with the same kind of green\r\nfishnet that had been used to camouflage the Haus der Deutschen Kunst.\r\nThe classic façades of the museums on either side of the square—the\r\nGlyptothek and the Neue Staatsgalerie—were intact. The buildings\r\nthemselves were a shambles.\r\n\r\nI followed Craig up the broad flight of steps to the entrance of the\r\nVerwaltungsbau, or Administration Building. It was three stories high,\r\nbuilt of stone, and occupied almost an entire block. True to the Nazi\r\nboast, it looked as though it had been built to “last a thousand\r\nyears.” And it was so plain and massive that I didn’t see how it could\r\nchange much in that time. There was nothing here that could “grow old\r\ngracefully.” The interior matched the exterior. There were two great\r\ncentral courts with marble stairs leading to the floor above.\r\n\r\nAlthough the building had not been bombed, it had suffered severely\r\nfrom concussion. Craig said that when he had moved in two weeks ago\r\nthe skylights over the courts had been open to the sky. On rainy days\r\none could practically go boating on the first floor. There had been no\r\nglass in the windows. Now they had been boarded up or filled in with a\r\ntranslucent material as a substitute. All of the doors had been out of\r\nline and would not lock. But the repairs were already well under way\r\nand, according to Craig, the place would be shipshape in another month\r\nor six weeks. He said that his colleague, Hamilton Coulter, a former New\r\nYork architect now a naval lieutenant, was directing the work and doing\r\na magnificent job. Even under normal conditions it would have been a\r\nstaggering task. With glass and lumber at a premium, to say nothing of\r\nthe scarcity of skilled labor, a less resourceful man would have given up\r\nin despair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vermeer’s _Portrait of the Artist in His Studio_ in the\r\nAlt Aussee mine was purchased by Hitler for his proposed museum. It has\r\nbeen returned to Vienna.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One of the picture storage rooms in the mine, constructed\r\nwith wooden partitions and racks. The temperature was constant, averaging\r\n40° Fahrenheit in summer, 47° in winter.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Panel from the Louvain altarpiece, _Feast of the\r\nPassover_, by Bouts, was stored at Alt Aussee.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hitler acquired the Czernin Vermeer for an alleged price\r\nof 1,400,000 Reichsmarks.]\r\n\r\nCraig was rapidly building up a staff of German scholars and museum\r\ntechnicians to assist him in the administration of the establishment.\r\nIt would soon rival a large American museum in complexity and scope.\r\nStorage rooms on the ground floor had been made weatherproof. Paintings\r\nand sculpture were already pouring in from the mine at Alt Aussee—six\r\ntruckloads at a time. In accordance with standard museum practice, Craig\r\nhad set up an efficient accessioning system. As each object came in, it\r\nwas identified, marked and listed for future reference. Quarters had been\r\nset aside for a photographer. Racks were being built for pictures. A\r\ntwo-storied record room was being converted into a library.\r\n\r\nCraig had also requisitioned the “twin” of this colossal building—the\r\nFührerbau, where Hitler had had his own offices. This was only a\r\nblock away on the same street and also faced the Königsplatz. It was\r\nconnected with the Verwaltungsbau by underground passageways. It was in\r\nthe Führerbau that the Munich Pact of 1938—the pact that was to have\r\nguaranteed “peace in our time”—had been signed. Craig showed me the table\r\nat which Mr. Chamberlain had signed that document. Craig was using it now\r\nfor a conference table.\r\n\r\nRepairs were being concentrated on the Administration Building, since its\r\n“twin” was being held in reserve for later use. At the moment, however, a\r\nfew of the rooms were occupied by a small guard detail. The truck drivers\r\nand armed guards who came each week with the convoys from the mine were\r\nalso billeted there.\r\n\r\nJust as Craig and I were finishing our inspection of the Führerbau,\r\na convoy of six trucks, escorted by two half-tracks, pulled into the\r\nparking space behind the building. The convoy leader had a letter for\r\nme. It was the one George Stout had mentioned on the telephone. Lincoln\r\nwas right. The repository George had in mind was the monastery at\r\nHohenfurth. In his letter he stressed the fact that the evacuation should\r\nbe undertaken at once. He suggested that I try to persuade Posey to send\r\nLincoln along to help me.\r\n\r\nCraig had a comfortable billet in the Kopernikus-Strasse, a four-room\r\nflat on the fourth floor of a modern apartment building. The back windows\r\nlooked onto a garden. Over the tops of the poplar trees beyond, one could\r\nsee the roof of the Prinz Regenten Theater where, back in the twenties, I\r\nhad seen my first complete performance of Wagner’s _Ring_. Craig told me\r\nthat the theater was undamaged except for the Speisesaal where, in prewar\r\ndays, lavish refreshments were served during intermissions. That one room\r\nhad caught a bomb.\r\n\r\nI accepted Craig’s invitation to share the apartment with him while\r\nin Munich and made myself at home in the dining room. It had a couch,\r\nand there was a sideboard which I could use as a chest of drawers. The\r\nbathroom was across the hall and he said that the supply of hot water\r\nwas inexhaustible. By comparison, the officers’ billets at Third Army\r\nHeadquarters were tenements.\r\n\r\nHam Coulter had similar quarters on the ground floor. We stopped there\r\nfor a drink on our way to supper at the Military Government Detachment.\r\n“Civilized” was the word that best described Ham. He was a tall,\r\nbroad-shouldered fellow with sleek black hair, finely-chiseled features\r\nand keen, gray eyes. When he smiled, his mouth crinkled up at the\r\ncorners, producing an agreeably sarcastic expression. Ham poured out the\r\ndrinks with an elegance the ordinary German cognac didn’t deserve. They\r\nshould have been dry martinis. I liked him at once that first evening,\r\nand when I came to know him better I found him the wittiest and most\r\namiable of companions. He and Craig were a wonderful combination. They\r\nhad the greatest admiration and respect for each other, and during\r\nthe many months of their work together there was not the slightest\r\ndisagreement between them.\r\n\r\nThe officers’ dining room that evening was a noisy place. The clatter\r\nof knives and forks and the babble of voices mingled with the rasping\r\nstrains of popular American tunes pounded out by a Bavarian band. As we\r\nwere about to sit down, the music stopped abruptly and a second later\r\nstruck up the current favorite, “My Dreams Are Getting Better All the\r\nTime.” Colonel Charles Keegan, the commanding officer, had entered the\r\ndining hall. I was puzzled by this until Ham told me that it happened\r\nevery night. This particular piece was the colonel’s favorite tune and he\r\nhad ordered it to be played whenever he came in to dinner. The colonel\r\nwas a colorful character—short and florid, with a shock of white hair.\r\nHe had figured prominently in New York politics and would again, it was\r\nsaid. He had already helped Craig over a couple of rough spots and if\r\nsome of his antics amused the MFA&A boys, they seemed to be genuinely\r\nfond of him.\r\n\r\nWhile we were at dinner, three officers came and took their places at\r\na near-by table. Craig identified one of them as Captain Posey. I had\r\nbeen told that he was in his middle thirties, but he looked younger than\r\nthat. He had a boyish face and I noticed that he laughed a great deal as\r\nhe talked with his two companions. When he wasn’t smiling, there was a\r\nstubborn expression about his mouth, and I remembered that Lincoln had\r\nsaid something about his “deceptively gentle manner.” On our way out I\r\nintroduced myself to him. He was very affable and seemed pleased at my\r\narrival. But he was tired after the long drive from Frankfurt, so, as\r\nsoon as I had arranged to meet him at his office the next day, I joined\r\nHam and Craig back at the apartment.\r\n\r\nI got out to Third Army Headquarters early the following morning and\r\nfound Captain Posey already at his desk, going through the papers which\r\nhad accumulated during his absence. We discussed George’s letter at\r\nconsiderable length, and I was disappointed to find that he did not\r\nintend to act on it at once. Somehow it had never occurred to me that\r\nanyone would question a proposal of George’s.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, Captain Posey said, he couldn’t spare Lincoln; and for\r\nanother, there was a very pressing job much nearer Munich which he wanted\r\nme to handle. He then proceeded to tell me of a small village on the road\r\nto Salzburg where I would find a house in which were stored some eighty\r\ncases of paintings and sculpture from the Budapest Museum. He showed me\r\nthe place on the map and explained how I was to go about locating the\r\nexact house upon arrival. I was to see a certain officer at Third Army\r\nHeadquarters without delay and make arrangements for trucks. He thought I\r\nwould need about five. It shouldn’t take more than half a day to do the\r\njob if all went well. After this preliminary briefing, I was on my own.\r\n\r\nMy first move was to get hold of the officer about the trucks. How many\r\ndid I need? When did I want them and where should he tell them to report?\r\nI said I’d like to have five trucks at the Königsplatz the following\r\nmorning at eight-thirty. The officer explained that the drivers would be\r\nFrench, as Third Army was using a number of foreign trucking companies to\r\nrelieve the existing shortage in transportation.\r\n\r\nLater in the day I had a talk with Lincoln about my plans and he gave me\r\na piece of advice which proved exceedingly valuable—that I should go\r\nmyself to the trucking company which was to provide the vehicles, and\r\npersonally confirm the arrangements. So, after lunch I struck out in a\r\njeep for the west side of Munich, a distance of some seven or eight miles.\r\n\r\nI found a lieutenant, who had charge of the outfit, and explained the\r\npurpose of my visit. He had not been notified of the order for five\r\ntrucks. There was no telephone communication between his office and\r\nheadquarters, so all messages had to come by courier, and the courier\r\nhadn’t come in that day. He was afraid he couldn’t let me have any trucks\r\nbefore the following afternoon. I insisted that the matter was urgent and\r\ncouldn’t wait, and, after much deliberating and consulting of charts, he\r\nrelented. I told him a little something about the expedition for which I\r\nwanted the trucks and he showed real interest. He suggested that I ought\r\nto have extremely careful drivers. I replied that I should indeed, as we\r\nwould be hauling stuff of incalculable value.\r\n\r\nThereupon he gave me a harrowing description of the group under his\r\nsupervision. All of them had been members of the French Resistance\r\nMovement—ex-terrorists he called them—and they weren’t afraid of God,\r\nman or the Devil. Well, I thought, isn’t that comforting! “Oh, yes,” he\r\nsaid, “these Frenchies drive like crazy men. But,” he continued, “one\r\nof the fellows has got some sense. I’ll see if I can get him for you.”\r\nHe went over to the window that looked out on a parking ground littered\r\nwith vehicles of various kinds. Here and there I saw a mechanic bent over\r\nan open hood or sprawled out beneath a truck. The lieutenant bellowed,\r\n“Leclancher, come up here to my office!”\r\n\r\nA few seconds later a wiry, sandy-haired Frenchman of about forty-five\r\nappeared in the doorway. Leclancher understood some English, for he\r\nreacted with alert nods of the head as the lieutenant gave a brief\r\ndescription of the job ahead, and then turned and asked me if I spoke\r\nFrench. I told him I did, if he had enough patience. This struck him as\r\ninordinately funny, but I was being quite serious. What really pleased\r\nhim was the fact that I was in the Navy. He said that he had been in\r\nthe Navy during the first World War. Then and there a lasting bond was\r\nformed, though I didn’t appreciate the value of it at the time.\r\n\r\nEight-thirty the next morning found me pacing the Königsplatz. Not\r\na truck in sight. Nine o’clock and still no trucks. At nine thirty,\r\none truck rolled up. Leclancher leaped out and with profuse apologies\r\nexplained that the other four were having carburetor trouble. There\r\nhad been water in the gas, too, and that hadn’t helped. For an hour\r\nLeclancher and I idled about, whiling away the time with conversation\r\nof no consequence, other than that it served to limber up my French. At\r\neleven o’clock Leclancher looked at his watch and said that it would\r\nsoon be time for lunch. It was obvious that he understood the Army’s\r\nconception of a day as a brief span of time, in the course of which one\r\neats three meals. If it is not possible to finish a given job during the\r\nshort pauses between those meals, well, there’s always the next day. I\r\ntold him to go to his lunch and to come back as soon as he could round up\r\nthe other trucks. In the meantime I would get something to eat near by.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned shortly after eleven thirty—having eaten a K ration under\r\nthe portico of the Verwaltungsbau in lieu of a more formal lunch—my\r\nfive trucks were lined up ready to go. I appointed Leclancher “chef de\r\nconvoi”—a rather high-sounding title for such a modest caravan—and he\r\nassigned positions to the other drivers, taking the end truck himself.\r\nSince my jeep failed to arrive, I climbed into the lead truck. The driver\r\nwas an amiable youngster whose name was Roger Roget. During the next\r\nfew weeks he was the lead driver in all of my expeditions, and I took to\r\ncalling him “Double Roger,” which I think he never quite understood.\r\n\r\nTo add to my anxiety over our belated start, a light rain began to fall\r\nas we pulled out of the Königsplatz and turned into the Brienner-Strasse.\r\nWe threaded our way cautiously through the slippery streets choked with\r\nmilitary traffic, crossed the bridge over the Isar and swung into the\r\nbroad Rosenheimer-Strasse leading to the east.\r\n\r\nOnce on the Autobahn, Roger speeded up. The speedometer needle quivered\r\nup to thirty-five, forty and finally forty-five miles an hour. I pointed\r\nto it, shaking my head. “We must not exceed thirty-five, Roger.”\r\n\r\nHe promptly slowed down, and as we rolled along, I forgot the worries\r\nof the morning. I dozed comfortably. Suddenly we struck an unexpected\r\nhole in the road and I woke up. We were doing fifty. This time I spoke\r\nsharply, reminding Roger that the speed limit was thirty-five and that we\r\nwere to stay within it; if we didn’t we’d be arrested, because the road\r\nwas well patrolled. With a tolerant grin Roger said, “Oh, no, we never\r\nget arrested. The MPs, they stop us and get very angry, but—” with a\r\nshrug of the shoulders—“we do not understand. They throw the hands up in\r\nthe air and say ‘dumb Frenchies’ and we go ahead.”\r\n\r\n“That may work with you,” I said crossly, “but what about me? I’m not a\r\n‘dumb Frenchy.’”\r\n\r\nFor the next hour I pretended to doze and at the same time kept an eye on\r\nthe speedometer. This worked pretty well. Now and again I would look up,\r\nand each time, Roger would modify his speed.\r\n\r\nPresently we came to a bad detour, where a bridge was out. We had to\r\nmake a sharp turn to the left, leave the Autobahn and descend a steep\r\nand tortuous side road into a deep ravine. That day the narrow road was\r\nslippery from the rain, so we had to crawl along. The drop into the\r\nvalley was a matter of two or three hundred feet and, as we reached\r\nthe bottom, we could see the monstrous wreckage of the bridge hanging\r\ndrunkenly in mid-air. The ascent was even more precarious, but our five\r\ntrucks got through.\r\n\r\nWe had now left the level country around Munich and were in a region of\r\nrolling hills. Along the horizon, gray clouds half concealed the distant\r\npeaks. Soon the rain stopped and the sun came out. The mountains changed\r\nto misty blue against an even bluer sky. The road rose sharply, and when\r\nwe reached the crest, I caught a glimpse of shimmering water. It was\r\nChiemsee, largest of the Bavarian lakes.\r\n\r\nIn another ten minutes the road flattened out again and we came to the\r\nturnoff marked “Prien.” There we left the Autobahn for a narrow side\r\nroad which took us across green meadows. Nothing could have looked more\r\npeaceful than this lush, summer countryside. Reports of SS troops still\r\nhiding out in the near-by forests seemed preposterous in the pastoral\r\ntranquillity. Yet only a few days before, our troops had rounded up a\r\nsmall band of these die-hards in this neighborhood. The SS men had come\r\ndown from the foothills on a foraging expedition and had been captured\r\nwhile attempting to raid a farmhouse. It was because of just such\r\nincidents, as well as the ever-present fire hazard, that I had been sent\r\ndown to remove the museum treasures to a place of safety.\r\n\r\nThe road was dwindling away to a cow path and I was beginning to wonder\r\nhow much farther we could go with our two-and-a-half-ton trucks, when we\r\ncame to a small cluster of houses. This was Grassau. I had been told\r\nthat a small detachment of troops was billeted there, so I singled out\r\nthe largest of the little white houses grouped around the only crossroads\r\nin the village. It had clouded over and begun to rain again. As I entered\r\nthe gate and was crossing the yard, the door of the house was opened by a\r\ncorporal.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t seem surprised to see me. Someone at Munich had sent down word\r\nto Prien that I was coming, and the message had reached him from there. I\r\nasked if he knew where the things I had come for were stored. He motioned\r\nto the back of the house and said there were two rooms full of big\r\npacking cases. He explained that he and one other man had been detailed\r\nto live in the house because of the “stuff” stored there. They had been\r\ninstructed to keep an eye on the old man who claimed to be responsible\r\nfor it. That would be Dr. Csanky, director of the Budapest Museum, who,\r\naccording to my information, would probably raise unqualified hell when I\r\ncame to cart away his precious cases. The corporal told me that the old\r\nman and his son occupied rooms on the second floor.\r\n\r\nI was relieved to hear that they were not at home. It would make things\r\nmuch simpler if I could get my trucks loaded and be on my way before\r\nthey returned. It was already well after two and I wanted to start back\r\nby five at the latest. I asked rather tentatively about the chances of\r\ngetting local talent to help with the loading, and the corporal promptly\r\noffered to corral a gang of PWs who were working under guard near by.\r\n\r\nWhile he went off to see about that, I marshaled my trucks. There was\r\nenough room to back one truck at a time to the door of the house. A few\r\nminutes later the motley “work party” arrived. There were eight of them\r\nin all and they ranged from a young fellow of sixteen, wearing a faded\r\nGerman uniform, to a reedy old man of sixty. By and large, they looked\r\nhusky enough for the job.\r\n\r\nI knew enough not to ask my drivers to help, but knew that the work would\r\ngo much faster if they would lend a hand. Leclancher must have read my\r\nthoughts, for he immediately offered his services. As soon as the other\r\nfour saw what Leclancher was doing, they followed suit.\r\n\r\nThere were eighty-one cases in all. They varied greatly in size, because\r\nsome of them contained sculpture and, consequently, were both bulky and\r\nheavy. Others, built for big canvases, were very large and flat but\r\nrelatively light. We had to “design” our loads in such a way as to keep\r\ncases of approximately the same type together. This was necessary for\r\ntwo reasons: first, the cases would ride better that way, and second, we\r\nhadn’t any too much space. As I roughly figured it, we should be able to\r\nget them all in the five trucks, but we couldn’t afford to be prodigal in\r\nour loading.\r\n\r\nThe work went along smoothly for an hour and we were just finishing the\r\nsecond truck when I saw two men approaching. They were Dr. Csanky and\r\nhis son. This was what I had hoped to avoid. The doctor was a dapper\r\nlittle fellow with a white mustache and very black eyes. He was wearing\r\na corduroy jacket and a flowing bow tie. The artistic effect was topped\r\noff by a beret set at a jaunty angle. His son was a callow string bean\r\nwith objectionably soulful eyes magnified by horn-rimmed spectacles. They\r\ncame over to the truck and began to jabber and wave their arms. We paid\r\nno attention whatever—just kept on methodically lifting one case after\r\nanother out of the storage room.\r\n\r\nThe dapper doctor got squarely in my path and I had to stop. I checked\r\nhis flow of words with a none too civil “Do you speak English?” That drew\r\na blank, so I asked if he spoke German. No luck there either. Feeling\r\nlike an ad for the Berlitz School, I inquired whether he spoke French.\r\nHe said “Yes,” but the stream of Hungarian-French which rolled out from\r\nthat white mustache was unintelligible. It was hopeless. At last I simply\r\nhad to take him by the shoulders and gently but firmly set him aside.\r\nThis was the ultimate indignity, but it worked. At that juncture he and\r\nthe string bean took off. I didn’t know what they were up to and I didn’t\r\ncare, so long as they left us alone.\r\n\r\nOur respite was short-lived. By the time we had the third truck ready to\r\nmove away, they were back. And they had come with reinforcements: two\r\nwomen were with them. One was a rather handsome dowager who looked out of\r\nplace in this rural setting. Her gray hair, piled high, was held in place\r\nby a scarlet bandanna, and she was wearing a shabby dress of green silk.\r\nDespite this getup, there was something rather commanding about her. She\r\nintroduced herself as the wife of General Ellenlittay and explained in\r\nperfect English that Dr. Csanky had come to her in great distress. Would\r\nI be so kind as to tell her what was happening so that she could inform\r\nhim?\r\n\r\n“I am removing these cases on the authority of the Commanding General\r\nof the Third United States Army,” I said. If she were going to throw\r\ngenerals’ names around, I could produce one too—and a better one at that.\r\n\r\nHer response to my pompous pronouncement was delivered charmingly and\r\nwith calculated deflationary effect. “Dear sir, forgive me if I seemed to\r\nquestion your authority. That was not my intention. It is quite apparent\r\nthat you are removing the pictures, but where are you taking them?”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry, but I am not at liberty to say,” I replied. That too\r\nsounded rather lordly, but I consoled myself by recalling that Posey had\r\nadmonished me not to answer questions like that.\r\n\r\nShe relayed this information to Dr. Csanky and the effect was\r\nstartling. He covered his face with his hands and I thought he was going\r\nto cry. Finally he pulled himself together and let forth a flood of\r\nunintelligible consonants. His interpreter tackled me again.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Csanky is frantic. He says that he is responsible to his government\r\nfor the safety of these treasures and since you are taking them away,\r\nthere is nothing left for him to do but to blow his brains out.”\r\n\r\nMy patience was exhausted. I said savagely, “Tell Dr. Csanky for me that\r\nhe can blow his brains out if he chooses, but I think it would be silly.\r\nIf you must know, Madame, I am a museum director myself and you can\r\nassure him that no harm is going to come to his precious pictures.”\r\n\r\nI should never have mentioned that I had even so much as been inside\r\na museum, for, from that moment until we finished loading the last\r\ntruck, the little doctor never left my side. I was his “cher collègue,”\r\nand he kept up a steady barrage of questions which the patient Madame\r\nEllenlittay tried to pass along to me without interrupting our work.\r\n\r\nAs we lined the trucks up, preparatory to starting back to Munich, Dr.\r\nCsanky produced several long lists of what the cases contained. He asked\r\nme to sign them. This I refused to do but explained to him through\r\nthe general’s wife that if he cared to have the lists translated from\r\nHungarian and forwarded to Third Army Headquarters, they could be checked\r\nagainst the contents and eventually returned to him with a notation to\r\nthat effect.\r\n\r\nOur little convoy rolled out of Grassau at six o’clock, leaving the group\r\nof Hungarians waving forlornly from the corner. Just before we turned\r\nonto the Autobahn, Leclancher signaled from the rear truck for us to\r\nstop. He came panting up to the lead truck with a bottle in his hand.\r\nWith a gallant wave of the arm he said that we must drink to the success\r\nof the expedition. It was a bottle of Calvados—fiery and wonderful. We\r\neach took a generous swig and then—with a rowdy “en voiture!”—we were on\r\nour way again. It was a nice gesture.\r\n\r\nThe trip back to Munich was uneventful except for the extraordinary\r\nbeauty of the long summer evening. The sunset had all the extravagance\r\nof the tropics. The sky blazed with opalescent clouds. As we drove into\r\nMunich, the whole city was suffused with a coral light which produced\r\na more authentic atmosphere of Götterdämmerung than the most ingenious\r\nstage Merlin could have contrived.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly nine when we rolled into the parking area behind the\r\nFührerbau—too late to think about unloading and also, I was afraid, too\r\nlate to get any supper. We had pieced out with K rations and candy bars,\r\nbut were still hungry. A mess sergeant, lolling on the steps of the\r\nbuilding, reluctantly produced some lukewarm stew. After we had eaten, I\r\nprevailed on one of the building guards to take my five drivers out to\r\ntheir billets south of town. It was Saturday night. I told Leclancher we\r\nwould probably be making a longer trip on Monday and that I would need\r\nten drivers. He promised to select five more good men, and we arranged to\r\nmeet in the square as we had that morning. But Monday, he promised, they\r\nwould be on time.\r\n\r\nAfter checking the tarpaulins on my five trucks, I sauntered over to the\r\nCentral Collecting Point on the off-chance that Craig might be working\r\nlate. I found him looking at some of the pictures which George had sent\r\nin that day from the mine. The German packers whom Craig had been able to\r\nhire from one of the old established firms in Munich—one which had worked\r\nexclusively for the museums there—had finished unloading the trucks only\r\na couple of hours earlier. Most of the things in this shipment had\r\nbeen found at the mine, so now the pictures were stacked according to\r\nsize in neat rows about the room. In one of them we found two brilliant\r\nportraits by Mme. Vigée-Lebrun. Labels on the front identified them as\r\nthe likenesses of Prince Schuvalov and of the Princess Golowine. Marks\r\non the back indicated that they were from the Lanckoroncki Collection\r\nin Vienna, one of the most famous art collections in Europe. Hitler was\r\nrumored to have acquired it en bloc—through forced sale, it was said—for\r\nthe great museum he planned to build at Linz. In another stack we came\r\nupon a superb Rubens landscape, a fine portrait by Hals and two sparkling\r\nallegorical scenes by Tiepolo. These had no identifying labels other\r\nthan the numbers which referred to lists we didn’t have at the moment.\r\nHowever, Craig said that the documentation on the pictures, as a whole,\r\nwas surprisingly complete. Then we ran into a lot of nineteenth century\r\nGerman masters—Lenbach, Spitzweg, Thoma and the like. These Hitler had\r\nparticularly admired, but they didn’t thrill me. I was getting sleepy and\r\nsuggested that we had had enough art for one day. I still had a report of\r\nthe day’s doings to write up for Captain Posey before I could turn in, so\r\nwe padlocked the room and took off.\r\n\r\nEven though the next day was Sunday, it was not a day of rest for me.\r\nThe trek to Hohenfurth, scheduled for Monday, involved infinitely more\r\ncomplicated preliminary arrangements than the easy run of yesterday.\r\nCaptain Posey got out maps of the area into which the convoy would be\r\ntraveling; gave me the names of specific outfits from whom I would have\r\nto obtain clearance as well as escorts along the way; and, most important\r\nof all, supplied information concerning the material to be transported.\r\nNone of it, I learned, was cased. He thought it consisted mainly of\r\npaintings, but there was probably also some furniture. This wasn’t too\r\ndefinite. Nor did we have a very clear idea as to the exact number of\r\ntrucks we would need. I had spoken for ten on the theory that a larger\r\nnumber would make too cumbersome a convoy. At least I didn’t want to be\r\nresponsible for more at that stage of the game, inexperienced as I was.\r\nIn the circumstances, two seasoned packers might, I thought, come in\r\nhandy, so I was to see if I could borrow a couple of Craig’s men. There\r\nwas the problem of rations for the trip up and back. Posey procured a big\r\nsupply of C rations, not so good as the K’s, but they would do. While at\r\nHohenfurth we would be fed by the American outfit stationed there. It was\r\na good thing that there was so much to be arranged, because it kept me\r\nfrom worrying about a lot of things that could and many that did happen\r\non that amazing expedition.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I went out to make sure of my trucks and on the way back\r\nput in a bid for the two packers. My request wasn’t very popular, because\r\nCraig was shorthanded, but he thought he could spare two since it was to\r\nbe only a three-day trip—one day to go up, one day at Hohenfurth, and\r\nthen back the third day. Craig gloomily predicted that I’d never get ten\r\ntrucks loaded in one day, but I airily tossed that off with the argument\r\nthat we had loaded five trucks at Grassau in less than four hours. “But\r\nthat stuff was all in cases,” he said. “You’ll find it slow going with\r\nloose pictures.” Of course he was right, but I didn’t believe it at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(4)\r\n\r\n_MASTERPIECES IN A MONASTERY_\r\n\r\n\r\nWe woke up to faultless weather the following morning, and on the way\r\ndown to the Königsplatz with Craig I was in an offensively optimistic\r\nframe of mind. All ten of my trucks were there. This was more like it—no\r\ntiresome mechanical delays. We were all set to go. Leclancher had even\r\nhad the foresight to bring along an extra driver, just in case anything\r\nhappened to one of the ten. That was a smart idea and I congratulated him\r\nfor having thought of it.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t till I started distributing the rations that I discovered our\r\ntwo packers were missing. But that shouldn’t take long to straighten\r\nout. Craig’s office was just across the way. I found them cooling their\r\nheels in the anteroom. They looked as though they had come right out of\r\nan Arthur Rackham illustration—stocky little fellows with gnarled hands\r\nand wizened faces as leathery as the _Lederhosen_ they were wearing. Each\r\nwore a coal-scuttle hat with a jaunty feather, and each had a bulging\r\nbandanna attached to the end of a stick. There was much bowing and\r\nscraping. The hats were doffed and there was the familiar “Grüss Gott,\r\nHerr Kapitän,” when I walked in.\r\n\r\nCraig appeared and explained the difficulty. Until the last minute, no\r\none had thought to ask whether the men had obtained a Military Government\r\npermit to leave the area—and of course they hadn’t. With all due respect\r\nto the workings of Military Government, I knew that it would take hours,\r\neven days, to obtain the permits. So, what to do? I asked Craig what\r\nwould happen if they went without them. He didn’t know. But if anyone\r\nfound out about it, there would be trouble. I didn’t see any reason why\r\nanyone should find out about it. The men would be in my charge and I said\r\nI’d assume all responsibility.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the two Rackham characters were shifting uneasily from one foot\r\nto the other, looking first at Craig and then at me, without the faintest\r\nidea what the fuss was all about. Craig reluctantly left it up to me. Not\r\nwanting to waste any more time, I told the little fellows that everything\r\nwas “in Ordnung” and bundled them off to the waiting trucks.\r\n\r\nAgain our way led out to the east, the same road we had taken two days\r\nbefore; and again I was perched up in the lead truck with Double Roger.\r\nThe country was more beautiful than ever in the morning sunlight.\r\nWe skirted the edge of Chiemsee and sped on through Traunstein. The\r\nmountains loomed closer, their crests gleaming with snow. Roger commented\r\nthat it was “_la neige éternelle_,” and I was struck by the unconscious\r\npoetry of the phrase.\r\n\r\nTo save time we ate our midday rations en route, pulling off to one side\r\nof the Autobahn in the neighborhood of Bad Reichenhall. Farther on we\r\ncame to a fork in the highway. A sign to the right pointed temptingly\r\nto Berchtesgaden, only thirty kilometers away. But our road was the one\r\nto the left—to Salzburg. In another few minutes we saw its picturesque\r\nfortress, outlined against the sky, high above the town.\r\n\r\nI had to make some inquiries in Salzburg. Not knowing the exact location\r\nof the headquarters where I could obtain the information I needed, I\r\nthought it prudent to park the convoy on the outskirts and go on ahead\r\nwith a single truck. It probably wasn’t going to be any too easy, even\r\nwith exact directions, to get all ten of them through the narrow\r\nstreets, across the river and out the other side. This was where a jeep\r\nwould have come in handy. I had been a fool not to insist on having one\r\nfor this trip.\r\n\r\nLeclancher asked if he might go along with Roger and me. The three of\r\nus drove off, leaving the other nine drivers and the two little packers\r\nto take their ease in the warm meadow beside which we had halted. It\r\nwas about three miles into the center of town and the road was full\r\nof confusing turns. But on the whole it was well marked with Army\r\nsigns. Before the end of the summer I became reasonably proficient in\r\ntranslating the cabalistic symbols on these markers, but at that time\r\nI was hopelessly untutored and neither of my companions was any help.\r\nAfter driving through endless gray archways and being soundly rebuked\r\nby the MPs for going the wrong direction on several one-way streets, we\r\nfound ourselves in a broad square paved with cobblestones. It was the\r\nMozartplatz.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant colonel I was supposed to see had his office in one of the\r\ndove-colored buildings facing the square. It was a big, high-ceilinged\r\nroom with graceful rococo decorations along the walls and a delicate\r\nprism chandelier in the center. I asked the colonel for clearance to\r\nproceed to Linz with my convoy. After I had explained the purpose of my\r\ntrip to Hohenfurth, he offered to expedite the additional clearance I\r\nwould need beyond Linz.\r\n\r\nHe rang up the headquarters of the 65th Infantry Division which was\r\nstationed there. In a few minutes everything had been arranged. The\r\ncolonel at the other end of the line said that he would send one of his\r\nofficers to the outskirts of the city to conduct us to his headquarters\r\non our arrival. There would be no difficulty about billets. He would\r\nalso take care of our clearance across the Czechoslovakian border\r\nthe following day. I thanked the colonel and hurried down to rejoin\r\nLeclancher and Roger.\r\n\r\nSince the proposed Autobahn to Linz had never been finished, we had to\r\ntake a secondary highway east of Salzburg. Our road led through gently\r\nrolling country with mountains in the distance. I was grateful for the\r\nsuccession of villages along the way. They were a relief after the\r\nmonotony of the Autobahn and also served to control the speed of the\r\nconvoy. We wound through streets so narrow that one could have reached\r\nout and touched the potted geraniums which lined the balconies of the\r\ncottages on either side. Laughing, towheaded children waved from the\r\ndoorways as we passed by. Roger, intent on his driving, didn’t respond to\r\nthe exuberance of the youngsters, and I wondered if he might be thinking\r\nof the villages of his own country, where the invaders had left a bitter\r\nlegacy of wan faces.\r\n\r\nIt was after seven when we reached the battered outskirts of Linz, the\r\ncity of Hitler’s special adoration. He had lavished his attention on the\r\nprovincial old town, his mother’s birthplace, hoping to make it a serious\r\nrival of Vienna as an art center. To this end, plans for a magnificent\r\nmuseum had been drawn up, and already an impressive collection of\r\npictures had been assembled against the day when a suitable building\r\nwould be ready to receive them.\r\n\r\nWe approached the city from the west—its most damaged sector. It was\r\nrough going, as the streets were full of chuckholes and narrowed by piles\r\nof rubble heaped high on both sides. There was no sign of an escort,\r\nso we drew up beside an information post at a main intersection. Our\r\ncavalcade was too large to miss, as long as we stayed in one place.\r\nWe waited nearly an hour before a jeep came along. A jaunty young\r\nlieutenant came over, introduced himself as the colonel’s “emissary”\r\nand said that he had been combing the town for us. The confusion of\r\nthe debris-filled streets had caused us to take a wrong turn and,\r\nconsequently, we had missed the main thoroughfare into town. The\r\nlieutenant, whose name was George Anderson, led us by a devious route\r\nto a large, barrackslike building with a forecourt which afforded\r\nample parking space for the trucks. Billets had already been arranged,\r\nas promised, but to get food at such a late hour was another matter.\r\nHowever, by dint of coaxing in the right quarter, Anderson even contrived\r\nto do that.\r\n\r\nAs we drove off in his jeep to the hotel where the officers were\r\nbilleted, he remarked with a laugh that he wouldn’t be able to do as\r\nwell by me but thought he could dig up something. The hotel was called\r\nthe “Weinzinger,” and Anderson said that Hitler had often stayed there.\r\nLeaving me to get settled, he went off on a foraging expedition. He\r\nreturned shortly with an armful of rations, a bottle of cognac and a\r\nsmall contraption that looked like a tin case for playing cards. This\r\ningenious little device, with a turn of the wrist, opened out into a\r\nminiature stove. Fuel for it came in the form of white lozenges that\r\nresembled moth balls. Two of these, lighted simultaneously, produced a\r\nflame of such intensity that one could boil water in less than a quarter\r\nof an hour. I got out my mess kit while Anderson opened the rations, and\r\nin ten minutes we whipped up a hot supper of lamb stew. With a generous\r\nslug of cognac for appetizer, the lack of variety in the menu was\r\ncompletely forgotten.\r\n\r\nWhile we topped off with chocolate bars, I asked him about conditions up\r\nthe line in the direction of Hohenfurth.\r\n\r\n“You won’t have any trouble once you reach Hohenfurth, because it’s\r\noccupied by our troops,” he said, “but before swinging north into\r\nCzechoslovakia you’ll have to pass through Russian-held Austrian\r\nterritory.”\r\n\r\nThis was bad news, for I had no clearance from the Russians. I hadn’t\r\nforeseen the need of it. Captain Posey couldn’t have known about it\r\neither because he was punctilious and would never have let me start off\r\nwithout the necessary papers.\r\n\r\nI had heard stories of the attitude of the Russians toward anyone\r\nentering their territory without proper authorization. An officer in\r\nMunich told me that his convoy had been stopped. He had been subjected to\r\na series of interrogations and not allowed to proceed for a week.\r\n\r\n“Could your colonel obtain clearance for me from the Russians?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“He could try, but it would probably take weeks,” Anderson said. “If\r\nyou’re in a hurry, your best bet is to take a chance and go on through\r\nwithout clearance. You never can tell about the Russians. They might stop\r\nyou and again they might not.”\r\n\r\nThen I mentioned my problem children—my German packers. Anderson didn’t\r\nthink the Russians would look on them with much favor, if my trucks were\r\nstopped and inspected. I asked about another road to Hohenfurth. Perhaps\r\nthere was one to the west of the Russian lines. He didn’t know about any\r\nother route but said that we could take a look at the big map in the\r\nO.D.’s office on the next floor.\r\n\r\nTo my great relief, it appeared that there was another road—one which ran\r\nparallel with the main road, four or five miles to the west of it. But\r\nAnderson tempered enthusiasm with the remark that it might not be wide\r\nenough for my two-and-a-half-ton trucks. There was nothing on the map to\r\nindicate whether it was much more than a cow path and the duty officer\r\ndidn’t know. One of the other officers might be able to tell me. I could\r\nask in the morning.\r\n\r\nThat night I worried a good deal about the hazards that seemed to lie\r\nahead, and woke up feeling depressed. Things, I reflected, had been going\r\ntoo well. I should have guessed that there would be rough spots here and\r\nthere. After early breakfast I called to thank the colonel, Anderson’s\r\nchief, for his kindness, and while in his office had a chance to inquire\r\nabout the alternate route.\r\n\r\n“The back road is all right,” he said without hesitation. “Take it by\r\nall means. You will cross the Czech frontier just north of Leonfelden.\r\nA telephone call to our officer at the border control will fix that up.\r\nYou should be able to make Hohenfurth in about two hours. The C.O. at\r\nHohenfurth is Lieutenant Colonel Sheehan of the 263rd Field Artillery\r\nBattalion.”\r\n\r\nOn my way through the outer office I stopped for a word with Lieutenant\r\nAnderson, and while there the colonel gave instructions about the call\r\nto the border control post. That done, Anderson said, “If you’ve got a\r\nminute, there’s something I want to show you.” I followed him down the\r\nstairs and through the back entrance of the hotel to the broad esplanade\r\nbeside the Danube. The river was beautiful that morning. Its swiftly\r\nflowing waters were really blue.\r\n\r\nWe walked over to the river where a white yacht tugged at her moorings.\r\nShe was the _Ungaria_, presented by Hitler to Admiral Horthy, the\r\nHungarian Regent. Anderson took me aboard and we made a tour of her\r\nluxurious cabins. She was about a hundred twenty feet over all and her\r\nfittings were lavish to the last detail. The vessel was now in the\r\ncustody of the American authorities, but her original crew was still\r\naboard.\r\n\r\nAfter this unexpected nautical adventure, Anderson took me to my trucks\r\nand saw us off on the last lap of the journey. Beyond Urfahr, the town\r\nacross the Danube from Linz, we turned north. It was slow going for\r\nthe convoy because the road was steep and winding. Our progress was\r\nfurther impeded by an endless line of horse-drawn carts and wagons, all\r\nmoving in the direction of Linz. Most of them were filled with household\r\nfurnishings. Presently the road straightened out and we entered a region\r\nof rolling, upland meadows and deep pine forests. After an hour and a\r\nhalf’s drive we reached Leonfelden, a pretty village with a seventeenth\r\ncentury church nestling in a shallow valley. Just beyond it was the\r\nfrontier. We identified ourselves to the two officers—one American, the\r\nother Czech—and continued on our way. Our entry into Czechoslovakia had\r\nbeen singularly undramatic. In another twenty minutes we pulled into\r\nHohenfurth.\r\n\r\nIt was not a particularly prepossessing village on first sight. Drab,\r\none-story houses lined the one main street. The headquarters of the 263rd\r\nField Artillery Battalion occupied an unpretentious corner building.\r\nLieutenant Colonel John R. Sheehan, the C.O., was a big, amiable fellow,\r\nwith a Boston-Irish accent.\r\n\r\n“If you’ve come for that stuff in the monastery,” he said, “just tell\r\nme what you need and I’ll see that you get it. I’m anxious to get the\r\nplace cleared out because we’re not going to be here much longer. When we\r\nleave, the Czechs are going to take over.” The colonel called for Major\r\nColeman W. Thacher, his “Exec,” a pleasant young Bostonian, and told him\r\nto see that I was properly taken care of. The major, in turn, instructed\r\nhis sergeant to show me the way to the monastery and to provide billets\r\nfor my men.\r\n\r\nIt was after eleven, but the sergeant said we’d have time to take a look\r\nat the monastery before chow. He suggested that we take the trucks to\r\nthe monastery, which was not more than three-quarters of a mile from\r\nheadquarters. We drove down a narrow side street to the outskirts of\r\ntown. The small villas on either side were being used for officers’\r\nbillets. The street ended abruptly, and up ahead to the left, on a slight\r\neminence, I saw the cream-colored walls of the monastery.\r\n\r\nA curving dirt road wound around to the entrance on the west side.\r\nThe monastery consisted of a series of rambling buildings forming two\r\ncourtyards. In the center of the larger of these stood a chapel of\r\nimpressive proportions. An arched passageway, leading through one of the\r\nbuildings on the rim of the enclosure, provided the only means of access\r\nto the main courtyard. It had plenty of “Old World charm” but looked\r\nawfully small in comparison with our trucks.\r\n\r\nLeclancher pooh-poohed my fears and said he’d take his truck through. He\r\ndid—that is, part way through. With a hideous scraping sound the truck\r\ncame to a sudden stop. The bows supporting the tarpaulin had not cleared\r\nthe sloping sides of the pointed arch. This was a fine mess, for it was\r\na good two hundred yards from the entrance to the building, behind the\r\nchapel, in which the things were stored. It would prolong the operation\r\nbeyond all reason if we had to carry them all that way to the trucks.\r\nAnd what if it rained? As if in answer to my apprehension, it suddenly\r\ndid rain, a hard drenching downpour. I should have had more faith in the\r\nresourcefulness of my Frenchmen; at that critical juncture Leclancher\r\nannounced that he had found the solution. The bows of the trucks could be\r\nforced down just enough to clear the archway.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this had been done, nine of the trucks filed through and lined\r\nup alongside the buttresses of the chapel. The tenth remained outside to\r\ntake the drivers and the two packers to chow. After seeing to it that\r\nthey were properly cared for, the sergeant deposited me at the officers’\r\nmess.\r\n\r\nAt lunch, Colonel Sheehan introduced me to the military Government\r\nOfficer of his outfit, Major Lewis W. Whittemore, a bluff Irishman, who\r\ngave me considerable useful information about the setup at the monastery.\r\n\r\n“Mutter, an elderly Austrian, is in charge of the collections stored\r\nthere—a custodian appointed by the Nazis. He is a dependable fellow\r\nso we’ve allowed him to stay on the job. You’ll find him thoroughly\r\nco-operative,” said the major. “One of the buildings of the monastery is\r\nbeing used as a hospital for German wounded.”\r\n\r\n“Are there any monks about the place?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Hitler ran them all out, but a few have returned. When Hohenfurth\r\nis turned over to the Czechs, it will make quite a change in this\r\nSudetenland community. Even the name is going to be changed—to its Czech\r\nequivalent, Vysi Brod. All the signs in town will be printed in Czech,\r\ntoo. It will be the official language. Except for a few families, the\r\nentire population is German.”\r\n\r\n“How will that work?” I asked.\r\n\r\nThe major apparently interpreted my question as an expression\r\nof disapproval of the impending change-over, for he said rather\r\nbelligerently, “The Czechs in this region have had a mighty raw deal from\r\nthe Germans during the past few years.” I rallied weakly with the pious\r\nobservation that two wrongs had never made a right and that I hoped some\r\nsatisfactory solution to the knotty problem could be reached.\r\n\r\nBy the time we had finished lunch the rain had dwindled to a light\r\ndrizzle. I started out on foot to the monastery, leaving word at the\r\ncolonel’s quarters for the sergeant to meet me in the courtyard of the\r\n_Kloster_. He got there about the same time I did, and together we\r\nstarted looking for Dr. Mutter, the Austrian custodian. We went first\r\nto the library of the monastery—a beautiful baroque room lined with\r\nsumptuous bookcases of burled walnut surmounted with elaborate carved and\r\ngilded scroll-shaped decorations. The room was beautifully proportioned,\r\nsome seventy feet long and about forty feet wide. Tall French windows\r\nlooked out on the peaceful monastery garden, which, for lack of care, was\r\nnow overgrown with tangled vines and brambles. Along the opposite side\r\nof the handsome room stood a row of massive sixteenth century Italian\r\nrefectory tables piled high with miscellaneous bric-a-brac: Empire\r\ncandelabra, Moorish plates, Venetian glass, Della Robbia plaques and\r\nPersian ceramics. Across one end, an assortment of Louis Quinze sofas\r\nand chairs seemed equally out of place. What, I wondered, were these\r\nincongruous objects doing in this religious establishment?\r\n\r\nThe explanation was soon forthcoming. The sergeant found Dr. Mutter in\r\na small room adjoining the library. He was a lanky, studious individual\r\nwith a shock of snow-white hair, prominent teeth and a gentle manner\r\nwhich just missed being fawning. Hohenfurth’s Uriah Heep, I thought\r\nunkindly. The moment he began to speak in halting English, I revised my\r\nestimate of him. He was neither crafty nor vicious. On the contrary, he\r\nwas just a timid, and, at the moment, frightened victim of circumstance.\r\nWhat German I know has an Austrian flavor, and when I trotted this out\r\nhe was so embarrassingly happy that I wished I had kept my tongue in\r\nmy head. But it served to establish an _entente cordiale_ which proved\r\nvaluable during the next few days. They were to be more hectic than I had\r\neven faintly imagined.\r\n\r\nAfter a little introductory palaver, I explained that I had come to\r\nremove the collections which had been brought to the monastery by the\r\nGermans, and that I would like to make a preliminary tour of inspection.\r\nI suggested that we look first at the paintings.\r\n\r\n“Paintings?” he asked doubtfully. “You mean the modern pictures? They\r\nare not very good—just the work of some of the Nazi artists. They were\r\nbrought here—and quite a lot of sculpture too—when it was announced that\r\nHitler was coming to Hohenfurth to see the really important things.”\r\n\r\nThen I learned what he meant by the “really important things”—room after\r\nroom, corridor after corridor, all crammed with furniture and sculpture,\r\nmethodically looted from two fabulous collections, the Rothschild of\r\nVienna and the Mannheimer of Amsterdam. By comparison, the Hearst\r\ncollection at Gimbel’s was trifling. The things I had seen in the library\r\nwere only a small part of this mélange. In an adjoining chamber—a vaulted\r\ngallery, fifty feet long—there were a dozen pieces of French and Dutch\r\nmarquetry. And stacked against the walls were entire paneled rooms,\r\ncoffered ceilings and innumerable marble busts. Next to that was a room\r\ncrowded with more of the same sort of thing, except that the pieces were\r\nsmall and more delicate. In one corner I saw an extraordinary table made\r\nentirely of tortoise shell and mounted with exquisite ormolu.\r\n\r\nIt was an antique-hunter’s paradise, but for me quite the reverse. How\r\nwas I going to move all of this stuff? Dr. Mutter could see that I was\r\nperplexed, and apologetically added that I had seen only a part of the\r\ncollections. Remembering that I had asked to see the pictures, he took\r\nme to a corner room containing approximately a hundred canvases. As he\r\nhad said, they were a thoroughly dull lot—portraits of Hitler, Hess\r\nand some of the other Nazi leaders, tiresome allegorical scenes, a few\r\nbattle subjects and a group of landscapes. The labels pasted on the\r\nbacks indicated that they had all been shown at one time or another\r\nin exhibitions at the Haus der Deutschen Kunst in Munich. While I was\r\nlooking at them, Dr. Mutter shyly confessed that he was a painter but\r\nthat he didn’t admire this kind of work.\r\n\r\nOn the floor below, there was a forest of contemporary German\r\nsculpture—plaster casts, for the most part, all patinated to resemble\r\nbronze. In addition there were a few portrait busts in bronze and one\r\nor two pieces in glazed terra cotta. The terra-cotta pieces had some\r\nmerit. The sculpture occupied one entire side of a broad corridor which\r\nran around the four sides of a charming inner garden. The corridor had\r\noriginally been open but the archways were now glassed in. Turning a\r\ncorner, we came upon a jumble of architectural fragments—carved Gothic\r\npinnacles, sections of delicately chiseled moldings, colonnettes,\r\nFlorentine well-heads and wall fountains. At one end was a pair of\r\nelaborate gilded wrought-iron doors and at either side were handsome wall\r\nlanterns, also of wrought iron. These too were Mannheimer, Dr. Mutter\r\nreplied, when I hopefully asked if they were not a part of the monastery\r\nfittings.\r\n\r\nAs final proof of the looters’ thorough methods, I was shown a vaulted\r\nreception hall, into the walls of which had been set a large and\r\nmagnificent relief by Luca della Robbia, a smaller but also very\r\nbeautiful relief of the Madonna and Child by some Florentine sculptor\r\nof the fifteenth century, and an enormous carved stone fireplace of\r\nRenaissance workmanship. The hall was stacked with huge cases as yet\r\nunpacked, and from the ceiling were suspended two marvelous Venetian\r\nglass chandeliers—exotic accents against a background of chaste plaster\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nThis partial tour of inspection ended with a smaller room across from the\r\nreception hall where Dr. Mutter proudly exhibited what he considered the\r\nfinest thing of all—a life-sized, seated marble portrait by Canova. It\r\nwas indeed a distinguished piece of work. Hitler had bought the statue in\r\nVienna, so Dr. Mutter said, from the Princess Windischgrätz. It had been\r\ndestined for the Führer Museum at Linz.\r\n\r\nI learned afterward that the statue had belonged at one time to the\r\nAustrian emperor, Franz Josef. Canova began the statue in 1812 as a\r\nportrait of Maria-Elisa, Princess of Lucca—a sister of Napoleon. The\r\nsculptor’s more celebrated portrait of Napoleon’s sister Pauline had been\r\ncarved a few years earlier. When Maria-Elisa lost her throne and fortune,\r\nshe was unable to pay for the portrait. But Canova was resourceful: he\r\nchanged the portrait into a statue of Polyhymnia, the Muse of poetry\r\nand song. He accomplished this metamorphosis by idealizing the head and\r\nadding the appropriate attributes of the Muse. Later the statue was\r\ngiven to Franz Josef. Eventually it passed into the collection of his\r\ngranddaughter—the daughter of Rudolf, who died at Mayerling—the Princess\r\nWindischgrätz.\r\n\r\nThe statue was one of the most delicate and graceful examples of the\r\ngreat neoclassic master’s style, and I marveled both at its cold\r\nperfection and the fact that it had come through its travels completely\r\nunscathed. For all her airy elegance, the Muse must weigh at least a\r\nton and a half, I calculated—suddenly coming down to earth with the\r\nrealization that I would be expected to take her back to Munich!\r\n\r\nOver Dr. Mutter’s protest that I had not yet seen everything, I said\r\nthat I should get my men started. There was no time to be lost. Colonel\r\nSheehan provided eight men and, after cautioning them about the value and\r\nfragility of the objects, I detailed Dr. Mutter to supervise their work.\r\nThe first job was to bring some of the furniture down to the ground\r\nfloor. As yet we had no packing materials, so we could do no actual\r\nloading. The next step was to show the packers what we were up against.\r\nAt first they went from room to room shaking their heads and muttering,\r\nbut after I had explained that we would only select certain things, they\r\ncheered up and set to work. Luckily, some of the furniture had a fair\r\namount of protective padding—paper stuffed with excelsior—and that could\r\nbe used until we were able to get more. We had enough, they agreed, to\r\nfigure on perhaps two truckloads. Leaving them to mull over that, I went\r\noff to round up a couple of the trucks. Here was another problem. Not\r\nonly did the furniture have to be brought down a long flight of stone\r\nstairs, but to reach the stairs in the first place it had to be carried a\r\ndistance of two hundred yards. Once down the stairs it had to be carried\r\nanother two hundred yards down a long sloping ramp to the only doorway\r\nopening onto the courtyard. I told Leclancher to bring one of the trucks\r\naround to that doorway and then took off in search of paper, excelsior,\r\nrope and blankets. In one of the near-by sheds I found only a small\r\nsupply of paper and some twine. We would need much more.\r\n\r\nMajor Whittemore came to the rescue and drove me to a lumber and paper\r\nmill several kilometers away. As we drove along he told me that he had\r\nbeen having trouble with the German managers of the mill, but they knew\r\nnow that he meant business, so I was not to _ask_ for what I wanted,\r\nI was to _tell_ them. At the mill I got a generous supply of paper,\r\nexcelsior and rope and, on my return to the monastery, sent one of the\r\ntrucks back to pick it up. But there wasn’t a spare blanket to be had in\r\nall of Hohenfurth.\r\n\r\nWhen I got back, it looked like moving day. The ramp was already lined\r\nwith tables, chairs and chests. Dr. Mutter was running back and forth,\r\ncautioning one GI not to drop a delicate cabinet, helping another with an\r\noverambitious armful of equal rarity and all the while trying in vain to\r\ncheck the numbers marked on the pieces as they flowed down the stairs in\r\na steady stream. Meanwhile, my two packers trudged up and down the ramp,\r\nlugging heavy chests and monstrous panels which looked more than a match\r\nfor men twice their size.\r\n\r\nIn spite of their concerted efforts, we didn’t have anything like enough\r\nhelp, so I appealed to Leclancher. With discouraging independence, he\r\nindicated that his men were drivers, not furniture movers, and that he\r\ncouldn’t order them to help. But he would put it up to them. After a\r\nserious conference with them, Leclancher reported that they had agreed\r\nto join the work party. Now, with a crew of twenty, things moved along\r\nat a faster pace. With a couple of the GIs, the two packers and I set\r\nto work loading the first truck. Here was where the little Rackhamites\r\nshone. In half an hour the first truck was packed and ready to be driven\r\nback to its place beside the chapel wall. The second truck was brought up\r\nand before long joined its groaning companion, snugly parked against a\r\nbuttress.\r\n\r\nPresently, the eight GIs trooped out into the courtyard. It was half\r\npast five and time for chow. The Frenchmen knocked off too, leaving\r\nDr. Mutter, the two packers and me to take stock of the afternoon’s\r\naccomplishment. While we were thus engaged, Leclancher came to tell me\r\nthat my driver, the one I called “Double Roger,” was feeling sick and\r\nwanted to see a doctor. In the confusion of the afternoon’s work I hadn’t\r\nnoticed that he was not about. We found him curled up in the back of the\r\ntruck and feeling thoroughly miserable. I drove him down to the Medical\r\nOffice in the village and there Dr. Sverdlik, the Battalion Surgeon,\r\nexamined him. Roger’s complaint was a severe pain in the midriff and the\r\ndoctor suggested heat treatments. He said that the German surgeon up at\r\nthe monastery hospital had the necessary equipment.\r\n\r\nThat seemed simple enough, since the drivers were billeted in rooms\r\nadjoining the hospital wing. But I reckoned without Roger. What? Be\r\ntreated by a German doctor? He was terrified at the prospect, and it\r\nrequired all my powers of persuasion to talk him into it. Finally he\r\nagreed, but only after Dr. Sverdlik had telephoned to the hospital doctor\r\nand given explicit instructions. I also had to promise to stand by while\r\nthe doctor ministered to him.\r\n\r\nThe German, Major Brecker, was methodical and thorough. He found\r\nthat Roger had a kidney infection and recommended that he be taken\r\nto a hospital as soon as possible. I explained that we would not be\r\nreturning to Munich for at least two days and asked if the delay would\r\nbe dangerous. He said that he thought not. In the meantime he would\r\nkeep Roger under a “heat basket.” Roger eyed this device with suspicion\r\nbut truculently allowed it to be applied. When I went off to my supper,\r\ntwenty minutes later, he was sleeping peacefully—but not alone. Three of\r\nhis fellow drivers were sprawled on cots near by, just in case that Boche\r\nhad any intentions of playing tricks on their comrade. Maybe not, but\r\nthey were taking no chances! What a lot of children they were, I thought,\r\nas I walked wearily down to supper.\r\n\r\nThat evening I asked the colonel if I could get hold of some PWs to help\r\nout with the work the following day. He said that there was a large camp\r\nbetween Hohenfurth and Krummau and that I could have as many as I wanted.\r\nSo I put in a bid for sixteen. After arranging for them to be at the\r\nmonastery at eight the next morning, I went to my own quarters which were\r\nin a house just across the way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: At the Rest House at Unterstein near Berchtesgaden, Major\r\nHarry Anderson supervises the removal of the Göring Collection, brought\r\nfrom Karinhall, near Berlin. _International News Photo_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One of the forty rooms in the Rest House in which the\r\nGöring pictures, 1,100 in all, were exhibited before their removal to\r\nMunich for subsequent restitution. _International News Photo_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The GI Work Party which assisted the Special Evacuation\r\nTeam (Lieutenants Howe, Moore and Kovalyak) pack the Göring Collection\r\nfor removal from Berchtesgaden to Munich.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Truck loaded with sculpture from the Göring Collection at\r\nBerchtesgaden. Statues were packed upright in excelsior for removal to\r\nthe Central Collecting Point in Munich.]\r\n\r\nI had one little errand of mercy to take care of before I turned in.\r\nThere was a recreation room on the first floor and adjoining it a\r\nmakeshift bar. Most of the officers had gone to the movies, so I managed\r\nto slip in unobserved and pilfer two bottles of beer. Tucking them inside\r\nmy blouse, I made off for the monastery. There, after some difficulty\r\nin finding my way around the dark passageways, I located the rooms\r\noccupied by my two little packers. They were making ready for bed, but\r\nwhen they saw what I had for them, their leathery old faces lighted\r\nup with ecstatic smiles. If I had been a messenger from heaven, they\r\ncouldn’t have been happier. Leaving them clucking over their unexpected\r\nrefreshments, I went back to my own billet and fell into bed. I hadn’t\r\nhad exactly what one would call a restful day myself.\r\n\r\nThat beer worked wonders I hadn’t anticipated. When I arrived at the\r\nmonastery a little before eight the next morning I found that my two\r\npackers, together with Dr. Mutter, had been at work since seven. As\r\nyet there was no sign of the Frenchmen, but I thought that they would\r\nprobably show up before long. At eight my gang of PWs appeared and the\r\nsergeant who brought them explained that I wouldn’t be having the crew\r\nof GIs who had helped out the day before. When I protested that I needed\r\nthem more urgently than ever, he informed me that the combination of GI\r\nand PW labor simply wouldn’t work out; that I certainly couldn’t expect\r\nto have them both doing the same kind of work together. I said that I\r\nmost certainly could and did expect it. Well, my protest was completely\r\nunavailing, and if I had to make a choice I was probably better off with\r\nthe sixteen PWs. Perhaps my two packers could get enough work out of\r\nthem to compensate for the loss of the GIs.\r\n\r\nI had just finished assigning various jobs to the PWs when Leclancher\r\nturned up. “May I have a word with you?” he asked. “It is about Roger.”\r\n\r\n“What about Roger? Is he any worse?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“No, but he is not any better either,” he said. “Is it possible that we\r\nshall be returning to Munich tomorrow morning?”\r\n\r\n“Not the ghost of a chance,” I said. “We shan’t be through loading before\r\ntomorrow night. We’re too shorthanded.”\r\n\r\n“But if we all pitched in and worked, even after supper?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“It would make a big difference,” I said. “But it’s entirely up to you.\r\nIt’s certainly worth a try if the drivers are willing.”\r\n\r\nI’ll never forget that day. I never saw Frenchmen move with such rapidity\r\nor with such singleness of purpose. When five o’clock came, we had\r\nfinished loading the fifth truck. Taking into account the two from the\r\npreceding day, that left only three more trucks to fill. Leclancher came\r\nto me again. The drivers wanted to work until it got dark. That meant\r\nuntil nine o’clock. Knowing that the two packers were equally eager to\r\nget back to Munich, I agreed. I hurried off to call the sergeant about\r\nthe PWs. Special arrangements would have to be made to feed them if we\r\nwere keeping on the job after supper. Also, I had to make sure that\r\nsomeone at Battalion Headquarters would be able to provide a vehicle to\r\ntake them back to their camp.\r\n\r\nWhile the drivers went off to chow and the PWs were being fed in the\r\nhospital kitchen, I joined Dr. Mutter and the packers to discuss these\r\nnew developments. I felt sure that I would be returning to Hohenfurth in\r\nanother few days with additional trucks to complete the evacuation. That\r\nbeing the case, some preliminary planning was necessary. I instructed\r\nDr. Mutter to call in a stonemason to remove the Della Robbia relief and\r\nthe other pieces which had been set into the walls, so that they would\r\nbe ready for packing when we came back. I gave him a written order which\r\nwould enable him to lay in a supply of lumber for packing cases which\r\nwould have to be built for some of the more fragile pieces. Lastly, the\r\nfour of us surveyed the storage rooms and made an estimate of the number\r\nof trucks we would need for the things still on hand.\r\n\r\nTo save time I had a couple of chocolate bars for my supper and was ready\r\nto resume work when our combined forces reappeared. The next two hours\r\nand a half went by like a whirlwind and by eight o’clock we knotted down\r\nthe tarpaulin on the last truck. Everybody was content. Even the PWs\r\nseemed less glum than usual, but that was probably because they had been\r\nso well fed in the hospital kitchen.\r\n\r\nIf we were to make it through to Munich in the one day, we would have\r\nto start off early the next morning. Accordingly I left word that the\r\ntrucks were to be lined up outside the monastery entrance at seven-thirty\r\nsharp. Then I went down to the colonel’s quarters to see about an armed\r\nescort for the convoy. I found Colonel Sheehan and Major Thacher making\r\npreparations to “go out on the town.” They looked very spruce in their\r\npinks and were in high spirits.\r\n\r\n“We missed you at supper,” said the colonel. “How’s the work coming\r\nalong?”\r\n\r\n“My trucks are loaded and ready to roll first thing in the morning if I\r\ncan have an escort,” I said.\r\n\r\n“That calls for a celebration,” he said. “Pour yourself a drink. I’ll\r\nmake a bargain with you. You can have the escort on one condition—that\r\nyou join our party tonight.”\r\n\r\nI didn’t protest. I thought it was a swell idea. A few minutes later, the\r\ncaptain with whom I was billeted arrived and the four of us set out for\r\nan evening of fun.\r\n\r\nIn the short space of two days I had grown very fond of these\r\nthree officers, although we had met only at mealtime. They were,\r\nin fact, characteristic of all the officers I had encountered at\r\nHohenfurth—friendly, good-natured and ready to do anything they could\r\nto help. That they were all going home soon may have had something\r\nto do with their contented outlook on life, and they deserved their\r\ncontentment. As members of the 26th Division, the famous “Yankee\r\nDivision,” they had seen plenty of action, and as we drove along that\r\nnight in the colonel’s car, my three companions did a lot of reminiscing.\r\n\r\nWhile they exchanged stories, I had a chance to enjoy the romantic\r\ncountryside through which we were passing. We were, the colonel had said,\r\nheaded for Krummau, an old town about fifteen miles away.\r\n\r\nThe road followed along the winding Moldau River, which had an almost\r\nsupernatural beauty in the glow of the late evening light. The bright\r\ngreen banks were mirrored, crystal clear, on its unrippled surface, as\r\nwere the rose-gold colors of the evening clouds.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the river at Rosenberg, and as we went over the bridge I\r\nnoticed that it bore—as do all bridges in that region—the figure of St.\r\nJohn Nepomuk, patron saint of Bohemia. The castle, perched high above the\r\nriver, was the ancestral seat of the Dukes of Rosenberg who ruled this\r\npart of Bohemia for hundreds of years. One of them murdered his wife and,\r\naccording to the legend, she still haunted the castle. Robed in white,\r\nshe was said to walk the battlements each night between eleven-thirty\r\nand twelve. Major Thacher thought that we should test the legend by\r\npaying a visit to the castle on our return from Krummau later that\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived in Krummau it was too dark to see much of the old town\r\nexcept the outline of the gray buildings which lined the narrow streets.\r\nOur objective was a night club operated by members of an underground\r\nmovement which was said to have flourished there throughout the years\r\nof Nazi oppression. There was nothing in any way remarkable about\r\nthe establishment, but it provided a little variety for the officers\r\nstationed thereabouts. My companions were popular patrons of the place.\r\nThey were royally welcomed by the proprietor, who found a good table for\r\nus, not too near the small noisy orchestra. Two pretty Czech girls joined\r\nus and we all took turns dancing. There were so many more men than girls\r\nthat we had to be content with one dance each. Then the girls moved on to\r\nanother table.\r\n\r\nWe whiled away a couple of hours at the club before the colonel said that\r\nwe should be starting back. I hoped that we would be in time to pay our\r\nrespects to the phantom duchess, but the clock in the square was striking\r\ntwelve when we rumbled through the empty streets of Rosenberg. It had\r\nbegun to rain again.\r\n\r\nAt six the next morning, I looked sleepily out the window. It was still\r\nraining. We would have a slow trip unless the weather cleared, and\r\nI thought apprehensively of the steep road leading into Linz. Fresh\r\neggs—instead of the usual French toast—and two cups of black coffee\r\nbrightened my outlook on the soggy morning and I was further cheered to\r\nfind the convoy smartly lined up like a row of circus elephants when I\r\nreached the monastery at seven-thirty. Leclancher had taken the lead\r\ntruck and the ailing Roger was bundled up in the cab of one of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nDr. Mutter waved agitated farewells from beneath the ribs of a tattered\r\numbrella as we slid slowly down the monastery drive. At the corner of\r\nthe main street of the village we picked up our escort, two armed jeeps.\r\nThey conducted us to the border where we gathered in two similar vehicles\r\nwhich would set the pace for us into Linz. The bad weather was in one\r\nrespect an advantage: there was practically no traffic on the road.\r\n\r\nAt Linz I stopped long enough to thank Anderson and his colonel for the\r\nescort vehicles they had produced on a moment’s notice that morning\r\nin response to a call from Colonel Sheehan. This third pair of jeeps\r\nwere very conscientious about their escort duties. The one in the\r\nvanguard kept well in the lead and would signal us whenever he came to a\r\ndepression in the road. This got on Leclancher’s nerves, for I heard him\r\nmuttering under his breath every time it happened. But I was so glad to\r\nhave an escort of any kind that I pretended not to notice his irritation.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Lambach, midway between Linz and Salzburg, we lost this\r\npair of guardians but acquired two sent on from the latter city. While\r\nwaiting for them to appear, I scrounged lunch for myself and the drivers\r\nat a local battery. As soon as the new escorts arrived we started on\r\nagain and pulled into Salzburg at two-thirty. This time there were no\r\ndelays and we threaded our way through the dripping streets and out on to\r\nthe Autobahn without mishap.\r\n\r\nI now had only one remaining worry—the bad detour near Rosenheim. Again,\r\nperhaps thanks to the weather, we were in luck and found this treacherous\r\nby-pass free of traffic. As we rolled into Munich, the rain let up and by\r\nthe time we turned into the Königsplatz, the sun had broken through the\r\nclearing skies.\r\n\r\nMy first major evacuation job was finished. As soon as I got my drivers\r\nfixed up with transportation back to their camp and the members of our\r\nescort party fed and billeted I could relax with a clear conscience. It\r\nwas a little after five-thirty, and Third Army’s inflexible habits about\r\nthe hour at which all enlisted men should eat didn’t make this problem\r\nsuch an easy one. Third Army Headquarters was a good twenty minutes\r\naway, so I took the men to the Military Government Detachment where the\r\nmeal schedule was more elastic. Afterward I shepherded them to their\r\nbillets and went off to my own. I would have to write up a report of the\r\nexpedition for Captain Posey, but that could wait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(5)\r\n\r\n_SECOND TRIP TO HOHENFURTH_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first order of business the next morning was a conference with\r\nCaptain Posey. I gave him a complete account of the Hohenfurth trip and\r\npresented my recommendations for a second and final visit to complete\r\nthe evacuation. It was my suggestion that I return to the monastery with\r\nthe same trucks—as soon as they could be unloaded and serviced—and that\r\nhe send up another officer with at least eight additional trucks, the\r\nsecond convoy to arrive by the time I had completed the loading of my\r\nown. I proposed taking four packers this time instead of two, the idea\r\nbeing that two of the packers could help me with the loading while the\r\nothers were building cases for the fragile objects which would have to\r\nbe crated. I mentioned also the impending withdrawal of our troops from\r\nHohenfurth, which would make later operations of such nature impossible.\r\n\r\nThis was of course no news to Captain Posey as, presumably, it had been\r\nthe determining factor in the removal of the Hohenfurth things in the\r\nfirst place. He approved my plan and advised me to get my trucks lined\r\nup, and said he would see what he could do about sending an additional\r\nofficer. I didn’t like the sound of that. Too often I had used those\r\nsame words myself when confronted with a difficult request. Furthermore,\r\nit had been my experience with the Army in general thus far—and with\r\nThird Army in particular—that “out of sight, out of mind” was a favorite\r\nmotto. I had no intention of going back to Hohenfurth until I had a\r\ndefinite promise that reinforcements would be forthcoming. I think\r\nthat my insistence piqued the captain a bit. But at that point I was\r\nfeeling exceedingly brisk and businesslike—a mood which I found new and\r\nstimulating. It would be better to have a clear understanding now as to\r\nwho would join me in Hohenfurth; as I explained to Captain Posey, I would\r\nlike to give the officer some detailed instructions, preferably oral\r\nones, before I started off.\r\n\r\nI spent the rest of that day and most of the following one at the\r\nVerwaltungsbau supervising the unloading of the ten trucks from\r\nHohenfurth and making trips out to the trucking company headquarters to\r\nconclude arrangements for continued use of the vehicles. Also, I had to\r\nput in a request for eight others. It was gratifying to find that every\r\npiece we had packed at Hohenfurth came through without a scratch. My two\r\npackers, to whom all credit for this belonged, were equally elated. My\r\nrequest for the services of four packers was met with black looks, but\r\nwhen I promised that we’d not be gone more than four or five days, Craig\r\nacquiesced.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon of the second day, I went again to Posey’s office.\r\nHe was not there but I found Lincoln, as usual hunched morosely over his\r\ntypewriter. He said he had good news for me. Captain Posey had pulled a\r\nfast one and snatched a wonderful guy away from Jim Rorimer, Monuments\r\nOfficer at Seventh Army—a fellow named Lamont Moore. Moore was already,\r\nhe thought, on his way down to Munich to make the trip to Hohenfurth.\r\nWhen I said I didn’t know Moore, Lincoln proceeded to tell me about him.\r\n\r\n“Lamont was director of the educational program at the National Gallery\r\nin Washington before he went into the Army. Before that he had a\r\nbrilliant record at the Newark Museum. The two of you ought to get along\r\nfamously. Lamont’s got a wonderful sense of humor. He’s exceedingly\r\nintelligent and he’s had a lot of experience in evacuation work.”\r\n\r\n“Where did you know him?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“We were in France last winter. That was before he was commissioned. He’s\r\na lieutenant now,” Lincoln said.\r\n\r\n“That sounds perfect. But I want to ask you a question about something\r\nelse and I want a truthful answer. I have a sneaking notion that you knew\r\nall the time what was in that monastery at Hohenfurth. How about it?”\r\n\r\n“Furniture and sculpture, you mean, instead of paintings?” he asked. “Of\r\ncourse I didn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Well, maybe you didn’t, but perhaps you can imagine how I felt when\r\nI found that the Mannheimer collection alone contained more than two\r\nthousand items, and that the Rothschild pieces totaled up to a similar\r\nfigure.”\r\n\r\nLincoln’s chuckle belied his protestations. “I’ve got another piece\r\nof news for you,” he said. “John Nicholas Brown and Mason Hammond are\r\narriving tomorrow. I thought you might like to see them before you return\r\nto Hohenfurth.”\r\n\r\n“You told me once that Captain Posey, like many another officer, doesn’t\r\nrelish visitors from higher headquarters,” I said. “Am I to infer a\r\nconnection between his absence from the office and the impending arrival\r\nof these two distinguished emissaries from the Group Control Council?”\r\n\r\nHe assured me that I was not, but I left the office wondering about it\r\nall the same.\r\n\r\nThat evening George Stout paid one of his rare and fleeting visits to\r\nMunich. On these occasions he stayed either with Craig or Ham Coulter.\r\nThis time the four of us—all “strays” from the Navy—gathered in Ham’s\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\n“The work at the mine,” George said, “is going along as rapidly as can be\r\nexpected in the circumstances. But it’s got to be stepped up. I came down\r\nto find out how soon you could join me.”\r\n\r\n“I’m going back to Hohenfurth again,” I said. “Lamont Moore is to meet me\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\nGeorge was glad to hear this and said that he and Lamont had worked\r\ntogether at the Siegen mine in Westphalia. He confirmed all of the good\r\nthings Lincoln had told me about Lamont and said that he’d like to have\r\nboth of us at Alt Aussee. He promised to have a talk with Posey about\r\nit, because he was of the opinion that these big evacuation jobs should\r\nbe handled by a team rather than by a single officer. According to\r\nGeorge, a team of at least three—and preferably four—officers would be\r\nthe perfect setup. Then the work could be divided up. Each officer would\r\nhave specific duties, assigned to him on the basis of his particular\r\ntalents. But all members of the team would have responsibilities of equal\r\nimportance. It would be teamwork in the real sense of the term.\r\n\r\nLike all of George’s proposals, this one sounded very sensible. At the\r\nsame time, when I recalled the haphazard way I had been obliged to\r\nconduct operations thus far myself, I wondered if it weren’t Utopian.\r\nThat didn’t discourage George. When he had a good idea he never let go\r\nof it. And, if we had only been a larger group, I am convinced that his\r\nbrain child about teams would have had wonderful results. As it was, the\r\nevents of the next few weeks were to demonstrate how effective the scheme\r\nwas on a small scale.\r\n\r\nWhen I got out to Third Army Headquarters the next morning, George had\r\nalready come and gone. I would have liked to ask Posey about their\r\nconversation but he didn’t seem to be in a chatty mood—at least not on\r\nthat subject. However, he did have a few caustic things to say about\r\n“people from high headquarters who have nothing better to do than travel\r\naround and interrupt the work of others.”\r\n\r\nKnowing that he was referring to Messrs. Brown and Hammond—Lincoln’s\r\nassurance of the night before to the contrary notwithstanding—I piously\r\nobserved that high-level visitors to the field might do quite a lot of\r\ngood. For one thing, the fact that they had taken the trouble to visit it\r\nemphasized the importance of the work they had come to inspect; and, for\r\nanother, it pleased the officer in the field to have his job noticed by\r\nthe boys at the top. I thought I sounded pretty convincing, but sensing\r\nthat I was not, I turned to other topics.\r\n\r\nAbout that time John and Mason arrived. Our last meeting had taken place\r\nin the vaults of the Reichsbank at Frankfurt several weeks before. Mason\r\nreferred to that and jokingly accused me of having run out on him. When\r\nI told him that I was about to return to Hohenfurth he announced loudly\r\nthat that was perfect—he and John would drop in to see me there. I said\r\nthat would be fine but, when I noted the expression on Captain Posey’s\r\nface, I added to myself, “fine, if they get the clearance.” Before coming\r\nup to see me, they expected to visit one or two places south of Munich,\r\nso they wouldn’t reach Hohenfurth before the end of the week.\r\n\r\nCaptain Posey was a great believer in the old theory that the Devil\r\nfinds work for idle hands, at least as far as I was concerned. That same\r\nafternoon he casually suggested that I take a “little run down into the\r\nTyrol” for him and inspect a castle about which he had been asked to\r\nmake a report. He proposed the trip with such prewar insouciance that it\r\nsounded like a pleasant holiday excursion. As a matter of fact it was\r\nan appealing suggestion, despite my plans for an early morning start to\r\nHohenfurth.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful summer day and my jeep driver asked if a friend of\r\nhis, a sergeant who was keen about photography, might come along. I\r\nagreed and the three of us headed out east of Munich on the Autobahn. It\r\nwas fun to be riding in an open jeep instead of an enclosed truck.\r\n\r\nWe reached Rosenheim in record time and there struck south into the\r\nmountains. Our objective was the little village of Brixlegg, between\r\nKufstein and Innsbruck. We were on the main road to the Brenner Pass.\r\nItaly was temptingly close. We stopped from time to time so that the\r\nsergeant could get a snapshot of some particularly dramatic vista.\r\nBut there was an embarrassment of riches—every part of the road was\r\nspectacularly beautiful.\r\n\r\nBrixlegg was a tiny cluster of picturesque chalets, but it had not been\r\ntiny enough to elude the attentions of the air force. On the outskirts\r\nwe saw the shattered remains of what had been an important factory for\r\nthe manufacture of airplane parts. Happily, the bombers had concentrated\r\ntheir efforts on the factory. The little village had suffered practically\r\nno damage at all.\r\n\r\nWe located our castle without difficulty. It was Schloss Matzen, one\r\nof the finest castles of the Tyrol—the property of a British officer,\r\nVice-Admiral Baillie-Grohman. This gentleman had requested a report on\r\nthe castle from the American authorities. We found everything in perfect\r\norder. The admiral’s cousin—a Hungarian baron named Von Schmedes who\r\nspoke excellent English—was in residence. He showed us over the place.\r\nThe castle was an example of intelligent restoration. According to the\r\ninscription on a plaque over the entrance, the aunt of the present owner\r\nhad devoted her life to this task.\r\n\r\nAlthough an “Off Limits” sign was prominently displayed on the premises,\r\nthe baron was fearful of intruders. As the castle stood some distance\r\nfrom the main highway, I thought he was being unduly apprehensive. He\r\nsaid that an official letter of warning to unwelcome visitors would be\r\nan added protection. To please him I wrote out a statement to the effect\r\nthat the castle was an historic monument, the property of a British\r\nsubject, etc., and signed it in the name of the Commanding General of the\r\nThird U. S. Army.\r\n\r\nOn our way out we were shown two rooms on the ground floor which were\r\nfilled with polychromed wood sculpture from the museum at Innsbruck. The\r\nbaron said that additional objects from the Innsbruck museum were stored\r\nin a near-by castle, Schloss Lichtwert.\r\n\r\nIt was but a few minutes’ drive from Schloss Matzen, so I decided to have\r\na look at it. Schloss Lichtwert, though not nearly so picturesque either\r\nin character or as to site, was the more interesting of the two. It stood\r\nbaldly in the middle of a field and was actually a big country house\r\nrather than a castle.\r\n\r\nWe were hospitably received by a courtly old gentleman, Baron von Iname,\r\nto whom I explained the reason for our visit. One of his daughters\r\noffered to do the honors, saying that her father was extremely deaf.\r\nWe followed her to a handsome drawing room on the second floor, where\r\nseveral other members of the family were gathered in conversation around\r\na large table set with coffee things. In one of the wall panels was a\r\nconcealed door, which the daughter of the house opened by pressing a\r\nhidden spring. Leading the way, she took us into a room about twenty feet\r\nsquare filled with violins, violas and ’cellos. They hung in rows from\r\nthe ceiling, like hams in a smokehouse. Fräulein von Iname said that the\r\ncollection of musical instruments at Innsbruck was a very fine one. We\r\nwere standing in a Stradivarius forest.\r\n\r\nWhen we passed back into the drawing room, the father whispered a few\r\nwords to his daughter. She turned to us smiling and said, “Father asked\r\nif I had pointed out to you the thickness of the walls in this part\r\nof the castle. He is very proud of the fact that they date from the\r\nfourteenth century and that our family has always lived here. He also\r\nasks me to invite you to take coffee with us.”\r\n\r\nKnowing that coffee was valued as molten gold, I declined the invitation\r\non the grounds that we had a long trip ahead of us. Thanking her for her\r\ncourtesy, we left. It was after eleven when we got back to Munich. We had\r\ndriven a little more than three hundred miles.\r\n\r\nBad weather and bad luck attended us all the way to Hohenfurth the next\r\nday. Less than an hour out on the Autobahn, we came upon a gruesome\r\naccident—an overturned jeep and the limp figures of two GIs at one side\r\nof the road, the mangled body of a German soldier in the center of the\r\npavement. An ambulance had already arrived and a doctor was ministering\r\nto the injured American soldiers. The German was obviously beyond medical\r\nhelp. As soon as the road was cleared, we continued—but at a very sober\r\npace.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of Salzburg we had carburetor trouble which held us up\r\nfor nearly two hours. It was after five thirty when we reached Linz. We\r\nstopped there for supper and I had a few words with the colonel who had\r\nlooked after us so well a few days before. He seemed surprised to see me\r\nagain, and rather agitated.\r\n\r\n“You can get through this time,” he said, “but don’t try to come back\r\nthis way.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean, sir?” I asked, puzzled by his curt admonition.\r\n\r\nApparently annoyed by my query, he said brusquely, “Don’t ask any\r\nquestions. Just do as I say—don’t come back this way.”\r\n\r\nAt supper I saw Lieutenant Anderson again and I broached the subject to\r\nhim. “Does the colonel mean that the Russians are expected to move up to\r\nthe other side of the Danube?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Take a good look at the bridge when you cross over tonight,” he said.\r\n\r\nIt was my turn to be nettled now. “Look here, I don’t mean to be\r\nintruding on any precious military secret, but I am expecting a second\r\nconvoy to join me at Hohenfurth in two days; if the other trucks aren’t\r\ngoing to be able to get through I ought to let the people at Third Army\r\nHeadquarters know.”\r\n\r\n“Well, frankly I don’t know just what the score is, but the colonel\r\nprobably has definite information,” he said. “What I meant about the\r\nbridge is that it’s jammed with people and carts, all coming over to the\r\nwest side of the Danube. It’s been like that for the past two days and it\r\ncan mean only one thing—that the Russians aren’t far behind.”\r\n\r\nThis wasn’t too reassuring, but I decided to take a fatalistic attitude\r\ntoward it. If I had to find some other route back from Hohenfurth, I’d\r\nworry about it when the time came. I did, however, try to get through to\r\nThird Army Headquarters on the phone. Posey’s office didn’t answer, so I\r\nasked Anderson to put in a call for me in the morning.\r\n\r\nIt was slow going over the bridge, but we finally forced our way through\r\nthe welter of carts and wagons. Once we were in open country, the traffic\r\nthinned out and we moved along at a faster pace. The Czech and American\r\nofficers at the frontier recognized us and waved us through without\r\nformality. We arrived in Hohenfurth a little before nine. I knew the\r\nropes this time, so it was a simple matter to get the men billeted in the\r\nmonastery. After that I went on to my own former billet. When I reached\r\nthe house, I found a group of officers in the recreation room. They were\r\nholding an informal meeting. Colonel Sheehan was presiding and motioned\r\nto me to join the group. He had just returned from the headquarters at\r\nBudweis with important news. His own orders had come through, so he would\r\nbe pulling out for home in a few days. But of greater concern to me was\r\nthe news that the Czechs would definitely take over at the end of the\r\nweek. We would still have some troops in the area, but their duties would\r\nbe greatly curtailed. I would have to finish the job at the monastery as\r\nfast as possible and head back to Munich.\r\n\r\nWe resumed our work at the monastery with surprisingly few delays. It was\r\nalmost as if there had been no interruption of our earlier operations.\r\nThis time I had double the number of PWs, so I did not have to call on\r\nthe drivers to help with the loading. During my absence, Dr. Mutter had\r\nput a stonemason to work on the pieces which had been set into the wall,\r\nand these now lay like parts of a puzzle in a neat pattern on the floor\r\nof the reception hall, ready to be packed. He had also procured lumber\r\nand nails, so my two extra packers were able to get to work on the cases\r\nwhich had to be built. By evening, seven of the trucks were loaded,\r\nleaving only one more to do the next day.\r\n\r\nThat night I consulted one of the officers, who had a wide knowledge\r\nof the roads in that area, about an alternate route to Munich. He\r\nshowed me, on the map, a winding back road which would take me through\r\nPassau—instead of Linz and Salzburg—to Munich. It was, he said, a very\r\n“scenic route” but longer than the way I had come. He felt sure, though,\r\nthat I could get my trucks through, that there were no bad detours, etc.\r\nIt was comforting to know that this route existed as a possibility—just\r\nin case. But I still had hopes of being able to go back by way of Linz,\r\nin spite of the colonel’s warning.\r\n\r\nThe next day was the Fourth of July—not that I expected either my French\r\nor German associates to take special notice of the fact. Still I was glad\r\nthat I had only one truck to load on the holiday. I took advantage of\r\nthe later breakfast hour, knowing that my faithful German packers would\r\nbe on the job at seven o’clock as usual. When I arrived at the monastery\r\nat nine-thirty, I found that the last truck was already half loaded.\r\nThere was enough room to add the two cases containing the Della Robbia\r\nplaque and the Renaissance fireplace taken out of the wall; and, if we\r\nwere careful, we might find a place for the fifteenth century Florentine\r\nrelief which the stonemason had also painstakingly removed. Once that\r\nwas done, there was nothing to do but wait for the arrival of Lieutenant\r\nMoore and the additional trucks.\r\n\r\nI called the workmen together. In halting German, I explained the\r\nsignificance of the Fourth of July and announced that there would be no\r\nmore work that day. It was providentially near the lunch hour. I could\r\nsend the PWs back to their camp as soon as they had eaten. The German\r\npackers, intent on returning to Munich as soon as possible, chose to get\r\non with the cases they were building. Dr. Mutter and I retired to his\r\nstudy to take stock of the receipts we had thus far made out. As for the\r\nFrench drivers, they had disappeared to their quarters.\r\n\r\nAfter lunching at the officers’ mess, I decided to celebrate the Glorious\r\nFourth in my own quiet way. Major Whittemore had lent me a car, so I set\r\nout on an expedition of my own devising. Ever since the night of our trip\r\nto Krummau, I had wanted to explore the castle of Rosenberg, and this\r\nseemed the logical time to do it. Rosenberg was only eight kilometers\r\naway.\r\n\r\nIt was a sleepy summer afternoon. Not a leaf was stirring as I followed\r\nthe winding Moldau into the pretty village with its storybook castle. The\r\nroad to the castle was rough and tortuous, reminding me of a back road\r\nin the Tennessee mountain country. Just as I was beginning to wonder if\r\nthe little sedan were equal to the climb, the road turned sharply into a\r\nlevel areaway before the castle courtyard.\r\n\r\nI parked the car and went in search of the caretaker. When I found no\r\none, I ascended a flight of stone steps which led from the courtyard to\r\nthe second floor. The room at the head of the stairs was empty, but I\r\nheard voices in the one adjoining. Two cleaning women were scrubbing the\r\nfloor, chattering to each other as they worked. They were startled to see\r\nme, but one of them had the presence of mind to scurry off and return a\r\nfew minutes later with the archetype of all castle caretakers. He had\r\nbeen custodian for the past fifty-six years. Lately there hadn’t been\r\nmany visitors.\r\n\r\nHe took me first to the picture gallery—a long high-ceilinged room with\r\ntall windows looking out over the river. There were a dozen full-length\r\ncanvases around the rough plaster walls, past Dukes of Rosenberg and\r\ntheir sour-faced Duchesses. The _clou_ of the collection was a tubercular\r\nlady in seventeenth century costume. The caretaker solemnly informed\r\nme that she was the ill-fated duchess who paced the ramparts of the\r\ncastle every night just before twelve. She had lived, he told me, in\r\nthe fourteenth century. When I mentioned as tactfully as possible that\r\nher gown indicated she had been a mere three hundred years ahead of the\r\nstyles, he gave me a dirty look as much as to say, “a disbeliever.” I\r\ndid my best to erase this unfortunate impression and proceeded to the\r\nnext series of apartments. They included a weapon room, a sumptuous\r\nstate bedchamber reserved for royal visitors, several richly furnished\r\nreception rooms, and a long gallery called the Crusaders’ Hall—a\r\ncopy, the caretaker said, of a room in the Palace at Versailles. Here\r\nhung full-length portraits of such historic personages as Godefroy\r\nde Bouillon, Robert Guiscard and Frederick Barbarossa—all done by an\r\nindifferent German painter of the last century. Notwithstanding its\r\nostentatious atmosphere, the gallery had a dignity quite in keeping with\r\nthe musty elegance of the castle.\r\n\r\nI thanked the old man, gave him a couple of cigarettes and returned to\r\nthe car. It was time for me to be getting back to the monastery.\r\n\r\nI gauged my arrival nicely. As I pulled up to the entrance, the guard at\r\nthe archway came over to the car to tell me that eight trucks had just\r\ndriven through. When I reached the courtyard the last of them was backing\r\nup against the chapel wall.\r\n\r\nA tall, rangy lieutenant, wearing the familiar helmet liner prescribed\r\nby Third Army regulations, walked up to the car as I was getting out and\r\nsaid, “Good afternoon, sir. Dr. Livingstone, I presume?”\r\n\r\nSo this was Lamont Moore. Just as Lincoln had predicted, I liked him\r\nat once. There was a quiet self-possession about him, coupled with a\r\nquizzical, humorous expression, which was pleasantly reassuring. I have\r\nnever forgotten the impression of Olympian calm I received at that first\r\nmeeting. In succeeding months, there were many times when Lamont got\r\nthoroughly riled, but his composure never deserted him. His even temper\r\nand his sense of humor could always be depended upon to leaven the more\r\nimpetuous actions of his companions.\r\n\r\nWithout wasting breath on inconsequential conversation, he suggested that\r\nwe “case the joint.” After introducing him to Dr. Mutter, who was still\r\nhovering around like a distracted schoolmaster, we made a tour of the\r\npremises. By the time we had finished I had the comforting, if somewhat\r\nunflattering, feeling that he had a clearer understanding of the work\r\nthere than I, notwithstanding the time I had spent at the monastery.\r\n\r\nOn our way down to the village afterward, I asked Lamont if he had had\r\nany difficulty coming up through Linz. He said no, but that he also had\r\nbeen warned not to return that way.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had found a billet, we settled down to talk over the\r\nloading of his trucks. “The colonel says that we’ll have to finish the\r\njob in a hurry. The Czechs are taking over at the end of the week,” I\r\nsaid. “And if the Russians move up to the Danube, we won’t be able to go\r\nback by way of Linz. We’ll have to return by way of Passau.”\r\n\r\n“I understand that there isn’t any bridge over the Danube at Passau,”\r\nLamont said quietly. At that I got excited, but in the same quiet voice\r\nLamont said, “Don’t worry. We’ve got more important things to think\r\nabout—something to drink, for example.”\r\n\r\nWe went over to the officers’ club, arriving just in time to be offered\r\na sample of the Fourth of July punch which two of the officers had\r\nbeen mixing that afternoon. From the look of things, they had perfect\r\nconfidence in their recipe, which called for red wine, armagnac and\r\nchampagne. After the first sip I didn’t have to be told there would be\r\nfireworks in Hohenfurth that evening.\r\n\r\nLamont and I began to discuss mutual friends and acquaintances in the\r\nmuseum world, a habit deeply ingrained in members of our profession. We\r\nagreed that a mutual “hate” often brought people together more quickly\r\nthan a mutual admiration. Then inconsistently—it was probably the\r\npunch—we started talking about Lincoln, whom we both liked very much.\r\n\r\n“It was Lincoln who told me what a fine fellow you are, Lamont,” I said.\r\n\r\n“That’s interesting,” he said with a noiseless laugh. “He said the same\r\nthing about you.”\r\n\r\nComparing notes, we found that Lincoln had given us identical vignettes\r\nof each other.\r\n\r\n“Tell me something about the work you’ve been doing in MFA&A. This is my\r\nfirst real job, so I’m still a neophyte,” I said.\r\n\r\nLamont rolled his eyes wearily and said, “Oh, I’ve been evacuating works\r\nof art for the past four months, and I wonder sometimes if it’s ever\r\ngoing to end. Siegen was my big show. It was the foul and dripping copper\r\nmine in Westphalia where the priceless treasures from the Rhineland\r\nmuseums were stored. The shaft was two thousand feet deep and some of the\r\nmine chambers were more than half a mile from the shaft. Walker Hancock\r\nof First Army and George Stout had inspected it originally and advised\r\nimmediate evacuation. But no place was available. First Army was pushing\r\neastward, so all Walker could do was to reassure himself from time to\r\ntime that the contents were adequately guarded.\r\n\r\n“Shortly before VE-Day, I received a cryptic telegram at Ninth Army\r\nHeadquarters stating that, as of midnight that particular night, Siegen\r\nwas my headache. Then followed weeks of activity in which Walker, Steve\r\nand I were involved.”\r\n\r\n“Who is Steve?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Steve Kovalyak of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania,” said Lamont. “I think\r\nhe’s with George at Alt Aussee now. I hope you’ll meet him. He’s a great\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n“A bunker at Bonn was approved as a new repository for the Siegen\r\ntreasures. I surveyed the roads to Bonn and found them impossible for\r\ntruck transport. George was called to Alt Aussee. Walker went off to see\r\nabout setting up a collecting point at Marburg.\r\n\r\n“Then I was called back to Ninth Army Headquarters. The evacuation of\r\nSiegen was momentarily at a standstill.\r\n\r\n“Later I returned and, with Walker’s and Steve’s assistance, completed\r\nthe evacuation. We moved everything to Marburg, except the famous\r\nRomanesque doors from the church of Santa Maria im Kapitol. Walker took\r\nthem to the cathedral at Cologne, along with the Aachen crown jewels.\r\n\r\n“Siegen was the second major evacuation—perhaps you could say it was the\r\nfirst carried out by a _team_ of MFA&A officers.”\r\n\r\n“What was the first?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“The Merkers mine, where the Nazi gold and the Berlin Museum things were\r\nstored. That was the most spectacular of the early evacuations—that and\r\nBernterode.”\r\n\r\n“What about Bernterode?” I asked. I had read Hancock’s official report\r\nof the operation and had seen some snapshots taken in the mine, so I was\r\ncurious to have a firsthand account.\r\n\r\n“Walter Hancock was the officer in charge of the evacuation,” said\r\nLamont. “Like Siegen, it was a deep-shaft mine, so the contents had to\r\nbe brought up by an elevator. It was a hell of a job to get the elevator\r\nback in working order. The dramatic thing about Bernterode was the\r\ndiscovery of a small chapel, or shrine, constructed in one of the mine\r\nchambers and then completely walled up.\r\n\r\n“In this concealed shrine, the Nazis had placed the bronze sarcophagi of\r\nFrederick the Great, Frederick William—the Soldier King—and those of Von\r\nHindenburg and his wife. On the coffins had been laid wreaths, ribbons\r\nand various insignia of the Party. Around and about them were some two\r\nhundred regimental banners, many of them dating from the early Prussian\r\nwars.\r\n\r\n“When Walker was ready to take the coffins out of the mine, he found\r\nthey were so large and heavy that they’d have to come up one at a time.\r\nHe was standing at the top of the shaft as the coffin of Frederick the\r\nGreat rose slowly from the depths. As it neared the level, a radio in the\r\ndistance blared forth the ‘Star-Spangled Banner.’ And just as the coffin\r\ncame into view, the radio band struck up ‘God Save the King.’ The date,”\r\nLamont added significantly, “was May the eighth.”\r\n\r\nIf I thought I was going to get much sleep that night, I reckoned without\r\nthe patriotic officers of the Yankee Division, who were hell-bent on\r\nmaking it a really Glorious Fourth. It had been my mistake in the first\r\nplace to move into quarters directly over the recreation room. It wasn’t\r\nmuch of a bedroom anyway—just an alcove with an eighteenth century settee\r\nfor a bed. I was resting precariously on this spindly collector’s item\r\nwhen the door was flung open and Major Thacher shouted that I was wanted\r\nbelow. I told him to go away. To my surprise he did—but only to return a\r\nfew minutes later with reinforcements. I must come down at once—colonel’s\r\norders, and if I wouldn’t come quietly, they’d carry me down. Before I\r\ncould get off my settee, it was pitched forward and I sprawled on the\r\nfloor. What fun it was for everybody—except me! I put on a dressing\r\ngown and was marched down the stairs. I had been called in, as a naval\r\nofficer, to settle an argument: Who had won the Battle of Jutland? The\r\nBattle of Jutland, of all things! At that moment I wasn’t at all sure in\r\nwhat war it had been fought, let alone who had won it. But assuming an\r\nassurance I was far from feeling I declared that it had been a draw. My\r\nluck was with me that night after all, for that had been the colonel’s\r\ncontention. So I was allowed to return to my makeshift bed.\r\n\r\nLamont took some of the wind out of my sails by assuring me the next\r\nmorning that the British had defeated the German fleet at Jutland in 1916.\r\n\r\nBut we were having our own battle of Hohenfurth that morning, so I was\r\ntoo preoccupied to give Jutland more than a passing thought. Just before\r\nnoon, as we finished our fourth truck, John Nicholas Brown and Mason\r\nHammond arrived. Mason, as was his custom when traveling about Germany,\r\nwas bundled up in a great sheepskin coat—the kind used by the Wehrmacht\r\non the Russian front—and looked like something out of _Nanook of the\r\nNorth_. John, less arctically attired, hailed us gaily from the back seat\r\nof the command car.\r\n\r\nLamont and I suspended operations to show them around. We were pleased\r\nby their comments on our work—how admirably it was being handled and so\r\non—but we struck a snag when we showed them Canova’s marble Muse. Lamont\r\nand I had just about decided to leave her where she was. Our two visitors\r\nthought that would be a pity, a downright shame. We pointed out that to\r\ntransport the statue would be a hazardous business, even if we succeeded\r\nin getting it onto a truck in the first place. We had no equipment with\r\nwhich to hoist anything so heavy. On our inspection tour they kept coming\r\nback to the subject of the Canova, and Lamont gave me an irritated look\r\nfor having called their attention to it at all.\r\n\r\nAt lunch, which we had with the colonel, they fixed us. When the subject\r\nof the statue was brought up, the colonel instantly agreed to provide us\r\nwith a winch and also two extra trucks. We needed the trucks all right,\r\nbut we weren’t particularly happy about the winch.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we got back to the monastery, we broke the news to Dr. Mutter.\r\nThe Muse was about to take a trip. He held up his hands in dismay and\r\nsaid it would take us half a day to get the statue loaded. When we told\r\nthe German packers what we had in mind, they made a few clucking noises,\r\nand then began the necessary preparations. The first thing they did was\r\nto get hold of two logs, each about six feet in length and five inches in\r\ndiameter. With the help of a dozen PWs, they got them placed beneath the\r\nbase of the statue. From that point on, it was a matter of slowly rolling\r\nthe statue as the logs rolled. It was arduous work. A distance of well\r\nover four hundred yards was involved, and the last half of it was along a\r\nsloping ramp where it was particularly difficult to keep the heavy marble\r\nunder control.\r\n\r\nOnce the truck was reached, it was necessary to set up a stout runway\r\nfrom the ground to the bed of the truck. This done, the next move was to\r\nplace heavy pads around the base of the statue, so that the cable of the\r\nwinch would not scratch the surface of the marble. It was a tense moment.\r\nWould the winch be strong enough to drag its heavy burden up the runway?\r\nIt began to grind, and slowly the Muse slid up the boards, paused for\r\na quivering instant and then glided majestically along the bed of the\r\ntruck. There were cheers from the PWs who had gathered around the truck\r\nto watch. We all sighed with relief, and then congratulated the little\r\npackers who had engineered the whole operation. Dr. Mutter kept shaking\r\nhis head in disbelief. He told us that when the statue had been brought\r\nto the monastery in the first place, it had taken three hours to unload\r\nit. The present operation had taken forty-five minutes.\r\n\r\nAfter this triumph, the loading of the remaining trucks seemed an\r\nanticlimax, but we kept hard at it for the next six hours. By seven\r\no’clock, all ten of them were finished. All told, we would be a convoy of\r\neighteen trucks.\r\n\r\nWe were on the point of starting down to the village for supper, when\r\nDr. Mutter, even more agitated than he had been before, rushed up and\r\nimplored us to grant him a great favor. Would we, out of the kindness\r\nof our hearts—oh, he knew he had no right to ask such a favor—would we\r\ntake him and his wife and little girl along with us to Linz the next\r\nday? Linz was his home, he had a house there. He had brought his family\r\nto Hohenfurth only because the Nazis wouldn’t allow him to give up his\r\nduties as custodian of the collections at the monastery. Now the Czechs\r\nwere going to be in complete control. He and his family were Austrians\r\nand there was no telling what would happen to them.\r\n\r\nHow news does get around, I thought to myself. We hadn’t said a word\r\nabout the Czechs taking over, but when I expressed the proper surprise\r\nand asked him where he had heard _that_ rumor, he wagged his head as much\r\nas to say, “Oh, I know what I am talking about, all right!”\r\n\r\nMy heart wasn’t exactly bleeding for Dr. Mutter, but at the thought of\r\nhis little girl, who was about the age of my own, I couldn’t say no. I\r\ntold him to be ready to leave at seven the next morning. I didn’t tell\r\nhim how uncertain it was that we would ever get to Linz at all.\r\n\r\nIt was pouring when I crawled out of my bed at six A.M. I seemed to\r\nspecialize in bad weather, particularly when starting out with a convoy!\r\nAt the monastery everything was in order. At the last minute I decided to\r\ntell Dr. Mutter there was a possibility—even a probability—that we would\r\nnot be able to cross over at Linz, and I told him why. He was terrified\r\nwhen I mentioned the prospect of being stopped by the Russians. I assured\r\nhim that we would drop him and his family off at one of the villages on\r\nthe other side of the Austrian border, if we found there was going to be\r\ntrouble. It was cold comfort but the best I had to offer.\r\n\r\nI climbed into the lead truck, Lamont into the tenth, and Leclancher, as\r\nusual, took over the last truck. Leclancher, with his customary ability\r\nto pull a rabbit out of a hat at a critical juncture, had found among his\r\ndrivers one who spoke some Russian, so we had put him at the controls of\r\nthe first truck. It might make a good impression.\r\n\r\nOnce again we had a jeep escort to the border, and there we picked up\r\nthree others to conduct us as far as Linz. The cocky little sergeant in\r\nthe jeep that was to lead came over to my truck, squinted up at me and\r\nsaid, “You look nervous this morning, Lieutenant.”\r\n\r\nWell, I thought, if it’s that apparent, what’s the use of denying it?\r\n“I am,” I said. “This is a big convoy and it’s filled with millions of\r\ndollars’ worth of stuff. I’d hate to have anything happen to it.”\r\n\r\nHe whistled at that. Then, rubbing his hands briskly, he retorted, “And\r\nnothing is going to happen to it.”\r\n\r\nHe took off and we swung in behind him. The first hour was a long one.\r\nThere was more traffic than ever before—a steady stream of carts all\r\nmoving toward Linz. At last we shifted into low gear, and I knew that we\r\nwere on the steep grade leading down to Urfahr. If there were going to be\r\ntrouble, we’d know it in a minute. At that moment, the sergeant in the\r\nlead jeep turned around and waved. I thought, There’s trouble ahead. But\r\nhe was only signaling that the road was clear.\r\n\r\nWe rolled over the rough cobblestones onto the bridge. I saw the gleaming\r\nhelmet liners of the new escort awaiting us as we drew up to the center\r\nof the span. I motioned to one of our new guardians that we would stop at\r\nthe first convenient place on the other side.\r\n\r\nWe were such a long convoy that I thought we’d be halfway through Linz\r\nbefore our escort directed us to pull over to the curb. There we unloaded\r\nthe Mutter family and their luggage. The doctor and his wife were\r\ntearfully grateful and the little girl smiled her thanks.\r\n\r\nI was feeling relaxed and happy and wanted to share my relief with\r\nsomeone, so I suggested to Lamont that we pay our respects to the colonel\r\nwho had warned us not to come through Linz. It was a letdown to find only\r\na warrant officer in the colonel’s anteroom. But he remembered us and was\r\nsurprised to see us again. He said we had been lucky; the latest news\r\nwas that the Russians would move up to the opposite side of the Danube\r\nby noon. We left appropriate messages for the colonel and his adjutant,\r\nreturned to our trucks and headed west toward Lambach.\r\n\r\nAs on the previous trip, the escort turned back at that point. A new\r\none—this time an impressive array of six armed jeeps—shepherded us from\r\nthere. We stopped for lunch with a Corps of Engineers outfit of the 11th\r\nArmored Division on the outskirts of Schwannenstadt. The C.O., Major\r\nAllen, and his executive officer, Captain Myers, welcomed us as warmly as\r\nif we had been commanding generals instead of a motley crew of eighteen\r\nFrench drivers, plus twelve “noncoms” from the escorting jeeps—a total of\r\nthirty-two, including Lamont and me. We doled out K rations to our four\r\npackers, for we couldn’t take civilians into an Army mess.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch I telephoned ahead to Salzburg to ask for an escort from\r\nthere to Munich, requesting that it meet us on the edge of town, east\r\nof the river. The weather had cleared, and drying patches of water on\r\nthe road reflected a blue sky. By the time we had sighted Salzburg it\r\nwas actually hot. As we rolled into the outskirts we were enveloped in\r\nclouds of dust from the steady procession of military vehicles. We waited\r\nin vain for our new escort. After an hour we decided to proceed without\r\none. I didn’t like the idea very much, but it was getting on toward five\r\no’clock, and we wanted to reach Munich in time for supper. We fell far\r\nshort of our goal, being forced to stop once because of a flat tire, and\r\na second time because of carburetor trouble. These two delays cost us\r\nclose to two hours. At seven o’clock we halted by the placid waters of\r\nChiemsee and ate cold C rations in an idyllic setting. It was after nine\r\nwhen we lumbered into the parking area behind the Gargantuan depot at\r\nthe Königsplatz. Lamont and I had twin objectives—hot baths and bed. It\r\ndidn’t take us long to achieve both!\r\n\r\nWe had had every intention of making an early start the next morning,\r\nnot so much because of any blind faith in Benjamin Franklin’s precepts,\r\nbut simply because they stopped serving breakfast in the Third Army\r\nmess shortly before eight o’clock. In fact, the first thing one saw on\r\nentering the mess hall was a large placard which stated peremptorily,\r\n“The mess will be cleared by 0800. By order of the Commanding General.”\r\nAnd such was Third Army discipline—we had a different name for it—that\r\nthe mess hall was completely devoid of life on the stroke of eight.\r\n\r\nIt was a little after seven when I woke up. Lamont was still dead to the\r\nworld, so I shaved and dressed before waking him. There was a malevolent\r\ngleam in his eyes when he finally opened them. He asked frigidly, “Are\r\nyou always so infernally cheerful at this hour of the morning?” I told\r\nhim not to confuse cheerfulness with common courtesy, and mentioned the\r\npeculiar breakfast habits of the Third Army.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at the mess hall with a few minutes to spare. The sergeant at\r\nthe entrance asked to see our mess cards. We had none but I explained\r\nthat we were attached to the headquarters.\r\n\r\n“Temporary duty?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, just temporary duty,” I said with a hint of thankfulness.\r\n\r\n“Then you can’t eat here. Take the bus to the Transient Officers’ Mess\r\ndowntown.”\r\n\r\nI asked about the bus schedule. “Last bus left at 0745,” he said. It was\r\nthen 0750.\r\n\r\n“Well, how do you like ‘chicken’ for breakfast?” I asked Lamont as we\r\nwalked out to the empty street.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to do but walk along until we could hail a passing\r\nvehicle. We had gone a good half mile before we got a lift. Knowing that\r\nthe downtown mess closed at eight, I thought we’d better try the mess\r\nhall at the Military Government Detachment where the officers usually\r\nlingered till about eight-thirty. Among the laggards we found Ham\r\nCoulter and Craig. After airing our views on the subject of Third Army\r\nhospitality, we settled down to a good breakfast and a full account of\r\nour trip back from Hohenfurth. We told Craig that a couple of our French\r\ndrivers were to meet us at the Collecting Point at nine. They were to\r\nbring some of the trucks around for unloading before noon. It was a\r\nSaturday and in Bavaria everything stopped at noon. Once in a great while\r\nCraig could persuade members of his civilian crew to work on Saturday\r\nafternoons, but it was a custom they didn’t hold with, so he avoided\r\nit whenever possible. There were those who frowned on this kind of\r\n“coddling,” as they called it, but they just didn’t know their Bavarians.\r\nCraig did, and I think he got more work out of his people than if he had\r\ntried to change their habits.\r\n\r\nWe spent part of the morning with Herr Döbler, the chief packer, at\r\nthe Collecting Point, helping him decipher our trucking lists, hastily\r\nprepared at Hohenfurth in longhand. Meanwhile the trucks, one after\r\nanother, drew up to the unloading platform and disgorged their precious\r\ncontents. The descent of the marble Muse caused a flurry of excitement.\r\nOur description of loading the statue had lost nothing in the telling\r\nand we were anxious to see how she had stood the trip. The roads had\r\nbeen excruciatingly rough in places, especially at Linz and on the dread\r\ndetour near Rosenheim. At each chuckhole I had offered up a little\r\nprayer. But my worries had been groundless—she emerged from the truck in\r\nall her gleaming, snow-white perfection.\r\n\r\nJust before noon, Captain Posey summoned Lamont and me to his office. He\r\ncut short our account of the Hohenfurth operation with the news that we\r\nwere to leave that afternoon for the great mine at Alt Aussee. At last we\r\nwere to join George—both of us. George was going to have his team after\r\nall.\r\n\r\nA command car had already been ordered. The driver was to pick us up at\r\none-thirty. Posey got out a map and showed us the road we were to take\r\nbeyond Salzburg. As his finger ran along the red line of the route marked\r\nwith the names St. Gilgen, St. Wolfgang, Bad Ischl and Bad Aussee, our\r\nexcitement grew. Untold treasures were waiting to be unearthed at the end\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nHe said that the trip would take about six hours. We could perhaps stop\r\noff at Bad Aussee for supper. Two naval officers—Lieutenants Plaut and\r\nRousseau, both of them OSS—had set up a special interrogation center\r\nthere, an establishment known simply as “House 71,” and were making an\r\nintensive investigation of German art-looting activities. They lived very\r\nwell, Posey said with a grin. We could do a lot worse than to sample\r\ntheir hospitality. I knew Jim Plaut and Ted Rousseau—in fact had seen\r\nthem at Versailles not so many weeks ago—so I thought we could prevail on\r\nthem to take us in.\r\n\r\nThe mention of food reminded Lamont that we ought to pick up a generous\r\nsupply of rations—the kind called “ten-in-ones”—somewhere along the\r\nroad. The captain gave us a written order for that, and also provided\r\neach of us with a letter stating that we were authorized to “enter\r\nart repositories in the area occupied by the Third U. S. Army.” Our\r\nearlier permits had referred to specific localities. These were blanket\r\npermits—marks of signal favor, we gathered from the ceremonious manner in\r\nwhich they were presented to us.\r\n\r\nThere were various odds and ends to be attended to before we could get\r\noff, among them the business of our PX rations. That was Lamont’s idea.\r\nHe said that we might not be able to get them later. He was right; they\r\nwere the last ones we were able to lay our hands on for three weeks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: German altarpiece from the Louvre Museum, by the Master of\r\nthe Holy Kinship, was acquired by Göring in exchange for paintings from\r\nhis own collection.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This panel, _Mary Magdalene_, by van Scorel, was given to\r\nHitler by Göring.

I was now\r\nso familiar with the road between Munich and Salzburg that I felt like\r\na commuter. Just outside Salzburg, Lamont began looking for signs that\r\nwould lead us to a Quartermaster depot. He finally caught sight of one\r\nand, after following a devious route which took us several miles off the\r\nmain road, we found the depot. We were issued two compact and very heavy\r\nwooden boxes bound with metal strips. We dumped them on the floor of the\r\ncommand car and drove on into town.\r\n\r\nAcross the river, we picked up a secondary road which led out of the\r\ncity in a southeasterly direction. For some miles it wound through hills\r\nso densely wooded that we could see but little of the country. Then,\r\nemerging from the tunnel of evergreens, we skirted Fuschl See, the first\r\nof the lovely Alpine lakes in that region. Somewhere along its shores, we\r\nhad been told, Ribbentrop had had a castle. It was being used now as a\r\nrecreation center for American soldiers.\r\n\r\nOur road led into more rugged country. We continued to climb and with\r\neach curve of the road the scenery became more spectacular. After an\r\nhour’s drive we reached St. Gilgen, its neat white houses and picturesque\r\nchurch spire silhouetted against the blue waters of St. Wolfgang See.\r\nThen on past the village of Strobl and finally into the crooked streets\r\nof Bad Ischl, where the old Emperor Franz Josef had spent so many\r\nsummers. From Bad Ischl our road ribboned through Laufen and Goisern to\r\nSt. Agatha.\r\n\r\nBeyond St. Agatha lay the Pötschen Pass. The road leading up to it was a\r\nseries of hairpin turns and dangerous grades. As we ground slowly up the\r\nlast steep stretch to the summit, I wondered what route George was using\r\nfor his convoys from the mine. Surely not this one. Large trucks couldn’t\r\nclimb that interminable grade. I found out later that this was the only\r\nroad to Alt Aussee.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the pass, the road descended gradually into a\r\nrolling valley and, in another half hour, we clattered into the narrow\r\nmain street of Bad Aussee. From there it was only a few miles to Alt\r\nAussee. Midway between the two villages we hoped to find the house of our\r\nOSS friends.\r\n\r\nWe came upon it unexpectedly, around a sharp bend in the road. It was a\r\ntall, gabled villa, built in the gingerbread style of fifty years ago.\r\nHaving pictured a romantic chalet tucked away in the mountains, I was\r\ndisappointed by this rather commonplace suburban structure, standing\r\nbehind a stout iron fence with padlocked gates, within a stone’s throw of\r\nthe main highway.\r\n\r\nJim and Ted received us hospitably and took us to an upper veranda with\r\nwicker chairs and a table immaculately set for dinner. We were joined\r\nby a wiry young lieutenant colonel, named Harold S. Davitt, who bore a\r\npronounced resemblance to the Duke of Windsor. He was the commanding\r\nofficer of a battalion of the 11th Armored Division stationed at Alt\r\nAussee, the little village just below the mine. Colonel Davitt’s men\r\nconstituted the security guard at the mine. He knew and admired our\r\nfriend George Stout. It was strange and pleasant to be again in an\r\natmosphere of well-ordered domesticity. To us it seemed rather a fine\r\npoint when one of our hosts rebuked the waitress for serving the wine in\r\nthe wrong kind of glasses.\r\n\r\nDuring dinner we noticed a man pacing about the garden below. He was\r\nWalter Andreas Hofer, who had been Göring’s agent and adviser in art\r\nmatters. A shrewd and enterprising Berlin dealer before the war, Hofer\r\nhad succeeded in ingratiating himself with the Reichsmarschall. He,\r\nmore than any other single individual, had been responsible for shaping\r\nGöring’s taste and had played the stellar role in building up his\r\npriceless collection of Old Masters.\r\n\r\nSome of his methods had been ingenious. He was credited with having\r\ndevised the system of “birthday gifts”—a scheme whereby important\r\nobjects were added to the collection at no cost to the Reichsmarschall.\r\nEach year, before Göring’s birthday on January twelfth, Hofer wrote\r\nletters to wealthy industrialists and businessmen suggesting that the\r\nReichsmarschall would be gratified to receive a token of their continued\r\nregard for him. Then he would designate a specific work of art—and the\r\nprice. More often than not, the piece in question had already been\r\nacquired. The prospective donor had only to foot the bill. Now and then\r\nthe victim of this shakedown protested the price, but he usually came\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nIn Hofer, the Reichsmarschall had had a henchman as rapacious and greedy\r\nas himself. And Hofer had possessed what his master lacked—a wide\r\nknowledge of European collections and the international art market.\r\nGöring had been a gold mine and Hofer had made the most of it.\r\n\r\nHofer had been arrested shortly after the close of hostilities. He\r\nhad been a “guest” at House 71 for some weeks now, and was being\r\ngrilled daily by our “cloak and dagger boys.” They were probing into\r\nhis activities of the past few years and had already extracted an\r\namazing lot of information for incorporation into an exhaustive report\r\non the Göring collection and “how it grew.” Hofer was just one of a\r\nlong procession of witnesses who were being questioned by Plaut and\r\nRousseau in the course of their tireless investigation of the artistic\r\ndepredations of the top Nazis. These OSS officers knew their business.\r\nWith infinite patience, they were cross-examining their witnesses\r\nand gradually extracting information which was to lend an authentic\r\nfascination to their reports.\r\n\r\nHofer’s wife, they told us, had ably assisted her husband. Her talents\r\nas an expert restorer had been useful. She had been charged with the\r\ntechnical care of the Göring collection—no small job when one stopped\r\nto consider that it numbered over a thousand pictures. Indeed, there\r\nhad been more than enough work to keep one person busy all the time. We\r\nlearned that Frau Hofer was living temporarily at Berchtesgaden where,\r\nuntil recently, she had been allowed to attend to emergency repairs on\r\nsome of the Göring pictures there.\r\n\r\nWe turned back to the subject of Hofer, who had not yet finished his\r\ndaily constitutional and could be seen still pacing back and forth below\r\nus. He was, they said, a voluble witness and had an extraordinary memory.\r\nHe could recall minute details of complicated transactions which had\r\ntaken place several years before. On one occasion Hofer had recommended\r\nan exchange of half a dozen paintings of secondary importance for two\r\nof the very first quality. As I recall, the deal involved a group of\r\nseventeenth century Dutch pictures on the one hand, and two Bouchers on\r\nthe others. Hofer had been able to reel off the names of all of them and\r\neven give the price of each. It was just such feats of memory, they said\r\nwith a laugh, that made his vague and indefinite answers to certain\r\nother questions seem more than merely inconsistent.\r\n\r\nListening to our hosts, we had forgotten the time. It was getting late\r\nand George would be wondering what had happened to us. There had been a\r\nheavy downpour while we were at dinner. The weather had cleared now, but\r\nthe evergreens were dripping as we pulled out of the drive.\r\n\r\nThe road to Alt Aussee ran along beside the swift and milky waters of an\r\nAlpine river. It was a beautiful drive in the soft evening light. The\r\nlittle village with its winding streets and brightly painted chalets was\r\nan odd setting for GIs and jeeps, to say nothing of our lumbering command\r\ncar.\r\n\r\nWe found our way to the Command Post, which occupied a small hotel in\r\nthe center of the village. There we turned sharply to the right, into a\r\nroad so steep that it made the precipitous grades over which we had come\r\nearlier that afternoon seem level by comparison. We drove about a mile on\r\nthis road and I was beginning to wonder if we wouldn’t soon be above the\r\ntimber line—perhaps even in the region of “eternal snow” to which Roger\r\nhad once so poetically referred—when we came to a bleak stone building\r\nperched precariously on a narrow strip of level ground. Behind it, a\r\nthousand feet below, stretched an unbroken sea of deep pine forests.\r\nThis was the control post, and the guard, a burly GI armed with a rifle,\r\nsignaled us to stop. We asked for Lieutenant Stout. He motioned up the\r\nroad, where, in the gathering dusk, we could distinguish the outlines of\r\na low building facing an irregular terrace. It was a distance of about\r\ntwo hundred yards. We drove on up to the entrance where we found George\r\nwaiting for us.\r\n\r\nHe took us into the building which he said contained the administrative\r\noffices of the salt mine—the Steinbergwerke, now a government\r\nmonopoly—and his own living quarters. We entered a kind of vestibule\r\nwith white plaster walls and a cement floor. A narrow track, the rails\r\nof which were not more than eighteen inches apart, led from the entrance\r\nto a pair of heavy doors in the far wall. “That,” said George, “is the\r\nentrance to the mine.”\r\n\r\nHe led the way to a room on the second floor. Its most conspicuous\r\nfeature was a large porcelain stove. The woodwork was knotty pine. Aside\r\nfrom the two single beds, the only furniture was a built-in settle with\r\na writing table which filled one corner. The table had a red and white\r\nchecked cover and over it, suspended from the ceiling, was an adjustable\r\nlamp with a red and white checked shade. Opening off this room was\r\nanother bedroom, also pine-paneled, which was occupied by the captain\r\nof the guard and one other officer. George apologized for the fact that\r\nthe only entrance to the other room was through ours. Apparently, in the\r\nold days, the two rooms had formed a suite—ours having been the sitting\r\nroom—reserved for important visitors to the mine. For the first few days\r\nthere was so much coming and going that we had all the privacy of Grand\r\nCentral Station, but we soon got used to the traffic. George and Steve\r\nKovalyak shared a room just down the hall. Lamont had spoken of Steve\r\nwhen we had been at Hohenfurth, and I was curious to meet this newcomer\r\nto the MFA&A ranks. George said that Steve would be back before long. He\r\nhad gone out with Shrady. That was Lieutenant Frederick Shrady, the third\r\nmember of the trio of Monuments Officers at the mine.\r\n\r\nWhile Lamont and I were getting our things unpacked, George sat and\r\ntalked with us about the work at the mine and what he expected us to\r\ndo. As he talked he soaked his hand in his helmet liner filled with hot\r\nwater. He had skinned one of his knuckles and an infection had set in.\r\nThe doctors wanted to bring the thing to a head before lancing it the\r\nnext day. I had noticed earlier that one of his hands looked red and\r\nswollen. But George hadn’t said anything about it. As he was not one to\r\nrelish solicitous inquiries, I refrained from making any comment.\r\n\r\nGeorge outlined the local situation briefly. The principal bottle-neck\r\nin the operation lay in the selection of the stuff which was to be\r\nbrought out of the various mine chambers. There were, he said, something\r\nlike ten thousand pictures stored in them, to say nothing of sculpture,\r\nfurniture, tapestries, rugs and books. At the moment he was concentrating\r\non the pictures and he wanted to get the best of them out first. The less\r\nimportant ones—particularly the works of the nineteenth century German\r\npainters whom Hitler admired so much—could wait for later removal.\r\n\r\nHe and Steve and Shrady had their hands full above ground. That left\r\nonly Sieber, the German restorer, who had been at the mine ever since\r\nit had been converted into an art repository, to choose the paintings\r\ndown below. In addition Sieber had to supervise the other subterranean\r\noperations, which included carrying the paintings from the storage\r\nracks, dividing them into groups according to size, and padding the\r\ncorners so that the canvases wouldn’t rub together on the way up to the\r\nmine entrance. Where we could be of real help would be down in the mine\r\nchambers, picking out the cream of the pictures and getting them up\r\ntopside. (George’s vocabulary was peppered with nautical expressions.)\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his deliberate recital, we heard a door slam. The chorus\r\nof “Giannina Mia” sung in a piercingly melodic baritone echoed from the\r\nstairs. “Steve’s home,” said George.\r\n\r\nA second later there was a knock on the door and the owner of the voice\r\nmaterialized. Steve looked a bit startled when he caught sight of two\r\nstrange faces, but he grinned good-naturedly as George introduced us.\r\n\r\n“I thought you were going out on the town with Shrady tonight,” said\r\nGeorge.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Steve, “I left him down in the village and came back to talk\r\nto Kress.”\r\n\r\nKress was an expert photographer who had been with the Kassel Museum\r\nbefore the war. He had been captured when our troops took over at the\r\nmine just as the war ended. Since Steve’s arrival, he had been his\r\npersonal PW. Steve was an enthusiastic amateur and had acquired all kinds\r\nof photographic equipment. Kress, we gathered, was showing him how to use\r\nit. Their “conversations” were something of a mystery, because Steve knew\r\nno German, Kress no English.\r\n\r\n“I use my High German, laddies,” Steve would say with a crafty grin and a\r\nlift of the eyebrows, as he teetered on the balls of his feet.\r\n\r\nWe came to the conclusion that “High German” was so called because it\r\ntranscended all known rules of grammar and pronunciation. But, for\r\nthe two of them, it worked. Steve—stocky, gruff and belligerent—and\r\nKress—timid, beady-eyed and patient—would spend hours together. They\r\nwere a comical pair. Steve was always in command and very much the\r\ncaptor. Kress was long-suffering and had a kind of doglike devotion to\r\nhis master, whose alternating jocular and tyrannical moods he seemed to\r\naccept with equanimity and understanding. But all this we learned later.\r\n\r\nThat first evening, while George went on with his description of\r\nthe work, Steve sat quietly appraising Lamont and me with his keen,\r\ngray-green eyes. He had worked with Lamont at Bernterode, so I was his\r\nmain target. Now and then he would look over at George and throw in a\r\nremark. Between the two there existed an extraordinary bond. As far as\r\nSteve was concerned, George was perfect, and Steve had no use for anyone\r\nwho thought otherwise. If, at the end of a hard day, he occasionally\r\nbeefed about George and his merciless perfection—well, that was Steve’s\r\nprerogative. For his part, George had a fatherly affection for Steve and\r\na quiet admiration for his energy and resourcefulness and the way he\r\nhandled the men under him.\r\n\r\nPresently Steve announced that it was late and went off to bed. I\r\nwondered if he had sized me up. There was a flicker of amusement in\r\nLamont’s eyes and I guessed that he was wondering the same thing. When\r\nGeorge got up to go, he said, “You’ll find hot water down in the kitchen\r\nin the morning. Breakfast will be at seven-thirty.”\r\n\r\nSteve roused us early with a knock on the door and said he’d show us\r\nthe way to the kitchen. We rolled out, painfully conscious of the cold\r\nmountain air. Below, in the warm kitchen, the sun was pouring in through\r\nthe open door. There were still traces of snow on the mountaintops. The\r\nhighest peak, Steve said, was Loser. Its snowy coronet glistened in the\r\nbright morning light.\r\n\r\nWhen my eyes became accustomed to the glare, I noticed that there were\r\nseveral other people in the kitchen. One of them, a wrinkled little\r\nfellow wearing _Lederhosen_ and white socks, was standing by the stove.\r\nSteve saluted them cheerfully with a wave of his towel. They acknowledged\r\nhis greeting with good-natured nods and gruff monosyllables. These\r\ncurious mountain people, he said, belonged to families that had worked in\r\nthe mine for five hundred years. They were working for us now, as members\r\nof his evacuation crew.\r\n\r\nWe washed at a row of basins along one wall. Above them hung a sign\r\nlettered with the homely motto:\r\n\r\n    “_Nach der Arbeit_\r\n    _Vor dem Essen_\r\n    _Hände waschen_\r\n    _Nicht vergessen._”\r\n\r\nIt rang a poignant bell in my memory. That same admonition to wash before\r\neating had hung in the little pension at near-by Gründlsee where I had\r\nspent a summer fifteen years ago.\r\n\r\nOur mess hall was in the guardhouse down the road, the square stone\r\nbuilding where the sentry had challenged us the night before. We lined\r\nup with our plates and, when they had been heaped with scrambled eggs,\r\nhelped ourselves to toast, jam and coffee and sat down at a long wooden\r\ntable in the adjoining room. George was finishing his breakfast as the\r\nthree of us came in. With him was Lieutenant Shrady, who had recently\r\nbeen commissioned a Monuments officer at Bad Homburg. Subsequently he had\r\nbeen sent down to Alt Aussee by Captain Posey. He was a lean, athletic,\r\ngood-looking fellow. Although he helped occasionally with the loading,\r\nhis primary duties at the mine were of an administrative nature—handling\r\nthe workmen’s payrolls through the local Military Government Detachment,\r\nobtaining their food rations, making inspections in the area, filing\r\nreports and so on. After he and George had left, Steve told us that\r\nShrady was a portrait painter. Right now he was working on a portrait of\r\nhis civilian interpreter-secretary who, according to Steve, was something\r\nrather special in the way of Viennese beauty. This was a new slant on\r\nthe work at the mine and I was curious to know more about the glamorous\r\nMaria, whom Steve described as being “beaucoup beautiful.” But George\r\nwas waiting to take us down into the mine. As we walked up the road,\r\nSteve explained to us that the miners worked in two shifts—one crew\r\nfrom four in the morning until midday, another from noon until eight in\r\nthe evening. The purpose of the early morning shift was to maintain an\r\nuninterrupted flow of “stuff” from the mine, so that the daytime loading\r\nof the trucks would not bog down for lack of cargo.\r\n\r\nAt the building in which the mine entrance was located we found George\r\nwith a group of the miners. It was just eight o’clock and the day’s work\r\nwas starting. We were introduced to two men dressed in white uniforms\r\nwhich gave them an odd, hybrid appearance—a cross between a street\r\ncleaner and a musical-comedy hussar. This outfit consisted of a white\r\nduck jacket and trousers. The jacket had a wide, capelike collar reaching\r\nto the shoulders. Two rows of ornamental black buttons converging at the\r\nwaistline adorned the front of the jacket, and a similar row ran up the\r\nsleeves from cuff to elbow. In place of a belt, the jacket was held in\r\nplace by a tape drawstring. A black garrison cap completed the costume.\r\n\r\nThe two men were Karl Sieber, the restorer, and Max Eder, an engineer\r\nfrom Vienna. It was Eder’s job to list the contents of each truck.\r\nPerched on a soapbox, he sat all day at the loading entrance, record\r\nbook and paper before him on a makeshift desk. He wrote down the number\r\nof each object as it was carried through the door to the truck outside.\r\nThe truck list was made in duplicate: the original was sent to Munich\r\nwith the convoy; the copy was kept at the mine to be incorporated in the\r\npermanent records which Lieutenant Shrady was compiling in his office on\r\nthe floor above.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of their occupancy, the Nazis had recorded the loot,\r\npiece by piece, as it entered the mine. The records were voluminous and\r\nfilled many ledgers. But, during the closing months of the war, such\r\nquantities of loot had poured in that the system had broken down. Instead\r\nof a single accession number, an object was sometimes given a number\r\nwhich merely indicated with what shipment it had arrived. Occasionally\r\nthere would be several numbers on a single piece. Frequently a piece\r\nwould have no number at all. In spite of this confusion, Eder managed\r\nsomehow to produce orderly lists. If the information they contained was\r\nnot always definitive, it was invariably accurate.\r\n\r\nGeorge was anxious to get started. “It’s cold down in the mine,” he said.\r\n“You’d better put on the warmest things you brought with you.”\r\n\r\n“How cold is it?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Forty degrees, Fahrenheit,” he said. “The temperature doesn’t vary\r\nappreciably during the year. I believe it rises to forty-seven in the\r\nwinter. And the humidity is equally constant, about sixty-five per cent.\r\nThat’s why this particular salt mine was chosen as a repository, as you\r\nprobably know.”\r\n\r\nWhile we went up to get our jackets and mufflers, George ordered Sieber\r\nto hitch up the train. When we returned we noticed that the miners, who\r\nresembled a troop of Walt Disney dwarfs, were wearing heavy sweaters and\r\nthick woolen jackets for protection against the subterranean cold.\r\n\r\nThe train’s locomotion was provided by a small gasoline engine with\r\nnarrow running boards on either side which afforded foothold for the\r\noperator. Attached to it were half a dozen miniature flat-cars or\r\n“dollies.” The miners called them “Hünde,” that is, dogs. They were about\r\nfive feet long, and on them were placed heavy wooden boxes approximately\r\ntwo feet wide. The sides were roughly two feet high.\r\n\r\nFollowing George’s example, we piled a couple of blankets on the bottom\r\nof one of the boxes and squeezed ourselves in. Each box, with judicious\r\ncrowding, would accommodate two people facing each other.\r\n\r\nAt a signal from Sieber, who was sardined into a boxcar with George,\r\none of the gnomes primed the engine. After a couple of false starts,\r\nit began to chug and the train rumbled into the dim cavern ahead. For\r\nthe first few yards, the irregular walls were whitewashed, but we soon\r\nentered a narrow tunnel cut through the natural rock. It varied in height\r\nand width. In some places there would be overhead clearance of seven or\r\neight feet, and a foot or more on either side. In others the passageway\r\nwas just wide enough for the train, and the jagged rocks above seemed\r\nmenacingly close. There were electric lights in part of the tunnel, but\r\nthese were strung at irregular intervals. They shed a dim glow on the\r\nmoist walls.\r\n\r\nGeorge shouted that we would stop first at the Kaiser Josef mine. The\r\ntrack branched and a few minutes later we stopped beside a heavy iron\r\ndoor set in the wall of the passageway. This part of the tunnel was not\r\nilluminated, so carbide lamps were produced. By their flickering light,\r\nGeorge found the keyhole and unlocked the door.\r\n\r\nWe followed him into the unlighted mine chamber. Flashlights supplemented\r\nthe wavering flames of the miners’ lamps. Ahead of us we could make out\r\nrow after row of huge packing cases. Beyond them was a broad wooden\r\nplatform. The rays of our flashlights revealed a bulky object resting on\r\nthe center of the platform. We came closer. We could see that it was a\r\nstatue, a marble statue. And then we knew—it was Michelangelo’s Madonna\r\nfrom Bruges, one of the world’s great masterpieces. The light of our\r\nlamps played over the soft folds of the Madonna’s robe, the delicate\r\nmodeling of the face. Her grave eyes looked down, seemed only half aware\r\nof the sturdy Child nestling close against her, one hand firmly held in\r\nhers. It is one of the earliest works of the great sculptor and one of\r\nhis loveliest. The incongruous setting of the bare boards served only to\r\nenhance its gentle beauty.\r\n\r\nThe statue was carved by Michelangelo in 1501, when he was only\r\ntwenty-six. It was bought from the sculptor by the Mouscron brothers\r\nof Bruges, who presented it to the Church of Notre Dame early in the\r\nsixteenth century. There it had remained until September 1944, when the\r\nGermans, using the excuse that it must be “saved” from the American\r\nbarbarians, carried it off.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the war, the statue had been removed from its\r\ntraditional place in the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament to a specially\r\nbuilt shelter in another part of the church. The shelter was not sealed,\r\nso visitors could see the statue on request. Then one afternoon in\r\nSeptember 1944, the Bishop of Bruges, prompted by the suggestion of a\r\nGerman officer that the statue was not adequately protected, ordered the\r\nshelter bricked up. That night, before his orders could be carried out,\r\nGerman officers arrived at the church and demanded that the dean hand\r\nover the statue. With an armed crew standing by, they removed it from the\r\nshelter, dumped it onto a mattress on the floor of a Red Cross lorry and\r\ndrove away. At the same time, they perpetrated another act of vandalism.\r\nThey took with them eleven paintings belonging to the church. Among them\r\nwere works by Gerard David, Van Dyck and Caravaggio. The statue and the\r\npictures were brought to the Alt Aussee mine. It was a miracle that the\r\ntwo lorries with their precious cargo got through safely, for the roads\r\nwere being constantly strafed by Allied planes.\r\n\r\nNow we were about to prepare the Madonna for the trip back. This time she\r\nwould have more than a mattress for protection.\r\n\r\nIn the same mine chamber with the Michelangelo was another plundered\r\nmasterpiece of sculpture—an ancient Greek sarcophagus from Salonika. It\r\nhad been excavated only a few years ago and was believed to date from the\r\nsixth century B.C. Already the Greek government was clamoring for its\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nOn our way back to the train, George said that the other cases—the ones\r\nwe had seen when we first went into the Kaiser Josef mine—contained the\r\ndismantled panels of the Millionen Zimmer and the Chinesisches Kabinett\r\nfrom Schönbrunn. The Alt Aussee mine, he said, had been originally\r\nselected by the Viennese as a depot for Austrian works of art, which\r\naccounted for the panels being there. They had been brought to the mine\r\nin 1942. Then, a year later, the Nazis took it over as a repository for\r\nthe collections of the proposed Führer Museum at Linz.\r\n\r\nWe boarded the train again and rumbled along a dark tunnel to the Mineral\r\nKabinett, one of the smaller mine chambers. Again there was an iron\r\ndoor to be unlocked. We walked through a vestibule into a low-ceilinged\r\nroom about twenty feet square. The walls were light partitions of\r\nunfinished lumber. Ranged about them were the panels of the great Ghent\r\naltarpiece—the _Adoration of the Mystic Lamb_—their jewel-like beauty\r\nundimmed after five hundred years. The colors were as resplendent as the\r\nday they were painted by Hubert and Jan van Eyck in 1432.\r\n\r\nThis famous altarpiece, the greatest single treasure of Belgium, had also\r\nbeen seized by the Germans. One of the earliest examples of oil painting,\r\nit consisted originally of twelve panels, eight of which were painted on\r\nboth sides. It was planned as a giant triptych of four central panels,\r\nwith four panels at either side. The matching side panels were designed\r\nto fold together like shutters over a window. Therefore they were painted\r\non both sides.\r\n\r\nI knew something of the history of the altarpiece. It belonged originally\r\nto the Cathedral of St. Bavon in Ghent. Early in the nineteenth century,\r\nthe wings had been purchased by Edward Solly, an Englishman living in\r\nGermany. In 1816, he had sold them to the King of Prussia and they were\r\nplaced in the Berlin Museum. There they had remained until restored to\r\nBelgium by the terms of the Versailles Treaty. From 1918 on, the entire\r\ntriptych was again in the Cathedral of St. Bavon. In 1933, the attention\r\nof the world was drawn to the altarpiece when the panel in the lower\r\nleft-hand corner was stolen. This was one of the panels painted on both\r\nsides. The obverse represented the _Knights of Christ_; the reverse, _St.\r\nJohn the Baptist_.\r\n\r\nAccording to the story, the thief sent the cathedral authorities an\r\nanonymous letter demanding a large sum of money and guarantee of his\r\nimmunity for the return of the panels. As proof that the panels were in\r\nhis possession, he is said to have returned the reverse panel with his\r\nextortion letter. The authorities agreed to these terms but sought to lay\r\na trap for the culprit. Their attempt was unsuccessful and nothing was\r\nheard of the panel until a year or so later.\r\n\r\nOn his deathbed, the thief—one of the beadles of the cathedral—confessed\r\nhis guilt. As he lay dying, he managed to gasp, “You will find the panel\r\n...” but he got no further. The panel has never been found.\r\n\r\nIn May 1940, the Belgians entrusted the altarpiece to France for\r\nsafekeeping. Packed in ten cases, it was stored in the Château of Pau\r\ntogether with many important works of art from the Louvre. The Director\r\nof the French National Museums, mindful of his grave responsibilities,\r\nobtained explicit guarantees from the Germans that these treasures would\r\nbe left inviolate. By the terms of this agreement, confirmed by the\r\nVichy Ministry of Fine Arts, the Ghent altar was not to be moved without\r\nthe joint consent of the Director of the French National Museums, the\r\nMayor of Ghent and the German organization for the protection of French\r\nmonuments.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this contract, the Director of the French National\r\nMuseums learned quite by accident in August 1942 that the altarpiece had\r\njust been taken to Paris. Dr. Ernst Büchner, who was director of the\r\nBavarian State Museums, in company with three other German officers had\r\ngone to Pau the day before with a truck and ordered the Director of the\r\nMuseum there to hand over the retable. A telegram from M. Bonnard, Vichy\r\nMinister of Fine Arts, arriving simultaneously, reinforced Dr. Büchner’s\r\ndemands. Nothing was known of its destination or whereabouts, beyond the\r\nfact that it had been taken to Paris.\r\n\r\nThere the matter rested until the summer of 1944. With the arrival of\r\nAllied armies on French soil, reports of missing masterpieces were\r\nreceived by our MFA&A officers. The Ghent altarpiece was among them.\r\nBut there were no clues as to where it had gone. Months passed and by\r\nthe time our troops had approached Germany, our Monuments officers, all\r\nsimilarly briefed with photographs and other pertinent data concerning\r\nstolen works of art, began to hear rumors about the _Lamb_. It might be\r\nin the Rhine fortress of Ehrenbreitstein; perhaps it had been taken to\r\nthe Berghof at Berchtesgaden or possibly to Karinhall, Göring’s palatial\r\nestate near Berlin. And then again it might have been flown out of the\r\ncountry altogether—to one of the neutral countries, Spain or Switzerland.\r\n\r\nCaptain Posey and Private Lincoln Kirstein picked up additional rumors\r\nfrom museum directors in Luxembourg. They had heard that the altarpiece\r\nwas in a salt mine, but they had also been told that it was in the\r\nvaults of the Berlin Reichsbank. It was impossible to reconcile these\r\nconflicting pieces of information. Finally, near Trier, Posey and\r\nKirstein tracked down a young German scholar who had been in France\r\nduring the occupation. Lincoln told me later that it was hard to believe\r\nthat this unassuming fellow had been high in the confidence of Göring and\r\nother members of the Nazi inner circle. From him they learned that the\r\naltarpiece had been taken to Alt Aussee.\r\n\r\nThen followed the rapid advance across Germany. To Posey and Kirstein it\r\nwas a period of agonizing suspense. They couldn’t be sure that Third Army\r\nwould move into the area in which the mine lay. Just as their hopes began\r\nto fade, occupancy of the cherished area did fall to Third Army. Tactical\r\ntroops were alerted to the importance of the isolated mountain region.\r\nIt was of no significance as a military objective and would doubtless\r\notherwise have been left unoccupied for the moment. They pressed forward\r\nthrough Bad Ischl and the wild confusion of capitulating German troops to\r\nthe wilder confusion of surrendering SS units in the little village of\r\nAlt Aussee itself. From there it was but a mile to the mine.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the mine, they found it heavily guarded by men of\r\nthe 80th Infantry Division, but the mine had been dynamited. It wasn’t\r\npossible to go into the mine chambers. Armed with acetylene lamps, Posey\r\nand Lincoln entered the main tunnel. They groped their way along the damp\r\npassageway for a distance of a quarter of a mile or more before they\r\nreached the debris of the first block. After assessing the damage they\r\nreturned to consult the Austrian mineworkers. The miners said it would\r\ntake from ten days to two weeks to clear the passageway. Captain Posey\r\nthought that the Army Engineers could do it in less than a week, perhaps\r\nin two or three days. Both were wrong. They entered the first mine\r\nchamber the next day.\r\n\r\nAnd now, here before us, stood the fabulous panels which they had found\r\non that May morning a few weeks before. While we examined them, Sieber\r\npieced out the one gap in the story of the altarpiece: the Nazis had\r\ntaken it from Paris to the Castle of Neuschwanstein where a restorer from\r\nMunich worked on the blisters which had developed on some of the panels.\r\nThe altarpiece remained at the castle for two years. It was brought to\r\nthe mine in the summer of 1944. Pieces of waxed paper were still affixed\r\nto the surface of the panels, on the places where the blisters had been\r\nlaid. The big panel representing St. John had split lengthwise with the\r\ngrain of wood. This had happened at the mine. Sieber had repaired it,\r\nand George said he had done a good job. As we were leaving the Mineral\r\nKabinett, Sieber asked me if Andrew Mellon really had offered ten million\r\ndollars for the altarpiece. People had said so in Berlin. I hated to tell\r\nhim that the story was without foundation, so far as I knew.\r\n\r\nWhen we came out of the mine at noon we found that Steve and Shrady had\r\nfinished loading two trucks. They said they had enough pictures left\r\nto fill two more. The afternoon crew would be coming on at four. In\r\nthe meantime it was up to Lamont and me to select at least two hundred\r\npaintings, so that the loading could go on without interruption.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch we returned to the mine with Sieber. This time the trip on\r\nthe train was much longer. Our objective was a part of the mine called\r\nthe Springerwerke. Owing to the peculiar honeycomb structure of the mine\r\nnetwork, it had been necessary to establish guard posts at intervals\r\nalong the tunnels. One of these was at the entrance to the Springerwerke.\r\nTwo GIs were on duty. It was a dismal assignment as well as a cold one.\r\nThey were bundled up in fleece-lined coats which had been made for German\r\ntroops on the Russian front. George and Steve had obtained about two\r\nhundred of these coats and were using them for packing unframed pictures.\r\nEach time a convoy of empty trucks returned from Munich, they counted the\r\ncoats carefully to make sure that none had disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe Springerwerke contained more than two thousand paintings. They were\r\narranged in two tiers around three sides and down the center of a room\r\nfifty feet long and thirty feet wide. In one section we found thirty\r\nor forty Italian paintings of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries\r\nfrom the well known Lanz Collection of Amsterdam. Next to them we came\r\nupon the group of canvases, which the Germans in their greedy haste had\r\nfilched from Bruges when they had made off with the Michelangelo Madonna.\r\nAside from these two lots, the pictures had been stored according to\r\nsize rather than by provenance. It was a bewildering assortment. Quality\r\nwas to be our guide in making this initial selection. And as a kind\r\nof corollary, we were to set aside for shipment all pictures bearing\r\nthe infamous “E.R.R.” stencil—the initials of the Rosenberg looting\r\norganization. We had Sieber and four of the gnomes to help. Sieber stood\r\nby with list and flashlight. Two of the gnomes hauled out the pictures\r\nfor us to examine. The other two put protective pads of paper filled with\r\nexcelsior across the corners of the ones chosen.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the afternoon we had picked out between a hundred and\r\nfifty and two hundred paintings. The crew which had come on at four had\r\nalready gone up with one trainload. We took stock of the lot waiting\r\nto go. We hadn’t done so badly: our selection included works of Hals,\r\nBreughel, Titian, Rembrandt, Tintoretto, Rubens, Van Dyck, Lancret,\r\nNattier, Reynolds, and a raft of smaller examples of the seventeenth\r\ncentury Dutch school. Not a dud among them, we agreed smugly.\r\n\r\nBefore we knocked off for supper, Sieber showed us an adjoining room\r\ndivided into small compartments. Each one contained a miscellaneous\r\nassortment of art objects—pictures, porcelain, bric-a-brac of various\r\nkinds. Each compartment bore a label with the name of a different family,\r\nfifteen or twenty in all. They were the pilfered possessions of Viennese\r\nJewish families. Our feelings were of both pathos and disgust. After\r\nworking with the fruits of looting on a grand scale, we found these\r\ntrifles sordid evidences of greedy persecution.\r\n\r\nLamont and I spent the next two days in the Springerwerke. We worked\r\nnights as well. It was a molelike existence. On the third morning we\r\ntransferred our base of operations to the Kammergrafen, the largest of\r\nthe mine caverns and the most remote. It was three-quarters of a mile\r\nfrom the mine entrance. Whereas the other mine chambers were on one\r\nlevel, the great galleries of the Kammergrafen were on several. Beyond\r\nthose in which floors had been laid, there were vast unlighted caves of\r\nechoing blackness.\r\n\r\nThe galleries were so high that those on the first level could\r\naccommodate three tiers of pictures between floor and ceiling, while\r\nthose on the second had four tiers.\r\n\r\nThe records listed _six thousand pictures_. In addition there were\r\nquantities of sculpture, hundreds of examples of the very finest\r\neighteenth century French cabinetwork, tapestries and rugs, and the books\r\nand manuscripts of the Biblioteca Herziana in Rome—one of the greatest\r\nhistorical libraries in the world. Kammergrafen was quality and quantity\r\ncombined, for here had been stored the collections for Linz.\r\n\r\nAmong the pictures, for example, were canvases from the Rothschild,\r\nGutmann and Mannheimer collections, the celebrated tempera panels of the\r\nfourteenth century Hohenfurth altarpiece, Rembrandts and other great\r\nDutch masters from the stock of Goudstikker, who had been the Duveen of\r\nAmsterdam, a collection of French pictures known as the “Sammlung Berta,”\r\nand hundreds of nineteenth century German paintings, these last the\r\nobjects of Hitler’s special veneration.\r\n\r\nThe sculpture ranged from ancient to modern, with notable emphasis on\r\nexamples of the Gothic period. There were Egyptian tomb figures, Roman\r\nportrait busts, Renaissance and Baroque bronzes, exquisite French marbles\r\nof the eighteenth century and delicate Tanagra figurines. A bewildering\r\nhodgepodge of the plastic arts.\r\n\r\nThere were tapestries from Cracow, furniture from the Castle at Posen,\r\nrows of inlaid tables and cabinets from the Vienna Rothschilds, shelves\r\nand cases filled with the finest porcelains, prints and drawings of the\r\nsixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the decorations from\r\nthe Reichskanzlei in Berlin, and Hitler’s own purchases from the annual\r\nexhibitions of German art in Munich. Such was the Kammergrafen treasure.\r\nAnd the best of it, as I have said before, was to have adorned the\r\ngalleries of the unbuilt Führer Museum at Linz, the city by the Danube\r\nwhich Hitler aspired to raise to the dignity of Vienna.\r\n\r\nThe rarest treasure of that collection was the celebrated Vermeer\r\n_Portrait of the Artist in His Studio_. This superb work of the\r\nseventeenth Dutch master, by whom there are only some forty unquestioned\r\nexamples in the world, had been for years in the collection of Count\r\nCzernin at Vienna. The collection was semipublic; I had visited it before\r\nthe war. Known simply as the “Czernin Vermeer,” the picture had long been\r\ncoveted by the great collectors. It had remained for Hitler to succeed\r\nwhere others had failed: he acquired this masterpiece in 1940 for an\r\nalleged price of one million, four hundred thousand Reichsmarks—part\r\nof his earnings from the sale of _Mein Kampf_. He boasted at the time\r\nthat Mr. Mellon had offered six million dollars for it. Whether the\r\nsale was made under duress is still a matter of controversy. Members of\r\nthe Czernin family today contend that it was. The picture has now been\r\nreturned to Vienna where the matter will be ultimately decided.\r\n\r\nRivaling the Vermeer in international significance were the fifteen\r\ncases of paintings and sculpture from Monte Cassino. The paintings\r\nincluded Titian’s _Danaë_, Raphael’s _Madonna of the Divine Love_, Peter\r\nBreughel’s _Blind Leading the Blind_, a _Crucifixion_ by Van Dyck, an\r\n_Annunciation_ by Filippino Lippi, a _Sacra Conversazione_ by Palma\r\nVecchio, a _Landscape_ by Claude Lorraine, and Sebastiano del Piombo’s\r\n_Portrait of Pope Clement VII_. Among the sculpture were antique bronzes\r\nof the greatest rarity and importance from Herculaneum and Pompeii. All\r\nhad belonged to the Naples Museum. In 1943 the Italians had placed them,\r\ntogether with one hundred and seventy-two other cases of objects from\r\nthe Naples Museum, in the Abbey of Monte Cassino for safekeeping. The\r\nfollowing January, arrangements were made for all of the cases to be\r\nreturned to the Vatican. When they arrived, fifteen were missing. Members\r\nof the Hermann Göring Division had carried them off as a birthday gift\r\nfor the Reichsmarschall. Göring was incensed, when he learned of the\r\narrival of these treasures, and refused to accept them. There is reason\r\nto believe that such was his reaction, for he had striven to maintain\r\na semblance of legality in his art transactions. Even this rapacious\r\ncollector could not have interpreted the behavior of his loyal officers\r\nas “correct,” so far as the Monte Cassino affair was concerned. After the\r\nReichsmarschall’s refusal of the cases, they were brought to Alt Aussee\r\nfor storage, pending their later return to Italy.\r\n\r\nThe Springerwerke had been child’s play compared with the task\r\nconfronting us in the Kammergrafen. We began arbitrarily with the big\r\npictures. Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese, Van Dyck, Rubens, Rembrandt—all\r\nwere represented in profusion. Many of them were from private collections\r\nin Holland, Belgium and France, and were unknown to us save through\r\nreproduction. It was a great lesson in connoisseurship, particularly when\r\nwe had exhausted the “stars” and come to the lesser masters. The Dutch\r\nschool of the seventeenth century was abundantly represented. There were\r\nscores, hundreds, of still lifes and flower paintings. My predilection\r\nfor them amused Lamont and Sieber. I had always admired these incredibly\r\ndeft creations of the seventeenth century Dutch artists, and here was an\r\nunparalleled opportunity to study them.\r\n\r\nThere was one peculiar thing about our selections: if a picture looked\r\ngood to us down in the mine, it invariably looked better when we examined\r\nit later in the light of day at the mine entrance. This happened time\r\nand again. I remember one instance in particular. The painting was a\r\nlarge Rembrandt, a study of two dead peacocks. Down in the mine we had\r\nlooked at it without much enthusiasm, though we admired it, and had even\r\nhesitated to include it in that first selection, which was to number only\r\nthe best of the best. The next morning, as it was being loaded onto the\r\ntruck, we were struck by its distinction.\r\n\r\nAnd I remember the next time I saw that picture: it was at the\r\nRijksmuseum in Amsterdam. It was included in the small group of\r\noutstanding Dutch masterpieces returned to Holland by special plane as a\r\ngesture of token restitution in the name of General Eisenhower!\r\n\r\nLamont and I liked Sieber, the German restorer. Lamont referred to him as\r\nthe “tragic Gilles in white.” Not that there was anything particularly\r\ntragic about him, any more than there was about the plight in which most\r\nNazis found themselves. He made no bones about having joined the Party\r\nin the early thirties—ironically enough at the suggestion of one of his\r\nclients, a Jewish art dealer, who had thought it would be a good thing\r\nfor Sieber’s business. Sieber had been a restorer of pictures in Berlin\r\nand had done a little dealing on the side. It was the half-mournful\r\nexpression he perpetually wore, together with his white costume, that\r\naccounted for Lamont’s appellation. George had described him as a good,\r\nrun-of-the-mill restorer, perhaps a little better than average. He\r\nhad sized him up as a man ninety-eight per cent preoccupied with his\r\nprofession and possibly two per cent concerned with politics. And George,\r\nas I think I have observed before, was a good judge of men. Sieber was\r\na quiet, willing worker. He was neither fawning on the one hand, nor\r\narrogant on the other. When you asked him a question, you always got a\r\nconsidered answer.\r\n\r\nOne evening we drew Sieber out on the subject of the attempted\r\ndestruction of the mine. We had heard several versions of this fantastic\r\nplot and, according to one, Sieber had been instrumental in foiling\r\nthe conspirators. The story was as follows: On the tenth, thirteenth\r\nand thirtieth of April 1945, Glinz, the Gauinspektor of Ober-Donau,\r\nhad come to the mine with eight great cases marked in black letters\r\n“_Marmor—Nicht stürzen_,” that is, “Marble—Don’t drop.” He was acting on\r\nexplicit instructions from Eigruber, Gauleiter of the region, to place\r\nthem at strategic positions in the mine tunnels. Each case contained a\r\nhundred-pound bomb. Had these bombs been detonated, the entire contents\r\nof the mine would have been destroyed. The resulting cave-ins would have\r\nblocked every means of access. It would have taken months to repair the\r\napparatus which carried off the water seeping constantly into the mine\r\nchambers. By that time the treasures they contained would have been\r\ncompletely ruined. It is generally agreed that Eigruber had obtained\r\nHitler’s tacit consent to this artistic Götterdämmerung, if not his\r\nactual approval of it.\r\n\r\nI learned later that Captain Posey found a letter from Martin Bormann,\r\nHitler’s deputy, stating in the first paragraph that the contents of\r\nthe mine must, at all costs, be kept from falling into the hands of the\r\nenemy. And then the second paragraph stated that the contents of the mine\r\nmust not be harmed.\r\n\r\nMembers of the Austrian resistance movement got wind of this diabolical\r\nplan and took Sieber into their confidence. His intimate knowledge of\r\nthe mine passageways enabled him to set off small charges of dynamite\r\nhere and there along the tunnels without endangering the contents of the\r\nchambers beyond. The resulting damage was slight and served a twofold\r\npurpose: it gave the impression that the mine had been permanently\r\nwalled up; and, if that ruse were discovered, immediate access to the\r\nart works themselves was denied the plotters. Eigruber did discover\r\nthat his attempt had been thwarted and in his rage gave orders for the\r\ncounterconspirators to be rounded up and shot. But by that time it was\r\nthe seventh of May, so the tragedy was mercifully averted.\r\n\r\nSieber told the story in a straightforward, factual way. I don’t think\r\nit mattered to him who got control of the mine, but it was simply\r\nunthinkable that any harm should come to the precious things it housed.\r\nIt was very much to his credit that he never capitalized on the part he\r\nplayed in this affair. The only other reference he made to it was when he\r\nlater showed us the places where he had set off the charges of dynamite.\r\n\r\nDuring all the time we were at the mine, Sieber made only one request\r\nof us. It came at the very end of our stay and was reasonable enough:\r\nhe asked if we could expedite his return to Germany. There seemed to be\r\nlittle prospect of regular employment for him in Austria, but that was of\r\nless concern to him than the welfare of his wife and young daughter who\r\nlived with him in a house near the mine. Some months later, one of our\r\nofficers tried to get him a job in Wiesbaden, but he was not acceptable\r\nto the Military Government authorities there because of his political\r\naffiliations. The last I heard of him, he and his family were still at\r\nAlt Aussee, waiting for permission to go back to Germany. I hope they\r\nfinally got it.\r\n\r\nOur concentrated efforts underground produced the desired results.\r\nPictures were coming out of the mine at such a prodigious rate that\r\nGeorge called a halt. Enough of a backlog had been accumulated to make\r\nfurther selection down in the mine unnecessary for a couple of days.\r\nLamont and I had better help with the actual loading.\r\n\r\nLoading a truck was a specialized operation, and George had perfected the\r\ntechnique. Lamont, Steve and Shrady were his pupils. That left me the\r\nonly neophyte. So far I had had experience only with the loading of cases\r\nand heavier objects such as furniture and sculpture.\r\n\r\nPacking pictures, especially unframed ones—and there were a great many of\r\nthe latter at Alt Aussee—was an altogether different problem. The first\r\nstep was to place a length of waterproof paper over the side bars of the\r\ntruck and spread it smoothly on the floor to the center of the truck bed.\r\nFor this we had a large supply of stout, green, clothlike paper which\r\nhad been used by the Wehrmacht as protection against gas attacks. Then\r\na strip of felt was laid over the paper. The third step was to place\r\n“sausages” in two rows, end to end, on the floor of the truck. The space\r\nbetween the rows would depend on the size of the pictures to be loaded,\r\nfor they were intended to cushion the shock as the trucks rumbled along\r\nover bumpy roads. The “sausages” had been George’s invention. Packing\r\nmaterials of all kinds were at a premium, and certain types just didn’t\r\nexist. To make up for the lack of the usual packer’s pads, George had\r\nimprovised this substitute. In one of the mine chambers he had found a\r\nlarge supply of ordinary curtain material of machine-made ecru lace. This\r\nhad been cut up into yard lengths, eighteen inches wide. When rolled\r\naround a central core of coarser cloth, or sometimes excelsior, and tied\r\nwith string, they were a very satisfactory “ersatz” product. We used to\r\nrefer to them augustly as the pads made from Hitler’s window curtains.\r\nTheir manufacture was periodically one of the major industries at the\r\nmine. George had trained a crew of the gnomes and they loved to turn them\r\nout. It was easy work. Seated at long benches they resembled a kind of\r\nAlpine “husking bee.”\r\n\r\nOnce the paper, felt and “sausages” were in place, the pictures could\r\nbe brought to the truck. One after another they were placed in a stack\r\nleading from the sideboards of the truck to the center. Pads and small\r\nblankets were inserted between them to prevent rubbing. To ensure safe\r\npacking, all the pictures in a given row had to be carefully selected as\r\nto size, ranging from large to medium in one, and from medium to small\r\nin another. That was the most tedious part of the entire operation.\r\nAs soon as a row had been “built,” it required only a few minutes to\r\nbring first the felt and then the green paper over the top of the row,\r\ntuck both down along the sides, and then lash the whole stack firmly\r\nto the side of the truck. By this method it was possible to load as\r\nmany as a hundred and fifty medium-sized canvases on a single truck,\r\nfor three rows of twenty-five each could be built up on either side of\r\nour big two-and-a-half-ton trucks. A truck loaded in this way could\r\noften accommodate several pieces of sculpture as well. Carefully padded\r\nand swathed in blankets, these could be placed down the center. The\r\nfinal step was to adjust the tarpaulin over the bows and to close the\r\ntailboard. A truck of the size we used could normally be loaded in two\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nWe were at the mercy of the weather, as far as loading was concerned. On\r\nrainy days we could work on only one truck at a time, because there was\r\nbut one doorway with a protective stoop under which a single truck could\r\npark. Taking advantage of the sunny mornings, we would divide up into two\r\nteams—George and Steve on one truck, Lamont and I on another. As soon\r\nas a truck was filled and the tarpaulin securely fastened down, it was\r\ndriven to one side of the narrow terrace in front of the building. The\r\naverage convoy consisted of six trucks.\r\n\r\nWe had a crew of eighteen Negro drivers. Barboza, the C.O., was a very\r\nstarchy lieutenant, Jamaica born. He and his men were billeted down in\r\nthe little town of Bad Aussee. They were magnificent drivers but a bit\r\nreckless. Their occasional disregard for their vehicles was a worry to\r\nGeorge. It would have been so with any drivers, I guess. A breakdown on\r\nthe steep mountain roads could be a serious matter. It meant the complete\r\ndisruption of the convoy schedule, involving reloading en route. To\r\nprovide for this contingency, we made a practice of loading the trucks\r\nto three-quarters of their capacity. The contents of a single truck could\r\nthus be absorbed by the others.\r\n\r\nWhen a convoy was ready to start, either George or I would lead off in a\r\njeep and escort the six trucks down the precipitous road to Alt Aussee.\r\nTwo half-tracks from the 11th Armored Division, as front and rear guards,\r\nwould be waiting to accompany the convoy to Munich.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast one morning George said, “This looks like a good day to load\r\nthe gold-seal products.” He meant the Michelangelo Madonna and the Ghent\r\naltarpiece. This was an important event, for they were unquestionably the\r\ntwo most precious things still at the mine. Every possible precaution\r\nwould have to be taken to make this operation a success. It must go off\r\nwithout a hitch. If anything happened to either of these masterpieces,\r\nthe repercussions would be catastrophic. They would overshadow all the\r\naccomplishments of our MFA&A officers.\r\n\r\nFor the past several days, George and Steve had been working on the\r\nMadonna. She was now heavily padded and trussed up like a ham, ready to\r\nbe brought out of the mine. We all went down to the Kaiser Josef chamber\r\nwhere we had first seen her. George made a final inspection of the ropes\r\nand pulleys which had been set up to hoist her onto the waiting train.\r\nThen, with a satisfied smile, he said, “I think we could bounce her from\r\nAlp to Alp, all the way to Munich, without doing her any harm.”\r\n\r\nOnce the statue was gently loaded on the little flat car, the train\r\npulled slowly out of the mine chamber and switched back onto the track of\r\nthe main tunnel. From there it chugged slowly—George walking alongside—to\r\nthe mine entrance where the truck stood waiting. This truck and the one\r\nwhich was to carry the altarpiece had been put in perfect condition.\r\nAnd George had put the fear of God into the two drivers, both of whom he\r\nhad personally chosen from our crew. A dozen of the gnomes were waiting\r\nto lift the marble onto the truck. We slid it cautiously to the fore\r\npart where boards had been laid parallel and nailed to the floor. These\r\nwould prevent shifting. On either side of the statue, small packing cases\r\nabout two feet square were arranged in even rows and lashed firmly to the\r\nsides of the truck. These cases had been stored in a chamber of the mine\r\ncalled the Kapelle. They contained the coin collection intended for the\r\nLinz Museum and were accordingly marked “Münz Kabinett” or Coin Room.\r\nBlankets were wedged in between the cases and the statue. The large case\r\ncontaining the Greek sarcophagus from Salonika was set in place behind\r\nthe statue and similarly secured to the floor and at the sides. That\r\ndone, the truck was ready to go.\r\n\r\nAs George was putting the finishing touches on the packing, he said,\r\n“Tom, will you go down and get the ‘Lamb’?” To be entrusted with the\r\nremoval of the great altarpiece was an exciting assignment. I wanted\r\nto share it with someone who would also get a kick out of telling his\r\ngrandchildren that he had actually brought the famous panels out of their\r\nunderground hiding place. I called Lamont, and the two of us, followed by\r\neight of the gnomes, hitched four of the “dogs” to the little engine and\r\nproceeded to the Mineral Kabinett. One of the “dogs,” especially designed\r\nto carry pictures of unusual height, had a lower bed than the others. We\r\nwould use this one for the big central panel of the altarpiece. Otherwise\r\nit would not clear a portion of the mine tunnel where the jagged rocks\r\nhung low over the track.\r\n\r\nThe panels were now in their cases, and it was a relatively simple\r\nmatter to carry them from the storage room to the train. We had to make\r\ntwo trips down and back in order to get all ten cases up to the mine\r\nentrance. They were much lighter than the statue, but the loading was a\r\nmore exacting undertaking. Lashing them upright in parallel rows, in the\r\ntruck, and stowing cases on either side for ballast, took time. We didn’t\r\nfinish until well after six. It had taken most of the day to load the\r\n“gold-seal products.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mary Magdalene_ by Cranach. Göring was especially fond of\r\nCranach’s work and owned many paintings by him.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine_ by David was one\r\nof the finest in the Göring Collection.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Diana_, an exquisite Boucher acquired by Göring from the\r\nRothschild Collection, has been returned to France.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Atalanta and Meleager_ by Rubens, found in the Göring\r\nCollection, was from the Goudstikker Collection of Amsterdam.]\r\n\r\nThat night we held a conference in George’s room. He was to go to Munich\r\nthe next morning with the convoy to supervise the unloading of the\r\nMadonna and the “Lamb” at the depot. He expected to come back directly,\r\nbut might have to go on up to Frankfurt. He mapped out the work he\r\nwanted us to do while he was away. In addition to the job at the mine,\r\nthere was a special one down at Bad Ischl. A series of famous panels by\r\nAlbrecht Altdorfer, one of the greatest German painters of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, was stored on the second floor of a highly combustible old inn.\r\nThese panels were among his finest works and belonged to the monastery\r\nof St. Florian outside Linz. Fifty or sixty pieces of sculpture—mostly\r\npolychromed wood figures, fifteenth century Gothic—also the property of\r\nthe monastery, were stored there too. George thought we’d better figure\r\non two trucks. We were to pick up the stuff, bring it back to the mine\r\nand then send it to Munich with the next convoy.\r\n\r\nWe made notations of what he had told us, and then Steve produced\r\ndrinks—something of an occasion, for liquor was hard to come by at the\r\nmine. Somehow he had got hold of a bottle of cognac and insisted on\r\nmaking “Alpine Specials.” This was a drink consisting of a jigger of\r\ncognac and an equal amount of a pink syrupy liquid resembling grenadine.\r\nSteve prized the syrup. Eder, the chemical engineer at the mine, had\r\nconcocted it especially for him. The mixture made a drink of dubious\r\nmerit. We drank to the success of George’s trip to Munich.\r\n\r\nThe convoy got off early the next morning. Lamont and I went down with\r\nGeorge as far as the village. Two half-tracks were waiting to escort the\r\ntrucks to Munich. They were equipped with radios for intercommunication,\r\nin case of delays along the way. Between Alt Aussee and Salzburg, the\r\nroad led through isolated country. Conditions were as yet far from\r\nsettled. Small bands of SS troops still lurked in the mountains. The\r\nhalf-tracks weren’t just going along for the ride.\r\n\r\nWhen we returned to the mine, we found Steve and Shrady in conversation.\r\nThey were planning an excursion and asked us to join them. We expressed\r\npious disapproval of letting up on the job the minute George’s back was\r\nturned. Steve’s answer was, “That’s a crock. I haven’t taken a day off in\r\ntwo weeks. You can do as you like, me lads; I’m off to see the wizard.”\r\nThe two of them climbed into the sporty Mercedes-Benz convertible which\r\nShrady had recently acquired, and drove off down the mountain.\r\n\r\n“I have an idea,” said Lamont. “They can have their fun today. We’ll have\r\nours tomorrow, while they pick up the Altdorfer panels at Bad Ischl.”\r\n\r\nLamont turned to the loading of trucks, while I went down to the\r\nKammergrafen with Sieber. In the course of the morning I selected\r\napproximately two hundred pictures. We concentrated on those of small\r\nsize, which were stored on the top racks, and the work went rapidly.\r\nAmong the paintings we chose was one which had a typewritten label on\r\nthe back. I read the words “Von dem Führer noch nicht entschieden”—not\r\nyet decided upon by the Führer. I asked Sieber what this signified.\r\nHe explained that every picture intended for the Linz Museum—and this\r\nwas one of them—had to be personally approved by Hitler before it\r\ncould be officially included in the prospective collection. I could\r\neasily understand that the Führer would have wanted to examine the more\r\nimportant acquisitions, but that each canvas had to receive his personal\r\napproval struck me as preposterous. Hitler had entrusted the formation\r\nof his collections first to Dr. Hans Posse, a noted scholar, and, after\r\nhis death, to Dr. Hermann Voss, director of the Dresden Gallery. This\r\nmeticulous procedure, involving the submission of all pictures to the\r\nFührer in Munich, must have been trying to those two luminaries of the\r\nGerman art world.\r\n\r\nWhen I came up from the mine for lunch I found that Lamont had completed\r\nthe loading of two trucks. As the stock of pictures in the packing\r\nroom at the mine entrance was almost exhausted, he said that he would\r\njoin Sieber and me in making further selections. We returned to the\r\nKammergrafen and continued with the smaller pictures.\r\n\r\nOn one of the top shelves we found a cardboard carton bearing the name of\r\nDr. Helmut von Hümmel, who had been connected with the formation of the\r\nLinz collections. The label indicated that the contents had been destined\r\nfor the museum. On the carton appeared the word “_Sittenbilder_.”\r\nLamont and I knew the word “_Bilder_” meant pictures, but the other two\r\nsyllables conveyed nothing. Sieber knew very little English but tried to\r\nexplain. He thought perhaps the word meant “customs,” or something like\r\nthat. I thought that I understood him. He probably meant that they were\r\nlittle scenes from everyday life.\r\n\r\nWe opened the carton. On top were three small watercolors, with beautiful\r\ngray-blue mounts and carved, gilt frames. If they were not by François\r\nBoucher, they were by a close pupil. The workmanship was exquisite and\r\nthey were highly pornographic. So these were “_Sittenbilder_.” In our\r\nlimited German we tried to tell Sieber that they might be called “scenes\r\nfrom life,” but hardly everyday life.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the things in the carton were of the same order, some of them\r\ncontemporary, all of them licentious. None approached the first three\r\nwatercolors in sheer virtuosity of technique. We wondered just which\r\ndepartment of the Linz Museum would have harbored them.\r\n\r\nLater we showed them to Steve. When he looked at the three watercolors he\r\nasked, “Who did those?”\r\n\r\n“They look very much like Boucher,” I said without thinking.\r\n\r\n“Boucher?” asked Steve incredulously. “Not the fellow who painted that\r\n‘Holy Family’ I saw this afternoon?”\r\n\r\nLamont said quickly, “Tom means a pupil of Boucher, not Boucher himself.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s more like it,” said Steve. “I didn’t see how an artist who\r\npainted anything so beautiful as that big picture could paint smutty\r\nthings like these.”\r\n\r\nThe Holy Family to which he referred was a sensitive and tender\r\nrepresentation. Steve’s point was well taken. The fact that he had not\r\nseen much eighteenth century French painting didn’t alter the validity of\r\nhis argument.\r\n\r\nOn our way up from the Kammergrafen that afternoon we stopped at the\r\nKapelle. This was one of the mine chambers which I had visited only long\r\nenough to take out some of the cases used in packing the Bruges Madonna.\r\nIn addition to the Münz Kabinett collections, the Kapelle contained the\r\nmagnificent collection of Spanish armor—casques, breastplates, full\r\nsuits of armor, and a great number of firearms—which had been gathered\r\ntogether at Schloss Konopischt by the late Archduke Franz Ferdinand.\r\nMost of it was of sixteenth century workmanship, exquisitely inlaid with\r\ngold and silver. Formerly Austrian, it had been the property of the\r\nCzech government since the last World War. Nonetheless, the Germans had\r\ncarried it off, using some flimsy nationalistic argument to justify their\r\naction. While the atmosphere of the mine was excellent for paintings, it\r\nwas not satisfactory for metal objects. Consequently, every piece in the\r\nKonopischt collection had been heavily coated with grease to keep it from\r\noxidizing.\r\n\r\nTheir storage room, the Kapelle, was—as the name indicates—a chapel,\r\ndedicated to the memory of Dollfuss, the Austrian Chancellor. It had an\r\nelectrically illuminated altar, hewn from a block of translucent salt\r\ncrystal, which was one of the sights of the mine.\r\n\r\nThat night when Steve and Shrady returned from their outing we all had\r\nhot chocolate and cheese and crackers in the comfortable kitchen on the\r\nground floor of the main building. They had had a wonderful day. Maria,\r\nShrady’s interpreter-secretary, had been with them. They had gone first\r\nto St. Wolfgang. There a sentry had tried to prevent them from driving\r\nup the road leading to the little church. Leopold, the Belgian king, was\r\nliving near there with his wife, and motorists were not allowed on that\r\nroad. But they had got around the sentry and gone into the church to see\r\nthe wonderful carved altarpiece by Michael Pacher. Steve had brought us\r\nsome colored photographs of it. Afterward they had had a swim in the lake\r\nand a picnic lunch. And in the afternoon—this had been the high spot of\r\nthe day—they had gone over to Bad Ischl and called on Franz Léhar. The\r\nold fellow had been delighted to see them, had played the _Merry Widow_\r\nwaltz for them and given them autographed photographs. It sounded like\r\nfun. Our day at the mine had been very prosaic in comparison. Mention of\r\nBad Ischl reminded Lamont of his scheme for the next day. He proposed to\r\nSteve and Shrady that they should call for the Altdorfer panels. They\r\nfell in with the suggestion at once, and before we could explain that we\r\nthought we’d take the day off, Steve was telling us about some of the\r\nthings we should see in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nWe slept late and when we got up the sky was gray and threatening. It\r\nwas no day for an outing. In fact it was so cold that we decided we’d be\r\nwarmer down in the mine. There was still one series of chambers which\r\nwe had not explored. This was the Mondsberg, and it took us almost\r\nthree-quarters of an hour to reach it. The pictures were arranged on\r\nracks as in the Kammergrafen and the Springerwerke, only in the Mondsberg\r\nthere were a great many contemporary paintings. It didn’t take us long to\r\nrun through them. They were all obviously German-owned and, judging from\r\nthe labels, the great majority of the canvases had been included in the\r\nannual exhibitions at the Haus der Deutschen Kunst in Munich.\r\n\r\nRanged along one side of the main chamber was a row of old pictures.\r\nThese were of high quality, and we went through them carefully. I came to\r\na canvas which looked vaguely familiar. It was the portrait of a young\r\nwoman dressed in a gown of cherry brocade. I guessed it to be sixteenth\r\ncentury Venetian, perhaps by Paris Bordone. I said to Lamont, “I’m sure\r\nI’ve seen that picture somewhere, but I can’t place it.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s see if there’s any mark on the back that might give you a lead,”\r\nsaid Lamont.\r\n\r\nHe found a label and started reading aloud, “California Palace of the\r\nLegion of Honor, San Francisco....”\r\n\r\nI thought he was joking. But not at all. There was the printed label\r\nof my museum. And there too _in my own handwriting_ appeared the words\r\n“Portrait of a Young Woman, by Paris Bordone”! No wonder the portrait\r\nhad looked familiar. I had borrowed it from a New York art dealer for a\r\nspecial loan exhibition of Venetian painting in the summer of 1938. I\r\nlearned from the mine records that the dealer had subsequently sold the\r\npicture to a Jewish private collector in Paris. The Nazis had confiscated\r\nit with the rest of his collection. It was a weird business finding it\r\nseven years later in an Austrian salt mine.\r\n\r\nAfter supper that evening Shrady asked us to go down to Alt Aussee with\r\nhim. Some Viennese friends of his were having an evening of music.\r\nThe weather had cleared and the snow on the mountains was pink in the\r\nafterglow as we drove down the winding road from the mine. The house, a\r\nsmall chalet, stood on the outskirts of the village. Our host, his wife\r\nand their two daughters, had taken refuge there just before the Russians\r\nreached Vienna.\r\n\r\nHe introduced us to Dr. Victor Luithlen, one of the curators of the\r\nVienna Museum, who had driven over from Laufen. Many of the finest things\r\nfrom the museum were stored in the salt mine there. Dr. Luithlen was the\r\ncustodian.\r\n\r\nBoth he and Shrady played the piano well. Luithlen played some Brahms\r\nand Shrady followed with the music he had composed for a ballet based\r\non Poe’s “Raven.” Shrady said that it had been produced by the Russian\r\nBallet in New York. It was a very flamboyant piece and Shrady performed\r\nit with terrific virtuosity.\r\n\r\nAfterward coffee and strudel were served. The atmosphere of the household\r\nwas casual and friendly. I was reminded of what an Austrian friend of\r\nmine had once told me: “In other countries, conditions are often serious,\r\nbut not desperate; in Austria they are often desperate but never serious.”\r\n\r\nThinking that George Stout might have returned from Munich, Lamont and\r\nI went back up to the mine that night before the others. George had\r\njust come in. He brought exciting but disturbing news. We were to\r\ncontinue the work at Alt Aussee for another ten days. Then we were to\r\ntransfer our base of operations to Berchtesgaden. Our job there would\r\nbe the evacuation of the Göring collection! On our way through Salzburg\r\nwe were to pick up the pictures and tapestries from the Vienna Museum.\r\nThese were the paintings by Velásquez, Titian and Breughel which had\r\nbeen highjacked by the Nazis two months ago and later retrieved by our\r\nofficers. The disturbing part of what George had to tell was that he was\r\ngoing to leave us to carry on alone at the mine. He would try to join us\r\nat Berchtesgaden. But there was a possibility that he might not be able\r\nto make it.\r\n\r\nMonths ago George had put in a request for transfer to the Pacific.\r\nHe felt that things were shaping up on the European scene and that\r\nothers could carry on the work. There would be a big job protecting and\r\nsalvaging works of art in Japan. He didn’t think that a program had\r\nbeen planned. He had offered his services. He had already told us that\r\nhe had asked for this assignment, but we had never considered it as a\r\npossibility of the present or even of the immediate future. Now it looked\r\nas though it might materialize at once. In any case he was going up to\r\nFrankfurt the day after tomorrow to find out.\r\n\r\n“As senior officer, Tom,” George said, “you will take over as headman\r\nof the team. I’ll take you down to see Colonel Davitt before I go. He\r\nis responsible for the security guard here at the mine and has been\r\nextremely co-operative. You should go to him if you have any complaints\r\nabout the arrangements after I am gone.”\r\n\r\nBack in our rooms that night Lamont said, “I have a hunch that this is\r\nthe last we’ll see of George. It’s not like him to talk the way he did\r\ntonight if he hasn’t a pretty good idea that he won’t be coming back.”\r\n\r\nTogether we mapped out a tentative division of the work ahead. Steve,\r\nwho had come into the room in time to hear George’s news, joined our\r\ndiscussion. It was after midnight when the first meeting of the “three\r\npowers” broke up.\r\n\r\nWhile George was in Munich he had been informed of the imminent\r\nwithdrawal of Third Army from the part of Austria in which we were\r\nworking. No one could, or would, tell him the exact date, but it appeared\r\nlikely that it would take place within two weeks. It was difficult for\r\nme to understand why the arrival of another American army—General Mark\r\nClark’s Fifth from Italy—should cause the cessation of our operations.\r\nBut of course the Army had its own way of doing things. We were attached\r\nto Third Army and if they were getting out, we would have to get out with\r\nthem. All along we had known that this might happen before we could empty\r\nthe mine. It was quite probable that Fifth Army would want to resume the\r\nwork, but it would take time. Such a delay would impede the processes\r\nof restitution, and we had therefore been giving first attention to the\r\nfinest things.\r\n\r\nHaving taken stock of the paintings, sculpture and furniture on which we\r\nwere going to concentrate in the time we had left, we spent George’s last\r\nday working as usual. The loading went well and we finished four more\r\ntrucks. Another convoy would be ready to take off in the morning.\r\n\r\nGeorge had his own jeep and driver and could make better time than\r\nthe convoy, so after early breakfast we went down to Colonel Davitt’s\r\noffice. George explained the change in his own plans and said that I\r\nwould be taking over at the mine. Then he thanked the colonel for his\r\nco-operation. It was a long speech for George.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished, Colonel Davitt said, “In all the time you’ve been\r\nhere, you haven’t made a single unreasonable demand. If Lieutenant Howe\r\ncan come anywhere near that record, we’ll get along all right.”\r\n\r\nCompliments embarrassed George, so he said good-by as quickly as possible\r\nand climbed into his jeep. He wished me luck and drove off. I waited\r\nfor Lamont to come down with the convoy and give me a lift back up the\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(7)\r\n\r\n_THE ROTHSCHILD JEWELS; THE GÖRING COLLECTION_\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had our share of troubles during those last ten days at Alt Aussee.\r\nThey began that first day of my investiture as head of the team. Lamont\r\nand I were sorting pictures in the room at the mine entrance. It was\r\nearly in the afternoon and we were about to start loading our third\r\ntruck. I had just said to Lamont that I thought the morning’s convoy had\r\nprobably passed Salzburg, when a jeep pulled up to the door. The driver\r\ncalled out to us that one of our trucks had broken down at Goisern. That\r\nwas an hour’s drive from the mine. Why hadn’t we been notified earlier? I\r\nasked. He didn’t know. Perhaps there hadn’t been anybody around to bring\r\nback word. Maybe the driver had thought he could repair the truck.\r\n\r\nWe got hold of Steve and the three of us started for Goisern in the\r\nmessenger’s jeep. We’d have to transfer the load, so an empty truck\r\nfollowed us. We were thankful that the breakdown hadn’t happened while\r\nthe convoy was going over the Pötschen Pass. It would have been a tough\r\njob to shift the pictures from one truck to another on that steep and\r\ndangerous part of the road. It was bad enough as it was, because it\r\nlooked as though we’d have rain. One of the trucks had a lot of very\r\nlarge pictures. We hoped that it wasn’t the one that had broken down.\r\n\r\nIt was a little after three when we reached Goisern. The truck had been\r\nparked by the headquarters of a small detachment of troops on the edge\r\nof town. There were several houses near by but plenty of room for us to\r\nmaneuver the empty truck alongside. The Negro driver of the stranded\r\ntruck said that it had “thrown a rod” and would have to be taken to\r\nOrdnance for repairs. That meant that the vehicle would be laid up for\r\ntwo or three weeks. We’d have to see about a replacement. The main thing\r\nwas to get on with the unloading before it began to rain. And it _was_\r\nthe truck with the big pictures.\r\n\r\nWith the two trucks lined up alongside, and only a few inches apart, we\r\ncould hoist the pictures over the sideboards. In this way each row of\r\npaintings was kept in the same order. Lamont and Steve boarded the empty\r\ntruck, while one of the gnomes from the mine and I started unlashing the\r\nfirst stack of loaded pictures. Before long a crowd of women and children\r\nhad collected to watch this unusual operation. There were excited “oh’s”\r\nand “ah’s” as we began to transfer one masterpiece after another—two\r\nlarge Van Dycks, a Veronese, a pair of colossal decorative canvases\r\nby Hubert Robert, a Rubens, and so on. The spectators were quiet and\r\nwell behaved, whispering among themselves. They didn’t pester us with\r\nquestions. We rather enjoyed having an audience. We finished the job in\r\nan hour and a half.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t too soon, for as we were securing the tarpaulin at the rear of\r\nthe newly loaded truck, it began to pour. We parked the truck, arranged\r\nfor an overnight guard, then climbed into our jeep and started back to\r\nthe mine. In a few minutes the rain turned to hail. The stones were so\r\nlarge that we were afraid they’d break the windshield of the jeep. We\r\npulled over to the side of the road and waited for the storm to let up.\r\nWhile we waited, the gnome told us that sometimes the hailstones were\r\nlarge enough to kill sheep grazing in the high meadows. Only the summer\r\nbefore he had lost two of his own lambs during one of the heavy summer\r\nstorms. He swore that the stones were the size of tennis balls.\r\n\r\nWe were thoroughly soaked and half frozen when we got back to the mine.\r\nBut we had won our race with the weather, and the truck would proceed to\r\nMunich with the next convoy.\r\n\r\nDuring the next three days we were beset by a series of minor\r\ndifficulties. Two of the trucks broke down on the way up to the mine to\r\nbe loaded. It took half a day to get replacements, so the convoy was\r\ndelayed. One night the guard on duty at the mine entrance developed an\r\nunwarranted interest in art and poked around among the pictures which\r\nLamont and I had carefully stacked according to size for loading the next\r\nmorning. No harm was done, but it caused a delay. He was under strict\r\norders to let no one into the temporary storage room and was not to go\r\nin there himself. It was partly our fault; we shouldn’t have trusted\r\nhim with the key. The captain of the guard was notified and appropriate\r\ndisciplinary action taken. The gnomes developed a tendency to prolong\r\ntheir regular rest periods beyond a point Steve considered reasonable,\r\nand we had to come to an understanding about that. On the whole, however,\r\nthe work went fairly well.\r\n\r\nEven the great chambers of the Kammergrafen were beginning to thin out.\r\nThey were far from empty, but we had cleared them of a substantial part\r\nof the external loot, that is, the loot which had come from countries\r\noutside Germany. There were still quantities of things taken from\r\nAustrian collections, but they had not been our primary concern. The time\r\nhad come to make a final check, to make sure that we had not overlooked\r\nanything important in the category of external loot.\r\n\r\nTogether with Sieber, we started this last inspection. We checked off the\r\npictures first. Our work there had been pretty thorough. After that the\r\nsculpture. This also seemed to be well weeded out. And the furniture too.\r\n\r\nSieber was ahead of us with his flashlight. The light fell on two cartons\r\nstanding in a dark corner behind a group of Renaissance bronzes. I\r\nasked what was in them. Sieber shrugged his shoulders. They had never\r\nbeen opened. He had forgotten that they were there. We dragged them out\r\nand looked for an identifying label. Sieber recalled that one of the\r\nformer custodians at the mine had said the things inside were “_sehr\r\nwertvoll_”—very valuable, but he knew nothing more.\r\n\r\nWe carried the boxes to a table where there was better light. They were\r\nthe same size, square, and about two feet high. They were not heavy. We\r\npried open the lid of one of them with great care. It might be Roman\r\nglass, and that stuff breaks almost when you look at it. But it wasn’t\r\nRoman glass. Inside was a row of small cardboard boxes. I lifted the lid\r\nand removed a layer of cotton. On the cotton beneath lay a magnificent\r\ngolden pendant studded with rubies, emeralds and pearls. The central\r\nmotif, a mermaid exquisitely modeled and wrought in iridescent enamel,\r\nproclaimed the piece the work of an Italian goldsmith of the Renaissance.\r\nThe surrounding framework of intricate scrolls, shells and columns blazed\r\nwith jewels.\r\n\r\nThere were forty boxes filled with jewels—necklaces, pendants and\r\nbrooches—all of equal splendor. The collection was worth a fortune. Each\r\npiece bore a minute tag on which appeared an identifying letter and a\r\nnumber. These were Rothschild jewels. And we had stumbled on them quite\r\nby accident.\r\n\r\nLamont and I agreed that they should be taken to Munich without delay.\r\nThere they could be stored in a vault. Furthermore we decided to deliver\r\nthem ourselves. It wouldn’t do to risk such precious objects with the\r\nregular convoy. We admonished Sieber to say nothing about our find. In\r\nthe meantime we would keep the two boxes under lock and key in our room.\r\n\r\nThat night we told Steve we had a special surprise for him. After barring\r\nthe door against unexpected visitors, we emptied the boxes onto one\r\nof the beds. We told him not to look until we were ready. We arranged\r\neach piece with the greatest care, straightening out the links of the\r\nnecklaces, adjusting the great baroque pearls of the pendants, balancing\r\none piece with another, until the whole glittering collection was spread\r\nout on the white counterpane. Then we signaled to Steve to turn around.\r\n\r\n“God Almighty, where did you find those?” he asked.\r\n\r\nWhile we were telling him how we had happened onto the two cartons that\r\nafternoon, he kept shaking his head, and when we had finished, said\r\nsolemnly, “They’re beyond my apprehension.” The expression stuck and from\r\nthat time on we invoked it whenever we were confronted with an unexpected\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nEarly the following morning we stowed the jewels in the back seat of our\r\ncommand car and set out for Munich. Halfway to Salzburg we encountered\r\nCaptain Posey, headed in the opposite direction. He was surprised to\r\nsee us, and still more surprised when we told him what we had in the\r\ncar. He was on his way to the mine. There were some things he wanted to\r\ntell us about our next job—at Berchtesgaden—but if we would come to his\r\noffice the next day that would be time enough. He wasn’t going to stay\r\nat the mine more than a couple of hours. He should be back in Munich\r\nbefore midnight. He said there was one thing we could do when we reached\r\nSalzburg—call on the Property Control Officer and arrange for clearance\r\non the removal of the Vienna Museum pictures to the Munich depot. This\r\nwas an important part of the plan which George had outlined, so we said\r\nthat we’d see what we could do.\r\n\r\nWe had some difficulty finding the right office. There were two Military\r\nGovernment Detachments in Salzburg—one for the city, and the other\r\nfor the region. They were on opposite sides of the river. We caught\r\nLieutenant Colonel Homer K. Heller, the Property Control Officer, as\r\nhe was leaving for lunch. I explained that it was our intention to\r\ncall for the paintings and tapestries on our way to Berchtesgaden the\r\nfollowing week. He said he could not authorize the removal; that we would\r\nhave to see Colonel W. B. Featherstone at the headquarters across the\r\nriver. If the colonel gave his O.K., it would be all right with him. He\r\ndidn’t think that the colonel would take kindly to the idea. This was a\r\nsurprise. Who would have the temerity to question the authority of Third\r\nArmy? Lamont was amused. He told me I could have the pleasure of tackling\r\nColonel Featherstone alone.\r\n\r\nIt was after two o’clock before the colonel was free. Nothing doing on\r\nthe Vienna pictures. That would require an O.K. from Verona. Why Verona,\r\nI asked? “General Clark’s headquarters,” was the answer. Didn’t I know\r\nthat the Fifth Army was taking over the area very shortly? Then the\r\ncolonel, in accents tinged with sarcasm, expressed his satisfaction at\r\nfinally meeting one of the Monuments officers of the Third Army. He had\r\nheard such a lot about them and the wide territory they had covered. He\r\nhad been told that a group of them was working at the Alt Aussee mine,\r\nbut I was the first one he had laid eyes on.\r\n\r\nI gathered that he was mildly nettled by Third Army in general and by\r\nme in particular. As a matter of fact, the colonel’s attitude about\r\nthe Vienna pictures was logical: why move them out of Austria? If, as\r\nhe supposed, they were to be returned to Vienna eventually, why take\r\nthem all the way to Munich? I had no answer to that and took refuge in\r\nthe old “I only work here” excuse. He found it rather droll that the\r\nNavy should be mixed up in this high-class van and storage business. I\r\nhad too, once, but the novelty had worn off. I rejoined Lamont and the\r\njewels. I wondered what Captain Posey would have to say to all this.\r\n\r\nWe reached Munich too late that afternoon to see Craig at the depot, so\r\nwe took the jewels with us to his quarters. I had not seen him since my\r\ndeparture for Alt Aussee some weeks before. In the interim, there had\r\nbeen a tightening up on billeting facilities. As a result he and Ham\r\nCoulter were now sharing a single apartment. I was the only one adversely\r\naffected by this arrangement. Craig no longer had a spare couch for\r\nchance guests.\r\n\r\nWhen Lamont and I walked in, we found them talking with a newly arrived\r\nnaval lieutenant. He was Lane Faison, who had been around Harvard in\r\nmy day. In recent years he had been teaching at Williams and was at\r\npresent in OSS. After we had been there a little while, Lamont asked very\r\ncasually, “Would you boys care to see the Rothschild jewels?”\r\n\r\nHam wanted to know what the hell he was talking about. “Well, we have two\r\nboxes filled with them here in the hall,” Lamont said.\r\n\r\nFor the second time we displayed the treasures. Craig’s enthusiasm was\r\ntempered with concern for their safety. He was relieved when we said we\r\nhad come purposely to put them in one of the steel vaults at the depot.\r\nWe went with him to the Königsplatz forthwith and stowed them safely for\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nLamont and I continued on our way to Third Army Headquarters. Lincoln was\r\nworking late. When we walked in he looked up from his typewriter and said\r\n“Hello” in a flat voice. Lincoln was in one of his uncommunicative moods.\r\nWe left him alone and busied ourselves with letters from home which\r\nwe found on Posey’s desk. Lincoln went on with his typing. Presently\r\nhe stopped and said, “George’s orders came through. He’s gone to the\r\nPacific.”\r\n\r\n“It ought to be interesting work,” said Lamont.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you knew about his orders?” asked Lincoln.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Lamont.\r\n\r\nThat broke the mood. We had a lively session for the next hour. Lincoln\r\nwas always a reservoir of information, a lot of it in the realm of rumor,\r\nbut all of it fascinating. That evening he was unusually full of news. He\r\nhad a perfect audience in Lamont and me because we had been completely\r\nout of touch with things while at the mine.\r\n\r\nAfter exhausting his stock of fact and fiction, he produced his latest\r\nbox of food from home. There were brandied peaches, tins of lobster and\r\ncaviar, several kinds of cheese, dried fruits and crackers. It was a\r\ncombination you’d never risk at home, if you were in your right mind.\r\n\r\n“You do very well for yourself,” I said when he had the refreshments\r\nspread out on his desk.\r\n\r\n“My wife knows the enlisted men’s motto: ‘Nothing is too good for our\r\nboys, and nothing is what they get.’”\r\n\r\nWe finished the box and Lincoln showed us an article he had written on\r\nNazi sculpture. We were reading it when Captain Posey came in. He asked\r\nif we had stopped in Salzburg to see Colonel Heller. I told him what had\r\nhappened there. If he was annoyed, he gave no sign of it. He rummaged\r\nin his desk and brought out a list of instructions for us in connection\r\nwith the operation at Berchtesgaden. He suggested that we stop there on\r\nthe way back to Alt Aussee; it wouldn’t be very much out of our way. He\r\ngave us the names of the officers we should see about billeting, and\r\nso on. It would be well to have all these things settled in advance.\r\nThen he gave us some special orders for Lieutenant Shrady, who was to be\r\ntransferred to Heidelberg, now that the evacuation of the mine was ending.\r\n\r\nCaptain Posey said that I was to take over the Mercedes-Benz. It had been\r\nobtained originally for the evacuation team. We were to take it with\r\nus to Berchtesgaden. I could make good use of the car, transportation\r\nfacilities being what they were, but I didn’t relish the prospect of\r\ntaking it from Shrady. He had spent money of his own fixing it up and\r\nlooked on it as his personal property. I told Captain Posey how I felt.\r\nHe said he had a letter for me which would take care of the matter. It\r\nwas a letter directing me to deliver Lieutenant Shrady’s orders and to\r\nappropriate the car.\r\n\r\nWhen we saw Faison at the depot the next morning, he asked if he might\r\ndrive back with us. He was joining Plaut and Rousseau at House 71 to\r\nwork with them on the investigation of Nazi art looting. I said we’d be\r\nglad to have him. The three of us started off after early lunch. We were\r\nlooking forward to the Berchtesgaden detour. None of us had been there\r\nduring the Nazi regime and I, for one, was curious to see what changes\r\nhad taken place in the picturesque resort town since I had last seen it\r\nfifteen years before.\r\n\r\nWe took the Salzburg Autobahn past Chiemsee almost to Traunstein, and\r\nthen turned off to the southwest. This was the finest secondary road I\r\never traveled. It led into the mountains and the scenery was worthy of\r\nSwitzerland. Thanks to perfectly banked turns, we made the ninety-mile\r\nrun in two hours.\r\n\r\nThe little town was as peaceful and quiet as I remembered it. In fact it\r\nwas so quiet that Lamont and I had difficulty locating an Army outfit to\r\ngive us directions. We learned that the 44th AAA Brigade had just moved\r\nin and that the last remnants of the famous 101st Airborne Division were\r\npulling out. There was no love lost between the two, as we found out\r\nlater. Consequently, when I asked an officer of the AAA Brigade where I\r\nwould find Major Anderson of the 101st Airborne, he informed me curtly\r\nthat that outfit was no longer at Berchtesgaden. Then I asked if he\r\nknew where the Göring collection was. He didn’t seem to know what I was\r\ntalking about, so I rephrased my question, inquiring about the captured\r\npictures which had been on exhibition a short time ago. Yes, he knew\r\nvaguely that there had been some kind of a show. He thought it had been\r\nover in Unterstein, not in Berchtesgaden. Well, where was Unterstein?\r\nHe said it was about four kilometers to the south, on the road to the\r\nKönigssee.\r\n\r\nHis directions weren’t too explicit, but eventually we found the little\r\nback road which landed us in Unterstein ten minutes later. In a clearing\r\non the left side of the road stood the building we were looking for.\r\nIt was a low rambling structure of whitewashed stucco in the familiar\r\nBavarian farmhouse style. It had been a rest house for the Luftwaffe.\r\nThe center section, three stories high, had a gabled roof with widely\r\noverhanging eaves. On either side were long wings two stories high,\r\nsimilarly roofed. The casement windows were shuttered throughout.\r\n\r\nWe found Major Harry Anderson on the entrance steps. He was a husky\r\nfellow with red hair and a shy, boyish manner. He was not altogether\r\nsurprised to see us because George had stopped by on his last trip to\r\nMunich and told him we’d be arriving before long. How soon could we start\r\nto work on the collection? In four or five days’ time, we thought. Could\r\nhe make some preliminary arrangements for us? We would need billets for\r\nthree officers, that is, the two of us—and Lieutenant Kovalyak. No, there\r\nwould be four, we had forgotten to include the Negro lieutenant in\r\ncharge of the truck drivers. Then there would be twenty drivers. Could\r\nwe say definitely what day we’d arrive? Lamont and I made some rapid\r\ncalculations. It was a Tuesday. How about Friday evening? That was fine.\r\nThe sooner the better as far as the major was concerned. He was slated to\r\npull out the minute the job was done, so we couldn’t start too soon to\r\nsuit him.\r\n\r\nHe asked if we’d care to take a preliminary look around but we declined.\r\nIt was getting late and we still had a hard three-hour drive ahead of us.\r\nAs we turned to go, Jim Plaut and Ted Rousseau came out of the building.\r\nThey had been expecting Faison but were surprised to find him with us.\r\nWouldn’t we all have dinner with them that night at House 71? They had\r\ncome over from Bad Aussee that afternoon, bringing Hofer with them. They\r\nhad been quizzing him about certain pictures in the collection and he had\r\nwanted to refresh his memory by having a look at them. They pointed to\r\na stocky German dressed in gray tweeds who stood a little distance away\r\ntalking with a tall, angular woman. We recognized him as the man we had\r\nseen pacing the garden at House 71 weeks before—the evening Lamont and I\r\nfirst reported to George at the mine. That was his wife, they said. Would\r\nwe mind taking Hofer back with us? If we could manage that, they’d take\r\nFaison with them. There were some urgent matters they’d like to talk over\r\nwith him in connection with their work. We agreed and Ted brought Hofer\r\nto the car.\r\n\r\nAs we left he called out, “Wiederschauen, liebe Mutti,” and kept waving\r\nand throwing kisses to his tall wife. I was struck by the stoical\r\nexpression on her face. She watched us go but made no effort to return\r\nhis salutations. I wondered if she gave a damn.\r\n\r\nHofer was a loquacious passenger. All the way to Bad Aussee he kept up a\r\nline of incessant chatter, half in English, half in German, on all sorts\r\nof subjects. He gesticulated constantly with both hands, notwithstanding\r\nthe fact that one of them was heavily bandaged. He explained that he had\r\nscalded it. The bandage had been smeared with evil-smelling ointment\r\nwhich had soaked through. As he gestured the air was filled with a\r\ndisagreeable odor of medication. Did we know Salzburg? Ah, such a lovely\r\ncity, so musical! Did we know Stokowski? He knew him well. “Then you’ll\r\nprobably be interested to know that he has just married one of the\r\nVanderbilt heiresses, a girl of nineteen,” I said. But I must be joking.\r\nWas it really so?\r\n\r\nI was getting bored with this chatterbox when he suddenly began to talk\r\nabout Göring and his pictures. We asked him the obvious question: What\r\ndid Göring really like when it came to paintings? Well, he was fond of\r\nCranach. Yes, we knew that. And Rubens; he had greatly admired Rubens.\r\nAnd many of the Dutch masters of the seventeenth century. But according\r\nto Hofer it was he who had directed the Reichsmarschall’s taste. Then,\r\nto my surprise, he mentioned Vermeer. Did we know about the Vermeer\r\nwhich Göring had bought? After that he went into a lengthy account of\r\nthe purchase, leading up to it with an involved story of the secrecy\r\nsurrounding the transaction, which had many confusing details. When we\r\npulled up before House 71, Hofer was still going strong. Lamont and I\r\nwere worn out.\r\n\r\nShrady departed the following morning in compliance with the orders I had\r\nbrought him. He left the Mercedes-Benz behind. If I could have foreseen\r\nthe trouble that car was going to cause us, nothing could have tempted me\r\nto add it to our equipment. Even then Lamont eyed it with suspicion, but\r\nwe were both talked out of our misgivings by Steve, who rubbed his hands\r\nwith satisfaction at the prospect of the éclat it would lend our future\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nWith Shrady’s going, we fell heir to his duties. During our last three\r\ndays at the mine they complicated our lives considerably. There were\r\nrecords to be put in order, reports to be finished, pay accounts to be\r\nadjusted, ration books to be extended for the skeleton crew which would\r\nremain at the mine. In addition, I had to see Colonel Davitt about\r\nthe reduction and reorganization of the guard, and make provision for\r\ndifferent billeting and messing facilities.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these preparations, Ted Rousseau telephoned from House\r\n71. Were we planning to take Kress, the photographer, with us to\r\nBerchtesgaden? We certainly were. Steve would sooner have parted with\r\nhis right eye. Well, they wanted to interrogate him before we left. How\r\nlong would they need him? A few days. I suggested they start right away.\r\nWe’d be needing him too. Steve was wild when he heard about it. I agreed\r\nthat it was a nuisance but that we’d have to oblige. The OSS boys came\r\nfor Kress that afternoon. Steve watched them, balefully, as they drove\r\noff down the mountain. Then he resumed the work he had been doing on his\r\nbig Steyr truck. This was a cumbersome vehicle which he and Kress had\r\nbeen putting in order. It had belonged originally to the _Einsatzstab\r\nRosenberg_ and was part of Kress’ photographic unit. He and Steve were\r\nrefitting it to serve our purposes in a similar capacity. It was a fine\r\nidea, but so far they hadn’t been able to get it in running order. Steve\r\nhad had it painted. When he had nothing better to do, he tinkered with\r\nthe dead motor. Next to Kress, the truck was his most prized possession.\r\n\r\nI returned to Shrady’s old office where I found Lamont in conversation\r\nwith Dr. Hermann Michel. Michel was a shadowy figure who had been working\r\nat the mine with Sieber and Eder throughout our stay. When Posey and\r\nLincoln Kirstein had arrived at Alt Aussee in May, he had identified\r\nhimself as one of the ringleaders of the Austrian resistance movement and\r\nvociferously claimed the credit of saving the mine. Since then he had\r\nbeen working in the mine office. Captain Posey had given him permission\r\nto make a routine check of the books and archives stored there. He was\r\nsuch a talkative fellow that we kept out of his way as much as possible.\r\nAnd we didn’t like his habit of praising himself at the expense of\r\nothers. He was forever running to Plaut and Rousseau at House 71 with\r\nwritten and oral reports, warning them to beware of this or that man in\r\nthe mine organization.\r\n\r\nLamont looked decidedly harassed when I walked in. Michel was protesting\r\nour demands for a complete set of the records. We were to leave them\r\nin Colonel Davitt’s care when we closed the mine. Michel had taken the\r\nopportunity to say a few unpleasant things about Sieber. We finally made\r\nit clear to him that there would be no nonsense about the records, and\r\nalso that what we did about Sieber was our business. We finally packed\r\nhim off still protesting and shaking his head.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon before our departure Lamont and I had to go over to St.\r\nAgatha. The little village lay in the valley on the other side of the\r\nPötschen Pass. We were to verify the report that a small but important\r\ngroup of paintings was stored in an old inn there. A fine Hubert Robert\r\n_Landscape_, given to Hitler by Mussolini, was said to be among them.\r\n\r\nWe went first to the Bürgermeister who had the key. He drove with us to\r\nthe inn. It was an attractive Gasthaus, built in the early eighteenth\r\ncentury. The walls were frescoed and a wrought-iron sign hung over the\r\ndoorway. When we arrived the proprietress was washing clothes in the\r\narched passageway through the center of the building.\r\n\r\nShe took us to a large corner room on the second floor. There were some\r\nfifty pictures, all of them enormous and unframed. The Bürgermeister\r\nhelped us shift the unwieldy canvases about, so that we could\r\nproperly examine them. They were, for the most part, of indifferent\r\nquality—sentimental landscapes by obscure German painters of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nBut we did find five that were fine: the mammoth landscape with classical\r\nruins by Hubert Robert, the eighteenth century French master—this was\r\nthe one Mussolini had given the Führer; an excellent panel by Pannini—it\r\ntoo a landscape; a Van Dyck portrait; a large figure composition by Jan\r\nSiberechts, the seventeenth century Flemish painter; and a painting by\r\nRibera, the seventeenth century Spanish artist. We set them aside and\r\nsaid we’d return for them in a few days.\r\n\r\nWe had hoped to leave for Berchtesgaden by midmorning the next day, but\r\nwe didn’t get off until three in the afternoon. At the last minute I\r\nreceived word from Colonel Davitt’s office that the Mercedes-Benz was to\r\nbe left at the mine. I said that since we had no escort vehicle, it was\r\nan indispensable part of our convoy. That being the case, the colonel’s\r\nadjutant said we could take the car, but on condition that we return it\r\nwithin twenty-four hours. I said I’d see what I could do about that.\r\n\r\nSteve fumed while I talked. When I hung up the receiver he said, “Don’t\r\nbe a damn fool. Once the car’s out of his area, the colonel hasn’t got a\r\nthing to say about it. Let’s get going.”\r\n\r\nSieber and Eder, together with a dozen of the gnomes, were waiting in\r\nfront of the mine building when we came down the stairs. Lamont was\r\nalready in the car. I gave final instructions to the captain of the\r\nguard, said good-bys all around, and got in the car myself. Everybody\r\nsmiled and waved as we drove off.\r\n\r\nThe evacuation had been a success. Ninety truckloads of paintings,\r\nsculpture and furniture had been removed from the mine during the past\r\nfive weeks. Although it was by no means empty, the most important\r\ntreasures had been taken out. Third Army was withdrawing from the area.\r\nFrom now on the mine would be the responsibility of General Clark’s\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nWe were a lengthy cavalcade. Lamont and I took the lead. Steve followed\r\nin the Steyr truck, in running order at last. Behind him trailed five\r\ntrucks. We were to pick up eight more at Alt Aussee. It wasn’t going\r\nto be easy to keep such a long convoy in line. If we could only stay\r\ntogether until we got over the pass, the rest of the trip wouldn’t be too\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nWe made it over the pass without mishap. From time to time Lamont looked\r\nback to make sure the trucks were still following. He couldn’t count\r\nthem all, they were so strung out and the road was so winding. But we\r\nhad instructed the Negro lieutenant to give orders to his men to signal\r\nthe truck ahead in case of trouble, so we felt reasonably sure that\r\neverything was in order. When we reached Fuschl See we stopped along the\r\nlake shore to take count. One after another eight trucks pulled up. Five\r\nwere missing. Fifteen minutes passed and still no sign of the laggards.\r\nSteve said not to worry, to give them another quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nThe blue waters of the lake were inviting. Schiller might have composed\r\nthe opening lines of _Wilhelm Tell_ on this very spot. “Es lächelt der\r\nSee, er ladet zum Bade.” Steve and Lamont decided to have a swim. I\r\ndipped my hand in the water; it was icy. While they swam I kept an eye\r\nout for the missing vehicles. Presently two officers drove by in a jeep.\r\nI hailed them and ask if they had seen our trucks. They had—about ten\r\nmiles back two trucks had gone off the road. They thought there had\r\nbeen two or three others at the scene of the accident. Lamont and Steve\r\ndressed quickly. Steve said he’d go on with the eight trucks and meet us\r\nin Salzburg. Then Lamont and I started back toward Bad Ischl.\r\n\r\nWe hadn’t gone more than five miles when we came upon three of our\r\nvehicles. We signaled them to pull over to the side of the road. At first\r\nwe couldn’t make out what the drivers were saying—all three talked at\r\nonce. We finally got the story. A driver had taken a curve too fast and\r\nhad lost control of his truck. The one behind had been following too\r\nclosely and had also crashed over the side. The first driver had got\r\npinned under his truck and they had had to amputate a finger before he\r\ncould be extricated. The lieutenant in charge had stayed behind to take\r\ncare of things. He had told them to try to catch up with the rest of\r\nthe convoy. By the time they had given us all the details, we realized\r\nthat they had been drinking. And we guessed that alcohol had also\r\nhad something to do with the truck going off the road. We would have\r\nsomething to say to the lieutenant when he reached Berchtesgaden. He was\r\nnew on the job, having replaced Lieutenant Barboza only two days ago. We\r\nwere thankful that our precious packing materials had been put in two of\r\nthe trucks up ahead.\r\n\r\nSteve was waiting for us in the Mozart Platz when we reached Salzburg an\r\nhour and a half later with our three trucks in tow. He told the drivers\r\nwhere they could get chow. The three of us went across the river to the\r\nGablerbräu, the small hotel for transients, for our own supper. The\r\nBerchtesgaden operation hadn’t begun auspiciously.\r\n\r\nOur troubles weren’t over. When we pulled into Berchtesgaden at eight\r\no’clock, we couldn’t find Major Anderson, so we had to fend for\r\nourselves. We managed to put the drivers up for the one night in a\r\nbarracks by the railway station before going on to Unterstein ourselves.\r\nThe lieutenant in charge of the drivers hadn’t turned up when we were\r\nready to go, so I left word that he was to report to me first thing the\r\nnext morning. While we three felt unhappy over the lack of billeting\r\narrangements for us, we were too tired to think much about it that night.\r\nBed was all that mattered. The officer on duty at the Unterstein rest\r\nhouse said there was an empty room over the entrance hall which we could\r\nuse until we got permanent quarters. There were three bunks, so we moved\r\nin.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, everything started off beautifully the following morning.\r\nMajor Anderson appeared as we were finishing breakfast.\r\n\r\nHis apologies were profuse and he did everything he could to make\r\namends. We declined his offer to obtain rooms for us at the elegant\r\nBerchtesgadener Hof in town. We wanted to be on the spot. There was\r\nplenty of room in the rest house where we would be working; and we could\r\nmess with the half-dozen officers billeted in the adjacent barracks. The\r\nmajor introduced us to Edward Peck, the sergeant, who had been working on\r\nan inventory of the collection.\r\n\r\nTogether we made a tour of the premises. The paintings alone filled forty\r\nrooms. Four rooms and a wide corridor at the end of the ground-floor\r\nhall were jammed with sculpture. Still another room was piled high with\r\ntapestries. Rugs filled two rooms adjoining the one with the tapestries.\r\nTwo more rooms were given over to empty frames, hundreds of them. There\r\nwas the “Gold Room” where the objects of great intrinsic value were\r\nkept under lock and key. And there were three more rooms crammed with\r\nbarrels, boxes and trunks full of porcelain. One very large room was a\r\nsea of books and magazines, eleven thousand altogether. A small chapel on\r\nthe premises was overflowing with fine Italian Renaissance furniture.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary survey was discouraging. Although the objects were\r\ninfinitely more accessible than those at the mine had been, this\r\nadvantage was largely offset by the fact that they were all loose and\r\nwould have to be packed individually. Even the porcelain in barrels would\r\nhave to be repacked.\r\n\r\nOur first request was for a work party of twelve men—GIs, not PWs.\r\nWe suggested to the young C.O., Major Paul Miller, that he call for\r\nvolunteers. If possible, we wanted men who might prefer this kind of job\r\nto guard duty or other routine work. They could start in on the books\r\nwhile we mapped out our plan of attack on the rest of the things. Steve\r\nwent off with Major Miller to select the crew, and Lamont and I settled\r\ndown to discuss other problems with Major Anderson and Sergeant Peck.\r\n\r\nIt was the sergeant’s idea that the collection could be packed up one\r\nroom at a time. He had compiled his inventory with that thought in mind.\r\nUnfortunately we couldn’t carry out the evacuation in that order. We\r\nexplained why his system wouldn’t work: paintings, for example, had to\r\nbe arranged according to size. Otherwise we couldn’t build loads that\r\nwould travel safely. Even if we could have packed the pictures as he\r\nsuggested—one room at a time—it would have meant the loss of valuable\r\ntruck space. We assured him that, in the long run, our plan was the\r\npractical one. It did, however, involve considerable preliminary work.\r\nThe first job would be to assemble all of the pictures—and there were a\r\nthousand of them—in a series of rooms on one floor of the building. As\r\nthe sergeant had not quite finished his lists, we agreed to devote our\r\nenergies to the books for the rest of the day. By morning he would have\r\nhis inventory completed. Then the pictures could be shifted.\r\n\r\nLamont and I wanted to know more about the collection. How did it get to\r\nBerchtesgaden in the first place? Major Anderson was the man who could\r\nanswer our questions.\r\n\r\nAs the war ended, the French reached the town ahead of the Americans.\r\nThey had it to themselves for about three days and had raised hell\r\ngenerally. Göring’s special train bearing the collection had reached\r\nBerchtesgaden just ahead of the French. The collection, having been\r\nremoved from the Reichsmarschall’s place, Karinhall, outside Berlin,\r\nwas to have been stored in an enormous bunker by his hunting lodge up\r\nthe road. But there hadn’t been time. The men in charge of the train\r\ngot only a part of the things unloaded. Some of them were put in the\r\nbunker, others in a villa near by. Most of the collection was left in the\r\nnine cars of the train. The men had been more interested in unloading a\r\nstock of champagne and whisky which had been brought along in two of the\r\ncompartments.\r\n\r\nWhen the French entered the town, the train was standing on a siding not\r\nfar from the bunker. They may have made off with a few of the things, but\r\nthere were no apparent depredations. They peppered it along one side with\r\nmachine-gun fire. However, the damage had been relatively slight.\r\n\r\nThen the French had cleared out and the train was, so to speak, dumped in\r\nMajor Anderson’s lap, since he was the Military Government Officer with\r\nthe 101st Airborne Division. Under his supervision, the collection had\r\nbeen transferred from the train, from the bunker and from the villa, to\r\nthe rest house. Later he had been instrumental in having it set up as an\r\nexhibition. The exhibition had been a great success—perhaps too great a\r\nsuccess. He meant that it had attracted so much attention that some of\r\nthe higher-ups began to worry about the security of the things. Finally\r\nhe had received orders that the show was to close and of course he had\r\ncomplied at once.\r\n\r\nHe said that General Arnold had come to see the exhibition the day after\r\nthat. We asked if he had let him in. Well, what did we think? But he had\r\nturned down a three-star general who had come along after hearing that\r\nGeneral Arnold had been admitted. The general, he said, was hopping mad.\r\n\r\nThe major’s most interesting experience in connection with the\r\ncollection was his visit with Frau Göring. He heard that some of the\r\nbest pictures were in her possession, so he took a run down to Zell am\r\nSee where she was staying in a Schloss belonging to a South American.\r\nHe found the castle; he found Emmy; and he found the pictures. There\r\nwere indeed some of the best pictures—fifteen priceless gems of the\r\nfifteenth century Flemish school, from the celebrated Renders collection\r\nof Brussels. Göring had bought the entire collection of about thirty\r\npaintings. We knew that M. Renders was already pressing for the return\r\nof his treasures, claiming that he had been forced to sell them to the\r\nReichsmarschall. But that was another story.\r\n\r\nFrau Göring wept bitterly when the major took the pictures, protesting\r\nthat they were her personal property and not that of her husband. On the\r\nsame visit he had recovered another painting in the collection. Frau\r\nGöring’s nurse handed over a canvas measuring about thirty inches square.\r\nShe said Göring had given it to her the last time she saw him. As he\r\nplaced the package in her hands he had said, “Guard this carefully. It is\r\nof great value. If you should ever be in need, you can sell it, and you\r\nwill not want for anything the rest of your life.” The package contained\r\nGöring’s Vermeer.\r\n\r\nMajor Anderson stayed for lunch. As we walked back from the mess, a\r\ncommand car pulled up in front of the rest house. Bancel La Farge and a\r\nman in civilian clothes climbed out. I hadn’t seen Bancel for two months.\r\nHe was a major now. The civilian with him was an old friend of mine, John\r\nWalker, Chief Curator of the National Gallery at Washington and a special\r\nadviser to the Roberts Commission. John had flown over to make a brief\r\ninspection tour of MFA&A activities. Bancel was serving as his guide.\r\nThey were on their way to Salzburg and Alt Aussee.\r\n\r\nMajor Anderson proposed a trip to the Eagle’s Nest, Hitler’s mountain\r\nhide-out, suggesting that the visitors could look at the Göring pictures\r\nthat evening. Lamont and I said we had work to do, but we were easily\r\ntalked out of that.\r\n\r\nYou could see the Eagle’s Nest from the rest house. It was perched on top\r\nof the highest peak of the great mountain range which rose sharply from\r\nthe pine forests across the valley. We crossed to the western side and\r\nbegan a steep ascent. About a thousand feet above the floor of the valley\r\nwe came to Obersalzberg, once a select community of houses belonging\r\nto the most exalted members of the Nazi hierarchy. In addition to the\r\nBerghof, Hitler’s massive chalet, it included a luxurious hotel—the\r\nPlatter Hof—SS barracks, and week-end “cottages” for Göring and Martin\r\nBormann. The British bombed Obersalzberg in April 1945. The place was now\r\nin ruins. The Berghof was still standing but gutted by fire and stripped\r\nof all removable ornamentation by souvenir hunters.\r\n\r\nWe continued up the winding road carved from the solid rock, through\r\nthree tunnels, at length emerging onto a terraced turnaround, around,\r\nfive thousand feet above Berchtesgaden. The major told us that the road\r\nhad been built by slave labor. Three thousand men had worked on it for\r\nalmost three years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Portrait of a Young Girl_ by Chardin (_left_) and _Young\r\nGirl with Chinese Figure_ by Fragonard (_right_) were acquired by Göring\r\nfrom the confiscated Rothschild Collection of Paris. The paintings have\r\nbeen returned to France.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Christ and the Adulteress_, the fraudulent Vermeer, for\r\nwhich Göring exchanged 137 paintings of unquestioned authenticity.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Portrait of the Artist’s Sister_ by Rembrandt. One of the\r\nfive Rembrandts in the Göring Collection.]\r\n\r\nThe Eagle’s Nest was still four hundred feet above. From the turnaround\r\nthere were two means of access: an elevator and a footpath. The elevator\r\nshaft, hewn out of the mountain itself, was another feat of engineering\r\nskill. A broad archway of carved stone marked the entrance. Beside the\r\nelevator stood a sign which read, “For Field Grade Officers Only”—that\r\nis, majors and above.\r\n\r\n“A sentiment worthy of the builder,” Lamont observed as we took to the\r\nfootpath.\r\n\r\nOn our steep climb we wondered what Steve would say to such\r\ndiscrimination. We hadn’t long to wait. He made a trip to the Eagle’s\r\nNest a few days later. When stopped by the guard, he looked at him\r\ndefiantly and asked, “What do you take me for, a Nazi?” Steve rode up in\r\nthe elevator.\r\n\r\nThe Eagle’s Nest was devoid of architectural distinction. Built of cut\r\nstone, it resembled a small fort, two stories high. From the huge,\r\noctagonal room on the second floor—a room forty feet across, with windows\r\non five sides—one could look eastward into Austria, southward to Italy. A\r\nmile below lay the green valleys and blue lakes of Bavaria. They used to\r\nsay that every time Hitler opened a window a cloud blew in. The severity\r\nof the furnishings matched the bleakness of the exterior. An enormous\r\nconference table occupied the center of the room. Before the stone\r\nfireplace stood a mammoth sofa and two chairs. A smaller room adjoined\r\nthe main octagon at a lower level. The heavy carpet was frayed along one\r\nside. The caretaker, pointing to the damage, said that in his frequent\r\nfrenzies Hitler used to gnaw the carpet, a habit which had earned him\r\nthe nickname of “_Der Teppich-Beisser_,” the rug-biter. Considering the\r\nlabor expended on this mountain eyrie, the place had been little used.\r\nThe same caretaker told us that Hitler had never stayed there overnight.\r\nDaytime conferences had been held there occasionally, but that was all.\r\n\r\nIt was late when we got back to the rest house, so our guests postponed\r\ntheir inspection of the Göring collection until the following morning.\r\nThat evening Lamont and I made a second and more thorough survey of the\r\nrooms in which the paintings were stacked. We began with a room which\r\ncontained works of the Dutch, Flemish, German and French schools. The\r\ninventory listed five Rembrandt portraits. One was the _Artist’s Sister_;\r\nanother was his son _Titus_; the third was his wife, _Saskia_; the fourth\r\nwas the portrait of a _Bearded Old Man_; and the fifth was the likeness\r\nof a _Man with a Turban_.\r\n\r\nWe examined the backs of the pictures for markings which might give us\r\nclues to previous ownership. Two of the portraits—those of Saskia and of\r\nthe artist’s sister—had belonged to Katz, one of the best known Dutch\r\ndealers. I had been surprised to learn in Paris that Katz, a Jew, had\r\ndone business with the Nazis. But I was also told that only through\r\nacceding to their demands for pictures had he been able to obtain permits\r\nfor his relatives to leave Holland. According to the information I\r\nreceived, he had succeeded thereby in smuggling twenty-seven members of\r\nhis family into Switzerland. A revealing commentary on the extent and\r\nquality of his paintings.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Titus had been in the Van Pannwitz collection. Mme.\r\nCatalina van Pannwitz, South American born, but a resident of the\r\nNetherlands, I believe, had sold a large part of her collection to\r\nGöring. Whether it had been a bona fide or a forced sale was said to be a\r\nmoot question.\r\n\r\nAnother important Dutch private collection, that of Ten Cate at Almelo,\r\nhad “contributed” the _Man with a Turban_. And the _Bearded Old Man_ had\r\nbeen bought from the Swiss dealer, Wendland, who had agents in Paris. He\r\nhad allegedly discovered the painting in Marseilles.\r\n\r\nThese five pictures posed an interesting problem in restitution. To whom\r\nshould they be returned? Who were the rightful owners—as of the summer of\r\n1945?\r\n\r\nAt the time we were beginning our work on the Göring collection, definite\r\nplans for the restitution of works of art were being formulated by the\r\nAmerican Military Government. They were an important part of the general\r\nrestitution program then being planned by the Reparations, Deliveries\r\nand Restitution Division of the U. S. Group Control Council. Pending the\r\nimplementation of the program, the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives\r\nSection of U. S. Forces, European Theater, was the technical custodian of\r\nall art works eventually to be restituted.\r\n\r\nBancel La Farge, who became Chief of the Section when SHAEF dissolved,\r\nhad outlined the plans to us on our way back from the Eagle’s Nest\r\nthat afternoon. There were two main categories of works of art slated\r\nfor prompt restitution to the overrun countries from which they had\r\nbeen taken. The first included all art objects _easily identifiable as\r\nloot_—the great Jewish collections and the property of other “enemies\r\nof the state” which had been seized by the Nazis. The second embraced\r\nall art works _not_ readily identifiable as loot, but for which some\r\ncompensation was known or believed to have been paid by the Nazis.\r\n\r\nThe actual restitution was to be made on a wholesale scale. Works\r\nof art were to be returned _en bloc_ to the claimant nations, _not_\r\nto individual claimants of those nations. To expedite this “mass\r\nevacuation” country by country, properly qualified art representatives\r\nwould be invited to the American Occupied Zone, specifically to the\r\nCentral Collecting Point at Munich, where they could present their\r\nclaims. Once their claims were substantiated—either by documents in their\r\npossession or by records at the Collecting Point—the representatives\r\nwould be responsible for the actual removal.\r\n\r\nWe asked Bancel how the various representatives were to be selected.\r\nHe explained that several of the overrun countries had set up special\r\nFine Arts Commissions. The one in France was called the _Commission de\r\nRécupération Artistique_. The one in Holland had an unpronounceable\r\nname, so it was known simply as “C.G.R.”—the initials stood for the name\r\ntranslated into French, _Commission de Récupération Générale_. And the\r\none in Belgium had such a long name that he couldn’t remember it offhand.\r\nCzechoslovakia, Poland and Greece would probably establish similar\r\ncommittees before long. Each commission would choose a representative\r\nand submit his name to the MFA&A Section for approval. Once the names\r\nwere approved and the necessary military clearances obtained, the\r\nrepresentatives could enter the American Zone, proceed to Munich and\r\nstart to work.\r\n\r\nBancel said that each representative would have to sign a receipt in\r\nthe name of his country before he could remove any works of art from\r\nthe Collecting Point. The receipt would release our government from all\r\nfurther responsibility for the objects concerned—as of the time they left\r\nthe Collecting Point. Furthermore, it would contain a clause binding the\r\nreceiving nation to rectify any mistakes in restitution. For example, if\r\nthe Dutch representative inadvertently included a painting which later\r\nturned out to be the property of a Belgian, then, by the provisions of\r\nthe receipt, Holland would be obligated to return that painting to\r\nBelgium. The chief merit of this system of fine arts restitution lay\r\nin the fact that it relieved American personnel of the heavy burden of\r\nsettling individual claims. From the point of view of our government,\r\nthis was an extremely important consideration because of the limited\r\nnumber of men available for so formidable an undertaking. And from the\r\npoint of view of the receiving nations, the system had the advantage of\r\naccelerating the recovery of their looted treasures.\r\n\r\nIn the room where Lamont and I had seen the Rembrandts, we found a pair\r\nof panels by Boucher, the great French master of the eighteenth century.\r\nEach represented an ardent youth making amorous advances to a coy and\r\nbut half-protesting maiden in a rustic setting. They were appropriately\r\nentitled _Seduction_ and were said to have been painted for the boudoir\r\nof Madame de Pompadour. According to the inventory, the panels had been\r\nbought from Wendland, the dealer of Paris and Lucerne.\r\n\r\nThese slightly prurient canvases flanked one of the most beautiful\r\nfifteenth century Flemish paintings I had ever seen, _The Mystic Marriage\r\nof St. Catherine_ by Gerard David. The Madonna with the Child on her lap\r\nwas portrayed against a landscape background, St. Catherine kneeling at\r\nher right, dressed in russet velvet. Round about were grouped five other\r\nfemale saints, each richly gowned in a different color. It was not a\r\nlarge composition, measuring only about twenty-five inches square, but\r\nit possessed the dignity and monumentality of a great altarpiece. The\r\nauthenticity of its sentiment put to shame the facile virtuosity of the\r\ntwo Bouchers which stood on either side.\r\n\r\nThe second room we visited that evening contained an equally\r\nmiscellaneous assortment of pictures. Here the canvases were even more\r\nvaried in size. A _Dutch Interior_ by Pieter de Hooch, a _View of the\r\nPiazza San Marco_ by Canaletto, and two Courbet landscapes were lined\r\nup along one wall. The de Hooch, an exceptionally fine example of the\r\nwork of this seventeenth century master, was listed in the inventory as\r\nhaving belonged to Baron Édouard de Rothschild of Paris. The Courbets\r\nwere something of a rarity, as Göring had few French paintings of the\r\nnineteenth century. One of the landscapes, a winter scene, was an\r\nimportant work, signed and dated 1869. The inventory did not indicate\r\nfrom whom it had been acquired. In one corner stood a full-length\r\nportrait of the Duke of Richmond by Van Dyck. Our list stated that it\r\nhad come from the Katz collection. Beside it was a brilliant landscape\r\nby Rubens. There were perhaps ten other pictures in the room, among them\r\nseveral nondescript panels which appeared to be by an artist of the\r\nfifteenth century Florentine school, a portrait by the sixteenth century\r\nGerman master, Bernhard Strigel, a “fête champêtre” by Lancret, and two\r\nor three seascapes of the seventeenth century Dutch school.\r\n\r\nLamont and I had been looking at this assemblage for some little time\r\nbefore we noticed an unframed canvas standing on the washbasin by the\r\nwindow. The upper edge of the picture leaned against the wall mirror at\r\nan angle which made it difficult to get a good look at the composition\r\nfrom where we stood. Closer inspection revealed the subject to be _Christ\r\nand the Woman Taken in Adultery_. I studied it for a few minutes and was\r\nstill puzzled. Turning to Lamont I asked, “What do you make of this? I\r\ncan’t even place it as to school, let alone guess the artist.”\r\n\r\n“Unless I am very much mistaken,” he said slowly, “that is the famous\r\nGöring ‘Vermeer.’”\r\n\r\n“You’re crazy,” I said. “Why, I could paint something which would look\r\nmore like a Vermeer than that.”\r\n\r\nWe consulted the inventory. Lamont was right. A few lines below the\r\nlisting of the Rubens landscape—a picture I had just been admiring in\r\nanother part of the room—appeared the entry “Vermeer, Jan ... ‘The\r\nAdulteress’ ... Canvas, 90 cm. × 96 cm.” The subject coincided with that\r\nof the picture on the washbasin. The measurements were identical.\r\n\r\nI tried to visualize the picture properly framed, properly lighted and\r\nhanging in a richly furnished room. But still I couldn’t conceive how\r\nsuch trappings could blind one to the flat greens and blues, the lack\r\nof subtlety in the modeling of the flesh tones, the absence of that\r\nconvincing rendering of the “total visual effect” which Vermeer had so\r\ncompletely mastered.\r\n\r\n“Who attributed this painting to Vermeer?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said Lamont, “but it is related stylistically to the\r\n‘Vermeer,’ in the Boymans Museum at Rotterdam, the _Christ at Emmaus_.”\r\n\r\nSo this was the painting Hofer was talking about; this was the painting\r\nGöring had given the nurse. One of the notorious Van Meegeren fakes.\r\n\r\nLamont’s reference to the Boymans’ “Vermeer” called to mind the great\r\nfuror in the art world nearly a decade ago when that picture had turned\r\nup in the art market.\r\n\r\nDr. Bredius, the famous connoisseur of Dutch painting, discovered the\r\npicture in Paris in 1936. He was convinced that it was a hitherto unknown\r\nwork by Vermeer, the rarest of all Dutch masters. The subject matter was\r\nof special interest to Dr. Bredius, for the _only_ other Vermeer which\r\ndealt with a religious theme was the one in the National Gallery at\r\nEdinburgh.\r\n\r\nThe past history of the picture was as reassuring as that of many another\r\naccepted “old master.” Dr. Bredius learned that it had belonged to a\r\nDutch family. One of the daughters had married a Frenchman in the middle\r\neighties. The picture had been a wedding present and she had taken it\r\nwith her to Paris. But their house had been too small for such a large\r\npainting—it was four feet high and nearly square—so the canvas had been\r\nrelegated to the attic. According to the story, they hadn’t known that it\r\nwas particularly valuable or they might have sold it. In any case, the\r\npicture remained in the attic until the couple died. It had come to light\r\nagain when the house was being dismantled.\r\n\r\nThrough Dr. Bredius, the Boymans Museum had become interested in the\r\npicture. Other experts were called in. A few questioned it, but the\r\nmajority accepted it as a Vermeer. In 1937, the directors of the Boymans\r\nMuseum purchased the _Christ at Emmaus_ for the staggering price of three\r\nhundred and seventy-five thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nUnknown to the outside world, several more Vermeers were “discovered”\r\nduring the war years. All were of religious subjects. One was bought\r\nat a fantastic price by Van Beuningen, the great private collector\r\nof Rotterdam; another by the Nazi-controlled Dutch Government for an\r\nexorbitant sum; and a third by Hermann Göring. Though the Reichsmarschall\r\ndid not pay cash for his Vermeer, the price was high; he traded one\r\nhundred and thirty-seven pictures from his collection. According to\r\nHofer, his adviser and agent, the paintings he gave in exchange were all\r\nof high quality.\r\n\r\nThe final chapter in the story of these newly found Vermeers is one of\r\nthe most interesting in the annals of the art world. At the close of the\r\nwar, Dr. van Gelder, the director of the Mauritshuis—the museum at The\r\nHague—and other Dutch art authorities began an official investigation. It\r\nwas curious that so many lost Vermeers had come to light in such a short\r\nspace of time. It was recalled that in 1942 an artist named Van Meegeren\r\nhad delivered a million guilders to a Dutch bank for credit to his\r\naccount. The money was in thousand-guilder notes, which the Germans had\r\nordered withdrawn from circulation at that time. The artist was not known\r\nto be a man of means and his mediocre talents as a painter could not have\r\nenabled him to amass such a fortune.\r\n\r\nVan Meegeren was questioned and finally admitted that he had painted\r\nthe _Christ at Emmaus_ and the other lately discovered “Vermeers.” Even\r\nafter he had made a full confession, there were certain Dutch critics\r\nwho doubted the truth of his statements. This nettled Van Meegeren, and\r\nhe promptly offered to demonstrate his prowess. His choice of a subject\r\nmight have been symbolic: Jesus Confounding the Doctors. It took him\r\ntwo months to finish the picture. The work was done in the presence of\r\nseveral witnesses. He painted entirely from memory, using no models.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the demonstration, he explained the ingenious methods\r\nhe had used to defraud the experts. In the first place his compositions\r\nwere original but painted _in the style_ of Vermeer. In the second, he\r\nused old canvas and only the pigments known to the Dutch masters of the\r\nseventeenth century. It had not been difficult to pick up at auctions\r\nold paintings of little value. It was not always necessary to remove the\r\nexisting pictures. He frequently adapted portions of them to his own\r\ncompositions, or, conversely, rearranged his to take advantage of part of\r\nan old picture. He was scrupulously careful to avoid modern zinc white\r\nand used only lead white which had been employed by the artists of the\r\nseventeenth century. He took equal precautions with his other colors,\r\nusing ground lapis lazuli and cochineal for his blues and reds. He had\r\nobtained these, at great expense, from abroad.\r\n\r\nAt the time I was evacuating the Göring pictures, the Dutch government\r\nwas completing its investigation of Van Meegeren’s activities.\r\nSubsequently, the Ministry of Education, Arts and Sciences publicly\r\nannounced its findings, confirming the fact that Henrik van Meegeren was\r\nthe author of the celebrated picture in the Boymans Museum and also of\r\n“other forgeries done so marvelously that the best art experts pronounced\r\nthem genuine.”\r\n\r\nBancel La Farge and John Walker returned the following morning. Although\r\nit was Sunday, our crew of GIs had reported for work at seven-thirty and,\r\nunder Steve’s supervision, continued to pack books. Some eight thousand\r\nvolumes remained to be placed in cases before they could be loaded onto\r\nthe trucks. While this work was in progress Lamont and I made a tour\r\nof the pictures with our guests. We looked again at the rooms we had\r\nvisited the night before, singling out the paintings we thought would be\r\nof greatest interest to them, such as the best of the Dutch and Flemish\r\nmasters, the Cranachs, the eighteenth century French pictures and the\r\nfinest sculptures. We concluded the tour at noon. Our visitors had to get\r\nstarted on their way to the mine at Alt Aussee.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch Lamont joined the crew at work on the books, while I\r\nwent in search of Sergeant Peck. We had explained to him that all of\r\nthe paintings would have to be numbered before we could prepare them\r\nfor loading. The sergeant had agreed, but I was not certain that he\r\naltogether understood why we were so insistent on this point. I found\r\nPeck in his room at the end of the south wing of the rest house. As\r\nusual, he was working on the inventory. He was a serious, scholarly\r\nfellow. Before entering the Army, he had been an art teacher at an\r\nOhio college, so his present assignment was very much to his liking.\r\nHe had done a remarkably fine job on the inventory. It was a detailed\r\nseventy-page document giving the title of each picture, the name of the\r\nartist, the dimensions of the canvas and, where known, the name of the\r\ncollection from which it had been acquired.\r\n\r\nI told him that we hoped to get started on the pictures the next morning.\r\nWe would arrange them in rooms on the second floor of the center section\r\nof the building. Those rooms were the ones most accessible to the door\r\nleading to our loading platform. We would want him to be responsible for\r\nchecking off each picture as it was carried onto the truck. Since there\r\nwere more than a thousand paintings in the inventory, there was only one\r\npractical way this checking could be done: by going through all the rooms\r\nand numbering each picture, setting down the corresponding number on the\r\ncorrect entry in the inventory.\r\n\r\nI asked if he could spare the time to help me with the numbering that\r\nafternoon. He agreed; so, armed with the inventory and some chalk, we\r\nbegan with the rooms on the second floor. By midafternoon we had finished\r\nmarking two hundred pictures. Lamont could start with these the next\r\nforenoon. They would keep him busy until we had numbered an additional\r\nbatch.\r\n\r\nAt three Steve and I drove over to Brigade Headquarters to make\r\narrangements for escort vehicles. We expected to have our first convoy\r\nready to leave for Munich the following afternoon. It was only a\r\nninety-mile run, Autobahn all the way, so two jeeps would suffice.\r\n\r\nThe 44th AAA Brigade was established in General Keitel’s old\r\nheadquarters, about two miles northwest of Berchtesgaden. With its\r\nsmooth gravel driveways and well-tended lawns, the place had the air\r\nof a luxurious country club. The administrative offices were located\r\nin an L-shaped building, a modern adaptation of the familiar Bavarian\r\nprovincial style. The surrounding buildings—barracks and small houses—had\r\nbeen designed in the same style.\r\n\r\nWe were received by Captain Putman, the Chief of Staff’s adjutant, a\r\nbrisk young man, who promised to provide us with the necessary escort\r\nvehicles.\r\n\r\n“Cocky fellow, wasn’t he?” said Steve as we left the office.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I have a feeling we’ll get our jeeps on schedule,” I said.\r\n\r\nMy hunch was right. Only once during the entire Berchtesgaden operation\r\ndid the escort vehicles fail to report for duty at the appointed hour.\r\nThat one time was when Captain Putman had a day off.\r\n\r\nBy noon the next day our first convoy of four trucks was ready for the\r\nroad. Two of the trucks were filled with books, twenty-seven cases of\r\nthem. The other two contained twenty-five cases, but not cases of books:\r\nfour were filled with glassware (308 pieces); seven contained porcelain\r\n(1135 pieces); eight contained gold and silver plate (415 pieces); and\r\nthe remaining six were packed with rugs. These were from Karinhall, near\r\nBerlin, the largest of Göring’s seven households.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we had dispatched the convoy, Lamont and four members of the\r\nwork party resumed the sorting and stacking of the numbered paintings.\r\nSergeant Peck and I, with two helpers to shift the larger canvases,\r\nproceeded with the numbering. Steve took off for Alt Aussee to pick up\r\nKress, the photographer, and his paraphernalia.\r\n\r\nThat night Lamont decided we should improve our quarters. This involved\r\nmoving from the room we occupied at the front of the building to a much\r\nlarger one at the back. The new room had several advantages which the old\r\none lacked. It had been the reading room of the rest house in the days of\r\nthe Luftwaffe occupancy and was attractively paneled in natural oak with\r\nbuilt-in bookshelves. It was thirty feet long and fifteen wide, nearly\r\ntwice the size of our former room, and opened onto a broad porch. There\r\nwere French doors and two large windows which afforded a spectacular view\r\nof the mountain range to the east. The Eagle’s Nest crowned the highest\r\nof the peaks. At one end of the room was an alcove, with a built-in desk\r\nand couch. With a little fixing up, it could be turned into a comfortable\r\nsitting room.\r\n\r\nBefore we could transfer our belongings to this spacious apartment, we\r\nhad to clear out a few of the Reichsmarschall’s—half a dozen pieces of\r\nsculpture and three large altarpieces. The outstanding piece of sculpture\r\nwas a life-size statue of the Magdalene which Göring had acquired from\r\nthe Louvre. Similarly, the most important of the three altarpieces\r\nwas a big triptych which also had come from the Louvre. Göring did\r\nnot remove these objects by force. He obtained them by exchange after\r\nprolonged negotiations with the officials of the museum. According to\r\nthe information given me, both parties were well pleased with the trade.\r\nAs I recall, the Louvre received six objects from the Reichsmarschall’s\r\ncollection in return for the triptych and the statue. I was told that\r\none of the six pieces was a painting by Coypel, the eighteenth century\r\nFrench artist, which had belonged to one of the Paris Rothschilds. It was\r\nbecause they were of German workmanship that Göring particularly coveted\r\nthe pieces which he obtained from the Louvre. It is presumed that this\r\ndid not prejudice the Louvre in their favor.\r\n\r\nThe statue, portraying the Magdalene clothed only in her long blonde\r\ntresses, was known as “la belle allemande,” the beautiful German. It\r\nwas an exceptionally fine example, in polychromed wood, of the work of\r\nGregor Erhardt, a Swabian sculptor of the first quarter of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. I fancied that Göring detected a resemblance between the statue\r\nand his wife. Lamont and I carried the statue down to the first floor of\r\nthe rest house and placed it at the foot of the stairs.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the last objects we packed for shipment and, during our\r\nstay at Berchtesgaden, I had the uncomfortable feeling that I had caught\r\nFrau Göring on her way to the bath. I was not the only one with that\r\nidea. One evening I found the GI guard draping a raincoat about the\r\nMagdalene’s shoulders. I had given strict orders that the guards were to\r\ntouch nothing in the collection, so I stopped to have a word with him on\r\nthe subject. He said with a sheepish look, “I didn’t mean to break the\r\nrules, sir, but I thought Emmy looked cold.”\r\n\r\nThe altarpiece which Göring acquired from the Louvre was a sumptuous\r\naffair consisting of three panels painted with nearly life-size figures\r\nagainst a gold background. It was by the Master of the Holy Kinship, an\r\nartist of the Cologne School of the fifteenth century. The large center\r\npanel represented the _Presentation in the Temple_; the right-hand panel,\r\nthe _Adoration of the Magi_; the left-hand panel, _Christ Appearing to\r\nMary_. During its recent peregrinations the central panel had cracked\r\nfrom top to bottom. But fortunately the cleavage, which ran through the\r\ncenter of the middle panel, fell in an area devoid of figures. An adroit\r\nrestorer could easily repair the damage. We shifted the altarpiece to an\r\nadjoining room.\r\n\r\nThe two remaining altarpieces were works of the fifteenth century French\r\nschool. One represented the _Crucifixion_; the other, the _Passion of\r\nChrist_. The _Crucifixion_ had belonged to the Paris dealer Seligmann,\r\nwhose collection had been confiscated by the Nazis. The inventory did\r\nnot show the name of the former owner of the other panel. A highly\r\nimaginative composition with nocturnal illumination, it was attributed to\r\nthe rare French master, Jean Bellegambe. As we carried the altarpieces\r\ninto the room in which we had placed the one from the Louvre, I remarked\r\nto Lamont that for a godless fellow Göring seemed to have had a nice\r\ntaste for religious subjects. The pieces of sculpture, which we added to\r\nthe collection in the lower hallway, were also of devotional character:\r\ntwo Gothic statues of St. George and the Dragon, one of St. Barbara, and\r\ntwo of the Madonna and Child.\r\n\r\nWe brought three large wardrobes from our old room, placed two of them\r\nat right angles to the walls to form a partition, and set the third in a\r\ncorner of the new room. The beds came next. In another hour we had the\r\nfurniture arranged to our satisfaction. By the time we had added a silver\r\nlamp, borrowed temporarily from the Göring collection, and tacked up a\r\nfew of our photographs, the place looked as though we had been living\r\nthere for weeks.\r\n\r\nWithout Steve the loading went more slowly, but we managed to finish\r\nthree trucks by two o’clock the next day. The driver of one of the\r\nescort jeeps had brought us a message from Munich that it would simplify\r\nthe work at the Central Collecting Point if we dispatched the trucks\r\nin groups of three or four instead of waiting until we had six loaded.\r\nAt the Alt Aussee mine we hadn’t been able to work on such a schedule\r\nbecause we lacked sufficient escort vehicles. We didn’t have that problem\r\nat Berchtesgaden because the shorter distance made possible a one day\r\nturnaround. The jeeps could easily make the round trip in half a day.\r\nAccordingly, we sent off our second convoy that afternoon. The trucks\r\ncontained the rest of the books—forty-three cases in all—sixty-five\r\npaintings and fifteen of the larger pieces of sculpture.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of Kress’ arrival, we spent the next morning assembling\r\nall the paintings that appeared to have suffered recent damage of any\r\nkind. His first job would be to make a photographic record which we\r\nwould include in our final report on the evacuation of the collection.\r\nWe found thirty-four pictures in this category. Only two had sustained\r\nserious injury. These were the side panels of a large triptych by the\r\nsixteenth century Italian artist, Raffaellino del Garbo. They had been\r\nbadly splintered by machine-gun fire while the collection was still\r\naboard the special train which had brought it to Berchtesgaden. Three\r\nother panels bore the marks of stray bullets, but the harm done was\r\nrelatively slight. In general, the damage consisted of minor nicks\r\nand scratches and water spots. Considering the hazards to which the\r\ncollection had been exposed, the pictures had come through remarkably\r\nwell. I was reminded of what George Stout had said, “There’s a lot of\r\nnonsense talked about the fragility of the ‘old masters.’ By and large,\r\nthey are a hardy lot. Otherwise they wouldn’t have lasted this long.”\r\n\r\nWe had worked our crew all day Sunday, so we told them to knock off\r\nas soon as we had finished selecting and segregating the damaged\r\npictures. With the afternoon to ourselves, we turned our attention to\r\nthe miscellaneous assortment of objects in the “Gold Room.” This was\r\nthe name given the small room on the ground floor in which Sergeant\r\nPeck had stored the things of great intrinsic value. There were\r\nseventy-five pieces in all: gold chalices studded with precious stones;\r\nsilver tankards; reliquaries of gold and enamel work; boxes of jade and\r\nmalachite; candelabra, clocks and lamps of marble and gold; precious\r\nplaques of carved ivory; and sets of gold table ornaments. They presented\r\na specialized packing job which Lamont and I could handle better alone\r\nthan with inexperienced helpers.\r\n\r\nOur first problem was to find some small packing cases. We searched\r\nthe rest house without success. Then Lamont remembered seeing a pile\r\nof individual wooden file cabinets in the little chapel where most of\r\nthe furniture was stored. These were admirably suited to our purpose.\r\nThey were rectangular boxes about six feet long and two feet high. Each\r\nwas divided into three compartments. There were thirty of them—more\r\nthan enough for the job. We had a supply of flannel cloths which we had\r\nborrowed from a packing firm in Munich. After wrapping each piece, we\r\nplaced it in one of the compartments of the file cabinet. We stuffed the\r\ncompartments with excelsior so that the objects could not move about.\r\n\r\nA few of the items were equipped with special leather cases. Among these\r\nwere two swords: one, with a beautifully etched blade of Toledo steel,\r\nhad been presented to Göring by the Spanish air force; the other, with\r\na jewel-studded gold handle, had been a gift from Mussolini. There was\r\nalso a gold baton encrusted with precious stones, a present from the\r\nReichsmarschall’s own air force.\r\n\r\nOf all these objects, perhaps twenty were of modern workmanship. In\r\ncontrast to the older things, they were ornate without being beautiful.\r\nUgliest of the lot was a standing lamp. The stalk, eight inches in\r\ndiameter, was a shaft of beaten gold. The shade, with a filigree design,\r\nwas also of gold, as were the pull cords. Rivaling it in costly vulgarity\r\nwas a set of gold table ornaments. The large centerpiece consisted of\r\nan elliptical framework. At each end and in the center of the two sides\r\nstood Egyptian maidens, fashioned of gold, four feet high. The German\r\nslang word for such stuff is “kitsch.” I think the closest English\r\nequivalent is “corny.”\r\n\r\nToward the end of the afternoon we were waited on by a delegation of\r\nthree officers from the 101st Airborne Division. They had come to inquire\r\nif we would consider turning over to them the gold sword which Mussolini\r\nhad given to Göring. They wanted it as a trophy for a club of 101st\r\nAirborne officers which they were organizing. They planned to set up a\r\nclubroom when they got back home and have annual reunions. The sword,\r\nthey said, would be such an appropriate souvenir. I told them that I had\r\nbeen directed to ship everything to Munich and did not have authority to\r\nmake any other disposition of objects in the collection. But, since the\r\nsword could not be regarded as a “cultural object”—a fact which I called\r\nto their attention—I suggested that they take the matter up with Third\r\nArmy Headquarters in Munich. I refrained from informing them that, for\r\nall of me, they could have their pick of the modern objects in the “Gold\r\nRoom.”\r\n\r\nWe made an interesting discovery that afternoon. Rummaging in a closet\r\noff the “Gold Room” we found a stack of photograph albums. At the bottom\r\nof the heap lay an enormous portfolio. It contained architect’s drawings\r\nfor the proposed expansion of Karinhall. The estate, greatly enlarged,\r\nwas to have become a public museum. We had heard that Göring intended\r\nto present his art collection to the Reich on his sixtieth birthday.\r\nHere was concrete proof of those intentions. Each drawing bore the date\r\n“January 1945.”\r\n\r\nSteve returned in triumph at noon the next day. With him in the command\r\ncar was Kress, looking more timid than ever. Steve said that Kress had\r\nhad a bad time after we left Alt Aussee; the boys at House 71 had clapped\r\nhim in jail and left him there for two days before interrogating him.\r\nSteve had been “burned up” about it and had given them a piece of his\r\nmind. He said contemptuously that he had known all along they didn’t have\r\nanything on Kress. But he was content to let bygones be bygones. Steve\r\nhad his man Friday back again.\r\n\r\nHe pointed happily to the six-by-six which had pulled up behind the\r\ncommand car. All of Kress’ photographic equipment was packed up inside\r\nit. There was a tremendous lot of stuff: three large cameras, a metal\r\ntable for drying prints, reflectors, a sink, pipes of various sizes,\r\nboxes of film and paper, and a couple of large cabinets. Steve planned to\r\nget everything installed at once. Kress was to sleep in one of the rooms\r\nof the rest house. An adjoining room was to be set up as a darkroom.\r\n\r\nWe showed Steve our new quarters and suggested that Kress take over our\r\nold room. The one next door would make a good darkroom. I asked Steve how\r\nhe was going to get all the stuff installed. He’d have to have a plumber.\r\nThat didn’t bother Steve. He asked me to tell the mess sergeant that\r\nKress was to have his meals with the civilian help in the kitchen. He’d\r\ntake care of everything else. Steve was as good as his word. He found a\r\nplumber and by the end of the day Kress was ready to start work.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these interruptions, Lamont and I managed to load and\r\ndispatch a convoy of three trucks. This third convoy contained two\r\nhundred paintings, thirty tapestries, fifteen more pieces of large\r\nsculpture and a dozen pieces of Italian Renaissance furniture.\r\n\r\nAt odd moments during our first days at Berchtesgaden, we had worried\r\nabout the sculpture. In the first three convoys we had disposed of only\r\nthirty of the two hundred and fifty pieces. Most of those remaining were\r\njust under life size. We had no materials with which to build crates.\r\nAnd even if we had had the lumber, the labor of building them would have\r\ngreatly delayed the evacuation. That evening we found the solution of\r\nthe problem. The three of us were standing on the open porch outside our\r\nroom after supper. Two of the trucks were parked by the loading platform\r\ndirectly below. Why not make a checkerboard pattern of ropes, strung\r\nwaist high across the truck bed? The floor of the truck could be padded\r\nwith excelsior. We could set a statue in each of the squares. The ropes\r\nwould hold each piece in place. If we stuffed quantities of excelsior\r\nbetween the statues, they wouldn’t rub. Perhaps it was a crazy idea. On\r\nthe other hand, it might work.\r\n\r\nThe following morning Steve and two of the men prepared the truck while\r\nLamont and I selected the statues for the trial load. We chose thirty of\r\nthe largest pieces. We figured on seven or eight rows, with four statues\r\nin each row. Kress set up his camera on the porch and photographed the\r\nprogress of the operation. One by one the long row of madonnas, saints\r\nand angels was set in place. We hadn’t been far off in our calculations.\r\nThere were twenty-nine in all. The truck looked like a tumbrel of the\r\nFrench Revolution filled with victims for the guillotine. It was a new\r\ntechnique in the packing of sculpture. Steve said we’d have to send\r\nGeorge Stout a photograph. “And we’ll have to send for more excelsior,\r\ntoo,” Lamont said. He was quite right. We had used up the last shred.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Steve combed the countryside for a fresh supply of\r\nexcelsior, returning just before supper with three new bales. In the\r\nmeantime, Lamont went over, with Kress, the paintings to be photographed.\r\nSergeant Peck and I completed numbering the last of the pictures.\r\n\r\nThe next day we loaded three more trucks. With Steve on hand to crack the\r\nwhip over the men, the loading went fast, so fast in fact that Sergeant\r\nPeck had a hard time checking off the paintings as they were hoisted onto\r\nthe trucks. We packed four hundred pictures, the cases containing the\r\ngold and silver objects which Lamont and I had finished the day before,\r\nand another dozen pieces of furniture. The convoy—our fourth—got off in\r\nthe early afternoon. We placed a special guard on the truck with the\r\nsculpture to make sure that the driver didn’t smoke on the way.\r\n\r\nWe finished one more truck and stopped for a cigarette. It was a hot day\r\nand we didn’t feel like doing any more work. Steve had gone up to the\r\ndarkroom to see Kress. Lamont said, “Let’s go up to Munich.”\r\n\r\n“That suits me, but what excuse have we got?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“If we must have an excuse, I can think of at least four,” he said\r\nthoughtfully. “We’re out of cigarettes and candy. We ought to be on hand\r\nwhen they unpack the sculpture at the Collecting Point. We’ve worked for\r\na week without taking a day off. And perhaps there’ll be some mail for us\r\nat Posey’s office.”\r\n\r\n“What about the little brown bear? Do you think he’ll mind our taking\r\noff?” I asked. This was Lamont’s name for Steve, but it was never used\r\nwhen he was within earshot.\r\n\r\n“Steve’s had his trip for this week,” said Lamont, meaning Steve’s trip\r\nto Alt Aussee.\r\n\r\nSergeant Peck, who had overheard part of our conversation, asked if he\r\nmight join us. We told him to be ready in ten minutes and went off to\r\nnotify Steve of our plans and to pack up our musette bags. Steve was\r\nso busy helping Kress with his developing that he scarcely paid any\r\nattention to us. After leaving him a final injunction to have at least\r\nthree trucks loaded before we got back the next evening, we called for\r\nthe command car. The driver, a restless redhead named Freedberg, who\r\nhated the monotonous routine at Berchtesgaden, was delighted with the\r\nidea of going to Munich. Sergeant Peck appeared and we set off.\r\n\r\nWe chose the shorter road through the mountains and overtook the convoy\r\non the Autobahn, halfway to Munich. The front escort jeep was holding\r\nthe speed down to thirty-five miles an hour, in accordance with my\r\ninstructions. The driver waved envyingly as we passed them doing fifty.\r\nTwenty miles from Munich, Freedberg turned west off the Autobahn and took\r\nthe back road from Bad Tölz, a short cut which brought us directly to\r\nThird Army Headquarters.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Captain Posey’s office just as Lincoln Kirstein was leaving\r\nfor chow. He told us that the captain had gone to Pilsen the middle of\r\nthe week but was due back that evening. “There’s quite a lot of mail for\r\nboth of you,” Lincoln said. He handed us each a thick batch of letters.\r\nIt was the first mail I had received from home in six weeks. There were\r\nforty-two letters!\r\n\r\n“I told you there’d be mail for us,” said Lamont with a satisfied smile.\r\n\r\nWe had supper with Craig Smyth and Ham Coulter at the Detachment that\r\nevening. Craig said that the convoy had not arrived before he left the\r\nCollecting Point, but two of his German workmen were to be on duty the\r\nnext morning, even though it was Sunday. We arranged to meet him at his\r\noffice and supervise the unloading. Lincoln had said that Posey would not\r\nbe back before ten, so we spent the evening with Craig and Ham at their\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nJust before we returned to Third Army Headquarters, Ham gave us a small\r\npaper-bound volume. It was entitled _The Ludwigs of Bavaria_. The author\r\nwas Henry Channon.\r\n\r\n“This is one of the most fascinating books I’ve ever read,” Ham said.\r\n“You might take it along with you.”\r\n\r\nI thanked him, and stuck it in my musette bag. Before our operations\r\nin Bavaria ended two months later, that little book had come to mean\r\na great deal to the members of the evacuation team. We called it our\r\n“Bavarian bible.” So alluring were Channon’s descriptions of the\r\n“Seven Wonders of Bavaria” that whenever we had a free day—or even\r\na few hours to ourselves—we made excursions to these architectural\r\nfantasies: the swirling, baroque churches of Wies, Weltenburg,\r\nOttobeuren and Vierzehnheiligen; the Amalienburg and the palace of\r\nHerrenchiemsee. The Residenz at Würzburg, which we had seen, was one\r\nof the seven. Unofficially we added an eighth to the list: Schloss\r\nLinderhof, Ludwig II’s opulent little palace near Oberammergau—ornate and\r\nvulgar, yet fascinating in its lonely mountain setting. But these were\r\nextracurricular activities, falling outside the orbit of our official\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nWe found Captain Posey at his office when we got there a few minutes\r\nbefore ten that evening. He asked us for a complete account of our\r\noperations at Berchtesgaden. We reported that we had sent a total of\r\nfourteen truckloads up to Munich the first week; that we had cleaned\r\nout half the pictures, but that we had just begun on the sculpture. We\r\nestimated that it would take us another ten days to finish; we would\r\nprobably fill seventeen or eighteen more trucks.\r\n\r\nWe asked him what plans he would have for us when we completed the job.\r\nHe said he might send us to the Castle of Neuschwanstein. The place\r\nwas full of things looted from Paris. In fact, it was one of the major\r\nrepositories of the _Einsatzstab Rosenberg_. The French were clamoring to\r\nhave it evacuated. Then there was another big repository in a Carthusian\r\nmonastery at Buxheim. That too contained loot from Paris. Perhaps we\r\ncould take a run down to both places and size up the jobs after we had\r\nfinished with the Göring things. The captain was tired after his long\r\ntrip, so we didn’t go into details about either of the two prospective\r\nassignments. He offered us a billet for the night and the three of us\r\nturned in shortly after eleven. It was none too soon for me: I still had\r\nforty-two unopened letters from home in the pocket of my jacket.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the Collecting Point the next morning, the two German\r\nworkmen who had been with me at Hohenfurth were starting to unpack the\r\ntruck with the sculpture. Lamont and I examined each statue as it was\r\nlifted from its nest of excelsior. All twenty-nine had come through\r\nwithout a scratch. Our experiment was a success. We would be able to\r\nuse the same technique with the rest of the sculpture. I instructed the\r\nworkmen to leave all of the excelsior in the truck, as we had none to\r\nspare.\r\n\r\nI persuaded Craig to drive back to Berchtesgaden with us for the\r\nnight. He looked tired and I thought the change would do him good. His\r\nresponsibilities at the Collecting Point—the “Bau,” as we called it (our\r\nabbreviation for Verwaltungsbau)—were heavy; and he never took a day off.\r\n\r\nOn the return trip he told us his latest troubles. Only three days ago a\r\nsmall bomb had exploded in the basement of the “Bau.” It had blown one\r\nof the young German workmen to bits. Craig gave all the grisly details,\r\nwhich included discovering one of the poor fellow’s arms in a heap of\r\ndebris fifty feet from the scene of the explosion. The tragedy had had\r\none beneficial result. For weeks Craig had been harping on the subject of\r\nadditional guards for the Collecting Point. His words had fallen on deaf\r\nears—until the bomb episode. He said that a general and three colonels\r\narrived at the building within half an hour. Since then everyone had\r\nbeen so “security-conscious” that he had had no further difficulty in\r\nobtaining the desired number of guards. The Bomb Disposal Unit inspected\r\nthe premises and some pointed comments were made about the thoroughness\r\nof the original survey.\r\n\r\nIn our absence Steve had loaded three trucks. As a reward for his\r\nlabors, I suggested that he take Craig up to the Eagle’s Nest the\r\nfollowing morning. While they were gone, Lamont and I finished three\r\nmore loads. We had the convoy of six lined up by noon. Craig returned\r\nto Munich in one of the escort jeeps. This fifth convoy contained\r\none hundred and sixty-seven paintings, one hundred and six pieces\r\nof sculpture, twenty-five tapestries, sixty-eight cases filled with\r\nbibelots, and fifty-three pieces of furniture. It was our largest convoy\r\nout of Berchtesgaden thus far.\r\n\r\nIt was also the first one to break down. Late in the afternoon, the rear\r\nescort jeep arrived at the rest house with word that two of the trucks\r\nhad broken down fifteen miles out of Berchtesgaden. Steve and I drove\r\nto Berchtesgaden to arrange to have them towed in for reloading. I also\r\nwanted to do a little investigating. There could be little excuse for\r\nbreakdowns on the Munich road if the trucks had been in good mechanical\r\ncondition when they started out.\r\n\r\nOn the way into town, Steve said, “Tom, I think I know what caused the\r\ntrouble. I didn’t think of it till just now. But the other day on the\r\nroad back from Alt Aussee, two six-by-sixes passed me at a hell of a\r\nclip. I thought I recognized the drivers as two of ours.”\r\n\r\nI questioned the lieutenant in charge of the drivers. He professed\r\nignorance of any unauthorized junkets back to Alt Aussee.\r\n\r\n“I am going to have a word with Tiny,” said Steve as we left the\r\nlieutenant’s room. Tiny was the head mechanic and the only one of the\r\nentire crew who was always on the job. Steve wanted to talk to him alone,\r\nso I waited in the car.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later he came back with a satisfied grin on his face. “I\r\ngot the whole story,” he said. “The drivers have been racing back and\r\nforth to Alt Aussee all the time we’ve been here. They were crazy about\r\nit up at the mine. Tiny says they hate it here at Berchtesgaden.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we’ll fix that,” I said. I went back to see the lieutenant. “How\r\nmany drivers have you got and how many trucks?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Sixteen drivers and thirteen trucks,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Send eight of the drivers and five of the trucks up to Munich first\r\nthing in the morning and have them report to the trucking company. We can\r\nfinish the job here without them.”\r\n\r\nSteve always sang when he was in a particularly happy frame of mind. That\r\nevening, on the way back to the rest house, he was in exceptionally good\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nFive days later we completed the evacuation of the Göring collection.\r\nThe last two convoys, of four and seven trucks respectively, contained\r\nthe larger pictures, one hundred and seventy-seven of them; sixty\r\npieces of sculpture, twenty miscellaneous cases, sixty-seven pieces\r\nof furniture and two hundred empty picture frames. We had heavy rain\r\nthat last week and the mud was ankle-deep around the loading platform.\r\nAlthough it was early August, the nights were cold and the rest house,\r\nemptied of its treasures, was a cheerless place. We were glad to see\r\nthe last of the trucks pull out of the drive. It had been a strenuous\r\noperation—thirty-one truckloads in thirteen days. In the early afternoon\r\nwe would collect our personal belongings and return to Munich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(8)\r\n\r\n_LOOTERS’ CASTLE: SCHLOSS NEUSCHWANSTEIN_\r\n\r\n\r\nA telephone call from Brigade Headquarters changed our plans. It was\r\nMajor Luther Miller of G-2. He had just made an inspection of a house\r\nbelonging to one of Göring’s henchmen and there was a lot of “art stuff”\r\nin it. He had reported the find to Third Army Headquarters and Captain\r\nPosey had told him to get in touch with me. Could I go up to the house\r\nwith him that afternoon?\r\n\r\nMajor Miller picked me up after lunch. He was a handsome fellow, tall\r\nand sparely built. He had an easy, pleasant manner. As we drove along\r\nhe gave me further details about the house to which we were going. It\r\nhad been occupied until the day before by Fritz Görnnert and his wife.\r\nGörnnert had been the social secretary and close confidant of Göring. The\r\nGörnnerts had been living on the second and third floors. They shared the\r\nhouse with a man named Angerer, who had the first floor. Both Görnnert\r\nand Angerer had been apprehended and were now in jail. Major Miller had\r\nfound a suspiciously large number of tapestries and other art objects on\r\nthe premises. He thought they might be loot.\r\n\r\nThe house was an unpretentious villa hidden among pine trees high up\r\nin the hills above the town. The place was under guard. On the ground\r\nfloor we examined the contents of a small store-room. There were several\r\ncases bearing Angerer’s name and three or four large crates containing\r\nItalian furniture. A similar store-room on the second floor contained a\r\ndozen tapestries, a pile of Oriental rugs, a large collection of church\r\nvestments and nearly a hundred rare textiles mounted on cardboard. I\r\nnoticed that the tapestries, vestments and textiles were individually\r\ntagged and that the markings were in French.\r\n\r\nConcealed beneath the tapestries were ten cases, each one about two feet\r\nsquare and a foot high. Major Miller hadn’t seen these before. On each\r\none was stenciled in Gothic letters: “Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring.”\r\nThey contained a magnificent collection of Oriental weapons.\r\n\r\nIn a room which Görnnert had apparently used for a study we found six\r\nhandsome leather portfolios filled with Old Master drawings. The drawings\r\nwere by Dutch and French artists of the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nThere was a possibility that all of these things, with the exception of\r\nthe weapon collection, which Göring had probably entrusted to Görnnert,\r\nwere the legitimate property of the tenants. It was equally possible\r\nthat they had been illegally acquired. In the circumstances, Major\r\nMiller wished me to take charge of them. I said that I could take them\r\nto the Central Collecting Point at Munich where they would be held in\r\nsafekeeping until ownership had been determined.\r\n\r\nThe house had been thoroughly ransacked. Drawers had been pulled out and\r\ntheir contents disarranged. Closet doors stood open and the clothing\r\non the hangers had been gone over. The beds were rumpled, for even the\r\nmattresses had been searched. Despite the topsy-turvy look of things,\r\nthere was no evidence of wanton destruction. The search had been thorough\r\nand methodical. I asked the major what his men had been looking for, but\r\nhis answer was noncommittal. He did say, though, that the discovery of\r\ndocuments hidden in a false partition in the living room had prompted the\r\nsearch.\r\n\r\nThe following morning Steve, Lamont and I went to the Görnnert house in\r\nthe command car. It would have been difficult to take a large truck up\r\nthe narrow winding road. In any case, I thought we could probably load\r\nall of the stuff in the command car. Major Miller had sent one of his\r\nofficers ahead with the key. The house had been searched again. This time\r\nit looked as though a cyclone had struck it. Pillows had been ripped\r\nopen; drawers had been emptied on the floor; clothes were scattered all\r\nover the bedrooms. I was relieved to find that the things which we had\r\ncome to take away had not been tampered with. I asked the lieutenant with\r\nthe key what had been going on in the house, and he muttered something\r\nabout “those CIC boys.” I seemed to have touched on a sore subject,\r\nso I didn’t pursue the matter. Lamont, who knew the ways of the Army\r\nfar better than I, said that probably there had been a “jurisdictional\r\ndispute” over who had the right to search the place and that perhaps two\r\ndifferent outfits had taken a crack at it. I was glad that Major Miller’s\r\nemissary was there to bear witness to _our_ behavior.\r\n\r\nWe bundled up the rugs, tapestries and textiles and got out as quickly\r\nas possible. They completely filled the command car. Lamont and Steve\r\nsat in front with the driver. I wedged myself in between the top of the\r\npile and the canvas top of the car. There was no room for the ten cases\r\nof weapons, so I sent a message to Major Miller to have one of his men\r\ndeliver them to us later in the day.\r\n\r\nWhen we got back to the rest house, Kress had dismantled his darkroom\r\nand after lunch we loaded the photographic equipment onto the one truck\r\nwe had held over for that purpose. There was ample space for the things\r\nfrom the Görnnert house. Before packing them we had to make a complete\r\nlist of the items. There were two hundred and thirteen church vestments,\r\neighty-one mounted textiles, twenty rugs and eleven tapestries. It was\r\nsuppertime when we finished. As the ten cases of weapons hadn’t arrived,\r\nwe decided to wait till morning and load everything at once.\r\n\r\nThat evening Major Anderson of the 101st Airborne came over with the\r\nofficial receipt which I was to sign. It was an elaborate document\r\ncomprising Sergeant Peck’s seventy-page inventory and a covering letter\r\nfrom the C.O. of the 101st Airborne Division to the Commanding General of\r\nthe Third Army stating that I had received from Major Anderson the entire\r\nGöring collection for delivery to the Central Collecting Point at Munich.\r\nHaving discharged his responsibility, the major was free to go home to\r\nthe U.S.A. That called for a celebration and he had brought a bottle\r\nof cognac. It was sixty years old. He said that it came from Hitler’s\r\nprivate stock at the Berghof. Even Steve, who had harbored a slight\r\ngrudge toward Anderson since the night of our arrival in Berchtesgaden,\r\nrelented and the four of us toasted the successful evacuation of the\r\nGöring treasures.\r\n\r\nThe major had another surprise for us: he had engaged a room at the\r\nBerchtesgadener Hof. He insisted that the three of us move over from the\r\nrest house. The next day was Sunday. What would be the point of going up\r\nto Munich? We had been working hard for two weeks. Why not take life easy\r\nfor a day or two?\r\n\r\nThe Berchtesgadener Hof was a luxurious resort hotel. Its appointments\r\nwere modern and lavish. In the days of the Nazi regime, it had been\r\npatronized by all visiting dignitaries, save the chosen few who had been\r\ninvited to stay at the Berghof or the small hotel at Obersalzberg. It\r\nwas now being used by the Army as a “leave hotel.” We had an enormous\r\ndouble room with twin beds and a couch. We had our own private terrace.\r\nThe room faced south with a wonderful view of the mountains. We even had\r\na telephone which worked. I hadn’t seen such magnificence since the Royal\r\nMonceau in Paris. There was a room for our driver on the top floor. The\r\nfinal de luxe touch was the schedule of meal hours; breakfast wasn’t even\r\nserved until eight-thirty. It was hard to believe that we were in Germany.\r\n\r\nWe were awakened early by a call from Major Miller. He had another job\r\nfor me—two, in fact. They had been interrogating Görnnert and he had told\r\nthem that several pieces of valuable sculpture had been buried in the\r\ngrounds of his house. The major had located the spot and the things were\r\nto be excavated before noon. Also he wanted me to go with him to inspect\r\na cache of pictures reported hidden in a forester’s house not far from\r\nBerchtesgaden. I said I’d be ready in an hour.\r\n\r\nThe phone rang again. This time it was Captain Posey. Had we remembered\r\nto pick up the pictures at St. Agatha? The ones Mussolini had given to\r\nHitler? No, we hadn’t. We were to be sure to attend to that before we\r\nreturned to Munich. Steve was cursing these early callers and Lamont was\r\nshaking his head sadly. Our life of ease was getting off to a hell of a\r\npoor start.\r\n\r\nWhen Major Miller and I reached the Görnnert place, the Sergeant of the\r\nGuard and one of his men were standing beside a hole in the ground some\r\ntwenty yards behind the house. The hole was about six feet square and\r\nfour feet deep. Four bundles wrapped in discolored newspaper lay on the\r\nground at the edge of the excavation. The first bundle I opened contained\r\na wood statue of the Madonna and Child, about eighteen inches high. It\r\nhad been an attractive example of the fifteenth century French school,\r\nbut moisture had seriously damaged the original polychromy and the wood\r\nbeneath was soft and pulpy. The next two bundles contained pieces of\r\nsimilar workmanship, but they were not polychromed. One was a Madonna and\r\nChild; the other a figure of St. Barbara. Although they were damp, the\r\nwood had not disintegrated. The fourth package contained the prize of the\r\nlot, an ivory figure of the Madonna and Child. It was a fine piece from\r\nthe hand of a French sculptor of the late fourteenth century. The ivory\r\nwas discolored but otherwise in good condition. I wrapped the statues in\r\nfresh paper and put them in the car.\r\n\r\nOur next objective was the little village of Hintersee, a few kilometers\r\nwest of Berchtesgaden. The forester’s house, a large chalet with\r\noverhanging eaves, stood at the edge of a meadow several hundred yards\r\nfrom the road. I explained the purpose of our visit to the young woman\r\nin peasant dress who answered our knock. She took us to a room on the\r\nsecond floor which was filled with unframed canvases stacked in neat\r\nrows along the walls. They were the work of contemporary German painters\r\nand, according to the young woman, had been the property of the local\r\nNazi organization. From my point of view, the trip had been a waste of\r\ntime. There wasn’t a looted picture in the lot. While I looked at the\r\npaintings, Major Miller thumbed through a pile of books on a big table\r\nin one corner of the room. Among them he found a volume called _Die\r\nPolnische Grausamkeit_—_The Polish Atrocity_. A characteristic sample\r\nof German propaganda, it was a compilation of “horror photographs”\r\nillustrating the alleged inhuman treatment of Germans by the Poles. It\r\nadded a gruesome touch to our visit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Removal of treasures from the castle of Neuschwanstein was\r\ncompleted by Captain Adams and Captain de Brye.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Neuschwanstein—Ludwig II’s fantastic castle in which the\r\nNazis stored looted art treasures from France.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Neuschwanstein.

Typical storage room in the castle. In\r\nadjoining room Lieutenants Howe, Moore and Kovalyak packed 2,000 pieces\r\nof gold and silver looted from M. David-Weill.]\r\n\r\nWhen I got back to the hotel at noon I found messages from Steve and\r\nLamont. Steve had gone over to Unterstein to see about the repairs on\r\nhis Steyr truck, the one he and Kress had spent so much time on—fitting\r\nit up as a mobile photographic unit. There was also some work to be done\r\non the Mercedes-Benz, which had been standing idle, concealed behind a\r\nclump of bushes by the rest house, during our evacuation of the Göring\r\ncollection. Steve had been right about the car; Colonel Davitt at Alt\r\nAussee had not pressed his claim to it.\r\n\r\nLamont had taken off for St. Agatha in a truck borrowed from Brigade\r\nHeadquarters to pick up the Hitler-Mussolini pictures.\r\n\r\nThere was also a message brought down by courier from Captain Posey’s\r\noffice. It contained a list of three places in the vicinity of\r\nBerchtesgaden which should be inspected on the chance that they contained\r\nitems from the Göring collection. One of them was the forester’s hut\r\nat Hintersee which I had just seen. The other two were castles in\r\nthe neighborhood: Schloss Stauffeneck-Tiereck and Schloss Marzoll. I\r\nasked Major Anderson at lunch what he knew about them. He had nothing\r\nto contribute on the subject and said I’d probably draw a blank on\r\nall three. After removing the Göring things from the train, he had\r\ntaken the precaution of publishing a notice to all residents of the\r\narea instructing them to declare all art works in their possession.\r\nHe had done this as a means of recovering objects which might have\r\nbeen sequestered by Göring’s agents and objects which might have been\r\nsurreptitiously removed from the train while it stood on the siding.\r\nThe results had been disappointing. Only about thirty pictures had been\r\nturned in and none of them was in any way connected with Göring.\r\n\r\nThe major’s prediction was correct. Lamont, Steve and I visited the two\r\ncastles the next day. In addition to their own furnishings, Schloss\r\nStauffeneck-Tiereck and Schloss Marzoll contained only books from the\r\nUniversity of Munich. These fruitless researches took all day. It was\r\nafter five when we left Berchtesgaden.\r\n\r\nIt was raining when we reached Munich three hours later. Kress had no\r\nplace to stay and it took us an hour to locate a civilian agency which\r\nprovided billets for transients. The only thing they had to offer was a\r\nroom for one night in a ruined nunnery on the Mathilde-Strasse. It was a\r\ngloomy place. There was no light and the windows were without glass. One\r\nof the Sisters, candle in hand, led us along a dark corridor to a small\r\nsingle room at the back. We followed with our flashlights. We gave Kress\r\na box of K rations and told him we’d come back for him in the morning.\r\nSteve was of two minds about the place: on the one hand it wasn’t good\r\nenough for Kress; on the other he was impressed by the compassion of\r\nthe Sisters in offering refuge to strangers. He wanted me to point out\r\nto Kress the anomaly of his being given sanctuary by the Church. I\r\nconvinced him that my German wasn’t fluent enough. We thanked the Sister\r\nand went off to find ourselves a billet. We decided on the Excelsior,\r\nthe hotel for transient officers. We were several miles from Third Army\r\nHeadquarters, whereas the hotel was only a few blocks away.\r\n\r\nI didn’t like driving the Mercedes-Benz around Munich, even though I had\r\ngot away with it so far. The Third Army regulation forbidding officers\r\nto drive was strictly enforced. Perhaps my uniform baffled the MPs.\r\nIt consisted of a Navy cap with blue cover, a British battle jacket\r\nwith Navy shoulder boards, khaki trousers and black riding boots. It\r\nwas my personal opinion that the MPs mistook the shoulder bars for the\r\ninsignia of a Polish officer. The Poles, and the other liaison officers\r\nas well, were allowed to drive their own cars. Steve used to pooh-pooh\r\nmy apprehensions about the MPs. “They’re a bunch of dumbheads,” he would\r\nsay. “I ought to know. I used to be one.” All the same, he didn’t do much\r\ndaytime driving around town.\r\n\r\nCaptain Posey had our next job lined up for us. We were to evacuate\r\nthe records of the _Einsatzstab Rosenberg_—the German art-looting\r\norganization—from Neuschwanstein Castle. The job would include the\r\nremoval of part of the stolen art treasures also. The captain told us\r\nthat the castle contained a great quantity of uncrated objects, mostly\r\ngold and silver. They presented a serious security problem and it wasn’t\r\nsafe to leave them there indefinitely. Even though the French were\r\nanxious to get everything back from Neuschwanstein, for the present they\r\nwould have to be content with the gold and the silver objects and as many\r\nof the smaller cases as we could handle. It would be more practicable\r\nto ship the larger things—furniture, sculpture and pictures—direct to\r\nFrance by rail. This possibility was being investigated. It would save\r\nmoving the things twice—first from Neuschwanstein to Munich, and then\r\nfrom Munich to Paris. But the records were badly needed at the Collecting\r\nPoint in connection with the identification of the plunder stored there.\r\nSo we were to concentrate on them and on the objects of great intrinsic\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nIt was going to take three or four days to line up the trucks necessary\r\nfor this operation. There was a critical shortage of transportation\r\nat the moment because all available vehicles were being used to haul\r\nfirewood. This was popularly known as “Patton’s pet project.” For some\r\nweeks it had first priority after foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nWe welcomed the delay, for it gave us time to make a trip to Frankfurt.\r\nAll three of us had urgent business to attend to there. Lamont’s and\r\nSteve’s records had to be straightened out. Both of them had been\r\nworking in the field for so long that the headquarters to which they\r\nwere technically assigned had lost track of them. And I wanted to find\r\nout what had happened to the personal belongings I had left in Frankfurt\r\nmonths ago. When I left I had expected to be gone ten days.\r\n\r\nIn the back of our minds, too, lurked the hope of becoming “incorporated”\r\nas a Special Evacuation Team. That’s what we were in fact, but we wanted\r\nto be recognized as such in name. The three of us worked well together\r\nand did not want to be separated. The decision would rest with Major La\r\nFarge and Lieutenant Kuhn.\r\n\r\nWe wheedled a command car out of the sergeant at the motor pool and took\r\noff late in the afternoon. Lamont, Steve and I rode in the Mercedes-Benz,\r\nthe command car following. I had little confidence in our rakish\r\nconvertible. The car had been behaving well enough mechanically, but the\r\ntires were paper-thin. They were an odd size and we had not been able to\r\nget any replacements. It was reassuring to know that the sturdy command\r\ncar was trailing along behind.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Ulm in time for supper. Long before we reached the city,\r\nwe could see the soaring single spire of the cathedral silhouetted\r\nagainst the sky. There was literally nothing left of the old city. All\r\nthe medieval houses which, with the cathedral, had made it one of the\r\nmost picturesque cities in Germany, lay in ruins. But the cathedral was\r\nundamaged.\r\n\r\nWe stopped for gas just outside Ulm. To our surprise, the Army attendant\r\nfilled our tanks. This was Seventh Army territory. In Third Army area the\r\nmaximum was five gallons. I mentioned this to the attendant. He said,\r\n“There’s no gas shortage here. General Patton must be building up one\r\nhell of a big stockpile.”\r\n\r\nWe spent the night in Stuttgart. As the main transient hotel was full, we\r\nwere assigned rooms at a small inn on the outskirts of the battered city.\r\nIt took us an hour to find the place, so it was past midnight when we\r\nturned in.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we detoured a few kilometers in order to visit the\r\ncastle at Ludwigsburg. The little town was laid out in the French manner,\r\nand its atmosphere was that of a miniature Versailles. The caretaker told\r\nus that the kings of Württemberg had lived at the castle until 1918. Our\r\nvisit to it was the one pleasant experience of the day, which happened\r\nto be my birthday. We had our first flat tire in the castle courtyard, a\r\nsecond one an hour later, and a third between Mannheim and Darmstadt. It\r\nwas Sunday and we had a devilish time finding places where we could get\r\nthe inner tubes repaired. It was ten P.M. when we pulled into Frankfurt.\r\nThe trip from Stuttgart had taken eleven hours instead of the usual four.\r\nWe had spent seven hours on tire repairs.\r\n\r\nMy old room with the pink brocaded furniture was vacant, so I moved in\r\nfor the night. In my absence it had been successively occupied by three\r\nlieutenant colonels. All of my belongings had been boxed and stored away\r\nin the closet. Lamont and Steve put up at the house next door.\r\n\r\nWe called on Bancel La Farge and Charlie Kuhn at USFET Headquarters\r\nthe next morning. We were lucky to find them together. Their office at\r\nthat time was a kind of house divided against itself. Thanks to the\r\norganizational whim of a colonel, Bancel and Charlie had to spend part of\r\nthe day in the office at the big Farben building—where we found them—and\r\npart at their office in Höchst. Höchst was about six miles away. The\r\nremnant of the U. S. Group Control Council, which had not yet moved up\r\nto Berlin, was located there—in another vast complex of I. G. Farben\r\nbuildings. It was an exhausting arrangement.\r\n\r\nBancel and Charlie looked tired—and worried too. They seemed glad to\r\nsee us, but they were preoccupied and upset about something. Presently\r\nCharlie showed us a document which had just reached his desk a few days\r\nearlier. It was unsigned and undated.\r\n\r\nIt bore the letterhead “Headquarters U. S. Group Control Council.” The\r\nsubject was “Art Objects in the U. S. Zone.”[2] In the first paragraph\r\nreference was made to the great number and value of the art objects\r\nstored in emergency repositories throughout the U. S. Zone. Farther on,\r\nthe art objects were divided into three classes, according to ownership.\r\n\r\nThose in “Class C” were defined as “works of art, placed in the U. S.\r\nZone by Germany for safekeeping, which are the bona fide property of the\r\nGerman nation.”\r\n\r\nConcerning the disposition of the works of art thus described, the letter\r\nhad this to say: “It is not believed that the U. S. would desire the\r\nworks of art in Class C to be made available for reparations and to be\r\ndivided among a number of nations. Even if this is to be done, these\r\nworks of art might well be returned to the U. S. to be inventoried, and\r\ncared for by our leading museums.”\r\n\r\nThe next, and last, sentence contained this extraordinary proposal: “They\r\ncould be held in trusteeship for return, many years from now, to the\r\nGerman people if and when the German nation had earned the right to their\r\nreturn.”\r\n\r\nClipped to the document was a notation, dated July 29, 1945, bearing\r\nthe signature of the Chief of Staff of General Lucius D. Clay, Deputy\r\nMilitary Governor. It read, in part, “General Clay states that this paper\r\nhas been approved by the President for implementation after the close of\r\nthe current Big 3 Conference.”\r\n\r\nWe were dumfounded. No wonder Bancel and Charlie were worried. It had\r\nnever occurred to any of us that German national art treasures would\r\nbe removed to the United States. After speculating on the possible\r\nconsequences attendant on an implementation of the document, we dropped\r\nthe subject. Momentarily there was nothing to do but wait—and hope that\r\nthe whole matter would be dropped.\r\n\r\nBy comparison, our personal problems seemed insignificant. But Charlie\r\nand Bancel heard us out. They approved our idea of remaining together as\r\na team working out of USFET. I was already permanently assigned to USFET\r\nand there were two vacancies on their T.O. (Table of Organization) to\r\nwhich Lamont and Steve could be appointed. The necessary “paper work”\r\ntook up most of the day and involved a trip to ECAD headquarters at Bad\r\nHomburg. At five o’clock we had our new orders.\r\n\r\nSteve suggested that we drive up to Marburg to see Captain Hancock, the\r\nMonuments officer in charge of the two great art repositories which had\r\nbeen established there. They were the prototype of the Central Collecting\r\nPoint at Munich. However, they differed in an important respect from the\r\none at Munich: they contained practically no loot. Virtually everything\r\nin them belonged to German museums and had been recovered by our\r\nMonuments officers from the mines in which the Germans had placed them\r\nfor safekeeping during the war.\r\n\r\nMarburg, some fifty miles north of Frankfurt, lay in the\r\nRegierungsbezirk, or government district, of Kassel, which was in turn\r\na subdivision of the Province of Hesse. It was a two-hour drive, but we\r\nstopped en route for supper with a Quartermaster outfit at Giessen, so it\r\nwas nearly eight o’clock when we arrived.\r\n\r\nWe found Walker Hancock in his office in the Staatsarchiv building. He\r\nwas a man in the middle forties, and of medium height. His face broke\r\ninto a smile and his fine dark eyes lighted up with an expression of\r\ngenuine pleasure at the sight of Lamont and Steve. This was the first\r\ntime they had seen one another since the close of the war when they\r\nhad been working together in Weimar. I had never met Walker Hancock,\r\nbut I had heard more about him than about any other American Monuments\r\nofficer. I knew that he had had a distinguished career as a sculptor\r\nbefore the war and that he had been the first of our Monuments officers\r\nto reach France. He had been attached to the First Army until the end of\r\nhostilities. Lamont was devoted to Walker, and Steve’s regard for him\r\nbordered on worship. While the three of them reminisced, I found myself\r\nresponding to his warmth and sincerity.\r\n\r\nHe wouldn’t hear of our returning to Frankfurt that night. He wanted\r\nto show us the things in his two depots and we wouldn’t be able to see\r\nmore than a fraction of them before morning. The few that we did see\r\nwhetted our appetite for more. In the galleries on the second floor\r\nwe saw some of the finest pictures from the museums of the Rhineland:\r\nthere were three wonderful Van Goghs. One was the portrait of Armand\r\nRollin, the young man with a mustache and slouch hat. It belonged to the\r\nVolkwang Museum at Essen. Color reproductions of this portrait had, in\r\nrecent years, rivaled those of Whistler’s _Mother_ in popularity. Walker\r\nsaid that it had been covered with mold when he found it in the Siegen\r\nmine with the rest of the Essen pictures. His assistant, Sheldon Keck,\r\nformerly the restorer of the Brooklyn Museum, had successfully removed\r\nthe mold before it had done any serious damage.\r\n\r\nThe second Van Gogh was the famous large still life entitled _White\r\nRoses_. The third was a brilliant late landscape. There were other\r\nmagnificent nineteenth century canvases: the bewitching portrait\r\nof M. and Mme. Sisley by Renoir, a full-length Manet, and a great\r\nDaumier. Walker climaxed the display with the celebrated Rembrandt\r\n_Self-Portrait_ from the Wallraf-Richartz Museum of Cologne. This was the\r\nlast and most famous of the portraits the artist painted of himself.\r\n\r\nWe spent the night at the Gasthaus Sonne, a seventeenth century inn\r\nfacing the old market place. The proprietor reluctantly assigned us two\r\nrooms on the second floor. They were normally reserved for the top brass.\r\nJudging from the austerity of the furnishings and the simplicity of the\r\nplumbing, I thought it unlikely that we would be routed from our beds by\r\nany late-arriving generals.\r\n\r\nWalker met us for breakfast the next morning with word that the war\r\nwith Japan had ended. Announcements in German had already been posted\r\nin several of the shop windows. Though thrilling to us, the news seemed\r\nto make very little impression on the citizens of the sleepy university\r\ntown. The people in the streets were as unsmiling as ever. If anything,\r\nsome of them looked a little grimmer than usual.\r\n\r\nWe drove to the Staatsarchiv building with Walker. He took us to a room\r\ncontaining a fabulous collection of medieval art objects. There were\r\ncrosses and croziers, coffers and chalices, wrought in precious metals\r\nand studded with jewels—masterpieces of the tenth, eleventh and twelfth\r\ncenturies. The most arresting individual piece was the golden Madonna,\r\nan archaic seated figure two feet high, dating from the tenth century.\r\nThese marvelous relics of the Middle Ages belonged to the Cathedral of\r\nMetz. It was one of the greatest collections of its kind in the entire\r\nworld. Its intrinsic value was enormous; its historic value incalculable.\r\nWalker said that arrangements were being made for its early return to the\r\ncathedral. The French were planning an elaborate ceremony in honor of the\r\nevent.\r\n\r\nIt was a five-minute drive to the other depot under Captain Hancock’s\r\ndirection. This was the Jubiläumsbau, or Jubilee Building, a handsome\r\nstructure of pre-Nazi, modern design. It was the headquarters of the\r\narchaeological institute headed by Professor Richard Hamann, the\r\ninternationally famous medieval scholar. It also housed the archives of\r\n“Photo Marburg,” the stupendous library of art photographs founded and\r\ndirected by the professor. Walker was putting the resources of Photo\r\nMarburg to good use, compiling a complete photographic record of the\r\nobjects in his care.\r\n\r\nAmong the treasures stored in the Jubiläumsbau were some of the choicest\r\nmasterpieces from the Berlin state museums. Perhaps the most famous were\r\nthe twin canvases by Watteau entitled _Gersaint’s Signboard_. Regarded\r\nby many as the supreme work of the greatest painter of the French Rococo\r\nperiod, the two pictures had been the prized possessions of Frederick the\r\nGreat. Painted to hang side by side forming a continuous composition,\r\nthey represented the shop of M. Gersaint, dealer in works of art. It is\r\nsaid that the paintings were finished in eight days. They were painted\r\nin the year 1732 when the artist was at the height of his career. I was\r\ntold that, during the early years of the war, Göring made overtures to\r\nthe Louvre for one of its finest Watteaus. According to the story, the\r\nnegotiations ended abruptly when the museum signified its willingness to\r\npart with the painting in exchange for _Gersaint’s Signboard_.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant French school of the eighteenth century was further\r\nrepresented at the Jubiläumsbau by a superb Boucher—the subject, _Mercury\r\nand Venus_—and two exquisite Chardins: _The Cook_, one of his most\r\nenchanting scenes of everyday life, and the _Portrait of a Lady Sealing a\r\nLetter_, an unusually large composition for this unpretentious painter\r\nwhose canvases are today worth a king’s ransom.\r\n\r\nThere were masterpieces of the German school; the great series of\r\nCranachs which had belonged to the Hohenzollerns filled one entire room.\r\nExcellent examples of Rubens and Van Dyck represented the Flemish school;\r\nRuysdael and Van Goyen, the Dutch. The high quality of every picture\r\nattested to the taste and connoisseurship of German collectors.\r\n\r\nWalker said that he hoped to arrange a public exhibition of the pictures.\r\nMarburg had been neglected by our bombers. Only one or two bombs had\r\nfallen in the city and the resulting damage had been slight. Concussion\r\nhad blasted the windows of the Staatsarchiv, but the Jubiläumsbau was\r\nuntouched. Perhaps he would put on a series of small exhibitions, say\r\nfifty pictures at a time. The members of his local German committee\r\nwere enthusiastic about the project. It would be an important first\r\nstep in the rehabilitation of German cultural institutions which\r\nwas an avowed part of the American Fine Arts program. Thanks to the\r\nhesitancy of an officer at higher headquarters who was exasperatingly\r\n“security-conscious,” Walker did not realize his ambition until three\r\nmonths later, on the eve of his departure for the United States.\r\n\r\nWe celebrated VJ-Day on our return to Frankfurt that evening. The big\r\nCasino, behind USFET headquarters, was the scene of the principal\r\nfestivities. Drinks were on the house until the bar closed at ten. It\r\nwas a warm summer night and the broad terrace over the main entrance was\r\ncrowded. An Army band blared noisily inside. Civilian attendants skulked\r\nin the background, avidly collecting cigarette butts from the ash trays\r\nand the terrace floor. They reaped a rich harvest that night.\r\n\r\nThe Mercedes-Benz presented a problem. Its status was a dubious one.\r\nSince it was still registered with an MG Detachment in Austria, I\r\nfelt uncomfortable about driving it around Germany. At Charlie Kuhn’s\r\nsuggestion we filed a request with the Naval headquarters in Frankfurt\r\nfor assignment of the vehicle to our Special Evacuation Team. The request\r\nwas couched in impressive legal language which Charlie thought would do\r\nthe trick. Armed with a copy of this request, I felt confident that we\r\nwould not be molested by inquisitive MPs on our trip back to Munich.\r\n\r\nWe didn’t get started until late afternoon, having wasted two hours\r\ndickering with the Transportation Officer at the Frankfurt MG Detachment\r\nfor a spare tire. We returned by way of Würzburg and Nürnberg. It was\r\ndark when we reached Nürnberg, but the light of the full moon was\r\nsufficient to reveal the ruined walls and towers of the old, inner city.\r\nAs we struck south of the city to the Autobahn, we could see the outlines\r\nof the vast unfinished stadium, designed to seat one hundred and forty\r\nthousand people. We had to proceed cautiously since many of the bridges\r\nhad been destroyed and detours were frequent. As a result it was midnight\r\nwhen we reached Munich. The transient hotel was full, so we had to be\r\ncontent with makeshift quarters at the Central Collecting Point.\r\n\r\nIn our absence the transportation situation had eased up a little.\r\nCaptain Posey told us the next morning that six trucks would be available\r\nin the early afternoon. We decided to keep the command car for the trip\r\nto Neuschwanstein and leave the Mercedes-Benz in Munich to be painted. In\r\nanticipation of registration papers from the Navy, we thought it would be\r\nappropriate to have the car painted battleship gray and stenciled with\r\nwhite letters reading “U. S. Navy.” One of the mechanics in the garage\r\nat the Central Collecting Point agreed to do this for us in exchange for\r\na bottle of rum and half a bottle of Scotch. Officers at Third Army\r\nHeadquarters had bar privileges plus a liquor ration, but the enlisted\r\nmen didn’t fare so well.\r\n\r\nOur base of operations for the evacuation of the Castle of Neuschwanstein\r\nwas the picturesque little town of Füssen, some eighty miles south of\r\nMunich, in the heart of the “Swan country.” This region of southern\r\nBavaria, celebrated for its association with the name of Richard Wagner,\r\nis one of the most beautiful in all Germany. The mountains rise sharply\r\nfrom the floor of the level green valley. The turreted castle, perched\r\non top of one of the lower peaks, at an elevation of a thousand feet,\r\nis visible for miles. Built in the eighteen-seventies by Ludwig II, the\r\n“Mad King” of Bavaria, it was the most fantastic creation of that exotic\r\nmonarch whose passion for building nearly bankrupted his kingdom. When we\r\nsaw the castle rising majestically from its pine-covered mountaintop, we\r\nwere struck by the incongruity of our six-truck convoy lumbering through\r\nthe romantic countryside.\r\n\r\nWe presented our credentials to a swarthy major who was the commanding\r\nofficer of the small MG Detachment at Füssen. He arranged for our billets\r\nat the Alte Post, the hotel where officers of the Detachment were\r\nquartered, and, after we had deposited our gear in a room on the fourth\r\nfloor, conducted us to the Schloss.\r\n\r\nThe steep road to the lower courtyard of the castle wound for more than\r\na mile up the side of the mountain. At the castle entrance, the major\r\nidentified us to the guard and our six trucks filed into the courtyard.\r\nIn the upper courtyard, reached by a broad flight of stone steps, we\r\nfound the caretaker who had the keys to the main section of the castle.\r\nHe did not, however, have access to the wing in which the records of the\r\n_Einsatzstab Rosenberg_ were stored. The only door to that part of the\r\nbuilding had been locked and sealed by Lieutenant James Rorimer, the\r\nMonuments officer of the Seventh Army, when the castle had first fallen\r\ninto American hands. We had brought the key with us from Third Army\r\nHeadquarters.\r\n\r\nBefore examining those rooms, we made a tour of the four main floors of\r\nthe castle. The hallways and vaulted kitchens on the first floor were\r\nfilled to overflowing with enormous packing cases and uncrated furniture,\r\nall taken from French collections. Three smaller storage rooms resembling\r\nthe stock rooms of Tiffany’s and a porcelain factory combined, were\r\njammed with gold and silver and rare china. Most of the loot had been\r\nconcentrated on the first floor, but the unfinished rooms of the second\r\nhad been fitted with racks for the storage of paintings. In addition to\r\nthe looted pictures, there were several galleries of stacked paintings\r\nfrom the museums of Munich. The living apartments on the third floor,\r\ndivested of their furnishings, were filled with stolen furniture, Louis\r\nQuinze chairs, table and sofas and ornate Italian cabinets lined the\r\nwalls of rooms and corridors. They contrasted strangely with scenes from\r\nthe Wagner operas which King Ludwig had chosen as the theme for the mural\r\ndecorations. Only the gold-walled Throne Room and, on the floor above,\r\nthe lofty Fest-Saal, were devoid of loot.\r\n\r\nWe proceeded to the wing of the castle which contained the records.\r\nHaving broken the seals and unlocked the door, we entered a hallway about\r\nthirty feet long. The doors opening onto this hallway were also locked\r\nand sealed. Behind them lay the offices of the _Einsatzstab Rosenberg_.\r\nThey were crowded with bookshelves and filing cabinets. In one room stood\r\na huge show-case filled with fragile Roman glass. The rooms of the second\r\nfloor were full of French furniture and dozens of small packing cases.\r\nThese cases were made of carefully finished quarter-sawed oak. We had\r\nseen similar ones in the Göring collection. They had been the traveling\r\ncases for precious objects belonging to the Rothschilds. These too\r\ncontained Rothschild treasures—exquisite bibelots of jade, agate, onyx\r\nand jasper, and innumerable pieces of Oriental and European porcelain.\r\n\r\nAt one end of the hallway were two rooms which had been used as a\r\nphotographic laboratory. We had brought Kress with us. Steve went off to\r\nmake arrangements to install his equipment, while Lamont and I calculated\r\nthe number of men we would need for the evacuation work the next morning.\r\nWe asked the major for twenty—two shifts of ten.\r\n\r\nThe Neuschwanstein operation lasted eight days. We worked nights as well,\r\nbecause there were thousands of small objects—many of them fragile and\r\nextremely valuable—which we could not trust to the inexpert hands of\r\nour work party. There was no electricity in the small storage rooms, so\r\nwe had to work by candlelight. It took us one evening to pack the Roman\r\nglass and the four succeeding evenings, working till midnight, to pack\r\nthe two thousand pieces of gold and silver in the David-Weill collection.\r\nThe Nazi looters had thoughtfully saved the well-made cases in which\r\nthey had carted off this magnificent collection from M. David-Weill’s\r\nhouse in Paris. There were candelabra, dishes, knives, forks, spoons,\r\nsnuffboxes—the rarest examples of the art of the French goldsmiths of\r\nthe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. This unique collection had\r\ncreated a sensation when it was exhibited in Paris a few years before\r\nthe war. The fact that the incomparable assemblage would probably one\r\nday be left to the Louvre by the eminent connoisseur, who had spent a\r\nlifetime collecting it, had not deterred the Nazi robbers. He was a Jew.\r\nThat justified its confiscation. Aside from the pleasure it gave me to\r\nhandle the beautiful objects, I relished the idea of helping to recover\r\nthe property of a fellow Californian: M. David-Weill had been born in\r\nSan Francisco. The Nazis had been methodical as usual. Every piece was\r\nto have been systematically recatalogued while the collection was at\r\nNeuschwanstein. On some of the shelves we found slips of paper stating\r\nthat this or that object had not yet been photographed—“_noch nicht\r\nfotografiert_.”\r\n\r\nThe tedious manual labor involved in packing small objects and the great\r\ndistance which the packed cases had to be carried when ready for loading\r\nwere the chief difficulties at Neuschwanstein. Not only did the cases\r\nhave to be carried several hundred feet from the storage rooms to the\r\ndoor of the castle; but from the door to the trucks was a long trek, down\r\ntwo flights of steps and across a wide courtyard. In this respect the\r\noperation resembled the evacuation of the monastery at Hohenfurth.\r\n\r\nThree months after our partial evacuation of the castle, a team composed\r\nof Captain Edward Adams, Lieutenant (jg) Charles Parkhurst, USNR, and\r\nCaptain Hubert de Brye, a French officer, completed the removal of the\r\nloot. This gigantic undertaking required eight weeks. If I remember the\r\nfigures correctly, more than twelve thousand objects were boxed and\r\ncarted away. The cases were built in a carpenter shop set up in the\r\ncastle kitchens. One hundred and fifty truckloads were delivered to the\r\nrailroad siding at Füssen and thence transported to Paris. It was an\r\nextraordinary achievement, carried out despite heavy snowfall. The only\r\noperation which rivaled it was the evacuation of the salt mine at Alt\r\nAussee.\r\n\r\nThe last morning of our stay at Füssen, Lamont and I had a special\r\nmission to perform. A German art dealer named Gustav Rochlitz was living\r\nat Gipsmühle, a five-minute drive from Hohenschwangau, the small village\r\nbelow the castle. For a number of years Rochlitz had had a gallery in\r\nParis. His dealings with the Nazis, in particular his trafficking in\r\nconfiscated pictures, had been the subject of special investigation\r\nby Lieutenants Plaut and Rousseau, our OSS friends. They were the two\r\nAmerican naval officers who were preparing an exhaustive report on the\r\nactivities of the infamous _Einsatzstab Rosenberg_. They had interrogated\r\nRochlitz and placed him under house arrest. In his possession were\r\ntwenty-two modern French paintings, including works by Dérain, Matisse\r\nand Picasso, formerly belonging to well known Jewish collections. He had\r\nobtained them from Göring and other leading Nazis in exchange for old\r\nmaster paintings. We were to relieve Herr Rochlitz of these canvases.\r\n\r\nAt the farmhouse in which Rochlitz and his wife were living, the maid\r\nof all work who answered our knock said that no one was at home. Herr\r\nRochlitz would not be back before noon. Lamont and I returned to our jeep\r\nand started back across the fields to the highway. We had driven about\r\na hundred yards when we saw a heavy-set sullen-faced man of about fifty\r\nwalking toward us.\r\n\r\n“I’ll bet that’s Rochlitz,” I said to Lamont. Stopping the car, I called\r\nout to him, “Herr Rochlitz?”\r\n\r\nAfter a moment’s hesitation, he nodded.\r\n\r\n“Hop in, we want to have a talk with you,” I said.\r\n\r\nWe returned to the farmhouse and followed our truculent host up the\r\nstairs to a sitting room on the second floor. There we were joined by his\r\nwife, a timid young woman who, like her husband, spoke fluent English.\r\n\r\nI said that we had come for the pictures. Rochlitz made no protest. He\r\nbrusquely directed his wife to bring them in. As she left the room, I\r\nthought it odd that he hadn’t gone along to help her. But she returned\r\nalmost immediately with the paintings in her arms. All twenty-two were\r\nrolled around a long mailing tube. Together they spread the canvases\r\nabout the room, on the table, on the chairs and on the floor. They were,\r\nwithout exception, works of excellent quality. One large early Picasso,\r\nthe portrait of a woman and child, was alone worth a small fortune.\r\n\r\nI was wondering what Rochlitz had given in exchange for the lot, when he\r\nbegan to explain how the pictures had come into his possession. He must\r\nhave taken us for credulous fools, because the story he told made him out\r\na victim of tragic circumstance. He said that Göring had made an offer on\r\nseveral of his pictures. Rochlitz had accepted but insisted on being paid\r\nin cash. Göring had agreed to the terms and the pictures were delivered.\r\nThen, instead of paying in cash, Göring had forced him to accept these\r\nmodern paintings. He had protested, but to no avail. Of course these\r\npictures were all right in their way, he said deprecatingly, but he was\r\nnot a dealer in modern art. Naturally he did not know that they had been\r\nconfiscated. It was all a dreadful mistake, but what could he do? I said\r\nthat I realized how badly he must have felt and that I knew he would be\r\nrelieved to learn that the pictures were now going back to their rightful\r\nowners.\r\n\r\nThe pictures were carefully rerolled and we got up to leave. At the door,\r\nRochlitz told us that he had lost his entire stock. He had stored all of\r\nhis paintings at Baden-Baden, in the French Zone. Did we think he would\r\nbe able to recover them? We assured him that justice would be done and,\r\nleaving him to interpret that remark as he saw fit, drove off with the\r\ntwenty-two pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(9)\r\n\r\n_HIDDEN TREASURES AT NÜRNBERG_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn our return to Munich that evening, Craig told us that preparations\r\nwere being made for the immediate restitution of several important\r\nmasterpieces recovered in the American Zone. General Eisenhower had\r\napproved a proposal to return at once to each of the countries overrun\r\nby the Germans at least one outstanding work of art. This was to be done\r\nin his name, as a gesture of “token restitution” symbolizing American\r\npolicy with regard to ultimate restitution of all stolen art treasures to\r\nthe rightful owner nations. It was felt that the gracious gesture on the\r\npart of the Commanding General of United States Forces in Europe would\r\nserve to reaffirm our intentions to right the wrongs of Nazi oppression.\r\nIn view of the vast amount of art which had thus far been recovered,\r\nit would be months before it could all be restored to the plundered\r\ncountries. Meanwhile these “token restitutions” would be an earnest of\r\nAmerican good will. They would be sent back from Germany at the expense\r\nof the United States Government. Thereafter, representatives of the\r\nvarious countries would be invited to come to our Collecting Points to\r\nselect, assemble and, in transportation of their own providing, remove\r\nthose objects which the Germans had stolen.\r\n\r\nBelgium was to receive the first token restitution. The great van Eyck\r\naltarpiece—_The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb_—was the obvious choice\r\namong the stolen Belgian treasures.\r\n\r\nThe famous panels had been reposing in the Central Collecting Point at\r\nMunich since we had removed them from the salt mine at Alt Aussee. A\r\nspecial plane had been chartered to fly them to Brussels. The Belgian\r\nGovernment had signified approval of air transportation. Direct rail\r\ncommunication between Munich and Brussels had not been resumed, and the\r\nhighways were not in the best of condition. By truck, it would be a rough\r\ntwo-day trip; by air, a matter of three hours.\r\n\r\nBancel La Farge had already flown from Frankfurt to Brussels, where\r\nplans had been made for an appropriate ceremony on the arrival of the\r\naltarpiece. The American Ambassador was to present the panels to the\r\nPrince Regent on behalf of General Eisenhower. It was to be an historic\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nI went out to the airport to confirm the arrangements for the C-54. It\r\nwas only a fifteen-minute drive from the Königsplatz to the field. I was\r\nalso to check on the condition of the streets: they were in good shape\r\nall the way.\r\n\r\nThe plane was to take off at noon. Lamont, Steve and I supervised the\r\nloading of the ten precious cases. We led off in a jeep. The truck\r\nfollowed with the panels. Four of the civilian packers went along to load\r\nthe cases onto the plane. Captain Posey was to escort the altarpiece to\r\nBrussels.\r\n\r\nWhen we got to the airport we learned that the plane had not arrived.\r\nThere would be a two-hour delay. At the end of two hours, we were\r\ninformed that there was bad weather south of Brussels. All flights\r\nhad been canceled for the day. We drove back to the Collecting Point\r\nat the Königsplatz and had just finished unloading the panels when a\r\nmessage came from the field. The weather had cleared. The plane would\r\nbe taking off in half an hour. I caught Captain Posey as he was leaving\r\nthe building for his office at Third Army Headquarters. The cases were\r\nreloaded and we were on our way to the field in fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nThe truck was driven onto the field where the big C-54 stood waiting. In\r\nanother quarter of an hour the panels were aboard and lashed securely\r\nto metal supports in the forepart of the passenger compartment. Captain\r\nPosey, the only passenger, waved jauntily as the doors swung shut.\r\nEnviously we watched the giant plane roll down the field, lift waveringly\r\nfrom the airstrip and swing off to the northwest. The altarpiece was on\r\nthe last lap of an extraordinary journey. We wished George Stout could\r\nhave been in on this.\r\n\r\nThe plane reached Brussels without mishap. The return of the great\r\nnational treasure was celebrated throughout the country. Encouraged by\r\nthe success of this first “token restitution,” Major La Farge directed\r\nthat a similar gesture be made to France. At the Collecting Point Craig\r\nselected seventy-one masterpieces looted from French private collections.\r\nThe group included Fragonard, Chardin, Lancret, Rubens, Van Dyck, Hals,\r\nand a large number of seventeenth century Dutch masters. Only examples of\r\nthe highest quality were chosen.\r\n\r\nHam Coulter, the naval officer who worked with Craig at the “Bau,”\r\nwas the emissary appointed to accompany the paintings to Paris. It\r\nwas decided to return them by truck, inasmuch as it would have been\r\nimpracticable to attempt shipping uncrated pictures by air. The convoy\r\nconsisted of two trucks—one for the pictures, the other for extra\r\ngasoline. It was a hard two-day trip from Munich to Paris. Ham got\r\nthrough safely, but reported on his return that the roads had been\r\nextremely rough a good part of the way. He had delivered the pictures in\r\nParis to the Musée du Jeu de Paume, the little museum which the Germans\r\nhad used during the Occupation as the clearinghouse for their methodical\r\nplundering of the Jewish collections. His expedition had been marred by\r\nonly one minor incident. When the paintings were being unloaded at the\r\nmuseum, one of the women attendants watching the operation noticed that\r\nsome of the canvases were unframed. She had asked, “And where are the\r\nframes?” This was too much for Coulter. In perfect French, the courteous\r\nlieutenant told her precisely what she could do about the frames.\r\n\r\nShortly after the return of the Ghent altarpiece, Captain Posey was\r\ndemobilized. His duties as MFA&A Officer at Third Army Headquarters in\r\nMunich were assumed by Captain Edwin Rae. I had not seen Rae since the\r\nearly summer when he and Lieutenant Edith Standen had been assigned to\r\nassist me in inventorying the collections of the Berlin museums in the\r\nvaults of the Reichsbank at Frankfurt. Edwin was a meticulous fellow,\r\ngentle but determined. Although by no means lacking in a sense of humor,\r\nhe resented joking references to a fancied resemblance to Houdon’s well\r\nknown portrait of Voltaire, and I didn’t blame him.\r\n\r\nHe took on his new responsibilities with quiet assurance and in a\r\nshort time won the complete confidence of his superiors at Third Army\r\nHeadquarters. Throughout his long tenure of office, he maintained an\r\nunruffled calm in the face of obstacles which would have exhausted a\r\nless patient man. He was responsible for all matters pertaining to the\r\nFine Arts in the Eastern Military District of the American Zone—that is,\r\nBavaria—an area more than twice the size of the two provinces Greater\r\nHesse and Württemberg-Baden comprising the Western Military District of\r\nour Zone.\r\n\r\nDuring the early days of Captain Rae’s regime, Charlie Kuhn paid a\r\nbrief visit to Munich. He had just completed the transfer of the Berlin\r\nMuseum collections from Frankfurt to the Landesmuseum at Wiesbaden.\r\nThe university buildings in Frankfurt—which I had requisitioned for a\r\nCollecting Point—had proved unsuitable. The repairs, he said, would have\r\ntaken months. On the other hand, the Wiesbaden Museum, though damaged,\r\nwas ideal for the purpose. Of course there hadn’t been a glass left in\r\nany of the windows, and the roof had had to be repaired. But thanks\r\nto the energy and ingenuity of Walter Farmer, the building had been\r\nrehabilitated in two months. Captain Farmer was the director of the new\r\nCollecting Point. When I asked where Farmer had got the glass, Charlie\r\nwas evasive. All he would say was that Captain Farmer was “wise in the\r\nways of the Army.”\r\n\r\nCharlie was headed for Vienna to confer with Lieutenant Colonel Ernest\r\nDewald, Chief of the MFA&A Section at USFA Headquarters (United States\r\nForces, Austria). Colonel Dewald wanted to complete the evacuation of\r\nthe mine at Alt Aussee, which was now under his jurisdiction. For this\r\nproject he hoped to obtain the services of the officers who had worked\r\nthere when the mine had been Third Army’s responsibility. Captain Rae was\r\nreluctant to lend the Special Evacuation Team, because there was still\r\nso much work to be done in Bavaria. But he agreed, provided that Charlie\r\ncould sell the idea to the Chief of Staff at Third Army. This Charlie\r\nsucceeded in doing, and departed for Vienna a day later. Steve was crazy\r\nto see Vienna—I think his parents had been born there—so Charlie took him\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nAfter they had left, Captain Rae requested Lamont and me to make an\r\ninspection trip to northern Bavaria. Our first stop was Bamberg. There we\r\nexamined the _Neue Residenz_, which Rae contemplated establishing as an\r\nauxiliary Collecting Point to house the contents of various repositories\r\nin Upper Franconia. Reports reaching his office indicated that storage\r\nconditions in that area were unsatisfactory. Either the repositories\r\nwere not weatherproof, or they were not being adequately guarded.\r\n\r\nIt was also rumored that UNRRA was planning to fill the _Neue Residenz_\r\nwith DPs—Displaced Persons. Captain Rae was determined to put a stop to\r\nthat, because the building, a fine example of late seventeenth century\r\narchitecture, was on the SHAEF List of Protected Monuments. This fact\r\nshould have guaranteed its immunity from such a hazard. Even during\r\ncombat, the SHAEF list had been a great protection to monuments of\r\nhistoric and artistic importance. Now that no “doctrine of military\r\nnecessity” could be invoked to justify improper use of the building, Rae\r\ndid not propose to countenance its occupancy by DPs.\r\n\r\nThe _Neue Residenz_ contained dozens of empty, brocaded rooms—but no\r\nplumbing. We decided that it would do for a Collecting Point and agreed\r\nwith Rae that the DPs should be housed elsewhere if possible. The officer\r\nfrom the local MG Detachment, who was showing us around, confirmed\r\nthe report that UNRRA intended to move in. He didn’t think they would\r\nrelinquish the building without a protest. The influx of refugees from\r\nthe Russian Zone had doubled the town’s normal population of sixty\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nIt was a disappointment to find that the superb sculpture in the\r\ncathedral across the square was still bricked up. The shelters had\r\nproved a needless precaution, for Bamberg had not been bombed. Only the\r\nbridge over the Regnitz had been blown up, and the Germans had done that\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nFrom Bamberg we drove north to Coburg, where we had a twofold mission.\r\nFirst we were to obtain specific information about ten cases which\r\ncontained a collection of art objects belonging to a prince of Hesse.\r\nThe cases were said to be stored in Feste Coburg, the walled castle\r\nabove the town. If they were the property of Philip of Hesse, then they\r\nwould probably be taken into custody by the American authorities. We had\r\nbeen told that he was in prison. His art dealings during the past few\r\nyears were being reviewed by the OSS officers charged with the special\r\ninvestigation of Nazi art-looting activities. Philip was the son of the\r\nLandgräfin of Hesse. It was in the flower-filled Waffenraum of her castle\r\nnear Frankfurt that I had seen the family tombs months before.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the cases belonged to a different prince of\r\nHesse—one whose political record was clean—and storage conditions were\r\nsatisfactory, we would simply leave them where they were for the time\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nOur second objective was Schloss Tambach, a few kilometers from Coburg.\r\nPaintings stolen by Frank, the Nazi Governor of Poland, from the palace\r\nat Warsaw were stored there. Schloss Tambach also contained pictures\r\nfrom the Stettin Museum. Stettin was now in the Russian Zone of Occupied\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nOn our arrival in Coburg, Lamont and I drove to the headquarters of the\r\nlocal MG Detachment, which were located in the Palais Edinburgh. This\r\nunpretentious building was once the residence of Queen Victoria’s son,\r\nthe Duke of Edinburgh. There we arranged with Lieutenant Milton A. Pelz,\r\nthe Monuments officer of the Coburg Detachment, to inspect the storage\r\nrooms at the castle.\r\n\r\nPelz was a big fellow who spoke German fluently. He welcomed us\r\nhospitably and took us up to the castle where we met Dr. Grundmann, who\r\nhad the keys to the storage rooms. This silent, sour-faced German was\r\ncurator of the Prince’s collections. He said that his employer was Prince\r\nLudwig of Hesse, a cousin of Philip. The cases contained paintings and\r\n_objets d’art_ which had been in the possession of the family for years.\r\nGrundmann had personally removed them from Ludwig’s estate in Silesia the\r\nday before the Russians occupied the area.\r\n\r\nLudwig’s most important treasure was the world-famous painting by Holbein\r\nknown as the _Madonna of Bürgermeister Meyer_. Painted in 1526, it had\r\nhung for years in the palace at Darmstadt. The Dresden Gallery owned a\r\nseventeenth century replica. Early in the war, Prince Ludwig had sent the\r\noriginal to his Silesian castle for safekeeping. Grundmann had brought it\r\nback to Bavaria along with the ten cases now at Coburg. From Coburg he\r\nhad taken the Holbein to Schloss Banz, a castle not far from Bamberg.\r\n\r\nHe said that the Prince was living at Wolfsgarten, a small country place\r\nnear Darmstadt. Ludwig was eager to regain possession of the painting.\r\nDid we think that could be arranged? We told him he would have to obtain\r\nan authorization from Captain Rae at Munich.\r\n\r\nSchloss Tambach was a ten-minute drive from Coburg. This great country\r\nhouse, built around three sides of a courtyard, belonged to the Countess\r\nof Ortenburg. She occupied the center section. A detachment of troops was\r\nbilleted in one wing. The other was filled with the Stettin and Warsaw\r\npictures. There were over two hundred from the Stettin Museum. Nineteenth\r\ncentury German paintings predominated, but I noticed two fine Hals\r\nportraits and a Van Gogh landscape among them.\r\n\r\nThe civilian custodian, answerable to the MG authorities at Coburg, was\r\nDr. Wilhelm Eggebrecht. He had been curator of the Stettin Museum until\r\nthrown out by the Nazis because his wife was one-quarter Jewish. He was a\r\nmousy little fellow with a bald head and gold-rimmed spectacles. He asked\r\napprehensively if we intended to send the paintings back to Russian-held\r\nStettin. We said that we had come only to check on the physical security\r\nof the present storage place. So far as we knew, the paintings would\r\nremain where they were for the present. This inconclusive piece of\r\ninformation seemed to reassure him.\r\n\r\nThe paintings looted from Warsaw were the _pièces de résistance_ of\r\nthe treasures at Schloss Tambach—especially the nine great canvases by\r\nBellotto, the eighteenth century Venetian master. Governor Frank had\r\nruthlessly removed the pictures from their stretchers and rolled them up\r\nfor shipment. As a result of this rough handling, the paint had flaked\r\noff in places, but the damage was not serious. When we examined the\r\npictures, they were spread out on the floor. They filled two rooms, forty\r\nfeet square. Later they were taken to the Munich Collecting Point and\r\nmounted on new stretchers, in preparation for their return to Warsaw.\r\n\r\nWhen we got back to Munich, Steve had returned from Vienna. He had news\r\nfor us. Charlie Kuhn had already left for Frankfurt. Colonel Dewald was\r\ncoming to Munich in a few days to talk to Colonel Roy Dalferes, Rae’s\r\nChief of Staff at Third Army, about reopening the Alt Aussee mine. Either\r\nCharlie or Bancel would come down from USFET Headquarters when Dewald\r\narrived. A new man had joined the MFA&A Section at USFA—Andrew Ritchie,\r\ndirector of the Buffalo Museum. He had come over as a civilian. Steve\r\nthought that Ritchie would be the USFA representative at Munich. There\r\nwas a lot of stuff at the Collecting Point which would eventually go back\r\nto Austria. It would have to be checked with the records there. That\r\nwould be Ritchie’s job. Steve told us also that Lincoln Kirstein had gone\r\nhome. His mother was seriously ill and Lincoln had left on emergency\r\norders.\r\n\r\nThe three of us went to Captain Rae’s office. Lamont and I had to make\r\na report on our trip to Coburg. Rae had a new assignment for us. He\r\nhad just received orders from USFET Headquarters to prepare the Cracow\r\naltarpiece for shipment. It was to be sent back to Poland as a token\r\nrestitution. This was the colossal carved altarpiece by Veit Stoss\r\nwhich the Nazis had stolen from the Church of St. Mary at Cracow. Veit\r\nStoss had been commissioned by the King of Poland in 1477 to carve the\r\ngreat work. It had taken him ten years. After the invasion of Poland in\r\n1939, the Nazis had carted it off, lock, stock and barrel, to Nürnberg.\r\nThey contended that, since Veit Stoss had been a native of Nürnberg, it\r\nbelonged in the city of his birth.\r\n\r\nThe missing altarpiece was the first of her looted treasures for which\r\nPoland had registered a claim with the American authorities at the close\r\nof the war. After months of diligent investigation, it was found by\r\nAmerican officers in an underground bunker across the street from the\r\nAlbrecht Dürer house in Nürnberg. In addition to the dismantled figures\r\nof the central panel—painted and gilded figures of hollow wood ten\r\nfeet high—the twelve ornate side panels, together with the statues and\r\npinnacles surmounting the framework, had been crowded into the bunker.\r\n\r\nThe same bunker contained another priceless looted treasure—the\r\ncoronation regalia of the Holy Roman Empire. Among these venerable\r\nobjects were the jeweled crown of the Emperor Conrad—commonly called\r\nthe “Crown of Charlemagne”—dating from the eleventh century, a shield,\r\ntwo swords and the orb. Since 1804 they had been preserved in the\r\nSchatzkammer, the Imperial Treasure Room, at Vienna. In 1938, the Nazis\r\nremoved them to Nürnberg, basing their claim to possession on a fifteenth\r\ncentury decree of the Emperor Sigismund that they were to be kept in that\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the German collapse, two high officials of the city had\r\nspirited away these five pieces. The credit for recovering the treasures\r\ngoes to an American officer of German birth, Lieutenant Walter Horn,\r\nprofessor of art at the University of California. The two officials at\r\nfirst disclaimed any knowledge of their whereabouts. After hours of\r\nrelentless grilling by Lieutenant Horn, the men finally admitted their\r\nguilt. They were promptly tried, heavily fined and sent to prison. Three\r\nmonths later, at the request of the Austrian Government, the imperial\r\ntreasures were flown back to Vienna. This historic shipment contained\r\nother relics which the Nazis had taken from the Schatzkammer—relics of\r\nthe greatest religious significance. They included an alleged fragment of\r\nthe True Cross, a section of the tablecloth said to have been used at the\r\nLast Supper, a lance venerated as the one which had touched the wounds of\r\nChrist, and links from the chains traditionally believed to have bound\r\nSt. Peter, St. Paul and St. John.\r\n\r\nOn Captain Rae’s instructions, Steve and I went to Nürnberg to pack the\r\nStoss altarpiece. (At that time the coronation regalia was still in the\r\nbunker, where, on the afternoon of our arrival, we had an opportunity to\r\nexamine it.) We found that the heavy framework which supported the altar\r\npanels was not stored in the bunker. Because of its size—the upright\r\npieces were thirty feet high—it had been taken to Schloss Wiesenthau, an\r\nold castle outside Forchheim, thirty miles away.\r\n\r\nLeaving Steve to start packing the smaller figures and pinnacles, I got\r\nhold of a semitrailer, the only vehicle long enough to accommodate a load\r\nof such length. It was an hour’s drive to the castle. With a crew of\r\ntwenty PWs, I finished loading the framework in two hours and returned to\r\nNürnberg in time for supper.\r\n\r\nThat evening Steve and I figured out the number of trucks we would need\r\nfor the altarpiece. Lamont had remained in Munich to make tentative\r\narrangements, pending word from us. He was going to ask for ten trucks\r\nand we came to the conclusion that this would be about the right\r\nnumber—in addition, of course, to the semitrailer for the supporting\r\nframework. We got out our maps and studied our probable route to Cracow.\r\nOne road would take us through Dresden and Breslau; another by way of\r\nPilsen and Prague. Perhaps we could go one way and return the other. In\r\neither case we would have to pass through Russian-occupied territory.\r\nIt would probably take some time to obtain the necessary clearances. We\r\nfigured on taking enough gas for the round trip, since we doubted if\r\nthere would be any to spare in Poland. Altogether it promised to be a\r\ncomplicated expedition, but already we had visions of a triumphal entry\r\ninto Cracow.\r\n\r\nOur ambitious plans collapsed the following morning. While Steve and I\r\nwere at breakfast, I was called to the telephone. The corporal in Captain\r\nRae’s office was on the wire. I was to return to Munich at once. Major La\r\nFarge was arriving from Frankfurt and wanted to see me that night. Plans\r\nfor the trip to Cracow were indefinitely postponed. Internal conditions\r\nin Poland were too unsettled to risk returning the altarpiece.\r\n\r\nOur plans had miscarried before, but this was our first major\r\ndisappointment. We had begun to look on the Polish venture as the fitting\r\nclimax of our work as a Special Evacuation Team. On the way back to\r\nMunich, Steve said he had a feeling that the team was going to be split\r\nup.\r\n\r\nSteve’s misgivings were prophetic. At Craig’s apartment after dinner,\r\nBancel La Farge outlined the plans he had for us. Colonel Dalferes\r\nhad acceded to Colonel Dewald’s request. Lamont, Steve and a third\r\nofficer—new to MFA&A work—were to resume the evacuation of the salt mine\r\nat Alt Aussee. If the snows held off, it would be possible to carry on\r\noperations there for another month or six weeks.\r\n\r\nI was to return to USFET Headquarters at Frankfurt as Deputy Chief of the\r\nMFA&A Section, replacing Charlie Kuhn who had just received his orders\r\nto go home. I knew that Charlie would soon be eligible for release from\r\nactive duty, but had no idea that his departure was so imminent.\r\n\r\nWe didn’t have much to say to one another on the way to our quarters\r\nthat night. Steve had already made up his mind that he wasn’t going to\r\nlike the new man. Lamont said that he thought it was going to be an\r\nawful anticlimax to reopen the mine. And for me, the prospect of routine\r\nadministrative work at USFET was uninviting. After three months of\r\nstrenuous and exciting field work, it wouldn’t be easy to settle down in\r\nan office. All three of us felt that the great days were over.\r\n\r\nDuring our last week together in Munich we had little time to feel sorry\r\nfor ourselves. Everyone was preoccupied with the restitution program.\r\nWe had our full share of the work. Another important shipment was to be\r\nmade to Belgium. It was to include the Michelangelo Madonna, the eleven\r\npaintings stolen from the church in Bruges when the statue was taken, and\r\nthe four panels by Dirk Bouts from the famous altarpiece in the church\r\nof St. Pierre at Louvain. These panels, which formed the wings of the\r\naltarpiece, had been removed by the Germans in August 1942. Before the\r\nfirst World War one wing had been in the Berlin Gallery, the other in the\r\nAlte Pinakothek at Munich. As in the case of the Ghent altarpiece, they\r\nhad been restored—unjustly, according to the Germans—to Belgium by the\r\nVersailles Treaty.\r\n\r\nThis shipment to Belgium represented the first practical application of\r\nthe “come and get it” theory of restitution, evolved by Major La Farge.\r\nBelgium had already received the Ghent altarpiece as token restitution.\r\nNow it was up to the Belgians to carry on at their own expense. The\r\nspecial representatives who came down from Brussels to supervise this\r\ninitial shipment were Dr. Paul Coremans, a great technical expert, and\r\nLieutenant Pierre Longuy of the Ministry of Fine Arts. They had their own\r\ntruck but had been unable to bring suitable packing materials. We had an\r\nample supply of pads and blankets which we had stored at the Collecting\r\nPoint after our evacuation of the Göring collection. We placed them\r\nat the disposal of the Belgians. But it was Saturday and no civilian\r\npackers were available. Dr. Coremans gratefully accepted the offer of our\r\nservices. Steve, Lamont and I loaded the truck. It was the last operation\r\nof the Special Evacuation Team.\r\n\r\nThe Belgians had no sooner departed than the French and Dutch\r\nrepresentatives arrived. Captain Hubert de Brye for France looked more\r\nlike a sportsman than a scholar; but he was a man of wide cultivation and\r\nhad a sense of humor which endeared him to his associates in Munich. He\r\nand Ham Coulter were kindred spirits and became great friends.\r\n\r\nHam, who had been responsible for the rehabilitation of both the\r\nCollecting Point and the Führerbau, now had two assistants—Captain George\r\nLacy and Dietrich Sattler, the latter a German architect. Through this\r\ndivision of the work, Ham found time for new duties: he took the foreign\r\nrepresentatives in tow, arranged for their billets, their mess cards,\r\ntheir PX rations and so on. It was an irritating but not a thankless job,\r\nfor the recipients of his attentions were devoted to their “wet nurse.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Albrecht Dürer house at Nürnberg—before and after the\r\nGerman collapse. In an underground bunker across the street were stored\r\nthe crown jewels of the Holy Roman Empire and the famous Veit Stoss\r\naltarpiece.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Veit Stoss altarpiece from the Church of Our Lady in\r\nCracow, which was carried off by the Nazis at the beginning of the war,\r\nhas been returned to Poland. _Left_, open; _right_, closed.]\r\n\r\nThe Dutch representative was Lieutenant Colonel Alphonse Vorenkamp. He\r\nwas a little man with gray hair, shrewd gray eyes and steel-rimmed\r\nspectacles. An eminent authority on Dutch painting, he had been for\r\nseveral years a member of the faculty at Smith College. He enjoyed the\r\nunusual distinction of having served in both the American and Dutch\r\nArmies during the present war.\r\n\r\nI had met him in San Francisco in 1944, shortly after his discharge\r\nfrom the service. He had been a buck private; and I gathered from the\r\nstory of his experiences that our Army had released him in self-defense.\r\nHe told me that he often had difficulty in understanding the drill\r\nsergeant. Once, without thinking he had stepped out of formation and\r\nasked politely, “Sergeant, would you mind repeating that last order!”\r\nVorenkamp said that he had paid dearly for his indiscretion, so dearly in\r\nfact that he had seriously considered changing his name from Alphonse to\r\nLatrinus. Alphonse, he said, was a ridiculous name for a Dutchman anyway.\r\nHe preferred to be called Phonse.\r\n\r\nReleased from the Army, he had gone back to his teaching. Then, only\r\na few months ago, the Dutch Government had requested his services in\r\nconnection with the restitution of looted art. They had offered him a\r\nlieutenant-colonelcy and he had accepted.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch, as well as the British and French, had made a practice\r\nof conferring upon qualified civilians ranks consistent with the\r\nresponsibilities of given jobs. Our government’s failure to do\r\nlikewise—so far as the art program was concerned—resulted in a disparity\r\nin rank which frequently placed American MFA&A personnel at a great\r\ndisadvantage.\r\n\r\nOf all the foreign representatives, none served his country more\r\nzealously than Phonse Vorenkamp. Throughout the fall and winter months,\r\nhis convoys shuttled back and forth between Munich and Amsterdam. When I\r\nlast heard from him—in the late spring—he had restored to Holland more\r\nthan nine hundred paintings, upward of two thousand pieces of sculpture,\r\nporcelain and glass, along with truckloads of tapestries, rugs and\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\nI left Munich on a rainy morning at the end of September. Lamont and\r\nSteve were planning to depart for Alt Aussee at the same time. The\r\nthree of us had agreed to meet in front of the Collecting Point at\r\neight-thirty. I was a few minutes late and when I got there the guard at\r\nthe entrance said they had already gone. I hadn’t felt so forlorn since\r\nthe day Craig and I had parted in Bad Homburg months before. As I started\r\ndown the steps to the command car, Phonse Vorenkamp called from the\r\ndoorway. He had come to work a little earlier than usual, just to see me\r\noff. He was full of waspish good humor, joked about the magnificence of\r\nmy new job in Frankfurt, and promised to look me up when he came through\r\nwith his first convoy. The driver stepped on the starter and, as we\r\nrounded the corner into the Brienner-Strasse, Phonse waved us on our way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(10)\r\n\r\n_MISSION TO AMSTERDAM; THE WIESBADEN MANIFESTO_\r\n\r\n\r\nI reported to Major La Farge upon arrival. Since my visit to Frankfurt\r\nwith Lamont and Steve six weeks before, there had been several changes\r\nin the MFA&A Section. With the removal to Berlin of the Monuments\r\nofficers attached to the U. S. Group Control Council, our office at USFET\r\nHeadquarters in Frankfurt had been transferred to Höchst. The move was\r\nlogical enough because we were part of the Restitution Control Branch\r\nof the Economics Division, which was located there. For all practical\r\npurposes, however, we would have been better off in Frankfurt, since our\r\nwork involved daily contacts with other divisions—all located at the main\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\nThe Höchst office was a barnlike room, some thirty feet square, on\r\nthe second floor of the Exposition Building. It required considerable\r\ningenuity to find the room, for it was tucked in behind a row of\r\nlaboratories occupied by white-coated German civilians, former employees\r\nof I. G. Farben, who were now working for the American Military\r\nGovernment. At one end of the room were desks for the Chief and Deputy\r\nChief. The rest of the furniture consisted of four long work tables and\r\ntwo small file cabinets. The staff was equally meager—Major La Farge,\r\nLieutenant Edith Standen, Corporal James Reeds and a German civilian\r\nstenographer.\r\n\r\nThe first few days were a period of intensive indoctrination. The morning\r\nI arrived, Bancel defined the relationship between our office and the one\r\nat Berlin; and between us and the two districts of the American Zone—the\r\nEastern District, which was under Third Army, and the Western District,\r\nunder Seventh Army. He described the Berlin office as the final authority\r\nin determining policy. In theory, if not always in fact, a given policy\r\nwas adopted only after an exchange of views between the Frankfurt-Höchst\r\noffice and the one in Berlin. The activation of policy was our function.\r\nUSFET—that is, our office—was an operational headquarters. Berlin was not.\r\n\r\nAnd how did we activate policy? By means of directives. Directives to\r\nwhom? To Third Army at Munich and Seventh Army at Heidelberg. That\r\nsounded simple enough, until Bancel explained that a directive was not\r\nexactly an imperial decree. Just as it was our prerogative to activate\r\npolicies approved by Berlin, so it was the prerogative of the Armies to\r\nimplement our directives as they deemed expedient. He reminded me that\r\nthe two Armies were independent and autonomous within their respective\r\nareas. In other words, we could tell them _what_ to do, but not _how_\r\nto do it. Bancel was an old hand at writing directives, knowing how to\r\ngive each phrase just the right emphasis. At first the longer ones seemed\r\nstilted and occasionally ambiguous. But I was not accustomed to military\r\njargon. Later I came to realize that Army communications always sounded\r\nstilted; and what I had mistaken for ambiguity was often deliberate\r\ncircumlocution, calculated to soften the force of an unpalatable order.\r\n\r\nBancel said there were more important things to worry about than the\r\ncomposition of directives. One was the problem of token restitutions. He\r\nwas sorry to postpone the one to Poland, but that couldn’t be helped.\r\nNow that France and Belgium had received theirs, Holland was next on the\r\nlist. The ceremony in Brussels had made a great hit. He thought a similar\r\naffair might be arranged at The Hague. Vorenkamp was selecting a group of\r\npictures at the Collecting Point. We would provide a plane to fly them\r\nto Amsterdam. Captain Rae was to notify our office as soon as Vorenkamp\r\nwas ready to leave—probably within the next two days. In the meantime\r\nBancel was having orders cut for me to go to Holland. I was to see the\r\nAmerican ambassador, explain the idea of these token restitutions, and\r\nsound him out on the subject of planning a ceremony similar to the one\r\nour ambassador had arranged in Brussels. Colonel Anthony Biddle, Chief of\r\nthe Allied Contacts Section at USFET Headquarters, had promised Bancel\r\nto write a letter of introduction for me to take to The Hague. Bancel\r\nsuggested that I make tentative arrangements with the motor pool for a\r\ncar and driver.\r\n\r\nIt was almost noon and Bancel had an appointment in Frankfurt at\r\ntwelve-thirty. He just had time to catch the bus. After he left, Reeds\r\nand the stenographer went out to lunch, so Edith Standen and I had the\r\noffice to ourselves. We had a lot to talk over, as I had not seen her\r\nsince June when we worked together on the inventory of the Berlin Museum\r\ncollections at the Reichsbank.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, she had been stationed at Höchst. When the Group CC\r\noutfit—to which she was officially attached—moved to Berlin, she had\r\npreferred to remain with the USFET office. On the Organizational Chart\r\nof the MFA&A Section, Edith was listed as the “Officer in Charge of\r\nTechnical Files.” Actually she was in charge of a great many other things\r\nas well. When the Chief and Deputy Chief were away from headquarters at\r\nthe same time—and they often were—Edith took over the affairs of the\r\nSection. She must have been born with these remarkable administrative\r\ngifts, for she could have had little opportunity to develop them as the\r\ncloistered curator of the Widener Collection where, as she said herself,\r\nshe was “accustomed to the silent padding of butlers and the spontaneous\r\nappearance of orchids and gardenias among the Rembrandts and the\r\nRaphaels.”\r\n\r\nI asked her if there had been any new developments regarding the proposed\r\nremoval of German-owned art to the United States. Yes, there had been.\r\nBut nothing conclusive. There was a cable from General Clay to the War\r\nDepartment early in September.[3] The cable spoke of “holding German\r\nobjects of art in trust for eventual return to the German people.” But\r\nit didn’t contain the clause “if and when the German nation had earned\r\nthe right to their return” which had appeared in the original document.\r\nBesides the cable, there had been a communication from Berlin asking for\r\nan estimate of the cubic footage in art repositories of the American\r\nZone. It was a question impossible to answer accurately. But Bancel and\r\nCharlie had figured out a reply, citing the approximate size of one of\r\nthe repositories and leaving it up to Berlin to multiply the figures\r\nby the total number in the entire zone. Now that John Nicholas Brown\r\nand Charlie Kuhn were back in the United States, they might be able to\r\ndiscourage the projected removal. I had only one piece of information to\r\ncontribute on the subject: a letter from George Stout saying that he had\r\nbeen asked by the Roberts Commission to give an opinion, based on purely\r\ntechnical grounds, of the risk involved in sending paintings to America.\r\nHe did so, stating that to remove them would _cube_ the risk of leaving\r\nthem in Germany.\r\n\r\nWhen Corporal Reeds returned to the office, Edith and I went across the\r\nstreet to the Officers’ Mess. While we were at lunch, she told me that\r\nJim Reeds had been a discovery of George’s. He had been with George and\r\nBancel at their office in Wiesbaden. Jim was a tall, serious fellow with\r\nsandy hair and a turned-up nose. Edith said that he had been a medical\r\nstudent before the war and that he came from Missouri. There was so much\r\npaper work to do in the office that he never got caught up. The German\r\ntypist was slow and inaccurate. Jim had to do over nearly half the\r\nletters he gave her to copy. But his patience was inexhaustible and he\r\nnever complained.\r\n\r\nBancel didn’t get back from Frankfurt until late in the afternoon. The\r\nreturn of the Veit Stoss altarpiece had come up again and he had had a\r\nlong talk about it with the Polish liaison officer at USFET, who was a\r\nnephew of the Archbishop of Cracow. After that he had had a session with\r\nColonel A. J. de la Bretesche, the French liaison officer. And, for good\r\nmeasure, he had to take up the problem of clearance for the two Czech\r\nrepresentatives who would be arriving in a few days. He said wearily\r\nthat practically all of his days were like that, now that restitution\r\nwas going full speed ahead. I told him that I had had an uneventful\r\nbut profitable afternoon, going through the correspondence which had\r\naccumulated on his desk. There had been several telephone calls, among\r\nthem one from Colonel Walter Kluss. Bancel said he would answer that one\r\nin person, as he wanted to introduce me to the colonel, who was chief of\r\nthe Restitution Control Branch. Restitution involved settling the claims\r\nof the occupied countries for everything the Germans had taken from\r\nthem. These claims covered every conceivable kind of property—factory\r\nequipment, vehicles, barges, machinery, racehorses, livestock, household\r\nfurniture, etc.\r\n\r\nThe colonel’s office was at the end of the corridor. On our way down the\r\nhall, Bancel said that the Army could do with a few more officers like\r\nColonel Kluss. This observation didn’t give me a very clear picture of\r\nthe colonel, but when I met him I knew what Bancel meant. There was an\r\nunassuming friendliness and simplicity about him that I didn’t usually\r\nassociate with full colonels. His interest in the activities of the MFA&A\r\nSection was genuine and personal. He was particularly fond of Bancel and\r\nEdith and, during our visit with him that afternoon, spoke admiringly of\r\nthe work which they and Charlie Kuhn had done. While other sections of\r\nthe Restitution Control Branch were still generalizing about restitution,\r\nthe MFA&A Section had tackled the problem realistically. It wasn’t a\r\nquestion of mapping out a program which might work. The program _did_\r\nwork. The wisdom and foresight of Bancel’s planning appealed to the\r\npractical side of Colonel Kluss’ nature and, throughout the months of our\r\nassociation with him, he was never too busy to help us when we went to\r\nhim with our troubles.\r\n\r\nBancel and I took the seven o’clock bus over to Frankfurt that evening.\r\nWe had dinner at the Officers’ Mess in the Casino behind USFET\r\nHeadquarters. We were joined there by Lieutenant William Lovegrove,\r\nthe officer whom Bancel had selected as our representative at Paris in\r\nconnection with the restitution of looted art works to the French. With\r\nthe arrival of the French representative in Munich, regular shipments\r\nwould soon be departing for France. Their destination in Paris was to\r\nbe the Musée du Jeu de Paume, which was now the headquarters of the\r\n_Commission de Récupération Artistique_, the commission composed of\r\nofficials from the French museums charged with the task of sorting and\r\ndistributing the plundered treasures. Among the officials selected to\r\nassist in this work was Captain Rose Valland, the courageous Frenchwoman\r\nwho, as I mentioned earlier, had spied on the Nazi thieves in that same\r\nmuseum during the Occupation.\r\n\r\nWe had roughly estimated that it would require from three to six months\r\nto send back the main bulk of the French loot from Germany. Mass\r\nevacuation, as I have mentioned before, had the advantage of accelerating\r\nrestitution. It had the disadvantage of rendering difficult our procedure\r\nof evaluating and photographing objects before they were returned. It\r\nwas our intention that Lieutenant Lovegrove should obtain the desired\r\nphotographs and appraisals. American military establishments in France\r\nwere being drastically reduced, but we planned to attach him to the USFET\r\nMission to France. We had been told that the Mission would be withdrawn\r\nin the early spring. If Lovegrove’s work weren’t finished by that time,\r\nBancel thought it might be possible to attach him to our Paris Embassy\r\nwhen the Mission folded.\r\n\r\nWhen Bancel introduced me to Lovegrove that evening at the Casino, I\r\nthought he would be very much at home in an embassy. He was of medium\r\nheight, bald, had a pink and white complexion and wore a small mustache.\r\nHe was self-possessed without being blasé. Lovegrove was a sculptor and\r\nhad lived in Paris for many years before the war. Bancel said that he\r\nspoke a more perfect French than most Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nSubsequent developments proved the wisdom of Bancel’s choice. Lovegrove\r\nwas exceedingly popular with his French associates at the Musée du Jeu de\r\nPaume. His extraordinary tact and his capacity for hard work were equally\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nI particularly remember our last meeting. It was in February, when I\r\nwas stopping briefly in Paris on my way home from Germany. By that time\r\nhundreds of carloads of stolen art had been received at the Jeu de\r\nPaume. There were one or two final matters which I wished to take up with\r\nM. Henraux and M. Dreyfus, members of the _Commission de Récupération\r\nArtistique_. When Lovegrove and I arrived at the museum, we found\r\nthese two charming, elderly gentlemen in their office. With them was\r\nM. David-Weill. He was examining a fine gold snuffbox. The office was\r\nlittered with gold and silver objects. They were part of the fabulous\r\ncollection which Lamont, Steve and I had packed by candlelight in the\r\nCastle of Neuschwanstein six months before.\r\n\r\nDuring the second week of October, I left for Amsterdam. It was a\r\nthree-hundred-mile drive from Frankfurt. Cassidy, the driver of the jeep,\r\nwas a New Jersey farm boy who, unlike most drivers, preferred long trips\r\nto short local runs. The foothills of the Taunus Mountains were bright\r\nwith fall coloring along the back road to Limburg. From there we turned\r\nwest to the Rhine. Then, skirting the east bank of the river, we crossed\r\nover into the British Zone at Cologne. From Cologne—where we lunched at\r\na British mess—our road led through Duisburg, Wesel and the skeleton of\r\nEmerich.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the Dutch frontier at five and continued through battered\r\nArnhem to Utrecht. Utrecht was full of exuberant Canadians. I stopped\r\nat the headquarters of the local Town Major to inquire about a mess for\r\ntransient officers. A friendly lieutenant, a blonde Dutch girl on his\r\narm, was on his way to supper and suggested that I join them. He said\r\nthat Cassidy could eat at a Red Cross Club.\r\n\r\nThe dining room in the officers’ hotel was noisy and crowded. Most of the\r\nofficers, the lieutenant explained, were going home in a few days. It was\r\ngood to be in a city which, superficially at least, showed no scars of\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nWe reached Amsterdam about nine-thirty. At night the canals were\r\nconfusing. Cassidy and I looked in vain for the Town Major. Finally we\r\nfound a Canadian “leave hotel.” The enlisted man on duty at the desk\r\ndispensed with the formality of the billet permit I should have obtained\r\nfrom the Town Major, and assigned us rooms on the same floor. Cassidy\r\ndecided that the Canadians were a democratic outfit.\r\n\r\nBancel had instructed me to inform the Dutch Restitution Commission,\r\nknown as the “C.G.R.,” that Lieutenant Colonel Vorenkamp was scheduled\r\nto reach Amsterdam at noon on the day following my arrival, so the next\r\nmorning I went to the headquarters of the commission to deliver Major\r\nLa Farge’s message. The commission occupied the stately old Goudstikker\r\nhouse on the Heerengracht. Before the war, Goudstikker had been a great\r\nDutch art dealer. In the galleries of this house had been held many\r\nfine exhibitions of Dutch painting. During the German Occupation of the\r\nNetherlands, an unscrupulous Nazi named Miedl had “acquired” the entire\r\nGoudstikker stock from the dealer’s widow. We had found many of the\r\nGoudstikker pictures at Alt Aussee and in the Göring collection.\r\n\r\nBancel had told me to ask for Captain Robert de Vries. I was informed\r\nthat the captain was in London. In his stead Nicolaes Vroom, his\r\nscholarly young deputy, received me. He had had no word of Colonel\r\nVorenkamp’s impending arrival. Vroom transmitted the message immediately\r\nto Jonkheer Roel, director of the Rijksmuseum. Twenty minutes later,\r\nthis distinguished gentleman appeared in Vroom’s office. With him were\r\nLieutenant Colonel H. Polis and Captain ter Meer, both of whom were\r\nattached to the C.G.R. They were delighted to know about the plane which\r\nI told them was due at Schiphol Airport. Telephonic connections with\r\nMunich had not yet been re-established. They had to depend on the USFET\r\nMission at The Hague for transmission of all messages from the American\r\nZone. It often took days for a telegram to get through.\r\n\r\nThere was barely time enough to telephone for a truck to meet the plane.\r\nAlso Mr. van Haagen, Permanent Secretary of Education and Science,\r\nmust be notified at once. I was told that he would accompany us to the\r\nairport. In another hour we were all on our way to Schiphol.\r\n\r\nWe waited two hours at the field and still no sign of the plane from\r\nMunich. The weather was fine at the airport, but there were reports of\r\nheavy fog to the south. At two o’clock we returned to Amsterdam and\r\nlunched at the Dutch officers’ mess. My hosts apologized for the food.\r\nThey said that they no longer received British Army rations. The menu\r\nwas prepared from civilian supplies. It was a Spartan diet—cheese, bread\r\nand jam, and weak coffee. But they shared it so hospitably that only a\r\ngraceless guest would have complained of the lack of variety. Captain ter\r\nMeer said that it was more palatable than the tulip bulbs he had lived on\r\nthe winter before.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch, Cassidy and I drove to the USFET Mission at The Hague.\r\nColonel Ira W. Black, Chief of the Mission, arranged for me to see the\r\nAmerican ambassador. The temporary offices of our embassy were located in\r\na tall brick building on the edge of the city.\r\n\r\nI presented Colonel Biddle’s letter to Mr. Stanley Hornbeck, the\r\nambassador, who looked more like a successful businessman than a\r\ndiplomat. He frowned as he read, and when he had finished, said gruffly,\r\n“Commander, Tony Biddle is a charming fellow and I am very fond of him.\r\nI’d like to be obliging, but we’ve had too damn many celebrations and\r\nceremonies in this country already. We need more hard work instead of\r\nmore holidays. It’s very nice about the pictures coming back, but steel\r\nmills and machinery would be a lot more welcome.”\r\n\r\nI hadn’t expected this reaction and, having had little experience with\r\nambassadors—irascible or otherwise—I hardly knew what to say. After an\r\nembarrassing pause, I ventured the remark that a very simple ceremony\r\nwould be enough.\r\n\r\nAfter his first outburst, the ambassador relented to the extent of saying\r\nhe’d think it over. As I left his office, he called after me, “My bark’s\r\nworse than my bite.”\r\n\r\nOn my way back to Amsterdam, I concluded unhappily that as a diplomatic\r\nerrand boy I was a washout. I’d better go back to loading trucks.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the hotel I found a message that the plane with Vorenkamp\r\nand the pictures had arrived. I met Phonse the following morning at\r\nthe Goudstikker house. He introduced me to Lieutenant Hans Jaffé, a\r\nDutch Monuments officer, who bore a striking resemblance to Robert\r\nLouis Stevenson. Several weeks later Jaffé was chosen as the Dutch\r\nrepresentative for the Western District of the American Zone. His work\r\nat Seventh Army Headquarters in Heidelberg was comparable to that of\r\nVorenkamp’s in Munich. He was intelligent and industrious. During the\r\nnext few months he was as successful in his investigations of looted\r\nDutch art works as Phonse was in Bavaria. Jaffé didn’t reap so rich a\r\nharvest, but that was only because there was less loot in his territory.\r\n\r\nHe and Phonse took me to the Rijksmuseum where the twenty-six paintings\r\nfrom Munich were being unpacked. They were a hand-picked group consisting\r\nmainly of seventeenth century Dutch masters, which included four\r\nRembrandts. One of the Rembrandts was the _Still Life with Dead Peacocks_\r\nwhich Lamont and I had taken out of the mine at Alt Aussee. There was\r\na twenty-seventh picture: it was the fraudulent Vermeer of the Göring\r\ncollection. Phonse had brought it back to be used as evidence against its\r\nauthor, the notorious Van Meegeren.\r\n\r\nThe Rijksmuseum was holding a magnificent exhibition, appropriately\r\nentitled “The Return of the Old Masters.” Among the one hundred and forty\r\nmasterpieces, which had been stored in underground shelters for the\r\npast five years, were six Vermeers, nine paintings by Frans Hals, and\r\nseventeen Rembrandts, including the famous _Night Watch_.\r\n\r\nThat evening Phonse took Cassidy and me to the country place occupied\r\nby the officers of the C.G.R. It was called “Oud Bussum” and was near\r\nNaarden, about fifteen miles from Amsterdam. The luxurious house had been\r\nthe property of a well known Dutch collaborator. Many high-ranking Nazis\r\nhad been entertained there. As a mark of special favor I was given the\r\nsuite which had been used by Göring.\r\n\r\nAt dinner I sat between Colonel W. C. Posthumus-Meyjes, Chief of the\r\nRestitution Commission, and Phonse Vorenkamp. The colonel, to the\r\nregret of his associates, was soon to relinquish his duties in order to\r\naccept an important diplomatic post in Canada. Toward the end of the\r\nmeal, Phonse asked me how I had made out with the ambassador. I gave a\r\nnoncommittal reply. He looked at me shrewdly through his steel-rimmed\r\nspectacles and said, “We would not expect your ambassador to arrange a\r\nceremony. That is for us to do. It is for us to express our gratitude to\r\nGeneral Eisenhower.”\r\n\r\n(Phonse was as good as his word. A few weeks later, officials of the\r\nNetherlands Government arranged a luncheon in one of the rooms of the\r\nRijksmuseum. It was the first affair of its kind in the history of\r\nthe museum. Only the simplest food was served, but the table was set\r\nwith rare old silver, porcelain and glass. Colonel Kluss and Bancel\r\nrepresented USFET Headquarters. I was told that no one enjoyed himself\r\nmore than the American ambassador.)\r\n\r\nThe next morning Phonse suggested that I return with him in the plane. He\r\nhad it entirely to himself except for the empty packing cases which he\r\nwas taking back to Munich. He said that the slight detour to Frankfurt\r\ncould be easily arranged. So I sent Cassidy back in the jeep and at noon\r\nPhonse and I—sole occupants of the C-47 which had been chartered in the\r\nname of General Eisenhower—took off from Schiphol Airport. An hour and\r\ntwenty minutes later we landed at Frankfurt.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of October, a token restitution was made to\r\nCzechoslovakia. The objects chosen were the famous fourteenth century\r\nHohenfurth altarpiece and the collections of the Army Museum at Prague.\r\nBoth had been stolen by the Nazis. The altarpiece, evacuated from the Alt\r\nAussee mine, was now at the Central Collecting Point in Munich. The Army\r\nMuseum collections were stored at Schloss Banz, near Bamberg. Lieutenant\r\nColonel František Vrečko and Captain Egon Suk, as representatives of\r\nthe Czech Government, were invited to USFET Headquarters. We arranged\r\nfor them to proceed from there to Schloss Banz, where they were met by\r\nLieutenant Walter Horn. I have mentioned Horn before as the Monuments\r\nofficer whose remarkable sleuthing resulted in recovery of the five\r\npieces of the coronation regalia at Nürnberg. While the Czech officers\r\nwere en route, we directed Captain Rae at Third Army to arrange for the\r\ndelivery of the Hohenfurth panels to Schloss Banz. Captain Rae, in turn,\r\ndesignated Lieutenant Commander Coulter to transport them from Munich.\r\n(Both Ham Coulter and I had received our additional half-stripe earlier\r\nin the month.) This joint operation was carried out successfully and,\r\nin succeeding months, restitution to Czechoslovakia became a matter of\r\nroutine shipments at regular intervals.\r\n\r\nAlso before the end of October, we became involved again in the\r\ncomplicated problem of the Veit Stoss altarpiece. Major Charles\r\nEstreicher was selected as the Polish representative. The major spent\r\nseveral days at our office in Höchst studying our files for additional\r\ndata on Polish loot in the American Zone before continuing to Munich and\r\nNürnberg. Because of the condition of the roads, the actual return of the\r\naltarpiece as a token restitution to Poland was delayed until the early\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nWhile we were in the midst of these negotiations Bancel conferred with\r\nColonel Hayden Smith at USFET headquarters in Frankfurt on the subject\r\nof the proposed removal of German-owned works of art to the United\r\nStates. Colonel Smith was Chief of Staff to Major General C. L. Adcock,\r\nDeputy Director of the office of military government, U. S. Zone. Bancel\r\nimpressed upon the colonel the practical difficulties involved and\r\nstressed the _technical_, not the moral objections to shipping valuable\r\nworks of art to America. As a result of this conference the colonel asked\r\nBancel to prepare a memorandum on the subject for submission to his chief.\r\n\r\nThe finished memorandum which Edith and I helped Bancel prepare followed\r\nthe general pattern of a staff study—a statement of the “problem” with\r\nspecific suggestions relating to its solution. It contained an eloquent\r\nplea for the importation of additional MFA&A personnel to assume\r\nresponsibility for the project and called attention to acute shortages\r\nin packing materials and transportation facilities. It also pointed out\r\nthat the advisability of moving fragile objects across the ocean would be\r\nbalanced against the advantages of leaving them in the Central Collecting\r\nPoints, all three of which had been made weatherproof months before and\r\nwere now provided with sufficient coal to prevent deterioration of the\r\nobjects during the winter months.\r\n\r\nNothing came of our recommendations. Within two weeks, Colonel Harry\r\nMcBride, administrator of the National Gallery in Washington, arrived\r\nin Berlin to expedite the first shipment. He flew down to Frankfurt two\r\ndays later to discuss ways and means with Major La Farge. We learned\r\nfrom him that General Clay’s recommendation for immediate removal had\r\nbeen approved by the highest national authority. The General was now\r\nin Washington. The futility of protest was obvious. Bancel told the\r\ncolonel that our Monuments officers were strongly opposed to the project.\r\nHe said that some of them might request transfer rather than comply\r\nwith the order. The colonel replied that such requests would, in all\r\nprobability, be refused. The only other alternative—open defiance of the\r\norder—could have but one consequence, a court-martial. And, assuming\r\nthat our officers elected to face court-martial, what would be gained?\r\nNothing, according to the colonel; the order would still be carried out.\r\nIf trained MFA&A personnel were not available, then the work would have\r\nto be done by such officers and men as might be obtainable, experienced\r\nor not. Bancel realized that his primary duty was the “protection and\r\nsalvage” of art works. If he deliberately left them at the mercy of\r\nwhatever troops might be available to do the packing, then he would be\r\nguilty of dereliction of duty. This interpretation afforded him some\r\nconsolation.\r\n\r\nAs Bancel had predicted, our Monuments officers lost no time in\r\nregistering their disapproval. They expressed their sentiments as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n             U. S. FORCES, EUROPEAN THEATER[4] GERMANY\r\n\r\n                                                    7 November 1945\r\n\r\n    1. We, the undersigned Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives\r\n    Specialist Officers of the Armed Forces of the United States,\r\n    wish to make known our convictions regarding the transportation\r\n    to the United States of works of art, the property of German\r\n    institutions or nationals, for purposes of protective custody.\r\n\r\n    2. a. We are unanimously agreed that the transportation of\r\n    those works of art, undertaken by the United States Army, upon\r\n    direction from the highest national authority, establishes a\r\n    precedent which is neither morally tenable nor trustworthy.\r\n\r\n    b. Since the beginning of United States participation in the\r\n    war, it has been the declared policy of the Allied Forces, so\r\n    far as military necessity would permit, to protect and preserve\r\n    from deterioration consequent upon the processes of war, all\r\n    monuments, documents, or other objects of historic, artistic,\r\n    cultural, or archaeological value. The war is at an end and no\r\n    doctrine of “military necessity” can now be invoked for the\r\n    further protection of the objects to be moved, for the reason\r\n    that depots and personnel, both fully competent for their\r\n    protection, have been inaugurated and are functioning.\r\n\r\n    c. The Allied nations are at present preparing to prosecute\r\n    individuals for the crime of sequestering, under pretext of\r\n    “protective custody,” the cultural treasures of German-occupied\r\n    countries. A major part of the indictment follows upon the\r\n    reasoning that even though these individuals were acting under\r\n    military orders, the dictates of a higher ethical law made it\r\n    incumbent upon them to refuse to take part in, or countenance,\r\n    the fulfillment of these orders. We, the undersigned, feel it\r\n    our duty to point out that, though as members of the armed\r\n    forces, we will carry out the orders we receive, we are thus\r\n    put before any candid eyes as no less culpable than those whose\r\n    prosecution we affect to sanction.\r\n\r\n    3. We wish to state that from our own knowledge, no historical\r\n    grievance will rankle so long, or be the cause of so much\r\n    justified bitterness, as the removal, for any reason, of a\r\n    part of the heritage of any nation, even if that heritage be\r\n    interpreted as a prize of war. And though this removal may be\r\n    done with every intention of altruism, we are none the less\r\n    convinced that it is our duty, individually and collectively,\r\n    to protest against it, and that though our obligations are to\r\n    the nation to which we owe allegiance, there are yet further\r\n    obligations to common justice, decency, and the establishment\r\n    of the power of right, not might, among civilized nations.\r\n\r\nThis document was drafted and signed by a small group of Monuments\r\nofficers at the Central Collecting Point in Wiesbaden. Before being\r\nsubmitted to Major La Farge for whatever action he deemed appropriate,\r\nit was signed by twenty-four of the thirty-two Monuments officers in the\r\nAmerican Zone. The remaining eight chose either to submit individual\r\nletters expressing similar views, or orally to express like sentiments.\r\nThe document came to be known as the “Wiesbaden Manifesto.” Army\r\nregulations forbade the publication of such a statement; hence its\r\nsubmission to Major La Farge as Chief of the MFA&A Section.\r\n\r\nFurther protests against the policy which prompted the Wiesbaden\r\nManifesto appeared in the United States a few months later. The action\r\nof our Government was sharply criticized and vigorously defended in the\r\npress. Letters to and from the State Department and a petition submitted\r\nto the President concerning the issue appear in the Appendix to this book.\r\n\r\nPreparations for the shipment—appropriately nicknamed “Westward Ho”—took\r\nprecedence over all other activities of the MFA&A office during the\r\nnext three weeks. Its size was determined soon after Colonel McBride’s\r\narrival. General Clay cabled from Washington requesting this information\r\nand the shipping date. After hastily consulting us, our Berlin office\r\nreplied that two hundred paintings could be made ready for removal within\r\nten days.\r\n\r\nThe next problem was to decide how the selection was to be made. Should\r\nthe pictures be chosen from the three Central Collecting Points—Munich,\r\nWiesbaden and Marburg? Time was short. It would be preferable to take\r\nthem from one depot. Wiesbaden was decided upon. Quality had been\r\nstressed. The best of the Kaiser Friedrich Museum pictures were at\r\nWiesbaden.\r\n\r\nThe decision to confine the selection to the one Central Collecting\r\nPoint had the additional advantage of avoiding the disruption of MFA&A\r\nwork at the other two depots, Munich and Marburg. Craig Smyth had long\r\nbeen apprehensive about “Westward Ho,” feeling that any incursion on the\r\nBavarian State Collections would be disastrous to his organization at the\r\nMunich Collecting Point. He said that his entire staff of non-Nazi museum\r\nspecialists would walk out. This would seriously impede the restitution\r\nprogram in the Eastern Military District.\r\n\r\nSo far as Marburg was concerned, I had been in the office the day Bancel\r\ntold Walker Hancock of the decision to take German-owned works of art to\r\nAmerica. Walker looked at Bancel as though he hadn’t understood him. Then\r\nhe said simply, “In that case I can’t go back to Marburg. Everything that\r\nwe were able to accomplish was possible because I had the confidence of\r\ncertain people. I can’t go back and tell them that I have betrayed them.”\r\n\r\nAnd he hadn’t gone back to Marburg. Instead he went to Heidelberg for\r\ntwo days without telling anyone where he was going. When he finally\r\nreturned, it was only to close up his work at Marburg, in the course of\r\nwhich he undertook to explain as best he could to Professor Hamann, the\r\ndistinguished old German scholar with whom he had been associated, the\r\ndecision concerning the removal of the pictures. “I quoted the official\r\nstatement,” Walker said, “about the paintings being held in trust for the\r\nGerman people and added that there was no reason to doubt it. Very slowly\r\nhe said, ‘If they take our old art, we must try to create a fine new\r\nart.’ Then, after a long pause, he added,’I never thought they would take\r\nthem.’”\r\n\r\nOnce it had been decided to limit selection of the paintings to the\r\nWiesbaden Collecting Point, there arose the question of appointing an\r\nofficer properly qualified to handle the job. It called for speed,\r\ndiscrimination and an expert knowledge of packing. There was a ten-day\r\ndeadline to be met. Two hundred pictures had to be chosen. And the\r\npacking would have to be done with meticulous care. We considered\r\nthe possibilities. Captain Walter Farmer couldn’t be spared from his\r\nduties as director of the Collecting Point. Lieutenant Samuel Ratensky,\r\nMonuments officer for Greater Hesse, was an architect, not a museum man.\r\nCaptain Joseph Kelleher was one of our ablest officers; but he was just\r\nout of the hospital where he had been laid up for three months with a\r\nbroken hip. The doctor had released him on condition that he be given\r\neasy assignments for the next few weeks.\r\n\r\nAt this critical juncture, Lamont Moore telephoned from Munich. He and\r\nSteve had just completed the evacuation of the mine at Alt Aussee. Lamont\r\nsaid that they were coming up to Frankfurt. Steve had enough points to\r\ngo home—enough and to spare. Lamont thought he’d take some leave. Bancel\r\nsignaled from the opposite desk. I told Lamont to forget about the leave;\r\nthat we had a job for him. Bancel sighed with relief. Lamont’s was a\r\ndifferent kind of sigh.\r\n\r\nLamont’s arrival was providential. Aside from his obvious qualifications\r\nfor the Wiesbaden assignment, he and Colonel McBride were old friends\r\nfrom the National Gallery where, as I have mentioned before, Lamont had\r\nbeen director of the educational program. The colonel was content to\r\nleave everything in his hands. Lamont and I spent an evening together\r\nstudying a list of the pictures stored at Wiesbaden. He typed out a\r\ntentative selection. The next day he and the colonel went over to the\r\nCollecting Point for a preliminary inspection.\r\n\r\nSteve was momentarily tempted by the prospect of having a part in\r\nthe undertaking. But when I told him there was a chance of his being\r\nincluded in a draft of officers scheduled for immediate redeployment,\r\nhe decided that he’d had his share of packing. Maybe he’d come back in\r\nthe spring, if there was work still to be done. His parting gift was the\r\nMercedes-Benz, a temporary legacy, as it turned out: two weeks later\r\nthe car was stolen from the motor pool where I had left it for minor\r\nrepairs. Steve didn’t like the idea of having to wait at a processing\r\ncenter before proceeding to his port of embarkation. He cheered up when\r\nhe learned that he was headed for one near Marburg. He went off in high\r\nspirits at the prospect of seeing his old friend Walker Hancock again.\r\n\r\nUnder Lamont’s skillful supervision, preparations for the shipment\r\nproceeded according to schedule. Lamont chose Captain Kelleher as his\r\nassistant. Together they located the cases from Captain Farmer’s records.\r\nOnly a few of the Kaiser Friedrich pictures had been taken out of the\r\ncases in which they had been originally packed for removal from Berlin to\r\nthe Merkers mine. The larger cases contained as many as a dozen pictures.\r\nIt was slow work opening the cases and withdrawing a particular canvas\r\nfor repacking. Seldom were any two of the specified two hundred paintings\r\nin a single case. When they were all finally assembled, each one was\r\nphotographed. In the midst of the proceedings, the supply of film and\r\npaper ran out. The nearest replacements were at Mannheim. A day was lost\r\nin obtaining the necessary authorization to requisition fresh supplies.\r\nIt took the better part of another day to make the trip to Mannheim and\r\nback. Thanks to Lamont’s careful calculations, maximum use was made\r\nof the original cases in repacking the two hundred paintings after a\r\nphotographic record had been made of their condition.\r\n\r\nWhile these operations were in progress, detailed plans for the actual\r\nshipment of the paintings had to be worked out. Colonel McBride and\r\nBancel took up the matter of shipping space with General Ross, Chief of\r\nTransportation. Sailing schedules were consulted. An Army transport, the\r\n_James Parker_, was selected. As an alternative, temporary consideration\r\nwas given to the idea of trucking the pictures to Bremen and sending\r\nthem by a Naval vessel from there. But the Bremen sailing schedules were\r\nunsatisfactory. A special metal car was requisitioned to transport the\r\ncases from Frankfurt, by way of Paris, to Le Havre. A twenty-four-hour\r\nguard detail was appointed to accompany the car from Frankfurt to the\r\nship. Trucks and escort vehicles were procured for the twenty-five-mile\r\ntrip from Wiesbaden to the Frankfurt rail yards.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that Lamont should be responsible for delivering the\r\npictures to the National Gallery in Washington where they were to be\r\nplaced in storage. Bancel drafted the orders. He worked on them a full\r\nday. It took two more days to have them cut. They were unique in one\r\nrespect: Lamont, a second lieutenant, was appointed officer-in-charge.\r\nHis designated assistant was a commander in the Navy. This was Commander\r\nKeith Merrill, an old friend of Colonel McBride’s, who happened to be\r\nin Frankfurt. He offered his services to the colonel and subsequently\r\ncrossed on the _James Parker_ with Lamont and the pictures.\r\n\r\nLamont and Joe Kelleher finished the packing one day ahead of schedule.\r\nThe forty-five cases, lined with waterproof paper, were delivered to the\r\nFrankfurt rail yards and loaded onto the car. From there the car was\r\nswitched to the station and attached to the night train for Paris.\r\n\r\nBancel and I returned to the office to take up where we had left off.\r\nAs usual, Edith Standen had taken care of everything while we had been\r\npreoccupied with the “Westward Ho” shipment. There had been no major\r\ncrises. Judging from the weekly field reports, restitution to the Dutch\r\nand the French was proceeding without interruption. Edith produced a\r\nstack of miscellaneous notations: The Belgian representative had arrived\r\nin Munich. The Stockholm Museum had offered a supply of lumber to be used\r\nin repairing war-damaged German buildings of cultural importance. There\r\nhad been two inquiries concerning a modification of Law 52 (the Military\r\nGovernment regulation which forbade trafficking in works of art). A\r\nreport from Würzburg indicated that emergency repairs to the roof of the\r\nResidenz were nearing completion. Lieutenant Rorimer had called from\r\nHeidelberg about the books at Offenbach.\r\n\r\nOf all the problems which confronted the MFA&A Section, none was more\r\nbaffling than that of the books at Offenbach. There were more than two\r\nmillion of them. They had been assembled from Jewish libraries throughout\r\nEurope by the _Institut zur Erforschung der Judenfrage_—Institute for\r\nthe Investigation of the Jewish Question—at Frankfurt. At the close of\r\nthe war, a small part of the collection was found in a large private\r\nhouse in Frankfurt. The rest was discovered in a repository to the north\r\nof the city, at Hungen. The house in Frankfurt had been bombed, leaving\r\nundamaged only the books stored in the cellar. One hundred and twenty\r\nthousand volumes were removed from the damp cellar to the Rothschild\r\nLibrary, which, though damaged, was still intact. Examination of this\r\nportion of the collection revealed that it contained more than sixty\r\nlibraries looted from occupied countries. Subsequently, the rest of\r\nthe collection was transferred from Hungen to an enormous warehouse at\r\nOffenbach, across the river from Frankfurt. The ultimate disposition\r\nof this library—probably the greatest of its kind in the world—was the\r\nsubject of heated discussions, both written and oral. Several leading\r\nJewish scholars had expressed the hope that it could be kept together\r\nand eventually established in some center of international study. Our\r\nimmediate responsibility was the care of the books in their two present\r\nlocations. That alone was exceedingly difficult. It would take months,\r\nperhaps years, to make an inventory.\r\n\r\nJudge Samuel Rifkind, General Clay’s Adviser on Jewish Affairs, had\r\nrequested that twenty-five thousand volumes be made available for\r\ndistribution among the DP camps. I referred the request to the two\r\narchivists who had recently joined our staff, Paul Vanderbilt and Edgar\r\nBreitenbach. While I sympathized with the tragic plight of the Jewish\r\nDPs, there were the unidentified legal owners of the books to be taken\r\ninto account. One of our archivists felt that we should accede to the\r\njudge’s request; the other disagreed. The matter was referred to Berlin\r\nfor a decision. After several weeks, we received word from Berlin that no\r\nbooks were to be released. The judge persisted. Ten days later, Berlin\r\nreconsidered. The books could be released—that is, twenty-five thousand\r\nof them—on condition that no rare or irreplaceable volumes were included\r\nin the selection. Also, the volumes chosen were to be listed on a custody\r\nreceipt. Up to the time of my departure from Frankfurt, no books had been\r\nreleased.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of November, we concentrated on future personnel\r\nrequirements for the MFA&A program in the American Zone. Current\r\ndirectives indicated that drastic reductions in Military Government\r\ninstallations throughout the Zone could be expected in the course of the\r\nnext six or eight months. Already we had begun to feel the impact of the\r\nArmy’s accelerated redeployment program. Bancel and I took stock of our\r\npresent resources. We had lost four officers and three enlisted men since\r\nthe first of the month. To offset them, we had gained two civilians; but\r\nthey were archivists, urgently needed in a specialized field of our work.\r\nWe couldn’t count on them as replacements.\r\n\r\nWe drew up a chart showing the principal MFA&A offices and depots in each\r\nof the three _Länder_. In Bavaria, for example, there were at Munich\r\nthe _Land_ office and the Central Collecting Point; a newly-established\r\nArchival Collecting Point at Oberammergau and the auxiliary collecting\r\npoint at Bamberg; and two secondary offices, one in Upper Bavaria,\r\nanother in Lower Bavaria. In Greater Hesse, there were the _Land_ office\r\nand the Central Collecting Point at Wiesbaden; the offices at Frankfurt\r\nand Kassel; and the Collecting Points at Offenbach and Marburg. In\r\nWürttemberg-Baden, the smallest of the three _Länder_, the _Land_ office\r\nwas at Stuttgart. There was a secondary one at Karlsruhe. The principal\r\nrepositories, requiring MFA&A supervision, were the great mines at\r\nHeilbronn and Kochendorf.\r\n\r\nWe hoped that certain of these establishments could be closed out in a\r\nfew months; others would continue to operate for an indefinite period. We\r\nregarded the _Land_ offices as permanent; likewise the Collecting Points,\r\nwith the exception of Marburg. And Marburg would have to be maintained\r\nuntil it had been thoroughly sifted for loot, or until we received\r\nauthorization to effect interzonal transfers. Most of the Rhineland\r\nmuseums were in the British Zone, but the collections were at Marburg.\r\nThe British had requested their return. Until our Berlin office approved\r\nthe request, we could do nothing.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to make an accurate forecast of our personnel\r\nneeds. Nevertheless we entered on the chart tentative reductions\r\nwith accompanying dates. The chart would serve as a basic guide in\r\nthe allocation of civilian positions when the conversion program got\r\nseriously under way. A number of our officers had already signified their\r\nintentions of converting to civilian status, if the promised program ever\r\nmaterialized.\r\n\r\nEarly in December, Bancel went home on thirty-days’ leave. Allowing two\r\nweeks for transportation each way, he would be gone about two months.\r\nIn his absence, I was Acting Chief of the Section. Under the Navy’s new\r\npoint system, I had been eligible for release on the first of November,\r\nbut had requested an extension of active duty in anticipation of Bancel’s\r\ndeparture. I was not looking forward with enthusiasm to the period of his\r\nabsence, because of the personnel problems which lay ahead.\r\n\r\nMy apprehensions were justified. Our chart, based on a realistic concept\r\nof the work yet to be done, was rejected by the Personnel Section. I was\r\ntold that each _Land_ would draw up its own T.O. (Table of Organization).\r\nPerhaps there could be some co-ordination at a later date. Even the T.O.\r\nof our own office at USFET was thrown back at us with the discouraging\r\ncomment that the proposed civil service ratings would have to be\r\ndowngraded. During the next eight weeks there must have been a dozen\r\npersonnel conferences between the top brass of USFET and the Military\r\nGovernors of the three _Länder_, and between them and the moguls of the\r\nGroup Control Council. Not once, to my knowledge, was the MFA&A Section\r\nconsulted. For a while I exhorted applicants for civilian MFA&A jobs to\r\nbe patient; but as the weeks went by and the job allocations failed to\r\nmaterialize, applications were withdrawn. _Stars and Stripes_ contributed\r\nto my discomfort with glittering forecasts of Military Government jobs\r\npaying from seven to ten thousand dollars a year. There were positions\r\nwhich paid such salaries, but _Stars and Stripes_ might have stressed\r\nthe fact that there were many more which paid less. I remember one mousy\r\nlittle sergeant who applied for a job with us. In civilian life he had\r\nreceived a salary of twelve hundred dollars a year. On his application\r\nblank he stipulated, as the minimum he would accept, the sum of six\r\nthousand dollars.\r\n\r\nFortunately there were diversions from these endless personnel problems.\r\nEdith and I fell into the habit of going over to Wiesbaden on Saturday\r\nafternoons. It was a relief to escape from the impersonal life at our\r\nheadquarters to the friendly country atmosphere of the _Land_ and City\r\nDetachments. We were particularly fond of our Monuments officers there.\r\n\r\nThey were a dissimilar trio—Captain Farmer, Lieutenant Ratensky and\r\nCaptain Kelleher. Walter Farmer presided over the Collecting Point.\r\nWalter seldom relaxed. He was an intense fellow, jumpy in his movements,\r\nand unconsciously brusque in conversation. He was an excellent host,\r\nloved showing us about the Collecting Point—particularly his “Treasure\r\nRoom” with its wonderful medieval objects—and, at the end of a tour,\r\ninvariably produced a bottle of Tokay in his office.\r\n\r\nSam Ratensky, MFA&A officer for the _Land_, was short, slender and had\r\nred hair. In civilian life he had been associated with Frank Lloyd Wright\r\nand was deeply interested in city-planning. Sam usually looked harassed,\r\nbut his patience and understanding were inexhaustible. He was accurate in\r\nhis appraisals of people and had a quiet sense of humor.\r\n\r\nJoe Kelleher, Sam’s deputy, was a “black Irishman.” The war had\r\ntemporarily interrupted his brilliant career in the Fine Arts department\r\nat Princeton. At twenty-eight, Joe had the poise, balance and tolerance\r\nof a man twice that age. With wit and charm added to these soberer\r\nqualities, he was a dangerously persuasive character. On one occasion,\r\nduring Bancel’s absence, he all but succeeded in hypnotizing our office\r\ninto assigning a disproportionate number of our best officers to the\r\nMFA&A activities of Greater Hesse. When Sam Ratensky went home in\r\nFebruary, Joe succeeded him as MFA&A officer for the _Land_. He held\r\nthis post until his own release several months later. His intelligent\r\nsupervision of the work was a significant contribution to the success of\r\nthe American fine arts program in Germany.\r\n\r\nAnother Monuments officer whose visits to Wiesbaden rivaled Edith’s and\r\nmine in frequency was Captain Everett Parker Lesley, Jr. He disliked his\r\ngiven name and preferred to be called “Bill.” Lesley had been in Europe\r\nsince the invasion. He was known as the “stormy petrel” of MFA&A. And\r\nwith good reason. He was brilliant and unpredictable. A master of oral\r\nand written invective, he was terrible in his denunciation of stupidity\r\nand incompetence. During the fall months, Bill was attached to the\r\nFifteenth Army with headquarters at Bad Nauheim. This was the “paper”\r\narmy, so called because its function was the compilation of a history of\r\nthe war. Bill was writing a report of MFA&A activities during combat. He\r\nwas a virtuoso of the limerick. I was proud of my own repertoire, but\r\nBill knew all of mine and fifty more of his own composing. He usually\r\ntelephoned me at the office when he had turned out a particularly good\r\none.\r\n\r\nUpon the completion of his report for Fifteenth Army, Lesley was\r\nappointed MFA&A Officer at Frankfurt. As a part of his duties, he assumed\r\nresponsibility for the two million books at Offenbach and the Rothschild\r\nLibrary. Within a week he had submitted a report on the two depots and\r\ndrafted practical plans for their effective reorganization.\r\n\r\nWhile Walter Farmer was on leave in England before Christmas, Joe\r\nKelleher took charge of the Wiesbaden Collecting Point. The Dutch and\r\nFrench restitution representatives had gone home for the holidays. Joe\r\nhad the spare time to examine some of the unopened cases. He asked Edith\r\nand me to come over one evening. He said that he might have a surprise\r\nfor us. I said we’d come and asked if I might bring Colonel Kluss,\r\nChief of the Restitution Control Branch. The colonel had never seen the\r\nCollecting Point.\r\n\r\nWe drove over in the colonel’s car. After early dinner with Joe at the\r\nCity Detachment, we went down to the Collecting Point. Joe unlocked the\r\n“Treasure Room” and switched on the lights. The colonel whistled when he\r\nlooked around the room.\r\n\r\n“Those are the Polish church treasures which the Nazis swiped,” said Joe,\r\npointing casually to the gold and silver objects stacked on shelves and\r\ntables. “There’s something a lot more exciting in that box.”\r\n\r\nHe walked over to a packing case about five feet square which stood in\r\nthe center of the room. The lid had been unscrewed but was still in\r\nplace. It was marked in black letters: “Kiste 28, Aegypt. Abteilung—Bunte\r\nKönigin—Tel-el-Amarna—NICHT KIPPEN!”—Case 28, Egyptian Department—Painted\r\nQueen—Tel-el-Amarna—DON’T TILT! Joe grinned with satisfaction as I read\r\nthe markings. The Painted Queen—Queen Nefertete. This celebrated head,\r\nthe most beautiful piece of Egyptian sculpture in the world, had been one\r\nof the great treasures of the Berlin Museum. It was a momentous occasion.\r\nThere was every reason to believe that the German museum authorities\r\nhad packed the head with proper care. Even so, the case had been moved\r\naround a good deal in the meantime, first from the Merkers mine to\r\nthe vaults of the Reichsbank in Frankfurt, and then from Frankfurt to\r\nWiesbaden. There was not much point in speculating about that now. We’d\r\nknow the worst in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nJoe and I laid the lid aside. The box was filled with a white packing\r\nmaterial. At first I thought it was cotton, but it wasn’t. It was glass\r\nwool. In the very center of the box lay the head, swathed in silk paper.\r\nGingerly we lifted her from the case and placed her on a table. We\r\nunwound the silk paper. Nefertete was unharmed, and as bewitching as\r\never. She was well named: “The beautiful one is here.”\r\n\r\nWhile we studied her from every angle, Joe recounted the story of the\r\nNefertete, her discovery and subsequent abduction to Berlin. She was the\r\nwife of Akhnaton, enlightened Pharaoh of the fourteenth century B.C.\r\nThis portrait of her was excavated in the winter of 1912 by Dr. Ludwig\r\nBorchardt, famous German Egyptologist, on the site of Tel-el-Amarna,\r\nAkhnaton’s capital. In compliance with the regulations of the Egyptian\r\nGovernment, Borchardt submitted a list of his finds at Tel-el-Amarna to\r\nM. Maspero of the Cairo Museum. According to the story, Maspero merely\r\nglanced at the list, to make certain that a fifty-fifty division had\r\nbeen made, and did not actually examine the items. The head was taken to\r\nBerlin and placed in storage until after the first World War. When it was\r\nplaced on exhibition in 1920, the Egyptian Government protested loudly\r\nthat Dr. Borchardt had deceived the authorities of the Cairo Museum and\r\ndemanded the immediate return of the head. (The Egyptian Government was\r\nagain pressing its claim in March 1946.)\r\n\r\nAfter replacing Nefertete in her case, Joe showed the colonel the\r\ncollection of rare medieval treasures, including those of the Guelph\r\nFamily—patens, chalices and reliquaries of exquisite workmanship dating\r\nfrom the eleventh and twelfth centuries. With a fine sense of showmanship\r\nhe saved the most spectacular piece till the last: the famous Crown of\r\nSt. Stephen, the first Christian king of Hungary, crowned by the Pope\r\nin the year 1000. It was adorned with enamel plaques, bordered with\r\npearls and studded with great uncut gems. Joe said there was a difference\r\nof opinion among scholars as to the exact date and provenance of the\r\nenamels. The crown was surmounted by a bent gold cross. According to\r\nJoe, the cross had been bent for four hundred years and would never be\r\nstraightened. During the sixteenth century, the safety of the crown was\r\nendangered. It was entrusted to the care of a Hungarian noblewoman,\r\nwho concealed it in a compartment under the seat of her carriage. The\r\nspace was small and when the lid was closed and weighted down by the\r\noccupant of the carriage, the cross got bent. The Hungarian coronation\r\nregalia included three other pieces: a sword, an orb, and a scepter. The\r\nscepter was extremely beautiful. The stalk was of rich gold filigree and\r\nterminated in a spherical ornament of carved rock crystal. The regalia\r\nwas kept in a specially constructed iron trunk with three locks, the keys\r\nto which were entrusted to three different nobles. At the close of the\r\npresent war, American troops apprehended a Hungarian officer with the\r\ntrunk. Perhaps he was trying to safeguard the regalia as his predecessor\r\nin the sixteenth century had done. In any case, the American authorities\r\nthought they’d better relieve him of that grave responsibility.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Hungarian Crown Jewels. _Left_, the scepter. _Center_,\r\nthe celebrated Crown of St. Stephen. _Right_, the sword.

The clipping read as follows:\r\n\r\n    $80,000,000 PAINTINGS ARRIVE FROM EUROPE ON ARMY TRANSPORT\r\n\r\n    A valuable store of art, said to consist entirely of paintings\r\n    worth upward of $80,000,000, arrived here last night from\r\n    Europe in the holds of the Army transport _James Parker_.\r\n\r\n    Where the paintings came from and where they are going was a\r\n    mystery, and no Army officer on the pier at Forty-fourth Street\r\n    and North River, where the _Parker_ docked with 2,483 service\r\n    passengers, would discuss the shipment, or even admit it was on\r\n    board. It was learned elsewhere that a special detail of Army\r\n    officers was on the ship during the night to take charge of the\r\n    consignment, which will be unloaded today.\r\n\r\n    Unusual precautions were taken to keep the arrival of the\r\n    paintings secret. The canvases were included in more than forty\r\n    crates and were left untouched during the night under lock and\r\n    key.\r\n\r\n    Presumably the shipment was gathered at sites in Europe where\r\n    priceless stores of paintings and art objects stolen by the\r\n    Nazis from the countries they overran were discovered when\r\n    Allied forces broke through into Germany and the dominated\r\n    countries.\r\n\r\n    The White House announced in Washington two months ago that\r\n    shipments of art would be brought here for safekeeping, to\r\n    be kept in “trust” for the rightful owners, and the National\r\n    Gallery of Art, through its chairman, Chief Justice Harlan\r\n    Fiske Stone, was asked to provide storage and protection for\r\n    the works while they are in this country. The gallery is\r\n    equipped with controlled ventilation and expert personnel for\r\n    the storage and handling of such works.\r\n\r\n    The White House announcement gave no listing of the paintings,\r\n    but it is known that among the vast stores seized, including\r\n    caches in Italy as well as Germany, and Hermann Goering’s\r\n    famous $200,000,000 art collection, [were] included many of the\r\n    world’s art treasures and works of the masters.\r\n\r\nBy coincidence, I received that same day a copy of the New York _Times\r\nOverseas Weekly_ edition of December 9, which carried substantially the\r\nsame story, except for the fact that it stated unequivocally that the\r\npaintings shipped to America were Nazi loot.\r\n\r\nEdith and I were gravely disturbed by the inaccuracy of the statements in\r\nthese articles. Our concern was increased by the fact that the articles\r\nhad appeared in so reliable a publication as the _Times_. What could\r\nhave happened to the official press release on the subject issued on the\r\ntwenty-fourth of November when the _James Parker_ was ready to sail?[5]\r\nAnd why all the mystery? I reread the December 7 clipping. To me there\r\nwas the implication that we were shipping loot in wholesale lots to the\r\nUnited States. That would be alarming news to the countries whose stolen\r\nart works we were already returning as rapidly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe _Times_ story most emphatically called for a correction. But if\r\na statement from our office were sent through channels, it probably\r\nwouldn’t reach New York before Easter. Edith looked up from her work.\r\nThere was a glint in her eye. She asked, “Will you do me a favor? I’d\r\nlike to write the letter of correction.”\r\n\r\nI told her to go ahead. Ten minutes later she showed me the rough draft.\r\nIt covered all the points. I reworked a phrase here and there but made\r\nno important changes and, as soon as it was typed and cleared, I signed\r\nand mailed it. As published in the New York _Times_ two weeks later, on\r\nJanuary 2, 1946, the letter read as follows:\r\n\r\n                TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES\r\n\r\n    On Dec. 7 _The Times_ printed a report to the effect that\r\n    $80,000,000 worth of paintings, presumably from the stores of\r\n    art objects stolen by the Nazis, had arrived from Europe in the\r\n    Army transport James Parker. Your Overseas Weekly edition of\r\n    Dec. 9 repeated this information but stated categorically that\r\n    the paintings were Nazi loot.\r\n\r\n    It is true that the James Parker brought to America some 200\r\n    paintings of inestimable value, but none of them is loot or\r\n    of dubious ownership. They are the property of the Kaiser\r\n    Friedrich Museum in Berlin. A press release from the Office\r\n    of Military Government for Germany (U.S.), dated Nov. 24,\r\n    states that these “priceless German-owned paintings, which\r\n    might suffer irreparable damage if left in Germany through\r\n    the winter, have been selected for temporary storage in the\r\n    United States. These paintings have been gathered from various\r\n    wartime repositories in the United States Zone of Germany and\r\n    are being shipped to Washington to insure their safety and to\r\n    hold them in trust for the people of Germany. The United States\r\n    Government has promised their return to the German people.”\r\n\r\n    It cannot be stated too emphatically that the policy of the\r\n    American Military Government is to return all looted works\r\n    of art to their owner nations with the greatest possible\r\n    speed. Since the restitution in August of the famous van Eyck\r\n    altarpiece, “The Mystic Lamb,” to Belgium, a steady stream of\r\n    paintings, sculpture, fine furniture and other art objects\r\n    has poured from the highly organized collecting points of the\r\n    United States Zone to the liberated countries. Few, if any,\r\n    looted works of art of any importance are of unknown origin;\r\n    and though, among the vast masses of material taken from the\r\n    Jews and other “enemies of the state” for what was always\r\n    described as “safekeeping” there will undoubtedly be many\r\n    pieces whose ownership will be difficult to determine, it\r\n    appears unlikely that these will be found to be of great value.\r\n\r\n    The shipment of German-owned paintings to the United States is\r\n    thus a project entirely separate from the main objectives of\r\n    the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Section of the Office\r\n    of Military Government—namely, the restitution of loot and\r\n    the re-establishment of the German museums and other cultural\r\n    organizations. To confuse this shipment, which was directed by\r\n    the highest national authority, with what is now the routine\r\n    work of preservation, identification and restitution performed\r\n    by trained specialist personnel is to mislead our Allies\r\n    and to underrate the accomplishments of a small group of\r\n    disinterested and hard-working Americans.\r\n\r\n                                                 Thomas C. Howe Jr.\r\n\r\n                        Lieut. Comdr., USNR, Deputy Chief; Director\r\n                                 on Leave, California Palace of the\r\n                                    Legion of Honor, San Francisco.\r\n\r\n                                   European Theatre, Dec. 18, 1945.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Section of\r\nAmerican Military Government in Germany were defined in my letter to the\r\nNew York _Times_ as “the restitution of loot and the re-establishment\r\nof the German museums and other cultural institutions.” Honorable and\r\nconstructive objectives. And, as expressed in that letter, unequivocal\r\nand reassuring both to the liberated countries of Europe and to the\r\nGermans. Yet how difficult of attainment! How difficult even to keep\r\nthose objectives clearly in mind when confronted simultaneously—as our\r\nofficers often were—with a dozen problems of equal urgency!\r\n\r\nAt close range it was impossible to look objectively at the overall\r\nrecord of our accomplishments. But homeward bound in February I had that\r\nopportunity. The pieces of the puzzle began to fit together and the\r\npicture took shape. It was possible to determine to what extent we have\r\nrealized our objectives.\r\n\r\nSo far as restitution is concerned, the record has been a success. During\r\nthe summer months our energies were devoted to obvious preliminary\r\npreparations. They included the establishment of Central Collecting\r\nPoints at Munich, Marburg and Wiesbaden. Immediately thereafter, the\r\ncontents of art repositories in the American Zone were removed to those\r\ncentral depots. The Central Collecting Points, organized and directed by\r\nMonuments officers with museum experience, were staffed with trained\r\npersonnel from German museums. The one at Munich was primarily reserved\r\nfor looted art, since the majority of the cultural booty was found in\r\nBavaria. The Collecting Points at Wiesbaden and Marburg, on the other\r\nhand, housed German-owned collections brought from repositories in which\r\nstorage conditions were unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe process of actual restitution was inaugurated by token restitutions\r\nin the name of General Eisenhower to Belgium, Holland, France and\r\nCzechoslovakia. Circumstances beyond our control postponed similar\r\ngestures of good will to Poland and Greece. Representatives of the\r\nliberated countries were invited to the American Zone to identify and\r\nremove the loot from the collecting points. According to late reports,\r\nthe restitution of loot was continuing without interruption.\r\n\r\nShortly after my return, there were disquieting rumors of drastic\r\nreductions in American personnel connected with cultural restitution in\r\nGermany. I earnestly hope that these rumors are without foundation. Such\r\nreductions would be disastrous to the completion of a program which has\r\nreflected so creditably on our government.\r\n\r\nThe re-establishment of German museums and other cultural\r\ninstitutions—our second main objective—has been, to a large extent,\r\nsacrificed in the interests of restitution. This brings up again the\r\nurgent need for the immediate replenishment of our dwindling Fine Arts\r\npersonnel in Germany. Our moral responsibility for the continuation of\r\nthis phase of the MFA&A program is a grave one. It was understandably\r\nneglected during the first six months of our occupation in Germany.\r\nAnd it would be unfair to argue that the British have far outdistanced\r\nus in this field. That they have done so is undeniably true. However,\r\nthe British found but little loot in their zone. Consequently, they\r\nhave been able to make rapid strides in the reconstitution of German\r\ncollections and cultural institutions, while we have been preoccupied\r\nwith restitution.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that preoccupation, our Monuments officers were\r\ninstrumental in arranging a series of impressive exhibitions of\r\nGerman-owned masterpieces. The first of these was held at Marburg in\r\nNovember 1945. A second and more ambitious show, which included many of\r\nthe finest treasures of the Bavarian State Galleries, opened at Munich\r\nin January 1946. A third, comprising paintings and sculptures from the\r\nmuseums of Berlin and Frankfurt, was presented at Wiesbaden in February.\r\n\r\nAll these exhibitions were accompanied by catalogues with German and\r\nEnglish texts. Those of Munich and Wiesbaden were lavishly illustrated.\r\nThe Munich catalogue contained several plates showing the rooms in which\r\nthe exhibition was held—lofty, spacious galleries recalling the marble\r\nhalls of our own National Gallery at Washington.\r\n\r\nAt the time of my departure from Germany, little was known of French\r\nand Russian procedures with regard to cultural rehabilitation in their\r\nrespective zones of occupation. Their Military Governments have made\r\nprovisions for personnel capable of carrying on work similar to ours and\r\nthat of the British.\r\n\r\nThe caliber of the men drawn into the project from all branches of\r\nour Armed Forces has been cited as an important factor in the success\r\nof the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives program. I would like to\r\ncite another factor which I consider equally important: There was no\r\narbitrary drafting of personnel; participation was voluntary. The\r\nresulting spontaneity and its value to the spirit of the work cannot be\r\nexaggerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is the complete list of

Lee, President of the College Art\r\nAssociation of America, sent the following letter to the Secretary of\r\nState:\r\n\r\n    My dear Mr. Secretary:\r\n\r\n    The members of the College Art Association of America,\r\n    a constituent member of the American Council of Learned\r\n    Societies, have been disturbed by the removal to this country\r\n    of works of art from Berlin museums.\r\n\r\n    Information that we have received from abroad leads us to\r\n    believe that the integrity of United States policy has been\r\n    questioned as a result of this action. We have also been\r\n    informed that adequate facilities and American personnel now\r\n    exist in the American zone in Germany to assure the proper care\r\n    of art treasures in that area.\r\n\r\n    We would therefore urge that the department of State clarify\r\n    this action, and would strongly recommend that assurances be\r\n    given that no further shipments are contemplated.\r\n\r\nCopies of this letter were sent to members of the American Commission\r\nfor the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historic Monuments in War\r\nAreas.\r\n\r\nThe State Department replied on January 25:\r\n\r\n    My Dear Mr. Lee:\r\n\r\n    Your letter of January 15, urging the Department to clarify the\r\n    action taken in removing to the United States certain works of\r\n    art from German museums, has been received. In the absence of\r\n    the Secretary, I am replying to your letter and am glad to give\r\n    you additional information on this question.\r\n\r\n    The decision to remove these works of art to this country\r\n    was made on the basis of a statement by General Clay that he\r\n    did not have adequate facilities and personnel to safeguard\r\n    German art treasures and that he could not undertake the\r\n    responsibility of their proper care.\r\n\r\n    You indicated in your letter that you have been informed that\r\n    adequate facilities and personnel now exist in the American\r\n    zone for the protection of these art treasures. I must\r\n    inform you that our information, based upon three separate\r\n    investigations, is precisely to the contrary. The redeployment\r\n    program has, as you no doubt realize, reduced American\r\n    personnel in Germany and this reduction is applied to arts and\r\n    monuments and this personnel as well as to other branches.\r\n\r\n    The coal situation in Germany is critical and has made it\r\n    impossible to provide heat for the museums. General Clay cannot\r\n    be expected to provide heat for the museums if that means\r\n    taking it away from American forces, from hospitals, or from\r\n    essential utility needs.\r\n\r\n    We are furthermore advised that the security situation was not\r\n    such as to ensure adequate protection in Germany. In short, the\r\n    Department’s information is such that it cannot agree with your\r\n    premise.\r\n\r\n    It was realized that the “integrity of United States policy”\r\n    might be questioned by some if these works of art were removed\r\n    to this country. After a careful review of the facts, it was\r\n    decided that the most important aspect was to safeguard these\r\n    priceless treasures by bringing them to this country where they\r\n    could be properly cared for. It was hoped that the President’s\r\n    pledge that they would be returned to Germany would satisfy\r\n    those who might be critical of this Government’s motives.\r\n\r\n                         Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                 For the Acting Secretary of State:\r\n                                 James W. Riddleberger\r\n                                 Chief, Division of\r\n                                 Central European Affairs[6]\r\n\r\nIn April the author of this book received from Frederick Mortimer\r\nClapp, director of the Frick Collection, New York, the following letter\r\nregarding the removal of German-owned works of art to this country. A\r\ncopy of the resolution which accompanied this letter and a list of those\r\nwho subsequently signed the resolution are also printed below.\r\n\r\n                                              1 East 70th Street\r\n                                              New York 21, New York\r\n                                              April 24, 1946\r\n\r\n    Dear\r\n\r\n    Since we believe that it is impossible to defend on technical,\r\n    political or moral grounds the decision to ship to this country\r\n    two hundred internationally known and extremely valuable\r\n    pictures belonging indisputably, by prewar gift or purchase,\r\n    to German institutions, notably the Kaiser Friedrich Museum of\r\n    Berlin, we propose to memorialize the President in a resolution\r\n    to be signed by a group of like-minded people interested in or\r\n    associated with the arts.\r\n\r\n    We also intend to point out that no reason can be found for\r\n    even temporarily alienating these works of art from the country\r\n    to which legally they belong.\r\n\r\n    We represent no organized movement or institution. We merely\r\n    wish as American citizens to go on record by appealing to our\r\n    government to set right an ill considered action arising from\r\n    an error of judgment which, however disinterested in intention,\r\n    has already done much to weaken our national condemnation of\r\n    German sequestrations of the artistic heritage or possessions\r\n    of other nations under the subterfuge of “protective custody,”\r\n    or openly as loot.\r\n\r\n    The moral foundations of our war effort and final victories\r\n    will be subtly undermined if we, who understand the\r\n    implications, pass over in silence an action taken by our\r\n    own officials that, in outward appearance at least cannot be\r\n    distinguished from those, detestable to all right thinking\r\n    people, which the Nazis’ policy of pillage inspired and\r\n    condoned.\r\n\r\n    The Monuments Officers attached to our armed forces with\r\n    their specialized knowledge of the practical risks involved\r\n    unanimously condemned the decision. Those Americans whose\r\n    profession it is to study and preserve old paintings deplore\r\n    it. On ethical grounds it is disapproved by the opinion of\r\n    enlightened laymen.\r\n\r\n    We therefore consider the protest we will make to be our plain\r\n    and simple duty, for it is our considered judgment that no\r\n    explanation or excuse acceptable to the public conscience can\r\n    be found for sending fragile old masters across the sea to this\r\n    country. The physical hazards, the momentous responsibilities\r\n    and the intellectual ambiguities inherent in such an act are\r\n    only too grossly evident. The historical repercussions that\r\n    will follow it can be imagined in the light of past situations\r\n    of a similar kind. It is well known that the Nazis inculcated\r\n    in the German mind a fanatical belief that we are destructive\r\n    barbarians. All future deterioration of these pictures will\r\n    now, rightly or wrongly, be laid at our door.\r\n\r\n    We should be glad if you would care to join us and others, who\r\n    have already expressed to us their sense of the unjustified\r\n    impropriety of the action to which we refer in demanding the\r\n    immediate return to Germany of these panels and canvasses,\r\n    the cancellation of all plans to exhibit them in this country\r\n    and the countermanding at once of any contemplated further\r\n    shipments.\r\n\r\n    The text of the proposed resolution is enclosed. As one of the\r\n    principal reasons for submitting it to our government is to\r\n    forestall further action of a similar kind with reference to\r\n    pictures or objects of art belonging to German museums, as well\r\n    as to rectify the existing situation, may I earnestly request\r\n    you to signify your approval, if you are so minded, by signing\r\n    the resolution and returning it to me before May 6.\r\n\r\n                         Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                  Signed: FREDERICK MORTIMER CLAPP.\r\n\r\nOn May 9, 1946, Dr. Clapp and Mrs. Juliana Force, director of the Whitney\r\nMuseum, sent President Truman the following resolution, a copy of which\r\nwas enclosed with the above letter:\r\n\r\n                            RESOLUTION\r\n\r\n    WHEREAS in all civilized countries one of the most significant\r\n    public reactions during the recent war was the horrified\r\n    indignation caused by the surreptitious or brazen looting\r\n    of works of art by German officials in countries they had\r\n    conquered;\r\n\r\n    AND WHEREAS that indignation and abhorrence on the part of free\r\n    peoples was a powerful ingredient in the ardor and unanimity\r\n    of their support of the war effort of democratically governed\r\n    states in which the private opinions of citizens are the source\r\n    and controlling directive of official action;\r\n\r\n    AND WHEREAS two hundred important and valuable pictures\r\n    belonging to the Kaiser Friedrich and other Berlin museums have\r\n    been removed from Germany and sent to this country on the still\r\n    unestablished ground of ensuring their safety;\r\n\r\n    AND WHEREAS it is apparent that disinterested and intelligent\r\n    people believe that this action cannot be justified on\r\n    technical, political or moral grounds and that many, including\r\n    the Germans themselves, may find it hard to distinguish between\r\n    the resultant situation and the “protective custody” used by\r\n    the Nazis as a camouflage for the sequestration of the artistic\r\n    treasures of other countries;\r\n\r\n    BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that we, the undersigned, respectfully\r\n    request the President to order the immediate safe return to\r\n    Germany of the aforesaid paintings, the cancellation of any\r\n    plans that may have been made to exhibit them in this country\r\n    and the countermanding without delay of any further shipments\r\n    of the kind that may have been contemplated.\r\n\r\n    This resolution was signed by:\r\n\r\n        Abbott, Jere\r\n          Director\r\n          Smith College Museum of Art\r\n          Northampton, Mass.\r\n\r\n        Abbott, John E.\r\n          Executive Vice-President\r\n          The Museum of Modern Art\r\n          New York, N.Y.\r\n\r\n        Adams, Philip R.\r\n          Director\r\n          Cincinnati Museum\r\n          Cincinnati, Ohio\r\n\r\n        Barber, Professor Leila\r\n          Vassar College\r\n          Poughkeepsie, N.

ROBERTS, CHAIRMAN.\r\n\r\n    National Gallery of Art, Washington 25, D. C.\r\n\r\n    WASHINGTON, May 14, 1946: The members of the Commission have\r\n    received copies of a resolution signed by Dr. Frederick M.\r\n    Clapp, Director of the Frick Collection; Mrs. Juliana Force,\r\n    Director of the Whitney Museum of American Art, and others\r\n    who criticize the action of the United States Government,\r\n    taken at the Direction of the President and the United States\r\n    Army Command in Germany, in bringing to this country certain\r\n    paintings from German museums for safekeeping until conditions\r\n    in Germany warrant their return. The Clapp resolution compares\r\n    the action taken by the United States Government to looting\r\n    operations carried on by the Nazis during the war.\r\n\r\n    The Commission has also noted the statements issued by the\r\n    White House on September 26, 1945, and by the War Department\r\n    on December 6, 1945, that the works of art of bona fide\r\n    German ownership, which may be brought to this country for\r\n    safekeeping, will be kept in trust for the German people and\r\n    will be returned to Germany when conditions there warrant.\r\n\r\n    The Commission has also noted the statement issued by the\r\n    late Chief Justice Stone, Chairman of the Board of Trustees\r\n    of the National Gallery of Art, on December 14, 1945, that\r\n    the Trustees of the National Gallery, at the request of the\r\n    Secretary of State, had agreed to arrange for the storage space\r\n    for such paintings as might be brought to this country by\r\n    the United States Army for safekeeping, and that he felt the\r\n    Army “deserved the highest praise for the care exercised in\r\n    salvaging these great works of art and in making provisions for\r\n    their safety until they can be returned to Germany.”\r\n\r\n    The Commission accepts without reservation the promise of the\r\n    United States Government, as voiced by its highest officials,\r\n    that the works of art belonging to German museums and brought\r\n    to this country for safekeeping, will be returned to Germany\r\n    when conditions there warrant.\r\n\r\n    The Commission is strongly of the opinion that the resolution\r\n    sponsored by Dr. Clapp, Mrs. Force, and others is without\r\n    justification and is to be deplored.\r\n\r\n        Hon.

Clapp, Director, The\r\n    Frick Collection, with which you enclosed a resolution signed\r\n    by ninety-five of your colleagues in connection with the two\r\n    hundred valuable paintings removed from Germany to this country\r\n    for safekeeping.\r\n\r\n    These paintings were removed to this country last year on the\r\n    basis of information to the effect that adequate facilities and\r\n    personnel to ensure their safekeeping did not exist in Germany.\r\n    Our military authorities did not feel that they could take the\r\n    responsibility of safeguarding them under such conditions and\r\n    it was therefore decided that they would have to be shipped to\r\n    this country until such time as they could safely be returned\r\n    to Germany. It was realized at the time that this action might\r\n    lead to criticism but it was taken, nevertheless, because it\r\n    was considered that the most important aspect was to safeguard\r\n    these priceless treasures. It was hoped that the President’s\r\n    pledge that they would be returned to Germany, contained in a\r\n    White House press release on September 26, 1945, would satisfy\r\n    those who might be critical of this Government’s motives.\r\n\r\n    I know of no plans to make any further shipments of art objects\r\n    from Germany to the United States nor of any plans for the\r\n    exhibition of the two hundred paintings now in this country.\r\n    While a definite date for the return of these pictures has not\r\n    as yet been set, I can assure you that this Government will\r\n    honor its pledge to effect their return as soon as conditions\r\n    warrant.\r\n\r\n                       Very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                        (signed) William D. Hassett\r\n                                        Secretary to the President.\r\n\r\n                        DEPARTMENT OF STATE\r\n\r\n                                                       Washington\r\n                                                       May 22, 1946\r\n\r\n    My dear Mrs. Force and Dr. Clapp:\r\n\r\n    I have received your letter of May 9, 1946, and its enclosed\r\n    resolution, signed by 95 of your colleagues, urging the\r\n    President to order the immediate safe return to Germany of the\r\n    200 paintings which were brought to this country last year.\r\n\r\n    When these paintings were found by our forces in southern\r\n    Germany every effort was made to assure their preservation. It\r\n    soon became evident that adequate facilities and personnel to\r\n    ensure their safe keeping could not be guaranteed. Consequently\r\n    our military authorities, realizing the magnitude of their\r\n    responsibility in preserving these priceless treasures,\r\n    requested that they be relieved of this heavy responsibility\r\n    and that the paintings be shipped to this country where they\r\n    could be properly cared for. This Government reluctantly gave\r\n    its approval to this request, knowing that such action would\r\n    lead to criticism of its motives. The decision was taken\r\n    because there seemed no other way to ensure preservation of\r\n    these unique works of art. In order to dispel doubts as to the\r\n    reasons for this action the White House released a statement to\r\n    the press on September 26, 1945, which explained the situation\r\n    and included a pledge that the paintings would be returned to\r\n    their rightful owners. That pledge still holds good and while\r\n    a definite date for the return of the paintings to Germany has\r\n    not as yet been set, you may rest assured that this will be\r\n    done as soon as conditions warrant.\r\n\r\n    The resolution also recommended that plans to exhibit\r\n    these paintings in this country be cancelled and that\r\n    further shipments of German works of art to this country\r\n    be countermanded. I have never heard of any plans to make\r\n    additional shipments of works of art from Germany to the United\r\n    States nor do I know of any plans to exhibit the paintings\r\n    which are now in this country.\r\n\r\n                         Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                        For the Secretary of State:\r\n                                              (signed) Dean Acheson\r\n                                                   Under Secretary.\r\n\r\nFollowing are Dr. Clapp’s and Mrs. Force’s replies, also released on June\r\n10:\r\n\r\n                                                       June 3, 1946\r\n\r\n    My dear Mr. President:\r\n\r\n    Permit us to thank you for your kind attention to the\r\n    resolution, signed by us and ninety-five of our colleagues\r\n    prominent on the staffs of museums or experts in the history\r\n    and preservation of art, relative to the shipment to this\r\n    country of two hundred famous paintings formerly in the Kaiser\r\n    Friedrich and other museums of Berlin.\r\n\r\n    In addressing the resolution in question to you we felt that\r\n    we were following the time-honored American custom of bringing\r\n    to our government’s attention a consensus of opinion on the\r\n    part of those who have special practical familiarity with\r\n    old pictures and personal, sometimes long, acquaintance with\r\n    European history and culture in its emotional and intellectual\r\n    aspects.\r\n\r\n    Should you, in the course of events, undertake further\r\n    inquiries into the problem created by the shipment referred to\r\n    in our resolution, we shall be happy to be so informed.\r\n\r\n                        Respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                                       June 3, 1946\r\n\r\n    Dear Mr. Hassett:\r\n\r\n    In reply to your letter of the twenty-second permit us to say\r\n    that should the President make further inquiries into the\r\n    subject covered by our resolution with reference to two hundred\r\n    pictures selected chiefly from the collections of the Kaiser\r\n    Friedrich Museum and brought to this country, we should be\r\n    pleased to be kept informed.\r\n\r\n    We, and our ninety-five colleagues in museums and universities\r\n    who have had long experience with old paintings and are\r\n    interested in the history and preservation of works of art,\r\n    would also be glad to know when the pictures referred to are\r\n    returned to Germany since we are as yet uninformed whether the\r\n    conditions which are held not to warrant their return are of a\r\n    practical or a political nature.\r\n\r\n    This question obviously cannot but be uppermost in our minds\r\n    in view of the fact that present conditions in Germany are\r\n    apparently such as to warrant leaving there thousands of\r\n    German-owned works of art of great moment which belong not only\r\n    to the Kaiser Friedrich Museum but to the museums of other\r\n    cities in the American zone, including the great collection\r\n    of the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, where under satisfactory\r\n    conditions and auspices an exhibition of early German art,\r\n    including masterpieces by Dürer, Grünewald and others, is now\r\n    being held.\r\n\r\n    It is in fact one of our perplexities that we have never been\r\n    told why our officials discriminated against important pictures\r\n    and art objects (many times the number of those urgently\r\n    transported to this country for safekeeping) which were also\r\n    formerly in the Kaiser Friedrich and other museums, not\r\n    forgetting those which were in South German churches. Were they\r\n    just left to their fate?\r\n\r\n    If it were convenient at any time to pass on to the President\r\n    our continued anxieties on these important points we should be\r\n    happy to have you do so.\r\n\r\n                         Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                                       June 3, 1946\r\n\r\n    Dear Mr. Acheson:\r\n\r\n    In reply to your letter of the twenty-second with reference to\r\n    our resolution supported by the signatures of ninety-five of\r\n    our colleagues prominent in museums or experts in the history\r\n    and preservation of old masters and other works of art, permit\r\n    us to say that, in the absence of Secretary Byrnes, we took the\r\n    liberty of sending you the resolution.\r\n\r\n    We are aware of the statement released by the White House on\r\n    September 26, 1945 explaining the situation and promising to\r\n    return the pictures to Germany when conditions there should\r\n    warrant such action. We are, however, still uninformed why the\r\n    unanimous advice of the monuments officers, who had special\r\n    training and technical knowledge not only of the conditions\r\n    required for the preservation of old masters but of the certain\r\n    dangers to which journeys subject them, was disregarded.\r\n\r\n    We have also never been told whether the conditions believed\r\n    to jeopardize the safety of these important pictures were of a\r\n    practical or of a political nature. Neither do we know why, out\r\n    of the great and extensive collections of the Kaiser Friedrich\r\n    only two hundred pictures were selected nor by whom the\r\n    selection was made. More serious still no official mention has\r\n    ever been made of the fact that there were in the possession\r\n    of the other museums of Berlin and other cities, including the\r\n    famous collection of the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, as well as\r\n    in the churches of the American Zone, art objects and pictures\r\n    many times more numerous than the paintings actually brought\r\n    to this country for safekeeping. One cannot but ask: Were\r\n    satisfactory conditions found for them or were they merely left\r\n    to their fate?\r\n\r\n    These are questions that have given and still give rise to\r\n    rumors, unhappy conjectures and ambiguous interpretations which\r\n    we deplore. Unreasonably or otherwise the whole situation is\r\n    confused by implications that we feel will not be laid until\r\n    the pictures deposited in Washington have been sent back with\r\n    the least possible delay to their rightful owners on whom\r\n    devolves an unequivocable responsibility for their care and\r\n    preservation.\r\n\r\n                         Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] E(insatzstab) R(eichsleiter) R(osenberg)—Reichsleiter meaning realm\r\nleader.
