THE TREATIES AND THEIR NEGOTIATORS.\r\n\r\n    Commodore Perry's expedition, 1853-54--Townsend Harris--Count\r\n    Poutiatine--Lord Elgin--The treaties of 1858--The solidarity of\r\n    Western Powers--The practical attitude of the Japanese--Their\r\n    yielding to circumstances--The condition of the country--The\r\n    character of the people--Nagasaki--The Dutch--Their two hundred\r\n    years' imprisonment.\r\n\r\nA mystery hung over the island empire, which had been sealed against\r\nforeign intercourse for two hundred years, and its mere seclusion, apart\r\nfrom the weird romance that gilded such fragments of its history as were\r\nknown, invested the efforts to reopen the country with a romantic charm.\r\nIt was in Japan that Lord Elgin achieved the real diplomatic success of\r\nhis life, in the briefest possible time, at the least possible cost, and\r\nwith the most far-reaching consequences; for undoubtedly he hastened the\r\nentry of the Land of the Rising Sun into the family of nations.\r\n\r\nThe poetical side of the mission was done ample justice to by Laurence\r\nOliphant in his 'Narrative,' by Captain Sherard Osborn in the pages of\r\n'Blackwood,' and elsewhere. The prosaic side and the practical issues of\r\nthis rediscovery of an old world were not so clearly apprehended by them\r\nor by any other contemporary writer. The Powers of Europe and America had\r\nlong been watching for opportunities to effect an opening in the barrier,\r\nbut all tentatives proved in vain until force was resorted to. This was\r\nfirst done by the United States, whence a naval squadron under Commodore\r\nPerry appeared off the coast in 1853, repeating the visit, on a still more\r\nimposing scale, in 1854. The apparition deeply impressed the minds of\r\nthe Japanese Government and people, who, Lafcadio Hearn tells us, speak\r\nto this day of the \"black ships,\" birds of omen foreshadowing events for\r\nwhich it behoved them to prepare themselves. Black, indeed, they were,\r\ngrim of aspect, huge in bulk, and looming larger than they really were,\r\nwith their high sides, great paddle-boxes, and \"smoke-stacks.\" The ships\r\nwere armed with a few guns of such calibre and power as had not till\r\nthen been placed on any floating battery. Jonathan is never second-best\r\nin naval artillery. Commodore Perry with his three black ships, the\r\nsteamers Powhattan, Susquehanna, and Mississippi, and his squadron of\r\nsailing-vessels, opened the door of Japan--not very wide, it is true, yet\r\nso that it could never again be closed. The rudimentary treaty he made was\r\nlittle more than a covenant to supply wood and water to needy ships and\r\nto be merciful to their crews. A similar treaty was made by the English\r\nAdmiral Stirling in 1854, and it included the \"most-favoured-nation\"\r\nclause, only excepting from its application the privileges enjoyed by\r\nChina and Holland.\r\n\r\nTo carry the work forward to a more practical stage a man of affairs was\r\nrequired, and he was found in the person of Townsend Harris, who was\r\naccredited to Japan under the title of Consul-General for the United\r\nStates. Mr Harris had been nearly two years in the country when Lord\r\nElgin, with his modest escort, arrived and made his acquaintance. With\r\ninfinite patience Mr Harris had been prosecuting his negotiations,\r\nagainst wind and current, it would seem, until a propitious gale wafted\r\nhis venture into port. The black ships had gone, but another fleet more\r\nnumerous was assembled on the neighbouring coast, whence their fame had\r\nreached the secluded empire. Riding on the shoulders of the Anglo-French\r\nexploits in China, and not obscurely hinting at the prospect of the allies\r\nshortly visiting Japan, Mr Harris induced his Japanese friends to \"hurry\r\nup\" with his treaty, that it might not only serve as a model of moderation\r\nfor the other Powers when they also should come to negotiate, but provide\r\nin advance friendly mediation between them and Japan. Lord Elgin justified\r\nthe forewarnings of Mr Harris by appearing in the Bay of Yedo within a\r\nfew weeks after the signature of the American treaty.\r\n\r\nHow much both Mr Harris's treaty and the one which Lord Elgin was about\r\nto sign owed to the previous Russian negotiations cannot be estimated.\r\nAdmiral Count Poutiatine concluded a treaty in 1855, and improved it in\r\n1857, on the basis of Sir James Stirling's opening the ports of Nagasaki,\r\nHakodate, and Shimoda for ship's supplies, with sundry minor privileges.\r\nWhen Lord Elgin reached the Bay of Yedo in August 1858 he found Count\r\nPoutiatine already there with a frigate and a gunboat.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BAY OF YEDO.\r\n   _Walker & Cockerell sc._]\r\n\r\nThis convergence of the great Powers of the world upon a single object,\r\nthat of breaking down the seclusion of Japan, was clearly recognised, and\r\nits proximate effect weighed, by the Japanese statesmen of the day. Too\r\nwise to oppose an uncompromising resistance to the pressure, they employed\r\ntheir skill more profitably in deflecting its course. In accordance with\r\nthis policy, Lord Elgin's demand, backed as it was by the prestige of\r\nhis recent achievements in China, was promptly conceded, and within the\r\nshort space of fourteen days from his arrival in the bay a treaty was\r\nconcluded of the same tenor as the American, of which Lord Elgin had\r\nobtained a copy from Mr Harris, who also lent him the invaluable services\r\nof his Dutch interpreter, Mr Heusken. By the two treaties three of the\r\nchief ports of the empire were opened to foreign trade within one year,\r\nand two more at later dates. In some respects the English was an advance\r\non the American treaty. By the latter the import tariff had been reduced\r\nfrom the old Dutch rate of 35 per cent to a general rate of 5 per cent _ad\r\nvalorem_. The British treaty specifically provided that cotton and woollen\r\nmanufactured goods should be included in the class of merchandise paying\r\n5 per cent. The immunities of extra-territoriality were unreservedly\r\nconceded, and were only rescinded by the revised treaties, the first of\r\nwhich was made with Great Britain in 1894, coming into force in July 1899.\r\n\r\nOne general remark applies to all treaties made between foreign powers and\r\nChina or Japan, that the interests of each separate Power were safeguarded\r\nby the virtual solidarity which existed among them, through the operation\r\nof that convenient diplomatic save-all, the \"most-favoured-nation\" clause.\r\nThis comprehensive provision inserted in the treaties secured for all the\r\nPowers the advantages gained by any one of their number. Faith in this\r\nultimate protection may have led occasionally to slipshod negotiations.\r\nThere might even be a temptation in some cases to seek special credit\r\nfor moderation, with the foreknowledge that the exactions of any of the\r\nPowers would inure to the benefit of all. Lord Elgin wrote the simple\r\ntruth when he said that, \"as regards all these important commercial\r\nprivileges, I have to fight the battles of the Western trading nations\r\nsingle-handed.\" This feature had been particularly noticeable in the\r\nnegotiations in China, where it was so well understood that the English\r\ntreaty would be the common standard that it mattered little that the\r\nsignature of some of the others was hurried forward so as to take priority\r\nof the British in point of date. The treaty which Lord Elgin negotiated\r\nwith Japan was destined to occupy the same ruling position as the treaty\r\nwith China, and therefore it devolved upon him to make provision for all\r\nmanner of contingencies which no experience could enable him to foresee.\r\nConsidering that these treaties were drawn up with so little knowledge of\r\nthe circumstances of the country and of the future exigencies of trade,\r\nthe fact that they have stood the test of forty years' experience redounds\r\ngreatly to the credit of the negotiants.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: LORD ELGIN.]\r\n\r\nLord Elgin had to learn what a Daimio was from Count Poutiatine, who\r\nprobably had but just acquired the knowledge himself. It is strange at the\r\npresent day to read the solemn preamble, \"Her Majesty the Queen of the\r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and his Majesty the Tycoon\r\nof Japan.\" \"It was not till some time later that it was discovered that\r\nthere was a still higher power than the Shôgun,\" said Earl Russell in\r\n1865. The imperfect knowledge, however, attests the general soundness of\r\nthe principles adopted.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that on the Japanese side, also, nothing seemed\r\nwanting to render the treaty a workable instrument. The Japanese\r\nnegotiators were animated by a more practical spirit than any Chinese\r\ndiplomatist with whom foreigners had had dealings. There was no idea in\r\ntheir minds of blind obstruction; they were bent, if not upon efficient\r\nworking, at least on the minimising of friction and risk. And though it\r\nis probable, indeed quite certain, that no treaty whatever could have\r\nbeen made without substantial force in the background, intelligently\r\napprehended by the Japanese Government, yet, that being conceded, it\r\nwas clearly their object to make the best of the position in which they\r\nactually found themselves. Under no other circumstances could treaties so\r\ncomplete in detail and so effective for their purpose have been concluded.\r\n\r\nTo judge of the acts of the pioneers of foreign intercourse, or to form a\r\njust opinion of the conditions under which the treaties came into force,\r\nit would be necessary for the critic to regard the whole surroundings\r\nas a painter does his subject, not representing what he knows or may\r\nafterwards discover to be there, but considering only what actually meets\r\nhis eye. This, of course, is next to impossible in the case of Japan,\r\nwhere the transformation resulting from the contact with foreigners was\r\nso rapid and so kaleidoscopic, and while foreign knowledge of things\r\nJapanese has increased at so marvellous a rate, that only a series of\r\nmutoscopic photographs could have preserved the sequence. Opinions were\r\nat first, and for some time after, unduly affected by the preconception\r\nof a certain analogy between China and Japan founded on geographical\r\npropinquity, and in a measure on language: this bias influenced the first\r\ninflux of foreigners in 1859, who were largely drawn from the commercial\r\nports of China. Yet those who had been habituated to the manners and\r\ncustoms of the Chinese were at once struck, not by the similarities,\r\nbut by the violent contrasts, which the two peoples presented. These\r\nvisitants had left behind them filth and squalor; they met cleanliness\r\nand tidiness of an extreme type. They left behind vagueness of thought,\r\nslovenliness of action; and they encountered pedantic precision. They\r\nleft behind indifference and stolidity, with ignorance cherished as a\r\nproud possession; and they encountered a keen and intelligent appetite\r\nfor knowledge. These features met the stranger before even his ship had\r\ncast anchor, or he had set foot on shore. He soon perceived, also, that\r\nexistence was carried on under an elaborate prescription which left but\r\na narrow margin to spontaneous action, and such a minute supervision\r\nthat a sparrow could hardly cross the road without being noted by the\r\nofficial guardians of the peace; that every function, whether of official\r\nor private life, was under the undisputed control of the same vigilant\r\norganisation.[1] On entering the narrow waters approaching the harbour\r\nof Nagasaki, he would pass under forts where through a telescope he could\r\nsee guns and gunners' quarters all spick and span. If there happened to be\r\nanother vessel approaching from seaward, he would know it by the booming\r\nof two guns from the outermost fort, the signal being taken up and passed\r\non by those inland, and so all the way to Yedo. This, he learned, was\r\nthe mode of announcing to the capital the appearance of any foreign craft\r\noff the coast. On entering the inner harbour he would see boats full of\r\nmen who looked like women, pushing off to his ship; and then a posse of\r\nofficers, each armed with two sharp swords, would come on board. They,\r\nby means of a very imperfect interpreter, would at once ply the master\r\nwith questions on every conceivable subject, as if he were competing in\r\nan examination in universal knowledge. The tedious catechism, with its\r\nadmixture of seeming frivolity, would have been exasperating but for the\r\nimperturbable suavity of the catechists. Every answer was promptly, yet\r\ndeliberately, committed to writing. Such was, and is, the custom of the\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nNagasaki being still, in the first half of 1859, the gate of Japan,\r\nand the only sample of the country known to foreigners, the bright\r\nwelcome with which it greeted the new arrivals was of happy augury. It\r\nwas there, also, that the first observations of the ways of Japanese\r\ncommerce were made, for Nagasaki had carried on trade with China and\r\nwith Holland for two hundred years,--a trade which was conducted on the\r\none side by officials of the Government, who fixed the prices of the\r\ncommodities exchanged, and which was all but strangled by monopoly. The\r\nrestricted annual \"turn-over\" must have required a high percentage of\r\nprofit to support the Dutch factory, and the privilege of trading on so\r\npetty a scale seemed to be dearly bought by the perpetual imprisonment\r\nof the agents. The unfortunate Dutchmen were confined, with their whole\r\nestablishment of warehouses, residences, &c., within an area of less than\r\nthree acres of reclaimed foreshore called Deshima, thus described by Sir\r\nRutherford Alcock in 'The Capital of the Tycoon':--\r\n\r\n    A low fan-shaped strip of land, dammed out from the waters of\r\n    the bay, the handle being towards the shore and truncated. One\r\n    large wide street, with two-storeyed houses on each side, built in\r\n    European style, gives an air of great tidiness; but they look with\r\n    large hollow eyes into each other's interiors in a dismal sort of\r\n    way, as if they had been so engaged for six generations at least,\r\n    and were quite weary of the view.... But the view from the Dutch\r\n    commissioner's residence, with its quaint Japanese garden and\r\n    its fine sweep down the bay, is very charming.... There flitted\r\n    before me a vision of the solitary chiefs of the factory in long\r\n    succession taking up their present station in long rotation and\r\n    looking forward upon the fair bay with which their sight alone\r\n    may be gladdened. How often must the occupants of this lone post\r\n    have strained their eyes looking in vain for the solitary ship\r\n    bringing tidings from Europe and home!\r\n\r\nThe imprisonment of the Dutch was aggravated by many degrading conditions\r\nimposed by the Japanese Government. Their position bore some analogy to\r\nthat of the English and other foreigners in Canton previous to 1839. In\r\nboth cases the Europeans endured indignities at the hands of Asiatics for\r\nthe sake of profit, but beyond that point it is the differences rather\r\nthan the resemblances which are significant. The humiliation of the Dutch\r\nin the island of Deshima was indeed unmitigated so far as it went, but\r\nit was neither capricious nor spiteful. Once the yoke was peacefully\r\nadjusted, what remained of life to the Dutchman was made as agreeable\r\nto him as to a cockatoo in a cage. His jailors had no particular animus\r\nagainst him; they had a purpose of their own to serve in keeping open,\r\nthrough the foreigners, a channel of communication with the West, and\r\nthey had as valid reasons of State for tethering him as one may have\r\nfor tying up his ox or his ass. These purposes once served, however, the\r\nJapanese did not revel in harshness or cruelty.[2] With the Chinese it was\r\notherwise. They also had a political object in restricting the barbarians,\r\nonly they were never satisfied with its attainment, but continued heaping\r\nup insults on their victims to the utmost limits of their submissiveness.\r\n\r\nThe petty trade which the new-comers were able to do at Nagasaki was,\r\nin the beginning, managed through the existing agency of the Dutch, from\r\nwhom, however, there was nothing useful to be learned, much indeed to be\r\nunlearned; and in a few months it was the Dutch themselves who had to go\r\nto school to the interlopers. As commerce had been kept entirely in the\r\nhands of the Government officials, there had been no opportunity for the\r\nrise of any mercantile class among the natives: that was to be a product\r\nof the new era.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE OPERATION OF THE TREATIES.\r\n\r\n    Japanese preparations for trade at Yokohama--Mr Alcock's arrival\r\n    as consul-general--Assumes the rank of Minister--The situation\r\n    as he found it--The establishment of diplomatic intercourse\r\n    at the capital--The location of the foreign settlement--The\r\n    currency--The low value of gold--Its rapid exportation--Friction\r\n    caused by conditions of exchange--Efforts of Mr Alcock to set\r\n    matters right--Report by Secretary of H.B.M. Treasury--Japanese\r\n    double standard, gold and copper--Japanese courage in meeting\r\n    difficulties--The Daimios' coinage--Beginnings of trade--Amenities\r\n    of residence--The charm of the people--The two Japans, official\r\n    and non-official--Complete despotism and complete submission.\r\n\r\nThe treaties of 1858 took their proper effect at the two ports of Hakodate\r\nand Kanagawa; but the former being remote from any centre of population,\r\nand its trading resources so obviously limited, it attracted little\r\nattention in commercial circles. It was in the more southerly port that\r\nthe new foreign interests became concentrated; and it was so near the\r\ncapital--only seventeen miles distant--that the political and commercial\r\ncurrents soon acted and reacted on each other with direct, and sometimes\r\nviolent, effect. To Kanagawa, therefore, the merchants of all nations\r\ngathered in anticipation of the official opening of the port on the 1st\r\nof July 1859.\r\n\r\nWe say \"Kanagawa,\" to follow the official nomenclature, but in reality\r\nthe adventurers who came there to seek their fortunes did not land at\r\nthat place, but three miles away from it, at an obscure village called\r\nYokohama. There the Japanese Government had decided should be the\r\nfuture settlement for foreigners, and they had made costly preparations,\r\naccording to their lights, for the accommodation of the strangers. Roads\r\nwere marked out, a certain number of wooden bungalows had been run up,\r\na few shops had been opened in the quarter which was designed for native\r\noccupation, a custom-house was built, with warehouses attached, and stone\r\nlanding-places had been constructed for boats and lighters. The area thus\r\nmarked out for the native and foreign business quarter was a narrow strip\r\nalong the sea-shore, having in its flank and rear an immense lagoon, or,\r\nas it was called, \"the swamp,\" intersected by boat channels, where punting\r\nafter wildfowl provided amusement for idle foreigners. Being an inlet\r\nof the bay, the swamp made a peninsula of Yokohama, which had just been\r\nconnected with the _tokaido_, the great trunk road between the capital\r\nof the Tycoon and that of the Mikado, by a new causeway and several good\r\nbridges, admitting of boat traffic between the swamp and the sea.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the swamp, in rear of Yokohama, was a reclaimed portion\r\nwhereon was erected an extensive range of buildings connected by a\r\ncauseway with the dry land of the settlement. From its balconies there\r\nwaved pendants of cotton cloth bearing the legend, \"This place is designed\r\nfor the amusement of foreigners,\" a class of amusement of which there has\r\nnever been any lack in Japan.\r\n\r\nSuch were some of the outward and visible preparations made by the\r\nJapanese Government, on its own initiative, for the reception of the\r\nforeigners under the new treaties,--preparations which surprised and\r\nsomewhat disconcerted the representatives of the Western Governments when\r\nthey arrived on the eve of the opening of the port.\r\n\r\nMr Alcock, who had recently returned to his post as consul at Canton,\r\nwas chosen as the first representative of Great Britain in Japan, with\r\nthe rank of consul-general. As this rank placed the representative of the\r\nleading Power in an inferior position to his colleagues, and consequently\r\nderogated from the influence he could exercise on the Japanese, Mr Alcock\r\ntook it upon himself to assume the title of Plenipotentiary, placing his\r\nresignation in the hands of his Government in case they should disavow\r\nhis action. At the same time he recommended that the future British\r\nrepresentative should bear the title of Minister Resident. So far from\r\ndisavowing his action, the Government appointed him Envoy Extraordinary\r\nand Minister Plenipotentiary, a higher rank than that suggested by him,\r\nand he was authorised to at once assume the title, although so unusual\r\na proceeding as the transfer of a consular official to the diplomatic\r\nservice involved considerable delay while the needful formalities were\r\nbeing arranged. The appointment, however, was coupled with the conditions\r\nthat the step should not be made a precedent, and that it should confer\r\nno claim to future diplomatic employment in the countries of the West.\r\n\r\nMr Alcock was conveyed from China in one of her Majesty's ships,\r\narriving at the port of Nagasaki in June 1859. There he found a fleet\r\nof foreign merchantmen already in the harbour, and some fifteen British\r\nsubjects resident on shore, under the ægis of the old Dutch conventions\r\nsupplemented by more recent enactments. Mr Alcock remained some days,\r\nand having made arrangements for the carrying on of trade under the new\r\ntreaties, left a consul in charge of British interests and proceeded to\r\nYedo, where he arrived on June 26.\r\n\r\nIt is a date to be remembered as that of the practical initiation of\r\ndiplomatic intercourse with the ruling Power in Japan. The difference\r\nbetween a mission to negotiate treaties and one to carry them into effect\r\nis thus set forth by Sir Rutherford Alcock in the preface to his valuable\r\nwork, 'The Capital of the Tycoon,' in terms the simple truth of which must\r\ncommend itself to every candid reader:--\r\n\r\n    The Ambassadors Extraordinary had only to extort certain\r\n    privileges on paper; it was the business of the resident Ministers\r\n    to make of these paper-concessions realities--practical, everyday\r\n    realities. As this was the very thing the rulers of the country\r\n    had determined to prevent, it cannot be matter of wonder that\r\n    there was not, and never could be, any real accord, whatever\r\n    the outward professions of good faith and amity. Hence also it\r\n    naturally followed that, although the original negotiators were\r\n    received with smiles, and their path was strewn with flowers,\r\n    their successors had only the poisoned chalice held to their lips,\r\n    thorns in their path, and the scowl of the two-sworded braves and\r\n    Samurai to welcome them whenever they ventured to leave their\r\n    gates--while the assassin haunted their steps, and broke their\r\n    rest in the still hours of the night with fell intent to massacre.\r\n\r\nTo say the situation was novel is to say little. The forces at work in the\r\nJapanese state economy were either unknown to, or, what was perhaps even\r\nworse, misunderstood by, foreign Powers. The lurid history of previous\r\nintercourse, followed by rigid exclusion for two centuries, would have\r\nsufficed to establish one factor in the problem, the iron resolution of\r\nthe Japanese rulers. With such men neutrality or indifference was out\r\nof the question, while there was nothing as yet to indicate what was\r\nhenceforth to be the ruling motive of Japanese policy. Both parties were\r\nembarking on an unknown voyage, and the avoidance of shipwreck depended\r\nin a very large measure on the character of those who had to discover for\r\nthemselves the winds and currents, the rocks and shoals, through which\r\nthey had to steer. The leadership among the foreign Powers was tacitly\r\nassigned to Great Britain, and it was a born leader who was commissioned\r\nto represent her. Mr Alcock had had fifteen years' experience of Asiatic\r\nrelations, during which time he had proved himself the possessor of those\r\nqualities which were now in special request. These were indomitable\r\nenergy, earnestness of purpose much beyond the common run of official\r\nservice, fearlessness of responsibility, and alertness to grasp the\r\nnettle danger in order to avert greater evils, and a spirit which would\r\nneither shirk nor postpone an unpleasant duty nor tolerate lukewarmness\r\nnor dilatoriness in others. He was fifty years old--matured in character\r\nand experience, while yet in the prime of his intellectual vigour.\r\n\r\nMr Alcock arrived in Yedo Bay in time to arrange for the opening of trade\r\nat the appointed date, July 1.\r\n\r\n    Nagasaki to Yedo! Two centuries lie between these points, so\r\n    near on the map, but so far and completely separated by the\r\n    determined policy of the Japanese rulers. A policy of isolation so\r\n    effectually carried out that no foreigner, though he might under\r\n    the Dutch flag gain access to Nagasaki, could force or find his\r\n    way to the capital.\r\n\r\nSteaming up the Bay of Yedo, and leaving Kanagawa unvisited, Mr Alcock\r\nanchored as close to the capital as the depth of water would allow, and\r\nat once informed the Foreign Minister that he had come to stay. This was\r\ndone advisedly, as he has explained, to obviate all discussion as to\r\nhis place of residence, for he knew that efforts had been made--_more\r\nSinico_--through Lord Elgin to induce her Majesty's Government to\r\npostpone the residence in Yedo for a couple of years, and to keep their\r\nrepresentative at a distance. His first object was to obtain a suitable\r\nresidence for himself and the Legation staff, in which assistance was\r\ncheerfully rendered by the Government officials, as soon as they saw he\r\nwas resolved to remain in the capital. Diplomatic intercourse became thus\r\nan established fact.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the trading-port did not prove quite so simple, for the\r\nconsul-general found he had been forestalled in the choice of a site\r\nfor the merchants' residence, which the Government had, as we have seen,\r\nprepared at great expense some three miles away from Kanagawa, the port\r\nnamed in the treaty. Interpreting this hurried action of the Japanese\r\nas covering the ulterior design of segregating the foreigners from the\r\nnatives by thrusting them to a distance from the trunk road which led\r\nthrough Kanagawa, of keeping them in a kind of imprisonment like the Dutch\r\nat Deshima, and of retaining the power to stop their supplies, whether of\r\nthe materials of trade or of sustenance, Mr Alcock warmly contested the\r\naction of the Government. In the end he extorted from them the concession\r\nof a commercial site at Kanagawa itself, which, however, was never taken\r\nup. Events proved too strong for the consul-general, for the merchants\r\nof all nations as they arrived settled in Yokohama, where there was deep\r\nwater for shipping and every convenience for business. And it soon began\r\nalso to be felt that there was an element of safety in this foreign\r\nsettlement being removed from the great imperial road along which armed\r\nprocessions were continually passing to and from the capital. Within a\r\nyear the controversy had died a natural death, and Yokohama speaks for\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe second obstacle to the free course of trade was a more deep-rooted\r\none, being nothing less than that chronic bugbear of commerce and finance,\r\nthe currency. There was no circulating medium in Japan in the least\r\ndegree adequate for the service of international commerce. The trade in\r\nminiature that had been carried on in Nagasaki had been a simple exchange\r\nof commodities without the intervention of the precious metals. Mr Consul\r\nWinchester says that neither in the Dutch nor in the Chinese factories\r\nwas a Japanese coin ever seen. But the commerce inaugurated in 1859\r\ncould brook no such limitations, while the extent of its requirements\r\nwas of course absolutely unknown to the negotiators of the treaties.\r\nIn this state of doubt and ignorance on both sides it seemed that the\r\nbest temporary provision that the circumstances admitted of was for the\r\nTycoon's Government to undertake, after twelve months, to make all foreign\r\nmoney current in Japan at its natural value, and that until the expiration\r\nof that period Japanese coin should be supplied in exchange for foreign,\r\nweight for weight. Yet it was a monstrous stipulation to insert in any\r\ninternational treaty, and could never, in fact, be enforced.\r\n\r\nThe amazing laxity in this respect with which the treaties of 1858 were\r\ndrawn opened the door to unfathomed abuses in the matter of currency.\r\nThe coin which was in the minds of the American and English negotiators\r\nwas what was then current on the coast of China, the dollar, or more\r\nspecifically the Mexican dollar. Yet, as was afterwards pointed out by\r\nMr G. Arbuthnot, Secretary to her Majesty's Treasury, no provision was\r\nmade in the treaties expressly for exchanging that, but only British and\r\nAmerican money. In his opinion the Tycoon's Government might have refused\r\naltogether to receive the Mexican dollar, which was the only coin tendered\r\nto them, and thus the currency clause in the treaty would have been a dead\r\nletter from the first. But since they did not know the weakness of the\r\nground which the foreigners had chosen, they had to fight out the question\r\nunder all the disadvantages of a false position.\r\n\r\nBy the treaty provisions, then, as interpreted by both sides, the foreign\r\nmerchants who chose to import specie were to be supplied in exchange with\r\ncurrent coin of the realm whereby they could purchase the produce of the\r\ncountry without awaiting the slow and uncertain realisation of imported\r\nmerchandise. But the Japanese, apart from any question of good faith,\r\nhad vastly under-estimated the demand which this agreement was to make on\r\ntheir mintage resources. They could only supply tens where thousands were\r\nrequired, and in consequence of their scarcity native silver coins were\r\nsoon run up to a high premium. These coins were needed not alone for the\r\npurchase of produce, but for the more lucrative investment in the gold\r\ncoinage of the country; for an extraordinary anomaly presented itself to\r\nthe foreign traders in the relative value of silver and gold in Japan. The\r\nratio between the two metals throughout the commercial world was at that\r\ntime about fifteen to one, but in Japan, owing partly to the fact that\r\nthe silver _ichibu_ was a token coin, and yet interchangeable, weight for\r\nweight, with foreign silver coins, the ratio in the market was reduced to\r\nfive to one. Nothing could better show how completely the country had been\r\nisolated than this simple phenomenon. Since the seclusion of Japan no such\r\nopportunity of profit without risk had ever tempted merchant adventurers\r\noutside the dreams of romance.[3] It could not be the intention of the\r\ntreaty-makers to deprive Japan of her gold, yet the exportation of it\r\nwas not only not prohibited, it was expressly sanctioned by treaty, the\r\nexport of copper coins alone being forbidden; and once the conduit was\r\nopened no power could arrest the flow from the higher to the lower level.\r\nThe currency question presented many intricacies and anomalies against\r\nwhich the foreign representatives struggled in the dark, but the ratio of\r\ngold to silver was the ruling factor which underlay the whole problem,\r\nand until every _koban_ was exported, or the relative value of gold and\r\nsilver had been assimilated to that of the outer world, there could be no\r\nsettlement of the currency question in Japan.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the friction caused by the unsatisfied demands of the\r\ntraders was considerable; it became in time ludicrous. There was a daily\r\nexchange held at the custom-house, and various arbitrary systems of\r\ndistribution were adopted by the officials there. The discovery that a\r\nkind of manhood suffrage was recognised, and that an employee received\r\nas much as his employer, led to applications being made in the names of\r\nservants and even of fictitious persons, to each of whom an allotment\r\nwas granted. Again, the discovery that allotments were also made _pro\r\nrata_ according to the amount applied for led to the applications being\r\nsent in for ever larger and larger sums until billions and quintillions\r\nwere reached. By such devices, no doubt, some of the applicants may have\r\ngained a momentary advantage over their neighbours, but at no time did\r\nthe merchants receive a sufficiency of Japanese coin to carry on the most\r\nrestricted business. At one time, about a year after the opening, it was\r\nestimated that there was in the hands of foreign merchants one million\r\nand a half of dollars which were not exchangeable, and were a \"drug in\r\nthe market.\"\r\n\r\nTheir wants were, however, partially supplied in another manner. For among\r\nthe anomalies of the place and period one must be mentioned which had a\r\nquite peculiar bearing on the supply of currency for commercial purposes.\r\nThe precious coin, which was doled out homœopathically to merchants, was\r\nsupplied to foreign officials in liberal measure. Every minister, consul,\r\nand assistant; every admiral, captain, and lieutenant; every paymaster,\r\nfor himself and for the service of his ship, received his quota of\r\nJapanese money on a scale graduated according to rank. The amount put in\r\ncirculation by these means was given by Mr Winchester as $2,000,000 per\r\nannum. The recipients, whether directly or through agents, were able to\r\nsell their surpluses to the merchants, of course at a handsome profit, and\r\nno doubt abuses grew out of what was in its original intention a simple\r\nmeasure of justice to salaried officers. The practice was condemned by\r\nMr Arbuthnot, and was discontinued by order of the Foreign Office in\r\n1864, on the initiative of the Prussian Government, whose agent in Japan\r\nhad voluntarily renounced the privilege. But, oddly enough, the official\r\nexchange was resumed by request of the Japanese Government, and continued\r\nfor several years longer, until, in fact, foreign and native coin had\r\nfound their common level.\r\n\r\nTrade certainly suffered much in the beginning from the incongruous state\r\nof the currency, which was greatly more complicated than we have attempted\r\nto outline. Even after the year of probation foreign coins were neither\r\nreceived by traders at their value nor exchangeable in accordance with\r\nthe treaties. Whether the Government was at the bottom of the obstruction\r\nor was overruled by circumstances beyond its control was uncertain, but\r\nthe British consul-general made masterful exertions to set the matter\r\nright. Currency reform, however, has baffled so many generations of expert\r\neconomists that, even assuming the goodwill of the native Government,\r\nan alien official new to the country must have found it difficult to\r\naccomplish much, with the time and means at his disposal. Earl Russell\r\nin 1862 \"declined to pronounce on so large and intricate a question,\" and\r\nwould not even discuss it with the Japanese envoys.\r\n\r\nJapanese currency formed the subject of four elaborate reports by the\r\nSecretary to her Majesty's Treasury, extending over twelve months, from\r\nDecember 1862 to December 1863, drawn up after personal conference\r\nwith Sir Rutherford Alcock and on information derived from various\r\nother sources, especially from a series of very able papers by Consul\r\nWinchester. In each of these reports Mr Arbuthnot remarks on the paucity\r\nof data, and in each he qualifies the deductions of the preceding one. Had\r\nthe series been still further extended, it is even doubtful if finality\r\nof judgment would have been reached; for in his third report he says, \"The\r\nwhole question, both as regards the condition of the currency and the real\r\nintentions of the Japanese Government, is involved in so much obscurity\r\nthat no sound judgment can yet be formed on the subject\" (May 1863).\r\n\r\nIt would be a mere weariness to the reader to attempt to elucidate a\r\nproblem which an expert student found perplexing, but a few salient\r\npoints brought out in Mr Arbuthnot's review may repay citation, as\r\nillustrative of the general state of relations beyond the immediate\r\nquestion of the currency. \"We found,\" he says, \"the Japanese with a\r\ncarefully devised system of coinage, presenting indeed anomalies, when\r\nregarded from a European point of view, but apparently well adapted to\r\ntheir domestic wants; and their coins were found on assay in London to be\r\nwell manufactured.\" The Chinese had no such system, and the evolution of\r\na metallic currency entitled to such high praise, in a country from which\r\nthe rest of the world had been long shut off, is one of the most striking\r\nevidences of the high originating faculty of the Japanese.\r\n\r\nAs to the stipulation in the treaties that foreign coin should be current\r\nin Japan on a par with native, weight for weight (not a word said about\r\npurity), it was not only preposterous and absolutely unworkable, but\r\nit was imposed by the ignorance of the foreign negotiators against the\r\nsuperior knowledge of the Japanese; for it is remarkable that in the\r\nnegotiations carried on by the Americans in 1854 the Japanese took up the\r\nimpregnable ground that \"American coin was only bullion to them.\" Force\r\nalone--or the fear of it--drove them from that position in 1858, and in\r\nyielding to the unreasoning pressure of the subsequent negotiators the\r\nJapanese probably consoled themselves with their resources of secret\r\nevasion to save them from the worst consequences of the obligation--a\r\ncharacteristic of the whole treaty-making campaign.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to Mr Arbuthnot that the Japanese had a double\r\nstandard--itself \"a contradiction in terms\"--gold and copper; silver\r\noccupying the position of a token currency between the two, at a highly\r\nartificial value, strictly governed by law. The fact was exemplified in\r\nmany ways. Art objects in silver contained more metal than the coin paid\r\nfor them, the work of the artificer thrown into the bargain. Gold and\r\ncopper, on the other hand, bore about the same relationship to each other\r\nas prevailed in other countries. It was silver alone that was maintained\r\nat a conventional level three times above its value in the outer world.\r\nAnd the philosophy of this is explained by Mr Winchester, who tells us\r\nthat, whereas the supply of gold and copper was in many hands, the sources\r\nof the supply of silver were in the exclusive control of the Tycoon's\r\nGovernment, which derived great advantage from maintaining the silver\r\ncoinage at a high fictitious level.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of the Japanese to readjust the currency to meet the demands\r\nof the treaty were naturally first directed to silver, which was recoined\r\nand revalued, but confusion was worse confounded by all these attempts.\r\nEventually the gold _koban_, worth intrinsically 18s. 4d. sterling, or 4\r\n_bus_ of the intrinsic value of 1s. 4d., was reduced to a sterling value\r\nof 5s. 6d., but was still rated at 4 _bus_, while the copper coinage was\r\ndisestablished and iron substituted of no intrinsic value. \"I am aware of\r\nno other example,\" says Mr Arbuthnot, \"of so sudden and violent a rending\r\nof the monetary regulations of a country; certainly of none which has been\r\nproduced by the interference of foreigners.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of these inquiries by the Treasury was to discourage further\r\ninterference by foreign Governments, to trust much to that great solvent\r\nof anomalies, the silent operation of commerce; while the only complete\r\nremedy was recognised as the establishment of a mint under European\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\nThe problem was still further complicated by the separate coinage of\r\nthe Daimios. Their _nibukin_, as a general rule, passed only at first in\r\ntheir own provinces, but gradually they filtered down to the open ports,\r\nand at one time considerable embarrassment arose from the mixture of the\r\ncoinage thus caused. In 1871-72 the Imperial Government, then just come to\r\nsupreme power, took the matter up with the thoroughness they showed in all\r\ntheir doings. They gave secret notice to the foreign Ministers of their\r\nintention to call in all princes' _nibukin_, and thereupon issued an order\r\nthat during one week these coins should be brought into the custom-houses\r\nat the treaty ports, where they would be fastened up in sealed packets\r\nof $100 value, and notified that coins so stamped within the week would\r\nbe accepted by the Government as legal tender, but that thereafter their\r\nuse would be prohibited. Now, as the Daimios' money stood at about 90 per\r\ncent discount at the time, the fact that some of the foreign officials who\r\nhad access to this confidential information were also merchants created\r\nimmediate speculation, with the result that within a fortnight these\r\nsilver-gilt _nibukin_ rose from 90 per cent discount to 2 or 3 per cent\r\npremium, the officially sealed packets being a most convenient form for\r\nthe payment of duties.\r\n\r\nThe alacrity with which the Government applied heroic remedies to a\r\ndisastrous predicament was typical of the energy of the Japanese, which\r\nhas been displayed since in wider fields. They do not sit down and bemoan\r\ntheir troubles, but at once arm themselves against them.\r\n\r\nWhen to the inherent difficulties common to currency problems\r\ngenerally were superadded the complexities of the monetary system of a\r\nnon-commercial and long-secluded country, surprise should be felt that the\r\nregulation of the circulating medium in Japan was accomplished so soon,\r\nrather than that it took so many years to arrive at the solution. The\r\nTycoon's Government did not live long enough to settle the currency, but\r\nleft the problem as a legacy to the Restoration. A good many years elapsed\r\nbefore the Mikado's Government succeeded in evolving order out of chaos.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, in spite of many drawbacks, trade was making headway\r\nin other directions besides the exportation of gold, and quaint indeed\r\nwere the beginnings of it. The staple products happened to be the same\r\nin Japan as in China, tea and silk, and they soon began to be regularly\r\nbrought down to Yokohama for sale. But business was at first on such\r\na lilliputian scale, and was introduced in so dainty a manner, that to\r\nmerchants accustomed to the large transactions of China the whole affair\r\nwore something of the air of comic opera, or as if children were playing\r\nat being merchants. This impression was strengthened by the aspect of\r\nthe fragile wooden structures with their sliding doors and windows, but\r\nwithout sitting accommodation, wherein business was transacted, which to\r\nthose habituated to the massive, if inelegant, buildings of Hongkong and\r\nShanghai irresistibly suggested the idea of a doll's house. The Chinese\r\nmethods also were inverted. Instead of sending samples of substantial\r\nquantities, such as a thousand chests of tea or fifty bales of silk, and\r\nthe owner or his broker coming to chaffer in the silk-room or the tea-room\r\nof the foreign merchant, the latter had to go the round of the Japanese\r\nshops to find out what they had got. Early every morning the leading\r\nmerchants might be seen booted to the thighs--for the rain was frequent\r\nand the roads unmade--trudging up and down the Japanese bazaar to see\r\nwhat novelties had come to hand. The more zealous would sometimes make a\r\nsecond round in the afternoon, in case there might be some late as well\r\nas early worms to be picked up. The bodily fatigue and consumption of time\r\ninvolved in this process would have rendered a large business impossible.\r\nThere were as yet no Japanese merchants properly so called, and their\r\nendless parley resembled more the tenacious higgling of peasants than\r\nthe negotiations of men of business. Moreover, the native dealers seemed\r\nscarcely conscious of any law which should hold them to a bargain in the\r\nevent of a more acceptable offer turning up.\r\n\r\nConclusions unfavourable to Japanese commercial morality have been\r\ndrawn from some of those early--and later--experiences; but commercial\r\nlike other kinds of specialised morality has necessarily something of a\r\nprofessional character. The _akindo_, or merchant, was a sort of pariah\r\nin Japan, his social status being inferior to those of the peasant and\r\nthe handicraftsman. His sense of honour was not, therefore, sustained by\r\ntradition or stimulated by _esprit de corps_. There being no mercantile\r\nbody in Japan, there was no mercantile code, at least none applicable\r\nto international trade, and those unwritten laws without which large\r\ncommerce is impossible had not yet been called into being. Contrasts\r\nbetween the two neighbouring nations have just been mentioned very much\r\nto the advantage of the Japanese; but in matters of commerce, it must be\r\nconceded, the advantage lay entirely with the Chinese, a nation of traders\r\nfrom their birth.\r\n\r\nIn the sale of lacquer ware and objects of art the Japanese were much\r\nmore at home than in dealing in raw products of foreign manufactures,\r\nand the treasures which were in the early days exposed in the shops of\r\nYokohama would make a modern dealer sigh for opportunities which are\r\nno more. Speaking roundly, it would have been safe to buy the stock\r\nindiscriminately at the sellers' own prices, when fortune would have\r\nawaited the investor as surely as if he had bought up the gold coinage\r\nat the ratio of 5 to 1. The same remark would apply to such of the raw\r\nproduce of Japan as had been in large demand in China; and conversely\r\nthe rule applied also to selected articles of foreign manufacture,\r\nwhich the Japanese were satisfied to buy at a price mid-way between\r\nthe high level of the Dutch monopoly and the low level of what would\r\nremunerate the free importer. Therefore the sudden inroad of open trade\r\non a market artificially confined resulted in profitable trading while\r\na new equilibrium was being found; but such prosperity was in its nature\r\nevanescent.\r\n\r\nIrrespective of the material aims which attracted foreign residents to\r\nJapan, the life itself presented several novel and interesting features.\r\nNothing could have been pleasanter than the social relations which\r\nsprang up between the foreign communities and the unofficial natives.\r\nThe strangers were received everywhere with open arms, and the residence\r\namong a smiling people (excluding altogether the meretricious allurements\r\nof the country, which have also not been without their influence) and\r\namid enchanting scenery was found to add a new pleasure to existence.\r\nHere again we must resort for illustration to a comparison with China,\r\nwhere strangers at the best were sullenly tolerated, where one might live\r\na lifetime without entering a house, or seeing a respectable woman, or\r\nmaking a friend save on a business footing. The Japanese of Yokohama and\r\nKanagawa, as well as in the surrounding villages and temples, never failed\r\nin courtesy and hospitality to passers-by, and were eager for conversation\r\nwith foreigners. A useful smattering of the language was soon acquired\r\nunder the stimulus of a quick-witted and sympathetic people alert to jump\r\nat the meaning and patient to help the novice to find his words. The women\r\nof the household were always charming, and if their domestic conversation\r\nsometimes startled the stranger by its freedom, there was neither malice\r\nnor any such impropriety as leaves an evil odour in its trail. Friendships\r\nwere formed, not deep perhaps, but genuine as far as they went, and\r\ncertainly not the less sincere on the Japanese than on the foreign side.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence also of the common people enhanced both the pleasure and\r\nthe value of friendly intercourse with them: apt as they were to receive,\r\nthey were no less ready to impart, information. Their appreciation of\r\ntheir country--its beauties, history, traditions, and folk-lore--was\r\nconscious and unrestrained, indeed it amounted to a passion. This afforded\r\nendless subject for talk. Everything save the politics of the day might\r\nbe freely discussed, and though the first-arrived foreigners came poorly\r\nprepared to assimilate so much that was novel, they could not help\r\ncarrying away a good deal from their frequent confabulations. The native\r\nguide-books formed a reservoir of suggestive topics: surprisingly minute\r\nthey were, noting every gem of scenery or point of interest, with the\r\nlegends of history, romance, or mythology attaching to them. So accurate\r\nwere these itineraries that with their contents well studied foreigners\r\nmight make excursions inland lasting several days without the aid of guide\r\nor the necessity of inquiring the way.\r\n\r\nIt need not, of course, be said that the mutual intelligence of Japanese\r\nand foreigners did not penetrate below the surface of every-day phenomena.\r\nOf their festivals, their pilgrimages, their votive offerings to temples\r\nand shrines, their ancestral worship, and their whole relation to the\r\nUnseen--call it religion, superstition, or idolatry--the strangers had\r\nno comprehension. Although its outward symbols were passing constantly\r\nunder their eyes, esoteric Japan was to them a sealed book, as the mental\r\nprocesses of the Oriental always are to the Occidental, whose imagination\r\nis cramped by the syllogism, and whose faith languishes for demonstration.\r\nThere was, however, ample outside the region of mysticism, outside the\r\nconcerns of trade, and equally apart from political questions, to nourish\r\nthe best relations between Japanese and foreigners.\r\n\r\nThe impressions of the British Minister on his journeys of relaxation\r\nare by no means the least interesting portion of his important work,\r\n'The Capital of the Tycoon.' Having shaken off the official incubus, and\r\nbreathing the free air of the country, the intercourse with the common\r\npeople in which he was able to indulge was fruitful of reflections of\r\na brighter hue than any that were prompted by his strenuous life in the\r\ncapital. He observes:--\r\n\r\n    They are really a kindly people when not perverted by their rulers\r\n    and prompted to hostility.... I had begun to forget I was in\r\n    Japan, so much goodwill was shown.... There may be a good deal\r\n    of tyranny and oppression, but the people show no marks of it....\r\n    The feudal lord is everything and the lower and labouring classes\r\n    nothing. Yet what do we see? Peace, plenty, apparent content, and\r\n    a country more perfectly and carefully cultivated and kept, with\r\n    more ornamental timber everywhere, than can be matched even in\r\n    England.... The material prosperity of a population estimated at\r\n    thirty millions, which has made a garden of Eden of this volcanic\r\n    soil, and had grown in numbers and in wealth by unaided native\r\n    industry.\r\n\r\nSuch were the observations made during a few days' rest at the mineral\r\nsprings of Atami, and they coincided exactly with the opinions formed\r\nby those whose daily intercourse lay with these same common people, in\r\nwhich term, of course, were included such town populations as foreigners\r\nhad acquaintance with. A contemporary writer, Nagasaki, 1859, remarked:\r\n\"The Government of Japan is the most absolute despotism in the world,\r\nand perfectly successful.... For the present it is consistent with great\r\nprosperity and contentment on the part of the people, but it seems to me\r\nit is only their exclusive policy that has kept it so.\"\r\n\r\nThe great, industrious, prosperous masses of Japan, enjoying the gifts of\r\nthe gods with thankful hearts, and drinking the cup of life as presented\r\nto them without any acidulating scruples, seemed to be happiest of all in\r\nthis, that they were not burdened with the dignity of wearing swords. The\r\nstorms that convulsed the upper regions passed over their humble heads\r\nwithout interrupting the cast of a fishing-net or hindering by a day\r\nthe gathering of their harvest. How different the life of the nobles and\r\ntheir following! their humanity dominated by an elaborate and intolerable\r\nceremonial, settling their quarrels at the sword's point, and ever on the\r\nalert for bloody intrigue.[4]\r\n\r\nFor there were two Japans, that of the people and that of the ruling\r\nclass, separated by an impassable gulf. \"The very existence of the\r\nplebeian seems unrecognised by the patrician in his lordly progress,\"\r\nwrote Sir Rutherford Alcock. \"And for that very reason there may be more\r\nreal liberty among the mass of the people than we imagine.\"\r\n\r\nThe members of the official class were distinguished by carrying in\r\ntheir girdle two heavy swords with a razor's edge, one long, one short.\r\nThe functionaries of the custom-house, with whom alone the foreign lay\r\ncommunity had contact, also wore swords as part of their official uniform,\r\nwhich they placed with delicate ceremony on a rack in front of them\r\nas they sat on their mats at the receipt of custom,--for there were no\r\nchairs, and the habitual posture was squatting on the hams and heels. To\r\nthe aristocratic caste the Japanese people were as absolutely submissive\r\nas if every two-sworded man wielded the power of life and death, which,\r\nso far as the common people were concerned, was not far from the simple\r\ntruth.[5] The only great concourses of armed men which the foreign\r\nresidents were in the way of seeing were the Daimio processions, which,\r\nhundreds, sometimes thousands strong, were constantly travelling along\r\nthe highroad; and in the long town of Kanagawa they could observe the\r\npeople prostrated by the sides of the road with heads abased while the\r\ngreat man with his scowling retainers passed. Residents in Yedo--that is,\r\nthe _personnel_ of the foreign Legations--had less agreeable experience\r\nof these feudal swordsmen, who, living in idleness during their prince's\r\nsojourn in the capital, were quick in quarrel, especially in their cups,\r\nand far from agreeable to meet in the streets.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. ASSASSINATION PERIOD, 1860-61.\r\n\r\n    Storms begin--Russians murdered at Kanagawa--Two Dutchmen\r\n    in Yokohama--Prince regent assassinated--Servant of French\r\n    Minister attacked--Mr Heusken, secretary to American Legation,\r\n    murdered--Ministers withdraw to Yokohama--And return to\r\n    Yedo--First murderous attack on British Legation, 1861--Mr\r\n    Oliphant wounded--Attempt on a Japanese Minister--The causes\r\n    of these outrages--Partly anti-foreign feeling--Foreign\r\n    treaties imposed by force on Tycoon never received sanction of\r\n    emperor--Hence universal hostility to foreigners--Internecine\r\n    jealousy--Mr Alcock makes ascent of Fujiyama--Against the wish of\r\n    Japanese Ministers--Makes a second overland journey from Nagasaki\r\n    to Yedo--Sullen attitude of Daimios.\r\n\r\nThe ports had not been many months opened when storms began to disturb the\r\npolitical sky, and the idyllic charm of the new life became tempered by\r\nassassination. The why and the wherefore of these outrages was imperfectly\r\nunderstood at the time, though it has since been copiously expounded.\r\nThe uncertainty as to the moving cause or causes rendered precautions\r\ndifficult, and the only safe resource was a watchful eye and the nimble\r\nrevolver.\r\n\r\nMuch bad feeling had been displayed towards the foreign diplomatic staff\r\nin Yedo, and assaults had been frequent, but nothing of a tragic nature\r\nhad occurred until the arrival of a Russian squadron of ten ships, with\r\nCount Mouravieff-Amurski on board. He landed in August 1859 with an escort\r\nof 300 men in Yedo, where he was safe; but an officer and two men at\r\nKanagawa, buying provisions, were cut to pieces by armed Japanese. This\r\nwas what Sir Rutherford Alcock designated as \"first blood.\" The next was\r\nthe assassination of a native linguist employed in the British Legation.\r\nEarly in 1860 two Dutch shipmasters, one over sixty years of age, were\r\nhacked to pieces in Yokohama. Next the prince regent himself was, within\r\nthe precincts of the castle, set upon by an armed band of retainers of the\r\nPrince of Mito and killed, his head being carried off to assure the said\r\nprince of the accomplishment of an act of long-meditated revenge.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the year 1860 the Italian servant of the French Minister\r\nhad to defend himself at the entrance of the Legation from the murderous\r\nattack of a couple of two-sworded men; and the year 1861 was ushered in\r\nby the assassination of Mr Heusken, secretary to the American Legation,\r\non his way from the Prussian Minister, whom he had been assisting in the\r\nnegotiation of his treaty. This crime filled the cup for the time being.\r\nThe Government proved itself unable or unwilling to protect the diplomatic\r\nbody from their bloodthirsty assailants, and three out of the four foreign\r\nrepresentatives--the Dutch minister not being at the time resident in\r\nYedo--made a protest to the Tycoon's Government, struck their flags, and\r\nwithdrew to Yokohama. The American Minister alone remained in Yedo. Soon\r\nthe Prussian and Dutch returned thither, leaving only the British and\r\nFrench representatives in Yokohama, where they remained until specially\r\ninvited back to the capital under conditions which they had demanded of\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nThe following summer witnessed the most desperate attempt of all to\r\nexterminate the inmates of at least one of the Legations. Mr Alcock had\r\njust returned from a long, venturesome, dangerous, but most fruitful\r\njourney overland from south to north--from Nagasaki to Yedo--which\r\nincluded a sea passage through the Inland Sea, when an assault was made\r\non the Legation at midnight on 4th July 1861. The Tycoon's guard of 150\r\nmen are charitably credited with having been asleep, for they opposed no\r\nobstacle to the entrance of a band of men who cut an opening through a\r\nsubstantial bamboo stockade at the outer gate, and on their way thence\r\nto the apartments of the Legation staff, a distance of some three hundred\r\nyards, killed, at intervals, four men, some of whom defended themselves,\r\nand a barking dog. The scene is fully and graphically described in 'The\r\nCapital of the Tycoon.' The central object of the attack seems to have\r\nbeen the Minister himself, who however escaped unhurt, while two members\r\nof the Legation were wounded,--Laurence Oliphant, who had recently come\r\nout as secretary of Legation, having a very severe sword-cut in the arm\r\nand another in the neck. Being more than common tall, Mr Oliphant's head\r\nwas saved by the intervention of a low beam, in which a deep sword-cut\r\nwas found. If that brilliant writer had seen Yedo rose-tinted in 1858,\r\nhe had now at least a chance of judging it in a greyer light. The guard\r\ndid not put in an appearance until after the assailants had been beaten\r\noff from, or at least baffled in, their attempt on that portion of the\r\ntemple buildings which was occupied by the Minister, and a fierce struggle\r\nensued in the precincts, in which two of the assailants were killed and\r\none badly wounded, while twelve of the guard were wounded and one of the\r\nTycoon's bodyguard killed. The details of Japanese sword-play are not\r\npleasant matters to dwell upon, but a few words from Mr Alcock's notes\r\nof the tragedy will suffice to give an idea of the manner in which these\r\nmassacres were carried out. \"I have seen many a battlefield,\" he says,\r\n\"but of sabre wounds I never saw any so horrible. One man had his skull\r\nshorn clean through from the back and half the head sliced off to the\r\nspine, while his limbs only hung together by shreds.\" \"There is probably\r\nnot in all the annals of our diplomacy an example of such a bloodthirsty\r\nand deliberate plot to massacre a whole Legation.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a sufficiently full list of the outrages of what may be called\r\nthe Yedo period, to distinguish it from a subsequent chapter of history\r\nwhich was opened in connection with the new port in the Inland Sea, but\r\nwhich is beyond the range of the present work.\r\n\r\nThe only conclusions to be drawn from these occurrences, and those yet to\r\nbe related, were--(1) that either the Tycoon's Government itself or some\r\npowerful faction was in deadly opposition to the admission of foreigners\r\ninto the country, and (2) that the Tycoon's Government was either unable\r\nor unwilling to protect the persons of foreigners either within the\r\ncapital or out of it; (3) that certain great Daimios were concerned\r\nin these murderous outrages. The Prince of Mito's men assassinated the\r\nregent, and were most probably the assailants of the British Legation,\r\nwhile the Prince of Satsuma's retainers killed Richardson. Another great\r\nDaimio, whose forts commanded the western gate of the Inland Sea, put\r\nhimself a year later in a state of war with all the foreign nations.\r\n\r\nThe motives of these powerful feudatories were not free from ambiguity,\r\nfor they might be animated by a _bonâ fide_ desire to expel the\r\nforeigners, or they might be plotting to embroil the Government with the\r\nWestern Powers. It was evident that the authority of the Tycoon over the\r\ngreat Daimios was far from absolute, and that at any rate he dared not\r\nenforce it in defence of the hated foreigners.[6] Thus the Legations were\r\nleft to the mercy of a ferocity which has known no parallel. The midnight\r\nattempt on the British Legation on July 4, 1861, typified the whole\r\nsituation. The inmates were ignorant whence the several attacks on them\r\ncame, the imperial and Daimio's guard were asserted to have slept through\r\nthe crucial stage of the assault, and the provoking cause of the attempt\r\nto exterminate the English was unknown. In such a maze of occult forces\r\nit was almost as difficult to adopt precautions as against earthquakes.\r\n\r\nWhat lay at the root of all these troubles, according to the deliberate\r\nopinion of Mr Alcock, was that the foreign treaties had been forced on the\r\nGovernment against its will and in violation of the fundamental laws of\r\nthe empire. He says the treaties were not sanctioned by the Mikado, and\r\nthat therefore the opposition of the Daimios was on strictly legitimate\r\nlines. Also that the law of the seventeenth century which made it a\r\ncapital offence for a foreigner to land in Japan had not been repealed.\r\nThe Tycoon's Ministers had been scared into signing even Commodore Perry's\r\nalmost platonic treaty; for though that officer had strict orders to\r\nuse no force, he did not impart this information to the Japanese, and\r\nthey could not otherwise interpret the naval demonstration than as an\r\nintimation that the ship's guns would support the commodore's demands. The\r\ncase of Mr Harris's treaty of 1858 was even clearer. It had been drawn up,\r\nbut the signature postponed _sine die_ until the great nobles should have\r\nbeen gained over, and Mr Harris retired to his retreat at Shimoda to wait\r\nevents. The news of the forcing of the Peiho forts by the Anglo-French\r\nsquadron and the imposing of a treaty on the Emperor of China was conveyed\r\nexpress to Mr Harris by the steam frigate Mississippi. Another vessel,\r\nthe Powhattan, arrived fortuitously at the same time, in which Mr Harris\r\nproceeded to Kanagawa, where commissioners were sent down at once to meet\r\nhim, and in three days the treaty was signed. Of course the Allies who\r\nhad forced the door of China, having no quarrel whatever with Japan, had\r\nno more thought of coercing that country than the United States had in\r\n1853 and 1854; but it was perhaps scarcely conceivable to the oriental\r\nmind that any nation should deny itself the exercise of a power it\r\nconsciously possessed. Naturally, therefore, the Japanese were predisposed\r\nto believe in the aggressive purposes of the invaders of China. No less\r\nnatural was it that subsequent evidence of the self-imposed limitation of\r\ntheir pressure on China should lead the Tycoon's advisers to deplore the\r\npanic-haste with which they had been hustled into making treaties against\r\nthe will of the great council of the Empire. In the interval between the\r\nsigning and the execution of the treaties the Government had time for\r\nreflection on all that: the malcontent majority of Daimios had also time\r\nto consider what resistance they could offer to innovations which they\r\ndetested.\r\n\r\nThe reactionary policy that had set in was also clearly shown in the\r\nobstacles thrown in the way of the negotiation of the Prussian treaty.\r\nCount Eulenberg had been six months at work, and as his treaty was but a\r\ncopy of those already signed there was no reason in the thing itself for\r\nthe obstruction. But Prussia was not then a nation from which there was\r\nmuch to be feared at such a distance, and therefore the true disposition\r\nof the Japanese Government had free play.\r\n\r\nThe Tycoonate itself was a perpetual cause of jealousy among the three\r\ngreat families, one of which was Mito, who had themselves pretensions\r\nto the honour; and the combination of their private grievances with a\r\nquasi-patriotic and probably sincere hatred of foreign intruders raised\r\na storm against the Tycoon with which his advisers found it hard to cope.\r\nThe Government being committed to the protection of foreigners, massacres\r\nof the latter offered a ready means of gratifying the double passion of\r\nhatred of them and of the Tycoon.\r\n\r\nBut although the foreign representatives and the Tycoon were thus to an\r\nunknown extent the objects of a common enmity, it was yet impossible for\r\nthem to make common cause, for they were not in harmony. The Government\r\nwould willingly have got rid of the treaties or reduced them to a dead\r\nletter. The foreign Ministers, on the other hand, had no choice but to\r\ninsist on the fulfilment of the engagements into which the Government had\r\nentered. Not for them to count the cost, the difficulties, or the danger:\r\nrelaxation of their demands would have aggravated all three. So there was\r\nnothing for it but the \"rigour of the game.\"\r\n\r\nThe British Minister held decided views on the importance of keeping alive\r\nall rights and privileges by exercising them. China would have taught\r\nhim, if the knowledge did not come by nature, the value of the modern\r\nprinciple of \"effective occupation\" as the only valid sanction of an\r\nabstract title. The treaties of 1858 conferred upon the representatives\r\nof Foreign Powers the right of travelling throughout Japan. The Tycoon's\r\nGovernment desired to restrict or nullify the privilege, no doubt for\r\nreasons quite sufficient from their point of view. Mr Alcock on his part\r\nsaw good reasons for opposing this tendency from the outset. Consequently,\r\nas a first experiment, he organised a journey by the _tokaido_ to the\r\n\"matchless\" mountain, Fujiyama, distant about eighty miles from the\r\ncapital. Every effort was made by the Government officials to dissuade\r\nhim from the undertaking; dangers natural and supernatural were conjured\r\nup, a more convenient season was recommended. At length their pleas\r\nfor the abandonment or delay of the expedition having been exhausted\r\nwithout any effect on the resolution of the Minister, the officials\r\nbecame helpful in the preparations and most careful to provide for the\r\nsuccess of the journey. The party--eight Europeans in all with a large\r\nnative contingent--set out on September 4, 1860, rather late in the year\r\nfor the ascent, which was, nevertheless, successfully accomplished, and\r\nfor the first time the foot of the stranger trod the sacred summit, the\r\nobject of constant religious pilgrimages. The whole journey, including a\r\ndetour to the hot springs of Atami, occupied one month: it was fruitful\r\nin first-hand information, and replete with agreeable experiences.\r\n\r\nA more important journey was undertaken eight months later, on the\r\noccasion of a return voyage from China and Hongkong, whither the Minister\r\nhad gone on certain legal business. Being at Nagasaki, Mr Alcock arranged\r\nto travel in the company of Mr de Wit, the head of the Dutch mission,\r\nacross the island of Kiusiu, then by junk up the Inland Sea to Hiogo,\r\nthence by the highroad to Yedo. The proposal met with the same kind of\r\nopposition from the Japanese authorities as the going to Fujiyama the\r\nprevious year had done: the dangers of the journey were depicted in strong\r\ncolours, and the unsettled state of the country was alleged as a cogent\r\nreason why a foreigner should not trust himself on the highroad. When\r\nthese arguments proved unavailing, and the journey was finally resolved\r\nupon, the authorities endeavoured to minimise both its pleasure and its\r\nusefulness by an attempt to extort from the two Ministers an undertaking\r\nin writing never to go in advance of the escort or to leave the highroad.\r\nThe plea for the latter restriction was that the road alone was under\r\nimperial control, the land on either side belonging to the Daimios. The\r\nfeudatories on their part took effective measures to enforce the condition\r\nby supplying guards through their respective domains, who blocked up every\r\nbyway, and in the towns and villages where the party rested screened off\r\nthe side streets even from view by means of large curtains stretched on\r\nhigh poles, emblazoned with the Prince's arms. When the party landed\r\nat Hiogo to resume the journey by the _tokaido_, they were met by a\r\n\"Governor\" of Foreign Affairs, sent expressly from Yedo to warn the\r\nforeign Ministers once more of the dangers of the road, and to persuade\r\nthem to complete their journey by sea. This had become such a stereotyped\r\nformula that the two diplomats paid no attention to the warning, though\r\nthey had some reason afterwards to think that on this single occasion\r\nthe cry of wolf was genuine; for the assassins who attacked the English\r\nLegation on the night of the return of the party to Yedo were said to have\r\ntracked the foreigners the whole way from Hiogo.\r\n\r\nThese two interesting and--the second one especially--arduous journeys,\r\neach of one month's duration, settled the question of the right of the\r\nforeign representatives to travel through the length and breadth of Japan.\r\nThey also afforded much insight into the state of the country and the\r\nreal feeling of the general population. But they were only interludes\r\nin the drama of sensational diplomacy, which had now to be resumed with\r\nredoubled energy. The Legations had been two years located in Yedo, and no\r\nprogress whatever had been made towards establishing a state of security\r\nfor foreign life. Matters were, indeed, going from bad to worse. One point\r\nhad been gained after the murder of the American secretary in January--the\r\nGovernment had formally assumed the responsibility for the protection of\r\nthe foreigners. Moreover, strong guards of the Tycoon's men were posted\r\nin the different Legations; but, as we have seen, they added nothing to\r\nthe sense of security. The demonstration of the inadequacy of all these\r\nprecautions left the conditions of foreign life in the capital in worse\r\nplight than ever. The attack on the British Legation therefore called for\r\na fresh review of the position.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. NEGOTIATIONS AND RENEWED ASSASSINATIONS, 1862-64.\r\n\r\n    British and French guards brought to Yedo--Marks a new\r\n    era--Decided position of British Government--Concessions asked\r\n    by Japanese, refused by Mr Alcock, granted by Earl Russell to\r\n    Japanese envoys--Retrogression--Position of foreign Ministers\r\n    assimilating to that of the Dutch at Deshima--Mr Alcock's\r\n    departure for Europe, 1862--Bad effects of Lord Russell's\r\n    concessions to Japanese--Encouraged them to make fresh\r\n    demands--The building of a British Legation in Yedo--_Chargé\r\n    d'affaires_ resides mostly in Yokohama--Colonel Neale's\r\n    account of the system of guarding the Legation--Midnight\r\n    attack on the guards--British sentries murdered--Suspicious\r\n    behaviour of Government--British guard increased--Admiral\r\n    Hope's opinion--Attack on an English riding party and murder\r\n    of Mr Richardson on highroad--Admiral Hope's proposal to \"nip\r\n    assassination in the bud.\"\r\n\r\nThe question now, therefore, entered on a new phase. Since reliance on\r\nthe Government afforded no sense of security, the foreigners must abandon\r\nthe position or find some more effective protection, not to supersede,\r\nbut to supplement, that which was afforded by the Government. There was\r\nfortunately a British despatch vessel, the Ringdove, at the moment at\r\nYokohama, to the commander of which Mr Alcock appealed for a guard of\r\nmarines and bluejackets. These arrived the next day, twenty-five all\r\ntold, with Captain Craigie himself at their head, and they were happily\r\naccompanied by a detachment of fifteen men from the French transport\r\nDordogne, brought up by the French Minister, Mons. de Bellecourt,\r\nalways a staunch supporter of his British colleague. That gentleman,\r\non hearing the tragic news at Yokohama, where he had been staying,\r\nreturned promptly to his post with this most welcome reinforcement for\r\nthe defence of the Legations. This simple proceeding marked the beginning\r\nof a new era in the foreign relations with Japan--the era in which the\r\nPowers represented there took the law into their own hands, with highly\r\nimportant consequences to Japan and to the world. The British naval guard\r\nwas reinforced within a few months by a mounted escort of twelve men\r\ndrawn from the force then in China. This step was strongly objected to\r\nby the Tycoon's Ministers, but the answer was complete: the Government's\r\nacknowledged incompetence had forced this measure of self-defence on the\r\nLegations. The position taken up by Mr Alcock was confirmed in the most\r\nexplicit manner by Earl Russell a year later, who thus addressed the\r\nJapanese envoys in London:--\r\n\r\n    Her Majesty's Government will not agree to any proposal which\r\n    may be made by the Ministers of the Tycoon having for its object\r\n    to preclude the representatives of the Queen in Japan from\r\n    maintaining a cavalry escort for the protection of her Majesty's\r\n    servants in that country. The Tycoon cannot ensure the safety of\r\n    the British officers within the precincts of the capital and its\r\n    immediate neighbourhood; and even if the Tycoon were to engage to\r\n    do so, it is notorious that he would not have the power to fulfil\r\n    his engagement.\r\n\r\nThis plain speaking defined the status of \"old\" Japan, and gave the clue\r\nto the remarkable train of events which followed.\r\n\r\nMuch anxiety and many sinister rumours, but no serious outrages,\r\ndisturbed the peace of the Legations and the general foreign community\r\nduring the remainder of the year 1861. Mr Oliphant was sent home in\r\nconsequence of his wounds, and the occasion was taken advantage of to\r\nhave certain private conferences with the Japanese Foreign Ministers, at\r\nwhich that gentleman assisted, when the \"past, present, and future\" were\r\nconfidentially discussed. Mr Oliphant, thus thoroughly \"posted,\" was able\r\npersonally to explain the state of affairs to her Majesty's Ministers,\r\nwhich greatly assisted them in forming their decisions. He was also the\r\nbearer of an autograph letter from the Tycoon to her Majesty the Queen.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Government had long been pressing the foreign representatives\r\nfor the relaxation of some of the articles in the treaties, which were\r\nnot to come into operation until a subsequent date. These provided for\r\nthe opening of Yedo for general residence on 1st January 1862, and for\r\nthe opening of the trading ports of Hiogo, Osaka, and Ní-í-gata on 1st\r\nJanuary 1863. The Tycoon's Government was most anxious to postpone all\r\nthese privileges to an indefinite period, nominally seven years, and as\r\nthe foreign Ministers in Yedo had no such authority--Mr Alcock had been\r\ninstructed to grant \"no concessions without equivalents\"--the Government\r\nprepared to despatch special envoys to the five Courts of Europe with\r\nwhich they had treaties. A similar mission to the United States the\r\nprevious year had been so well received as to encourage the second effort.\r\nThe principle involved in the Japanese plea was precisely the same as that\r\nwhich had kept Canton closed for so many years, notwithstanding the treaty\r\nprovision opening it; but there was this difference of fact between the\r\ntwo cases, that whereas the danger apprehended and alleged by the Japanese\r\nwas probably real, that which had been put forward by the Chinese was\r\nfalse, and manufactured by the authorities themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese were now in full retrogression, and every point they might\r\ngain was certain to become a new fulcrum for forcing more and more\r\nconcessions from the foreign Powers. This was proved in many kinds of\r\nways. For example, the restrictions placed on the foreign envoys, by\r\nwhich they were kept as prisoners in their Legations, and were attended\r\nin their walks abroad by officious guards who prevented them from seeing\r\nmore than could be helped, and forbade intercourse with the people, were\r\nalmost tantamount to those formerly imposed on the Dutch in Deshima.\r\nMr Oliphant frankly speaks of his \"jailors.\" Then repression, and yet\r\nmore repression--as much repression, in fact, as the foreigners could\r\nbe brought to endure--was the unvarying rule. Even when they were\r\nthemselves seeking favours, and had therefore every inducement to show\r\ntheir liberal side to the foreign Minister, the rule of repression was\r\nrigorously maintained. Mr Alcock relates how this determination prevented\r\nhim from presenting the Queen's reply to the Tycoon's letter. First,\r\nthe audience was delayed on frivolous grounds; then the ceremonial was\r\nvaried. Among other things it was proposed to place the envoy at double\r\nthe distance from the Tycoon which had been observed on a previous\r\noccasion. Being anxious to take his leave, to present his _locum tenens_,\r\nand to deliver the Queen's autograph, Mr Alcock waived these innovations\r\nunder protest--\"being reluctant at the last moment to stand upon a point\r\nof mere etiquette\"; but \"having found my desire was strong not to raise\r\ndifficulties on any minor points, it had been resolved [by the Japanese]\r\nto profit by the circumstance to gain some further advantages derogatory\r\nto the position of the British Minister,\" and so after everything had been\r\narranged according to their own wishes the Court officials returned the\r\nfollowing day to say they had made a mistake, and that, in fact, sundry\r\nfurther restrictions must be observed. This was too much, and the Minister\r\nquitted the capital without his audience, March 1862.\r\n\r\nThe same tactics were observed by the envoys in Europe. When the mission\r\nreached London and had laid their case before the same Foreign Secretary\r\nwho had instructed the Minister in Japan to \"make no concessions without\r\nequivalents,\" he at once conceded the whole of the Japanese demands\r\nunconditionally, for the nominal conditions were merely that the rest of\r\nthe treaty should stand. A detailed memorandum of the agreement was drawn\r\nup and formally signed by Earl Russell and the three Japanese envoys on\r\nJune 6, 1862. Having succeeded beyond all expectation in their demands,\r\nthe Japanese envoys evidently concluded that the Foreign Office was of\r\nplastic substance, and within two days they had formulated a list of nine\r\nfurther concessions which they desired to discuss. This, however, was\r\ntoo much for Lord Russell's patience, and as the envoys had \"completed\r\ntheir business and taken their leave,\" he declined to enter on any fresh\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nThe effect of Lord Russell's concessions could not be otherwise than\r\ndetrimental, the only open question being whether his insistence on\r\nopening the ports on the agreed dates would have been a greater or a\r\nlesser evil. Mr Alcock points out the family likeness between the Japanese\r\npleas for suspension of treaty rights and those with which we had so long\r\nbeen familiar in China. \"The time,\" he says, allowed to the authorities\r\nof Canton to \"soothe the people and prepare the way\" was deliberately\r\nused by them to \"create the very difficulties which they alleged already\r\nto exist, and make it each year more and more impossible to admit the\r\nforeigners,\"--a comment on the Japanese proposal which leaves little doubt\r\nas to his opinion of that transaction. Yet there were cogent reasons for\r\nthe course actually adopted, if the premisses be granted that the ports\r\ncould only be opened by force, and that England would have been left\r\nalone to employ the necessary force. The most that can be said, then,\r\nfor the concessions to the Japanese is that they represented the choice\r\nof evils. No one was benefited by them. They did not help the Tycoon or\r\navert the catastrophe to his dynasty. They did not lessen the friction,\r\nor the danger to foreign life and interests, or interrupt the long\r\nseries of assassinations of foreigners in Japan; nor did they obviate the\r\nnecessity of using force in that country, to avoid which was the principal\r\ninducement to her Majesty's Government to violate its own principle. The\r\nanalogy with China was, in fact, complete; the old lesson was once more\r\ndriven home, that there is no safety in doing wrong. As Sir Rutherford\r\nAlcock puts it, \"To retrograde safely and with dignity is often more\r\ndifficult for nations and their governments than to advance.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1861 an important improvement was inaugurated in\r\nrespect to the housing of the foreign Legations. Hitherto they had been\r\naccommodated in temples neither suited to Western modes of living nor, as\r\nhad been proved, adapted for defence. Independent sites were now allotted\r\non a commanding ridge within the city, where the respective Ministers\r\nmight have buildings erected on their own plans. These were promptly put\r\nin hand, and soon after Mr Alcock was able to bring his first arduous\r\ncampaign--a term applicable in its double sense--to a close. Having\r\nbrought the various business of the Legation into a state convenient for\r\ntransfer to new hands, he left Yedo in March 1862, a few days before the\r\narrival of the future _chargé d'affaires_, Lieutenant-Colonel Edward St\r\nJohn Neale. The Minister was accompanied to England by Moriyama, the chief\r\ninterpreter to the Japanese Foreign Office, who was charged with special\r\ninstructions to the three envoys then in England.\r\n\r\nFrom the time that Colonel Neale took charge of the British Legation\r\nevents chased each other rapidly. While the new buildings were in progress\r\nthe _chargé d'affaires_ divided his time between Yedo and Yokohama, and\r\nwhile in the capital continued to reside in the temple called To-zen-ji,\r\nwhere the Legation had been located from the beginning. The inner\r\nbuildings were guarded by the mounted escort and by the naval contingent,\r\nwhich had been renewed as one British warship took the place of another\r\nduring the year. In the outer enclosure there was a guard of 500 Japanese,\r\nthe retainers of a certain Daimio who was intrusted by the Tycoon with\r\nthe protection of the Legation.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand what follows, it is necessary to give Colonel\r\nNeale's account of the arrangements which were in force for the protection\r\nof the British Legation:--\r\n\r\n    I found on my arrival that the usual precautions had been taken by\r\n    the authorities, and which consisted in placing numerous guards,\r\n    entirely surrounding this residence, in detached wooden huts: the\r\n    number of these guards, according to the Japanese return which I\r\n    obtained, amounted to no less than 535 men, partly of the Tycoon's\r\n    bodyguard, but chiefly composed of the retainers of a Daimio named\r\n    Matsudaira Temba no Kami, who had been chosen and charged by the\r\n    Government with the protection of this Legation.\r\n\r\n    Small parties of these men came down at short intervals during\r\n    the night to the very doors of this residence, and remained for a\r\n    short time with our own sentries, leaving behind them one man at\r\n    each post to aid in challenging persons approaching and demanding\r\n    the parole, which was in the Japanese language, and issued at\r\n    sunset each evening.\r\n\r\n    These dispositions were uninterruptedly observed up to the evening\r\n    of the 26th June. At midnight on that day the several British\r\n    sentinels were at their post, and challenging with vigilance the\r\n    Japanese guards, who, in parties of two or three, descended from\r\n    the heights overhanging this building at the back for the purpose\r\n    of relieving their men.\r\n\r\nWhat took place at midnight on the 26th June may also be best described\r\nin Colonel Neale's own language:--\r\n\r\n    At half an hour after midnight the British sentry posted at the\r\n    door adjoining my bedroom challenged some approaching object in my\r\n    hearing, and received in answer the right parole; but the sentry\r\n    sharply challenged again in an anxious and eager manner, as if\r\n    some circumstance excited his suspicion, after which he walked\r\n    three or four steps towards the object approaching. I rose in\r\n    bed to hear the result, and in an instant the deadened sound of\r\n    a rapid succession of heavy blows and cuts reached my ears, given\r\n    in less than two minutes, and at every one of which followed a cry\r\n    of anguish from the unfortunate sentry. Silence succeeded for the\r\n    moment, and was followed by the beating of drums from the heights\r\n    and the gathering of Japanese guards with their red lanterns....\r\n    The assassin having left the sentry at my door, went on towards\r\n    the corner of the residence occupied by the guard, a distance\r\n    of twenty paces, where he met Corporal Crimp, R.M., coming alone\r\n    on his rounds to visit the sentry at my door. A conflict appears\r\n    instantly to have taken place between them: a revolver-shot was\r\n    heard about the moment the guard was turning out, but nothing\r\n    further.\r\n\r\nThe corporal was found dead with sixteen sword and lance wounds: the\r\nsentry had nine sword-wounds--\"every cut had severed the member it was\r\naimed at\"; but he survived long enough to tell of the instant desertion\r\nof the Japanese sentry who was posted with him.\r\n\r\nThis attack was marked by several distinguishing features:--\r\n\r\n1. The assassins belonged to the Legation guard, or were their comrades;\r\nthe only weapon found on the ground was a lance of the precise pattern of\r\nthose of the Daimio's guard, which was twelve feet long, and, according to\r\nColonel Neale, no man carrying such a weapon could have passed the strong\r\nbarricade or crawled through the brushwood: presumably, therefore, the\r\nlance was supplied from the armoury within the Legation. According to the\r\nJapanese Ministers, there was but a single assassin. In their anxiety to\r\nmaintain their contention that the wounds were all inflicted by the same\r\nman, the Ministers explained to Colonel Neale a little of the science of\r\nJapanese sword-play. \"They have attained the climax of dexterity. The\r\nsword is always carried at the side, and adepts in the use of it wound\r\nthe moment it is drawn.\" The fatal stroke, upwards, is given in the act of\r\ndrawing. Hence, placing the hand on the hilt is equivalent to presenting\r\na cocked revolver, and if the assailant is not disabled in the act it\r\nis too late for defence. One only, being wounded by a pistol-bullet and\r\nhaving committed suicide, was found, and though they could not help\r\nadmitting that the man was a retainer of the Daimio who supplied the\r\nguard, the Ministers yet drew a vain distinction between him and the men\r\nactually on duty. It could not, however, be denied that he, or they, were\r\nallowed free ingress and egress through hundreds of men carefully posted\r\nas described by Colonel Neale, and already alert and sounding the alarm,\r\nor that the huts of the Japanese were within 150 feet of the spot where\r\ntwo Englishmen were murdered, and while the assassin (or assassins) was\r\ninflicting sixteen wounds on one victim and nine on the other.\r\n\r\n2. The intended attack was publicly known beforehand: for several days\r\nthe Japanese servants had refused to remain in the Legation overnight,\r\nabsenting themselves against orders. The Government also were aware of\r\nthe plot, and of the day when it was to be put in execution, which was\r\non the recurrence of a festival, and, according to the Japanese calendar,\r\nthe anniversary of the attack in 1861. The actual day having passed, one\r\nof the Governors of Foreign Affairs was deputed by the Council to call\r\nand congratulate Colonel Neale on his escape. Colonel Neale remarked that\r\nhe had no reason for anxiety. The Governor smiled and took leave. But\r\nthe \"ides of March ... had not gone,\" In the darkness of that very night\r\nthe attack was made. Colonel Neale, recounting the circumstances to the\r\nCouncil of Foreign Affairs, asked why the Governor had not warned him of\r\nwhat was impending, instead of congratulating him on his supposed escape;\r\nbut \"the Gorogiu, to my great surprise, replied that I was quite right in\r\nmy observations, and they regretted they had not thought of warning me.\"\r\n\r\n3. The Japanese Ministers treated the whole matter with apparent\r\nindifference, months having elapsed before any information was\r\ncommunicated to the British Minister respecting either the cause of the\r\nattack or the execution of justice on the instigators, and then it was\r\nonly such information as had been common property for two months. All that\r\nthe Japanese Ministers had to say by way of explanation to the foreign\r\nenvoys was that the attack proceeded from the unsettled state of public\r\nfeeling and from the Japanese nation clinging to the old _régime_; but\r\nthat they, the Ministers, hoped gradually to modify this national feeling\r\nso that the foreigners might live in the country without apprehension,\r\n&c. But in the meantime? Well, they \"had given strict orders to increase\r\nthe protection.\" Tragicomedy could not well go further. Evidently matters\r\nmust soon reach a climax.\r\n\r\nAs the first outward and visible consequence of the assassination of\r\nthe two marines, an infantry guard of twenty-five men from the 67th\r\nRegiment was sent over from China in addition to the naval guard and the\r\ncavalry escort; and thus another step was taken towards the _dénoûment_\r\nof the plot. Then the word \"retribution\" was revived in the diplomatic\r\ncorrespondence, after having been launched by the Foreign Office in\r\n1861 but arrested _in transitu_, so that it did not reach the Japanese\r\nauthorities. It was Admiral Hope, a man who never shrank from speaking\r\nhis mind or backing his opinion, who put the case in a pointed form\r\nto the British Admiralty. \"Deeply as I should lament the adoption of\r\nhostile measures against the Japanese,\" he wrote on August 28, \"after\r\nthe best consideration I have been able to give to the subject I\r\ncannot avoid the conclusion that it is absolutely necessary to nip this\r\nassassination-system in the bud; and that not to take effectual measures\r\nfor doing so now will be merely to postpone the evil day to a future, but\r\nnot far distant, occasion.\"\r\n\r\nIf further impetus had been wanting to develop this idea, the Japanese\r\nlost no time in supplying it; for the next assassination which has left a\r\ndark blood-stain on the annals of the time was perpetrated on the highroad\r\nbetween Yedo and Kanagawa on September 14, 1862.\r\n\r\nThe victims were a party of three gentlemen and one lady from Yokohama who\r\nhad crossed the bay in a boat to Kanagawa, where their horses awaited them\r\non the _tokaido_. This broad road not being macadamised made an agreeable\r\nriding-course, and it was beautified with lines of old trees, one section\r\nin particular near where the tragedy occurred being known as \"The Avenue.\"\r\nThe party proceeded from Kanagawa towards Yedo, not intending to go\r\nfarther than Kawasaki, which was the limit of authorised excursions in\r\nthat direction. On the way they met the _cortège_ of a Daimio, the first\r\nindication of which was several _norimono_ (the heavy palanquin in which\r\nthe nobles of Japan travel) with armed attendants, forming an irregular\r\ntrain with considerable intervals between. When passing these _norimono_\r\nthe foreigners walked their horses. In the intervals where the road was\r\nclear they cantered, and this mode of alternate progression continued\r\nfor three or four miles. Then a regular procession was met, preceded\r\nby about a hundred men marching in single file on either side of the\r\nroad. The foreign party thereupon proceeded at a foot's pace, keeping\r\nclose to the left side, until they reached \"the main body, which was\r\nthen occupying the whole breadth of the road.\" The English party halted\r\non approaching the main body, according to one of the survivors; but\r\naccording to another, they were stopped \"when they had got about twelve\r\nmen deep in the procession,\" by \"a man of large stature[7] issuing from\r\nthe main body,\" who, swinging his sword with both hands, cut at the two\r\nleading foreigners, Mr Richardson and Mrs Borrodaile, as their horses\r\nwere being turned round, and then rushed on the other two. Whereupon the\r\nadvance-guard, who had been described as marching in single file, closed\r\nin upon the retreating riders. They were all able by the speed of their\r\nhorses to get clear of their assailants; but Mr Richardson was so terribly\r\nhacked that after going some distance he fell from his horse, dying, or,\r\nas his companions thought, dead. He lived, however, until the Daimio's\r\nprocession reached the spot, when several of his retainers proceeded to\r\nbutcher and mutilate the dying man in the most shocking manner. It speaks\r\nwell for all three gentlemen that Mrs Borrodaile escaped substantially\r\nunhurt, though a sword-stroke aimed at her head cut away her hat as she\r\nstooped to avoid the blow. She saw Mr Richardson fall, and her two wounded\r\ncompanions, unable to render help, urged her to ride on. She miraculously\r\narrived at Yokohama, bespattered with blood and in a state of very natural\r\nagitation. Mr Clarke and Mr Marshall, exhausted by their wounds, managed\r\nto reach Kanagawa, where they were properly cared for at the American\r\nconsulate.\r\n\r\nThis tragedy made a more vivid impression on the world at large than\r\nprevious ones had done, for several reasons. The cumulative effect of so\r\nmany cold-blooded massacres was beginning to tell, and the Japanese cup\r\nwas nearly full. There was a lady in the case who galloped seven miles\r\nfor dear life, her horse falling twice under her. The chief victim was a\r\nfine specimen of a young Englishman, and very popular. The crime touched\r\nthe general foreign community in Japan in a special manner, since the\r\nparty belonged to, or were the guests of, Yokohama, where there were also\r\nnewspapers and press correspondents to make literature of the event.\r\n\r\nSome friction was created between the foreign community and the British\r\nrepresentative by the ghastly circumstances of this murder. The community,\r\nseeing their own comrades slaughtered without mercy, were incensed,\r\nand called for vengeance, which they deemed to be within reach, for the\r\nDaimio's retinue were sleeping at Hodogaya, a station but a few miles\r\noff. There was force enough afloat and on shore to effect the capture of\r\nthe murderers red-handed, and the residents called for this to be done.\r\nReasons of policy and expediency influenced Colonel Neale in a contrary\r\nsense, in which he was fully supported by the Foreign Office when the\r\nreports reached England.\r\n\r\nThe Richardson murder, like that at the British Legation, had its\r\nspecial characteristics, though of a different order. The outrage was\r\nunpremeditated; the Government was not implicated: it was a fortuitous\r\ncollision between the spirit and traditions of two opposed civilisations.\r\nThe deed might be construed as the natural punishment of a breach of good\r\nmanners--for Japanese etiquette, of which the party seemed to have been\r\nignorant, required them to dismount--or, as the spontaneous expression\r\nof feudal Japan's deep hatred of the foreigner, concentrated in the\r\nact of a single moment. There was no need on this occasion to hazard\r\nguesses as to the responsible author of the crime, or to keep up a long\r\ntrain of make-believe negotiations. The _cortège_ belonged to the Prince\r\nof Satsuma, and was escorting his father, Shimadso Saburo, who went\r\nafterwards to the Mikado and said he had been grossly insulted by the\r\nforeigners on the road, and had ordered them to be cut down.[8]\r\n\r\nThe problem was thus reduced to its simplest expression. The circumstances\r\nsupplied precisely what was wanting to give shape and point to Admiral\r\nHope's proposal to \"nip this assassination-system in the bud\"; and a month\r\nafter the event he followed up his previous despatch to the Admiralty by\r\na detailed scheme of reprisals, with the amount and precise distribution\r\nof the force required to give effect to it. And he concludes his despatch\r\nappropriately with the remark, that \"should it be found necessary to use\r\nmeasures of coercion especially against Satsuma, ... the position and\r\nconfirmation of his principality render him peculiarly open to attack.\"\r\n\r\nThere were now two reclamations on the Japanese Government--redress for\r\nthe murder of the two marines at the Legation in June, and for the killing\r\nand wounding of the Richardson party in September. The British _chargé\r\nd'affaires_ pressed both demands, without committing himself to specific\r\nthreats until the mind of her Majesty's Government should be known. Lord\r\nRussell's instructions were sent on 24th December 1862, and would reach\r\nJapan some time in February. They were peremptory as to the use of force\r\nin case of need, whether against the Government or the Prince of Satsuma.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE TYCOON'S DILEMMA.\r\n\r\n    Strife of parties in Japan--Impotence of Tycoon--His prospective\r\n    overthrow--Orders issued by Mikado to drive foreigners out of\r\n    Japan--Prevarications of Tycoon--Plots and counterplots--French\r\n    and English troops in Yokohama--Compensation paid for the\r\n    Richardson murder, but assassin not yet brought to justice--Demand\r\n    made on Prince of Satsuma--Bombardment of his castle by\r\n    Admiral Kuper--Happy results--Offensive attitude of Prince of\r\n    Nagato--Firing on foreign ships of war--Sir R. Alcock's return\r\n    from furlough--Publication of his book 'The Capital of the\r\n    Tycoon'--His exposition of the political status of parties in\r\n    Japan--Dubious attitude of Tycoon--And Mikado--Utmost limit of\r\n    concession to Japanese pleas of weakness reached.\r\n\r\nDuring the interval that elapsed between the tragedy of September 1862\r\nand the expiation of the crime, revelations of a startling character were\r\nmade respecting the strife which was raging among the various parties\r\nin the State--the Tycoon, the Mikado, the great Daimios, and the lesser\r\nDaimios, who followed the Tycoon and the Mikado respectively. These\r\nrevelations, however, though they lit up as by lurid lightning-flashes\r\nsome corners of the landscape, left the whole in a fog more treacherous\r\nthan total darkness. The foreign officials who were called upon to act in\r\nthe midst of it confessed themselves unable to unravel the mystery that\r\nsurrounded them, nor is it any part of our task to make such an attempt.\r\nIt was the chaos which preceded order, a period when the elemental forces\r\nwere in the melting-pot, a phase of foreshortened evolution such as had\r\nnever till then been dreamed of. However trying such an ordeal was to\r\nthe foreign agents who had to go through it, the stress upon them was\r\nas nothing compared to that which lay upon the principalities and powers\r\nof the country itself during the agony of their national birth-throes--a\r\ncircumstance which has to be borne in mind when judging of the behaviour\r\nof the Japanese Government in that trying time; for truly the defence of\r\ntheir proceedings stood much in need of extenuating circumstances.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the British Government had already confessed its\r\nbelief that the Tycoon's Government was incompetent to maintain order\r\nwhere foreigners were concerned. Yet until that Government itself should\r\nplead incompetence, foreign States could only hold it wholly accountable\r\nfor all that was done affecting their interests. But the Tycoon's\r\nGovernment fought tooth and nail against such admission, resorting\r\nto every subterfuge to maintain their status, while yet evading the\r\nresponsibilities of the position. The success of this ambiguous policy\r\nrequired that the foreign representatives should be kept in ignorance\r\nof the relations which subsisted between the different parties in the\r\nJapanese State. Hence secrecy and misdirection governed their diplomatic\r\nintercourse. The treaties themselves having been tainted from their\r\norigin with deception, every stage of their execution was marked by\r\ndissimulation, which came gradually to light as the pressure from within\r\nand from without caused now one corner, now another, of the curtain to be\r\nraised.\r\n\r\nThe Tycoon was between the upper and the nether millstone,--foreigners\r\npressing him for fulfilment of his obligations, while a power greater\r\nthan his own was demanding the complete repudiation, or at least the\r\nsubstantial curtailment, of all these obligations. The straits he was\r\nput to to keep up his two faces were pitiable and desperate, for he had\r\nto make the Mikado and the Daimios believe he was as much opposed to the\r\nforeigners as they were, while to foreigners he was professing loyalty\r\nand throwing the blame of the reaction on the hostile Daimios. Instigated\r\nby them, the Mikado had fully asserted his authority, and the Tycoon was\r\nno longer able to pose as the sovereign ruler of Japan. The allocation of\r\na site for the foreign Legations on Gotenyama, a popular pleasure-ground\r\nin Yedo, was attacked, and the Tycoon ordered to rescind the grant, which\r\nhe endeavoured to do by proposing the substitution of another site. This\r\nbeing refused by the British _chargé d'affaires_, the Japanese sentry on\r\nthe buildings under construction was assassinated, and soon after the\r\nwhole building was blown up and burned.[9] So ambiguous had become the\r\nattitude of the Tycoon, that Colonel Neale was in doubt whether this\r\nconflagration pleased or displeased the Yedo Government. (Six months\r\nlater the buildings occupied by the United States Legation were likewise\r\ndestroyed by fire.) The hostile Daimios, in the name of the Mikado, were,\r\nin fact, putting strong pressure on the Tycoon, while those Daimios who\r\nhad favoured the treaties had been punished by confiscation of their\r\nrevenues. The Tycoon's position was fast becoming untenable, and in the\r\nlast extremity his advisers decided to take the foreign representatives\r\nfor the first time into their confidence.\r\n\r\nIn January 1863 a Governor of Foreign Affairs informed Colonel Neale\r\nthat the Mikado was angry because he had not been consulted about the\r\ntreaties, either before or after the signing of them; and that his\r\nMajesty had ordered the Tycoon repeatedly to drive foreigners out of\r\nthe country. \"But,\" replied the British _chargé d'affaires_, \"that is\r\nwholly inconsistent with what the Gorogiu previously told Sir Rutherford\r\nAlcock.\" \"Quite so,\" rejoined the Governor; \"only what the Ministers told\r\nSir Rutherford Alcock was false.\" \"But if one member of the Gorogiu can\r\nthus give the other the lie, what security have we that some successor\r\nof yours will not equally disavow what you say? so that at one time\r\nwe have the Mikado reported as friendly and at another as hostile to\r\nforeign treaties and trade, and we shall never know which to believe.\"\r\nThis not very promising beginning of \"confidences\" was quickly followed\r\nby singular confessions and proposals--part of the system of \"frauds,\r\nstratagems, and deceptions practised by the Tycoon's Government,\" as\r\nColonel Neale characterises them. The Tycoon's Government was ordered to\r\ncommunicate officially to the foreign representatives the mandate of the\r\nMikado to drive out foreigners and close the ports. In obedience to this\r\norder a Governor of Foreign Affairs, in announcing the fact to the French\r\nMinister, softened its effect by explaining that this was carrying out the\r\nMikado's orders \"officially\"; but \"ce n'est là qu'un stratagème nécessaire\r\npour tromper le peuple japonnais.\" In developing his plan of campaign the\r\nGovernor laid bare to the French Minister the intention of the Tycoon to\r\ndeceive the Mikado by pretending to share his views about foreigners; he\r\nwas in like manner to deceive the Daimios. Ogasawara, the Minister who was\r\nresponsible for carrying out the edict against foreigners, being \"un homme\r\ntrès capable,\" would find a means of avoiding the execution; he would\r\nhimself go to Kioto and make the Mikado listen to reason; if he refused,\r\nthen he would pick a quarrel and employ force against the sovereign. In\r\nthat case would the foreign Powers assist the Tycoon? All this, however,\r\nmust be kept from Hitotsubashi, the First Minister of the Tycoon, \"whose\r\nviews were as yet uncertain whether to carry out the expulsive orders from\r\nKioto or not. Ogasawara had formed the plan to declare himself the enemy\r\nof foreigners in order to deceive the high officers even of the Tycoon who\r\nmight not be favourable to his scheme; but everything was to be done to\r\n\"save Japan.\" Finally, Ogasawara was to come the day following himself to\r\ninterview the foreign Ministers at Yokohama, but not a word of all this\r\nwould he utter \"for fear of indiscretions.\" He would only speak briefly\r\nto the point of the notification of the Mikado's order of expulsion. And\r\nif the foreign Ministers would be good enough to frame their reply to that\r\nmessage in such severe terms as would make an impression on the agitators\r\nin Kioto and Yedo, it would assist the patriotic schemes of this bustling\r\nstatesman. So everybody in Japan from the highest to the lowest was to\r\nbe bamboozled--even one's own colleagues in the Tycoon's service--and the\r\nonly people with whom faith was to be kept were the detested foreigners,\r\nas represented by the Ministers of England and France! Well might Colonel\r\nNeale recoil in disgust from such a brewage of \"fraud, stratagem, and\r\ndeception.\" The Tycoon's officers had in all this one definite object\r\nin view, which was to induce the foreign squadrons then menacing Yedo to\r\ntransfer themselves to Osaka and Hiogo and menace some one in that part of\r\nthe empire. And, curiously enough, the presence of the French troops which\r\nhad recently arrived in Yokohama was not only tolerated by the Tycoon,\r\nbut they were to serve him as a lever whereby the astute Ogasawara was\r\nto work on the feelings of the Mikado, by representing to his sovereign\r\nthe indignation of the foreign Governments and the difficulty of giving\r\neffect to an order for general expulsion, which would include a body of\r\nwell-armed troops.\r\n\r\nFor while such comedies were being enacted at Yokohama the Tycoon himself\r\nwas at Kioto under the friendly surveillance of the Mikado and his\r\nfaithful Daimios, and it was a reasonable enough calculation that the\r\nvicinity of foreign fleets might tend to moderate the counsels of these\r\nrecalcitrants, to ease the tension between the contending factions, and\r\nlighten the burden of the Tycoon.\r\n\r\nMeantime the pressure of the British demands for redress of the two\r\ngrievances was met by evasions and delays until the ultimatum stage was\r\nreached in June 1863. The pecuniary indemnity charged on the Tycoon,\r\namounting to £110,000, was then paid under circumstances so peculiar as\r\nto be worth recounting as affording further insight into the agitations\r\nof the period. After exhaustive negotiations, leading to an ultimatum,\r\nan agreement was made whereby the Government was to pay the amount\r\ndemanded by seven instalments, commencing 18th June 1863. On the 17th\r\nJune Ogasawara, third member of the Gorogiu, wrote a curt note to say\r\nthe money could not be paid owing to an \"unforeseen circumstance,\" and\r\npostponing payment till 22nd June. On the 19th the same Minister wrote\r\nto Colonel Neale that he intended to have left Yedo for Yokohama for an\r\ninterview, but was prevented by sudden illness. This was followed by an\r\nintimation from the Government that no payment whatever would be made.\r\nDiplomatic relations were thereupon broken off by the British _chargé\r\nd'affaires_, and the conduct of affairs was placed in the hands of the\r\nadmiral. This brought about the interview with the French Minister above\r\nalluded to, when the Japanese emissaries promised to pay at once the whole\r\namount due under the agreement with Colonel Neale, and the specie was\r\nactually conveyed in four cartloads to the British Legation on 24th June.\r\nThe only explanation given of this strange shuffle was that the numerous\r\nenemies of the Tycoon and of foreigners were on the watch, and threatened\r\nterrible consequences if any money should be paid to the foreigners. That\r\ndifficulty, however, had been surmounted by the resourceful Japanese\r\nMachiavel issuing strict orders that the payment should be kept a dead\r\nsecret from all except the Governors of Foreign Affairs themselves,--the\r\nfour cartloads of silver, drawn each by a dozen or two of men, grunting\r\nlaboriously at the task, from the Japanese custom-house to the British\r\nLegation, remaining for this purpose conveniently invisible to a cloud of\r\nhostile witnesses.\r\n\r\nThe demands made on the Tycoon in respect of the attack on the British\r\nLegation and on the Richardson party being thus satisfied, it only\r\nremained to carry out the second portion of Earl Russell's instructions\r\nand exact equal satisfaction from the Prince of Satsuma, over whom the\r\nYedo Government had shown itself to have no control whatever. Much delay\r\nhad occurred, due to a variety of circumstances--mainly to the aggressive\r\nacts of another great Daimio, Choshiu, who possessed the western key\r\nof the Inland Sea. This might have necessitated a concentration of the\r\nBritish squadron in that spot--which actually came to pass a year later.\r\nFinally, however, Rear-Admiral Sir Augustus Kuper proceeded in August to\r\nthe Bay of Kagoshima, the stronghold of the Satsuma principality, Colonel\r\nNeale accompanying him to present the demand on the prince with which he\r\nhad been intrusted by the British Government.\r\n\r\nThe sole reply vouchsafed by the Daimio was a recommendation to Colonel\r\nNeale to return to Yedo and treat with the Tycoon, as Satsuma had no\r\nrelations with Great Britain. It was now the admiral's turn to act, and\r\nhis first step in the way of reprisal was the seizing of three steamers,\r\nthen lying in the bay, which were soon burned to relieve the squadron\r\nof their charge. Thereupon the Daimio's forts opened fire, and a hot\r\nengagement ensued in the midst of a terrific gale, which the prince's\r\npeople afterwards said was reckoned on as a condition favourable for\r\nhis attack on the foreign ships. There was considerable loss of life\r\non both sides; much damage was done to the Daimio's defences, arsenal,\r\nand magazines. But the inhabitants of the town escaped injury from the\r\nconflagration, they having previously been removed to places of safety.\r\nThe squadron returned to the Bay of Yedo.\r\n\r\nWithin a short time the Prince of Satsuma sued for terms, paid the\r\nindemnity demanded, £25,000, promised to punish the murderer of\r\nRichardson, when caught, and became a good friend to the English, to the\r\nextent at least of desiring to cultivate relations with them.\r\n\r\nThus happily ended the first hostile encounter between Japan and any\r\nWestern Power, the first demonstration of the superiority of foreign arms,\r\nand, as some think, the baptism of fire which was the inaugurating rite\r\nby which Japan entered into the comity and the competition of the Western\r\nnations, and into that path of material progress which has since led to\r\nsuch astonishing results.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Yedo Government in this affair may be said to\r\nhave been one of placid observation. They had nothing to regret in the\r\nchastisement inflicted on a prince who set their authority at defiance.\r\n\r\nIn the interval of time between the settlement of the indemnities for the\r\ntwo outrages and the departure of the fleet for Kagoshima the Tycoon's\r\nMinisters had drawn closer and closer to the foreign representatives, and\r\nEnglish steamers were chartered for conveyance of the Tycoon's troops\r\nto Osaka with the knowledge and approval of the British authorities.\r\nThe defence of Yokohama was by the Government voluntarily confided to\r\nthe English and French admirals, and sanguine hopes were held out to\r\nthe foreign representatives that if the Tycoon should succeed in his\r\nendeavours at Kioto, foreign relations would assume a totally different\r\naspect on his return to his capital.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, while the negotiations with the Yedo Government had\r\nbeen dragging their slow length along, another of the great princes\r\nhad taken arms against the foreign Powers indiscriminately. The Daimio\r\nChoshiu had made a strong stand against foreign intercourse, and in a\r\nwell-reasoned and moderately worded letter addressed to the Tycoon in\r\nMay 1862 he urged union between that high officer and the Mikado in order\r\nthat the country might be placed in a condition to resist foreigners. The\r\nterritory of the Prince of Nagato, as he was also designated, commanded\r\nthe narrow strait of Shimonoséki, which connects the Suwonada, or Inland\r\nSea, with the outer waters. This had become the regular route of steamers\r\nbetween the Bay of Yedo and the south of Japan, as at this day.\r\n\r\nMoved by an impulse which was not cleared up at the time, if ever it has\r\nbeen since, Choshiu began in July 1863 to fire from his forts and from\r\narmed vessels in the straits on passing steamers. French, American, and\r\nDutch war-vessels were successively bombarded as they entered the passage.\r\nThe fire was returned, and damage inflicted on the Daimio's batteries;\r\nbut such was the power of their guns and their precision of aim that\r\nmany were killed and wounded on the foreign ships, some of which were\r\nobliged to retire without getting through the strait. The prince remained\r\nobdurate and continued his hostile proceedings, a steamer belonging to\r\nthe Tycoon and another belonging to Satsuma, said to be the friend and\r\nally of Choshiu, coming in for the customary salutation as they passed.\r\nHe embargoed or destroyed trading junks attempting to pass the straits,\r\nand thus established an effective blockade of the great commercial artery\r\nof Japan.\r\n\r\nIt was droll to find Satsuma, soon after the affair of Kagoshima,\r\nappealing to the Mikado against these outrages of Nagato, and opposing\r\nthe reactionary policy of his quondam ally. Satsuma had had his lesson;\r\nNagato had yet to receive his.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSir Rutherford Alcock returned to his post after two years' furlough. His\r\ndistinguished services had been recognised by the Queen's Government,\r\nwho conferred on him the honour of Knight Commander of the Bath. In\r\nthe same year, 1862, he completed his valuable work, 'The Capital of\r\nthe Tycoon,' which for the first time brought the real Japan of that\r\nday to the knowledge of the reading world. This, the most important\r\nsingle literary work left by the busy pen of Sir Rutherford Alcock,\r\nis a storehouse of information on the history, civilisation, politics,\r\nreligion, art, and industry of Japan, carefully sifted and presented in\r\nthe most attractive form. It contains, moreover, a vivid narrative of\r\nthe reopening of international intercourse with that country, and of the\r\nstirring incidents which marked the earlier years of its progress. It is\r\nalso a philosophical study at first hand of the most remarkable political\r\nevolution that history records. Considering the official activity and high\r\ntension under which the materials were gathered, the writing of such a\r\nbook, of a Japanese Grammar, and other literary and artistic studies, is\r\na proof of the intellectual detachment which is usually associated with\r\nthe higher order of mind. This work of a single pioneer observer has well\r\nborne the scrutiny of the innumerable host of students, grave and gay, who\r\nhave followed in the same path. After forty years its authority remains\r\nintact. A short extract will at once show the character of the book and\r\nafford a convenient summary of the then Government of Japan:--\r\n\r\n    That the Mikado is the hereditary sovereign of the empire, the\r\n    descendant of a long and uninterrupted line of sovereigns of the\r\n    same dynasty, and the only sovereign _de jure_ recognised by all\r\n    Japanese from the Tycoon to the lowest beggar--a true sovereign\r\n    in all the legal attributes of sovereignty; and that the Tycoon\r\n    receives investiture from him as his lieutenant or generalissimo,\r\n    _and as such only_, the head of the executive, is known to most\r\n    readers of the present day. True, the Mikados have been shorn\r\n    of much of their power since Yoritomo, in 1143, profiting by\r\n    civil commotions among the princes of the land, and armed with\r\n    power as generalissimo to humble these turbulent chiefs, only\r\n    suppressed the troubles to arrogate to himself the greater part\r\n    of the sovereign power under the title given by a grateful master\r\n    of Ziogun. Another Pepin d'Héristal and mayor of the palace, he\r\n    did not care to dethrone the descendant of an illustrious line of\r\n    emperors, and was content with holding the reins, and transmitting\r\n    the same privilege to his descendants. And so the power continued\r\n    divided in great degree, the shadow from the substance, until\r\n    later, towards the close of the sixteenth century, a peasant's son\r\n    and favourite attendant of the actual generalissimo, but known\r\n    in Japanese history by the name he afterwards assumed of Taiko\r\n    Sama, raised himself, apparently by great abilities as well as\r\n    daring, to the seat of power on his master's death, and stripped\r\n    the reigning Mikado of the last remains of secular power.\r\n\r\n    Since that time the successive emperors, or Mikados, are brought\r\n    into the world, and live and die within the precincts of their\r\n    Court at Miaco (Kioto), the boundaries of which they never pass\r\n    during their whole life. Is it possible to conceive a less\r\n    desirable destiny? But the Zioguns, or Tycoons, as they are\r\n    styled in European treaties, have long been undergoing a somewhat\r\n    analogous process, under which all substantial power has been\r\n    transferred from them to the principal Daimios, or Princes,\r\n    who form a Great Council of State, and whose nominee the Tycoon\r\n    himself has become, as well, I believe, as all his chief Ministers\r\n    or councillors. They exercise, if they do not claim, the right\r\n    of removing both Tycoon and Ministers, and a voice potential in\r\n    all affairs of State. For legislative changes even the almost\r\n    forgotten Mikado must indeed give his consent, never of course\r\n    refused when any unanimity prevails....\r\n\r\n    The Mikado of the day is the exact type of the last descendant\r\n    of Clovis, sitting \"sad and solitary, effeminate and degenerate,\"\r\n    doomed only to wield \"a barren sceptre\" and sigh away a burdensome\r\n    and useless existence of mock pageantry; never permitted to pass\r\n    the gates of his prison-palace....\r\n\r\n    This double machinery of a titular sovereign who only reigns,\r\n    and a lieutenant of the empire who only governs and does not\r\n    reign, from generation to generation, is certainly something\r\n    very curious; and by long continuance it seems to have led to a\r\n    duplicate system such as never existed in any other part of the\r\n    world, carried out to almost every detail of existence. Every\r\n    office is doubled; every man is alternately a watcher and watched.\r\n    Not only the whole administrative machinery is in duplicate,\r\n    but the most elaborate system of check and countercheck, on the\r\n    most approved Machiavellian principle, is here developed with a\r\n    minuteness and perfection as regards details difficult at first\r\n    to realise. As upon all this is grafted a system of more than\r\n    oriental mendacity, we feel launched into a world of shadows and\r\n    make-believes hard to grapple with in the practical business of\r\n    life. Of their mendacity and cynical views respecting it I had\r\n    many illustrations. One of the official gentry upon a particular\r\n    occasion having been found by a foreign Minister in deliberate\r\n    contradiction with himself, was asked, somewhat abruptly perhaps,\r\n    how he could reconcile it to his conscience to utter such palpable\r\n    untruths. With perfect calmness and self-possession he replied, \"I\r\n    told you last month that such and such a thing had been done, and\r\n    now I tell you the thing has not been done at all. I am an officer\r\n    whose business it is to carry out the instructions I receive and\r\n    to say what I am told to say. What have I to do with its truth or\r\n    falsehood?\"...\r\n\r\n    To return to the Tycoon and the governors of the early middle\r\n    ages, with its suzerain and feudatories, its fiefs and a\r\n    phantom king, with hereditary mayors of the palace and chiefs\r\n    with 10,000 retainers, each one holding himself as good as the\r\n    Tycoon, who must live in constant dread of open revolt or secret\r\n    assassination, what a pleasant state of existence for all parties\r\n    it reveals! Each of these territorial magnates or great Daimios\r\n    is practically independent of the Tycoon when within his own\r\n    territory, with power of life and death over all his subjects\r\n    and dependants; ... even an imperial passport will not secure an\r\n    intruder's life....\r\n\r\n    Power has passed in no small degree from the Tycoon's hands, as\r\n    it formerly did from the Mikado's, and now remains chiefly in an\r\n    executive Council of State, consisting of five Ministers, and\r\n    these again held in no small check, if not in subservience, by\r\n    the Daimios and feudal chiefs of the higher order, amounting to\r\n    some 360. Although these do not actually form a Chamber of Lords\r\n    nor assemble in a body at stated periods, nothing legislative, it\r\n    is said, can be done without their assent obtained.... They hold\r\n    themselves too high to demean themselves by taking part in the\r\n    administration, or holding office, under the Tycoon. But neither\r\n    the Tycoon nor the Ministers, separately or collectively, can\r\n    venture upon a change in their laws and customs without their\r\n    sanction and a further confirmation by the phantom sovereign of\r\n    Miaco....\r\n\r\n    In the mean time, between the Mikado who nominally wields the\r\n    sceptre--the Tycoon, a youth who no less nominally governs the\r\n    kingdom, and is but fourth in rank in the Japan red-book, for\r\n    three of the Mikado's officers take precedence--and the Daimios\r\n    great and small, ... the administrative machinery of the realm\r\n    seems to be kept in order.\r\n\r\nAnother incident of the year was Sir Rutherford Alcock's second marriage\r\nto a friend of the earlier Shanghai days, the widow of the Rev. T. Lowder,\r\nfirst consular chaplain of that settlement. They had been both widowed\r\nabout the same time. They were about the same age too, and the union,\r\nbased on a deep-rooted and matured affection, proved an exceptionally\r\nhappy one during thirty-five years, till death divided them. Lady Alcock\r\naccompanied her husband on his return to Japan, where they arrived in\r\nMarch 1864.\r\n\r\nDuring the two years of the Minister's absence affairs in Japan had, as we\r\nhave seen, been advancing rapidly--whether towards a reasonable solution\r\nor to a catastrophe was as yet doubtful. The agitation against the foreign\r\ntreaties had been gathering force and consistency; the Tycoon's position\r\nwas becoming more and more precarious, his existence being pledged to\r\nthe annulment of the hated treaties. Encouraged by the success which\r\nhad attended his mission to Europe in 1862, he despatched another in\r\nthe beginning of 1864, to represent to the European Governments that the\r\npublic feeling in Japan was growing worse every day, that the Tycoon would\r\nnot be able to protect foreigners in Yokohama, and that, in short, the\r\nport must be closed and foreign trade confined to Hakodate and Nagasaki.\r\nThe mission, already on its way, was met by Sir Rutherford Alcock in\r\nShanghai, where he had an opportunity of personal conference with the\r\nenvoys. The situation was thus summarised by the Minister in a despatch\r\nto the Foreign Office, 31st March 1864:--\r\n\r\n    It is just two years since I left Japan in order to be present in\r\n    London when the first mission sent by the Tycoon to the treaty\r\n    Powers in Europe should arrive. Returning to my post a month\r\n    ago, I met a second mission on its way to the same Courts. These\r\n    two embassies seem to me to form very significant events in the\r\n    history of Japan and its relations with foreign States.... I\r\n    consider the signing of the protocol of June 1862 (afterwards\r\n    adopted with unimportant modifications by all the other Powers),\r\n    freely granting without abatement all that the Tycoon asked, was\r\n    the culminating act and fitting end of the conciliatory policy\r\n    so consistently adhered to from the beginning. It was impossible\r\n    to concede more without abandoning the treaties altogether.\r\n    Thenceforth it only remained to gather the promised fruit of\r\n    greater security to life, and freer intercourse within narrowed\r\n    limits, which, for the moment at least, appeared unattainable in\r\n    the wider range of five ports and two cities.... The avowed object\r\n    of the second mission is to declare that all the hopes held out\r\n    by the Tycoon of the probable results of the first concessions\r\n    have been illusory.... The only fruit has been indiscriminate\r\n    aggression, increased insecurity, calling for measures of coercion\r\n    on the part of all the treaty Powers; finally, a decree for the\r\n    expulsion of foreigners, with a mission from the Tycoon to declare\r\n    his utter inability to maintain the treaties, and to suggest a\r\n    surrender of all the rights and privileges they were framed to\r\n    secure in perpetuity.\r\n\r\nThe mission was not successful in its main purpose, and soon returned to\r\nJapan to report progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE CRISIS.\r\n\r\n    Foreign rights must be sustained by force or definitively\r\n    abandoned--Organises a retaliatory demonstration against\r\n    Nagato--Forts at Shimonoséki attacked by international squadron,\r\n    after delays--Satisfactory results--Nagato claims authority of\r\n    Mikado for his attacks on foreign ships--His defeat gave courage\r\n    to Tycoon--Anti-foreign measures promptly withdrawn--The treaties\r\n    of 1858 ratified by Mikado--Sir R. Alcock's recall--Lord Russell's\r\n    _amende_.\r\n\r\nThe Tycoon's Government had actually succeeded by patient persistence in\r\nevil-doing in making Yedo \"too hot to hold\" the foreign representatives,\r\nwho had in consequence gradually accustomed themselves to residence in the\r\nfreer air of Yokohama. \"Incendiarism and assassination had done their work\r\nand effected the end for which they were employed,\" writes Sir Rutherford\r\nAlcock, who goes on to remark that \"the recovery of this lapsed right\"\r\n(of residence in the capital) \"will have now to follow, not precede, other\r\nmeasures.\" So far had the foreign nations retreated before the forces of\r\nreaction, forces which necessarily acquired cohesion and momentum with\r\neach retrograde step of the opposing Powers. The country, meaning thereby\r\nthe official hierarchy, was now at least, if not before, practically\r\nunanimous. Mikado, Daimios, the Tycoon himself, however they may have been\r\nembittered by their mutual jealousies, were now united, and passionately\r\nunited, in the determination to expel the foreigners, so far as it might\r\nbe possible,--on which latter point, however, there was room for great\r\ndifferences of opinion. The Prince of Nagato might be a rebel against\r\nthe Tycoon's or the Mikado's authority, both of whom had disavowed his\r\nproceedings, but his determination to block the passage of the Inland Sea\r\nand suppress all trade but his own was an important part of the national\r\npolicy of expulsion. It appeared that the only friend of foreigners at\r\nthat time was the Prince of Satsuma, who had become a changed man since\r\nhis stronghold was bombarded, and he began to see that the restoration of\r\nimperial rule and deposition of the Tycoon might be accomplished by the\r\nassistance of foreigners. That event was undoubtedly accelerated by the\r\npolicy of the first two British ministers in Japan.\r\n\r\nThe new position was reviewed under a sense of deep personal\r\nresponsibility by Sir Rutherford Alcock in several despatches during\r\nthe spring of 1864, and, as we have seen, the conclusion he arrived at\r\nwas that the utmost limit of concession to Japanese exigencies had been\r\nreached: everything had been given up to them that could be given up\r\nwithout abandoning the treaties entirely and leaving the country. There\r\nwas not even room left for negotiation. \"No attempt at a compromise of\r\nsuch conflicting pretensions could possibly succeed.\" \"Compromise or\r\nconcession is plainly impossible in the nature of things.\" Moreover, Earl\r\nRussell had enjoined on both the _chargé d'affaires_ and the Minister to\r\nstand firmly for their rights. His latest instruction to Sir Rutherford\r\nAlcock on his departure from England was, \"You will in any case require\r\nfrom the Tycoon and the Daimios the execution of the treaty.\" In the face\r\nof a determination to annul the treaties this necessitated some vigorous\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious and most straightforward course indicated was to deal\r\na decisive blow against the Prince of Nagato, who for nearly twelve\r\nmonths had set the whole of the Western Powers at defiance. He was more\r\naccessible from the salt water than even Satsuma; he was repudiated,\r\nhypocritically or not, by his sovereign; and a punitive expedition to\r\nShimonoséki would not involve detriment to trade or inflict injury on\r\ninnocent people. Such an operation had, moreover, much to recommend it\r\nfrom the point of view of general Japanese policy; for \"in attacking\r\nin his stronghold the most violent and rash of his class, it may be\r\npossible,\" said the British Minister, \"by one blow to paralyse the whole\r\nbody of Daimios.... The command of the Inland Sea and the whole internal\r\ntrade of that portion of Japan which must of necessity be in our hands\r\nduring any operations would do more, probably, to bring the Court of the\r\nMikado and of Yedo to a sense of the danger and folly of entering upon\r\nhostilities with the treaty Powers than any course of diplomacy.... The\r\nalternative is a probable catastrophe, and a war of a protracted kind at\r\nno distant period.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time the appeals which for two years had been made in vain to\r\nthe British military authorities in China for a sufficient force to give\r\nsecurity at Yokohama were listened to, and a regiment of infantry, the\r\n20th, and of marines, were detached from Hongkong and a force of Beloochis\r\nfrom Shanghai. One of the anomalies of an unprecedented situation was that\r\nthe Government, which was concerting measures to expel all foreigners,\r\nwas nevertheless constrained to provide accommodation for these troops,\r\n\"which were not to make war, but to prevent acts which would lead to war.\"\r\nFor all that, the presence of foreign troops on the sacred soil was far\r\nfrom palatable, even though the Tycoon might secretly acquiesce in the\r\nreasoning by which the British Minister had commended a measure which was\r\nin any case an unavoidable necessity.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of these troops had a marked effect on the tactics of the\r\nTycoon. For ten months his Government, which had been powerless and\r\npassive regarding the warlike proceeding of Choshiu, now became alarmed\r\nlest the foreigners were about to take the law into their own hands with\r\nthat recalcitrant Prince. The Tycoon's Ministers began to affect much\r\nconcern for his punishment and repression. They would at once move against\r\nhim, and until the result of their efforts was known they urged that the\r\nBritish garrison should remain absolutely passive in Yokohama.\r\n\r\nFor effective action against the Daimio Choshiu it was necessary that an\r\nagreement should be come to among the treaty Powers, three of whom had\r\nbeen in actual collision with his batteries and armed ships. Individually\r\nGreat Britain had not received this direct provocation, and was only\r\ninterested in the general question of the obstruction to commerce and in\r\nthe maintenance of the political status of the Powers. How the concert\r\nwas brought about would be an interesting inquiry, but we may safely\r\nconclude that the achievement owed much to two causes, one positive and\r\none negative. The former was the strong will, clear sight, and absolute\r\nfearlessness of responsibility of the British Minister; the latter was\r\nthe non-existence of any ocean telegraph. For, as we have so frequently\r\nseen nearer home, the direct efforts of the Great Powers to arrive at\r\nany agreement for common action are always protracted, often abortive,\r\nand seldom successful. The decision in this case had to be taken by the\r\nagents on the spot, personally intimate with each other, acting on general\r\nprinciples and on a free interpretation of the instructions from their\r\nGovernments. And so it came to pass that within three months after Sir\r\nRutherford Alcock's arrival in Japan the Ministers of France, the United\r\nStates, the Netherlands, and Great Britain had signed a protocol in which\r\nthey agreed to make a fresh representation in the nature of an ultimatum\r\nto the Tycoon's Government, calling upon it to adopt means to put an end\r\nto the hostilities of the Prince of Nagato, and informing it that on no\r\naccount would their Governments allow the port of Yokohama to be closed.\r\nThis agreement of May 1864 was the natural sequel to a declaration of 25th\r\nJuly 1863, by which the same four Powers had intimated to the Tycoon the\r\nnecessity of reopening the Inland Sea, but which had remained without any\r\nacknowledgment by the Government. The new _note identique_ addressed to\r\nthe Gorogiu was equally left unacknowledged by that body.\r\n\r\nNothing therefore remained but to take the respective naval commanders\r\ninto counsel. The Ministers had no authority over them, but it was quickly\r\nfound that the concert of admirals and captains was as perfect as that\r\nof the diplomatic body. The ships of the four Powers--Great Britain,\r\nFrance, United States, and Netherlands--were placed under the command of\r\nVice-Admiral Sir Augustus Kuper, and a plan of action was settled upon.\r\n\r\nThe advance to Shimonoséki was still, however, delayed by two\r\ncircumstances. The first was the return from Europe of two Japanese\r\nstudents, out of five who had been sent there the previous year by that\r\nvery Prince of Choshiu against whom coercive measures were about to be\r\nundertaken. These young men, hearing while abroad of the proceedings\r\nof their chief, and convinced, from what they had seen in Europe, of\r\nthe overwhelming resources of the Powers, that Choshiu was bringing\r\ndisaster on himself in forcing battle on such antagonists, resolved to\r\nhurry back to Japan with the express object of warning their prince of\r\nhis danger. The arrival of the two youths in Yedo was thought by the\r\nforeign Ministers to offer some chance of coming to terms with Choshiu\r\nwithout the arbitrament of arms, and accordingly facilities were afforded\r\nby Vice-Admiral Kuper for landing the two travellers at the nearest\r\nconvenient point to their prince's territory. They were intrusted with\r\novertures of peace in the form of a long memorandum from the British\r\nMinister, reviewing the whole situation, and explaining the attitude of\r\nthe Powers and the hopelessness of the armed resistance of any Daimio. The\r\nmessengers brought back to the rendezvous, where a light-draught vessel\r\nwaited for them, an oral reply from the prince explaining his attitude\r\nand asking for three months' delay to enable Choshiu to confer with the\r\nMikado and Tycoon, by whose orders he had done what he had done, and\r\nwithout whose consent he dare not change his policy. It is interesting\r\nto recall the fact that the names of the two youthful emissaries were Ito\r\nand Inouyé, who have since played so distinguished and honourable a part\r\nin the development of their country.\r\n\r\nThe second cause of suspension of action against Choshiu was the news\r\nof a convention concluded in Paris between the Japanese envoys and the\r\nFrench Foreign Minister, dated June 20, 1864, in which this very object of\r\nthe reopening of the Straits of Shimonoséki was provided for. Were this\r\nconvention to be ratified by the Tycoon the immediate cause of dispute\r\nwould be removed. The matter, however, was disposed of with more than its\r\naccustomed promptitude by the Japanese Government, who curtly refused to\r\nratify the French convention. The Tycoon's Ministers declared themselves\r\nunable to carry out the agreement, and to ratify it would merely be to\r\nadd another to their too onerous obligations. Admiral Kuper was finally\r\ngiven a free hand on August 25, and before the middle of September the\r\nforts and ships of the recalcitrant prince were completely destroyed by\r\nthe Allied squadrons, not without considerable resistance and some loss\r\nto the assailants. The action was conducted with admirable harmony among\r\nthe officers engaged, and the reciprocity of compliments between the\r\nrespective commanders-in-chief, especially between the French and English\r\nadmirals, is edifying reading in these later days.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations which followed on board the British flagship ended in\r\nthe most satisfactory manner. Choshiu submitted with a good grace, while\r\napologetically throwing the blame of his hostile proceedings on the two\r\nhigher authorities, the Mikado and the Tycoon.\r\n\r\nAll the Daimios had been notified of the decision of the Mikado and\r\nthe Tycoon to break off relations with foreigners from 20th June 1863.\r\nThree days after this notice its purport was confirmed, and a positive\r\norder given to \"make military preparations with diligence that the ugly\r\nbarbarians may be swept out.\" This was promptly followed by a third yet\r\nmore explicit. \"Bearing this in mind\" (the date of expulsion, 20th June\r\n1863), \"you must omit nothing which is required to complete the maritime\r\ndefences of your province, and you must be ready to sweep them off should\r\nthey attack you unawares.\" A liberal interpretation of these imperial\r\ndecrees might be held to cover the aggressive proceedings of the most\r\npowerful Daimio in the empire, whose province happened to command its most\r\nimportant strategic position, and who watched the continual passing of\r\nforeign ships under the guns of his forts. The time when Choshiu commenced\r\nhis attacks on passing ships coincided so exactly with the date assigned\r\nby the Mikado for the general rupture with foreigners, that it is hardly\r\npossible to dissociate his act from the scheme of his suzerain. When\r\nsubsequently called before the council, Choshiu boldly defied both Tycoon\r\nand Mikado, declaring that he alone had obeyed the imperial mandate, and\r\ndeserved gratitude for executing single-handed the law of the empire for\r\nthe extermination of foreigners. The rupture was decreed for June 20.\r\nThe American steamer Pembroke was fired on on the 25th, being, no doubt,\r\nthe first foreign vessel to pass the straits after the 20th. Whatever\r\nulterior designs this great feudatory may have entertained, therefore, he\r\nwas not altogether without provocation in making a raid on the Mikado's\r\ncapital, which he did in the month of August following, and for which he\r\nwas condemned by his suzerain to a term of seclusion within his palace,\r\nthe usual form of punishment of an offending feudatory, which implies much\r\nmore than would appear from this mild definition.\r\n\r\nOn the capture of the forts at Shimonoséki the Government at once stepped\r\nin and assumed all the obligations, pecuniary and other, which the issue\r\nof the collision imposed on the Prince of Nagato. The town of Shimonoséki\r\nhad been spared, but held to ransom. A convention was signed whereby the\r\nTycoon agreed to pay an indemnity of three million dollars, which was\r\neventually paid in full, the last instalment of it after the fall of the\r\nShôgunate.\r\n\r\nTaking heart of grace from his defeat by foreigners, the Tycoon, if\r\nnot the Mikado also, began to coerce Choshiu on his own account. Not\r\nbeing able to reach him conveniently in his principality, the Tycoon's\r\nGovernment set to work to destroy his vast establishment at Yedo. The fire\r\nbrigade was employed in this work, and such was the extent of it that\r\nseveral thousand men were said to be engaged for three days in burning\r\ndown the buildings and fittings. Moreover, when categorically questioned\r\nby the foreign Minister whether, now that Satsuma and Choshiu had been\r\nbrought under control, \"the Tycoon would find it possible to give full\r\neffect to the treaties, and to deal with any recalcitrant or rebellious\r\nDaimios,\" the confidential Minister of the Tycoon replied without\r\nhesitation, \"Yes, certainly.\"\r\n\r\nThe defeat of the two most warlike of the Daimios illuminated the\r\nsituation and cleared the way for more intelligent action all round.\r\nTo the Japanese Government it was once for all demonstrated that it was\r\nnot by force of arms that the \"ugly barbarians\" were to be driven from\r\nthe country. The foreign fleets were for the time being invincible, and\r\nthe Powers had also shown themselves ready not only to act, but to act\r\ntogether. There was, besides, a strong garrison of foreign troops in\r\nYokohama--a British force of 1200 men of all arms, with a marked tendency\r\nto increase. The Mikado and the Tycoon wisely acquiesced in the situation,\r\nso far as foreigners were concerned, not necessarily abandoning their\r\npolicy, but at any rate deferring its execution.\r\n\r\nTheir immediate attention was directed to the internal commotions of the\r\ncountry, which could not now be long in coming to an explosion. A new\r\nplanet had intersected their system and upset its balance. There could\r\nbe no rest, therefore, until a new equilibrium was found. Foreign forces\r\nchastising the great feudatories, with the tacit acquiescence and for the\r\nbenefit of the suzerain, could only be a step either towards dissolution\r\nand subjugation, or towards renaissance and national unity. Feudalism had\r\nhad its day and served its turn; it was wholly incompatible with the new\r\nrelations which had been imposed on the country by the foreign Powers. But\r\nwhere is the State, ancient or modern, that could entirely remodel itself,\r\nas it were, on the field of battle and in front of the enemy? That must\r\nremain the proud speciality of Japan.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the action at Shimonoséki on the position of foreigners\r\nwas at once made apparent in various ways. The Tycoon's Government had\r\nlaid a secret embargo on raw silk sent to market at Yokohama as part and\r\nparcel of the general imperial design of closing that port, or, in the\r\nalternative, of a gigantic scheme of Government monopoly of the whole\r\nforeign trade, such being the only form of commerce for which the Japanese\r\nofficials had any real sympathy. The stoppage had lasted three months.\r\nAfter Choshiu's defeat the restrictions were at once officially withdrawn,\r\nthough considerable efforts were still required to give full effect to the\r\nwithdrawal. Once more, also, \"the Tycoon resolved to abandon the policy\r\nof equivocation and duplicity,\" and to inform the Mikado frankly of the\r\nimpossibility of closing the port or of refusing to maintain the treaties.\r\n\r\nThe moment seemed opportune for raising the question of the ratification\r\nof the treaties by the Mikado, in respect to which Sir Rutherford Alcock\r\nmade certain plain statements in a letter addressed to the Tycoon in\r\nperson. \"There exists,\" he said, \"a want of accord on the subject of\r\nforeign relations between the Mikado and Tycoon.... The Mikado, by\r\nrequiring the abrogation of treaties, has reduced the Tycoon to the\r\nalternative of either disobeying his legitimate sovereign or bringing\r\non his country all the calamities of war.... The only solution of the\r\ndifficulty that promises either peace or security is the ratification\r\nof the treaties by the Mikado.\" The four foreign representatives\r\nsimultaneously pressed the same consideration on the Government, eliciting\r\nfrom the Japanese Ministers the admission, \"We perfectly agree with you,\r\nit should now take place.\"\r\n\r\nIt now became the business of the British Minister to show to his\r\nGovernment that the proceedings at Shimonoséki fulfilled in every point\r\nthe instructions he had received from the Foreign Office. This he did in\r\na despatch dated September 28, 1864, and so convincingly that Earl Russell\r\nwrote in reply--\r\n\r\n    Your despatch of the 28th of September is a successful vindication\r\n    of the policy you have pursued.... My despatches of the 26th of\r\n    July were written with a view to discourage the interruption of a\r\n    progressive trade by acts of hostility, and to forbid recourse to\r\n    force while the treaty was generally observed. Those despatches,\r\n    you will understand, remain in full force.\r\n\r\n    But the documents you have sent me, which arrived by the last\r\n    mail, show that the silk trade was almost wholly interrupted by\r\n    the Tycoon, who seemed to be preparing to abet or to abandon the\r\n    project of driving out foreigners according to the boldness or\r\n    the timidity of our demeanour.\r\n\r\n    In this position there could be no better course than to punish\r\n    and disarm the Daimio Prince Nagato.\r\n\r\n    That course had these three separate advantages:--\r\n\r\n    1. It gave the best promise of concurrence of the four Powers,\r\n    as France, Holland, and the United States had all been sufferers\r\n    from the Prince of Choshiu's violations of treaty, while we were\r\n    most exposed to risk and loss by any Japanese attack on Yokohama.\r\n\r\n    2. It involved proceeding only against a rebellious vassal, and\r\n    not against the Mikado or the Tycoon.\r\n\r\n    3. If the operation should prove successful, the four Powers were\r\n    under no obligation to undertake further hostilities unless fresh\r\n    provocation should be received.\r\n\r\n    Her Majesty's Government have received with great satisfaction\r\n    the account of the naval operations of the four squadrons, and\r\n    their result, contained in your despatch of September 28. Those\r\n    operations were conducted in the most gallant manner; the loss was\r\n    not considerable; the four Powers acted in harmony together; no\r\n    defenceless city suffered during the hostilities; and the terms\r\n    granted to the offending Daimio were moderate towards him, and\r\n    sufficient for us.\r\n\r\n    I have only to add, that I am commanded to express to you her\r\n    Majesty's full approbation of your conduct.\r\n\r\nSo far so good. But the slow mail service of those days, and the entire\r\nabsence of the telegraph, admitted of wonderful interpolations in\r\ncorrespondence with such far-off countries as Japan. Events marched\r\nquicker than the course of post could follow them, and despatches were\r\nsometimes written which the writer would have given a good deal to recall.\r\nSuch was the case here. We have said that soon after Sir Rutherford\r\nAlcock's return to Japan he addressed some weighty despatches to the\r\nForeign Office on the situation, undoubtedly leading up to the ultimate\r\nemployment of force in vindication of the foreign treaties. This was in\r\nfull accord with the spirit of Earl Russell's instructions dated December\r\n17, 1863. These were--\r\n\r\n  1. To require from the Tycoon and the Daimios the execution of the\r\n    engagements of the treaty.\r\n\r\n  2. To consult the admiral and any military officer who may be sent\r\n    to Japan as to the means of strengthening and holding our position\r\n    in Yokohama.\r\n\r\n  3. To endeavour to procure from Hongkong the services of a regiment\r\n    of infantry.\r\n\r\n  4. The admiral to be authorised to land marines and destroy the\r\n    batteries which have been erected for the evident purpose of\r\n    interrupting the passage of our merchandise, &c.; but he must take\r\n    care that no unarmed and peaceable town should be bombarded.\r\n\r\nBut when the Foreign Secretary received the Minister's despatches of\r\nMay, following the terms of these instructions to their only logical\r\nconclusion, he became alarmed at the prospect of active measures, and\r\nby despatch of August 8 he recalled the Minister under the pretext of\r\nthe need of a personal consultation on the state of affairs. This was\r\nfollowed up by some temporising despatches, saying the Inland Sea was of\r\nno consequence; that the Tycoon was professing an intention to do all\r\nthat was necessary; and that the Tycoon and Mikado, seeing the British\r\nforces strong though passive, would gradually drop all hostile policy.\r\nHow were these vacillating utterances to be reconciled with the position\r\nso decidedly taken up eight months before?\r\n\r\nA disturbing influence had intervened, causing Lord Russell to see Japan\r\nat an oblique angle. Certain other brave words of the Foreign Secretary\r\nin that year, 1864, in connection with the Danish Duchies, had also had\r\ntheir current turned awry and lost the name of action. Japan was but\r\nan echo. Of course, after the definite energetic policy of the Queen's\r\nrepresentative in Japan had proved a brilliant success, had involved no\r\ncomplications, had, in fact, been the means of temporarily uniting four of\r\nthe treaty Powers, Lord Russell was ready enough to make the _amende_ to\r\nSir Rutherford Alcock, though to have cancelled his order of recall would\r\nhave been too frank an admission of error to expect from any statesman.\r\nIn this manner was the career of Sir Rutherford Alcock in Japan brought\r\nto an abrupt, but highly honourable, conclusion. He received his letter\r\nof recall while in the act of completing the final convention with the\r\nTycoon respecting the affair of the Prince of Choshiu. The announcement\r\nwas heard in Japan almost with consternation. The Tycoon's Ministers were\r\nparticularly grieved about it, and they sent a strongly-worded letter\r\nto Earl Russell to be laid before the Queen, dwelling on the important\r\nservices the envoy had rendered to their country, and begging that he\r\nmight be sent back to them as soon as the urgent affairs that required\r\nhis presence in England had been settled. The mercantile communities of\r\nthe treaty ports were no less warm in their commendation of the services\r\nrendered to them and to general commerce by the decided measures adopted\r\nby the Minister, and in their regret at his departure. \"The principal\r\ntriumph of your success,\" they said in a farewell address, \"lies in\r\nthe fact that you have accomplished all this not only without causing a\r\ncollision between her Majesty's Government and that of the Tycoon, but\r\nby actually strengthening the Government from which you obtained the\r\nconcessions, as well as by acting in such a way as to secure the cordial\r\nco-operation of the foreign Ministers resident at this port.\"\r\n\r\nAdmiral Kuper took so serious a view of the loss of a representative\r\nof such unrivalled experience and virility, that he took it on himself\r\nto address to the Minister privately a weighty appeal, on public and\r\npatriotic grounds, to postpone his departure until at least he had time to\r\nrefer again to the Foreign Office, which on subsequent information must\r\ncertainly take a different view of the action of their Minister. That\r\nthe admiral correctly appreciated the attitude of the Foreign Office is\r\nsufficiently shown by Lord Russell's despatches already quoted, and by\r\nthat dated January 31, 1865, which concludes, \"I shall wish you to return\r\nat once to Yokohama, to perform in Japan such additional meritorious\r\nservices as may be expected from your tried ability and long experience.\"\r\nBut Sir Rutherford Alcock did not consider that the episode would have\r\nleft him the prestige necessary for further useful service in Japan, and\r\nhe declined to return to that country.\r\n\r\nSir Rutherford remained at his post long enough to secure the fulfilment\r\nof the primary objects of the Allied expedition against Choshiu: the\r\nreopening of trade, which had been practically closed both at Yokohama and\r\nNagasaki, and a number of most important improvements in the conditions\r\nof foreign residence in Yokohama. These comprised a parade-ground and\r\nracecourse, hospitals, slaughter-houses, filling in of swamp, a clear\r\nand convenient site for consular buildings, a good carriage-road seven\r\nmiles in circuit, away from the town, and various other extensions of the\r\ncomforts of foreign residents.\r\n\r\nThe ratification of the treaties, too, by the Mikado was virtually\r\narranged. The very day before Sir Rutherford Alcock embarked for England\r\nhe was enabled to report to his Government that the law interdicting\r\nintercourse and putting all foreigners under the ban of outlawry had\r\nbeen modified, and its hostile provisions repealed. This was considered\r\ntantamount to the Mikado's acknowledgment of the Tycoon's treaties, and\r\nthus the vice of illegality which had attached to them from their origin\r\nwas at last removed. A year later the Mikado distinctly and in so many\r\nwords approved of the treaties. This, therefore, may fairly be considered\r\nSir Rutherford Alcock's last service to his country in Japan. It was\r\nnot, however, till 1868, after the attack on Sir H. Parkes while on his\r\nway to the palace of the Mikado, that an edict was published, over the\r\nimperial sign manual, decreeing that the lives of foreigners in Japan were\r\nthenceforth to be deemed as sacred as the lives of the subjects of the\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nBut it would not have been Japan without an assassination to mark the\r\nclose of the Minister's eventful career. Two officers of the British\r\ngarrison, Major Baldwin and Lieutenant Bird, on an excursion on horseback\r\nto the romantic district of Kamakura, and near the celebrated bronze\r\nstatue of Buddha, were stealthily attacked in broad day by a couple of\r\ntwo-sworded men, and mercilessly cut down. One of them lived late into\r\nthe night, spoke, and drank tea, when the assassins, or accomplices\r\nin the crime, paid another visit to the dying man and, as in the case\r\nof Richardson, despatched him with ghastly ferocity. The Tycoon might\r\ntruthfully say, \"An enemy hath done this\"; but the position of the\r\nGovernment had been so much strengthened by the collapse of Choshiu that\r\nthe Tycoon's officers were no longer afraid of pursuing the criminals\r\nand bringing them to justice, especially as they happened to be _ronin_,\r\nor masterless men. \"Twelve similar onslaughts,\" wrote Sir Rutherford,\r\n\"have been made on foreigners, and in no one instance has justice had its\r\ndue.\" For \"even in the only case where men were executed, the Government\r\ndid not venture in exposing their heads to declare their crime, or admit\r\nthat it was for an attack upon foreigners.\" The present case was to\r\nprove an exception to the hitherto unbroken rule. Within a month certain\r\naccomplices in the crime were brought to punishment in Yokohama, and there\r\none of the principals, who was executed in presence of British officers,\r\ndied boasting of his crime and claiming the highest patriotic sanction\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nSir Rutherford and Lady Alcock took their departure from Yokohama on\r\nDecember 24, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. THE BIRTH OF NEW JAPAN.\r\n\r\n    Four years of civil strife--Cessation of efforts to eject\r\n    foreigners--The adoption of foreign appliances--Educational\r\n    missions--Unanimity of Japanese in cultivating foreign\r\n    intercourse--The merits of those who promoted the movement--Sir R.\r\n    Alcock's services in the cause of Japanese progress--His services\r\n    to Japanese art.\r\n\r\n\"Is this the commencement of a civil war?\" wrote the British Minister\r\nduring his first year of residence in Japan. When he left the civil war\r\nwas well advanced. Feverish energy was being displayed by every party\r\nin the State. There was a race for foreign ships and armaments among\r\nthe Daimios; the Tycoon was involved in a struggle for existence; the\r\nlegitimate sovereign was asserting his authority, and the feudatories were\r\nrallying to his support. Neither the immediate nor the remote issues were\r\nclear, but the sword was out of the scabbard, and would not be sheathed\r\nagain until a new order of things should be established.\r\n\r\nThe civil strife, which ended within four years in the abolition of\r\nfeudalism and the assumption by the Mikado by divine right of all\r\nadministrative functions, may be called revolution, restoration, or merely\r\nevolution, according to the point of view from which we regard it. The\r\nhand of the foreigner had loosened the stone from the mountain-side, but\r\nit rolled down by its own laws. The introduction of foreigners into the\r\ncountry brought down vengeance on the Tycoon as the responsible agent.\r\nTo abase him and transfer the sceptre to another house was perhaps as\r\nfar as the views of the hostile princes in the first instance extended.\r\nThe consummation of the movement in the unification of the State, though\r\nits natural fruit, grew and ripened with a rapidity which bewildered\r\nthe lookers-on. From the moment when the goal was descried a profound\r\nunanimity of sentiment urged the leaders towards it, the territorial\r\nmagnates being themselves the first to propose the abolition of the\r\nprivileges, titles, and responsibilities of their order, which stood\r\nin the way of nationality in the larger sense. But wide and manifold as\r\nwere the issues raised in the course of the brief but fierce struggle, it\r\nconcerns us chiefly to remember that the avowed impulse which gave the\r\nfirst impetus to the whole was the passionate purpose of expelling the\r\nforeigner. This was the rallying cry that brought the entire nation into\r\nline. The presence of the foreigner on the soil sacred to the gods was\r\nan insult and a deep humiliation. The manifestoes of the Daimios, their\r\ninvective against the Tycoon, the distress of the Mikado and his constant\r\nimploring appeals for help to purge the land of its defilement, testify\r\nto the sincerity and universality of the feeling. In that sentiment there\r\nwas no difference between Tycoon and Mikado, the Daimios attached to the\r\none and those attached to the other: they were only divided as to the time\r\nand the means, the risks and the consequences.\r\n\r\nFrom the first the foreigners had evidence of the tenacious character\r\nof the Japanese: their persistency in face of difficulties and\r\ndiscouragements, and, above all, their readiness, not only to risk, but\r\ndeliberately to sacrifice, their lives in the pursuit of an object. Such\r\na spirit would render any people formidable,--most formidable when united\r\nin a common purpose; and their genius for combination is one of their\r\nmost typical characteristics. What these qualities have already led to\r\nthe world has partly seen; what they will hereafter lead to is perhaps as\r\nmuch hidden from our generation as the phenomena of the present were from\r\nthe preceding one. But from the earliest days of the new intercourse it\r\nwas hardly possible to misconstrue the seriousness of the Japanese people,\r\nthough their refinement of taste, especially in art, their pleasant\r\nvices, and their addiction to light and frivolous recreation, often masked\r\ntheir more solid qualities. One word may possibly reconcile the seeming\r\ncontradiction. They are an intensely vital people, living every part of\r\ntheir lives earnestly, which, however, is no synonym for solemnly. The\r\ngravest and the gayest have their appointed place in the social system,\r\nwhose parts appear to be co-ordinated as if the whole were a direct\r\ninspiration of nature itself, elastic, accommodating, ever renewing\r\nitself, and yet so highly organised that there is no unemployed surplus,\r\nno waste material, nothing that does not find an effective place in the\r\ngreat cosmic product. That many practical men have misjudged the Japanese\r\nis beyond doubt. Indeed it is the so-called practical men who are the\r\nmost apt to misjudge human phenomena, seeing that their system leaves out\r\nof account all they do not understand, which is usually a good deal. It\r\nwas long thought that the Japanese were mere copyists and imitators, and\r\ndisparaging epithets have been applied to them under that misapprehension.\r\nBut, rightly considered, their very imitation was the clearest proof of\r\ntheir depth. They had been overcome by the foreigner, therefore they\r\nwould help themselves to his weapons--all his weapons, educational,\r\nscientific, ethical, and not merely the machinery of war. This was not\r\nimitation, but adaptation and assimilation. It was no more imitation than\r\nwhat is seen every day among Americans, for instance, who so successfully\r\n\"exploit\" the ideas of Europe, and improve on them. It gradually dawned\r\nupon the intelligent few who watched the process from the beginning that\r\nthe adaptation of European customs and costume was nothing but a strict\r\napplication of the laws of evolution. The Japanese began spontaneously\r\nto appropriate ideas from the dress of Europeans; modifications, scarce\r\nperceptible, were adopted at first by servants. Certain malefactors\r\nadvertised for by the Yedo police as early as 1862 were described as\r\nwearing \"riding trousers and coats of tight foreign fashion.\" Each article\r\nof attire was adopted on its merits, for convenience and for no other\r\nreason, one of the first items being buttons. Strange combinations were\r\nsometimes seen, such as a billycock hat, or policeman's cast-off coat with\r\na few buttons left on, surmounting a pair of bare legs shod with wooden\r\nclogs. Such bizarre combinations were not uncommon during the time of\r\ntransition. The growing habits of travel necessitated a revolution in the\r\ncoiffure. The ancient custom of shaving part of the head and training the\r\ntruncated queue required a staff of skilled barbers to accompany every\r\ntravelling party. The expense and inconvenience were intolerable, and so\r\nthe old head-dressing had to go the way of obsolete things.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese deliberately resolved to learn every secret thing that any\r\nforeign nation possessed. To do this they had to be conciliatory, so as\r\nto gain access to schools, laboratories, arsenals, factories of every\r\nkind. Japanese swarmed in the workshops of Europe and America; they took\r\nmilitary, naval, mercantile, and industrial service wherever they could\r\nget it.[10] In such pursuits an outlandish costume would have been a\r\nsevere handicap, not merely marking them as strangers, but hampering them\r\nfor the mechanical work they might be engaged in. To be the comrades of\r\nthe foreign workmen they must dress like them, and minimise all personal\r\npeculiarities. It is often said by those who regret the change that\r\nthe native dress was so becoming, and that the Japanese looked ever so\r\nmuch nicer in their own than in foreign garb--which may be true, though\r\nirrelevant. To look nice was not what they were aiming at. They had to\r\njoin the family of nations, to become men of the world, to comply with\r\nall civilised observances, and as much as in them lay to avoid attracting\r\nnotice to their nationality. Such a programme necessitated adoption of\r\nthe common costume of the Western nations, and if we do not accuse German,\r\nFrench, English, and Americans of being imitators, who for similar reasons\r\nadopt a uniform society habit, why should the Japanese be imitators when\r\ndoing the very same thing? Let the world not deceive itself,--there is\r\nsomething more serious than copying in the development of the Japanese\r\nnationality. Borrowers they have undoubtedly been, and that on a grand\r\nscale. Religion, philosophy, language, literature, art, and artistic\r\nmanufacture they took bodily from China, apparently through Korea. But who\r\nshall say they have not improved upon their teachers? That is a kind of\r\nborrowing which may yet carry Japan very far. We should not forget that\r\neven a Shakespeare may be an incorrigible borrower.\r\n\r\nFrom the first appearance of Commodore Perry's \"black ships\" in 1853\r\none idea took complete possession of the Japanese ruling classes, and\r\ninspired all their manifestoes. How far the common people were in sympathy\r\nwith their rulers there was no evidence available to show. The idea was\r\nthat their nation was weak, and in its seclusion had been outstripped by\r\nthe nations of the West, and that they must make every exertion to arm\r\nthemselves in order to be able to cope with and to expel the barbarians.\r\nAll their temporising with the enemy had this end in view, and they\r\nfollowed it up with such zeal, intelligence, and national harmony, as to\r\nexcite both wonder and admiration. In the building up of their nation, and\r\ngiving it a status among the military and industrial Powers, the Japanese\r\nfreely and extensively employed foreigners in all capacities, dispensing\r\nwith their services when done with as naturally as a builder dispenses\r\nwith his temporary scaffolding. They used foreigners from the outset,\r\nbut have never allowed foreigners to use them. They have thus remained\r\nthe masters in their own house, and therein has lain their strength,\r\npresent and prospective. Teaching they have recompensed with coin; and\r\nthough confidences have been received with courtesy, their own plans and\r\npurposes have been veiled from the most honoured of their tutors. Their\r\nattitude has remained what it was in the days of the Dutch monopoly,\r\nwhen instruction in Western lore, including naval and military science,\r\nwas freely imparted to them, while the uses to which it was applied were\r\nstudiously hidden from the teachers. Though the Dutch, for example, taught\r\nthe Japanese mathematics and triangulation so successfully that the pupils\r\nwere able to make accurate surveys and construct maps of the country and\r\ncharts of its sea-coasts, yet the Dutch were never permitted to see the\r\nfinished result.\r\n\r\nIn looking back on the work of those foreign Governments and their\r\nagents who by their interference shook this new nation into life, it is\r\nobvious that they did not, any of them, know what they were doing. There\r\nwas a divinity shaping their ends which they, with their conventional\r\nconcessions to the modern spirit, had no idea of. If we are to pass\r\njudgment at all on those men, it must not be by the ulterior consequences\r\nwhich they did not and could not foresee, but on the merits of the\r\nproblem which immediately presented itself to them. The demand for free\r\nintercourse with Japan being shared by all the nations of Christendom\r\nwas bound to be satisfied one day: it was but a question of a favourable\r\nopportunity. Commodore Perry and the United States Government made their\r\nopportunity. Townsend Harris had his opportunity made for him, and with\r\ngreat adroitness, and not too much scruple, he took advantage of it to\r\nforce the half-open door. Lord Elgin, in his turn, did a smart thing in\r\nsandwiching in a full treaty with Japan between his earlier and later\r\nnegotiations with China. Each in his degree contributed to the general\r\nresult without any apparent sense of responsibility for unsettling an\r\nancient polity of which they were ignorant, and to which they were blind.\r\nLord Elgin was indeed visited by the qualms of conscience which were as\r\nnatural to him as they were honourable, but the particular consequences\r\nof which he had a passing dread were not those which followed. In any\r\ncase, his act was momentary: its results remained to be dealt with by\r\nthose who came after. The heat and burden of the day fell upon those who\r\nhad to \"stub the Thurnaby waste\" which the cavaliers had gaily cantered\r\nround,--to reduce theories and compliments to everyday practice. Here was\r\nnot only a labour but a responsibility, not of the attenuated abstract\r\norder, but one which was apt to knock violently at their door every\r\nmorning and every night. For whatever might be the remote effects, the\r\nimmediate issues were always urgent, and what a conscientious man had to\r\ndo was to shape a daily course among unknown rocks and whirlpools such\r\nas would eventually lead to a successful ocean voyage. It is surely a\r\ntest of good pilotage in such emergencies that no step need be retraced;\r\nthat to whatever extent temporary exigencies may hasten or retard, they\r\nshould never deflect the general movement from its true direction; that\r\nthe years achievement should be homogeneous with the day's doings. It is\r\na test which would eliminate the time-server from political life, but it\r\nwas in all important particulars well responded to in the short career of\r\nSir Rutherford Alcock in Japan.\r\n\r\nIt would be idle to conjecture the probable course of events had a\r\ndifferent spirit prevailed among the first diplomatic representatives\r\nin Japan. Had they been a weak and yielding body, or had they been\r\nconnected with the bureaux of their respective Governments by electric\r\nwire; still more, had each step taken by them formed a bone of contention\r\nbetween opposing factions in their legislatures, all alike ignorant of\r\nthe situation, the proceedings of the Ministers would not only have been\r\ndeprived of all initiative, but would have been liable to paralysis at\r\nevery critical moment. Under such conditions foreign policy in Japan\r\nwould have been like driftwood in a whirlpool; the forces of reaction must\r\nhave gained courage; the position of foreigners would have been rendered\r\nuntenable; and what might have happened in the country itself it would,\r\nas we have said, be quite idle to imagine. In those days no Power would\r\nhave interfered to maintain order or to defend treaties had England held\r\naloof. There is no need to carry hypothesis further than this in order\r\nto appreciate the good fortune not only of Great Britain herself, but of\r\nJapan and the world, in having as pioneer representative a man so alert,\r\nso capable, so clear, and with such unshakable nerve as Sir Rutherford\r\nAlcock; for it is the man on the spot in distant countries who shapes\r\nthe policy of his Government, if it is to have a policy at all, and this\r\nhistoric service the first Minister sent to Japan did effectually render\r\nto his country. Amid difficulties unprecedented, emergencies incessant,\r\nand an elemental strife ever raging, the terms of which were inscrutable,\r\ntwo immutable principles guided the Minister to a clear issue. The first\r\nwas duty, at all costs and hazards; the second, the integrity of the\r\ntreaties. Whatever might be argued about the policy or the ethics of\r\nmaking them, once made, retreat from their engagements was impossible\r\nand compromise futile. Matters had to be pushed to an issue. The whole\r\nterm of Sir Rutherford Alcock's service in Japan was filled up with\r\na warfare against the temptation to temporise in the hope that things\r\nwould be better,--a temptation to which, as we have seen, her Majesty's\r\nGovernment for a time succumbed. In perplexing situations the best solvent\r\nis simplicity, and the Minister found his safety in directness of aim and\r\ninflexibility of purpose. Standing on that rock, the mystifications with\r\nwhich he was surrounded lost their power to disturb him. \"Fortunately,\"\r\nhe wrote to Earl Russell, \"whether the Tycoon was playing a comedy or\r\nnot, the course plainly indicated is the same, the assertion of a fixed\r\ndetermination not to be driven out, and to maintain the rights secured\r\nunder treaties, by force, if all other means fail.\"\r\n\r\nTo the man who perceived and successfully carried out this simple rule of\r\naction his countrymen owe no common debt.\r\n\r\nAs it is proverbially the busiest people who have the most leisure, the\r\nBritish Minister found time in the midst of his harassing labours to\r\nemploy his æsthetic gifts for the benefit of the public. It fell to his\r\nlot, as the reader may remember, while consul in Shanghai, to contribute\r\nsamples of the art, industry, and natural products of China to the\r\nGreat Exhibition of 1851, neither the native Government nor the foreign\r\nmercantile community being sufficiently interested to assist in the\r\nwork. A similar service was asked of him in Japan for the Exhibition of\r\n1862, and it was performed under similar conditions, neither the native\r\nGovernment nor the foreign residents taking any part in it. The task\r\nhad a special fascination for Sir Rutherford, for Japanese art was a new\r\nand rich field for the student as for the dilettante. The Japanese had\r\noriginally borrowed their whole art, with their literature and religion,\r\nfrom China, but they had improved or at least transformed it so much as\r\nto make it their own, though it is contended that in ceramics they had\r\nnever succeeded in overtaking the Chinese. For five hundred years they\r\nhad worked on the Chinese idea; but at last in the eleventh century A.D.\r\nnative schools sprang up, and thenceforth Japanese artists followed their\r\nown inspiration, which was that of nature, producing, in the fulness of\r\ntime, the exquisite results with which the world is now so familiar.\r\nThe introduction of this Japanese work to the connoisseurs of Europe\r\nthrough the London Exhibition of 1862 was effected through the personal\r\nexertions of Sir Rutherford Alcock, who added immensely to the obligations\r\nunder which he laid his countrymen by the publication in 1878 of a short\r\nbut comprehensive work on 'Art and Art Industries of Japan.' Like the\r\ncollecting of objects for the Exhibition, the writing of this book was\r\nevidently a labour of love. It reviews with a sympathy which almost\r\nrises to enthusiasm not only the finished product, but the stages of the\r\nevolution of Japanese art, having its origin in a loving fellowship with\r\nnature and in a special affinity with what may be called its humorous\r\nside. The genius of Japan has taken a different form from that of the\r\nWest, where \"the great works of the sculptor and the painter are seen by\r\nbut few,\" whereas the art work of Japan, \"which is always in sight, tends\r\nto cultivate the taste of the million by bringing constantly before their\r\neyes objects of taste, not less effective because they are unconsciously\r\nfelt and enjoyed.\" It is art pressed into the service of the life of the\r\npeople \"which can give a priceless value to the commonest and least costly\r\nmaterial by the mere impress of genius and taste, ... which is the most\r\nprecious, tested by any true estimate of value and utility.\" The volume\r\nis well worth perusal by those who are interested in art, not only for\r\nits philosophical yet simple analysis of the subject generally, but for\r\nthe instructive way in which universal principles are adapted to the\r\npopularised art of Japan. To read this book, one would imagine the writer\r\nhad devoted the whole of the three years and a half he spent in Japan to\r\nthe cultivation of the industrial fine arts.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese language, too, attracted the interest of the busy Minister,\r\nwho during his stay in Yedo brought out a grammar and phrase-book in\r\nJapanese and English. They have, as a matter of course, been superseded by\r\nthe more recondite studies of later students; but as a first step towards\r\nfamiliarising the language to visitors and strangers these introductory\r\nworks cannot be denied their meed of merit.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. THE DIPLOMATIC BODY--TSUSHIMA.\r\n\r\n    Four Western Powers represented in Tokio--Russia only in\r\n    Hakodate by consul--And naval officers--Cordial Anglo-French\r\n    relations--Temptations to intrigue--Secret communications to\r\n    Japanese--Representatives of the Powers arousing suspicions\r\n    of each other's designs--Letters cited--The Tsushima\r\n    incident--Admiral Sir James Hope obtains its evacuation by\r\n    Russians.\r\n\r\nDuring the first few years there were four representatives of the\r\nWestern Powers resident in or near the Tycoon's capital: they were the\r\nMinisters of Great Britain, the United States, France, and Holland.\r\nRussia had accredited no Minister, but intrusted her interests to the\r\nvery capable hands of M. Goskavitch, consul at Hakodate, the treaty port\r\nin the northern island of the Japanese group. What was no doubt deemed\r\nof at least equal importance, she maintained a powerful squadron on the\r\nwestern coast of Japan, whose actual strength was magnified to the view\r\nby their incessant activity, which had the character of a continuous\r\ndemonstration on the coast both of China and Japan; and the principle of\r\ndirect action by naval officers without the medium of diplomacy, at the\r\nports of Nagasaki and Hakodate, was so different from that of any other\r\nPower, that the Daimios declared to the Tycoon that any of the foreigners\r\ncould be safely insulted except the Russians. Their manœuvres in force\r\nround Hongkong, meaningless to the ordinary professional or political\r\neye, played probably a corroborative part in the impressions they were\r\nmaking on the rulers of the neighbouring countries. Prussia had not yet\r\ncome effectually on the scene when the decisive operations against the two\r\ngreat Daimios, which really determined the future course of events, were\r\nundertaken.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the resident foreign Ministers among themselves\r\nwere marked by substantial harmony, in some instances rising to great\r\ncordiality. The foreign diplomatic body thus presented a united front to\r\nthe forces, open or covert, that were opposed to them. Such differences of\r\nopinion as arose in the course of business either were not of a nature, or\r\nwere not allowed, to interfere with the pursuit of the national interests\r\nof each, which were inextricably bound up in the common interests of all.\r\nUnited, the influence of the Powers was practically irresistible; divided,\r\nthey would have fallen an easy prey to the devices of what, for want of\r\nanother term, must be spoken of as the common enemy, Japan. It is not\r\npleasant to think of Japan in this way, since she was on her defence in\r\na position forced upon her; yet overruling circumstances had, in fact,\r\nplaced the parties in temporary antagonism--the world against Japan.\r\n\r\nThe key to the success of European diplomacy of the earlier period was\r\nwithout doubt the Anglo-French alliance, which had culminated in the\r\ncoercion of imperial China, and was spending its ebbing strength in\r\nsuppressing the great Taiping insurrection against that empire. Being\r\npossessed of mobile forces within call, the two Powers were always in a\r\nposition to act when circumstances called for action, and they had become\r\naccustomed to co-operation. Hence the potency of their united counsels.\r\n\r\nThe Minister of France as well as the admiral on the station had the\r\ninstructions of the Imperial Government to support England in her Far\r\nEastern policy,--\"for,\" said the calculating Emperor Napoleon III.,\r\n\"though our interests in that part of the world are trivial, we may find\r\nour account in the friendship of England in quarters where our interests\r\nare vital.\" That the Ministers of the two countries, therefore, should be\r\non terms of official intimacy and mutual confidence was only natural, and\r\nit was a tower of strength to them both. But we gather from the despatches\r\nthat personal respect and attachment went hand in hand with the official\r\n_liaison_; and whether it was Sir Rutherford Alcock or Colonel Neale on\r\nthe one side, or M. Duchesne de Bellecourt or Leon Roche on the other,\r\ntheir expressions towards their colleagues were always of the warmest.\r\nSo completely confidential were their relations, that when something was\r\ninsinuated by third parties which, if credited, would have necessitated\r\nexplanations between the two, it was simply dismissed as unworthy of\r\nconsideration. There were not wanting those who would have regarded with\r\nequanimity a little more coldness between the Allied colleagues.\r\n\r\nFor, notwithstanding their good fraternal relations, it cannot be said\r\nthat the foreign officials in Japan were uniformly successful in resisting\r\nthe besetting sin of diplomacy, the common temptation to intrigue. In\r\ncertain cases it was resorted to as the natural means of advancing the\r\nsolid interests of a particular country; in other cases, where no national\r\ninterest could be served by it, it would appear that intrigue was its own\r\nallurement, followed for the mere pleasure of the game. The political\r\nsituation in Japan was sufficiently complicated to afford occasion for\r\nboth these motives of action. The unstable Government of the country,\r\noppressed by conflicting obligations and consciously struggling for\r\nexistence, offered an ideal theatre for volunteer experimentation by those\r\non whom no ulterior responsibility rested.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, however, secret communications did pass between certain\r\nforeign officials and the Japanese Government of a kind which betrayed the\r\ndesign of undermining the interests of other Powers and frustrating their\r\npolicy, presumably for the benefit of those whose zeal in the cause of\r\ninternational honour impelled them to adopt the _rôle_ of international\r\ninformers. It need hardly be said that Great Britain was a principal\r\nobject of these occult practices; neither need it be denied that she\r\nsuffered from their effects in the estimation of the Japanese Government,\r\nwhich was naturally credulous of any disparagement of the Powers it\r\ndreaded so much. In the incandescent condition of the intercourse of those\r\nearlier years, had any of the foreign agents spoken well of his neighbours\r\nhe would have obtained no hearing for his praise; but given vilification\r\nfor its motive, the representation would find its way straight to the\r\nJapanese heart, since nothing could be too vile to be believed of the\r\nintentions of any of the foreign nations. The spy system was congenial\r\nto the Japanese, woven into their whole administration; while as regards\r\nforeigners, they had had ample experience centuries before of the lengths\r\nChristian nations would go in traducing each other for the sake of gaining\r\na little favour of the rulers of Japan. It was entirely in keeping with\r\ntheir medieval experiences that these dastardly barbarians should now\r\nbe ready to stab each other in the back. Whatever reception, therefore,\r\non other grounds, might be accorded to gratuitous information conveyed\r\nthrough prejudiced channels, no surprise was occasioned by it, and as\r\nlittle doubt of its truth, so long as its burden was evil. This much has\r\nto be borne in mind as a tribute to the intelligence of the writers of\r\nletters such as the following, addressed to the Gorogiu, or Bureau of\r\nForeign Affairs, and conveyed to them with ostentatious secrecy. In 1860\r\none Government agent wrote--\r\n\r\n    Last year towards the middle of the second month the English\r\n    created great difficulties in China in consequence of the war\r\n    they waged by sea and land. They had violated the treaties in\r\n    a shameful manner, and as this excited the indignation of the\r\n    Chinese they attacked the English on the river, and captured three\r\n    men-of-war. Feeling herself humbled by this defeat, England swore\r\n    revenge. She uttered the most unjust menaces against China, and\r\n    at the very moment the Chinese commenced their conferences upon\r\n    this subject four or five months ago the English suddenly ordered\r\n    forty-seven men-of-war from London. These vessels are at present\r\n    at Chusan, and await the signal for action. Within two or three\r\n    months the men-of-war will leave for the north. The merchant\r\n    vessel Dayspring brought us all this news on the 12th instant.\r\n\r\n    On speaking about this important news to Mr ----, the British\r\n    Consul residing here, he gave me the following information in a\r\n    strictly private manner.\r\n\r\n    \"At last,\" said Mr ----, \"the war with China is decided upon.\r\n    We have for a long time been searching for a good harbour where\r\n    we shall be able to put the sick and wounded. We have chosen\r\n    Tsushima, where we intend to send the sick and wounded, and as\r\n    soon as the war has commenced we have resolved to take possession\r\n    of that island.\"\r\n\r\n    Mr ---- communicated this to me as a great secret, and I now give\r\n    you this information in a strictly private manner.\r\n\r\n    You will perceive that this is a question of the utmost\r\n    importance, and you must take it into serious consideration\r\n    without delay, and with the utmost attention.\r\n\r\n    Four years ago the English, who had for a long time coveted\r\n    an excellent little island called Perim, took possession of\r\n    it, informing the Turkish Government that they only wished to\r\n    place their invalids on that island, and this false pretext was\r\n    matter for serious discussion. The Turks were perfectly aware of\r\n    the deceitful conduct of the English. They did not ignore that\r\n    fourteen or fifteen years before, while fighting with the Chinese,\r\n    the English had stolen Hongkong under the same pretences.... But\r\n    while they were deliberating the English sent their invalids to\r\n    Perim, and immediately built forts and stole this island in the\r\n    most disgraceful manner.\r\n\r\n    As the English are wonderful impostors, it is your duty not only\r\n    to take care of Tsushima, but also of the smallest island in your\r\n    empire: this must be done with the utmost watchfulness.\r\n\r\n    I inform you of this danger in the most private and secret manner.\r\n\r\nAnd a year or two later, when the intercourse between the British Minister\r\nand the Tycoon was charged with contentious, almost with explosive,\r\nmatter, missives were passed in from philanthropic onlookers of a tenor\r\nwhich excited no surprise, but a good deal of genuine exultation, in the\r\nminds of the Japanese Ministers. It was well known some time before that\r\nit had been sought to prevent a settlement of outstanding difficulties\r\nbetween the two countries by the assurance volunteered to the Tycoon's\r\nGovernment that Great Britain was quite unable to make war on Japan,\r\nand the following letter is only one of a series of such international\r\namenities which shunned the light of day:--\r\n\r\n    Japan was opened by us, ... and after we had settled down here\r\n    the other Powers made their appearance. The intentions of ...\r\n    in opening this country to foreign intercourse was to increase\r\n    the welfare and prosperity of its inhabitants. While we were\r\n    doing our utmost for this nation some English men-of-war suddenly\r\n    appeared here to demand indemnities for a murder which, although\r\n    unjustifiable, was not a _casus belli_. As long as the ambitious,\r\n    warlike, and quarrelsome Englishmen are here, the object we have\r\n    in view cannot be obtained. They must, therefore, be driven out\r\n    of this country. You cannot consent to their demands. Do not\r\n    fear the English; there are other nations in Japan, and if you\r\n    require assistance you may rest assured we shall give you moral\r\n    and material support.\r\n\r\nBut in vain was the snare set by these fowlers in the sight of the bird.\r\nThe notion of setting a thief to catch a thief was not uncongenial to\r\nJapanese habits of thought, but a generous offer of armed assistance\r\nagainst a foreign Power savoured too much of the wooden horse even for\r\nsuch inexperienced internationalists as the New Japan. Having expressed\r\ntheir appreciation--had it been the Chinese Government it would have taken\r\nthe form of praise for their loyal obedience--the Government intimated\r\nthat they would exhaust their own resources before putting these friendly\r\nforeign Powers to the trouble of intervening on their behalf. The Japanese\r\nhave always been wary about accepting help unasked for. The United States\r\nfrigate Niagara, which brought back the envoys in 1860, brought also a\r\nstaff of artillery officers whose services were tendered to the Tycoon,\r\nbut declined. And it was said the American officers were rather astonished\r\nby the proofs afforded them in Yedo of the efficiency of armament and\r\nproficiency of the gunners which Japan was already able to show.\r\n\r\nOne of the vigilant observers of political portents about that time became\r\nconvinced that the French had designs upon Tsushima, a belief which was\r\nno doubt in some way also communicated to the Japanese Government; but\r\nby that time--1863--it was too late for any Power to flirt with that\r\n\"excellent little island,\" for since the first warning given the Japanese\r\nin 1860, above cited, the island had been made the subject of definitive\r\narrangements. The incident itself, though of brief duration and leaving\r\nno visible trail behind it, nevertheless deserves to be remembered as a\r\nlandmark of history.\r\n\r\nWhen Count Mouravieff was in Yedo in 1859, he took the trouble to warn\r\nthe Tycoon's Government that the English harboured aggressive designs\r\nagainst the island of Tsushima, which is a long double or \"twin\" island,\r\npossessing wonderful harbours, and situated midway between the main\r\nisland of Japan and the southern coast of Korea. On March 13, 1861, the\r\nRussians landed from the corvette Possadnik in Tsushima, and saying their\r\nship wanted repairs, began to build houses on shore. Captain Birileff had\r\nforced the Prince of Tsushima to receive him at his capital, which created\r\nan intense feeling of indignation, especially in the ranks of the nobles,\r\nwho each saw himself exposed to similar intrusions. The Daimio repeatedly\r\nrequested the Russians to leave, but was always told the ship required\r\nfurther repairs. In consequence of reports from his own officers and the\r\nJapanese Government, Vice-Admiral Sir James Hope looked in at Tsushima\r\nhimself in the month of August, and observing what was going on there,\r\nhe addressed a letter to Captain Birileff, of which the substance was as\r\nfollows: The prolonged stay of his Imperial Majesty's corvette Possadnik,\r\nthe erection of buildings, &c., having created alarm in Yedo, the admiral\r\nhad the intention to communicate on the subject as early as possible\r\nwith Commodore Likatchoff. Would Captain Birileff meantime facilitate\r\nthis correspondence by replying to the questions--(1) Should the Japanese\r\nGovernment appeal to the treaty, which conveys no right either to create\r\nestablishments ashore, to survey the Japanese coast without Government\r\nsanction, or even to enter a non-treaty port except in case of necessity,\r\nwould Captain Birileff's orders admit of his leaving Tsushima immediately\r\non the request of the Japanese authorities? (2) Was it Captain Birileff's\r\nintention to leave Tsushima in October as previously stated to Commander\r\nWard, leaving the buildings to whomsoever wanted them?... (3) Had the\r\ncaptain orders to create a permanent establishment there?\r\n\r\nThe reply of Captain Birileff was to the effect that the officers of his\r\nImperial Majesty were accountable only to their own chiefs; ... that he\r\nwas quite astonished to hear of the alarms in Yedo, seeing that only two\r\nmonths before the Prince of Bungo had been sent to Tsushima expressly\r\nfrom Yedo to grant permission to the corvette to remain there; that the\r\nsame prince gave him the opportunity of visiting the Prince of Tsushima,\r\nwho was instructed to supply workmen and all that might be necessary\r\nfor the construction of the buildings in question; that if the Japanese\r\nGovernment were annoyed by the surveying operations, they should address\r\ntheir complaint to the Russian diplomatic agent; that he had no orders\r\nfor the occupation of the island, and the nature of the buildings which\r\nthe admiral had done him the honour to visit would not show any such\r\nintention; and finally, that when he spoke of leaving in October it had\r\nreferred only to himself personally. So far Captain Birileff.\r\n\r\nIt was no \"Prince of Bungo,\" but a Governor of Foreign Affairs named\r\nBungo, who had been despatched in haste from the capital to endeavour by\r\nany means to induce the Russians to leave Tsushima, and was, for his want\r\nof success, disgraced.\r\n\r\nSir James Hope forthwith proceeded in search of Commodore Likatchoff to\r\nOlga Bay, whence he addressed to him a letter dated September 5, pointing\r\nout the irregularity of the proceedings at Tsushima, the bad effect they\r\nwere having on the relations of foreigners generally in Yedo, and that he\r\ncould not recognise any establishment on Japanese territory not sanctioned\r\nby treaty--which resolutions he would make known to the authorities\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nTo this the Russian commodore courteously replied from Hakodate, September\r\n23, excusing himself from entering on any international questions, and\r\npointing out that in their hydrographical labours the Russians were only\r\nfollowing the excellent example set them by the British surveying officers\r\nwhom they met on their respective missions, and that no complaint had ever\r\nbeen made by the Japanese Government. As for the \"absurd rumours\" alluded\r\nto, the Possadnik had already received orders for another destination,\r\nbefore receipt of the admiral's letters, and nothing consequently need be\r\nsaid to calm the doubts and alarms, \"si même elles auraient véritablement\r\nraison d'exister.\"\r\n\r\nAdmiral Hope acknowledged this letter, \"with much satisfaction,\" from\r\nChefoo, October 22, and remarked that, so far as the surveying operations\r\nof the ships in his squadron were concerned, they were carried out with\r\nthe full consent of the Japanese Government, at whose special request\r\nJapanese officers and interpreters were accommodated on board during\r\nthe whole of the cruise. He added that it was not so much the surveying\r\noperations of the Possadnik as the preparation for a permanent settlement\r\non shore that disquieted the Japanese Government; and, moreover, that\r\nthe Japanese Ministers had distinctly stated that the matter had been\r\nthe subject of remonstrance to the commodore, through M. Goskavitch,\r\nthe consul at Hakodate, and to Captain Birileff by an officer specially\r\ndeputed for the purpose (Bungo).\r\n\r\nThe question extended itself to St Petersburg, where Prince Gortchakoff\r\nhad remarked to Lord Napier, then British ambassador, on the tone of\r\nAdmiral Hope's letter to Commodore Likatchoff, which, he said, but for\r\nthe conciliatory disposition of the latter, might have led to serious\r\nmisunderstanding. Lord Napier, in reply, observed that \"Admiral Hope was\r\na man of a frank, downright, energetic character, who used the language\r\nnatural to him without any intention of giving offence.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Russians had abandoned the island, Prince Gortchakoff called\r\non Lord Napier to declare that the English would never take possession\r\nof Tsushima, whereupon the ambassador reminded his Excellency that the\r\nEnglish had \"offered to sign a treaty binding ourselves and the other\r\nPowers having engagements with Japan to make no acquisitions in those\r\nseas.\" \"I think,\" concludes the ambassador in his letter to the Foreign\r\nOffice, \"that Admiral Hope will do well to assure himself that the\r\nbuildings have really been evacuated.\" This precaution had already been\r\ntaken, and the admiral reported on November 10 that the Russians had\r\nevacuated on September 29.\r\n\r\nThere the incident ended, but not its historical significance.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. TRADE AND TRADERS.\r\n\r\n    Commerce increases in spite of adverse political\r\n    situations--And of efforts of Japanese government to repress\r\n    it--The _personnel_ of the mercantile community--British\r\n    predominance--Relations of merchants to Ministers--Interests\r\n    and duties not always identical--Sumptuary laws--Discharges of\r\n    firearms forbidden--Seizure of Mr Moss--Wounding of a Japanese\r\n    policeman--Trial and sentence of Mr Moss--His liberation in\r\n    Hongkong--Sues the Minister and obtains damages--Legal supremacy\r\n    at Hongkong--Defects of the consular jurisdiction--The recreation\r\n    of shooting.\r\n\r\nThese fierce struggles, the sudden arousing to intensity of dormant\r\npassions, the dislocation of the whole structure of Japanese polity,\r\nrepresented to the foreign nations merely the risks and sacrifices\r\nincidental to the expansion of their commerce. In order to compel the\r\nGovernment to permit the people to exchange the products of their soil for\r\nthe merchandise of the strangers within their gates, the labour, anxiety,\r\nand expense which we have only faintly indicated were voluntarily incurred\r\nby the Western treaty Powers, and by them in turn forced on the reluctant\r\nrulers of Japan. An _a priori_ judgment of the probable effect of the\r\nsanguinary conditions into which official intercourse had been thrown\r\nwould probably have concluded that peaceful commerce could not under such\r\ncircumstances exist. The restrictions resulting from an ill-regulated\r\ncurrency, and from the direct interference of the Government, might have\r\nbeen deemed sufficient of themselves to check the development of trade.\r\nWhen to these inimical influences were superadded the further facts that\r\nthe foreign traders went in peril of their lives, that the communities\r\nof Nagasaki and Yokohama were at different times in such danger that\r\nprovisional arrangements were made for conveying them, bag and baggage, on\r\nboard ship, a condition of things less favourable to international traffic\r\ncould scarcely be conceived. Yet these difficulties, and a score of others\r\nwhich could be enumerated, served only to bring into clear recognition\r\nthe inherent vitality of commerce, which, like running water, finds its\r\nway through or round almost any obstacle. There were, on the other hand,\r\ncircumstances favourable to trade. In Japan, as has been already hinted,\r\nthe traders of the country had neither part nor lot in the strife that\r\nraged above and around them, and for the most part they could pursue their\r\npeaceful avocations without fear or hindrance. So the quality of commerce\r\nwas not strained; but, shedding its benefits on buyer and seller alike,\r\nit grew from small beginnings till it attained to a volume of world-wide\r\nimportance, accumulating momentum as it progressed.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of foreign trade was a little over one million sterling\r\nper annum for the first three years of the open ports. In the fourth year,\r\n1863, the development of Japanese produce, especially the more precious\r\ncommodities, silk and the eggs of the silkworm, began to tell on the gross\r\nvalues, and the exports for that year amounted to two and a half millions\r\nsterling, the imports of foreign goods being £811,000. The year 1864,\r\nnotwithstanding its crowded events of anti-commercial character, witnessed\r\na notable advance in the value of foreign trade, which in that year\r\ndoubled itself. The same thing occurred again in 1865, when the figures\r\nreached a total of eight millions sterling, being double the returns for\r\n1864.\r\n\r\nThus the foreign trade of Japan had fairly established itself as \"a going\r\nconcern,\" advancing in war and peace, but with great fluctuations and many\r\nvicissitudes to those engaged in it. From the purely commercial standpoint\r\nthe result justified the anticipations of the Powers who opened Japan to\r\nthe world. The event proved that when the materials of trade exist there\r\ntrade is sure to follow on the removal of obstructions. And the materials\r\nof trade are not wanting wherever there is a population that wears clothes\r\nand builds houses.[11]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious to remark that had it been in the power of the Japanese\r\nGovernment to place an effective interdict on foreign commerce at its\r\nsources within their own jurisdiction, and beyond the reach of treaty\r\nobligations, it would have been the surest means of causing the withdrawal\r\nof foreigners from the country. That the Government had the will to do so\r\nwas shown by their repeated partial attempts at preventing produce from\r\nreaching the open ports, and even inducing a temporary exodus therefrom\r\nof the native population. Why their measures of repression were not more\r\nthorough may be conjectured to have been connected with the circumstance\r\nthat the advantages of the foreign trade soon began to be felt in quarters\r\nwith which it was not convenient for the Tycoon to inter-meddle.\r\n\r\nAs in China, so in Japan, the relations of the merchants to their\r\nofficial representatives exercised a certain influence on events. The\r\ntrade was carried on at first by a very small number of people. In 1861\r\nthere were not 200 foreign residents in all the ports of Japan, the\r\nBritish nationality predominating in Yokohama, the Dutch at Nagasaki.\r\nThe British residents in the former port seem to have numbered about\r\nfifty. It was a small body to carry the burden of inaugurating commercial\r\nintercourse with an empire of thirty millions of people. Nor was it\r\nindividually a community of any particular weight, being mostly composed\r\nof young men, not themselves principals, but, in the beginning at least,\r\na considerable number of them occupying the position of delegates of\r\nmercantile houses in China. It was their representative character which\r\nlent importance to the foreign merchants in Japan. They represented,\r\nfirst of all, the establishments of which they were subordinates or\r\noffshoots; they represented their respective nations; and they, in\r\na larger sense, represented the commercial creed of Christendom. The\r\npresent sketch would be wanting in symmetry if no account were taken\r\nof the relationship of these handfuls of traders to their own national\r\nauthorities, both being engaged in the struggle for the development and\r\nsecurity of commerce under the trying conditions of the time and country.\r\nBut of course any such inquiry practically limits itself to those of\r\nBritish nationality, for two reasons: British trade and British diplomacy\r\nwere pre-eminently representative of all others by the preponderance of\r\nthe interests involved; in addition to which, the strong individuality\r\nand matured experience of the first British envoy were such that his\r\ncolleagues tacitly assigned to him the leading _rôle_, so that his was the\r\npersonality which exerted the dominant influence in shaping events from\r\nthe opening of the ports.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to divergence of view between the merchants and their\r\nofficial representatives has already been remarked upon in connection with\r\naffairs in China: it was most pronounced in times of difficulty such as\r\nwere chronic for more than twenty years in Canton, where it was so acute\r\nat one time that English Chambers of Commerce made formal complaint to the\r\nForeign Office that its representative in China--Sir John Davis--refused\r\nto see the merchants in Canton, who desired to present their views to him\r\nin time of danger. The antagonism was natural: it is generically the same\r\nthat one hears constantly in this country in the form of complaints and\r\ncriticisms of Government, Government servants, and generally of all in\r\nauthority--with, however, this difference, that in the many-sided life of\r\na large society there are buffers between the critics and the criticised.\r\nThey do not meet face to face unless it be in such circumstances as on\r\nthe floor of \"the House\" with \"a substantial piece of furniture\" between;\r\nwhereas in nascent communities composed of a few scores of individuals,\r\nwhere there is no tempering medium, where the parties are never out\r\nof each other's sight, differences are apt to become accentuated like\r\nvillage scandals. Nothing escapes censure; the smallest indiscretions\r\nhave a magnifying lens constantly applied to them, and a sinister colour\r\nis given to innocent trifles. Interests are not diversified, shaded\r\noff, or balanced as in adult nations, but are narrow, concentrated, and\r\nhighly sensitive. Between Minister and merchants there was of course a\r\ngeneral identity of interest. They had a common test to apply to all\r\ntheir proceedings and aspirations, the furtherance of commerce. The\r\nofficial would, perhaps, add the qualifying adjective \"legitimate,\" in the\r\ninterpretation of which differences of opinion might arise; and he would\r\nnaturally give a wider scope to the commercial idea than those actually\r\nengaged in trade could or ought to do.\r\n\r\nThe Minister represents the interests of Great Britain as a whole; the\r\nmerchants represent trade generally, but each of them his own interests\r\nparticularly, and these various interests cannot always coincide. An\r\nEnglishman would naturally give a preference to the manufactures of his\r\nown country, but as a merchant he has to study the requirements of the\r\ncountry in which he trades, and if he cannot supply them at all, or so\r\nwell, by articles manufactured in his own country, he is obliged to seek\r\nthem elsewhere. Officials are apt to look askance on this as not fostering\r\nthe trade of Great Britain; and while recognising the necessity, the fact\r\ndoes not warm their sympathy for the merchants of their own country. There\r\nare times also when, from the international point of view, the general\r\ninterests of the country may override the special interests of the small\r\nBritish community in Japan. If policy requires intimate relations between\r\nthe Governments, the tendency must inevitably be for the British Minister\r\nto minimise the just causes of complaint of his countrymen in order to\r\navoid irritation. But the sufferers can hardly be expected to appreciate\r\nsacrifices so forced on them; and so from one cause and another there will\r\nnever be wanting grounds of dissatisfaction, and possibly estrangement.\r\n\r\nBut the ultimate object being definitely agreed upon between the two\r\nparties, there would still remain room for variance in the means,\r\nquestions of tactics, of the nearer or the further view, of the present\r\ngeneration and the next, and so on _ad infinitum_. Where there was a\r\nthird party influencing and opposing legitimate commerce by direct or\r\nindirect means, as the Government of China or Japan, whose machinations\r\ncalled for strong measures of resistance, the occasions of impatience and\r\ndissatisfaction would be frequent, and friction between the representative\r\nand his constituents would naturally result. But perhaps the most\r\nantagonistic of all to harmony was the fact already pointed out, that in\r\nextra-territorialised countries like China and Japan the representatives\r\nof the treaty Powers were necessarily intrusted with exceptional authority\r\nover the persons of their nationals--for they had to assume the functions\r\ndenied to the native Governments, of giving the law to the settlers and\r\npunishing evil-doers. What an invidious and onerous position this entailed\r\non British officials will presently be shown. Yet it was a temporary\r\nnecessity, for which nobody was blamable.\r\n\r\nIn treating of the period of the consulship in Shanghai, a certain\r\ndistance or aloofness between Consul Alcock and the community of his\r\nnationals was remarked upon, due to difference of age, taste, culture, or\r\ntemperament. This characteristic was rather accentuated than otherwise\r\nby the local circumstances of Japan. The Minister was ten years older,\r\nwhile the community was about as much younger than in Shanghai, so\r\nthat the disparity of age was increased. The mere conditions of life\r\nalso placed a material gulf between the diplomatic representatives in\r\nYedo and the lay residents of Yokohama. The capital city being closed\r\nto all but the diplomatic body, visitors not only required a pass from\r\none of the Ministers, but, in the absence of available accommodation,\r\nstrangers had to rely on the hospitality of the foreign Legations. The\r\ncuriosity to see Yedo, which in the early days so attracted tourists\r\nand travellers, threw a heavy and most unfair burden of entertainment on\r\nthe Ministers, the principal victim of these birds of passage being of\r\ncourse the representative of Great Britain. So long, therefore, as the\r\nLegations remained in Yedo the barrier was effectual against personal\r\nintercourse between the Ministers and the permanent residents in Yokohama,\r\neven had mutual affinity been stronger than it was. Like most things,\r\nthis local separation between the communities and their representative\r\nhad its advantages and disadvantages. While on the one hand it was not\r\nconducive to intimacy, on the other the risk of personal friction was\r\neliminated by it. Nor was direct intercourse at all necessary in the\r\nconduct of business, seeing the regular official medium of communication\r\nwas the local consuls, who had nothing of the Olympian about them, and\r\nwere felt by the residents to be men of like passions with themselves,\r\nwith easy manners, the spirit of good fellowship, and imbued with the\r\ncharacteristic sporting proclivities of Englishmen at home and abroad,\r\nalways an effective bond of sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe relations of Sir Rutherford Alcock with the mercantile community\r\nhad not been very happily inaugurated, for he clearly felt officially\r\naggrieved by their settling in Yokohama, instead of waiting till\r\naccommodation could be found for them in Kanagawa; so much so, indeed,\r\nthat he seemed almost to deplore the absence of means of coercing them\r\ninto obedience to his will.\r\n\r\nWhile the sore as to the location of the settlement was still somewhat\r\nraw, the Minister found yet another grievance against the merchants\r\nin the fabulous demands for Japanese coins which a few of them had put\r\nforward, by way of burlesquing the system of distribution by the native\r\nauthorities. The severity with which this schoolboyish escapade was\r\npilloried, and the community of Yokohama held up to the opprobrium of\r\nthe world, was felt by them as going beyond what the merits of the case\r\nwarranted, and the incident did not tend to mollify acerbities on either\r\nside.\r\n\r\nA year later evidence of a certain widening of the breach became more\r\nconspicuous in the course of a rather exceptional lawsuit, in which a\r\nmerchant was heavily mulcted for an offence of which the general opinion\r\nwas that he was not guilty. A certain Mr Moss was arrested, cruelly\r\nmaltreated, and hidden from his official protector, the consul, by a posse\r\nof Japanese police, for having shot game in the vicinity of Kanagawa.\r\nWhen faced by these armed men, Mr Moss cocked his gun and threatened\r\nany one who should approach to lay hands on him. The party was numerous\r\nenough to surround and wrest the gun from him, which somehow went off,\r\nwounding one of the men badly in the arm. The Minister ordered the consul\r\nto prosecute Mr Moss for murder, in the Queen's name, the consul himself\r\nbeing judge, sitting with two assessors. The accused was sentenced to pay\r\na fine of 1000 dollars (£225) and to be deported from Japan. The assessors\r\ndissented, on the ground that the Japanese evidence was falsified to\r\norder, and that the prisoner was in their opinion innocent of the charge\r\non which he was tried. In consequence of this dissent the judgment had\r\nto be referred to the Minister, who added to the consul's sentence three\r\nmonths' imprisonment in Hongkong, whither the culprit was conveyed in a\r\nBritish ship of war. After a week's incarceration in the Hongkong jail the\r\nwarrant for imprisonment was found defective, and Mr Moss was released.\r\nHe was then advised to bring an action against Sir Rutherford Alcock in\r\nthe Supreme Court at Hongkong, which occupied twelve months, and ended\r\nin a jury awarding damages against the Minister for false imprisonment,\r\nthat being the only part of the sentence which could be brought within\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Hongkong court. As regards the original sentence\r\nof fine and deportation, the Foreign Office, by advice of their law\r\nofficers, had long before quashed the conviction and ordered the fine to\r\nbe remitted.\r\n\r\nA parallel case had occurred in Canton in 1846. Sir John Davis instructed\r\nthe consul there to levy a fine on a British subject for an alleged\r\noffence. Whether just or not, it was illegal, and on appeal to the Supreme\r\nCourt in Hongkong, of which colony Sir John Davis himself was governor,\r\nthe judgment of the consul was reversed, and the fine of 200 dollars\r\nrefunded. Even Sir Frederick Bruce, with all his circumspection, did\r\nnot escape falling into the same error with regard to the division of\r\nlegal authority between himself and the Supreme Court. \"From a careful\r\nperusal of ... her Majesty's Order in Council,\" he writes, \"the chief\r\nsuperintendent of trade [himself] in cases arising under this section is\r\nthe Supreme Court in China: it is for him to prescribe to the consul the\r\ncourse he is to pursue, and the Supreme Court at Hongkong cannot interfere\r\nin such matters.\" Her Majesty's Government, however, replied: \"You fall\r\ninto an error by confounding two distinct questions.... You are mistaken\r\nin treating the question which you have referred to them for decision as\r\ndepending upon the 4th and following articles of the Order in Council,\"\r\nand so on. So that had it fallen to his lot to give a decision involving\r\na penalty, he would have been sued not before himself, but before the\r\nSupreme Court at Hongkong, and would have sustained the same reverse as\r\nSir Rutherford Alcock had done.\r\n\r\nThese bald facts of the case supplied a striking illustration of the vices\r\nof the consular court system, which was in vogue in China for twenty years\r\nuntil the establishment of the Supreme Court for China and Japan in 1865.\r\nConsuls were called upon to exercise judicial functions, and Ministers\r\nthose of Courts of Appeal, without the slightest preparatory training,\r\nand as often as not without natural aptitude. In criminal cases they were\r\nat once prosecutors and judges, it might even be executioners as well.\r\nThe state of conflict in which they lived with the native authorities, of\r\nwhom they were accustomed to demand in vain the punishment of malefactors,\r\nplaced British officers under continual temptation to prove how promptly\r\nthey could bring to justice their own nationals accused of offences\r\nagainst the natives. This idea of giving object-lessons to Chinese and\r\nJapanese pervades the consular and diplomatic records. English officials\r\nseem to have been oppressed with the reflection of what the natives would\r\nthink of the failure of justice in any particular case, and they were\r\never apprehensive of political dangers or embarrassments as contingent on\r\nmisunderstood lenity to \"white men\"--natural and proper feelings on the\r\npart of mere political agents, but quite foreign to the administration\r\nof justice according to the rules and maxims of civilised nations. It\r\nseems not unlikely that the obvious lessons of the Moss case itself as\r\nto the incompatibility of judicial and administrative functions, and the\r\nunfair responsibility which their combination threw upon the consular\r\nand diplomatic officers, hastened the realisation of the scheme of an\r\nindependent judiciary which was so strongly advocated by Sir Rutherford\r\nAlcock in 'The Capital of the Tycoon.'\r\n\r\nThese various incidents, and sundry vexatious restrictions imposed on them\r\nfrom time to time for their own security, no doubt disposed the residents\r\nto look askance at many acts of the Minister, the reasons for which failed\r\nto impress them. But though the surface of the relations between the\r\nMinister and the merchants was thus perturbed, and regrettable, in the\r\ncommon interest, as the lukewarmness of personal sympathy may have been,\r\nthe residents never failed in their respect for the high and sterling\r\nqualities of the Minister, and the courageous manner in which he fought\r\nfor his country's interests. It only needed an emergency to give definite\r\nexpression to this feeling, and no testimony could be stronger, more\r\ngenuine, or less conventional than the farewell addresses in which the\r\nmerchants of Yokohama and Nagasaki summed up the brilliant record of a\r\nman of whom they never ceased to feel proud. Instead of detracting from\r\nthe value of such spontaneous testimony, the minor differences only lent\r\nemphasis to it, and set the seal of deep conviction on what in an ordinary\r\ncase might have passed as the language of mere compliment.\r\n\r\nAs shooting has been alluded to as an occasion of trouble, a word or two\r\non the subject of this amusement may have an interest for certain readers.\r\nTo the Japanese the pursuit of game seemed to be as strange a form of\r\nsport as the other vagaries of the foreigner. Firearms were not in use\r\nwith them, cold steel being the regulation weapon of offence. There was a\r\ntradition that the discharge of firearms within twenty-five miles of the\r\nTycoon's palace was prohibited by law,--what law or how promulgated was\r\nnever clearly made out, though the motive was intelligible enough. For\r\nwhatever reason, such game as there was in the country had evidently not\r\nbeen disturbed; the pheasants were not wilder than the English stall-fed\r\nvariety. Small shooting-parties were in the habit of going out for a day,\r\nor half a day, from Yokohama and Kanagawa with dogs and native beaters\r\namong the coppices where the birds lay. The country itself was so charming\r\nto walk or ride over, the peasant-folk were so polite and merry, that\r\nheavy bags were not needed to attract sportsmen. Still, a good shot with\r\nindustry and a shrewd acquaintance with the habits of the game could\r\noften get several brace of the splendid green pheasant of the country\r\n(_Phasianus versicolor_) in an afternoon; while at rarer intervals the\r\nfinger would tremble on the trigger as one of those magnificent birds\r\ncalled locally the \"copper\" pheasant (Soemerring's), with tail feathers\r\nas long as a peacock's, would rise from the furrows and sail grandly\r\ninto the impenetrable thicket. Objections had been taken by the Japanese\r\nofficials to this form of amusement, because it was not the policy of the\r\nrulers to familiarise the people with the sight of firearms, still less\r\nto facilitate their acquiring them. In accordance with representations\r\nfrom the authorities, the British consul had requested his nationals in\r\n1859 to desist for a time until some arrangement was come to. This they\r\ndid, but in the following season resumed the sport, in which there were\r\nno keener participants than the British consular officers. A contemporary\r\nwriter in September 1860 thus refers to the return of the shooting season:\r\n\"There being nothing to do, we are all looking forward anxiously to the\r\n1st October, on which day the first onslaught on the feathered race takes\r\nplace. The weather is now hot, but we are all in very good health....\r\nWe live in a beautiful country, among a civil, amicable, kind-hearted,\r\nand intelligent people. We can roam over the country without let or\r\nhindrance.\" It is curious to note by the way how tenacious the Englishman\r\nis of the punctilio of his game laws, carrying his observance of them into\r\ncountries where he and his laws are alike strangers, and where in many\r\ncases the principles are not applicable to the local conditions.\r\n\r\nA new element in the sport appeared with the advent of cold weather, in\r\nthe form of flocks of wildfowl, chiefly geese, which spread themselves\r\nover the low-lying grounds, mostly at some miles distant from the\r\nsettlements. They were \"geese,\" indeed, quite unsophisticated, having no\r\nfear of man before their eyes--inherited instinct apparently at fault.\r\n\"Their tameness was shocking\" at first, but they wonderfully soon learned\r\nto be wary with a foreigner and a gun. The morning's bag of one early\r\nriser, riding six miles and back to a nine o'clock breakfast, late in\r\nNovember, dwindled rapidly from 12 to 6, 4, 2. The birds were shot within\r\n200 yards of the _tokaido_, and in full view of many curious spectators,\r\narmed and unarmed. Men were hired on the spot to carry the game along the\r\nsix miles of highroad and through the long street of Kanagawa, the whole\r\nproceeding, in short, enjoying the utmost possible publicity.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Mr Moss, however, a few days later, toiled a whole day\r\nand bagged one, with the consequences we have seen. Whether it was law\r\nor not, the evidence supplied by the birds themselves of prescriptive\r\nimmunity from gunpowder attack was overwhelming. Hitherto the heavy winged\r\nwildfowl had felt safe so long as they kept out of sword-range of the\r\nhuman biped, but the new experience of a detonating missile fatal at fifty\r\nyards broke up in a week the habits of generations, and forced them to\r\npromptly readjust themselves to their environment.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [1] \"We are never for a moment unwatched; ... if my servant\r\n    runs after a butterfly, a two-sworded official runs after\r\n    him.\"--Laurence Oliphant, Letter from Yedo, July 1861.\r\n\r\n [2] \"As a general rule, our guardians exercise their functions with\r\n    civility; when they are impertinent, one has to submit as one\r\n    would to one's jailor.... With entire humility, one is in no\r\n    danger whatever.\"--Oliphant, 2nd July 1861.\r\n\r\n [3] The effect of the commercial isolation of Japan on the value\r\n    of general commodities was no less striking. The first foreign\r\n    traders might have bought with eyes shut nearly every article that\r\n    was offered to them, so great was the disparity of prices between\r\n    Japan and her nearest markets. Mr Hunter gives an interesting\r\n    example. \"I had in go-downs,\" he says, \"8000 piculs of sapan-wood\r\n    imported from Manila unsaleable at one dollar and a quarter per\r\n    picul, which was about its cost. Immediately that the opening\r\n    of the port of Simoda to foreign trade was announced officially,\r\n    an English vessel was chartered to carry it there. Brief--it was\r\n    sold for 35 dollars per picul, and the proceeds were invested in\r\n    Japanese vegetable wax at a cost of 6½ dollars, and sold for $17\r\n    the picul (133⅓ lb. English),\" so that in the short voyage from\r\n    China to Japan and back the capital multiplied seventy times!\r\n\r\n [4] A story is told of two Samurai meeting on a bridge which was too\r\n    narrow to allow of their passing each other. Neither being willing\r\n    to give way, they were about to settle the difficulty at the\r\n    point of the sword, when a peasant, strolling along the dry bed of\r\n    the stream, offered to extricate them without loss of dignity on\r\n    either side. Amused at his impertinence, and curious to see how\r\n    he would effect his purpose, they consented to humour him; and\r\n    when each, following his instructions, was seated in one of the\r\n    baskets at either end of the pole he was carrying, he swung it\r\n    round on to the opposite shoulder, asked pardon, bowed, and went\r\n    on his way, leaving them each facing in the direction in which he\r\n    would proceed.\r\n\r\n [5] Ieyasu says the Samurai are the masters of the four classes.\r\n    Agriculturists, artisans, and merchants may not behave in a rude\r\n    manner towards Samurai. The term for a rude man is, \"other than\r\n    expected fellow\"; and a Samurai is not to be interfered with in\r\n    cutting down a fellow who has behaved to him in a manner other\r\n    than is expected. The Samurai are grouped into direct retainers,\r\n    secondary retainers and nobles, and retainers of high and low\r\n    grade; but the same line of conduct is equally allowable to them\r\n    all towards an \"other than expected fellow.\"\r\n\r\n [6] \"All my old friends have disappeared,\" writes Laurence Oliphant\r\n    on his return to Yedo as secretary of Legation. \"One who was an\r\n    especial favourite of mine when I was here last, ripped himself\r\n    up a short time ago; and two of the other commissioners are\r\n    disgraced, and it is supposed have followed his example. This was\r\n    all on account of their friendship for foreigners. Every one, down\r\n    to the lowest interpreter, who has had anything to do with the\r\n    introduction of foreigners, has disappeared or been disgraced.\"\r\n\r\n [7] This man, Murioka by name, became afterwards well known to\r\n    foreigners, and was always ready to talk freely about the whole\r\n    transaction. When asked why he struck at a lady he would reply,\r\n    \"How should I know, never having seen a foreign woman, least of\r\n    all on horseback?\"\r\n\r\n [8] It was a common thing for a Daimio to rid himself of the irksome\r\n    obligations of his position by abdicating in favour of his son.\r\n    On better acquaintance Shimadso Saburo proved a most genial old\r\n    gentleman. Three years later he entertained Sir Harry and Lady\r\n    Parkes at his capital most hospitably.\r\n\r\n [9] Count Inouyé, the foremost statesman of the new Japan, is said\r\n    to have confessed that he set fire to the British Legation with\r\n    his own hand with the express object of embarrassing the Tycoon's\r\n    Government.\r\n\r\n [10] The following souvenir of Count Mutsu, Foreign Minister of\r\n    Japan, who died in 1897, told by Mr J. F. Lowder and quoted in\r\n    'Things Japanese' by Mr Basil Hall Chamberlain, affords a graphic\r\n    illustration of this point. \"In the very early Sixties, when\r\n    he was in his nineteenth or twentieth year, he was in Nagasaki\r\n    desirous of acquiring a knowledge of English. A lady of my\r\n    acquaintance taking an interest in him used to devote an hour or\r\n    two every morning to teaching him to read and write, but it was\r\n    not long before he came to me despairing of his slow progress, and\r\n    asking whether I could not give him a berth on board ship where\r\n    nothing but English was spoken. Believing him to be physically too\r\n    weak to stand such an ordeal, I endeavoured to dissuade him, but\r\n    without success; and so with some misgivings I shipped him as a\r\n    cabin-boy, which was the only position I could obtain for him, on\r\n    board a small British schooner that used in those days to voyage\r\n    between Nagasaki and Shanghai. How long he remained on board I\r\n    cannot say, but my recollection is that it was a very considerable\r\n    time.\"\r\n\r\n [11] The foreign trade of Japan now (1900) approximates 40 millions\r\n    sterling, exports and imports being very nearly balanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nSIR RUTHERFORD ALCOCK IN PEKING, 1865-1869.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE BRITISH LEGATION.\r\n\r\n    Contrast between Peking and Yedo--Finds old comrade Wade--The\r\n    Manchu statesmen, Kung and Wênsiang--Material progress pressed\r\n    upon them--Their failure to appreciate foreign advice.\r\n\r\nSir Rutherford Alcock had spent only a few months in England when he was\r\nappointed to succeed Sir Frederick Bruce as Minister to China, he himself\r\nbeing succeeded in Japan by Sir Harry Parkes. Sir Rutherford reached\r\nhis post in Peking at the close of 1865. The change of scene from Japan\r\nback to China was even more striking than that from China to Japan had\r\nbeen in 1859. The excitement of shooting the rapids was succeeded by the\r\nweariness of meandering among mud-shoals--the same medium to work in,\r\nonly under different conditions. Fundamentally the international problem\r\nwas identical in Japan and China--the conflict between aggression and\r\nresistance. Rational dread of, and natural repulsion to, foreigners,\r\ninspired alike the policies of both countries. Where they differed was\r\nin the manner of meeting the invasion. Japan braced herself nervously\r\nto the effort, and, distinguishing between what was feasible and what\r\nwas not, organised a counter-invasion unsuspected by foreign nations,\r\nwhom she subdued by their own strength. China, on the other hand,\r\nopposed a fatalistic and unreasoning resistance, making no intelligent\r\ncounter-stroke and showing no true anticipation of the issues of the\r\nstruggle. The energy of ambitious youth on the one side; on the other mere\r\ninertia, irresponsive to the stimulus of pride, shame, patriotism, or even\r\nmaterial interest. Bearing this contrast in mind, we may partly understand\r\nthe prosaic _rôle_ which foreign representatives were doomed in China to\r\nplay from the time the capital was forced open by Anglo-French arms in\r\n1860.\r\n\r\nThe position of the new British Minister was different from that which he\r\nhad occupied in Japan, where, being first in the field, he had to make\r\nprecedents, whereas in China he had to follow the course which had been\r\nmarked out during the previous four years. In judging of the wisdom of\r\nthat course, it is fair to apply the same retrospective criterion that we\r\nproposed in the case of Japan--namely, to consider the situation so far as\r\nit was known and could be realised at the time. Notwithstanding all that\r\nhad gone before, China in general, and Peking in particular, remained as\r\ngreat mysteries to foreigners as Japan itself. The pioneer diplomatists\r\nhad to create their diplomacy out of their own consciousness, working upon\r\nan idea which they imported, and not on the objective facts, which were\r\nmere chaos to them.\r\n\r\nSir Rutherford Alcock had the happiness to find the Peking Legation\r\nin charge of his old vice-consul, Thomas Wade, from whom he had been\r\nofficially separated for ten years. Mr Wade was Chinese secretary and\r\nsecretary of Legation, offices which were some years later separated, to\r\nthe infinite detriment of both. For the secretary of Legation, drawn from\r\nthe ranks of the diplomatic service, had neither knowledge of nor interest\r\nin Chinese affairs, nor aught to do but wait idly for the contingency\r\nwhich might make him _chargé d'affaires_, reckoning every month spent\r\nin the country as a penance entitling him to swift promotion to a more\r\ncongenial sphere. And the Chinese secretaryship, by itself, offered no\r\nattraction to an ambitious man. But in 1865 the combination of offices was\r\nmost important, especially in the hands of a man of so much distinction\r\nas Mr Wade. As the custodian of the Bruce tradition, if indeed he had not\r\na large share in its evolution, he bridged the gulf between the outgoing\r\nand the incoming Minister, much as the Permanent Under-Secretary does at\r\nthe Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nAs Mr (afterwards Sir Thomas) Wade, in the capacity of secretary, _chargé\r\nd'affaires_, and Minister Plenipotentiary, represented Great Britain at\r\nthe Chinese Court for the best part of a quarter of a century, a term\r\nequal to that of the other six Ministers put together, a brief reference\r\nto his personality seems necessary to a just comprehension of the course\r\nof affairs during his long residence in Peking.\r\n\r\nMr Wade began life as a soldier. He had been in the \"Black Watch,\" but,\r\nbeing the only officer who could not speak Gaelic, found it congenial to\r\nexchange into the 98th Regiment, with which he served in China during the\r\nfirst war. He was adjutant of the regiment, which was commanded by Colonel\r\nCampbell, afterwards Lord Clyde. When peace was made in 1842, he resigned\r\nhis commission and betook himself to the study of Chinese and of Chinese\r\nsubjects. After qualifying as interpreter he became Chinese secretary to\r\nthe Superintendency of Trade, which until 1858 was domiciled in Hongkong.\r\nTransferred to the consular service, he was for some years interpreter and\r\nvice-consul at Shanghai, where it fell to his lot to command the local\r\nvolunteers in the attack on the Chinese Imperial camps in 1854. He was\r\nthe first executive head of the Maritime Customs, established in the same\r\nyear, his services being lent by his chief to start the new institution.\r\nAttached to Lord Elgin in his two missions to China, he was appointed\r\nsecretary of Legation and Chinese secretary under Sir Frederick Bruce when\r\nthe Legation was installed in Peking.\r\n\r\nWheresoever Mr Wade's lot was cast he was beloved for his Irish geniality,\r\nopen-mindedness, and sincerity. He was the soul of honour, and was\r\npossessed by the spirit of chivalry much beyond the common measure. His\r\nbest friends would never wish to forget his endearing infirmities of\r\ntemper, associated as they were with the generous _amende_ which never\r\nfailed to follow an over-hasty word. A well-read man, with a memory like\r\nMacaulay's, a brilliant _raconteur_ and inimitable mimic, he was the\r\ndelight of every society. The services which he was enabled, by many\r\nyears of arduous labour, to render to succeeding generations of students\r\nof Chinese are incalculable, and if his work begins now to be superseded\r\nby that of others, this is but the common fate of pioneers in every\r\ndepartment of research.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Wade's character may thus be fitly and fairly summed up in\r\nthe hackneyed epithet, \"a scholar and a gentleman,\"--but not therefore\r\na statesman. His mind was cast in another and a finer mould than befits\r\nthe political arena; and, unnatural as the inference may seem, it is\r\nopen to question whether his extensive knowledge of China was the best\r\nqualification for dealing at first hand with current affairs, even in\r\nthat country. Profound researches into Chinese literature and philosophy\r\ntend to overshadow and induce a distaste for the jarring questions of\r\nthe day. Seen through the luminous haze of its classic history, China\r\npresents to the contemplative mind an object of reverence unlike any\r\nother existing State, for the thread of its continuity since the time\r\nbefore Abraham is unbroken. Grander than hewn stone or graven bronze, the\r\nmonuments of China are written books, and a living race, the heirs of all\r\nher ages, to be conversed with and interrogated. The burden of such vast\r\nhomogeneous antiquity may well oppress the mere man of politics: he needs\r\na certain alloy of Philistinism and a limitation of view to enable him to\r\nconcentrate his attention on the exigencies of the passing hour.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PRINCE KUNG.]\r\n\r\nRelations which might be called intimate had been established between\r\nthe two Manchu statesmen, Prince Kung and Wênsiang, and the foreign\r\nrepresentatives. When these high personages were forced to assume\r\nresponsibility for international relations, they were not only unversed\r\nin foreign affairs but untrained to any kind of business. The work of the\r\nsix Boards was carried on by expert secretaries, and the presidency of\r\none of them would have been no qualification for the new duty thrust upon\r\nthe emperor's Ministers of transacting business with foreign officials\r\nstanding on an equality with themselves. Their older colleague, Hangki,\r\nhad gained a little foreign knowledge by observation and hearsay while\r\nfilling the lucrative office of _hoppo_ at Canton; but the two younger men\r\nmistrusted him, perhaps with reason, possibly from the suspicion naturally\r\naroused by his possession of superior knowledge. Prince Kung and Wênsiang\r\nrecognised that they had everything to learn, and they were apt and eager\r\nscholars. Considering all the circumstances, it is indeed marvellous how\r\nthey adjusted themselves by innate tact to the novel position, and how\r\nquickly they assimilated new knowledge. Many illuminating discussions were\r\ncarried on between them and the foreign representatives, who on their part\r\nwere no less desirous of imparting than the Chinese were of acquiring\r\ninformation respecting the outer world. In these interesting symposia\r\nMr Wade naturally played the prominent part. On the enchanted ground of\r\nChinese history and literature, also, the interlocutors made endless\r\nexcursions together; and Chinese philosophy being directed to conduct\r\nrather than speculation, it was possible to deduce from the teaching of\r\nthe sages authority for the adoption of almost any useful measure. Between\r\nthe modern innovator, therefore, though in foreign garb, and the ancient\r\nmoralists there was no such intellectual disagreement as sympathetic\r\nexplanations could not resolve.\r\n\r\nIt might have been justifiable to conclude that the Chinese were being\r\ninfluenced for good by the well-meant counsels so copiously addressed to\r\nthem, were it not that the tutorial being so entirely incompatible with\r\nthe diplomatic function, no useful result could be expected from their\r\nstrained combination. It was as if one were to teach a novice the moves\r\nin a game which the two were at the same time playing for serious stakes.\r\n\r\nThese interminable interviews and voluminous memoranda were wholly\r\nunproductive, owing, no doubt, to the fact that the ideas of the parties\r\nran on parallel lines destined never to come to any point of fertile\r\ncontact. The burden of the cry of the Western people was \"progress,\" a\r\nword without equivalent in the language, and expressing an idea which\r\nhad no place in the conception of the Chinese. Incessant repetition\r\nwith varying illustrations were to the Chinese as flowers of rhetoric\r\nwasted on a deaf man, and that simply because the basis of the Chinese\r\npolitical thought lay at the opposite pole from that of the European.\r\nOn one occasion a distinguished American promoter was expatiating to the\r\ngovernor of Formosa on the advantages of railway communication, his most\r\ntelling example being his own experience in being rushed along after an\r\nearly breakfast from his house in Albany to New York, where he spent the\r\nday transacting important business and got wheeled back again to Albany\r\nfor dinner. The governor stopped him, and asked what in the name of\r\nsanity possessed him to lead such a wearing life, as the last thing he\r\n(the governor) would dream of doing would be to live a hundred miles from\r\nhis work. Though the earliest public advocate of railroads in China, the\r\ngovernor regarded their utility from a far different point of view.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: WÊNSIANG.\r\n   _From a photo by J. Thomson, Grosvenor Street, W._]\r\n\r\nSo eager were the foreigners for progress, which in their mind included\r\nthe regeneration of the Chinese empire and the development of its full\r\ncapacity for self-defence, that they were wont to rejoice over the\r\nslightest indications of a beginning being made. Thus the mission of a man\r\nof no standing as a secretary of the Tsungli-Yamên, who was sent to Europe\r\nin 1866 to take observations, was hailed as the beginning of the new era,\r\nand commended so warmly by the foreign Ministers to their Governments\r\nthat the emissary was received like the Queen of Sheba by King Solomon,\r\nand shown--at least in Great Britain--everything that was admirable from\r\nthe Western point of view. He was as far, however, from appreciating the\r\ntriumph of science as was Cetewayo, the Zulu, whose admiration of England\r\nfocussed itself on the elephant \"Jumbo\" at the Zoological Gardens, or the\r\nScotswoman who, after being shown over the British Museum, had carried\r\naway from it one impression, and that of the \"graund mat\" at the door.\r\nThe Chinese Government's appreciation of Western progress was by no means\r\nincreased by the mission of Pin, which rather indeed produced a contrary\r\neffect. China soon began to put forth fresh claims to go her own way, her\r\nown way being directly opposed to the kind of progress which was being\r\npressed upon her.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese in following the doctrines of the sages felt they were under\r\nthe guidance of Heaven, so that innovations appeared to them tainted with\r\nimpiety. So deeply did the worship of the past pervade their field of\r\nthought, that when high officials ventured to introduce something new,\r\nthey usually endeavoured to disarm opposition by gilding their proposals\r\nwith well-selected texts from the classics.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. FOREIGN LIFE IN PEKING.\r\n\r\n    Social influence of the Alcock family--Sir Rutherford's relations\r\n    with his staff--No social relations with natives--Manchu\r\n    courtesy to English ladies--Community of foreigners sociable yet\r\n    non-cohesive--Description of city--Foreign residency--Objects\r\n    of interest--The streets--Mules--Camels--Mongol market--Fur\r\n    sales--Absence of regulations--Street anecdotes--Summer\r\n    residences.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1865 the foreign life in Peking, official, social, and\r\nprivate, had already settled into the grooves prescribed by local\r\nconditions, within which it has, more or less, run ever since.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MANCHU (TARTAR) WOMEN.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the advent of Sir Rutherford and Lady Alcock, with their\r\ndaughter, now Lady Pelly, introduced an element into the social atmosphere\r\nof Peking which has afforded the happiest reminiscences to those who came\r\nunder its influence. We have seen that Sir Rutherford Alcock, by force of\r\ncharacter, conviction, and sense of duty, naturally assumed the lead among\r\nhis peers wherever he happened to be placed. A German resident in Peking\r\nat the time we are speaking of says, \"I remember very well that fine\r\nEnglish gentleman, who was conscious of representing the greatest country\r\nof the world, and did it well.\" The official personality of the British\r\nMinister could not be more truly depicted than in these simple words; but\r\nthis natural pre-eminence extended far beyond the official sphere, and\r\nmade itself felt for the general good in the common relations of life.\r\nHis dealings with subordinates were marked by thoroughgoing loyalty; his\r\nrule was to give his confidence without reserve to those who merited\r\nit, to support and defend them in the discharge of their duty. He was\r\naccessible, always ready to listen to the opinions even of his juniors,\r\nand though exacting as regards work, he never spared himself, but set an\r\nexample of industry to those who served under him. He possessed that rare\r\nfaculty of appreciation which enables a man to command services which no\r\nmoney could buy. The survivors of his staff to this day speak of him in\r\naffectionate terms as the best of chiefs. In business he was strictly,\r\nperhaps even rigidly, formal, and his manner was intolerant of laxity in\r\nothers. When the official crust was put off like a suit of armour, the\r\ngenial depths of his nature were reached, but the number of those who\r\nenjoyed this experience seems never to have been large. Select, but few,\r\nwere the friends of his bosom.\r\n\r\nThe foreign residents in Peking did not number many, and, with the\r\nexception of the Legations, were rather widely scattered over a city of\r\nvast distances. The original community consisted of about sixty persons,\r\ndistributed over the four Legations, the customs' staff, and missionary\r\nestablishments. It was a community of young men \"about twenty-four years\r\nof age,\" eminently social, no member being a stranger to the rest, and all\r\nliving in friendly intercourse. The Legations may almost be said to have\r\nsat with open doors, so easy were their interchanges of informal visits.\r\nDuring the time of Sir Rutherford and Lady Alcock their hospitalities\r\nrendered the British Legation the chief centre of social interest, while\r\nthe unaffected kindness which inspired these courtesies endeared its\r\ninmates to all their fellow-residents. That, indeed, was the golden age of\r\nthe British Legation, and, it may be added, of the general social life of\r\nthe Chinese capital, a period when life-long friendships were formed. The\r\ntime had not yet come for international rivalries to mar the cordiality\r\nof personal intercourse. Indeed in the convivialities of Peking national\r\ndistinctions were absolutely lost, and so to a great extent were the\r\ndistinctions of rank. On the racecourse, which was early instituted, as\r\nin the billiard-room, picnic excursions, and the like, all were free and\r\nall were equal.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MANCHU WOMEN.]\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of the \"social\" life of Peking, it must be understood as\r\nreferring exclusively to that of the foreign residents among themselves,\r\nfor between them and the natives there was no such intimacy. But in those\r\nearly days the high Chinese officials seemed to have been more genial than\r\nthose of a later epoch. In the winter of 1860-61, for example, Hangki,\r\nformerly _hoppo_ of Canton, was in the habit of receiving Mr Adkins\r\nfamiliarly at his private residence,--a practice which was afterwards\r\ngradually discontinued. The arrival of the two ladies at the British\r\nLegation was the signal for a display of courtesy by the Manchu Ministers,\r\nwho from time to time sent them seasonable presents of plants, flowers,\r\nand other things, thus establishing agreeable personal relations with the\r\nMinister. That the advent of ladies to the Legations should have evoked\r\nthe natural politeness of the high officials need not be a matter for\r\nwonder if it be remembered that the Chinese contempt for women is not\r\nshared by the Manchus. It is well known that their women are free from\r\nmost of the trammels which contract the lives of their Chinese sisters.\r\nTheir unbound feet symbolise liberty of locomotion generally, and they\r\nshow themselves unveiled and unabashed in public thoroughfares. They have\r\nthe coquetries common to the sex, among which may be reckoned a passion\r\nfor floral decoration of the head, and the universal practice of painting\r\nthe face and lips. This is done in a thoroughgoing manner, and as if the\r\npaint were \"laid on with a trowel,\" leaving a sharply defined margin on\r\ncheek and neck between the pink and white and the sallow ground on which\r\nthe colour is overlaid, giving it the appearance of a mask which might\r\nbe easily removed. Even young children are subjected to the cosmetic\r\ntreatment; and the very aged do not discard the artificial flowers in the\r\nremnant of their hair. As the fairest Chinese have no such natural colour\r\nas is thus imitated, it is rather difficult to divine whence they derived\r\nthe notion of an ideal human skin.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at that the first European girls who appeared in\r\nPeking should have excited some curiosity. One young lady, probably the\r\nfirst arrival, whose fresh and fair complexion suggested the acme of the\r\ncosmetic art, excited intense interest among the Mongol and Manchu ladies.\r\nOn one occasion she was met in the street by a great princess, who was\r\nso struck by her appearance that she stopped her _cortège_, alighted from\r\nher cart, and stood before the English girl and gently rubbed her cheeks\r\nto find out, as she naively said, how the colour was put on!\r\n\r\nThe foreign residents at Peking, happy as their circumstances were,\r\nlacked some of the principal elements of a community properly so called.\r\nThey had, in fact, little in common besides their æsthetic culture and\r\ntheir Christian civilisation, the literature, philosophy, and the social\r\ntenets of the West. They had no head, no centre, no neutral meeting-ground\r\neven except the racecourse and the open fields, and were thus always\r\neither hosts or guests to each other. The assumed identity of their high\r\npolitical interests gave an appearance of solidarity to the diplomatic\r\nsection; but the fusion of the other elements in the society was far\r\nfrom complete, and, in short, outside of the region of recreation and\r\nconviviality the residents could not be said to be animated by any\r\nunifying purpose, nor to have any communal existence. Individual isolation\r\nprevented the aggregate from attaining collective force.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CHINESE WOMEN.]\r\n\r\nThese sterilising conditions were aggravated by another feature of\r\nthe situation which had an important bearing on social life. Peking\r\nwas one of the most inaccessible capitals in the world. The great\r\ntourist-stream passed it by. It stirred no human emotion unless it\r\nwere languid aversion or inarticulate curiosity. The dilettante element\r\nwhich has ventilated Japan so well and kept her in constant touch with\r\ncosmopolitan life-currents has been absent in Northern China. Peking with\r\nits particular concerns has been thus permitted to lie secluded from the\r\nworld, neither generating fruitful ideas nor inviting or profiting by\r\ntheir importation from without; nor, in short, making itself intelligible\r\nor interesting to mankind other than as an archaic curiosity. China, with\r\nits immense wealth and resources, weighed less in the consideration of the\r\nnations than the petty kingdom of Greece or the deadly swamps of Africa.\r\nConsiderations of that kind help to explain the bewilderment with which\r\nthe action of these neglected forces has been received during the past few\r\nyears, and the disarray of the organs of European opinion when suddenly\r\ncalled on to deal with the phenomenon of Peking as a daily \"headline.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the city itself it may be noted that it is magnificently laid out\r\nwithin high and massive walls, the gates and corners surmounted by\r\nbastions and imposing towers pierced with three tiers of gun-ports. The\r\nmain streets are straight and extravagantly wide. Spaciousness is the\r\ndominant expression of the whole--the back-yard is a feature of the\r\nmeanest one-storeyed hovels. It has not occurred to the Pekingese to\r\neconomise earth-space by vertical architecture ground-ward or sky-ward.\r\nViewed from an elevation, the city has the appearance of a vast park:\r\nthe tree-foliage seen in perspective seems to cover the whole area, only\r\npicked out by yellow and green roofs of imperial and other conspicuous\r\nbuildings. The palace, a city in itself of 10,000 inhabitants, occupies\r\nan immense _enclave_ symmetrically placed in the centre of the whole.\r\n\r\nFrom such a coign of vantage as the high wall affords, Peking presents\r\nat once an impressive and a pleasing spectacle. It gives the distance\r\nnecessary to lend enchantment to the view. The soothing hum of a great\r\npopulation; the sweetness of an atmosphere untainted, if it be summer,\r\nor spiced by the aromatic herbs which grow promiscuously between the\r\ninterstices of the bricks, if it be autumn,--enfolds the scene in that\r\nkind of soft drapery which memory throws over common things long past. One\r\nlingers, loth to renew a closer acquaintance with the crowd below, which\r\nno longer hums but utters wild discordant cries,--with the horrors of the\r\nstreets, which are of the earth, earthy. The area contained between the\r\nrectilinear arteries of the city is dismally laid out on the plan of the\r\nrabbit-warren. These wide streets are alternately deep mire and deep dust\r\nat the best, but at the worst, receptacles of indescribable abominations.\r\nThe witty and wise Bishop Favier, when describing these to a friend in\r\nFrance, was asked, How could a population living in such insanitary\r\nconditions resist a visitation of cholera. \"Cholera!\" exclaimed the\r\nFather; \"it could never enter. It would be asphyxiated at the gate!\"[12]\r\n\r\nThe dust is acrid to nose and eyes, from the dessicated refuse of\r\ngenerations, for the streets are watered by long scoops from standing\r\npools of sewage which overflow in the summer rains and obliterate the\r\nroadway, so that animals harnessed between shafts not unfrequently meet\r\nwith a cruel death by drowning in these fœtid thoroughfares.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CHINESE STREET SCENE DURING RAINY SEASON.]\r\n\r\nSuch hints as these will be sufficient to suggest to the least imaginative\r\nthat peculiar unattractiveness of the Peking streets which has been\r\na determining factor in the habits of the foreign residents. Life\r\nwould be intolerable to Western folks if it were not removed from the\r\nsights, noises, and odours of the streets; and fortunately the ruling\r\nlocal principle of spaciousness lends itself to the solution without\r\nrunning counter to any native practice or prejudice. The Legations, the\r\ncustoms, and the missionaries are in their various degrees established\r\nin \"compounds\" large enough to accommodate the members of their staffs\r\nin separate buildings with ample elbow-room, as in an Indian cantonment,\r\ninterspaced with trees and sometimes gardens, the whole surrounded by a\r\nhigh wall and capable of defence. These seductive oases in a wilderness of\r\ngarbage, in a city of great distances, naturally conduce to stay-at-home\r\nhabits and to segregation, which it requires some energy to overcome.\r\n\r\nNor is Peking life wanting in more mundane compensations. The city itself\r\ncontains many \"objects of interest,\" which in the earlier years of foreign\r\nintercourse were open to the curious. The well-known \"Lama temple,\"\r\nreputed to contain 2000 inmates, which has for many years been dangerous\r\nto enter, was in those days a much-frequented resort, where the stranger\r\nwas welcome to go over the establishment and listen to the Buddhist\r\nlitanies: a certain bass voice, or perhaps a succession of bass voices, in\r\nthe choir, indeed, attained celebrity among foreigners. In the refectory\r\nof that monastery one was obliged, out of respect, to eat, or feign to\r\neat, the unmitigated fat of the sheep's tail, fished from out the broth,\r\nnot with a hook, as was the custom in the Jewish Church, but by the deft\r\nfingers of the chief lama. Now, on the contrary, the foreigner who enters\r\nthe gate is hustled, robbed, and stoned. This great change in the attitude\r\nof the lamas has never been satisfactorily explained, but it is presumed\r\nthat the manners and customs of some of the visitors to the temple may\r\nhave had something to do with it. There have been visitors who, with the\r\nkeen acquisitiveness of the world-tourist, have slipped small \"josses\"\r\ninto their pockets out of what, perhaps, appeared to them the superfluous\r\nnumber of molten images ranged round the shelves of the great Buddha's\r\nsanctuary.\r\n\r\nThe Temple of Heaven, too, that grand altar to the Living God, standing\r\nin an immense park enclosed by a lofty wall, was then, and for many\r\nyears remained, open to all comers. This was perhaps due less to any\r\nintentional liberality of the authorities than to the negligence of the\r\ngatekeepers and the Board of Works. For a long time access was gained\r\nover a broken part of the outer wall left unrepaired. At one period\r\nEnglish residents played cricket within the vast enclosure; at another\r\nBillingsgate and brickbats were the ordinary salutations which greeted\r\nthe would-be visitor--the change being probably due to the slow awakening\r\nof the officials. So with many other places within and without the city,\r\nfor in some cases where direct request was made for extension of the\r\naccommodation, the effect of drawing official attention to the subject\r\nwas to restrict the privileges which had actually been enjoyed.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the occasional rudeness of which Dr Rennie has given us so\r\nfaithful a picture, the most unartistic of men could hardly fail to take\r\npleasure in the daily traffic of the streets, provided only his nerves,\r\nvisual and olfactory, were not too delicate. The true lord of the roads\r\nis apt from his commonplaceness to be overlooked by those who owe him\r\nmost--that universal conveyancer, the sagacious, tireless mule. He does\r\nnot belong to the \"five great families\"--the fox, weasel, hedgehog, snake,\r\nand rat--which the Chinese hold in mystic awe because they have learned\r\nthe secret of immortality; but if utility to man were a criterion of\r\nmerit, they would surely fall down and worship this indispensable hybrid.\r\nHot or cold, wet or dry, the mule never fails to respond to the severest\r\ncall upon his strength and courage.\r\n\r\nWith the approach of winter an antediluvian rival is introduced upon\r\nthe scene, in the shape of the well-known two-humped camel, which is\r\nthen shaggy, dignified, and in really grand form. Intolerant of heat,\r\nbut impervious to cold, the camels, after passing the summer on the\r\ngrass-lands of the Mongolian plateau, are brought down in droves to\r\nthe great fair held on a large open space outside the Northern Wall.\r\nThe coming of the camels with their bronzed and heavily booted riders\r\nis like a whiff of the free air of the desert. The Pekingese use this\r\npatient but surly beast of burden chiefly for carrying coal from the\r\nmines in the Western Hills to the city; but immense numbers are employed\r\nin transporting tea from the navigable limit of the Peiho to Siberia and\r\nRussia, not entering Peking city at all.\r\n\r\nA roomy encampment between the British and Russian Legations is allotted\r\nto the Mongols, and serves as a market-place where the products of the\r\ndesert are exchanged for the utensils and gewgaws of civilisation. The\r\nstaple of the Mongol trade is frozen meat--mutton, venison, furred and\r\nfeathered game; and without refrigerator or other appliance the carcasses\r\nremain fresh in their skins till the end of the three winter months.\r\nThese simple-minded herdsmen, chaffering with shrewd Chinese hucksters,\r\nor sitting, where they seem to have been born, between the high humps of\r\ntheir slow-moving beasts, form picturesque groups in the imperial city,\r\nthe more interesting that their appearance is pathetically suggestive\r\nof an order which is passing away. The Grand Khan, dispensing favours to\r\nhis loyal tributaries, has come ominously near to being a mere tradition.\r\nThese very sheepskin-coated camel-drivers are the only buffer remaining\r\nbetween the receding empire and the advancing tide of foreign encroachment\r\nfrom the north.\r\n\r\nOther evidences of that imperial grandeur which lent some justification to\r\nthe title \"Middle Kingdom\" were still occasionally to be met with. Though\r\nSiam, and even Burma, had fallen indefinitely into arrears, dust-begrimed\r\nembassies from Korea or Nepaul, with their trains of pack-mules bearing\r\ntribute and merchandise (duty free for the benefit of the officials),\r\nmight still be seen defiling through the massive gates of the city,\r\npreserving to our day a living picture of the Asiatic mission of the\r\nantique type. For what were they but interesting survivals, shadows of\r\ndeparted greatness?\r\n\r\nPeking is not a commercial city, but essentially an imperial camp. Trade\r\nproper is confined to an outer or Chinese city, which is but a walled-in\r\nsuburb sparsely built over. Through traffic, for obvious fiscal reasons,\r\nshuns the capital; but there is sufficient local commerce, of which\r\ngold and silver smelting forms a not unimportant part, to support many\r\nbankers and merchants who are domiciled in the outer city. It has been\r\nremarked that Chinese trade may be seen at its best in the settlement of\r\nMaimaichên, which faces Kiachta on the Russo-Chinese frontier, or in the\r\nStraits Settlements or Rangoon, where nothing hinders the merchants from\r\naccumulating and displaying their wealth. Even Peking, however, affords\r\nsome glimpses of the far-reaching enterprise of the Chinese traders.\r\n\r\nWhat a suggestive display, for instance, is the fur-market, also of\r\nnecessity a \"winter exhibition\"! Acres and acres of ground are covered\r\nwith skins of every conceivable species of quadruped, spread out from dawn\r\ntill near noon. Here are daily laid out for sale under the blue sky (and\r\nwhat a light to make purchases in!) the commonest and the most precious\r\nfurs from Manchuria, the Amur, and even Kamtschatka, the total value of\r\nwhich must be enormous. Let us learn from the history of the Hudson's\r\nBay Company what organisation of energy, what confidence, what variety of\r\nenterprise and skill, are required to bring these costly commodities from\r\nsuch vast distances to this great sale-room, and we shall not make light\r\nof the vitality of the Chinese.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe amenities of the street traffic, though not of special importance,\r\ncall for mention as illustrating certain phases of foreign contact\r\nwith the Chinese. If we may take Japan for comparison, in nothing is\r\nthe contrast between the two systems more apparent than in municipal\r\nadministration. The antithesis may be expressed in one word,--in Japan,\r\nexcessive regulation; in China, absence of regulation. Whether there be\r\nany rule of the road in China is of little interest, seeing that, like\r\nother rules, it might be disregarded and there would be no one to enforce\r\nit. The traffic adjusts itself with little friction. China employs no\r\npolice,--things arrange themselves by their own interaction, as the\r\npebbles do on the sea-shore; and for most of the purposes of life the\r\npeople are their own law-makers and their own executive. The Chinese\r\nsystem of government is to govern as little as possible--to let the\r\ncountry rule itself. So when a strange element demanded accommodation\r\nin the busy streets and congested gateways of Peking, without rules\r\nor supervision, it had to find its level among the rest by friction\r\nand concussion. It would have been an interesting process to watch in\r\nits initial stages. Amid a good deal of clamour and language of a racy\r\ndescription applied to man and beast and their respective ancestors, there\r\nis rarely a serious road quarrel among the Chinese. One excellent custom\r\nof polite society tends to restrict the area of disputes on the highway,\r\nleaving collisions to be fought out by grooms, carters, chair-bearers, or\r\nboatmen, as the case may be, while the masters maintain an imperturbable\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\nMr Colborne Baber, who had a way of his own of solving the minor problems\r\nof Chinese intercourse, was once in a cart, sitting well back and\r\nunobserved, in a narrow street that admitted neither of turning nor of\r\npassing another vehicle, when a cart was met about half way. The drivers\r\nbegan to vociferate, each calling on the other to give way. The opposition\r\ncarter claimed the precedence on the ground that his vehicle carried\r\nwomen, and it looked as if he would gain his point when Baber himself,\r\nbecoming impatient, thrust out his head and called out that in his cart\r\nthere was a foreign devil, and without further discussion the rival jehu\r\nbacked out.\r\n\r\nThose who ride do not recognise each other on the road, even though they\r\nbe friends; for if they did so, etiquette would require both to stop and\r\ndismount and go through formal salutations on foot. Foreigners, ignoring\r\nthis rule, and their servants not unwilling to profit by the prestige\r\nof their masters in accosting bystanders from the saddle, are sometimes\r\ngrievously misdirected when not lectured on their bad manners. The\r\nnatives on their part are seldom averse from presuming on the foreigner's\r\nignorance of what is due to him. Between the one and the other, or as a\r\nresult of the mere chapter of accidents, collisions were inevitable in\r\nthe streets. How were they to be dealt with in the absence of constituted\r\nauthority? If aggression towards a foreigner on the part of a great man's\r\nservants were submitted to, there would be no end to it, they being 500 to\r\n1. On the other hand, insolence promptly resented and vigorously punished\r\nnever failed to elicit the approval not only of the spectators, but even\r\nof the great man himself, who perhaps had secret grievances of his own\r\nagainst his lackeys, which he was not sorry to see partially paid off\r\nby proxy. In all cases the sympathy of the Chinese goes with the side\r\nthat successfully asserts itself. Of this hundreds of examples could be\r\ngiven--perhaps not one on the converse side.\r\n\r\nA writer in the 'Whitehall Review' some years ago, among interesting\r\nreminiscences of the 'Sixties, relates some incidents to show the\r\nprimitive means by which equilibrium was established between natives and\r\nforeigners in the Peking streets. _Place aux dames._ The experience of the\r\nfirst foreign female who had been seen is thus amusingly told. Mr Bruce's\r\nhousekeeper, an old family retainer who had followed the fortunes of her\r\nmaster all over the world,\r\n\r\n    saw no particular reasons for not acting in Peking as she had\r\n    done in Cairo or Constantinople, and the first morning after her\r\n    arrival sallied forth, basket on arm, to do her marketing for the\r\n    day. When I add that she knew not a word of Chinese, that none of\r\n    the natives spoke English, that she was about five feet high and\r\n    ten feet round the crinoline, and was the first female European\r\n    ever seen by the Pekingese, her enterprise will be judged to have\r\n    been braver than she knew. However, nothing daunted, she entered\r\n    a butcher's shop, closely pressed upon by an inquisitive and\r\n    delighted crowd. Before she could even look at a joint or chop\r\n    she was hemmed in, and one waggish native, bolder than the rest,\r\n    gave her a substantial dig in the crinoline, shouting in Chinese,\r\n    \"Let's see if she's solid.\" But the laugh was not for long on his\r\n    side. Seizing a chopper from the block, Mrs A. made a mighty blow\r\n    at his head, which he happily evaded. In less than a second the\r\n    shop was clear, the terrified natives tumbling over each other\r\n    in their haste to get away. A European who came upon the scene\r\n    at the moment beheld the startling sight of some 500 Chinese\r\n    rushing up the principal street pursued by an infuriated old woman\r\n    armed with a chopper. With some difficulty she was persuaded to\r\n    abandon the chase and resume her basket, which she had dropped\r\n    in her excitement. But it is on record that for a good two years\r\n    thereafter Mrs A. was allowed to shop in peace, and became a\r\n    \"Black Douglas\" to troublesome Chinese children in the vicinity\r\n    of the Legation.\r\n\r\nIn later years she talked in what she called \"broken China.\"\r\n\r\nAnother \"adjustment to environment\" is thus described:--\r\n\r\n    A curious little industry sprang up in the environs of the city,\r\n    consequent on the horsey proclivities of the Europeans. This was\r\n    getting run over, which was generally accomplished by rushing in\r\n    front of the horses and throwing the hands up. One of two things\r\n    always happened. Either the horse shied and the rider came off, to\r\n    the huge delight of the Chinese mob, or the gesticulating party\r\n    was knocked down. In this latter event, cautioned as we all were\r\n    to give no offence, if possible, to the natives, a dollar was\r\n    generally handed as salve to the artful victim, whose screams and\r\n    yells that he had been killed never failed to draw a large and\r\n    sympathising crowd of friends, who regarded the \"foreign devil\"\r\n    with most unfriendly looks. In one village at last it became\r\n    intolerable, and we decided if any further attempt was made we\r\n    would run down the culprits intentionally. As usual, on our next\r\n    visit three or four young _gamins_ essayed the usual dodge. Being\r\n    fully prepared for it, nobody was unseated, and we turned our\r\n    horses back at full gallop, three or four Chinese being hurled\r\n    into the hedge by our horses. We did not stop to offer dollars,\r\n    but were never afterwards stopped.\r\n\r\nFollowing the same train of reflection, he gives examples of the drastic\r\nmanner in which the Russians asserted their prerogatives on the road,\r\nwhich we do not quote, as they were probably exceptional cases.\r\n\r\nThe never-failing courtesy of the Manchus rises superior to such\r\nunpleasant encounters. An example of this was related to the writer by a\r\nmember of the British Legation. In riding through a narrow place, narrowed\r\nprobably by the cesspool occupying more than its fair share of the street,\r\nhe met the _cortège_ of a grandee at a spot where it seemed impossible\r\nto pass, and it looked as if the solitary horseman must turn back. As\r\nhe thought of doing so he observed the occupant of the sedan call a halt\r\nand direct his bearers to make room for the stranger. Observing closely\r\nthe features of him who showed so much consideration for a foreigner, the\r\nEnglishman was pleased, some time afterwards, to recognise in him Prince\r\nCh'ing, who succeeded Prince Kung as President of the Tsungli-Yamên in\r\n1884.\r\n\r\nThe lives of the foreign residents were by no means confined within the\r\nfour walls of the city. The environs without fences or trespass notices\r\nmake charming excursion-grounds for riding-parties. For longer expeditions\r\nthere are the never-failing attractions of the Ming Tombs, the Great\r\nWall, the passes into Mongolia, and various other distant points. The\r\ncity is beautifully situated in the centre of a mountain crescent, whose\r\nnearest point is thirteen miles distant. The first object of quest when\r\nthe Legations had been established was a sanatorium or summer retreat--for\r\nthe thermometer reaches 100 Fahr. in June--and the Western Hills were\r\nexplored. Some of the most beautiful spots there are occupied by Buddhist\r\ntemples or monasteries, whose builders have shown as nice a taste in\r\nthe selection of their sites as their brethren the monks of the West\r\nhave always done. These religious houses, laid out with a view to the\r\naccommodation of pilgrims and strangers, are regularly used by Chinese\r\ngrandees as health-resorts or shelters from political storms. The Russian\r\nmission, while it was alone in Peking, had set the example twenty years\r\nbefore of resorting to the hill temples in the dog-days. Arrangements\r\nwith the priests for the occupation of certain portions of one of the\r\ntemples were soon made by Mr Parkes, who was on a visit to the capital,\r\nand ever since 1861 official Peking, with one notable exception, has on\r\nthe approach of summer migrated bodily from the oppressive atmosphere of\r\nthe great city to the exhilarating air of the Western Hills. The social\r\nlife of the city was reproduced at the temples, but in a less conventional\r\nform, every one residing there being considered on a holiday. The country\r\nround offered many temptations to excursions, and amateurs of geology,\r\nbotany, and natural history were never at a loss for something to interest\r\nthem in their rambles among the hills. Residence so far from town brought\r\nthe foreigners into friendly contact also with their rustic neighbours,\r\nwhose innate good qualities, moderation, contentment, and kindliness were\r\ndisplayed in a very favourable light.\r\n\r\nBut the sojourn at the hills also brought the foreigner into occasional\r\ncontact with Chinese of high rank, who welcomed such opportunities of\r\nshowing civility to the strangers. At other times disagreeable collisions\r\nwith the retainers of a great personage were experienced. So popular were\r\nthe temples of the Western Hills as a summer resort that they were always\r\nfull, and consequently disputes about accommodation were liable to occur,\r\nespecially when some grasping priest would let the same premises to two\r\ndifferent occupants, leaving them, or rather their servants, to fight for\r\nthe possession.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE FOREIGN CUSTOMS UNDER THE PEKING CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n    Centralised in Peking--Encouraged by British Ministers--Assumed\r\n    imperial form after the treaties of 1858--Extension to all the\r\n    ports--Original international basis becomes purely Chinese--Shows\r\n    capacity for larger functions than collection of duties--Becomes\r\n    a diplomatic auxiliary--British Government leans upon it--The\r\n    Chinese faithfully served by it--Interpreter of the intentions\r\n    of the foreign Governments--Inspector-General gains influence\r\n    over British Minister--Pleases Board of Trade--And maintains\r\n    confidential relations with British Government--While remaining\r\n    faithful to China--Services rendered by the Customs to all\r\n    commercial nations.\r\n\r\nIt was a source of unmixed satisfaction to Sir Rutherford Alcock, on\r\nassuming office in Peking, to find the maritime customs, the bantling of\r\nShanghai, firmly established in the capital and gathering strength and\r\ninfluence. As its functions pertained exclusively to trade, Sir Frederick\r\nBruce had been originally of opinion that the inspector-general should be\r\nlocated in the commercial centre, Shanghai, and he took exception to the\r\ninstitution being domiciled in Peking, where trade was expressly excluded\r\nby treaty. Sir Frederick, however, soon saw reason to modify his views.\r\nWhen it began to appear to him that the customs might prove a convenient\r\nauxiliary to the diplomacy of the treaty Powers, he cultivated the\r\ninstitution and encouraged it to occult activity in the political sphere.\r\nSir Frederick Bruce's interests in the fortunes of the customs, however,\r\ncould never be so ardent as that of its parent, Sir Rutherford Alcock,\r\nand its monthly nurse, Mr Wade. The presence of these two in the British\r\nLegation afforded a fresh guarantee of the prosperity of the customs,\r\nwhich they were both well satisfied to see in the competent hands of Mr\r\nHart. For as the institution was a creation without precedent, the form\r\nof its development must be largely influenced by the personal qualities\r\nof its head. Whatever character it might have assumed under its original\r\ninspector-general, Lay, it could hardly have been the same service that\r\nhas grown and spread under the directing hand of Sir Robert Hart. It\r\nis impossible to dissociate the Chinese customs as it stands from the\r\nvigorous self-sustained intellect that has moulded and still controls it,\r\nfor it is assuredly not such a going concern as can be made over to any\r\nnew head without the risk of changes more or less organic.\r\n\r\nThe story of the first decade of the maritime customs was told clearly,\r\nbriefly, and modestly in a monograph which Mr Hart prepared for Mr Bruce\r\nin 1864, published as a Blue Book of thirteen pages (No. 1, 1865). Up\r\nto the date of the Tientsin treaty of 1858 the operations of the foreign\r\ncollectorate were confined to the single port of Shanghai, the inspectors\r\nholding the appointment from the governor-general at Nanking, who was\r\nImperial Commissioner for Foreign Trade. The new treaty gave the foreign\r\nPowers an interest in the Chinese customs which they did not possess\r\nbefore, because the war indemnities were to be paid by instalments out\r\nof the collections of duty, so that during the time when these payments\r\nwere being made the maintenance of the machinery for collecting the duties\r\nwas a matter of international concern. The new treaty also provided for a\r\nuniform system of duty collection for all the trading-ports; and then the\r\ninstitution assumed an imperial and dropped its provincial character, the\r\ninspector-general receiving his commission from the Central Government.\r\n\r\nConsidering that the mission of the foreign customs was to subvert\r\ntime-honoured native systems, it was received with surprising graciousness\r\nat most of the trading centres. The first port to which the new system was\r\nextended was Canton, the leader in welcoming its advent there being the\r\n_hoppo_, the one functionary in the empire whose privileges seemed to be\r\nmost directly threatened by the new-comer. By one of those anomalies which\r\nare so common and yet so inexplicable in Chinese affairs, arrangements for\r\nopening the office in Canton were carried on without interruption during\r\nthe hostilities of 1859. Patience, tact, and resolution were nevertheless\r\nrequired to overcome the innumerable difficulties of detail incidental to\r\nsubstituting rigorous inspection and remorseless collection for the chaos\r\nof unaccountability which had previously reigned unchallenged. A very few\r\nyears, however, served to reduce all obstruction, and to bring trader and\r\nofficial, foreigner and Chinese, into working harmony.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in history a true account was rendered to the Imperial\r\nGovernment, accompanied by a substantial revenue on which it could depend.\r\nNaturally the agency, though foreign, which yielded such tangible fruit,\r\ncommended itself to the statesmen of the capital, who frankly recognised,\r\nas did the provincial authorities themselves, that the result obtained\r\nwas wholly beyond the competence of any native organisation. Though,\r\ntherefore, the customs service was essentially of a provisional, stop-gap\r\ncharacter, it had on that very account a surer guarantee of permanence\r\nthan could have been derived from any paper covenant by which the Chinese\r\nGovernment could have been bound, for that would have provoked disputation\r\nand evasion. The spasmodic attempt to formalise the service on a basis\r\nof international obligation which was made in 1898 was perhaps the first\r\nthing that really imperilled its constitution. In its origin, indeed,\r\nthe foreign customs had been international, the three treaty Powers being\r\neach represented on the inspectorate; but with the expansion in 1858 this\r\ncharacter was abandoned, and the customs became a purely Chinese concern\r\noperated by foreign employees, the staff being selected from among all\r\nnations indiscriminately, according to personal merit.\r\n\r\nAlmost from the time of the transference of the inspectorate to the\r\ncapital the customs showed capacities of wider range than are comprised\r\nwithin the routine of a custom-house. Profoundly impressed as were the\r\nimperial statesmen with the value of the new revenue-producer, they soon\r\nbegan to perceive that the institution might be put to other and greater\r\nuses. Plurality of function in itself was no stumbling-block to them,\r\nfor it is the system on which Chinese administration is carried on. In\r\nthe very first year they had intrusted the inspector-general and his\r\ndeputy with the organisation of a navy, with the evident approval of the\r\nBritish Minister. That functionary, indeed, seemed as little disposed as\r\nthe Chinese themselves to see incongruity in the various forms of customs\r\nactivity, especially when he regarded its extra official services as\r\nrendered to himself; and he really stood much in need of services of that\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's first representative in Peking, helpless and despairing,\r\nwas, in fact, fain to throw himself on the support of the first\r\ninspector-general, Mr Lay, and then of his successor, Mr Hart, as\r\nhaving knowledge and influence with the Chinese Government which was\r\nnot possessed by the British Legation. It did not apparently occur to Mr\r\nBruce that such knowledge was strictly limited, and that the influence\r\ncould be of very little use to him, and might be too dearly purchased.\r\nHaving no other resource, however, he was perhaps not unwilling to\r\nshut his eyes to the false position in which he was placing himself in\r\nleaning upon the paid servants of the Chinese Government to assist him in\r\ncarrying out a policy which was totally repugnant to that Government. The\r\nfidelity of both Mr Lay and Mr Hart to the master whom they served being\r\nbeyond question, the diplomatic prestige conferred on them by the British\r\nMinister, as well as the knowledge and influence derived from the other\r\nside, must, in all matters of controversy, be thrown into the Chinese\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nAs this interesting truth dawned upon the minds of the Tsungli-Yamên, they\r\nsaw in their English employee a providential instrument for drawing the\r\nsting from the threatening language which was sometimes applied to them\r\nby the foreign representatives. Of these, the only one who had as yet any\r\nserious matter to discuss with the Chinese was the representative of Great\r\nBritain. It was assumed on the British side that nothing proposed by that\r\nPower was contrary to the interests of China: so far, indeed, did this\r\ntheory inspire their action, that the welfare of the Chinese seemed at\r\ntimes to overshadow that of their own empire in the minds of the British\r\nrepresentatives. No doubt there was an ideal point of view from which\r\nthe interests of China and her Western neighbours might seem ultimately\r\nto blend, but Chinese statesmen were in nowise able to take in such a\r\nlarge perspective. They continued to regard the foreign invasion, with\r\nall its pretences of goodwill, as an unmitigated calamity to be opposed\r\nwherever possible. No man can pronounce a certain judgment as to whether,\r\nwith their imperfect knowledge, they were more right or more wrong in\r\nfollowing their obstructive instincts. Reforms, progress, and the opening\r\nup of the country to foreigners, were being persistently pressed upon\r\nthem; they fully expected these concessions to be demanded of them when\r\nthe time came--and it was already drawing near--when the treaties should\r\nbe revised. Admitting, moreover, that some one, or more, of the Powers\r\nmight have been considerate enough to forego, or indefinitely postpone,\r\nadvantages for themselves rather than imperil the wellbeing of the Chinese\r\nState, there were already six instead of the original three treaty Powers\r\nto be reckoned with; nor was there any limit to the further increase of\r\ntheir numbers. Supposing, then, that, relying on the benignant intentions\r\nof the English, they should, in the revision of their treaty, admit such\r\ninnovations as inland steam navigation, inland residence, railways,\r\nand so forth, would not these successes stimulate the other Powers,\r\nwhen their turn for revision came,--France in 1870, Germany in 1871,\r\nand others later,--to advance still farther the outposts of the foreign\r\ninvasion, each, in a spirit of generous emulation, striving to surpass the\r\nachievements of his predecessor; and all with the complacent consciousness\r\nthat they were doing good to China? These endless contingencies were more\r\nthan Chinese statesmen could cope with, and the apprehension of them had\r\nno other effect than to consolidate their resistance in small as well\r\nas in great things. They were learning to mistrust the efficacy of their\r\nancient imperial policy of dividing and ruling, and with good reason had\r\nlost confidence in their capacity to distinguish in embryo between what\r\nwas trivial and what was laden with deep consequences.\r\n\r\nResistance, therefore, tempered by the fear of force, seemed their only\r\nrefuge. Some of the dangers ahead, of which they had glimpses, might have\r\nbeen obviated by a bolder policy; but being unable to formulate such\r\na policy for themselves, and unwilling to accept it cut and dried from\r\nothers, there was nothing left them but indiscriminate resistance. Under\r\nsuch conditions no harmony was possible between the Chinese and Western\r\nGovernments; and not knowing how far they might with safety evade the\r\npressure put upon them, the Chinese had recourse to the Inspector-General\r\nof Customs, as Louis XI. had recourse to his astrologer whenever he felt\r\nhimself in a difficult crisis.\r\n\r\nThe Tsungli-Yamên, accustomed to act on hand-to-mouth views of policy,\r\nwould do anything to relieve the pressure of the moment, but nothing to\r\nprevent a recurrence of it. Indisposed to follow up the sequences of cause\r\nand effect, they would in emergencies become impatient of ratiocination\r\nand attempt to reach the foregone conclusion by a shorter cut. Common\r\ngossip in China thus fairly summarised their attitude in certain crises\r\nof this kind. If discussion with the British Legation ran high, the Yamên\r\nwould send for the inspector-general and ask simply, \"Does this mean\r\nwar?\" The answer being \"No,\" the question ceased to trouble the Yamên,\r\nand the foreign Minister would be allowed to rage at his pleasure. Their\r\nExcellencies would even help him out with the opprobrious terms he was\r\nsearching for, and then listen placidly to the remainder of the tirade.\r\nGreat Britain having not only the preponderating interest, but being still\r\nthe leading Power in the Far East, it was obviously a great advantage for\r\nthe Chinese that it should be that Power which came particularly under\r\nthe influence of the inspector-general. To tie the hands of the British\r\nGovernment for a whole generation was, indeed, an achievement worthy of a\r\nmaster of policy; but it was by no means the only service which might be\r\nrendered to China even by an Inspector-General of Customs.\r\n\r\nThe same agency was destined in later days to unravel many tangled skeins\r\nin China's international relations. It brought Gordon to her rescue in\r\n1880; by sheer innate ability in the use of the most unpromising means, it\r\nbrought about peace with France in 1885; and, though with less success, it\r\nprocured the attempted intervention of Great Britain with Japan in 1894.\r\n\r\nHow far these great potentialities were foreseen in the earlier years\r\nof the Customs service is doubtful. Even in their parental complacency\r\nSir Rutherford Alcock and Mr Wade may well have failed to realise, as an\r\nuninterested outsider might have done, the nature of the power that was\r\nbeing nursed in their infant Hercules. Certain it is that they reckoned\r\nit as a factor on their own side. It is clear that Sir Rutherford Alcock,\r\nso far from regarding the inspector-general as an opponent, commended him\r\nto the Foreign Office as a valuable auxiliary. Mr Wade clung to the same\r\nbelief for a good many years longer.\r\n\r\nThe first to perceive the tendency of the new relationship which events\r\nwere bringing about was, no doubt, the inspector-general himself.\r\nChina, he saw, could be best served by a virtual control of the British\r\nLegation. The nascent power was, however, too precious to be trusted to\r\npersonal accidents, and the inspector-general wisely availed himself\r\nof circumstances as they arose to widen his basis of influence by\r\nestablishing such relations with the Home Government as might save\r\nhim from being wholly dependent on the life or the caprice of the\r\nrepresentative for the time being at Peking. Such to an ordinary man\r\nmight have appeared a hopeless ambition, considering the circumstance\r\nof distance and other adverse conditions. Yet by gradual steps this too\r\nwas accomplished. A well-directed stroke or a happy accident established\r\nthe inspector-general in high favour with the Board of Trade when under\r\nthe presidency of Mr John Bright. He had summed up the results of the\r\ntreaty revision[13] negotiations in 1868 in a congratulatory letter to\r\nthe British Minister which has been many times published. As a masterly\r\nexposition of the State of China in its relation to foreign Powers it was\r\nwarmly indorsed by Sir Rutherford Alcock, and is well worth perusal even\r\nat this day. The Board of Trade was much impressed by a presentment of\r\nthe Chinese case so much in sympathy with the views often expressed by Mr\r\nCobden and Mr Bright, and which are traditional in the Board of Trade.\r\nTheir policy was noninterference in the affairs of China, based largely\r\non their disparagement of the value of British interests in that country.\r\nIn commenting on this closely reasoned State Paper, the Board of Trade\r\nspecially selected for illustration of its merit the following passage:\r\n\"Of course, force will wrest anything from China: but wherever there is\r\naction there is reaction; and as sure as natural laws continue to act,\r\nso sure it is that appeals to force in one age will give to the men of\r\na later day a heritage of vengeance,--the Europeans of some future day\r\nmay wish that their forefathers had not sown the seeds of hatred in the\r\nbayonet-ploughed soil of Cathay.\"\r\n\r\nNor was this the only result of the happy success of the new customs\r\ndiplomacy, for, as the connecting link between commerce and politics, the\r\nBoard of Trade was a potent agency in determining the political action of\r\nthe Government, more especially when there was a strong man at the head\r\nof it and a weak one at the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nThe rising power in China did not seek fresh conquests, but was adroit in\r\nseizing on such as came in its way, and circumstances having brought it\r\nin direct touch with the Foreign Office, that department was drawn into\r\nclose relation with the Chinese customs.\r\n\r\nThe result of all this, briefly stated, was the partial effacement of\r\nthe Legation and the gradual promotion of Sir Robert Hart to the first\r\nplace in the confidence of the British Government. As the Foreign Office\r\nhad, since the suppression of the Taiping rebellion and the death of\r\nLord Palmerston, been most reluctant either to busy itself or to inform\r\nitself respecting affairs in China, and was, moreover, anxious to minimise\r\nthe cost of the Legation in Peking, it was rather predisposed to accept\r\nvolunteer assistance in the management of British interests in China. The\r\nLegation was then, as now, without any intelligence department, the cost\r\nof which was saved under the vague belief that all needful information\r\nmight be obtained from the customs. Thus relegated to a secondary place,\r\nthe Legation was more and more neglected by Her Majesty's Government,\r\nuntil at last representatives were selected at random and sent out\r\nwithout instructions, in blind reliance on the good offices of the\r\nInspector-General of Customs.\r\n\r\nBefore this final stage had been reached, however, such an opportunity\r\noccurred, through the death of Sir Harry Parkes, of legitimising\r\nthe irregular connection, as a death sometimes provides in certain\r\nrelations of domestic life, and Sir Robert Hart was himself appointed\r\nBritish Minister. This step was recognised as so far appropriate to the\r\ncircumstances that it conjoined responsibility with power, which had\r\nbeen too long divorced from each other. But just as the new Minister\r\nwas about to assume his duties a hitch occurred with the Tsungli-Yamên,\r\nwhose views as to the succession to the post of head of the customs not\r\ncoinciding with Sir Robert Hart's, he thereupon resigned the office of\r\nBritish Minister and resumed his Chinese service. The incident made no\r\ndifference in the confidence which Sir Robert Hart inspired in the Foreign\r\nOffice, which had, in fact, drifted into a position of dependence on the\r\ninspector-general. This close relationship continued until the Japanese\r\nwar in 1894, when the British Government, the victim of many illusions,\r\nfound itself in a condition of bewilderment, like King Lear on the heath,\r\nquite unfurnished with the means of coping with the superior intelligence\r\nof the other European Powers.\r\n\r\nThroughout all these years the attitude of the inspector-general towards\r\nhis Chinese employers was absolutely above suspicion. He served them\r\nloyally throughout, and if the British Government imagined he was using\r\nhis highly paid position under the Chinese Government in any way to\r\npromote other than Chinese interests, that was a gratuitous assumption on\r\ntheir part for which they alone were responsible, and for which, as for\r\nall false strategy, the inevitable penalty must be paid.\r\n\r\nAmong the important international services rendered by the foreign\r\ncustoms, the effective lighting of the coast deserves the first place.\r\nNext to that may be reckoned the compilation of accurate statistics of\r\nforeign trade with China, more complete perhaps than exists in any other\r\ncountry. The reports of the commissioners of customs at the various\r\nports are also replete with varied and useful information concerning the\r\ncommerce, industry, and agriculture, with other conditions of the life\r\nof the Chinese. Special subjects assigned to individual men are treated\r\nas exhaustively as if investigated by a Royal Commission. These valuable\r\npapers constitute a modern Chinese Repository to which there is but one\r\ndrawback--its inaccessibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. EMIGRATION.\r\n\r\n    Extensive emigration of Chinese labourers in consequence of\r\n    gold discoveries--Great abuses--Attempt to diminish same by\r\n    international action--Tripartite treaty concluded in Peking--Not\r\n    ratified by France and England--Who send out amended treaty,\r\n    but negotiations never resumed by Chinese--Opposition of British\r\n    colonies and the United States to Chinese emigration.\r\n\r\nThe first public question with which Sir Rutherford Alcock was called upon\r\nto deal was that of the emigration or exportation of Chinese coolies.\r\nAmong the consequences of the gold discoveries of the middle of the\r\ncentury was a demand for human labour, which China of all countries was\r\nbest able to supply. Voluntary emigration to California and Australia\r\n(the \"Old\" and the \"New Gold Mountain\") was considerable; but it did not\r\nmeet the requirements of those enterprises in tropical and subtropical\r\ncountries which, if not originated, were at least stirred into activity\r\nby the impulse radiating from the gold mines. The contractor was called\r\ninto requisition, and Chinese were carried off in shiploads to Cuba,\r\nPeru, Chili, \"where they were sold into virtual slavery\" under agreements\r\nover which there was no legal supervision. Terrible abuses characterised\r\nthe traffic; mutiny and massacre on the high seas were among the natural\r\nconsequences. \"Another coolie tragedy\" was as common a newspaper heading\r\nin the 'Fifties as \"another missionary outrage\" in the subsequent decades\r\nof the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nHongkong being the most convenient shipping port, it was natural\r\nthat thence should emanate the first efforts to suppress the abuses\r\nof the traffic. The \"Chinese Passengers Act\" passed by the Colonial\r\nLegislature in 1855 was a well-considered step in that direction, and\r\nthe establishment of responsible emigration agencies was another. Such\r\nefforts, however, could only be partially successful; for while they\r\ncleared the colony from participation in a nefarious trade, they made\r\nno impression on the trade itself. Indeed, by throwing it into the least\r\nreputable channels, the fate of the victims may even have been rendered\r\nless endurable by the restrictive measures conceived for their benefit.\r\nThe Portuguese settlement of Macao remained open, and there the coolie\r\ntraffic flourished exceedingly, to the pecuniary advantage of that colony\r\nand of the maternal Government, which levies an annual tribute from its\r\nFar Eastern offspring. The trade was also carried on in a more or less\r\nclandestine and irregular manner at Canton, Swatow, and other Chinese\r\nports, under non-British flags.\r\n\r\nFor years the colonial press was filled with the horrors of the traffic.\r\nSuch paragraphs as the following were continually appearing in the\r\nHongkong newspapers:--\r\n\r\n    At Macao the coolie trade is still rampant, with all its\r\n    abominations. The inquiries instituted, or said to have been\r\n    instituted, by Governor Amaral, have ended in smoke. Day after day\r\n    some additional iniquity comes to light in connection with this\r\n    horrible traffic. Coolies kidnapped, imprisoned in barracoons,\r\n    flogged to make them consent to sign the iniquitous contract that\r\n    binds them to a life of slavery, marched with a strong guard to\r\n    testify at the Government offices to their signature as given\r\n    voluntarily and freely, half-starved, exposed to blindness and\r\n    disease on board ship in transit to the place of their exile,\r\n    tossed overboard, or left on some barren isle to die, if loss of\r\n    sight or sickness renders them useless to their masters. Such\r\n    are the grand features of the Macao coolie trade, supported by\r\n    the governor in his official acts, and the semi-official paper he\r\n    edits. Such are the horrors of a slave-trade worse than that of\r\n    the poor African negro, which all nations ought to unite to put\r\n    an end to.\r\n\r\nForeigners could of course have had no success whatever in such\r\nman-hunting schemes without the interested co-operation of the natives.\r\nHow this was obtained may be gathered from such reports as that of Mr W.\r\nM. Cooper, acting consul at Swatow, one of the principal entrepots.\r\n\r\n    Nowhere [he says] is population more dense than in the plains\r\n    of the Han. There is a constant tendency, where the struggle\r\n    for existence is so keen, and no drain exists as that caused by\r\n    recruiting for an army, towards the formation of a scum of bad\r\n    characters, whom their idleness or ill-deeds drive to prey on the\r\n    more industrious. These, frequently discarded by their families,\r\n    are seen by the official and the village elder on their way to\r\n    the coolie-house with a sense of relief and satisfaction; and\r\n    not seldom is the coolie-broker aided in his object of obtaining\r\n    men by persons of this class, and frequently by the relations of\r\n    the men themselves. Thus the trade is allowed to take root with\r\n    the concurrence of the heads of the people, who not only rid\r\n    themselves by means of it of a nuisance and a burden, but make\r\n    money by the transaction; and a connection is formed which the\r\n    broker, in his thirst for dollars, becoming gradually hardened and\r\n    more ruthless, is not slow to avail himself of in carrying out,\r\n    with greater boldness, evil designs on his victim.\r\n\r\nBut if the atrocities incident to the capture and embarkation cried aloud\r\nfor a remedy, the brutalities of the middle passage were no less heinous;\r\nand though the light could not easily penetrate the scenes enacted in the\r\ndistant mines and plantations which were the ultimate destination of the\r\ncoolies, enough was known to show that their lot in Spanish-American and\r\nother countries and colonies was far from enviable.\r\n\r\nTo efface this blot on civilisation was the first object which engaged\r\nthe attention of Sir Rutherford Alcock in Peking. The Chinese Government\r\nitself had remained for many years callous to the cruelties perpetrated\r\non its subjects; but this was in keeping with its tolerant habit, its\r\nblindness to things disagreeable, and its constitutional aversion to\r\novert action of any kind. The Peking authorities seem, however, to have\r\nbeen at last aroused by the interest in the question evinced by foreign\r\nGovernments, and in 1866 the Chinese Ministers were induced to join\r\nthe foreign Powers in devising means to ameliorate the condition of the\r\nemigrants. The suggestions of Prince Kung were practical and well directed\r\ntowards a solution of the problem.\r\n\r\nThe problem, however, was by no means simple; for to be effective,\r\nregulations must be of universal obligation, and receive the sanction of\r\nall the interested Powers. There was no desire in any quarter to arrest\r\nthe stream of honest and free emigration; on the contrary, it was welcomed\r\nas an outlet for destitute Chinese. To impose restrictions on Hongkong\r\nwhile the neighbouring colony was lawless and free; to place obstacles\r\nin the way of emigration to Demerara and Trinidad, where the coolies\r\nwere happy and contented, thereby driving them in greater numbers to\r\nterritories where they were enslaved,--was obviously no gain to humanity.\r\nThe question, however, was as urgent as it was difficult.\r\n\r\nYet there were circumstances in the situation favourable to a satisfactory\r\nissue. Chief among these was the fact that France and England were\r\nstill working loyally together in matters of cosmopolitan concern. Sir\r\nRutherford Alcock found his French colleagues in Peking as amenable as he\r\nhad found those in Yedo. The consequence was that, as the result of the\r\nwinter's labours, a tripartite convention for the regulation of coolie\r\nemigration was signed in March 1866 by the British and French Ministers\r\nand Prince Kung. The convention was approved by the Ministers of Russia,\r\nthe United States, and Prussia, though they were not parties to it.\r\nBut the French Government took exception to certain of its provisions,\r\nand deferred ratification until these should be modified. The British\r\nColonial Office and Emigration Board fell in with the views of the French\r\nGovernment. The settlement of the question was thereupon shifted from\r\nPeking to Paris and London, when voluminous correspondence ensued between\r\nthe two Foreign Offices, extending through the years 1866, 1867, and\r\ninto 1868. The co-operation between the two Governments was hearty and\r\ncomplete; and the amount of patient labour devoted to the task, especially\r\nby the French Foreign Office, which had not the auxiliary machinery at its\r\ndisposal which existed in the Government departments in England, was in\r\nthe highest degree creditable to both. It may suffice to say that after\r\neighteen months of earnest work a \"Projet de Règlement International\r\nd'Emigration\" was completed in twenty-three articles with subsidiary\r\nforms, and was despatched to Peking at the end of 1867, the discussions\r\nhaving resulted in the retention of almost the entire text of the original\r\nconvention--a fact which reflected no small credit on the Ministers in\r\nPeking who had drawn it up.\r\n\r\nBut when the time came for resuming negotiations in the Chinese capital,\r\nthe Government there had relapsed into its habitual apathy respecting\r\nthe welfare of its people. Possibly, also, the zeal of the resident\r\nMinisters of France and England may have cooled during the interval\r\nwhich had elapsed since their previous efforts. Their attention was\r\nbecoming engrossed with other subjects. Effective co-operation between\r\nthe three parties was evidently no longer feasible. The attempt to\r\nregulate emigration by a comprehensive international agreement was tacitly\r\nabandoned, and the evils of the coolie trade were left to be dealt with\r\nsporadically.\r\n\r\nFree emigration from Hongkong--that is to say, of emigrants who paid\r\ntheir own passage--proceeded all the while on an extensive scale. But\r\nthe laws of the colony did not permit contract emigration except to\r\nBritish colonies, and under elaborate supervision both at embarkation and\r\nafter arrival at the field of labour. Although coolie ships could not be\r\ndespatched from Hongkong, a certain amount of indirect participation in\r\nthe traffic was maintained for some years by residents in the colony who\r\nsupplied fittings for the coolie ships preparatory to their proceeding\r\nto the port of embarkation. Colonial legislation, however, gradually put\r\nan end to this, and successive ordinances so narrowed the field of the\r\ncontractors' operations that the trade, both direct and indirect, was\r\npractically extinguished so far as Hongkong was concerned. A declaration\r\nby the Chief Justice in 1873 summed up the various prohibitory laws by\r\nenacting that the coolie trade would be treated as a slave trade, aiding\r\nor abetting which would be felony. In the year following, the Portuguese\r\nGovernment, yielding to the friendly pressure that had been for a long\r\ntime put upon them, passed a law prohibiting the coolie trade at Macao.\r\n\r\nWhile the emigrants were so anxiously protected at the outset of their\r\nvoyage, the immigration of Chinese into the United States and the\r\nAustralian colonies was exciting interest of a different kind in those\r\ncountries. Legislation was continuously directed against the influx\r\nof Chinese, and not legislation only, but barbarous ill-treatment and\r\noutrages on a par with those perpetrated against foreigners in China. Mr\r\nSecretary Seward on his round-the-world tour in 1871 expressed himself\r\nhighly favourable to Chinese labour in the United States, and his views\r\nafforded great encouragement to emigration to California for some years\r\nafter. The treaty concluded at Washington in 1868 by Mr Burlingame\r\naccorded full privileges to Chinese in the United States. But a sharp\r\nreaction occurred in the views of American statesmen, and in 1880 the\r\nChinese Government, by treaty made in Peking, consented to a modification\r\nof the Washington treaty of 1868, which would allow the United States to\r\nlimit or suspend, though not absolutely to prohibit, Chinese immigration.\r\nThis step towards prohibition was completed in another convention signed\r\nat Washington in 1894. Why the Chinese Government should have gratuitously\r\nconsented to attach a stigma to their country and people is one of those\r\ninexplicable matters which abound in the history of China's foreign\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. KOREA.\r\n\r\n    Comes into the sphere of international relations in 1866--Illegal\r\n    propagandism followed by persecutions--France adopts the\r\n    cause of the missions--Calls upon China as suzerain to punish\r\n    Koreans--Which failing, French Minister proclaims annexation\r\n    of Korea--Naval expedition repulsed--American naval expedition\r\n    repulsed in 1871.\r\n\r\nIt was in the year 1866 that foreign aggression first complicated the\r\nrelations between China and her tributaries. The kingdom of Korea had with\r\nmore consistency and more success than either China or Japan secluded\r\nitself absolutely from foreign intrusion. Nevertheless, the ubiquitous\r\nJesuit had found his way there, under desperate subterfuges; for if\r\nthe foreigner in general was proscribed, the foreign religionist was\r\nanathema to the rulers of Korea. The laws of the country were draconic\r\nin their severity against all priests or pretenders to supernatural\r\nauthority; but the zeal of the Catholic propaganda defied the laws,\r\nthough not always with impunity. \"Persecutions,\" in fact, occasionally\r\nbroke out, and \"massacres\" was a not inappropriate description of the\r\nrepressive measures adopted by the Government in vindication of what it\r\nconsidered the law of the State. The French Government, or at least its\r\nrepresentative in Peking, resolved to espouse the cause of the persecuted\r\nmissionaries in 1866, and to make reprisals on the King of Korea. But\r\nthat country being a vassal state, the demand was first made formally on\r\nthe suzerain, that he should cause the Korean persecutors to be punished\r\nand the missionaries avenged. This was not only prejudging the particular\r\ncase, but was yet another instance of foreigners forcing a formula on\r\nChina, and making her answerable to a tribunal of whose jurisdiction\r\nshe had no cognisance. The relations of China to the surrounding States\r\nwhich acknowledged her suzerainty were vague and various, imperfectly\r\nunderstood by Western States, as was sufficiently proved in the Burma\r\nConvention concluded between Great Britain and China in 1886. But the\r\nFrench _chargé d'affaires_ recognised no debatable ground such as even\r\nin the international comity of the West differentiates one dependent\r\nState from another, and one suzerain Power from another. In the British\r\nsystem alone the diversity in the relations of the members to the head\r\nis sufficient to exclude the application of any general rule. While the\r\ntouchstone of war would no doubt reduce all to one level, yet in the\r\nmatter of administrative responsibility what single rule could embrace,\r\nfor example, India, Malta, the self-governing colonies, the Transvaal, and\r\nthe African Protectorates? M. de Bellonet, however, was not embarrassed\r\nby any dubitations about the clean-cut rule to be enforced on China and\r\nKorea. He simply demanded that the suzerain should punish the vassal,\r\nfailing which, he would take the affair into his own hands. Logical, no\r\ndoubt, and not unreasonable, assuming the quarrel to be just. But the\r\nFrench _chargé_ went a step further in adjudging the actual dissolution\r\nof the family compact and sequestration of the inferior kingdom. On\r\nPrince Kung's declining responsibility for the Korean persecutions, M.\r\nde Bellonet, without further ado, annexed Korea to the empire of France,\r\ndethroned the king, and posted placards about the streets of Peking\r\npromulgating the fact. To Prince Kung he addressed a weighty despatch, in\r\nwhich he said, \"The same day on which the King of Korea laid his hands on\r\nmy unhappy countrymen was the last of his reign. He himself declared its\r\nend, which I, in my turn, solemnly declare to-day.\"[14]\r\n\r\nThis was carrying the question beyond the scope of international law.\r\n\r\nTaking an analogy from common life, a father may neglect to correct a\r\nmischievous son, and thus leave his neighbours free to take the law into\r\ntheir own hands, but their right to chastise or prosecute does not include\r\nthat of annulling the parental relationship, and of making a bondman\r\nof the offender. Force, of course, may effect such a rupture in the\r\nconnection between nations, but in this case the force had not yet been\r\napplied. Admiral Roze proceeded with a squadron to the mouth of the Han,\r\nthe waterway to the Korean capital, bombarded forts, and left his name to\r\nan island which faces the port of Chemulpo. The incident was then at an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nBut not the effects of it. It was to Chinese and Koreans a flash of the\r\nRöntgen rays that revealed the innermost hearts of the foreigners with\r\na vividness not to be forgotten; it was the whole missionary question,\r\nfrom the Eastern point of view, in a nutshell. To violate the laws and\r\nteach the natives to do so, and then appeal to foreign Governments to\r\nback them in this insidious form of rebellion--that was the function of\r\nthe missionaries. The foreign Government thereupon lays claim to the\r\nterritory, and so the conspiracy is crowned. In the face of such an\r\nunveiling of motives the chance of the Chinese statesmen being led by\r\nthe friendly counsel poured constantly into their ears by the foreign\r\nMinisters in Peking must have been small indeed.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time a small American vessel called the General Sherman,\r\nwith a cargo of notions and some passengers, including one English\r\nmissionary, made her way through the archipelago which fringes the coast\r\ninto the inner waters of Korea. She was never again heard of, and the\r\nfate of crew and passengers was for long a matter of report and surmise.\r\nAt last, in 1868, a United States ship of war, the Shenandoah, was\r\nsent to the Korean coast to get information about the General Sherman.\r\nNothing whatever was learned. Then Mr George F. Seward, consul-general in\r\nShanghai, advocated a mission to Korea with a sufficient force to ensure\r\nrespect. His persevering recommendations prevailed with the Government at\r\nWashington, and a squadron was equipped in 1871 to proceed to Korea and\r\nattempt to open the country, the admiral being furnished with copies of\r\nthe Japan treaties of 1854 and 1858 as models. The Americans at once came\r\ninto collision with the Korean troops, bombarded their forts, and defeated\r\nwith considerable loss a military force marshalled to resist them. But\r\nno negotiations were possible. The Korean Government remained impervious\r\nto remonstrance and uncompromising in its refusal of intercourse. The\r\nfollowing characteristic letter, addressed by the Korean authorities to\r\nAdmiral Rogers, tersely expresses their attitude of resolute isolation:--\r\n\r\n    In the year 1868 a man of your nation, whose name was Febiger,\r\n    came here and communicated and went away; why cannot you do the\r\n    same? In 1866 a people called the French came here, and we refer\r\n    you to them for what happened. This people has lived 4000 years\r\n    in the enjoyment of its own civilisation, and we want no other.\r\n    We trouble no other nation--why do you trouble us? Our country\r\n    is in the extreme east, and yours in the extreme west; for what\r\n    purpose do you come so many thousand miles across the sea? Is it\r\n    to inquire about the ship destroyed [the General Sherman]? Her men\r\n    committed piracy and murder, and they were punished with death.\r\n    Do you want our land? That cannot be. Do you want intercourse with\r\n    us? That cannot be either.\r\n\r\nThe American ships withdrew, as the French had done, leaving the peninsula\r\nonce more to its fate.\r\n\r\nPreviously to this a piratical expedition was attempted by a German in\r\na North-German steamer, instigated and piloted by a French priest. Its\r\npurpose was to desecrate the tombs of the kings, with a view to carrying\r\noff the golden treasures with which they were believed to be buried.\r\n\r\nThe three fiascos left no outward trace in the current of affairs in\r\nChina, and diplomatic intercourse proceeded in the capital as if the\r\nKorean peninsula did not exist. Let it not be supposed, however, that\r\nthe statesmen of Peking failed to take these exhibitions to heart,\r\nalthough they maintained the strictest reserve on the subject. Christian\r\nproselytism and foreign domination were once more discovered in active\r\nalliance, justifying all the suspicions of the Asiatic nations.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [12] There is more truth than may appear in the bishop's paradox.\r\n    Peking is singularly free from epidemics, except occasionally\r\n    of smallpox. When Shanghai suffered so severely from cholera in\r\n    1862, there were two British regiments quartered there--one, the\r\n    67th, within the native city, amid filth and stagnant water; the\r\n    other, the 31st, in the foreign settlement, in quarters carefully\r\n    selected by the surgeon, Dr Rennie. The 31st lost a third of its\r\n    strength; the 67th suffered very little. Writing in August 1860\r\n    from Peitang, a town 500 yards square in the midst of a great\r\n    swamp, into which 17,000 men were huddled, Sir Hope Grant says:\r\n    \"Notwithstanding the pestilential nature of the place, our troops,\r\n    wonderful to say, never enjoyed better health.\"\r\n\r\n [13] See _infra_, \"Revision of the Treaty,\" pp. 210-222.\r\n\r\n [14] _Vide_ 'U.S. Diplomatic Corresp.,' vol. ii. for 1867, p. 424.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE REVISION OF THE TREATY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. PREPARATION.\r\n\r\n    Struggle for the observance of the treaty--Hope in the prospective\r\n    revision--Information gathered by British Minister--Chinese\r\n    apprehensive of force being used--Imperial Government consult\r\n    provincial officials--Interesting memorials in reply--Especially\r\n    from Li Hung-chang--His liberal views respecting foreigners--And\r\n    wise advice to the throne.\r\n\r\nThe conflict between foreign aggressions and Chinese resistance had\r\nproceeded without intermission on either side for seven years. In the\r\nstruggle the Chinese had gained many successes, but the fruits of them had\r\nnot been secured beyond the risk of reprisal. Both sides were ill at ease.\r\nThe foreigners on their part had been buoyed up under their grievances\r\nby the hope of a readjustment of international relations, which had been\r\nprovided for in the treaties of Tientsin and Peking.\r\n\r\nThe decennial period was at hand when revision of the treaty of Tientsin\r\nmight be claimed. To that important juncture all eyes looked forward. The\r\nforeigners hoped for freer intercourse; the Chinese wished to restrict\r\nwhat already existed. Great preparations were made for the revision\r\ncampaign. On the part of the foreigners opinions were invited from all the\r\ntrading-ports as to the points where modification could be advantageously\r\nclaimed, and memorials from the Chambers of Commerce both in China and in\r\nGreat Britain, from individuals, professional men, and from missionaries,\r\npoured in upon the British Minister during the years 1867 and 1868,\r\nextending even into 1869.\r\n\r\nSir R. Alcock had even taken every possible pains to acquaint himself\r\nwith the local circumstances of the various treaty ports by personal\r\ninspection and personal communication--a practice which public opinion\r\nurged in vain upon his successors, who had much greater need of such\r\nlocal observations. Following up this tour of his own, he delegated to\r\na subordinate the task of studying the conditions under which trade was\r\ncarried on in the interior, in the districts most likely to be affected by\r\nany probable changes in the treaty. Under this roving commission Consul\r\nSwinhoe made an extensive tour through the canal district of the Yangtze\r\ndelta, and finished up with an expedition to Szechuan in 1869, on which\r\nhe was accompanied by delegates of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.\r\n\r\nThe importance attached by foreigners to the occasion naturally stirred\r\nthe Chinese Government also to make special exertions to meet the coming\r\ncontest. From the measures to which they resorted it is evident that they\r\nwere apprehensive lest force should be applied by the foreigners to gain\r\ntheir ends; for the idea of free negotiation and of voluntary agreement\r\nhad not yet been assimilated by the Chinese. To them the foreigner\r\nrepresented force and nothing else. They had never really comprehended\r\nthe reasons for the withdrawal of the Allies when in possession of Peking,\r\nand though the immediate danger of war was removed, the shadow of it never\r\nceased to haunt the dreams of Chinese statesmen.\r\n\r\nMistrusting their own resources, the Central Government appealed to the\r\nprovinces for confidential advice; and as these communications throw light\r\non the inner--though not the innermost--thoughts of the Chinese, which it\r\nis difficult otherwise to gauge, some of them are worth perusing in the\r\nactual words of the writers.\r\n\r\nThe secret circular addressed by the Tsungli-Yamên to the high officials\r\nthroughout the empire in 1867 opened abruptly with the proposition, \"The\r\nbarbarian question is one of old standing\"; it then proceeded to review\r\nthe difficulties and the dangers of \"our present conjuncture,\" arising\r\nmainly from the improvement of communications and armaments combined\r\nwith the earth-hunger of the various European nations. The foreigner at\r\none time stood in awe of the Central Power, but that was before railways\r\nand steamships had been invented; and while the numbers who came to\r\nChina were as yet insignificant, and were conveniently restricted to one\r\nspot, where they could be managed, now they occupy so many positions as\r\nto form a strategic cordon round the empire. Moreover, they are united\r\nin interest, and cannot suddenly be either isolated or weakened. How,\r\nthen, can we confront them with our isolation and weakness? It is to\r\nbe feared that we have no one who, taking a comprehensive view of the\r\nwhole situation, can create disunion among our enemies through their own\r\nrivalries and insatiable avarice. Yet it is just here that the germ of\r\nan effective policy should be sought. If, however, circumstances render\r\nsuch a scheme at present impracticable, its execution may be deferred. We\r\nmust be patient under suffering, diligently strengthening ourselves, and\r\nabide in hope. We bear in mind the calamities of 1860, and how to save\r\nthe State the emperor was entreated to conclude a treaty. It was evident\r\nthat the treaty, hastily concluded, would remain a fruitful source of\r\nfuture difficulty; nevertheless, good faith required that it should be\r\nfulfilled, and even the very fulfilment of it be turned into a means of\r\nlimitation and restraint. The time for revision being now at hand, you are\r\nrequested to give your suggestions as to the means of avoiding a rupture\r\nwith foreigners, and in case of a rupture, what will ensure safety. The\r\nprincipal points likely to be brought forward at the revision conferences\r\nare here submitted for your consideration. To simply declare the whole\r\nimpracticable is easy; the difficulty will be to devise a plan for safely\r\navoiding concession. Deal with the matter, therefore, in a practical way,\r\nand not by an empty thesis; and let your memorial reach us not later than\r\nDecember. The points are--(1) The audience question. (2) The question\r\nof an embassy to foreign countries, which had been repeatedly urged by\r\nthe various foreign Ministers in Peking. The arguments in favour of such\r\na measure are, that \"to know your adversary as he knows you\" is a maxim\r\nof practical wisdom, and that it would be of great advantage to have the\r\nmeans of appealing from an unreasonable foreign Minister in Peking to his\r\nown Government. (3) Telegraphs and railways. (4) Residence of merchants in\r\nthe interior. (5) Salt trade and coal-mining. (6) Extension of missions.\r\n\r\nSuch was the substance of the Tsungli-Yamên's circular to the\r\ngovernors-general and governors of provinces. The memorials in reply\r\nwere distinguished by some plain speaking. Amid a good deal that was\r\nvaporous and fantastic, such as would characterise any general council,\r\nthere were propositions of sound statecraft, maxims which it would have\r\nbeen good for the Central Government to lay to heart, and side-lights\r\non their traditional conceptions of national policy well deserving to be\r\nstudied by the Powers which have relations with the Chinese. One clause\r\nin the memorial of Tsêng Kwo-fan, for example, went to the root of the\r\nadministrative difficulties which caused then, and still cause, the major\r\nportion of the angry friction between Chinese and foreign officials.\r\nHe reminded the emperor, in fact, that he had a court of appeal in the\r\nprovinces; so that though he might, under pressure, be forced to concede\r\npoints to the foreign nations in Peking, yet it was the memorialist\r\nhimself and his peers in the provinces who would have the last word to\r\nsay. The elliptic and allusive style usually assumed in Chinese documents\r\nmay allow this hint to be interpreted either as a veiled defiance of, or\r\nas an assurance of support to, the throne--perhaps both subtly compounded.\r\nBut the practical inference remains, that, as experience has often proved,\r\nthe provinces revise the decisions of the capital, and the execution rests\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LI HUNG-CHANG AT THE AGE OF FIFTY.\r\n   _From a photo by J. Thomson, Grosvenor Street, W._ ]\r\n\r\nThe memorial, however, which is most interesting to foreigners, because\r\nthe plainest to their comprehension, is that of Li Hung-chang, at that\r\nperiod Governor-General of the Hu-kwang; and as it affords a key to that\r\nstatesman's subsequent career and the unique position he has occupied\r\nin regard to the foreign relations of the empire, it seems well worthy\r\nof reproduction. Omitting the preamble, and certain classic references\r\nwithout which a Chinese State Paper would be no more complete than a\r\nspeech in Parliament or a leader in the 'Times' fifty years ago would\r\nhave been without a Latin quotation, the substance of the memorial runs\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n    The humble opinion of the writer is, that in conducting business\r\n    with foreigners the point of the greatest importance is to avoid\r\n    exciting their contempt; that contempt once excited, they will\r\n    thwart us at every turn, and even in affairs that are really\r\n    practicable they will contrive a thousand schemes and devices to\r\n    throw obstacles in the way of their practicability. But if they\r\n    feel respect for China, all matters can be mutually arranged;\r\n    and even difficult questions can be settled by compromise or\r\n    agreement.\r\n\r\n    Foreigners, however, are not the only persons who are influenced\r\n    by this feeling: it animates alike the minds of the whole human\r\n    race.\r\n\r\n    It is often said that foreigners are crafty and malign and full\r\n    of unexpected ruses: but is it not the fact that Chinese are the\r\n    same; or rather that the outrageous craft and malignity of the\r\n    Chinese exceeds even that of foreigners? The truth is, that at\r\n    present foreigners are powerful and the Chinese feeble. And whence\r\n    arises the power of the former? It certainly is not innate in\r\n    them, but depends upon the fact that \"the requisites of Government\r\n    are sufficiency of food, sufficiency of military equipment, and\r\n    the confidence of the people in their ruler\" (Confucian Analects).\r\n    And how is the weakness of China to be accounted for? This also is\r\n    not innate, but is a result of the truth of the above axiom not\r\n    being sufficiently recognised. The present condition of foreign\r\n    countries resembles that of China before the union, or is perhaps\r\n    even still more formidable.\r\n\r\n    In the course of time foreigners came to China, opened numerous\r\n    marts, and conveyed their merchandise everywhere. They traded\r\n    at as many as five ports, and all with no other object but that\r\n    of making the wealth of China contribute to their own. A little\r\n    consideration shows that those who ventured to come to this\r\n    country must have placed their reliance upon something to have\r\n    rendered them so fearless; and there is not the slightest reason\r\n    why that which they confided in should not also become a source\r\n    of confidence to China.\r\n\r\n    Many persons have offered their views upon the several questions\r\n    now under consideration, and it is useless to take the trouble\r\n    to recapitulate them. But all such appliances as telegraphs,\r\n    railways, locomotives, and steamships--the things on which\r\n    foreigners rely--can without exception be learned by the Chinese.\r\n    It is often alleged that these inventions are attended with\r\n    harm: how is it, then, that in foreign countries every district\r\n    has its trains and steamers, every locality its telegraphs and\r\n    railways? Natives of China, too, have travelled abroad and can\r\n    bear testimony that these things, so far from being harmful, are\r\n    advantageous.\r\n\r\n    Imperial audience is distinctly stipulated for in the treaty of\r\n    1860, and it is next to impossible to withdraw it; especially as\r\n    his sainted Majesty Kanghsi admitted Japanese to his presence,\r\n    and there will be no difficulty in ascertaining the ceremony then\r\n    employed. And again, during the negotiations with the Russians\r\n    on the boundary and trade questions, which took place about the\r\n    same period, they were treated as an equal Power. It is but right,\r\n    indeed, to consider such Powers as upon a footing of equality with\r\n    ourselves.\r\n\r\n    The idea of the writer is to wait until the majority of the\r\n    emperor, and then to receive all the representatives in a\r\n    side-hall as was done by his sacred Majesty Kanghsi. It will,\r\n    however, first be necessary to arrange distinctly whether such\r\n    interviews are to take place once or twice a-year. Otherwise an\r\n    impropriety will be caused by their constantly demanding audiences\r\n    every few days on frivolous questions.\r\n\r\n    Such a course presents no difficulties from our point of view, and\r\n    from theirs it is a _sine quâ non_. Moreover, they would see how\r\n    the imperial magnanimity extends to every region. Their request\r\n    may with great propriety be granted.\r\n\r\n    As to the appointment of an envoy, in the fourth year of Tungchih,\r\n    Pin Ch'un and others were sent on a visit to the several foreign\r\n    countries, and the Tsungli-Yamên has lately written to state\r\n    that Chih kang and others have now proceeded thither. Thus the\r\n    mission has been continuous, and it would be well to adhere to\r\n    this system.\r\n\r\n    The question of separate missions at the Courts of the several\r\n    Powers, however, still remains for deliberation. In discussing\r\n    these questions persons are apprehensive, either that the\r\n    emperor's commission will be disgraced, or that there will be an\r\n    extravagant expenditure of the imperial funds. But such persons\r\n    are not acquainted with the whole bearing of the subject.\r\n\r\n    Memorialist is of opinion that this question is eminently\r\n    susceptible of a satisfactory solution. After selecting reliable\r\n    and trustworthy men to reside at foreign Courts, it will be\r\n    necessary to appoint subordinates and interpreters, who can be\r\n    exchanged every three or every five years. Interpreters, indeed,\r\n    should be selected from each country to which an envoy proceeds--a\r\n    system which would give us the double advantage of facilitating\r\n    public business, and of affording us an opportunity to display\r\n    our amicable desires. Far from being detrimental, the project is\r\n    attended with great advantages.\r\n\r\n    The matter of missionary extension is beset with greater\r\n    difficulties than the rest, especially as it is not a State\r\n    question with foreign Governments.[15] At the present moment\r\n    innumerable churches are being erected in every province,\r\n    district, and department for the explanation of their canon and\r\n    the preaching of their faith; and the common people are one-half\r\n    of them deceived, and the other half led to join them for evil\r\n    purposes. Instructions should be issued to the superintendents\r\n    of northern and southern trade, as well as to the generals,\r\n    viceroys, governors, customs superintendents, and taotais, to\r\n    become intimate with the foreign officials with whom they are\r\n    in communication. Then, when anything is to be arranged, there\r\n    would be no harm in telling them distinctly that when the common\r\n    people misbehave the local functionaries must adjudicate; and\r\n    that when it happens that the people refuse to become proselytes,\r\n    the officials can on no account insist upon their doing so\r\n    against their will--for such a course would but raise riots and\r\n    disturbances, to the detriment of international amity. At the\r\n    approaching revision of the treaty all possible arguments must be\r\n    used with regard to this point, and on no account must any further\r\n    clause be added.\r\n\r\n    With reference to the remaining points--viz., coal mines,\r\n    importation of salt, erection of inland warehouses, inland\r\n    steam navigation, and the like--these, although comparatively\r\n    unimportant matters, nevertheless entail serious consequences. If\r\n    their introduction is harmless, there is no necessity to waste\r\n    words and ink in the raising of disputes and complications; but\r\n    if, on the other hand, there are among them concessions which\r\n    we are unwilling to make, it will be very proper to \"explain the\r\n    circumstances to them and argue the rights of the case,\" and they\r\n    will hardly wish to press embarrassments upon us.\r\n\r\n    Should they, however, take advantage of their strength to\r\n    impose upon our weakness by dividing our territory and sharing\r\n    among them the fat of the land, in such a pressing crisis the\r\n    greatest firmness would be necessary. But there need be no great\r\n    apprehension of such a contingency, for the simple reason that,\r\n    with the exception of Russia, foreign countries are all too\r\n    distant from China, and the acquisition of its territory would be\r\n    nothing but an embarrassment to them.\r\n\r\n    The fact is, that the prosperity of foreign countries is\r\n    inseparably connected with the welfare of the Chinese people; and\r\n    instead of draining that people to the last drop, would they not\r\n    rather prefer to use, without exhausting--to take, and still leave\r\n    a residue?\r\n\r\n    The present occasion of treaty revision with the English is a\r\n    most important juncture. The English treaty once disposed of,\r\n    there will be no difficulty with the other Powers. The danger\r\n    to be apprehended is that during the revision of next year they\r\n    will employ coercion to extort concession. This, however, may be\r\n    known previously; and should it be the case, it will of course\r\n    be necessary to select experienced troops and able officers to\r\n    confront them. Should nothing of the sort occur, negotiations\r\n    should be entered upon.\r\n\r\n    In short, supposing we are to cherish a feeling of revenge and\r\n    devise schemes to subvert foreign Powers, it will be necessary to\r\n    wait until--with large armies and abundant supplies, with no rebel\r\n    or Mohammedan outbreaks in the provinces, and no difficulties in\r\n    the capital--we can cope with them without hesitation. We shall be\r\n    a match then for all adversaries; but otherwise we cannot engage\r\n    in a rash and random conflict. Even when it is supposed that we\r\n    are ready for the struggle, it will still be necessary to exercise\r\n    extreme and continual caution, and to wait until our spirit is\r\n    high, and our aspect, therefore, formidable. Then should there\r\n    be no war, the question would be disposed of; but in the event of\r\n    our taking the field, it would not be unvictoriously.\r\n\r\n    Memorialist, however, has had several years' experience in\r\n    conducting business with foreigners, and is thoroughly familiar\r\n    with their character. He has found that, no matter what they are\r\n    engaged in, they act honourably without deceit or falsehood. But\r\n    although it is possible to acquire a general knowledge of their\r\n    mode of action in the conduct of their own affairs, yet there is\r\n    no means of becoming thoroughly acquainted with the details and\r\n    motives of their conduct. Their bearing, however, in military\r\n    matters affords clear evidence of their straightforwardness.\r\n    There is the instance of the Englishman Gordon, late\r\n    commander-in-chief at Soochow, who, having organised 3000 troops\r\n    of the Ever-Victorious Army, took the field against the rebels.\r\n    Subsequently, at the capture of Soochow, the memorialist himself\r\n    observed that officer personally leading in advance of his\r\n    troops with a courage and _sang-froid_ worthy of all praise. He\r\n    subsequently became the recipient of the imperial commendation\r\n    and reward.\r\n\r\n    The writer has also, in conjunction with Tsêng Kwo-fan, acting\r\n    viceroy of the two Kiang, been associated with foreigners in\r\n    organising foreign-drilled infantry and cavalry, and in making\r\n    arrangements for the building of steam-vessels. He is thoroughly\r\n    convinced that they are actuated by upright and amicable\r\n    principles, and entertain no feelings of animosity towards China.\r\n    With the knowledge of these facts before us, it is possible to\r\n    draw our conclusions upon other matters.\r\n\r\n    It is from these considerations, therefore, that the writer\r\n    suggests the policy to be pursued in intercourse with foreigners.\r\n    There seems to be no necessity to dispose of the several\r\n    questions hastily and on the instant, nor do the resident foreign\r\n    Ministers at Peking apparently intend to insist upon an immediate\r\n    settlement.\r\n\r\n    It would be well if H.I.M. on attaining his majority were himself\r\n    to adopt the policy suggested, and in that case no difficult\r\n    questions would arise.\r\n\r\n    6th year, 11th month, 6th day.\r\n\r\nAs perhaps the best essay yet extant in translating the Chinese imperial\r\ntradition into the language of the modern world, this paper of Li\r\nHung-chang's is full of instruction for foreign diplomatists. Read in\r\nthe light of the subsequent thirty years, we see that it sets forth\r\nthe principles which have inspired the whole public life of the most\r\nprominent man in China. His recognition of the honourable character of\r\nforeigners, as he knew them, represented a notable advance on the like\r\ntestimony of Commissioner Lin in 1841, inasmuch as Lin deduced from it\r\nthe ease by which their good faith could be abused, while Li made it\r\na ground of confidence in co-operation with them. His recommendation\r\nto his contemporaries, to cultivate intimacy with foreign officials in\r\norder to obviate misunderstandings in the execution of the treaties, was\r\nonly preaching that which he has consistently practised throughout his\r\nofficial life. He was the first high official who braved public opinion by\r\nsitting with open doors. This conciliatory temper and open mind has made\r\nLi Hung-chang the lubricator in many jarring conflicts; and it kept him,\r\ncontrary to constitutional usage, for twenty-five years at the diplomatic\r\noutpost of the capital.\r\n\r\nHis delicate handling of the suggestion of the Central Government,\r\nto resist by hostile means the proposals of foreigners, is also\r\ncharacteristic of the man who had seen war and hated it. While bowing to\r\nthe imperial will, he proposed postponement of its execution. In a similar\r\ncase many years afterwards a memorial of Li's was quoted as an incitement\r\nto war with Japan, whereas it was an extinguisher, in diplomatic form,\r\nput upon the bellicose proposal of another.\r\n\r\nNot the least interesting part of Li's memorial is the ground on which\r\nhe advocates reform--the proved superiority of foreign nations. His\r\nargument takes the identical form, and is expressed in the very words,\r\nused by the Daimios of Japan; and the circumstances of the two countries\r\nin their foreign relations were in the main so similar, that it cannot\r\nbut be instructive to observe how they comported themselves respectively\r\nunder the stress of the foreign irruption. Both had been overawed by\r\nforeign forces, and both sought revenge by using the strength of their\r\nopponents for their own regeneration. The difficulty, as we see it, in\r\nthe carrying out of the scheme of regeneration was of the same nature in\r\nboth countries--the want of unity and centralisation. Japan was divided\r\nup into feudal principalities; China into provinces and prefectures as\r\nindependent as self-governing British colonies. The councils of the\r\nDaimios bore a rough analogy to the consultations with the governors\r\nand governors-general of China. The enemy was the same, and the means of\r\novercoming him are as clearly laid down in Li Hung-chang's memorial as in\r\nthe most perfervid of the Japanese manifestoes. How, then, did it come\r\nabout that the same leaven should have fermented with such miraculous\r\nrapidity in the one country, while in the other it has been buried in a\r\ntorpid mass? Obviously this is a matter which will repay the consideration\r\nof those who concern themselves with the state and prospects of China.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE BURLINGAME MISSION.\r\n\r\n    Mysterious inception--American Minister becomes Chinese envoy\r\n    to Western countries--Objects of mission concealed--Its first\r\n    adventure--Mr Burlingame concludes treaty at Washington--Persuades\r\n    British Government to adopt new policy in China.\r\n\r\nThree processes--separate, though not independent--were going on\r\nsimultaneously during the year 1868: the revision of the British treaty\r\nin Peking; an epidemic of anti-foreign demonstrations in the provinces;\r\nand the progress of the Burlingame mission in Europe. One of them cannot\r\nbe understood without the other; but taking the revision of the treaty\r\nas the object towards which the other two converged, it will be simpler\r\nto reserve the special consideration of the treaty question until we have\r\ngiven a short outline of the accessory episodes.\r\n\r\nOf the eight questions submitted to the provincials, one was disposed of,\r\nand that in a surprisingly precipitate manner, a month before even the\r\nmemorials of the various authorities were sent in. An embassy to Europe\r\nand America was appointed, equipped, and despatched in the month of\r\nNovember 1867, and with a foreigner at its head. A proceeding so contrary\r\nto Chinese tradition naturally excited curiosity as to its origin,--a\r\ncuriosity which has been tantalised but not to this day satisfied, though\r\nthe mission itself soon became ancient history. It is certain none of the\r\nrepresentatives of foreign Powers then in the capital were consulted,\r\nor in any way taken into confidence with regard to the scheme--except,\r\nof course, the one who transferred himself from the service of his own\r\ncountry to that of China. \"No one,\" wrote Sir Rutherford Alcock, \"knew\r\nthat the Chinese were on the eve of a revolution which would materially\r\nchange the aspect of affairs.\" This by way of explaining an important\r\nmemorandum he had just written on the state of China, which would have\r\nbeen of a different tenor had any hint of what was intended been given to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAs the embassy was the first that China had sent to a foreign country,\r\nand as it was commissioned under some urgent demand which evidently\r\nwould brook no delay, its composition, character, and objects are all\r\ninteresting to the student of Chinese politics. There were three envoys,\r\ntwo Chinese and one foreign. The latter was the Hon. Anson Burlingame,\r\nMinister of the United States to China, who of course was the spokesman of\r\nthe mission. A better selection for the purpose could not have been made,\r\nhad even a larger choice of men been open to the Chinese. Mr Burlingame\r\nhad been an active politician in his time, and was a practised orator. If\r\nwe add the epithet \"sophisticated rhetorician,\" which was ten years later\r\napplied to a still more eminent personage, that is little more than to say\r\nhe was a special pleader. And he was engaged on special pleader's duty.\r\nWhatever the genesis of the mission, therefore, it was a master stroke of\r\nthe Chinese Government, eclipsing all their other contrivances to resist\r\nthe expected demands of foreigners at the revision of the treaties. It was\r\nthe first open attempt by the Chinese to apply the homœopathic principle\r\nto their international affairs in using the foreigner as an antidote to\r\nthe foreigner.\r\n\r\nThe Burlingame mission left Peking with the ostensible approval of\r\nthe foreign representatives. The support of the British Minister was\r\ngiven in the most practical way by the permission granted to the acting\r\nChinese secretary, Mr J. McLeavy Brown, to accept the secretaryship of\r\nthe mission--a favour the more marked in that Mr Brown happened to be\r\nthe _locum tenens_ of Mr Wade, who had just gone on leave, so that his\r\ndeparture left the British Legation destitute at a season of the year when\r\nit was impossible to call up substitutes from the ports, and at a time\r\nwhen the greatest burden of work was in prospect. And yet the true object\r\nof the mission was concealed from Sir Rutherford Alcock. \"I do not know\r\nwhat Mr Burlingame's instructions may ultimately be,\" he wrote in January\r\n1868, adding, \"but it is very obvious what is the work which devolves upon\r\nhim.\" Sir Rutherford's judgment of its purpose seems to have been based on\r\nhis own inferences from the facts of the situation and his unquestioning\r\nfaith in Mr Burlingame's loyalty to his professed principles.\r\n\r\nHe had known Mr Burlingame for two years as the _doyen_ of the diplomatic\r\nbody, the most fervid champion of that \"co-operative policy\" whereby the\r\ntreaty Powers agreed to act as a united body in pursuit of identical\r\nobjects. He could not suppose that his late colleague had turned his\r\nback on those common objects without notice. Although, therefore, the\r\nsuddenness and secrecy of the move might have suggested misgivings as\r\nto the mission being intended to promote the views of the diplomatic\r\nbody in Peking, yet it is beyond question that Sir Rutherford Alcock\r\nheartily favoured the embassy. His confidence in it is further attested\r\nby a very long and elaborate memorandum which he addressed to Prince\r\nKung, indicating the uses to which the embassy should be put in bringing\r\nabout an understanding with the Powers, whereby Chinese interests would\r\nbe safeguarded while the treaty rights of foreigners should be amply\r\nfulfilled. \"I see in the mission a hope of improvement and a material\r\nchange in the whole aspect of affairs.... Proves there are Ministers with\r\npower and influence in the councils of the emperor who believe the time\r\nhas come for breaking with the past.... After a long night of weariness\r\nand futile efforts, daylight begins to appear.... I hail the appointment\r\nof a representative to the Western Powers as the beginning of a new era.\"\r\nSuch was the Minister's valediction in his report to the Foreign Office.\r\nBut he had been mightily deceived. The night had indeed been long, but\r\nit was not the true dawn which was welcomed with this joyful acclamation.\r\nHow quickly the gloom settled down again on that scene of fruitless toil\r\nwill presently be seen.\r\n\r\nThe mission was introduced to the notice of the world by a humorous\r\nprelude, which may be quoted for the sake of the light it incidentally\r\nthrows on the chronic state of China. On their way from Peking to\r\nTientsin, seventy or eighty miles, the envoys halted at a large\r\nmarket-town, where a report met them of a phenomenon not very uncommon\r\nin those parts, especially in winter--a band of marauders who had been\r\nannoying the neighbourhood. The mission took refuge in an inn, resolved\r\nto stand a siege until aid should come. In this strait Mr Burlingame\r\nseems never to have thought of applying either to the local authorities\r\nof the town or to the Government he was serving, but despatched urgent\r\nmessages to Peking, where there were escorts kept at the Russian and\r\nBritish Legations, and to Tientsin, where was the British gunboat Dove.\r\nHis appeals were answered with alacrity from both sides. From Peking came\r\na relief party of British and Russian soldiers in charge of members of\r\nthe two Legations; from Tientsin a party of mounted bluejackets under\r\nLieutenant Dunlop. They met at the half-way house where the mission lay,\r\nbut nothing could be seen or heard of the besiegers. Mr Burlingame's\r\nparty reached their port of embarkation without further adventure. Indeed\r\nthe only serious matter that arose out of the imbroglio was a difference\r\nof opinion between one Vodkansky of the Cossack guard and Mulvaney, a\r\nsturdy Hibernian of the British escort, which the latter proposed to\r\nsettle by the means in vogue among heroes before the days of Agamemnon.\r\nTragic consequences were, however, averted by the soothing diplomacy\r\nof the representative of her Majesty's Legation, Mr Conolly, and the\r\ntwo Burlingame relief expeditions returned to their respective stations\r\nnothing the worse for a couple of days' outing in the bracing November\r\nair.\r\n\r\nMr Burlingame made his _début_ in the United States, first by eloquent\r\nspeeches in San Francisco, and next by what assumed the form of\r\nserious negotiations at Washington. An orator cannot reasonably be held\r\naccountable for every detail of his orations, but Mr Burlingame's mission\r\nmay be most favourably summarised by a few carefully chosen words of his\r\nown:--\r\n\r\n    1st. It was the object of the mission to disabuse the foreign\r\n    Powers of an impression they were supposed to entertain, that the\r\n    Chinese Government had entered upon a retrograde policy.\r\n\r\n    2nd. To deprecate a precipitate and unfriendly attempt on their\r\n    part to enter upon a policy which might make all progress\r\n    impossible from its menacing tone and \"violent shock to the\r\n    feelings, and even prejudices, of the people.\"\r\n\r\nTranslated into practice, these propositions meant that China wished\r\nto be let alone; and that, we may safely assume, represented the whole\r\nextent of Mr Burlingame's instructions. This claim was embodied in a\r\nconvention which he made at Washington, comprising certain \"additional\r\narticles\" to the American treaty of 1858, the purport of which was that\r\nthe United States undertook to apply no pressure to China, which, it may\r\nbe presumed, that Power had never the intention of doing. The convention\r\nwas for several reasons not welcomed at Peking, but it served the only\r\npurpose which perhaps it was ever expected to serve, that of giving the\r\nkeynote to the representations which the envoy was afterwards to make to\r\nthe various Powers in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe next Government to which Mr Burlingame addressed himself was that\r\nof Great Britain, over which he obtained a more important success than\r\nover that of the United States. In fact, he persuaded Lord Clarendon\r\nto discard all the information that ever reached the Foreign Office\r\nfrom its own responsible agents in China--men who were bound by every\r\nconsideration of loyalty and public duty to report only what was true,\r\nand to accept instead thereof the protestations of an agent hired to\r\nmake out a case; for it is superfluous to add that Mr Burlingame was\r\nfar indeed from representing the true state of facts. He succeeded in so\r\naltering the course of the British Government that their agent in China\r\nwas discredited, stultified, and rendered powerless to effect the objects\r\nfor which he had been labouring. This was the first step of the Foreign\r\nOffice in the new departure which had many evil results--that, namely, of\r\ntaking their cue not from agents in their own pay, but from others over\r\nwhom they could exercise no control, and who had alien interests to serve.\r\n\r\nFrom the Chinese point of view the Burlingame mission was a decided\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. CHINESE OUTRAGES--YANGCHOW AND FORMOSA.\r\n\r\n    Missions attacked at Yangchow--Redress refused by Chinese\r\n    and enforced by consul--With naval assistance--Satisfactory\r\n    issue--Continuous outrages in Formosa--Government affords no\r\n    relief--Disturbances quelled by British forces--Lawlessness near\r\n    Swatow--Communications with interior controlled by bandits--Order\r\n    restored by Consul Alabaster with naval force--Peace and\r\n    good feeling between Chinese and foreigners resulting from\r\n    these various measures--Which were approved by Imperial\r\n    Government--Disapproved by British Government in consequence of Mr\r\n    Burlingame's representations--Consuls punished--Lord Clarendon,\r\n    prompted by Mr Burlingame, sends fresh instructions to Minister\r\n    and consuls.\r\n\r\nThe year 1868 was marked by serious anti-foreign outbreaks in widely\r\ndistant provinces of the empire. At Yangchow, a wealthy city on the Grand\r\nCanal, twelve miles from the left bank of the Yangtze river, a favourite\r\nresort for retired officials, rich salt merchants, and gentry, the Inland\r\nmissionaries under the orders of Mr Hudson Taylor established themselves.\r\nIn no locality in China could they have been less welcome, for there they\r\nmet their natural enemies in the greatest force. Before long an attack\r\non them was organised at the instigation of the literati and gentry, and\r\nwith the connivance of the local authorities. \"The onslaught was sudden\r\nand severe, the mob set fire to the premises, the ladies and children of\r\nthe mission had to be thrown out of the windows to save their lives.\"\r\nThere was no mistake, therefore, as to the murderous intentions of the\r\nassailants. The nearest British consul was at Shanghai, the consulate at\r\nChinkiang, twelve miles from the scene of the outrage, being in charge\r\nof an assistant, Mr Clement Allen. That young officer hastened instantly\r\nto the assistance of the missionaries, and made his protest against the\r\nculpable negligence, to say no more, of the Chinese officials, who on\r\ntheir part made a great to-do of hushing the matter up and repairing the\r\ninjured house. Consul Medhurst promptly followed up the representations\r\nmade by Mr Allen by personal appeal to the viceroy at Nanking, fifty miles\r\ndistant. The mind of that high official had already been prejudiced by\r\ningeniously falsified reports of the transaction supplied to him by the\r\nprefect of Yangchow, and in consequence he refused Mr Medhurst's request\r\nto depute an official to accompany him to that city for the purpose of\r\ninvestigating the facts. Thereupon Mr Medhurst, availing himself of the\r\narrival of H.M.'s ship Rinaldo at Chinkiang, obtained from her commander\r\na sufficient escort to accompany him to Yangchow; and then only did the\r\nviceroy, Tsêng Kwo-fan, appoint an officer, though of totally inadequate\r\nrank, to co-operate with the consul. The Chinese officer did not, however,\r\nkeep his appointment, and Mr Medhurst proceeded without him, and placed\r\nin the hands of the prefect at Yangchow a written demand for redress, one\r\nof the items being the seizure and punishment of the gentry, whose names\r\nwere submitted. The prefect at once declared his inability to deal with\r\nmen of such influence, all being of higher rank than himself. As nothing,\r\ntherefore, could be settled at Yangchow, the prefect agreed to accompany\r\nMr Medhurst to Nanking to lay the whole matter before the viceroy.\r\nA deputy from the viceroy, however, met Mr Medhurst at Chinkiang and\r\nendeavoured to dissuade him from proceeding to Nanking, offering instead\r\nto accompany him back to Yangchow, according to the original programme. Mr\r\nMedhurst, in his turn, persuaded the deputy to return with him to Nanking\r\non H.M.'s ship Rinaldo, which was to start from Chinkiang the following\r\nmorning. But the deputy Chang did not keep that appointment, any more\r\nthan he had kept his previous one. The prefect of Yangchow also found\r\nmeans of evading his promise to accompany the consul into the presence\r\nof the viceroy. After much pressure on the one side and evasion on the\r\nother, the viceroy offered to settle the matter by a charitable gratuity\r\nto the missionaries in lieu of damages, and showed his anxiety to get\r\nthe affair patched up quickly by sending an official of rank to follow\r\nMr Medhurst on board H.M.'s ship Rinaldo, where he spent two hours in\r\nattempting to persuade the consul to accept the terms offered. Matters\r\nwere, in fact, in a fair way of settlement when, \"just at this juncture,\"\r\nthe commander of the Rinaldo fell sick and determined to proceed with\r\nhis ship to Shanghai, the consul being thus left in a humiliating and\r\nhelpless position, as Sir Rutherford Alcock describes it. The Chinese\r\nofficials at once changed their tone, withdrew from negotiations, and\r\nnothing more could be done with them. The action of the naval officer\r\nin abandoning the consul was freely criticised at the time, and being in\r\nconsequence asked by the Admiralty for an explanation, he stated, among\r\nother things, \"that it never entered his head that the presence simply\r\nof a small man-of-war could have the effect of influencing the viceroy.\"\r\nHe also stated that he had \"been given to understand that the viceroy had\r\nexpressed his willingness to comply with Mr Medhurst's requests, and would\r\nsend a letter to that effect that night or the next morning.\" The gallant\r\nofficer did not appear to perceive that the withdrawal of his ship before\r\nthe viceroy's promise had been fulfilled completely changed the situation.\r\n\r\nNothing was left for the consul, then, but to lay the whole case before\r\nH.M.'s Minister, and in doing so he made these observations: \"I can call\r\nto mind, out of my experience of British relations with China, scarcely\r\none instance in which the outrage complained of has been more unprovoked\r\non the part of the sufferers, and in which the evidence of neglect and\r\nculpability on the part of the local authorities has been more marked\r\nand incontrovertible. Few cases can have occurred, moreover, in which the\r\npower to grant prompt and reasonable redress was more within the reach of\r\nthe supreme provincial authority.\"\r\n\r\nThe Minister, in his turn, had no resource but to call upon the admiral\r\non the station \"to repair the mischief by sending such naval force\r\nto the mouth of the Grand Canal as shall enable him, if necessary, to\r\napply effective pressure both on the local authorities and populace at\r\nYangchow and on the viceroy at Nanking,\" to whom the consul was once\r\nmore instructed to address himself. Of course the Minister had before\r\nthis applied in the usual form to the Tsungli-Yamên, and with the usual\r\nresult. They deprecated hasty conclusions until they themselves had\r\nfull information from the local authorities; but they admitted without\r\nhesitation that, assuming the facts, full redress must be granted.\r\n\r\nThe Minister's representations to the Central Government were renewed\r\nwith greater emphasis on receipt of the news of the collapse of the\r\nconsul's negotiations. Prince Kung then expressed his readiness to\r\nmake the compensations demanded; but as regarded the punishment of the\r\ninstigators of the outrage, he contented himself with tacitly indorsing\r\nthe plea of the viceroy, \"that the gentry indicated were men of high\r\nrank, and incapable of wilful disregard of treaty provisions, for which\r\nreason they need not be called to account.\" In reply the Minister stated\r\nthat immunity to such offenders, more especially if highly placed, is\r\nwholly incompatible with the treaty rights of foreigners. A new inquiry,\r\nhowever, was instituted at Yangchow, and the Viceroy Tsêng, who had just\r\nbeen gazetted to another post, was warned not to leave Nanking until the\r\naffair was concluded. After an interval of two months, Consul Medhurst,\r\nescorted by a naval force despatched to his aid by Admiral Keppel, sent\r\nhis cards once more to the Nanking viceroy. The old tactics were repeated,\r\nand negotiations threatened to be indefinitely protracted, but eventually\r\npromises were given for the full redress demanded. Promises, however, had\r\nbeen given before, and it was deemed not unreasonable in the circumstances\r\nto demand a material guarantee. There happened to be lying at anchor\r\nopposite the city a small steamer recently built for the viceroy, which\r\nhe was induced to place under the orders of Captain Heneage, R.N.,\r\npending the execution of the arrangements. The end of the discussion\r\nwas a complete and satisfactory settlement of the whole affair, which\r\nincluded the deprivation of the prefect and the magistrate of Yangchow.\r\nThe after-effects have been no less satisfactory. For the last thirty\r\nyears Yangchow has been the most peaceable missionary field in the whole\r\nempire. We have set forth this incident in some detail, because it was\r\ntypical, isolated, and free from all obscurities.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were passing on the Yangtze, similar troubles, which\r\nhad been threatening for some time, came to a head in the island of\r\nFormosa. Outbreaks of mob-violence against the property and person of\r\nboth missionaries and merchants took place in different parts of the\r\nisland. At Banca, in the Tamsui district, two English merchants, Messrs\r\nKerr and Bird, were murderously assaulted by a ferocious armed mob, and\r\nMr Holt, the acting vice-consul at Tamsui, reported in October 1868 that\r\n\"remonstrance, expostulation, despatches, letters, messages, and visits\r\nhaving alike failed in securing common justice\" from the mandarin, he\r\nmight be \"driven at any moment to strike his consular flag and close\r\ncommunication with the authorities. Our lives are threatened by people\r\nwho have proved that the will to murder us is not wanting,\" and with whom\r\nthe authorities either could not or would not interfere. Mr Holt held\r\nhis ground until assistance reached him, and he made no secret of his\r\nintention to back his diplomacy by a show of force whenever he got the\r\nchance. \"Short of destruction of life and property,\" he wrote, \"I intend\r\nusing any means in my power to enforce that justice that the people who\r\nare supposed to administer it deny me. On the arrival of the gunboat I\r\nwill at once inform your Excellency of the measures concerted between the\r\ncommander and myself.\" Vice-Admiral Keppel reported to the Admiralty in\r\nDecember that \"the opportune arrival of H.M. gunboat Janus and the United\r\nStates Aroostook was followed by a full compliance with the demands of\r\nher Majesty's consul.\"\r\n\r\nMatters did not run quite so smoothly at the other end of the island,\r\nwhere missionaries as well as merchants were the object of attack. The\r\ncampaign was carried on with vigour for some six months. Redress was\r\nnot only unobtainable from the Chinese authorities, but even personal\r\naccess to them was rendered impossible by the obstruction of the mob.\r\nMr George Jamieson was obliged to forego a visit to the magistrate\r\nat Taiwan in April on the latter confessing that he could not protect\r\nhim from violence. Mr Gibson, five months later, found his road to the\r\nmandarin ambuscaded by three parties of sixty or seventy men each, armed\r\nwith jingalls, swords, and spears. Outrage succeeded outrage during the\r\nwhole period. The state of affairs was of course a subject of serious\r\nremonstrance with the Central Government, of whom the Minister first\r\ndemanded, as in the Yangchow case, a joint inquiry into the facts. For\r\nthis purpose the consul, Mr Swinhoe, who had been absent on other duty,\r\nwas ordered to his proper post. At the same time Vice-Admiral Keppel was\r\nrequested to send an adequate naval force to support the consul's position\r\nand prevent further outbreaks.\r\n\r\nThe Yamên went through the form of ordering to the spot a commissioner,\r\nwho, however, left it again immediately, thus turning the orders of the\r\nYamên into ridicule. This proceeding naturally encouraged the hostility\r\nof the local officials and of the mob who executed their behests. The\r\nsituation became most threatening.\r\n\r\nThe squadron detached by Admiral Keppel for active operations at Takow\r\nand its neighbourhood consisted of three corvettes and five gunboats, to\r\nbe reinforced if necessary by the flagship Rodney, carrying eighty-two\r\nguns. Before this imposing force arrived, however, the task they were\r\nintended to achieve had been already accomplished. \"Driven to despair,\r\nand believing life and property to be in great danger, Mr Gibson, without\r\nwaiting for instructions, called upon Lieutenant Gurdon of the gunboat\r\nAlgerine to take possession of the Chinese fort, which resulted in a loss\r\nof life and a destruction of Government stores.\"\r\n\r\nMr Gibson's action was somewhat euphemistically described as \"without\r\nwaiting for instructions,\" seeing that he had positive instructions\r\nto maintain his ground until a naval force should arrive. Both the\r\noperation itself and certain details of its execution were adverted\r\nupon so severely, first by Sir Rutherford Alcock and then by the British\r\nGovernment, that, notwithstanding Commodore Jones's commendation of \"the\r\nmost brilliant exploit I have heard of in these seas,\" Lieutenant Gurdon\r\nfell under the displeasure of the Lords of the Admiralty, as the acting\r\nconsul did under that of the Foreign Office. The object of the joint\r\nadventure, however, was attained, and the spirit of outrage among the\r\nChinese completely subdued. This happened in December.\r\n\r\nThere remained, however, yet another centre of turbulence which greatly\r\nimpeded the operation of the treaty, at the port of Swatow. The villages\r\nwhich lie between that seaport and the district city of Chow-chow-fu,\r\nsome 12 miles up the river Han, had banded themselves together to oppose\r\nforeign intercourse with the latter city. Not only were the business and\r\nproperty of foreign merchants interfered with, but a British man-of-war\r\ngig in the river was fired upon, and when the men landed to identify the\r\noffender they were overpowered by the whole population of the nearest\r\nvillage. This hostile attitude, resembling very much that of the Canton\r\nvillages twenty years before, steadily increased until the native\r\nofficials themselves were not safe in passing to and from the district\r\ncity. Strong representations were made to the high authorities of the\r\nprovince at Canton. The viceroy had promised to send a military force to\r\nquell the riotous villages, but before he had proved the sincerity of his\r\nintention the Gordian knot was cut by British initiative in January 1869.\r\nThe late Sir Challoner Alabaster, a man of uncommon resolution, was at\r\nthat time acting consul at Swatow; and he, having secured the co-operation\r\nof Commodore Jones, led a force of marines and bluejackets against the\r\noffending villages. A stout resistance was offered at first, but when\r\nseveral of the villages had been taken and destroyed the whole eighteen\r\nmade their submission. Thereafter the district enjoyed perfect peace\r\nand security. In the following March Sir Rutherford Alcock was able to\r\ntelegraph to Lord Clarendon that \"the accounts from all the ports showed\r\nthat peace and order had been restored; that at Yangchow and Formosa\r\nentire security and an improved position had been obtained; that there\r\nwas no more cause for anxiety at any point; that the best understanding\r\nexisted with the foreign body at Peking; and that the relations with China\r\nhad never been more satisfactory.\"\r\n\r\nThe bearing of these occurrences on the revision of the treaty may not at\r\nfirst sight be quite clear, but it is interesting to note in what manner\r\nthey were connected with that operation in the mind of Sir Rutherford\r\nAlcock. He calculated that the necessity of using force to vindicate\r\nforeign treaty rights, of which both he and his predecessor had constantly\r\nwarned them, would bring home to the Peking authorities the alternative\r\nwhich they would always have to face in case of failure to carry out the\r\ntreaties. How very differently these outrages and the enforced redress\r\naffected the situation in Peking will now be seen.\r\n\r\nThe action taken at Yangchow and in Formosa having been fully explained\r\nto the Tsungli-Yamên, Wênsiang and the other Ministers expressed their\r\nentire concurrence. But what satisfied the Government of China produced\r\nquite another impression on that of Great Britain. Lord Stanley, as\r\nForeign Secretary, had written on November 20, 1868: \"Mr Medhurst appears\r\nto have acted with great prudence and firmness, and you will convey to\r\nhim my approval of his proceedings.... I have to instruct you [Sir R.\r\nAlcock] to press the case in question upon the Chinese Government.\" Two\r\nmonths later Mr Medhurst was reprimanded by Lord Clarendon for his action,\r\nand the \"full satisfaction for the outrage\" was attributed exclusively\r\nto the \"readiness with which the Central Government took measures that\r\nproved effectual.\" The change of Government which had in the interval\r\ntaken place in England (December 9, 1868) was hardly sufficient to account\r\nfor so diametrical a change of view in a matter of imperial concern.\r\nAnother agency had effected the conversion of the British Government.\r\nMr Burlingame had arrived fresh from fervid denunciations in the United\r\nStates of the \"tyrannic policy\" and the \"throat policy\" of Great Britain\r\nas applied to China, and adroitly seizing on the repression of the\r\nYangchow and Formosa outrages as flagrant examples, he succeeded in\r\nincensing Lord Clarendon against the various British officials concerned\r\nin these troubles, whom his lordship visited with punishment which\r\nscarcely stopped short of vindictiveness. Mr Medhurst, indeed, a man of\r\nlong and distinguished service, had only a black mark set against his\r\nname; but Mr Gibson was publicly censured and degraded, and ordered to\r\nmake an apology to the Chinese officials whose lawless aggressions he\r\nhad lawlessly repelled. With some inconsistency, Lord Clarendon, about\r\nthe same time, approved the conduct of Acting-Consul Holt at Tamsui, who\r\nsucceeded in adjusting most serious misunderstandings with the Chinese\r\nthrough no other means than the visible force of the small gunboat Janus,\r\nfor whose arrival he waited before preferring his demands.\r\n\r\nThat the sudden change in the policy of the British Government was the\r\nwork of Mr Burlingame was frankly avowed by Lord Clarendon himself, who\r\nbased the fresh instructions to the Minister in China on the arrangements\r\nhe had concluded with the Chinese representative. In his letter of\r\ncondemnation, January 14, 1869, he, moreover, intimated that he could not\r\nwait before pronouncing judgment for Sir Rutherford Alcock's complete\r\nreport on the Yangchow affair, because his \"communication with Mr\r\nBurlingame ... rendered it necessary that he should not defer making his\r\nobservations.\" That a British Secretary of State could have so demeaned\r\nhis office would not have been believed save on his own confession. He\r\nof course carried the Admiralty with him, and the same influence which\r\ninspired the new instructions issued to the Minister and consuls inspired\r\nthose issued to the commanding officers on the China station.\r\n\r\nTaken textually, the negotiations between Mr Burlingame and Lord Clarendon\r\nwere of a platonic character. H.M.'s Government undertook to apply\r\nno pressure to China. It would have been a simple matter to refrain\r\nfrom applying pressure, and a tacit resolution to that effect with\r\ncorresponding instruction to the Minister in Peking would have secured the\r\nobject. To make it a subject of direct pledge to the Chinese Government\r\nseemed one of those gratuitous acts which all diplomatic experience\r\ncondemns as fraught with future embarrassments. To save appearances,\r\nhowever, a nominal equivalent was taken. \"Mr Burlingame was requested to\r\nbear in mind, and to make known to the Chinese Government, that we should\r\nhenceforward have a right to expect on its part the faithful fulfilment\r\nof treaty engagements, the prompt redress of grievances referred to the\r\nCentral Government, and friendly treatment of British subjects by the\r\nChinese authorities\"--as if all that had not been already stipulated for\r\nunder the solemn sanction of the existing treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. REVISION NEGOTIATIONS AND CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n    Lukewarmness of British Government--Sir R. Alcock's misgivings\r\n    as to success--Mixed commission in Peking to consider\r\n    details--Mr Hart's predominance--Treaty becomes a custom-house\r\n    concern--Increase of duties being the Chinese aim--Sir\r\n    Rutherford Alcock attributes failure to Mr Burlingame's\r\n    misrepresentations--Merchants oppose the treaty--Ratification\r\n    refused by British Government--Inferences from this\r\n    fiasco--Chinese influenced by force alone.\r\n\r\nLet us now revert to the cause and origin of the Burlingame mission--the\r\nrevision of the treaty of Tientsin. The instruction for revision was\r\ngiven by Lord Stanley on August 16, 1867, in such general terms as the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n    Her Majesty's Government neither wish, nor have they the\r\n    right, to impose sacrifices on China, even though they may be\r\n    convinced that the inconvenience of such sacrifices will be only\r\n    temporary, whereas the benefit which will result from them will be\r\n    lasting.... We must reconcile ourselves to waiting for the gradual\r\n    development of that [better] system, and content ourselves with\r\n    reserving for revision at a future period any new arrangement we\r\n    may come to in 1868.... You will of course act openly with the\r\n    representatives of other Powers, inviting and availing yourself\r\n    of their co-operation.\r\n\r\nA note of misgiving as to the policy of asking for the revision runs\r\nthrough the whole correspondence. After the preliminary labours of sifting\r\nthe voluminous memorials from merchants and others, Sir Rutherford Alcock\r\nsums up their demands thus: \"All their wants turn upon three or four\r\ncardinal defects, not of the treaties so much as in their execution.\" And\r\nhe adds the significant reflection: \"The question arises, if nothing is to\r\nbe gained by demanding a revision, ... whether much would not be lost, and\r\nan opportunity thrown away, which might, by reserving the right, be turned\r\nto better account when the emperor's majority is declared. I believe the\r\ntrue policy of foreign Powers would be to wait; ... to this conclusion\r\n... all the representatives of foreign Powers now in Peking are led.\" \"The\r\nChinese,\" he also says, \"would go much faster and better if left alone.\"\r\n\r\nThe question naturally suggested by these remarks--why a task involving\r\nenormous labour, of which only negative results were to be expected, was\r\nentered upon at all at such an inopportune moment--remains unanswered.\r\n\r\nIt would be insufferably tedious, and of no practical utility, to track\r\nthe windings of a maze leading nowhere, for the revised treaty was never\r\nratified. But the labours of two whole years could not but leave landmarks\r\nto guide succeeding travellers over the same ground. It could not be but\r\nthat with so much beating of the bushes the game would be started, if not\r\nbrought to bag. It was a reconnaissance in force which, for the first\r\ntime, compelled the respective parties to the struggle to reveal their\r\ntrue character and intentions. Such a discovery was perhaps not too dearly\r\nbought by the time and trouble expended on it.\r\n\r\nThe first definite step in the process of revision was the nomination of\r\na mixed commission of British and Chinese \"to devise means of securing a\r\nmore prompt redress of commercial grievances.\" The members were Mr Fraser,\r\nsecond secretary to the British Legation; Mr Hart, Inspector-General of\r\nCustoms; and two secretaries of the Tsungli-Yamên--a heavy preponderance\r\non the Chinese side of the question. To the same commission was added\r\nanother British member, Mr Adkins. And here it is not impertinent to\r\nobserve that the absence of both the Chinese secretary, Mr Wade, and the\r\nacting Chinese secretary, Mr Brown, left the Legation in a condition too\r\ncrippled to engage on work which would have taxed its full strength. The\r\nmembers of the commission held many sittings, reporting proceedings from\r\ntime to time to their respective principals, the Tsungli-Yamên and the\r\nBritish Minister.\r\n\r\nIt needs no great effort of imagination to divine, in a body thus\r\ncomposed, whose would be the dominant voice. Mr Hart conducted the\r\nproceedings throughout. The discussion had not gone far when it was found\r\nhopeless to revise the provisions of the treaty in any sense compatible\r\nwith progress or freer intercourse; and the dangerous questions which had\r\ncaused the Government so much anxiety, and which had inspired both the\r\nBurlingame mission and the various secret memorials, being thus happily\r\nruled outside the controversy, the Chinese Ministers seem to have given\r\nthemselves no further concern about the revision. This distant attitude\r\nof theirs was severely commented on by a contemporary writer in 'Fraser's\r\nMagazine,' who said:--\r\n\r\n    After ten years of conciliatory blandishments on our part, the\r\n    high Chinese authorities had so far disobeyed the spirit of the\r\n    treaty that, although they had not actually prevented our Minister\r\n    from corresponding and visiting with them, yet they had had the\r\n    audacity to render all such intercourse absolutely nugatory,\r\n    and had constrained him, after a long and successful diplomatic\r\n    career, to descend to the extremely humiliating position of\r\n    treating with them indirectly through the medium of Mr R. Hart.\r\n\r\nAs, however, the proceedings became focussed on a tariff revision destined\r\nto add to the duty receipts, a \"collector of revenue wanting money,\" as Mr\r\nHart described himself, was the most fitting negotiator, and the Chinese\r\nministers were well pleased to leave him free to make his own bargain, so\r\nlong as it yielded that result.\r\n\r\nTo give colour to the Chinese demand for higher duties a bold formula was\r\nresorted to, and supported by equally bold reasoning. The expedient was\r\na rearrangement of the method of collection of inland dues on foreign\r\nmerchandise, which was then, as it continues to be, the great bone of\r\ncontention between foreign traders and the Chinese authorities. The\r\ntreaties conferred on merchants the right of compounding for all inland\r\ntaxation of their merchandise by a single payment at the port of entry;\r\nbut the practices of the Chinese officials had rendered the privilege a\r\nnullity. In the new negotiations Mr Hart, on the part of the Chinese,\r\ntook the high ground of maintaining, with subtle dialectic, that the\r\nprotection which foreigners claimed was not in fact given by the treaties.\r\nSo strongly did the Chinese entrench themselves in this contention, that\r\nheavy artillery was required to dislodge them. \"Could any negotiators\r\nbe so dull or incompetent,\" wrote Sir R. Alcock in reply, \"as to sign a\r\ntreaty of commerce with an Eastern potentate, extorted at the point of\r\nthe bayonet, and leave this unlimited power in his hands to turn against\r\nus the next moment, or whenever he pleased, and nullify all that had been\r\nstipulated, destroying the trade for which alone war had been made?\"\r\nDefeated in argument, the Chinese next begged that what they could not\r\nclaim as a right might yet be accorded to them as a favour, thus copying\r\nthe tactics of the Japanese in an analogous case.\r\n\r\nAs this proved to be the crux of the whole transaction, the rock on which\r\nthe convention eventually split, it is useful to consider how the subject\r\nwas treated in the negotiations. The treaties of Nanking, 1842, and of\r\nTientsin, 1858, provided for the transit of British goods throughout\r\nthe empire on payment of a fixed charge. But in securing exemption from\r\narbitrary imposts in the interior, the treaty of Nanking signally failed;\r\nthat of Tientsin had proved equally ineffective, and why? From inherent\r\ndifficulties in the nature of things--obstacles absolutely insuperable\r\nso long as the country remained under the same organic conditions. Such\r\nwere the propositions with which the British Minister entered upon the\r\ndiscussion of the subject; and as no proposal was made for changing the\r\norganic conditions of the empire, the prospect of obtaining a satisfactory\r\nfulfilment of those treaty provisions did not seem very encouraging.\r\n\r\nBut then a suggestion, apparently emanating from Consul Robertson at\r\nCanton, was made for simplifying the problem by doing away with the option\r\nwhich had been reserved in the treaties for foreign merchants, either\r\nto pay the commutation at the port of landing, or to allow their goods\r\nto run the gantlet of the Chinese customs stations. Instead of this, it\r\nwas suggested that a single compulsory payment, amounting to half the\r\nimport tariff, might be levied on the landing of the goods, which should\r\nthereafter be freed from all other imposts throughout the empire. It\r\nwas not unnatural that a \"collector of revenue\" should appropriate this\r\nconception, and introduce it into the revised treaty; but then the doubt\r\nimmediately arose on the other side, whether the promised exemption would\r\nbe any more of a reality than it had been under the existing _régime_. If\r\nthe difficulties in the way of fulfilling the stipulation in the treaty\r\nof Tientsin and Nanking were really insuperable, would they now disappear\r\nmerely because the Chinese Government received an increased import duty?\r\nIn considering Mr Hart's proposal, \"the question would be,\" according to\r\nSir Rutherford Alcock, \"Could we obtain a sufficient guarantee that such\r\nadditional import due would effectually exempt British goods from all\r\nother dues, local, provincial, and what not?\" And again, \"Security for\r\nexemption from all but the fixed 2½ per cent was the one question on which\r\ndepended the value of any revision.\"\r\n\r\nA necessary condition of any successful treaty was the assent of\r\nall the other Powers to its provisions, seeing that under their\r\nmost-favoured-nation clauses any one of them by holding aloof could\r\nrender the treaty inoperative. The various foreign representatives were\r\ntherefore kept informed of the progress of negotiations. In this way their\r\nopinions were obtained from time to time as to the merits of the various\r\nproposals. On the subject of the compulsory payment of transit dues the\r\nopinions which the British Minister received from his colleagues were\r\nall unfavourable. They considered that some \"additional guarantee would\r\nbe necessary against failure, and as against security for additional\r\nlosses which would be entailed upon the merchants.\" To give effect to\r\nthe new proposals an edict was to be published acquainting all provincial\r\nofficials with what had been agreed upon. But still the diplomatic body\r\nmaintained \"that nothing is really certain but the addition of 2½ per\r\ncent to the import duties. This will be rigorously exacted and paid;\r\nbut whether the equivalent exemption from all other taxation will be\r\nobtained must be held doubtful, ... seeing that in the past the same\r\nprovincial authorities have shown the most persistent disregard of\r\ntreaty stipulations and proclamations.\" \"Under such circumstances,\" Sir\r\nRutherford adds, \"it would seem reasonable that, during the first year\r\nat least, all amounts collected under the new arrangements ... should be\r\ncarried to a separate account ... to meet claims for compensation.\" In the\r\nend, however, he saw reason to waive this proviso, to disregard the views\r\nof his colleagues, and to assent to the new impost, without any guarantee.\r\nAttempts to obtain concessions from the Chinese in the way of freer\r\nintercourse proved, as we have said, hopeless from the first. The renewal\r\nof the Chinese demand to establish a customs station in Hongkong--that\r\n\"immense smuggling depot\"--was refused on the British side; while the\r\nBritish request for recognition of Hongkong as a port of call for goods\r\nin transit to Canton was in like manner refused on the Chinese side,\r\nbecause it \"would give the place a respectable name\" as well as make it\r\nthe \"great emporium of the south.\" Hongkong, it is fair to remember, was,\r\nnot unnaturally, odious in the eyes of the Chinese. The more prosperous\r\nthe colony became, the more they hated it; and the more patriotic among\r\nthem--as, for instance, the Minister Wênsiang--detested it the most.\r\n\r\nThe ruling factor in eliminating all measures of progress from the\r\nnegotiations and reducing the whole to a customs question was Mr\r\nBurlingame.\r\n\r\n    After the arrival of the mission to Washington [wrote Sir\r\n    Rutherford on February 27, 1869] the hopes which the signature\r\n    of the additional articles was calculated to excite undoubtedly\r\n    exercise a very prejudicial effect on my efforts.... With Mr\r\n    Burlingame's enthusiastic reception, and the prompt signature\r\n    of the convention by which the United States Government pledged\r\n    itself to leave China free to adopt or reject all such innovations\r\n    and internal improvements, and even to use its influence with\r\n    other Powers for the same end, they gained precisely the assurance\r\n    they wanted.... From that moment further progress or successful\r\n    negotiation became impossible.\r\n\r\nHe added in a subsequent despatch to Lord Clarendon:--\r\n\r\n    One result stands out more clearly than any other, and it is this:\r\n    what we have gained by the last year's preliminary negotiations is\r\n    not likely to be withdrawn. But if it was difficult to negotiate\r\n    for large concessions before the assurance authoritatively given\r\n    by your lordship to Mr Burlingame, ... it is now out of the\r\n    question to hope for more than has already been conceded....\r\n    Strong in the assurances of two of the treaty Powers, ... it is\r\n    quite certain that no further progress can be made at present. It\r\n    simply remains for her Majesty's Government to determine whether\r\n    they will carry out the revision on the basis proposed and already\r\n    assented to by the Chinese Government, or defer the revision\r\n    altogether to some later period.\r\n\r\nThe provisional report of the negotiations having been submitted by the\r\nForeign Office to the other treaty Powers for their opinion, most of\r\nthem contented themselves with amicable generalities, the only definite\r\ncriticism elicited being that of the North German Confederation. Going\r\nstraight to the core of the matter, in May 1869, Count Bernstorff wrote\r\nas follows, basing his remarks upon the opinion of the German merchants:--\r\n\r\n    Although the advantages which are to be expected for trade in\r\n    general from the abolition of the \"lekin taxes\" would not be\r\n    too dearly bought by this extension of the transit duty to all\r\n    commodities, yet, on the other hand, the treaty Powers certainly\r\n    have the right of demanding the abolition of the taxes levied\r\n    contrary to treaty, even without giving anything in return,\r\n    and they might probably obtain this result by common action.\r\n    And then, moreover, it appears, from existing circumstances\r\n    in China, exceedingly questionable whether this tax, even if\r\n    abolished by imperial edict in consequence of a treaty, would not,\r\n    nevertheless, still be levied by the mandarins, although perhaps\r\n    in another shape, since now indeed they have their assignments\r\n    thereon.\r\n\r\nDoubts on the part of the Foreign Office led to further correspondence\r\nbackwards and forwards, closing with the following ambiguous despatch,\r\ndated 29th September, which was transmitted by telegram, a very slow\r\nprocess in those days:--\r\n\r\n    If you should not have concluded an arrangement before this\r\n    reaches you, her Majesty's Government think it would be better\r\n    to protract negotiations rather than accept now a limited\r\n    arrangement, which would be binding for so long a period as ten\r\n    years, and which would not comprise a satisfactory arrangement\r\n    respecting transit duties, and which might compromise the right\r\n    of her Majesty's Government to take part in the negotiations of\r\n    other Powers for a revision of their treaties.\r\n\r\n    Should you, however, have completed any arrangement, you may be\r\n    assured that the best view will be taken of it here.\r\n\r\nThe supplementary convention was, in fact, signed in October, and Sir\r\nRutherford Alcock took his leave immediately after, visiting the Yangtze,\r\nShanghai, Hongkong, and India on his way to Europe. At these places\r\nhe explained in general terms the bearing of the treaty, the Indian\r\nGovernment being specially concerned in the increase of the Chinese import\r\nduty on opium, to which the trade generally were absolutely indifferent.\r\n\r\nThe supplementary convention was exhaustively reviewed by the Shanghai\r\nGeneral Chamber of Commerce in a memorial addressed to Lord Clarendon\r\n(December 31, 1869). To the practical view of the merchants the treaty\r\nconsisted of three clauses: one making compulsory what had previously been\r\noptional--the payment of half the import duty in commutation of inland\r\ndues on foreign merchandise; one doubling the export duty on raw silk;\r\nand the third more than doubling the import duty on opium. Of these, the\r\nfirst alone was deemed important. The consideration offered by the Chinese\r\nGovernment for the compulsory payment--that they would frank imported\r\ngoods through nine of the eighteen provinces of China--was not regarded as\r\nan equivalent; for the treaty of Tientsin contained the same undertaking\r\nwithout the geographical limitation, but it had not been fulfilled. The\r\nground alleged for this non-observance of the existing treaty had been\r\nthe existence of insurmountable obstacles in connection with provincial\r\nand imperial finance. These obstacles, the merchants observed, were\r\n\"now assumed to have been suddenly overcome,\" an assumption which they\r\nconsidered illusory. The question of transit dues was not new to them:\r\nit had been threshed out on all sides during weary years; it was the\r\nrecurrent topic of the day with them, as it was destined to continue to\r\nbe for a generation longer; and the merchants could not therefore believe\r\nthat the difficulties against which they had been hopelessly struggling\r\nwere suddenly removed by magic. They were not shown how the revolution was\r\nto be effected. In short, \"the conclusion,\" they said, \"was irresistible,\r\nthat to a very great extent the commutation of transit dues, which is\r\nmade compulsory by the new treaty, will simply become an additional tax\r\non trade without any return whatever; and that the provincial authorities\r\nwill as heretofore tax goods in transit very much as they please, the\r\ntreaty stipulation to the contrary notwithstanding,\"--a conclusion\r\nsupported by arguments which could not be refuted.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Wade some years later expressed the same views as the merchants\r\nhad done. \"I doubted,\" he said, \"the good faith of officials when breach\r\nof faith could only be established by the evidence of those subject to\r\ntheir authority and entirely in their power.... I have since found reason\r\nto believe that the control of taxation in the provinces is a matter of\r\nno small trouble to the Central Government as at present constituted,\r\nif indeed it be possible at all.\" Nevertheless, he adds, \"I have found\r\noccasion to regret that the convention has not been allowed at least a\r\nterm of probation.\" A term of probation was the alternative suggested by\r\nthe merchants also, but it seems never to have received any consideration\r\nfrom the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nThe representation which the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce based upon\r\ntheir review of the treaty was adopted by influential commercial bodies in\r\nEngland, who in a \"monstrous deputation,\" as Mr Hammond called it, urged\r\non the Secretary for Foreign Affairs the non-ratification of the treaty.\r\nThe British Government gave way, not, as they candidly admitted, convinced\r\nby the reasoning, but overawed by the electoral pressure of the merchants;\r\nand the supplementary convention was allowed to fall through.\r\n\r\nThus ended the first attempt to negotiate a treaty with China as a\r\nperfectly free agent. The conclusion to be drawn not only from the\r\nnegative result, but from the whole process of the negotiations--from the\r\nmemorials from the provinces, and still more from the Privy Council, the\r\nsix boards, and the censorates--is, as stated by Sir Rutherford Alcock in\r\nMay 1869, \"that the old spirit of arrogance of the days of Lin and Yeh is\r\nstill in full vigour, and the assumption of superiority over the barbarian\r\nabsolutely unmeasured. That the anti-foreign element amongst the official\r\nand educated classes has suffered no diminution whatever; that if some\r\ntwo or three leading men take a clearer view of the political situation,\r\nthey are evidently without power to take action upon it; and so the vessel\r\nof State is allowed to drift whichever way the tide of prejudice and\r\nignorance may set. There are still some documents,\" he added, \"wanting to\r\ncomplete the series, especially the answer of Li Hung-chang and a second\r\nmemorial of Tsêng Kwo-fan [p. 184 _seq._], which it would be desirable to\r\nobtain as showing the policy advocated by two of the most prominent men\r\nin the empire at this moment.\"\r\n\r\nOne sentence of Sir Rutherford Alcock sums up the case China _v._ the\r\nWest: \"Pressure, indeed, there must always be here if anything is to be\r\nachieved for the advancement of foreign interests and commerce. In one\r\nway or other, however we may disguise it, our position in China has been\r\ncreated by force--naked, physical force; and any intelligent policy to\r\nimprove or maintain that position must still look to force in some form,\r\nlatent or expressed, for the results.\" Whether the Western nations,\r\nsingly or collectively, are justified in using their force for such a\r\npurpose is a question which is not affected by this plain statement of the\r\ncase. That the policy of the Western Powers has been largely influenced\r\nby sentimental consideration towards China is true; but their action\r\nhas never been consistent with their professions, and their oscillation\r\nbetween coercion and submission has led to disastrous consequences.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n [15] He now knows better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nMISSIONARY PROBLEM--TIENTSIN MASSACRE OF 1870.\r\n\r\n    Importance of missionary question long foreseen by Consul\r\n    Alcock--Introduction of missionaries under two French\r\n    treaties--Toleration of Christians under treaties of 1858--Forced\r\n    upon China--Ardour of missionary spirit uncontrollable--Negligence\r\n    of treaty-makers in providing no regulations for admission of\r\n    the propaganda--Contrasted with the care bestowed on trade\r\n    regulations--Religious toleration of the Chinese--Christian\r\n    intolerance--Surreptitious article in French Convention of\r\n    1860--Giving large privileges to missionaries in the interior--Its\r\n    abuse complained of by Chinese--Enforced restitution of old\r\n    property--Bitter injustice--Disintegrating action of the\r\n    propaganda--Abuses of extra-territoriality--Interference in\r\n    local affairs--Detaching natives from their allegiance--Causes of\r\n    strife--Chinese Government culpable in permitting abuses--Disputes\r\n    about land and houses--Chinese official laxity compensated\r\n    for by unofficial illegitimate methods--Attacks on missions\r\n    fomented thereby--No remedy possible without the unanimous\r\n    consent of the Powers--Each having different objects--Fruits\r\n    of widespread hostility to missions appeared in 1868--Riot and\r\n    outrage--Culminated in Tientsin massacre of 1870--Details of the\r\n    occurrence--Treated cavalierly by Imperial Government--Culpability\r\n    of officials--Pressure by foreign Ministers induces Chinese\r\n    to execute sixteen criminals--Apologetic mission of Chunghou\r\n    to France--Suspicions of his complicity unfounded--Causes of\r\n    the hostility to foreigners--Government fear of reprisals\r\n    by France--They begin to take the missionary question\r\n    seriously--Issue an important circular--Badly received by the\r\n    Powers.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo subject more seriously engaged the attention of Sir Rutherford Alcock\r\nduring his whole term of service than that of the Christian propaganda.\r\nWhile it was yet in embryo, and long before the untoward consequences now\r\nso familiar had declared themselves, the evil to come formed the theme of\r\nmany anxious despatches. For, with the exception of Mr T. T. Meadows, he\r\nwas the only one of the early consuls who attempted to read the horoscope\r\nof China with a conscious participation in the responsibility for its\r\nwelfare. Their warnings were, of course, wasted on the desert air, for\r\nstatesmen whose hands are on the lever of events are like the signalmen on\r\na busy railway, recking nothing of the origin or destination of the train,\r\ncareful only that it pass their own \"point\" in safety. The thin end of the\r\nentering wedge destined to split China into fragments, unless anticipated\r\n(as in fact it has been) in its disruptive work by some ruder allied\r\nagency, was clearly discerned by Consul Alcock while at Shanghai. Under\r\ncover of the first French treaties in 1844 and 1846 missionaries effected\r\na legal lodgment on the coast of China, from which they cast longing\r\neyes on the vast interior of the country. Rivalry between the Christian\r\nsects brought fresh pressure to bear on the plenipotentiaries, and the\r\n\"toleration clause\" was introduced into all the treaties negotiated at\r\nTientsin in 1858, and in the German treaty of 1861.\r\n\r\nRussia led the way, followed by the United States, Great Britain, and\r\nFrance. The \"clause\" was substantially the same in all, the toleration\r\nof Christianity being based on its moral character exclusively--\"Hommes\r\nde bien qui ne cherchent pas d'avantages matériels\" (Russian); \"Teaching\r\nmen to do good, and to do to others as they would have others do to\r\nthem\" (American); \"Inculcates the practice of virtue, and teaches man\r\nto do as he would be done by\" (English); \"Ayant pour objet essentiel de\r\nporter les hommes à la vertu\" (French).[16] Yet this apparent unanimity\r\nconcealed essential differences in aim and motive. Russia, France, and the\r\nUnited States, to leave England out of the account, each meant something\r\nspecifically distinct from the other by the practically identical clause.\r\n\r\nWhat the Chinese would have said, had they been free to discuss the\r\ndemand made upon them, we can hardly conjecture; but in the position in\r\nwhich they actually found themselves they would have subscribed to any\r\nform of words submitted to them, their sole anxiety then being to get\r\nrid of the barbarians on any terms. Had the preamble run, \"Whereas the\r\nChristian religion as practised for 1800 years has not brought peace but a\r\nsword upon the earth, has set the father against the son, nation against\r\nnation, instigated crimes without number, sided with the oppressor and\r\nthe unrighteous judge, and is daily prostituted for political ends,\"\r\nthe Chinese would have signed the toleration clause just the same. The\r\nphraseology was nothing to them, whence it follows that the responsibility\r\nfor the consequences rests on the Powers who imposed the form as well\r\nas the substance of the obligations. These Powers placed themselves in\r\na self-contradictory position both towards China and the Church, for\r\nthe only ground on which they claimed protection for missionaries in the\r\nframing of the treaty is the one which they cannot so much as consider in\r\nthe fulfilment of it. The ethical and religious side of the propaganda\r\nis to the executive official a negligible quantity, while he can take\r\ncognisance only of that aspect of Christianity which was studiously kept\r\nout of sight in the treaty--its political character, the temper of the\r\nmissionaries and of the people among whom they work, and all that makes\r\nfor good or bad relations between them.\r\n\r\nAmid mixed and perverted motives there is doubtless in all sections of\r\nthe propaganda a residuum of pure zeal in a holy cause. The medieval\r\nsolicitude for \"saving the heathen\" survives, and men and women, fired\r\nwith the conviction that they are engaged in such a godlike enterprise,\r\nconstitute an ever-living force with which statesmen have to lay their\r\naccount. It can neither be reasoned with nor turned aside, and is the more\r\nintractable in that the logical effect of its inspiration is to place\r\nit above civil law, but under a divine law of its own interpreting, the\r\ninterpretation varying indefinitely with the divisions of the force, each\r\ndivision, and sometimes each individual, selecting such portions of the\r\ncode and bending them to such meaning as may support the objects and the\r\nmethods of the sect. To introduce such a complex ferment into the Chinese\r\nbody politic was a psychological experiment on a colossal scale, and also\r\nirrevocable. It was, therefore, an experiment which demanded the kind of\r\nprecaution used in handling dangerous chemicals.\r\n\r\nYet absolutely no thought was bestowed on the subject; the explosive was\r\nimported with less ceremony than is bestowed on a bale of long cloth, and\r\nleft to spread according to its own laws in the living tissue into which\r\nit was injected. So far at least as the English treaty was concerned,\r\nwe have it on the authority of the actual negotiator that the Christian\r\nclause was an after-thought \"shoved in\" at the last moment. The same\r\nauthority adds, \"The treaty was left to carry out itself\"--in other\r\nrespects besides that of the missionary question. Sir Rutherford Alcock\r\nspeaks of \"the futility of grafting on to a treaty of commerce, forced\r\nupon the Chinese under circumstances which left them no power to refuse, a\r\nproselytising agency for the conversion of the nation to Christianity....\r\nWhatever aims at these ends under the stipulation of a treaty of commerce\r\nand amity introduces a cause of distrust and an element of disturbance.\r\nThis we have done, and are now reaping the fruit.\" But a rose-cutting\r\nwould not be grafted with the insouciance with which this spiritual\r\nelement was incongruously inserted in a commercial treaty. Commenting\r\ndirectly upon the toleration clause itself, Sir Rutherford wrote: \"It is\r\nonly necessary to read carefully the words of the article to be aware that\r\nin the whole range of the treaty, from the 1st to the 56th article, there\r\nis nothing stipulated for so difficult to secure as the fulfilment in its\r\nintegrity of this one clause.\"\r\n\r\nThe foreign Powers generally seemed to court the very \"disturbance\"\r\napprehended by \"leaving the treaty to carry out itself,\" washing their\r\nhands of their own careless work. We have seen what pains were taken to\r\nallow the treaty to operate smoothly in its main purpose by elaborating\r\na scheme of trade regulations far more complete than the treaty itself.\r\nBut as foreign trade had been carried on by the Chinese for centuries,\r\nand the merchants of the respective countries were thoroughly at home\r\nwith each other, commerce was the least likely source of friction. Of\r\nthe new dynamic element introduced into the treaties, it seems never to\r\nhave occurred to the negotiators that any regulation was necessary at\r\nall. Missionaries were permitted to enter and settle in the interior,\r\nwhere everything was strange, for practical purposes beyond the orbit\r\nof their countries' laws, while protected against the jurisdiction of\r\nthe Government under which they were to live. Men who could withstand\r\nthe temptation offered by such a state of things are not born every day.\r\nWithout rule of conduct save their individual judgment, with no previous\r\nunderstanding with the Chinese provincial officials as to relative\r\nrights and duties, they were left to find such accommodation to their\r\nsurroundings as their several idiosyncrasies and the untried conditions\r\nof Chinese social life might determine. The missionary in the interior\r\nhad thus all the qualities of a \"foreign body\" setting up irritation in\r\nthe organism,--a state of things, however, which his absolute faith in\r\nthe sanctity of his mission perhaps prevented him from comprehending.\r\n\r\nOne trait in the national character was highly favourable to the\r\nreception of a foreign religion. The Chinese were of all nations the\r\nmost tolerant of opinion. They had already accepted and assimilated two\r\nforeign religions--Buddhism and Mohammedanism; indeed they had also, two\r\nhundred years before, accepted and retained Christianity until it was\r\nexpelled in convulsions provoked by the foreign missionaries themselves.\r\nIts second advent need not have caused convulsions had it come as the\r\nothers had done, with clean hands, as a religion and nothing else. The\r\ntolerance of the Chinese has been referred to materialism and contemptuous\r\napathy, which is by no means an exhaustive account of the matter.\r\nThey were not, any more than Hindus, naked savages without language\r\nor literature: if anything, they were over-civilised. Proud they were,\r\nindeed, and conceited, and in its religious aspect they affected to regard\r\nChristianity as but a wave breaking on a rock. Their rock was a unique\r\nphilosophy, scarcely to be called a system, which stands for religion,\r\ndiffering from other philosophic systems in eschewing speculation and\r\nattending to the ethics of common life,--the only philosophy that may be\r\nsaid ever to have transfused itself into the blood of a people.\r\n\r\nThe culture of the Chinese, however, was merely an obstacle to the\r\nrealisation of the Catholic ideal of saving the heathen, as the grandest\r\nnatural scenery was regarded merely as a hindrance to medieval travel.\r\n\"Unhappy infidels, who spend their lives in smoke and their eternity in\r\nflames,\" was Father le Jeune's epigrammatic summary of the whole case in\r\nQuebec. So deep-rooted is the tradition of the reprobation of the heathen,\r\nthat it generally requires many years' experience before a foreign\r\nmissionary is led by contact with facts to see that Chinese ethics form\r\nthe natural basis for the Christian superstructure. Some missionaries,\r\nindeed, go so far as to use the writings of Confucius as a text-book.\r\nBefore reaching this ripe stage, however, the foreign missionary has it\r\nin his power to do more mischief than he can perhaps ever undo.\r\n\r\nThere was one treaty stipulation which has not been left to chance for its\r\nfulfilment--the additional article inserted in the French Convention of\r\nPeking in 1860. An astute missionary, acting as interpreter to Baron Gros,\r\nmanaged to interpolate in the Chinese text a clause of his own which had\r\nno place in the French--the ruling version--and was quite unknown to the\r\nFrench Envoy.[17] By that clause full permission was accorded to French\r\nmissionaries to purchase land and erect buildings thereon throughout\r\nthe empire; and further, all churches, schools, cemeteries, lands, and\r\nbuildings which had been owned by persecuted Christians (Chinese) in\r\nprevious centuries were to be paid for, and the money handed to the\r\nFrench representative in Peking for transmission to the Christians in\r\nthe localities concerned. This astounding demand, in our eyes at once so\r\ntruculent and so impracticable, seems to have been to the Chinese neither\r\nmore nor less oppressive than the rest of the treaty, and they signed\r\nwithout demur, under the usual mental reservation. But it was in germ an\r\nofficial recognition of a French protectorate over Chinese Christians,\r\nand of corporate communities of Christians held qualified to be served\r\nheirs to those who had been persecuted in the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies--a germ which might be cultivated with greater or less success,\r\naccording to the skill of those who had the care of it. Some effort\r\nof imagination is required in order to realise what is implied in this\r\nsurreptitious article.\r\n\r\n    We must suppose [wrote Sir Rutherford Alcock] a French army\r\n    entering London and there dictating the conditions of peace, and\r\n    among others one that all Church property confiscated by Henry\r\n    VIII. should forthwith be restored to the Roman Catholic Church by\r\n    the present holders, however acquired, and without compensation,\r\n    and that the French Government could be appealed to in order to\r\n    enforce the rigorous execution of the stipulation.\r\n\r\nHow the stipulation was enforced is thus described by Prince Kung in his\r\ncircular of 1871, more fully noticed below:--\r\n\r\n    During the last few years the restitution of chapels in every\r\n    province has been insisted upon without any regard for the feeling\r\n    of the masses, the missionaries obstinately persisting in their\r\n    claims. They have also pointed out fine handsome houses (belonging\r\n    to, or occupied by, the gentry or others) as buildings once used\r\n    as churches, and these they have compelled the people to give up.\r\n    But what is worst, and what wounds the dignity of the people,\r\n    is that they often claim as their property _yamêns_, places of\r\n    assembly, temples held in high respect by the literates and the\r\n    inhabitants of the neighbourhood. Buildings which were once used\r\n    as chapels have been in some cases sold years ago by Christians;\r\n    and, having been sold and resold by one of the people to another,\r\n    have passed through the hands of several proprietors. There is\r\n    also a large number of buildings which have been newly repaired\r\n    at very considerable expense, of which the missionaries have\r\n    insisted on the restitution, refusing at the same time to pay\r\n    anything for them. On the other hand, there are some houses which\r\n    have become dilapidated, and the missionaries put in a claim for\r\n    the necessary repair. Their conduct excites the indignation of\r\n    the people whenever they come in contact with each other, and it\r\n    becomes impossible for them to live quietly together.[18]\r\n\r\nBitter consequences have resulted from the enforced operation of the\r\ninterpolated clause, for the French Government, as is shown above, took\r\nfull advantage of the pious fraud. Neither did the Chinese themselves,\r\non discovering the truth, openly resent this example of how the foreign\r\nreligion \"porte les hommes à la vertu.\" The fraud was more than condoned\r\nby missionaries of all nations and sects, whose legal title to residence\r\nin the interior of China, distant from all authority, rests solely on the\r\ninterpolated French clause, the benefit of which accrues to them under\r\nthe most-favoured-nation privilege. British Protestant missionaries, not\r\naltogether satisfied with this tainted title, in a long letter to their\r\nMinister, Sir Rutherford Alcock, claimed the right of inland residence\r\non another ground. They adduced the public declaration of Mr Burlingame,\r\nthat \"China invites Protestant missionaries to plant the shining Cross on\r\nevery hill and in every valley\"; to which the answer was simple, that the\r\nChinese Government disavowed the promises of the envoy, and repudiated the\r\nimplied obligation. The British Government disapproved of the claim under\r\nthe French treaty, though in rather ambiguous terms, because it rested\r\n\"on no sound foundation, but on an interpolation of words in the Chinese\r\nversion alone in the French treaty with China.\" Since then, however, the\r\npretensions of the French missionaries have been vindicated less by the\r\ninterpolated clause itself than by the vigorous exercise of all the rights\r\nconferred by it, and very much more. The clause thus lent material force\r\nto the spiritual ferment, accelerating by many degrees its disintegrating\r\naction. It may be alleged, in palliation of the light-heartedness with\r\nwhich the whole subject was treated by the negotiators of the treaties,\r\nthat they could not have foreseen such a development of their innocent\r\ntoleration clause; but the circumstance only emphasises the urgent need\r\nthere was for a clear definition of what was really meant by it.\r\n\r\nBut if toleration be the note of Chinese polity--concerning not\r\nreligion alone, but almost every matter affecting government--it may\r\nbe asked, What is it in the propagation of Christianity that excites\r\nthe hostility of people and rulers? It is that the missionaries present\r\nthemselves to Chinese view as the instruments of powerful nations bent\r\non the ruin of the empire. They enter the country with a talisman of\r\nextra-territoriality; their persons are sacred; the law of the land cannot\r\nlay hands on them. That is the first stage. The second is, that they seek\r\nto extra-territorialise their converts also, whose battles they fight\r\nin the provincial courts and in the rustic communes, and so make it of\r\nmaterial advantage to the people to bear the banner of the Cross. Many\r\nmissionaries are really zealous in the work of alienating the Chinese from\r\ntheir natural allegiance, and of encouraging them to seek the protection\r\nof foreign Powers as against the native authorities. Thus a revolution\r\nof the most vital nature is in progress, and is being pushed on with all\r\nthe energy which Christian, combined with ecclesiastical and political,\r\nzeal can throw into the work. Village is set against village, clan against\r\nclan, family against family, and a man's foes in China are too often they\r\nof his own household.[19]\r\n\r\nNo doubt the Chinese Government are to blame for having allowed such a\r\nstate of things to grow up; but it is part and parcel of their drifting\r\nattitude towards everything. It is not that their apprehensions are not\r\naroused, but that they lack initiative to avert the danger which they\r\nfear. While in theory they do not admit the claim of any foreign Power\r\nto protect Chinese subjects, yet in practice the thing goes on, and\r\nis acquiesced in. So formidable, indeed, have the foreign missionaries\r\nbecome, that most of the provincial authorities are afraid as well as\r\njealous of them; and peace-loving viceroys give the simple injunction\r\nto their prefects and magistrates that on no account must they permit\r\ndispute with foreigners or native Christians. This means that the Chinese\r\nChristian must be upheld, right or wrong, and the Christian would be very\r\nun-Chinese if he did not take advantage of such a privilege to trounce\r\nhis heathen neighbours.\r\n\r\nThe right given in the French treaty of acquiring land and building houses\r\nin the interior is one of the most constant causes of local quarrel. Real\r\nestate in China, being held not on personal but on family tenure, can\r\nonly be rightfully alienated by the common consent. A dissentient member\r\nholding out, or reviving his claim for purposes of extortion after assent\r\nhas been given and transfer made, may become a convenient instrument\r\nin the hands of agitators against the foreigners; and where there is no\r\nsuch dissentient it is not unusual for the local authorities to create\r\none by forcible means. A case in point may be mentioned in illustration.\r\nA building was made over to the Baptist Missionary Society by a Chinese\r\nfamily, every precaution being taken to obtain the unanimous consent of\r\nits various branches. When the deed had been signed by the head of the\r\nfamily and other responsible members, the local magistrate examined the\r\nchief of the clan, denounced him, and punished him severely by bastinado.\r\nTwo of the signatories, thus intimidated, disowned their own act, thereby\r\ninvalidating the deed by non-unanimity.\r\n\r\nNearly all the attacks on missionaries proceed in one form or another\r\nfrom that fecund nursery of feuds, the land question. Whatever the merits\r\nof the dispute, the foreigner is _prima facie_ in the wrong; for he is\r\nan alien, an intruder, and he erects buildings which are outlandish,\r\noffensive to taste, and of sinister influence; and whosoever, albeit\r\nthe most disreputable member of a family of three or four generations,\r\nproclaims a grievance by which he has lost his birthright, is sure of\r\na sympathetic following. Thus without taking into account individual\r\nindiscretions, or infirmities of temper, open attacks on time-honoured\r\ncustoms, and so forth, there is a perennial root of bitterness in\r\nmissionary enterprise in the interior of China, which throws out shoots\r\nculminating in murder and fiendish ferocity; and all this without even\r\na distant approach to the kernel of Christianity which lies behind the\r\noutworks.\r\n\r\nFor what the Chinese authorities have failed to do by the legitimate means\r\nat their command, their underlings and the circle of gentry that surrounds\r\neach provincial centre attempt to do by illegitimate and criminal methods.\r\nHatred of missions and converts shows itself by violent outbreaks in\r\nwhich innocent and guilty suffer a common fate; mobs are excited by false\r\nsuggestions, scholars write inflammatory placards filled with the foulest\r\ncalumnies, and the higher officials \"let it work\"--secretly applauding,\r\nbut ready, if called to account, to exculpate themselves and blame the\r\npoor ignorant people.\r\n\r\nThe charges which form the staple of these attacks turn largely upon the\r\nmurder of children in order to make use of eyes, members, blood, &c.,\r\nin certain Christian rites; and they are so extravagant and absurd that\r\nforeigners are apt to doubt that even the most ignorant among the people\r\nreally believe in the crimes which are alleged against Christians. The\r\nbest authorities, however,--as, for example, the late Sir Thomas Wade,--do\r\nnot question the sincerity of the popular belief; and indeed if we compare\r\nthese charges with those made against the Jews by influential sections of\r\nChristians in Europe, we shall be surprised at their practical identity.\r\n\r\nFor this deplorable state of things no one has been able to suggest a\r\nremedy. What has been done cannot be undone. To mend it even would require\r\nsuch united action among the Great Powers as it is hardly possible in\r\nthe present state of the world to conceive. France, indeed, on the morrow\r\nof the Tientsin massacre, did appeal to the co-operative principle as a\r\nprotection to all foreign interests in China. The French ambassador in\r\nLondon addressed the Foreign Office in these terms:--\r\n\r\n    Bien que les victimes de ces attentats soient presque\r\n    exclusivement des Français, on ne saurait contester que des\r\n    faits pareils révèlent l'existence de dangers qui menacent\r\n    indistinctement tous les étrangers résidant en Chine. C'est en\r\n    considérant leurs intérèts comme solidaires dans ces contrées de\r\n    l'extrême Orient que les Puissances européennes peuvent arriver à\r\n    assurer à leurs nationaux les garanties et les sécurités stipulées\r\n    dans les traités.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent action of France in China, however, there has been no\r\ntrace of regard for any such principle of solidarity. Indeed, were the\r\nPowers ever so amicably disposed towards each other on other questions,\r\nthey could not agree in this, the objects of their policy being absolutely\r\nirreconcilable.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot doubt,\" wrote Sir Rutherford Alcock, \"that the missionary\r\nquestion is the main cause of disturbance in our relations with China,\r\nand of danger to the Chinese Government itself no less than to all\r\nforeigners resident in the country, missionaries and laymen alike.\" He\r\nrecommended in 1868 that \"the treaty Powers should, if possible, come\r\nto some understanding on the religious and missionary question as the\r\nnecessary preliminary to any united action for the common benefit, the\r\nacquisition of increased facilities for trade, &c.\" And he says, \"As\r\nregards Chinese converts, any attempt to extend a protectorate over them\r\nwould of necessity either fail or be subversive of the whole government of\r\nChina.\" But in the same paper he states that \"France, with no trade in the\r\nEast, is ambitious of a protectorate over Roman Catholic missions\"; and\r\nthat \"with regard to converts protection has been partially extended to\r\nthem under the ægis of the French Government, and that persistent efforts\r\nwere being made to make that protection effectual.\" These efforts have\r\nbeen still more persistent during the generation that has since passed.\r\nWith France the protectorate over native Christians is the great objective\r\nof her Chinese diplomacy--not the ultimate end, indeed, but the lever\r\nby which that end may be attained. To suggest to France, therefore, the\r\nabandonment of this policy would be about as hopeless as asking her to\r\ngive up her colonies as the preliminary to an international conference.\r\nAnd while France protects the proselytising machinery of the Roman\r\nCatholic Church and its consequent usurpation of the Chinese authority, it\r\nwould seem of little avail to place other missionaries under restriction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fruits of this war of the social elements began to be harvested in\r\n1868, as Sir Rutherford Alcock observed; but that was only the beginning\r\nof a long series of conflicts which have marked the progress of missionary\r\nwork in China up to the present day. Riot, outrage, and massacre are its\r\nregular landmarks. The outbreaks have so much in common that it would\r\nserve no useful purpose to trace them in detail, or attempt to apportion\r\npraise or blame to this or that individual or sect. The one which has\r\nleft the reddest mark on history, and, being enacted in the presence of a\r\nforeign mercantile community, brought the several factors in the question\r\ninto a clearer light than can ever be thrown upon outrages in remote parts\r\nof the interior, is the Tientsin massacre of 21st June 1870. This occurred\r\nsix months after Sir Rutherford Alcock left China, while Mr Wade was\r\n_chargé d'affaires_ for Great Britain, and Count Rochechouart for France,\r\nin Peking.\r\n\r\nThe massacre of sixteen French Sisters of Charity, including an Irish\r\ngirl, Alice Sullivan, a French consul, and several French subjects,\r\nalso--unwittingly, according to the imperial edict treating of the\r\noccurrence--a Russian merchant and his wife, was the work of an organised\r\nband, led by the city fire brigade, under the direction of the civic\r\nauthorities. The crime had been planned for some time: it was preceded\r\nby the murder of an isolated English missionary, Mr Williamson, near\r\nTientsin, and by an attempted anti-foreign rising in Nanking, which\r\nwas promptly suppressed by the viceroy, Ma, who was soon after himself\r\nassassinated. (He was a Mohammedan.) The impending outrage in Tientsin\r\nwas foreseen, and warning given, several days before. An Englishman was\r\nattacked on the 19th for no reason. The official highest in rank on the\r\nspot--not, however, a territorial authority--was Chunghou, a Manchu,\r\nholding the office of Imperial Commissioner for Trade, and very friendly\r\nto foreigners. Admiral Keppel says of him that he was the most finished\r\nChinese gentleman he had ever met, with the exception of the viceroy of\r\nCanton (probably meaning Kiying). The governor of the province was Tsêng\r\nKwo-fan, whose capital was Paoting-fu, some 100 miles in the interior;\r\nand his subordinates, the prefect and magistrate, were the authorities at\r\nTientsin immediately responsible for the massacre. Chunghou had warned the\r\nPeking Government several weeks before of the progress of the agitation\r\nagainst the French mission.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Government immediately on the occurrence issued an edict\r\ndescribing the massacre as \"a quarrel between the people and the\r\nmissionaries resulting in a fight,\" but were promptly driven from that\r\nposition and pressed, not only by the French, but by all the foreign\r\nrepresentatives, to investigate and do justice in the case, Count\r\nRochechouart demanding the capital punishment of the three mandarins\r\nwho had instigated the massacre. On this the Chinese Government\r\nremarked in a secret edict, \"Rochechouart, with boundless arrogance,\r\ndemands the execution of the Fu and Hsien, a demand ten thousand times\r\nto be rejected.\" Under pressure, however, the Government ordered the\r\ngovernor-general, Tsêng, to proceed to the spot and investigate. After\r\na protracted journey he reached Tientsin and commenced to take evidence,\r\nnot of the crime committed, but of the suspicions which had been excited\r\nagainst the Sisters of Mercy, whom, after ransacking their cemeteries\r\nfor mutilated children, he eventually acquitted. He then suspended the\r\nmagistrates _pro formâ_, and spoke of sending for troops to catch the\r\nrioters! On receiving the viceroy's report another imperial decree was\r\nissued repeating the original falsehoods, and causing much disappointment\r\nto the foreign Ministers. Renewed pressure from them, not without hints\r\nof stronger measures, resulted in the offer of fifteen of the mob to be\r\nexecuted, which, being unanimously rejected, the Chinese Government,\r\napparently thinking it was the number that was inadequate, threw in\r\nfive more, making twenty in all. Sixteen were actually beheaded, the\r\nremaining four being saved by the timely arrival of the Russian Minister,\r\nwho protested against the execution of the men accused of murdering the\r\nRussians, because he did not believe in their guilt. Compensation was paid\r\nby the Chinese officials to the families of the executed men, which, with\r\nthe honours done to their dead bodies, showed that they were sacrificed\r\nnot for crime, but for reasons of State. Of course pecuniary compensation\r\nwas made on account of the victims of the massacre, the Chinese Government\r\nbeing never hard to deal with where money is concerned. The prefect and\r\nthe magistrate who had busied themselves after the tragedy in torturing\r\nChristians, in order to extort from them confessions which would justify\r\nthe massacre, were nominally banished, though it was perfectly understood\r\nthat this was a pure matter of form.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: RUINS OF FRENCH CATHEDRAL AT TIENTSIN, BURNED JUNE 20,\r\n   1870.]\r\n\r\nAs part of the reparation for the massacre the Imperial Commissioner for\r\nNorthern Trade, Chunghou, was despatched in the early part of 1871 on\r\na mission to France to express the regret of the Chinese Government for\r\nwhat had occurred. This official, the first man of rank who was ever sent\r\nout of China, received but an indifferent reception from the President of\r\nthe French Republic. Being the highest authority in Tientsin at the time\r\nof the massacre, and having known of the preparations for an outbreak\r\nof some kind, Chunghou was severely blamed by Europeans on the coast of\r\nChina, who alleged that the massacre could have been prevented had he put\r\nforth his authority. Meetings were even held on the subject in Shanghai,\r\nand remonstrances were sent to Europe against Chunghou's being received\r\nanywhere as an ambassador until he should exonerate himself from all share\r\nin the Tientsin atrocity. These representations, no doubt, had something\r\nto do with the attitude of the French Provisional Government, which, on\r\nother grounds also, was probably little disposed in that year to occupy\r\nitself with the affairs either of the Church or of China.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe, however, that Chunghou's conduct during the\r\naffair of Tientsin was not inconsistent with innocence; for although he\r\nwas a man in authority, it was only as superintendent of trade, having\r\nno control whatever over the hierarchy of territorial officials, who\r\nwere under the orders of the viceroy, Tsêng Kwo-fan. Beyond his personal\r\nattendants it is not probable that Chunghou could move a corporal's guard\r\nin Tientsin, and his position was such that the local authorities and\r\ntheir myrmidons looked with the keenest jealousy on any departure of the\r\nsuperintendent of trade from the strict line of his own functions. He\r\ndared not, in fact, move a finger against officers who owed allegiance\r\nto the viceroy, and in apprising the Peking Government of the rumours\r\nwhich were current, Chunghou probably considered that he had gone as\r\nfar as public duty warranted. These somewhat anomalous relations between\r\ntwo high dignitaries of the empire were put an end to when Li Hung-chang\r\nsucceeded Tsêng Kwo-fan as viceroy of Chihli; for he was appointed also\r\nthe successor of Chunghou as superintendent of trade, and resided for the\r\nmost part of his time in the commercial port, Tientsin. The two offices\r\ncontinue to be combined in one person.\r\n\r\nMost of the typical features of a missionary outrage were in this case\r\nexemplified--ferocious placards and brochures, circulation of calumnies\r\nagainst the missionaries, guilt of the local authorities, their immunity\r\nfrom punishment, and the official publication of travestied versions of\r\nthe occurrence. There was also, we may add, a lurking disposition on the\r\npart of foreign Governments to give credit to the Chinese charges against\r\nthe missionaries. Finding themselves unable by pressure on the Chinese\r\nto obtain satisfaction for past or security against future outrages, they\r\nwere seldom indisposed to cover their impotence by throwing the blame on\r\ntheir own people.\r\n\r\nThere was, consequently, readiness in certain foreign official quarters\r\nto dwell on undefined \"indiscretions.\" It was too easily assumed in the\r\nbeginning that the practice of the Sisters of Charity of purchasing\r\ndestitute children reasonably excited the suspicions of the people.\r\nAs a matter of fact, however, as was admitted afterwards, this alleged\r\npractice of the Sisters was entirely imaginary. It was also assumed that\r\nthe massacre was a spontaneous act of the populace, who believed the\r\nstories of kidnapping. But in view of the fact that these agitations arose\r\nsimultaneously in distant parts of the empire, this theory of sporadic\r\naction could not be sustained: besides, as Tsêng Kwo-fan himself shrewdly\r\nenough pointed out, no child had been missed from any family at Tientsin,\r\nand the idea of a disciplined fire brigade and a great city mob being\r\nsuddenly roused to fury by the abstract idea that somewhere children had\r\nbeen kidnapped by somebody is too altruistic for ordinary belief. The mob\r\nneeded an instigator, and the instigator was well known.\r\n\r\nIn the diplomatic correspondence which ensued, admitted on all hands to\r\nbe most unsatisfactory, the British _chargé d'affaires_ had occasion to\r\ncomplain to Prince Kung that in the communications that passed foreign\r\nMinisters and their Governments were spoken of as vassals, which, coming\r\ntwo years after Mr Wade's warm support of the Burlingame mission, was\r\ninstructive as regards the progress in liberal ideas which had been\r\nclaimed for the Chinese.\r\n\r\nAnother consequence of this affair may be noted. The instructions to\r\nBritish naval officers in China, which had been dictated by Mr Burlingame\r\nin 1869, were virtually reversed after the Tientsin massacre.\r\n\r\nIt was the general belief at the time that, literally by the fortune\r\nof war, the Chinese Government narrowly escaped a signal retribution\r\nfor its continued guerilla warfare against foreigners as represented by\r\nthe missionary vanguard. Information travelled slowly then. The nearest\r\ntelegraph stations to Peking were Kiachta on the Russian frontier and\r\nColombo, and there was only periodical communication with either, so that\r\nit happened that the official news of the massacre reached the British\r\nForeign Office on July 25th. If we recall what was transpiring in the\r\ncapitals of Europe during that month of July 1870, we may permit ourselves\r\nthe speculation that events might have taken quite another turn had the\r\nnews from China reached the Tuileries a month earlier than it did. The\r\nChinese Government themselves were strongly imbued with this idea. In\r\nan interesting interview which Consul Adkins had with Li Hung-chang in\r\nOctober, after he had succeeded to the viceroyalty of Chihli, in which the\r\nincident was discussed, the viceroy could not conceal his anxiety. The\r\npith of a Chinese interview usually lies, like that of a lady's letter,\r\nin the postscript, and as Mr Adkins was taking leave the governor-general\r\nasked him, \"Do you think France will make war next year?\" (It is worth\r\nnoting that in his report of the interview Mr Adkins expressed himself\r\n\"reassured by the governor-general's tone and manner.\" \"I take for\r\ngranted,\" he wrote, \"that he will not tolerate any outrage on foreigners\r\nwithin his jurisdiction;\" and this forecast of Mr Adkins has, we believe,\r\nbeen completely borne out by the event.)\r\n\r\nBut although the Chinese had escaped a great peril, they were somewhat\r\nshaken in their sense of security for the future. The attacks on\r\nmissionaries had no doubt gone further than was altogether safe, since\r\nthe indignation of the foreign Powers had been roused almost to the pitch\r\nof war. The provincial authorities having had their own way so long,\r\nthreatened to be too strong for the Central Government, and were likely\r\nto embroil them with foreign nations; while in their turn the \"literati\r\nand gentry,\" unemployed officials and the leaders of disorder in the great\r\nprovincial cities, were also becoming too demonstrative for the provincial\r\nrulers. It was clear to the authorities that they were face to face with\r\na dangerous situation, and, contrary to their traditional practice, they\r\nbegan to devise measures in order to meet it. The missionary, they now\r\nsaw, was with them for good, the hope of expelling him by intimidation\r\nmust be relegated to fanatics of the non-practical school, and it would be\r\nimbecile to shut their eyes any longer to facts. No doubt they had allowed\r\nthings to go too far in the admission of foreigners into the interior,\r\ntrusting to the resourcefulness of the provinces in insidious means of\r\nrepression, but to retrace their steps was now impossible. They could no\r\nlonger hope to expel the missionary, but they would contrive some means to\r\nmitigate the dangers of his presence. They would, in short, endeavour to\r\nsupply, in concert with the treaty Powers, that culpable omission in the\r\ntreaties by henceforth regulating the missions and defining their rights\r\nand obligations.\r\n\r\nThe result of these cogitations was an elaborate scheme for the control\r\nof missions which was published in the summer of 1871, and was addressed\r\nto the French Government, and by them communicated to the others. That the\r\nChinese Ministers of themselves took so unprecedented an initiative it is\r\nnot necessary to believe. The circular was attributed to that greatest of\r\nall Chinese statesmen, Wênsiang, but the unseen hand that has done so much\r\nto assist China out of her international difficulties may easily be traced\r\nin this notable State Paper. In the preamble the case is stated much as\r\nwe have endeavoured to set it forth: \"Trade has in no degree occasioned\r\ndifferences between China and the Powers. The same cannot be said of the\r\nmissions, which engender ever-increasing abuses. Although in the first\r\ninstance it may have been declared that the primary object of the missions\r\nwas to exhort men to virtue, Catholicism, in causing vexation to the\r\npeople, has produced a contrary effect in China.\" The circular submitted\r\neight rules for the government of missionary relations with the people and\r\nofficials in the provinces. The rules referred to (1) the management of\r\norphanages, which it was proposed either to close altogether or to place\r\nunder severe restrictions; (2) the mixed attendance of women and men at\r\npublic worship, which, being contrary to Chinese propriety, scandalised\r\nthe people; (3) the legal status of missionaries in the interior, and the\r\nevil consequences of the _imperia in imperio_ which had resulted through\r\nthe missionaries' separating themselves, and even their native converts,\r\nfrom the jurisdiction of the local authorities; (4) the restriction of\r\nproceedings in the case of riots to the persons actively participating\r\nin the same; (5) the clear definition of passports, so that missionaries\r\nshould not be able to move about at will, leaving no trace; (6) the need\r\nof strict examination into the character and antecedents of converts;\r\n(7) the etiquette to be observed by missionaries in intercourse with\r\nofficials, the missionaries not to arrogate official style; and (8) the\r\nreclamation of alleged sites of ancient churches to be stopped, great\r\ninjustice having been done to Chinese through their being obliged to\r\nsurrender properties which they had honestly bought and paid for.\r\n\r\nMany things have happened since 1871, and each transaction with foreigners\r\nhas involved greater and greater encroachment on the Chinese prerogatives.\r\nThus the objection taken in 1871 to the missionaries' arrogating official\r\nstyle has now been so completely waived that the Chinese Government\r\nitself bestows official rank on missionaries, and has sanctioned a rule\r\nof etiquette for their intercourse with the high Chinese authorities.\r\nThus \"bishops are authorised to demand to see viceroys and governors of\r\nprovinces; vicars-general and archdeacons are authorised to demand to see\r\nprovincial treasurers, judges, and taotais; other priests are authorised\r\nto demand to see prefects of the first and second class, independent\r\nprefects, sub-prefects, and other functionaries. The various orders\r\nof ecclesiastics are to visit and write to the corresponding orders of\r\nChinese officials on terms of equality, and these officials will naturally\r\nrespond, according to their rank, with the same courtesies.\"[20]\r\n\r\nThis famous circular of 1871 unfortunately perished at its birth: it was\r\nroughly attacked in the foreign press, and met with a very cold reception\r\nby the Foreign Offices. The English and American Governments seemed\r\nsatisfied with the reflection that the strictures on missionary practices\r\napplied specially to Catholics, and pleased to be able on that account to\r\ndismiss it from consideration. From that day to this the evils complained\r\nof have gone on increasing and accumulating year by year, outrages and\r\nmassacres following each other without interruption, and the exacerbation\r\nof feeling between foreign missionaries and the Chinese population going\r\non with accelerated speed. The political results to China have assumed\r\nin these later years the very concrete form of territorial spoliation,\r\nand the Chinese have had abundant experience of the religion which makes\r\nnations strong and the people virtuous. That is not to say, however,\r\nthat there is not good seed already germinating under the snow, which may\r\nhereafter bear the peaceable fruits of righteousness. Meanwhile the naked\r\nunregulated forces are in open conflict, and he would be a bold prophet\r\nwho should forecast the issue.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [16] Germany in her treaty made no profession, but simply stipulated\r\n    for toleration.\r\n\r\n [17] M. Eugene Simon, one of the most distinguished of the French\r\n    consuls in China, in his book, 'La Cité Chinoise,' awards the\r\n    credit of this performance to M. Delamarre, \"un prêtre des\r\n    Missions étrangères,\" who acted as Baron Gros' interpreter.\r\n    \"Je tiens,\" says M. Simon, \"le fait de plusieurs sources, et\r\n    entre autres de M. Delamarre, qui se glorifait beaucoup de sa\r\n    supercherie.\"\r\n\r\n [18] Compare \"Jesuits' Estates Act\" in Canada, 1890, for which Mr\r\n    Mercier was decorated by the Pope.\r\n\r\n [19] It will be understood that a concise view of the general\r\n    mission question is all that is here aimed at, no distinction\r\n    being drawn between branches of the propaganda. Important as\r\n    are their differences viewed from the foreign standpoint, they\r\n    are practically ignored by the Chinese, as we see from the\r\n    impartiality with which they visit resentment on all. Our concern\r\n    is with the impression produced by the propaganda as a whole,\r\n    gathered as far as possible from Chinese evidence and not from\r\n    the hypothetical arguments of foreign disputants. In other words,\r\n    it is the political bearing of the movement which alone we are\r\n    endeavouring to illustrate.\r\n\r\n [20] This measure was intended by the Chinese Government to\r\n    facilitate the local settlement of disputes where the facts\r\n    were known, and so obviate incessant appeals to the Central\r\n    Government. It has not fulfilled its purpose, partly because an\r\n    important section of the propaganda declined to avail itself of\r\n    the concession offered to them. Indeed the form of the concession\r\n    implies a hierarchy which only Catholic missions possess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE EXPANSION OF INTERCOURSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. RUSSIA AND FRANCE ADVANCING.\r\n\r\n    Influx of treaty Powers--Diversion of Chinese foreign policy into\r\n    new channels--Aggrandisement of Russia--And France--At the expense\r\n    of China--Affecting whole policy of China for thirty years--The\r\n    rise of German influence--And Japanese.\r\n\r\nUp to this stage the foreign relations of China have been traced from\r\nwhat is practically a single point of view--the English--without sensible\r\ndistortion of their true proportions. But the events of 1857-60, and\r\nthe treaties by which they were crowned, introduced new factors and a\r\nwider ramification of international connections. The arms of England\r\nand France opened the door to an influx of Powers eager to reap where\r\nthey had not sown; and though the full effect was not realised till many\r\nyears later, the shifting of foreign intercourse from an essentially\r\nAnglo-Chinese to a Sino-cosmopolitan basis became a potential reality\r\non the day that Peking surrendered to the Allies. Foreseeing such a\r\nresult, the negotiators of the treaties of 1858 advisedly refrained from\r\npressing the Chinese Government more than was essential to the freedom\r\nof commerce, on the ground that other Powers less restrained than the\r\nauthors of the treaties by a sense of moral responsibility might take\r\nundue advantage of concessions extorted from the vanquished. This\r\nprevision has been borne out by events, for the original \"three treaty\r\nPowers\" soon became thirteen, and the old solicitude for the conservation\r\nof China was gradually discovered to be confined to the small minority\r\nwho had a substantial commercial stake in the country. With the increase\r\nin their number there naturally also appeared diversity of interest,\r\nscarce perceptible in the beginning, but ever widening with the progress\r\nof events until at length a stage of violent antagonism in the policy of\r\nthe Powers was reached. The division among their enemies, which Chinese\r\nstatesmen have deplored their inability to compass, has thus been brought\r\nabout without their aid; but so far from realising the Chinese dream of\r\nruling the barbarians, the division has only exposed the empire to the\r\nravages of rival spoilers.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to do more than glance at the several channels into\r\nwhich the foreign relations of China have branched off since 1860. Yet\r\nthey intersect each other at so many points as to form a network which\r\ncan only be intelligently considered as a whole. The quasi-biographical\r\nform of the present work may be appropriately dropped, so far as China\r\nis concerned, with the beginning of 1870, when the more immediate subject\r\nof it disappears from the stage of action to reappear as a perspicacious\r\ncritic surveying the scene from a distant but commanding standpoint.\r\n\r\nTwo developments of far-reaching importance found their proximate\r\nstarting-point, though not their origin, in the crisis which laid China\r\nprostrate in 1858 and 1860. These were the extension of the Russian empire\r\nto the Pacific Ocean, and the creation of that Asiatic empire which had\r\nbeen the dream of France for two centuries. China being by these vast\r\nterritorial aggressions placed between the upper and the nether millstone,\r\nthe anticipated advance of the two Powers has exerted an influence on her\r\ndestiny scarcely less potent than the Japanese war itself, with which it\r\nso effectively co-operated. The soldier-statesmen of Russia foreseeing,\r\nwhat the war of 1854-55 was soon to demonstrate, that the sea route\r\nto their Pacific possessions was at the mercy of the maritime Powers,\r\nresolved to make a dash for a line of communication by land, and in\r\npursuance of this adventurous conception forced their way down the Amur\r\nin spite of the feeble remonstrance of the Chinese wardens of the marches.\r\nWhat was thus taken by the strong hand in 1854 was formally ceded in 1858,\r\nwhen, first, the Amur province, with the free navigation of the river,\r\nand, next, an undefined condominium in the Usuri province, were granted\r\nby treaty to Russia. This was but a step towards the absolute cession, two\r\nyears later, of that territory, including the whole Manchurian sea-coast,\r\n600 miles in length. These extensive cessions, giving Russia the command\r\nof North-Eastern Asia, were extorted from China while _in extremis_ as a\r\ndirect result of the Anglo-French victories.\r\n\r\nSo with the French establishment in the south-eastern section of the\r\nContinent. The expedition sent to the Far East in conjunction with that\r\nof Great Britain was, on completion of its work in China, withdrawn to\r\nCochin-China, and, in an alliance of brief duration with Spain, invaded\r\nthat dependency of the empire of Annam--a vassal of China--and captured\r\nSaigon. The Spanish partnership being thereupon dissolved, the French\r\nempire of \"Indo-China\" was inaugurated with a free hand. Zeal for religion\r\nwas the motive of the invasion: \"The emperor wished to put a stop to\r\nthe constantly recurring persecutions of Christians in Cochin-China, and\r\nto secure them the efficacious protection of France.\" The record of the\r\nphenomenal progress of the new French empire since the treaty of Saigon\r\nin 1862 has been related by many eloquent pens. M. F. Garnier, the heroic\r\nexplorer; M. de Carné, his colleague; M. Lanier, M. Deschamps, M. de\r\nLanessan, and a host of enthusiastic French writers, have depicted in\r\nglowing terms not only the process, but the motives and aspirations, of\r\nthe French \"empire-builders.\"[21]\r\n\r\nThe pressure, latent and active, of these two powerful neighbours has\r\ngiven its tone to the policy of China during thirty years, and in such a\r\nway that her relations with the commercial nations who did not menace her\r\nintegrity have been relegated to a secondary place.\r\n\r\nThe new German influence in the Far East, which had its modest beginnings\r\nin the treaties so reluctantly concluded by the Japanese and Chinese in\r\n1861, has grown in importance _pari passu_ with the rapid development of\r\nthe German empire itself, ably seconded, it must always be allowed, by the\r\npersonal qualities of the Ministers who have been successively chosen to\r\nrepresent the Fatherland at Peking and Tokio. The first resident Minister\r\nto China was Baron Rehfues, who opened the Legation in Peking in 1866,\r\nunder the treaty of 1861.\r\n\r\nAnother nation destined to play a leading _rôle_ among the Powers in the\r\nWestern Pacific was during the same period rising like the sun in the\r\neastern sky. Nor was it very long before the nascent Power of Japan began\r\nto make its weight felt in the conflicts and concerts of the Far Eastern\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that under these various influences operating from without,\r\nand the reflex action set up within the State itself, the character\r\nof China as a political and diplomatic entity could not any longer\r\nbe what it had been in the years before the war. What had been simple\r\nbecame complex; no international issue could be raised in an isolated\r\nform; nor could China make any move, whether voluntary or involuntary,\r\nwithout facing the critical observation of many interested parties.\r\nThis multiple responsibility to Powers by no means at one in their aims,\r\nand each assuming over her a status of superiority, could have no other\r\neffect than to reduce to nullity any efforts China might make either to\r\nimprove herself or please the Powers. It was impossible to please them\r\nall. Decades before the Japanese war, more than one of them had offered\r\nher armed assistance in thwarting the designs of a third,--which things\r\nChinese statesmen pondered in silence.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. JAPAN AGGRESSIVE.\r\n\r\n    Extraordinary progress of Japan--Nation becomes restless--Invades\r\n    Formosa--Bought off by China.\r\n\r\nThe civil war in Japan had been fought with characteristic energy during\r\nthree years, when a revolution, the like of which was never before seen,\r\nestablished the new empire on the double foundations of hereditary\r\nmonarchy and popular suffrage. The effect of the revolution was to\r\nconcentrate the whole strength of the State under the government of the\r\nMikado, and thus enable it to give free play to the widest ambitions. With\r\nincredible rapidity the nation made itself efficient for every enterprise\r\nof peace or war. The best that the Western world had to teach was eagerly\r\nappropriated by a people just aroused from a long sleep, and anxious to\r\nmake up lost time. They went so fast, indeed, that onlookers shook their\r\nheads, and their best friends would have applied the brake had it been\r\npossible. But the nation was self-reliant, and in its first adolescence\r\nit began to be aggressive.\r\n\r\nWithin six years of the revolution of 1868 an expedition was sent to\r\ninvade the Chinese island of Formosa. Through the good offices of Sir\r\nThomas Wade, British Minister in Peking, war between the two empires was\r\naverted, and the Japanese forces withdrawn. They were virtually bought\r\noff, a proceeding characterised by Sir H. Parkes as pusillanimous on\r\nthe part of the empire of China. The transaction really sealed the fate\r\nof China, in advertising to the world that here was a rich empire which\r\nwas ready to pay, but not ready to fight. The euphemisms under which\r\nthe ransom was disguised deceived no one unless it were the Chinese\r\nthemselves. The vast cessions to Russia, incredible as they appeared, had\r\nat least the palliation of a dire emergency, and verbal equivalents in\r\nthe shape of promises of deliverance therefrom. The submission to Japan,\r\non the other hand, was made in a time of comparative ease.\r\n\r\nThe incident had yet a further significance. The pretext of the Japanese\r\ninvasion was injuries done to shipwrecked Liuchiuans, a people whom China\r\ntill then and for some years later considered her own vassals, and who\r\nhad for centuries paid her regular tribute. Such an episode was therefore\r\na sure mark of imperial decadence;--a definite step, moreover, in the\r\ndownward process, to be followed not long after by the Japanese boldly\r\nasserting a claim to the Liuchiu Islands, against which China could only\r\ninterpose an inarticulate protest. The meaning of these indications was\r\nnot likely to be lost either on the Japanese, who were more immediately\r\nconcerned, or on other less interested onlookers. And what has the\r\nsubsequent history of China been but a development of the symptoms?\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. KOREA OPENED.\r\n\r\n    Japan concludes commercial treaty with Korea--Establishes working\r\n    relations--Exciting jealousy in China--The suzerain--China replies\r\n    by opening Korea to the whole world.\r\n\r\nThe expanding life of Japan was soon to overflow in another direction.\r\nThe kingdom of Korea lay within twelve hours' steaming from the Japanese\r\ncoast: it had a historic and a mythical interest for Japan; it had been\r\nthe source of her culture as well as the scene of her conquests and\r\nultimate defeat. With the exception of piratical raids on the coast towns\r\nof China, Korea was the only foreign field into which Japanese arms had\r\nbeen carried, and the prowess of their peninsular heroes was cherished\r\nas a sacred treasure by a people singularly tenacious of their heroic\r\nlegends. After an interval of three centuries the new Japan directed its\r\nambition to the scene of its medieval exploits; and the \"hermit kingdom\"\r\nwas at last dragged from its seclusion and forced to play an unwilling\r\npart in the international game. The modern spirit had tempered the\r\nmilitary passion, commerce and industry supplied the ballast to adventure,\r\nand instead of landing an army of 200,000 men, as they had done in 1592,\r\nthe Japanese, in 1876, re-established themselves in the peninsula through\r\nthe peaceable agency of a treaty of amity and commerce--a weapon newly\r\nborrowed from the armoury of Europe. This movement of the Japanese was by\r\nno means intended to \"open\" Korea--except to themselves. On the contrary,\r\nit appears that that very astute people ingratiated themselves with\r\nthe king's Government by aiding, or professing to aid, them to keep the\r\ncountry closed to all other nations.\r\n\r\nBut, like every other attempt to isolate an international question, the\r\nexclusive effort of the Japanese not only failed, but resulted in opening\r\nKorea instead of closing it. They could not lock themselves in: the key\r\nwas on the outside of the door. Although they disguised their feelings,\r\nthe Chinese authorities had been gravely disturbed by the attacks of the\r\nFrench and the Americans on Korea in 1867 and 1871. The audacious advance\r\nof the Japanese aroused them to the extent of considering the merits of a\r\ncounter-move; for Korea was the secular battle-ground between China and\r\nJapan, the historic stepping-stone between the two countries. And Korea\r\nwas a vassal to China, if ever one State did occupy such a relation to\r\nanother. By old tradition, by effective conquest, by solemn engagement,\r\nby regular tributary missions, by the prerogative of investiture, by\r\nthe obeisance of the sovereign before the Chinese envoys sent on great\r\noccasions, by every kind of acknowledgment which the servant could render\r\nto the master, was the suzerainty of China established.\r\n\r\nChina's relations to her tributaries was perhaps the best feature in\r\nher imperial character. There was protection, nominal or real, but never\r\na shadow of domination. The ceremonial once settled, the most complete\r\nindependence was accorded to the vassal State, the imperial object being\r\nnever oppression or exploitation, but the girdling of the empire with a\r\ncordon of contented States looking with filial eyes towards the Dragon\r\nthrone. Of these filial States Korea was the most important, on account\r\nof its geographical position as commanding one of the main approaches\r\nto the Middle Kingdom, or, as the king himself once expressed it in a\r\nmemorial to the emperor, as \"the lips protecting the teeth.\" For China the\r\nKorean peninsula has been a strategical stronghold, but its importance was\r\nincreased a hundredfold when the statesmen of Peking came to realise what\r\nthey had done in giving away the whole Manchurian sea-coast, leaving them\r\nno outlet to the Sea of Japan excepting through Korea, which, moreover,\r\nwas studded all round with excellent harbours, useful to friends and\r\ntempting to enemies.\r\n\r\nThe wise policy which the emperors had observed towards their tributaries\r\nhad borne valuable fruit in Korea. For two hundred years the Peking\r\nGovernment had dealt so benignly with king and people as to have inspired\r\nfeelings of genuine affection combined with deep reverence for the \"big\r\ncountry.\" Whether collectively or individually, officially or privately,\r\nthe Chinese were warmly welcomed everywhere without ever abusing the\r\ncourtesy of their hosts--in marked contrast, it must be observed, to\r\nthe Japanese, whose record in Korea has been one of unbroken brutality,\r\nproducing a general feeling of aversion.\r\n\r\nIf anything, therefore, could excite the jealousy of Chinese statesmen, it\r\nwould be to see this filial dependency being tampered with by strangers,\r\nmore especially by their hereditary foes, the Japanese. Better all the\r\nworld in Korea with Japan excluded, than Japan in with the rest of the\r\nworld kept out. Slow of apprehension, and still slower of action, her\r\nunpractical conservatism in high places reducible only by sap and mine,\r\nChina brooded over the Korean problem for some years before any result\r\nof the incubation appeared. The conclusion eventually arrived at was to\r\nneutralise the Japanese action by opening Korea to the whole world under\r\ntreaty. The realisation of this scheme was as usual placed in the hands of\r\nLi Hung-chang, who on the one hand recommended the Korean king to conclude\r\ncommercial treaties with foreign Powers, and on the other encouraged the\r\nlatter to open negotiations. Hence the general opening of the country in\r\n1882, with its train of tragic consequences.\r\n\r\nThe terms of the foreign treaties with Korea had not been thoroughly\r\nthought out, and the very ambiguity was perpetuated which it was the\r\ninterest of China to clear away. The treaties purported to be made with an\r\nindependent State, whereas Korea was a vassal, and the inconsistency was\r\nattempted to be remedied by a separate letter from the king to the Powers\r\nwith whom he had concluded treaties, declaring, notwithstanding, that the\r\nChinese emperor was his suzerain.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE FIRST IMPERIAL AUDIENCE--SUCCESSION OF KWANGHSU.\r\n\r\n    End of the minority of Emperor Tungchih--Audience of the foreign\r\n    Ministers in 1873--Under derogatory conditions--Death of the\r\n    young emperor--Empress regent's _coup d'état_ in selecting\r\n    successor--Her own nephew--Eighteen years' minority of Emperor\r\n    Kwanghsu.\r\n\r\nAn event looked forward to for twelve long years with patient expectation,\r\nand with hope, lively at the beginning but fading away towards the end\r\nof the period, that it would prove the sovereign remedy for the defects\r\nof Chinese intercourse with the world, was the assumption of power by\r\nthe young emperor, who attained his majority in 1873. The diplomatic\r\nbody busied themselves greatly in preparations for their first audiences\r\nwith the sovereign to whom they were accredited. The Chinese on their\r\npart were no less anxiously engaged in devising means of lightening\r\nthe blow to their prestige in consenting to receive foreigners at all,\r\nwhile dispensing with the prescribed prostrations. Obliged to yield the\r\nmain point, the Court officials minimised its significance by imposing\r\nsundry derogatory conditions as to the building in which the audience\r\nwas to be granted, and by the terms in which it was referred to in the\r\nimperial decree, which represented the foreign Ministers as \"imploring an\r\naudience,\" and by other like devices.\r\n\r\nThe first to be admitted to the presence was the representative of Japan,\r\nwho held the rank of ambassador. Next came the resident Ministers of\r\nRussia, the United States, Great Britain, France, and Holland, in a body;\r\nand lastly, the French Minister separately, in order to convey the reply\r\nof his Government to the mission of Chunghou respecting the Tientsin\r\nmassacre of 1870. The several letters of credence were placed on a table.\r\nThe emperor \"seemed to be speaking\" to Prince Kung, though no sound was\r\nheard. The prince in his turn addressed a few words to the five Ministers,\r\nin Chinese, purporting to be what the emperor had spoken in Manchu, and\r\nthe audience was at an end, the whole ceremony lasting about five minutes.\r\n\r\nBy long anticipation a superstitious halo had formed round the abstract\r\nquestion of audience: it grew into a kind of fetish. Mr Lay shrewdly\r\nobserved that the object of the \"resident Minister\" clause in the\r\ntreaties had been misunderstood by foreigners in being regarded by them\r\nas an end instead of only a means. Mr Wade, who was British Minister at\r\nthe time, made no such mistake; for though he consistently laid stress\r\non ceremonial, it was, as he has frequently explained, because with\r\nthe Chinese form was more than substance, and included it. A proper\r\nregulation of official etiquette was in his estimation the principal key\r\nto the remedy of material wrongs. From this point of view a five minutes'\r\naudience of the Son of Heaven, even in dumb show and once a-year, was a\r\nstep of real importance. \"The empire,\" wrote Mr Wade, \"has for the first\r\ntime in its history broken with the tradition of isolated supremacy--not,\r\nit may be, with a good grace, but still past recall; and while I would\r\nanxiously deprecate a too sanguine estimate of its results, I am as little\r\ndisposed to undervalue the change that has been effected.\"\r\n\r\nBut whatever hopes of a practical kind were raised by this ceremonial\r\ninnovation were doomed to speedy extinction, for the emperor did not\r\nsurvive to grant a second reception. He died within the year, and was\r\nsucceeded by another infant, involving a second minority much longer than\r\nthe preceding one. Eighteen years, in fact, elapsed between the first\r\nimperial audience and the second.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Tungchih, though but eighteen years of age, left a legend\r\nbehind him. The gossip of the capital assigned to him considerable\r\nindependence of character, and a certain audacity in breaking bounds\r\nwithout the discreet chaperonage enjoyed by the Prince Siddhârtha in his\r\nexplorations beyond the palace precincts of King Suddhôdana. He was,\r\nif common report belied him not, a true son of his mother in certain\r\nrespects, though of her masterful statecraft, and the qualities which\r\nbecome a great monarch, he was too young to have given proofs. Leaving\r\nno heir, the deficiency was promptly supplied by the resourcefulness of\r\nthe empress-mother. As the widow of the Emperor Hsienfêng and co-regent,\r\nshe adopted a posthumous heir to that monarch to replace his own son.\r\nHer choice fell on the infant son of Prince Ch'un, the youngest brother\r\nof Hsienfêng. The mother of the adopted child was the empress-regent's\r\nown sister, and by thus enthroning her nephew the regent assured herself\r\nanother long lease of power. The proceeding was irregular, there being two\r\nolder brothers of Prince Ch'un alive and having sons. The nearest heir\r\nwas the infant grandson of Prince Tun, the fifth son of Tao-kuang, but\r\nthough Prince Tun himself had thirty years before been given in adoption\r\nto an uncle, the claim of his descendants to the imperial inheritance\r\nbeing thereby weakened, he seems never to have renounced his rights. At\r\nthe time of the decease of Tungchih there was so much apprehension of\r\ndisturbances in Peking, both on account of the succession and the form of\r\nthe regency, that the 'Times' (February 4, 1875) wrote, \"A battle on this\r\nquestion would seem almost inevitable, and notwithstanding the proverbial\r\nslowness of the East in most things, in crises like the present aspirants\r\nto Eastern thrones are wont to display both energy and readiness when the\r\nmoment arrives for a _coup d'état_.\"\r\n\r\nThe next in seniority of the sons of Tao-kuang was Prince Kung, whose\r\ntitle was uncompromised by alienation, and he had a son eligible. Whatever\r\nmay have been the reasons for setting aside the claims of the two elder\r\nbrothers to occupy the Dragon throne, they were considered to have been\r\nwrongfully set aside, and of this more will doubtless be heard in the\r\nfulness of time. Since, for reasons well understood, no natural heir\r\nto the present monarch can succeed him, there must be fresh recourse\r\nto adoption when or before the necessity arises, and what influences,\r\nnative or alien, may then be concentrated on the imperial succession is\r\na speculation on which it would be profitless to enter.\r\n\r\nThe empress-regent's _coup d'état_ of January 1875, when on a bitterly\r\ncold night her infant nephew was taken out of his warm bed, conveyed\r\ninto the palace, and proclaimed emperor the following morning, answered\r\nthe scheming lady's expectations, for she has ruled the Chinese empire\r\nfrom that day to this. By the same stroke she was enabled to disembarrass\r\nherself of her original confederate, Prince Kung, to whose ambition she\r\ndealt a crushing blow in ousting his family from the succession. The two\r\nhad come to hate each other with more than common virulence; and now that\r\nPrince Ch'un had been set on an unassailable pedestal as father of the\r\nreigning sovereign, the regent placed her trust and confidence in him, and\r\nshared with him the sweets of empire. Inasmuch, however, as the regent\r\nwas a woman, and her imperial brother-in-law neither a man of affairs\r\nnor in a position to assume any outward share in the Government, it was\r\nnecessary to bring in a practical statesman to stand between them and the\r\nouter world. This position of confidence was occupied for twenty years by\r\nthe grand secretary, Li Hung-chang.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n [21] For an unvarnished narrative of both the French and the Russian\r\n    advances the reader cannot do better than consult Mr Gundry's\r\n    'China and her Neighbours,' Chapman & Hall, 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE MURDER OF MR MARGARY, 1875--CHEFOO CONVENTION, 1876--RATIFICATION,\r\n1885.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE MURDER OF MR MARGARY, 1875.\r\n\r\n    Efforts to reach China from Burma--Expedition under Colonel\r\n    Browne--Mr Margary appointed interpreter--Meets party at\r\n    Bhamo--Precedes them into China, and is assassinated at\r\n    Manwyne--Discussion thereon with the Chinese Government--Tsên\r\n    Yü-ying, Governor of Yunnan--British Minister charges him with the\r\n    murder--Demands his arraignment--Sends commission from Peking to\r\n    Yunnan to take evidence--Unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nEver since the conquest of British Burma, and more especially since the\r\ntreaty concluded with the King of Burma in 1862, political and commercial\r\nspeculation had been busied with the mountainous country which divides\r\nit from the empire of China. The fact that next to nothing was known\r\nof that wild region, combined with the prospect of reopening the old\r\ncaravan route which had been some time closed by disturbances among the\r\nfrontier tribes and by Chinese insurgents, constituted a great stimulus to\r\nexploration. To this end projects were from time to time considered by the\r\nIndian Government--sometimes at the instance of enthusiastic officials,\r\nsometimes urged by the superior authority of the British Government under\r\npressure from mercantile bodies in England. South-western China, however,\r\nwas as jealously guarded from intrusion as the sea-coast had been, and no\r\nprogress was made in penetrating its mystery.\r\n\r\nAfter the failure of an exploring expedition under Colonel Edward B.\r\nSladen in 1868, the Indian Government, in furtherance of the wishes of the\r\nGovernment at home, sanctioned yet another attempt six years later, though\r\nwith decided misgivings as to any successful issue. Arrangements were\r\nmade during 1874, and the expedition, under Colonel Horace Browne, was\r\ndespatched from Burma _viâ_ Bhamo in the beginning of 1875. The British\r\nMinister in China had been asked for his co-operation, and in particular\r\nhe was requested to furnish Colonel Browne with a competent interpreter.\r\nIt was arranged that this official, armed with a Chinese passport issued\r\nby the Government at Peking, should make his own way through China from\r\nthe coast and join Colonel Browne at Bhamo.\r\n\r\nThe choice of her Majesty's Minister fell upon one of the most promising\r\nofficers in the consular service, Mr Augustus Raymond Margary, who\r\nproceeded from Shanghai by way of the Yangtze to the province of Yunnan,\r\nand in five months accomplished his perilous pioneering journey with\r\nperfect success, arriving on the 17th of January at the rendezvous, where\r\nhe was received with the warmest feelings by Colonel Browne and his party,\r\nand with surprise and admiration by the Burmese.\r\n\r\nOn being joined by Mr Margary, the mission prepared to start from Bhamo\r\ntowards China. Everything seemed auspicious for the expedition. On\r\narriving at the Burmese frontier, however, the party were met by sinister\r\nrumours of armed opposition to their passage through the Kakhyen hills.\r\nMargary, having just come safely through these districts, volunteered\r\nto proceed alone to ascertain the truth of the reports which they had\r\nheard. How he was treacherously assassinated at Manwyne, the first city\r\nwithin the Chinese border, and how Colonel Browne's mission was assailed\r\nand driven back by armed bands, has been told by Dr John Anderson in 'A\r\nNarrative of the two Expeditions to Western China' of 1868 and 1875, and\r\nby Sir Rutherford Alcock, the sympathetic editor of Mr Margary's 'Letters\r\nand Journals,' as well as in numerous Government publications.\r\n\r\nIt became then a question of the gravest import to fix the guilt of\r\nthis treachery, and to consider what means could be adopted for avenging\r\nthe death of a young Englishman within Chinese territory, and bearing a\r\npassport from the Government of Peking. \"Whether it be Burmese, Kakhyens,\r\nShan tribes, or Chinese that are in question, it is impossible we can\r\naccept a defeat of this nature, brought on, too, by our own spontaneous\r\nacts,\" was the conclusion of Sir Rutherford Alcock. Governments which\r\nresorted to the assassination of individuals under their own safe conduct\r\nmust be deterred, by persuasion or by force, from the use of such tactics.\r\nThe demand for redress which was made direct to the Tsungli-Yamên was\r\nfollowed by a wrangling and evasive discussion as to the conditions on\r\nwhich the passport had been granted. These, it must be admitted, had\r\nnot been so definitely stated as they might have been. Passports, as Mr\r\nWade, then Minister in Peking, explained, were granted in two forms--for\r\n\"business,\" meaning trade, or for \"pleasure,\" rendered in Chinese \"tour\r\nor travel.\" It was in the latter form that the passport for Colonel\r\nBrowne was applied for, and the Chinese made a plausible defence of their\r\nposition on this narrow ground, asserting that the subsequent declaration\r\nthat the mission was intended to open a trade route through Chinese\r\nprovinces, where they alleged no trading rights for foreigners existed,\r\ncould not be covered by a passport granted for pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe voluminous discussion on international rights which followed, although\r\nacademical in form and irrelevant to the question at issue, betrayed the\r\nanimus of the Chinese Government in regard to commercial concessions in\r\nthe interior; but it is possible that the true motive for the repulse\r\nof Colonel Browne's expedition, of which Mr Margary's murder was but an\r\nincident, lay deeper. Europeans are accustomed to make light of oriental\r\nsuspicions, and the idea that Colonel Browne's party was the vanguard of\r\na hostile force to be treacherously introduced into Chinese territory\r\nunder passport may seem too fantastic to have been entertained in good\r\nfaith. Yet if we consider on what trivial grounds even the civilised\r\nPowers of Europe will at times suspect each other of the most grandiose\r\ndesigns, and how often the suspicion is justified, we need not dismiss\r\nas incredible the fact that, in a frontier province which had recently\r\nbeen the scene of a formidable rebellion, an armed escort accompanying a\r\nforeign tourist party should have caused sincere misgivings in the minds\r\nof the authorities. Nor do the facts of the case exclude the possibility\r\nof such suspicions being suggested from without, even if they did not\r\narise spontaneously within. Apart from these special considerations, the\r\nchances of success would probably have been greater if the mission had\r\nstarted from the Chinese side, where the right of travel and exploration\r\nhad already been established.\r\n\r\nThe verbal polemic over the conditions of the passport did not, however,\r\ntouch the matter in hand, which was the murder of a British official for\r\nwhom the Chinese Government, both imperial and provincial, were expressly\r\nresponsible. It is not necessary at this day to pronounce judgment on\r\nthe identity of the actual criminal. The murder was the result of a\r\nconspiracy in which Chinese and Burmese were both implicated. They were\r\nalike interested in preventing the passage of the mission, and the strong\r\nopposition of the Burma Government was not unknown to Mr Margary, for he\r\nhad noted it in his Journal.\r\n\r\nThe King of Burma, the father of the well-known Theebaw, was a learned\r\npandit and a devout Buddhist, as severe in regard to heretics as the\r\ncrowned heads of Europe were in the days of the Inquisition. The Court of\r\nAva, in its claims to obeisance from foreigners, was almost as exacting as\r\nthe Son of Heaven himself, and the priests lorded it over the community\r\nwith the arrogance of a pampered caste. Thus foreign intercourse was\r\nheavily hampered, and a good understanding rendered almost impossible.\r\nFears for their prerogatives must have inspired the royal and priestly\r\ncoterie with aversion to that restless element which was always trying to\r\n\"open up\" other people's country and to explore trade routes. Hence the\r\nmotive for obstructing the passage of a foreign expedition between Burma\r\nand China was as strong on the Burmese as on the Chinese side.\r\n\r\nTsên Yü-ying, the Chinese governor, held an exceptionally strong position\r\nin his province, and the officials stood very much in awe of him. Though\r\nnot a pure Chinese, having been born in the mountains of Kwangsi, of\r\naboriginal parentage on one side, his personal prestige was very great.\r\nA fighting man from his youth, he had acquired an immense reputation in\r\nsuppressing the Mohammedan rebellion in Yunnan. This he did in oriental\r\nstyle, extirpating the rebels so far as he could, root and branch. To save\r\nthe trouble of burying many thousands of old people and children, he had\r\nthem drowned in the Tali Lake. The military commander who was told off for\r\nthis pleasing duty palliated the massacre, when in after years narrating\r\nthese occurrences, by saying there were not really 10,000 but only 3000\r\nthrown into the lake. This official had remonstrated with the governor\r\nagainst the sentence, saying that such severity was not in accordance with\r\nTao li (principle); but Tsên replied, \"You have nothing to do with Tao\r\nli; you must conform to the Leu li\" (Penal Code).\r\n\r\nTsên Yü-ying was therefore something greater than an ordinary provincial\r\ngovernor, and wielded something more than the authority belonging to\r\nhis office. Not only was he responsible, as all governors are, for what\r\nwas done within his government, but it is difficult to conceive of any\r\nimportant incident occurring there without his personal sanction. But\r\nwhich was the leader in the plot, whether the acting-governor Tsên Yü-ying\r\nor the King of Burma, is comparatively unimportant; suffice it that her\r\nMajesty's Minister fixed, on grounds which satisfied himself, though of\r\ncourse on inferential evidence only, the instigation of the crime on the\r\ngovernor-general Tsên Yü-ying; and whether the direct guilt were brought\r\nhome to him or not, there could be no question about his responsibility\r\nunder the Chinese principle of administration. \"From the governor-general\r\ndownwards they are each and all individually and collectively held\r\nresponsible for all that may happen in the limits of their jurisdiction.\"\r\nAccordingly, after much preliminary discussion, Mr Wade demanded that\r\nthat high official should be censured for neglect of duty, and, on later\r\ninformation, that he should be brought for trial to Peking. To this\r\ndemand the Peking Government refused to listen, and after feigning for\r\nmany months to have no knowledge of what had taken place, they produced a\r\nreport from the governor-general himself inculpating certain subordinates,\r\nof whom he seemed willing to make a nominal sacrifice. This report was so\r\nopenly mendacious that Sir Thomas Wade threatened to haul down his flag\r\nif it were published.\r\n\r\nUnluckily for the successful prosecution of the demand for the arraignment\r\nof the viceroy, the British Minister became entangled in a cat's-cradle of\r\nnegotiations for the revision of the treaty of Tientsin, with which the\r\nYunnan outrage got so mixed up that the different questions never could\r\nbe, or at any rate never were, separated again. Throwing the net is the\r\ntactical device in which the Chinese excel. The demand for reparation\r\nfor the murder was alternately put forward, modified, and withdrawn\r\naccording as the general propositions were shuffled about, and thus the\r\neffect of a concentrated attack on the essential point was lost. The\r\nminister on his own showing found himself in a succession of dilemmas,\r\nwhile the Chinese defensive position was clear throughout: it was to\r\nrefuse everything, evade when direct refusal was dangerous, and in short\r\nto baffle all attempts of the British Minister to get to close quarters\r\nwith the question. Sir Thomas Wade was several times brought by these\r\nelusive tactics to the point of threatening withdrawal of the Legation,\r\nwhich in itself the Chinese would have welcomed as a householder might\r\nthe \"positively last visit\" of a tax-collector, but for the ulterior\r\nconsequences to be apprehended.\r\n\r\nAfter many months of fruitless labour Sir Thomas Wade resolved to send\r\na commission of his own to Yunnan to collect evidence as to Margary's\r\nmurder. His right to do so was at first contested by the Chinese; but\r\nafter considering the matter, and getting the best advice at their\r\ncommand, they assented, and named High Commissioners to meet the British\r\nofficials. The Hon. T. G. Grosvenor, secretary of Legation, was detached\r\nfor this duty, assisted by two of the most competent men in the consular\r\nservice--Mr Colborn Baber and Mr Arthur Davenport. On the Chinese side\r\nwere appointed the viceroy of the Hu Kwang, Li Han-chang, elder brother\r\nof Li Hung-chang, another official to whom Sir Thomas Wade objected\r\nstrongly, but in vain, and Tsên Yü-ying himself, the inculpated party.\r\nThe promises made to the British Minister before he would allow the\r\nmission to set out were broken as soon as it was fairly on its way, and\r\nSir Thomas Wade had serious thoughts of recalling it, foreseeing that\r\nit was destined merely to waste time. What possible hope, indeed, could\r\nthere be of isolated foreigners collecting evidence in a distant city\r\nagainst the high provincial officials? No evidence was taken. The British\r\nCommissioner was simply presented with the original report, to which was\r\nadded the so-called \"confession\" of thirteen savages \"kidnapped to do\r\nduty as prisoners at the bar.\" These savages could not speak Chinese, nor\r\nwas their language understood by any one in the viceregal court; it was\r\nevident that they had never been near the scene of the crime, nor did they\r\nlook in the least like men who were pleading guilty to a capital charge.\r\n\r\nThe motive of the Chinese in yielding to the appointment of the British\r\ncommission, after refusing their assent to it, only occurred to Sir Thomas\r\nWade when they recommended that Mr Grosvenor should remain in Yunnan\r\nuntil the case was closed. No coercive measures, they calculated, would\r\nbe taken against them while these hostages remained in their hands. From\r\nfirst to last the only question that occupied the mind of the Chinese\r\nGovernment was whether force would be applied or not. And if they read--as\r\nof course they did--the English newspapers of the day they would see that\r\nthe contingency of war was dwelt upon throughout the year 1875 as the\r\nsole alternative to the condign punishment of the Governor-General of\r\nYunnan-Kweichow. This was, indeed, from time to time directly threatened\r\nby Sir Thomas Wade, and he had applied for the Flying Squadron to come on\r\nfrom India to support his demands. When at last, after eighteen months'\r\nstruggle, he abandoned the negotiations, and \"abruptly left Peking\" for\r\nShanghai in order to be in direct telegraphic communication with the\r\nHome Government, he wrote, \"I had, in the last fortnight, again and again\r\nthreatened either to remove the Legation or to recommend to her Majesty's\r\nGovernment the extremest measure of coercion unless I had secured a very\r\nmoderate form of reparation.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Prince Kung realised the fact that the British Minister had actually\r\nleft the capital he became suddenly serious, and sent after him to\r\nsay there had been a misunderstanding, which would have been cleared\r\naway if he had only waited. At the same time the prince had recourse\r\nto his foreign adviser, the Inspector-General of Customs, who stood\r\nto the Government somewhat in the relation of a \"medicine-man.\" The\r\ninspector-general had taken an active part, both direct and indirect, in\r\nthe comedy of the preceding eighteen months--whether as an ally or an\r\nopponent of the British Minister seems not to have been quite clear to\r\nthe comprehension of the latter.\r\n\r\nAn imperial decree was immediately despatched to the Grand Secretary,\r\nLi Hung-chang, instructing him to detain the British Minister on his\r\nway through Tientsin, in order to confer with him on the Margary case.\r\nThis proposal Sir Thomas Wade declined on several grounds: among others,\r\nthat at a previous stage of the negotiations the promises made by Li\r\nHung-chang had been repudiated by the Peking Government. This effort to\r\nstop him at Tientsin having failed, Mr Hart was despatched in hot haste\r\nafter Sir Thomas Wade to Shanghai, ostensibly to discuss the \"commercial\r\nquestion,\" but really to induce the British Minister to re-enter the\r\narena of negotiation,[22] in which the Chinese felt themselves safe. Sir\r\nThomas, therefore, consented to meet a special commissioner, but without\r\ncommitting himself as to the scope of the intended conference. The High\r\nCommissioner was Li Hung-chang, and the place of meeting Chefoo, the\r\nlocality being selected by Sir Thomas Wade himself. There was concluded\r\nthe famous Chefoo Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. CHEFOO CONVENTION, 1876.\r\n\r\n    Negotiations with Li Hung-chang at Chefoo--Mr Hart\r\n    assisting--Sir Thomas Wade hurried into making an unsatisfactory\r\n    settlement--Chefoo convention analysed--Net result an increase\r\n    in the customs dues--Criticised by the merchants.\r\n\r\nIt was in the month of September, the summer not yet over, during which\r\nseason the sea air and fine beach of Chefoo made it at that time the\r\nbest health resort for the China coast. Visitors from Peking occasionally\r\nvaried their summer residence at the Western Hills by spending a few weeks\r\nat Chefoo, and in 1876 there were several members of the diplomatic body\r\ntaking their holiday at the watering-place, the meeting of the British\r\nand Chinese plenipotentiaries constituting for them an added attraction.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Wade had originally no intention of concluding a formal\r\nconvention, nor had he authority for closing the Yunnan question without\r\nfurther reference to his Government; but circumstances proved too\r\nstrong for him to keep to his resolution. He, in fact, found himself in\r\nsuch a position of difficulty as is perhaps best described by the word\r\n\"cornered\"--the advantage of the game having passed entirely to the\r\nother side. The Chinese commissioner was powerfully reinforced by the\r\ninspector-general, supported by the local commissioner of customs for\r\nChefoo; and the neutrality of those of the diplomatic body who were on\r\nthe spot was believed to be benevolent to the Chinese. The \"co-operative\r\npolicy\" of Mr Burlingame's day had for the time being at least lapsed,\r\nand particularist views among the Powers or their representatives began\r\nto prevail. The British Minister, deeming the matter in dispute with\r\nthe Chinese a purely British concern, did not hold it incumbent on him\r\nto hamper his negotiations by daily consultations with his colleagues,\r\nwho on their part resented his reticence, claiming it as a right that,\r\nconsidering how their national interests might be affected by the result,\r\nthey should be kept informed of the progress of the negotiations.\r\nSir Thomas Wade admits that, among other considerations, it was the\r\nimpatience of these colleagues of his to see the discussion definitely\r\nterminated which induced him to close the case without waiting for further\r\ninstructions from his Government.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that the problem before the Chinese High\r\nCommissioner had never varied: it was the extremely simple one, how to\r\nscreen the ex-governor Tsên Yü-ying, whether guilty or innocent, without\r\nencountering a British armed force. The fate of the negotiations depended\r\nentirely on the probable movement of the Flying Squadron, which was lying\r\nat Talien-wan, a hundred miles off. No greater service could have been\r\nrendered to the Chinese Government than to assure the High Commissioner\r\nthat he had nothing to fear from the British ships. The foreign Ministers\r\nwho were present had their Intelligence Departments in full activity, and\r\nthey had a shrewd notion of the limitations of the Flying Squadron, which\r\nthey were free to communicate to the Chinese plenipotentiary. They were\r\naware that the time--September 1876--was not opportune for the British\r\nGovernment to embark on distant enterprises of indefinite possibilities.\r\nFrom one source or another the assurance was given to the Chinese\r\nnegotiator, and once convinced, on whatever evidence, that the British\r\nguns would fire nothing but salutes, Li Hung-chang felt himself master of\r\nthe situation. It then became his turn to force a settlement, and he at\r\nonce assumed a peremptory tone with the British Minister, notifying him\r\nthat he would leave Chefoo on a certain day, convention or no convention.\r\nSir Thomas Wade had, or thought he had, no choice but to capitulate to\r\nsuperior force. Pressed by his diplomatic colleagues, as has been said, as\r\nwell as by the expressed desire of his own Government to get the tedious\r\nmatter settled, he had to accept the best agreement he could get, and the\r\nChefoo convention was the result.\r\n\r\nThe fear of coercion being eliminated, the negotiation became reduced\r\nto a custom-house affair like the treaty revision of 1869, the Chinese\r\nseizing the occasion to renew their former efforts to obtain an increase\r\nof revenue from foreign trade. Instead of adding to the import duty on\r\nforeign merchandise as in 1869, they now proposed to extend the area\r\nof internal taxation, and in particular they prepared the way for an\r\nindefinite increase in the opium revenue. This was the substantial part\r\nof the convention. New ports were opened in harmony with the scheme.\r\n\r\nA clause referring to residence at Chungking in Szechuan provided that\r\nBritish merchants would not be allowed to reside there so long as no\r\nsteamers had access to the port. When, under this contingent clause, it\r\nwas attempted to make the conditional permission effective by sending\r\nsteamers to the port, the Chinese Government offered opposition, and the\r\nright was abandoned by Great Britain.\r\n\r\nAs for the Yunnan affair, the settlement of it gravitated to the form\r\nwhich had been universally condemned. \"Do not let the nation lay itself\r\nopen to the contempt of an Asiatic people by accepting money for life\r\ntreacherously taken by official order,\" wrote Sir R. Alcock in July\r\n1875. But \"the series of bad precedents\" was once more followed, and\r\n\"blood-money was accepted for the life of a British subject.\"\r\n\r\nIt was thought important to publish far and wide the terms of settlement,\r\nand a proclamation with Sir T. Wade's _imprimatur_ was posted throughout\r\nthe country. It was remarked, however, that this proclamation embodied the\r\nvery falsities against the publication of which the British Minister had\r\npreviously protested under threat of breaking off diplomatic relations.\r\nThe guilt of notoriously innocent parties was assumed in it, but their\r\npardon granted on the fictitious ground that the evidence against them\r\nwould not suffice to convict by the processes of British law.\r\n\r\nA separate article provided for a mission of exploration by way of\r\nSzechuan and Tibet in the following year.\r\n\r\nA subject on which Sir Thomas Wade had long set his heart was an\r\nimprovement in the terms of intercourse between foreign and Chinese\r\nofficials, with a view of putting an end to the habitual assumption\r\nof superiority of the Chinese. This was treated in a few empty words\r\nproviding that the Tsungli-Yamên should invite foreign representatives to\r\nconsider with them a code of etiquette, a clause imposing no obligation\r\nwhatever on either party.\r\n\r\nAnother question which had greatly occupied the minds of both the\r\nBritish Government and its successive representatives ever since 1833\r\nwas the establishment of a code of laws to regulate the civil and\r\ncriminal relations between foreigners and Chinese at the treaty ports\r\nand elsewhere. This had formed a feature in the supplementary convention\r\nof 1869, the undertaking in which did not, however, extend beyond the\r\ngeneral terms that \"it is further agreed that England and China shall in\r\nconsultation draw up a commercial code.\"\r\n\r\nStrongly approving, however, of the abstract idea that China should adopt\r\na written code of commercial law as a first step towards a general legal\r\nreform, Sir T. Wade nevertheless uttered a useful caution to those ardent\r\nreformers who see in a good code of laws a panacea for either national\r\nor international grievances. \"No nation,\" he says, \"worked harder at its\r\nlegislation than China; but in the way of justice there are at least\r\ntwo serious impediments--an ignorance which renders due appreciation\r\nof the value of evidence, especially in criminal cases, impossible; and\r\na dishonesty that would be fatal to the administration of any laws, no\r\nmatter how enlightened.\" He illustrates this by relating an instance of\r\nthe obstinate nature of the _chose jugée_ in China.\r\n\r\n    In a case [he says] the termination of which is just announced\r\n    at Peking, we have a woman wrongly convicted, on a confession\r\n    extorted from her by torture, of the murder of a husband who\r\n    died a natural death, the injustice being so patent that the\r\n    fellow-provincials of the accused appealed to Peking. Orders\r\n    being issued for a rehearing of the case, the former decision\r\n    was affirmed in the province, and this a second and again a third\r\n    time. The proceedings were then removed to Peking; and it is in\r\n    the end established that magistrates of districts, prefects of\r\n    departments, the governor of the province, and the high officer\r\n    charged with the public instruction of the province, who had been\r\n    specially commissioned to rehear the case, have all more or less\r\n    combined to conceal the delinquency of the first authority who\r\n    heard it; with whose guilt the rest, his seniors, had associated\r\n    themselves either through carelessness or from a corrupt motive.\r\n    These proceedings lasted over two years.\r\n\r\nOne point, however, was definitively gained in connection with\r\njurisprudence, the recognition of the British Supreme Court as a means of\r\ndischarging treaty obligations.\r\n\r\nThe convention as a whole was subjected to the same kind of criticism\r\nas that of 1869 had been. The Chambers of Commerce pointed out that it\r\nsanctioned Chinese exactions which had been up to that time consistently\r\nresisted as violations of the treaty of Tientsin. Imposts, condemned by\r\nthe Chinese themselves,[23] which were to be abolished altogether by\r\nthe terms of the Alcock convention, were by the Chefoo agreement not\r\nonly recognised as lawful, but the area of their levy, within which\r\nthe taxes were to be freed from all restrictions whether as to their\r\namount or incidence, greatly extended. It would appear, therefore, said\r\nthe merchants, \"better to revert to the clear and simple provisions of\r\nthe treaty of Tientsin, and insist on their being carried out without\r\nevasion.\" So far, they say, from simplifying the question of the taxation\r\nof foreign goods, the obliquely worded clauses in the Chefoo convention\r\ntend to quite the opposite result. \"New elements of obscurity have\r\nbeen introduced, and if twenty years have been spent wrangling over the\r\ncomparatively simple wording of the Tientsin treaty, it is to be feared\r\nthat no person now living will see the end of the controversies which will\r\nrage over the indefinite arrangement set forth in the Chefoo convention.\"\r\n\r\nOpium was also for the first time introduced into a treaty, for the\r\npurpose of increasing the Chinese revenue from it and of making the\r\nmaritime customs, supported by the British Government, the agent for its\r\ncollection. The Chinese had always been at liberty to levy what internal\r\ntaxation they pleased on opium; but, said the Chamber of Commerce, for\r\nthe \"English Government to make itself even indirectly answerable for the\r\ncollection from Chinese of an impost of indefinite amount, varying at each\r\nport according to the caprice or the necessities of local authorities who\r\nare not even specified, would surely be to introduce a most inconvenient\r\nprecedent.\" The convention was left for nine years unratified by the\r\nBritish Government. It could not be ratified because, among other reasons,\r\nfive of the treaty Powers took the same objection as the British and other\r\nmerchants had taken to the curtailment of the area of exemption from\r\ninland taxation--in other words, to the legal sanction extended by the\r\nagreement to unlimited exactions of the Chinese tax-collectors which had\r\nup till then been resisted as illegal.\r\n\r\nDuring the eight years following the signature of the Chefoo convention\r\nincessant discussion and agitation on the subject of the duties on opium\r\nand general merchandise kept the British Legation in Peking, and in a\r\nlesser degree the Foreign Office at home, in full activity. The question\r\nwas turned over in all its aspects, threshed out on this side and on\r\nthat, and numerous schemes were proposed for readjusting the imposts. The\r\nBritish Minister displayed the utmost ingenuity in evolving variations\r\non the central theme, in which ethical, political, and sentimental\r\nconsiderations played their part, but without advancing the solution of\r\nthe problem. The problem was altogether too simple for such recondite\r\ntreatment. The Chinese throughout all the tortuous disquisitions pressed\r\ntowards the one object of a substantial increase in their revenue, by\r\nwhatever means it might be arrived at; and eventually they attained their\r\nobject, as those generally do who concentrate their attention on a single\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE RATIFICATION, 1885.\r\n\r\n    Ratification postponed--Tedious discussion during nine\r\n    years--Chinese claiming large increase in opium duty--Ultimately\r\n    granted--By agreement signed in 1885--Hongkong and Macao made\r\n    stations for collecting opium duties.\r\n\r\nThe convention simmered for nine years before its final ratification.\r\nThe two Governments skirmished in the air all that time, misconceiving\r\neach other's aims and avoiding close quarters. The policy of Great\r\nBritain with regard to opium had been fatally deflected by unpractical\r\nconsiderations. The article had been placed by the trade regulations\r\nappended to the treaty in the exceptional position of being excluded\r\nfrom the privilege accorded to all other merchandise of exemption from\r\ninland taxation by payment of a fixed charge. The Chinese authorities\r\nwere therefore at liberty to tax the article in transit to any extent\r\nthey pleased. For reasons connected with their own administration, this\r\nunlimited power of taxation in transit was not deemed sufficient to\r\nproduce the desired amount of revenue, and they were intent on supplying\r\nthe deficiency by an enhanced import tariff. The difference between\r\nthe two forms of taxation was that the inland duty was collected in a\r\nChinese sieve, while the import duty was levied with the formalities of\r\na banker's counter. Naturally, therefore, the Chinese Government missed\r\nno opportunity of pressing for an increase on the tariff fixed by treaty.\r\nIt was the main object sought by them in the unratified convention of\r\n1869. Failing then, they renewed their efforts in the Chefoo convention of\r\n1876, seeking the same end by an inverted process, like taking a sea-fort\r\nfrom the land side. Instead of reviving the discredited proposal, they\r\neffected a turning movement by extending the area of the inland dues\r\nuntil it included the port of landing. Why, having full licence over the\r\nwhole empire, a few acres added to their tax-collecting province should\r\nhave been deemed of such vital importance is not perhaps at first sight\r\nself-evident. The reason was that under the proposed system the machinery\r\nof the Imperial maritime customs could be employed in collection, with\r\nthe protection of the foreign consuls.\r\n\r\nThe concession was set forth in cryptic form in the convention, but the\r\nChinese knew very well what interpretation they intended to give to the\r\nclause. That intention remained unaltered, though tactics varied. By the\r\nlight of the vague and pointless correspondence carried on for seven years\r\nwith the British Government they saw their way to advancing considerably\r\nbeyond the position gained by the convention. They consequently raised\r\ntheir demands in proportion as they found the British Government yielding,\r\nuntil eventually they reached a vantage-ground where they could safely\r\nunmask and make direct for their object, an increase in the import tariff\r\npure and simple. Eighty taels were added to the thirty allowed by the old\r\ntreaty, and the opium duty was thus really trebled at a stroke.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations which led up to the convention are chiefly interesting\r\nas showing how easily the Foreign Office was chased from cover to cover\r\nby the Chinese Minister. Having once got the enemy \"on the run,\" the\r\nMarquis Tsêng did not relax his pursuit until, notwithstanding one or two\r\nrear-guard actions, he capitulated without conditions.\r\n\r\nAfter seven years of active deliberation the definitive diplomatic\r\nconference was opened by Lord Granville in January 1883. As a preliminary,\r\nthe basis of the negotiations was rigidly defined by Mr (now Lord) Currie,\r\nin accordance with the Chefoo convention, thus: the regulation of the\r\n_likin_ taxation, and specification of the barriers at which collections\r\nwere to be made.\r\n\r\nBut, as we have hinted, the Chinese aspirations had in the mean time\r\nfar transcended the scope of any provision of any treaty. No longer\r\ncontent with regulating _likin_, their first step in the conference\r\nwas to induce Lord Granville to abandon the preliminary stipulation\r\nhe had so carefully laid down. The Chinese Minister proposed a general\r\ncommutation rate, uniform at all the ports, supporting the claim by sundry\r\nspecious arguments. The _likin_ barriers had been a chronic grievance\r\nof the merchants. The marquis held out a prospect of their abolition as\r\na consequence of the single-payment commutation of inland dues on which\r\nhe was intent. It is a feature of Chinese bargains of every description\r\nthat something definite should be conceded on the one side, and something\r\nindefinite promised on the other,--the \"bird in the hand\" invariably for\r\nthe Chinese. There was nothing surprising, therefore, in the time-honoured\r\nformula being employed in these diplomatic interchanges.\r\n\r\nIn moving from his base, Lord Granville, of course, ceded everything; but\r\nhe made a final stand at the amount, declaring that \"he could not agree\r\nthat the _likin_ payment should be fixed at more than 70 taels\"; moreover,\r\nthat he \"would require full information as to the guarantees which would\r\nbe given that opium would not be subject to any further payment while in\r\ntransit.\" One such guarantee was already provided for in the convention,\r\nwhich stipulates \"that the nationality of the person possessing or\r\ncarrying the merchandise would be immaterial.\" This was deemed of great\r\nimportance to trade, because since it was not always possible for a\r\nforeign owner, or even a deputy of his own race, to accompany a parcel of\r\ngoods into the interior, the permission for Chinese to accompany them was\r\nessential to the working of the transit business. The contention of the\r\nmerchant had always been, that the exemption from dues was a privilege\r\nattaching to the goods, and not to the temporary owner or transport agent.\r\nOn the other hand, as the goods could not speak, the option of sending\r\neither a native or a foreigner at the merchant's own choice was considered\r\na useful check on illicit exactions.\r\n\r\nThe confident manner in which the marquis brushed away both of Lord\r\nGranville's ultimata showed how well he had profited by his experience of\r\nForeign Office diplomacy. To Lord Granville's maximum of 70 taels (the sum\r\nactually agreed upon with the Chinese Government) the marquis said he was\r\nsorry, but his instructions did not permit of his accepting less than 80\r\ntaels per pecul. It is not customary to ask for proofs of good faith from\r\nambassadors acting \"on instructions,\" and Lord Granville simply yielded\r\nthe point, while entering a mild protest against being forced by a Chinese\r\n_non possumus_.\r\n\r\nAnd the right of the foreigner to accompany his goods, on which so much\r\nstress had been laid, was disposed of with exquisite assurance by the\r\nChinese Minister, who was confident that such a mere detail \"would not\r\nbe allowed to stand in the way of a settlement,\" notwithstanding that it\r\ninvolved a reversal of the Chefoo convention.\r\n\r\nAnd as to the guarantees for fulfilment, the Marquis Tsêng was sure that\r\n\"the strongest guarantee would consist in the moral obligation\" on the\r\npart of the Chinese Government to carry out arrangements of their own\r\nproposing. Thus, by sheer persistence, the Chinese gained every point,\r\nsecuring not only a threefold duty on opium, but the assistance of her\r\nMajesty's Government in its collection, for that was the meaning of\r\ntransferring the levy from the interior to the seaport. The agreement,\r\nconcluded by Lord Granville in June, was signed by Lord Salisbury in July\r\n1885, under the title of an \"Additional Article to the Chefoo Convention.\"\r\n\r\nIt is right to add, on the authority of recent observers, that the\r\nconvention has worked smoothly, no complaints being heard of inland\r\nexactions in contravention of its terms. It thus appears that the moral\r\nguarantee on which the Marquis Tsêng spoke so confidently was after all\r\nof some validity. But as the only source from which complaints could come\r\nwould be those foreign agents who were by the terms of the convention\r\nexpressly excluded from conveying or accompanying opium into the country,\r\nthe negative evidence is not absolutely conclusive.\r\n\r\nIt would have been most interesting to gain from so enlightened a\r\nMinister as Tsêng some insight into the causes of the continual friction\r\nand recrimination which attend the operation of the commercial articles\r\nin the Chinese treaties, but his despatches have reference only to the\r\nquestion of the moment. \"The Imperial Government,\" he says, \"have often\r\nbeen held responsible for the friction caused in working arrangements but\r\nill-adapted to the state of the country, and which a better knowledge of\r\nits internal conditions would have shown to those who framed them are\r\nincapable of execution.\" \"The present scheme,\" he intimates, \"being in\r\nharmony with existing institutions,\" may be expected to work smoothly.\r\nExisting institutions, therefore, are opposed to local taxation and in\r\nfavour of single commutations. When, however, a different thesis has\r\nto be sustained, we are assured by other authorities that \"existing\r\ninstitutions\" claim arbitrary, variable, and unlimited taxation of goods\r\nin transit for the benefit of the provincial exchequers, and that it is\r\nthe attempt to commute these by a payment at the port which is the true\r\ncause of the friction and disputation.\r\n\r\nThe natural corollary followed the ratification of the Chefoo convention.\r\nThe desire of the Chinese Government, cherished for nearly thirty years,\r\nto establish a customs station in Hongkong was virtually consummated\r\nin the following year. The trade of the colony had been vexed by a\r\nperpetual blockade by so-called revenue cruisers which harried every\r\nnative vessel entering or leaving the harbour. The hope of getting the\r\ninvestment relaxed may have induced the acquiescence of the colony in\r\nany alternative. The Chinese sought to grip the opium supply by the neck,\r\nwhich could only be done by their obtaining control over the harbour of\r\nHongkong. This was conceded, and a customs station was established on the\r\nChinese side of the anchorage, while an office was opened in the city of\r\nVictoria.\r\n\r\nThere was a second \"neck\" to the opium supply--Macao. The arrangement\r\nmade with Hongkong without a corresponding agreement with Macao would\r\nhave merely driven the trade from the one to the other. Overtures were\r\ntherefore made to the Portuguese, who, unlike the English, were offered a\r\nvaluable consideration for admitting the control of the Chinese customs\r\ninto their waters. They then obtained for the first time a treaty of\r\nindependent sovereignty for the colony.\r\n\r\nThe effect of all these negotiations and arrangements, whether intended or\r\nnot, was to stimulate the cultivation of Chinese opium to a high degree,\r\nand this, according to the impartial testimony of an ex-German Minister,\r\nis, apart from the increase to the Chinese revenue, the net result of the\r\nanti-opium agitation.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [22] \"Experience shows us that in the eyes of the Chinese negotiation\r\n    is a sign of weakness.\"--Sir F.

DISPUTE WITH RUSSIA _RE_ KULDJA.\r\n\r\n    Insurrection in Kashgaria--Russia occupies Kuldja--Engaging to\r\n    evacuate when country settled--Tso Tsung-tang's march--Death\r\n    of Yakub-beg--China reoccupies Kashgaria--Calls upon Russia\r\n    to retire from Kuldja--Relations become strained--Chunghou\r\n    concludes treaty with Russia--Violently repudiated by empress--War\r\n    threatened--Gordon summoned--Dispute arranged by Marquis Tsêng.\r\n\r\nThe dilatoriness of China in making a stand against Japanese pretensions\r\nin Korea may be partly explained by her serious preoccupations elsewhere.\r\nShe had been immersed in a sea of troubles. She seemed to be enveloped in\r\nrebellion. In the south-west the province of Yunnan had been severed from\r\nthe imperial rule, and in its recovery the land was almost depopulated.\r\nIn the north-west there were also Mohammedan risings, and in far-distant\r\nKashgaria, separated from China by a thousand miles of desert and\r\nmilitarily untenable by her, the adventurer known as Yakub-beg set up\r\nan independent government, which he maintained for some years. Anarchy\r\non her frontier afforded to Russia the pretext of occupying Chinese\r\nterritory to maintain order; but she was scrupulous in assuring the Peking\r\nGovernment that this step was provisional, and that she was ready to\r\nrestore Kuldja as soon as the Chinese were again in a position to resume\r\nthe government of the town and territory. The time came sooner than was\r\nexpected. The famous march of Tso Tsung-tang, who halted to grow grain\r\nfor the support of his army, and the disaffection in his camp leading to\r\nthe demise of Yakub, enabled China to reoccupy the revolted districts.\r\nRussia, on being asked to redeem her pledge as to Kuldja, made conditions\r\nwhich were not acceptable, and a diplomatic campaign was entered upon.\r\nA high Manchu official, Chunghou, the same who had been sent to France\r\nin 1871, was despatched to Prussia, where he concluded the treaty of\r\nLivadia, which was so repugnant to the empress-regent and her advisers\r\nthat not only was it repudiated at Peking, but the envoy was delivered\r\nto the Board of Punishments. Relations became strained between Russia\r\nand China, and on both sides there were hints of a resort to force. In\r\nview of this eventuality the Chinese Government were recommended to apply\r\nfor the services of their old champion, Gordon, who, unknown to them,\r\nhad taken service with Lord Ripon, the then new Viceroy of India, and,\r\nequally unknown to them, had precipitately resigned that service. The\r\nChinese had a large body of troops in Manchuria; the long line of Russian\r\ncommunication was very weak along that frontier; the governor of Eastern\r\nSiberia, declaring himself unable to resist a Chinese attack, had urged\r\nthe Government at St Petersburg to come to terms at once with China, and\r\nwait for a suitable opportunity to recover what they might be obliged\r\nto cede. The Chinese Government hoped that if Gordon would come to their\r\nassistance, and take command of their Manchurian levies, his name would\r\nbe a host in itself, and his appearance on the scene would at any rate\r\nconvince the Russian Government that China was in earnest. With this view\r\nan invitation was sent to General Gordon in a telegram from Sir Robert\r\nHart, which found him in Bombay. The invitation was unconditional; it\r\nindicated no purpose and named no price. Gordon took it entirely on trust,\r\nclosed at once, and proceeded to China. Having been given no clue as to\r\nwhat service was expected from him, Gordon, nevertheless, not only came\r\nto a conclusion of his own on the subject, but supplied his views to the\r\nnewspapers before leaving India, and at every port of call on the route.\r\nHe declared he was going to China to induce her to make peace, for she\r\nwas unable to do otherwise. In this he was of an opposite opinion from\r\nthe Russian governor-general. But whatever the merit of his opinion, the\r\nobject of the Chinese in sending for him was of course frustrated by his\r\npublished declarations. These being communicated to the Government at\r\nPeking, they saw that so far from stiffening them in their negotiations\r\nwith Russia, Gordon's presence would seriously embarrass them, and they\r\naccordingly endeavoured to prevent his coming. Through Sir Robert Hart\r\nthey sent a message to meet Gordon at Chefoo, requesting him to proceed no\r\nfarther. Disregarding this request, he continued his journey to Tientsin,\r\nwhere he had interviews with his old friend the Viceroy Li; and he also\r\nmade his way to Peking, where by the aid of an indifferent Cantonese\r\ninterpreter he made representations to the Tsungli-Yamên, some of which\r\nthe interpreter dared not reproduce in Chinese. Gordon left without seeing\r\neither Sir Robert Hart, on whose authority alone he had come to China,\r\nor the British Minister, Sir Thomas Wade. The advice he left with the\r\nChinese Ministers was to renounce the endeavour to organise an army on\r\nWestern models, and not to waste money on modern weapons, but to trust\r\nrather to numbers and the Fabian strategy which was natural to them. This\r\nbeing promptly published in foreign journals, was regarded as highly\r\nparadoxical, if not cynical; but it was recalled to mind fifteen years\r\nlater, when China was being defeated in the pitched battles against which\r\nGordon had warned them.\r\n\r\nThe Kuldja dispute was eventually disposed of by the Chinese Minister,\r\nMarquis Tsêng, who negotiated a treaty at St Petersburg, by which the\r\nterritory was nominally receded to China, while its strategical positions\r\nwere retained in the occupation of Russia, thus rendering the whole region\r\nuntenable by Chinese troops.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. KOREAN IMBROGLIO, 1882-1885.\r\n\r\n    Outbreak in 1882--Conspiracy of the king's father--Attack on\r\n    Japanese legation--Chinese troops control the capital--Foreign\r\n    innovations--Brought bad elements to the surface--Conspiracy\r\n    in 1884--Assassinations--Treachery of king's confidant--Kim\r\n    Ok Kun's escape to Japan--The avenger--His elaborate\r\n    preparations--Assassination of Kim--Joy in the Korean\r\n    Court--Honours to the assassin--Japan dissatisfied--Count Ito's\r\n    mission--Japan secures equal rights with China in Korea.\r\n\r\nThe Russian question settled, China had leisure to attend to Korean\r\naffairs, of which the importance was becoming more and more clear to her\r\nstatesmen. The scare on the north-west was in another form transferred\r\nto the north-east, where there was the double risk of complications\r\narising from both Russian and Japanese encroachment on Korea. The opening\r\nof the country to foreign intercourse, intended as a protection against\r\nsuch dangers, was soon discovered to be inadequate. A procession of\r\nevents, dating from the signing of the treaties and culminating in 1885,\r\ntransformed the kingdom from a vassal to a quasi-independent State.\r\n\r\nThe first link in the chain, so far as visible effects were concerned,\r\nwas an _émeute_ which took place in Söul in 1882. The father of the\r\nking had occupied a position as regent curiously resembling that of the\r\nEmpress-Dowager of China, and being ambitious to regain the authority\r\nwhich he had laid down on the king's coming of age, raised a conspiracy\r\nto depose him. In connection with the plot a mob was let loose on the\r\nJapanese legation, where a desperate struggle ensued, in which, and\r\nin the running fight which they made towards the seaport, a number of\r\nJapanese were killed. The survivors were conveyed to Nagasaki in a British\r\nship-of-war. What provocation the Japanese had given for this savage\r\nonslaught is not a matter on which we need enter. The point is that it\r\nafforded justification for sharp reprisals. Perceiving this, and being in\r\na position of unaccustomed preparedness, the Chinese Government--that is\r\nto say, Li Hung-chang--adopted prompt measures for anticipating action\r\non the part of the Japanese. They despatched an envoy with a body of\r\ntroops and a naval squadron to the seaport of the capital where they at\r\nonce put down the conspiracy, re-established the king's authority, and by\r\na clever but wonderfully common oriental ruse captured the Usurper, and\r\ncarried him off to China as a State prisoner. The Chinese troops remained\r\nin the vicinity of the capital, and a Resident on the Indian pattern was\r\ninstalled at the Korean Court.\r\n\r\nBefore long a foreign element began to be introduced into the Korean\r\nadministration. Among other things a branch of the Chinese customs service\r\nwas established, and, as in China, many duties besides that of raising a\r\nrevenue soon claimed the attention of the foreign commissioner. No more\r\neffective first step in the regeneration of such a country could have\r\nbeen undertaken than an honest administration of its maritime revenue. It\r\nwas a measure both good in itself and prolific of beneficial results in\r\nmany directions. Other reforms, however, were projected which required\r\na certain preparation of the soil and a careful consideration of social\r\nforces and conditions. The introduction of foreign ideas of any kind into\r\na country which, so far as politics were concerned, might be considered\r\nvirgin soil, was, to say the least, a hazardous experiment. Undigested\r\nschemes for the Europeanisation or the Japonisation of a Government which\r\nhad up till then banished foreign intercourse entirely from its shores\r\nwas likely to have an effect analogous to that of suddenly administering\r\nstrong meat to the victim of protracted privation. Korean affairs were\r\neven less understood by foreigners than Western affairs were by the\r\nKoreans, so that the yeast thrown into the Korean dough produced risings\r\nfor which Western foreigners at least, whatever may be said of the\r\nJapanese, were quite unprepared. Factions sprang up like fungoid growths\r\nin an excavation, sordid ambitions were set in motion, and the royal Court\r\nbecame a hotbed of intrigue towards which the most flagitious elements in\r\nthe capital were naturally drawn.\r\n\r\nThe agitation which was fed from these various sources broke out into\r\nopen violence in 1884, when two of the king's Ministers were assassinated\r\nby a band of conspirators. It would be futile to attempt to unravel the\r\nplot; its visible consequences only need be considered as further links in\r\nthe chain of events, and also as affording some curious evidence of the\r\nmanner in which the new alien civilisation was beginning to adapt itself\r\nto that which was ingrained in the Korean character. The professed object\r\nof the plot was understood to be the severance of the Chinese tie through\r\nthe instrumentality of the Japanese, and the king himself was believed\r\nto be privy to this scheme. It is probable that the high political and\r\npatriotic ideal was but the rallying flag under which diverse schemers\r\nmight pursue their several ambitions. The Koreans are credited with a\r\nspecial dose of the subtlety which belongs to Asiatic races, and whatever\r\nthe real intentions of the king may have been, the conspirators were false\r\nto him. A concise contemporary account of the fray given in a message to\r\nthe 'Times' states that--\r\n\r\n    The rising against the King of Korea is the outcome of reactionary\r\n    intrigues similar to the movement in 1882, when the present\r\n    king's father was captured and taken as a State prisoner to\r\n    China. Defective accounts only have been received of the recent\r\n    events. On the night of December 4, during an entertainment,\r\n    there was an alarm of fire near the palace; Min chong ik, the\r\n    queen's nephew, who was recently travelling in Europe, rushed\r\n    out, met some assassins, and was stabbed, with many others. The\r\n    conspirators then attacked the king, who applied to the Japanese\r\n    Minister for the protection of his guard. Before morning six of\r\n    the Ministers were killed. On the 6th the Koreans again attacked\r\n    the palace, the Chinese troops being present. A fight ensued, and\r\n    the Japanese guard lost three men killed and five wounded. Being\r\n    overpowered, the Japanese abandoned the palace, retiring to the\r\n    Japanese Legation, the king being carried off by the Chinese. The\r\n    tumult increased, and thirty Japanese residents were massacred\r\n    by the Chinese. On the 7th the Korean mob attacked the Japanese\r\n    Legation, which was destroyed, and the Minister with his guard\r\n    forced his way out amid showers of missiles. They stormed the\r\n    gates and retreated to the seaport of Chemulpo. On the following\r\n    day the king sent friendly messages to the Japanese Minister.\r\n\r\n    At a recent date the Chinese garrison consisted nominally of 3000\r\n    men, but the force has been much depleted. The Japanese numbered\r\n    120, and these were about to be withdrawn when the outbreak\r\n    occurred. The situation is critical, each side accusing the other\r\n    of aggression; but it is expected that the affair will be settled\r\n    amicably, neither Power desiring a quarrel for the benefit of\r\n    interested spectators. The Japanese may insist on steps being\r\n    taken to secure their Minister for the future from such outrages.\r\n    Each Power has appointed an officer to investigate the facts\r\n    before deciding on a definite course. Further complications are,\r\n    however, certain to arise from the anomalous position of Korea.\r\n    After the Kuldja scare China perceived the supreme strategic\r\n    importance of the peninsula, and that a great Power occupying it\r\n    would control Chinese external policy. The Government promoted\r\n    the foreign treaties in 1882 with the objects of interesting the\r\n    commercial Powers in the integrity of Korea, and of obtaining a\r\n    recognition of its vassalage. Later treaties, beginning with that\r\n    negotiated by Sir Harry Parkes last year, assumed the independence\r\n    of Korea. The exercise of Chinese sovereignty is exposing Korea\r\n    to the double peril of her own troubles and of China's possible\r\n    wavering at a critical moment. The Chinese and Korean interests\r\n    are, in the absence of commerce, purely political, Korea's\r\n    importance consisting in its commanding position.\r\n\r\nAnd the Japanese shortly after tabulated the casualties as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Seven officials killed by progressives, 7 progressives killed\r\n    by Korean troops, 38 Korean soldiers killed by Japanese troops,\r\n    95 rioters killed by Japanese, 67 progressives imprisoned, 11\r\n    beheaded, with shocking barbarities at execution.\r\n\r\nThe immediate purpose of the leaders of the plot appears to have been to\r\ndestroy the influence of the powerful family to which the queen belonged,\r\nand had they contented themselves with the murder of any number of that\r\nfamily, it was not considered likely that either king or people would have\r\ngreatly deplored the crime. But the chief assassin, Kim Ok Kun, struck at\r\nthe two Ministers who were the king's right hand, and who had, moreover,\r\nendeared themselves to the nation by the exceptional purity of their\r\npublic life and their beneficence in times of scarcity. Execrated alike\r\nby the sovereign and his people, Kim Ok Kun sought an asylum in Japan,\r\nwhere he was entertained for a number of years while engaged in hatching\r\nfurther plots against the peace of his native land.\r\n\r\nNaturally his presence in Japan caused umbrage to China. The King of Korea\r\nlived in terror of his machinations, for Kim had a considerable following,\r\nby whose aid he hoped to make a descent on Korea and effect a revolution\r\nin the government. The guilt of Kim Ok Kun's betrayal of his sovereign was\r\nthe more heinous from his having been confidential adviser to the Crown\r\nduring all the negotiations with foreigners, between whom and the king\r\nhe was the constant referee. He carried into exile the innermost royal\r\nsecrets. The king's resentment against Kim was naturally embittered by\r\nhis impotence to avenge the treachery to which he had been a victim.\r\n\r\nFor the preservation of peace and of friendly relations an agreement\r\nwas entered into between the three Governments to the effect that Kim\r\nshould not be permitted to leave Japan for any other country excepting\r\nChina or the United States. On these conditions the refugee became an\r\nembarrassment to the Government of Japan, which felt bound to protect him\r\nagainst counterplots while preventing him from carrying out his seditious\r\ndesigns. Nevertheless Nemesis was on the track of the assassin, and the\r\nway in which the quarry was hunted down by the avenger of blood affords\r\na greater insight into the nature of the tragedy than do any of the\r\ncontemporary comments. It also serves to illustrate certain points in the\r\nKorean character which are decidedly not without interest to students of\r\ncurrent history.\r\n\r\nA member of an important Korean family named Hong had been implicated\r\nin Kim's conspiracy, and by Korean law his whole family were held guilty\r\nof the treason. The king fully exonerated the head of the family, being\r\nconvinced that no blame attached to him personally. Nevertheless, the old\r\nman was so dejected by the disgrace brought on his name, that he forthwith\r\npoisoned himself with his whole house. A young man distantly connected\r\nwith the family of Hong, and bearing their surname, took upon himself the\r\nduty of avenging these deaths, and set to work in a systematic manner to\r\ncompass the murder of Kim. The private vengeance of Hong-tjyong-on fitted\r\nin well with his patriotic duty, and his scheme was favoured by the Korean\r\nking. About three years after Kim's flight, Hong made his way to Japan,\r\nbearing secret letters from the king outlawing Kim and his followers and\r\nauthorising their capture or assassination. Hong's plan was to ingratiate\r\nhimself with Kim as a supporter of his schemes, but his recent arrival\r\ndirect from Korea without any credentials from the revolutionary party in\r\nthat country rendered Kim suspicious of the would-be recruit. Unable to\r\ngain the access which he required to the person of his victim, Hong saw\r\nthat he would have to adopt more elaborate means to effect his purpose. He\r\nwent therefore to Europe, where he must have spent five or six years at\r\nleast in acquiring a European education, European manners, and a perfect\r\nknowledge of European ways. He was courteous, refined, and intelligent,\r\na great favourite in society (especially in religious circles), and made\r\nin particular many warm friends in France. Having thoroughly shaken off\r\nKorea, he thought he might now present himself in Japan in a character\r\nthat would disarm all suspicion. Accordingly he made his way thither, and\r\nsucceeded in attaching himself to Kim, talked progress and revolution, and\r\nthereby insinuated himself into the confidence of the arch-conspirator,\r\nbecoming gradually master of his secret plots and schemes. The\r\narrangements of the Japanese Government for the protection of Kim's person\r\nseem to have been so efficient that, in order to accomplish his purpose,\r\nHong perceived that it was necessary to induce Kim to leave Japan. This\r\nseemed the most difficult part of his enterprise, and a far-fetched scheme\r\nhad to be contrived in order to furnish Kim with a plausible reason for\r\nproceeding to China. Between the plots which Kim may have had in his mind\r\nand those which Hong for his own purposes suggested to him, it is not\r\npossible, neither is it necessary, to distinguish. Hong's own account of\r\nthe matter was, that Kim had been concerting some movement on Korea from\r\na Russian base, but was prevented from proceeding to Vladivostock by the\r\nvigilance of the Japanese Government. The agreement between the three\r\nPowers would not, however, be violated by his proceeding to Shanghai,\r\nwhere he would find the means of continuing his voyage to Vladivostock,\r\nfor neither of the travellers apprehended any difficulty in eluding the\r\nsurveillance of the Chinese officials and taking passage in a trading\r\nsteamer to the Russian port.\r\n\r\nKim eventually fell in with this proposal, and left Japan with a Japanese\r\nservant, accompanied by Hong. They arrived in Shanghai on the 27th of\r\nMarch 1894, repaired to a Japanese hotel, and reported themselves at the\r\nJapanese consulate. The following day Hong, having first put on Korean\r\nupper garments, murdered Kim, and fled, but was captured at Wusung by the\r\nforeign municipal police of Shanghai, and by them detained in custody\r\nuntil claimed by the Chinese authorities under instructions from Li\r\nHung-chang. The news of the assassination was received by the Chinese\r\nGovernment with a sense of relief and \"sombre acquiescence,\" but at the\r\nKorean Court with almost a frenzy of delight. The king gave a banquet in\r\nhonour of the event, to which he invited all the foreign Ministers. The\r\nChinese Government ordered a man-of-war to convey the murderer and the\r\nremains of the victim to Korea. The former was covered with honours, while\r\nthe remains of Kim were treated with savage indecency and his family put\r\nto death.\r\n\r\nThus did the assassin of 1884 expiate his crime exactly ten years later.\r\n\r\nThe issue of the plot of 1884 was not agreeable to the Japanese, who were\r\nparticularly affronted by the fact that the Chinese were in a position to\r\nsnatch the king out of their hands and to afford him military protection\r\nagainst all comers. But Japan was in no humour to relinquish her own\r\npolicy in Korea, which was quite incompatible with the suzerain status\r\nof China, and with the very concrete form in which it had just been\r\nmanifested. One of the leading statesmen of Japan, Count Inouye, was sent\r\nto Korea to investigate the whole affair, and inquire into the relative\r\nposition of China and Japan in the peninsula. The result of his inquiries\r\nwas a determination to follow up by orthodox diplomacy the disintegrating\r\neffects which the risings in 1882 and 1884 had no doubt been intended\r\nto subserve. China being in the throes of a war with France, the moment\r\nwas particularly favourable for preferring demands upon her. An embassy\r\nwas therefore despatched to Peking, under Count Ito, in March 1885. He\r\ncounted much on the friendly offices of the British Minister, Sir Harry\r\nParkes, in smoothing the way to amicable negotiations with China, but\r\nunhappily the Japanese ambassador arrived at Peking almost on the day of\r\nSir Harry's death. After vain attempts to deal with the Tsungli-Yamên the\r\nJapanese mission withdrew to Tientsin, where negotiations were entered\r\ninto by Li Hung-chang, extending over several weeks. Count Ito's mission\r\nwas successful in concluding a treaty by which China and Japan were put\r\non a footing of equality in the peninsula so far as regards military\r\nprotection. The troops of both countries were to be withdrawn, and neither\r\nparty was to send a force in future without giving written notice to the\r\nother. This arrangement was a surrender in substance of China's suzerainty\r\nover Korea, though she retained the ceremonial form in full vigour for\r\nnine years after.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE PORT HAMILTON EPISODE, 1885-1887.\r\n\r\n    Sudden occupation of Korean harbour by Great Britain--Questioned\r\n    by China, Japan, and Korea--Position condemned by naval\r\n    authority--Abandoned on guarantee from China against occupation\r\n    by other Powers.\r\n\r\n\"In view of potentialities\" the British Government on April 14, 1885,\r\nsent instructions to Vice-Admiral Dowell to occupy Port Hamilton, an\r\nisland harbour on the coast of Korea. This high-handed proceeding was\r\njustified on the plea of necessity--the necessity, as explained by Lord\r\nGranville, of anticipating the \"probable occupation of the island by\r\nanother Power.\" Naturally the measure disturbed neighbouring States,\r\nas well as the Government of Korea itself. China and Japan asked for\r\nexplanations, and an agreement with the former, as suzerain of Korea, was\r\nabout to be signed for the temporary use of the harbour by Great Britain,\r\nwhen the Russian Minister at Peking interposed with an intimation that\r\nif China consented to the occupation of Port Hamilton by Great Britain,\r\nRussia would compensate herself by the seizure of some other point of the\r\nKorean littoral. The protest of the Korean Government thus became merged\r\nin negotiations with China, but was never withdrawn.\r\n\r\nWhile these _pour-parlers_ were going on, the position of Port Hamilton\r\nwas unequivocally condemned as a naval station by a succession of three\r\nadmirals commanding the China Squadron; and as the immediate occasion\r\nof the occupation of the harbour had happily passed, there remained\r\nno ostensible reason for prolonging it. Before abandoning the island,\r\nhowever, the British Government hoped that some arrangement might be\r\ncome to for an international guarantee of the integrity of Korea, which\r\nbeing already a bone of contention between certain Powers, and unable\r\nto defend its own independence, constituted a constant menace to the\r\npeace of the Far East. The proposal met with no favour from the Chinese\r\nGovernment, for the reason probably that it would have involved an organic\r\nchange in its own relations with Korea. The next proposal came from the\r\nKorean Government itself, which suggested a _modus vivendi_ by opening\r\nas treaty ports both Port Hamilton and Port Lazareff, which latter was\r\nthe point Russia would have seized if she had seized anything. This\r\nidea was approved of by the British Government, but nothing came of it.\r\nEventually the evacuation was agreed to on the assurance from China that\r\nneither Port Hamilton nor any other portion of Korean territory would in\r\nfuture be occupied by any other Power. This pledge China was enabled to\r\ngive on the strength of an equivalent guarantee which she had received\r\nfrom Russia, that Power being then the only one considered as likely to\r\ncherish aggressive designs on the Korean peninsula. These engagements were\r\nexchanged in November 1886, eighteen months after the occupation, and the\r\nBritish flag was finally hauled down on the island on February 27, 1887.\r\n\r\nThe net visible result of the incident was to confirm China in her\r\nsuzerainty, since the negotiations were made with her and not with Korea,\r\nand to obtain a specific pledge from Russia that she would keep her hands\r\noff Korea \"under any circumstances.\" It was argued seven years afterwards\r\nthat Russia had broken her pledge by her interferences in Korean affairs,\r\nbut in 1895 a new state of circumstances had been brought about. China in\r\nthat year ceased to be the suzerain of Korea, and obligations which were\r\nvalid under the old _régime_ necessarily lapsed. A new page of history was\r\nturned, and Korea attained the status of a nominally independent kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. TIBET.\r\n\r\n    Lhassa visited by Babu Sarat Chandra Das--Proposed commercial\r\n    expedition--Originated by Secretary of State--Envoy sent to\r\n    Peking to obtain passport--Opposition organised by Chinese and\r\n    Tibetans--Mission withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe year 1885 witnessed the first act in the ill-advised policy--as to its\r\nmethod, not its object--of the Indian Government of opening commercial\r\nrelations with Tibet. A learned Bengali pandit, versed in Tibetan, had\r\nmade two successful visits to Lhassa, where he gained the friendship\r\nof the lamas, who invited him to come again. A fair prospect of opening\r\ncommercial relations by gradually disarming prejudices and apprehension\r\nwas thus presented. Having duly reported his experiences to the Government\r\nof India, the babu waited their pleasure as to further developments at\r\nDarjeeling, where he occupied the post of Government schoolmaster. An\r\nEnglish civilian, making the acquaintance of the babu in that hot-weather\r\nretreat, conceived the idea of an official mission to Lhassa, in which\r\nthe services of the babu might be utilised as guide and interpreter. The\r\nIndian Government was averse from the enterprise on economical if on no\r\nother grounds, but direct pressure being brought to bear on the India\r\nOffice in London, the ambitious young statesman who then presided over its\r\ncounsels is said to have espoused the proposal and overruled the reluctant\r\nGovernment of India.\r\n\r\nOf the organisation and procedure of the mission nothing very\r\ncomplimentary can be said. Instead of following the line of least\r\nresistance, of driving in the thin end of the wedge, in accordance with\r\nthe commonplace maxims consecrated by all human experience, the reverse\r\nprocess was followed in every single particular. Sarat Chandra Das had\r\nshown the way, and the entry he had effected could have been gradually\r\nwidened by himself and others of his own class until the obstacles to free\r\ncommercial intercourse had been overcome. The experience of a hundred\r\nyears had shown to the world the invincible prejudices of the Tibetan\r\nrulers against foreign visitors. The babu had in his own person conquered\r\nthese prejudices by his mastery of Buddhistic lore, as well as by his\r\ngentleness and consummate tact; but the mission, which had its origin\r\nin the information he supplied, discarded his methods and proceeded on\r\nmilitary lines. Its _personnel_ included politicals and scientists, but\r\nno commercial agent, and as Mr Gundry has well said, \"The Under Secretary\r\nof State, while stating that the object of the mission was to confer with\r\nthe Chinese commissioners and the Lhassa Government as to the resumption\r\nof commercial relations between India and Tibet,\" added in Parliament\r\nthat, \"looking to the delicate nature of the mission, it had not been\r\nthought advisable to appoint a special commercial representative.\" An\r\narmed force of some 300 men sent on a \"delicate mission\" which, though\r\nessentially commercial, yet had nothing commercial in its composition!\r\nCould anything be conceived more certain to arouse the sleeping suspicions\r\nof the Tibetans? It was but repeating on a larger scale the deplorable\r\nfiasco of Colonel Browne's attempted march from Burma to China in 1875.\r\n\r\nThe first act in this little drama was performed in Peking when the envoy,\r\nMacaulay, arrived with his staff for the ostensible purpose of applying\r\nfor a passport for Tibet. For such a purpose there was no need to have\r\nsent a special messenger to Peking at all, as a passport could have been\r\nmuch more easily obtained by the British Minister there and transmitted\r\nby post in the ordinary course of business. The passport could not, of\r\ncourse, be refused in plain terms by the Chinese Government, but the\r\npersonal demand for it gave them the opportunity of cross-examining the\r\nintended envoy as to the objects of his proposed mission. It may well\r\nbe believed, from the self-contradictory explanation of the mission\r\ntendered to the British Parliament, that the envoy in Peking failed to\r\nallay the suspicions of the Chinese Government. On the contrary, his\r\npresence intensified them exceedingly. The sole effect of the preliminary\r\nexpedition to Peking was, in fact, to forewarn the Chinese Government,\r\nso that they, in concert with the rulers of Tibet, should be prepared to\r\ninterpose obstacles to the advance of the mission, but in such a way as\r\nnot openly to compromise the good faith of the Chinese Government. The\r\njourney of the envoy to Peking, therefore, sealed the fate of his own\r\nmission, and at the same time closed Tibet against more judicious advances\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting episode in connection with this abortive effort\r\nwas the appearance of the Babu Sarat Chandra Das himself in the Chinese\r\ncapital. By sheer force of intellect he succeeded in a few days in\r\nobtaining the confidence of the inner circle of the lamas there. Having\r\nbeen brought in contact with a certain Manchu official, the pandit\r\nshowed very unobtrusively a familiarity with the more recondite tenets of\r\nBuddhism which captivated the Manchu, whose heart was set on improving\r\nhis knowledge of the sacred mysteries.[24] The babu could speak no\r\nChinese, but it was not difficult among the thousands of lamas in Peking\r\nto find a competent Tibetan interpreter. The fame of the pandit spread\r\nrapidly among the ranks of the priesthood, whose chiefs competed for the\r\nhonour of sitting at the feet of the Indian Gamaliel. In expounding the\r\ndoctrines, while enjoying the hospitality, of different groups of lamas,\r\nthe popularity of the pandit grew from day to day, until he was at length\r\nconstrained to take up his quarters at the great Yellow Temple, outside\r\nthe north wall of Peking, and live with the brethren. They invested him\r\nwith the yellow robe and the other ecclesiastical insignia, and treated\r\nhim altogether as one of the initiated. It required all his acumen to\r\nprevent his status as a Buddhist lama from clashing with his position as\r\na subordinate of the Indian envoy, on whom he was in attendance. He had\r\nto pay frequent visits to the British Legation, where it would have been\r\nimpossible for him to appear in his religious vestments without exciting\r\ninconvenient gossip, and perhaps incurring the disapproval of his superior\r\nofficer. The custom of travelling in Peking in closed carts enabled the\r\nbabu to play the double part of Jekyll and Hyde with perfect success.\r\nHe would leave the Temple as a lama, drive to a friend's rooms in the\r\ncity, where his Indian costume was kept ready, in which he proceeded in\r\nanother cab and in another character to the British Legation, returning\r\nto reassume his yellow robes and then repair to the Temple.\r\n\r\nDuring the time when the envoy designate remained in Peking a very high\r\npersonage arrived from Tibet, and it was on his conferences with the\r\nChinese Court that the success of the intended mission depended. It would\r\nbe presumptuous on the part of any foreigner to attempt to divine what\r\npassed between the delegate from the Grand Lama and the Chinese Ministers;\r\nbut were it possible for any one to penetrate into those secret counsels,\r\nthe babu was the man to do it. There is no doubt that he did. In fact,\r\nhe had positive information that the Indian mission to Tibet would be\r\nstopped at the instance of the Chinese Government, and that the issue\r\nof the passport was an empty form. Such information would naturally be\r\nunwelcome to the envoy, and the sequel seems to show that the warning\r\nwas disregarded. The expedition was organised, fully equipped, ready\r\nfor a march into Tibet. Had it proceeded it is highly improbable that\r\nthe babu would have accompanied it as interpreter, for he could not have\r\nexonerated himself from the imputation of bad faith towards his Tibetan\r\nhosts in acting as guide to an armed force into a country where he had\r\nbeen received and reinvited as a private guest.\r\n\r\nWhat would have been the consequence of the mission proceeding into Tibet\r\nit is, of course, impossible to say, but the circumstances of its recall\r\nwere not conducive to satisfactory relations between China and Great\r\nBritain. Mistrusting the effectiveness of the Tibetan opposition to the\r\nIndian mission--for the force could very likely have made good its passage\r\nto Lhassa--the Chinese Government resorted to diplomatic means of stopping\r\nits advance. Its never-failing emergency man, the Inspector-General of\r\nCustoms, was called upon, and he intervened with the British Government\r\nwith such good effect that they sent orders to India to stop the Tibetan\r\nmission. Thus the Indian Government was a second time overruled: first,\r\nin being made to organise the mission against its will; and secondly, in\r\nbeing forced to recall it when its recall involved immeasurable loss of\r\ninfluence in future dealings with China. An attempt was made to cover the\r\nretreat in a cloud of verbiage by a convention signed at Peking in 1886,\r\nwhich, however, only made the case worse, in that it was a retrograde\r\nstep, virtually cancelling the right of visiting Tibet, which had been\r\nconferred by the Chefoo convention of ten years before. The same treaty\r\nwhich embodied this renunciation, perhaps the weakest to which any British\r\nrepresentative ever set his name, also fostered the illusions which have\r\nbeen so detrimental to the welfare of China, by promising a continuance of\r\nthe tribute missions from Burma after that country had become an integral\r\npart of the Indian Empire.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of this diplomatic surrender were not long in showing\r\nthemselves, for it was soon followed by an invasion of British Sikkim\r\nfrom the Tibetan side. This aggression of the lamas was of necessity\r\nresisted by the Indian Government, and an unexpected opportunity was\r\nthus offered to them of settling the whole Tibetan question by the rapid\r\nmarch of a small force to Lhassa. There is good reason to believe that\r\nthis solution of the difficulty was the one which commended itself to the\r\npractical statesmen and soldiers of India; but their action was paralysed\r\nby the orders of the Home Government, which continued to be ruled by\r\ninfluences which were neither military nor political nor practical.\r\nDiscussions between the Indian Government and the Chinese _amban_ or\r\nResident at Lhassa, professing to speak for the Tibetan Lama Government,\r\nwere protracted year after year, and seemed interminable. At last even\r\nthe Chinese themselves grew weary of the comedy, and experienced in Tibet\r\nsomething of the difficulty which occasionally beset them in China--that\r\nis to say, they were unable to exorcise the demon they had invoked. They\r\nhad stirred up the Tibetans to the point of obstructing the Macaulay\r\nmission, but seemed really to lose control of the force after it had been\r\nset in motion. After some years of futile talk the statesmen of China\r\nwould perhaps have hailed with satisfaction the advance of a British force\r\nto Lhassa to cut the Gordian knot; but they dared not, of course, give\r\nsuch a hint as was conveyed to Captain Fournier, \"Avancez donc,\"[25] and\r\nthe Indian Government, not having the wit to divine it, had to submit to\r\na long-drawn-out and permanent humiliation, that was in no wise mended\r\nby the Calcutta convention of 1890, which, professing only to settle the\r\nexisting frontiers, did not even settle them.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE CRUISE OF THE SEVENTH PRINCE, 1886.\r\n\r\n    Character and position of Prince Ch'un--Had been misunderstood by\r\n    foreigners while he was in seclusion--An amiable and progressive\r\n    man--His visit to Port Arthur in 1886--Intercourse with many\r\n    foreigners.\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1884 witnessed a ministerial crisis of the first order\r\nin Peking. For twenty-four years Prince Kung, uncle to the deceased\r\nemperor Tungchih, had held a position equivalent to Chancellor of the\r\nempire. To the outside world he was only known as Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and head of the Tsungli-Yamên. During the greater part of the\r\ntime he had been at feud with the empress-regent, from whom his power\r\nwas derived, but, being indispensable to her, he was tolerated for want\r\nof a competent successor. The troubles in Tongking caused an agitation\r\nin the capital, and the empress seized the opportunity to dismiss Prince\r\nKung with most of his colleagues of the Yamên and introduce a fresh set.\r\nThe eminent position of the prince, however, was one difficult to fill;\r\nbut the substitution was effected by a kind of _coup d'état_ by which the\r\nempress brought the younger brother of Prince Kung out of his retirement\r\nand made him virtually, as far as it was possible, her coadjutor in the\r\nGovernment. But the peculiar status of Prince Ch'un, as father to the\r\nreigning emperor, rendered him immune from responsibility, since in China\r\nthe son could not place the father under discipline. For this reason the\r\nprince could not in his own name exercise any of the great functions of\r\nthe State. He was therefore obliged to keep in the background, while the\r\nexecutive service was performed by his nominees. Thus in foreign affairs\r\nhe was efficiently represented by the Grand Secretary Li Hung-chang, and\r\nby Prince Ch'ing, a junior member of the imperial family, who was made\r\npresident of the Tsungli-Yamên, and holds the office to the present day.\r\n\r\nWhatever the true motives may have been for recasting the\r\nTsungli-Yamên--and it would be hazardous for any foreigner to dogmatise\r\nabout such matters--a great improvement was remarked in the efficiency of\r\nthat body. Prince Ch'ing, though new to public affairs, acquitted himself\r\nlike a gentleman, and gained the goodwill of all the foreign Legations by\r\nhis laborious efforts to learn his work and to bring justice and reason\r\nas well as courtesy into the transaction of business. The circumstances\r\nof the time were also favourable to improvement; for being at war with\r\none great Power, China was naturally most anxious to conciliate the\r\nothers. While this amenable temper lasted, business was despatched by\r\nthe Tsungli-Yamên with a celerity never before known, and good use was\r\nmade of the opportunity to clear off legacies of arrears that had been\r\naccumulating in the foreign legations.\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Prince, so long as he was in seclusion, had stood in the\r\nopinion of foreigners for everything that was fanatical, obstructive,\r\nand irreconcilable, the head of the war party, and so forth. Even Sir\r\nRutherford Alcock, in an article on Chinese Statesmen in 1871, adopted\r\nthis popular estimate, calling him \"violently hostile, joining with Wo in\r\nall efforts to make the anti-foreign faction predominate.\"\r\n\r\nThe announcement of Prince Ch'un, therefore, as the successor of Prince\r\nKung not unnaturally aroused apprehension of a reactionary policy.\r\nHis first public act, however, in so far as it was his, dispelled the\r\nmisconception under which foreigners had been labouring for many years:\r\nit was to conclude a peace with France in the face of a rabid opposition.\r\nThis misconception of Prince Ch'un's character and policy is only an\r\nexample of how vain it is for foreigners to attempt to sound the currents\r\nof Chinese politics, more especially where palace factions are concerned.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the Seventh Prince having removed all friction between the\r\nempress-regent and the Government, it was a signal for tentative reforms\r\nand what foreigners call progress. Li Hung-chang had to a considerable\r\nextent imbued the Court with his own ideas. He assured them there was no\r\ndanger in adopting foreign methods and foreign manners,--on the contrary,\r\nthat to do so was the only means of safety to the empire. Within a few\r\nmonths of his taking the reins, the Prince established a precedent which\r\namounted to a small revolution in its way. He began to transact business\r\nthrough his agents with foreigners in the capital itself, which had been\r\nup to that time strictly preserved from all contamination of foreign\r\ntrade. The two \"stores\" which existed were not traders by right, but\r\nwere under the special protection of certain foreign Ministers, who had\r\nrepresented to the Government the necessity of such agencies for the\r\nsupply of necessaries for the use of their Legations. This was followed\r\nin course of time by the introduction of novelties in the palace, such\r\nas electric light, toy railways and steam launches in the imperial\r\npleasure-grounds. The telegraph wire itself was introduced into the city\r\nduring the summer of 1884, it having been previously jealously kept at\r\na distance of thirteen miles, from superstitious fears concerning the\r\nsinister influence which the electric wire might exert over the fortunes\r\nof the capital. However real such fears may be in the minds of the\r\nChinese, and however convenient they may be as a defence against proposals\r\nfrom without, they invariably yield to the pressure of necessity. While\r\nthe terminus of the telegraph line was at Tungchow, the inconvenience of\r\nhaving to send mounted messengers thirteen miles to despatch and receive\r\nmessages was for some time felt almost entirely by the foreign Legations;\r\nbut when the war crisis with France arose, and the Chinese Government\r\nitself was sending urgent messages requiring immediate answers to the\r\nsouthern provinces and to Europe, the absurdity of losing more time\r\nbetween the Tsungli-Yamên and the telegraph station than was occupied\r\nby the transmission of the message and its reply from Europe became so\r\nstriking, that the order was given to bring the telegraph into the city.\r\nNo more was heard of geomantic difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe most important object, however, which Li Hung-chang sought to gain\r\nthrough the activity of the Seventh Prince, was so to interest his\r\nHighness in the scheme of national defence, which had been growing under\r\nthe viceroy's initiative, that this department of the work of Government\r\nshould be transformed from a provincial to an imperial concern. With this\r\nend in view an expedition on salt water was arranged for the Prince; and\r\ninsignificant as the feat must appear in Western eyes, yet for a Manchu\r\nprince, who had never seen the sea, to be allowed to trust himself on the\r\ntreacherous element at all, or on such a strange monster as a steamer,\r\nmust be accepted as a decided proof that the old order was changing,\r\ngiving place to the new. The prince was undoubtedly nervous, not knowing\r\nwhat should befall him on his expedition.\r\n\r\nThe first ordeal through which he had to pass was that of personal\r\ncontact with foreigners, of whom he had perhaps never seen one in\r\nPeking. His introduction was carefully organised by Li Hung-chang, and\r\nit was at Tientsin that the prince first met with foreign officials,\r\nwho waited upon him at separate audiences. The foreigners were as much\r\ncharmed with his Highness as he expressed himself to have been with them,\r\nso that he embarked on his cruise free from anxiety. His attendants,\r\nhowever,--on whom and on Li Hung-chang all the responsibility of course\r\nrested,--continued to feel anxious during their passage across the Gulf.\r\nThis feeling became for a moment acute when, on landing at Port Arthur,\r\nthey were met by a British admiral and staff with a guard of honour. It\r\nis an actual fact that the sight of strange armed men waiting for the\r\nprince, working on oriental traditions, did suggest a trap, for the idea\r\nof capture by treachery is never wholly absent from the Chinese mind. The\r\nGovernment had taken the wise precaution of attaching to the prince an\r\nexperienced and capable foreigner in whom he reposed perfect confidence,\r\nand Mr Detring explained foreign customs and forms of courtesy to the\r\nprince and his suite in a way which completely reassured them. Among all\r\nthe dignitaries in the prince's suite, however, there was not one capable\r\nof taking in the entirely novel ideas which were presented to them. One\r\nman only, of quite subordinate rank--whether a Manchu or a Chinese by\r\nbirth is unknown to the writer--a confidential agent of the Seventh Prince\r\nin business matters, seized the entire programme of foreign etiquette the\r\nmoment it was explained to him, and through him the whole ceremony passed\r\nsmoothly and agreeably to all parties. The name of this official was Chang\r\nYi, who has since been taking a leading part in mining, railway, and other\r\nprogressive enterprises in China.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Peking Prince Ch'un in a memorial to the Throne reported\r\nfully the incidents of his cruise to the gulf ports. Not long after a\r\nnaval board was established in Peking, with the prince at its head. As a\r\nstep in the direction of centralising the naval authority, which included\r\nalso the direction of the land defences, the establishment of a Board\r\nof Admiralty in the capital was certainly a progressive one; but as its\r\nmembers possessed neither knowledge nor experience of naval or military\r\naffairs its authority was much attenuated, almost every question having\r\nto be referred back to Li Hung-chang in Tientsin. Any chance that might\r\nhave existed of Prince Ch'un himself inspiring the new Board and bringing\r\nit up to a state of efficiency was lost through his Highness falling into\r\nill-health, from which he never recovered, but after a lingering illness\r\ndied in 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE EMPEROR ASSUMES THE GOVERNMENT, 1889.\r\n\r\n    The Emperor Kwanghsu comes of age in 1889--Audience of foreign\r\n    Ministers arranged--Derogatory conditions--Second audience refused\r\n    by Ministers--Accepted by Austrian and British envoys.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 his Majesty Kwanghsu attained his majority and married. But his\r\ncoming of age was a somewhat gradual process, with intervals between\r\neach step, as if the empress-regent, who alone determined the time and\r\nthe seasons, were either mistrustful of the capacity of her nephew\r\nor reluctant to lay down the reins of authority. The emperor, kept\r\nin leading-strings, was allowed to assume some of the functions of an\r\nautocrat, but not all. This slow unfolding of the imperial blossom had\r\nthis result among others, that it procured a welcome respite from the\r\nbitter ordeal of granting an audience to the representatives of foreign\r\nStates. It was well understood that the foreigners had for sixteen years\r\nbeen looking forward to the emperor's assumption of power as to the\r\nconsummation of their diplomatic function, and that as soon as a decent\r\ninterval had been allowed to the young monarch after his majority, the\r\nsubject would become pressing.\r\n\r\nIt had been discussed in whispers for nearly two years, when, to the\r\nastonishment of everybody, including even the members of the Tsungli-Yamên\r\nthemselves, an imperial decree was issued in December 1890 in kindly\r\nterms ordering preparations to be made to receive the foreign Ministers\r\nafter the Chinese New Year--that is, in the February following. Since\r\nnobody owned to having been in the secret, the act was set down to the\r\nemperor's gracious initiative, and was hailed with enthusiasm as the\r\nopening of a new era. The Great Wall had at last fallen; the pretensions\r\nto superiority for which the Chinese had made such great sacrifices were\r\nsuddenly abandoned, and henceforth equality with foreign nations was to\r\nbe the basis of their diplomatic intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe hope was shortlived, for as soon as the details of the imperial\r\nreception came to be arranged with the Tsungli-Yamên all the old\r\ndifficulties appeared in an aggravated form. The foreign ministers, having\r\npondered the question for eighteen years, had unanimously resolved that\r\nthey would not accept an audience in the building used for the reception\r\nof tributary princes, where the ceremony of 1873 had taken place, but only\r\nin the imperial palace, or not at all. The whole value of the audience was\r\nthe acknowledgment it signified of international equality. The idea that\r\nit would facilitate business must have been long before abandoned. The\r\nform, therefore, was everything, and the Chinese Ministers were resolved\r\nthat the \"tributary\" form should be adhered to. They became urgent in\r\ntheir appeals to the reasonableness of the foreign Ministers. They had\r\ngone to expense in renovating the hall, Tz-kwang-ko; they had no other\r\nplace available; the imperial decree must be obeyed, and this admitted of\r\nno postponement.\r\n\r\nYielding to these arguments, the foreign Ministers agreed to a compromise.\r\nThey would, for this time only, repair to the Tz-kwang-ko, but never\r\nagain. The ceremony took place therefore on 5th March 1891. There were\r\ntwo receptions--first an audience to the various foreign Ministers\r\nseparately, next a general reception of the whole of them. The diplomatic\r\nbody soon felt the consequences of their retrograde step, for when they\r\ncame to discuss details of the audience of the following year, the Chinese\r\ninterposed a simple _non possumus_ to every demand which implied the\r\nacknowledgment of equality. A reception within the palace without the\r\n_kotow_ could not even be discussed. No accommodation between the opposing\r\nviews being possible, there was no audience in 1892. The diplomatic\r\nbody were solidly united in maintaining the dignity of their respective\r\ncountries, and by ceasing to solicit, they left the onus of discovering\r\na solution of the question on the Chinese themselves. The audience was of\r\nno practical value to the foreigners, while the withholding of it placed\r\nthe Chinese so much in the wrong that they might safely have been left to\r\ntheir own devices.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, the pressure to extricate themselves and their sovereign\r\nfrom an untenable position had become too severe, a diversion in their\r\nfavour was created by the flying visit of an Austrian envoy, who seemed\r\nready to present his credentials on any terms whatever, so that the\r\nformalities were quickly got over, and he enabled to conclude his mission.\r\nThe Chinese availed themselves of this unexpected opportunity, and the\r\nemperor granted an audience to M. Biegeleben in another hall or pavilion\r\noutside the palace, which thenceforth became known locally as the Palais\r\nBiegeleben.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1892, not long after the Biegeleben incident, a new British\r\nMinister arrived in Peking. Not apparently considering himself bound\r\nby the compact to which his predecessor was a party, he, without the\r\nknowledge of his diplomatic colleagues, accepted an audience on the same\r\nderogatory terms as the Austrian envoy had done, and the reactionary\r\npolicy of the Chinese thus enjoyed a complete, if temporary, triumph. This\r\nproceeding of the British Minister was deeply resented by the diplomatic\r\nbody, most of all by the Russian Minister, Count Cassini, himself a\r\nnew arrival, and the circumstance did not tend to smooth the subsequent\r\nintercourse between the parties.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. THE VISIT OF THE CZAREVITCH, 1891.\r\n\r\n    Worthy reception in Peking impossible--Attempted substitution\r\n    of provincial reception--Czarevitch visits only the Russian\r\n    communities in China.\r\n\r\nClosely connected in point of time, and possibly by a more vital link,\r\nwith the imperial audience was the voyage of the Czarevitch to India,\r\nChina, and Japan in 1890-91. There was no precedent in China for the\r\nreception of the member of any foreign royal family. In the days before\r\nthe first audience the Duke of Edinburgh, while in command of the Galatea,\r\nvisited Peking, but strictly _incognito_, no visits being exchanged with\r\nany Chinese. But times had changed considerably in the twenty years that\r\nhad since elapsed, and with an emperor of full age on the throne things\r\nthat were winked at during his minority could no longer be so lightly\r\ntreated. The Chinese Government were, in fact, perfectly conscious of the\r\nresponsibility which lay upon them to show courtesy to so distinguished a\r\nvisitor as the heir to the throne of Russia, and they took timely measures\r\nfor his reception.\r\n\r\nThe position of the audience question convinced the Ministers that it\r\nwould be impossible to receive him worthily in Peking, since to do so\r\nwould be to admit equality with foreign States. The first care of the\r\nChinese, therefore, was to induce his Imperial Highness to stay away\r\nfrom the capital. The Russian Government were told that Li Hung-chang,\r\nrepresenting the Chinese Emperor, would meet the Czarevitch at Chefoo,\r\nand that his reception by other Governors of provinces would be deemed\r\nequivalent to one by the emperor in person. The Russian Government\r\nfell into the trap, and the programme of provincial receptions would\r\nhave been carried out but for the eccentricity of Chang Chih-tung,\r\nthe governor-general of the Hu provinces on the Yangtze. He, with the\r\nother provincials, had received the instructions about the reception of\r\nthe Czarevitch, but he alone treated the order with contempt, not even\r\ndeigning to answer it or to explain his reason. The order did not emanate\r\nfrom Peking, and he would not accept a mandate from an equal. Evidently\r\nthe emperor had no hand in drawing up the programme, and this Chang had\r\nthe best means of knowing, for he had a brother in the Inner Council. This\r\naction of a high authority throws full light on the difference between an\r\nimperial and a provincial transaction, as the Chinese themselves regard\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with this independent attitude of Chang was the rudeness with\r\nwhich he received the officer deputed by the Russian admiral to arrange\r\ndetails of the reception at Wuchang. In this way the intended imposture\r\nwas exposed. But if the Russian Government had been too easily led into a\r\nfalse position, it must be admitted they extricated themselves cleverly,\r\nby simply demanding a yellow chair for the Czarevitch, a colour reserved\r\nexclusively for the emperor. As this could not be conceded the official\r\nceremonies fell through, and the Czarevitch contented himself with\r\nvisiting the Russian communities at the Chinese ports. He then proceeded\r\nto Japan, where a brilliant reception awaited him; and from Japan to\r\nVladivostock, where he turned the first sod of the Trans-Siberian Railway,\r\n19th May 1891.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [24] See _infra_, p. 343.\r\n\r\n [25] See _infra_, p. 330.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE TONGKING QUARREL.\r\n\r\n    Rapid advance of French towards China proper--The Black\r\n    Flags--Discussions between France and China--Attempted\r\n    negotiations--Conquest of Tongking decided upon--Chinese\r\n    feared attack on Canton--City defenceless--Negotiation with\r\n    France recommended--Captain Fournier concludes convention\r\n    with Li Hung-chang in Tientsin--Strong opposition in the\r\n    capital--Collision between forces in Tongking--French make war\r\n    on China--Peace concluded through customs agency, April 1885--The\r\n    Li-Fournier convention ratified.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe progress of the French in the annexation of Cochin China, Annam, and\r\nTongking was phenomenally rapid. These aggressions on her tributary States\r\nwere far from agreeable to China, but no effective means of resistance was\r\nproposed. The Chinese policy, wrote Sir R. Alcock,[26] \"has been one of\r\ndrift, and letting things slide into irretrievable confusion and disaster\r\nfor want of courage and decisive action at the right time. Between the\r\nDupuis and Garnier expeditions, in which a handful of men were seizing\r\ntowns, storming citadels, and terrorising the Annamite mandarins and\r\nking into virtual submission to any terms dictated to them, and Captain\r\nRivière's very similar proceedings in 1883, there was abundant time and\r\nopportunity for China either to fight or to negotiate with effect, but\r\nshe did neither.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the advance of the French brought them within measurable\r\ndistance of the southern provinces of China proper, a more serious view of\r\nthe invasion was forced upon the Government. A body of irregular troops,\r\ncalled the Black Flags, for some time stood in the way of the French, who\r\ndesignated them \"pirates.\" The status of these Black Flags was, indeed,\r\nsomewhat ambiguous, as they had been virtually outlawed by the Chinese.\r\nBut when it was seen that they were harassing the French, the provincial\r\nauthorities recognised that they were fighting the battle of China and of\r\nher tributary. The Annamese Government had, in the first instance, invited\r\nthe assistance of the Black Flags, and the Chinese Government officially\r\nencouraged them, while hoping to evade direct responsibility for doing so.\r\nThe French had made the useless mistake of wounding China in a tender spot\r\nby destroying the seal granted to the Annamese sovereign by the emperor,\r\nand it was probably this insult rather than the territorial seizures which\r\ninduced China to reinforce the Black Flags by a body of imperial troops,\r\nand to lay down distinctly the line which she would consider herself bound\r\nto defend.\r\n\r\nThe annexation of Annam became the subject of protracted discussions\r\nbetween France and China. The diplomacy of the Marquis Tsêng in Paris,\r\nand of Li Hung-chang in China--a convention had actually been concluded\r\nbetween the latter and the French Minister, Bourrée--failed to arrest the\r\nprogress of France, and the question between the two countries reached\r\na burning point after the capture by the French of Sontay and Bacninh in\r\nthe spring of 1884.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese envoy had declared to M. Ferry that a French advance on these\r\nplaces would be regarded by his Government as a _casus belli_. Seeing,\r\nhowever, that no action was taken by China after their actual capture,\r\nthe French took fresh courage, and their programme of conquest became so\r\nmuch expanded that what had been the dream of a few became the definitive\r\npolicy of the Republic. \"The conquest of Tongking had been decided upon\r\nin principle,\" wrote Admiral Jaurèguiberry to Captain Rivière at the\r\ntime when M. de Freycinet was declaring that there should be no policy\r\nof aggression. The taking of the two citadels sealed the policy of the\r\nadmiral and falsified that of the Foreign Minister. From that point may be\r\ndated the important position which France has since assumed in claiming to\r\ndirect, in conjunction with Russia, the destinies of the Chinese Empire.\r\n\r\nOn the fall of the two cities the Chinese officials of the southern\r\nprovinces were filled with consternation. They feared that the successes\r\nof the French would encourage them, if not to invade China, at least to\r\nforce a settlement with her on their own terms. They had before them the\r\nbrochure of Captain Rivière, commander of the French forces in Tongking,\r\nin which he advocated a quarrel with China as a preliminary to the seizure\r\nof the three southern provinces, Kwangtung, Kwangsi, and Yunnan. An\r\nobvious step towards the execution of such a design would be an attack on\r\nthe provincial capital, Canton, an event which was not only anticipated\r\nby the authorities, but was thought feasible, and even probable, by\r\ndisinterested onlookers. How little prepared were the Chinese to resist\r\nsuch an attack will be best understood by the measures they took to avert\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAn officer of the Chinese customs service, Mr G. Detring, returning from\r\nfurlough, brought with him the details of the Marquis Tsêng's abortive\r\nnegotiations in Paris. He arrived in China immediately after the capture\r\nof the two strongholds of Sontay and Bacninh. In proceeding from Hongkong\r\nto take up his official post at Canton he accepted a passage in the French\r\n_aviso_ Volta, which conveyed Rear-Admiral Lespès to the latter city. She\r\nwas commanded by Commandant Fournier, with whom Mr Detring had been some\r\nyears before on terms of intimacy in the north of China. The principal\r\ntopic discussed on the passage was naturally Tongking, and, judging from\r\nsubsequent developments, it is reasonable to suppose that the seeds of the\r\nsettlement eventually concluded between China and France were sown during\r\nthat short but interesting voyage. When Mr Detring reported himself to the\r\nprovincial authorities they evinced the greatest anxiety as to what they\r\nconceived to be the threatening attitude of the French against Canton.\r\nAsked if their river defences were in a position to resist attack, they\r\nfrankly avowed that they were not; but yet, being personally responsible\r\nfor the defence, they dared not confess the true state of affairs to the\r\nImperial Government. The viceroy of Canton and the governor of Yunnan\r\nwere already under censure, and the military commanders in Tongking\r\nwere even threatened with decapitation \"pour encourager les autres.\" The\r\nCanton authorities were thus, in fact, in the dilemma in which Chinese\r\nprovincial officials have so frequently found themselves in dealing with\r\nforeign exigencies--responsible yet helpless. Since they were avowedly\r\nincapable of resistance, the viceroy and governor were advised at once\r\nto open negotiations with the French, and, as a first step, to report the\r\nactual position frankly to the Central Government,--in other words, to Li\r\nHung-chang, who in this, as in all other crises, had to bear the burden\r\nof every initiative. Having had experience of the capacity of Mr Detring,\r\nfirst in the negotiating of the Chefoo convention, and subsequently during\r\nseveral years of official intercourse at Tientsin, Li Hung-chang moved\r\nthe Central Government to summon the Canton commissioner of customs to\r\nTientsin for consultation.\r\n\r\nThe way being thus partially opened to negotiation, Rear-Admiral Lespès\r\nheld himself in readiness to proceed to Tientsin in response to any\r\ninvitation that might be conveyed to him. Captain Fournier was sent on\r\nin advance to the rendezvous at Chefoo, where he was to remain until\r\nthe real views of the Chinese Government respecting a settlement of the\r\nTongking dispute had been ascertained. The French having set their hearts\r\non extorting a large indemnity, it was emphatically declared to them that\r\nChina would never pay one farthing. Any negotiation, therefore, would be\r\nfutile unless this question was first eliminated. Having paved the way\r\nwith Li Hung-chang, Mr Detring next proceeded to Chefoo to invite Captain\r\nFournier to Tientsin. From previous good relations he was _persona grata_\r\nwith Li, and on that account was thought a not unfit agent with whom to\r\ndiscuss preliminaries in anticipation of the arrival of his admiral. But\r\nthat there should be no mistake about the indemnity, Captain Fournier\r\nwas once more told that unless it were dropped it would be useless his\r\nproceeding to Tientsin. His doing so, therefore, was a tacit withdrawal\r\nof that important item in the French demands. Both parties being equally\r\ndesirous of a settlement, all official technical difficulties were\r\npromptly overcome, and Captain Fournier, from a mere herald of the French\r\nadmiral, was by telegraphic instructions from Paris at once promoted to\r\nthe rank of plenipotentiary for France, and this notwithstanding that\r\nthere was an accredited representative of the Republic eighty miles off\r\nin Peking. The two negotiators, in short, fell into each other's arms,\r\nand the convention of May 11, 1884, was the result.\r\n\r\nThe peace so suddenly and irregularly patched up was not, however,\r\ndestined to endure. Li Hung-chang, knowing better than any of his\r\npeers the risks of a war with France, had stretched his authority to\r\nthe uttermost in concluding a treaty which practically ceded Annam and\r\nTongking to that Power. For though in this as in all his other acts he\r\ncarried with him the approval of the empress-dowager, he knew that he\r\nhad to brave the ferocious opposition of the ignorant fanatics of the\r\ncapital, which he himself described as the \"howling of dogs.\" The moment\r\nthe announcement was made, indeed, the furies were let loose upon him,\r\nand he had practically no support but that of the empress-dowager; for\r\nthe Tsungli-Yamên, so far as they were not opposed to the treaty, were\r\ninvertebrate. It is necessary to bear in mind this critical position\r\nof Li Hung-chang in order to understand the series of blunders,\r\nmisunderstandings, recriminations, and actual war which ensued.\r\n\r\nAfter the ratification of the treaty, arrangements had to be made for the\r\nwithdrawal of the Chinese forces from the territory which had been ceded\r\nto France. Captain Fournier, in an interview with Li Hung-chang, presented\r\na memorandum fixing the dates on which the troops were to evacuate the\r\nseveral positions specified. A long discussion appears to have taken\r\nplace, in which it is not difficult, from the circumstances above referred\r\nto, to divine what the viceroy's attitude must have been. He wished\r\nto avoid the invidious responsibility of asking the Central Government\r\nto order the withdrawal of the troops from Langson, as to do so would\r\nobviously add fuel to the fire of those powerful functionaries who were\r\nclamouring for the repudiation of the treaty, and for the negotiator's\r\nhead. In vain endeavouring to obtain from Fournier an indefinite delay in\r\ncarrying out the stipulation for the retirement of the Chinese troops, Li\r\nperhaps trusted that the French commanders in Tongking would themselves\r\ncut the knot by marching forward with an adequate force and brushing away\r\nthe Chinese troops opposing them. The accomplished fact would then have\r\nsettled everything.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the clever interpreter, instead of translating all\r\nthe viceroy's arguments and explaining his difficulties, summed the whole\r\nup to Captain Fournier in two words, \"Avancez donc\"--advice which would no\r\ndoubt have been sufficient if only the French military commander, Colonel\r\nDugenne, had marched with a reasonable force, or even if he had carried\r\nwith him a competent interpreter, through whom he might have communicated\r\nwith the Chinese commander. The latter officer, however, when called upon\r\nto evacuate the post, pleaded that he had received no instructions to\r\nthat effect, and asked for time to communicate with Peking. The letter\r\nto the French commander containing these reasonable pleas for delay was\r\neither wrongly translated or left untranslated for months. In the meantime\r\nColonel Dugenne advanced with a small party, and was forced to retreat\r\nwith loss, for which he was not unjustly recalled by his own authorities;\r\nand thereupon ensued the Franco-Chinese war.\r\n\r\nThis was not, however, the only _contretemps_ in connection with this\r\nlamentable outbreak. The Chinese commander had actually telegraphed\r\nto Li Hung-chang for instructions; but, still unwilling to face the\r\nresponsibility, the latter left the reply to his council, among whom\r\nthere happened to be for the moment his evil genius, Chang Pei-lun, a\r\nfire-eating member of the Tsungli-Yamên, who was on his way to take up\r\nthe post of governor of Fukien province and Imperial Commissioner of the\r\nFoochow arsenal.\r\n\r\nLaudable efforts were made to repair the mischief, and in the conferences\r\nwhich followed in Paris peace was more than once all but assured; but\r\nowing to a series of accidents and misunderstandings, in which the\r\nauthorities at Peking, the French representative there, the French\r\ncommanders on the Chinese coast, and the telegraph were all implicated,\r\nthe die was cast in August 1884, and the war was continued till the\r\nfollowing April.\r\n\r\nFor reasons of their own the French Government were averse to calling the\r\nhostilities \"war,\" preferring reprisals and \"intelligent destruction.\" By\r\nwhatever name it may be called, the French did not distinguish themselves\r\ngreatly in the conduct of the operations. Their only feat of arms was\r\nthe destruction, at their anchorage in the river Min, of the Chinese\r\nships belonging to the Foochow squadron, and of the arsenal, which, as\r\nLi Hung-chang bitterly reflected, had been erected by \"French genius.\"\r\nAdmiral Courbet found his destructive work easy, having entered the river\r\nand taken up a position in the rear of the batteries during time of peace.\r\nThe subsequent operations in Formosa were without result; and the French\r\nGovernment refused permission to Admiral Courbet to attack Port Arthur,\r\non the non-military ground of wishing to save the prestige of \"notre ami\r\nLi Hung-chang.\" So far as the naval operations were concerned, even when\r\nmost successful in intelligent destruction, they were quite ineffective\r\ntowards ending the war until the method which has never failed to bring\r\nthe Chinese Government to terms was resorted to--the stoppage of the\r\ngrain-supply to the capital. This was accomplished by a patrol of the\r\ncoast for the purpose of intercepting vessels carrying rice to Tientsin.\r\nThe work performed during the winter and spring of 1885 by the French\r\ncruisers, in keeping the sea without any base and performing their patrol\r\nduties in all weathers, excited the admiration of seamen. It should be\r\nmentioned that they were precluded from acting offensively against the\r\nYangtze by tacit understanding with Great Britain and other Powers.\r\n\r\nIf the breach of the peace between France and China was a historical\r\ncuriosity, the eventual settlement of the dispute resembled a dramatic\r\nextravaganza. The final incident of the war in Tongking was the defeat\r\nof the French, followed by a panic, caused apparently by General Négrier\r\nbeing wounded. The force then made a disorderly retreat before imaginary\r\npursuers. In the meantime the empress-dowager had given positive orders\r\nthat peace should be made on any terms. Both parties had thus come round\r\nto the _status quo ante bellum_--that is to say, they were both equally\r\nurgent to obtain peace, as they had been in May 1884. The agent in\r\nbringing this about was Sir Robert Hart; and it was effected, as great\r\nthings usually are, by the adroit use of very simple means. During the\r\nblockade of Formosa a small Chinese lighthouse tender was captured by the\r\nFrench admiral and detained. As she was essentially non-combatant, and was\r\nserving the interests of humanity in supplying the numerous lighthouses\r\non the coast of China for the benefit of the commerce of all nations, Sir\r\nRobert Hart instructed his very capable London agent, Mr Duncan Campbell,\r\nto go to Paris and represent the case to the French Ministers, with a\r\nview to obtaining the release of so useful and harmless a vessel. In\r\nthis manner the door was opened to the larger negotiation. Mr Campbell\r\nexecuted his delicate mission with so much tact, that in the amicable\r\nconversations which ensued between him and certain French officials the\r\nidea of putting an end to a war of which both parties were tired, and\r\nwhich, moreover, seemed objectless, was ventilated; and in a few days\r\nauthority was telegraphed from Peking to Mr Campbell to sign a protocol.\r\n\r\nThis was done before the news of the French reverse at Langson reached\r\nParis. After such a military success M. Jules Ferry could not imagine\r\nthat the Chinese Government would adhere to the terms of the protocol,\r\nand therefore he kept the whole negotiation secret from the Chambers. In\r\nthe meanwhile the mishap to the French troops, being greatly exaggerated,\r\nexcited such intense feeling in France that M. Ferry, _le Tonkinois_,\r\nwas obliged to resign, with the treaty which might have saved him in his\r\npocket. As for the empress-dowager, she recked nothing of the success of\r\nher brave troops on the outskirts of the empire, but thought only of the\r\nenormous expense of the war, which had been unpleasantly brought home to\r\nher, and of matters affecting her own convenience. She therefore had no\r\nthought of going back on the treaty, but was even more urgent than before\r\nto have it promptly signed and ratified. The honours of the peace thus\r\nfell in a few days to M. Ferry's successor.\r\n\r\nAnd what was the outcome of a year's fighting which cost China 100,000,000\r\ntaels and France some proportionate amount? A simple reaffirmation of the\r\nLi-Fournier convention of May 1884! The convention itself was short and\r\nsimple--one clause only exciting much interest during the negotiations,\r\nand that provoked a hot discussion, not on the substance, but on the\r\nverbal form. It was a stipulation by which the two contracting parties\r\nconsciously meant different things, and each fought hard for a phrase\r\nsufficiently subtle to allow each to interpret it in his own way when the\r\ntime came for the fulfilment of the treaty provisions. The French were\r\nmost desirous of binding the Chinese to employ French industries in all\r\ntheir new undertakings. China was equally resolute in avoiding any such\r\nobligation. In the end each was satisfied that he could read the treaty\r\nclause in his own favour. But the final victory in the struggle would go\r\nto the side that was most persistent in forcing its meaning into practice.\r\nThe French Ministry had announced to the Chambers a great victory for\r\nFrench manufacturing industries, which were represented as having by it\r\nobtained a monopoly in China. The text of the treaty, even in the French\r\nversion, did not, indeed, bear this out; but the French had the _primâ\r\nfacie_ argument on their side, that the introduction of a clause in a\r\ntreaty referring to the Chinese patronage of French industries, however\r\nworded, must have meant something more than merely to register the common\r\nfact that China was at liberty to deal with whom she pleased. In the\r\nend a compromise was effected by China's giving to a French syndicate\r\nthe contract for excavating the basin and dock at Port Arthur and\r\ncertain orders for material, among which was a famous military balloon,\r\nwonderfully symbolic of the whole proceeding.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n [26] 'Contemporary Review,' December 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH PROTECTORATE OF CHRISTIANS.\r\n\r\n    Alliance with Church the corner-stone of French\r\n    conquest--Persistence of French ambitions in the Far\r\n    East--Protectorate of native Christians--Its abuse by the\r\n    propaganda--Forcible erection of cathedrals in Peking--Imperial\r\n    family aggrieved thereby--Negotiations for removal of church\r\n    from palace grounds--Mr Dunn's mission to Rome--Vatican to send\r\n    a nuncio--French Government vetos--French minister vetos transfer\r\n    of cathedral--Unless transaction placed in his hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe claim of France to protect Christians against the native authorities\r\nin the Far East constitutes the basis and the origin of her present\r\npolitical position in those countries. The propagation of the faith was,\r\nindeed, a recognised element in the adventures of other countries besides\r\nFrance; but she has, since the eclipse of Portugal and Spain, enjoyed\r\nthe distinction of a working alliance with the Church in furthering the\r\nforeign domination of both. \"Church and State, linked in alliance close\r\nand potential, played faithfully into each other's hands,\" says Parkman\r\n('Jesuits in North America'). In the reign of Louis XIV. the kingdom\r\nof Siam was the object of their joint attention. A missionary bishop\r\npersuaded the most Christian king that to establish the Church in Siam\r\nand convert king and country to the Catholic faith would open an effectual\r\ndoor for the extension of French commerce. A century later another bishop\r\npersuaded another Louis to interfere in the affairs of Annam, and only\r\nthe events of 1789 cut short an expedition that was being prepared of\r\npolitico-ecclesiastical propagandism. Napoleon III. took up the cause,\r\nand actually effected the conquest of Cochin China; and Gambetta was\r\nso enthusiastic on the subject that, while persecuting the Catholics in\r\nFrance, he was ready to expend the forces of the Republic in protecting\r\nthem in distant countries.\r\n\r\nThere is here, therefore, irrespective of persons or forms of government,\r\nan unbroken tradition, which furnishes a key to the successive operations\r\nof France in the Far East. Thus when she resolved to join England in\r\nhostilities against China in 1857 a pretext was ready to hand in the\r\nmurder of a Catholic priest in the interior of the country, his presence\r\nthere being a defiance of the laws of the empire. There has been flux\r\nand reflux in French policy, but no change in its direction; and though\r\nprudence has from time to time set limits to its full expression,\r\nthe claim to a special representation of Chinese Christians has been\r\nconsistently pursued as a cardinal object of the French military, naval,\r\nand diplomatic forces in the Far East.\r\n\r\nThe treaties of 1858 for the first time authorised travelling into the\r\ninterior, and placed French subjects, whether missionary or not, who\r\navailed themselves of the permission, under the protection of their own\r\ncountry. But ever since the convention of Peking in 1860 it has been\r\nsought by indirect and unobtrusive means to assume the protectorate over\r\nnative Christians as well. The interpolated clause in the Chinese, which\r\nwas no part of the authentic French version of the convention, lent a\r\ncertain colour to the pretension by seeming to recognise communities\r\nof Chinese Christians as legal units and fit subjects of international\r\nagreement between China and France. Nevertheless, \"French interference\r\nbetween the Chinese authorities and the subjects of the empire of China\r\nhas never had any treaty warrant or justification by the law of nations,\"\r\nwrote Sir Rutherford Alcock in the 'Nineteenth Century,' November 1886;\r\nand he added, \"China has the remedy in her own hands, to a certain extent,\r\nby refusing to admit the pretension.\" The Chinese Government had long\r\nbeen alive to the danger, as its elaborate appeal to the reason of the\r\nPowers in 1871 amply testified, but its eyes were opened still wider by\r\nthe lesson of the Tongking war. A disposition was thereafter evinced to\r\nwithstand the claim of the French, and the action of Germany afforded\r\nsufficient support to the Chinese position, had the Government only\r\nhad the courage and perspicacity to lean upon it. For in the Catholic\r\npropaganda were missionaries of German origin, who were not permitted to\r\ndivest themselves of their nationality, but were made to apply for their\r\npassports into the interior not to the French, but the German, Legation in\r\nPeking. Had Italy and Spain been equally independent, the question of the\r\nFrench, or any other protectorate, could scarcely have been entertained\r\nwithout introducing the element of separate foreign nationalism into\r\nthe constitution of the Christian communities in China, which would not,\r\nperhaps, have been agreeable to the views of the Catholic propagandists,\r\nfor they naturally aspired to maintain their independence as a compact\r\necclesiastical organisation.\r\n\r\nThe dread of the French protectorate was much accentuated by the enforced\r\nrestitution of ancient buildings, the most conspicuous examples of which\r\noccurred in the city of Peking itself, and even within the area of the\r\nimperial palace. The sites of three ancient churches being claimed by the\r\nFrench Minister, the emperor's Government was compelled to violate its\r\nsense of justice by evicting the existing owners. The original building of\r\none of the three was found practically intact, though hidden by the houses\r\nbuilt round and against its walls. These of course had to be cleared away,\r\nregardless of the rights of their occupants. The interior fittings and\r\ndecorations of the church had disappeared, but, strange to say, much of\r\nthe wood carving and other ornaments were gradually recovered from the\r\nold-curiosity shops, where the parts not destroyed had, by the instinct\r\nof the Wardour Street craft, been preserved, begrimed with the dust of a\r\nhundred years and hopelessly unsaleable. By patiently collecting these\r\ndisjointed fragments and piecing them together like a Chinese puzzle,\r\nthe Fathers were able gradually to restore the church to something like\r\nits original state, so that it became itself an interesting relic of the\r\ngolden age of the Jesuits in Peking.\r\n\r\nThe other two churches had been demolished, and the sites converted to\r\nsecular uses, requiring some ingenuity to identify. When these sites\r\nwere, under the new dispensation, cleared of superincumbent buildings,\r\nchurches were erected as much exceeding the original as the glory of\r\nthe Jewish temple, rebuilt after the Captivity, excelled that of the\r\nformer house. The restrictions imposed by the Government on the style of\r\nthe buildings, the last vestige of power which they dared assert, bore\r\nlightly on the astute constructors of the new churches. In deference\r\nto a common Chinese objection, perhaps partly superstitious, to lofty\r\nstructures overlooking them, a limit was set to the height of the new\r\nbuildings. But remonstrances after completion were easily disposed of by\r\nthe pious Fathers inviting the objectors to go and measure the towers! The\r\nChinese seem to have the same constitutional dislike of a demonstration\r\nthat they have to a straight line or a right angle, and a challenge\r\nlike this never failed to put them to silence. As to their neglect to\r\nexercise their right of supervision during construction, the shortest\r\nway to characterise it is merely to say it was Chinese. The same kind of\r\nnegligence also allowed roofs of cathedrals, not in the capital alone, but\r\nin distant provinces, to be covered with yellow tiles, a colour reserved\r\nexclusively for imperial use. It is true the process was disguised, for\r\nthe benefit of those who chose to be blind, by the tiles being whitewashed\r\nbefore being sent aloft, leaving to the slow action of the weather the\r\ngradual revelation of the imperial colour, which might then, indeed, be\r\nrepresented as the act of Heaven. Nothing is too transparent to deceive\r\nthose who are willing to be deceived.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PEI-T'ANG CATHEDRAL IN PEKING, PURCHASED BY CHINESE\r\n   GOVERNMENT.]\r\n\r\nThe cathedral around which the greatest interest centred, however, was the\r\none which was erected within the palace grounds. The site had been granted\r\nby the great Emperor Kanghsi, the most imperial of the Manchu line, to the\r\nlearned fathers who cured his fever by administering Jesuits' bark, then\r\na new discovery, and whom he reckoned on attaching to his house by the\r\nfavours bestowed on them. The new building was presumably erected on or\r\nnear the site of the old, against the most urgent protests of the Court.\r\nEvery inducement was offered to the French--larger and better sites,\r\nperhaps other compensations as well--if they would forego their demand\r\nfor the resumption of the ground; but the French Government being set\r\nupon marking its ascendancy by a permanent sign, compelled the erection\r\nof the Pei-t'ang Cathedral on the spot indicated. The Lazarists, who had\r\nsucceeded to the Jesuits in North China, had a kindly bishop at their\r\nhead, who conceded much in the structure of the new building to soothe\r\nthe feelings of the imperial family. Nevertheless, stunted as they were,\r\nfrom the point of view of architectural symmetry, the double towers of the\r\ncathedral were visible from the palace, and the two belfries commanded\r\na view over a large part of the precincts. The building was therefore\r\nan eyesore to the inmates for twenty years, on the common ground on\r\nwhich it would have been offensive even to a provincial population, but\r\nstill more as a staring monument of the deepest humiliation the dynasty\r\nhad endured.[27] The empress-dowager bore the grievance, but not with\r\nresignation, for soon after the affairs of the empire assumed a settled\r\naspect she urged her Ministers to find a way to get rid of the obnoxious\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nMonseigneur Delaplace had, in his former diocese of Chêkiang, rendered\r\ngood service to the Government in opposing the rebels, for which he was\r\ngranted high Chinese rank. Being dissatisfied with the action of France\r\nafter the Tientsin massacre of 1870, he extricated his mission from the\r\ncontrol of the French Legation in Peking, and from that date till his\r\ndeath in 1882 conducted its affairs in direct communication with the\r\nTsungli-Yamên. Fully recognising how hateful his cathedral was to the\r\nChinese, he co-operated with Prince Kung and Wênsiang in their efforts\r\nto remove it, and in 1874 he actually concluded an agreement with them\r\nto that effect. But the contract was vetoed by the French Government. The\r\nsore was thus reopened and continued to fester until 1881, when there was\r\nso much excitement in the capital that the Church and mission were thought\r\nto be in great danger. During the Tongking troubles the question of the\r\ncathedral was allowed to rest, but no sooner was peace assured than the\r\nCourt again became restless, and with renewed urgency sought a remedy for\r\nits grievance.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations, which proved successful, were entered upon in an\r\nirregular manner, such as has characterised so many of the Chinese\r\nofficial acts. An Englishman in Peking, who had had business dealings with\r\nthe Government, was asked one day by the confidential factotum of Prince\r\nCh'un whether he could render assistance in the matter of the Pei-t'ang.\r\nThe case was explained at length, and the foreigner, not being then aware\r\nof the negotiations of 1874, suggested, as the most obvious course, trying\r\nto make an arrangement with the Lazarist mission. The Manchu shook his\r\nhead, to signify the futility of that proceeding. The enterprise thus\r\nseemed desperate, unless the Imperial Government should exercise its\r\nsovereign right of expropriation,--much too drastic a measure for any\r\nChinese Government to attempt.\r\n\r\nOne hope only seemed to remain, a direct appeal to the Vatican. This led\r\nto a long conversation on the Papacy, and the Manchu official,[28] being a\r\npious and even a learned Buddhist, became intensely interested in hearing\r\nmuch that was new to him respecting the position and prerogatives of the\r\nEuropean Dalai Lama. Nor did the \"great Western Saint,\" whose vicegerent\r\nthe Pope claims to be, fail to evoke the deep reverence of both the Manchu\r\nand the Chinese who were present, so that one might be almost justified\r\nin appropriating words uttered on a different occasion,--they were \"not\r\nvery far from the kingdom\" ruled by \"the Western Saint.\"\r\n\r\nBut the interesting question was, How was the Vatican to be approached? By\r\na qualified secret agent intrusted with the full confidence of the Chinese\r\nCourt. The mission would be by no means easy, for should its object become\r\nknown, it would be thwarted in advance from mere jealousy, if from no\r\nother motive, by Lazarist and perhaps other Catholic missions, so that\r\naccess to the Supreme Pontiff would be blocked at the outset. The mission\r\nwould also be certain to arouse the strenuous hostility of the French\r\nGovernment. After discussing the problem from all sides for three hours,\r\nthe Manchu cut it short by the abrupt question, \"Will you go?\" \"No,\" said\r\nthe foreigner; \"such an undertaking requires quite other qualities than\r\nany I possess. But,\" he added, after considering the matter, \"I think I\r\nknow the man who might carry it through.\" \"Where is he? in Peking? Bring\r\nhim here,\" were rapped out like musketry-fire, showing how urgent was\r\nthe subject. The agent recommended to him was Mr J. G. Dunn, a man of\r\ngenius and of varied accomplishments, a Catholic, and having an extensive\r\npersonal acquaintance with the propaganda. He was at once invited to\r\nPeking, when another long conference ensued, and Mr Dunn was requested to\r\ndraw up a memorandum on the whole scheme for the information of Prince\r\nCh'un. After waiting some time for a response Mr Dunn left the capital,\r\ndecidedly disappointed, for he was eager for a service so congenial to\r\nhis character and feelings. Indeed had the mission been created for the\r\nman, or the man for the mission, the harmony between means and ends could\r\nhardly have been closer.\r\n\r\nSeveral months elapsed before the question emerged again from official\r\nobscurity, and the manner of it is worth relating if only for the\r\nside-light it throws on Chinese methods. Li Hung-chang paid a visit to the\r\ncapital in 1885, and soon after his return to Tientsin he requested his\r\nsecretaries to find out where Mr Dunn was and to invite him by telegraph\r\nto come to see the viceroy. Not knowing why he was sent for, any more\r\nthan Gordon did when summoned from India five years before, Mr Dunn came,\r\nand Li at once entered on the Pei-t'ang question, showing him his own\r\nmemorandum on the subject. The affair having been placed by Prince Ch'un\r\nin the hands of Li Hung-chang to be carried through, Mr Dunn was promptly\r\ncommissioned, and in concert with the viceroy's secretary, the very\r\ncapable officer who now represents China at Washington, the emissary's\r\ninstructions and credentials were drawn up. There were two separate\r\ninstructions, and no little confusion was caused thereby.\r\n\r\nOn leaving China for Rome, Mr Dunn stipulated that a competent\r\nintermediary should be appointed to interpret his correspondence to Li\r\nHung-chang, a duty which was intrusted to the commissioner of customs in\r\nTientsin. The utility of this provision was soon made manifest, for when\r\ntelegrams began to arrive from Rome, their purport was unintelligible,\r\nas they seemed irrelevant to the expropriation of the cathedral, which\r\nwas Mr Dunn's special mission. Irritated by this apparent aberration,\r\nthe viceroy's idea was to recall the emissary. But when it was suggested\r\nthat the copies of his credentials should be first carefully examined\r\nthe position became clearer. One part of his instructions was then found\r\nto be directed towards the question of the Christian protectorate, and\r\nMr Dunn was, in fact, diplomatising with the Pope with a view to his\r\nappointing a nuncio or apostolic delegate to China to represent all the\r\nCatholic missions. The Chinese had not fully mastered this idea, and even\r\nLi Hung-chang, who has a wonderful memory, had forgotten the existence\r\nof the second section of his instructions, which no doubt Mr Dunn had\r\ndrawn up himself. The Tsungli-Yamên, languid and bemused, hesitated to\r\nexpress any opinion, and assumed their habitual passive attitude. One\r\nperson alone really grasped the importance of having the Church in China\r\nrepresented by the delegate of a Power \"which has no armies or fleets\r\nwherewith to threaten or attack.\" The empress-dowager, when the nomination\r\nof Mgr. Agliardi was announced, and his coming depended on formal imperial\r\ninvitation, sent the urgent message to the Yamên, \"Get that man here; lose\r\nno time.\"\r\n\r\nMr Dunn's negotiations with the Vatican of course soon leaked out; notices\r\nappeared in the press; Mr Punch had his little joke that though there\r\nwas evidently a good deal _doing_, the question was, Who was _Dunn_? The\r\nFrench Government took the matter up energetically through their Minister\r\nin Rome, and their diplomatic efforts having failed, they presented\r\nan ultimatum to the Pope which compelled him to cancel the appointment\r\nof his nuncio. France threatening to terminate the concordat, withdraw\r\nthe subvention to the Church in France, and sequestrate its ministers,\r\nthe Holy Father had no option but to submit. With tears in his eyes he\r\ndeplored his impotence to respond to the invitation of China under such\r\na truculent menace to \"his children in France.\"\r\n\r\nWhile these things were going on in Rome the transference of the Pei-t'ang\r\nCathedral, which had been settled in principle through Mr Dunn, was then\r\ntaken up by the Lazarist Mission, and the popular Père Favier was deputed\r\nby the Bishop of Peking to proceed to Rome and to Paris to obtain from\r\nthe Vatican and the General of the Lazarist Order the specific authority\r\nto negotiate the transfer. Having brought back the necessary powers,\r\na convention was shortly concluded between Bishop Tagliabue and Li\r\nHung-chang. The Church made an excellent bargain, as it generally does:\r\na new site of about thrice the area was granted close to the old on the\r\nopposite side of the broad roadway, and a bountiful compensation in money\r\nwas made for the trouble and cost of removal. But after the agreement was\r\nsigned the French Government interposed its veto so far as to insist on\r\nbeing the intermediary through whose hands the transaction should pass.\r\nFrance also, it was said, had previously essayed to _marchander_ with\r\nChina for her consent, but withdrew when it became clear that further\r\nobstruction might entail untoward consequences. To mark its satisfaction\r\nat the final solution of this question, the Chinese Government eulogised\r\nall those who had helped to bring it about, and bestowed high rank on\r\nBishop Tagliabue and the Abbé Favier (now bishop).\r\n\r\nThis transaction supplied a crucial test of French policy and pretensions\r\nin China, the first concrete expression of both that had been obtained\r\nsince the forcible restitution of Church property immediately after the\r\ncapture of Peking. The coercion, indeed, was applied on this occasion\r\nto the Roman Pontiff and the Catholic Church rather than to the Chinese\r\nGovernment; but the latter were not so dull as not to see to what\r\nulterior objects the French scheme might be extended, given convenient\r\ncircumstances. They were, in fact, really alarmed, and the question was\r\ndiscussed with some warmth in the Chinese as well as in the European\r\npress. \"The end is not yet,\" wrote Sir Rutherford Alcock; \"China may\r\nbe less open to intimidation than heretofore, and assert her undoubted\r\nright to refuse the recognition of an assumed protectorate over Roman\r\nmissions, irrespective of the nationality of their members.\" The French\r\npress espoused the cause of the protectorate warmly, treating it as a most\r\nvaluable national asset. The Chinese press took up the question in reply.\r\nTheir view of the position was comprehensively summed up in a native\r\nnewspaper in October 1886 in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n    It has been said by them of old time that when a man is found\r\n    acting injuriously to his own family but benevolently to strangers\r\n    his behaviour is unnatural, and there is something hidden under\r\n    the cloak of outward kindness.\r\n\r\n    We have from time to time printed translations from various\r\n    foreign newspapers on the subject of the relations between the\r\n    Chinese Government and the Pope. Some days ago we reproduced an\r\n    article on the same subject from the 'Temps,' a French newspaper\r\n    of the highest authority. These articles all indicate that the\r\n    French Government is greatly troubled at the prospect of losing\r\n    what is called the right to protect Christians in China. This is\r\n    a question which has not hitherto been much considered by Chinese\r\n    statesmen. Those of them who have been in Europe, or who have\r\n    studied political affairs there, know something of the importance\r\n    of the issues which are covered up in that apparently harmless\r\n    word \"protection\"; but it is hardly to be expected that the\r\n    Ministers and statesmen who have scarcely travelled beyond the\r\n    walls of Peking can realise the full significance of the phrase.\r\n    Nothing is better calculated to quicken the apprehension of the\r\n    Government on this point than the extraordinary excitement of the\r\n    French Government, which insists on protecting the Christians\r\n    in China whether they desire this protection or not. For now\r\n    that the French have so plainly shown their secret designs, it\r\n    would be impossible for China to acquiesce, by word or deed, in\r\n    the pretensions which France sets up. It is rather suspicious\r\n    that the French Government, the greatest enemy of Christianity,\r\n    which is constantly oppressing the priests and confiscating their\r\n    property in France, should be so intensely desirous of protecting\r\n    Christians in China, where this protection is not required. A\r\n    leading French statesman, Gambetta, who died a few years ago,\r\n    left as a legacy to his followers the doctrine that the Church\r\n    should be suppressed in France but supported in all foreign\r\n    countries. Gambetta was a man who had no reverence for Heaven, and\r\n    no religion, and seems to have regarded Christianity as a disease\r\n    which he wished his own country to be rid of, but was not sorry\r\n    to see it spreading elsewhere. It is necessary to keep these ideas\r\n    in mind in order to understand the action of the French Government\r\n    to-day.\r\n\r\n    It would be out of place here to discuss what Christianity\r\n    is. Like Buddhism, it had a very pure origin, and the living\r\n    principles of both are mercy, benevolence, and peace. But both\r\n    religions have in course of ages been overlaid with doctrines and\r\n    practices which have obscured the simplicity of their origin,\r\n    and even changed their character. But the greatest misfortune\r\n    to Christianity is that it has been made use of by princes\r\n    as a pretext for wars of aggression. In fact, nearly all the\r\n    wars of Europe for the last thousand years have been in some\r\n    way connected with religion. This is sometimes made a reproach\r\n    against Christianity, which professes to be founded on peace and\r\n    self-sacrifice, but the reproach is scarcely just. Rather it is\r\n    the peaceful character of Christianity which has induced ambitious\r\n    statesmen to make use of it to work out their own designs, just as\r\n    in private life unscrupulous men are sometimes enabled to carry\r\n    out questionable plans by using the names of men of blameless\r\n    character. We are only now concerned with the political aspect of\r\n    Christianity, not its merits as a religion. The modern history of\r\n    Turkey affords the best illustration of the danger of allowing\r\n    foreign Powers to interfere in matters of religion. During the\r\n    last hundred years Russia has several times made war on Turkey,\r\n    always on the pretext of protecting Christians, and it is this\r\n    which is fast breaking up the Turkish empire. It is interesting\r\n    to observe that Russia and France follow the same policy in this\r\n    matter. When the French Legation withdrew from Peking on the 2nd\r\n    day of the 7th moon of the 10th year of Kwanghsu (22nd August\r\n    1884), the affairs of the Christians were transferred to the\r\n    Russian Legation. The Ministers of the Tsungli-Yamên remember\r\n    very well how eagerly the Russian Minister assumed the office\r\n    of protector of Christians, going to even greater lengths in the\r\n    way of protection than the French themselves had done. The reason\r\n    for this is plain. Russia, although she has none now, expects to\r\n    have by-and-by many Christians in Mongolia and Manchuria who may\r\n    be extremely useful to her in her aggressive designs on China.\r\n    Therefore the Russian officials, always looking very far ahead,\r\n    were most anxious to establish a right of interference for the\r\n    protection of Christians. And they could do this without reproach\r\n    when they were acting not for themselves but for France during\r\n    war-time; well knowing that, whatever position she succeeded in\r\n    establishing for France, Russia could claim for herself when the\r\n    proper time came. But the more anxious Russia and France are to\r\n    assert the right of interfering with Chinese Christians, the more\r\n    resolute China should be in resisting all such interference. The\r\n    only safety for China is to treat Christians, whether Chinese\r\n    or foreign, exactly as all other people are treated--to make no\r\n    distinctions. Foreign missionaries have the right to travel and\r\n    reside in the interior; they can exercise this right without\r\n    getting passports from the French Minister. The Catholic missions\r\n    are composed of men of all nations, but they all have Ministers in\r\n    Peking to whom they can apply for passports. Let the Germans get\r\n    their passports from the German Legation, the Spaniards from the\r\n    Spanish, Italians, Belgians, and Hollanders from their respective\r\n    Legations, but no European State has any right to arrogate to\r\n    itself the position of protector of missionaries in general.\r\n\r\n    It is satisfactory to learn that the head of the Catholic Church\r\n    is of this opinion, and although grateful to France for what\r\n    she has done in the past, is now desirous of being free from\r\n    French protection in the future. To carry out these views, the\r\n    Pope is about to send to China a very high official to reside\r\n    in Peking and perform the functions of a Minister. As the Pope\r\n    has no troops and no territory, but is merely a kind of Dalai\r\n    Lama, there is no danger to China from opening direct relations\r\n    with him. The affairs of the missionaries can then be dealt with\r\n    in an open and straightforward manner, as no fear of political\r\n    traps will lurk behind. The Christians when they know they are no\r\n    longer protected by a military State will understand that their\r\n    security will depend on their own wisdom in avoiding offence.\r\n    And the officials and people, on the other hand, will gradually\r\n    learn that the Christians are only anxious to lead virtuous\r\n    lives, without any political ambition, and they will respect\r\n    them. The Imperial Government will then also be able to extend\r\n    its favour to all Christians and missionaries without the fear\r\n    of nursing traitors in its bosom. The missionaries have among\r\n    them men of great learning and much skill in sciences, which the\r\n    Emperor Kanghsi--who must always stand as the model for Chinese\r\n    rulers--knew very well how to utilise. The present generation\r\n    possesses men no less capable of rendering good services to China,\r\n    and there would be no reason for not using them if the suspicion\r\n    of their being agents of the French Government were once cleared\r\n    away.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding so much clear thinking, however, the action of the\r\nChinese continued, as before, nebulous. They seemed never able to seize\r\nthe bull by the horns, but drifted on, allowing themselves constantly to\r\nbe put in the wrong, hoping perhaps to accomplish by illegitimate means\r\nwhat was within their legal competence. Afraid or unwilling to control\r\nthe provincial authorities, they allowed outrages to be perpetrated for\r\nwhich they refused redress until coercion was applied, thus affording to\r\nforeign Powers a not in all cases unwelcome pretext for extending their\r\nprotection even to Chinese Christians. Within a month of the consummation\r\nof the transfer of the Pei-t'ang Cathedral, and after the Marquis Tsêng,\r\nfresh from Europe, had taken his seat at the Board, the Tsungli-Yamên had\r\nfallen into its chronic apathy with regard to Christians. A missionary\r\nnamed Bodinier arrived in Peking from distant Kweichow for the purpose\r\nof soliciting the intervention or intercession of the French Legation\r\nin favour of the persecuted Christians in that province. While he\r\nwas on his journey the Catholics of Chungking in Szechuan were being\r\nsimilarly maltreated. Certain disturbances in that great commercial mart\r\nculminated in the attack on the house of a wealthy Christian family, which\r\nresisted the assailants, several of whom were killed in the affray. The\r\nmagistrates, who had been supine during the time when the mischief was\r\nbrewing, thereupon arrested the head of the Lo family and condemned him\r\nto death,--an exercise of authority which was held to be arbitrary, and\r\ninvidiously directed against Christians. Here was an occasion when the\r\nCentral Government should have taken prompt action, and so deprived the\r\nFrench Government of any pretext for interference. It was a moment when\r\nthat Government was less apt than usual to put forth its power in the\r\nChristian cause. M. Constans was Minister in China, and he was personally\r\nnot at all disposed to assume the protection of Chinese Christians.\r\nNevertheless, the case being urgent, and the Tsungli-Yamên either cowardly\r\nor indifferent, M. Constans broke through the rule he had laid down for\r\nhimself so far as to telegraph to Paris for instructions. The reply was\r\nprompt, doubtless inspired by the propaganda at home, to the effect that\r\nhe should take up the case of Mr Lo. Thus the Chinese threw away a golden\r\nopportunity of showing to the world that the Chinese Christians did not\r\nstand in need of any foreign aid. An impartial investigation might have\r\nshown, indeed, that the Christians were the aggressors, and the local\r\nChinese officials might have been vindicated from the charges made against\r\nthem. But the Government's inaction constantly puts it in the wrong even\r\nwhen it may be substantially in the right. The same fatal course has been\r\nregularly pursued even to our day, with results patent to all.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [27] The effect of these imposing edifices, which dwarf into\r\n    insignificance the most pretentious native buildings, is well\r\n    exemplified in the approach to Canton, where the French cathedral\r\n    church, erected on the site of the Viceroy Yeh's _yamên_, is the\r\n    only object visible, and where the idea of a permanent memorial\r\n    of defeat is well realised. It is not a conciliatory policy;\r\n    irresistible force is required to maintain it.\r\n\r\n [28] See _supra_, p. 308.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nBRITISH SERVICES: DIPLOMATIC, CONSULAR, AND JUDICIAL.\r\n\r\n    Necessity for administrative and judicial control over\r\n    British subjects--Consular courts--Supreme court for China and\r\n    Japan--_Personnel_ of the consular service--Functions of the\r\n    diplomatic representatives--Absence of distinction explained by\r\n    apathy of Home Government--Need of reform.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe frequent references throughout this work to the part played by British\r\nagents in the development of intercourse with China seem to call for a\r\nshort account of the character and status of the official machinery which\r\nserved for so many years as the principal working joint between the two\r\nopposed systems of civilisation.\r\n\r\nThe relations between Great Britain and China were necessarily at first\r\nexperimental. The consuls appointed to the five ports were selected with\r\nno special training, and the chief superintendent, to whom they looked\r\nfor guidance, was scarcely better furnished than themselves. Yet, as has\r\nbeen shown, the remoteness of the consuls from their chief, and of both\r\nfrom the Government they served, threw them much upon their own resources.\r\nHow the demand for independent initiative was responded to by some of the\r\nindividuals concerned has been incidentally noticed in previous chapters.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when it assumed direct relations with China, the need of an\r\neffective control over British subjects resorting to that country weighed\r\nheavily on the British Government; for in exempting them from native\r\njurisdiction the Government took on itself the responsibility for the good\r\nbehaviour of its people. The exercise of this control was necessarily\r\ntentative, proceeding step by step as occasions arose. The unceasing\r\nsolicitude of the Government for the orderly conduct of its subjects in\r\nChina is testified by a long series of Orders in Council conferring on\r\nthe consuls and their superintendent an almost despotic authority over the\r\npersons of the British residents. The operation of this arbitrary system\r\nwas more satisfactory than could have been expected, thanks to the high\r\ncharacter of the parties concerned and the common-sense which governed\r\ntheir mutual relations. In their double capacity, however, of protectors\r\nof Chinese and foreigners against the inroads of British subjects, and of\r\nthe latter against the inroads of the Chinese, the consuls soon discovered\r\nthat the one part of their duty was easy and the other difficult; and\r\nit is no matter for wonder, therefore, if, following the line of least\r\nresistance, some of them should have leaned to the side of repression\r\nrather than to that of the encouragement of their countrymen. This was\r\nnoticeable even in judicial proceedings, where the consul was supreme\r\nover his own nationals, but had no authority over their opponents. Some\r\ncheck on the consequences of consular idiosyncrasies and defective legal\r\nknowledge was maintained by a supreme court in Hongkong, independent\r\nalike of the superintendent of trade and of the governor of the colony,\r\nto which court appeals lay from consular decisions. This prerogative\r\nof the colonial court was not unnaturally irksome to the diplomatic and\r\nconsular servants of the Foreign Office, and was doubtless one cause of\r\nthe coolness, not to say antipathy, with which the colony has generally\r\nbeen regarded by them.\r\n\r\nThe treaties of 1858 and 1860 were followed by a great development\r\nin all three services--diplomatic, consular, and judicial. Some years\r\npreviously the China consular service began to be treated as a career for\r\nwhich special preparation was required, the entry being by competitive\r\nexamination, through which a certain number of students were annually sent\r\nout to China, there to complete their education and then take their part\r\nin executive work. When additional ports were opened, therefore, making\r\nabout twenty in all, in 1861, there was the full complement of qualified\r\nmen ready to occupy the new consular posts, each of them competent to be\r\nhis own interpreter. Diplomatic functions were at the same time withdrawn\r\nfrom Hongkong, where they had been merely nominal for eighteen years,\r\nand became centred in the Chinese capital. A few years later the judicial\r\nauthority, so far as it related to the communities at the Chinese ports,\r\nwas also withdrawn from Hongkong, and was conferred upon the Supreme Court\r\nfor China and Japan, having its headquarters in Shanghai, established by\r\nthe Queen's Order in Council of 1864. The new court was inaugurated by\r\nSir Edmund Hornby, who brought to the work practical experience gained in\r\nthe Levant, the assistant judge being Mr C. W. Goodwin, Barrister of the\r\nInner Temple. This establishment has furnished a solvent for many of the\r\ndifficulties connected with British residence in the Far East. Adapted\r\nwith judgment to local circumstances, the court has proved of immense\r\nassistance to the consuls, who, subordinated judicially to the chief\r\njudge, could now obtain from him proper guidance in their difficulties,\r\na facility of which they availed themselves freely.\r\n\r\nAlthough a great advance on what preceded it, the Supreme Court could\r\nnot of course escape from all the drawbacks which affected the consular\r\ncourts. As between British subjects, it enjoyed the full powers of law\r\ncourts in the mother country; but as between British subjects on the one\r\nhand, and the natives of the country, or non-British residents, on the\r\nother, the authority of the British court could only be exercised over the\r\nformer. This one-sided action has been to some extent compensated in later\r\ntimes by the judicial qualifications of consuls representing other Western\r\nnationalities, who administer their own laws with the same impartiality\r\nas the British courts do theirs. But as regards the Chinese no such\r\ncompensation operates, for although the treaties make provision for the\r\njudicial action of the Chinese authorities, their conceptions of equity\r\nand forms of procedure being wholly alien to those of the Western nations,\r\ntheir decisions seldom satisfy the foreign litigant. An attempt to supply\r\na connecting-link between two radically different juridical ideals was\r\nmade in the setting up of mixed courts for the purpose of dealing with\r\npetty cases between natives and foreigners within the settlements of\r\nShanghai. These courts have been occasionally presided over by honest and\r\ncompetent judges, assisted by able foreign assessors; but as the native\r\nmagistrates, being men of low rank, could always be overruled by the local\r\nexecutive, they lacked the power to make their decisions effective.\r\n\r\nAs it was impossible to set up a separate judicial establishment at\r\neach treaty port where there was but a handful of residents, the consuls\r\nhad to continue to perform magisterial duty with all the inconveniences\r\nattending their double function. Efforts were made by the Home Government\r\nto minimise these disadvantages by infusing a modicum of legal knowledge\r\ninto the service, for which purpose they offered inducements to consular\r\nofficials who should qualify as barristers. Notwithstanding all this,\r\nhowever, the simple fact that a consul is bound in his administrative\r\ncapacity to take a part in matters which may afterwards come before him as\r\na judge perpetuates an element of incongruity demanding an uncommon degree\r\nof tact on the part of the official. Some of the worst consequences to be\r\napprehended from this state of things are partially obviated by the judge\r\nor assistant judge of the Supreme Court going on circuit, when important\r\ncases in the consular districts require it; but that expedient is only\r\npossible at rare intervals.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom with which the Supreme Court has been directed is attested\r\nby the absence of incident in its history, and by the universal tacit\r\napproval of its proceedings. Its success, indeed, soon came to be accepted\r\nso much as a matter of course that the true source of it was forgotten.\r\nIt was, however, recalled vividly to the public memory by a certain\r\nretrograde movement. After a quarter of a century of satisfactory working\r\nher Majesty's Government took a step which was equivalent to pulling out\r\nthe corner-stone of the edifice--the absolute independence of the bench.\r\nIn order to effect an economy in salaries, it was ordained that the two\r\nincompatible offices--the judicial and political--should be merged into\r\none, making the chief judge consul-general, and the assistant judge consul\r\nfor Shanghai. By this move the judges became subordinate to the Legation\r\nin Peking, and the Supreme Court itself was subjected to all the evils of\r\nthe dual function under which the consuls had been labouring. Thanks to\r\nthe exceptional qualities of the holders of the double office, no glaring\r\nscandal arose out of the unnatural combination; but the protests of the\r\ncommunity, and of the incumbent of the two offices himself, were strong\r\nenough to induce the Foreign Office, after a few years' trial, to retrace\r\ntheir false step and restore the judge to his independence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe twenty consular establishments in China on which the Select Committee\r\nof the House of Commons reported in 1872 were manned by forty \"effectives\r\non duty,\" besides a considerable contingent on furlough. The ten posts\r\nsubsequently created employ on an average twenty more. Two complete\r\ngenerations of officials have passed through the consular mill in fifty\r\nyears, which may be moderately reckoned at two hundred men, all of them\r\nselected by a competitive examination only one degree less stringent\r\nthan that for the Indian Civil Service, and nearly all of them men\r\nof varied accomplishments. They have been placed in every part of the\r\nwide empire of China, and during their career have been shifted about\r\nso that every one has had chances of interesting himself in localities\r\nstrongly contrasted with each other, both as regards official labour\r\nand personal recreation and study. From a body of highly educated men\r\nso situated, it was naturally to be expected that much enlightenment\r\nwould be obtained concerning China and its people, and considerable\r\nprogress made in the promotion of amiable intercourse between them and\r\nforeigners. These expectations have not been disappointed. In the period\r\nimmediately following the peace of 1860 remarkable activity was shown\r\nby British consular officers. The names of Meadows, Markham, Alabaster,\r\nOxenham, recall many exploits of exploration in the interior during\r\nvery troublous times. Swinhoe, Baber, Hosie, Bourne, Spence, Davenport,\r\nParker, have continued the work and greatly extended its area. Others\r\nhave distinguished themselves in the held of literary research, and\r\nsome have found their appropriate reward in honourable appointments in\r\nEnglish universities. On the whole, there has been lack of neither energy\r\nnor capacity in the British consular service; and yet it is a matter of\r\ncommon remark, even by its members themselves, that in their primary duty\r\nof promoting and defending the interests of British commerce they have\r\nbeen unsuccessful. Treaty rights, they admit, have not been safeguarded\r\nat the Chinese ports, and this in spite of every apparent incentive to\r\nexertion in their defence. A distinction, however, must be drawn between\r\nan apparent incentive which is general and remote, such as the patriotic\r\ndesire for the advancement of their country's interests, and those\r\ninfluences which are nearer and more personal. The attitude of the China\r\nconsuls can only be fairly estimated in its relation to that of their\r\nchief, and his again in relation to that of the Home Government. \"Like\r\nmaster, like man,\" is an adage which fits the case, and it is to Peking\r\nand to London we must look for the key to the character of the consular\r\nrank and file.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe British Ministers at Peking have been selected without any fixed\r\nrule. The first of the series was taken from the diplomatic circle. The\r\nsucceeding three, whose term of office covered a period of twenty years,\r\nwere chosen from among the veterans of the consular service. The next\r\ntwo were taken from the junior ranks of diplomacy, and the seventh was a\r\nmilitary officer from Africa. The appointment of Sir Robert Hart in 1885,\r\nwhich was cancelled by his wish, afforded further illustration of the\r\nextreme catholicity of the Government's elective faculty.\r\n\r\nThe witnesses examined before the Select Committee of the House of\r\nCommons in 1872 were unanimous in insisting on the necessity for long and\r\nspecial training for the office of consul in China, and this principle\r\nhas been strictly followed by the Government. But for the higher post of\r\nsuperintendent of all the consuls the Government has, at least since 1885,\r\nacted on the theory that no such qualification is necessary. But the task\r\nof a Minister to China is by no means an easy one. It may be left undone,\r\nor it may be done so badly that it were better not to be done at all, but\r\nto discharge the duties of the office in a creditable manner requires not\r\nonly high training but large capacity. The Minister has to conduct his\r\nown diplomatic duties in the capital, in which not the Chinese alone but\r\nall or nearly all his foreign colleagues are openly or secretly thwarting\r\nhim. He has at the same time to direct the proceedings of twenty or thirty\r\nofficers placed at great distances, whom he has never seen, and every one\r\nof whom is superior to himself in the knowledge of the conditions to be\r\ndealt with. For such a duty it is obvious that an officer sent from Europe\r\nmust be incompetent, the circumstances of the service in China differing\r\nessentially from those prevailing elsewhere. The new incumbent, unless\r\nhe were a born genius, could never get beyond the elementary lessons of\r\nexperience before, overtaken by promotion, he shakes the Chinese dust off\r\nhis feet for ever. Much might of course be learned by personal observation\r\nat the consular ports and conference with local officials and people in\r\nthe provinces, but it is somewhat singular that this obvious source of\r\nintelligence has been taken advantage of almost exclusively by those of\r\nthe British Ministers who stood the least in need of it. Indeed the only\r\none of them who made it a rule to visit the treaty ports at intervals\r\nwas Sir Rutherford Alcock, whose long experience convinced him of the\r\nnecessity of constantly refreshing and extending his knowledge of local\r\ncircumstances and people.\r\n\r\nA service dispersed over such a large area as the Chinese empire, carried\r\non by despatches between parties who were strangers to each other, and\r\none of whom at least had no personal knowledge of the subjects treated,\r\nmust have been characterised by an absence of reality, and must have\r\ntended more and more towards a perfunctory routine. For this, however,\r\nthe system of appointing Ministers who were strangers to the country\r\nwas not wholly responsible. Long before the Ministers were so selected\r\nthe secretaries began to be sent from European schools, and thus the\r\nconsular service, disheartened by inadequate pay and a constant menace\r\nof further diminution, saw the few prizes of their profession withdrawn\r\nfrom their reach. To serve his time quietly, therefore, to earn his\r\npension and retire without a stain on his character, became more or less\r\nthe consular ideal. Ambition was starved among those who had to bear\r\nthe burden and heat of a thirty years' residence in China, when they saw\r\ngood posts thrown away upon men imported for two or three years, who were\r\nalmost useless, and who themselves deplored their enforced idleness. The\r\ndisadvantages attending these exotic importations have been often insisted\r\nupon. An old member of the consul staff comments upon it in the following\r\npractical manner:--\r\n\r\n    In every country administered by the British Crown, or at\r\n    every Court at which there is a British representative, the\r\n    administrator or envoy has from the moment of his entering\r\n    on the duties of his office the assistance of an experienced\r\n    staff, well versed in the local history and traditions, or finds\r\n    himself in the midst of a society the language and usages of\r\n    which are familiar to him. In China, where we have been fighting\r\n    and negotiating for over fifty years, we are not so fortunate.\r\n    A Minister proceeds there, and on his arrival finds himself in\r\n    a new and to him unknown country, the staff which he may bring\r\n    with him being like himself utterly unacquainted with the East\r\n    and its peoples. The Minister is obliged either to grope his way\r\n    unassisted, or to rely on the aids and advice of experienced (but\r\n    not always disinterested) outsiders. Under these circumstances his\r\n    only wise course is to put himself entirely in the hands of the\r\n    permanent local staff, which, for this purpose, means the Chinese\r\n    Secretary. That officer, the real motive force of the Legation,\r\n    occupies a position of greater importance than that of the nominal\r\n    head of the mission, but, with an irony which is not uncommon in\r\n    Government administration, he is the least appreciated member of\r\n    the staff. His salary is that of the junior ranks in the consular\r\n    service, and yet it is to him that the seniors in that service\r\n    look for instructions which he is incompetent to give them: the\r\n    result may be imagined. Why should these things be? The Indian\r\n    Government has in its service many men of brilliant attainments,\r\n    and of knowledge gained in long years of service in the East,\r\n    who might be called upon to fill the post of Minister which would\r\n    be suitable and congenial to them. And there is an abundance of\r\n    choice of junior Legation officers in the well-trained consular\r\n    service. Would it not be very advantageous if the working hands in\r\n    the Legation were chosen from the most competent Chinese scholars\r\n    in the consular service?\r\n\r\nConsidering their initial qualifications, their social standing, and their\r\ngreat opportunities, it must be admitted that the men of distinction\r\nwho have emerged from the consular service during the last fifty years\r\nseems disproportionately small. It is perhaps invidious to mention\r\nnames in this connection, but in response to inquiries addressed to\r\nveterans in the service, four men only are placed in the first rank as\r\nthe best representatives of the consular training school. These are Sir\r\nHarry Parkes, Mr T. T. Meadows, Mr H. N. Lay, and Mr W. F. Mayers. Sir\r\nRobert Hart, it should be mentioned, left the service so early, and Sir\r\nRutherford Alcock joined it so late, in life, that their distinguished\r\ncareers can scarcely be claimed as the product of the consular nursery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to look back over the forty years which have elapsed\r\nsince the new relations were established in China without being struck\r\nby a certain change which passed over the character of the diplomatic\r\nand consular services between the first decade of that period and the\r\nsecond. The anxious years of the rebellion evoked much active energy on\r\nthe part of British officials. The serious opposition to the operation\r\nof the treaties was met by very vigorous action on the part of the\r\nconsuls at the ports and of the Minister at the capital. The years 1868\r\nand 1869 may be considered to have marked the culminating-point of the\r\nBritish official effort to enforce observance of the treaties in letter\r\nand spirit, and to protect all commercial interests. The change which\r\ncame over the diplomatic and consular services at the end of the first\r\ndecade of diplomatic relations may be likened to the rising followed by\r\nthe receding of a tide. Up till the years we have specified, whatever the\r\ndifficulties which beset their office, the consuls showed earnestness in\r\nthe defence of the interests confided to them, and acted on the conviction\r\nthat their exertions were pleasing to those who were set in authority\r\nover them. Their sense of duty was sustained by the hope of distinction.\r\nAfter 1869 the discovery was made that the situation had been undergoing\r\na change of which the service had been unaware. What was formerly deemed\r\na merit had become a demerit in consular officers, and on this discovery\r\nzeal naturally fell to a discount. It was but a reflex of the change that\r\nhad crept over the spirit of the British Foreign Office, a change which\r\nalso had escaped notice until circumstances forced it into publicity.\r\nThis seems to have originated with the removal from the scene of Lord\r\nPalmerston, the statesman who for forty years had stood in a general way\r\nfor what was manly and straightforward in the British national character.\r\nThough he left a tried and trusted colleague, Lord Clarendon, in charge of\r\nthe Foreign Office, and a sturdy permanent Under-Secretary, perhaps the\r\nlast custodian of the Palmerstonian tradition, and who remained at his\r\npost for five years longer, yet it was made evident by results that the\r\nspirit which had animated that great department of State had vanished.\r\nThe Foreign Office became nerveless and invertebrate, sentimental\r\nand unstable. Those who had to do with it in the time of Palmerston,\r\nLayard, and Hammond know that since their time the officials bearing\r\nthe same titles have been of quite another calibre, have been swayed\r\nby different influences, and above all have exhibited no such knowledge\r\nof the affairs with which they had to deal as their predecessors of the\r\nPalmerstonian era. Many explanations may be given for the new departure\r\nwithout disparagement of the capacities of the individuals concerned.\r\nSuch explanations interest those who may desire to promote reform in the\r\nconstitution and the inspiration of the Foreign Office. It suffices us\r\nmerely to note the fact by way of accounting for some of the shortcomings\r\nwhich have been laid to the charge of our representation in China. We\r\nhave seen how easily one Foreign Secretary yielded to the meretricious\r\nsolicitations of the envoy Burlingame, and how another allowed himself\r\nto be cajoled by the Marquis Tsêng. After these, and sundry other such,\r\nexhibitions it was impossible for any Minister serving the country in\r\nthe Far East to place the old reliance on the support of his Government.\r\nWith John Bright, the implacable opponent of Palmerston and his works,\r\ninstalled at the Board of Trade, whose word was law on such matters\r\nas Chinese commercial treaties, and apparently more anxious to undo\r\nthe work of Palmerston than to promote a trade which both he and his\r\ndepartment unaffectedly despised, it was not likely that the commercial\r\ncommunities trading with China should cherish any hope of redress of\r\ngrievances from a Government whose face seemed set against them. Apathy,\r\ntherefore, became the principle, to keep the peace at all sacrifices the\r\navowed policy of British diplomacy in China. The apparent exception to\r\nthis rule in the attempted reclamations in connection with the Margary\r\nmurder in 1875 afforded in its abortive ending a new corroboration of\r\nthe rule. The diplomatic and consular establishments went on grinding out\r\nroutine despatches and publishing statistical reports, but with the tacit\r\nunderstanding that whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. Under\r\nsuch conditions it was of little consequence how the Peking representation\r\nmight be filled, since it has not for thirty years risen above the level\r\nof comedy, the term applied to it by those who have grown old in its\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation of affairs when the greatest crisis in the history\r\nof China, or of foreign relations with that country, was sprung upon\r\nthe world in 1894. A Legation equal only to clerical routine suddenly\r\ncalled upon to play a part in a commotion which unhinged the policy of\r\nthe world was totally inadequate to the strain, and as a consequence of\r\nthe impotence of the Foreign Office and its agent in China, the interests\r\nof Great Britain and, what was only second in importance, the interests\r\nof the Chinese empire were allowed to go by default. The Chinese were,\r\nand perhaps even still remain, unconscious of the reasons of the collapse\r\nof their empire. Perhaps something of the same kind might be said of\r\nthe British Foreign Office in regard to the interests of Great Britain\r\nin China. Certainly there is as yet little sign of a determination to\r\nreform the mechanism of the country's representation, and this, perhaps,\r\nbecause the preliminary step thereto would be the reform of the Foreign\r\nOffice itself. And so the Legation goes on under the nominal headship\r\nof a Minister who must be guided entirely by his Chinese Secretary, an\r\nofficial of inferior rank and position to the body of consuls whom he has\r\nto control, and for whose authority they can never have genuine respect.\r\n\r\nThe recent upheaval has offered many new opportunities of distinction for\r\nthe consuls, especially in the interior of China. That these openings\r\nhave infused new life into the consular ranks has been shown in many\r\nways during the last few years; and if natural selection be allowed to\r\noperate freely and the best men be not discouraged in their efforts for\r\ntheir country's benefit by undue interferences from Peking, where there is\r\nneither knowledge nor capacity to guide them, it is still possible that\r\nthe consular service may play a valuable part in the reconstruction of\r\nthe foreign relations of China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nCHINA AND HER RULERS.\r\n\r\n    Longevity of the State--Government by prestige--Necessity\r\n    of adaptation to European ideas--The Empress-dowager--Prince\r\n    Kung--Wênsiang--Hu Lin-yi--Tsêng Kwo-fan--Tso Tsung-tang--Chang\r\n    Chih-tung--Li Hung-chang--His long and consistent career--Efforts\r\n    at reorganising national forces.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe long continuance of a State more populous than any other on record is\r\na phenomenon which to thoughtful minds can hardly fail to evoke a feeling\r\nakin to reverence. De Quincey declared if he met a Chinaman he would\r\nmake obeisance to him, saying, \"There goes a man 2000 years old.\" Be the\r\ncauses of this national longevity what they may, the fact should make us\r\npause to consider on what foundation does this great vital national system\r\nrest? The most realistic word-painter of China represents the country as\r\na collection of villages, each being a unit of self-government,[29] and\r\nin describing \"village life\" in minute detail, seems to depict the great\r\nempire, of which each village is a pattern in miniature. Dynasties may\r\ncome and dynasties may go, but the Chinese families, their industries\r\nand their customs, go on for ever. It is remarkable with what ease the\r\npeople adapt themselves to changes in their ruling powers, regardless\r\nof race or origin; indeed it is a noteworthy fact that the rulers have\r\nfor many centuries been more often foreign than native.[30] Foreign,\r\nhowever, not quite in the sense in which the word is so easily translated\r\n\"barbarian\" by the Chinese, and applied by them to the hated Aryans of\r\nthe West. The rulers of China have been of cognate races, more or less\r\nimbued with the same generic ideas as the Chinese themselves, and with\r\ntastes akin to theirs. How this succession of dynasties, each established\r\nby violence, has coexisted with the continuity of the grand national\r\nidea of the emperor being the Son of Heaven can only be explained by the\r\nvery practical character of the race, who accept the usurper as divinely\r\nappointed from the moment he has proved himself successful. What holds,\r\nand has held together from ancient times, this great aggregate of mankind\r\nin common usages and ideas is naturally a mystery to Occidentals, the\r\ncohesive principle not being perceptible to them. China occupies the\r\nunique position of a State resting on moral force,[31] a conception almost\r\nas alien to the Western mind as material progress is to the Eastern, hence\r\nthe proposition is apt to be received with amused contempt. Yet a State\r\nadministered without police, and ruled without an army, is a something\r\nwhich cannot be explained away. Government by prestige is, other things\r\nbeing equal, surely the most economical as well as the most humane of all\r\nspecies of government; but an obvious consequence is that in emergencies\r\nthe Government is beholden to volunteers, and is often driven to enlist\r\nthe services of banditti and other forces proscribed by the law. Imperial\r\nprestige, which embraces the relations of the surrounding tributaries,\r\nis but an expansion of the authority of the head of the family and of\r\nthe elders of the village, which rests on moral sanction only. The first\r\ncollision, however, with the material forces of Christendom proved that\r\nin the system of the modern world the Chinese principle of government\r\nwas an anachronism, and that moral must succumb to physical force. Yet\r\nin the midst of the world's triumph in the pricking of the great Chinese\r\nbubble, it had been well to reflect what the kind of bubble was that was\r\nbeing pricked. China with her self-contained, self-secreted knowledge,\r\ncould not be expected to foresee how the impact of the West was likely to\r\naffect her ancient polity. She had nothing wherewith to compare herself,\r\nand no criterion of good or evil except her own isolated experience; nor\r\ndid she know aught of human development except what was, so to speak,\r\nforcibly injected into her, but never assimilated. What, then, could she\r\ndo to be saved but to take herself entirely to pieces like a house that\r\nhas to be rebuilt on a new plan, and so fit herself for the companionship\r\nand competition of the worldly Powers, from whose pressure she could by\r\nno means escape? She had to put away the wisdom of ages, the traditions\r\nof a civilisation unbroken for thousands of years, and convert herself\r\ninto a mechanical, scientific, and military Power. Something more radical\r\nthan reform is involved in such a root-and-branch change: it was not\r\nimprovement but transformation that was demanded.\r\n\r\nThat some such essential changes are necessary to the preservation of\r\nthe Chinese empire is probably recognised by all who interest themselves\r\nin the subject--including a large ever-increasing number of the Chinese\r\nthemselves; but the gravity of the revolution may well cause misgivings\r\nboth as to its possibility and its incalculable effects. Who among the\r\nChinese rulers is sufficient for such things?\r\n\r\nIt is not always possible to locate the nervous centre of any Government\r\nin the West, whether its form be autocratic or representative. With\r\nregard to that of China we may safely say it is never possible--at\r\nleast for any foreigner. The attempts which have been from time to time\r\nmade to assign acts of Government to the will or influence of certain\r\nindividuals have in general proved in the sequel to have been far from\r\nhitting the mark. The monarch under whose authority the whole machine\r\nmoves is not necessarily the directing will: indeed he is very often\r\nlittle better than a puppet. \"The eunuchs, concubines, and play-actors,\r\nwho constituted the Court of the late Emperor Hsien-fêng, the father of\r\nthe present young emperor, had more influence probably in bringing on\r\nthe war that led the Allies to Peking than any of the high officers or\r\nMinisters,\" wrote Sir Rutherford Alcock in 1871. Another writer put it in\r\na more paradoxical form: \"There is in China something more powerful than\r\nthe Emperor, and that is the Viceroy; more powerful than the Viceroy,\r\nand that is the Taotai; more powerful than the Taotai, and that is the\r\nWeiyuen,\" meaning that the power of obstruction, extending through every\r\ngrade of officialdom, is most widely diffused at the base. Official\r\nresponsibility and moral responsibility do not therefore coincide--men\r\nin highest positions being unable to do the things they would, while the\r\nthings they would not they are often obliged to do. The Government is\r\nconsequently carried on by continual compromise beyond the limits to which\r\nwe are accustomed in Western Governments, because it is not confronted\r\nwith outspoken opposition with which it can reason, but with a network\r\nof secret machinations which can only be met by correlative tactics. But\r\nthough Government in China may seem by this state of things to be reduced\r\nto an almost passive condition, yet the individuality of statesmen is\r\nnot altogether destroyed. In some respects, indeed, the circumstances\r\nwe have noted rather favour the influence of men of mark; for where the\r\ncomplicated machine is held in a state of equilibrium by innumerable\r\nneutralising checks, it would appear that any determined will could set\r\nit in motion in a given direction. The character of Chinese statesmen,\r\ntherefore, is not a factor to be ignored in considering either the present\r\nor the future of China, although the very partial knowledge of them which\r\nis accessible to Europeans must constantly lead to erroneous conclusions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the statesmen who have appeared since the opening of Peking in 1860,\r\nit would probably be fair to consider the two emperors as negligible\r\nquantities. The potent personage in the empire during that period is\r\nno doubt the Empress-dowager, who has, in so far as any one can be\r\nsaid to have done so, ruled China for forty years. Apart from ethical\r\nconsiderations, which have less to do with matters of government than\r\ncould be wished, the empress's characteristics are clearness of purpose,\r\nstrength of will, a ready accommodation of means to ends, and frank\r\nacceptance of the inevitable. There are no signs of the bigot or the\r\ndoctrinaire about her. Mundane in her objects, she is practical in seeking\r\nthem; and if to hold an entirely anomalous position of authority opposed\r\nto legitimacy and the traditions of the dynasty and the empire be evidence\r\nof success, then the empress-dowager must be admitted to be a successful\r\nwoman. In the position she has occupied, and still occupies, she would\r\nappear to be the principal force in the State. Whatever may be her power\r\nof initiative, which is so attenuated in the high State functionaries,\r\nher power of veto probably stands pre-eminent.\r\n\r\nThe anomalous relations which have subsisted between the empress-dowager\r\nand her imperial nephew are too intricate for us to attempt to unravel\r\nthem. But the facts resulting from them, which are patent to the world,\r\npoint to conditions which are not without danger to the empire. Indeed\r\nthe Emperor himself constituted such a danger from the moment when as\r\nan infant he was placed on the Dragon Throne by usurped authority. His\r\npersonal imperfections added materially to that danger, and his final\r\nefforts to free himself from the leading-strings of his patroness have\r\nindefinitely enhanced the evil by destroying the personal prestige\r\nof the sovereign. For what can be thought of a Son of Heaven who has\r\nhis prerogatives doled out to him and again withdrawn by the will of\r\nanother, and where is the force to meet the crisis in the State which\r\nmay yet result from the illegitimacy of the emperors succession? The\r\nworship accorded throughout the empire to the Son of Heaven may indeed be\r\ntransferred unimpaired to a new possessor of that dignity. But a reigning\r\nemperor shorn of his governing faculty must, one would think, put the\r\nallegiance of the people to a severe strain. How far such considerations\r\nmay go in weakening the ties of loyalty in the provinces and in letting\r\nloose the spectre of rebellion cannot be known, but it may be guessed and\r\nfeared.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLeaving out the Camarilla of the Court, of whom nothing certain can\r\nbe predicated, the executive statesmen who have to outward appearance\r\ndirected the public affairs of the Chinese empire for forty years may\r\nalmost be counted on the fingers of one hand. Prince Kung, the highest in\r\nstation and nearest to the throne, was rather a moderating than an active\r\nforce in the State, and his attention was very much divided between public\r\naffairs and those of more personal concern. His colleague, Wênsiang, was a\r\nmore energetic character. By common consent he was the most conscientious\r\nas well as the most liberal-minded statesman that China has produced\r\nduring the sixty years of foreign intercourse. Mr Adkins, who knew him\r\nintimately in the early days, says: \"He was courteous in manner and a\r\nlively conversationalist. He once told me over the teacups that, if he\r\ncould have his will, every brick and stone of Hongkong city should be torn\r\ndown and thrown into the sea.\" This was not the kind of language he held\r\nat a later period; for, in a private interview with Sir Rutherford Alcock\r\nin 1869, while admitting the hostility of his class and that he himself\r\nhad originally shared all their prejudices, he declared that his long and\r\nintimate relations with the foreign Legations had opened his eyes to the\r\nfavourable side of the foreign character and progressive policy. Perhaps\r\nthe best account of this Manchu statesman is that given by Sir Rutherford\r\nAlcock himself in an article in 'Fraser's Magazine,' 1871:--\r\n\r\n    Wênsiang is by far the most distinguished, both from his superior\r\n    knowledge and his intellectual grasp of the position occupied\r\n    by China in its relations with foreign States.... As a member of\r\n    the Grand Secretariat, and vested with other high functions, his\r\n    influence is very great, both personal and official--subject,\r\n    nevertheless, to such attenuation as the active hostility of a\r\n    very powerful party of anti-foreign functionaries within and\r\n    without the palace can effect. This party, if party that can\r\n    properly be called which is composed of nearly the whole of\r\n    the educated classes of the empire--officials, literati, and\r\n    gentry--are unceasing in their opposition to all progressive\r\n    measures, whether emanating from the Foreign Board or elsewhere.\r\n    But Wênsiang is held in especial hatred as the known advocate of a\r\n    policy of progressive improvement with foreign aid and appliances.\r\n    The failure of the Lay-Osborn fleet very nearly effected his ruin,\r\n    and that of his patron the prince [Kung] also, and has ever since\r\n    told against his influence. The cost and humiliation of that most\r\n    disastrous experiment were all visited on his head, and it has no\r\n    doubt tended not solely to impair his power, but also to render\r\n    him more timid and less disposed to make any further venture in\r\n    the same direction. He has the reputation among his own people of\r\n    being honest, and foreigners know him to be patriotic and earnest\r\n    in what he believes to be for the good of his country, while\r\n    far in advance of all his contemporaries in enlightened views\r\n    as to how in the actual situation of affairs that end may best\r\n    be served. Upon occasions he can be both bitter and sarcastic,\r\n    and speaks out his mind plainly enough against the pretensions\r\n    of foreigners to shape everything to their own ends in China. He\r\n    nevertheless gets little credit from the opposite faction for\r\n    patriotism or a disinterested love of his country, and of late\r\n    there has been remarked, with failing health, an expression of\r\n    weariness, as if he were losing heart and hope, and began to feel\r\n    unequal to any further struggle. With the ever-increasing demands\r\n    for better execution of treaties--in things often materially and\r\n    legally impossible in the present state of affairs, for larger\r\n    facilities and increased privileges on the foreign side, and\r\n    the gathering of hostile elements in front and all round him\r\n    proceeding from the Chinese national party, who would refuse\r\n    everything, and, if left to themselves, precipitate the country\r\n    into another war with the Western Powers, he may well feel weary.\r\n\r\nWênsiang, in short, suffered the fate of those who are too liberal and\r\ntoo far advanced for their surroundings, and became a martyr to his own\r\ndisappointment. Old before his time, and overwhelmed with difficulties\r\nwhich he was unable to surmount, his mind became depressed, and his death\r\nin 1876 cost China the ablest, the best, and most devoted of her public\r\nmen. No doubt there have been good and well-meaning men since his time,\r\nboth in the Tsungli-Yamên, the Great Council, and in the provincial\r\ngovernments; but none of them has shown any quality of leadership, and\r\nall have for the most part been content with the maxim, \"Sufficient for\r\nthe day is the evil thereof.\"\r\n\r\nThe comparatively early death of Hu Lin-yi, a Hunanese, Governor of the\r\nprovince of Hupei, who, in conjunction with Kuanwen, the Governor-General\r\nof the Hu provinces, originated the scheme for repressing the Taiping\r\nrebellion, prevented him from receiving the credit of that notable\r\nachievement. The institutions of the country paralysed its defence, for\r\na provincial army was an object of dread to the Manchu rulers, while they\r\npossessed no imperial organisation to cope with the calamity. No attempt,\r\ntherefore, could be made to organise a force to resist the rebellion,\r\nand so the devastation was allowed to spread from province to province\r\nwithout check. Hu Lin-yi set himself to overcome this difficulty, and\r\nthought out a scheme by which the rebellion might be overcome. Before\r\ntaking any action, however, it was necessary that he should bring the\r\nPeking Government to his views, which he accomplished by first converting\r\nthe Governor-General, who was a Manchu. The two thereupon joined in a\r\nmemorial to the throne, praying that they might be permitted to raise in\r\nthe Central Provinces a mobile military force to repel the invasion of\r\nthe insurgents.\r\n\r\nThe nucleus of this force already existed in the province of Hunan, where\r\nvolunteer levies under the leadership of Tsêng Kwo-fan, the father of the\r\nlate Marquis Tsêng, Minister to Great Britain, had done good service in\r\nseveral small engagements with the rebels. The execution of the general\r\nscheme of defence against the rebels fell naturally, therefore, to the\r\nlot of Tsêng, who during his subsequent governor-generalship of the Lower\r\nYangtze had the honour of putting an end to the ravages of the Taipings.\r\nNo man was held in higher esteem among the counsellors of the Chinese\r\nempire than this sagacious statesman. At once moderate and resolute, he\r\nperceived the need of accommodation to the exigencies of the new time, and\r\nthough he would have resisted the ingress of foreigners to the uttermost,\r\nhe had the wisdom to see that this was no longer possible, and the advice\r\ntendered to his sovereign, while tempered to the susceptibilities of the\r\nCourt, was distinctly in favour of respecting the treaties and avoiding\r\nconflict with foreign nations.\r\n\r\nA contemporary of Tsêng Kwo-fan, and his equal in rank and authority,\r\nwas Tso Tsung-tang, best known as the Conqueror of Kashgar, where he was\r\ncredited with military exploits which history will scarcely ratify. He\r\nwas a thoroughgoing man, blunt in manner, but straightforward, and loyal\r\nto his engagements. He was somewhat rash and uncompromising, seeking the\r\nend sometimes without considering the means, and his opinion on matters of\r\nState would have carried no weight but for his reputation for exemption\r\nfrom the prevailing vice of his class--financial corruption. This\r\ncharacter obtained him toleration for many originalities. On one occasion\r\nhe camped outside the walls of Peking for several days because he refused\r\nto pay the customary exactions of the officials in charge of the gates,\r\nso that his audience of the emperor seemed likely to be indefinitely\r\npostponed. But high officials in China of austere views have usually a\r\nman of business in attendance who oils the wheels while saving the face\r\nof their master. Tso's money matters were in the hands of a very politic\r\ngentleman of this class, and so the Grand Secretary's entry into the city\r\nwas duly arranged. Tso had a lofty idea of the dignity of his country,\r\nand of the necessity for its defending itself against all enemies.\r\nTo this end he threw his energies into the development of the arsenal\r\nand shipbuilding-yard at the Pagoda anchorage in the Foochow river. He\r\nwas generally considered an opponent of his younger contemporary, Li\r\nHung-chang, the one being held to stand for the old conservatism of China,\r\nand the other for its liberalisation. They were for many years the two\r\nchief provincials, the one being Imperial Commissioner for the southern\r\nand the other for the northern ports of China. It was customary for the\r\nemperor to refer important questions connected with foreign affairs to\r\nthese two advisers, whose opinions must very often have neutralised each\r\nother. In the end Tso recognised the necessity for a change of policy for\r\nthe preservation of the empire, but being himself too old to change he\r\nrecommended his rival, Li Hung-chang, to the Throne as the fitting man to\r\nintroduce needed innovations. If the records are to be implicitly trusted\r\nTso would appear to have undergone a sort of death-bed repentance, for\r\nin his political testament, a document which is regarded with a kind of\r\nsacred authority in China, he recommended to the throne the improvements\r\nhe had steadfastly opposed, including even the introduction of railways\r\ninto the country.\r\n\r\nAlthough out of the chronological order, we may mention here another\r\neminent official, distinguished by many of the characteristics of\r\nTso Tsung-tang, who has been Governor of the province of Shansi,\r\nGovernor-General of the Canton provinces, and is now Governor-General of\r\nthe central provinces. Wherever he has been, Chang Chih-tung has proved\r\nhimself bold and original. His open mind has led him to take up schemes\r\nwarmly without counting the cost, and under his inspiration immense sums\r\nhave been spent in both his viceroyalties for which but little return\r\nwas obtained, and of which indeed it was scarcely possible to render a\r\nclear account. His reputation for purity, however, has saved him from\r\nthe consequences of his recklessness, both in the eyes of the people and\r\nof the Government, and enabled him to hold office long enough to show\r\nsome results of his expensive enterprises. The great ironworks which he\r\nset up in Hanyang, with very little consideration as to how they were to\r\nbecome effective, have at last produced iron of a quality sufficient to\r\nmake inferior rails, thus giving an earnest of the ultimate realisation\r\nof his dream of rendering China independent of foreign countries. Chang's\r\nliterary power is of a very high order, his style is terse and incisive,\r\nand this is a weapon which renders him formidable in a country which\r\ncultivates literature as a religion. To say that Chang Chih-tung is\r\nthe opponent of foreigners is merely to credit him with the ordinary\r\npatriotism of his countrymen. But though he often treats strangers with\r\nthe studied discourtesy which characterised the older generation of\r\nChinese officials, he has never allowed his prejudices to stand in the\r\nway of free intercourse with any foreigner whom he thought he could make\r\nsubservient to some purpose of his own. As a statesman Chang Chih-tung has\r\nfailed through intensity and want of comprehensiveness. In fact he is not\r\na statesman, but a sciolist, and a trenchant essayist, unaccustomed to\r\naccommodate his ideas to the circumstances of actual life. He, too, has\r\nbeen a bitter opponent of Li Hung-chang, which, however, did not hinder\r\nhim from composing a most fulsome panegyric on that statesman on the\r\noccasion of his seventieth birthday, in which he was credited with all\r\nthe attributes of all the heroes of Chinese mythology. The many fantastic\r\nschemes which Chang has originated would in any Western country have\r\nrelegated their author to the custody of the Commissioners of Lunacy.\r\nOne of these was to prevent foreign ships entering the Gulf of Pecheli\r\nby sinking tiers of junks between Shantung and Talien-wan; another was\r\nto catch the Japanese soldiers in a gigantic locust-trap, consisting of a\r\ndeep trench to be dug at their supposed landing-place near Shanhai-kwan,\r\nand the fact of this proposal being seriously adopted and some miles\r\nof the trench actually dug by the Chinese soldiers reveals more of the\r\nmilitary impotence of China than the most voluminous dissertations.\r\n\r\nWithout carrying the exhaustive process further, it is safe to say that\r\nwhatever concrete statesmanship there has been in China during the past\r\ngeneration has been embodied in the person of Li Hung-chang. He alone has\r\na continuous record, has followed a definite line, and kept his ideals,\r\nlike a captive balloon, strictly attached to the earth on which he had\r\nto work. He also was a literate of distinction, having taken the highest\r\ndegree, that of the Hanlin College. But though his literary tastes have\r\nnot been left wholly uncultivated, they have never intruded themselves\r\ninto his conduct of affairs, so that an estimate of his position cannot\r\nbe based upon his writings, but only on his actions. He indulged in no\r\nspeculations, propounded no theories, but was eminently a man of fact.\r\nContrary to all Chinese tradition he laid himself out for personal\r\nintercourse with foreigners, from whom he was never weary of learning, and\r\nin doing so he braved the odium of his peers, and incurred the charge of\r\ntreason as a truckler to barbarians. Living in the eyes of the world, both\r\nof his own and foreign countries, for a period of nearly forty years, he\r\nhas been the one familiar figure in modern China. His accessibility has\r\nafforded to travellers and visitors endless opportunities of delineation,\r\nso that if ever a Chinese of rank was known throughout the world it must\r\nbe Li Hung-chang.\r\n\r\nThe interest attaching to this statesman consists in his having in his\r\nown person, and without a party, stood between the Old World and the\r\nNew, having devoted his life to working out in practice a _modus vivendi_\r\nbetween them. His methods have been wholly empirical and opportunist, and\r\nhence no synthesis of his plan of operations is available, except such as\r\nwe may compose out of the facts themselves. A few cardinal principles,\r\nnevertheless, stand out clearly in the life-work of this statesman. One\r\nis that of reorganising the defensive forces of the empire in accordance\r\nwith the lessons learned from foreign raids; a second has been so to\r\nobserve the treaties made with foreigners as to afford them no ground\r\nfor complaint; and a third, when causes of difference arose, whether\r\nby inadvertence or by design, to agree with the adversary quickly. The\r\nfollowing out of the first two might very well have entailed upon Li the\r\nreproach of favouring foreigners; the following out of the third may with\r\ngreater justice have earned for him the character of a peace-at-any-price\r\nman. So consistently did he follow the line of action dictated by these\r\nprinciples, that no attacks on foreigners or on Christian missions have\r\never been tolerated within his jurisdiction. During the twenty-four years\r\nof his governor-generalship of Chihli, whose population is one of the most\r\nturbulent in the empire, there was not a single missionary outrage, his\r\ninstructions to his district officials being peremptory, that, right or\r\nwrong, they must have no questions with foreigners. Had the other viceroys\r\nbeen similarly minded and equally resolute, no attacks on missionaries\r\nwould have been recorded throughout the Chinese Empire. Though Li\r\nHung-chang was as much anti-foreign at heart as every true Chinaman\r\nmust be, he endeavoured, crudely following the example of the Japanese,\r\nto employ foreign men and appliances in order the more effectually to\r\nresist them. His pacific tendencies were no proof of pusillanimity, but\r\nrather of a deep consciousness, derived from personal experience, of the\r\nincapacity of China to resist foreign attack. Li Hung-chang's external\r\npolicy, therefore, may be defined as the strengthening of the country to\r\nmeet invasion, and the avoidance, while such preparations were being made,\r\nof every cause of collision with foreigners. These cardinal points had to\r\nbe kept in view, like guiding stars, amid the exigencies of daily affairs,\r\nwhich alone were sufficient to fill up the measure of one man's capacity.\r\nThe administration of two populous provinces, the superintendency of the\r\nmaritime trade of half the empire, and incessant consultations concerning\r\nimperial affairs generally, constituted a burden which no one man could\r\nbear. While to these were added the whole details of national defence,\r\nnaval and military reorganisation, the construction of a navy on foreign\r\nlines, the whole of which was undertaken by Li Hung-chang, working not\r\nonly without a party but practically without a staff, and at the mercy of\r\ntechnical advisers who owed him no allegiance. The briefest recapitulation\r\nof the duties so undertaken would be enough to stagger the credulity of\r\nthe most active administrator of the West; the recital would suffice,\r\nwithout any proof from experience, to show that these labours of Hercules\r\ncould never, in fact, be performed. But the difference between performance\r\nand non-performance marks the chasm which divides the Chinese from the\r\nWestern world, and distinguishes the order of ideas and practice which\r\nmake for the preservation, from those which tend to the disintegration,\r\nof the Chinese empire itself. The task from which the mass of Chinese\r\nstatesmen have recoiled, and which has only been attempted in a persistent\r\nmanner by Li Hung-chang himself, was probably beyond the power of any man\r\nand of any party.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut here the inquiry suggests itself, why a strong-headed and\r\npractical-minded man should have devoted a lifetime to impossible\r\nachievements, and why in a nation of great intellects the task should\r\nhave been virtually relegated to one man? The Chinese are not fools;\r\ntheir mental capacity is second to that of no other race. Their culture is\r\nexcessive, though narrow; and if we find them exhibiting in great national\r\naffairs no more intelligence than that shown by children in building\r\ncastles of sand, it is natural to conclude that there is some fundamental\r\nmisconception either on their part or on ours of the problem before them.\r\nBut if we consider the Chinese as belonging to the world of moral force,\r\nthen their misconception of all that belongs to the world of physical\r\nforce is not only explicable, but it is inevitable; for between the two\r\nthere is no common ground on which even a compromise might be effected,\r\nand the one must eternally misunderstand the other.\r\n\r\nThe burden of the memorials of the Chinese high functionaries on this\r\nsubject have been that the Middle Kingdom being overcome by the brute\r\nforce of the rebellious barbarians, the obvious way to restore the\r\nlapsed authority of the empire was to acquire the instruments of foreign\r\nstrength. This they diligently set themselves to do, but apparently\r\nwithout the slightest comprehension of the secret of the strength of the\r\nforeigners. The Chinese being what they were, could no more win the secret\r\nof the Western power by buying its weapons than a musical tyro could hope\r\nto rival the greatest artistes by possessing himself of a Stradivarius.\r\nGuns, ships, explosives of the latest type, are worse than dummies without\r\nthe organised human force that gives them life. The element which would\r\nhave infused vitality into the new organisation was the one thing beyond\r\ntheir imagination, and so far as they did comprehend it, it inspired them\r\nwith aversion and awe, for it meant in their eyes delivering the keys of\r\npower into the hands of strangers. What was needed to regenerate the army,\r\nto create a navy, to reform the finances, was the liberal importation\r\nof men. This necessity was no doubt partially perceived by Li Hung-chang\r\nand his like, but never entirely even by him; for he remained throughout\r\nthe one-eyed man among the blind, groping after something which he could\r\nonly guess at. Teachers from Europe and America were employed in the\r\ncountry, and natives were sent to foreign countries to be instructed;\r\nbut the spirit of the new instruction was never allowed to vitalise the\r\norganisation, and consequently all the knowledge that was acquired by both\r\nmethods remained barren and unfruitful. Thus Li Hung-chang's efforts fell\r\nshort of their object, and China continued to be the land of moral force\r\nfor the iron-shod physical forces to trample on.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest period of his career Li Hung-chang stood out far in\r\nadvance of his fellows, and in all the troubles which have beset the\r\nempire during his time, it is he who has been thrust into the breach and\r\nmade to bear the brunt of its misfortunes. Being the only man who did\r\nanything, he was naturally made responsible for all, and critics, both\r\nforeign and native, have had an easy task in laying bare his failures,\r\nwhich his contemporaries have escaped by confining themselves to official\r\nroutine and playing for their own safety. Though the burden of the State\r\nhas fallen upon the shoulders of Li Hung-chang more than upon any other\r\nindividual, he has never flinched from the responsibility. The occurrences\r\nof 1894 and subsequently threw him into greater prominence than ever\r\nbefore. Forced to carry on the war with Japan, during which the defences\r\nof the empire for which he was responsible completely broke down, he\r\nwas next also forced to make peace with that Power on very humiliating\r\nconditions. Seldom was a more pathetic scene witnessed than the virtual\r\ncontroller of the Chinese empire lying at the feet of a victorious enemy\r\nin a foreign country, with the bullet of an assassin in his cheek. More\r\ntragic still was his return to the capital with the treaty of Shimonoseki.\r\nAn intense feeling against Li had been roused throughout the country. The\r\nprovincial officials with singular unanimity denounced his treachery as\r\nthey considered it, for the treaty was in their eyes no less disgraceful\r\nthan the conduct of the war, for both of which Li alone was deemed\r\nresponsible. The sentiment of the provinces was echoed in Peking, where\r\nhis enemies in high places had almost secured the capital punishment of\r\nthe negotiator, and failing that, his assassination, from which fate he\r\nwas only saved by the veto of Prince Kung and the subsequent protection\r\nof the empress-dowager. He was also in an important sense under the\r\nprotection of Russia, that Power having undertaken to hold him harmless\r\nfrom the consequences of his surrender to the Japanese. In order to take\r\nhim out of the way of the conspiracies in Peking, Russia requested that\r\nan Imperial prince might be sent to the coronation ceremony in 1896.\r\nThat being impossible by the laws of the empire, which Russia very well\r\nknew, a substitute of the highest rank had to be found, and thus Li\r\nHung-chang was designated, by the approval of the empress-dowager and by\r\nthe consent--reluctant it is believed--of the Emperor, for the mission\r\nof congratulation to the Czar. After the festivities at Moscow, Li made\r\nthe tour of Europe and the United States, meeting everywhere with a\r\ndistinguished reception.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [29] Village Life in China. By Arthur Smith, D.D.\r\n\r\n [30] An ingenious friend, who was kind enough to read this passage\r\n    in MS., sent me the following suggestive note: \"King Solomon was a\r\n    thorough Chinaman, crafty, gaining the throne although the fourth\r\n    and youngest son of his mother; killing off the kingdom-maker,\r\n    Joab, and murdering the lawful heir, Adonijah. His fondness for\r\n    pomp and joss pidjin, witness the Queen of Sheba and the Temple;\r\n    love of trade, his ventures with King Hiram to Ophir. His apathy\r\n    in military affairs, leading to the breaking up of the empire.\r\n    His love of sententious maxims, Proverbs. His truly Chinese and\r\n    non-Hebrew syncretism, worshipping Ashtoreth, Moloch, and Chemosh,\r\n    as well as Jehovah. Now David, judging by the weak characters of\r\n    his children, was, like many famous men in history, the reverse of\r\n    prepotent. Solomon was a son of erewhile widow Bathsheba. Uriah\r\n    being a Hittite, she was presumably one also. So Solomon would\r\n    be practically a Hittite--i.e., Mongolian or Tartar; a striking\r\n    example of the newly-named but long-observed phenomenon called\r\n    telegony or 'throwing back.' Solomon 'threw back' to the first\r\n    sire, Uriah.\"\r\n\r\n [31] \"The boasted influence that the Government of China possesses\r\n    over its subjects is almost entirely _moral_, and they really do\r\n    not possess the power to cope with a popular tumult, which is the\r\n    object of their greatest dread.\"--H. Parkes, at Foochow, May 1,\r\n    1846, _æt._ seventeen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nCHINA'S AWAKENING.\r\n\r\n    Prestige gained, 1880-90--Yields to Japan in Korea while\r\n    reasserting full suzerainty--The lessons of adversity--Schemes for\r\n    naval and military reforms--Purchase and manufacture--Provincial\r\n    system antagonistic to reform--Li Hung-Chang's efforts--Faithful\r\n    service of foreign experts--Drill-instructors--Creation of a\r\n    navy--Coast fortification--Superior efficiency of navy compared\r\n    with army--Corruption and nepotism--Awakening of China apparent,\r\n    not real.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe service of the navy in the conveyance of troops and of a special\r\nenvoy to Korea in 1882 was the first which that luckless force was able\r\nto render to China. The service was repeated on two other occasions:\r\nwhen a High Commissioner was sent on a mission of imperial condolence\r\nin 1890, and again when an assassin was rescued from the revenge of\r\ncounter-assassins and conveyed safely from China to Korea in 1894. The\r\nlittle kingdom thus played a considerable part in the awakening scenes of\r\nthe suzerain empire.\r\n\r\nOn a retrospective view, indeed, it would appear that during the period\r\nin question China passed the culminating-point in her efforts to regain\r\nnational prestige. She had just asserted herself in an unexpected manner\r\nin her dealings with Russia, playing a very different part in regard to\r\nher distant and worthless possessions in the north-west from what she\r\nhad done twenty years before in regard to the integral part of her proper\r\nterritories in the north-east, which she had surrendered with scarcely a\r\nprotest. The world began to respect China as a power. Her decisive action\r\nin Korea showed that she was no longer disposed to permit her neighbours\r\nto trifle with the question of her suzerainty in that kingdom, and for\r\nten years she was pre-eminent there in fact as well as of right. Yet\r\nwith a significant qualification. For, being challenged by Japan while at\r\nwar with France in 1885, she was unable to vindicate her sole supremacy\r\nin Korea, and was constrained to admit her rival into partnership. Thus\r\nwas the first irrevocable step taken towards the future realisation\r\nof the Japanese designs on the peninsula. A _condominium_ must ever be\r\ndestructive to the policy of the less energetic member, and the treaty\r\nconcluded between Li Hung-chang and Count Ito in 1885 was the fatal\r\nprelude to the events of ten years later. As the treaties granting to\r\nRussia a coequal right of navigating the Amur and a joint ownership of\r\nthe Usuri province constituted the virtual surrender of Chinese rights,\r\nso any treaty with Japan, no matter on what conditions, respecting Korea,\r\nwas a virtual abdication of the Chinese suzerainty. The right in common\r\nto send troops into Korea on notice given could have no other effect than\r\nto deliver up the kingdom to the Power which was the most alert in taking\r\nadvantage of the agreement. In giving up half her rights China retreated\r\nfrom an inexpugnable position, and left herself no footing for defending\r\nthe remaining half, when its turn came to be assailed.\r\n\r\nBut with the irony which is the very pathos of human and national decline,\r\nthe outward pretence to authority became more demonstrative as the\r\nsubstance of the claim slipped away. Not for two hundred and fifty years\r\nhad China asserted her prerogative with such uncompromising arrogance\r\nas when she sent an imperial mission of condolence to the royal Court in\r\n1890, years after the keystone of her Korean arch had been pulled away. It\r\nwas also about this period that the Chinese Minister to England lent his\r\nname to a manifesto warning the world of the coming resurrection of China.\r\n\"The sleep and the awakening\" strictly followed the law above alluded to,\r\nthat hollowness, not solidity, makes the loudest sound.\r\n\r\nBut so many interests are now inextricably interwoven with the destinies\r\nof China that her effort at reform and its failure compel us to give\r\nattention to the opening of a new chapter in the world's history. The\r\nhumiliating foreign invasions, the three rebellions that shook the\r\nempire, and the numerous minor risings, had all left their impression.\r\nThe lessons taught by these adversities had been taken to heart, and\r\nthe rulers of the empire were called upon to devise a remedy. The first\r\nand most obvious desideratum was, of course, naval and military reform,\r\nor rather regeneration, whereby they might be strengthened to speak\r\nwith their enemies in the gates. On this subject Chinese statesmen were\r\nabsolutely at one with their officious foreign advisers: it was a subject\r\nwhich inspired many of the early homilies of the British Minister, if no\r\nothers. There was, however, this essential difference in the conception of\r\nthe means of carrying out the reform, that the foreign advisers of China\r\nwere completely prepossessed by the notion that an imperial executive,\r\nif it did not exist, must be promptly created, while nothing was further\r\nfrom the imagination of the Chinese. They were entirely prepossessed\r\nby their tradition and the state of things actually existing, which\r\nthey did not dream of changing. That was the provincial system on which\r\nthe administration of the empire rested. The fiasco of the Lay-Osborn\r\nflotilla, which was the first crude attempt to mix the oil and vinegar\r\nof the two conflicting systems, revealed the fundamental, irreconcilable\r\ndivergence between the two sets of ideas, which rendered all advice\r\nfrom the one side to the other futile, and co-operation impossible. That\r\npalpable failure of the Central Government was calculated to discourage\r\nfresh innovations from the same quarter, and the incident was constantly\r\nreferred to by diplomatists as having blighted the promising career of\r\nWênsiang as a reformer, he being the minister personally responsible for\r\nthe scheme.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese, nevertheless, proceeded according to their own lights to set\r\ntheir house in order in so far as its defensive services were concerned.\r\nThe successful employment of foreign arms and foreign auxiliaries in the\r\nsuppression of the Taiping rebellion showed them the way. It was a natural\r\nbut a fatal error, which the Chinese have not to this day abjured, to\r\nattach too much importance to the arms, and too little to the man using\r\nthem. They accordingly commenced in a rather wild and wayward manner to\r\nbuy weapons and munitions, and then to set up in their own country the\r\nmeans of manufacturing the simpler kinds. The chief promoter, if not the\r\noriginator, of these novelties was Li Hung-chang, who continued to be the\r\npresiding genius of military and naval reform, no matter in what province\r\nhis official duties happened to lie. The personal authority wielded by\r\nthe Grand Secretary in provinces beyond his own government was really\r\na step towards centralisation of the executive, and with time and an\r\nadequate succession of followers in the same path there is no telling what\r\nchanges in the Government system might not have been evolved from such a\r\nnucleus. But the one-man power was unequal to any great result; it also\r\nweakened with age, opposition, and discouragement. The actual reforms\r\ninaugurated remained strictly provincial, and even local. There was no\r\nevidence of initiative or supervision from the Central Government. The\r\nnearest approach to it was the establishment of an arsenal at Tientsin by\r\nChunghou, the first superintendent of trade for the northern ports, and a\r\nmember of the imperial clan. It would almost appear as if the Government\r\nhad no concern with the more distant parts of the country, and the strange\r\nanomaly presented itself to the onlookers of large sums being expended on\r\nthe most modern artillery and in the manufacture of thousands of arms of\r\nprecision while the Peking field force was equipped with bows and arrows.\r\n\r\nThere came a time at last when the necessity of some kind of\r\ncentralisation was forced on the Government. It was after Prince Kung had\r\nbeen sent into retirement in 1884, when his younger brother, the father of\r\nthe emperor, had decided to \"come out\" and take a part in the executive\r\ngovernment, and especially after Prince Ch'un had made a short cruise in\r\nsalt water in 1886, that a Naval Board was established in Peking itself\r\nwith the prince at its head. The institution was of course laughed at,\r\nas the beginnings of things usually are, and its inefficiency was indeed\r\nglaring enough. It would have taken a generation in slow-moving China for\r\nsuch a board to have learned the rudiments of its duties.\r\n\r\nWhat we are at the moment concerned with is the naval and military reform\r\nof the twenty-five years preceding the advent of Prince Ch'un to power. In\r\nthe purchase of war material no single system was followed. The provincial\r\nrulers at Canton, Foochow, Nanking, and Tientsin no doubt had to sanction\r\nwhat was done within their respective provinces--a check which might be\r\nperfunctory or conscientious--but practically the management was in the\r\nhands of subordinate officials without knowledge or training or visible\r\nresponsibility. As in war each Chinese regiment fights for its own hand,\r\nor runs away as the case may be, so in the supply of arms each local\r\nofficial did pretty much what seemed right in his own eyes. Hence the\r\nheterogeneous composition of _matériel_, one small body of troops carrying\r\nin a campaign thirteen different patterns of rifle, with ammunition still\r\nmore curiously diversified.\r\n\r\nConcerning the arsenals established under the auspices of the various\r\ngovernors-general from Canton even to Kirin in Manchuria, and under\r\nthe technical management of foreigners, the most remarkable point to\r\nbe noted--and it applies generally to the employment of foreigners in\r\nChina--is the faithful service the Chinese have been able to command in\r\ncircumstances where it was hardly to be expected. An ignorant employer and\r\nan expert employee is a combination apt to engender the worst abuses, and\r\nthe way the Chinese selected their foreign executive--a marine engineer\r\nhere, a surgeon of a marching regiment there, a naval lieutenant somewhere\r\nelse--was not the way, one would have thought, to obtain either honesty\r\nor efficiency. Yet the foreigners selected either possessed or acquired\r\nadequate qualifications, and one and all rendered devoted service to\r\ntheir employers. The position of these foreigners, however, never was or\r\ncould be one of authority: whatever they did was under the orders of their\r\nChinese superior, who was often too ignorant to weigh the reasons for what\r\nwas done. In course of time the natives themselves became more instructed,\r\nbut whether their half-knowledge was a help or a hindrance to the work of\r\ntheir foreign experts is problematical. Of the quality or quantity of the\r\n_matériel_ turned out in the various Chinese arsenals it were useless to\r\nspeak. It produced an illusory sense of security, and for a time imposed\r\nequally on native and foreigner.\r\n\r\nNor was training entirely neglected. Drill-masters were engaged. Schools\r\nwere established in connection with the arsenals, where naval instruction\r\nespecially was carried to a high standard. Students sent to Europe\r\nproved themselves most apt to assimilate the instruction given to them.\r\nOf those who distinguished themselves at Greenwich may be mentioned the\r\npresent Minister to the Court of St James's. Cadets were also received\r\ninto the British navy, and some very expert officers were turned out by\r\nthese means. A large number of youths were at one time selected to be\r\neducated in the United States, remaining there long enough to learn to\r\nread and write English, and to become enamoured of Western life. This\r\neducational experiment was interesting in many ways. The youths who were\r\nsent to America under the care and at the instigation of the Cantonese,\r\nYung Wing, who had himself been educated in the United States, were\r\ndomiciled for the most part with private families there; and they so\r\nimbibed the influence of their surroundings that a high sense of honour\r\nwas developed in them. The writer can speak from personal experience of\r\nthe fidelity and efficiency of some of these students. Captain Clayson,\r\nwho had several serving under him in the \"Peiyang Squadron,\" has said that\r\nalthough on their return to China the authorities had distributed them in\r\nservices other than those for which they had been trained, yet because\r\nof the school discipline they had been subjected to, and the sense of\r\nhonour developed by their contact with Western people, he found them far\r\nmore useful and trustworthy than the men who had been trained in Chinese\r\nnaval schools. This experience seems to suggest that there are good moral\r\nqualities of the Chinese waiting, like the mineral ores in their country,\r\nfor an awakening influence. In all these progressive efforts Li Hung-chang\r\nretained the lead, and his own province was well in advance in educational\r\nenterprises. Besides a military school with German, and a naval school\r\nwith English, instructors, he set up within a mile of his Yamên a fairly\r\nfurnished medical school with a hospital attached. His special corps of\r\nforeign-drilled troops was the best equipped and best disciplined force\r\nin the empire.\r\n\r\nWhile all this progress was being made in the direction of military\r\nefficiency, the naval requirements of the country were not neglected. The\r\nfailure of the undigested Lay-Osborn scheme showed the Chinese that the\r\nnaval problem must be attacked in a different fashion. It was a false\r\nstart, and they must begin again. Accordingly, profiting by what they\r\nhad heard and seen of the efficient service rendered in their narrow\r\nwaters by foreign gunboats, the Chinese Government contracted with the\r\nArmstrong firm for a small flotilla carrying one heavy gun with a wide\r\nrange of fire. These craft were little more than floating gun-carriages;\r\nbut notwithstanding broad beam and flat bottoms, they were moderately\r\nsea-worthy. They were known as the Alphabeticals, from being named after\r\nthe Greek letters. This modest flotilla was the nucleus of the Chinese\r\nnavy.\r\n\r\nAttempts at naval construction were made at Shanghai, Foochow, and Canton;\r\nbut beyond providing work and training for native artificers, and acting\r\noccasionally as transports on a small scale, despatch-carriers, and\r\nofficial yachts, the vessels turned out from native yards rendered no\r\nservice to the country. The Chinese navy as a potential military arm only\r\ntook shape when Li Hung-chang was able to carry the Government with him so\r\nfar as to purchase effective war-ships in Europe, to institute a system of\r\ntraining under competent foreign officers, and to establish naval harbours\r\nwith docks and workshops. Two iron-clad battleships, a respectable\r\nsquadron of cruisers, and some smaller craft, manned by trained crews and\r\nofficered by men who had received a regular naval education and perfectly\r\nunderstood their duties, constituted the fighting navy of China. The two\r\nEnglish officers who supervised the training, Captain Tracy at Foochow\r\nand Captain Lang in the Gulf of Pechili, were thoroughly satisfied with\r\nthe capacity of both officers and men, and what was distinguished as the\r\nPeiyang or Northern Squadron was brought up by the latter officer to such\r\na state of efficiency that he reckoned that a further two years' drill\r\nwould enable the Chinese to take its place, on a small scale, among the\r\nbest equipped fleets in the world.\r\n\r\nAnd while the navy was developing so satisfactorily, coast fortifications\r\nalso made great progress. The mouths of rivers were all defended by\r\nthe best modern guns; three naval ports in the Gulf of Pechili--Port\r\nArthur, Weihai-wei, and Talien-wan--were fortified at great expense,\r\nand everything externally evinced a determination on the part of China\r\nto place herself in a position of independence, delivered from the fear\r\nof foreign attack, except of course by land, and even that had been\r\npartially provided for, as we have seen, by the military establishments\r\nin Manchuria.\r\n\r\nBetween the naval and the military preparations, however, there was an\r\nimmense disparity. The force for which Li Hung-chang was personally\r\nresponsible was carefully drilled, armed, fed, and paid, and, given\r\ncompetent leading, would no doubt have rendered a good account of\r\nitself; but the army as a whole was never brought to a state approaching\r\nefficiency. The navy, on the other hand, possessed the best ships and the\r\nbest armament that money could buy, with the most modern appliances for\r\nwar, and its _personnel_ was subjected to the most careful discipline.\r\nThe fortress guns were also of the newest and best pattern, and nothing\r\nwas spared, apparently, to fit them for the purpose for which they were\r\nintended. It was generally conceded that the fortresses so armed were safe\r\nfrom attack by sea.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the great difference between the organisation of\r\nthe sea and the land forces seems to be that the former, being a new\r\ncreation, was beyond the range of criticism and was unhampered by any\r\ntraditions, while the reform of the army was merely patching a worn-out\r\ngarment. The immemorial conditions of military service were unchanged.\r\nNo army was formed, but a series of local levies raised without cohesion\r\nor central control. The foreign instructors were kept strictly to their\r\nclass-work, were subordinated to the people whom they had to instruct,\r\nand possessed no kind of authority. They were allowed to drill the men,\r\nwhile the officers for the most part held themselves above the drudgery\r\nof the parade-ground. The few who had acquired a smattering of military\r\neducation in Europe were as helpless as the foreign drill-masters to move\r\ntheir wholly ignorant superiors. Hence abuses of the most grotesque kind\r\ndid not creep but rushed into every camp and every school, reducing the\r\nscientific teaching to a hollow farce.\r\n\r\nThe familiar factors of peculation and nepotism had an important influence\r\non these naval and military developments in China. Such things are no\r\nmonopoly of the Chinese. If corruption could ruin a State, it would not\r\nbe necessary to look so far afield as China for national disasters. But\r\nthe form which the vice takes in China has a determining effect on the\r\nadministration quite irrespective of the waste of resources and diminution\r\nof efficiency which are common to corruption in all its forms. Thus if we\r\nhave to reconcile the lavish purchases of material with the attenuation of\r\n_personnel_, we need only reflect that the former bring large emoluments\r\nwith little labour to the official employed, while the training of men\r\ninvolves much work and little profit. Further, if we want an explanation\r\nof the infinite diversity of the arms which are furnished to the troops,\r\nwe may find it in the excessive competition among officials for a share of\r\nthe traffic, and the interest which the higher authorities have in passing\r\nwithout inspection what is purveyed by their subordinates.\r\n\r\nNepotism in China is part and parcel of the family system, which is the\r\npalladium of the nation. Every military corps raised is essentially\r\nterritorial; and if ever it is moved from one province to another,\r\nit looks to a territorial chief, and no stranger can command it. Li\r\nHung-chang's disciplined troops, if not all of his own clan, were at\r\nleast the natives of his province and spoke his dialect. His subordinate\r\nofficials were blood relations and family adherents. It needs no argument\r\nto show how such a survival of feudalism militates against national\r\norganisation. Pure feudalism, indeed, would be less detrimental; for under\r\nit territorial exclusiveness would at least be balanced by territorial\r\nresponsibility, but under the short-service system of China a governor\r\nor governor-general may during his three years' term throw everything\r\ninto confusion and half ruin the finances of a province with which he is\r\nprecluded from having any territorial tie, and then proceed to another and\r\nrepeat the performance. The navy, though, as we have said, exempt from the\r\nincubus of tradition, was nevertheless unable to withstand the pressure of\r\nimmemorial heredity. As the first and principal naval school happened to\r\nbe at Foochow, it was natural that new battleships and cruisers should be\r\nofficered and manned in the first instance by natives of Fukien province.\r\nThe admiral, however, hailed from another province--that of Li Hung-chang.\r\nThough brave and capable, Admiral Ting was uneducated, and found it\r\nhard to hold his own among the captains and lieutenants who had been to\r\nGreenwich and could speak and write English, and some of them French.\r\nNeither the Chinese admiral nor the English co-admiral--who was led to\r\nbelieve he possessed authority, but was deceived--were able to repress\r\nthe intrigues which ran riot among the Foochow officers,--intrigues having\r\nfor their object the complete control of the fleet, the power of keeping\r\nout and admitting whom they chose without reference to qualifications,\r\nand the general determination to subordinate the naval service to\r\ntheir personal and family advantage. The presence of Captain Lang was a\r\nhindrance to their schemes, and they intrigued him out. But as the fleet\r\nbelonged to the north, they were unable to exclude northern seamen from\r\nthe country round Weihai-wei, who proved when the day of trial came the\r\nmost intelligent and the staunchest force that China possessed.\r\n\r\nThe Peiyang Squadron was the nearest approach to an imperial navy that\r\nChina ever possessed, and yet it was so far provincial that it could not\r\nbe sent into the central or southern waters without creating jealousy\r\non the part of the local authorities, just as if it had been a foreign\r\nforce. In 1891, when anti-foreign riots in various places on the Yangtze\r\nthreatened to endanger the peace of the empire, the Imperial Government\r\nallowed foreign ships of war to proceed up the river for the purpose\r\nof preventing outbreaks rather than offend the susceptibilities of the\r\nprovincial authorities by employing their own naval forces on that duty.\r\nDuring that critical period the Peiyang Squadron was cruising in Japanese\r\nwaters while the Great River was being patrolled by foreign gunboats.\r\n\r\nThese various evidences of martial energy procured for China the credit\r\nof a real awakening, and ensured her the respect due to a serious Power.\r\nYet the unsoundness of the foundation on which her new prestige rested was\r\nno secret to any one who took the trouble to consider the facts, for all\r\nthe weaknesses we have mentioned, with many more, were notorious to every\r\nforeign resident in China; nor was there a naval officer of any nation\r\nwho did not regard the fighting value of the Chinese fleet as nothing.\r\nShips were good, officers and men in themselves were passable, but without\r\norganisation, while the whole force was governed by other than militant\r\nprinciples. The attempted military reorganisation could, in fact, have no\r\nvitality except as a branch of a general reform of the administration,\r\nthe keystone of which was fiscal. Of this, however, the Chinese rulers\r\nseemed to take no heed, contenting themselves with snatching at what\r\nwas superficial and conspicuous to the eye. The Chinese florists in the\r\nspring-time supply to hawkers shrubs covered with blossom which is so\r\ncleverly attached by fine wire to the twigs as almost to deceive the\r\nelect. This is practically what the Chinese Government bad been doing with\r\ntheir national defences, so that on the first trial they collapsed like a\r\nsapless flower. These experiences have an important bearing on the large\r\nproblem of Chinese reform and reorganisation, and indeed on the continued\r\nexistence of the empire.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE COLLAPSE.\r\n\r\n    China clings to universal sovereignty--Demonstration of same\r\n    towards Korea--Irritating to Japanese--Their aspirations in\r\n    Korea--Insurrection in southern districts--Chinese troops sent\r\n    there--Japanese simultaneously occupy Korean capital--War between\r\n    China and Japan--China defeated--Causes and consequences--General\r\n    sympathy with Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that up to the end of 1892 the Chinese Government clung\r\nto the figment of universal sovereignty. Perhaps it was the figment\r\nthat clung to them, they not knowing how to drop it. When they had,\r\nunder stress, seemed to concede the principle of equality, it was not\r\ndone heartily, but to serve a momentary purpose. Like a belligerent\r\nwho continues a guerilla warfare after concluding peace, they fought\r\ninch by inch for the rags of the old prerogative after having by\r\ntreaty surrendered it. It had been long predicted that their refusal\r\nor inability to bring their theories into agreement with patent facts,\r\nand to come into line with the Powers of the world, must lead to tragic\r\nconsequences. Foreign nations laughed at the Chinese pretension as an\r\ninnocent archaic survival. But those individuals to whose lot it fell,\r\nin their own persons, to suffer the continued humiliation which was a\r\nconsequence of the survival, did not find the comedy of the situation\r\nquite so congenial. The high-spirited nation living in the closest\r\nneighbourhood to China, using its language and literature, was naturally\r\nmore galled by the Chinese assumption than those distant peoples who\r\nonly suffered in the persons of their diplomatic agents. Though it would\r\nbe more than the evidence warrants to say that the pretension of the\r\nChinese Government was directly provocative of the events of 1894, yet it\r\nis certain that it had a full share in filling the cup. Nowhere had the\r\nChinese conception of supremacy been exemplified in a more uncompromising\r\nform than in her relations with Korea. Her position as suzerain was a\r\nreality. She had in times past defended her tributary at great cost, had\r\nmarked the relationship by permanent monuments, and had maintained the\r\nrites necessary to keep her title alive. As late as 1890 the tributary\r\nformalities were repeated conspicuously before the world. In that year the\r\n\"Grand\" Queen-Dowager Chao of Korea died. According to custom the king\r\ndespatched a messenger to Peking to report the death to his suzerain.\r\nThe envoy presented his papers kneeling before the vice-president of the\r\nBoard of Rites. He was the bearer of a petition from the king descanting\r\non the miseries of his country, and expressing regret that, owing to the\r\nstraitened circumstances of his Court, he might be unable to carry out\r\nall the ceremonies required for the entertainment of the usual mission\r\nof condolence from the emperor; therefore, as \"an infant trusting to the\r\ntender mercies of his parents,\" the king begged that not a mission, but a\r\nmessage only, might be returned to him by the hands of his own envoy. The\r\nimperial decree in reply to this petition, while admitting the facts of\r\nthe situation as set forth by the king, nevertheless announced that the\r\ncustomary usage must be maintained, only an important concession would\r\nbe made to the poverty of Korea in the route which would be followed by\r\nthe new mission. Previous envoys had made the whole journey between the\r\ntwo capitals by land, and after entering Korean territory they had to\r\npass many stations in their slow march to the capital, involving much\r\nexpense to the country through which they travelled. All this would be\r\nsaved on the present occasion by the two commissioners travelling by sea,\r\nand landing at Chemulpo, a few miles only from the capital. The king had\r\nto submit to the modified burden, if such he really considered it. The\r\nceremonies observed were elaborate and impressive. Frequent prostrations\r\nby Korean officials before the emperor's tablet, and before the Imperial\r\nCommissioners, introduced the proceedings; afterwards the king was taken\r\ncharge of by the Chinese master of ceremonies, led through a complicated\r\nritual, and told to bend, kneel, _kotow_, and stand erect at so many\r\ndifferent stages that the mere reading of the official account of them\r\nis bewildering. The reporter's conclusion gives the gist of the whole\r\nceremonial from the Chinese point of view: \"The emperor's consideration\r\nfor his vassal State as evinced by his thoughtfulness in matters\r\npertaining to the mission is fathomless. How admirable and satisfactory!\r\nAnd how glorious!\"\r\n\r\nAll this was unexceptionably correct, and in its fantastic way expressed\r\nan actuality not to be contested. Yet to the Japanese, with their\r\nantagonistic policy, we can well understand that this renewed assertion\r\nof the Chinese suzerainty, after the convention of 1885, must have\r\nbeen highly irritating. Scarcely less so was the superior position\r\nhabitually assigned to the Chinese Resident over all the other foreign\r\nrepresentatives at the Korean Court. He alone at all times had the ear\r\nof the king; he was the only one privileged to enter the palace in his\r\nsedan chair, the others having to leave theirs at the gate and walk. While\r\nabstaining from interference in small things, the Chinese Resident did,\r\nin fact, direct the national policy of Korea so far as such a thing could\r\nbe said to exist.\r\n\r\nAs the affairs of Korea formed the occasion, if not the cause, of the\r\nJapanese War in 1894, it might seem desirable to refer once more to\r\nthe troubles and misgovernment of that country. To explain them would\r\nbe quite impossible, for to say that there are wheels within wheels,\r\nintrigue within intrigue, the whole revolving round a pivot of sordid\r\ncorruption, is perhaps the only general account that can be given of the\r\nstate of the Government and of its official hierarchy. But the conflict\r\nbetween China and Japan held on its way through the labyrinth of local\r\nintrigue, and eventually produced a result which, strange to say, seems\r\nnever to have been anticipated by any one outside the Government circles\r\nof Japan. The energetic Chinese Resident at the Korean Court may perhaps\r\nhave been needlessly ostentatious in asserting the legitimate paramountcy\r\nof China, but the aggression of the Japanese in various parts of the\r\ncountry, and the extravagant claims they founded upon these aggressions,\r\nreally called for a champion of Korean independence, a function which Yuan\r\nShih-kai[32] filled with considerable ability. The subordination of Korea\r\nto China was nowhere visible except in Court relations. The subjugation\r\nof the peninsula by the Japanese, on the other hand, was rapidly bringing\r\nthe population itself into bondage to alien merchants, adventurers, and\r\nusurers, actively supported by their own Government. If they had had\r\nthe patience to wait a few years, the Japanese must have won Korea by\r\nenergetic infiltration alone.\r\n\r\nBut these things did not move fast enough for the settled ambition\r\nof Japan, which she with diligence, unanimity, and wonderful secrecy\r\ndetermined to develop by force of arms. It would be idle to seek for\r\nthe causes of the war elsewhere than in this forward national policy\r\nof Japan. Alert as she had been to seize every chance that offered of\r\ndetaching Korea from her allegiance to China, her preparations were not\r\nsufficiently complete to justify her unmasking her whole policy until\r\n1894, when the grand opportunity for which she had been waiting, if she\r\ndid not actively assist in bringing it about, presented itself. What\r\nproved to be an ill-advised interference of China in the internal affairs\r\nof Korea furnished the occasion. An insurrection had broken out in the\r\nsouthern part of the peninsula, and the king had no forces to put it\r\ndown. Various versions had been circulated of the extent and character of\r\nthe insurrection; but when it had continued for some time, and nothing\r\nwas done to check it, the advisers of the Chinese Government became\r\napprehensive of interference by some foreign Power for the restoration of\r\norder. Strangely enough, Japan was the very last quarter from which this\r\ndanger was anticipated. The Chinese at length summoned resolution to send\r\na force to the king's assistance to put down the insurrection, but whether\r\nthe king in his heart desired this armed interference it is impossible\r\nfor us to say.\r\n\r\nLi Hung-chang was personally opposed to any such expedition, and when\r\ngoaded to action from Peking, where the bellicose spirit had been\r\ngenerated, he pointed out that no request had been received from the\r\nking. This omission was also remarked upon by the practical Admiral Ting,\r\nand both may have hoped that the absence of so important a link in the\r\nchain would enable them to avoid the overt action which they had the\r\nbest grounds for deprecating. Such a hope, if it existed, was of brief\r\nduration; for the King of Korea was induced, by influences brought to\r\nbear on him, \"to place himself in order\" and implore his suzerain for\r\nassistance, which the suzerain could no longer withhold. Then was Li\r\nHung-chang pressed by that body whose characteristic was the negation\r\nof initiative, the Tsungli-Yamên, and like a sluggish horse which once\r\ntakes the bit in its teeth, the Yamên became as impatient for action as\r\nin all its previous history it had been resolute in evasion. When but a\r\nfew days had elapsed since the issue of the order, and the troops were\r\nnot yet embarked, the Ministers, quite ignorant of what was involved in\r\nsending a military force across the sea, began to jeer Li Hung-chang on\r\nhis delay, hinting that he was perhaps growing stale with age. The troops\r\nwere, nevertheless, despatched all too soon. On their landing at Yashan\r\nin Southern Korea, the insurrection immediately collapsed: such was the\r\nprestige of the imperial authority.\r\n\r\nIn order to comply with the letter of the Li-Ito convention China\r\nnotified Japan officially of the despatch of these troops, some 2000\r\nin all, and of the purpose for which they were sent. But Japan had no\r\nneed to wait for any such formal intimation. She had her Intelligence\r\nDepartment, remarkably alert. Japanese--not perhaps always known as\r\nsuch--were employed in the Chinese official bureaus, even in the most\r\nconfidential departments, while Japanese in disguise swarmed in all the\r\nmilitary centres. The Chinese telegraph service has no secrets from any\r\none who thinks it worth his while to possess them. Consequently every\r\ndetail of the preparation, every point in the discussion, and every step\r\nin embarkation, was punctually telegraphed by the Japanese consul to the\r\nForeign Office in Tokio. Hence it was that Japanese troops arrived in\r\nKorea simultaneously with the Chinese, only they numbered 10,000 against\r\n2000, and instead of being assigned to the region of the insurrection,\r\nin accordance with the provisions of the Li-Ito convention, they marched\r\nstraight to the capital and took possession of the king. The insurrection\r\nhaving collapsed, the Chinese troops were under orders of withdrawal,\r\nand would have returned home in the same transports that conveyed them to\r\nKorea but for the unaccountable, and of course illegitimate, presence of\r\nJapanese troops at the capital. Notwithstanding the provocation to retain\r\nthe Chinese troops in Korea as a counterbalance to those, five times more\r\nnumerous, which had been sent by Japan, the Chinese authorities were\r\nadvised by their best friends to recall their troops, even though the\r\nJapanese should thereby be apparently left in possession of the field.\r\nThe Chinese would in that case have maintained an unassailably correct\r\nposition, and Japan would have had to dispense with her pretexts for war.\r\nEvacuation by the Chinese had been actually decided upon, and the steamer\r\nKowshing was chartered for the purpose of bringing back the troops. Before\r\nthe measure was carried out, however, other counsels prevailed, and that\r\nvery ship was employed in conveying more troops to reinforce the first\r\nexpedition, and in the midst of pretended negotiations for an arrangement\r\nbetween the two Powers, the Japanese sank the Kowshing on the high sea\r\nwith all on board.\r\n\r\nIt is usual, as a matter of form, if nothing else, to assign some specific\r\ncause for a war; but though many able writers have essayed to explain\r\nthe Japanese action in 1894, they have all of them left the question in\r\ngreater obscurity than they found it. Nor did the formal declaration of\r\nwar by the Mikado throw any light on the subject. A Japanese statesman\r\nbeing asked what the war was about, replied bluntly, \"It is to defeat\r\nChina,\" and the most elaborate exposition of motives or policy does\r\nnot carry us perceptibly further than this concise and straightforward\r\nstatement. The Chinese Government itself held precisely the same view as\r\nto the object of the war, though its perceptions were so obscured that\r\nit was quite unaware of its incapacity for defence. Neither did it during\r\nthe actual progress of hostilities realise the cause of its defeat. Indeed\r\nthere is no evidence to show that China has even to this day discovered\r\nthe secret of her impotence.\r\n\r\nThe course and immediate consequence of the war itself have been set forth\r\nin many books, and are so well known as to render it superfluous to enter\r\ninto any detail here. A few general points only need be mentioned as a\r\nkey to what followed.\r\n\r\n1. Russia took unusual pains to dissuade Japan from engaging in the war,\r\npointing out in clear terms that her interests would not allow her to be\r\nan indifferent spectator of any changes on the continent of Asia.\r\n\r\n2. Great Britain next endeavoured to patch up the supposed quarrel--which\r\ncould never be defined in words--between China and Japan, and on the\r\nday on which her agent in Tokio expressed himself confident that the\r\ndifferences, so far as he understood them, would be arranged without\r\nrecourse to war, the British chartered transport Kowshing was sunk with\r\n1200 men on board.\r\n\r\n3. The solution of the question which would have reconciled the views\r\nof the four Powers more immediately concerned was the neutralisation of\r\nKorea. Great Britain, Russia, and Japan were of one mind on this subject,\r\nand China would have hailed such an escape from her chronic embarrassment\r\nrespecting Korea. Why, then, was no attempt made to bring about such a\r\nsolution? Want of co-ordination, it would appear; diplomatic paralysis.\r\nThough the views of each Power separately ascertained were identical,\r\nnone of them would speak first, and there was no fifth party to assume the\r\ninitiative in bringing them to a common understanding. The blame of this\r\nmust be equally distributed, though in point of fact there were degrees\r\nof responsibility which it would be useless now to recall. It is only one\r\nexample the more of the great gap which often yawns between professional\r\ndiplomacy and practical politics.\r\n\r\nThe issue of the war was a foregone conclusion, both by sea and land.\r\nChina had no army, and the more numerous her levies the more helpless\r\nthey were before a disciplined enemy. The navy failed precisely where\r\nit was expected to fail. It was an incomplete machine, neglected and\r\nin disorder, deficient in many essential things. Worst of all, there\r\nwas no heart in it. Captain Lang, R.N., and other British officers had\r\nbeen expelled from the service through a conspiracy of the captains in\r\n1890, and thenceforth its deterioration became rapid. The efficiency of\r\nthe navy for its main purpose was the last thing considered by the cabal.\r\nThey relied absolutely on the diplomatic resources of Li Hung-chang to\r\nsave them from any possible trial of strength, and refused to face an\r\nalternative even by way of argument. Bravery was by no means lacking in\r\nthe ranks, nor professional education among the officers. There were some\r\nwho had Nelson's maxims at the tip of their tongue, and there were some\r\nwho added to a thorough naval training the spirit of devotion which makes\r\nheroes. But these qualities were isolated and incoherent; there was no\r\ntradition to render them fruitful, no martial spirit, no disgrace for\r\nthe coward, no honour for the valiant. The fleet was a body, defective\r\nenough at that, but without a soul. The minds of the captains being set\r\non quite other objects than the efficiency of their service, when the\r\ncrisis threatened they were intent only on evading collisions. The valour\r\nof the admiral, the fine sense of duty of individual officers, and the\r\nfighting qualities of a considerable body of the seamen, were swamped\r\nin the prevailing pusillanimity of the service; the choice spirits were\r\ndiscouraged by the fatuous neglect at headquarters to supply the ordinary\r\nnecessaries of warfare. It was the writer's fortune to make a passage in a\r\nChinese protected cruiser in September 1894, a few days before the great\r\nnaval action off the Yalu, and it was most pathetic to hear the defects\r\npointed out by the captain and first lieutenant--defects in ammunition\r\nfor the guns mounted, absence of gun crews, so that in action men would\r\nhave to be taken from one gun to another and put to work for which they\r\nhad no training, everywhere the ship spoiled for want of the ha'porth of\r\ntar. That particular vessel was not disgraced in the Yalu fight, but was\r\nbrought into Port Arthur by the superhuman exertions of her officers,\r\nher iron deck beams twisted by the fire and her plates red hot. A second\r\nconversation with the captain and first lieutenant after the action\r\nwas but a painful commentary on that of the week before. The one was\r\nprediction, the other fulfilment. Perhaps the state of the navy could not\r\nbe more forcibly illustrated than by the fact that the fleet was led into\r\naction at the Yalu by a German military officer.\r\n\r\nChina was indeed defeated, amid the applause of Europe and the whole\r\nworld, and the primeval law of violence received a new consecration. This\r\nis the one outcome of the war which seems likely to leave a permanent\r\nimpress on the surface of our civilisation, for the spontaneous outburst\r\nfrom the four corners of the earth cannot be referred to any venal or\r\nwire-pulling agency. There had been foreign wars in China before, wars\r\nentered upon after long discussion and accumulating causes of quarrel.\r\nTheir merits divided the opinion of the world--they divided even the\r\nnations that waged them; and the opposition was on one occasion strong\r\nenough to overturn a British Government that had actually entered into\r\nhostilities against China. But in 1894 there was not a dissentient\r\nvoice. The cause of the war was not known and not inquired into, the\r\nuniversal enthusiasm was simply for the victor, as such, without regard\r\nto anything but his military prowess. That was what the world fell down\r\nand worshipped. Not any righteous cause, or racial sympathy, or community\r\nof interest, inspired their acclamations; for none of these things were\r\nconsidered or understood by the masses who chorussed the triumph of the\r\nconqueror of China. English pens and tongues beyond all others urged\r\nthe victorious Power to make crushing conditions of peace, and in the\r\nclamour traditional landmarks were forgotten. The policy of saving China,\r\nthe great English milch cow, from destruction, which had been patiently\r\nfollowed by Great Britain for forty years, was thus suddenly submerged in\r\na wave of warlike enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nPress-made feeling was both stronger and had more influence on the action\r\nof Government in England than in any other country. The war had upset\r\nthe balance of power in Asia, but the press took no heed of that, and\r\nurged with conspicuous success that the Japanese should on no account\r\nbe hindered in their seizure of the spoils. Other countries, keeping a\r\ncooler outlook on eventualities, were unable to regard the occupation of\r\nLiao-tung by Japanese forces with the equanimity with which it was viewed\r\nin England, though they made no objection to the enormous indemnities\r\nforced from China, which might indeed be philosophically regarded by\r\nthem as a tax levied specially on British trade. Being threatened in her\r\nweakest frontier by this ambitious military Power, Russia had intimated\r\nbefore war began, in no ambiguous terms, that she could not tolerate\r\nsuch a neighbour, and on the conclusion of peace she took steps to give\r\neffect to that resolution. Russia had throughout the war been extremely\r\nnervous about the possible action of Great Britain, and would have gone\r\nconsiderable lengths to come to an understanding with her; but towards\r\nthe end, when the pretensions of the Japanese began to assume extravagant\r\ndimensions, their moral effect on the Great Powers enabled her to dispense\r\nwith English favour by drawing France and Germany to her support. The\r\ngravity of the Japanese demands was the factor that drew the three Powers\r\ntogether, and Li Hung-chang, when he went as envoy to Japan in March\r\n1895, assented to the indemnity and the surrender of territory on the\r\nassurance given him that the more excessive the conditions of peace he\r\nmight be forced to sign, the more certain were they to be revised by\r\nthe intervention of the Powers. The three Powers proved strong enough\r\nto induce Japan to give up Liao-tung for an increased indemnity, and\r\nthe future of the Far East thus was arranged in conferences from which\r\nGreat Britain had excluded herself. There were several reasons for\r\nthe abstention of the British Government from taking a share in this\r\nsettlement. One was the complete failure of their Intelligence Department\r\nbefore, during, and after the war. But the fervour of the nation in\r\ndeprecating interference with the Japanese was a sufficient, and no doubt\r\na welcome, warrant for the inaction of the Government. An experienced\r\nobserver of English public life remarked afterwards that he had never\r\nknown a situation in which the press, metropolitan and provincial, had\r\ndisplayed such entire unanimity and lavished such unmixed praise on the\r\nGovernment for its isolation. And yet it was a unanimity of nescience,\r\nof simple abdication, the surrender of a position in the Far East which\r\nhad been built up for two generations on the permanent interests of the\r\ncountry, and which, sacrificed at the critical moment, is gone beyond\r\nrecall. The \"new diplomacy,\" uninstructed popular impulse, never had\r\na freer field; for the Government which it dominated was scarcely more\r\nenlightened, and decidedly more apathetic, than the nation itself.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MINISTERS OF THE YAMÊN OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS.\r\n   H.E.

The crude ingredients of\r\nnational policy, stripped of the international decencies with which they\r\nwere wont to be invested, were then thrown into the caldron; elementary\r\nforces, naked and undisguised, confronted each other; and the scramble\r\nwhich moderate men had hoped to see indefinitely postponed was entered\r\ninto with the zest of a Cornish wrecking raid. The officious interference\r\nof quasi-friendly Powers to save the derelict empire from mutilation\r\nproved, according to unvarying experience, a remedy which was worse than\r\nthe disease. Russia, Germany, and France proceeded to treat China as a\r\nNo Man's Land; disintegration was the order of the day. The example was,\r\nof course, contagious. Other Powers, with no more substantial ground of\r\nclaim than was afforded by the defencelessness of China, began whetting\r\ntheir knives to carve the moribund carcass.\r\n\r\nA momentous transformation had been effected in a few months. China now\r\noccupied the paradoxical position of a protected State without protection;\r\nof a sovereign State shorn of the power of fulfilling her obligations.\r\nTo this impossible situation the Government itself had been an efficient\r\ncontributor. During the progress of the war China had, of her own motion,\r\nthrown herself on the mercy of the world. Before all the Powers, great\r\nand small, with whom she had intercourse, she humbled herself in the dust,\r\nimploring them collectively, separately, or anyhow, to save her from her\r\nrelentless foe. She, the titular mistress of the world, grovelled thus at\r\nthe feet of Powers to whom she would not, even then, in plain words, have\r\nconceded equality. And when assistance eventually came it was imposed on\r\nher by external force. She could make no conditions.\r\n\r\nThe revolution which the revised treaty of Shimonoseki effected in the\r\ninternational status of China was naturally first realised by those\r\nwho had brought it about. China ceased to be a free agent; she became a\r\nvassal, and not to one Power only. And the intervening Powers lost no time\r\nin demonstrating the fact, France taking the lead. Within two months of\r\nthe revision of the treaty of Shimonoseki the French Minister in Peking\r\ncompelled China to sign a treaty granting to France large territorial\r\nconcessions on which she had long had her eye, with commercial privileges\r\nnever before granted to any Power. But the stipulations of the French\r\nconvention were in open conflict with those of an existing treaty with\r\nthis country, inasmuch as they gave to France a portion of the Shan\r\nStates, which had been expressly reserved as a neutral zone in the treaty\r\nbetween China and Great Britain. The British Minister, pointing this out\r\nbefore the French treaty was concluded, protested against its signature.\r\nThe Ministers of the Yamên admitted the justice of his contention, nor\r\ncan it be said the protest was unheeded. With the Yamên it was a question\r\nsolely of the balance of power, and feeling that the French force was the\r\nheaviest in the scale, they yielded to that and signed the treaty with\r\nFrance in direct violation of that which they had previously signed with\r\nGreat Britain. As if to leave no ambiguity as to the true significance\r\nof the change of status which had come over China, the Russian Minister\r\non the day following made a formal visit to the Tsungli-Yamên, with more\r\nthan the customary display, to congratulate the Chinese Ministers on what\r\nthey had done, and to assure them of the approval of his Government.\r\n\r\nThis novel application of the law of force threw out of gear the whole\r\nsystem of Chinese national engagements, and was quite incompatible with\r\nnormal diplomatic relations. Formerly the struggle had lain between China\r\nand all the Powers, her obligations to whom were observed in proportion\r\nto the amount of coercion applied by, or to be apprehended from, each.\r\nFrom this resulted a chronic demand for the fulfilment of agreements, and\r\nconstant reclamations for non-fulfilment. But now the native reluctance\r\nto observe treaties was potentially reinforced by the action of foreign\r\nPowers in not only condoning, but explicitly insisting upon, China's\r\nviolating her engagements.\r\n\r\nIt may be that this species of _force majeure_ was not wholly unwelcome to\r\nthe Chinese. It certainly widened the field for their favourite tactics\r\nof playing off one foreign Power against another. A better answer than\r\nheretofore was now available to all demands and remonstrances. \"We should\r\nfor our part be most happy to do as you desire, but--what would Russia\r\nsay, what would France say?\" Thus diplomacy in China at once degenerated\r\ninto a \"tug of war\" contest, China herself being merely the rope which\r\nwas pulled. She was virtually ruled out of the active management of her\r\nown affairs and became the _corpus vile_ for rival aggressors.\r\n\r\nAggression sometimes assumed strange forms. One of the first which the\r\ntreaty of peace with Japan developed was a remarkable competition in\r\nlending money to the Chinese. The indemnities to be paid to Japan were\r\nheavy, and it was obvious that China must borrow. But before she had time\r\nto take any step in that direction money was being thrust upon her. First\r\nin the ranks were English loan-mongers, who had had some experience in\r\nthe business. Their negotiations were slow and halting; and when they\r\nhad at last concluded a contract it was only to be told that Russia\r\nobjected to the transaction, and required that China should borrow from\r\nFrench capitalists, who were willing to lend on the guarantee of Russia.\r\nThe Chinese Government were absolutely passive, not willingly, but of\r\nnecessity; they had not asked for the guarantee which Russia volunteered,\r\nand were quite willing to accept the loan of £16,000,000 sterling on\r\nthe English terms. But Russia simply insisted on their taking the French\r\nmoney, under an ominous threat, while she herself stood security for the\r\nsolvency of China, thereby assuming the position of first mortgagee on the\r\nrevenues of that empire. That accomplished, Russia stipulated that China\r\nshould contract no further loan for a period of six months.\r\n\r\nThe precedent set by Russia and France of ignoring the Government of China\r\nas an efficient factor in negotiations respecting her territory or her\r\nobligations was followed to the letter by Germany when in November 1897\r\nshe took possession of the most important naval harbour on the Chinese\r\ncoast, with an adequate hinterland, carrying elastic rights extending over\r\nan immense area of country. Admiral von Diedrichs reduced the question\r\nof the acquisition to its very simplest expression. \"Common-sense,\" he\r\nsubmitted to the Chinese commandant, \"must tell you on which side the\r\nsuperior force lies, and therefore you would be wise to make way for me\r\nwithout resistance.\" With the prize in her hands, Germany next demanded\r\na formal title to what she had seized, and instead of giving the German\r\nMinister his passports the Chinese Government granted the request.\r\n\r\nIn this unceremonious manner was the new status of China embodied in\r\nmonumental facts. She was the common victim, having no power to bind or\r\nloose save in accordance with the dictates of her masters. The Chinese\r\nGovernment seemed to have abdicated sovereign functions.\r\n\r\nAfter France and Germany it was Russia's turn to give tangible evidence of\r\nthe real ascendancy she had gained over the Chinese Imperial Government.\r\nHers was the only true mastery. The others might wrest provinces and\r\nextort concessions from a prostrate Government, but Russia alone reached\r\nthe cerebral centre and controlled--so far as outward effect went--the\r\nvolition of the organism. Negotiations, partly revealed in 1895, showed\r\nconclusively the scope and direction of her Chinese policy. It was\r\nprofound and practical, continuing on the lines that had proved so\r\nsuccessful in the past. The basis of it was an ostensible friendship for\r\nChina, out of which grew a protective alliance, and the peculiar kind of\r\npartnership which had constituted the intermediate stage in the previous\r\ngreat territorial acquisitions of Russia. The joint right of the two\r\nPowers--to the exclusion of all others--to navigate the Amur and the\r\nSongari, and the joint possession of the Usuri territory--\"details to be\r\nhereafter settled\"--was now to be applied to the coast and harbours of\r\nLiao-tung, of which Russia was to have the use, afterwards defined in a\r\ntreaty as the \"usufruct.\" The gentlest methods were to be used, and so far\r\nas mere phrases were concerned, a matter on which the Chinese always were\r\npunctilious, the utmost consideration for their feelings was to be shown.\r\nRussia had two immediate objects in view, both of cardinal importance\r\nto her. The first was to obtain a terminus for the Great Siberian\r\nRailway more southerly than Vladivostock, which could only be obtained\r\nin Korean or Chinese territory. The second--the necessary corollary of\r\nthe first--was to bring the territory through which the railway should\r\nrun within the Russian administration. The sanction of China to a branch\r\nof the Siberian Railway being carried through Manchuria to a terminus\r\non the Liao-tung littoral was formally given in conferences between\r\nLi Hung-chang and the Czar on the occasion of the coronation at Moscow\r\nin 1896. The details were afterwards developed in a way of which it is\r\nprobable the Chinese Government had little foresight; but it would have\r\nmade no difference, for to Russia nothing could be denied.\r\n\r\nOut of these comprehensive projects of Russia--projects which belonged\r\nto the very highest order of imperial statecraft--arose a strange unequal\r\nduel between Russian and British diplomacy, which has also left its mark\r\non history. Her Majesty's Government and their agents abroad having been\r\nfound wanting in the matter of information during the upheaval of the Far\r\nEast, it appeared to be their _rôle_ to ignore and deny the facts upon\r\nwhich other Powers were acting. In particular the whole Russian scheme\r\nof utilising Chinese territory and controlling the Chinese Government was\r\ndiscredited with considerable vehemence. The consequence of this attitude\r\nof scepticism was that whatever Great Britain might resolve to do must be\r\ndone in the dark. Assured by their agents in the Far East that the bay\r\nof Kiaochow was worthless, the British Government satisfied themselves\r\nthat Germany had made a poor bargain in taking it. Dismissing as a\r\nphantasy the whole string of facts concerning Russia's plans, the British\r\nGovernment exposed themselves to collision with those plans, and received\r\nin consequence a series of diplomatic humiliations, entailing upon the\r\ncountry permanent disadvantages of a most substantial kind. Towards the\r\nend of 1898, soon after the German seizure of Kiaochow, a harbour which\r\nhad also proved a convenient winter rendezvous for the Russian fleet, the\r\nannouncement came from China that the latter had received permission from\r\nthe Chinese Government to winter at Port Arthur on the opposite coast\r\nof Liao-tung. Thereupon a discussion was raised between London and St\r\nPetersburg concerning the prospective designs of Russia. This discussion\r\nwas stamped from its origin with futility by previous communications with\r\nthe Russian Government, the purport of which was inferred from a speech by\r\nMr Balfour in February 1896. On that occasion he declared that the British\r\nGovernment would not only not oppose, but would hail with satisfaction,\r\nthe acquisition by Russia of an ice-free port in the Pacific. As her\r\nMajesty's Government held Russia to the pledge she gave in 1886 to\r\nrespect the integrity of the Korean coast, it followed that the ice-free\r\nharbour contemplated by Mr Balfour could only be in Chinese territory,\r\nwhich, as affecting the dominating power of Russia in the Far East, was\r\ngreatly in advance of what the occupation of a Korean harbour would have\r\nbeen. Korea had been safe-guarded from encroachment because it was the\r\nstepping-stone to China, but the Russian lodgment on the inner waters of\r\nChina itself deprived Korea of most of its strategical value. Hence Russia\r\nkept silence when Mr Curzon stated in Parliament that the pledge held\r\ngood which preserved the integrity of Korea, a pledge which had lost its\r\nsignificance. This acquiescence in Russia's taking an ice-free port on the\r\nChinese coast was in direct contradiction to other no less authoritative\r\nstatements of the British Government. As, for instance, the resolution\r\npassed by the House of Commons, and accepted by the Government, pledging\r\nthem to maintain the integrity of China, followed by the statement by\r\nthe Under Secretary of State that the Liao-tung coast with its harbours\r\nconstituted an integral part of the Chinese dominions. It is obvious that\r\nthis confusion arose either from lack of information or lack of interest\r\nin the subject, coupled in either case with absent-mindedness on the part\r\nof the British Government. But these inconsistencies of the members of\r\nthe British Government made no difference to the steady prosecution of\r\nthe Russian plans, which were now developed with great rapidity. These\r\npretensions were signalised by two memorable incidents, following each\r\nother so closely as to be practically simultaneous, in January 1898.\r\nThe first was a new loan to the Chinese under negotiation by British\r\nfinanciers, to assist which her Majesty's Government was strongly urged\r\nby the China merchants to give its guarantee to the lenders as Russia\r\nhad done in the case of the previous loan. On being asked by the Foreign\r\nOffice what securities it would be proper to demand from the Chinese\r\nGovernment as the equivalent of such British guarantee, the British\r\nMinister at Peking replied that one of the conditions should be the\r\nopening of Talien-wan as a treaty port by the Chinese Government. Whether\r\nhe had considered in what way this concession was to benefit the position\r\nof Great Britain was not disclosed. The proposal was promptly vetoed by\r\nthe Russian Government, whose ambassador in London urged strongly that\r\n\"if we insisted on making Talien-wan an open port we should be encroaching\r\non the Russian sphere of influence, and denying her in future that right\r\nto the use of Port Arthur to which the progress of events had given her a\r\nclaim,\"--adding, that without having any designs on the territory, \"it was\r\ngenerally admitted that Russia might claim a commercial _débouché_ upon\r\nthe open sea, and that in order to enjoy that advantage fully she ought\r\nto be at liberty to make such arrangements with China as she could obtain\r\nwith respect to the commercial _régime_ which was to prevail there.\"\r\n\r\nThe second incident was that two British war-vessels which were anchored\r\nin Port Arthur--where, of course, they had the same right to be as\r\nany other foreign man-of-war--\"made a bad impression\" on the Russian\r\nGovernment, and formed the subject of complaint to the British Secretary\r\nof State. While denying the right of Russia to comment on the movements\r\nof British ships in Chinese waters, Lord Salisbury nevertheless allowed\r\nthe vessels in question to depart, a movement which was reported with much\r\ncolour of truth in Peking and St Petersburg as having been made by the\r\norder of Russia.\r\n\r\nThus within one month the exposition of the Russian designs was expanded\r\nfrom the first assurance of Count Muravieff that the wintering of the\r\nships was merely for the temporary convenience of the fleet, to the\r\nassertion of vague territorial rights over the coast and harbours of\r\nLiao-tung. And Lord Salisbury observed with plaintive naïveté in the month\r\nof March, that whereas his Government \"had always looked with favour upon\r\nthe idea of Russia obtaining an ice-free port on the Pacific, Russia had\r\nnow given a most unfortunate extension to this policy.\" It appears that\r\nthe eyes of the British Government were not opened to the gravity of the\r\nsituation until Russia, alleging that an ice-free port on the Chinese\r\ncoast (no longer the Pacific) was a vital necessity to her, thereupon\r\ntook possession of Port Arthur and Talien-wan. The British Government\r\nat the eleventh hour opposed the proceeding, for the reason that \"the\r\ninfluence of Russia over the Government of Peking will be so increased to\r\nthe detriment of that of her Majesty's Government, if the Russians are to\r\nhave a lease of Port Arthur and Talien-wan, that it seems desirable for\r\nus to make some counter-move.\" Thus the British Government were brought\r\nto see, when too late, what those interested in Far Eastern affairs had\r\nbeen endeavouring to tell them years before; and there seems to be no\r\ndoubt that the final discovery of the truth was due to the efforts of one\r\nor two persistent writers in the press during January and February 1898,\r\nbut chiefly to the action of a small independent section of the British\r\nHouse of Commons led by Mr Yerburgh. On such trifling accidents do great\r\nevents sometimes hang, that it seems probable that had Mr Yerburgh's\r\nmovement taken effect three months earlier British ships would not have\r\nbeen withdrawn from Port Arthur, neither would China have been ousted from\r\nthe possession of her only two naval harbours north of the Yangtze--at\r\nleast not just then. It would serve no good purpose to follow the various\r\nexplanations given by Ministers of the British Crown of their diplomatic\r\nencounters with Russia. They will have little interest for the historian.\r\nBut a clear account of these transactions given in a letter to the\r\n'Times,' May 19, 1898, may very well serve as a guide to future inquirers\r\ninto these matters:--\r\n\r\n                        _The Legend of Talien-wan._\r\n\r\n    Before the recent diplomatic struggle in the Far East is allowed\r\n    to pass away from the public mind, may I be permitted to say a\r\n    few words on one of its aspects which seems to have received very\r\n    little attention?\r\n\r\n    The bad faith of the Russian Government has been strongly, and\r\n    not unreasonably, condemned; but no attempt has been made to\r\n    explain it, except on the popular hypothesis that a double dose of\r\n    original sin is normal in the Muscovite. It does not seem to have\r\n    occurred to any writer on the subject that the Russians themselves\r\n    may have a grievance, that they may have acted under a sense of\r\n    injury, or that, in their view, the good faith of the British\r\n    Government is not above reproach. I believe they are mistaken;\r\n    but it is none the less true that the chain of facts on which they\r\n    rely will well bear the interpretation they place upon it.\r\n\r\n    The great blot on the recently published \"Correspondence\r\n    respecting the affairs of China\" (No. 1, 1898) is that it takes\r\n    no account of its immediate _Vorgeschichte_. It relates to a\r\n    diplomatic struggle of which we last heard officially as far\r\n    back as 1887, when the Blue-book on Port Hamilton was published.\r\n    Since then many important things have happened, notably the\r\n    Chino-Japanese war and the intervention of Russia, France, and\r\n    Germany in the settlement of Shimonoseki. To ignore these events\r\n    is really to delude the public; for the chapter of Far Eastern\r\n    politics which begins with the German descent on Kiaochow is\r\n    little short of meaningless if the story of Shimonoseki is\r\n    passed over. Indeed the legend of Talien-wan itself belongs to\r\n    a policy which may easily be traced back half a century. It is,\r\n    however, not necessary for my purpose that I should go behind the\r\n    Shimonoseki intervention. What was the object of that transaction?\r\n    No one who has given any attention to Far Eastern affairs has\r\n    ever been under the slightest illusion on this point. The great\r\n    problem of Russian statesmanship since the foundation of the\r\n    empire has been to reach the open sea, first in the Baltic, then\r\n    in the Euxine and the Mediterranean, and, after the Crimean war,\r\n    in the Pacific. Since Muravieff and Nevelskoy opened the Amur\r\n    Russia has neglected no opportunity of pushing southward in order\r\n    to get beyond the line of winter ice, and every embarrassment\r\n    of China has been skilfully used by her to bring her nearer her\r\n    goal. We in England have consistently resisted this policy, and\r\n    in 1886 we thought to have finally defeated it when, by seizing\r\n    Port Hamilton, we extracted a pledge from Russia that she would\r\n    not occupy Korean territory \"under any circumstances whatever.\"\r\n    To all outward seeming Russian expansion in the Far East was thus\r\n    stopped in the ice-bound harbour of Vladivostock. This, however,\r\n    was not the view of Russia herself. She was still confident that\r\n    an opportunity would be afforded her of realising her ambition,\r\n    for there were other harbours on the Pacific besides those of\r\n    Korea, and if the road to them was longer and more difficult,\r\n    Russian patience was equal to the task of covering it. In these\r\n    circumstances Japan, victorious in her war with China, claimed\r\n    and obtained the cession of the Liao-tung peninsula, and thus\r\n    threatened to shut the door for ever against Russian access to the\r\n    Pacific. The intervention of the Powers which Russia thereupon\r\n    organised was ostensibly directed to the protection of the\r\n    integrity and independence of China, but no intelligent politician\r\n    doubted at the time, or has doubted since, that its real aim was\r\n    to keep the Pacific door open for Russia.\r\n\r\n    Shortly after this event Lord Salisbury came into office. The\r\n    problem which then most urgently demanded his attention was that\r\n    of Armenia. Largely by its attitude in the Far East the Rosebery\r\n    Cabinet had left our relations with Russia in a distinctly\r\n    strained condition, and the one obvious remedy of the Armenian\r\n    horrors--the coercion of the Sultan--was blocked by Russia. Lord\r\n    Salisbury directed himself to the conciliation of Russia, wisely\r\n    recognising that nothing could be done in the Near East without\r\n    Russian goodwill and assistance. What were the means he employed?\r\n    I cannot say what private negotiations may have taken place\r\n    between the two Governments, but we seem to have a sufficiently\r\n    significant illustration of the direction in which the Premier\r\n    was disposed to make concessions to Russia in a speech delivered\r\n    by Mr Balfour at Bristol on February 3, 1896. In that speech a\r\n    British Minister announced for the first time that this country\r\n    would not oppose Russian expansion to the Pacific. \"I, for my\r\n    part, frankly state,\" he said, \"that, so far from regarding with\r\n    fear and jealousy a commercial outlet for Russia in the Pacific\r\n    Ocean which would not be ice-bound half the year, I should welcome\r\n    such a result as a distinct advance in this far-distant region.\"\r\n    This statement made a profound impression all over the world, as\r\n    well it might, seeing that it implied the abandonment of a policy\r\n    which had been consistently and vigilantly adhered to by Great\r\n    Britain from the time of Lord Clarendon to that of Lord Rosebery.\r\n\r\n    A few days after Mr Balfour's Bristol speech--on February 20--it\r\n    fell to Mr Curzon to explain in a negative way the scope of his\r\n    leader's pronouncement. An impression had got abroad that the new\r\n    policy implied the surrender of the pledge given by Russia in 1886\r\n    with regard to the occupation of Korean territory, and the Under\r\n    Secretary was asked in the House of Commons for his views on the\r\n    subject. Mr Curzon replied that \"her Majesty's Government consider\r\n    that the pledge given by the Russian Government is still binding.\"\r\n    Was this a disavowal of the new Russophile policy. Obviously not:\r\n    for later in the year, at the Guildhall banquet, Lord Salisbury\r\n    made to Russia the friendliest overtures he has ever made in\r\n    public speech. At the same time he especially accentuated the\r\n    novelty of his attitude by asserting that \"it is a superstition\r\n    of an antiquated diplomacy that there is any necessary antagonism\r\n    between Russia and Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\n    The position, then, of the Government was apparently this: they\r\n    had abandoned the traditional hostility of this country to Russian\r\n    expansion towards the ice-free Pacific on condition that it did\r\n    not trench on Korean territory. It followed, then, that they\r\n    were not disposed to offer any hindrance to the acquisition by\r\n    Russia of a port on Chinese territory, westward of the Korean\r\n    frontier--that is, somewhere between the mouth of the Yalu and\r\n    Port Arthur. This must be clear to anybody who cares to glance at\r\n    a map. The upshot of the speeches of Mr Balfour and Lord Salisbury\r\n    and of the statement of Mr Curzon was, in short, to invite Russia,\r\n    whenever she might feel so disposed, to plant the Russian flag\r\n    on the southern coast of Manchuria. This, at any rate, was the\r\n    view taken in Russia, and, for my part, I can see no escape from\r\n    it. It is not a little significant of the satisfaction caused in\r\n    Russia by this interpretation of the policy of Great Britain that,\r\n    on November 25, a fortnight after Lord Salisbury's speech, the\r\n    Tsar at last consented in principle to the British proposals for\r\n    coercing the Sultan of Turkey on the Armenian question.\r\n\r\n    Now we come to the events of last November, when Germany suddenly\r\n    swooped down on Kiaochow. This step is known to have been very\r\n    distasteful to the Russian Government. It was the first appearance\r\n    of a European Power in the northern waters of China, in a region\r\n    which Russia had persuaded herself was reserved for her own\r\n    domination. Long before the murder of the unfortunate German\r\n    missionaries in Shantung it was well known in St Petersburg that\r\n    Germany had her eyes on Kiaochow, and the Russian Minister at\r\n    Peking had more than once warned Li Hung-chang and urged him to\r\n    fortify the bay. The disappointment of Russia became intensified\r\n    when it was observed that the step taken by Germany, was not\r\n    resented in this country, and fears of an Anglo-German alliance\r\n    in the Far East began to possess the Russian mind. Then suddenly\r\n    there came the Talien-wan incident, and Russia found herself once\r\n    more confronted by the danger which had threatened her in the\r\n    treaty of Shimonoseki.\r\n\r\n    The real significance of the Talien-wan incident has never yet\r\n    been fully set forth. Had Talien-wan been made a treaty port, and\r\n    thus given more or less of an international status, Russia would\r\n    have been practically shut out for ever from the ice-free ocean.\r\n    The only stretch of coast on which she could obtain this outlet\r\n    was, as I have already shown, the southern coast of Manchuria\r\n    from the Korean frontier on the Yalu to Port Arthur. Now, if we\r\n    examine this coast-line carefully we shall find that there is only\r\n    one spot capable of being transformed into a commercial port, and\r\n    that is Talien-wan. The China Sea Directory (vol. iii.), published\r\n    by the Hydrographic Department of the Admiralty, gives us the\r\n    fullest particulars on this subject. It traces the coast-line in\r\n    microscopic detail and shows us that it has only five possible\r\n    harbours. The first, westward from the Yalu, is Taku-shan, the\r\n    approach to which is frozen during the winter months. The second\r\n    is Pi-tse-wo,--here the water is too shallow even for large junks.\r\n    The third is Yen-tao Bay, the anchorage of which is bad, and in\r\n    places dangerous. The fourth is Talien-wan, and the fifth Port\r\n    Arthur. Talien-wan has all the advantages which are absent from\r\n    the other ports. It is ice-free, spacious, well sheltered, with\r\n    excellent anchorage and considerable commercial possibilities. Is\r\n    it surprising that Russia should have felt aggrieved when it was\r\n    proposed to make Talien-wan a treaty port?\r\n\r\n    As a matter of fact, I believe Russia regarded this proposal\r\n    as an attempt to evade the assurance given by Mr Balfour in his\r\n    Bristol speech. She looked upon it as the design of a powerful\r\n    Anglo-German combination to exclude her for ever from the China\r\n    seas. It was to her mind a conspiracy of the most dangerous\r\n    kind, and she bent all her efforts to defeat it. When she had\r\n    defeated it she lost no time in securing her position. She took\r\n    Port Arthur as well as Talien-wan, for the simple reason that her\r\n    interpretation of the situation convinced her that a commercial\r\n    port overlooked by a great citadel in foreign hands would be a\r\n    vantage to her foes rather than a prize to herself. Can she be\r\n    altogether blamed for taking this view?\r\n\r\n    The mistake the Russian Government made was in attaching a\r\n    serious meaning to the casual blunders of our Government, and in\r\n    imagining that these blunders marked a connected purpose, if not\r\n    a consistent policy. They were not to know that the Russophile\r\n    passage in Mr Balfour's Bristol speech was a mere oratorical tag;\r\n    that our friendly attitude towards Germany at Kiaochow was only\r\n    a sort of amiable tolerance of an act the scope and consequence\r\n    of which we had not measured; and that our proposal to open\r\n    Talien-wan was made at the suggestion of our Minister at Peking,\r\n    who, of course, knew what he was about, while it was acquiesced in\r\n    at home by Ministers who simply did not know what they were doing.\r\n    That Sir Claude Macdonald designed the Talien-wan move as a check\r\n    to Russia I have no doubt; that Lord Salisbury never dreamed of\r\n    this aspect of it I am equally convinced.\r\n\r\n    However that may be, one thing, I think, is clear. The sense of\r\n    injury and the complaints of bad faith are not all on one side. In\r\n    diplomacy, as in most of the affairs in this world, it is a wise\r\n    rule not to believe your opponent to be as stupid as he looks.\r\n    Russia at any rate paid us this compliment during the recent\r\n    negotiations. The result, no doubt, is that she has overreached\r\n    us. But whose fault is it?\r\n\r\nThe Russian flag once hoisted over Port Arthur and Talien-wan (by what\r\nnominal authority makes no difference whatever to the fact) placed the new\r\nrelation of China to the rest of the world beyond all discussion. China\r\ndid not willingly surrender her territory: she looked in vain for help,\r\nbut found none. She weighed in the balance the words and acts of one great\r\nPower against the words and acts of another, and had no choice but to\r\nplace herself under authority of the strongest, finally and irrevocably.\r\nThat fact must be taken as the master-key to her subsequent policy in all\r\nits phases.\r\n\r\nThese several events succeeding each other in close order awoke the\r\nBritish public from their optimistic dream, and forced them to reflect\r\nthat there was after all something more in these Far Eastern readjustments\r\nthan had occurred to them when cheering on gallant little Japan to\r\nthe spoliation of China. The result obtained was certainly not that\r\nwhich was contemplated either by the nation or the Government when\r\nGreat Britain settled down into her isolation. When the truth of the\r\nsituation had revealed itself to the public there was naturally a loud\r\ncall for something to be done to safeguard the commercial interests of\r\nthe country, if not to recover lost prestige; but the Government were as\r\nfar from having definite aims in China as they had ever been, and while\r\ngoading them to action, the public was scarcely in a position to advise\r\nwhat that action should be. Neither had the Government, in spite of\r\nall that had taken place, fully realised to what extent China had added\r\nimpotence to reluctance, for they continued to deal with China very much\r\nas if the events of 1895 to 1898 had never happened. They were reluctant\r\nto recognise the fact that Russia, in possession of the Liao-tung or\r\nKwan-tung peninsula and of the railway line connecting it with Siberia,\r\nheld a noose round the neck of the Peking Government, which she could\r\ntighten or relax, conceal or parade, as circumstances required, and\r\nthat until some other Power or Powers were prepared to speak with equal\r\nauthority Russia must be paramount, not by virtue of any convention, but\r\nas the outcome of accomplished facts.\r\n\r\nTwo measures adopted by Great Britain to rectify the preponderance of\r\nRussia were the seizure, under a form of negotiation, of the harbour of\r\nWeihai-wei and the forcing of money upon the Chinese by way of loan. The\r\nvalue of these strokes of policy has not yet become apparent.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE OUTCOME.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE SITUATION IN PEKING.\r\n\r\n    A magnified repetition of experiences in Canton--Chinese\r\n    unchanged--International usages inapplicable.\r\n\r\nSince the foregoing chapters were put into the printer's hands the Far\r\nEastern Question has reached a crisis in which its ruling factors have\r\nbeen suddenly exposed in their nakedness. But the searchlight now thrown\r\nupon them casts a blacker shadow on the unilluminated portions of the\r\nfield. The events of 1900, while revealing the landmarks of past foreign\r\nrelations with China, have deepened the obscurity of all that concerns\r\nthe future of the Chinese State itself, as well as of the position of the\r\nforeign Powers in relation to it and to one another. International comity\r\nis seen to have made no progress in sixty years; on the contrary, the\r\ngulf that divides China from the world yawns wider than ever, of which a\r\nstriking example is afforded by the telegrams lately exchanged between\r\nthe Chinese and the German Emperors. They speak in tongues unknown to\r\none another and are mutually unintelligible, so that they have no common\r\nground but that of brute force. Intercourse imposed on them against their\r\nwill and conscience has resulted, naturally enough, in exhibiting the\r\nChinese as the enemies of the human family.\r\n\r\nThe capture of the Taku forts and the occupation of Peking by foreign\r\ntroops were but a repetition of similar incidents forty years before; and\r\nit is instructive to observe how closely the lines of the old precedents\r\nhave been followed. Prisoners taken treacherously, or envoys held as\r\nhostages; the threat to kill them if foreign troops menaced the capital;\r\nthe devices to arrest the advance of the Allied forces; the proposal to\r\nnegotiate only when the Chinese case became desperate; the ineradicable\r\nbelief in the credulity of foreigners; and the flight of the Court when\r\nall other expedients failed,--were but another rehearsal, with variations,\r\nof previous performances at Canton, Nanking, and Peking. The parallel is\r\ncompleted by the efforts of foreign Powers to coax the emperor back to his\r\ncapital. Nothing has been changed, only the scale has been magnified, and\r\nthe civilised world, instead of one or two Powers, has become directly\r\ninterested in the catastrophe. Official intercourse with China has\r\nthus continued on the lines on which it began. The first British envoy\r\nwas treated as a malefactor, imprisoned, his letters were intercepted,\r\nhis communications cut off, his servants withdrawn; he was guarded and\r\nthreatened by armed men posted at his door, and reduced to dangerous\r\nsubterfuges in order to get a message conveyed to his countrymen outside.\r\nCanton in 1834 was simply Peking in 1900, in embryo. A naval force was\r\nrequired to relieve Lord Napier from his perilous situation then,[33] as a\r\ncombined naval and military force has been required to relieve the foreign\r\nMinisters in Peking now. The cycle has been completed. Every link in the\r\nchain connecting the opening with the closing incidents of diplomatic\r\nintercourse has been, on one side at least, homogeneous. Whatever and\r\nwhoever may have altered, the Chinese certainly have not. Commissioner\r\nLin, Viceroy Yeh, Prince Tuan, the empress-dowager, and all wielding\r\nauthority, whether in name or not, have been true to the Chinese ideal.\r\nThey have all alike been blind to the consequences of their acts, which\r\nhave throughout been characterised by the strategy of fools--momentary\r\nsuccess followed by overwhelming reverses, resulting at each succeeding\r\nencounter in a further invasion of the frontiers of their political\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nThe crisis has been sufficiently prolonged to enable the world to perceive\r\nwhat the Chinese mean by the term negotiation. To them it signifies what\r\nit has always done, a palaver to gain time, to hoodwink an opponent,\r\nto escape from a threatened danger, to purchase immunity by promises; a\r\ndevice to manage, or, as they themselves express it, \"to soothe and bridle\r\nbarbarians.\" As little now as at any former period can they conceive the\r\nidea of a fair bargain between equals. They but temporise as with a savage\r\nor a dangerous beast. \"Get rid of the barbarians\" is their unvarying\r\n_mot d'ordre_, and it matters but little to them what instruments are\r\nemployed in carrying it out. The office is one from which every statesman\r\ninstinctively shrinks, since if he fails in taming the barbarians his\r\ncase is referred to the Board of Punishments, and if he succeeds he incurs\r\nthe contempt of all classes for the concessions by which he has purchased\r\npeace. It is hardly possible for him in any case to escape degradation.\r\nBe it therefore Lin, Kishen, Kiying, Yeh, Kweiliang, Wênsiang, Chunghou,\r\nLi Hung-chang, or any one else, Chinese negotiators, whatever their\r\napparent success in averting a danger, are morally certain to come to a\r\nbad end; and for the reason which caused the failure of Lord Napier in\r\n1834, the impossibility of reconciling two principles which are wholly\r\nincompatible. As negotiation under such conditions can only be nugatory,\r\na lengthened experience has made it clear that neither the negotiator\r\nnor the negotiation avails anything, but solely the manner in which the\r\nChinese are held to their engagements, even when imposed on them by force,\r\nand the strictness with which the common duties of civilised nations are\r\nexacted from them, with or without written agreements.\r\n\r\nOne feature in the recent Peking episode distinguishes it from previous\r\nexperiences. A Government communicating with foreign Powers through its\r\nown envoys, doling out through them garbled information, while isolating\r\nthe envoys of those same Powers within its capital, and planning, and\r\nif not doing its best to effect, their extermination, at least openly\r\napproving the attempt, is surely unexampled in human history. The\r\nproposal of such a Government, on the failure of its plans to \"negotiate\r\nfor peace,\" would be the most sardonic of practical jokes if we could\r\ndisconnect it from the evidence implied in the proposal of the estimate\r\nof foreign nations which is ingrained in the Chinese moral constitution.\r\nObviously, however, such a Government has placed itself beyond the pale\r\nof international relations, and it is hardly possible to conceive any\r\nrestoration of the old or evolution of a new _régime_ which can place\r\nChina in the rank of civilised Powers.\r\n\r\nWe are, in fact, thrust back on the conclusion arrived at by Lord Napier\r\nin 1834: \"That Government is not in a position to be dealt with or treated\r\nby civilised nations according to the same rules as are acknowledged and\r\npractised among themselves.\" Yet, instead of being treated with less, the\r\nChinese Government has received greater consideration than is accorded by\r\none Western State to another. Prerogatives implying superiority have been\r\nconceded to it by consent of all the foreign Powers--a false principle\r\nwhich has now produced its natural result.\r\n\r\nThe usages of Western Courts, therefore, being wholly inapplicable in\r\nChina, no matter what Government may rule there, international relations\r\nof the European type must be, as they have hitherto been, an illusory\r\nideal, and some new form of intercourse, corresponding more closely to\r\nthe realities of the case, must take the place of that which has proved so\r\ntotally unworkable. Should foreign nations, by reason of differences among\r\nthemselves or the magnitude of the problem, hesitate to act up to this\r\nview of the situation, the continuance of a status which is essentially\r\nfalse to the facts must lead to some still more tragic catastrophe than\r\nany that has yet taken place.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE CHRONIC CAUSE.\r\n\r\n    Hostility of Government and people--Fostered by immunity--Cause of\r\n    animosity as set forth by Chinese--Incitements to outrage--Chinese\r\n    press calumnies--Compared with European--Effect on the Chinese of\r\n    international vituperation.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the attitude of the Chinese has been quite\r\nconsistent: from first to last they have resisted the foreign impact\r\n_per fas et nefas_, using such weapons as they could command, while\r\navoiding, according to their lights, the risk of reprisals. Their lights\r\nhave indeed deceived them, their resistance has failed, and their methods\r\nstand condemned. But it is beside the question to inveigh against their\r\nbarbarity, for \"what is bred in the bone comes out in the flesh,\" and in\r\nhuman relations there are permanent facts which have to be accepted, like\r\nthe skin of the Ethiopian and the spots of the leopard. Since foreigners\r\nhave, for their own purposes, broken into a hornet's nest, it is idle for\r\nthem to prescribe the manner of retaliation unless they are prepared to go\r\nthrough with their aggression and to enforce obedience to their own canon.\r\n\r\nThe constant feature in all Chinese attacks on foreigners has been the\r\nimmunity from punishment of the real instigators. Massacres of foreigners\r\nhave been condoned, for the blood-money exacted for them was no punishment\r\nto criminals who did not contribute to the payment. All attempts on the\r\npart of foreign agents to make guilty officials responsible for their\r\noutrages have been frustrated by the Government, who have invariably held\r\nthe persons of officials exempt from punishment at the instance of, or\r\nfor injuries done to, foreigners. In Chinese eyes injury to foreigners\r\nis meritorious in the abstract, and to be rewarded rather than punished.\r\nForeign Powers have in practice acquiesced in this fatal principle, for\r\nthough on rare occasions they have successfully insisted on the removal\r\nof some obnoxious official, the Government have taken care to nullify\r\nthe penalty by promoting him to a better post. The various attempts that\r\nhave been made by foreign representatives to collect evidence to support\r\na legal charge against the instigators of outrages have been baffled by\r\nthe inflexible determination of the Government to shield the official as\r\nwell as the non-official leaders of riots. The foreign method of seeking\r\nredress, being thus foredoomed to failure, is obviously not suited to the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nBut while foreigners were pursuing their object by a hopeless path, the\r\nChinese administration itself provided the simpler and more efficacious\r\nremedy of holding the chief authority of every province responsible for\r\nmisgovernment, as well as for crimes and misdemeanours committed within\r\nhis district. In the words of Sir Rutherford Alcock, \"Each province\r\nconstitutes a separate state in its administration; to compensate\r\nfor this the emperor can appoint and remove every official, from the\r\nGovernor-General downwards, at his pleasure. And they are each and all\r\nindividually and collectively held responsible for all that may happen\r\nin the limits of their jurisdiction.\" By the custom of the country,\r\ntherefore, the guilt of the highest official is assumed whenever any\r\ndisturbance of the peace takes place or crime is committed within his\r\ngovernment. He may transfer it, if he can, and ferret out evidence in\r\nhis own exculpation; but errors of judgment, pleas of good intentions,\r\nand palliatives of that kind are not admitted, and not offered. Why\r\nforeigners have never appealed to this fundamental principle of Chinese\r\nadministration, and have preferred relying on their own crude procedure\r\nand strange methods of collecting evidence while practically acquiescing\r\nin the immunity of Chinese officials, has never been satisfactorily\r\nexplained. For it is only in matters concerning foreigners that the\r\npersons of Chinese officials are held sacred. The Government have\r\nno scruples with regard even to the highest in rank when they make\r\nthemselves obnoxious to the powers that be. Degradation, deprivation,\r\nchains, imprisonment, and the headsman's broadsword, are ever ready to\r\nvindicate the majesty of the law when the Court awards the penalty. But\r\nforeigners are treated as outside the law, which is the gravamen of the\r\nChinese offence against them. The constitution of the country afforded\r\nthem a clear ground for demanding that the traditional principle of\r\nresponsibility should be put in force for their protection. It was, in\r\nfact, applied spontaneously by Li Hung-chang in the province of which\r\nhe was viceroy, with the result that Chihli was exempt from outrages\r\non foreigners for nearly a quarter of a century. Why was the system\r\nnot extended to all the provinces of the empire? Had not the foreign\r\nrepresentatives the natural right of demanding the benefit of Chinese\r\ninstitutions, or did they consider their exotic substitute as preferable?\r\n\r\nA wrong road can never lead to a right destination; sins of omission\r\nand commission have alike to be atoned for, and the cost accumulates\r\nat compound interest. The result of sparing prefects and governors the\r\nconsequences of the evil deeds permitted within their jurisdiction is that\r\nthe Western Powers are now confronted with the more serious dilemma of\r\nsparing the throne itself and tolerating the continuance of anti-foreign\r\noutrages, or of doing stern justice towards the guilty even though the\r\nheavens should fall. A retrospective glance over the history of sixty\r\nyears might help towards a solution even of this momentous problem. Have\r\nthe sacrifices of principle that have hitherto been made in order to save\r\nthe empire, or the dynasty, been efficacious to these ends? The answer of\r\nhistory is No; on the contrary, they have accelerated the ruin of both.\r\n\r\nThe provoking cause of recent outbreaks against foreigners in all\r\nparts of the Chinese empire may be gathered from the proceedings of\r\nthe conspirators, from their placards and lampoons, and from their\r\nsecret correspondence. The keynote of all these is general detestation\r\nof foreigners, special enmity to Christianity and its accessories, and\r\naversion to the symbols of material progress. Hatred of foreigners now\r\nshows itself as a passion which binds the provinces together as nothing\r\nelse has ever been known to do. Their expulsion is a cause which is\r\nheld to justify the vilest deeds done in its name. Nor is the present\r\nstate of things a growth of yesterday. The ferment has been working for\r\nforty years--to go no further back--with many sporadic outbreaks to\r\nmark its progress. It was not nipped in the bud, as it might perhaps\r\nhave been. Exhibitions of ill-feeling had been habitually disregarded\r\nby foreigners, who in their readiness to blame each other for provoking\r\nthem, were accustomed to repel obvious explanations, and to go far afield\r\nfor theories which would exonerate themselves at the expense of their\r\nneighbours. If stones were thrown or abusive epithets shouted, \"It was\r\nonly the children.\" Only the children! As if more conclusive testimony to\r\nany prevailing sentiment were possible.[34] In Peking itself the foreign\r\nMinisters set the example of palliating these abuses, and the only wonder\r\nis that the fire has smouldered so long without bursting into flame.\r\nDuring thirty years--to speak only of the recent period--missionaries\r\nin the interior have encountered the growing hostility of the people,\r\nwhich they have ascribed, perhaps too exclusively, to the machinations of\r\n\"literati and gentry,\" forgetting that the torch would be applied in vain\r\nto a substance that was not inflammable.\r\n\r\nNot that the machinations of the official and literary classes of the\r\ncountry are by any means to be held of little account, for they have\r\nbeen the most potent factor in fomenting and directing the passions\r\nof the people. What corresponds in China to a newspaper press has been\r\nconstantly employed in vilifying the character and execrating the designs\r\nof foreigners, and holding them up continually to the contempt and hatred\r\nof the Chinese people. There was no effective means of contradicting the\r\ncalumnies which were daily poured forth from every centre of population.\r\nAttempts have, indeed, been made by special counterblasts in the form\r\nof missionary publications in the chief citadel of hostility, and in a\r\nless polemic form in the periodicals in the Chinese language conducted by\r\nforeigners, yet these have had little more effect on the popular beliefs\r\nthan a leading article in the 'Times' has upon the flood of anti-English\r\nliterature that is poured out every day from Continental journals. From\r\nan observation of the calumnies which are so unquestioningly accepted\r\nby European populations we may partly judge of the effect of a constant\r\nstream of the same class of vituperative literature among the still more\r\nignorant people of China. The features of both are the same. In Europe, as\r\nin China, there is no crime that the lowest savages have ever committed\r\nwhich is not attributed, with impassioned eloquence and with the finest\r\nliterary skill, to those who are held up to the popular animosity. In\r\nEurope, as in China, the ruling powers encourage the virulence of the\r\npress. In countries where the Government exercises direct control, and in\r\nothers where the connection is less official, extravagances are permitted\r\nwhich can serve no other purpose than that of making the objects of\r\nthe invective so odious that a quarrel with them is rendered popular in\r\nadvance. European Governments thus play with fire, as the Chinese have\r\ndone, but in the case of the latter the incendiary policy has worked out\r\nits logical result.\r\n\r\nNor should it be forgotten that since, in these days, the Chinese have\r\nthe fullest access to European literature, the calumnies of one nation\r\nby another are calculated to confirm their conviction of the turpitude of\r\nall. Neither is their armoury confined to the international amenities of\r\nthe Western press. The charges habitually, and as a matter of course, made\r\nagainst their own countrymen by British writers and speakers would justify\r\na stranger people, already predisposed thereto, in forming the worst\r\nopinion of English character. During the saturnalia of a general election,\r\nwhen the fountains of the great deep are broken up, no baseness, no\r\nfalsity, no treachery, is too gross to be attributed, not to the rabble,\r\nbut to the chosen leaders of the people. Such things being circulated\r\nthroughout the world, preserved in indelible ink, can the enemies of the\r\nBritish nation, or at least the prejudiced Chinese, be greatly blamed for\r\naccepting the character of our people on such unimpeachable evidence?\r\nShould we not judge them on analogous testimony? From whatever sources\r\nthey gather their ideas, however,--whether from the study of foreign\r\nnewspapers, from their own observation of the ways of foreign men and\r\nwomen, or from the gross libels published by their literati,--there is no\r\nreason to doubt that the unfavourable opinion which the Chinese entertain\r\nof foreigners is held by them in good faith.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. IMMEDIATE PROVOCATION.\r\n\r\n    Shock of the Japanese war--European spoliation of\r\n    China--Anarchy apprehended therefrom--Reminiscence of Taiping\r\n    rebellion--Proposals for moderating foreign inroads--Lawlessness\r\n    of foreign Powers--Chinese yield to force but nurse\r\n    resentment--The missionary irritant.\r\n\r\nWhat has caused the chronic anti-foreign movement to swell suddenly to\r\nimperial dimensions, and to explode simultaneously in the capital and in\r\ndistant provinces, is a larger question than we can attempt to answer.\r\nAs contributory causes, however, there are certain facts lying on the\r\nsurface of foreign relations which are too suggestive to be passed over.\r\nThe Japanese war of 1894-95, and the train of events following it, noted\r\nin a previous chapter, struck at the vital centre of the Chinese empire.\r\nForeigners of all nations applied force to China, not to defend person\r\nor property, but to divide up the empire in disregard of the Government\r\nand the people, both assumed to be moribund. The partition of China was\r\ndiscussed in the Western press as a matter in which the Government and\r\nnatives of the country had no concern. Open doors, spheres of influence,\r\nconcessions, protectorates--the various modes in which the Chinese oyster\r\nwas to be cooked and served--were treated solely as questions of rivalry\r\nand preponderance between the Western Powers. The people were not indeed\r\nignored, for the aggressors reckoned on them as their most valuable\r\nasset, the raw material of prospective armies, the source of labour supply\r\nfor excavations and earthworks, and of the payable traffic for railways\r\nand other exotic enterprises. But there is more in human nature than a\r\ncapacity to dig or obey a drill-sergeant, and it is precisely the elements\r\nwhich were disregarded by political, financial, and industrial adventurers\r\nwhich have risen up in judgment against them. The grandiose pronouncements\r\nof the foreign press during the last two or three years were by no means\r\nlost on the Chinese Government. These writings showed that the ambitions\r\nof foreign countries had no limits, while the gratification of them was\r\nabsolutely incompatible with the retention of any semblance of independent\r\nauthority by the rulers of the country.\r\n\r\nReasoning after the fact, and from effect to cause, is apt to be\r\nfallacious, but when the circuit is completed by the joining of prediction\r\nwith realisation, some confidence may be felt in the soundness of\r\nthe conclusion. Those who have observed the condition of China with\r\na sympathetic eye have been for years labouring under the deepest\r\napprehension for the peace of the country. The Japanese war accentuated\r\nthis feeling, and the subsequent ruthless proceedings of the Western\r\nPowers deepened the apprehension. As the forces of aggression could in\r\nnowise be restrained, anxious, but inadequate and altogether ineffectual,\r\nattempts were made to avert their worst effects. Warnings were not\r\nwanting that \"dangers which might have slept for generations to come\r\nhad been suddenly brought within the range of practical politics, and\r\nthat unless measures of precaution were taken in time, what happened in\r\n1894-95 would sooner or later happen again, ... that the Chinese Empire\r\nwould be brought to the verge of disruption; for all the forces, external\r\nand internal, which make for anarchy would be let loose, and the empire\r\nwould be powerless alike to resist dismemberment by the aggressive Powers\r\nor the subversion of authority by internal upheaval.\" The paper from\r\nwhich we quote, doubtless one of many such drawn up in 1896, goes on to\r\nsay: \"However desirous some, or even all, of the Great Powers might be\r\nof saving China from dissolution, they would be paralysed by their own\r\njealousies, and they would perhaps be more concerned to avert a general\r\nwar among themselves than to prevent calamity in China. A crisis might\r\nthus arise more direful in its consequences than the chronic crisis in\r\nthe Ottoman Empire, and a reign of havoc would follow in which millions\r\nwould perish where the loss of thousands now excites the indignation of\r\nthe civilised world.[35] No circumstances would be wanting to intensify\r\nthe horror, for it would not be even civil war, but promiscuous rapine\r\nas aimless and as uncontrollable as a forest fire. A generation has\r\nscarcely passed since China was desolated by the scourge of the Taiping\r\nrebellion, which is thought to have destroyed a population equal to that\r\nof a first-class European State; and a new outbreak of the like kind\r\nwould be more hopeless, inasmuch as the factors which were eventually\r\nbrought into play to extinguish the conflagration in 1862-64 would now\r\nbe wanting, or would be rendered inoperative by the complex circumstances\r\nabove indicated.\"\r\n\r\nThe spectre was anarchy, the provocatives aggression and dismemberment;\r\nand the permanent interests of international commerce were appealed to\r\nto avert the calamities foreshadowed. \"Dismemberment, from the point\r\nof view of the general interests of trade, would be little better than\r\nanarchy.\" Severe pressure was being put on the Chinese Government--even\r\nin 1896, when these and similar forebodings were uttered--to permit\r\nfree communication by steam and rail, and the development of the mineral\r\nresources of their country. It was from such sources that the immediate\r\ndanger to the integrity of the territory and the peace of the State was\r\napprehended, while, on the other hand, the need for the innovations was\r\nfreely granted. \"The Chinese having neither men nor appliances capable\r\nof undertaking either the construction or management of railways, must\r\nbe wholly dependent on foreigners for their inauguration. This state of\r\nthings, fully recognised on all sides, has led speculators and promoters\r\nof all nations to besiege the Chinese authorities with offers of the\r\nmeans of construction and with demands for concessions. But considering\r\nthe relative positions of China and the Western nations, it cannot\r\nbut be admitted that the Chinese have done well to refuse to listen\r\nto such proposals. Rival concessionaires working under the ægis of\r\nextra-territoriality in the interior would be the axe at the root of the\r\ntree of China's integrity.\"\r\n\r\nThe problem of preserving the independence and integrity of China,\r\nwhile permitting the opening of the interior of the country to foreign\r\nenterprise, was felt to be one of the gravest importance, not to be\r\nsettled by the clamour either of rival concession-hunters or the intrigue\r\nof rival States. \"Inland residence,\" wrote Sir Rutherford Alcock, in 1868,\r\n\"will bring weakness to the nation and death to the Government, and must\r\neventuate in greater anarchy than has yet been seen.... Right of residence\r\nin the interior is hardly compatible with an extra-territorial clause.\"\r\n\r\nThe essential condition of safety for the country was evidently,\r\ntherefore, to bar the acquisition of territorial rights by any foreign\r\nGovernment or company. With this view it was urged that at least the\r\nownership and control of railways and mines should be retained in the\r\nhands of the Government itself, under a competent organisation in which\r\nforeign skill and experience should be effectively represented. As\r\nthe then existing railway line of 200 miles was of such a character, a\r\ndevelopment of the same system was recommended for the larger schemes\r\nwhich were thought to be impending. The foreign Powers were urged\r\nto assist China in putting her house in order and in adapting her\r\nadministration to the exigencies of the time.\r\n\r\nSuch were among the proposals made in 1896, and not disapproved by\r\nthe Powers to which they were addressed. But common action thereon by\r\nforeigners was hindered by mutual rivalry and distrust, while the Chinese\r\nGovernment on its part showed neither inclination nor capacity--any more\r\nthan it had ever done--to meet its difficulties by comprehensive measures.\r\nIt preferred the ancient system of resisting, in detail and in secret, the\r\nadvances of foreigners,--a policy of traps and snares and entanglements.\r\nPossibly the paralysis of despair had already reached the nerve centres\r\nof Chinese statesmanship, or the desperate scheme of a general expulsion\r\nof foreigners had begun to fascinate the leading spirits. Certain it is\r\nno practical _rapprochement_ was effected, or even seriously attempted,\r\nbetween the contending forces.\r\n\r\nMeantime, however, the invaders would brook no delay,--they had no\r\ntime for temporising tactics. The \"ugly rush\" began--syndicate rivalled\r\nsyndicate, and Government Government, in dividing up the _corpus vile_.\r\nWithin twelve months of the period just referred to Germany led the way\r\nin the dismemberment of China by cutting off a slice of Shantung; Russia\r\npromptly followed in Liaotung; then Great Britain took Weihai-wei as a\r\nset-off, and assumed an interest in the central zone keener than that\r\nof the Chinese Government itself. Other Powers followed with imperious\r\ndemands for portions of Chinese territory, on no ground whatever\r\nexcept that China was weak. Every law save the law of the strongest\r\nwas suspended. Justice and mercy were thrown to the winds. And yet the\r\norgies of spoliation were followed by no change in the outward forms of\r\ndiplomatic relations with the Chinese Government. Foreign representatives\r\ncontinued to negotiate as if the power of that Government remained intact,\r\nthough to assume, for one purpose, that there was neither sentient\r\norganism nor sovereign authority in China, and for another, that the\r\nGovernment retained its full competence,[36] was obviously to bring chaos\r\ninto their intercourse. As a consequence, diplomatic correspondence\r\nwith China since 1898--the British share of which, so far as has been\r\npublished, extends to a thousand pages--is but a harvest of Dead Sea\r\nFruit.\r\n\r\nBut Chinese relations being a compound of courtesy and force on the\r\npart of foreign Powers, it is not difficult to divine which of the two\r\nmust be the dominant factor. Though they bowed their heads in morose\r\nsilence before their conquerors, Chinese statesmen retained sufficient\r\nvitality to discriminate between platonic diplomacy and the \"mailed\r\nfist,\" yielding in all things to menace, in nothing to argument. To\r\nseize territory, under this _régime_, presented less difficulty than to\r\nobtain redress for trivial injuries. Aggressive Powers were respected\r\naccording to the measure of their aggression, while those who concerned\r\nthemselves with the preservation of the empire met with no recognition\r\nwhatever. British schemes were thwarted at every point, while other\r\nPowers ran riot throughout the territory. For this reason the Chinese\r\nGovernment collectively, and individual mandarins, have been stigmatised\r\nas anti-British, as if to be so were a blot upon their escutcheons. No\r\ndoubt they are; but to assume on that account that the Chinese rulers\r\nare pro-Russian, pro-French, or pro-German is more than the premisses\r\nseem to warrant. History and tradition are alike opposed to such an\r\nidea. That peculiar kind of patriot, the friend of every country but\r\nhis own, is not much in evidence in China. The vainest and most jealous\r\nnation on earth was not likely in a moment to suppress its self-love,\r\ninvert its whole character, and welcome an army of foreign adventurers,\r\nno matter of what nationality, who came in the guise not of servants but\r\nmasters. And, setting sentiment aside, the Chinese were not blind to the\r\nmaterial consequences of the foreign schemes which were pressed on them,\r\nbut were as keenly alive to the danger of intrusting railway and mining\r\nenterprises to foreigners as they had always shown themselves to be\r\nwhen their military and naval armaments were concerned. The memorials of\r\nprovincial authorities clearly prove this. If, therefore, they admitted\r\nthe disruptive agency into their country, it was from no love of the\r\ninterlopers, but solely by way of submission to superior force, and under\r\nthe same mental reservation with which they had subscribed to all their\r\nprevious treaty engagements.\r\n\r\nThe chronic missionary irritant mentioned in previous chapters had been\r\nsteadily spreading, and the hostility evoked by it as steadily increasing.\r\nChristianity being the only character in which foreigners had presented\r\nthemselves to the view of the masses, the extirpation of it stood in the\r\nforefront of the anti-foreign programme. The disasters which the governing\r\nclasses had always apprehended from the extension of foreign missions had\r\nsuddenly assumed the form of a concrete reality. All that its opponents\r\nhad for generations foretold became fact: their administration was being\r\nundermined, their traditions set at nought, their very territory wrenched\r\nfrom them in the name of the foreign religion. Propagandism was finally\r\nunmasked by the German Emperor in the uncompromising manner characteristic\r\nof that potentate. The Name that is above every name was openly made\r\nsubservient to the lust of conquest. China saw at last that she was really\r\ndoomed through the instrumentality of the religion which she had engaged\r\nherself to tolerate.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE DYNASTIC FACTOR.\r\n\r\n    Irregularity of the succession--Defensive position of the\r\n    empress-dowager--Cantonese reformers influence emperor--Regent's\r\n    alarm, vengeance and reaction--The new heir-apparent.\r\n\r\nEver since the _coup d'état_ in January 1875, whereby the empress-regent\r\nby her own fiat placed her infant nephew on the throne of her deceased\r\nson, to the exclusion of more legitimate heirs, the dynastic question\r\nhas been regarded by Chinese patriots as a certain source of future\r\ntrouble.[37] The imperial dignity was not the only matter involved in the\r\nsuccession, but a vast amount of property also, and so many members of\r\nthe imperial clan were interested in the result that it was deemed certain\r\nthat the partisans of legitimacy would lie in wait for an opportunity of\r\nenforcing the claims of the rightful heir. As it is customary to attribute\r\nthe acts of statesmen to personal motives, it has never been doubted that\r\nthe interest of the empress-regent in setting the reigning emperor on the\r\nthrone was sufficiently explained by her own lust of power. We know what\r\nis done, but do not always know what is prevented, and in the case of\r\nthe families of both the elder brothers who were passed over, there may\r\nhave been practical as well as judicial reasons to justify even a _coup\r\nd'état_ which supplanted them. From what has recently been revealed of\r\nthe character of Prince Tuan, for example, the exclusion of his progeny\r\nmay possibly have been a providential deliverance.\r\n\r\nBe these things as they may, however, and be her ulterior motives what\r\nthey may, the solicitude of the empress-regent has been constantly\r\ndirected to protecting the weak point in her dynastic defences. The\r\nchildlessness of the present emperor, as well as the misfortunes of\r\nthe empire since he assumed the reins of power in 1889, of course added\r\nindefinitely to her anxiety, while at the same time serving to keep alive\r\nthe pretensions of the elder branches.\r\n\r\nSpeaking, as we have done throughout, only of what is apparent, the\r\nsuccession question was brought to the point of incandescence by certain\r\nevents in 1898. Great and justifiable discontent had arisen in the\r\nprovinces with the manner in which the affairs of the empire had been\r\nconducted, resulting in humiliation and calamity. The idea of doing\r\nsomething to stem the tide of misgovernment by enforcing the lessons\r\nof recent misfortune was freely discussed. But the Chinese have not\r\ndiscovered any method of remedying grievances except insurrections\r\nin one form or another, on a small or on a large scale. A movement of\r\nthis character has been on foot in the Canton province ever since the\r\nJapanese war. These revolutionary conspiracies have indeed been so well\r\norganised, and so powerfully supported, that once, if not oftener, the\r\nprovincial city of Canton has narrowly escaped capture. The agitation has\r\nbeen directed nominally against the Manchu Government. Whether directly\r\nassociated with the insurrectionary propaganda or not, another body\r\nafterwards challenged public notice under the name of Reformers. As in the\r\ncase of the insurrectionary movement, many Government officials secretly\r\ngave their adhesion to the cause, and inspired the leaders with confidence\r\nin the ultimate success of their schemes.\r\n\r\nReform had been preached continuously to China from every foreign pulpit\r\nfor forty years. \"Reform or perish\" was the regular formula--words so\r\neasily written that no resident, tourist, publicist, foreign official,\r\nor any one with a pen or a tongue, refrained from reiterating them\r\ncontinually. Individually every Chinese official with whom foreigners came\r\nin contact joined in the cry. But though the general demand was unanimous,\r\nthere was diversity in the details, and in such a case the details were\r\neverything. A dozen writers, each insisting on the necessity of thorough\r\nreform, would postulate separately some indispensable preliminary to any\r\nreform whatsoever. These indispensable preliminaries, added together,\r\nwould have left nothing for the substantive portion of the programme; by\r\nthem Chinese administration would have been renovated from top to bottom.\r\nSuch was the difficulty which friends and critics experienced in knowing\r\nwhere to begin in their efforts to reduce the general to the particular.\r\n\r\nIn 1898, however, a bold attempt was made to launch a comprehensive scheme\r\nof reform by imperial fiat. A Cantonese named Kang Yu-wei, backed by a\r\nbody of opinion,--of the extent and value of which different estimates may\r\nbe formed, \"financed,\" of course, as popular leaders must be,--obtained\r\nthe ear of the emperor, and induced him to promulgate a budget of edicts\r\nof startling novelty. Being deemed revolutionary, they excited alarm\r\nin the Imperial Court. What were the specific grounds of alarm may be\r\neasily surmised. Foreigners who refer it exclusively to the question of\r\nreform may possibly take as partial a view of this as they have done of\r\nother Court movements. What is known is, that the empress-regent, always\r\nready to strike when her interest or her schemes have been threatened,\r\npounced on the unfortunate emperor, and by force of will and the parental\r\nauthority which counts for so much in China, and in virtue of the Great\r\nSeal which she had reserved when handing over her trust, made him revoke\r\nhis revolutionary edicts, hunted out his dangerous counsellors and\r\npunished them as traitors. The embers of reform were thus for the time\r\nruthlessly stamped out. Of the ethics of these proceedings it is needless\r\nto speak: not ethics but strength decided the issue; nature's primeval law\r\nwas not suspended in favour of the adventurous spirits who flew at such\r\nhigh game. A reaction against all reform naturally set in, and the old\r\nstruggle was renewed: between conservation and revolution, viewed from\r\nthe Chinese Court side; between purity and corruption, viewed from that\r\nof the Reformers.\r\n\r\nBut the quarrel cannot be restricted to so simple an issue as either of\r\nthese. The question between the Reformers and the Court was complicated by\r\nsundry important considerations. In the first place, the capture of the\r\nEmperor by Kang Yu-wei was directly inspired by the teaching of foreign\r\nmissionaries. In the second place, the movement originated in the same\r\nsouthern provinces whence the Taiping rebellion itself had sprung, and\r\nwhere conspiracies against the Government had been active since 1895.\r\nAnd thirdly, the reform agitation was ostentatiously patronised by the\r\nforeign, or at least by the English, press, while the leaders of the\r\ninsurgents found a safe asylum, if not an effective base of operations,\r\nin Hongkong and in foreign countries. Taking these circumstances\r\ntogether, therefore, whatever may be thought of the intrinsic merits\r\nof the double agitation, it could scarcely be expected that the Powers\r\nwhich saw themselves so seriously menaced should draw any such fine\r\ndistinction between the ostensible objects of the reformers and of the\r\nrevolutionaries, as to regard the one with complacency while suppressing\r\nthe other. The most abject of governments and the most timid of animals\r\nwill resist to the death an attack which threatens their existence. There\r\nwould be nothing unnatural, therefore, in the resentment of the Imperial\r\nGovernment against its disaffected people being, by the process which\r\nis so familiar to us in family quarrels, temporarily diverted from the\r\ndomestic to the foreign enemy, against whom the combined hostility of all\r\nparties in the Chinese State might, for the time being, be concentrated.\r\n\r\nWithout, however, attempting to assign their relative values to all or\r\nany of these factors in the question, it seems evident that the events of\r\n1898 revealed the elements of a drama in which the contending factions in\r\nthe Court were forced to show their colours. The course of the conflict\r\nduring the year and a half following the autumn of 1898 has probably\r\nbeen obscured rather than elucidated by the contradictory reports and\r\nfluctuating comments which have been so freely disseminated with but\r\nslight regard to the authenticity of their origin. But the nomination of\r\na grandson of Prince Tun as heir-apparent, which was decreed in January\r\n1900, looks like a belated, if not compulsory, recognition of the prior\r\nclaims of that Princes family, and a confession that the Emperor Kwanghsu\r\nhas kept the rightful heir twenty-five years out of his inheritance;\r\nfor the grandson now selected possesses no right which the grandson set\r\naside in 1875 did not possess. The relations of Prince Tuan, the father\r\nof the emperor designate, with the empress-regent are as obscure as\r\nthe intricacies of palace politics usually are to contemporary foreign\r\nobservers. Fortunately, however (in one sense), the cross-currents and\r\nundercurrents of the Court, the question who are confederates and who\r\nrivals, who betrayers and who betrayed, in the imperial camp, are matters\r\nwhich have to a great extent been deprived of their significance. Under\r\nnormal conditions the dynastic imbroglio might have had a perturbing\r\ninfluence on the policy of foreign Powers, but the explosion of last\r\nsummer has relegated all such domestic questions to a secondary place.\r\nWhen the correspondent of the 'Times' could report that there was \"no\r\nGovernment\" in Peking, the _personnel_ of that Government lost its\r\npractical interest. The old order, with its sins and sorrows, has indeed\r\npassed away, but to find a substitute for it is a problem that will tax\r\nthe wisdom as well as the forbearance of the world. The anarchy which\r\nhas been so long dreaded is actually upon us, and the prospective horrors\r\nof it are assuredly not lessened by the outbreak being signalised in the\r\ncapital rather than in the provinces.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE CHINESE OUTBREAK.\r\n\r\n    Chinese methods of expelling foreigners--Secret societies--The\r\n    Boxers.\r\n\r\nConsidering as a whole, therefore, the succession of crushing blows which\r\nduring the past six years have been dealt against the integrity of China\r\nby open enemies and dissimulating friends, we may conceive, at least\r\npartially, the hatred of foreigners which exists in the country. In this\r\ncase we are not driven to assume any wide difference between the Chinese\r\nand races more nearly allied to ourselves, nor need we seek to account\r\nfor their demonstrations by defects in their moral or religious training.\r\nHad even the whole population of China been miraculously converted to\r\nChristianity, as suggested by Sir Robert Hart ('Fortnightly Review,'\r\nNovember 1900), it is not permissible to assume that they would have\r\ncontinued turning the other cheek to so many smiters. If we suppose the\r\ncase of any Western nation subjected to the experiences through which\r\nthe Chinese have had to pass at the hands of foreign dictators, the mode\r\nin which it would act may afford us some measure by which to gauge the\r\nexcesses of the Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe origin and organisation of the recent outbreak will no doubt be a\r\ntopic of discussion for some time to come, and it is not within our\r\nprovince to anticipate the final verdict on it. But, as in certain\r\ncontagious diseases which become constitutional, the angry symptoms first\r\nshow themselves at the point of infection, it is interesting to note\r\nthat the German sphere in Shantung enjoys the distinction of being the\r\ncradle of the principal agency producing the cataclysm. The prominence\r\nsuddenly attained by the Boxer movement is probably fortuitous, due to\r\nits casual connection with high personages. Secret societies are nothing\r\nnew, nor societies of divers sorts which have scarcely the pretence of\r\nsecrecy. As weeds spring up where cultivation is neglected, these social\r\ngrowths may be considered in the light of spontaneous efforts to occupy\r\nground left vacant by the constituted Government,--a sort of excrescence\r\nof autonomy rising and falling according as the administration is less or\r\nmore efficient. The members of these societies may be ascetics who follow\r\nstrict rules of living, defenders of popular rights, or mere \"bullies\"\r\nwho may be hired. They bear virtuous titles, but it is safe to assume that\r\nthe ostensible object of the associations is in practice invariably lost\r\nin schemes of a different complexion. Sometimes in collision, at other\r\ntimes in collusion, with the established Government, these societies are\r\na mobile factor, a sort of shifting ballast, always to be reckoned with\r\nin the Chinese economy.\r\n\r\nAs the Boxers are an athletic corps, drilled and exercised, it was\r\nnatural to inquire, when their imposing force stood revealed, how\r\nsuch a formidable movement could have been organised among the Chinese\r\npeople without the fact becoming known to the foreign residents in the\r\ncountry. One answer is, that those who saw what was going on and warned\r\ntheir countrymen were decried as alarmists, and then held their peace.\r\nThe wisest were but little wiser than their neighbours, for as weather\r\nprophets easily forecast the character of the following season, while\r\nthey are at fault as regards that of the next twenty-four hours, so those\r\nwho are able to predict with confidence the remote future in China are\r\noften the most blind to the nearer future which is reckoned by days or\r\nmonths. But incredulity was excusable in the present case, for the extent\r\nand apparent suddenness of the movement were really unprecedented. Such a\r\nforce has not been mobilised and kept in the field in a militant condition\r\nwithout immense effort and liberal supplies, for though pillage might\r\ngo far, it would not go all the way in supporting so large a body for\r\nany length of time. The junction of the Boxers with imperial troops, the\r\nrelations of the commanders to members of the imperial family, and the\r\ninfluence of the movement on the question of the dynastic succession, are\r\nall matters on which light will be welcome; for as no military invasion\r\nof the territory has ever called forth such a general enthusiasm of\r\nresistance, interesting, indeed, will be the discovery of the real genesis\r\nof a rising at once spontaneous and aggressive.\r\n\r\nThe most practical observation, however, that foreign nations have been\r\nforced to make during the crisis is that, whatever might have been the\r\nseparate designs of those who presided over the general movement, the\r\nrallying flag of the combination was the extermination of foreigners.\r\nThat was the pretext which, for the time being at least, reconciled\r\nall antagonisms and satisfied all consciences. It seemed as if the\r\nlong-accumulated hatred of the Chinese had gathered to a head, and its\r\nwhole force had been concentrated in one supreme effort to sweep the\r\naliens throughout the empire into the sea. That elaborate preparation had\r\nbeen made to carry this into effect seems to be placed beyond doubt, the\r\nrulers of China evidently conceiving that the effort would be successful.\r\n\r\nThe excuse put forward in palliation of an anti-crusade headed by the\r\nhighest personages in the empire bears an interesting family resemblance\r\nto the apology usually made for rebels. Being beguiled by false prophets,\r\nthey believed they would succeed;[38] and success would have justified the\r\nventure. The facts are such as no subsequent negotiations, no treaties,\r\nno modifications of government, no reform, no professions of any kind,\r\ncan ever explain away.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE CRUX.\r\n\r\n    Concert of foreign Powers unstable--Divergent aims--Aggressive\r\n    and non-aggressive Powers--Unpromising outlook--The progress of\r\n    Russia the only permanent element.\r\n\r\nIf conflicting forces in China have been united in an effort to expel\r\nthe foreigners, so the non-Chinese world has been forced into temporary\r\nagreement in order to extinguish a conflagration which endangered all\r\ninterests. But the Powers assembled to execute judgment and restore order\r\nin China present a picturesque diversity of ulterior aims. Their unity\r\ncan hardly, therefore, be expected to survive the emergency which gave it\r\nbirth. After the storm has passed--if it does pass--the permanent policy\r\nof the several Powers may be expected to resume its normal sway. Of the\r\ncharacter of these different policies we are not left in doubt, for in the\r\nhistory of the past six years it has been revealed in overt acts bearing\r\na higher authority than the most solemn official manifestoes.\r\n\r\nThe principal Powers concerned may be ranged in three groups--the\r\naggressive, the non-aggressive, and the absorbent. Under the first\r\nmust be ranked Japan, France, and Germany. Facts which cannot lie have\r\nproved that these three Powers have long cherished designs upon the\r\nterritory of China. No doubt they flatter themselves with the belief\r\nthat their rule over such portions of Chinese soil as may come under\r\ntheir control would be a blessing to mankind, an opinion which it would\r\nserve no good purpose to controvert. And they reckon that, in addition\r\nto the higher civilisation which they propose to confer on the Chinese\r\npeople and Government, they will secure material advantages for their\r\nown populations. The ruling characteristic, however, of this policy is\r\nthat it is factitious, adventurous, and ideal, in search of interests\r\nto defend rather than framed for the defence of interests existing. It\r\nis essentially, therefore, an aggressive policy, though, in a sense,\r\nalso progressive. Dividing the world into communities to be conquered\r\nand nations who are fitted to conquer them, it represents the primeval\r\nmoving power in ethnic evolution. But it is a policy quite unsuited for\r\nco-operation, and the attempt to yoke together Governments, certain of\r\nwhom are moved empirically by facts as they exist and as they arise,\r\nand others by the desire of creating facts, ends--as all concerts\r\nof antagonistic interests must end--most likely in explosion. A safe\r\ncalculation may be made as to the action of a non-aggressive Power,\r\nunder given circumstances, as the action of a man of business may be\r\napproximately inferred from obvious considerations of pecuniary advantage.\r\nBut in the case of States with ideal policies, like France and Germany,\r\nno such forecast can be made. This radical divergence between the aims of\r\nthe Powers who are called upon to decree the fate of China must render a\r\nsincere agreement between them, under any circumstances, impossible; and\r\nif the policy of one of them should happen to be directed by a political\r\ngenius ambitious of distinction, the course of the whole would be subject\r\nto aberrations incalculable. It is true that the Governments which have\r\nmarked out for themselves these extensive plans of aggression may begin\r\nto perceive that their proceedings in China have been somewhat in advance\r\nof any justification, also that they have been reckoning without their\r\nhost, and that to found and maintain empires in further Asia may put a\r\nstrain upon their resources out of proportion to the material gains to\r\nbe derived from the enterprise. Perceiving that their \"vaulting ambition\r\nmay o'erleap itself\" and land them on the off-side of the horse, they may\r\nshow themselves willing, for the moment, to attenuate the significance\r\nof their previous energy. The discovery that the conquest of China\r\ninvolves something more than a military promenade may induce them to\r\nmake professions which, however sincere for the time being, accord but\r\nindifferently with established facts. In the procession of history,\r\nhowever, it is the facts and not the words which ultimately prevail.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the only canon by which it is safe to interpret the\r\napocalyptic exchange of notes just announced between Great Britain and\r\nGermany, whose significance, like that of the conversation of a Chinese,\r\nlies in the things which are not said. Considered as a convention, it\r\nmust be classed with those elastic bargains of which several examples\r\noccur in the preceding narrative, in which one party has a definite\r\naim and the other not, and which is therefore destined to be employed\r\nexclusively to the advantage of the former. _Vigilantibus non dormientibus\r\nservit lex._ Without knowing what secret inducements led to such a\r\ndeclaration of policy between Great Britain and Germany it is impossible\r\nto assign a value to it. Its most authoritative expositors in the German\r\npress rejoice in the fact that it pins Great Britain down to the only\r\npolicy which she has ever pursued, or ever will,--a policy in which her\r\npublic utterances have throughout coincided with her overt acts,--that,\r\nnamely, of opening Chinese and all other markets not for herself but\r\nfor the whole world on equal terms. An agreement, however, which does\r\nnot arrest French encroachments in the south, Russian appropriations in\r\nthe north, nor German exclusive exploitations in Shantung or elsewhere,\r\ncontributes little to that maintenance of the integrity of China which is\r\nits professed object. Neither the world at large nor China herself will\r\nbenefit greatly by a verbal restriction on the one Power to whom the \"open\r\ndoor\" and the integrity of China are articles of political religion and\r\nof undeviating practice. And the clause which solemnly reserves to the\r\ntwo parties the right of consulting together in certain contingencies\r\ngives to the transaction a very platonic character. But a covenant whose\r\nmeaning is veiled is always a hazardous operation, even in private life,\r\nwhere the power of definite interpretation lies with the more aggressive\r\nof the two parties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe non-aggressive Powers may be defined as those whose citizens have\r\nestablished in the country a substantial position, which their Governments\r\nhave been slow to protect. The principal representatives of this group\r\nare Great Britain and the United States, whose interests in China have\r\nmany times been defined as commercial, and not territorial. They have\r\nacted consistently on the conviction that there is no country in the\r\nworld where conquest for the sake of commerce was less justifiable than\r\nin China, which possesses a large population inured to labour, accustomed\r\nto the luxuries of a civilised society, and with unsurpassed aptitude\r\nfor business. No special credit is due to the two Anglo-Saxon nations for\r\ntheir recognition of these circumstances, except in so far as it indicates\r\nan intelligent appreciation of their own interests. They desire, as an\r\nordinary trader or manufacturer would, that a good customer may be kept\r\non his legs, and that a promising inheritance shall not be alienated\r\nfrom the next generation of their merchants. Their policy, however, being\r\nessentially passive and conservative, suffers from the defects of these\r\nqualities, and is liable to be overborne by the more energetic action of\r\nthe Powers which we have ventured to place in the aggressive class.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere remains the third group, which consists of one member, and that is\r\nRussia. Although Russia is in effect more aggressive than all the others\r\nput together, her annexations have been conducted under a different\r\nformula from those of Germany, France, or Japan. It is not merely that she\r\nhas avoided hostilities, and effected her purpose by patient and adroit\r\ndiplomacy, but that her acquisitions of Chinese territory have not been\r\nof the \"wild-cat\" order, but genuine integral additions to her existing\r\npossessions. The expansion of Russia, whether a matter to be deplored\r\nor applauded, is at any rate a natural growth, unduly forced at times,\r\nbut steady and progressive. It is the shadow of this secular advance of\r\nRussia that covers the whole Far Eastern situation, and has in fact done\r\nso for nearly fifty years. The character of her progress could not be\r\nbetter described, even with the lights we now possess, than it was by Sir\r\nRutherford Alcock as far back as 1855. With rare clearness of vision and\r\nfirmness of touch he thus foretold the position which Russia was destined\r\nto occupy in the Far East:--\r\n\r\n    China has long been impotent. Russia has within the last few\r\n    years, by force of diplomacy, appropriated half the province\r\n    of Manchuria, the ancient patrimony of the reigning dynasty,\r\n    and with it the command of the river Amur. If this other great\r\n    Leviathan ... has not yet swallowed the whole empire, it can only\r\n    be that, great as are its capacities, there are limits imposed by\r\n    nature to the powers of deglutition and digestion in the largest\r\n    boa-constrictor or predatory animal yet discovered. In the mean\r\n    time the danger is more immediate and menacing to Europe than\r\n    to China, perhaps; for Russia has at Sakhalin, the mouth of the\r\n    Amur, and the adjoining coasts of the Western continent, laid the\r\n    foundation for a position as menacing to European commerce as any\r\n    now existing at the opposite extremity in the Baltic. Stretching\r\n    with giant arms across the whole breadth of Northern Asia and\r\n    Europe from fastnesses at each end, Asiatic hordes, directed by\r\n    Western genius and science, are held in leash, ready to let slip\r\n    over the fair and fertile south of both continents. The wealthiest\r\n    regions of both Europe and Asia are at once threatened by this\r\n    modern colossus.... China, India, and the kingdoms of Southern\r\n    Europe form but the three different stages of invading progress.\r\n    Long before the whole of such a gigantic scheme of rule and\r\n    conquest can have its accomplishment in China--the most helpless\r\n    as well as the richest of all the victims--Russia will be enabled\r\n    to reap the first-fruits and take instalments of the larger and\r\n    more distant spoil, by controlling the trade of Northern China\r\n    and the rich European trade so recently developed in its seas.\r\n\r\nRussia alone has a policy independent at once of accidents, autocrats,\r\nshifting governing bodies, and of all personalities, weak or strong.\r\nWith the accumulated force of past achievements, an unbroken tradition,\r\nand great military forces massed on a frontier which is no frontier,\r\nRussia among the other Powers now masquerading in the Far East is as the\r\niron vessel floating among the earthenware pots. Russian publicists, in\r\norder to strengthen the dominant position to which they aspire, have been\r\nproclaiming with increasing insistency that they are the only nation who\r\ncan deal with the Chinese Question because they are themselves an Asiatic\r\npeople. They justify this pretension by their primitive Asiatic military\r\nethics, and it is an instructive spectacle to see their forces massacring\r\nChinese populations wholesale while their diplomatists are ostentatiously\r\nshielding those in high places from the just consequences of their\r\ncrimes. The German Emperor has said many clever and some foolish things,\r\nbut perhaps he never did a wiser one than in making over his schemes of\r\nvengeance to his august ally, for the work is more becoming to an Asiatic\r\nthan a Teutonic people.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom an areopagus composed of these incongruous elements great\r\nachievements are expected, but the comparison between the end and the\r\nmeans inspires little confidence as to the result. The task itself is\r\ngigantic enough to appal the boldest political experimenter that ever\r\nlived, while its complexity involves insoluble contradictions. China,\r\nthe very Government itself, has been guilty of outrages against foreign\r\nnations such as no nation can forgive another. The foreign Powers have\r\nbeen openly and persistently defied--their people massacred throughout\r\nthe empire. Yet the nations so hated and flouted assume that they\r\nhave a mission to fulfil in setting up a stable Government in China, a\r\nGovernment to be created for their own convenience, with which they may\r\nin future negotiate,--a puppet Government, therefore, yet one which is to\r\nmaintain peace and good order throughout a vast empire by the prestige\r\nof its authority over a loyal and devoted people. As buttresses to the\r\nstability of the new _régime_, \"the loyal southern viceroys,\" as they\r\nare termed--loyal to whom, or to what?--deriving authority, it is to be\r\npresumed, from the Government which is to be patronised by foreigners, are\r\nexpected to meet the convenience of the dictators and prevent anarchy in\r\nthe provinces. In short, the subjective Chinaman, as we have ventured to\r\ncall the fabulous animal so often evolved from Western consciousness, is\r\nonce more to be brought on the scene, and do everything that is expected\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nA puppet Government is an intelligible thing, but of a puppet pulled by\r\na dozen strings no clear conception can be formed. Such, however, has\r\nbeen the anomalous history of foreign relations with China, that the\r\nidentical state of things now threatening has not been absent from the\r\nminds of observers for a whole generation. The missionary question alone\r\nwas thought likely to result in a deadlock between China and the Powers.\r\nMore than thirty years ago Sir Rutherford Alcock was impressed with the\r\ndestructive effect of \"each treaty Power dictating to the Government and\r\ncoercing its officers in their jurisdiction wherever Christians were\r\nconcerned.\" This, he thought, \"would tend to paralyse and bring into\r\ncontempt the executive, leading to a process of disintegration fatal to\r\nthe existence of the Empire.\" What was then thought applicable to the\r\nmissionary field now affects the whole range of international intercourse\r\nand of Chinese government. We are, in fact, confronted by two anarchies\r\nof most serious portent--anarchy in the administration of China, and\r\nanarchy among the foreign Powers who are so active in that country. From\r\nthe beginning of the intervention to protect the Legations anarchy among\r\nthe Allies has been the predominant feature: it was that which frustrated\r\neffective action in June, and led to such severe loss and suffering.\r\nAnarchy alone can account for the lawless proceedings at Tientsin,\r\nPeking, and on the Chinese coast, which on any other hypothesis would be a\r\ndisgrace to civilisation. Anarchy has characterised all the utterances of\r\nthe Western Powers. Beginning at the wrong end with great swelling words\r\nfull of sound and fury, the Powers who assumed to lead have gradually\r\ntoned down their threats as they obtained more light on the situation\r\nand on their own incapacity to deal with it. The latest expression of\r\nthis incapacity is the Anglo-German Agreement, already referred to, which\r\nperpetuates the fallacy of excluding the Chinese factor from the China\r\nquestion. Yet out of, even by means of, this confusion it is expected that\r\norder may be established in China! _Similia similibus!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn this desperate imbroglio the ultimate advantage will no doubt fall\r\nto those members of the unnatural coalition who have the clearest views\r\nand the firmest resolution in giving effect to them. The dubious and\r\nvacillating Powers frittering away their political forces, espousing every\r\ncontradiction in succession, and turning in weariness from the disgusting\r\nscenes in which they will have reluctantly participated, will in all\r\nprobability leave the path open for their neighbours who have steadier\r\naims and fewer scruples.\r\n\r\nRussia has been in real, though not nominal or legal, possession of\r\nManchuria since 1896. She has absorbed in times past many stony deserts\r\nand barren solitudes, but in Manchuria she has for the first time\r\nacquired a rich territory with an all-important sea-base and a virile\r\npopulation, whereby her dominant position in Eastern Asia has been\r\nrendered inexpugnable. China lies at her feet. Obviously, therefore,\r\nher interests in that empire are not only distinct from, but opposed to,\r\nthose of every other Power: for while they may desire (1) to support an\r\nefficient government and keep the empire of China on its legs, and (2) to\r\ncut off slices of the territory for their own use,--two contradictory and\r\nmutually destructive policies,--Russia has no need to be anxious, either\r\nas to the efficiency of any Chinese Government or as to her own ulterior\r\ninterests in the territory. The looser the substance to be absorbed the\r\nmore painless will be the process of absorption. Once established in\r\nstrength in Manchuria, disorder on her frontier may afford the perhaps not\r\nunwelcome opportunity of restoring order on her own terms,--of, in fact,\r\ncontinuing the process by which Siberia with Central and North-Eastern\r\nAsia have, in the course of two hundred years, been gradually incorporated\r\ninto the Russian Empire. \"It may well be doubted,\" wrote Sir Rutherford\r\nAlcock in 1868, \"if this vast empire (of China) is not too large to be\r\nany longer governed from Peking. It is impossible to conceive a more\r\ndisadvantageous site for the capital.\" Disadvantageous, perhaps, to\r\nChina, whose centre of gravity lies a thousand miles to the south; but\r\nnot disadvantageous to a Power whose strength is consolidated five hundred\r\nmiles to the north.[39]\r\n\r\nAnd the veto which Russia has exercised over the acts of the Chinese\r\nGovernment since 1895, whereby she has been able, at her pleasure, to\r\nfrustrate the enterprises of other Powers, is not likely to fall into\r\nabeyance when that Government has been prostrated by its own folly. For\r\nthe weaker the Chinese Government becomes the greater will be its need of\r\ncorrection and guidance. But we have only to imagine half-a-dozen Powers,\r\neach aspiring, and some of them fully resolved, to exercise their special\r\nveto over the proposals of the others, to realise the tragic complexity\r\nof the international problems which now present themselves for solution.\r\nA government holding together three hundred millions of people ripened\r\nfor rebellion, potentially at war with the rest of the world, and yet\r\ngoverning under multiple tutelage--such is the prospect before us. Of\r\nall the legacies which the nineteenth bequeaths to the twentieth century,\r\nthere is none more portentous than that of the sick giant of the Far East.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [33] See vol. i. p. 38.\r\n\r\n [34] Mr Freeman-Mitford, in 'The Attaché at Peking,' recently\r\n    published, tells the following good story illustrative of this\r\n    (p. 168). M. de Mas, the Spanish Minister, happening to be at\r\n    the house of Hêng-Chi, and knowing that he had a little son of\r\n    whom he was inordinately proud, thought it would be a very pretty\r\n    compliment if he asked to see the little boy, who was accordingly\r\n    produced, sucking his thumb after the manner of his years. Him his\r\n    father ordered to pay his respects to M. de Mas--that is to say,\r\n    shake his united fists at him in token of salutation; instead of\r\n    which the child, after long silence and much urging, taking his\r\n    thumb deliberately out of his mouth roared out \"Kwei-tzŭ\" (devils)\r\n    at the top of his voice and fled.\r\n\r\n [35] Referring to the massacre of Armenian Christians, with regard\r\n    to which Germany took up a very different attitude from that now\r\n    assumed towards China--a circumstance, by the way, which serves\r\n    to reduce the \"Christian\" factor in the present intervention to\r\n    its proper value.\r\n\r\n [36] Or, as M. Paul Boell expresses it, \"Traitant la Chine tantôt\r\n    comme un pouvoir tout à fait formidable, tantôt comme une\r\n    puissance nègre de septième ordre.\"\r\n\r\n [37] Kwanghsu, being first cousin to the deceased Emperor Tungchih,\r\n    could not, according to Chinese usage, be his heir. In adopting\r\n    him, therefore, as posthumous heir to the previous Emperor\r\n    Hsienfêng, his uncle, the Regent left her own son, the Emperor\r\n    Tungchih, without an heir, promising to supply the want from\r\n    the future offspring of Kwanghsu, or by some other adoption; but\r\n    against this procedure strong protests were made. The arrangement,\r\n    however, conferred upon the Dowager-Empress, as the widow of\r\n    Hsienfêng, the authority of a mother over his heir, a circumstance\r\n    which to a large extent accounts for the filial deference the\r\n    reigning emperor has always paid to his adoptive mother.\r\n\r\n [38] Thirty years ago the great Nanking viceroy, Tsêng Kwo-fan,\r\n    assured the Government in a memorial to the throne that if the\r\n    question of treaty revision could not be satisfactorily arranged\r\n    with foreigners, he had forces enough under his orders to drive\r\n    them all into the sea.\r\n\r\n [39] The question of removing the capital to a more convenient site\r\n    has been discussed academically--by foreigners--for many years,\r\n    their view being that Nanking would be the most suitable. No doubt\r\n    a central point open to the sea would be more convenient for the\r\n    maritime Powers, but that is evidently not an advantage which\r\n    commends itself to the Chinese themselves. During the Japanese war\r\n    their strategists urged the removal of the Court from Peking to\r\n    Signan fu in Shensi, simply on the ground of the inaccessibility\r\n    of the latter site. The transport was prepared and the Emperor\r\n    was ready, but the Empress-Dowager vetoed the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nSIR RUTHERFORD ALCOCK'S LATER YEARS.\r\n\r\n    Retirement--Literary work--Social and charitable\r\n    occupations--Geographical Society--Borneo--Failing health--Active\r\n    to the end.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter twenty-seven years' service in the Far East Sir Rutherford Alcock\r\nspent the remaining twenty-seven years of his life in his own country,\r\nnot in the placid enjoyment of a well-earned leisure or in mere literary\r\nrecreation, but in labours incessant for the good of his countrymen.\r\nThough the scene had changed, the methodical habits of his business life\r\nremained unaltered, and were directed in their full activity to the duties\r\nthat presented themselves in England.\r\n\r\nDuring his whole active life Sir Rutherford had cherished the hope of\r\noccupying his years of leisure with work for the sick and needy. His\r\nvisit to England, 1856-58, perhaps gave the definite direction to this\r\naspiration, and led him to see that hospitals, schools, prisons, and\r\nsimilar institutions would afford the best available medium through\r\nwhich he could reach the object of his desires. No sooner, therefore,\r\nwas he released from official service than the ex-army surgeon returned\r\nto his first love. The associations of his youth were bound up with the\r\ntwo hospitals in Westminster where he had studied. There, accordingly,\r\nafter the lapse of forty years, his active connection with the medical\r\nschools was resumed. Residing in the immediate vicinity, Sir Rutherford\r\nwas able to devote a large share of his time to the affairs of Westminster\r\nHospital, giving back with interest what he had received from his nursing\r\nmother. He was a regular visitor there: before long he joined the Board,\r\nand became a prominent figure at its meetings. Being appointed one of the\r\nvice-presidents, an office he held till his death, he was, through his\r\nconstant attendance, the working chairman of the board. There was much\r\ngood work waiting to be done in the control and direction of the routine\r\nservice of the establishment, and still more in the way of improvements\r\nrequired to adapt the machine to the needs of the time. Hospitals in\r\ngeneral were by no means in a satisfactory condition thirty years ago,\r\nand the Westminster was certainly no better than its neighbours. The\r\nsanitary state of the establishment was antiquated and unfavourable to\r\nthe patients. But the structural changes necessary to improve this and to\r\nextend the accommodation, and the heavy expenditure involved, demanded\r\nfirst-rate financial and organising capacity, as well as unremitting\r\nlabour,--desiderata which Sir Rutherford was eminently qualified to\r\nsupply. The nursing was at such a low level as amounted almost to a\r\nscandal. Drastic remedies, in short, and in many directions, were called\r\nfor. But reform from within is proverbially an unpromising undertaking,\r\nthe _personnel_ being identified with conservative traditions. That kind\r\nof parsimony which is in effect the worst extravagance, inasmuch as it\r\nyields no adequate return, was a serious obstacle to improvement. It was\r\nnot their fault, but that of the system of which they were but creatures,\r\nthat nurses and other attendants were so perfunctory and so inefficient.\r\nIt was the system, therefore, that had to be reformed, and into that work\r\nSir Rutherford Alcock threw himself _con amore_. In his labours for the\r\nimprovement of the hospital he was supported throughout by the cordial\r\nco-operation of the late Lady Augusta Stanley. We are indebted to his\r\ncolleague, Mr George Cowell, F.R.C.S., for a short reference to the work\r\ninitiated and carried through by Sir Rutherford Alcock, and for a warm\r\ntribute to the zeal and ability which he brought into the service:--\r\n\r\n    Most of the many valuable reports on such subjects as the nursing,\r\n    admission of out-patients, structural alterations, and improved\r\n    sanitation were written by him, and endorsed by the committees\r\n    over which he so ably presided. The writer of this notice\r\n    remembers the early controversies with reference to the nursing,\r\n    and the growing complaints which failed to receive attention until\r\n    Sir Rutherford came on the scene. Hospital committees in those\r\n    days were not so liberal as they are now, and all increase in\r\n    the wages of the nurses was absolutely refused for many years.\r\n    The result of this parsimony was that as the general rate of\r\n    wages increased, the best nurses were enticed away by better pay\r\n    elsewhere, and Westminster had gradually come to be nursed by a\r\n    lower and lower class, and indeed thirty years ago it was not an\r\n    unheard-of thing to convict a nurse for consuming brandy ordered\r\n    for the patient. The medical staff were obliged to make a stand\r\n    against this crying evil, and at last, with the assistance of Sir\r\n    Rutherford, and in spite of the determined opposition of the then\r\n    senior physician, a change was made, and the cost of the nursing\r\n    was doubled at a bound.\r\n\r\nSir Rutherford was chairman of the Westminster Ophthalmic Hospital for\r\nsixteen years, and of the Hospital for Women in Soho Square, to both\r\nof which institutions he rendered great services. He was member of the\r\nCouncil of the House of Charity for assisting those who have seen better\r\ndays, and chairman of the Nursing Home founded by Lady Augusta Stanley,\r\nin which he took a keen interest. He was also a Poor Law Guardian and\r\na leader in sundry charitable and other parochial work, his experiences\r\nof which he likened to the steps of a dancing-master--\"two forward and\r\none backward, with no very sensible advance in any one direction.\" One\r\nimportant step forward he did, however, succeed in making, and that was\r\nin obtaining trained nurses for sick inmates of workhouses. His efforts,\r\nwhile connected with St George's Union, were specially devoted to the\r\ntreatment of the sick: he also took a great interest in the emigration of\r\npauper children to Canada.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the committee of the Charity Organisation Society he\r\nlaboured for many years in a variety of ways to bring about unity of\r\naction between that body and the Board of Guardians. In connection with\r\nthe Westminster District Board of Works, Board of Parochial Trustees,\r\nWestern Dispensary, and Westminster Nursing Committee, he rendered\r\ninnumerable services to the populous districts controlled by these\r\norganisations. Having been elected to the Board of Works in 1875, Sir\r\nRutherford was at once placed upon the Sanitary Committee, to which the\r\nBoard delegated the administration of the Public Health Acts then in\r\nforce. The vestry clerk of St Margaret's and St John's records that the\r\nSanitary Committee of the District Board of Works was Sir Rutherford's\r\nfavourite field of work--an impression which was no doubt also formed by\r\nthe executive officers of the other spheres of his multifarious activity.\r\nThe members of the Board were at that time greatly occupied in combating\r\nthe evils resulting from the overcrowded and insanitary condition of\r\ntheir district, and Sir Rutherford was largely instrumental in urging\r\nupon the Home Office the necessity of legislation to compel medical\r\npractitioners and heads of families to give notice of cases of infectious\r\ndiseases--efforts which eventually resulted in the Act of Parliament of\r\n1889.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 he was appointed a member of the Royal Commission to investigate\r\nthe London smallpox and fever hospitals, to the formation of which he\r\nhad contributed powerfully by his reports and articles and labours in the\r\nMedical Conference. In 1882 he presided over the Health Department of the\r\nSocial Science Congress.\r\n\r\nIn all the social and philanthropic objects to which he devoted himself he\r\nwas an original worker, never a follower of routine or one to say ditto\r\nto another man's opinions. Whatever he undertook he did thoroughly, and\r\nwith a single eye to the main purpose. His various activities brought him\r\ninto contact with all sorts and conditions of men, but chiefly with those\r\non the pathetic side of social life--the unfortunate, the debilitated,\r\nthe improvident, the suffering. He shirked none of his obligations to the\r\nmeanest of these, and would suffer the greatest personal inconvenience\r\nrather than fail in fulfilment of the smallest promise, or in gratifying\r\nthe slightest request. This punctilious observance of the minor duties\r\nwas remarked as a prominent feature in his character. An intimate friend\r\nwrites, \"How I wish I could convey even a faint idea of his kindly and\r\nsympathetic friendship, which left the feeling that he was on a plane\r\nabove one in his lofty sense of love and duty.\" Pure philanthropy,\r\ngenuine economy, and sound finance being his guiding principles in all\r\nsocial undertakings, and whatever he undertook being pushed through to\r\na successful issue, he by degrees acquired a reputation for efficiency\r\nand tenacity. It was not surprising that his energetic character should\r\nhave gained him the credit of aggressiveness, or, as Mr Co well puts\r\nit, \"bellicose individuality,\" which, however, served him in good stead\r\nin every post he occupied. We have already seen throughout his official\r\ncareer how he was stimulated by controversy: he was at his best as a\r\nfighting man.\r\n\r\nThe high qualities which Sir Rutherford devoted to his labours of love\r\nreceived flattering recognition from the Queen, who applied to him to draw\r\nup the regulations and rules of the institution by which deserving nurses\r\nwere to be benefited in commemoration of her Majesty's Jubilee. This\r\nhonour he accepted from her Majesty on the condition that he should have\r\nfor colleagues in the work Sir James Paget and the Duke of Westminster, a\r\nrequest which was graciously granted. The balance of the Women's Jubilee\r\noffering of 1887 was £70,000, of which fund the three were appointed\r\ntrustees. They decided that it should be applied to the foundation of\r\nan institution to promote the education and maintenance of nurses for\r\nthe sick poor in their own homes. When the scheme had been matured a\r\nroyal charter of incorporation was granted, wherein the governing body\r\nwas styled \"The Queen Victoria Jubilee Institute for Nurses,\" the three\r\ntrustees being appointed to act permanently in that capacity, and also as\r\nmembers of the Council of the Institute. \"Sir Rutherford,\" says the Rev.\r\nArthur Peile, Master of St Katharine's, \"continued to the last to take\r\nan unfailing interest in the work, and in many valuable ways aided the\r\ncommittee and council by his advice. From his wide grasp of the subject\r\nin its various bearings he was able to make important suggestions.\"\r\nThe Diamond Jubilee and the incidents connected with the celebration\r\ninterested Sir Rutherford greatly during the last year of his life, and\r\nthe medal he received on the occasion was valued by him more highly than\r\nany other distinction, because he knew that the bestowal of it was the\r\nspontaneous act of the Queen herself, for whom he had a deep personal\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nTo the larger public Sir Rutherford Alcock was perhaps best known by his\r\nwork in connection with the Royal Geographical Society, on the committee\r\nof which he served for twenty years. Elected President in 1876, it\r\nfell to him to receive Sir George Nares on his return from his Arctic\r\nexpedition in that year, and Mr H. M. Stanley on his return from the\r\nCongo in 1877. His various presidential addresses to the Society itself,\r\nand to the geographical section of the British Association, are replete\r\nwith well-digested summaries of the progress of geographical exploration\r\nthroughout the world. His comprehensive treatment of the subject assisted\r\nvery much, if not to make geography a science, at least to lift it out\r\nof the region of mere technical knowledge, and to assign to the study of\r\nit the social and political significance now universally attached to the\r\ndescription of the earth's surface. Personally he did much to stimulate\r\nenterprise of that kind in various regions. As Chairman of the African\r\nExploration Fund, he took an active share in the labours which resulted in\r\nthe despatch of Mr Keith Johnston and Mr Joseph Thomson to East Africa,\r\nand, by bringing the country into notice, had such important results in\r\nthe direction of the opening up of that part of the continent. Speaking\r\nof him a few days after his death, the President, Sir Clements Markham,\r\nsaid: \"Judicious, patient, and courteous, he was esteemed by us all,\r\nand his able advice helped us out of many a difficulty. The period of\r\nhis presidency will always be remembered for the energy with which he\r\nadvocated African exploration, the result of his efforts being represented\r\nby the memorable expeditions of Joseph Thomson.\"\r\n\r\nWe have already had occasion to remark on the personal interest which Sir\r\nRutherford had taken during the earlier years of his service in China and\r\nJapan in the London Exhibitions of 1851 and 1862.[40] Indeed the Japanese\r\n\"show\" in the latter was virtually organised by him. His well-known\r\nsympathy with, and interest in, all industrial and artistic collections\r\nled to his being chosen as British Commissioner to the Paris Exhibition\r\nof 1878.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time a question of imperial concern claimed Sir\r\nRutherford's active intervention: that was colonisation in the Eastern\r\nArchipelago. Borneo, the largest island in the world after Australia,\r\nhas from time to time excited considerable interest in Great Britain.\r\nThe romantic career of the Rajah of Sarawak, Sir James Brooke, on the\r\nwest coast, had much to do with bringing that part of the world into\r\npublic notice. Adopting as his country the domain made over to him by the\r\nnative chiefs, Rajah Brooke laboured among his people like a missionary\r\nof civilisation, trampled out the savage customs of the natives, and\r\nafter many trials gained the confidence of the people by his justice and\r\nfirmness, and eventually brought the country into a state of prosperity\r\nand good order. In this he was loyally seconded by Captain Keppel, now\r\nAdmiral of the Fleet, whose 'Expedition to Borneo of H.M.S. Dido' is a\r\ngraphic story of their joint adventures among pirates and head-hunters.\r\nCoal having been found in Labuan, adjoining the Rajah's territory, that\r\nisland was acquired by Great Britain in 1847, under treaty from the Sultan\r\nof Brunei, who engaged not to make any cession of his territory without\r\nher Majesty's consent, and established as a Crown colony.\r\n\r\nThe Netherlands and Spain claimed between them, upon a vague tenure,\r\nenormous tracts of the coast of Borneo and the adjoining archipelago,\r\neffectually blocking all progress in these regions. There still remained,\r\nhowever, an important section of the northern part of that immense island\r\nunappropriated by the white man. Portions of this tract had been leased\r\nto an American citizen, who transferred it to an American company; but\r\nbeing unable to furnish the capital either to pay the stipulated rent\r\nor to develop so enormous a property, in 1877 the holders were glad\r\nto part with all their rights to an English association consisting of\r\nBaron von Overbeck and Mr (now Sir) Alfred Dent, who undertook to pay\r\nthe agreed tribute to the Sultans of Borneo and Sooloo. Possessing this\r\nimmense estate, with the sovereign rights inherent in the proprietor, the\r\nEnglish association made arrangements to develop the property. Agents\r\nwere sent out to occupy certain points on the coast, and a provisional\r\ngovernment, suited to the requirements of the place, was set up. But the\r\nadministration putting too heavy a strain upon a private individual, Mr\r\nDent set to work to find assistance in his undertaking.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, 1879, Sir Rutherford Alcock, impressed by the important\r\nstrategical position of the island of Borneo, lying close to the track of\r\nvessels traversing the China Sea, its possession of several good harbours,\r\nand prospective coal supply, joined Mr Dent in his efforts to place the\r\nBritish occupation of the Bornean harbours on a secure basis. As a first\r\nstep it was necessary to organise a company with sufficient capital to\r\ntake over the government and utilise the resources of the territory. This\r\nmay well have seemed at the time not only an arduous but an impossible\r\nundertaking; for nothing short of a royal charter could supply the\r\nnecessary guarantee to attract capitalists, and to assure them that their\r\nproperty investment would eventually be productive. The era had long gone\r\npast when royal charters were granted to merchant adventurers. Such an\r\ninstitution, therefore, seemed an anachronism, opposed to the spirit of\r\nthe age. Nor was the political colour of the British Government at the\r\ntime encouraging to imperial schemes of any description. In spite of these\r\ndifficulties the knowledge of affairs and insistency of Sir Rutherford\r\nAlcock and the other promoters enabled them eventually to succeed in\r\npushing their enterprise with the Government to the point of obtaining a\r\ncharter of incorporation in November 1881. On the faith of this charter a\r\ncompany was formed, of which the capital now stands at £2,000,000, under\r\nthe title of the \"British North Borneo Company.\" Sir Rutherford Alcock\r\nbecame the chairman, which post he continued to fill during the ten\r\nyears which may be considered the probationary stage of the company. To\r\nhim it owed much of its success in overcoming the numerous difficulties\r\nincidental to starting so novel a venture; and among his other labours in\r\nits behalf he drew up a full and elaborate handbook of North Borneo. It\r\nwas not a trading, but a governing and a land-owning company, its revenues\r\nconsisting of royalties paid by private adventurers for the privileges\r\nof mining, agriculture, and so forth, licences and the necessary taxes\r\non commerce. But the interests of a dividend-earning and a governing\r\ncompany were so nearly incompatible that no little ingenuity as well as\r\npatient effort were required to bring about reconciliation between the\r\ntwo elements.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the company have been conducted with great perseverance,\r\nthe exploitation of the territory by means of planting, mining, and\r\nindustries of various kinds having been handed over to subsidiary\r\ncompanies created for the purpose, while the parent body maintains its\r\nposition as overlord, administering the whole territory.\r\n\r\nBut amidst his numerous preoccupations in England Sir Rutherford never\r\nloosened his grasp on the events which were transpiring in the distant\r\nfield to which his official life had been devoted. As the only competent\r\nand persistent critic of these events, he did as much as one man could to\r\nturn the eyes of his countrymen towards their most important interests\r\nin Further Asia. Nearly every passing event was noticed briefly by\r\nhim in the columns of the daily press, while the permanent features of\r\nthe Far Eastern problem, which are only now beginning to dawn upon the\r\nconsciousness of the nation, were copiously dealt with in the monthly\r\nmagazines and in the more stately pages of the 'Edinburgh Review.' Sir\r\nRutherford's contributions to periodical literature, forming a tolerably\r\ncomplete repertory of the questions arising out of the intercourse of\r\nEurope with Eastern Asia, would fill many volumes. As late as 1896 the\r\nsubject was still uppermost in his mind. \"In China,\" he then wrote,\r\n\"there is a far larger Eastern question than what is occupying us at\r\nConstantinople. An open port for Russia, a railroad across Russia, with\r\nthe French scheming for our commerce in the Indo-Chinese peninsula,--the\r\nwhole situation is full of danger to all our interests in China.\" And\r\nduring the last year of his life the thought of all that had been lost\r\nto the country through sheer neglect seemed to weigh heavily on his\r\nmind. That his constant premonitions of coming changes passed practically\r\nunheeded by the public to whom they were addressed is unfortunately true;\r\nand it is trite to say that it would have been well for this country\r\nif the warnings of such serious writers as this had been taken to heart\r\nbefore instead of after the deluge. But that would have been a historical\r\nanomaly, for mankind has learned little since the days of Noah.\r\n\r\nUnder the valid plea of advancing age and failing health Sir Rutherford\r\nduring his last years relinquished one after another the offices which\r\nhe had filled with so much earnestness and good faith. Deafness alone\r\nobliged him to retire from the active chairmanship of the Westminster\r\nHospital, though his attendances at the weekly meetings of the Board\r\nwere unremitting to the very end. As late as July 1897 he took a leading\r\npart in measures he deemed urgent for the wellbeing of the institution.\r\nDuring the Jubilee celebrations he was able to receive a formal visit\r\nfrom a party of twelve Dyak police from British North Borneo, under the\r\ncommand of Mr Wardrop. The Committee of the Jubilee Nurses continued to\r\nmeet at his house, and he did work for the institution during the summer.\r\nWhile at Wimbledon with his family in August, he was seized by an illness\r\nfrom which he rallied sufficiently to be brought home to his house at\r\nWestminster, where he came under the medical care of his old friend and\r\nphysician, Dr Lionel Beale. Among the few friends who were admitted to see\r\nhim during the last month of his life were the Dean of Westminster, Lord\r\nLister, Mr Edmund Bagshawe of Bath, and one or two others. His strength\r\nwas then gradually failing, though he retained his intellect unimpaired\r\ntill within a few days of the end, on November 2, 1897. He was buried in\r\nMerstham churchyard. His widow, nearly his own age, survived him sixteen\r\nmonths, dying in March 1899. How much the maintenance of the husband's\r\nlong life of active usefulness owed to the support and encouragement of\r\na judicious and devoted wife must remain behind the veil. She had her\r\nreward.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MAP OF EASTERN ASIA\r\n   TO ILLUSTRATE\r\n   THE ENGLISHMAN IN CHINA IN THE VICTORIAN ERA\r\n   BY ALEXANDER MICHIE]\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting in conclusion to add a few words of Sir Rutherford\r\nAlcock's estimate of himself, which occur in a letter to the friend who\r\nhad pressed him on the subject of biography, written within a year of his\r\ndeath. \"In worldly things,\" he said, \"I have been exceptionally favoured\r\nby opportunities, many of them unanticipated, and rather fortuitous than\r\nby any efforts or merits. My early life was marked by a great rashness,\r\nand a readiness to accept responsibilities which savoured much of\r\npresumption and confidence from conceit in my powers to deal with whatever\r\nfell in my way--very different from my retrospect in old age and the\r\nsobered estimate my judgment is now disposed to form of all I undertook\r\nand accomplished, and the risks I accepted, through my fifty years of\r\nactive life.\"\r\n\r\nIf, however, age be the season appropriate for judgment, youth is the time\r\nfor laying up the materials for it; and he who takes no risks achieves\r\nnothing worthy of being judged. We estimate the man by his record rather\r\nthan by his own review of it, falling back on the criterion, valid in all\r\ncircumstances, \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n
