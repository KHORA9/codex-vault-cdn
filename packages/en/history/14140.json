Timæus was probably led to write this sort of nonsense by the\r\nsame critical literary spirit which led him to correct the style of\r\nPhilistius, and to find fault with that of Aristotle and Plato. My own\r\nopinion is that to pay too much attention to mere style and to\r\nendeavour to surpass that of other writers, is both trifling and\r\npedantic, while any attempt to reproduce that of the unapproachable\r\nmasterpieces of antiquity springs from a want of power to appreciate\r\ntheir real value. With regard, then, to the actions of Nikias\r\ndescribed by Thucydides and Philistius, more especially those which\r\nillustrate his true character, having been performed under the stress\r\nof terrible disasters, I shall briefly recapitulate them, lest I be\r\nthought a careless biographer, adding to them whatever scattered\r\nnotices I have been able to collect from the writings of other\r\nhistorians and from public documents and inscriptions; and of these\r\nlatter I shall quote only those which enable us to judge what manner\r\nof man he was.\r\n\r\nII. The first thing to be noted in describing Nikias is the saying of\r\nAristotle, that there had been in Athens three citizens of great\r\nability and patriotism, namely, Nikias, the son of Nikeratus,\r\nThucydides, the son of Melesias, and Theramenes, the son of Hagnon;\r\nthough the latter was not equal to the two former, but was reproached\r\nwith being a foreigner from the island of Keos; and, also, because he\r\nwas not a stable politician but always inclined to change sides, he\r\nwas nicknamed Kothornos, which means a large boot which will fit\r\neither leg. Of these three statesmen the eldest was Thucydides, who\r\nwas the leader of the conservative opposition to Perikles; while\r\nNikias, who was a younger man, rose to a certain eminence during the\r\nlife of Perikles, as he acted as his colleague in the command of a\r\nmilitary force, and also filled the office of archon. On the death of\r\nPerikles, Nikias at once became the foremost man in Athens, chiefly by\r\nthe favour of the rich and noble, who wished to make use of him to\r\ncheck the plebeian insolence of Kleon; yet Nikias had the good-will\r\nof the common people, and they were eager to further his interests.\r\nKleon, indeed, became very powerful by caressing the people and giving\r\nthem opportunities for earning money from the State, but in spite of\r\nthis, many of the lower classes whose favour he especially strove to\r\nobtain, became disgusted with, his greed and insolence, and preferred\r\nto attach themselves to Nikias. Indeed, there was nothing harsh or\r\noverbearing in the pride of Nikias, which arose chiefly from his fear\r\nof being thought to be currying favour with the people. By nature he\r\nwas downhearted and prone to despair, but in war these qualities were\r\nconcealed by his invariable success in whatever enterprise he\r\nundertook; while in political life his retiring manner and his dread\r\nof the vulgar demagogues, by whom he was easily put out of\r\ncountenance, added to his popularity; for the people fear those who\r\ntreat them with haughtiness, and favour those who respect and fear\r\nthem. The reason of this is that the greatest honour which the\r\npopulace can receive from a great man is not to be treated with\r\ncontempt by him.\r\n\r\nIII. Perikles, indeed, used to govern Athens by sheer force of\r\ncharacter and eloquence, and required no tricks of manner or plausible\r\nspeeches to gain him credit with the populace; but Nikias had no\r\nnatural gifts of this sort, and owed his position merely to his\r\nwealth. As he could not vie with Kleon in the versatile and humorous\r\npower of speech by which the latter swayed the Athenian masses, he\r\nendeavoured to gain the favour of the people by supplying choruses for\r\nthe public dramatic performances and instituting athletic sports on a\r\nscale of lavish expenditure which never before had been equalled by\r\nany citizen. The statue of Pallas, erected by him in the Acropolis, is\r\nstanding at this day, although it has lost the gold with which it was\r\nformerly adorned, and also the building which supports the choragic\r\ntripods in the temple of Dionysus, for he often gained a victory when\r\nchoragus, and never was vanquished.\r\n\r\nIt is said that once during the performance of a play at his expense,\r\na slave of his appeared upon the stage habited as Dionysus; a tall and\r\nhandsome youth, and still beardless. The Athenians were charmed with\r\nhis appearance, and applauded for a long time, at the end of which\r\nNikias rose and said that he did not think it right that one whose\r\nbody was thus consecrated to a god should be a slave; and consequently\r\nhe gave him his freedom. Tradition also tells us how magnificently and\r\ndecorously he arranged the procession at Delos. In former times the\r\nchoruses sent by the cities of Ionia to sing to the glory of the god\r\nused to sail up to the island in a disorderly fashion, and were at\r\nonce met by a rude mob, who called upon, them to sing, so that they\r\ndisembarked in a hurry, huddling on their garlands and robes with\r\nunseemly haste and confusion. Nikias disembarked with his chorus upon\r\nthe little island of Rhenea close by, with all their vestments and\r\nholy things, and then during the night bridged the strait--which is\r\nvery narrow--with a bridge of boats which he had had made at Athens\r\nexpressly, which was beautifully ornamented with gilding and rich\r\ntapestry. Next morning at daybreak, he led the procession to the god\r\nover this bridge, with his chorus very richly dressed, and singing as\r\nthey passed over the strait. After the sacrifice, the public games,\r\nand the banquet, he set up the brazen palm-tree as an offering to the\r\ngod, and also set apart an estate which he had bought for ten thousand\r\ndrachmas, as sacred to the god. With the revenues of this land the\r\npeople of Delos were to offer sacrifice and to provide themselves with\r\na feast, and were to pray the gods to bestow blessings on Nikias. All\r\nthese injunctions to the people of Delos were inscribed upon a pillar\r\nwhich he left there to guard his bequest. The palm-tree was afterwards\r\noverturned by a high wind, and in its fall destroyed the great statue\r\nwhich had been set up by the people of Naxos.\r\n\r\nIV. These acts of Nikias may have been prompted by ambition and desire\r\nfor display, but when viewed in connection with his superstitious\r\ncharacter they seem more probably to have been the outcome of his\r\ndevotional feelings; for we are told by Thucydides that he was one who\r\nstood greatly in awe of the gods, and was wholly devoted to religion.\r\nIn one of the dialogues of Pasiphon, we read that he offered sacrifice\r\ndaily, and that he kept a soothsayer in his house, whom he pretended\r\nto consult upon affairs of state, but really sought his advice about\r\nhis own private concerns, especially about his silver mines. He had\r\nextensive mines at Laurium, the working of which afforded him very\r\nlarge profits, but yet was attended with great risks. He maintained a\r\nlarge body of slaves at the works; and most of his property consisted\r\nof the silver produced by them. For this reason he was surrounded by\r\nhangers-on, and persons who endeavoured to obtain a share of his\r\nwealth, and he gave money to all alike, both to those who might do him\r\nharm, and to those who really deserved his liberality, for he gave to\r\nbad men through fear, and to good men through good nature. We may find\r\nproof of this in the writings of the comic poets. Telekleides,\r\nspeaking of some informer, says:\r\n\r\n    \"Charikles a mina gave him, fearing he might say\r\n    Charikles himself was born in a suspicious way;\r\n    And Nikias five minas gave. Now, what his reasons were\r\n    I know full well, but will not tell, for he's a trusty fere.\"\r\n\r\nEupolis, too, in his comedy of Marikas has a scene where an informer\r\nmeets with a poor man who is no politician, and says:\r\n\r\n    \"A. Say where you last with Nikias did meet.\r\n    B. Never. Save once I saw him in the street.\r\n    A. He owns he saw him. Wherefore should he say\r\n    He saw him, if he meant not to betray\r\n    His crimes?\r\n    C.          My friends, you all perceive the fact,\r\n    That Nikias is taken in the act.\r\n    B. Think you, O fools, that such a man as he\r\n    In any wicked act would taken be.\"\r\n\r\nJust so does Kleon threaten him in Aristophanes's play:\r\n\r\n     \"The orators I'll silence, and make Nikias afraid.\"\r\n\r\nPhrynichus, too, sneers at his cowardice and fear of the popular\r\ndemagogues, when he says:\r\n\r\n    \"An honest citizen indeed he was,\r\n    And not a coward like to Nikias.\"\r\n\r\nV. Nikias feared so much to give the mob orators grounds for\r\naccusation against him, that he dared not so much as dine with his\r\nfollow citizens, and pass his time in their society. Nor did he have\r\nany leisure at all for such amusements, but when general, he used to\r\nspend the whole day in the War office, and when the Senate met he\r\nwould be the first to come to the house and the last to leave it. When\r\nthere was no public business to be transacted, he was hard to meet\r\nwith, as he shut himself up in his house and seldom stirred abroad.\r\nHis friends used to tell those who came to his door that they must\r\npardon him for not receiving them, as he was not at leisure, being\r\nengaged on public business of great importance. One Hieron, whom he\r\nhad brought up in his house and educated, assisted him greatly in\r\nthrowing this air of mystery and haughty exclusiveness over his life.\r\nThis man gave out that he was the son of Dionysius, called Chalkus,\r\nwhose poems are still extant, and who was the leader of the expedition\r\nto Italy to found the city of Thurii. Hiero used to keep Nikias\r\nsupplied with prophetic responses from the soothsayers, and gave out\r\nto the Athenians that Nikias was toiling night and day on their\r\nbehalf, saying that when he was in his bath or at his dinner he was\r\nconstantly being interrupted by some important public business or\r\nother, so that, said he, \"His night's rest is broken by his labours,\r\nand his private affairs are neglected through his devotion to those of\r\nthe public. He has injured his health, and besides losing his fortune,\r\nhas been deserted by many of his friends on account of his not being\r\nable to entertain them and make himself agreeable to them; while other\r\nmen find in politics a means of obtaining both friends and fortune, at\r\nthe expense of the state.\" In very truth the life of Nikias was such\r\nthat he might well apply to himself the words of Agamemnon.\r\n\r\n    \"In outward show and stately pomp all others I exceed,\r\n    And yet the people's underling I am in very deed.\"\r\n\r\nVI. Perceiving that the Athenian people were willing enough to make\r\nuse of the talents of men of ability, and yet ever viewed them with\r\nsuspicion and checked them when in full career, as we may learn from\r\ntheir condemnation of Perikles, their banishment of Damon by\r\nostracism, and their mistrust of Antiphon the Rhamnusian, and\r\nespecially in their treatment of Paches the conqueror of Lesbos, who\r\nwhile his conduct as general was being enquired into, stabbed himself\r\nin the open court--perceiving this, Nikias always avoided, as far as\r\nhe could, taking the command in any important military expedition.\r\nWhenever he was employed as general, he acted with extreme caution,\r\nand was usually successful. He was careful to attribute his success,\r\nnot to any skill or courage of his own, but to fortune, being willing\r\nto lessen his glory to avoid the ill-will of mankind. His good fortune\r\nwas indeed shown in many remarkable instances: for example, he never\r\nwas present at any of the great defeats sustained by the Athenians at\r\nthat time, as in Thrace they were defeated by the Greeks of\r\nChalkidike, but on that occasion Kalliades and Xenophon were acting as\r\ngenerals, while the defeat in Ætolia took place when Demosthenes was\r\nin command, and at Delium, where a thousand men were slain, they were\r\nled by Hippokrates. For the pestilence Perikles was chiefly blamed,\r\nbecause he shut up the country people in the city, where the change of\r\nhabits and unusual diet produced disease among them. In all these\r\ndisasters Nikias alone escaped censure: while he achieved several\r\nmilitary successes, such as the capture of Kythera, an island\r\nconveniently situated off the coast of Laconia, and inhabited by\r\nsettlers from that country. He also captured several of the revolted\r\ncities in Thrace, and induced others to return to their allegiance. He\r\nshut up the people of Megara in their city, and thereby at once made\r\nhimself master of the island of Minoa, by means of which he shortly\r\nafterwards captured the port of Nisæa, while he also landed his troops\r\nin the Corinthian territory, and beat a Corinthian army which marched\r\nagainst him, killing many of them, and amongst others Lykophron their\r\ngeneral. On this occasion he accidentally neglected to bury the\r\ncorpses of two of his own men who had fallen. As soon as he discovered\r\nthis omission, he at once halted his army, and sent a herald to the\r\nenemy to demand the bodies for burial, notwithstanding that by Greek\r\ncustom the party which after a battle demand a truce for the burial of\r\nthe dead, are understood thereby to admit that they have been\r\ndefeated, and it is not thought light for them to erect a trophy in\r\ncommemoration of their victory; for the victors remain in possession\r\nof the field of battle, and of the bodies of the dead, and the\r\nvanquished ask for their dead because they are not able to come and\r\ntake them. Nevertheless, Nikias thought it right to forego all the\r\ncredit of his victory rather than leave two of his countrymen\r\nunburied. He also laid waste the seaboard of Laconia, defeated a\r\nLacedæmonian force which opposed him,and took Thyrea, which was\r\ngarrisoned by Æginetans, whom he brought prisoners to Athens.\r\n\r\nVII. Now when Demosthenes threw up a fortification at Pylos, and after\r\nthe Peloponnesians had attacked him by sea and by land, some four\r\nhundred Spartans were left on the island of Sphakteria, the Athenians\r\nthought that it was a matter of great importance, as indeed it was, to\r\ntake them prisoners. Yet, as it proved laborious and difficult to\r\nblockade them on the island, because the place was desert and\r\nwaterless, so that provisions had to be brought from a great distance\r\nby sea, which was troublesome enough in summer, and would be quite\r\nimpossible in winter, they began to be weary of the enterprise, and\r\nwere sorry that they had rejected the proposals for peace which had\r\nshortly before been made by the Tasmanians. These proposals were\r\nrejected chiefly because Kleon opposed them. Kleon's opposition was\r\ndue to his personal dislike to Nikias; and when he saw him\r\nenthusiastically exerting himself on behalf of the Lacedæmonians, he\r\nat once took the other side, and persuaded the people to reject the\r\nproffered peace. Now as the blockade dragged on for a long time, and\r\nthe Athenians learned to what straits their army was reduced, they\r\nbecame angry with Kleon. He threw the blame upon Nikias, asserting\r\nthat it was through his remissness and want of enterprise that the\r\nSpartans still held out, and declaring that, were he himself in chief\r\ncommand they would soon be captured. Upon this the Athenians turned\r\nround upon him and said, \"Why, then, do not you yourself proceed\r\nthither and capture them?\" Nikias at once offered to transfer his\r\ncommand to Kleon, and bade him take what troops he thought necessary,\r\nand, instead of swaggering at home where there was no danger, go and\r\nperform some notable service to the state. At first Kleon was\r\nconfused by this unexpected turn of the debate, and declined the\r\ncommand; but as the Athenians insisted upon it, and Nikias urged him\r\nto do so, he plucked up spirit, accepted the office of general, and\r\neven went so far as to pledge himself within twenty days either to\r\nkill the Spartans on the island or to bring them prisoners to Athens.\r\nThe Athenians were more inclined to laugh at this boast than to\r\nbelieve it; for they were well acquainted with the vainglorious\r\ncharacter of the man, and had often amused themselves at his expense.\r\nIt is said that once the public assembly met early and sat for a long\r\ntime waiting for Kleon, who came at last very late with a garland on\r\nhis head, and begged them to put off their debate till the next day.\r\n\"To-day,\" said he, \"I am not at leisure, as I have just offered a\r\nsacrifice, and am about to entertain some strangers at dinner.\" The\r\nAthenians laughed at his assurance, and broke up the assembly.\r\n\r\nVIII. However, on this occasion, by good fortune and good generalship,\r\nwith the help of Demosthenes, he brought home prisoners all those\r\nSpartans who had not fallen in the battle, within the time which he\r\nhad appointed. This was a great reproach to Nikias. It seemed worse\r\neven than losing his shield in battle that he should through sheer\r\ncowardice and fear of failure give up his office of general, and give\r\nhis personal enemy such an opportunity of exalting himself at his\r\nexpense, depriving himself voluntarily of his honourable charge.\r\nAristophanes sneers at him in his play of the 'Birds,' where he says:\r\n\r\n    \"We must not now, like Nikias, delay,\r\n    And see the time for action pass away.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again in the play of the 'Farmers,' where this dialogue occurs:\r\n\r\n    \"A. I want to till my farm.\r\n     B.           And wherefore no?\r\n     A. 'Tis you Athenians will not let me go;\r\n        A thousand drachmas I would give, to be\r\n        From office in the state for ever free.\r\n     B. Your offer we accept. The state will have\r\n        Two thousand, with what Nikias just gave.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, Nikias did Athens much harm by permitting Kleon to attain\r\nto such a height of power and reputation, which gave him such\r\nexaggerated confidence in himself that he grew quite unmanageable, and\r\ncaused many terrible disasters, by which Nikias suffered as much as\r\nany man. Kleon also was the first to break through the decorum\r\nobserved by former public speakers, by shouting, throwing back his\r\ncloak, slapping his thigh, and walking up and down while speaking,\r\nwhich led to the total disregard of decency and good manners among\r\npublic speakers, and eventually was the ruin of the state.\r\n\r\nIX. About this time Alkibiades began to gain credit in Athens as a\r\npublic speaker, less licentious than Kleon, and like the soil of Egypt\r\ndescribed by Homer, which bears\r\n\r\n     \"A mingled crop of good and bad alike.\"\r\n\r\nThus Alkibiades, with immense powers both for good and evil, produced\r\ngreat changes in the affairs of Athens. Nikias, even if he had been\r\nfreed from the opposition of Kleon, could not now have quietly\r\nconsolidated the power of the state, for as soon as he had arranged\r\nmatters in a fair way to produce peace and quiet, Alkibiades, to\r\nsatisfy his own furious ambition, threw them again into confusion and\r\nwar. This was brought about by the following circumstances. The two\r\nchief hindrances to peace were Kleon and Brasidas; as war concealed\r\nthe baseness of the former, and added to the glory of the latter.\r\nKleon was able to commit many crimes undetected, and Brasidas\r\nperformed many great exploits while the war lasted; wherefore, when\r\nboth of these men fell before the walls of Amphipolis, Nikias,\r\nperceiving that the Spartans had long been desirous of peace, and that\r\nthe Athenians no longer hoped to gain anything by continuing the war,\r\nand that both parties were weary of it, began to consider how he might\r\nreconcile them, and also pacify all the other states of Greece, so as\r\nto establish peace upon a durable and prosperous basis. At Athens, the\r\nricher classes, the older men, and the country farmers all wished for\r\npeace. By constantly arguing with the others he gradually made them\r\nless eager for war, and at length was able to intimate to the Spartans\r\nthat there were good hopes of coming to terms. They willingly believed\r\nhim because of his high character for probity, and more especially\r\nbecause he had shown great kindness to the Spartan prisoners taken at\r\nPylos. A truce for one year had already been arranged between them,\r\nand during this they conversed freely with one another, and, enjoying\r\na life of leisure and freedom from the restraints and alarms of war,\r\nbegan to long for an unbroken period of peace, and to sing:\r\n\r\n     \"My spear the spider's home shall be,\"\r\n\r\nremembering with pleasure the proverb that in time of peace men are\r\nawakened, not by trumpets, but by crowing cocks. They railed at those\r\nwho said that it was fated that the war should last thrice nine years,\r\nand, having thus accustomed themselves to discuss the whole question,\r\nthey proceeded to make peace, and thought that now they were indeed\r\nfree from all their troubles. The name of Nikias was now in every\r\nman's mouth, and he was called the favourite of heaven, and the man\r\nchosen by the gods for his piety to confer the greatest of blessings\r\nupon the Greeks. For they regarded the peace as the work of Nikias,\r\njust as the war had been the work of Perikles. The latter, they\r\nthought, for no adequate reasons, had involved the Greeks in the\r\ngreatest miseries, while the former had relieved them of their\r\ntroubles by persuading them to become friends. For this reason this\r\npeace is to this day called the peace of Nikias.\r\n\r\nX. The terms of the peace were that each party should restore the\r\ncities and territory which it had taken, and that it should be\r\ndetermined by lot which side should restore its conquests first. We\r\nare told by Theophrastus that Nikias, by means of bribery, arranged\r\nthat the lot should fall upon the Lacedæmonians to make restitution\r\nfirst. When, however, the Corinthians and Bœotians, dissatisfied with\r\nthe whole transaction, seemed likely by their complaints and menaces\r\nto rekindle the war, Nikias induced Athens and Sparta to confirm the\r\npeace by entering upon an alliance, which enabled them to deal with\r\nthe malcontents with more authority, and give them more confidence in\r\none another.\r\n\r\nAll these transactions greatly displeased Alkibiades, who was\r\nnaturally disinclined to peace, and who hated the Lacedæmonians\r\nbecause they paid their court to Nikias and disregarded him. For this\r\nreason, Alkibiades from the very outset opposed the peace, but\r\nineffectually at first. When, however, he observed that the\r\nLacedæmonians were no longer regarded with favour by the Athenians,\r\nand were thought to have wronged them by forming an alliance with the\r\nBœotians, and not restoring to Athens up the cities of Panaktus and\r\nAmphipolis, he seized the opportunity of exciting the people by\r\nexaggerated accounts of the misdeeds of the Lacedæmonians. Moreover he\r\nprevailed upon the people of Argos to send ambassadors to Athens to\r\nconclude an alliance. As, however, at the same time ambassadors, with\r\nfull powers to settle all matters in dispute, came from Lacedæmon, and\r\nin a preliminary conference with the Senate were thought to have made\r\nvery reasonable and just proposals, Alkibiades, fearing that they\r\nmight create an equally favourable impression when they spoke before\r\nthe popular assembly, deceived them by solemnly declaring with an oath\r\nthat he would assist them in every way that he could, provided that\r\nthey would deny that they came with full powers to decide, saying that\r\nby this means alone they would effect their purpose. The ambassadors\r\nwere deceived by his protestations, and, forsaking Nikias, relied\r\nentirely upon him. Upon this Alkibiades brought them into the public\r\nassembly, and there asked them if they came with full powers to treat.\r\nWhen they said that they did not, he unexpectedly turned round upon\r\nthem, and calling both the Senate and the people to witness their\r\nwords, urged them to pay no attention to men who were such evident\r\nliars, and who said one thing in one+ assembly and the opposite in\r\nanother. The ambassadors, as Alkibiades expected, were thunderstruck,\r\nand Nikias could say nothing on their behalf. The people at once\r\ncalled for the ambassadors from Argos to be brought before them, in\r\norder to contract an alliance with that city, but an earthquake which\r\nwas felt at this moment greatly served Nikias's purpose by causing\r\nthe assembly to break up. With great difficulty, when the debate was\r\nresumed on the following day, he prevailed upon the people to break\r\noff the negotiations with Argos, and to send him as ambassador to\r\nSparta, promising that he would bring matters to a prosperous issue.\r\nAccordingly he proceeded to Sparta, where he was treated with great\r\nrespect as a man of eminence and a friend of the Lacedæmonians, but\r\ncould effect nothing because of the preponderance of the party which\r\ninclined to the Bœotian alliance. He was therefore forced to return\r\ningloriously, in great fear of the anger of the Athenians, who had\r\nbeen persuaded by him to deliver up so many and such important\r\nprisoners to the Lacedæmonians without receiving any equivalent. For\r\nthe prisoners taken at Pylos were men of the first families in Sparta,\r\nand related to the most powerful statesmen there. The Athenians,\r\nhowever, did not show their dissatisfaction with Nikias by any harsh\r\nmeasures, but they elected Alkibiades general, and they entered into a\r\ntreaty of alliance with the Argives, and also with the states of Elis\r\nand Mantinea, which had revolted from the Lacedæmonians, while they\r\nsent out privateers to Pylos to plunder the Lacedæmonian coasts in the\r\nneighbourhood of that fortress. These measures soon produced a renewal\r\nof the war.\r\n\r\nXI. As the quarrel between Nikias and Alkibiades had now reached such\r\na pitch, it was decided that the remedy of ostracism must be applied\r\nto them. By this from time to time the people of Athens were wont to\r\nbanish for ten years any citizen whose renown or wealth rendered him\r\ndangerous to the state. Great excitement was caused by this measure,\r\nas one or the other must be utterly ruined by its application. The\r\nAthenians were disgusted by the licentiousness of Alkibiades, and\r\nfeared his reckless daring, as has been explained at greater length in\r\nhis Life, while Nikias was disliked because of his great wealth and\r\nhis reserved and unpopular mode of life. Moreover he had frequently\r\noffended the people by acting in direct opposition to their wishes,\r\nforcing them in spite of themselves to do what was best for them. On\r\nthe one side were arrayed the young men and those who wished for war,\r\nand on the other the older men and the party of peace, who would be\r\nsure to vote respectively, one for the banishment of Nikias, the other\r\nfor that of Alkibiades. Now\r\n\r\n     \"In revolutions bad men rise to fame,\"\r\n\r\nand it appears that the violence of these factions at Athens gave an\r\nopportunity for the lowest and basest citizens to gain reputation.\r\nAmongst these was one Hyperbolus, of the township of Peirithois, a man\r\nof no ability or power, but who owed his elevation to sheer audacity,\r\nand whose influence was felt to be a disgrace to Athens. This man, who\r\nnever dreamed that ostracism would be applied to him, as the pillory\r\nwould have been more suitable to his deserts, openly showed his\r\ndelight at the discord between Nikias and Alkibiades, and excited the\r\npeople to deal severely with them, because he hoped that if one of\r\nthem were to be banished, he might succeed to his place, and become a\r\nmatch for the one who was left behind. But the parties which supported\r\nNikias and Alkibiades respectively made a secret compact with one\r\nanother to suppress this villain, and so arranged matters that neither\r\nof their leaders, but Hyperbolus himself was banished by ostracism for\r\nten years. This transaction delighted and amused the people for the\r\nmoment, but they were afterwards grieved that they had abused this\r\nsafeguard of their constitution by applying it to an unworthy object,\r\nas there was a kind of dignity about the punishment which they had\r\ninflicted. Ostracism in the case of men like Thucydides and\r\nAristeides, was a punishment, but when applied to men like Hyperbolus,\r\nit became an honour and mark of distinction, as though his crimes had\r\nput him on a par with the leading spirits of the age. Plato, the comic\r\npoet, wrote of him\r\n\r\n    \"Full worthy to be punished though he be,\r\n    Yet ostracism's not for such as he.\"\r\n\r\nThe result was that no one was ever again ostracised at Athens, but\r\nHyperbolus was the last, as Hipparchus of Cholargus, who was some\r\nrelation to the despot of that name, was the first. Thus the ways of\r\nfortune are inscrutable, and beyond our finding out. If Nikias had\r\nundergone the trial of ostracism with Alkibiades, he would either\r\nhave driven him into banishment, and governed Athens well and wisely\r\nduring his absence, or he would himself have left the city, and\r\navoided the terrible disaster which ended his life, and would have\r\ncontinued to enjoy the reputation of being an excellent general. I am\r\nwell aware that Theophrastus says that Hyperbolus was ostracised in\r\nconsequence of a quarrel of Alkibiades with Phæax and not with Nikias;\r\nbut my account agrees with that given by the best historians.\r\n\r\nXII. When ambassadors came to Athens from Egesta and Leontini,\r\ninviting the Athenians to commence a campaign in Sicily, Nikias\r\nopposed the project, but was overruled by Alkibiades and the war\r\nparty. Before the assembly met to discuss the matter, men's heads were\r\ncompletely turned with vague hopes of conquest, so that the youths in\r\nthe gymnasia, and the older men in their places of business or of\r\nrecreation, did nothing but sketch the outline of the island of Sicily\r\nand of the adjacent seas and continents. They regarded Sicily not so\r\nmuch as a prize to be won, but as a stepping-stone to greater\r\nconquests, meaning from it to attack Carthage, and make themselves\r\nmasters of the Mediterranean sea as far as the Columns of Herakles.\r\nPublic opinion being thus biassed, Nikias could find few to help him\r\nin opposing the scheme. The rich feared lest they should be thought to\r\nwish to avoid the burden of fitting out ships and the other expensive\r\nduties which they would be called upon to fulfil, and disappointed him\r\nby remaining silent. Yet Nikias did not relax his exertions, but even\r\nafter the Athenian people had given their vote for the war, and had\r\nelected him to the chief command, with Alkibiades and Lamachus for his\r\ncolleagues--even then, on the next meeting of the assembly, he made a\r\nsolemn appeal to them to desist, and at last accused Alkibiades of\r\ninvolving the city in a terrible war in a remote country merely to\r\nserve his own ambition and rapacity. However, he gained nothing by\r\nthis speech, for the Athenians thought that he would be the best man\r\nto command the expedition because of his experience in war, and that\r\nhis caution would serve as a salutary check upon the rashness of\r\nAlkibiades and the easy temper of Lamachus; so that, instead of\r\ndissuading them his words rather confirmed them in their intention.\r\nFor Demostratus, who of all the popular orators was the most eager\r\npromoter of the expedition, rose, and said that he would put an end to\r\nthese excuses of Nikias: and he prevailed upon the people to pass a\r\ndecree that the generals, both at home and in the field, should be\r\ninvested with absolute irresponsible power.\r\n\r\nXIII. Yet it is said that the expedition met with great opposition\r\nfrom the priests; but Alkibiades found certain soothsayers devoted to\r\nhis own interests, and quoted an ancient oracle which foretold that\r\nthe Athenians should one day win great glory in Sicily. Special\r\nmessengers also came from the shrine of Ammon,[1] bringing an oracular\r\nresponse to the effect that the Athenians would take all the\r\nSyracusans. Those oracles which made against the project, people dared\r\nnot mention, for fear of saying words of ill-omen. Yet even the most\r\nobvious portents would not turn them from their purpose, such as the\r\nmutilation of all the Hermæ, or statues of Hermes, in Athens, in a\r\nsingle night, except only one, which is called the Hermes of\r\nAndokides, which was erected by the tribe Ægeis, and stands before the\r\nhouse in which Andokides lived at that time. A man likewise leaped\r\nupon the altar of the Twelve Gods, sat astride upon it, and in that\r\nposture mutilated himself with a sharp stone. At Delphi too there is a\r\ngolden statue of Pallas Athene standing upon a brazen palm tree, an\r\noffering made by the city of Athens from the spoils taken in the\r\nPersian war. This was for many days pecked at by crows, who at last\r\npecked off and cast upon the ground the golden fruit of the palm tree.\r\nThis was said to be merely a fable invented by the people of Delphi,\r\nwho were bribed by the Syracusans. Another oracle bade the Athenians\r\nbring to Athens the priestess of Athena at Klazomenae, and accordingly\r\nthey sent for her. Her name happened to be Hesychia, signifying\r\nRepose; and this is probably what the oracle meant that the Athenians\r\nhad better remain quiet. The astronomer, Meton, who was appointed to\r\nsome office in the army, either because of these adverse omens and\r\nprophecies, or because he was convinced that the expedition would\r\nmiscarry, pretended to be mad and to set fire to his house. Some\r\nhistorians relate that he did not feign madness, but that he burned\r\ndown his house one night, and next morning appeared in the\r\nmarket-place in a miserable plight, and besought his countrymen that,\r\nin consideration of the misfortune which had befallen him, they would\r\nallow his son, who was about to sail for Sicily in command of a\r\ntrireme, to remain at home. We are told that Sokrates the philosopher\r\nwas warned by one of the signs from heaven which he so often received\r\nthat the expedition would be the ruin of the city. And many were\r\nfilled with consternation at the time fixed for the departure of the\r\narmament. It was during the celebration of the Adonia, or mourning for\r\nthe death of Adonis, and in all parts of the city were to be seen\r\nimages of Adonis carried along with funeral rites, and women beating\r\ntheir breasts, so that those who were superstitious enough to notice\r\nsuch matters became alarmed for the fate of the armament, and foretold\r\nthat it would start forth gloriously, but would wither untimely away.\r\n\r\nXIV. The conduct of Nikias in opposing the war when it was being\r\ndeliberated upon, and his steadfastness of mind in not being dazzled\r\nby the hopes which were entertained of its success, or by the splendid\r\nposition which it offered himself, deserves the utmost praise; but\r\nwhen, in spite of his exertions, he could not persuade the people to\r\ndesist from the war, or to remove him from the office of general, into\r\nwhich he was as it were driven by main force, his excessive caution\r\nand slowness became very much out of place. His childish regrets, his\r\nlooking back towards Athens, and his unreasonable delays disheartened\r\nhis colleagues, and spoiled the effect of the expedition, which ought\r\nat once to have proceeded to act with vigour, and put its fortune to\r\nthe test. But although Lamachus begged him to sail at once to Syracuse\r\nand fight a battle as near as possible to the city walls, while\r\nAlkibiades urged him to detach the other Sicilian states from their\r\nalliance with Syracuse, and then attack that place, he dispirited his\r\nmen by refusing to adopt either plan, and proposed to sail quietly\r\nalong the coast, displaying the fleet and army to the Sicilians, and\r\nthen, after affording some slight assistance to the people of Egesta,\r\nto return home to Athens. Shortly after this, the Athenians sent for\r\nAlkibiades to return home for his trial on a charge of treason, and\r\nNikias, who was nominally Lamachus's colleague, but really absolute,\r\nproceeded to waste time in idle negotiations and languid manœuvres,\r\nuntil his troops had quite lost the high spirits and hopes with which\r\nthey had arrived at Sicily; while the enemy, who were at first\r\nterrified, began to recover their spirits, and despise the Athenians.\r\nWhile Alkibiades was still with them they had sailed to Syracuse with\r\nsixty ships, and while the rest remained in line of battle outside,\r\nten of these had entered the harbour to reconnoitre. These ships,\r\napproaching the city, made a proclamation by a herald that they were\r\ncome to restore the people of Leontini to their city, and they also\r\ncaptured a Syracusan vessel, in which they found tables on which were\r\nwritten the names of all the inhabitants of Syracuse, according to\r\ntheir tribes and houses. These tables were kept far away from the\r\ncity, in the temple of the Olympian Zeus, but at that time the\r\nSyracusans had sent for them in order to discover the number of men\r\nable to bear arms. These tables were now taken by the Athenians, and\r\ncarried to their general. When the soothsayers saw this roll of names,\r\nthey were much alarmed, fearing that this was the fulfilment of the\r\nprophecy that the Athenians should capture all the Syracusans.\r\nHowever, some declare that the prophecy was really fulfilled when the\r\nAthenian Kallippus slew Dion, and captured Syracuse.\r\n\r\nXV. Shortly after this, Alkibiades left Sicily, and the supreme\r\ncommand devolved upon Nikias. For Lamachus, though a brave and honest\r\nman, and one who always freely risked his life in battle, was but a\r\nplain simple man, and was so excessively poor, that whenever he was\r\nappointed general he was forced to ask the Athenians to advance him a\r\nsmall sum of money to provide him with clothes and shoes. Now Nikias\r\nwas excessively haughty, both on account of his great wealth, and his\r\nmilitary renown. It is said that once when the generals were debating\r\nsome question together, Nikias bade Sophokles the poet give his\r\nopinion first, because he was the eldest man present, to which\r\nSophokles answered, \"I am the eldest, but you are the chief.\" Thus\r\nwhen in Sicily he domineered over Lamachus, although the latter was a\r\nfar abler soldier, and by sailing about the coast at the point\r\nfurthest removed from the enemy, gave them confidence, which was\r\nturned into contempt, when he was repulsed from Hybla, a little fort\r\nin the interior. At last he returned to Katana, without having\r\neffected anything, except the reduction of Hykkara, a town of the\r\naborigines, not of the Greeks, from which it is said the celebrated\r\ncourtezan Lais, then a very young girl, was carried away captive and\r\nsent to Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\nXVI. As the summer advanced, and Nikias remained inactive, the\r\nSyracusans gained so much confidence that they called upon their\r\ngenerals to lead them to the attack of the Athenian position at\r\nKatana, since the Athenians did not dare approach Syracuse; while\r\nSyracusan horsemen even went so far as to insult the Athenians in\r\ntheir camp, riding up to ask if they were come to settle as peaceful\r\ncitizens in Katana, instead of restoring the Leontines. This\r\nunexpected humiliation at length forced Nikias to proceed to Syracuse,\r\nand he devised a stratagem by which he was able to approach that city\r\nand pitch his camp before it unmolested.\r\n\r\nHe despatched to Syracuse a citizen of Katana, who informed the\r\nSyracusans that if they desired to seize the camp and arms of the\r\nAthenians, they would only have to appoint a day and to march in force\r\nto Katana. Many of the Athenians, he said, spent all their time within\r\nthe walls of Katana, and it would be easy for the Syracusan party\r\nthere to close the gates, assail the Athenians within, and set fire to\r\ntheir ships. A numerous body of Kataneans, he added, were eager to\r\nco-operate in the plan now proposed.\r\n\r\nThis was by far the ablest piece of strategy accomplished by Nikias\r\nduring all the time that he remained in Sicily. The Syracusans were\r\ninduced to march out their entire force, leaving their city with\r\nscarcely any defenders. Meanwhile, Nikias sailed round from Katana,\r\ntook possession of the harbour, and encamped his forces on the\r\nmainland in a position where he could not be attacked by the enemy's\r\ncavalry. When the Syracusan army returned from Katana, he marched out\r\nthe Athenians and defeated them, but with little loss on their side,\r\nas their cavalry covered their retreat. Nikias now broke down the\r\nbridges over the river Anapus, which gave occasion to Hermokrates to\r\nsay, when he was making a speech to encourage the Syracusans, that it\r\nwas a ridiculous thing for Nikias to try to avoid fighting, as though\r\nit were not for the express purpose of fighting that he had been sent\r\nthither. But in spite of all that Hermokrates could say, the\r\nSyracusans were very much cast down and disheartened. Instead of the\r\nfifteen generals who usually commanded their troops they chose three,\r\nupon whom they conferred absolute powers, and swore a solemn oath that\r\nthey would leave them unfettered in the exercise of those powers.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians were very anxious to occupy the temple of Olympian Zeus,\r\nwhich was near their camp, and full of offerings of gold and silver.\r\nNikias, however, purposely delayed the attack until a force was sent\r\nfrom Syracuse to defend the temple. He thought that if the soldiers\r\ndid succeed in plundering it, the state would be none the better for\r\nit, and he himself would have to bear all the blame of sacrilege.\r\n\r\nNikias made no use of his boasted victory, and after a short time drew\r\noff his forces to Naxos, where he passed the winter, expending an\r\nenormous sum of money for the maintenance of so large a force, and\r\neffecting little or nothing except the reduction of a few disorderly\r\ntribes in the interior. The Syracusans now took heart again, marched\r\ninto the Katanean territory and laid it waste, and attempted to burn\r\nthe camp of the Athenians. Upon this all men blamed Nikias for\r\ndeliberating and taking precautions until the time for action was gone\r\nby. No one could find any fault with him when he was actually\r\nfighting; but though a bold and energetic man in action, he was slow\r\nto form plans and begin an enterprise.\r\n\r\nXVII. Thus when he did at length return to Syracuse, he managed the\r\noperation so swiftly and so skilfully that he disembarked his troops\r\nat Thapsus before the enemy were aware of his approach, took Epipolæ\r\nby surprise, took prisoners three hundred of the force of picked men\r\nwho endeavoured to recapture that fort, and routed the Syracusan\r\ncavalry, which had hitherto been supposed to be invincible. Moreover,\r\nwhat chiefly terrified the Sicilians, and seemed wonderful to all\r\nGreeks, was the speed with which he built a wall round Syracuse, a\r\ncity quite as large as Athens itself, but one which is much more\r\ndifficult to invest completely, because of the sea being so near to\r\nit, and the rough ground and marshes by which it is surrounded on the\r\nland side. Yet he all but succeeded in accomplishing this feat,\r\nalthough he was not in a condition of body to superintend such works\r\npersonally, for he suffered greatly from a disease of the kidneys, to\r\nwhich we must attribute whatever was left undone by his army. For my\r\nown part I feel great admiration for the diligence and skill of the\r\ngeneral, and for the bravery of the soldiers, which enabled them to\r\ngain such successes. The poet Euripides, after their defeat and utter\r\noverthrow wrote this elegy upon them:\r\n\r\n    \"Eight times they beat the Syracusan host,\r\n    Before the gods themselves declared them lost.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, they beat the Syracusans far more than eight times, before the\r\ngods turned against the Athenians and dashed them to the ground when\r\nat the height of their pride.\r\n\r\nXVIII. Nikias was present, in spite of his sufferings, at most of\r\nthese actions; but when his disease grew worse, he was forced to stay\r\nin the camp with a small guard, while Lamachus took the command of the\r\narmy, and fought a battle with the Syracusans, who were endeavouring\r\nto build a counter-wall which would obstruct the Athenians in building\r\ntheir wall of circumvallation. The Athenians were victorious, but\r\nfollowed up their success in such a disorderly manner that Lamachus\r\nwas left alone and exposed to the attacks of the Syracusan cavalry. He\r\nat once challenged their leader, a brave man named Kallimachus, to\r\nsingle combat, and both received and inflicted a mortal wound. His\r\ndead body and arms fell into the hands of the Syracusans, who at once\r\ncharged up to the Athenian walls, where Nikias lay helpless. The\r\nextremity of the danger roused him, and he ordered his attendants to\r\nset fire to a quantity of timber which had been brought thither to\r\nconstruct military engines, and to some of the engines themselves.\r\nThis desperate expedient checked the Syracusans, and saved Nikias and\r\nthe Athenians; for the rest of the Syracusan forces on perceiving so\r\ngreat a body of flame returned in haste to their city.\r\n\r\nThis affair left Nikias in sole command, and he had great hopes of\r\ntaking the place; for many cities in Sicily had formed alliances with\r\nhim, ships laden with corn kept arriving to supply his camp, and all\r\nbegan to be eager to be on his side, and to share in the fruits of his\r\nsuccess. The Syracusans themselves sent to propose terms of peace, for\r\nthey despaired of being able to defend their city any longer against\r\nhim. At this time Gylippus too, a Lacedæmonian who was sent to assist\r\nthem, heard during his voyage that they were completely enclosed and\r\nreduced to great straits, but held on his voyage notwithstanding, in\r\norder that even if, as he imagined, all Sicily had fallen into the\r\nhands of the Athenians, he might at any rate defend the Greek cities\r\nin Italy from sharing its fate. The air indeed was full of rumours\r\nthat the Athenians were carrying all before them, and that the good\r\nfortune and skill of their general rendered him invincible. Even\r\nNikias himself was so elated by his apparent good fortune, that he\r\nforgot his wonted prudence, and imagining from the secret intelligence\r\nwhich he had from his friends within Syracuse that it was on the point\r\nof surrender, neglected Gylippus altogether, and kept so bad a watch\r\nat the straits of Messina with his fleet, that Gylippus managed to\r\ncross there and land in Sicily. Here he at once proceeded to gather an\r\narmy together, but in a quarter of the island far away from Syracuse,\r\nso that the people of Syracuse knew nothing of his arrival. They even\r\nappointed a day for the public assembly to meet and discuss terms of\r\nsurrender with Nikias, and were about to attend it, as they thought\r\nthat it would be best for them to come to terms before the city was\r\nquite surrounded by the wall of the Athenians. There was now only a\r\nvery small portion of this left to be finished, and all the materials\r\nfor building it were collected on the spot.\r\n\r\nXIX. At this crisis there arrived at Syracuse Gongylus, a Corinthian,\r\nin one trireme. All crowded round him, to hear what news he brought.\r\nHe informed them that Gylippus would soon come to their aid by land,\r\nand that other triremes besides his own were on their way by sea. This\r\nintelligence was scarcely believed, until it was confirmed by a\r\nmessage from Gylippus himself, bidding them march out and meet him.\r\nThey now took courage and prepared for battle. Gylippus marched into\r\nthe town, and at once led the Syracusans out to attack the Athenians.\r\nWhen Nikias had likewise brought his army out of their camp, Gylippus\r\nhalted his men, and sent a herald to offer them an armistice for five\r\ndays, on condition that they would collect their effects and withdraw\r\nfrom Sicily. Nikias disdained to answer this insulting message; but\r\nsome of his soldiers jeeringly enquired whether the presence of one\r\nSpartan cloak and staff had all at once made the Syracusans so strong\r\nthat they could despise the Athenians, who used to keep three hundred\r\nsuch men, stronger than Gylippus and with longer hair, locked up in\r\nprison, and feared them so little that they delivered them up to the\r\nLacedæmonians again. Timæus says that the Sicilian Greeks despised\r\nGylippus for his avaricious and contemptible character, and that when\r\nthey first saw him, they ridiculed his long hair and Spartan cloak.\r\nAfterwards, however, he tells us that as soon as Gylippus appeared\r\nthey flocked round him as small birds flock round an owl, and were\r\neager to take service under him. This indeed is the more probable\r\nstory; for they rallied round him, regarding his cloak and staff to be\r\nthe symbols of the authority of Sparta. And not only Thucydides, but\r\nPhilistus, a Syracusan citizen by birth, who was an eye-witness of the\r\nwhole campaign, tells us that nothing could have been done without\r\nGylippus. In the first battle after his arrival, the Athenians were\r\nvictorious, and slew some few Syracusans, amongst whom was the\r\nCorinthian Gongylus, but on the following day Gylippus displayed the\r\nqualities of a true general. He used the same arms, horses, and ground\r\nas before, but he dealt with them so differently that he defeated the\r\nAthenians. Checking the Syracusans, who wished to chase them back to\r\ntheir camp, he ordered them to use the stones and timber which had\r\nbeen collected by the Athenians, to build a counter-wall, reaching\r\nbeyond the line of circumvallation, so that the Athenians could no\r\nlonger hope to surround the city. And now the Syracusans, taking fresh\r\ncourage, began to man their ships of war, and to cut off the\r\nstragglers with their cavalry. Gylippus personally visited many of the\r\nGreek cities in Sicily, all of whom eagerly promised their aid, and\r\nfurnished him with troops; so that Nikias, perceiving that he was\r\nlosing ground, relapsed into his former desponding condition, and\r\nwrote a despatch to Athens, bidding the people either send out another\r\narmament, or let the one now in Sicily return to Athens, and\r\nespecially beseeching them to relieve him from his command, for which\r\nhe was incapacitated by disease.\r\n\r\nXX. The Athenians had long before proposed to send out a reinforcement\r\nto the army in Sicily, but as all had gone on prosperously, the\r\nenemies of Nikias had contrived to put it off. Now, however, they were\r\neager to send him assistance. It was arranged that Demosthenes should\r\nemploy himself actively in getting ready a large force, to go to\r\nreinforce Nikias in the early spring, while Eurymedon, although it was\r\nwinter, started immediately with a supply of money, and with a decree\r\nnaming Euthydemus and Menander, officers already serving in his army,\r\nto be joint commanders along with him. Meanwhile, Nikias was suddenly\r\nattacked by the Syracusans both by sea and land. His ships were at\r\nfirst thrown into confusion, but rallied and sank many of the enemy,\r\nor forced them to run on shore; but on land Gylippus managed at the\r\nsame time to surprise the fort of Plemmyrium, where there was a\r\nmagazine of naval stores and war material of all kinds. A considerable\r\nnumber of the garrison, also, were either slain or taken prisoners;\r\nbut the most serious result was the stoppage of Nikias's supplies,\r\nwhich heretofore had been easily and quickly brought through the Great\r\nHarbour, while it remained in the hands of the Athenians, but which\r\nnow could not reach his camp by sea without a convoy and a battle.[2]\r\nMoreover, the Syracusan fleet had not been defeated by any superiority\r\nof force of the Athenians, but by the disorder into which it had been\r\nthrown by pursuing the enemy. They therefore determined to renew the\r\nconflict with better success.\r\n\r\nNikias, on his part, was unwilling to fight a second time, thinking it\r\nwas folly to fight with a diminished and disheartened force when he\r\nknew that Demosthenes was hurrying to his aid with a large and\r\nunbroken armament. However, Menander and Euthydemus, the newly-elected\r\ngenerals, were eager to distinguish themselves by performing some\r\nbrilliant action before the arrival of Demosthenes, and to eclipse the\r\nfame of Nikias himself. The pretext they used was the glory of Athens,\r\nwhich they said would be dishonoured for ever if they should now\r\nappear afraid to accept the Syracusans' offer of battle. The battle\r\nwas fought: and the Athenian left wing, we are told by Thucydides, was\r\nutterly defeated by the skilful tactics of the Corinthian steersman\r\nAristion. Many Athenians perished, and Nikias was greatly\r\ndisheartened, for he had now proved unfortunate both when sole\r\ncommander and when acting with colleagues.\r\n\r\nXXI. Matters were in this posture when Demosthenes was descried in the\r\noffing, approaching with a splendid armament which struck terror into\r\nthe hearts of the enemy. His fleet consisted of seventy-three ships,\r\non board of which were five thousand heavy-armed troops, and three\r\nthousand javelin men, archers, and slingers. The glittering arms of\r\nthe troops, the flaunting banners of the ships of war, and the music\r\nof the flutes to which the rowers kept time with their oars, made a\r\ngallant display, which delighted the Athenians as much as it depressed\r\nthe Syracusans. These latter, indeed, were struck with dismay, and\r\nthought that their last victory had been won in vain, and that they\r\nwere labouring to no purpose against a foe whose ranks were\r\ncontinually reinforced.\r\n\r\nNikias was not long allowed to feast his eyes on this welcome\r\nspectacle undisturbed. Demosthenes, as soon as he landed, insisted on\r\nthe necessity of instantly attacking Syracuse, and putting an end to\r\nthe siege, either by capturing the place, or by returning at once to\r\nAthens in case of failure. Against this Nikias, who was alarmed at the\r\nidea of such vigorous action, urged that it would be unwise to run\r\nsuch a risk. Delay, he argued, favoured the besiegers more than the\r\nbesieged, as their resources must soon fail, in which case their\r\nallies would desert them and they would again be brought to the\r\nnecessity of capitulating. Nikias adopted this view because of what he\r\nheard from his secret correspondents within the city, who urged him to\r\ncontinue the siege, telling him that already the Syracusans began to\r\nfeel the war too great a burden for them to support, and that Gylippus\r\nwas very unpopular among them, so that in a short time they would\r\nutterly refuse to hold out any longer, and would come to terms with\r\nthe Athenians. Nikias could only hint at these secret sources of\r\ninformation, and so his counsels were thought by his colleagues to be\r\nmere cowardice. They declared loudly that the original mistake was\r\nabout to be repeated, and the first terror-stricken impression of the\r\narmament frittered away, until familiarity with the sight of it had\r\nbred contempt in the breasts of their enemies. They therefore eagerly\r\nseconded the proposal of Demosthenes, and forced Nikias, though sorely\r\nagainst his will, to yield to their representations. Accordingly,\r\nDemosthenes with the land force assaulted the outlying fort on the\r\nhigh ground of Epipolæ by night, and took it by surprise, killing part\r\nof its garrison and putting the remainder to flight. He did not halt\r\nthere, but followed up his success by marching further on towards the\r\ncity, until he was met by some Bœotian heavy-armed troops, who had\r\nbeen the first to rally, and now in a compact mass met the Athenians\r\nwith their spears levelled, and with loud shouts forced them to give\r\nway with severe loss. The whole Athenian army was by this thrown into\r\nconfusion and panic, as the fugitives broke the formation of those\r\ntroops who were still marching to the front, so that in some cases\r\nthey actually fought with one another, each believing the others to be\r\nenemies. Thus the Athenians fell into sad disorder and ruin; for they\r\nwere unable to distinguish friends from foes in the uncertain light,\r\nas the moon, now nearly setting, glanced upon spear-points and armour\r\nwithout showing them clearly enough to enable men to see with whom\r\nthey had to deal. The moon was behind the backs of the Athenians: and\r\nthis circumstance was greatly against them, for it made it hard for\r\nthem to see the numbers of their own friends, but shone plainly on the\r\nglittering shields of their antagonists, making them look taller and\r\nmore terrible than they were. Finally, attacked as they were on every\r\nside, they gave way and fled. Some were slain by the enemy, some by\r\ntheir own countrymen, and some were dashed to pieces by falling down\r\nthe precipices; while the rest, as they straggled about the country,\r\nwere cut off by the Syracusan cavalry. Two thousand men perished, and\r\nof the survivors few brought back their arms.\r\n\r\nXXII. Nikias, who had expected this reverse, now cast the blame of it\r\nupon Demosthenes; and he, admitting his error, besought Nikias to\r\nembark his army and sail away as quickly as possible, pointing out\r\nthat no further reinforcement could be hoped for, and that they could\r\nnot hope for success with the force now at their disposal. Even had\r\nthey been victorious, he argued, they had intended to leave their\r\npresent camp, which was unhealthy at all times, and was now in the hot\r\nseason becoming pestilential. The time was the beginning of autumn,\r\nand many of the Athenians were sick, while all were disheartened.\r\nNikias, however, opposed the idea of retreat, not because he did not\r\nfear the Syracusans, but because he feared the Athenians more, and the\r\ntreatment which as an unsuccessful general he would probably meet\r\nwith. He declared that he saw no reason for alarm, and that even if\r\nthere was, that he would rather perish by the hands of the enemy than\r\nthose of his countrymen. A very different sentiment to that which was\r\nafterwards uttered by Leon the Byzantine, who said, \"My countrymen, I\r\nhad rather be put to death by you than to be put to death together\r\nwith you.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to the place to which it would be best for them to remove\r\ntheir camp, that, Nikias said, was a question which they might take\r\ntime to discuss.\r\n\r\nDemosthenes, seeing that Nikias was thus obstinate, and conscious that\r\nhis own project, when adopted, had led to a frightful disaster, ceased\r\npressing him to raise the siege, and gave the other generals to\r\nunderstand that Nikias must have secret reasons, from his\r\ncorrespondents within the city, which led him to persevere thus\r\nobstinately in remaining where he was. This caused them also to\r\nwithdraw their objections to remaining; but when another army came to\r\nassist the Syracusans, and the Athenians began to perish from malaria,\r\neven Nikias himself agreed that it was time to retreat, and issued\r\norders to his men to hold themselves in readiness to embark.\r\n\r\nXXIII. When all was ready, and the enemy off their guard, as they did\r\nnot expect the Athenians to retreat, an eclipse of the moon took\r\nplace, which greatly terrified Nikias and some others who, from\r\nignorance or superstition, were in the habit of taking account of such\r\nphenomena. That the sun should be sometimes eclipsed even the vulgar\r\nunderstood to be in some way due to the moon intercepting its light:\r\nbut what body could intercept the moon's light, so that suddenly the\r\nfull moon should pale its light and alter its colour, they could not\r\nexplain, but thought that it was a sinister omen and portended some\r\ngreat calamity.\r\n\r\nThe treatise of Anaxagoras, the first writer who has clearly and\r\nboldly explained the phases and eclipses of the moon, was then known\r\nonly to a few, and had not the credit of antiquity, while even those\r\nwho understood it were afraid to mention it to their most trusted\r\nfriends. Men at that time could not endure natural philosophers and\r\nthose whom they called in derision stargazers, but accused them of\r\ndegrading the movements of the heavenly bodies by attributing them to\r\nnecessary physical causes. They drove Protagoras into exile, and cast\r\nAnaxagoras into prison, from whence he was with difficulty rescued by\r\nPerikles; while Sokrates, who never took any part in these\r\nspeculations, was nevertheless put to death because he was a\r\nphilosopher. It was not until after the period of which I am writing\r\nthat the glorious works of Plato shed their light upon mankind,\r\nproving that Nature obeys a higher and divine law, and removing the\r\nreproach of impiety which used to attach to those who study these\r\nmatters, so that all men might thereafter investigate natural\r\nphenomena unreproved. Indeed, Plato's companion Dion, although the\r\nmoon was eclipsed when he was starting from the island of Zakynthus to\r\nattack the despot Dionysius, was not in the least disturbed by the\r\nomen, but sailed to Syracuse and drove out the despot. Nikias at this\r\ntime was without a competent soothsayer, for his intimate friend,\r\nStilbides, who used to check a great deal of his superstition, died\r\nshortly before this. Indeed, the omen, if rightly explained, as\r\nPhilochorus points out, is not a bad one but a very good one for men\r\nwho are meditating a retreat; for what men are forced to do by fear,\r\nrequires darkness to conceal it, and light is inimical to them.\r\nMoreover men were only wont to wait three days after an eclipse of the\r\nmoon, or of the sun, as we learn from Autokleides in his book on\r\ndivination; but Nikias persuaded them to wait for another complete\r\ncircuit of the moon, because its face would not shine upon them\r\npropitiously before that time after its defilement with the gross\r\nearthy particles which had intercepted its rays.[3] XXIV. Nikias now\r\nput all business aside, and kept offering sacrifices and taking omens,\r\nuntil the enemy attacked him. Their infantry assailed the camp and\r\nsiege works, while their fleet surrounded the harbour, not in ships of\r\nwar; but the very boys and children embarked in what boats they could\r\nfind and jeered at the Athenians, challenging them to come out and\r\nfight. One of these boys, named Herakleides, the son of noble parents,\r\nventured too far, and was captured by an Athenian ship. His uncle\r\nPollichus, fearing for his safety, at once advanced with ten triremes\r\nwhich were under his command; and this movement brought forward the\r\nrest of the Syracusan fleet to support him. An obstinate battle now\r\ntook place, in which the Syracusans were victorious, and many of the\r\nAthenians perished, amongst whom was their admiral Eurymedon. And now\r\nthe Athenians refused to remain before Syracuse any longer, and called\r\nupon their generals to lead them away by land, for the Syracusans\r\nafter their victory had at once blockaded the entrance to the harbour,\r\nso that no passage was left. Nikias and the other generals refused to\r\nagree to this proposal, as they thought it would be a pity to abandon\r\na fleet of so many transports, and nearly two hundred ships of war.\r\nThey placed the flower of the land force on board the ships, with the\r\nbest of the slingers and darters, and manned one hundred and ten\r\ntriremes, for they had not sufficient oars for a larger number.\r\nNikias now abandoned the great camp and walls of investment, which\r\nreached as far as the temple of Herakles, and drew the army up on the\r\nbeach as spectators of the battle. Thus the Syracusan priests and\r\ngenerals were able for the first time since the siege began to\r\nsacrifice to Herakles, as they were wont to do, while the people were\r\nmanning their fleet.\r\n\r\nXXV. The Syracusan soothsayers promised them the victory if they\r\nawaited attack and did not begin the attack: for Herakles himself\r\nnever struck the first blow, but always waited for his enemies to\r\nattack him. The sea-fight which now took place was the fiercest and\r\nmost obstinately contested of all those which took place throughout\r\nthe war, and its varying fortunes were shared with agonizing interest\r\nby the Athenian army and the citizens on the walls of Syracuse, who\r\nwere able from their respective positions to overlook the whole battle\r\nand watch the manœuvres of each ship. The Athenians were placed at a\r\ngreat disadvantage by having all their ships collected into one mass,\r\nwhere they were attacked from all sides by the lighter and more\r\nmanageable vessels of the enemy. The Syracusans also used stones as\r\nmissiles, which strike with equal effect, however they are thrown,\r\nwhile the Athenians replied with volleys of arrows and javelins, whose\r\naim was often spoiled by the motion of the vessels, and which are\r\nuseless unless they fly with the point foremost. All these details had\r\nbeen foreseen and taught to the Syracusans by Aristion the Corinthian\r\nsteersman, who fell in the moment of victory. The Athenians were\r\nfinally routed and driven ashore with great slaughter, and their\r\nretreat by sea completely cut off. Knowing how difficult it would be\r\nto make their way to any place of safety by land, they allowed\r\nthemselves to be so paralyzed by despair, that they let the Syracusans\r\ntow away their ships as prizes, without making an effort to save them,\r\nand actually neglected to ask for a truce for the burial of their\r\ndead. They seemed to think that the case of the sick and wounded whom\r\nthey saw amongst them, and whom they must perforce abandon when they\r\nleft their camp, was even more pitiable than that of the floating\r\ncorpses, and they actually envied the lot of the slain, knowing well\r\nthat after a few more days of suffering they themselves were all\r\ndestined to share their fate.\r\n\r\nXXVI. They were all eager to depart during the night which followed\r\nthis disastrous day; but Gylippus, perceiving that the people of\r\nSyracuse were so given up to feasting and merry-making, celebrating\r\nboth their victory and the festival of their national hero Herakles,\r\nto whom the day was sacred, that they could not be either forced or\r\npersuaded into attempting to harass the enemy's retreat, sent some of\r\nthose men who had formerly been in correspondence with Nikias to tell\r\nhim not to attempt to retreat that night, as all the roads were\r\noccupied by Syracusans lying in wait to attack him. Deceived by this\r\nintelligence, Nikias waited to find what he feared in the night turned\r\ninto a reality on the following day. At daybreak the passes were\r\noccupied by the Syracusans, who also threw up entrenchments at all the\r\nplaces where rivers had to be forded, and broke all the bridges,\r\nstationing their cavalry upon the level ground, so that the Athenians\r\ncould not advance a step without fighting. The Athenians remained for\r\nall that day and the following night in their camp, and then set out,\r\nwith such weeping and lamentation that it seemed rather as if they\r\nwere leaving their native country than a hostile one, so distressed\r\nwere they to see the miseries of their friends and relatives, and of\r\nthe sick and wounded who were unable to accompany their march and had\r\nto be left to their fate, while they themselves had a presentiment\r\nthat their present sufferings were nothing in comparison with those\r\nwhich awaited them. Among all these piteous sights, Nikias himself\r\noffered a glorious example. Worn out by disease, compelled by the\r\nexigencies of the retreat to forego the medicines and treatment which\r\nhis condition required, he nevertheless, weak as he was, did more than\r\nmany strong men could do, while all his men knew well that he made\r\nthose efforts, not from any wish or hope to save his own life, but\r\nthat it was solely on their behalf that he did not give way to\r\ndespair. The tears and lamentations of the rest were prompted by their\r\nown private sorrows and fears, but the only grief shown by Nikias was\r\nthat so splendid an expedition should have ended in such miserable\r\nfailure. Those who watched his noble bearing and remembered how\r\nearnestly he had opposed the whole scheme, were filled with compassion\r\nfor his undeserved sufferings. They began to despair of the favour of\r\nHeaven being shown to themselves, when they reflected that this man,\r\ncareful as he had always been to perform every religious duty, was now\r\nno better off than the humblest or the most wicked soldier in his\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nXXVII. Nikias made heroic efforts by cheerful looks, encouraging\r\nspeeches, and personal appeals to his followers, to show himself\r\nsuperior to fortune. Throughout the retreat, although for eight days\r\nin succession he was constantly harassed by the attacks of the enemy,\r\nhe nevertheless kept the division under his command unbroken and\r\nundefeated, until the other part of the army under Demosthenes was\r\nforced to surrender, being completely surrounded in an enclosed\r\nolive-ground, the property of Polyzelus, brother of the despot Gelon.\r\nDemosthenes himself drew his sword and stabbed himself, but not\r\nmortally, for the Syracusans quickly interposed and forced him to\r\ndesist. When the Syracusans told Nikias of this disaster, and allowed\r\nhim to send horsemen to convince him of its truth, he proposed terms\r\nto Gylippus, which were that the Athenians should be allowed to leave\r\nSicily, on condition of the repayment of the whole expenses of the\r\nwar, for which he offered to give hostages. These terms were refused,\r\nand the enemy with insulting cries and threats proceeded to shoot with\r\nmissiles of all kinds at the Athenians, who were now completely\r\nwithout food or drink. Yet Nikias prevailed upon them to hold out\r\nduring that night, and on the following day he led them, still under\r\nfire from the enemy, across the plain leading to the river Asinarus.\r\nThere some were forced into the stream by the enemy, while others cast\r\nthemselves in to quench their thirst. A most dreadful slaughter now\r\ntook place, the Athenians being wild with thirst, and the Syracusans\r\nkilling them as they drank, until Nikias surrendered himself to\r\nGylippus, saying, \"I beseech you, now that you are victorious, to show\r\nsome mercy, not to me, but to the Athenian troops. Consider how\r\nchangeful is the fortune of war, and how gently the Athenians dealt\r\nwith your men in their hour of victory.\"\r\n\r\nGylippus was visibly affected by the words, and by the sight of\r\nNikias; for he knew how well the Spartan prisoners had been treated by\r\nhim, when the peace was made with Athens; moreover, he thought that it\r\nwould be a great honour to him if he could carry home the enemy's\r\ncommander-in-chief as a prisoner. He received Nikias with kindness,\r\nand gave orders to take the rest of the Athenians alive. It was long,\r\nhowever, before these orders were understood and obeyed, so that more\r\nAthenians were slain than survived, although many were spared by the\r\nSyracusans in order that they might be sold for slaves.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were now assembled together, and their arms and armour\r\nhung upon the trees by the river side, as a trophy of the victory. The\r\nvictors next crowned themselves with garlands, decorated their horses,\r\ncut off the manes and tails of the captured horses, and marched back\r\ninto their own city, having by their courage and skill won the most\r\ncomplete victory ever gained by one Greek state over another.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. At a public assembly of the Syracusans and their allies which\r\nwas shortly afterwards held, the orator Eurykles proposed that the day\r\non which Nikias was taken should be kept as a festival for ever, upon\r\nwhich no work should be done, and sacrifice should be offered to the\r\ngods, and that the feast should be called the Asinaria, from the name\r\nof the river where the victory was won. The day was the twenty-sixth\r\nof the Dorian month Karneius, which the Athenians call Metageitnion\r\n(September 21st). Furthermore, he proposed that the Athenian slaves\r\nand allies should be sold, that the Athenians themselves, with what\r\nnative Sicilians had joined them, should be confined in the stone\r\nquarries within the city of Syracuse, and that their generals should\r\nbe put to death.\r\n\r\nThese propositions wore accepted by the Syracusans, who treated\r\nHermokrates with contempt when he urged that to be merciful in victory\r\nwould be more honourable to them than the victory itself. Gylippus\r\ntoo, when he begged that he might carry the Athenian generals alive to\r\nSparta, was shamefully insulted by the excited Syracusans, who had\r\nlong disliked the irritating Spartan airs of superiority natural to\r\nGylippus, and now, flushed with victory, no longer cared to conceal\r\ntheir feelings. Timæus tells us that they accused him of avarice and\r\npeculation, a hereditary vice, it appears, in his family since his\r\nfather Kleandrides was banished from Sparta for taking bribes, while\r\nhe himself afterwards stole thirty of the hundred talents which\r\nLysander sent home to Sparta, and hid them under the roof of his\r\nhouse, but was informed against, and exiled in disgrace. This will be\r\nfound described at greater length in the Life of Lysander.\r\n\r\nIn his account of the death of Nikias and Demosthenes, Timæus does not\r\nexactly follow the narrative of Thucydides and Philistus, as he\r\ninforms us that while the assembly was still sitting, Hermokrates sent\r\nto their prison to inform them that they were condemned to death, and\r\nto afford them the means of dying by their own hands, while the other\r\nhistorians state that the Syracusans put them to death.[4] Be this as\r\nit may, their dead bodies were exposed before the gates of Syracuse as\r\na spectacle for the citizens. I have heard also that at the present\r\nday a shield is shown in one of the temples at Syracuse, which is said\r\nto be that of Nikias, and which is beautifully adorned with woven\r\ncoverings of purple and gold.\r\n\r\nXXIX. Of the Athenians, the most part perished in the stone quarries\r\nof disease and insufficient food, for they received only a pint of\r\nbarley-meal and half-a-pint of water each day. Not a few, however,\r\nwere sold into slavery, being stolen for that purpose by Syracusans,\r\nor having escaped disguised as slaves. The rest were at length branded\r\nupon their foreheads with the figure of a horse, and sold into\r\nslavery. Yet even in this extremity their well-bred and dignified\r\nbehaviour came to their aid; for they soon either obtained their\r\nfreedom, or gained the confidence and respect of their masters. Some\r\ngained their freedom by their knowledge of Euripides. It appears that\r\nthe dramas of Euripides were especially popular in Sicily, but that\r\nonly a few fragments of his works had hitherto reached the Greek\r\ncities in that island. We are told that many of these captives on\r\ntheir return to Athens affectionately embraced Euripides, and told\r\nhim how some of them had been sold into slavery, but had been set free\r\nafter they had taught their masters as much of his poetry as they\r\ncould remember, while others, when wandering about the country as\r\nfugitives after the battle, had obtained food and drink by reciting\r\npassages from his plays. We need not then wonder at the tale of the\r\npeople of Kaunus, who, when a ship pursued by pirates was making for\r\ntheir harbour at first refused to admit it, but afterwards enquired\r\nwhether any on board knew the plays of Euripides; and on hearing that\r\nthey did, allowed them to enter the harbour and save themselves.\r\n\r\nXXX. At Athens the news of the catastrophe was at first disbelieved,\r\nbecause of the unsatisfactory way in which it reached the city. A\r\nstranger, it is said, disembarked at Peiræus, went into a barber's\r\nshop, and began to converse about what had happened as upon a theme\r\nwhich must be uppermost in every man's mind. The astonished barber,\r\nhearing for the first time such fearful tidings, ran up to Athens to\r\ncommunicate it to the archons, and to the public in the market-place.\r\nAll were shocked and astonished at hearing this, and the archons\r\nimmediately convoked the public assembly, and brought the barber\r\nbefore it. When he was asked to explain from whom he had heard this\r\nintelligence, as he could give no satisfactory account, he was\r\nregarded as a disturber of the public tranquillity by fabricating idle\r\ntales, and was even put to the torture. Soon, however, men arrived who\r\nconfirmed his tale, and described all the details of the catastrophe\r\nas far as they had witnessed them. Then at last the countrymen of\r\nNikias believed, after his death, what he had so often foretold to\r\nthem during his life.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In North Africa, the modern oasis of Siwah.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Plemmyrium on one side, and the city of Syracuse on the\r\nother, command the entrance of the gulf known as the Great Harbour,\r\ninside of which lay the Athenian fleet and camp.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Grote.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Grote, Part II. ch. lx, points out that there is no real\r\ncontradiction between the statement cited from Timæus, and the\r\naccounts gives of the transaction by Thucydides and Philistus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF CRASSUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Marcus Crassus[5] was the son of a father who had been censor, and\r\nenjoyed a triumph; but he was brought up with his two brothers in a\r\nsmall house. His brothers were married in the lifetime of their\r\nparents, and all had a common table, which seems to have been the\r\nchief reason that Crassus was a temperate and moderate man in his way\r\nof living. Upon the death of one of his brothers, Crassus married the\r\nwidow,[6] and she became the mother of his children; for in these\r\nmatters also he lived as regular a life as any Roman. However, as he\r\ngrew older, he was charged with criminal intercourse with Licinia,[7]\r\none of the Vestal Virgins, who was brought to trial; the prosecutor\r\nwas one Plotinus. Licinia had a pleasant estate in the suburbs, which\r\nCrassus wished to get at a small price, and with this view he was\r\ncontinually about the woman and paying his court to her, which brought\r\non him the suspicion of a criminal intercourse; but he was acquitted\r\nby the judices, being indebted in some degree to his love of money for\r\nhis acquittal from the charge of debauching the vestal. But he never\r\nremitted his attentions to Licinia till he got possession of the\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nII. Now, the Romans say that the many good qualities of Crassus were\r\nobscured by one vice, avarice; but the fact appears to be that one\r\nvice, which was more predominant in his character than all the rest\r\nhid his other vices. They allege, as the chief proof of his avarice,\r\nthe mode in which he got his money and the amount of his property.\r\nThough he did not at first possess above three hundred talents, and\r\nduring his first consulship he dedicated the tenth part of his\r\nproperty to Hercules,[8] and feasted the people, and gave every Roman\r\nout of his own means enough to maintain him for three months; yet,\r\nbefore the Parthian expedition, upon making an estimate of his\r\nproperty, he found it amount to seven thousand one hundred talents.\r\nThe greatest part of this, if one must tell the truth, though it be a\r\nscandalous story, he got together out of the fire and the war, making\r\nthe public misfortunes the source of his wealth; for, when Sulla took\r\nthe city, and sold the property of those whom he put to death,\r\nconsidering it and calling it spoil, and wishing to attach the infamy\r\nof the deed to as many of the most powerful men as he could, Crassus\r\nwas never tired of receiving or buying. Besides this, observing the\r\naccidents that were indigenous and familiar at Rome, conflagrations,\r\nand tumbling down of houses owing to their weight and crowded state,\r\nhe bought slaves, who were architects and builders. Having got these\r\nslaves to the number of more than five hundred, it was his practice to\r\nbuy up houses on fire, and the houses which were adjoining to those on\r\nfire; for the owners, owing to fear and uncertainty, would sell them\r\nat a low price; and thus the greatest part of Rome fell into the hands\r\nof Crassus: but, though he had so many artizans, he built no house\r\nexcept his own; for he used to say that those who were fond of\r\nbuilding were ruined by themselves, without the aid of any opponent.\r\nThough he had many silver mines, and much valuable land, and many\r\nlabourers on it, still one would suppose that all this was of little\r\nvalue, compared with the value of his slaves: so many excellent slaves\r\nhe possessed,--readers, clerks, assayers of silver,[9] house-managers,\r\nand table-servants; and he himself superintended their education, and\r\npaid attention to it and taught them, and, in short, he considered\r\nthat a master was mainly concerned in looking after his slaves, who\r\nwere the living implements of domestic economy. And here Crassus was\r\nright, if, as he used to say, it was his opinion that he ought to\r\neffect everything by the instrumentality of slaves, and that he\r\nhimself should direct the slaves; for, we observe, that what is\r\neconomical with respect to things lifeless is political with respect\r\nto men. But he was not right in thinking and saying that nobody was\r\nrich who could not maintain an army out of his substance; for war\r\nfeeds not by a fixed allowance, according to Archidamus;[10] and,\r\nconsequently, the wealth that is required for war is unlimited; and\r\nthis opinion of Crassus was very different from the opinion of Marius;\r\nfor when Marius, after giving to each man fourteen jugera of land,\r\nfound that they wanted more, he said, \"May there never be a Roman who\r\nthinks that too little which is enough to maintain him.\"\r\n\r\nIII. Besides this, Crassus was hospitable to strangers, for his house\r\nwas open to all, and he used to lend money to his friends without\r\ninterest; but he would demand it back immediately on the expiration of\r\nthe time of the borrower, which made the gratuitous loan more\r\nburdensome than heavy interest. In his entertainments the invitation\r\nwas usually to persons of the plebeian class, and general: and the\r\nfrugality of the banquet, which was accompanied with neatness and a\r\nfriendly welcome, made it more agreeable than a sumptuous feast. In\r\nhis literary pursuits he mainly studied oratory,[11] and that kind\r\nwhich was of practical use; and, having attained an ability in\r\nspeaking equal to the first among the Romans, he surpassed in care and\r\nlabour those who had the greatest talents; for they say, there was no\r\ncase, however mean and contemptible, which he approached without\r\npreparation; and often, when Pompeius, and Cæsar, and Cicero, were\r\nunwilling to get up to speak, he would perform all the duties of an\r\nadvocate: and for this reason he became more popular, being considered\r\na careful man, and always ready to give his help. He pleased people,\r\nalso, by his friendly and affable manner in taking them by the hand,\r\nand addressing them; for Crassus never met a Roman, however low and\r\nhumble his condition might be, without returning his salute,[12] and\r\naddressing him by his name. He is also said to have been well versed\r\nin history, and to have paid some attention to philosophy by studying\r\nthe writings of Aristoteles, in which he had for his teacher\r\nAlexander, a man who gave a proof of his moderation and easy temper in\r\nhis intercourse with Crassus; for it was not easy to say whether he\r\nwas poorer when he became acquainted with Crassus, or after the\r\nacquaintance was made. He was, indeed, the only friend of Crassus, who\r\nalways accompanied him when he travelled abroad; and he used to wear a\r\ncloak,[13] lent him for the purpose, which on his return he was asked\r\nto give back. Oh, the submission[14] of the man! for the poor fellow\r\ndid not consider poverty among the things that are indifferent. But\r\nthis belongs to a later period.\r\n\r\nIV. When Marius and Cinna had got the upper hand, and it was soon\r\napparent that they would reinstate themselves in Rome, not for the\r\nbenefit of their country, but plainly for the destruction and ruin of\r\nthe nobles, those who were caught in the city were put to death: among\r\nwhom were the father and brother of Crassus. Crassus, being very\r\nyoung, escaped immediate danger; but, seeing that he was hemmed in on\r\nall sides, and hunted by the tyrants, he took with him three friends\r\nand ten slaves; and, using wonderful expedition, made his escape to\r\nIberia, having been there before, when his father was Prætor,[15] and\r\nhaving made himself friends. Finding all in great alarm and trembling\r\nat the cruelty of Marius, as if he were close at hand, he did not\r\nventure to make himself known, but sought refuge in a tract bordering\r\non the sea, belonging to Vibius Pacianus,[16] where he hid himself in\r\na large cave. He sent a slave to Vibius to sound his disposition; for\r\nthe provisions that Crassus brought with him were now exhausted. On\r\nhearing the news, Vibius was pleased that Crassus had escaped; and\r\ninquiring about the number of persons with him, and where the place\r\nwas, he did not go himself to see them, but he took his villicus near\r\nthe spot, and ordered him to have food daily prepared, and to carry it\r\nand place it near the rock, and to go away without speaking a word,\r\nand not to be curious about the matter, or make any inquiries; and he\r\ngave him notice, that if he did meddle at all he should be put to\r\ndeath, but if he faithfully helped in the matter he should have his\r\nfreedom. The cave is not far from the sea, and the precipices which\r\nshut it in leave a small and hardly perceptible path[17] which leads\r\ninto the cave; but when you have entered, it opens to a wonderful\r\nheight, and spreads out wide, with recesses which open into one\r\nanother, and are of a large circuit. It is also neither without water\r\nnor light: for a spring of the purest water oozes out at the base of\r\nthe precipice; and there are natural clefts about that part where the\r\nrock closes, by which the external light is admitted, and in the\r\ndaytime the spot is fully illuminated. The air within is free from all\r\nmoisture caused by dropping, and is quite pure, owing to the\r\ncompactness of the rock, which diverts all the wet and droppings to\r\nthe spring.\r\n\r\nV. While Crassus stayed in the cave, the slave came daily to bring\r\nprovisions; but he did not see the persons who were concealed, or know\r\nwho they were; though he was seen by them, inasmuch as they knew, and\r\nwatched the times of his coming. Now, the provision that was made for\r\ntheir meals was ample enough even for luxury, and not merely\r\nsufficient for their necessities. But Vibius determined to show\r\nCrassus every kind of friendly attention; and it occurred to him to\r\nconsider the youth of Crassus, that he was a very young man, and that\r\nprovision should be made in some degree also for the pleasures\r\nsuitable to his age, and that merely to supply his wants would argue\r\nthat he was serving Crassus as little as he could, rather than with\r\nhearty zeal; accordingly, he took with him two handsome female slaves,\r\nand went down to the sea-coast. When he came to the place, he pointed\r\nto the road that led up to it, and told them to go in boldly. Crassus,\r\nseeing them approach, was afraid that the spot was known, and had been\r\ndiscovered; and, accordingly, he asked them what they wanted, and who\r\nthey were. The women replied, as they had been instructed, that they\r\nwere looking for their master, who was concealed there; on which\r\nCrassus perceived the joke which Vibius was playing off upon him, and\r\nhis kind attentions, and received the women; and they stayed with him\r\nfor the rest of the time, telling and reporting to Vibius what he\r\nrequested them. Fenestella[18] says, that he saw one of these slaves\r\nwhen she was an old woman, and that he had often heard her mention\r\nthis, and tell the story with pleasure.\r\n\r\nVI. In this way Crassus spent eight months in concealment; but as\r\nsoon as he heard of Cinna's end, he showed himself, and out of the\r\nnumbers that flocked to him he selected two thousand five hundred,\r\nwith whom he went round to the cities; and one city, Malaca,[19] he\r\nplundered, according to the testimony of many authors, though they say\r\nthat he denied the fact, and contradicted those who affirmed it. After\r\nthis he got together some vessels, and crossed over to Libya, to\r\nMetellus Pius,[20] a man of reputation who had collected a force by no\r\nmeans contemptible. But he stayed no long time there; for he\r\nquarrelled with Metellus, and then set out to join Sulla, by whom he\r\nwas treated with particular respect. When Sulla had passed over the\r\nsea to Italy, he wished all the young men who were with him to aid him\r\nactively, and he appointed them to different duties. Crassus, on being\r\nsent into the country of the Marsi to raise troops, asked for a guard,\r\nbecause the road lay through a tract which was occupied by the enemy;\r\nSulla replied to him in passion and with vehemence, \"I give thee as\r\nguards thy father, thy brother, thy friends, thy kinsmen, who were cut\r\noff illegally and wrongfully, and whose murderers I am now pursuing.\"\r\nStung by these words, and pricked on to the undertaking, Crassus\r\nimmediately set out, and, vigorously making his way through the enemy,\r\nhe got together a strong force, and showed himself active in the\r\nbattles of Sulla. The events of that war, it is said, first excited\r\nhim to rivalry and competition with Pompeius for distinction. Pompeius\r\nwas younger than Crassus, and his father had a bad repute at Rome, and\r\nhad been bitterly hated by the citizens; but still Pompeius shone\r\nconspicuous in the events of that period and proved himself to be a\r\ngreat man, so that Sulla showed him marks of respect which he did not\r\nvery often show to others of more advanced years and of his own rank,\r\nby rising from his seat when Pompeius approached, and uncovering his\r\nhead, and addressing him by the title of Imperator. All this set\r\nCrassus in a flame, and goaded him, inasmuch as he was thus slighted\r\nin comparison with Pompeius; and with good reason; Crassus was\r\ndeficient in experience, and the credit that he got by his military\r\nexploits was lost by his innate vices,--love of gain and meanness;\r\nfor, upon taking Tudertia,[21] a city of the Umbri, it was suspected\r\nthat he appropriated to himself most of the spoil, and this was made a\r\nmatter of charge against him to Sulla. However, in the battle near\r\nRome,[22] which was the greatest in all the war, and the last, Sulla\r\nwas defeated, the soldiers under his command being put to flight, and\r\nsome of them trampled down in the pursuit: Crassus, who commanded the\r\nright wing, was victorious, and, after continuing the pursuit till\r\nnightfall, he sent to Sulla to ask for something for his soldiers to\r\neat, and to report his success. But, during the proscriptions and\r\nconfiscations, on the other hand, he got a bad name, by buying at low\r\nprices large properties, and asking for grants. It is said that, in\r\nthe country of the Bruttii, he also proscribed a person, not pursuant\r\nto Sulla's orders, but merely to enrich himself thereby, and that, on\r\nthis account, Sulla, who disapproved of his conduct, never employed\r\nhim again in any public business. However, Crassus was most expert in\r\ngaining over everybody by flattery; and, on the other hand, he was\r\neasily taken in by flattery from any person. It is further mentioned\r\nas a peculiarity in his character, that, though very greedy of\r\ngain,[23] he hated and abused those most who were like himself.\r\n\r\nVII. But Crassus was most annoyed at the military success of Pompeius,\r\nand his enjoying a triumph before he became a senator, and being\r\ncalled by the citizens Magnus, which means Great. On one occasion,\r\nwhen somebody observed that Pompeius the Great was approaching,\r\nCrassus smiled, and asked, How great he was? But, as Crassus despaired\r\nof equalling Pompeius in military reputation, he entered upon a\r\npolitical career, and, by his activity, by pleading in the courts, and\r\nlending money, and by canvassing for candidates, and subjecting\r\nhimself to all kinds of scrutiny in conjunction with those who wanted\r\nanything of the people, he acquired a power and reputation equal to\r\nwhat Pompeius had got by his many and great military services. And the\r\nresult to each of them was something unusual; for, when Pompeius was\r\nabsent from Rome, his name and his influence in the State, by reason\r\nof his military exploits, was superior to that of Crassus; but when\r\nPompeius was at Rome, he often fell short of Crassus in influence, for\r\nhis haughty temper and habitual pride made him avoid crowds and retire\r\nfrom the Forum, and seldom give his aid to those who sought it, and\r\nthen not readily; his object being to keep his power at a higher\r\npitch, by exercising it only on his own behalf. But Crassus was always\r\nready to make himself useful, and he did not keep himself retired, nor\r\nwas he difficult of access, but he was always busy in everything that\r\nwas going on, and by the general kindness of his behaviour he got the\r\nadvantage over the proud bearing of Pompeius. In personal dignity, in\r\npersuasive speech, and attractive expression of countenance it is said\r\nthey were both equally fortunate. However, this rivalry did not hurry\r\nCrassus into any personal enmity or ill-will, and though, he was\r\nannoyed at Pompeius and Cæsar receiving greater honour than himself,\r\nhe never allowed this jealous feeling to be associated with any\r\nhostility or ill disposition. It is true that when Cæsar was taken and\r\ndetained by the pirates, he cried out, \"What pleasure you will have,\r\nCrassus, when you hear of my capture!\" But afterwards, at least, they\r\nwere on friendly terms, and, when Cæsar was going to Iberia, as\r\nprætor,[24] and had no money in consequence of his creditors having\r\ncome upon him and seizing all his outfit, Crassus did not leave him in\r\nthis difficulty, but got him released, by becoming security for him to\r\nthe amount of eight hundred and thirty talents. When all Rome became\r\ndivided into three parties,--that of Pompeius, Cæsar and\r\nCrassus,--(for Cato[25] had more reputation than power, and was more\r\nadmired than followed), the sober and conservative part of the\r\ncitizens adhered to Pompeius; the violent and those who were lightly\r\nmoved, were led by the hopes that they had from Cæsar; Crassus, by\r\nkeeping a middle position, used both parties for his purposes, and, as\r\nhe very often changed in his political views, he was neither a firm\r\nfriend nor an irreconcilable enemy, but he would readily give up\r\neither his friendship or his enmity on calculation of interest; so\r\nthat within a short interval, he often came forward to speak both for\r\nand against the same men and the same measures. He had also great\r\ninfluence, both because he was liked and feared, but mainly because he\r\nwas feared. Accordingly Sicinius,[26] who was the most violent in his\r\nattacks on the magistrates and popular leaders of the day, in reply to\r\none who asked, \"Why Crassus was the only person whom he did not worry,\r\nand why he let him alone?\" said, \"That he had hay on his horn:\" now,\r\nthe Romans were accustomed to tie some hay round the horn of an ox\r\nthat butted, as a warning to those who might meet it.\r\n\r\nVIII. The insurrection of the gladiators and their devastation of\r\nItaly, which is generally called the war of Spartacus,[27] originated\r\nas follows:--One Lentulus Batiates kept gladiators in Capua, of whom\r\nthe majority, who were Gauls and Thracians, had been closely confined,\r\nnot for any misbehaviour on their part, but through the villainy of\r\ntheir purchaser, for the purpose of fighting in the games. Two hundred\r\nof these resolved to make their escape; but their design being\r\nbetrayed, those who had notice of the discovery, and succeeded in\r\ngetting away, to the number of seventy-eight, took knives and spits\r\nout of a cook's shop, and sallied out. Meeting on the way with some\r\nwaggons that were conveying gladiators' arms to another city, they\r\nplundered the waggons, and armed themselves. Seizing on a strong\r\nposition, they chose three leaders, of whom the first was Spartacus, a\r\nThracian of nomadic race, a man not only of great courage and\r\nstrength, but, in judgment and mildness of character, superior to his\r\ncondition, and more like a Greek than one would expect from his\r\nnation. They say that when Spartacus was first taken to Rome to be\r\nsold, a snake was seen folded over his face while he was sleeping, and\r\na woman, of the same tribe with Spartacus, who was skilled in\r\ndivination, and possessed by the mysterious rites of Dionysus,\r\ndeclared that this was a sign of a great and formidable power which\r\nwould attend him to a happy termination. This woman was at that time\r\ncohabiting with Spartacus, and she made her escape with him.\r\n\r\nIX. The gladiators began by repelling those who came against them from\r\nCapua and getting a stock of military weapons, for which they gladly\r\nexchanged their gladiators' arms, which they threw away as a badge of\r\ndishonour, and as barbaric. Clodius[28] the prætor was next sent\r\nagainst them from Rome, with three thousand men, and he blockaded them\r\non a mountain which had only one ascent, and that was difficult and\r\nnarrow, and Clodius had possession of it; on all other sides there\r\nwere steep smooth-faced precipices. On the top of the hill there grew\r\na great quantity of wild vines, and the men of Spartacus cutting off\r\nall the shoots that were adapted to their purpose, and, intertwining\r\nthem, made strong and long ladders, so that when fastened above, they\r\nreached along the face of the precipice to the level ground, and they\r\nall safely descended by them except one man, who stayed to take care\r\nof the arms; and, when all the rest had descended, he let the arms\r\ndown, and, having done this, he got down safe himself. The Romans did\r\nnot know what was going on; and accordingly, when the gladiators\r\nsurrounded them, they were put in alarm by the surprise, and fled, on\r\nwhich the enemy took their camp. Many of the herdsmen and shepherds in\r\nthose parts also joined the gladiators, men ever ready for a quarrel,\r\nand light of foot, some of whom the gladiators armed, and others they\r\nemployed as scouts and light troops. Publius Barinus[29] the prætor\r\nwas next sent against them, whose legatus, one Furius, at the head of\r\ntwo thousand soldiers, the gladiators engaged and put to flight.\r\nCossinus was then despatched, with a large force, to advise with\r\nBarinus, and to be associated in the command; but Spartacus, watching\r\nhis opportunity, while Cossinus was bathing at Salenæ,[30] was very\r\nnear seizing him. Cossinus made his escape with great difficulty, and\r\nSpartacus, seizing the baggage, closely followed up the pursuit, with\r\ngreat slaughter of the Romans, and he took the camp. Cossinus also\r\nfell. Spartacus, after defeating the prætor himself in many other\r\nbattles, and at last seizing his lictors and his horse, now became\r\ngreat and formidable: but still he formed a just judgment of the state\r\nof affairs and, not expecting to get the advantage over the power of\r\nthe Romans, he designed to lead his forces to the Alps; thinking that\r\nit was advisable for them to cross the mountains and to go to their\r\nseveral homes, some to Thrace and some to Gaul. But the gladiators\r\nbeing strong in numbers, and confident, would not listen to him, and\r\nthey went about ravaging Italy. The Senate were now no longer troubled\r\nmerely at the humiliation and disgrace that they suffered by the\r\nrevolt; but, moved by fear and the danger, they sent out both the\r\nconsuls[31] as to a war of the utmost difficulty and importance.\r\nGellius, suddenly falling on the Germans, who, by reason of their\r\narrogance and self-confidence, had separated from the troops of\r\nSpartacus, destroyed the whole body; and after Lentulus had hemmed in\r\nSpartacus with large armies, Spartacus, rushing upon them and joining\r\nbattle, defeated the legates and got all the baggage. Spartacus now\r\nattempted to force his way towards the Alps; and Cassius[32] who \"was\r\nthe governor of Gaul upon the Padus, met him with ten thousand men,\r\nand a battle was fought, in which Cassius was defeated with great\r\nlose, and with difficulty made his escape.\r\n\r\nX. The Senate, on receiving this news, angrily bade the consuls keep\r\nquiet, and they appointed Crassus to the command of the war, whose\r\nreputation and popularity induced many of the nobles to serve under\r\nhim. Crassus took his station on the frontiers of Picenum, with the\r\nview of waiting for Spartacus, who was moving in that direction; and\r\nhe sent Mummius, his legatus, at the head of two legions, to make a\r\ncircuit, and with orders to follow the enemy, but not to engage with\r\nthem, nor come to close quarters. But Mummius, as soon as he got what\r\nhe thought a favourable opportunity, fought a battle, and was\r\ndefeated; many of his men fell, and many, flying without their arms,\r\nmade their escape. Crassus received Mummius himself roughly, and\r\narming the soldiers again, he required of them security for their\r\narms, that they would keep them; and five hundred, who had been the\r\nfirst to run, and had shown most cowardice, he distributed into fifty\r\ndecades,[33] and out of each decade he took one man, by lot, and put\r\nhim to death; thus inflicting on the soldiers this ancient mode of\r\npunishment which had long fallen into disuse; for disgrace also is\r\nadded to the manner of death, and many things horrible and dreadful to\r\nsee accompany the punishment, in the presence of all the spectators.\r\nAfter inflicting this punishment, he made his men again face about and\r\nmarch against the enemy. Spartacus, however, avoided Crassus, and made\r\nhis way through Lucania to the sea, and, falling in with some Cilician\r\npiratical vessels, in the Straits, he formed a design to seize Sicily,\r\nand by throwing two thousand men into the island, to kindle again the\r\nservile war there, the flames of which had not long since been\r\nquenched, and required only a few sparks to set it again in a blaze.\r\nThe Cilicians[34] came to terms with Spartacus, and received his\r\npresents; but they deceived him, and sailed off. Under these\r\ncircumstances, he marched back from the coast, and fixed his army in\r\nthe peninsula of the Rhegine territory. Crassus now came up, and\r\nobserving that the nature of the ground suggested what was to be done,\r\nhe resolved to build a wall across the isthmus, for the purpose of\r\nkeeping his soldiers employed, and cutting off the supplies of the\r\nenemy. Though the undertaking was great and difficult, he accomplished\r\nit, and completed the work, contrary to all expectation, in a short\r\ntime, by digging a ditch[35] from sea to sea, through the neck of\r\nland, three hundred stadia in length, fifteen feet deep, and as many\r\nwide; and above the ditch he raised a rampart of surprising height and\r\nstrength. At first Spartacus paid no attention to what was going on,\r\nand treated it with contempt; but when forage began to fail, and he\r\nwanted to advance further into the interior, he discovered the lines\r\nof Crassus; and as there was nothing to be got in the peninsula,\r\ntaking advantage of a night when there was a fall of snow and a wintry\r\nstorm, he filled up a small part of the ditch with earth, and wood,\r\nand the branches of trees, and so carried over a third part of his\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nXI. Now Crassus was afraid that Spartacus might form a design to march\r\nagainst Rome; but he was encouraged by many of the followers of\r\nSpartacus quitting their leader, in consequence of some disputes, and\r\nencamping by themselves upon the banks of the lake Lucanis,[36] which\r\nthey say is subject to changes, at certain intervals becoming sweet,\r\nand then again salt, and not potable. Crassus coming upon this band,\r\ndrove them from the lake; but he was prevented from cutting them to\r\npieces and pursuing them, by the sudden appearance of Spartacus, who\r\nchecked the flight. Crassus had, before this, written to the Senate,\r\nto say that they ought to summon Lucullus[37] from Thrace, and\r\nPompeius from Iberia; but he now changed his mind, and made every\r\neffort to put an end to the war before they arrived, knowing that the\r\nsuccess would be attributed to him who came last, and brought help,\r\nand not to himself. Accordingly, he determined to attack first those\r\nwho had separated from the main body, and were carrying on the\r\ncampaign by themselves, under the command of Caius Cannicius and\r\nCastus; and he dispatched six thousand men, with orders to occupy a\r\ncertain hill, and keep themselves concealed. The men of Crassus\r\nendeavoured to escape notice by covering their helmets; but, being\r\nseen by two women, who were sacrificing for the enemy, they would have\r\nbeen in danger, if Crassus had not quickly appeared, and fought a\r\nbattle, the most severely contested of all in this war, in which he\r\ndestroyed twelve thousand three hundred men, of whom he found only two\r\nwounded in the back: all the rest died in the ranks, fighting against\r\nthe Romans. After the defeat of this body, Spartacus retired to the\r\nmountains of Petilia,[38] followed by Quintius,[39] one of the\r\ngenerals of Crassus, and Scrofas, his quæstor, who hung close on his\r\nrear. But, upon Spartacus facing about, the Romans were thrown into\r\ndisorderly flight, and made their escape, after having with difficulty\r\nrescued their quæstor, who was wounded. This success was the ruin of\r\nSpartacus, in consequence of the self-confidence which it infused into\r\nthe slaves: they would not now consent to avoid a battle, nor yet\r\nwould they obey their commanders, whom they surrounded, with arms in\r\ntheir hands, on the march, and compelled to lead them back through\r\nLucania against the Romans, wherein they did the very thing that\r\nCrassus desired; for it was reported that Pompeius was now\r\napproaching, and there were not a few who openly said that the victory\r\nin this war belonged to him; for he would fight as soon as he arrived,\r\nand put an end to the campaign. While Crassus, therefore, who was\r\neager to decide the affair by a battle, and to fix his camp near the\r\nenemy, was engaged in digging his trenches, the slaves came up to\r\nthem and attacked the men who were at work. As fresh men from both\r\nsides kept coming up to help their comrades, Spartacus, seeing that he\r\nmust fight, arranged all his army in order of battle. When his horse\r\nwas brought to him, he drew his sword and said, that if he won the\r\nbattle he should have plenty of fine horses from the enemy, and if he\r\nwas defeated he should not want one; upon which he killed his horse,\r\nand then he made his way towards Crassus himself, through many men,\r\nand inflicting many wounds; but he did not succeed in reaching\r\nCrassus, though he engaged with and killed two centurions. At last,\r\nafter those about him had fled, he kept his ground, and, being\r\nsurrounded by a great number, he fought till he was cut down. But,\r\nthough Crassus had been successful, and had displayed the skill of a\r\ngreat general, and had exposed his person to danger, yet the credit of\r\nthe victory did not escape being appropriated to Pompeius; for those\r\nwho fled from the battle were destroyed by him, and Pompeius wrote to\r\nthe Senate that Crassus had defeated the slaves in the open field, but\r\nhe had cut up the war by the roots.[40] Now Pompeius had a splendid\r\ntriumph for his victory over Sertorius and his exploits in Iberia; but\r\nCrassus did not venture to ask for the greater triumph; and even as to\r\nthe foot triumph called the ovation, which he did enjoy, it was\r\nconsidered but a mean thing, and below his dignity that he had a\r\ntriumph for a servile war. But how the ovation differs from the other\r\ntriumph, and about the name, I have spoken in the 'Life of\r\nMarcellus.'[41] XII. After these events, Pompeius was forthwith\r\ninvited to the consulship,[42] and, though Crassus had hopes of\r\nbecoming his colleague, still he did not hesitate to solicit the\r\nassistance of Pompeius. Pompeius gladly listened to his proposal, for\r\nhe was desirous in any way always to have Crassus his debtor for some\r\nobligation, and he actively exerted himself on behalf of Crassus; and\r\nfinally he said, in his address to the public assembly, that he should\r\nfeel no less grateful for the return of Crassus as his colleague than\r\nfor his own election. They did not, however, continue in this harmony\r\nafter entering on their office, but they differed on almost every\r\nsubject, and quarrelled about everything, and by their disputes\r\nrendered their consulship unfruitful in all political measures, and\r\nineffectual: however, Crassus made a great festival in honour of\r\nHercules, and feasted the people at ten thousand tables, and gave them\r\nan allowance of corn for three months. It was at the close of their\r\nconsulship, when Pompeius and Crassus happened to be addressing the\r\npublic assembly, that a man, not of any distinction, a Roman eques, a\r\nrustic in his mode of life, and one who did not meddle with public\r\naffairs, Onatius Aurelius,[43] got up on the rostra, and, coming\r\nforward, told a dream which he had had. \"Jupiter,\" he said, \"appeared\r\nto me, and bade me tell the citizens not to let the consuls lay down\r\ntheir office before they have become friends.\" Upon the man saying\r\nthis, and the assembly bidding the consuls be reconciled, Pompeius\r\nstood silent; but Crassus offering his right hand first, said,\r\n\"Citizens, I do not consider that I am humbling myself or doing\r\nanything unworthy of me when I make the advance towards good-will and\r\nfriendship to Pompeius, to whom you gave the name of Magnus before he\r\nhad a beard, and voted a triumph before he was a senator.\"\r\n\r\nXIII. These were the things worthy of commemoration in the consulship\r\nof Crassus. But his censorship[44] passed over altogether without\r\nresults, and without any active measures; for he neither revised the\r\nsenate, nor inspected the equites, nor made a census of the citizens,\r\nthough he had for his colleague Lutatius Catulus, the mildest of the\r\nRomans. But it is said that Crassus designed a shameful and violent\r\nmeasure, to make Egypt tributary to the Romans, and that Catulus\r\nopposed him vigorously, on which a difference arising between them,\r\nthey voluntarily laid down their office. In the affair of\r\nCatiline,[45] which was a serious matter, and one that came near\r\noverthrowing Rome, some suspicion, it is true, attached to Crassus,\r\nand a man came forward to name him as implicated in the conspiracy,\r\nbut nobody believed him. However, Cicero, in one of his orations,\r\nevidently imputed to Crassus and Cæsar participation in the plot; but\r\nthis oration was not published till after the death of both of them.\r\nBut in the oration on his consulship, Cicero says that Crassus came to\r\nhim by night and brought a letter[46] which contained information on\r\nthe affair of Catiline, as if his object was to establish the truth of\r\nthe conspiracy. Now Crassus always hated Cicero for this, but his son\r\nstood in the way of his doing Cicero any open injury. For\r\nPublius,[47] who was fond of oratory and of improving himself, was\r\nmuch attached to Cicero, and went so far as to change his dress when\r\nCicero did at the time of his trial, and he induced the other young\r\nmen to do the same. At last he prevailed upon his father, and\r\nreconciled him to Cicero.\r\n\r\nXIV. When Cæsar returned from his province,[48] he made preparations\r\nto be a candidate for the consulship; but, observing that Crassus and\r\nPompeius were again at enmity, he did not choose by applying to one of\r\nthem for his help to have the other for his enemy, and he did not\r\nthink that he could succeed if neither of them assisted him.\r\nAccordingly, he set about reconciling them, by continually urging upon\r\nthem, and showing that by their attempts to ruin one another they\r\nwould increase the power of the Ciceros, and Catuli, and Catos, who\r\nwould lose all their influence if they would unite their friends and\r\nadherents, and so direct the administration with combined strength,\r\nand one purpose. By persuasion and effecting a reconciliation, he\r\nbrought them together, and he formed out of the union of all three an\r\nirresistible power by which he put down the Roman senate and the\r\npeople, though he did not make Pompeius and Crassus more powerful, one\r\nthrough the other, but by means of the two he made himself most\r\npowerful; for immediately on being supported by Pompeius and Crassus,\r\nhe was elected consul by a great majority. While Cæsar was ably\r\ndischarging the business of the consulship, Crassus and Pompeius, by\r\nprocuring for him the command of armies, and by delivering Gaul into\r\nhis hands, fixed him in a kind of acropolis, thinking that they should\r\nadminister the rest of the State as they mutually agreed, after\r\nsecuring to Cæsar the authority which the lot had given him. Now\r\nPompeius did all this through unbounded love of power; but to the old\r\nvice of Crassus, his avarice, there was now added a new passion,\r\nambition for trophies and triumphs excited by the great exploits of\r\nCæsar, since it was in this alone that he was Cæsar's inferior; for he\r\nhad the superiority in everything else; and his passion remitted not\r\nnor diminished till it resulted in an inglorious death and public\r\nmisfortunes. Cæsar had come down from Gaul to the city of Luca, and\r\nmany of the Romans went to him there, and Pompeius and Crassus had\r\nprivate conferences with him, in which they agreed to take affairs in\r\nhand more vigorously, and to hold the whole power of the State at\r\ntheir disposal, to which end Cæsar was to remain in his military\r\ncommand, and Pompeius and Crassus were to have other provinces and\r\narmies. To this object there was only one road, which was to ask for a\r\nsecond consulship, and Cæsar was to assist them in their canvass by\r\nwriting to his friends and sending many of his soldiers to support\r\nthem at the comitia.\r\n\r\nXV. As soon as Crassus and Pompeius[49] returned to Rome, suspicion\r\nwas excited, and there was much talk through the whole city that their\r\nmeeting had been held for no good. In the Senate Marcellinus and\r\nDomitius asked Pompeius if he intended to be a candidate for the\r\nconsulship, to which Pompeius replied that perhaps he should, and\r\nperhaps he should not; being asked again, he said that he was a\r\ncandidate for the votes of the good citizens, but not a candidate for\r\nthe votes of the bad. It was considered that Pompeius had made a\r\nhaughty and arrogant answer; but Crassus said, in a more modest tone,\r\nthat he would be a candidate, if it was for the interest of the State;\r\nif it was not, he would decline. This encouraged certain persons to\r\nbecome candidates, among whom was Domitius. However, when Pompeius\r\nand Crassus had openly declared themselves candidates, the rest were\r\nafraid and withdrew; but Domitius was encouraged by Cato, who was his\r\nkinsman and friend, and stimulated and urged him to stick to his\r\nhopes, with the view of defending the common liberties; he said \"it\r\nwas not the consulship that Pompeius and Crassus wanted, but a\r\ntyranny; that their conduct showed they were not asking for the\r\nconsulship, but aiming to seize on the provinces and the armies.\" By\r\nsuch arguments, which were also his real opinions, Cato, all but by\r\nforce, brought Domitius to the Forum, and many sided with them. And\r\nthose who were surprised at the canvassing of Pompeius and Crassus\r\nwere no small number. \"Why then do they want a second consulship? And\r\nwhy do they wish to be colleagues again? And why will they not have\r\nthe consulship with other colleagues? There are many men among us who\r\nare surely not unworthy to be colleagues with Crassus and Pompeius.\"\r\nThis alarmed the partizans of Pompeius, who now abstained from no\r\nproceeding, however disorderly and violent; but, in addition to all\r\nthe rest, they placed a body of men to lie in wait and attack Domitius\r\nas he was going down to the Forum, while it was still dark, with his\r\npartizans, and they killed the man that held the light, and wounded\r\nmany, among whom was Cato. After putting the party of Domitius to\r\nflight, and driving them back to the house,[50] Pompeius and Crassus\r\nwere proclaimed consuls. Shortly after, they again surrounded the\r\nSenate-house with armed men, and, after driving Cato out of the Forum,\r\nand killing some persons who opposed them, they procured another five\r\nyears[51] of administration to be added to Cæsar's term, and the two\r\nprovinces of Syria and Iberia to be given to them. When the lots were\r\ncast, Crassus got Syria, and Pompeius had Iberia.\r\n\r\nXVI. The result of the lot was not universally disliked; for the\r\nmajority wished Pompeius not to be far from the city, and Pompeius,\r\nwho was much attached to his wife,[52] intended to spend his time\r\nchiefly in Rome. Crassus showed by his joy, immediately on the falling\r\nout of the lot, that he considered no greater good fortune had ever\r\nbefallen him, and he could scarcely keep quiet before strangers and in\r\npublic; to his friends he uttered many foolish and puerile expressions\r\nquite inconsistent with his years and temper, for he had never before\r\nshown himself in the least degree a braggart or arrogant. But now,\r\nbeing mightily elated, and his head completely turned, he was not for\r\nmaking Syria or Palestine the limit of his victories; but, designing\r\nto make the exploits of Lucullus against Tigranes, and those of\r\nPompeius against Mithridates appear mere child's play, he extended his\r\nhopes as far as to the Bactrians, and the Indians, and the external\r\nsea. And yet there was no mention of a Parthian war in the law[53]\r\nthat was drawn up on this occasion. But everybody knew that Crassus\r\nwas passionately bent on a Parthian war, and Cæsar wrote to him from\r\nGaul, approving of his design, and urging him to it. When it was known\r\nthat Ateius,[54] the tribune, intended to offer some opposition to his\r\nleaving the city, and many persons joined him who complained that\r\nCrassus was going to make war upon a people who were doing the Romans\r\nno wrong, and had a treaty with them, Crassus in alarm prayed Pompeius\r\nto accompany him, and escort him out of the city. Now, the reputation\r\nof Pompeius with the multitude was great, and, by showing himself in\r\nfront of Crassus, with cheerful looks and countenance, he\r\ntranquillized a numerous body of people who were prepared to obstruct\r\nCrassus, and to raise a shout against him, so that they made way and\r\nlet him pass through them quietly. But Ateius met Crassus, and, first\r\nof all, endeavoured to stop him by words, and he protested against his\r\nmarching out: in the next place, he ordered his attendant to lay hold\r\nof Crassus, and to detain him; but, as the rest of the tribunes would\r\nnot allow this, the attendant quitted his hold of Crassus, and Ateius\r\nrunning to the gate, placed there a burning brazier, and, as soon as\r\nCrassus arrived, he threw incense and poured libations upon it, and,\r\nat the same time, he denounced against Crassus curses, in themselves\r\ndreadful and terrific, and, in addition thereto, he uttered the names\r\nof certain awful and inauspicious deities. The Romans say that these\r\nmysterious and ancient curses have great efficacy, that no man can\r\nescape upon whom they are laid, and that he who utters them also has\r\nan unlucky end, and, accordingly, they are not denounced either on\r\nordinary occasions, or by many persons. Ateius was blamed for letting\r\nloose such imprecations and religious fears upon a State, on behalf of\r\nwhich he was hostile to Crassus.\r\n\r\nXVII. When Crassus arrived at Brundisium, though the sea was still\r\nrough owing to the wintry weather, he would not wait, but he set sail,\r\nand so lost many of his vessels. After getting together the remnant of\r\nhis forces, he marched through Galatia.[55] Finding King Deiotarus,\r\nwho was now a very old man, founding a new city, Crassus said\r\nsarcastically, \"King, you are beginning to build at the twelfth hour.\"\r\nThe Galatian, with a smile, replied, \"You, too, Imperator, I observe,\r\nare not very early with your Parthian expedition.\" Now Crassus was\r\npast sixty, and he looked older than he was. On his arrival, matters\r\nat first turned out fully equal to his expectation; for he easily\r\nthrew a bridge over the Euphrates, and got his army across safely, and\r\nhe also obtained possession of many cities in Mesopotamia which\r\nsurrendered. Before one of them, of which Apollonius was tyrant, he\r\nlost a hundred men, upon which he brought his force against the place,\r\nand, having got possession of it, he made plunder of all the property,\r\nand sold the people: the Greeks called the city Zenodotia.[56] On the\r\ncapture of the city, Crassus allowed his soldiers to proclaim him\r\nImperator, wherein he greatly disgraced himself, and showed the\r\nmeanness of his spirit, and that he had no good hopes of greater\r\nthings, as he was content with so slight a success. Having put\r\ngarrisons in the cities that had surrendered, to the amount of seven\r\nthousand infantry and a thousand cavalry, he retired to winter in\r\nSyria, and there to await his son,[57] who was coming from Cæsar in\r\nGaul, with the decorations that he had gained by his valour, and with\r\na thousand picked horsemen. This seemed to be the first blunder of\r\nCrassus, or at least, it was the greatest blunder that he committed\r\nnext to the expedition itself; for he ought to have advanced and to\r\nhave secured Babylon and Seleukeia,[58] two cities which were always\r\nhostile to the Parthians; instead of which, he gave his enemies time\r\nto make preparation. The next thing the people blamed was his waste of\r\ntime in Syria, which was employed more for purposes of money profit\r\nthan for military purposes; for he did not occupy himself in reviewing\r\nthe numbers of his troops, nor establishing games to keep the soldiers\r\nin exercise, but he busied himself about estimating the revenues of\r\ncities, and he was for many days with weights and scales in his hands\r\namong the treasures of the goddess in Hierapolis,[59] and, after\r\nrequiring from the towns and princes contingents of men, he would\r\nremit his requisitions for a sum of money; by all which he lost his\r\nreputation, and fell into contempt. The first sign that happened to\r\nhim proceeded from this goddess herself, whom some consider to be\r\nAphrodite (Venus); and others Hera (Juno); others again believe her to\r\nbe the cause that has supplied from moisture the seeds for all things,\r\nand nature, and the power that has pointed out the source of all good\r\nthings for men; for, as they were going out of the temple, young\r\nCrassus first stumbled at the gate, and then his father fell upon him.\r\n\r\nXVIII. While Crassus was getting together his forces out of the winter\r\nquarter, there came ambassadors from Arsakes[60] with a short message.\r\nThey said, if the army was sent by the Romans, there was nothing but\r\nwar without truce, and without any terms; but if Crassus, contrary to\r\nthe wish of his country, as they heard, had brought arms against the\r\nParthians and occupied territory for his private profit, Arsakes would\r\nact with moderation, and would take pity on the old age of Crassus,\r\nand give up to the Romans the men whom he had in his power, and who\r\nwere rather under guard themselves than keeping guard over others.\r\nCrassus haughtily replied, that he would give an answer in Seleukeia;\r\non which Vagises, the oldest of the ambassadors, smiled, and, showing\r\nthe palm of his hand, said, \"From here, Crassus, hair will grow before\r\nyou see Seleukeia.\" The ambassadors now returned to Hyrodes, to inform\r\nhim that he must be ready for war. From the cities of Mesopotamia, in\r\nwhich there were Roman garrisons, some soldiers, who made their escape\r\nat great hazard, brought reports that caused much anxiety, having been\r\neye-witnesses of the numbers of the enemy, and of their mode of\r\nattacking the cities; and, as is usual, they magnified everything\r\nwhich they reported. \"When the enemy pursued,\" they said, \"no man\r\ncould escape from them, and when they fled, they could not be\r\novertaken; that strange missiles preceded the appearance of the enemy,\r\nand before one could see who sent them, they pierced through\r\neverything that they struck; and as to the arms of the mailed[61]\r\nsoldiers, some were made to push through every obstacle, and others to\r\ngive way to nothing.\" When the soldiers heard this their courage sank;\r\nfor they had been led to believe that the Parthians did not differ at\r\nall from the Armenians and Cappadocians, whom Lucullus plundered and\r\nrobbed till he was weary, and they thought that the hardest part of\r\nthe war would be a long march, and the pursuit of men who would not\r\ncome to close quarters; but now, contrary to their hopes, they were in\r\nexpectation of a contest and great danger, so that some of the\r\nofficers thought that Crassus ought to stop, and again submit to their\r\ndeliberation the general state of affairs. Among these was Cassius[62]\r\nthe quæstor. The seers, also, in gentle terms showed that bad and\r\nunfavourable signs were always prognosticated to Crassus by the\r\nvictims. But Crassus paid no attention to them, nor to those who\r\nadvised anything else except to move on.\r\n\r\nXIX. But Crassus was in no small degree encouraged by Artabazes[63]\r\nthe king of the Armenians, who came to the camp with six thousand\r\nhorsemen. These were said to be the guards and attendants of the king;\r\nand he promised ten thousand men clothed in mail and thirty thousand\r\ninfantry, who were to be maintained at his own cost. He attempted to\r\npersuade Crassus to invade Parthia through Armenia; for, he said, the\r\narmy would not only have abundance of provision in its march through\r\nthe country by reason of him supplying them, but would also advance\r\nsafely, having in their front many mountains and continuous hills, and\r\nground unfavourable for cavalry, in which alone lay the strength of\r\nthe Parthians. Crassus was well enough satisfied with the zeal of the\r\nking and the splendour of the proffered aid; but he said he would\r\nmarch through Mesopotamia, where he had left many brave Romans; upon\r\nthis the Armenian went away. As Crassus was taking his army over at\r\nthe Zeugma,[64] many extraordinary claps of thunder broke around, and\r\nmany flashes of lightning came right in front of the army; and a wind,\r\nmingled with cloud and hurricane,[65] falling on the raft, broke up\r\nand crushed to pieces a large part of it. The spot also, on which\r\nCrassus intended to encamp, was struck with two thunderbolts.[66] A\r\nhorse, belonging to the general, which was caparisoned in splendid\r\nstyle, violently dragged along the man who held the reins, and\r\nplunging into the stream, disappeared. It is said also, that the first\r\neagle which was raised, turned round spontaneously. Added to this, it\r\nhappened that, as they were giving out the rations to the soldiers\r\nafter crossing the river, lentils and salt were given first, which the\r\nRomans consider to be symbols of lamentation, and are accustomed to\r\nplace before the dead; and, as Crassus was haranguing the soldiers, an\r\nexpression escaped him which greatly alarmed the army. He said he\r\nwould destroy the raft over the river, that no one among them might\r\nreturn; and though he ought, upon seeing the imprudence of his words,\r\nto have recalled what he had said and explained it to the soldiers, he\r\nneglected to do so, through his arrogant temper. Finally, when he was\r\noffering the usual expiatory sacrifice, and the priest had put the\r\nviscera into his hands, he threw them away, on which, observing that\r\nthe standers-by were greatly disturbed, he said with a smile, \"Such is\r\nold age; but no arms at least shall drop from its hands.\"\r\n\r\nXX. After this he advanced along the river, with seven legions and\r\nnearly four thousand horsemen, and almost as many light-armed troops\r\nas horsemen. Some of the scouts now returned from their exploration\r\nand reported that the country was clear of men, and that they had\r\nfallen in with the tracks of many horses, which indicated that they\r\nhad turned about and were retreating. This gave Crassus still better\r\nhopes, and made the soldiers completely despise the Parthians, who, as\r\nthey supposed, would not come to close quarters. However, Cassius\r\nagain had some conversation with Crassus, and advised him at least to\r\ngive his troops rest in some of the garrisoned cities, till he should\r\nget some certain information about the enemy; but if he would not do\r\nthis, to advance towards Seleukeia along the river. He urged that the\r\nboats which carried the provisions would furnish them with supplies by\r\nstopping at the places of encampment, and that, by having the river as\r\na protection against being hemmed in by the enemy, they would always\r\nbe able to fight them on fair terms.\r\n\r\nXXI. While Crassus was considering and reflecting on these matters,\r\nthere comes an Arab chieftain, Ariamnes[67] by name, a cunning and\r\nfaithless man, and of all the misfortunes that were by chance combined\r\nto ruin the Romans the chief and crowning mischief. Some of them who\r\nhad served with Pompeius knew him as one who had received favours from\r\nPompeius, and was supposed to be a friend to the Romans; but he now\r\ncame to Crassus with a treacherous intent, and with the privity of the\r\nroyal generals, to try if he could draw him far away from the river\r\nand the foot of the hills, into a boundless plain, where he might be\r\nsurrounded by the enemy; for nothing was further from the intentions\r\nof the Parthians than to attack the Romans right in front.\r\nAccordingly, the barbarian coming to Crassus (and he was a plausible\r\ntalker), spake in high terms of Pompeius as his benefactor, and\r\npraised the force of Crassus; but he blamed him for his tardiness,\r\ninasmuch as he was delaying and making preparation, as if he would\r\nhave occasion to employ arms instead of hands and the most active\r\nfeet, against an enemy who had long been trying to get together, as\r\nquick as they could, their most valuable property and their best\r\nslaves, and to move off to the Scythians or Hyrkanians. \"And yet,\" he\r\nsaid, \"if you intend to fight, you ought to press on before the king\r\nrecovers his courage and all his forces are concentrated; for now\r\nSurena and Sillakes have been thrown in your way to stand the attack,\r\nand the king is no where to be seen.\" But all this was false. For\r\nHyrodes had at first divided his forces into two parts, and he was\r\nhimself ravaging Armenia to take vengeance on Artavasdes; but he sent\r\nSurena against the Romans, not because he despised them, as some say,\r\nfor it was not consistent for him to disdain Crassus as an antagonist,\r\nthe first of the Romans, and to war against Artavasdes and take the\r\nvillages of Armenia; but it seems that he really feared the danger,\r\nand that he was on the watch to await the result, and that he put\r\nSurena in the front to try the fortune of a battle, and so to divert\r\nthe enemy. For Surena was no person of mean estate: in wealth, birth,\r\nand consideration, he was next to the king; but, in courage and\r\nability, the first of the Parthians of his time; and, besides all\r\nthis, in stature and beauty of person he had no equal. He used always\r\nto travel, when he was on his own business, with a thousand camels to\r\ncarry his baggage, and he had following him two hundred carriages for\r\nconcubines; and a thousand mailed horsemen, with a larger number of\r\nlight cavalry, escorted him; and he had in all, horsemen, clients,[68]\r\nand slaves, no less than ten thousand. Now by hereditary right he had\r\nthe privilege of first placing the diadem on the head of him who\r\nbecame king of the Parthians;[69] and this very Hyrodes, who had been\r\ndriven out, he restored to the Parthian empire, and took for him\r\nSeleukeia the Great, being the first to mount the wall and to put to\r\nflight with his own hand those who opposed him. Though he was not yet\r\nthirty years of age at that time, he had the first reputation for\r\nprudent counsel and judgment, by which qualities particularly he\r\ncaused the ruin of Crassus, who through his confidence and pride in\r\nthe first place, and next through his fears and his misfortunes,\r\nbecame a most easy victim to fraud.\r\n\r\nXXII. The barbarian, after persuading Crassus, drew him away from the\r\nriver, and led him through the plains by a track at first convenient\r\nand easy, but which soon became toilsome; for it was succeeded by deep\r\nsand, and plains treeless and waterless, not bounded in any direction\r\nby any object that the eye could reach, so that, not only through\r\nthirst and the difficulty of the march, was the army exhausted, but\r\neven the aspect of all around caused the soldiers to despond past all\r\ncomfort, seeing neither plant, nor stream, nor top of sloping hill,\r\nnor blade of grass sprouting or rising through the earth, but a bare\r\nsea-like wave of desert heaps of sand environing the army. Now this of\r\nitself made the Romans suspect treachery. Messengers also came from\r\nArtavasdes the Armenian, with a message that he was engaged in a heavy\r\nstruggle since Hyrodes had fallen upon him, and that he could not send\r\nCrassus aid; but he advised Crassus above all things to change his\r\nroute immediately, and, by joining the Armenians, to bring the contest\r\nwith Hyrodes to a close: but, if he would not do this, he recommended\r\nhim to advance, and always to avoid encamping in such places as were\r\nadapted for the movements of cavalry, and to keep close to the\r\nmountainous parts: to all which Crassus sent no written answer, but,\r\nunder the influence of passion and perverse disposition, he answered,\r\nthat he had no leisure at present to deal with the Armenians, but he\r\nwould come at another time to punish Artavasdes for his treachery.\r\nCassius was again much dissatisfied: but he gave over advising\r\nCrassus, who was out of humour with him, though Cassius himself abused\r\nthe barbarian. \"What evil dæmon,\" he said, \"vilest of men, brought you\r\nto us, and by what drugs and witchcraft have you persuaded Crassus to\r\nplunge his army into a boundless wilderness and an abyss, and to\r\npursue a path more fit for a nomadic chief of robbers than for a Roman\r\nImperator?\" But the barbarian, who was a cunning follow, with abject\r\nservility, prayed him to endure a little longer; and, while running\r\nalong with the soldiers and giving them his help, he would jeer at\r\nthem in a laughing mood, and say, \"I suppose you think that you are\r\nmarching through Campania, and you long for the fountains, and\r\nstreams, and shades, and baths, and taverns? Have you forgotten that\r\nyou are crossing the confines of the Arabs and Assyrians?\" Thus the\r\nbarbarian amused the Romans, and before his treachery was discovered\r\nhe rode off, not, however, without the knowledge of Crassus, after\r\nmaking him believe that he would serve the Roman army, and put the\r\naffairs of the enemy in confusion.\r\n\r\nXXIII. It is said that on that day Crassus did not appear, as is the\r\ncustom of Roman generals, in a purple dress, but in black, which he\r\nimmediately changed on observing what he had done: and it is also said\r\nthat the men who carried the standards had much difficulty in raising\r\nsome of them up, for they stuck in the ground as if they were firmly\r\nrooted there. Crassus ridiculed all these omens, and quickened his\r\nmarch, urging the infantry to follow after the cavalry, till at last a\r\nfew of those who had been sent forward as scouts came up, and reported\r\nthat the rest of them had been cut off by the enemy, and they had\r\nescaped with difficulty, and that the Parthians were advancing with a\r\nlarge force, and full of confidence. This threw all the army into\r\nconfusion, and Crassus was completely confounded, and began to put his\r\nmen in order hastily, and with no great presence of mind: at first, as\r\nCassius recommended, he extended the line of the legionary soldiers as\r\nfar as possible in the plain, and making it of small depth, in order\r\nto prevent the enemy from attacking them on the flank, he distributed\r\nthe cavalry on the wings; but he changed his plan and, drawing his men\r\ntogether, formed them into a deep square of four fronts, with twelve\r\ncohorts on each side. By the side of each cohort he placed a body of\r\nhorse, in order that no part of the army might be without the aid of\r\nthe cavalry, but might make the attack equally protected on all sides.\r\nHe gave one of the wings to Cassius, and the other to young Crassus;\r\nhe himself took his station in the centre. Thus advancing, they came\r\nto a stream called Balissus,[70] which was neither large nor copious;\r\nbut it was a joyful sight to the soldiers in the midst of the drought\r\nand heat, and by comparison with the rest of their laborious march\r\nthrough a country without water. Now most of the commanders thought\r\nthat they ought to encamp and spend the night there, and learn what\r\nwas the number of the enemy, and the nature and disposition of their\r\nforce, and so advance against them at daybreak; but Crassus, being\r\nprevailed upon by the importunity of his son, and the cavalry with\r\nhim, to advance immediately, and engage with the enemy, gave orders\r\nfor the men who required it to eat and drink in their ranks. And\r\nbefore this could be well accomplished all through the ranks, he led\r\non his men, not slowly, nor halting at intervals, as is usual when men\r\nare marching to battle, but he kept them up to a quick, unbroken pace,\r\nuntil the enemy were in sight, who, contrary to expectation, did not\r\nappear to the Romans to be either numerous or formidable; for Surena\r\ndisguised his numbers by placing the mass of his force behind the\r\nfront ranks, and he prevented their bright armour from being seen by\r\nordering his men to cover themselves with cloaks and skins. But when\r\nthey were near the Romans, and the standard was raised by the general,\r\nfirst of all they filled the plain with a deep sound and a terrific\r\nnoise; for the Parthians do not excite themselves to battle with horns\r\nor trumpets, but they have hollow instruments,[71] made of skin, and\r\nfurnished with brass bells, on which they strike at the same time in\r\nvarious parts; and these instruments produce a kind of deep and dismal\r\nsound, compounded of the roaring of wild beasts and the harsh crash\r\nof thunder; for the Parthians rightly judge that of all the senses\r\nthe hearing is that which causes the greatest alarm in the mind, and\r\nthat, when this sense is affected, there is the speediest and greatest\r\ndisturbance in the judgment.\r\n\r\nXXIV. The Romans were startled at the noise, when all of a sudden\r\nthrowing off the covering of their armour the Parthians appeared, with\r\ntheir helmets and breastplates flashing like flame, the Margian\r\nsteel[72] glittering sharp and bright, and the horses equipped in mail\r\nof brass and iron; but Surena was most conspicuous of all, being the\r\ntallest and handsomest man among them, though his personal appearance,\r\nowing to his feminine beauty, did not correspond to his reputation for\r\ncourage, for he was dressed more in the Median fashion, with his face\r\npainted[73] and his hair parted, while the rest of the Parthians,\r\nstill keeping to the Scythian fashion, wore their hair long and bushy\r\nto make themselves more formidable. At first the Parthians intended to\r\nfall upon them with their long spears, and to drive the front ranks\r\nfrom their ground; but when they saw the depth of their close-locked\r\nranks, and the firmness and stability of the men, they drew back; and\r\nwhile they seemed to be at the same time dispersing themselves and\r\nbreaking their ranks, they threw themselves around the square before\r\nthe Romans were aware of it. Crassus ordered the light-armed troops to\r\nspring forward; but they had not advanced far before they were met by\r\na shower of arrows, which galled them, and they ran back for shelter\r\namong the legionary soldiers, and caused the beginning of disorder and\r\nalarm among the Romans, who saw the vigour with which the arrows were\r\ndischarged and their strength, for they tore the armour and made their\r\nway through everything alike, whether hard or soft defence. The\r\nParthians, dispersing themselves at considerable distances from one\r\nanother, began to discharge their arrows from all points at once, not\r\ntaking any very exact aim (for the close and compact ranks of the\r\nRomans did not give a man the opportunity of missing if he wished it),\r\nbut sending their arrows with vigorous and forcible effect from bows\r\nwhich were strong and large, and, owing to their great degree of\r\nbending, discharged the missiles with violence. Now the condition of\r\nthe Romans was pitiable from the beginning: for, if they kept their\r\nposition, they were exposed to be wounded, and if they attempted to\r\nclose with the enemy, they were just as far from doing the enemy any\r\nharm, and they suffered just as much; for the Parthians while\r\nretreating[74] still discharged their arrows, and they do this most\r\neffectually next to the Scythians: and it is a most subtle device to\r\nmake their escape from danger while they are still fighting, and to\r\ntake away the disgrace of flight.\r\n\r\nXXV.[75] The Romans endured so long as they had hopes that the\r\nParthians would withdraw from the contest when they had discharged\r\ntheir arrows, or would come to close quarters; but when they perceived\r\nthat there were many camels standing there, loaded with arrows, and\r\nthat the Parthians who had first shot all their arrows, turned round\r\nto the camels for a fresh supply, Crassus, seeing no end to this,\r\nbegan to lose heart, and he sent messengers to his son with orders to\r\nforce the enemy to engage before he was surrounded, for the Parthians\r\nwere mainly attacking and surrounding with their cavalry the wing\r\ncommanded by young Crassus, with the view of getting in his rear.\r\nAccordingly, the young man taking thirteen hundred horsemen,--a\r\nthousand of whom he had brought from Cæsar,--and five hundred\r\narchers, and eight cohorts of the legionary soldiers, who were nearest\r\nto him, wheeled about to attack the Parthians. But the Parthians, who\r\nwere manœuvring about Crassus, either because they fell in with some\r\nmarshes,[76] as some say, or because it was their design to attack\r\nCrassus when they had drawn him as far as they could from his father,\r\nturned round and fled. On this Crassus, calling out that the Parthians\r\ndid not stand their ground, advanced with Censorinus and\r\nMegabacchus,[77] of whom Megabacchus was distinguished for courage and\r\nstrength, and Censorinus[78] was a senator and a powerful speaker,\r\nboth of them companions of Crassus, and about the same age. The\r\ncavalry pursued the enemy, nor did the infantry allow themselves to be\r\nleft behind, being full of alacrity and hope of victory; for they\r\nthought that they were victorious and in pursuit: but they had not\r\ngone far before they perceived the stratagem; for the Parthians, who\r\nwere supposed to be flying, began to face about, and others, in\r\ngreater numbers, joined them. Upon this the Romans halted, thinking\r\nthat the enemy would come to close quarters with them, as they were\r\nonly few in number. But the Parthians placing their mailed horsemen in\r\nthe front, to oppose the Romans, rode about them with the rest of the\r\ncavalry dispersed, and, by trampling the ground, they raised from the\r\nbottom heaps of sand, which threw up such an immense cloud of dust\r\nthat the Romans could neither see clearly nor speak; and, being driven\r\ninto a narrow compass, and falling one on another, they were wounded\r\nand died no easy nor yet a speedy death, for tortured with violent\r\nconvulsions and pain, and writhing with the arrows in them, they\r\nbroke them in the wounds, and, by trying to pull out by force the\r\nbarbed points, which had pierced through their veins and nerves, they\r\nincreased the evil by breaking the arrows, and thus injured\r\nthemselves. Many thus fell, and the survivors also were unable to\r\nfight; for, when Publius encouraged them to attack the mailed\r\nhorsemen, they showed him that their hands were nailed to their\r\nshields, and their feet fastened right through to the ground, so that\r\nthey were unable either to fly or to defend themselves. However,\r\nPublius cheering the cavalry, made a vigorous attack with them, and\r\nclosed with the enemy; but the Romans were under a disadvantage, both\r\nas to attack and defence, striking with small and feeble spears\r\nagainst breastplates of raw hide and iron, and receiving the blows of\r\nlong spears on the lightly-equipped and bare bodies of the Gauls, for\r\nCrassus trusted most to them, and with them indeed he did wonderful\r\nfeats; for the Gauls, laying hold of the long spears, and closing with\r\nthe Parthians, pushed them from their horses, the men, owing to the\r\nweight of their armour, being unable to stir themselves; and many of\r\nthe Gauls, quitting their own horses, and slipping under those of the\r\nenemy, wounded them in the belly, and the horses springing up through\r\npain, and, at the same time, trampling on their riders and the enemy,\r\nfell dead. The Gauls were most oppressed by the heat and thirst, being\r\nunaccustomed to both, and they had lost most of their horses by\r\ndriving them against the long spears. They were, therefore, compelled\r\nto retreat to the legionary soldiers, taking with them Publius, who\r\nwas badly wounded. Seeing a sandy eminence near, they retreated to it,\r\nand fastened their horses in the middle, and closing in their front by\r\nclose-locking their shields, they thought they could thus more easily\r\nrepel the enemy: but it turned out just the other way; for, while they\r\nwere on the level ground, the front ranks did, in some sort, give\r\nrelief to those who were behind; but on this spot, which raised the\r\nmen one above another, by reason of the inequality of the ground, and\r\nplaced every one who was in the rear above the man in front of him,\r\nthere was no one who could escape, and they were all alike exposed to\r\nthe missiles, lamenting their inglorious and unresisting death. There\r\nwere with Publius two Greeks, who belonged to the dwellers in those\r\nparts in Carrhæ,[79] Hieronymus and Nikomachus, both of whom attempted\r\nto persuade Publius to retire with them, and to make his escape to\r\nIchnæ[80] a city which had taken the side of the Romans, and was not\r\nfar off. But he replied that no death was so dreadful as to make\r\nPublius, through fear of it, desert those who were losing their lives\r\nfor his sake, and bade them save themselves, and taking leave of them,\r\nhe allowed them to go: himself being unable to use his hand\r\neffectually, for it was pierced by an arrow, presented his side to his\r\nshield-bearer[81] and ordered him to despatch him with his sword. They\r\nsay that Censorinus perished in the same way, and that Megabacchus\r\nkilled himself, and all the rest of the most distinguished men. The\r\nParthians, ascending the hill, transfixed with their spears the\r\nsurvivors; and it is said that not more than five hundred were taken\r\nprisoners. The Parthians, cutting off the head of Publius, immediately\r\nrode off to attack Crassus.\r\n\r\nXXVI. With Crassus matters were thus. After ordering his son to make\r\nan attack on the Parthians, and receiving intelligence that they were\r\nrouted to a great distance, and were hotly pursued; seeing also that\r\nthe enemy in front were no longer pressing on him so much as before,\r\nfor most of them had crowded to the place where young Crassus was, he\r\nrecovered his courage a little, and drawing his forces together,\r\nposted them on a sloping ground, being in immediate expectation that\r\nhis son would return from the pursuit. Of those who were sent by\r\nPublius to his father, when he began to be in danger, the first fell\r\ninto the hands of the enemy and were killed; and the next, after\r\nescaping with great difficulty, reported that Publius was lost, if he\r\ndid not receive speedy and sufficient aid from his father. Now,\r\nCrassus was affected by many contending feelings at once, and he no\r\nlonger viewed anything with sober judgment. Distracted by alarm for\r\nthe whole army, and love of his son at the same time, he was urged by\r\none motive to go to his aid, and by the other not to go: but finally\r\nhe began to move in advance. In the mean time the enemy came up,\r\nmaking themselves more formidable by their shouts and pæans, and many\r\nof the drums again bellowed around the Romans, who were in expectation\r\nof a second attack. The Parthians, carrying the head of Publius fixed\r\non a spear, rode close up to the Romans, and, displaying it\r\ninsultingly, asked who were his parents and family, for it was not\r\ndecent to suppose that so noble and brave a youth was the son of so\r\ncowardly and mean a man as Crassus. The sight of this broke and\r\nunstrung the spirit of the Romans more than all the rest of their\r\ndangers; and it did not fill them with a spirit for revenge, as one\r\nmight have supposed, but with shuddering and trembling. Yet they say\r\nthat the courage of Crassus on that dreadful occasion shone forth more\r\nbrightly than ever before; for he went along the ranks, crying out,\r\n\"Mine alone, Romans, is this misfortune: but the great fortune and\r\nglory of Rome abide in you, if your lives are saved, unbroken and\r\nunvanquishcd: and, if you have any pity on me, who have been deprived\r\nof the noblest of sons, show this in your fury against the enemy. Take\r\nfrom them their rejoicing, avenge their cruelty: be not cast down at\r\nwhat has happened, for it is the law that those who aim at great\r\nthings must also endure. Neither did Lucullus vanquish Tigranes\r\nwithout loss of blood, nor Scipio Antiochus; and our ancestors of old\r\nlost a thousand ships on the coast of Sicily, and in Italy many\r\nImperatores and generals, not one of whom, by being first vanquished,\r\nprevented them from vanquishing the victors; for it is not by good\r\nfortune that the Roman state has advanced to such a height of power,\r\nbut by the endurance and courage of those who meet danger.\"\r\n\r\nXXVII. Though Crassus used such words to encourage them, he did not\r\nsee many eager to follow his exhortations: but, by ordering them to\r\nshout the battle cry, he discovered the dispirited condition of his\r\nmen, so weak, and feeble, and irregular a shout they made; while the\r\ncries on the side of the enemy were clear and bold. When the Parthians\r\nbegan the attack, their slaves and clients, riding about on the flanks\r\nof the Romans, galled them with their arrows: and the horsemen in\r\nfront, using their long spears, kept driving the Romans into a narrow\r\ncompass, except those who, to avoid death from the arrows, made a\r\ndesperate attempt to rush upon the Parthians; wherein they did the\r\nenemy little damage, but met with a speedy death by great and mortal\r\nwounds; for the Parthians drove their spears, heavy with iron, against\r\nthe horsemen; and, from the force of the blow, they often went even\r\nthrough two men. After thus fighting, as dark came on the Parthians\r\nretired, saying, that they allowed Crassus a single night to lament\r\nhis son, unless he should take better counsel for himself, and choose\r\nrather to come to King Arsakes than to be taken. The Parthians\r\nencamped near the Romans, in high hopes. A painful night followed to\r\nthe Romans, who neither paid any attention to the interment of the\r\ndead, nor care to the wounded, and those who were in the agonies of\r\ndeath; but every man was severally lamenting his own fate; for it\r\nappeared that they could not escape, either if they waited there till\r\ndaybreak, or if they plunged by night into a boundless plain. And the\r\nwounded caused a great difficulty; for they would be an obstacle to\r\nthe quickness of their flight if they attempted to carry them off:\r\nand, if they should leave them, their shouts would betray the attempt\r\nto escape unobserved. Though they considered Crassus to be the cause\r\nof all their sufferings, the soldiers still wished to see him and hear\r\nhis voice. But Crassus, wrapping himself up in his cloak, lay\r\nconcealed in the dark, an example to the many of fortune's reverses,\r\nand to the wise of want of judgment and of ambition, which made him\r\ndissatisfied unless he was the first and greatest among so many\r\nthousands, and think that he lacked everything because he was judged\r\nto be inferior to two men only. However, Octavius the legate, and\r\nCassius, endeavoured to rouse and comfort him; but, finding that he\r\nhad entirely given himself up to despair, they called together the\r\ncenturions and tribunes, and, after deliberating, they resolved not to\r\nstay on the ground, and they made an attempt at first to put the army\r\nin motion without the sound of the trumpet, and in silence. But when\r\nthe soldiers who were disabled, perceived that they were going to be\r\ndeserted, terrible disorder and confusion, mingled with groans and\r\nshouts, filled the camp; and this was followed by disorder and panic\r\nas they began to advance, for they thought that the enemy was coming\r\nupon them. After frequently turning from their route, and frequently\r\nputting themselves in order of battle, and taking up the wounded who\r\nfollowed, and then laying them down again, they lost much time on the\r\nmarch, with the exception of three hundred horsemen, with Ignatius[82]\r\nat their head, who reached Carrhæ about midnight. Ignatius, calling\r\nout in the Roman language to the watch upon the walls, and making them\r\nhear, told them to tell Coponius, the commander, that there had been a\r\ngreat battle between Crassus and the Parthians; and, without saying\r\nmore or who he was, he rode off to the Zeugma, and saved all his men;\r\nbut he got a bad name for deserting his general. However, the\r\ninformation thus conveyed to Coponius was some advantage to Crassus;\r\nfor Coponius concluded that this hasty and confused message indicated\r\nthat he who brought it had no good news to report: and, accordingly,\r\nhe immediately ordered the soldiers to arm; and, as soon as he learned\r\nthat Crassus was on his march, he went out to meet him, and, taking\r\ncharge of him and his army, conducted them into the city.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. Though the Parthians during the night discovered that the\r\nRomans were making their escape, they did not pursue, but at daybreak\r\nthey came upon those who were left in the camp, to the number of four\r\nthousand, and massacred them; and they rode about the plain and\r\novertook many who were there rambling about. Four complete cohorts,\r\nwhile it was still dark, under the command of Varguntinus the legate,\r\ngot separated from the rest and lost their way, and, being surrounded\r\nby the Parthians on an eminence, they fought till they were all\r\nkilled, with the exception of twenty men. The Parthians, admiring the\r\ncourage of these twenty men, who were endeavouring to push through\r\nthem with their bare swords, made way and allowed them a passage\r\nthrough their ranks, and to march slowly to Carrhæ. A false report\r\nreached Surena, that Crassus and all the men of rank had made their\r\nescape, and that those who had fled to Carrhæ were a mingled rabble\r\nnot worth notice. Thinking, then, that he had lost the end of his\r\nvictory, but being still doubtful and wishing to know the truth, in\r\norder that he might either stay there and besiege the town, or leave\r\nthe people of Carrhæ behind and pursue Crassus, he sends one of the\r\nmen with him, who could speak both languages, with instructions to\r\napproach the walls, and in the Roman language to call out for Crassus\r\nhimself or Cassius, and to say that Surena wished to have a conference\r\nwith them. The man did as he was ordered; and when it was reported to\r\nCrassus, he accepted the invitation, and soon after there came from\r\nthe barbarians some Arabs who well knew Crassus and Cassius by sight,\r\nhaving been in the camp before the battle. The Arabs, observing\r\nCassius on the wall, said that Surena proposed a truce, and offered,\r\nif they would become friends to the king, to let them go safe, if they\r\nwould leave Mesopotamia; for he considered this proposal advantageous\r\nto both sides, rather than to let matters come to extremities. Cassius\r\naccepted the proposal, and asked for a place and time to be fixed\r\nwhere Surena and Crassus should meet: the men replied that this should\r\nbe done, and rode off.\r\n\r\nXXIX. Now Surena was delighted at the Romans being besieged, and at\r\ndaybreak he led the Parthians against the city, who, with many\r\ninsulting expressions, bade the Romans, if they wished to have a\r\ntruce, deliver up to them Crassus and Cassius[83] in chains. The\r\nRomans were vexed at being deceived; and, telling Crassus to give up\r\nall hopes of aid from the Armenians as too remote and groundless, they\r\nprepared to make their escape by stealth; and none of the people of\r\nCarrhæ were to know this before the time came. But Andromachus, that\r\nmost faithless wretch, heard of it from Crassus, who confided to him\r\nthe secret, and also the guidance on the route. Accordingly, all was\r\nknown to the Parthians; for Andromachus reported to them every\r\nparticular. But as it is not the custom of the Parthians to fight in\r\nthe dark, and indeed they cannot easily do it, and Crassus had left\r\nthe city by night, Andromachus contrived that the Parthians should not\r\nbe far behind in the pursuit, by leading the Romans first by one route\r\nand then by another, till at last he brought them out of their course\r\ninto deep marshes and ground full of ditches, and thus made the march\r\ndifficult and circuitous to all who followed him; for there were some\r\nwho suspected that Andromachus had no honest object in turning and\r\ntwisting about, and therefore did not follow. Cassius, indeed,\r\nreturned to Carrhæ; and when the guides, who were Arabs, advised him\r\nto wait till the moon had passed the Scorpion, he replied, \"I fear the\r\nArcher more than the Scorpion,\" and, saying this, he rode off to\r\nSyria, with five hundred horsemen. Others, who had faithful guides,\r\ngot into a mountainous country, called Sinnaca,[84] and were in a safe\r\nposition before daybreak: they were about five thousand in number, and\r\nwere commanded by a brave man, Octavius. But daybreak found Crassus\r\nexposed to the treachery of Andromachus in the unfavourable ground and\r\nthe marshes. Crassus had with him four cohorts of the legionary\r\nsoldiers, and a very few horsemen, and five lictors, with whom he got\r\nupon the road with great difficulty just as the enemy was falling upon\r\nhim; and now being about twelve stadia short of joining Octavius, he\r\nfled to another hill not so difficult for cavalry nor yet so strong,\r\nbut one that lay below Sinnaca, and was connected with it by a long\r\nridge, which stretched through the middle of the plain. His danger was\r\napparent to Octavius, who ran before any one else with a few men, from\r\nthe higher ground to aid Crassus, upon which the rest of the men,\r\nabusing themselves for cowards, rushed forward, and, falling on the\r\nenemy, and repulsing them from the hill, put Crassus in the midst of\r\nthem, and threw their shields before him, proudly exclaiming that\r\nthere was no Parthian missile which should strike the Imperator until\r\nall of them had fallen in defence of him.\r\n\r\nXXX. Surena observing that the spirit of the Parthians was somewhat\r\ndulled towards the contest, and, if the night should come on and the\r\nRomans get among the mountains, they could not by any means be\r\novertaken, employed the following stratagem against Crassus. Some of\r\nthe captives were let loose, who, in the Parthian camp, had heard the\r\nbarbarians saying to one another, in pursuance of a concerted plan,\r\nthat the king did not wish the war with the Romans to be carried to\r\nextremities, but desired to have their friendship again, by doing them\r\nthe favour of treating Crassus kindly. Accordingly the barbarians\r\nstopped fighting; and Surena, with his chief officers, riding gently\r\nup to the hill, unstrung his bow, and holding out his right hand,\r\ninvited Crassus to come to terms, saying, that Crassus had put the\r\nking's courage and power to the test, though the king did not wish it,\r\nand yet the king of his own free will made the Romans an offer of\r\nmercy and friendship by being ready to make a truce with them if they\r\nwould retire, and by giving them the opportunity of a safe retreat.\r\nUpon Surena saying this the Romans eagerly accepted his proposal, and\r\nwere overjoyed; though Crassus, having been always over-reached by\r\ntheir fraud, and considering the suddenness of the change to be\r\ninexplicable, would not listen to them and hesitated. But the soldiers\r\nbegan to call out and urge him to accept the terms, and they fell to\r\nabusing and reproaching him, for wishing to expose them to the risk of\r\nfighting with those whom he did not venture to go to a conference\r\nwith, even when they laid aside their arms. Crassus at first attempted\r\nto prevail on them by entreaty, and he said that, if they would hold\r\nout for the rest of the day, they would be able to march by night\r\nthrough the rough and mountain country, and he pointed out to them the\r\nroute, and entreated them not to throw away their hopes when safety\r\nwas so near; but, as the soldiers began to be exasperated and to\r\nclatter their arms and threaten him, he was alarmed, and advanced\r\ntowards Surena, after first turning round and merely saying, \"Octavius\r\nand Petronius, and you Roman officers who are here, you see that I go\r\nunder compulsion, and you are witnesses that I am treated in a\r\nshameful way and am under constraint; but, if you get safe home, tell\r\nall the world, that Crassus lost his life through the treachery of the\r\nenemy, and was not surrendered by his fellow-citizens.\"\r\n\r\nXXXI. Yet Octavius and those about him did not stay behind, but\r\ndescended the hill with Crassus. However, Crassus made the lictors who\r\nwere following him turn back. The first who met them, on the part of\r\nthe barbarians, were two Greeks of half-breed, who, leaping down from\r\ntheir horses, made their obeisance to Crassus, and, addressing him in\r\nthe Greek language, urged him to send forward some persons, who, as\r\nthey said, would see that Surena himself and those about him were\r\nadvancing without armour and without their weapons. Crassus replied,\r\nthat if he had the least concern about his life, he should not have\r\nput himself into their hands; however, he sent two Roscii, brothers,\r\nto inquire upon what terms they should meet, and how many of them.\r\nSurena immediately seized and detained the two brothers, and he\r\nhimself advanced on horseback with the chief officers, and said, \"What\r\nis this? the Roman Imperator on foot while we are riding!\" and he\r\nordered them to bring a horse to Crassus. Crassus observed that\r\nneither himself nor Surena was acting wrong in coming to the\r\nconference according to the fashion of their respective countries; on\r\nwhich Surena said that from that moment there was a truce and peace\r\nbetween king Hyrodes and the Romans; but that it was requisite to\r\nadvance to the river,[85] and there have the agreement put in writing;\r\n\"for you Romans,\" he said, \"have not a very good memory about\r\ncontracts;\" and he held out his right hand to Crassus. When Crassus\r\nwas going to send for a horse, Surena said there was no occasion; \"for\r\nthe king gives you this.\" At the same time a horse with golden bits\r\nstood close by Crassus, and the grooms raised him up and mounted him,\r\nand then followed, quickening the horse's pace with blows. Octavius\r\nfirst laid hold of the bridle of the horse, and, after him, Petronius,\r\none of the tribunes, and then the rest got round the horse of Crassus,\r\nendeavouring to stop it, and dragging away those who pressed close\r\nupon Crassus on each side. This led to a struggle and tumult, and\r\nfinally to blows; Octavius drew his sword and killed the groom of one\r\nof the barbarians, and another struck Octavius from behind and killed\r\nhim. Petronius had no weapon, and, being struck on the breastplate, he\r\nleapt down from the horse unwounded; and a Parthian, named\r\nPomaxathres, killed Crassus.[86] Some say that it was not Pomaxathres,\r\nbut another, who killed Crassus, and that Pomaxathres cut off the head\r\nand right hand when Crassus was lying on the ground. But these are\r\nrather matters of conjecture than of certain knowledge; for of those\r\nwho were present some fell there fighting about Crassus, and the rest\r\nimmediately fled back to the hill. Upon this the Parthians came and\r\nsaid, that Crassus had been punished as he deserved, but Surena\r\ninvited the rest to come down and fear nothing: whereupon, some of the\r\nRomans came down and surrendered, and the rest dispersed themselves\r\nunder cover of night, of whom a very few escaped; the rest the Arabs\r\nhunted out, and put to death when they caught them. It is said that\r\ntwenty thousand perished in all, and ten thousand were taken alive.\r\n\r\nXXXII. Surena sent the head[87] and hand of Crassus to Hyrodes in\r\nArmenia; and, causing a report to be carried by messengers to\r\nSeleukeia that he was bringing Crassus alive, he got ready a kind of\r\nridiculous procession which, in mockery, he called a triumph. One of\r\nthe Roman prisoners who bore the greatest resemblance to Crassus,\r\nCaius Paccianus, putting on a barbarian female dress, and being\r\ninstructed to answer as Crassus and Imperator to those who addressed\r\nhim, was conducted, seated on a horse, and in front of him trumpeters,\r\nand some lictors rode upon camels; and there were purses[88] suspended\r\nfrom the fasces, and, by the side of the axes, heads of Romans newly\r\ncut off. Behind these followed courtesans of Seleukeia, singing girls,\r\nwho chanted many obscene and ridiculous things about the effeminacy\r\nand cowardice of Crassus. All this was public. But Surena assembling\r\nthe Senate of Seleukeia,[89] laid before them certain licentious books\r\nof the Milesiaca of Aristeides,[90] and, in this matter, at least,\r\nthere was no invention on his part; for they were found among the\r\nbaggage of Rustius,[91] and they gave Surena the opportunity of\r\ngreatly insulting and ridiculing the Romans, because they could not,\r\neven when going to war, abstain from such things and such books. To\r\nthe Senate of Seleukeia, however, Æsopus[92] appeared to be a wise\r\nman, when they saw Surena with the wallet of Milesian obscenities in\r\nfront of him, and dragging behind him a Parthian Sybaris in so many\r\nwaggons full of concubines, in a manner forming a counterpart to those\r\nvipers and skytalæ[93] so much talked of, by presenting the visible\r\nand the front parts formidable and terrific, with spears, and bows,\r\nand horses, but in the rear of the phalanx, terminating in harlots,\r\nand rattling cymbals, and lute-playing, and nocturnal revels with\r\nwomen. Rustius, indeed, merits blame, but the Parthians were shameless\r\nin finding fault with the Milesian stories; for many of the kings who\r\nhave reigned over them, as Arsakidæ, have been the sons of Milesian\r\nand Ionian concubines.\r\n\r\nXXXIII. While this was going on, Hyrodes happened to have been\r\nreconciled to Artavasdes the Armenian, and had agreed to receive the\r\nsister of Artavasdes as wife to his son Pacorus: and there were\r\nbanquets and drinking-parties between them, and representations of\r\nmany Greek plays; for Hyrodes was not a stranger either to the Greek\r\nlanguage or the literature of the Greeks: and Artavasdes used to write\r\ntragedies, and speeches, and histories, some of which are preserved.\r\nWhen the head of Crassus was brought to the door, the tables were\r\ntaken away, and a tragedy actor Jason,[94] by name, a native of\r\nTralles, chanted that part of the Bacchæ[95] of Euripides which\r\nrelates to Agave. While he was receiving applause. Sillakes, standing\r\nby the door of the apartment, and making a reverence, threw the head\r\nof Crassus before the company. The Parthians clapped their hands with\r\nshouts of joy and the attendants, at the command of the king, seated\r\nSillakes, while Jason handed over to one of the members of the chorus\r\nthe dress of Pentheus, and, laying hold of the head of Crassus, and,\r\nputting on the air of a bacchant, he sung these verses with great\r\nenthusiasm:--\r\n\r\n    We bring from a mountain\r\n    A young one new killed to the house,\r\n    A fortunate prey.\r\n\r\nThis delighted all the company; and, while the following verses were\r\nbeing chanted, which are a dialogue with the chorus,\r\n\r\n    _A_. Who killed him?\r\n    _B_. Mine is the honour,\r\n\r\nPomaxathres, springing up (for he happened to be at the banquet), laid\r\nhold of the head, as if it was more appropriate for him to say this\r\nthan for Jason. The king was pleased, and made Pomaxathres a present,\r\naccording to the fashion of the country, and he gave Jason a talent.\r\nIn such a farce[96] as this, it is said, that the expedition of\r\nCrassus terminated just like a tragedy. However, just punishment\r\novertook Hyrodes for his cruelty, and Surena for his treachery. Not\r\nlong after, Hyrodes put Surena to death, being jealous of his\r\nreputation. Hyrodes also lost his son Pacorus,[97] who was defeated\r\nby the Romans in a battle; and having fallen into an illness which\r\nturned out to be dropsy, his son, Phraates,[98] who had a design on\r\nhis life, gave him aconite.[99] But the poison only operated on the\r\ndisease, which was thrown off together with it, and Hyrodes thereby\r\nrelieved; whereupon Phraates took the shortest course and strangled\r\nhis father.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Crassus belonged to the Licinia Gens. His name was M.\r\nLicinius Crassus Dives. He was the son of P. Licinius Crassus Dives,\r\nwho was consul B.C. 97, and afterwards governor of the nearer Spain.\r\nIn B.C. 93 P. Crassus had a triumph. He was afterwards employed in the\r\nMarsic war; and in B.C. 89 he was censor with L. Julius Cæsar, who had\r\nbeen consul in B.C. 90.\r\n\r\nM. Licinius Crassus, whose life Plutarch has written, was the youngest\r\nson of the Censor. The year of his birth is uncertain; but as he was\r\nabove sixty when he left Rome for his Parthian campaign B.C. 55, he\r\nmust have been born before B.C. 115. Meyer (_Orator. Roman.\r\nFragment_.) places the birth of Crassus in B.C. 114.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Kaltwasser makes this passage mean that Crassus merely\r\ntook his brother's wife and her children to live with him; which is\r\ncontrary to the usual sense of the Greek words and readers the\r\nfollowing sentence unmeaning.\r\n\r\nKaltwasser observes that we do not know that such marriages were in\r\nuse among the Romans. I know no rule by which they were forbidden.\r\n(Gaius, i. 58, &c.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The punishment of a Vestal Virgin for incontinence was\r\ndeath. She was placed alive in a subterranean vault with a light and\r\nsome food. (Dionysius, ix. 40: Liv. 8. c. 15; Juvenal, Sat. iv. 8.)\r\nThe man who debauched a Vestal was also put to death. The Vestal\r\nVirgins had full power of disposing of their property; they were\r\nemancipated from the paternal power by the fact of being selected to\r\nbe Vestal Virgins (Gaius, i. 130); and they were not under the same\r\nlegal disabilities as other women (Gaius, i. 145; according to Dion\r\nCassius, 49. c. 38, Octavia and Livia received privileges like those\r\nof the Vestals).\r\n\r\nAnother Licinia, a Vestal, had broken her vow, and was punished B.C.\r\n113.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: See the Life of Crassus, c. 12; and the Life of Sulla, c.\r\n35.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: This may hardly be a correct translation of [Greek:\r\nargurognômonas] ἀργυρογνωμόνας: but it is something like the meaning.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: King Archidamus of Sparta, the second of the name, who\r\ncommanded the Peloponnesian war, B.C. 431. Plutarch (Life of\r\nDemosthenes, c. 17) puts this saying in the mouth of one Krobylus, a\r\ndemagogue.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Cicero (_Brutus,_ c. 66) speaks of the oratory of\r\nCrassus, and commends his care and diligence; but he speaks of his\r\nnatural parts as not striking. Crassus spoke on the same side as\r\nCicero in the defence of Murena, of Caelius, and of Balbus (Meyer,\r\n_Orator. Roman. Fragmenta,_ p. 382).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: A Roman who aspired to the highest offices of the State,\r\nprepared his way by the magnificence of his public entertainments\r\nduring his curule ædileship, and by his affable manners. An humble\r\nindividual is always gratified when a great man addresses him by name,\r\nand a shake of the hand secures his devotion. Ovidius (_Ars Amat_. ii.\r\n253) alludes to this way of winning popular favour, and judiciously\r\nobserves that it costs nothing, which would certainly recommend it to\r\nCrassus. If a man's memory was not so good as that of Crassus, he had\r\nonly to buy a slave, as Horatius (1 _Epist_. i. 50) recommends, who\r\ncould tell him the name of every man whom he met. Such a slave was\r\ncalled Nomenclator. If the nomenclator's memory ever failed him, he\r\nwould not let his master know it: he gave a person any name that came\r\ninto his head.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: The Greek is [Greek: stegastrou] στέγαστρου, 'something\r\nthat covers;' but whether cloak or hat, or covered couch, or sedan,\r\nthe learned have not yet determined.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: These words may not be Plutarch's, and several critics\r\nhave marked them as spurious. The Peripatetics, of whom Alexander was\r\none, did not consider wealth as one of the things that are indifferent\r\nto a philosopher; the Stoics did.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: This is Plutarch's word; but the father of Crassus was\r\nProconsul in Spain. When Cinna and Marius returned to Rome, B.C. 87,\r\nCrassus and his sons were proscribed. Crassus and one of his sons lost\r\ntheir lives: the circumstances are stated somewhat differently by\r\ndifferent writers. (Florius, iii. 21; Appian, _Civil Wars_, i. 72.)\r\n\r\nDrumann correctly remarks that Plutarch and other Greek writers often\r\nuse the word [Greek: stratêgos] στρατηγός simply to signify one who\r\nhas command, and that [Greek: stratêgos] is incorrectly rendered\r\n'Prætor' by those who write in Latin, when they make use of the Greek\r\nhistorians of Rome. But Plutarch's [Greek: stratêgos] στρατηγός\r\nsometimes means prætor, and it is the word by which he denotes that\r\noffice; he probably does sometimes mean to say 'prætor,' when the man\r\nof whom he speaks was not prætor. Whether [Greek: stratêgos] στρατηγός\r\nin Plutarch is always translated prætor or always Commander, there\r\nwill be error. To translate it correctly in all cases, a man must know\r\nwhether the person spoken of was prætor or not; and that cannot always\r\nbe ascertained. But besides this, the word 'Commander' will not do,\r\nfor Plutarch sometimes calls a Proconsul [Greek: stratêgos] στρατηγός,\r\nand a Proconsul had not merely a command: he had a government also.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: So the name is written by Sintenis, who writes it\r\nPaccianus in the Life of Sertorius, c. 9. Some editions read Paciacus;\r\nbut the termination in Paciacus is hardly Roman, and the termination\r\nin Pacianus is common. But the form Paciacus is adopted by Drumann,\r\nwhere he is speaking of L. Junius Paciacus (_Geshichte Roms_, iv. p.\r\n52).\r\n\r\nDrumann observes that the flight of Crassus to Spain must have taken\r\nplace B.C. 85, for he remained eight months in Spain and returned to\r\nRome on the news of Cinna's death, B.C. 84.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: The MSS. have [Greek: auran] αὖραν, 'breeze,' which\r\nCoræs ingeniously corrected to [Greek: laupan] λαύπαν, 'path,' which\r\nis undoubtedly right.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: If Fenestella died in A.D. 19 at the age of seventy, as\r\nit is said, he would be born in B.C. 51, and he might have had this\r\nstory from the old woman.

Spartacus sacrificed\r\nthree hundred Roman captives to the manes of Crixus, who had fallen in\r\nthe battle in which he was defeated; 20,000 of his men had perished\r\nwith Crixus.\r\n\r\nCassius was defeated in the neighbourhood of Mutina (Modena) as we\r\nlearn from Florus (iii. 20).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Appian (i. 118) gives two accounts of the decimation,\r\nneither of which agrees with the account of Plutarch.

He says that Spartacus sent over ten\r\nthousand men into Sicily. Drumann has understood the passage as I have\r\ntranslated it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: If the length is rightly given, the ditch was about 38\r\nRoman miles in length. There are no data for determining its position.\r\nThe circumstance is briefly mentioned by Appian (_Civil Wars_, i.\r\n118). Frontinus (_Stratagem._, i. 5) states that Spartacus filled up\r\nthe ditch, where he crossed it, with the dead bodies of his prisoners\r\nand of the beasts which were killed for that purpose.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: This lake, which Plutarch spells Leukanis, is placed by\r\nKaltwasser in the vicinity of Paestum or Poseidonia, but on what\r\ngrounds I do not know. Strabo indeed (p. 251) states that the river\r\nmakes marshes there, but that will not enable us to identify them.\r\nCramer (_Ancient Italy_, ii. 366) places here the Stagnum Lucanum,\r\nwhere Plutarch \"mentions that Crassus defeated a considerable body of\r\nrebels under the command of Spartacus (Plut. Vit. Crass.)\": but\r\nnothing is given to prove the assertion. He adds, \"In this district we\r\nmust also place the Mons Calamatius and Mons Cathena of which\r\nFrontinus speaks in reference to the same event (_Stratagem_, ii. 4);\r\nthey are the mountains of Capaccio.\" This is founded on Cluverius, but\r\nCluverius concludes that the Calamatius of Frontinus (ii. 4, 7), or\r\nCalamarcus as the MSS. seem to have it, is the same as the Cathena of\r\nFrontinus (ii. 5, 34); for in fact Frontinus tells the same story\r\ntwice, as he sometimes does. It is a mistake to say that Frontinus is\r\nspeaking \"of the same event,\" that is, the defeat of the gladiators on\r\nthe lake. He is speaking of another event, which is described farther\r\non in this chapter, when Crassus attacks Cannicius and Crixus, and\r\n\"sent,\" as Frontinus says (ii. 4, 7), \" twelve cohorts round behind a\r\nmountain.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: This was Marcus Lucullus, the brother of Lucius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: 'To the Peteline mountains' in the original. Strabo\r\nspeaks of a Petelia in Lucania (p. 254), which some critics suppose\r\nthat he has confounded with the Petilia in the country of the Bruttii.\r\nThe reasons for this opinion are stated by Cramer (_Ancient Italy_,\r\nii. 367, 390).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: 'Quintus' in the text of Plutarch, which is a common\r\nerror.

In an\r\novatio the general walked in the procession, instead of riding in a\r\nchariot drawn by four horses, as in the Triumphus Curulis; and he wore\r\na crown of myrtle, instead of a crown of bay which was worn on the\r\noccasion of the greater triumph. But Plinius (_Hist. Nat._ xv. 29)\r\nsays that Crassus wore a crown of bay on the occasion of this\r\novation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: The first consulship of M. Licinius Crassus and Cn.\r\nPompeius Magnus belongs to B.C. 70.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: The story is told again in the Life of Pompeius, c. 23,\r\nwhere Aurelius is called Caius Aurelius, which is probably the true\r\nname.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: Crassus was censor with Lutatius Catulus in B.C. 65. The\r\nduties of the censors are here briefly alluded to by Plutarch. One of\r\nthe most important was the numbering of the people and the\r\nregistration of property for the purposes of taxation. This quarrel of\r\nthe censors is mentioned by Dion Cassius (37. c. 9).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: The conspiracy of Catiline was in B.C. 63, the year when\r\nCicero was consul. See the Life of Cicero.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no evidence that Crassus was implicated in the\r\naffair of Catiline. Dion Cassius (37. c. 31) speaks of anonymous\r\nletters about the conspiracy being brought to Crassus and other\r\nnobles; and Plutarch states on the authority of Cicero that Crassus\r\ncommunicated the letters to Cicero. Dion Cassius in another passage\r\n(37. c. 35) mentions the suspicion against Crassus, and that one of\r\nthe prisoners informed against him, \"but there were not many to\r\nbelieve it.\" If Dion did not believe it, we need not; for he generally\r\nbelieves anything that is to a man's discredit. Sallustius (_Bellum\r\nCatilin._ c. 48) has given us a statement of the affair, but his own\r\nopinion can scarcely be collected from it. He says, however, that he\r\nhad heard Crassus declare that Cicero was the instigator of this\r\ncharge. The orations of Cicero which Plutarch refers to are not\r\nextant.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: The text is corrupt, though the general meaning is\r\nplain. See the note of Sintonis.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: The son of Crassus, who is introduced abruptly in\r\nPlutarch's fashion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: After Cæsar had been prætor in Spain he was elected\r\nconsul B.C. 59, with M. Calpurnius Bibulus (see the Life of Cæsar, c.\r\n14). After his consulship Cæsar had the Gauls as his province. The\r\nmeeting at Luca (Lucca), which was on the southern limits of Cæsar's\r\nprovince, took place B.C. 56; and here was formed the coalition which\r\nis sometimes, though improperly, called the first Triumvirate.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: The second consulship of Pompeius and Crassus was B.C.\r\n55. Cn. Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus was one of the consuls of the\r\nyear B.C. 56, during which the elections for the year 55 took place.\r\nThis Domitius, L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, was consul B.C. 54. In the\r\nquarrel between Pompeius and Cæsar, he joined Pompeius, and after\r\nvarious adventures finally he lost his life in the battle of Pharsalus\r\nB.C. 48.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: The first 'house' ([Greek: oikia] οἰκία) is evidently\r\nthe house of Domitius. The second house ([Greek: oikêma] οἴκημα),\r\nwhich may be more properly rendered 'chamber,' may, as Sintenis says,\r\nmean the Senate-house, if the reading is right. Kaltwasser takes the\r\nsecond house to be the same as the first house; and he refers to the\r\nLife of Pompeius, c. 51, 52, where the same story is told.\r\n\r\nIn place of [Greek: oikêma] οἴκημα some critics have read [Greek:\r\nbêma] βῆμα the Rostra.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: Appian (_Civil Wars_, ii. 18) says that Pompeius\r\nreceived Iberia and Libya. The Romans had now two provinces in the\r\nSpanish peninsula, Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, and Ulterior or\r\nBætica. This arrangement, by which the whole power of the state was\r\ndistributed among Pompeius, Crassus and Cæsar, was in effect a\r\nrevolution, and the immediate cause of the wars which followed.\r\n\r\nAppian (_Civil Wars_, ii. 18) after speaking of Crassus going on his\r\nParthian expedition in which he lost his life, adds, \"but the Parthian\r\nHistory will show forth the calamity of Crassus.\" Appian wrote a\r\nParthian History; but that which is now extant under the name is\r\nmerely an extract from Plutarch's Life of Crassus, beginning with the\r\nsixteenth chapter: which extract is followed by another from\r\nPlutarch's Life of Antonius. The compiler of this Parthian History has\r\nput at the head of it a few words of introduction. The extract from\r\nCrassus is sometimes useful for the various readings which it offers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: This wife was Cæsar's daughter Julia, whom Pompeius\r\nmarried in Cæsar's consulship (Vell. Paterc. ii. 44). She was nearly\r\ntwenty-three years younger than Pompeius. Julia died B.C. 54, after\r\ngiving birth to a son, who died soon after her. She possessed beauty\r\nand a good disposition. The people, with whom she was a favourite, had\r\nher buried in the Field of Mars. See the Lives of Pompeius and Cæsar.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: That is the Lex which prolonged Cæsar's government for\r\nfive years and gave Iberia (Spain) and Syria to Pompeius and Crassus\r\nfor the same period. The Lex was proposed by the Tribune Titus\r\nTrebonius (Livius, _Epitome_, 105; Dion Cassius, 39. c. 33).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: C. Ateius Capito Gallus and his brother tribune P.\r\nAquillius Gallius were strong opponents of Pompeius and Crassus at\r\nthis critical time. Crassus left Rome for his Parthian campaign at the\r\nclose of B.C. 55, before the expiration of his consulship (Clinton,\r\n_Fasti_, B.C. 54).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: We learn that Crassus sailed from Brundisium (Brindisi),\r\nthe usual place of embarkation for Asia, but we are told nothing more\r\nof his course till we find him in Galatia, talking to old Deiotarus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: Zenodotia or Zenodotium, a city of the district\r\nOsrhoene, and near the town of Nikephorium. These were Greek cities\r\nfounded by the Macedonians. I have mistranslated the first part of\r\nthis passage of Plutarch from not referring at the time to Dion\r\nCassius (40. c. 13) who tells the story thus:--\"The inhabitants of\r\nZenodotium sent for some of the Romans, pretending that they intended\r\nto join them like the rest; but when the men were within the city,\r\nthey cut off their retreat and killed them; and this was the reason\r\nwhy their city was destroyed.\" The literal version of Plutarch's text\r\nwill be the true one. \"But in one of them, of which Apollonius was\r\ntyrant, a hundred of his soldiers were put to death, upon,\" &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: This was his son Publius, who is often mentioned in\r\nCæsar's Gallic War.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: See Life of Lucullus, c. 22.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Hierapolis or the 'Holy City' was also called Bambyke\r\nand Edessa. Strabo places it four schoeni from the west bank of the\r\nEuphrates. The goddess who was worshipped here was called Atargatis or\r\nAstarte. Lucian speaks of the goddess and her temple and ceremonial in\r\nhis treatise 'On the Syrian Goddess' (iii. p. 451, ed. Hemsterhuis).\r\nLucian had visited the place. Josephus adds (_Jewish Antiq._ xiv. 7)\r\nthat Crassus stripped the temple of Jerusalem of all its valuables to\r\nthe amount of ten thousand talents. The winter occupation of the Roman\r\ngeneral was more profitable than his campaign the following year\r\nturned out.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: This was a general name of the Parthian kings, and\r\nprobably was used as a kind of title. The dynasty was called the\r\nArsakidæ. The name Arsakes occurs among the Persian names in the Persæ\r\nof Aeschylus. Pott (_Etymologische Forschungen_, ii. 272) conjectures\r\nthat the word means 'King of the Arii,' or 'the noble King.' The\r\nprefix _Ar_ or _Ari_ is very common in Persian names, as Ariamnes,\r\nAriomardus, and others.\r\n\r\nPlutarch in other passages of the Life of Crassus calls this Arsakes,\r\nHyrodes, and other authorities call him Orodes. He is classed as\r\nArsakes XIV. Orodes I. of Parthia, by those who have attempted to form\r\na regular series of the Parthian kings.\r\n\r\nCrassus replied that he would give his answer in Seleukeia, the large\r\ncity on the Tigris, which was nearly pure Greek. The later Parthian\r\ncapital was Ktesiphon, in the neighbourhood of Seleukeia, on the east\r\nbank of the Tigris and about twenty miles from Bagdad. The foundation\r\nof Ktesiphon is attributed by Ammianus Marcellinus (xxiii. 6, ed.\r\nGronov.) to Bardanes, who was a contemporary of the Roman emperor\r\nNero, if he is the Arsakes Bardanes who appears in the list of\r\nParthian kings. But Ktesiphon is mentioned by Polybius in his fifth\r\nbook, in the wars of Antiochus and Molon, and consequently it existed\r\nin the time of Crassus, though it is not mentioned in his Life.\r\nKtesiphon is mentioned by Dion Cassius (40. c. 14) in his history of\r\nthe campaign of Crassus, but this alone would not prove that Ktesiphon\r\nexisted at that time.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: The Greek word here and at the beginning of ch. xix.,\r\ntranslated 'mailed' by Mr. Long, always refers to cuirassed cavalry\r\nsoldiers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: C.

Antonius.\r\nc. 39, 50.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: Zeugma means the Bridge. Seleukus Nikator is said to\r\nhave established a bridge of boats here, in order to connect the\r\nopposite bank with Apameia, a city which he built on the east side of\r\nthe Euphrates (Plinius, _Hist. Nat._ v. 24). Zeugma afterwards was a\r\nusual place for crossing the river; but a bridge of boats could hardly\r\nbe permanently kept there, and it appears that Crassus had to\r\nconstruct a raft. Zeugma is either upon or near the site of Bir, which\r\nis in about 37° N. Lat.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: Probably these great hurricanes are not uncommon on the\r\nEuphrates. In the year 1831 a gale sent Colonel Chesney's \"little\r\nvessel to the bottom of the river;\" but a still greater calamity befel\r\nthe Tigris steamer in the Euphrates expedition which was under the\r\ncommand of Colonel Chesney, in May 1836. A little after one P.M. a\r\nstorm appeared bringing with it clouds of sand from the\r\nwest-north-west. The two steam-boats the Tigris and the Euphrates were\r\nthen passing over the rocks of Es-Geria, which were deeply covered\r\nwith water. The Euphrates was safely secured; but the Tigris, being\r\ndirected against the bank, struck with great violence; the wind\r\nsuddenly veered round and drove her bow off; \"this rendered it quite\r\nimpossible to secure the vessel to the bank, along which she was blown\r\nrapidly by the heavy gusts; her head falling off into the stream as\r\nshe passed close to the Euphrates, which vessel had been backed\r\nopportunely to avoid the concussion.\" The Tigris perished in this\r\nviolent hurricane and twenty men were lost in her. The storm lasted\r\nabout eight minutes. Colonel Chesney escaped by swimming to the shore\r\njust before the vessel went down: he was fortunate \"to take a\r\ndirection which brought him to the land, without having seen anything\r\nwhatever to guide him through the darkness worse than that of\r\nnight.\"--\"For an instant,\" says Colonel Chesney after getting to land,\r\n\"I saw the keel of the Tigris uppermost (near the stern); she went\r\ndown bow foremost, and having struck the bottom in that position, she\r\nprobably turned round on the bow as a pivot, and thus showed part of\r\nher keel for an instant at the other extremity; but her paddle beams,\r\nfloats, and parts of the sides were already broken up, and actually\r\nfloated ashore, so speedy and terrific had been the work of\r\ndestruction.\" (Letter from Colonel Chesney to Sir J. Hobhouse, 28th\r\nMay, 1836; Euphrates Expedition Papers printed by order of the House\r\nof Commons, 17th July, 1837.)\r\n\r\nAmmianus Marcellinus (xxiv. 1) speaks of a violent storm at Anatha\r\n(Annah) on the Euphrates, during the expedition of the Emperor Julian.\r\nIt blew down the tents and stretched the soldiers on the ground.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: A place struck with lightning was considered religious\r\n(religiosus), that is, it could no longer be used for common purposes.\r\n\"The deity,\" says Festus (v. _Fulguritum_), \"was supposed to have\r\nappropriated it to himself.\"\r\n\r\nDion Cassius (40. c. 17, &c.) gives the story of the passage of the\r\nriver. The eagle, according to him, was very obstinate. It stuck fast\r\nin the ground, as if it was planted there; and when it was forced up\r\nby the soldiers, it went along very unwillingly.\r\n\r\nThe Roman eagle was fixed at one end of a long shaft of wood, which\r\nhad a sharp point at the other end for the purpose of fixing it in the\r\nground. The eagle was gold, or gilded metal; and, according to Dion\r\nCassius, it was kept in a small moveable case or consecrated chapel.\r\nThe eagle was not moved from the winter encampment, unless the whole\r\narmy was put in motion. The Vexilla ([Greek: sêmeia] σημεῖα of the\r\nGreek writers) were what we call the colours.\r\n\r\n(See the note of Reimarus on Dion Cassius, 40. c. 18.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: Dion Cassius (40. c. 20), who tells the story, names the\r\nman Augarus.

He adds that\r\nthe chief part of the army of Crassus made their escape.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: The story of molten gold being poured into the mouth of\r\nthe head of Crassus is given by Dion Cassius as a report.

The work of Aristeides was\r\nknown to Ovidius (_Tristia,_ ii. 413, 443), who attempts to defend his\r\nown amatory poetry by the example of Sisenna, who translated an\r\nobscene book.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: Probably there is an error in the name: Roscius has been\r\nproposed as the probable reading.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: Plutarch is alluding to the fable of the two wallets,\r\nwhich every man carries, one in front with his neighbours' faults in\r\nit, and the other behind containing his own.

Several instances\r\nare mentioned by Herodotus.

Elmsley. The exact meaning of the word [Greek: helika] ἕλικα in\r\nthe passage is uncertain. See Elmsley's note.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: The word is Exodium ([Greek: exodion] ἐξόδιον), a kind\r\nof entertainment common among the Romans, though it is a Greek word.\r\nPlutarch means that this exhibition before the kings was like the\r\nfarce which is acted after a tragedy. It seems as if Jason was first\r\nplaying the part of Agave, and was then going to play that of\r\nPentheus; but on seeing the head he put aside the mask and dress of\r\nPentheus, and recited the words of the frantic mother. Plutarch\r\nsometimes leaves things in a kind of mist: he gives his reader\r\nopportunity for conjecture.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: Pacorus was completely defeated B.C. 38 near the\r\nEuphrates by P. Ventidius Bassus, who was the legatus of M. Antonius.\r\nPacorus lost his life in the battle (Dion Cassius, 49. c. 20;\r\nPlutarch, _Life of Antonius_, c. 34). It is said that Pacorus fell on\r\nthe same day on which Crassus lost his life fifteen years before, the\r\n9th of June (Dion Cassius, 49. c. 21, and the note of Reimarus).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: He began his reign under the name of Arsakes XV.\r\nPhraates IV., according to some authorities, B.C. 37. He was not\r\nsatisfied with murdering his father: he murdered his brothers, and\r\nmany distinguished Parthians. His name occurs again in Plutarch's Life\r\nof Antonius. Phraates delivered up to Augustus, B.C. 20, the Roman\r\nsoldiers, eagles, and standards which had been taken by Crassus; an\r\nevent which is commemorated by extant medals, and was recorded by\r\nAugustus among his other exploits in the Monumentum Ancyranum.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: This is the Greek word ([Greek: akoniton] ὰκόνιτον): the\r\nsame name is now given to Monkshood or Wolfsbane, a genus of\r\nRanunculaceae. Aconite is now used as a medicine; \"The best forms are\r\neither an alcoholic extract of the leaves, or an alcoholic tincture of\r\nthe root made by displacement.\" It is a poisonous plant, and death has\r\nfollowed from the careless use of it (\"Aconite,\" _Penny Cyclopædia_\r\nand _Supplement_ to the _P. Cyc._).\r\n\r\nWith this farce, as Plutarch remarks, the history of Crassus\r\nterminates. If Plutarch designed to make Crassus contemptible, he has\r\ncertainly succeeded. And there is nothing in other authorities to\r\ninduce us to think that he has done Crassus injustice. With some good\r\nqualities and his moderate abilities, he might have been a respectable\r\nman in a private station. But insatiable avarice, and that curse of\r\nmany men, ambition without the ability that can ensure success and\r\ncommand respect, made Crassus a fool in his old age, and brought him\r\nto an ignominious end.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF NIKIAS AND CRASSUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. In the first place, the wealth of Nikias was much more honestly and\r\ncreditably obtained than that of Crassus. Generally speaking, one\r\ncannot approve of men who make their money from mines, which are as a\r\nrule worked by criminals, or savages, labouring in chains in unhealthy\r\nsubterranean dungeons; but yet this method of amassing a fortune seems\r\nmuch the more honourable, when compared with Crassus's purchase of\r\nconfiscated lands and his habit of bidding for houses that were on\r\nfire. Crassus too used to practise these openly, like a trade: while\r\nhe was also accused of taking bribes for his speeches in the Senate,\r\nof defrauding the allies of Rome, of currying favour with great ladies\r\nand assisting them to shield offenders from justice. Nothing of this\r\nsort was ever laid to the charge of Nikias, who, however, was\r\nridiculed for giving money to common informers because he feared their\r\ntongues. Yet this action of his, though it would have been a disgrace\r\nto Perikles, or Aristeides, was a necessity for Nikias, who was\r\nnaturally of a timid disposition. Thus Lykurgus the orator excused\r\nhimself when accused of having bought off some informers who\r\nthreatened him. \"I am glad,\" said he, \"that after so long a public\r\nlife as mine I should have been at last convicted of giving bribes\r\nrather than of receiving them.\"\r\n\r\nThe expenditure of Nikias was all calculated to increase his\r\npopularity in the state, being devoted to offerings to the gods,\r\ngymnastic contests and public dramatic performances. But all the money\r\nhe spent that way, and all that he possessed was but a small part of\r\nwhat Crassus bestowed upon a public feast at Rome for some tens of\r\nthousands of guests, whom he even maintained at his own cost for some\r\ntime after. So true it is that wickedness and vice argue a want of\r\ndue balance and proportion in a man's mind, which leads him to acquire\r\nwealth dishonestly, and then to squander it uselessly.\r\n\r\nII. So much for their riches. Now in their political life, Nikias\r\nnever did anything bold, daring or unjust, for he was outwitted by\r\nAlkibiades, and always stood in fear of the popular assembly. Crassus,\r\non the other hand, is accused of great inconsistency, in lightly\r\nchanging from one party to another, and he himself never denied that\r\nhe once obtained the consulship by hiring men to assassinate Cato and\r\nDomitius. And in the assembly held for the dividing for the provinces,\r\nmany were wounded and four men slain in the Forum, while Crassus\r\nhimself (which I have forgotten to mention in his Life) struck one\r\nLucius Annalius, a speaker on the other side, so violent a blow with\r\nhis fist that his face was covered with blood. But though Crassus was\r\noverbearing and tyrannical in his public life, yet we cannot deny that\r\nthe shrinking timidity and cowardice of Nikias deserve equally severe\r\ncensure; and it must be remembered that when Crassus was carrying\r\nmatters with so high a hand, it was no Kleon or Hyperbolus that he had\r\nfor an antagonist, but the great Julius Cæsar himself, and Pompeius\r\nwho had triumphed three several times, and that he gave way to neither\r\nof them, but became their equal in power, and even excelled Pompeius\r\nin dignity by obtaining the office of censor. A great politician\r\nshould not try to avoid unpopularity, but to gain such power and\r\nreputation as will enable him to rise above it.\r\n\r\nYet if it were true that Nikias preferred quiet and security to\r\nanything else, and that he stood in fear of Alkibiades in the\r\nassembly, of the Spartans at Pylus, and of Perdikkas in Thrace, he had\r\nevery opportunity to repose himself in Athens and to \"weave the\r\ngarland of a peaceful life,\" as some philosopher calls it. He had\r\nindeed a true and divine love of peace, and his attempt to bring the\r\nPeloponnesian war to an end, was an act of real Hellenic patriotism.\r\nIn this respect Crassus cannot be compared with Nikias, not though he\r\nhad carried the frontier of the Roman empire as far as the Caspian and\r\nthe Indian seas.\r\n\r\nIII. Yet a statesman, in a country which appreciates his merits,\r\nought not when at the height of his power to make way for worthless\r\nmen, and place in office those who have no claim to it, as Nikias did\r\nwhen he laid down his own office of commander-in-chief and gave it to\r\nKleon, a man who possessed no qualification whatever for the post\r\nexcept his brazen effrontery. Neither can I praise Crassus for having\r\nso rashly and hurriedly brought the war with Spartacus to a crisis,\r\nalthough he was actuated by an honourable ambition in fearing that\r\nPompeius would arrive and take from him the glory of having completed\r\nthe war, as Mummius took from Marcellus the glory of winning Corinth.\r\nBut on the other hand the conduct of Nikias was altogether monstrous\r\nand inexcusable. He did not give up his honourable post to his enemy\r\nat a time when there was hope of success and little peril. He saw that\r\ngreat danger was likely to be incurred by the general in command at\r\nPylus, and yet he was content to place himself in safety, and let the\r\nstate run the risk of ruin, by entrusting an incompetent person with\r\nthe sole management of affairs. Yet Themistokles, rather than allow an\r\nignorant commander to mismanage the war against Persia, bribed him to\r\nlay down his office. So also Cato at a most dangerous crisis became a\r\ncandidate for the office of tribune of the people in order to serve\r\nhis country. But Nikias, reserving himself to play the general at the\r\nexpense of the village of Minoa, the island of Kythera, and the\r\nmiserable inhabitants of Melos,[100] when it came to fighting the\r\nLacedæmonians eagerly stripped off his general's cloak, and entrusted\r\nto an inexperienced and reckless man like Kleon, the conduct of an\r\nenterprise involving the safety of a large Athenian fleet and army,\r\nshowing himself no less neglectful of his own honour than he was of\r\nthe interests of his country. After this he was forced against his\r\nwill into the war with Syracuse, in which he seems to have imagined\r\nthat his army would capture the city by remaining before it doing\r\nnothing, and not by vigorous attacks. No doubt it is a great testimony\r\nto the esteem in which he was held by his countrymen, that he was\r\nalways opposed to war and unwilling to act as general, and was\r\nnevertheless always forced by them to undertake that office: whereas\r\nCrassus, who always wished for an independent command, never obtained\r\none except in the servile war, and then only because all the other\r\ngenerals, Pompeius, Metellus, and Lucullus, were absent. Yet at that\r\ntime Crassus was at the height of his power and reputation: but his\r\nfriends seem to have thought him, as the comic poet has it,\r\n\r\n     \"Most excellent, save in the battle-field.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in his case also, the Romans gained no advantage from his\r\nambitious desire of command. The Athenians sent Nikias to Sicily\r\nagainst his will, and Crassus led the Romans to Parthia against their\r\nwill. Nikias suffered by the actions of the Athenians, while Rome\r\nsuffered by the actions of Crassus.\r\n\r\nIV. However, in their last moments we incline rather to praise Nikias\r\nthan to blame Crassus. Nikias, a skilful and experienced commander,\r\ndid not share the rash hopes of his countrymen, but never thought that\r\nSicily could be conquered, and dissuaded them from making the attempt.\r\nCrassus, on the other hand, urged the Romans to undertake the war with\r\nParthia, representing the conquest of that country as an easy\r\noperation, which he nevertheless failed to effect. His ambition was\r\nvast. Cæsar had conquered the Gauls, Germans, Britons, and all the\r\nwest of Europe, and Crassus wished in his turn to march eastward as\r\nfar as the Indian Ocean, and to conquer all those regions of Asia\r\nwhich Pompeius and Lucullus, two great men and actuated by a like\r\ndesire for conquest, had previously aspired to subdue. Yet they also\r\nmet with a like opposition. When Pompeius was given an unlimited\r\ncommand in the East, the appointment was opposed by the Senate, and\r\nwhen Cæsar routed thirty thousand Germans, Cato proposed that he\r\nshould be delivered up to the vanquished, and that thus the anger of\r\nthe gods should be turned away from the city upon the author of so\r\ngreat a crime as he had committed by breaking his word. Yet the Romans\r\nslighted Cato's proposals and held a solemn thanksgiving for fifteen\r\ndays to show their joy at the news. How many days then must we imagine\r\nthey would have spent in rejoicing if Crassus had sent despatches\r\nannouncing the capture of Babylon, and then had reduced Media, Persia,\r\nHyrkania, Susa, and Bactria to the condition of Roman provinces. \"If a\r\nman must do wrong,\" as Euripides says of those who cannot live in\r\npeace, and be contented when they are well off, they should do it on a\r\ngrand scale like this, not capture contemptible places like Skandeia\r\nor Mende, or chase the people of Ægina, like birds who have been\r\nturned out of their nests. If we are to do an injustice, let us not do\r\nit in a miserable pettifogging way, but imitate such great examples as\r\nCrassus and Alexander the Great. Those who praise the one of these\r\ngreat men, and blame the other, do so only because they are unable to\r\nsee any other distinction between them except that the one failed and\r\nthe other succeeded.\r\n\r\nV. When acting as general, Nikias did many great exploits, for he was\r\nmany times victorious, all but took Syracuse, and ought not justly to\r\nbear the blame of the whole Sicilian disaster, because of his disease,\r\nand the ill will which some bore him at Athens. Crassus on the other\r\nhand committed so many mistakes as to put it out of the power of\r\nfortune to aid him, so that one wonders not so much that his folly was\r\novercome by the Parthians as that it could overcome the good fortune\r\nof the Romans. Now as the one never disregarded religious observances\r\nand omens, the other despised them all, and yet both alike perished,\r\nit is hard to say what inference we ought to draw, as to which acted\r\nmost wisely, yet we must incline rather to the side of him who\r\nfollowed the established rule in such matters rather than that of him\r\nwho insolently discarded all such observances. In his death Crassus is\r\nmore to be commended, because he yielded himself against his will in\r\nconsequence of the entreaties of his friends, and was most\r\ntreacherously deceived by the enemy, while Nikias delivered himself up\r\nto his enemies through a base and cowardly desire to save his life,\r\nand thus made his end more infamous.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: I cannot find that Nikias took any part in the massacre\r\nof the people of Melos in 416 B.C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF SERTORIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. It is perhaps not a matter of surprise, if in the lapse of time,\r\nwhich is unlimited, while fortune[101] is continually changing her\r\ncourse, spontaneity should often result in the same incidents; for, if\r\nthe number of elemental things is not limited, fortune has in the\r\nabundance of material a bountiful supply of sameness of results; and,\r\nif things are implicated in a dependence upon definite numbers, it is\r\nof necessity that the same things must often happen, being effected by\r\nthe same means. Now, as some are pleased to collect, by inquiry and\r\nhearsay, from among the things which accidentally happen, such as\r\nbear some likeness to the works of calculation and forethought: such,\r\nfor instance, as that there were two celebrated Atteis,[102] the one a\r\nSyrian and the other an Arcadian, and that both were killed by a wild\r\nboar; that there were two Actæons, one of whom was torn in pieces by\r\nhis dogs and the other by his lovers; that there were two\r\nScipios,[103] by one of whom the Carthaginians were first conquered,\r\nand by the other were cut up root and branch; that Troy was taken by\r\nHercules, on account of the horses of Laomedon, and by Agamemnon by\r\nmeans of the wooden horse, as it is called, and was taken a third time\r\nby Charidemus, by reason of the Ilians not being able to close the\r\ngates quick enough, owing to a horse having got between them; that\r\nthere are two cities which have the same name with the most fragrant\r\nof plants, Ios[104] and Smyrna, and that Homer was born in one of them\r\nand died in the other: I may be allowed to add to these instances,\r\nthat the most warlike of commanders and those who have accomplished\r\nmost by a union of daring and cunning, have been one-eyed men,\r\nPhilippus,[105] Antigonus, Annibal, and the subject of this\r\nLife--Sertorius; he whom one may affirm to have been more continent as\r\nto women than Philip, more true to his friends than Antigonus, more\r\nmerciful to his enemies than Annibal,[106] inferior in understanding\r\nto none of them, but in fortune inferior to all; and, though he always\r\nfound Fortune more hard to deal with than his open enemies, yet he\r\nproved himself her equal by opposing the experience of Metellus, the\r\ndaring of Pompeius, the fortune of Sulla, and the power of the whole\r\nRoman state; a fugitive and a stranger putting himself at the head of\r\nbarbarians. Of all the Greeks, Eumenes[107] of Kardia presents the\r\nnearest resemblance to him. Both of them were men qualified to\r\ncommand; both were warlike, and yet full of stratagem; both became\r\nexiles from their native land and the commanders of foreign troops;\r\nand both had the same violent and unjust fortune in their end, for\r\nboth of them were the objects of conspiracy, and were cut off by the\r\nhands of those with whom they were victorious over their enemies.\r\n\r\nII. Quintus Sertorius belonged to a family not among the meanest in\r\nNussa,[108] a Sabine city. He was carefully brought up by a widowed\r\nmother, for he had lost his father, and he appears to have been\r\nexceedingly attached to her. His mother's name, they say, was Rhea. He\r\nhad a competent practical education in the courts of justice, and, as\r\na young man, he attained some influence in the city by his eloquence.\r\nBut his reputation and success in war diverted all his ambition in\r\nthat direction.\r\n\r\nIII. Now, first of all, after the Cimbri and Teutones had invaded\r\nGaul, he was serving under Cæpio[109] at the time when the Romans were\r\ndefeated and put to flight; and, though he lost his horse and was\r\nwounded in the body, he crossed the Rhone swimming in his cuirass and\r\nwith his shield against the powerful stream--so strong was his body\r\nand disciplined by exercise. On a second occasion, when the same\r\nbarbarians were advancing with many thousand men and dreadful threats,\r\nso that for a Roman to stand to his ranks at such a time, and to obey\r\nhis general, was a great matter, Marius had the command, and Sertorius\r\nundertook to be a spy upon the enemy. Putting on a Celtic dress, and\r\nmaking himself master of the most ordinary expressions of the\r\nlanguage, for the purpose of conversation when occasion might offer,\r\nhe mingled with the barbarians, and, either by his own eyes or by\r\ninquiry, learning all that was important to know, he returned to\r\nMarius. For this he obtained the prize of merit; and in the rest of\r\nthe campaign, having given many proofs of his judgment and daring, he\r\nwas honoured and trusted by his general. After the close of the war\r\nwith the Cimbri and Teutones, he was sent as tribune by Didius[110]\r\nthe prætor to Iberia, and he wintered in Castlo,[111] a city of the\r\nCeltiberi. The soldiers, being in the midst of abundance, lost all\r\ndiscipline, and were generally drunk, which brought them into contempt\r\nwith the barbarians, who, by night, sent for aid from their neighbours\r\nthe Gyrisœni, and, coming on the soldiers in their lodgings, began to\r\nslaughter them. Sertorius with a few others stole out, and, collecting\r\nthe soldiers who made their escape, surrounded the city. Finding the\r\ngates open through which the barbarians had secretly entered, he did\r\nnot make the same mistake that they did, but he set a watch there,\r\nand, hemming in the city on all sides, he massacred every man who was\r\nof age to bear arms. When the massacre was over, he ordered all his\r\nsoldiers to lay down their own armour and dress, and, putting on those\r\nof the barbarians, to follow him to the city from which the men came\r\nwho had fallen on them in the night. The barbarians were deceived by\r\nthe armour, and he found the gates open, and a number of men expecting\r\nto meet friends and fellow-citizens, returning from a successful\r\nexpedition. Accordingly, most of them were killed by the Romans near\r\nthe gates, and the rest surrendered and were sold as slaves.\r\n\r\nIV. This made the name of Sertorius known in Iberia; and as soon as he\r\nreturned to Rome he was appointed quæstor in Gaul upon the Padus at a\r\ncritical time; for the Marsic[112] war was threatening. Being\r\ncommissioned to levy troops and procure arms, he applied so much zeal\r\nand expedition to the work, compared with the tardiness and indolence\r\nof the other young men, that he got the reputation of being a man\r\nlikely to run an active career. Yet he remitted nothing of the daring\r\nof a soldier after he was promoted to the rank of commander; but he\r\nexhibited wonderful feats of courage, and exposed himself without any\r\nreserve to danger, whereby he lost one of his eyes through a wound.\r\nBut he always prided himself on this. He used to say that others did\r\nnot always carry about with them the proofs of their valour, but put\r\nthem aside, at times, as chains and spears, and crowns, while the\r\nproofs of his valour always abided with him, and those who saw what he\r\nhad lost saw at the same time the evidences of his courage. The people\r\nalso showed him appropriate marks of respect; for, on his entering the\r\ntheatre, they received him with clapping of hands and expressions of\r\ntheir good wishes--testimonials which even those who were far advanced\r\nin age, and high in rank, could with difficulty obtain. However, when\r\nhe was a candidate for the tribuneship, Sulla raised a party against\r\nhim, and he failed; and this was, apparently, the reason why he hated\r\nSulla. But when Marius was overpowered by Sulla and fled from Rome,\r\nand Sulla had set out to fight with Mithridates, and the consul\r\nOctavius adhered to the party of Sulla, while his colleague Cinna, who\r\naimed at a revolution, revived the drooping faction of Marius,\r\nSertorius attached himself to Cinna, especially as he saw that\r\nOctavius was deficient in activity, and he distrusted the friends of\r\nMarius. A great battle was fought in the Forum between the consuls, in\r\nwhich Octavius got the victory, and Cinna and Sertorius took to\r\nflight, having lost nearly ten thousand men. However, they persuaded\r\nmost of the troops, which were still scattered about Italy, to come\r\nover to their side, and they were soon a match for Octavius.\r\n\r\nV. When Marius had returned from Libya, and was proposing to join\r\nCinna, himself in a mere private capacity and Cinna as consul, all the\r\nrest thought it politic to receive him; but Sertorius was against it:\r\nwhether it was because he thought that Cinna would pay less respect to\r\nhim when a general of higher reputation was present, or because he\r\nfeared the ferocious temper of Marius, and that he would put all in\r\nconfusion in his passion, which knew no bounds, transgressing the\r\nlimits of justice in the midst of victory. However this may be,\r\nSertorius observed that there remained little for them to do, as they\r\nwere now triumphant; but if they received the proposal of Marius, he\r\nwould appropriate to himself all the glory and all the troops, being a\r\nman who could endure no partner in power, and who was devoid of good\r\nfaith. Cinna replied that what Sertorius suggested was true, but he\r\nfelt ashamed and had a difficulty about refusing to receive Marius,\r\nafter having invited him to join their party; whereupon Sertorius\r\nrejoined: \"For my part, I thought that Marius had come to Italy on his\r\nown adventure, and I was merely considering what was best; but it was\r\nnot honourable in you to make the thing a matter of deliberation at\r\nall after the arrival of the man whom you had thought proper to\r\ninvite, but you ought to have employed him and received him; for a\r\npromise leaves no room for any further consideration.\" Accordingly\r\nCinna sent for Marius, and the forces being distributed among them,\r\nthe three had the command. The war being finished, Cinna and Marius\r\nwere filled with violence and bitterness, so that they made the evils\r\nof war as precious gold to the Romans, compared with the new state of\r\naffairs. Sertorius alone is said to have put no person to death to\r\ngratify his vengeance, nor to have abused his power; but he was much\r\nannoyed at the conduct of Marius, and he moderated Cinna by private\r\ninterviews and entreaties. At last, the slaves whom Marius had used as\r\nallies in war, and kept as guards to protect his tyranny, becoming\r\nformidable and wealthy, partly from the grants of Marius and his\r\ndirect permission; partly from their violent and outrageous treatment\r\nof their masters, whom they butchered, and then lay with their\r\nmasters' wives, and violated their children, Sertorius unable to\r\nendure any longer, speared the whole of them in their camp, to the\r\nnumber of four thousand.[113] VI. But when Marius[114] had died, and\r\nCinna shortly after was cut off, and the younger Marius, contrary to\r\nthe wish of Sertorius, and by illegal means, obtained the consulship,\r\nand the Carbos and the Norbani and Scipios were unsuccessfully\r\ncontending against Sulla on his march to Rome, and affairs were being\r\nruined, partly through the cowardice and laziness of the commanders,\r\nand partly through treachery; and there was no use in his staying to\r\nsee things still go on badly, owing to the want of judgment in those\r\nwho had more power than himself; and finally, when Sulla, after\r\nencamping near Scipio, and holding out friendly proposals, as if peace\r\nwas going to be made, had corrupted the army, though Sertorius had\r\nwarned Scipio of this, and given his advice, but without\r\neffect--altogether despairing about the city, Sertorius set out for\r\nIberia, in order that if he should anticipate his enemies in\r\nstrengthening his power there, he might offer protection to such of\r\nhis friends as were unfortunate at Rome. Sertorius, having fallen in\r\nwith bad weather in the mountainous parts, was required by the\r\nbarbarians to pay them a tribute, and to purchase a free passage. His\r\ncompanions were much incensed at this, and declared it to be a great\r\ndegradation for a Roman proconsul[115] to pay a tribute to wretched\r\nbarbarians; but Sertorius cared little for what they considered\r\ndisgrace, and he said that he was buying time, the rarest of things\r\nfor a man who was aiming at great objects: and so he pacified the\r\nbarbarians with money, and hurrying into Iberia, got possession of the\r\ncountry. He there found nations strong in numbers and fighting men,\r\nbut owing to the greediness and tyranny of the governors who had from\r\ntime to time been sent among them, ill-disposed to the Roman\r\nadministration in general; however, he regained the good will of the\r\nchiefs by his personal intercourse with them, and the favour of the\r\nmass by remission of taxes. But he got most popularity by relieving\r\nthe people from having soldiers quartered on them; for he compelled\r\nthe soldiers to fix their winter tents in the suburbs of the towns,\r\nand he was the first to set the example. However, Sertorius did not\r\ndepend altogether on the attachment of the barbarians, but he armed\r\nall the Roman settlers in Iberia who were able to bear arms, and by\r\ncommencing the construction of all kinds of military engines and\r\nbuilding ships he kept the cities in check; showing himself mild in\r\nall the affairs of civil administration, but formidable by his\r\npreparations against the enemy.\r\n\r\nVII. Hearing that Sulla was master of Rome,[116] and that the party of\r\nMarius and Carbo was on the wane, and being in immediate expectation\r\nof an army coming to fight against him under some commander, he sent\r\nJulius Salinator to occupy the passes of the Pyrenees, with six\r\nthousand heavy armed soldiers. Shortly after this, Caius Annius[117]\r\nwas sent from Rome by Sulla; but, seeing that the position of Julius\r\ncould not be attacked, he was perplexed, and seated himself at the\r\nbase of the mountains. But one Calpurnius, named Lanarius,\r\nassassinated Julius, on which the soldiers left the summits of the\r\nPyrenees, and Annius, crossing the mountains, advanced with a large\r\nforce and drove all before him. Sertorius, being unable to oppose him,\r\nfled with three thousand men to New Carthage,[118] and there embarking\r\nand crossing the sea, landed in Mauritania, in Libya. His soldiers,\r\nwhile getting water without due precautions, were fallen upon by the\r\nbarbarians, and many of them were killed, upon which Sertorius sailed\r\nagain for Iberia. He was, however, driven off the coast, and, being\r\njoined by some Cilician piratical vessels,[119] he attacked the\r\nisland of Pityussa,[120] and landing there drove out the garrison of\r\nAnnius. Annius soon arrived with a large fleet and five thousand heavy\r\narmed men, and Sertorius ventured on a naval battle with him, though\r\nhis vessels were light and built for quick sailing and not for\r\nfighting; but the sea was disturbed by a strong west wind, which drove\r\nmost of the vessels of Sertorius upon the reefs, owing to their\r\nlightness, and Sertorius, with a few ships, could not get out to sea\r\nby reason of the wind, nor land on account of the enemy, and being\r\ntossed about for ten days, with the wind and a violent sea against\r\nhim, he held out with great difficulty.\r\n\r\nVIII. As the wind abated he set sail, and put in at some scattered\r\nislands, which had no water. Leaving them, and passing through the\r\nStraits of Gades,[121] he touched at those parts of Iberia on the\r\nright which lie out of the strait, a little beyond the mouths of the\r\nBætis,[122] which flows into the Atlantic Sea,[123] and has given name\r\nto those parts of Iberia which lie about it. There he fell in with\r\nsome sailors, who had returned from a voyage to the Atlantic[124]\r\nIslands, which are two in number, separated by a very narrow channel,\r\nand ten thousand stadia from the coast of Libya, and are called the\r\nislands of the Happy. These islands have only moderate rains, but\r\ngenerally they enjoy gentle breezes, which bring dews; they have a\r\nrich and fertile soil, adapted for arable cultivation and planting;\r\nthey also produce fruit spontaneously, sufficient in quantity and\r\nquality to maintain, without labour and trouble, a population at their\r\nease. The air of the island is agreeable, owing to the temperature of\r\nthe seasons, and the slightness of the changes; for the winds which\r\nblow from our part of the world from the north and east, owing to the\r\ngreat distance, fall upon a boundless space, and are dispersed and\r\nfail before they reach these islands; but the winds which blow round\r\nthem from the ocean, the south and west, bring soft rains at\r\nintervals, from the sea, but in general they gently cool the island\r\nwith moist clear weather, and nourish the plants; so that a firm\r\npersuasion has reached the barbarians that here are the Elysian Plains\r\nand the abode of the Happy which Homer[125] has celebrated in song.\r\n\r\nIX. Sertorius, hearing this description, was seized with a strong\r\ndesire to dwell in the islands, and to live in quiet, free from\r\ntyranny and never-ending wars. The Cilicians, who did not want peace\r\nand leisure, but wealth and spoil, observing this inclination, sailed\r\noff to Africa, to restore Ascalis, the son of Iphtha, to the Moorish\r\nkingdom.[126] Sertorius, however, did not despond, but he determined\r\nto help those who were fighting against Ascalis, in order that his\r\ncompanions, by getting some renewal of hope and opportunity for other\r\ndeeds, might not disperse through their difficulties. The Moors were\r\nwell pleased at his arrival, and Sertorius setting himself to work\r\ndefeated Ascalis, and besieged him. Sulla sent Paccianus to help\r\nAscalis, but Sertorius engaging him with his forces killed Paccianus,\r\nand after his victory brought over the army and took Tigennis, to\r\nwhich Ascalis and his brother had fled. It is here that the Libyans\r\nsay Antæus[127] is buried. Sertorius dug into the mound, as he did not\r\nbelieve what the barbarians said, so enormous was the size. But,\r\nfinding the body there, sixty cubits in length, as they say, he was\r\nconfounded, and, after making a sacrifice, he piled up the earth, and\r\nadded to the repute and fame of the monument. The people of Tigennis\r\nhave a mythus, that, on the death of Antæus his wife Tinge cohabited\r\nwith Hercules, that Sophax was the issue of their connexion, and\r\nbecame king of the country, and named a city after his mother; they\r\nfurther say that Sophax had a son, Diodorus, whom many of the Libyan\r\nnations submitted to, as he had a Greek army of Olbiani and Mycenæi,\r\nwho were settled in those parts by Hercules. But this may be\r\nconsidered as so much flattery to Juba,[128] of all kings the most\r\ndevoted to historical inquiry; for they say that Juba's ancestors were\r\nthe descendants of Diodorus and Sophax. Sertorius, now completely\r\nvictorious, did no wrong to those who were his suppliants and trusted\r\nto him, but he restored to them both property and cities and the\r\nadministration, receiving only what was fair and just for them to\r\noffer.\r\n\r\nX. While Sertorius was considering where he should betake himself to,\r\nthe Lusitani sent ambassadors to invite him to be their leader; for\r\nthey were much in want of a commander of great reputation and\r\nexperience, to oppose the formidable power of the Romans, and\r\nSertorius was the only man whom they would trust, as they knew his\r\ncharacter from those who had been about him. Now it is said that\r\nSertorius was a man who never yielded either to pleasure or to fear,\r\nand while he was naturally unmoved by danger, he could bear prosperity\r\nwith moderation; in the open field he was equal to any general of his\r\ntime in enterprise, and as to all military matters that required\r\nstealthy manœuvres, the taking advantage of strong positions and rapid\r\nmovements, and also craft and deception, he was in the moment of need\r\nmost cunning in device. In rewarding courage he was bountiful, and in\r\npunishing for offences he was merciful. And yet, in the last part of\r\nhis life, his cruel and vindictive treatment of the hostages may be\r\nalleged as a proof that his temper was not naturally humane, but that\r\nhe put on the appearance of mildness through calculation and as a\r\nmatter of necessity, But it is my opinion that no fortune can ever\r\nchange to the opposite character a virtue which is genuine and founded\r\non principle; still it is not impossible that good intentions and good\r\nnatural dispositions, when impaired by great misfortunes[129] contrary\r\nto desert, may together with the dæmon change their habit; and this I\r\nthink was the case with Sertorius when fortune began to fail him; for\r\nas his circumstances became unfavourable, he became harsh to those who\r\nhad done him wrong.\r\n\r\nXI. However, he then set sail from Libya, at the invitation of the\r\nLusitanians,[130] and got them into fighting condition, being\r\nimmediately made commander with full powers, and he subjected the\r\nneighbouring parts of Iberia, most of which, indeed, voluntarily\r\njoined him, chiefly by reason of his mild treatment and his activity;\r\nbut in some cases he availed himself of cunning to beguile and win\r\nover the people, the chief of which was in the affair of the deer,\r\nwhich was after this fashion:\r\n\r\nSpanos, a native, and one of those who lived on their lands, fell in\r\nwith a deer[131] which had just brought forth a young one and was\r\nflying from the hunters; he missed taking the deer, but he followed\r\nthe fawn, being struck with its unusual colour (it was completely\r\nwhite), and caught it. It happened that Sertorius was staying in those\r\nparts, and when people brought him as presents anything that they had\r\ngot in hunting, or from their farms, he would readily receive it and\r\nmake a liberal return to those who showed him such attentions.\r\nAccordingly the man brought the fawn and gave it to Sertorius, who\r\naccepted the present. At first he took no particular pleasure in the\r\nanimal, but in course of time, when he had made it so tame and\r\nfamiliar that it would come to him when he called it, accompany him in\r\nhis walks, and cared not for a crowd and all the noise of the army, by\r\ndegrees he began to give the thing a supernatural character, saying\r\nthat the fawn was a gift from Artemis (Diana), and he gave out as a\r\ntoken of this that the fawn showed him many hidden things; for he knew\r\nthat it is the nature of barbarians to be easily accessible to\r\nsuperstition. He also resorted to such tricks as these: whenever he\r\nhad got secret information that the enemy had invaded any part of the\r\ncountry, or were attempting to draw any city away from him, he would\r\npretend that the deer had spoken to him in his sleep, and bid him keep\r\nhis troops in readiness; and, on the other hand, when he heard that\r\nhis generals had got a victory, he would keep the messenger concealed,\r\nand bring forward the deer crowned with chaplets, as is usual on the\r\noccasion of good news, and tell his men to rejoice and sacrifice to\r\nthe gods, as they would hear of some good luck.\r\n\r\nXII. By these means he tamed the people, and had them more manageable\r\nfor all purposes, as they believed they were led, not by the counsels\r\nof a foreigner, but by a deity, and facts also confirmed them in this\r\nopinion, inasmuch as the power of Sertorius increased beyond all\r\nexpectation; for with the two thousand six hundred men whom he called\r\nRomans, and four thousand Lusitanian targetiers, and seven hundred\r\nhorsemen, whom he joined to a motley band of seven hundred Libyans,\r\nwho crossed over with him to Lusitania, he fought with four Roman\r\ngenerals, who had under them one hundred and twenty thousand foot\r\nsoldiers, six thousand horsemen, two thousand bowmen and slingers, and\r\ncities innumerable, while he had only twenty cities in all under him.\r\nBut though so feeble and insignificant at first, he not only subdued\r\ngreat nations, and took many cities, but of the generals who were\r\nopposed to him he defeated Cotta[132] in a naval engagement in the\r\nchannel near Mellaria;[133] he put to flight Fufidius,[134] the\r\ngovernor of Bætica, on the banks of the Bætis, with the slaughter of\r\ntwo thousand of his Roman soldiers; Lucius Domitius,[135] proconsul of\r\nthe other Iberia,[136] was defeated by his quæstor; Thoranius,\r\nanother of the commanders of Metellus, who was sent with a force, he\r\ndestroyed; and on Metellus[137] himself, the greatest man among the\r\nRomans in his day, and of the highest repute, he inflicted several\r\ndiscomfitures, and brought him to such straits, that Lucius\r\nManlius[138] came from Narbo,[139] in Gaul, to his relief, and\r\nPompeius Magnus[140] was hastily despatched from Rome with an army;\r\nfor Metellus was perplexed at having to deal with a daring man, who\r\nevaded all fighting in the open field, and could adapt himself to any\r\ncircumstances by reason of the light and easy equipment and activity\r\nof his Iberian army; he who had been disciplined in regular battles\r\nfought by men in full armour and commanded a heavy immovable mass of\r\nmen, who were excellently trained to thrust against their enemies,\r\nwhen they came to close quarters, and to strike them down, but unable\r\nto traverse mountains, to be kept always on the alert by the continual\r\npursuing and retreating of light active men, and to endure hunger like\r\nthem, and to live under the open sky without fire or tent.\r\n\r\nXIII. Besides this, Metellus was now growing old, and after so many\r\ngreat battles was somewhat inclined to an easy and luxurious mode of\r\nlife; and he was opposed to Sertorius, a man full of the vigour of\r\nmature age, whose body was wonderfully furnished with strength,\r\nactivity, and power of endurance. He was never intoxicated with drink,\r\neven in his seasons of relaxation, and he was accustomed to bear great\r\ntoil, long marches, and continued watchfulness, content with a little\r\nfood of the meanest quality; and, inasmuch as he was always rambling\r\nabout and hunting, when he had leisure, he became intimately\r\nacquainted with all the spots, both impracticable and practicable,\r\nwhich gave chance of escape if he had to fly, or opportunity of\r\nhemming in an enemy if he was in pursuit. Consequently, it happened\r\nthat Metellus, being prevented from fighting, was damaged as much as\r\nmen who are beaten in battle, and Sertorius by flying had all the\r\nadvantage of the pursuer. He used to cut off the supplies of water,\r\nand check the foraging; and when Metellus was advancing Sertorius\r\nwould get out of his way, and when he was encamped he would not let\r\nhim rest; when Metellus was occupied with a siege, Sertorius would all\r\nat once show himself, and put Metellus in his turn in a state of\r\nblockade, owing to the want of the necessary supplies, so that the\r\nsoldiers were quite wearied; and when Sertorius challenged Metellus to\r\na single combat, the men cried out and bid him fight, as it would be a\r\nmatch between a general and a general, and a Roman and a Roman; and\r\nwhen Metellus declined, they jeered him. But he laughed at them, and\r\nhe did right; for a general, as Theophrastus[141] said, should die the\r\ndeath of a general, not that of a common targetier. Metellus\r\nperceiving that the Langobritæ[142] assisted Sertorius in no small\r\ndegree, and that their town could easily be taken, as it was ill\r\nsupplied with water, for they had only one well in the city, and any\r\none who blockaded the place would be master of the streams in the\r\nsuburbs and near the walls, he advanced against the city, expecting to\r\nfinish the siege in two days, as there was no water; and accordingly\r\nhis soldiers received orders to take provisions with them for five\r\ndays only. But Sertorius quickly coming to their aid, gave orders to\r\nfill two thousand skins with water, and he offered for each skin a\r\nconsiderable sum of money. Many Iberians and Moors volunteered for the\r\nservice, and, selecting the men who were strong and light-footed, he\r\nsent them through the mountain parts, with orders, when they had\r\ndelivered the skins to the people in the city, to bring out of the\r\ntown all the useless people, that the water might last the longer for\r\nthose who defended the place. When the news reached Metellus he was\r\nmuch annoyed, for his soldiers had already consumed their provisions;\r\nbut he sent Aquinius,[143] at the head of six thousand men, to forage.\r\nSertorius got notice of this, and laid an ambush on the road of three\r\nthousand men who starting up out of a bushy ravine, fell on Aquinius\r\nas he was returning. Sertorius attacked in front and put the Romans to\r\nflight, killing some and taking others prisoners. Aquinius returned\r\nwith the loss of both his armour and horse, and Metellus made a\r\ndisgraceful retreat amidst the jeers of the Iberians.\r\n\r\nXIV. By such acts as these Sertorius gained the admiration and love of\r\nthe barbarians; and, by introducing among them the Roman armour, and\r\ndiscipline, and signals, he took away the frantic and brutal part of\r\ntheir courage, and transformed them from a huge band of robbers into\r\nan efficient regular army. Besides, he employed gold and silver\r\nunsparingly for the decoration of their helmets, and he ornamented\r\ntheir shields, and accustomed them to the use of flowered cloaks and\r\ntunics, and, by supplying them with money for such purposes, and\r\nentering into a kind of honourable rivalry with them, he made himself\r\npopular. But they were most gained by what he did for their children.\r\nThe youths of noblest birth he collected from the several nations at\r\nOsca,[144] a large city, and set over them teachers of Greek and\r\nRoman learning; and thus he really had them as hostages under the show\r\nof educating them, as if he intended to give them a share in the\r\ngovernment and the administration when they attained to man's estate.\r\nThe fathers were wonderfully pleased at seeing their children dressed\r\nin robes with purple borders, and going so orderly to the schools of\r\nSertorius, who paid for their education, and often had examinations\r\ninto their proficiency, and gave rewards to the deserving, and\r\npresented them with golden ornaments for the neck, which the Romans\r\ncall \"bullæ.\"[145] It was an Iberian usage for those whose station was\r\nabout the commander to die with him when he fell in battle, which the\r\nbarbarians in those parts express by a term equivalent to the Greek\r\n\"devotion.\"[146] Now only a few shield-bearers and companions followed\r\nthe rest of the commanders; but many thousands followed Sertorius, and\r\nwere devoted to die with him. It is said that, when the army of\r\nSertorius was routed near a certain city and the enemy was pressing on\r\nthem, the Iberians, careless about themselves, saved Sertorius, and,\r\nraising him on their shoulders, every one vying with the rest helped\r\nhim to the walls; and when their general was secure they then betook\r\nthemselves to flight, each as well as he could.\r\n\r\nXV. Sertorius was not beloved by the Iberians only, but also by the\r\nsoldiers of Italy, who served with him. When Perpenna Vento,[147] who\r\nbelonged to the same party as Sertorius, had arrived in Iberia with\r\nmuch money and a large force, and had determined to carry on war\r\nagainst Metellus on his own account, his soldiers were dissatisfied,\r\nand there was much talk in the camp about Sertorius, to the great\r\nannoyance of Perpenna, who was proud of his noble family and his\r\nwealth. However, when the soldiers heard that Pompeius was crossing\r\nthe Pyrenees, taking their arms and pulling up the standards, they\r\nassailed Perpenna with loud cries, and bade him lead them to\r\nSertorius; if he did not, they threatened to leave him, and go of\r\nthemselves to a man who was able to take care of himself and others\r\ntoo. Perpenna yielded, and led them to join the troops of Sertorius,\r\nto the number of fifty-three cohorts.\r\n\r\nXVI. All the nations within the Iber river[148] were now joining\r\nSertorius at once, and he was powerful in numbers; for they were\r\ncontinually flocking and crowding to him from all quarters. But he was\r\ntroubled by the loose discipline and self-confidence of the\r\nbarbarians, who called on him to attack the enemy, and were impatient\r\nof delay, and he attempted to pacify them with reasons. Seeing,\r\nhowever, that they were discontented, and were unwisely pressing him\r\nwith their demands, he let them have their way, and winked at their\r\nengaging with the enemy, in so far as not to be completely crushed,\r\nbut to get some hard knocks, which he hoped would render them more\r\ntractable for the future. Things turning out as he expected, Sertorius\r\ncame to their aid when they were flying, and brought them back safe to\r\nthe camp. However, as he wished also to cheer their spirits, a few\r\ndays after this adventure he had all the army assembled, and\r\nintroduced before them two horses,[149] one very weak and rather old,\r\nthe other of a large size and strong, with a tail remarkable for the\r\nthickness and beauty of the hair. There stood by the side of the weak\r\nhorse a tall strong man, and by the side of the strong horse a little\r\nman of mean appearance. On a signal given to them, the strong man\r\nbegan to pull the tail of the horse with all his might towards him, as\r\nif he would tear it off; the weak man began to pluck out the hairs\r\nfrom the tail of the strong horse one by one. Now the strong man,\r\nafter no small labour to himself to no purpose, and causing much mirth\r\nto the spectators, at last gave up; but the weak man in a trice, and\r\nwith no trouble, bared the tail of all its hairs. On which Sertorius\r\ngetting up, said, \"You see, fellow allies, that perseverance will do\r\nmore than strength, and that many things which cannot be compassed all\r\nat once, yield to continued efforts; for endurance is invincible, and\r\nit is thus that time in its course assails and vanquishes every power,\r\nbeing a favourable helper to those who with consideration watch the\r\nopportunities that it offers, but the greatest of enemies to those who\r\nhurry out of season.\" By contriving from time to time such means as\r\nthese for pacifying the barbarians, he managed his opportunities as he\r\nchose.\r\n\r\nXVII. His adventure with the people called Charicatani[150] was not\r\nless admired than any of his military exploits. The Charicatani are a\r\npeople who live beyond the river Tagonius: they do not dwell in cities\r\nor villages; but there is a large lofty hill, which contains caves and\r\nhollows in the rocks, looking to the north. The whole of the country\r\nat the foot of the hill consists of a clayey mud and of light earth,\r\neasily broken in pieces, which is not strong enough to bear a man's\r\ntread; and if it is only slightly touched will spread all about, like\r\nunslaked lime or ashes. Whenever the barbarians through fear of war\r\nhid themselves in their caves, and, collecting all their plunder there\r\nkept quiet, they could not be taken by any force; and now, seeing\r\nthat Sertorius had retired before Metellus, and had encamped near the\r\nhill, they despised him as being beaten, on which Sertorius, whether\r\nin passion or not wishing to appear to be flying from the enemy, at\r\ndaybreak rode up to the place and examined it. But he found the\r\nmountain unassailable on all sides; and while he was perplexing\r\nhimself to no purpose and uttering idle threats, he saw a great\r\nquantity of dust from this light earth carried by the wind against the\r\nbarbarians; for the caves are turned, as I have said, to the north,\r\nand the wind which blows from that quarter (some call it \"caecias\")\r\nprevails most, and is the strongest of all the winds in those parts,\r\nbeing generated in wet plains and snow-covered mountains; and at that\r\ntime particularly, it being the height of summer, it was strong, and\r\nmaintained by the melting of the ice in the sub-arctic regions, and it\r\nblew most pleasantly both on the barbarians and their flocks, and\r\nrefreshed them. Now, Sertorius, thinking on all these things, and also\r\ngetting information from the country people, ordered his soldiers to\r\ntake up some of the light ashy earth, and bringing it right opposite\r\nto the hill to make a heap of it there; which the barbarians thought\r\nto be intended as a mound for the purpose of getting at them, and they\r\nmocked him. Sertorius kept his soldiers thus employed till nightfall,\r\nwhen he led them away. At daybreak a gentle breeze at first began to\r\nblow, which stirred up the lightest part of the earth that had been\r\nheaped together, and scattered it about like chaff; but when the\r\ncaecias began to blow strong, as the sun got higher, and the hills\r\nwere all covered with dust, the soldiers got on the heap of earth and\r\nstirred it up to the bottom, and broke the clods; and some also rode\r\ntheir horses up and down through the earth, kicking up the light\r\nparticles and raising them so as to be caught by the wind, which\r\nreceiving all the earth that was broken and stirred up, drove it\r\nagainst the dwellings of the barbarians, whose doors were open to the\r\ncaecias. The barbarians, having only the single opening to breathe\r\nthrough, upon which the wind fell, had their vision quickly obscured,\r\nand they were speedily overpowered by a suffocating difficulty of\r\nbreathing, by reason of respiring a thick atmosphere filled with dust.\r\nAccordingly, after holding out with difficulty for two days, they\r\nsurrendered on the third, and thus added not so much to the power as\r\nto the reputation of Sertorius, who had taken by stratagem a place\r\nthat was impregnable to arms.\r\n\r\nXVIII. Now, as long as Sertorius had to oppose Metellus, he was\r\ngenerally considered to owe his success to the old age and natural\r\ntardiness of Metellus, who was no match for a daring man, at the head\r\nof a force more like a band of robbers than a regular army. But when\r\nPompeius had crossed the Pyrenees, and Sertorius had met him in the\r\nfield, and he and Pompeius had mutually offered one another every\r\nopportunity for a display of generalship, and Sertorius had the\r\nadvantage in stratagem and caution, his fame was noised abroad as far\r\nas Rome, and he was considered the most able general of his age in the\r\nconduct of a war: for the reputation of Pompeius was no small one; but\r\nat that time particularly he was enjoying the highest repute by reason\r\nof his distinguished exploits in the cause of Sulla, for which Sulla\r\ngave him the name of Magnus, which means Great, and Pompeius obtained\r\ntriumphal honours before he had a beard. All this made many of the\r\ncities which were subject to Sertorius turn their eyes towards\r\nPompeius, and feel inclined to pass over to him; but their intentions\r\nwere checked by the loss at Lauron,[151] which happened contrary to\r\nall expectation. Sertorius was besieging this town, when Pompeius came\r\nwith all his force to relieve it. There was a hill, well situated for\r\nenabling an enemy to act against the place, which Sertorius made an\r\neffort to seize, and Pompeius to prevent its being occupied. Sertorius\r\nsucceeded in getting possession of the hill, on which Pompeius made\r\nhis troops stop, and was well pleased at what had happened, thinking\r\nthat Sertorius was hemmed in between the city and his own army; and\r\nhe sent a message to the people in Lauron, bidding them be of good\r\ncheer, and to keep to their walls and look on while Sertorius was\r\nblockaded. Sertorius smiled when he heard of this, and said he would\r\nteach Sulla's pupil (for so he contemptuously called Pompeius) that a\r\ngeneral should look behind him rather than before. As he said this he\r\npointed out to his men, who were thus blockaded, that there were six\r\nthousand heavy armed soldiers, whom he had left in the encampment,\r\nwhich he had quitted before he seized the hill, in order that if\r\nPompeius should turn against them, the soldiers in camp might attack\r\nhim in the rear. And Pompeius too saw this when it was too late, and\r\nhe did not venture to attack Sertorius for fear of being surrounded;\r\nand though he could not for shame leave the citizens in their danger,\r\nhe was obliged to sit there and see them ruined before his eyes; for\r\nthe barbarians in despair surrendered. Sertorius spared their lives,\r\nand let them all go; but he burnt the city, not for revenge or because\r\nhe was cruel, for of all commanders Sertorius appears to have least\r\ngiven way to passion; but he did it to shame and humble the admirers\r\nof Pompeius, and that the barbarians might say that Pompeius did not\r\nhelp his allies, though he was close at hand, and all but warmed with\r\nthe flames of their city.\r\n\r\nXIX. However, Sertorius was now sustaining several defeats, though he\r\nalways saved himself and those with him from defeat; but his losses\r\nwere occasioned by the other generals. Yet he gained more credit from\r\nthe means by which he repaired his defeats than the generals on the\r\nother side who won the victories; an instance of which occurred in the\r\nbattle against Pompeius, on the Sucro, and another in the battle near\r\nTuttia,[152] against Pompeius[153] and Metellus together. Now the\r\nbattle on the Sucro is said to have been brought about by the\r\neagerness of Pompeius, who wished Metellus to have no share in the\r\nvictory. Sertorius, on his part, also wished to engage Pompeius before\r\nMetellus arrived; and, drawing out his forces when the evening was\r\ncoming on, he commenced the battle, thinking that, as the enemy were\r\nstrangers and unacquainted with the ground, the darkness would be a\r\ndisadvantage to them, whether they were the pursued or the pursuers.\r\nWhen the battle began, it happened that Sertorius was not engaged with\r\nPompeius, but with Afranius at first, who commanded the left wing of\r\nthe enemy, while Sertorius commanded his own right. But, hearing that\r\nthose who were opposed to Pompeius were giving way before his attack\r\nand being defeated, Sertorius left the right wing to the care of other\r\ngenerals, and hastened to the support of the wing that was giving way.\r\nBringing together the soldiers who were already flying, and those who\r\nwere still keeping their ranks, he encouraged them and made a fresh\r\ncharge upon Pompeius, who was pursuing, and put his men to the rout;\r\non which occasion Pompeius himself nearly lost his life, and had a\r\nwonderful escape after being wounded. The Libyans of Sertorius seized\r\nthe horse of Pompeius, which was decked with golden ornaments and\r\nloaded with trappings; but while they were dividing the booty and\r\nquarrelling about it, they neglected the pursuit. As soon as Sertorius\r\nquitted the right wing to relieve the other part of the army,\r\nAfranius[154] put to flight his opponents and drove them to their\r\ncamp, which, he entered with the captives, it being now dark, and\r\nbegan to plunder, knowing nothing of the defeat of Pompeius, and being\r\nunable to stop his soldiers from seizing the booty. In the mean time\r\nSertorius returned, after defeating the enemy who were opposed to him,\r\nand falling on the soldiers of Afranius, who were all in disorder and\r\nconsequently panic-stricken, he slaughtered many of them. In the\r\nmorning he again armed his troops and came out to fight; but observing\r\nthat Metellus was near, he broke up his order of battle, and marched\r\noff saying, \"If that old woman had not come up, I would have given\r\nthis boy a good drubbing by way of lesson, and have sent him back to\r\nRome.\"\r\n\r\nXX. About this time Sertorius was much dispirited, because that\r\ndeer[155] of his could nowhere be found; for he was thus deprived of a\r\ngreat means of cheering the barbarians, who then particularly required\r\nconsolation. It happened that some men, who were rambling about at\r\nnight for other purposes, fell in with the deer and caught it, for\r\nthey knew it by the colour. Sertorius hearing of this, promised to\r\ngive them a large sum of money if they would mention it to nobody;\r\nand, concealing the deer for several days, he came forward with a\r\njoyful countenance to the tribunal, and told the barbarian chiefs that\r\nthe deity prognosticated to him in his sleep some great good fortune.\r\nHe then ascended the tribunal, and transacted business with those who\r\napplied to him. The deer being let loose by those who had charge of it\r\nclose by, and, seeing Sertorius, bounded joyfully up to the tribunal,\r\nand, standing by him, placed its head on his knees, and touched his\r\nright hand with its mouth, having been accustomed to do this before.\r\nSertorius cordially returned the caresses of the animal, and even\r\nshed tears. The spectators were at first surprised; then clapping\r\ntheir hands and shouting, they conducted Sertorius to his residence,\r\nconsidering him to be a man superior to other mortals and beloved by\r\nthe gods; and they were full of good hopes.\r\n\r\nXXI. Sertorius, who had reduced the enemy to the greatest straits in\r\nthe plains about Seguntum[156] was compelled to fight a battle with\r\nthem when they came down to plunder and forage. The battle was well\r\ncontested on both sides. Memmius, one of the most skillful of the\r\ncommanders under Pompeius, fell in the thick of the fight, and\r\nSertorius, who was victorious, and making a great slaughter of those\r\nwho opposed him, attempted to get at Metellus, who stood his ground\r\nwith a resolution above his years, and, while fighting bravely, was\r\nstruck by a spear. This made the Romans who were on the spot, as well\r\nas those who heard of it, ashamed to desert their leader, and inspired\r\nthem with courage against their enemies. After covering Metellus with\r\ntheir shields and rescuing him from danger, by making a vigorous onset\r\nthey drove the Iberians from their ground; and, as the victory now\r\nchanged sides, Sertorius, with a view of securing a safe retreat for\r\nhis men, and contriving the means of getting together another army\r\nwithout any interruption, retired to a strong city in the mountains,\r\nand began to repair the walls and strengthen the gates, though his\r\nobject was anything rather than to stand a siege: but his design was\r\nto deceive the enemy, in which he succeeded; for they sat down before\r\nthe place, thinking they should take it without difficulty, and in the\r\nmean time they let the defeated barbarians escape, and allowed\r\nSertorius to collect a fresh army. It was got together by Sertorius\r\nsending officers to the cities, and giving orders that when they had\r\ncollected a good body of men, they should dispatch a messenger to him.\r\nWhen the messenger came, he broke through the besiegers without any\r\ndifficulty and joined his troops; and now he again advanced against\r\nthe enemy in great force, and began to cut off their land supplies by\r\nambuscades, and hemming them in, and showing himself at every point,\r\ninasmuch as his attacks were made with great expedition; and he cut\r\noff all their maritime supplies by occupying the coast with his\r\npiratical vessels, so that the generals opposed to him were obliged to\r\nseparate, one to march off into Gaul, and Pompeius to winter among the\r\nVaccæi[157] in great distress for want of supplies, and to write to\r\nthe Senate, that he would lead his army out of Iberia, if they did not\r\nsend him money, for he had spent all his own in defence of Italy.\r\nThere was great talk in Rome that Sertorius would come to Italy before\r\nPompeius[158] to such difficulties did Sertorius, by his military\r\nabilities, reduce the first and ablest of the generals of that age.\r\n\r\nXXII. Metellus also showed, that he feared the man and thought he was\r\npowerful; for he made proclamation, that if any Roman killed Sertorius\r\nhe would give him a hundred talents of silver and twenty thousand\r\njugera of land; and, if he was an exile, permission to return, to\r\nRome: thus declaring that he despaired of being able to defeat\r\nSertorius in the field, and therefore would purchase his life by\r\ntreachery. Besides this, Metellus was so elated by a victory which on\r\none occasion he gained over Sertorius, and so well pleased with his\r\nsuccess, that he was proclaimed Imperator[159] and the cities received\r\nhim in his visits to them with sacrifices and altars. It is also said,\r\nthat he allowed chaplets to be placed on his head, and accepted\r\ninvitations to sumptuous feasts, at which he wore a triumphal vest;\r\nand Victories[160] which were contrived to move by machinery,\r\ndescended and distributed golden trophies and crowns, and companies of\r\nyouths and women sang epinician hymns in honour of him. For this he\r\nwas with good reason ridiculed, for that after calling Sertorius a\r\nrunaway slave of Sulla, and a remnant of the routed party of Carbo, he\r\nwas so puffed up and transported with delight because he had gained an\r\nadvantage over Sertorius, who had been compelled to retire. But it was\r\na proof of the magnanimous character of Sertorius, first, that he gave\r\nthe name of Senate to the Senators who fled from Rome and joined him,\r\nand that he appointed quæstors and generals from among them, and\r\narranged everything of this kind according to Roman usage; and next,\r\nthat though he availed himself of the arms, the money and the cities\r\nof the Iberians, he never yielded to them one *tittle of the Roman\r\nsupremacy, but he appointed Romans to be their generals and\r\ncommanders, considering that he was recovering freedom for the Romans,\r\nand was not strengthening the Iberians against the Romans; for\r\nSertorius loved his country and had a great desire to return home.\r\nNotwithstanding this, in his reverses he behaved like a brave man, and\r\nnever humbled himself before his enemies; and after his victories he\r\nwould send to Metellus and to Pompeius, and declare that he was ready\r\nto lay down his arms and to live in a private station, if he might be\r\nallowed to return home; for, he said, he would rather be the obscurest\r\ncitizen in Rome than an exile from his country, though he were\r\nproclaimed supreme ruler of all other countries in the world. It is\r\nsaid, that he longed to return home chiefly on account of his mother,\r\nwho brought him up after his father's death, and to whom he was\r\ncompletely devoted. At the time when his friends in Iberia invited him\r\nto take the command, he heard of the death of his mother, and he was\r\nnear dying of grief. He lay in his tent for seven days without giving\r\nthe watchword, or being seen by any of his friends; and it was with\r\ndifficulty that his fellow-generals and those of like rank with\r\nhimself, who had assembled about his tent, prevailed on him to come\r\nout to the soldiers, and take a share in the administration of\r\naffairs, which were going on well. This made many people think that\r\nSertorius was naturally a man of mild temper, and well disposed to a\r\nquiet life; but that, owing to uncontrollable causes, and contrary to\r\nhis wishes, he entered on the career of a commander, and then, when he\r\ncould not ensure his safety, and was driven to arms by his enemies, he\r\nhad recourse to war as the only means by which he could protect his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nXXIII. His negociations with Mithridates also were a proof of his\r\nmagnanimity; for now that Mithridates, rising from the fall that he\r\nhad from Sulla, as it were, to a second contest, had again attacked\r\nAsia, and the fame of Sertorius was great, and had gone abroad to all\r\nparts, and those who sailed from the West had filled the Pontus with\r\nthe reports about him, as if with so many foreign wares, Mithridates\r\nwas moved to send an embassy to him, being urged thereto mainly by the\r\nfulsome exaggerations of his flatterers, who compared Sertorius to\r\nHannibal and Mithridates to Pyrrhus, and said that if the Romans were\r\nattacked on both sides, they could not hold out against such great\r\nabilities and powers combined, when the most expert of commanders had\r\njoined the greatest of kings. Accordingly, Mithridates sent\r\nambassadors to Iberia, with letters to Sertorius and proposals. On his\r\npart he offered to supply money and ships for the war, and he asked\r\nfrom Sertorius a confirmation of his title to the whole of Asia, which\r\nhe had given up to the Romans pursuant to the treaty made with Sulla.\r\nSertorius assembled a council, which he called a senate, and all the\r\nmembers advised to accept the king's proposal, and to be well content\r\nwith it; they said the king only asked of them a name and an empty\r\nanswer touching things that were not in their power, in return for\r\nwhich they were to receive what they happened to stand most in need\r\nof. But Sertorius would not listen to this; he said he did not grudge\r\nMithridates having Bithynia and Cappadocia; these were nations that\r\nwere accustomed to a king, and the Romans had nothing to do with them;\r\nbut the province which belonged to the Romans by the justest of\r\ntitles, which Mithridates took from them and kept, from which, after a\r\ncontest, he was driven out by Fimbria, and which he gave up by treaty\r\nwith Sulla,[161] -that province he would never allow to fall again\r\ninto the power of Mithridates; for it was fit that the Roman state\r\nshould be extended by his success, not that his success should be\r\nowing to her humiliation. To a generous mind, victory by honest means\r\nwas a thing to desire, but life itself was not worth having with\r\ndishonour.\r\n\r\nXXIV. When this was reported to Mithridates he was amazed, and it is\r\nsaid that he remarked to his friends--what terms, then, will Sertorius\r\nimpose when he is seated on the Palatium,[162] if now, when he is\r\ndriven to the shores of the Atlantic, he fixes limits to our kingdom,\r\nand threatens us with war if we make any attempt upon Asia? However, a\r\ntreaty was made, and ratified by oath, on the following terms:\r\nMithridates[163] was to have Cappadocia and Bithynia, and Sertorius\r\nwas to send him a general and soldiers; and Sertorius was to receive\r\nfrom Mithridates three thousand talents, and forty ships. Sertorius\r\nsent as general to Asia Marcus Marius, one of the Senators who had\r\nfled to him; and Mithridates, after assisting him to take some of the\r\nAsiatic cities,[164] followed Marius as he entered them with the\r\nfasces and axes, voluntarily taking the second place and the character\r\nof an inferior. Marius restored some of the cities to liberty, and he\r\nwrote to others to announce to them their freedom from taxation\r\nthrough the power of Sertorius; so that Asia, which was much troubled\r\nby the Publicani,[165] and oppressed by the rapacity and insolence of\r\nthe soldiers quartered there, was again raised on the wings of hope,\r\nand longed for the expected change of masters.\r\n\r\nXXV. In Iberia, the senators and nobles about Sertorius, as soon as\r\nthey were put into a condition to hope that they were a match for the\r\nopposite party, and their fears were over, began to feel envious, and\r\nhad a foolish jealousy of the power of Sertorius. Perpenna encouraged\r\nthis feeling, being urged by the empty pride of high birth to aspire\r\nto the supreme command, and he secretly held treasonable language to\r\nthose who were favourable to his designs. \"What evil dæmon,\" he would\r\nsay, \"has got hold of us, and carried us from bad to worse--us who did\r\nnot brook to stay at home and do the bidding of Sulla, though in a\r\nmanner he was lord of all the earth and sea at once, but coming here\r\nwith ill luck, in order to live free, have voluntarily become slaves\r\nby making ourselves the guards of Sertorius in his exile, and while we\r\nare called a senate, a name jeered at by all who hear it, we submit to\r\ninsults, and orders, and sufferings as great as the Iberians and\r\nLusitanians endure.\" Their minds filled with such suggestions as\r\nthese, the majority did not, indeed, openly desert Sertorius, for they\r\nfeared his power, but they secretly damaged all his measures, and they\r\noppressed the barbarians by severe treatment and exactions, on the\r\npretext that it was by the order of Sertorius. This caused revolts and\r\ndisturbances in the cities; and those who were sent to settle and\r\npacify these outbreaks returned after causing more wars, and\r\nincreasing the existing insubordination; so that Sertorius, contrary\r\nto his former moderation and mildness, did a grievous wrong to the\r\nsons of the Iberians, who were educating at Osca,[166] by putting some\r\nto death, and selling others as slaves.\r\n\r\nXXVI. Now Perpenna, having got several to join him in his conspiracy,\r\ngained over Manlius, one of those who were in command. This Manlius\r\nwas much attached to a beautiful boy, and to give the youth a proof of\r\nhis attachment he told him of the design, and urged him not to care\r\nfor his other lovers; but to give his affections to him alone, as he\r\nwould be a great man in a few days. The youth reported what Manlius\r\nsaid to Aufidius, another of his lovers, to whom he was more attached.\r\nOn hearing this, Aufidius was startled, for he was engaged in the\r\nconspiracy against Sertorius, but he did not know that Manlius was a\r\nparty to it. But when the youth named Perpenna and Graecinus,[167] and\r\nsome others whom Aufidius knew to be in the conspiracy, he was\r\nconfounded, yet he made light of the story to the youth, and told him\r\nto despise Manlius for a lying braggart; but he went to Perpenna, and,\r\nshowing him the critical state of affairs, and the danger, urged him\r\nto the deed. The conspirators followed his advice, and having engaged\r\na man to bring letters they introduced him to Sertorius. The letters\r\ngave information of a victory gained by one of the generals, and a\r\ngreat slaughter of the enemy. Upon this Sertorius was overjoyed, and\r\noffered a sacrifice for the happy tidings; and Perpenna proposed to\r\nfeast him and his friends (and they were of the number of the\r\nconspirators), and after much entreaty he prevailed on Sertorius to\r\ncome. Now whenever Sertorius was present, an entertainment was\r\nconducted with great propriety and decorum; for he would not tolerate\r\nany indecent act or expression, but accustomed his companions to\r\nenjoy mirth and merriment with orderly behaviour, and without any\r\nexcess; but, on this occasion, in the midst of the feast, seeking to\r\nbegin a quarrel, they openly used obscene language, and, pretending to\r\nbe drunk, behaved indecently, for the purpose of irritating Sertorius.\r\nWhether it was that he was vexed at this disorderly conduct, or had\r\nnow suspected their design by the flagging of the conversation[168]\r\nand their unusual contemptuous manner towards him, he changed his\r\nposture on the couch by throwing himself on his back, as if he was\r\npaying no attention to them, and not listening. On Perpenna taking a\r\ncup of wine, and in the middle of the draught throwing it from him and\r\nso making a noise, which was the signal agreed on, Antonius, who lay\r\nnext to Sertorius, struck him with his sword. On receiving the blow,\r\nSertorius turned himself, and at the same time attempted to rise, but\r\nAntonius, throwing himself upon his chest, held his hands, and he was\r\ndespatched by blows from many of the conspirators, without even making\r\nany resistance.\r\n\r\nXXVII.[169] Now most of the Iberians immediately sent ambassadors to\r\nPompeius and Metellus, to make their submission; those who remained\r\nPerpenna took under his command, and attempted to do something. After\r\nemploying the means that Sertorius had got together, just so far as to\r\ndisgrace himself, and show that he was not suited either to command or\r\nto obey, he engaged with Pompeius. Being quickly crushed by him and\r\ntaken prisoner, he did not behave himself even in this extremity as a\r\ncommander should do; but having got possession of the papers of\r\nSertorius, he offered to Pompeius to show him autograph letters from\r\nconsular men and persons of the highest influence at Rome, in which\r\nSertorius was invited to Italy, and was assured that there were many\r\nwho were desirous to change the present settlement of affairs, and to\r\nalter the constitution. Now Pompeius, by behaving on this occasion,\r\nnot like a young man, but one whose understanding was well formed and\r\ndisciplined, relieved Rome from great dangers and revolutions. He got\r\ntogether all those letters, and all the papers of Sertorius, and burnt\r\nthem, without either reading them himself or letting any one else read\r\nthem; and he immediately put Perpenna to death, through fear that\r\nthere might be defection and disturbance if the names were\r\ncommunicated to others. Of the fellow-conspirators of Perpenna, some\r\nwere brought to Pompeius, and put to death; and others, who fled to\r\nLibya, were pierced by the Moorish spears. Not one escaped, except\r\nAufidius, the rival of Manlius, and this happened, either because he\r\nescaped notice, or nobody took any trouble about him, and he lived to\r\nold age, in some barbarian village, in poverty and contempt.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: If this is obscure, the fault is Plutarch's. His word\r\nfor Fortune is [Greek: tuchê] τύχη which he has often used in the Life\r\nof Sulla. The word for Spontaneity is [Greek: to automaton] τὸ\r\nαὐτόματον, the Self-moved. The word for Elemental things is [Greek: ta\r\nhupokeimena] τὰ ὑποκειμένα. The word [Greek: hupokeimenon] ὑποκειμένον\r\nis used by Aristotle to signify both the thing of which something is\r\npredicated, the Subject of grammarians, and for the Substance, which\r\nis as it were the substratum on which actions operate. Aristotle\r\n(_Metaphys._ vi. vii. 3) says \"Essence ([Greek: ousia] οὐσία) or Being\r\nis predicated, if not in many ways, in four at least; for the formal\r\ncause ([Greek: to ti ên einai] τὸ τὶ ἦν εἶναι), and the universal, and\r\ngenus appear to be the essence of everything; and the fourth of these\r\nis the Substance ([Greek: to hupokeimenon] τὸ ὑποκειμένον). And the\r\nSubstance is that of which the rest are predicated, but it is not\r\npredicated of any other thing. And Essence seems to be especially the\r\nfirst Substance; and such, in a manner, matter ([Greek: hulê] ὕλη) is\r\nsaid to be; and in another manner, form; and in a third, that which is\r\nfrom these. And I mean by matter ([Greek: hulê] ὕλη), copper, for\r\ninstance; and by form, the figure of the idea; and by that which is\r\nfrom them, the statue in the whole,\" &c. I have translated [Greek: to\r\nti ên einai] τὸ τὶ ἦν εἶναι by \"formal cause,\" as Thomas Taylor has\r\ndone, and according to the explanation of Trendelenburg, in his\r\nedition of Aristotle _On the Soul_, i. 1, § 2. It is not my business\r\nto explain Aristotle, but to give some clue to the meaning of\r\nPlutarch.\r\n\r\nThe word \"accidentally\" ([Greek: kata tuchên] κατὰ τύχην) is opposed\r\nto \"forethought\" ([Greek: pronoia] προνοία), \"design,\" \"providence.\"\r\nHow Plutarch conceived Fortune, I do not know; nor do I know what\r\nFortune and Chance mean in any language. But the nature of the\r\ncontrast which he intends is sufficiently clear for his purpose.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: As to Attes, as Pausanias (vii. 17) names him, his\r\nhistory is given by Pausanias. There appears to be some confusion in\r\nhis story. Herodotus (i. 36) has a story of an Atys, a son of Crœsus,\r\nwho was killed while hunting a wild boar; and Adonis, the favourite of\r\nVenus, was killed by a wild boar. It is not known who this Arcadian\r\nAtteus was.\r\n\r\nActæon saw Diana naked while she was bathing, and was turned by her\r\ninto a deer and devoured by his dogs. (Apollodorus, _Biblioth_. iii.\r\n4; Ovidius, _Metamorph_. iii. 155.) The story of the other Actæon is\r\ntold by Plutarch (_Amator. Narrationes_, c. 2).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: The elder Africanus, P.

Gracchus, c. 1, Notes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: Ios, a small island of the Grecian Archipelago, now\r\nNio, is mentioned among the places where Homer was buried. The name\r\nIos resembles that of the Greek word for violet, ([Greek: ion] ίον).\r\nSmyrna, one of the members of the Ionian confederation, is mentioned\r\namong the birth places of Homer. It was an accident that the name of\r\nthe town Smyrna was the same as the name for myrrh, _Smyrna_ ([Greek:\r\nsmurnê] σμύρνη),x which was not a Greek word. Herodotus (iii. 112)\r\nsays that it was the Arabians who procured myrrh.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: This Philippus was the father of Alexander the Great.\r\nHe is said to have lost an eye from a wound by an arrow at the siege\r\nof Pydna Antigonus, one of the generals of Alexander, was named\r\nCyclops, or the one-eyed. He accompanied Alexander in his Asiatic\r\nexpedition, and in the division of the empire after Alexander's death\r\nhe obtained a share and by his vigour and abilities he made himself\r\nthe most powerful of the successors of Alexander. It is said that\r\nApelles, who painted the portrait of Antigonus, placed him in profile\r\nin order to hide the defect of the one eye. Antigonus closed his long\r\ncareer at the battle of Ipsus B.C. 301, where he was defeated and\r\nkilled. He was then eighty-one years of age.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: Plutarch's form is Annibas. I may have sometimes\r\nwritten it Hannibal. Thus we have Anno and Hanno. I don't know which\r\nis the true form. [I prefer to write it Hannibal.--A.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: Plutarch has written the Life of Eumenes, whom he\r\ncontrasts with Sertorius. Eumenes was one of the generals of Alexander\r\nwho accompanied him to Asia. After Alexander's death, he obtained for\r\nhis government a part of Asia Minor bordering on the Euxine, and\r\nextending as far east as Trapezus. The rest of his life is full of\r\nadventure. He fell into the hands of Antigonus B.C. 315, who put him\r\nto death.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: Nursia was in the country of the Sabini among the\r\nApennines, and near the source of the Nar. It is now Norcia. The MSS.\r\nof Plutarch have Nussa.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: The date is B.C. 105. See the Life of Marius, c. 10,\r\nand Notes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: Titus Didius and Q. Cæcilius Metellus Nepos were\r\nconsuls B.C. 98. In B.C. 97 Didius was in Spain as Proconsul, and\r\nfought against the Celtiberi. Gellius (ii. 27) quotes a passage from\r\nthe Historiæ of Sallustius, in which mention is made of Sertorius\r\nserving under Didius in Spain, and the character of Sertorius is given\r\npretty nearly in the terms of Plutarch, who may have used Sallustius\r\nas one of his authorities. Didius is mentioned by Cicero, _Pro Cn.\r\nPlancio_, c. 25; and by Frontinus, i. 8. 5; ii. 10. 1; and by Appian\r\n(_Iberica_, c. 99). The passage in the text should be translated, \"he\r\nwas sent out under Didius as commander, and wintered in Iberia, in\r\nCastlo,\" &c. Plutarch has used the word [Greek: stratêgos] στρατηγός,\r\nwhich means prætor; but to make the statement correct, we must\r\ntranslate it Proconsul, or commander. See Life of Crassus, c. 4,\r\nNotes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: Castlo, Castalo, or Castulo, is placed on the north\r\nbank of the Bætis, the Guadalquivir.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: See the Life of Marius, c. 32, Notes. The events that\r\nare briefly alluded to at the end of this chapter are described in the\r\nLives of Marius and Sulla. The battle in the Forum is spoken of in the\r\nLife of Marius, c. 41.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: The same story is told in the Life of Marius, c. 44,\r\nwhere it is stated that Cinna and Sertorius combined to put these\r\nscoundrels out of the way; but the number that were massacred is not\r\nstated there.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: Compare the Life of Marius, c. 45, and of Sulla, c. 28,\r\n&c. Cinna was murdered by his soldiers two years after the death of\r\nMarius, and in his fourth consulship, B.C. 84. The younger Marius was\r\nConsul in B.C. 82, with Cn. Papirius Carbo for his colleague. This was\r\nCarbo's third consulship. According to Plutarch, Sertorius left Italy\r\nafter the younger Marius was consul, and therefore not earlier than\r\nB.C. 82, unless we understand the passage in Plutarch as referring to\r\nthe election of Marius, and not to the commencement of his consulship.\r\nAppian (_Civil Wars_, i. 86) places the departure of Sertorius in the\r\nyear B.C. 83.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: Sertorius had not been Consul, and therefore he was not\r\nnow Proconsul. It is true that a man, who had not been Consul, might\r\nreceive the government of a Province with the title of Proconsul. (See\r\nc. 7.) Sertorius may have assumed the title.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: If Sertorius stayed at Rome till the younger Marius was\r\nelected Consul, as Plutarch states in the sixth chapter, he probably\r\nsaw what he is here represented as hearing.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: This Annius, surnamed Luscus, served under Q. Metellus\r\nin the Jugurthine War B.C. 107. (Sallust, _Jug. War_, c. 77.) Sulla\r\ngave him the command in Spain with the title of Proconsul B.C. 81. An\r\nextant medal seems to have been struck in honour of his Proconsulship.\r\n(Eckhel, _Doct. Num. Vet._ v. 134.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: This town, which the Romans called Nova Carthago, was\r\nbuilt by the Carthaginians at the close of the first Punic War B.C.\r\n235, and so long as they kept possession of Spain it was their chief\r\ncity. Livius (26. c. 42), describes the situation of New Carthage, now\r\nCartagena, and one of the best harbours in Spain. Its position on the\r\nS.E. coast is favourable for communication with Africa.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: The maritime towns of Cilicia were for a long time the\r\nresort of a bold set of seamen and adventurers who scoured the\r\nMediterranean and were as formidable to the people of Italy as the\r\nBarbary Corsairs were in the middle ages. It was one of the great\r\nmerits of Cn. Pompeius Magnus that he cleared the seas of these\r\nscoundrels. See Lucullus, c. 37.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: The two islands of Yviça or Ibiça and Formentera, which\r\nbelong to the Balearic group, were sometimes comprehended under the\r\nname of the Pityussæ or the Pine Islands (Strabo, 167, ed. Casaub.).\r\nThe Greeks and Romans called Yviça, Ebusus. Iviça is hilly, and the\r\nhigh tracts are well covered with pine and fir.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: This is the old name of the Straits of Gibraltar, which\r\nis still retained in the modern form Cadiz. Gadeira, which the Romans\r\ncalled Gades, was an old Phœnician town, on the island of Leon, where\r\nCadiz now stands. Strabo (p. 168, ed. Casaub.) says that Gades in his\r\ntime (the beginning of the reign of Tiberius) was not inferior in\r\npopulation to any city except Rome, and was a place of great trade, as\r\nit is now.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: This river, now the Guadalquivir, gave the name of\r\nBætica to one of the three provinces into which the Spanish Peninsula\r\nwas ultimately divided by the Romans for the purposes of\r\nadministration.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: This was the name for so much of the ocean that washes\r\nthe west coast of Europe and Africa as the Greeks and Romans were\r\nacquainted with. The Greeks and Romans had no name for the\r\nMediterranean.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: The only islands in the Atlantic that correspond to\r\nthis description are Madeira and Porto Santo, but Porto Santo is forty\r\nmiles north-east of Madeira. The distance of Madeira from the coast of\r\nAfrica is about 400 miles or about 4000 stadia. The climate of Madeira\r\nis very temperate: the thermometer seldom sinks below 60°, though it\r\nsometimes rises as high as 90° of Fahrenheit. On the high and\r\nmountainous parts there are heavy dews, and rain falls at all seasons.\r\nOwing to the variety of surface and elevation the island produces both\r\ntropical products and those of temperate countries. The fame of this\r\nhappy region had spread to all parts of the ancient world, though we\r\ncannot safely conclude that the islands were known by report to Homer.\r\nHorace in his 16th _Epode_ is probably alluding to these islands when\r\nhe is speaking of the Civil Wars and of flying from their horrors in\r\nthose beautiful lines:\r\n\r\n    Nos manet Oceanus circumvagus; arva beata\r\n      Petamus arva divites et insulas, &c.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: The passage is in the fourth book of the 'Odyssey,' v.\r\n563, and is quoted by Strabo (p. 31):\r\n\r\n    And there in sooth man's life is easiest;\r\n    Nor snow, nor raging storm, nor rain is there,\r\n    But ever gently breathing gales of zephyr\r\n    Oceanus sends up.\r\n\r\nStrabo in another passage expresses an opinion that the Elysian fields\r\nwere in the southern parts of Spain. That would at least be a good\r\nplace for them.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: This region is the Mauritania of the Roman Geographers,\r\nthe modern Marocco, and the town of Tigennis is the Roman Tingis, the\r\nmodern Tangier, which is on the Atlantic coast of Africa,\r\nsouth-south-east of Gades. The circumstance of Tingis being attacked\r\nshows that the African campaign of Sertorius was in the north-western\r\npart of Marocco. Strabo mentions Tinga (p. 825). See also Plin. _H.N._\r\nv. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: The story of this giant is in the mythographers. Tumuli\r\nare found in many parts of the old and new world, and it seems\r\nprobable that they were all memorials to the dead. The only surprising\r\nthing in this story is the size of the body; which each man may\r\nexplain in his own way. There are various records in antient writers\r\nof enormous bones being found. Those found at Tegea under a smithy,\r\nwhich were supposed to be the bones of Orestes, were seven cubits long\r\n(Herodotus, i. 68), little more than the ninth part of the dimensions\r\nof Antæus: but Antæus was a giant and Orestes was not. See Strabo's\r\nremarks on this story (p. 829).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: See Life of Sulla, c. 17. I am not sure that I have\r\ngiven the right meaning of this passage. Plutarch may mean to say that\r\nhe has said so much on this matter in honour of Juba.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: I have translated this passage literally and kept the\r\nword dæmon, which is the best way of enabling the reader to judge of\r\nthe meaning; of the text. If the word \"dæmon\" is here translated\r\n\"fortune,\" it may mislead. A like construction to the words [Greek: tô\r\ndaimoni summetabalein to êthos] τῶ δαιμόνι συμμεταβαλεῖν τὸ ἧθος\r\noccurs in the Life of Lucullus, c. 39. The meaning of the whole\r\npassage must be considered with reference to the sense of dæmon, which\r\nis explained in the notes of the Life of Sulla, c. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: The Lusitani occupied a part of the modern kingdom of\r\nPortugal.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: This story of the deer is told by Frontinus\r\n(_Stratagem,_ i. 11, 13), and by Gellius (xv. 22).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: He was of the Aurelia Gens.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: Is a small town on the coast, east of the mouth of the\r\nBætis (Guadalquivir) and near the Straits of Gibraltar.

See the various readings in Sintenis, and\r\n_Sulla_ (c. 31), to which he refers. However, the corrupt readings of\r\nsome MSS. clearly show what the true reading is.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: Sintenis reads Domitius Calvisius. But it should be\r\nCalvinus: Calvinus was a cognomen of the Domitii. (See Livius,\r\n_Epitome_, lib. 90.) The person who is meant is L. Domitius\r\nAhenobarbus. He fell in this battle on the Guadiana, where he was\r\ndefeated by Hirtuleius.

See the various\r\nreadings in Sintenis: his name was L. Manilius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: I should rather have translated it \"Gaul about Narbo.\"\r\nPlutarch means the Roman Province in Gaul, which was called\r\nNarbonensis, from the town of Narbo Martius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: Commonly called Pompey the Great, whose name occurs in\r\nthe Lives of Sulla, Lucullus, and Crassus.

There were two places of the name, it\r\nis said, and one is placed near the mouth of the Douro. It is useless\r\nto attempt to fix the position of the Langobritæ from what Plutarch\r\nhas said.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143: Or Aquinus or Aquilius. Cornelius Aquinus was his\r\nname.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: Osca was a town in the north-east of Spain, probably\r\nHuesca in Aragon. Mannert observes that this school must have greatly\r\ncontributed to fix the Latin language in Spain. Spain however already\r\ncontained Roman settlers, and at a later period it contained numerous\r\nRoman colonies: in fact the Peninsula was completely Romanized, of\r\nwhich the Spanish language and the establishment of the Roman Law in\r\nSpain are the still existing evidence. The short-lived school of\r\nSertorius could not have done much towards fixing the Latin language\r\nin Spain.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: The Bulla was of a round form. See the copy of one from\r\nthe British Museum in Smith's 'Dict. of Greek and Roman Antiquities.'\r\nKaltwasser refers to Plutarch's Life of Romulus, c. 20, and his 'Roman\r\nQuestions,' Part 3, in which he explains what the Bulla is.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: The Greek word [Greek: kataspeisis] κατάσπεισις\r\nsignifies a \"pouring out.\" Kaltwasser refers to a passage in Cæsar's\r\n'Gallic War,' iii. 22, in which he speaks of the \"devoted\" (devoti),\r\nwhom the Aquitani called Soldurii. As the Aquitani bordered on the\r\nPyrenees, it is not surprising that the like usage prevailed among\r\nthem and the Iberians.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: The orthography is Perperna, as is proved by\r\ninscriptions. M. Perperna, the grandfather of this Perperna, was\r\nconsul B.C. 130. (see Life of Tib. Gracchus, c. 20, Notes.) The son of\r\nM. Perperna also was consul B.C. 92: he did not die till B.C. 49, and\r\nconsequently survived his son, this Perperna of Plutarch. Perperna\r\nVento had been prætor. He associated himself with Lepidus after the\r\ndeath of Sulla, and was like M. Lepidus driven from Rome (Life of\r\nSulla, c. 34, Notes).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: This is the Ebro, which the Romans called Iberus, the\r\nlarge river which flows in a south-east direction and enters the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Plutarch here means the nations between the Ebro and the\r\nPyrenees, or the modern Aragon, Navarre, and Catalonia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: The story is told by Frontinus, _Stratagemata_, i. 10,\r\nas Kaltwasser observes, and again, in iv. 7, in the very same words.\r\nIt has been often remarked that Horatius probably alludes to this\r\nstory (ii. _Epist._ I, 45).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 150: The Tagonius is either the Tagus (Tajo), or a branch of\r\nthat large river, on the banks of which the Carpetani are placed by\r\ngeographers, who also mark Caraca, a position on the Henares, a branch\r\nof the Tagus. If Caraca represents the country of the Charicatani, the\r\nTagonius is the Nares or Henares, on which stood Complutum, the modern\r\nAlcalá de Henarea. But all this is merely conjecture.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 151: Lauron is placed near the coast, and near the outlet of\r\nthe Sucro river, the modern Xucar. There was also a town Sucro near\r\nthe mouth of the Sucro. Appian (_Civil Wars_, i. 109) says that when\r\nthe city was captured, a soldier attempted violence on a woman\r\n([Greek: para phusin] παρὰ φύσιν), who tore out his eyes with her\r\nfingers. Sertorius, who knew that the whole cohort was addicted to\r\ninfamous practices, put them all to death though they were Romans.\r\nFrontinus (_Stratagem._ ii. 5) has a long account of this affair at\r\nLauron, for which he quotes Livius, who says that Pompeius lost ten\r\nthousand men and all his baggage.\r\n\r\nPompeius began his Spanish campaign B.C. 76.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 152: These names are very uncertain in Plutarch. Tuttia may\r\nbe the Turia, now the Guadalaviar, the river of Valencia, the outlet\r\nof which is about twenty-five miles north of the outlet of the Sucro.\r\nOther readings are Duria and Dusia (see the notes of Sintenis). If\r\nthese rivers are properly identified, this campaign was carried on in\r\nthe plains of the kingdom of Valencia. Tutia is mentioned by Florus\r\n(iii. 22) as one of the Spanish towns which surrendered to Pompeius\r\nafter the death of Sertorius and Perperna.\r\n\r\nKaltwasser refers to Frontinus, who speaks of one Hirtuleius, or\r\nHerculeius in some editions, as a general of Sertorius who was\r\ndefeated by Metellus (_Stratagem_, ii. 1). In another passage (ii. 7)\r\nFrontinus states that Sertorius during a battle being informed by a\r\nnative that Hirtuleius hod fallen, stabbed the man that he might not\r\ncarry the news to others, and so dispirit his soldiers. Plutarch (Life\r\nof Pompeius c. 18) states that Pompeius defeated Herennius and\r\nPerperna near Valentia, and killed above ten thousand of their men.\r\nThis is apparently the same battle that Plutarch is here speaking of.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 153: See the Life of Pompeius, c. 19; and Appian (_Civil\r\nWars_, i. 110), who states that the battle took place near the town of\r\nSuero (which would be the more correct translation of the text of\r\nPlutarch), and that the wing which Perperna commanded was defeated by\r\nMetellus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 154: This L. Afranius is the man whom Cicero calls \"Auli\r\nfilius\" (_Ad Attic,_ i. 16), by which he meant that he was of obscure\r\norigin. He was consul with Q. Metellus Celer B.C. 60. Afranius and\r\nPetreius commanded for Pompeius in Spain B.C. 49, but C. Julius Cæsar\r\ncompelled them to surrender, and pardoned them on the condition that\r\nthey should not again serve against him. Afranius broke his promise\r\nand again joined Pompeius. He was in the battle of Thapsus in Africa\r\nB.C. 46, and after the defeat he attempted to escape into Mauritania,\r\nbut was caught and given up to Cæsar, and shortly afterwards put to\r\ndeath by the soldiers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 155: Appian (_Civil Wars_, i. 110) has the same story about\r\nthe dear being found.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 156: Seguntum, or Saguntia, as it is written in Appian (i.\r\n110). It is not certain what place is meant. Some critics would read\r\n\"in the plains of the Saguntini,\" by which might be meant the\r\nneighbourhood of Saguntum, a town on the east coast between the mouths\r\nof the Ebro and the Xucar, which was taken by Hannibal in the second\r\nPunic War (Liv. 21, c. 15). The maps place a Segontia on the Tagonius,\r\nanother on the Salo (Xalon), a branch of the Ebro, and a Saguntia in\r\nthe country of the Vaccæi on the northern branch of the Douro.\r\nPompeius in his letter to the Senate speaks of the capture of the camp\r\nof Sertorius near Sucro, his defeat on the Durius, and the capture of\r\nValentia. If the Durius be the Douro, this Segontia may be one of the\r\ntowns called Segontia in the north-west of Spain. But the Durius may\r\nbe the Turia, the river of Valentia, and Segontia may be Saguntum. The\r\nfact of Pompeius wintering among the Vaccæi is perhaps in favour of a\r\nnorth-west Segontia; but still I think that Saguntum was the\r\nbattle-field. This battle is mentioned by Appian (_Civil Wars_, i.\r\n110), who says that Pompeius lost six thousand men, but that Metellus\r\ndefeated Perperua, who lost about five thousand men.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 157: The Vaccæi occupied part of the country immediately\r\nnorth of the Durius (Douro); but the limits cannot be accurately\r\ndefined.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 158: Compare the Life of Lucullus, c. 5, and the Life of\r\nCrassus, c. 11. The letter of Pompeius to the Senate is in the third\r\nbook of the Fragments of the Roman History of Sallustius. The letter\r\nconcludes with the following words, which Plutarch had apparently\r\nread: \"Ego non rem familiarem modo, verum etiam fidem consumpsi.\r\nReliqui vos estis, qui nisi subvenitis, invito et praedicente me,\r\nexercitus hinc et cum eo omne bellum Hispaniae in Italiam\r\ntransgredientur.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 159: This appears to be the event which is described in the\r\nfragment of the Second Book of the History of Sallustius, which is\r\npreserved by Macrobius, _Saturnalia_, ii. 9, in the chapter \"De\r\nLuxu.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: Compare the Life of Sulla, c. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: See the Life of Sulla, c. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 162: Kaltwasser quotes Reiske, who observes that Plutarch,\r\nwho wrote under the Empire, expresses himself after the fashion of his\r\nage, when the Roman Cæsars lived on the Palatine.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 163: The treaty with Mithridates was made B.C. 75. This\r\nMarius is mentioned in the Life of Lucullus, c. 8. Appian\r\n(_Mithridatic War_, c. 68) calls him Marcus Varius, and also states\r\nthat Sertorius agreed to give Mithridates, Asia, Bithynia,\r\nPaphlagonia, Cappadocia, and Galatia. In the matter of Asia the\r\nnarratives of Plutarch and Appian are directly opposed to one\r\nanother.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 164: This may be literally rendered \"Marcus Marius together\r\nwith whom Mithridates having captured some of the Asiatic cities;\"\r\nKaltwasser renders it, \"in connection with him (Marcus Marius)\r\nMithrdates conquered some towns in Asia.\" But the context shows that\r\nMarcus Marius was to be considered the principal, and that the towns\r\nwere not conquered in order to be given to Mithridates.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 165: Compare the Life of Lucullus, c. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 166: Appian (_Civil Wars_, i. 112) does not mention this\r\nmassacre of the Iberian boys; but he states that Sertorius had become\r\nodious to the Romans whom he now distrusted, and that he employed\r\nIberians instead of the Romans as his body-guard. He also adds that\r\nthe character of Sertorius was changed, that he gave himself up to\r\nwine and women, and was continually sustaining defeats. These\r\ncircumstances and fear for his own life, according to Appian, led\r\nPerperna to conspire against Sertorius (i. 113).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 167: Perhaps Octavius Gracimus, as the name appears in\r\nFrontinus (_Stratagem._ ii. 5, 31).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: [Greek: tê bradutêti tês lalias.] τῆ βραδυτῆτι τῆς\r\nλαλιᾶς The meaning of these words may be doubtful; but what I have\r\ngiven is perhaps consistent with the Greek and with the circumstances.\r\nThere was some hesitation about beginning the attack, and the flagging\r\nof the conversation was a natural consequence.\r\n\r\nSertorius was murdered B.C. 72, in the consulship of L. Gellius\r\nPublicola and Cn. Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus, in the eighth year of\r\nhis command in Spain. (Livius, _Epitom._ 96.) Accordingly this places\r\nthe commencement of his command in B.C. 80; but he went to Spain in\r\nB.C. 82, or at the end of B.C. 83. See Notes on c. 6. Appian (_Civil\r\nWars_, i. 114) states that when the will of Sertorius was opened it\r\nwas discovered that he had placed Perperna among his heredes, a\r\ncircumstance which throws doubt on the assertion of Appian that\r\nPerperna was afraid that Sertorius intended to take his life. Appian\r\nadds that when this was known, it created great enmity against\r\nPerperna among his followers.\r\n\r\nPlutarch's estimate of Sertorius may be a favourable one; yet he does\r\nnot omit to mention that act of his life which was most blamable, the\r\nmassacre of the youths at Osca. From the slight indications in\r\nFrontinus, who found some material for his work on Military Stratagems\r\nin the campaigns of Sertorius, and from other passages, we may collect\r\nthat, however mild the temper of Sertorius was, circumstances must\r\noften have compelled him to acts of severity and even cruelty. The\r\ndifficulties of his position can only be estimated when we reflect on\r\nthe nature of a campaign in many parts of Spain and the kind of\r\nsoldiers he had under him. Promptitude and decision were among his\r\ncharacteristics; and in such a warfare promptitude and decision cannot\r\nbe exercised at the time when alone they are of any use, if a man is\r\nswayed by any other considerations than those of prudence and\r\nnecessity in the hour of danger. A general who could stab one of his\r\nown men in the heat of battle, to prevent him dispiriting the army by\r\nnews of a loss, proved that his judgment was as clear as his\r\ndetermination was resolved.\r\n\r\nPlutarch's narrative is of no value as a campaign, and his apology\r\nmust be that he was not writing a campaign, but delineating a man's\r\ncharacter. Drumann _Geschichte Roms_, Pompeius, p. 350, &c.) has\r\nattempted to give a connected history of this campaign against\r\nSertorius, and he has probably done it as well as it can be done with\r\nsuch materials as we possess. The map of Antient Spain and Portugal\r\npublished by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, will\r\nbe useful for reading the sketch in Drumann. Plutarch had no good map,\r\nand, as already observed, he was not writing a campaign. Some modern\r\nhistorical writers, who have maps, seem to have made very little use\r\nof them; and their narrative of military transactions is often us\r\nconfused as Plutarch's.\r\n\r\nThe nature of Guerilla warfare in Spain may be learned from the\r\nhistory of the Peninsular War. The difficulties of a campaign in\r\nNavarre and the Basque provinces are well shown in the campaigns of\r\nZumalacarregui, the Carlist chief, a modern Sertorius, whose\r\nextraordinary career was cut short by a chance ball before the walls\r\nof Bilbao, in 1835. (Henningsen, _The most striking Events of a\r\nTwelve-month's Campaign with Zumalacarregui_, London, 1836.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 169: Metellus marched to another part of Spain, and left\r\nPompeius to deal with Perperna. According to Appian's narrative the\r\ndecisive action between Pompeius and Perperna took place \"on the tenth\r\nday,\" probably the tenth from the death of Sertorius. Pompeius would\r\nnot see Perperna after he was taken, and prudently put him to death.\r\n\"The death of Sertorius,\" says Appian, \"was the end of the Spanish\r\nwar, and it is probable that if Sertorius had lived, it would not have\r\nbeen terminated so soon, or so easily.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF EUMENES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The historian Douris tells us that the father of Eumenes of Kardia\r\nwas so poor that he was obliged to act as a waggoner; yet he gave his\r\nson a liberal education both in mental and bodily exercises. While\r\nEumenes was yet a lad, Philip, King of Macedon, happened to come to\r\nthe city of Kardia, where he amused his leisure time by witnessing the\r\ngymnastic exercises of the young men. Perceiving that Eumenes was one\r\nof the most athletic, and that he was a manly and clever boy, Philip\r\ntook him away and attached him to his own person. A more probable\r\nstory is that Philip gave the boy this advancement out of regard for\r\nhis father, whose friend and guest he was. After the death of Philip,\r\nEumenes continued in the service of his son Alexander, and was thought\r\nto be as wise and as faithful as any of that prince's servants. His\r\nposition was nominally that of chief secretary, but he was treated\r\nwith as much honour and respect as the king's most intimate friends,\r\nand was entrusted with an independent command during the Indian\r\ncampaign. On the death of Hephæstion, Perdikkas was appointed to\r\nsucceed him, and Eumenes was given the post of commander of the\r\ncavalry, vacated by Perdikkas. Upon this Neoptolemus, the chief of the\r\nmen-at-arms, sneered at Eumenes, saying that he himself bore a spear\r\nand shield in Alexander's service, but that Eumenes bore a pen and\r\nwriting-tablets. However the Macedonian chiefs laughed him to scorn,\r\nas they well knew the worth of Eumenes, and that he was so highly\r\nesteemed that Alexander himself had done him the honour to make him\r\nhis kinsman by marriage. He bestowed upon him Barsine, the sister of\r\nthat daughter of Artabazus by whom he himself had a son named\r\nHerakles, and gave her other sister Apame to Ptolemæus at the time\r\nwhen he distributed the other Persian ladies among his followers.\r\n\r\nII. Eumenes however was often in danger of incurring the displeasure\r\nof Alexander, because of his favourite Hephæstion. On one occasion a\r\nhouse was assigned to Evion, Hephæstion's flute-player, which the\r\nservants of Eumenes had previously claimed for their master's lodging.\r\nHearing this, Eumenes went to Alexander in a rage, and complained that\r\nit was better to be a flute-player than a soldier. At first Alexander\r\nagreed with him, and blamed Hephæstion for his conduct. But afterwards\r\nhe changed his mind, and attributed what Eumenes had done to a desire\r\nto insult himself, rather than to vindicate his rights against\r\nHephæstion. At another time, when Alexander was about to despatch\r\nNearchus with a fleet to explore the Atlantic, he asked his friends to\r\nsubscribe some money, as he had none in his treasury. The sum for\r\nwhich Eumenes was asked was three hundred talents, of which he only\r\npaid one hundred, and said that he had had great difficulty in\r\ncollecting even that amount. Alexander did not reproach him, nor take\r\nthe money from him; but he ordered his slaves secretly to set the tent\r\nof Eumenes on fire, hoping when his property was brought out of it to\r\nprove him to have lied in saying that he possessed so little money.\r\nHowever the tent burned quicker than was expected, and Alexander was\r\nsorry that he had destroyed all the papers and writings which it\r\ncontained. There was found in the ruins more than a thousand talents'\r\nworth of gold and silver, melted by the heat of the fire. Of this\r\nAlexander refused to take any, but sent orders to all the officers of\r\nhis kingdom to replace the accounts and writings which had been\r\ndestroyed. Once again too he quarrelled with Hephæstion about some\r\npresent to which each laid claim. They each abused the other roundly,\r\nbut Eumenes came off the victor. Shortly afterwards, however,\r\nHephæstion died, to the great grief of Alexander, who was enraged with\r\nall those who had disliked Hephæstion when alive, and were pleased at\r\nhis death. He regarded Eumenes with especial hatred, and frequently\r\nreferred to his quarrels with Hephæstion. Eumenes, however, being a\r\nshrewd man, determined that what seemed likely to become his ruin\r\nshould prove his salvation. He won Alexander's favour by inventing new\r\nand extravagant modes of showing honour to his friend, and spent money\r\nprofusely in providing him with a splendid funeral.\r\n\r\nIII. When Alexander himself died, and the Macedonian army quarrelled\r\nwith its chiefs, he in reality espoused the cause of the latter,\r\nalthough he declared that he belonged to neither party, modestly\r\nobserving that it was not for him, a stranger, to interfere in the\r\nquarrels of Macedonians with one another. In the general division of\r\nAlexander's conquests which then took place, Eumenes obtained\r\nCappadocia, Paphlagonia, and the coast of the Euxine sea as far as\r\nTrapezus.[170] This country was not yet conquered by the Macedonians,\r\nbut was ruled by Ariarathes, and Leonnatus and Antigonus were\r\nrequested by Perdikkas to come with a large army to put Eumenes in\r\npossession of his principality. Antigonus took no heed of this\r\ncommand, as he was already revolving immense schemes of conquest, and\r\nbeginning to despise his colleagues. Leonnatus, however, did begin to\r\nmarch an army towards Phrygia, intending to help Eumenes, but on the\r\nway he was met by Hekatæus the despot of Kardia, who besought him to\r\nassist the Macedonians under Antipater, who were being besieged in the\r\ncity of Lamia. Leonnatus on hearing this became eager to cross his\r\narmy over the straits into Europe; and consequently he sent for\r\nEumenes and reconciled him with Hekatæus. These two men had always\r\nbeen at enmity with one another on political grounds. Eumenes had\r\noften endeavoured to use his influence with Alexander to crush\r\nHekatæus, and restore liberty to the oppressed citizens of Kardia, and\r\nnever ceased accusing him of tyranny and injustice. On this occasion\r\nEumenes refused to take part in the expedition into Europe, stating\r\nthat he feared Antipater, who had always been his enemy, and who would\r\nbe very likely to assassinate him to please Hekatæus. In answer to\r\nthese objections Leonnatus unfolded to him his secret plans. His march\r\nto relieve Antipater was merely intended as a pretence to cover his\r\nreal object, which was to attempt to make himself master of\r\nMacedonia. He also showed Eumenes several letters which he had\r\nreceived from Pella, in which Kleopatra offered to marry him if he\r\nwould march thither. However Eumenes, either because he feared\r\nAntipater, or because he thought Leonnatus to be embarked upon a rash\r\nand crazy enterprise, left him by night, taking with him all his\r\nproperty. He was attended by three hundred horsemen, and two hundred\r\narmed slaves, and had with him treasure to the amount of five thousand\r\ntalents. He fled at once to Perdikkas, and betrayed all Leonnatus's\r\nplans to him, by which treachery he gained great favour with\r\nPerdikkas, and soon afterwards was established in his government of\r\nCappadocia by an army led by Perdikkas himself. Ariarathes was taken\r\nprisoner, the country subdued and Eumenes proclaimed satrap over it.\r\nHe distributed the government of the various cities amongst his\r\nfriends, established garrisons, courts of justice, and receivers of\r\nrevenue, as an absolute ruler, without any interference from\r\nPerdikkas. But when Perdikkas left the country Eumenes followed him,\r\nas he did not wish to be away from the court of that prince.\r\n\r\nIV. However, Perdikkas considered that he was well able to carry out\r\nhis own designs abroad, but required an active and faithful lieutenant\r\nto guard what he already possessed at home. Consequently when he\r\nreached Cilicia he sent Eumenes back, nominally to his own government,\r\nbut really to observe Armenia where Neoptolemus was endeavouring to\r\nraise a revolt. Eumenes had frequent interviews with this man, who was\r\nof a flighty and vainglorious character, and tried to restrain him\r\nfrom any act of open rebellion. Perceiving also that the Macedonian\r\nphalanx was grown very strong, and gave itself most insolent airs, he\r\ndetermined to raise up some counterpoise to it, in the shape of a\r\nforce of cavalry.\r\n\r\nHe set free from all taxes and state payments whatever those men of\r\nhis province who were able to serve as horse soldiers, and bestowed\r\nfine horses, purchased by himself, upon their officers and those whom\r\nhe especially trusted. He divided them into regiments, frequently\r\nbestowed upon them honours and rewards, and constantly exercised them\r\nin the performance of military manœuvres. Some of the Macedonians\r\nwere alarmed, but others were delighted to see in how short a time he\r\nhad raised a force of no less than six thousand three hundred cavalry\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nV. When Kraterus and Antipater, having made themselves masters of\r\nGreece, crossed over into Asia to destroy the kingdom of Perdikkas,\r\nand were about to invade Cappadocia, Eumenes was appointed by\r\nPerdikkas, who was absent on a campaign against Ptolemy, to be\r\ncommander-in-chief of the forces in Cappadocia and Armenia. He also\r\nsent letters, ordering Neoptolemus and Alketas to place themselves\r\nunder the orders of Eumenes. Alketas at once refused to serve under\r\nhim, alleging that the Macedonian troops which he commanded would be\r\nashamed to fight against Antipater, and were willing to receive\r\nKraterus as their king. Neoptolemus also no longer concealed the\r\ntreachery which he had so long meditated, and when summoned by Eumenes\r\nto join him, answered by drawing up his men in order of battle. Now\r\ndid Eumenes reap the fruits of his prudence and foresight; for though\r\nhis infantry was vanquished, yet his cavalry completely overthrew\r\nNeoptolemus, and captured all his baggage. He also caught the phalanx\r\nof the enemy when disordered by its victory, and forced it to\r\nsurrender at discretion, and swear allegiance to himself. Neoptolemus\r\nfled with a few followers and joined Kraterus and Antipater, by whom\r\nan embassy had been sent to Eumenes to offer him the peaceful\r\nenjoyment of his government if he would join them, and likewise a\r\nlarge accession of territory and force, on condition that he would\r\ncease to regard Antipater with dislike and would not become an enemy\r\nto his friend Kraterus. To these overtures Eumenes answered that he\r\nhad long hated Antipater, and was not likely to begin to love him now,\r\nwhen he saw him making war against his own friends, but that he was\r\nwilling to act as mediator between Kraterus and Perdikkas, if they\r\nwished to arrange a fair and honourable peace. He declared that as\r\nlong as he had breath in his body he would resist all unjust schemes\r\nof spoliation, and would rather lose his life than betray the\r\nconfidence bestowed upon him by Perdikkas.\r\n\r\nVI. When Eumenes returned this answer to Antipater, he was\r\ndeliberating what was the next step to take, when suddenly Neoptolemus\r\narrived bringing the news of his defeat, and begging for immediate\r\nassistance. He wished one of the chiefs to accompany him, but\r\nespecially Kraterus, declaring that he was so popular with the\r\nMacedonians that if they so much as caught sight of his broad-brimmed\r\nMacedonian hat, and heard his voice, they would go over to him in a\r\nbody. Indeed the name of Kraterus had great influence with the\r\nMacedonians, and he was their favourite general now that Alexander was\r\ndead, for they remembered how steadfast a friend Kraterus had proved\r\nto them, and how he had often incurred the anger of Alexander by\r\nopposing his adoption of Persian habits, and standing by his\r\ncountrymen when they were in danger of being neglected and despised by\r\na corrupt and effeminate court. Kraterus accordingly sent Antipater\r\ninto Cilicia, and himself with the greater part of the army marched\r\nwith Neoptolemus to fight Eumenes, whom he imagined he should catch\r\nunawares, engaged in feasting and celebrating his late victory. It did\r\nnot argue any very great skill in Eumenes, that he soon became aware\r\nof the march of Kraterus to attack him; but to conceal his own weak\r\npoints, not only from the enemy, but also from his own troops, and\r\nactually to force them to attack Kraterus without knowing against whom\r\nthey fought, appears to me to have been the act of a consummate\r\ngeneral. He gave out that Neoptolemus and Pigres were about to attack\r\nhim a second time, with some Cappadocian and Paphlagonian cavalry. On\r\nthe night when he intended to start he fell asleep and dreamed a\r\nstrange dream. He seemed to see two Alexanders, each at the head of a\r\nphalanx, preparing to fight one another. Then Athena came to help the\r\none, and Demeter the other. After a hard fight, that championed by\r\nAthena was overcome, and then Demeter gathered ears of corn, and\r\ncrowned the victorious phalanx with them. He at once conceived that\r\nthis dream referred to himself because he was about to fight for a\r\nmost fertile land and one that abounded in corn; for at that time the\r\nwhole country was sown with wheat, as if it were time of peace, and\r\nthe fields promised an abundant harvest. He was confirmed in his idea\r\nof the meaning of his dream when he heard that the watchword of the\r\nenemy was 'Athena,' with the countersign 'Alexander.' Hearing this, he\r\nhimself gave the word 'Demeter,' with the countersign 'Alexander,' and\r\nordered all his soldiers to crown themselves and adorn their arms with\r\nears of wheat. He was often tempted to explain to his officers who it\r\nwas against whom they were about to fight; but in spite of the\r\ninconvenience of such a secret, he decided finally to keep it to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nVII. He was careful not to send any Macedonians to attack Kraterus,\r\nbut entrusted this duty to two divisions of cavalry, which he placed\r\nunder the command respectively of Pharnabazus the son of Artabazus and\r\nPhœnix of Tenedos. These he ordered, as soon as they saw the enemy, to\r\ncharge at full speed, and not to give them time for any parley, or to\r\nsend a herald; for he was grievously afraid that if the Macedonians\r\nrecognized Kraterus they would desert to him. He himself formed three\r\nhundred of the best of his cavalry into a compact mass with which he\r\nproceeded towards the right, to engage the detachment under\r\nNeoptolemus. The main body, as soon as it had passed a small hill,\r\ncame in sight of the enemy and at once charged at full gallop.\r\nKraterus at this broke out into violent abuse of Neoptolemus, saying\r\nthat he had been deceived by him about the Macedonians who were to\r\nhave deserted. However, he called upon those about him to quit them\r\nlike men, and advanced to meet the horsemen.\r\n\r\nThe shock was terrible. Their spears were soon broken, and the fight\r\nwas continued with swords. Kraterus proved no unworthy successor of\r\nAlexander, for he slew many and often rallied his troops, until a\r\nThracian rode at him sideways and struck him from his horse. No one\r\nrecognized him as he lay on the ground except Gorgias, one of the\r\ngenerals of Eumenes, who at once dismounted and kept guard over him,\r\nalthough he was grievously hurt and almost in the death-agony.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Eumenes encountered Neoptolemus. Each had a long-standing\r\ngrudge against the other; but it chanced that in the first two charges\r\nwhich took place they did not see one another. The third time they\r\nrecognized one another, and at once drew their daggers and rode\r\ntogether with loud shouts of defiance. With their reins flowing loose\r\nthey drove their horses against one another like two triremes, and\r\neach clutched at the other as he passed, so that each tore the helmet\r\nfrom the other's head, and burst the fastenings of the corslet upon\r\nhis shoulder. Both fell from their horses, and wrestled together in\r\ndeadly strife on the ground. As Neoptolemus strove to rise, Eumenes\r\nstruck him behind the knee, and leaped upon his own feet, but\r\nNeoptolemus rested upon his other knee, and continued the fight until\r\nhe received a mortal stab in the neck. Eumenes through the mortal hate\r\nwhich he bore him at once fell to stripping him of his armour and\r\nabusing him, forgetting that he was still alive. He received a slight\r\nstab in the groin, but the wound frightened Eumenes more than it hurt\r\nhim, as the hand that dealt it was almost powerless. Yet when Eumenes\r\nhad finished despoiling the corpse he found that he was severely cut\r\nabout the arms and thighs, in spite of which he remounted his horse,\r\nand rode to the other side of the battle-field, where he thought the\r\nenemy might still be offering resistance. Here he heard of the death\r\nof Kraterus, and rode up to where he lay. Finding that he was still\r\nalive and conscious, Eumenes dismounted, and with tears and\r\nprotestations of friendship cursed Neoptolemus and lamented his hard\r\nfate, which had forced him either to kill his old friend and comrade\r\nor to perish at his hands.\r\n\r\nVIII. This victory was won by Eumenes about ten days after his former\r\none. He gained great glory from this double achievement, as he\r\nappeared to have won one battle by courage and the other by\r\ngeneralship. Yet he was bitterly disliked and hated both by his own\r\nmen and by the enemy, because he, a stranger and a foreigner, had\r\nvanquished the most renowned of the Macedonians in fair fight. Now if\r\nPerdikkas had lived to hear of the death of Kraterus, he would have\r\nbeen the chief Macedonian of the age; but the news of his death\r\nreached the camp of Perdikkas two days after that prince had fallen in\r\na skirmish with the Egyptians, and the enraged Macedonian soldiery\r\nvowed vengeance against Eumenes. Antigonus and Antipater at once\r\ndeclared war against him: and when they heard that Eumenes, passing by\r\nMount Ida where the king[171] used to keep a breed of horses, took as\r\nmany as he required and sent an account of his doing so to the Masters\r\nof the Horse, Antipater is said to have laughed and declared that he\r\nadmired the wariness of Eumenes, who seemed to expect that he would be\r\ncalled upon to give an account of what he had done with the king's\r\nproperty. Eumenes had intended to fight a battle on the plains of\r\nLydia near Sardis, because his chief strength lay in his cavalry, and\r\nalso to let Kleopatra[172] see how powerful he was; but at her\r\nparticular request, for she was afraid to give umbrage to Antipater,\r\nhe marched into Upper Phrygia, and passed the winter in the city of\r\nKelainæ. While here, Alketas, Polemon, and Dokimus caballed against\r\nhim, claiming the supreme command for themselves. Hereupon Eumenes\r\nquoted the proverb, \"No one reflects that he who rules must die.\"\r\n\r\nHe now promised his soldiers that in three days he would give them\r\ntheir pay, and accomplished this by selling the various fortified\r\nvillages and castles in the neighbourhood to them, all of which were\r\nfull of human beings to sell for slaves, and of cattle. The officers\r\nwho bought these places from Eumenes were supplied by him with\r\nsiege-artillery to take them, and the proceeds of the plunder were set\r\noff against the arrears of pay due to the soldiers. This proceeding\r\nmade Eumenes very popular with his army, indeed, when a proclamation\r\nwas distributed in his camp by contrivance of the enemy, in which a\r\nreward of a hundred talents and special honours were offered to the\r\nman who would kill Eumenes, the Macedonians were greatly enraged, and\r\ndetermined that a body-guard of one thousand men, of the best families\r\nin Macedonia, should watch over his safety day and night. The soldiers\r\nobeyed him with alacrity and were proud to receive from his hands the\r\nsame marks of favour which kings are wont to bestow upon their\r\nfavourites. Eumenes even took upon himself to give away purple hats\r\nand cloaks, which is accounted the most royal present of all by the\r\nMacedonians.\r\n\r\nIX. Success exalts even mean minds, and men always appear to have a\r\ncertain dignity when in high station and power; but the truly great\r\nman proves his greatness more by the way in which he bears up against\r\nmisfortunes and endures evil days, as did Eumenes. He was defeated by\r\nAntigonus in Southern Cappadocia by treachery, but when forced to\r\nretreat he did not allow the traitor who had betrayed him to make good\r\nhis escape to Antigonus, but took him and hanged him on the spot. He\r\nmanaged to retreat by a different road to that on which the enemy were\r\npursuing, and then suddenly turning about, encamped on the\r\nbattle-field of the day before. Here he collected the dead bodies,\r\nburned them with the timber of the houses in the neighbouring\r\nvillages, and raised separate barrows over the remains of the officers\r\nand the men--monuments of his hardihood and presence of mind which\r\nexcited the admiration of Antigonus himself when he again passed that\r\nway. The two armies were still sometimes so near each other, that\r\nEumenes once had an opportunity of making himself master of the whole\r\nof the enemy's baggage, which would have enriched his troops with an\r\nimmense booty. He feared that the possession of such wealth would\r\nrender them eager to quit his toilsome and perilous service, and sent\r\nsecret warning under the pretext of private friendship to Menander,\r\nthe general who had been left in charge of the baggage, and enabled\r\nhim to withdraw into an unassailable position. This seemingly generous\r\naction excited the gratitude of the Macedonians, whose wives and\r\nchildren it had saved from slavery and dishonour, till Antigonus\r\npointed out to them that Eumenes had spared them only that he might\r\nnot encumber himself.[173] X. After this, Eumenes, who was being\r\nconstantly pursued by a superior force, recommended the greater part\r\nof his men to return to their homes. This he did either because he was\r\nanxious for their safety, or because he did not wish to drag about\r\nwith him a force which was too small to fight, and too large to move\r\nwith swiftness and secrecy. He himself took refuge in the impregnable\r\nfortress of Nora, on the borders of Cappadocia and Lycaonia, with five\r\nhundred horse and two hundred foot soldiers, and dismissed from thence\r\nwith kind speeches and embraces, all of his friends who wished to\r\nleave the fortress, dismayed by the prospect of the dreary\r\nimprisonment which awaited them during a long siege in such a place.\r\nAntigonus when he arrived summoned Eumenes to a conference before\r\nbeginning the siege, to which he answered, that Antigonus had many\r\nfriends and officers, while he had none remaining with him, so that\r\nunless Antigonus would give him hostages for his safety, he would not\r\ntrust himself with him. Upon this Antigonus bade him remember that he\r\nwas speaking to his superior. \"While I can hold my sword,\" retorted\r\nEumenes, \"I acknowledge no man as my superior.\" However, after\r\nAntigonus had sent his cousin Ptolemæus into the fortress, as Eumenes\r\nhad demanded, he came down to meet Antigonus, whom he embraced in a\r\nfriendly manner, as became men who had once been intimate friends and\r\ncomrades. They talked for a long time, and Eumenes astonished all the\r\nassembly by his courage and spirit; for he did not ask for his life,\r\nand for peace, as they expected, but demanded to be reinstated in his\r\ngovernment, and to have all the grants which he had received from\r\nPerdikkas restored to him. The Macedonians meanwhile flocked round\r\nhim, eager to see what sort of man this Eumenes was, of whom they had\r\nheard so much; for since the death of Kraterus no one had been talked\r\nof so much as Eumenes in the Macedonian camp. Antigonus began to fear\r\nfor his safety; he ordered them to keep at a distance, and at last\r\nthrowing his arms round the waist of Eumenes conducted him back\r\nthrough a passage formed by his guards to the foot of the fortress.\r\n\r\nXI. After this Antigonus invested the place with a double wall of\r\ncircumvallation, left a force sufficient to guard it, and marched\r\naway. Eumenes was now closely besieged. There was plenty of water,\r\ncorn, and salt in the fortress, but nothing else to eat or to drink.\r\nYet he managed to render life cheerful, inviting all the garrison in\r\nturn to his own table, and entertaining his guests with agreeable and\r\nlively conversation. He himself was no sturdy warrior, worn with toil\r\nand hardships, but a figure of the most delicate symmetry, seemingly\r\nin all the freshness of youth, with a gentle and engaging aspect. He\r\nwas no orator, but yet was fascinating in conversation, as we may\r\npartly learn from his letters. During this siege, as he perceived that\r\nthe men, cooped up in such narrow limits and eating their food without\r\nexercise, would lose health, and also that the horses would lose\r\ncondition if they never used their limbs, while it was most important\r\nthat, if they were required for a sudden emergency, they should be\r\nable to gallop, he arranged the largest room in the fort, fourteen\r\ncubits in length, as a place of exercise for the men, and ordered them\r\nto walk there, gradually quickening their pace, so as to combine\r\nexercise with amusement. For the horses, he caused their necks to be\r\nhoisted by pulleys fastened in the roof of their stable, until their\r\nfore feet barely touched the ground. In this uneasy position they were\r\nexcited by their grooms with blows and shouts until the struggle\r\nproduced the effect of a hard ride, as they sprung about and stood\r\nalmost erect upon their hind legs till the sweat poured off them, so\r\nthat this exercise proved no bad training either for strength or\r\nspeed. They were fed with bruised barley, as being more quickly and\r\neasily digested.\r\n\r\nXII. After this siege had lasted for some time, Antigonus learned that\r\nAntipater had died in Macedonia, and that Kassander and Polysperchon\r\nwere fighting for his inheritance. He now conceived great hopes of\r\ngaining the supreme power for himself, and desired to have Eumenes as\r\nhis friend and assistant in effecting this great design. He sent\r\nHieronymus of Kardia, a friend of Eumenes, to make terms with him.\r\nHieronymus proffered a written agreement to Eumenes, which Eumenes\r\namended, and thus appealed to the Macedonians who were besieging him\r\nto decide between the two forms, as to which was the most just.\r\nAntigonus for decency's sake had mentioned the names of the royal\r\nfamily of Macedonia in the beginning of his agreement, but at the end\r\nof it demanded that Eumenes should swear fealty to himself. Eumenes\r\ncorrected this by inserting the names of Queen Olympias and all the\r\nroyal family, and then took a solemn oath of fealty, not to Antigonus\r\nalone, but to Olympias and all the royal house of Macedonia. This form\r\nwas thought more reasonable by the Macedonians, who swore Eumenes\r\naccording to it, raised the siege, and sent to Antigonus that he also\r\nmight swear in the same form as Eumenes. After this Eumenes delivered\r\nup all the Cappadocian hostages in Nora, soon collected a force of\r\nlittle less than a thousand men, from his old soldiers who were still\r\nroaming about that country, and rode off with them, as he very rightly\r\ndistrusted Antigonus, who as soon as he heard of what had happened,\r\nsent orders to the Macedonians to continue the siege, and bitterly\r\nreproached them for allowing Eumenes to amend the form of oath\r\ntendered to him.\r\n\r\nXIII. While Eumenes was retreating he received letters from the party\r\nin Macedonia opposed to Antigonus, in which Olympias begged him to\r\ncome and take the son of Alexander, whose life was threatened, under\r\nhis protection; while Polysperchon and Philip, the king, bade him take\r\nthe command of the army in Cappadocia and make war against Antigonus,\r\nempowering him out of the treasure at Quinda to take five hundred\r\ntalents, as compensation for his own losses, and to make what use he\r\npleased of the remainder for the expenses of the war. He was also\r\ninformed that orders had been sent to Antigenes and Teutamus the\r\ncommanders of the Argyraspides, the celebrated Macedonian regiment\r\nwith the silver shields, to put him in possession of the treasure\r\nwhich they had brought from Susa, and to place themselves with their\r\ntroops under his command.\r\n\r\nAntigenes and Teutamus, on receiving these orders, received Eumenes\r\nwith all outward manifestations of friendship, but were really full of\r\nconcealed rage at being superseded by him. He, however, judiciously\r\nallayed their wrath by refusing to take the money, which he said he\r\ndid not need, while as they were both unwilling to obey and unable to\r\ncommand, he called in the aid of superstition, and declared that\r\nAlexander himself had appeared to him in a dream, as when alive,\r\narrayed in the ensigns of royalty, seated in his tent, and despatching\r\naffairs of state, and he proposed that they should erect a magnificent\r\ntent, should place a golden throne in the centre, on which should be\r\nlaid a diadem, sceptre and royal apparel, and that there they should\r\ntransact business as in the presence of the king. Antigenes and\r\nTeutamus willingly agreed to this proposal, which flattered their\r\nself-love by seeming to place them on an equality with Eumenes.\r\n\r\nAs they marched up the country they were met by Peukestas, a friend of\r\nEumenes, and by several other satraps, or provincial governors, who\r\ncame accompanied by considerable bodies of troops, whose numbers and\r\nexcellent equipment and discipline gave great encouragement to the\r\nMacedonian soldiery.\r\n\r\nBut these satraps, since the death of Alexander, had become dissolute,\r\nlicentious, and effeminate princes, with all the vices of Eastern\r\ndespots. They perpetually intrigued and quarrelled with one another,\r\nwhile they courted the Macedonians by profuse liberality, providing\r\nthem with magnificent banquets and unlimited wine, until they entirely\r\nruined the discipline of their camp, and led them to meditate choosing\r\ntheir leaders by a popular vote, as is done in republican cities.\r\nEumenes, perceiving that the satraps mistrusted one another, but that\r\nthey all agreed in hating and fearing himself, and only wanted an\r\nopportunity for having him assassinated, pretended to be in want of\r\nmoney, and borrowed large sums from those whom he chiefly suspected of\r\ndesigns against his person, so that he secured the safety of his\r\nperson by taking other men's money, an object which most people are\r\nglad to attain by giving their own.\r\n\r\nXIV. While the peace lasted, the Macedonian soldiery willingly\r\nlistened to the flattering promises of the satraps, each of whom\r\nwished to raise a force and make war upon the others; but when\r\nAntigonus moved to attack them with a large army, and a real general\r\nwas imperatively demanded to meet him, then not only the soldiers\r\nimplicitly obeyed Eumenes, but even those princes who during the peace\r\nhad affected such airs of independence lowered their tone and each\r\nwithout a murmur proceeded to his appointed duty. When Antigonus was\r\nendeavouring to cross the river Pasitigris, none of the confederates\r\nexcept Eumenes perceived his design, but he boldly withstood him, and\r\nin a pitched battle slew many men, filled the stream with corpses, and\r\ntook four thousand prisoners. And also, when Eumenes fell sick, the\r\nMacedonians clearly proved that they knew that the others could give\r\nthem banquets and fair promises, but that he alone could lead them to\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nWhen the army was in Persia, Peukestas magnificently entertained all\r\nthe soldiers, giving each man a victim for sacrifice, and thought that\r\nby this liberality he had quite won their hearts; but a few days\r\nafterwards, when they came into the presence of the enemy, Eumenes\r\nhappened to be ill, and was being carried in a litter apart from the\r\nnoise of the march in order to obtain rest. As the army gained the\r\ncrest of some low hills they suddenly saw the enemy's troops marching\r\ndown into the plain below. As soon as they saw the head of the column,\r\nwith its gilded arms flashing in the sun, and the elephants with their\r\ntowers and purple trappings, ready for instant attack, the Macedonians\r\nhalted, grounded their arms, and refused to proceed until Eumenes\r\nshould put himself at their head, plainly telling their officers that\r\nthey dared not risk a battle without him for their leader. Eumenes at\r\nonce came to the front at full speed in his litter, of which he caused\r\nthe curtains on both sides to be drawn back, while he waved his hand\r\nto them in delight. They, in return, greeted him in the Macedonian\r\nfashion by shouts and the clash of their arms, and at once took up\r\ntheir shields and levelled their lances with a loud cry, challenging\r\nthe enemy to come and fight them, for they now had a general to lead\r\nthem on.\r\n\r\nXV. Antigonus, who had learned from prisoners that Eumenes was sick\r\nand travelling in a litter, imagined that it would not be difficult to\r\novercome the others, and therefore hastened his march, hoping to bring\r\non a battle while Eumenes was still unable to command. When, however,\r\nas he rode along the enemy's line he observed their admirable order\r\nand arrangement, he hesitated to attack. At last he perceived the\r\nlitter proceeding from one wing to the other. Then, with a loud laugh,\r\nas was his habit when joking with his friends, he exclaimed, \"It is\r\nthat litter, it seems, that is manœuvring against us.\" Saying this,\r\nhe at once withdrew his forces and encamped at some little distance.\r\nThe army of Eumenes, however, soon afterwards, needing refreshment and\r\nrepose, forced their generals to place them in cantonments for the\r\nwinter in the district of Gabiene. These were so scattered, that the\r\nwhole army was spread over a distance of a thousand stades (or a\r\nhundred and twenty-five English miles). Antigonus, hearing this,\r\nmarched suddenly to attack them by a very difficult road, on which no\r\nwater was to be found, but which nevertheless was very short and\r\ndirect. He hoped to fall upon the enemy while scattered in their\r\nwinter quarters, and defeat them before their generals could rally\r\nthem into a compact mass. But as he marched through a desert region\r\nhis army met with strong winds and bitter cold, so that the men were\r\nforced to light large fires to warm themselves, and these gave notice\r\nof their arrival to the enemy; for the natives who inhabited the\r\nmountains near the line of Antigonus's march, when they saw the\r\nnumerous fires lighted by his troops, sent messengers on swift camels\r\nto tell Peukestas what they had observed. He was much alarmed at the\r\nnews, and, noticing that the rest of the satraps shared his fears,\r\nproposed to retreat to the opposite extremity of the province, where\r\nthey might at least reassemble a part of their force before the enemy\r\ncame up. Eumenes, however, calmed their fears by promising that he\r\nwould stop the progress of Antigonus, and prevent his coming to attack\r\nthem until three days after they expected him. His counsels prevailed,\r\nand he at once despatched messengers to call the troops together out\r\nof their winter quarters, and collect all the available force, while\r\nhe himself with the other generals rode to the front, and selecting a\r\nspot which was plainly visible to those crossing the desert, ordered\r\nfires to be lighted at intervals, as though an army were encamped\r\nalong the frontier awaiting the attack of Antigonus. The latter,\r\nobserving the heights covered with watch-fires, was filled with rage\r\nand mortification, imagining that the enemy must long ago have known\r\nhis plans. Fearing to fight with his wearied troops against men who\r\nwere fresh and had been living in comfort, he turned aside from the\r\ndesert, and refreshed his army among some neighbouring villages.\r\nWhen, however, he saw no enemy, or any signs of a hostile army being\r\nnear, and learned from the natives that no troops had been seen by\r\nthem, but only a large number of fires, he perceived that he had been\r\nout-manœuvred by Eumenes, and marched forward in anger, determined to\r\nsettle their disputes by a pitched battle.\r\n\r\nXVI. Meanwhile the greater part of the army of Eumenes had assembled,\r\nand, admiring his stratagem, declared that he alone was fit to be\r\ntheir leader. This so vexed the officers in command of the\r\nArgyraspids, Antigenes, and Teutamus, that they determined to make\r\naway with him, and they held a council with most of the satraps and\r\nofficers of the army to determine how best they might rid themselves\r\nof him. They all agreed that it would be wisest to make use of his\r\ntalents in the approaching battle, and immediately after the battle to\r\nassassinate him. This result of their deliberations was at once\r\nbetrayed to Eumenes by Eudamus, the officer in command of the\r\nelephants, and Phædimus, not from any love they bore to him, but\r\nthrough fear of losing the money which they had lent him. Eumenes\r\nthanked them for their kindness, and afterwards observed to the few\r\nfriends whom he could trust, that he was living amongst a herd of\r\nsavage beasts. He withdrew to his tent, made his will, and destroyed\r\nall his private papers, not wishing after his death to involve any one\r\nin danger. After having made these arrangements, he thought of\r\nallowing the enemy to win the victory, or of escaping through Armenia\r\nand Media into Cappadocia. He came to no decided resolution while his\r\nfriends were present, but merely discussed the various chances which\r\npresented themselves to his versatile intellect, and then proceeded to\r\narray his troops in order of battle, uttering words of encouragement\r\nto them all, whether Greek or barbarian, while he himself was received\r\nwith cheerful and confident shouts by the Argyraspids, who bade him be\r\nof good cheer, as the enemy never could abide their onset. These men\r\nwere the oldest of the soldiers of Philip and Alexander, and had\r\nremained unconquered in battle up to that time, although many of them\r\nwere seventy and none of them were less than sixty years old. They\r\nnow called out, as they moved to attack the troops of Antigonus, \"Ye\r\nare fighting against your fathers, ye unnatural children.\" Charging\r\nwith fury, they broke down all opposition, for no one could stand\r\nbefore them, though most of the enemy died where they stood. On this\r\nside Antigonus was utterly defeated, but his cavalry were victorious;\r\nand through the base and unsoldierly conduct of Peukestas the whole of\r\nthe baggage fell into his hands, by his own great presence of mind and\r\nthe nature of the ground. This was a vast plain, not dusty, and yet\r\nnot hard, but like a sea-beach, composed of a light loose sand,\r\ncovered with a salt crust. Upon this the trampling of so many horses\r\nand men soon raised a cloud of dust through which no object could be\r\nseen, as it whitened the whole air and dazzled the eyes. Through this\r\nAntigonus dashed unnoticed, and made himself master of the baggage,\r\ntogether with the wives and children of the army of Eumenes.\r\n\r\nXVII. When the battle was over, Teutamus at once sent to offer terms\r\nfor the recovery of the baggage. As Antigonus promised that he would\r\ndeliver everything up to the Argyraspids, and that their wives and\r\nchildren should be kindly treated, if Eumenes were placed in his\r\nhands, the Macedonians were treacherous and wicked enough to resolve\r\nto deliver him alive into the hands of his enemies. With this intent\r\nthey drew near to him, on various pretexts, some lamenting their loss,\r\nsome encouraging him because of the victory he had won, and some\r\npreferring charges against the other generals. Suddenly they fell upon\r\nhim, snatched away his sword, and bound his hands. When Nikanor was\r\nsent to conduct him to Antigonus, he asked, while he was passing\r\nthrough the ranks of the Macedonians, to be permitted to address them,\r\nnot with any intention of begging his own life, but that he might\r\nclearly point out to them what was to their own advantage. Silence was\r\nenforced, and Eumenes, standing on a hillock, held forth his fettered\r\nhands, and spoke as follows:--\"Basest of Macedonians, could Antigonus\r\never have erected such a monument of your disgrace as you have set up\r\nyourselves by surrendering your general to him? Is it not shameful for\r\nyou, who have conquered in the battle, to acknowledge yourselves\r\ndefeated because of your baggage, as though victory lay more in money\r\nthan in arms, so that you should ransom your baggage by delivering up\r\nyour general? I indeed am now being carried off captive, an\r\nunconquered man, who has overcome his foes, but has been ruined by his\r\nfriends; but I beseech you in the name of the Zeus that protects\r\narmies, and the gods who watch over the true keeping of oaths, kill me\r\nhere with your own hands; for I shall be slain by you no less when I\r\nam put to death in the enemy's camp. Antigonus cannot complain of this\r\naction of yours, for he wishes to receive Eumenes dead, and not alive.\r\nIf you are chary of your own hands to do the deed, one of mine will\r\nsuffice if you will loose it from its bonds. Or if you will not trust\r\nme with a sword, then cast me, bound as I am, to be trampled on by the\r\nelephants. If you will act thus I will acquit you of all blame, and\r\nwill declare that you have dealt with your general as became\r\nhonourable men.\"\r\n\r\nXVIII. When Eumenes had spoken thus, all the army was grieved and\r\nlamented his fate, but the Argyraspids called out that he must be\r\ncarried away, and no attention paid to his talk; for, they said, it\r\nmattered little what fate befel a pestilent fellow from the\r\nChersonese, who had involved the Macedonians in endless wars and\r\ntroubles, but that it was not to be borne that the bravest of the\r\nsoldiers of Philip and Alexander, after their unheard-of exploits,\r\nshould in their old age be deprived of the fruits of their toils and\r\nbe forced to depend upon charity, or that their wives should pass a\r\nthird night in the enemy's camp. They at once hurried him away. When\r\nhe reached the enemy's quarters, Antigonus, fearing that he would be\r\ncrushed to death by the crowd (for not a man remained in the camp),\r\nsent ten of the strongest elephants, and many Medes and Parthians,\r\narmed with spears, to keep off the press from him. He himself could\r\nnot bear to see Eumenes, because they had once been friends and\r\ncomrades; and when he was asked by those who had charge of his person\r\nhow they were to treat him, answered, \"Like an elephant, or a lion!\"\r\nAfter a while he felt compassion for his sufferings, and ordered his\r\nheavy chains to be removed, appointed an attendant to anoint his\r\nperson, and allowed his friends to have free access to him and supply\r\nhim with provisions. A long debate took place for several days about\r\nthe fate of Eumenes, in which Nearchus, a Cretan, and the young\r\nDemetrius, pleaded earnestly for him, while the other generals all\r\nopposed them and pressed for his execution. It is said that Eumenes\r\nhimself inquired of his jailer, Onomarchus, what the reason was that\r\nAntigonus, having got his enemy into his power, did not put him to\r\ndeath quickly or else set him free honourably. When Onomarchus\r\ninsultingly answered that it was not then, but in the battle-field\r\nthat he ought to have shown how little he feared death, Eumenes\r\nretorted, \"I proved it there also; ask those whom I encountered; but I\r\nnever met a stronger man than myself.\" \"Since then you have now met\r\nwith a stronger man than yourself,\" said Onomarchus; \"why cannot you\r\npatiently await his pleasure?\"\r\n\r\nXIX. When, therefore, Antigonus made up his mind to put Eumenes to\r\ndeath, he ordered him to be kept without food. He lingered thus for\r\ntwo or three days; but as the camp was suddenly broken up, men were\r\nsent to despatch him. Antigonus restored his body to his friends, and\r\npermitted them to burn it and collect the ashes in a silver urn to be\r\ncarried to his wife and children. The death of Eumenes was quickly\r\navenged by Heaven, which stirred up Antigonus to regard the\r\nArgyraspids with abhorrence, as wicked and faithless villains. He\r\nplaced them under the command of Sibystius, the governor of Arachosia,\r\nand gave him orders to employ them, by small parties at a time, upon\r\nservices which would ensure their destruction, so that not one of them\r\nshould ever return to Macedonia, or behold the Grecian sea.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 170: Trebisond.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 171: Alexander.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: Plutarch tells us nothing of how Kleopatra came to\r\nSardis. See Thirlwall's 'History of Greece,' chap. lvii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 173: Thirlwall's 'History,' chap. lvii.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF SERTORIUS AND EUMENES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above are all the particulars of the lives of Eumenes and\r\nSertorius which have come down to us, and which appear worth\r\nrecording. When we come to compare them, we find that each was an\r\nexile from his native country, and commanded a numerous army of\r\nforeign troops, although Sertorius enjoyed the great advantage of an\r\nundisputed command, while Eumenes always had to contend with many\r\ncompetitors for the first place, which nevertheless he always obtained\r\nby his brilliant exploits. Sertorius was eagerly followed by men who\r\nwere proud to obey him, but Eumenes was only obeyed out of\r\nself-interest, by men who were incompetent to lead. The Roman ruled\r\nthe tribes of Lusitania and Iberia, who had been long before conquered\r\nby the Romans, while the Kardian led the Macedonians, when fresh from\r\nthe conquest of the world. Yet Sertorius was always looked up to as a\r\nwise man and a consummate captain, whereas Eumenes was despised as a\r\nmere quill-driver before he fought his way to the rank of general; so\r\nthat Eumenes not only started with less advantages, but met with much\r\ngreater difficulties, before he attained to distinction. Moreover,\r\nEumenes throughout his whole career was constantly opposed by open\r\nenemies, and constantly had to make head against secret plots and\r\nintrigues; whereas Sertorius was at first opposed by none of the\r\nofficers under his command, and at the very last only by a few. The\r\none had for his object merely to conquer his enemies, while the other,\r\nafter winning a victory, was obliged to defend himself against the\r\njealousy of his friends.\r\n\r\nII. Their military achievements are pretty equally balanced; although\r\nEumenes was naturally fond of war and tumults, while Sertorius was of\r\na quiet and peaceful disposition. Thus it happened that Eumenes,\r\nrather than dwell in comfortable and honourable retirement, passed his\r\nwhole life in war, because he could not be satisfied with anything\r\nshort of a throne; while Sertorius, who hated war, was forced to fight\r\nfor his own safety against foes who would not allow him to live in\r\npeace. Antigonus would have made use of Eumenes as an officer with\r\npleasure, if the latter would have laid aside his designs upon the\r\nthrone of Macedonia; but Pompeius and his party would not so much as\r\nallow Sertorius to live, although his only wish was to be at rest.\r\n\r\nFrom this it resulted that the one of his own free will went to war to\r\nobtain power, while the other was forced against his will to obtain\r\npower in order to repel attacks.\r\n\r\nThe one died by an unexpected stroke, while the other long looked for\r\ndeath, and at last even wished for it. In the first this shows a noble\r\nand generous spirit, not to distrust his friends; while the latter\r\nseems rather to argue weakness of purpose, for though Eumenes had long\r\nintended to fly, yet he did not, and was taken. The death of Sertorius\r\ndid not disgrace his life, for he met at the hands of his friends with\r\nthat fate which none of his enemies could inflict upon him; but\r\nEumenes, who could not escape before he was taken prisoner, and yet\r\nwas willing to live after his capture, made a discreditable end; for\r\nby his entreaties to be spared, he proved that his enemy had conquered\r\nnot merely his body but also his spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF AGESILAUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nArchidamus, the son of Zeuxidamus, king of Lacedæmon, after a glorious\r\nreign, left one son, Agis, by a noble lady named Lampito, and a much\r\nyounger one, named Agesilaus, by Eupolia, the daughter of\r\nMelesippides. As by the Spartan law Agis was the next heir, and\r\nsucceeded to the throne, Agesilaus was prepared for the life of a\r\nprivate man, in that severe Spartan school by which obedience is\r\ninstilled into the youth of that country. For that reason it is said\r\nthat the epithet of 'man-subduing' is applied to Sparta by the poet\r\nSimonides, because the Spartan customs render the citizens well\r\nbehaved, and amenable to discipline, like horses who are broken to\r\nharness early in life. The direct heirs to the throne are not\r\nsubjected to this training; but in the case of Agesilaus it happened\r\nthat when he began to rule he had previously been taught to obey. This\r\nrendered him by far the most popular of the kings of Sparta, because,\r\nin addition to the haughty spirit that became a king, he had learned\r\nto sympathize with the people over whom he ruled.\r\n\r\nII. Agesilaus was an early and intimate friend of Lysander, as they\r\nwere both placed as boys in the same herd or troop for the purposes of\r\ndiscipline. It was then that Lysander learned to admire the moderation\r\nand self-restraint of Agesilaus, who, although he was ambitious and\r\nhigh-spirited, with a most vehement and passionate desire to be first\r\nin every kind of competition, was yet of a manageable and easily ruled\r\ndisposition, very sensitive to reproach, and far more afraid of blame\r\nthan of toils or dangers. The misfortune of his lame leg was almost\r\nunnoticed, partly from the robust vigour of his frame, and also from\r\nhis own cheerful acknowledgment of this defect, being always the first\r\nto joke about it. He sought by these means to remedy his lameness,\r\nwhile his daring spirit never allowed it to prevent his undertaking\r\nthe most dangerous and laborious adventures. We have no record of his\r\nappearance, for he himself never would consent to have his portrait\r\ntaken, and even when dying begged that no statue or painting of him\r\nshould be taken. We are, however, told that he was of small and mean\r\nstature, but that his lively and cheerful temper, even in the most\r\ntrying situations, and the absence of anything harsh and overbearing\r\nin his manners, made him more popular than many younger and handsomer\r\nmen even in extreme old age. The historian Theophrastus informs us\r\nthat the mother of Agesilaus was a very small woman, and that the\r\nEphors had fined Archidamus, on that special ground, for marrying her.\r\n\"She will not bring forth kings to rule us,\" said they, \"but\r\nkinglets.\"\r\n\r\nIII. During the reign of Agis, Alkibiades arrived in Lacedæmon as an\r\nexile, having made his escape from the army in Sicily, and, after a\r\nshort sojourn, was universally believed to be carrying on an intrigue\r\nwith the king's wife, Timaea, insomuch that Agis refused to recognize\r\nher child as his own, but declared that Alkibiades was its father. The\r\nhistorian Douris tells us that Timaea was not altogether displeased at\r\nthis imputation, and that when nursing the child among her attendants\r\nshe was wont to call it Alkibiades instead of Leotychides. The same\r\nauthority states that Alkibiades himself declared that he seduced\r\nTimaea, not out of wantonness, but with the ambitious design of\r\nplacing his own family upon the throne of Sparta. In consequence of\r\nthis, Alkibiades, fearing the wrath of Agis, left Sparta, and the\r\nchild was always viewed with suspicion by Agis, and never treated as\r\nhis own son, until in his last illness the boy by tears and entreaties\r\nprevailed upon him to bear public witness to his legitimacy. But after\r\nthe death of Agis, Lysander, the conqueror of Athens, who was the most\r\nimportant man in Sparta, began to urge the claims of Agesilaus to the\r\nthrone, on the ground that Leotychides was a bastard, and therefore\r\nexcluded from the succession. Many of the other citizens eagerly\r\nespoused the cause of Agesilaus, because they had been brought up in\r\nhis company, and had become his intimate friends. There was, however,\r\none Diopeithes, a soothsayer, who was learned in prophetic lore, and\r\nenjoyed a great reputation for wisdom and sanctity. This man declared\r\nthat it was wrong for a lame man to become king of Lacedæmon, and\r\nquoted the following oracle:--\r\n\r\n    \"Proud Sparta, resting on two equal feet,\r\n    Beware lest lameness on thy kings alight;\r\n    Lest wars unnumbered toss thee to and fro,\r\n    And thou thyself be ruined in the fight.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to this, Lysander argued that the oracle really warned the\r\nSpartans against making Leotychides king; for the god was not likely\r\nto allude to actual lameness, which might not even be congenital, but\r\nmight arise from some accidental hurt, as disqualifying any one for\r\nthe office of king, but rather meant by a \"lame reign,\" the reign of\r\none who was not legitimate, and not truly descended from Herakles.\r\nAgesilaus also said that Poseidon bore witness to the illegitimacy of\r\nLeotychides; for Agis was said to have been cast out of his\r\nbed-chamber by an earthquake, after which he abstained from\r\napproaching his wife, on religious grounds, for a period of more than\r\nten months, at the end of which Leotychides was born.\r\n\r\nIV. Having been raised to the throne on those grounds, Agesilaus at\r\nthe same time acquired the large property left by the late king Agis,\r\nas Leotychides was declared illegitimate and driven into exile. As his\r\nown mother's family were respectable, but very poor, he distributed\r\nhalf this property among them, thus making sure of their good will and\r\nfavour, and removing any jealousy which they might feel at his\r\nelevation. Moreover, as Xenophon tells us, he gained the greatest\r\ninfluence by always deferring to the wishes of his country, and thus\r\nwas really enabled to act exactly as he pleased. The whole power of\r\nthe state was at that time vested in the Ephors and the Senate of\r\nElders, of whom the Ephors are elected every year, while the Elders\r\nsit for life. These two bodies were intended as a check upon the power\r\nof the kings, who would otherwise have been absolute, as has been\r\nexplained in the Life of Lykurgus. Between these magistrates and the\r\nkings there was generally a bad understanding; but Agesilaus adopted\r\nan opposite line of conduct. He never attempted to oppose or thwart\r\nthe Ephors or the Senate, and even showed a marked deference to them,\r\nreferring the initiative of all state affairs to them, hurrying into\r\ntheir presence when summoned, and rising from his royal throne\r\nwhenever they appeared, while he presented each senator, on his\r\nelection, with a cloak and an ox, to congratulate him on joining the\r\nSenate. Thus he appeared to exalt the power of the Ephors and to court\r\ntheir favour, but he himself was by far the greatest gainer, as his\r\nown personal influence was greatly increased, and the power of the\r\ncrown much strengthened by the general good will which he inspired.\r\n\r\nV. In his dealings with his fellow-citizens he is more to be praised\r\nas an enemy than as a friend; for he would not act unjustly to injure\r\nhis enemies, but he sometimes disregarded justice in the interests of\r\nhis friends. He was of too generous a nature to refrain from\r\napplauding even his enemies when they deserved it, but could not bear\r\nto reproach his friends for their faults, which he delighted to share\r\nwith them, and to extricate them from the consequences, for he thought\r\nnothing disgraceful if done to serve a friend.[174] He was also ever\r\nready to forgive and assist those with whom he had been at variance,\r\nand thus won all hearts, and attained to a true popularity. The Ephors\r\nindeed, perceiving this, imposed a fine upon him, alleging as a reason\r\nfor it that he was attaching the Spartans to his own person instead of\r\nto the State. For just as physical philosophers tell us that if the\r\nprinciple of strife and opposition were removed, the heavenly bodies\r\nwould stand still, and all the productive power of nature would be at\r\nan end, so did the Laconian lawgiver endeavour to quicken the virtue\r\nof his citizens by constructing a constitution out of opposing\r\nelements, deeming that success is barren when there is none to resist,\r\nand that the harmonious working of a political system is valueless if\r\npurchased by the suppression of any important element. Some have\r\nthought that the germ of this idea can be traced in Homer,[175] for he\r\nwould not have represented Agamemnon as rejoicing when Achilles and\r\nOdysseus quarrel 'with savage words,' had he not thought that some\r\ngreat public benefit would arise from this opposition and rivalry of\r\nthe bravest. But to this one cannot altogether agree; for party\r\nstrife, if carried to excess, proves most dangerous and ruinous to all\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nVI. Shortly after Agesilaus had been raised to the throne he received\r\nnews from Asia that the Persian king was preparing a large army with\r\nwhich he intended to drive the Lacedæmonians into the sea. Upon\r\nhearing this, Lysander was very eager to be sent out again to conduct\r\naffairs in Asia, in order that he might be able to assist his own\r\nfriends and partizans, whom he had appointed as governors to many of\r\nthe cities in that country, but who had mostly been forcibly expelled\r\nby the citizens for their insolent and tyrannical conduct. He\r\ntherefore urged Agesilaus to undertake a campaign in Asia as the\r\nchampion of Greece, and advised him to land upon some distant part of\r\nthe coast, so as to establish himself securely before the arrival of\r\nthe Persian army. At the same time he despatched instructions to his\r\nfriends in Asia, to send to Lacedæmon, and demand Agesilaus as their\r\ngeneral. In a public debate upon the subject, Agesilaus agreed to\r\nconduct the war if he were furnished with thirty Spartans to act as\r\ngenerals, and to form a council of war. He also demanded a force of\r\nten thousand picked men of the Neodamodes, or enfranchised Helots, and\r\nsix thousand hoplites, or heavy armed troops, from the allied cities\r\nin Greece. By the active co-operation of Lysander all this was quickly\r\nagreed upon, and Agesilaus was sent out with a council of thirty\r\nSpartans, in which Lysander at once took the lead, not merely by his\r\nown great name and influence, but by reason of his intimacy with\r\nAgesilaus, through which it was supposed that this campaign would\r\nraise him to more than kingly power. While the army was being\r\nassembled at Geræstus, Agesilaus himself proceeded to Aulis with his\r\nfriends, and while sleeping there, he appeared in a dream to hear a\r\nvoice saying: \"O king of the Lacedæmonians, since no one has ever been\r\ncommander-in-chief of all the Greeks, save you and Agamemnon alone, it\r\nis fitting that you, since you command the same troops, start from the\r\nsame place, and are about to attack the same enemy, should offer\r\nsacrifice to the same goddess to whom he sacrificed here before\r\nsetting out.\" Upon this there, at once, occurred to the mind of\r\nAgesilaus the legend of the maiden who was put to death on that\r\noccasion by her own father, in obedience to the soothsayers; but he\r\ndid not allow himself to be disturbed by this omen, but arose and told\r\nthe whole dream to his friends, observing that it was his intention to\r\npay all due honour to the goddess Artemis, but not to imitate the\r\nbarbarous conduct of Agamemnon. He now proceeded to hang garlands upon\r\na hind, and ordered his own soothsayer to offer it as a sacrifice,\r\ndisregarding the claims of the local Bœotian priest to do so. The\r\nBœotarchs, however, heard of this, and were greatly incensed at what\r\nthey considered an insult. They at once despatched a body of armed men\r\nto the spot, who forbade Agesilaus to offer sacrifice there, contrary\r\nto the ancestral customs of the Bœotians, and cast off the victim from\r\nthe altar where it lay. After this Agesilaus sailed away in great\r\ntrouble of mind, both from the anger he felt towards the Thebans, and\r\nfrom the evil omen which had befallen him, as he feared that it\r\nportended the failure of his Asiatic campaign.\r\n\r\nVII. On his arrival at Ephesus, he was much offended by the great\r\npower and influence possessed by Lysander, whose ante-chamber was\r\nalways crowded, and who was always surrounded by persons desirous of\r\npaying their court to him. They evidently thought that although\r\nAgesilaus might be nominally in command of the expedition, yet that\r\nall real power and direction of affairs was enjoyed by Lysander, who\r\nhad made himself feared and respected throughout Asia, beyond any\r\nother Greek commander, and had been able to benefit his friends and\r\ncrush his enemies more effectually than any one had previously done.\r\nAs all this was still fresh in the memory of all men, and especially\r\nas they perceived the extreme simplicity and courteousness of\r\nAgesilaus's manners and conversation, and observed, too, that Lysander\r\nwas still as harsh, rude, and imperious as before, they all looked up\r\nto him alone as the virtual commander.\r\n\r\nThe other Spartan members of the council were deeply dissatisfied at\r\nfinding that Lysander treated them rather as though he were king and\r\nthey were merely there to ratify his decrees, than as their colleague\r\nwith powers no more extensive than their own; while Agesilaus himself,\r\nwho though he was above feeling any jealousy of the honours paid to\r\nLysander, yet was ambitious and covetous of honour, began to fear that\r\nif any brilliant success should be achieved, the credit of it would be\r\ngiven to Lysander alone. He therefore proceeded to oppose all\r\nLysander's plans, and if he knew that Lysander was interested in any\r\nenterprise, he took care to put it off and neglect it, while he\r\nsuccessively rejected the petitions of every person in whom he knew\r\nLysander to take an interest. In judicial decisions also he invariably\r\nacquitted those whom Lysander wished to punish, and condemned to pay\r\nheavy fines those whom he endeavoured to serve. As this took place so\r\nfrequently that it could not be attributed to chance, but to a\r\nsystematic purpose, Lysander was forced to warn his partizans that his\r\nintervention was an injury and not a benefit to them, and that they\r\nmust desist from their obsequious attentions to him, and address\r\nthemselves directly to the king.\r\n\r\nVIII. As these remarks seemed intended to place the king's policy in\r\nan invidious light, Agesilaus determined to humble him still further,\r\nand appointed him his carver. He then said aloud in the hearing of\r\nmany persons, \"Let them now go and pay their court to my carver.\"\r\nVexed at this insult, Lysander remonstrated with him, saying, \"Truly,\r\nAgesilaus, you know how to degrade your friends.\" \"Ay, to be sure,\"\r\nanswered he, \"those among them who want to appear greater than I\r\nam.\"[176] \"Perhaps,\" replied Lysander, \"you have spoken the truth, and\r\nI have not acted rightly. Bestow on me, however, some post in which I\r\nmay be usefully employed without wounding your feelings.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this, Lysander was despatched on a mission to the Hellespont,\r\nwhere he found means to gain over a Persian noble named Spithridates,\r\nwho had received some offence from Pharnabazus, the satrap of that\r\nprovince. Lysander induced this man to join Agesilaus with all his\r\nproperty, and with a regiment of two hundred horse; yet he himself did\r\nnot forget his quarrel, and for the rest of his life assiduously\r\nplotted to remove the succession to the throne of Sparta from the two\r\nroyal families, and to throw it open to all Spartans alike. It is\r\nindeed probable that he would have raised an important commotion in\r\nSparta, had he not been slain in an expedition in Bœotia. Thus do\r\nambitious men do more harm than good in a state, unless they have an\r\nunusual power of self-restraint. Lysander no doubt acted very\r\noffensively, and made a very unreasonable display of his pride; yet\r\nAgesilaus might have discovered some better method of correcting the\r\nfaults of so great a man. Indeed, in my opinion they were both equally\r\nblinded by the same passion for personal aggrandizement, so that the\r\none forgot the power of his prince, and the other could not bear with\r\nthe shortcomings of his friend.\r\n\r\nIX. Tissaphernes was at first afraid of Agesilaus, and began to treat\r\nwith him about setting free the Greek cities on the Ionian coast from\r\nthe power of the king of Persia. Afterwards, however, he imagined that\r\nthe force at his disposal justified him in breaking off these\r\nnegotiations, and he declared war, to the great delight of Agesilaus.\r\nGreat expectations had indeed been formed in Greece of the army of\r\nAgesilaus, and it was thought a strange thing that ten thousand Greeks\r\nunder Xenophon should march through Persia to the sea, and defeat the\r\nking of Persia's troops as often as they pleased, while Agesilaus, the\r\ncommander of the Lacedæmonians, the leading people in Greece, who were\r\nall-powerful both by sea and land, should accomplish nothing. He now\r\nrevenged himself on the faithless Tissaphernes for his perjury by an\r\nequal piece of deceit, and gave out that he was about to march into\r\nKaria. When, however, the Persian army was assembled there, he\r\nproceeded north-wards to Phrygia, where he took many cities, and\r\ngained much plunder, pointing out to his friends that although to\r\nsolemnly plight one's word and then to break it is wrong, yet that to\r\nout-manœuvre one's enemies is not only lawful, but profitable and\r\nglorious. Being, however, deficient in cavalry, and warned by the omen\r\nof a victim being found with an imperfect liver, he retired to\r\nEphesus, and there collected a cavalry force, giving rich men the\r\nalternative of either serving themselves in his army, or of furnishing\r\na horse soldier instead. Many preferred to do so, and Agesilaus soon\r\npossessed a force of warlike cavalry in the place of worthless foot\r\nsoldiers; for those who did not wish to serve personally hired men who\r\nwere willing to fight, and those who could not ride hired those who\r\ncould. Just so did Agamemnon act very wisely in receiving a valuable\r\nmare, and thereby allowing a rich man to purchase his discharge from\r\nmilitary service. Agesilaus now gave orders that the heralds who\r\nconducted the sale of captives by auction, should strip them of their\r\nclothes, and put them up for sale in a state of perfect nudity. Their\r\nclothes were sold separately, and the Greek soldiers laughed heartily\r\nat the white and soft skins, which never had felt the sun or wind,\r\ndisplayed by these Asiatics, and began to feel contempt for such\r\neffeminate adversaries. Agesilaus himself, pointing first to the\r\ncaptives themselves, and then to their clothes and other property,\r\nobserved, \"These are the men with whom you have to fight, and these\r\nare the things you fight for.\"\r\n\r\nX. When the season for active operations returned he announced his\r\nintention of marching into Lydia, not meaning thereby to deceive\r\nTissaphernes; but Tissaphernes deceived himself, for he distrusted\r\nAgesilaus on account of his former stratagem. He therefore concluded\r\nthat it was Agesilaus's real intention to invade Karia, especially as\r\nhe was weak in cavalry, which could not act in that province. When,\r\nhowever, Agesilaus, as he had announced, marched into the level\r\ncountry near Sardis, Tissaphernes was obliged to hurry thither with\r\nall speed; and by means of his cavalry he cut off many stragglers from\r\nthe Greek army. Agesilaus now perceived that the enemy's infantry had\r\nnot come up, while he had all his troops in hand. He at once\r\ndetermined to fight, and having formed his cavalry and light-armed\r\ntroops into one mixed body he ordered them to advance at once and\r\nattack the enemy, while he led on the heavy infantry in person. The\r\nPersians were routed, and the Greeks, following up their victory, took\r\nthe enemy's camp with great slaughter. This victory not only enabled\r\nthem to plunder the king's territories undisturbed, but also gave them\r\nthe satisfaction of hearing that Tissaphernes, a bad man, and one for\r\nwhom all the Greeks felt an especial hatred, had at length met with\r\nhis deserts. Immediately after the battle the king of Persia sent\r\nTithraustes to him, who caused him to be beheaded. Tithraustes now\r\nbegged Agesilaus to make peace and leave the country, and offered him\r\nmoney if he would do so. Agesilaus answered that he had no power to\r\nmake peace or war, but that such propositions must be referred to the\r\nauthorities at home; while as to money he said that he preferred\r\nenriching his soldiers to enriching himself, and that among the Greeks\r\nit was not considered honourable to receive bribes, but rather to take\r\nplunder from their enemies. Nevertheless, wishing to oblige\r\nTithraustes, because he had avenged Greece upon that common enemy of\r\nall, Tissaphernes, he removed his army into Phrygia, receiving a sum\r\nof thirty talents from Tithraustes for the maintenance of his\r\nsoldiery.\r\n\r\nDuring his march he received a despatch from the government of Sparta,\r\nappointing him to the command of the naval as well as of the military\r\nforces in Asia. He was now at the zenith of his fame and the greatest\r\nman of his age, as Theopompus truly observes; yet he had more reason\r\nto be proud of his virtue than of his power. He was thought, however,\r\nto have committed an error in placing Peisander in command of the\r\nfleet, disregarding the claims of older and more experienced men, and\r\npreferring the advancement of his wife's brother to the interests of\r\nhis country.\r\n\r\nXI. Having established his army in the province ruled by Pharnabazus,\r\nhe not only found abundance of provisions, but also was able to amass\r\nmuch booty. He marched as far as the borders of Paphlagonia, and\r\ngained the alliance of Kotys,[177] the king of that country.\r\n\r\nSpithridatos, ever since he had revolted from Pharnabazus, had\r\nconstantly accompanied Agesilaus, together with his very handsome son,\r\nnamed Megabates, of whom Agesilaus was greatly enamoured, and a fair\r\ndaughter. Agesilaus persuaded King Kotys to marry this girl, and\r\nreceived from him a force of one thousand horsemen, and two thousand\r\nlight troops, called peltasts. With these he returned into Phrygia,\r\nand laid waste the country of Pharnabazus, who dared not meet him in\r\nthe field, and feared to trust himself in any of his fortresses, but\r\nhovered about the country, taking his valuable property with him, and\r\nkeeping his place of encampment as secret as he could. The watchful\r\nSpithridates, however, at last found an opportunity to attack him,\r\nand, with Herippidas the Spartan, took his camp and all his property.\r\nOn this occasion Herippidas acted with great harshness in ordering all\r\nthe plunder to be given up to be sold by auction, according to Greek\r\nusage. He forced the barbarian allies to disgorge their booty, and\r\nsearched for all that had been captured in so offensive a manner that\r\nSpithridates, in disgust at his conduct, at once went off to Sardis,\r\ntaking with him the entire Paphlagonian force.\r\n\r\nWe are told that Agesilaus was terribly chagrined at this. He felt\r\nvexed at losing a good friend in Spithridates, and losing, too, a\r\nlarge force with him, while he was ashamed of the character for\r\nmeanness and avarice which this miserable squabble would gain for\r\nSparta, especially as he had always prided himself on showing a\r\ncontempt for money both in politics and in private life.\r\n\r\nXII. After this, Pharnabazus was desirous of conferring with him, and\r\na meeting was arranged between them by a friend of both, Apollophanes\r\nof Kyzikus. Agesilaus arrived first, and sitting down upon some thick\r\ngrass under the shade of a tree, awaited the coming of Pharnabazus.\r\nPresently Pharnabazus arrived, with soft rugs and curiously-wrought\r\ncarpets, but on seeing Agesilaus simply seated on the ground, he felt\r\nashamed to use them, and sat down on the ground beside him, although\r\nhe was dressed in a magnificent robe of many colours. They now greeted\r\none another, and Pharnabazus stated his case very fairly, pointing out\r\nthat he had done much good service to the Lacedæmonians during their\r\nwar with Athens, and yet that his province was now being laid waste by\r\nthem. Seeing all the Spartans round him hanging down their heads with\r\nshame, and not knowing what to answer because they knew that what\r\nPharnabazus said was true, Agesilaus said: \"We Spartans, Pharnabazus,\r\nwere formerly at peace with your king, and then we respected his\r\nterritory as that of a friend. Now we are at war with him, and regard\r\nall his property as that of an enemy. Now as we see that you still\r\nwish to belong to the king, we very naturally endeavour by injuring\r\nyou to injure him. But from the day on which you shall declare that\r\nyou will be a friend and ally of the Greeks rather than a slave of the\r\nking of Persia, you may regard this fleet and army and all of us, as\r\nthe guardians of your property, of your liberty, and of all that makes\r\nlife honourable and enjoyable.\" In answer to this, Pharnabazus said:\r\n\"If the king shall send any other general, and put me under him, I\r\nwill join you. But if he places me in command, I will cheerfully obey\r\nhim, and will fight you and do you all the mischief in my power.\"\r\n\r\nAgesilaus was struck by the high-minded tone of this reply, and at\r\nonce rose and took him by the hand, saying, \"Would to God,\r\nPharnabazus, that such a man as you might become our friend rather\r\nthan our enemy.\"\r\n\r\nXIII. As Pharnabazus was retiring with his friends, his son stayed\r\nbehind, and running up to Agesilaus said with a smile, \"Agesilaus, I\r\nmake you my guest,\"[178] and gave him a fine javelin which he carried\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\nAgesilaus gladly accepted this offer, and, delighted with the engaging\r\nmanners and evident friendship of the young man, looked round for some\r\nsuitable present, and seeing that the horse of his secretary Idæus was\r\nadorned with fine trappings, took them off and gave them to the boy.\r\nAgesilaus never forgot the connection thus formed between them, but in\r\nafter days, when the son of Pharnabazus was impoverished and driven\r\ninto exile by his brother, he welcomed him to the Peloponnese, and\r\nprovided him with protection and a home. He even went so far as to\r\nemploy his influence in favour of an Athenian youth to whom the son of\r\nPharnabazus was attached. This boy had outgrown the age and size of\r\nthe boy-runners in the Olympic stadium, and was consequently refused\r\nleave to compete in that race. Upon this the Persian made a special\r\napplication to Agesilaus on his behalf; and Agesilaus, willing to do\r\nanything to please his protégé, with great difficulty and management\r\ninduced the judges to admit the boy as a competitor. This, indeed, was\r\nthe character of Agesilaus, disinterested and just in all matters\r\nexcept in furthering the interests of his friends, in which case he\r\nseems to have hesitated at nothing. A letter of his to Idrilus, the\r\nKarian, runs as follows: \"If Nikias be innocent, acquit him; if he be\r\nguilty, acquit him for my sake; but in any case acquit him.\" Such was\r\nAgesilaus in most cases where his friends were concerned; although in\r\nsome few instances he allowed expediency to prevail over affection,\r\nand sacrificed his personal friend to the general advantage, as, for\r\nexample, once, when owing to a sudden alarm the camp was being\r\nhurriedly broken up, he left a sick friend behind in spite of his\r\npassionate entreaties, observing as he did so, that it is hard to be\r\nwise and compassionate at the same time. This anecdote has been\r\npreserved by the philosopher Hieronymus.\r\n\r\nXIV. Agesilaus was now in the second year of his command in Asia, and\r\nhad become one of the foremost men of his time, being greatly admired\r\nand esteemed for his remarkable sobriety and frugality of life. When\r\naway from his headquarters he used to pitch his tent within the\r\nprecincts of the most sacred temples, thus making the gods witnesses\r\nof the most private details of his life. Among thousands of soldiers,\r\nmoreover, there was scarcely one that used a worse mattress than\r\nAgesilaus. With regard to extremes of heat and cold, he seemed so\r\nconstituted as to be able to enjoy whatever weather the gods might\r\nsend. It was a pleasant and enjoyable spectacle for the Greek\r\ninhabitants of Asia to see their former tyrants, the deputy governors\r\nof cities and generals of provinces, who used to be so offensively\r\nproud, insolent, and profusely luxurious, now trembling before a man\r\nwho walked about in a plain cloak, and altering their whole conduct in\r\nobedience to his curt Laconian sayings. Many used to quote the proverb\r\nof Timotheus, that \"Ares alone is king, and Hellas fears not the power\r\nof gold.\"\r\n\r\nXV. The whole of Asia Minor was now excited, and ripe for revolt.\r\nAgesilaus established order[179] in the cities on the coast by mild\r\nmeasures, without either banishing or putting to death any of the\r\ncitizens, and next determined to advance farther, and transfer the\r\ntheatre of war from the Ionic coast to the interior. He hoped thus to\r\nforce the Persian king to fight for his very existence, and for his\r\npleasant palaces at Susa and Ecbatana, and at any rate to keep him\r\nfully employed, so that from henceforth he might have no leisure or\r\nmeans to act as arbitrator between the Greek states in their disputes,\r\nand to corrupt their statesmen by bribes. At this crisis, however,\r\nthere arrived the Spartan Epikydides. He announced that Sparta was\r\ninvolved in an important war with Thebes and other Greek states, and\r\nbrought an imperative summons from the ephors to Agesilaus to return\r\nat once and assist his countrymen at home.\r\n\r\n    \"O Greeks, that will upon yourselves impose\r\n    Such miserable, more than Persian woes.\"\r\n\r\nIt is pitiable to think of the malevolence and ill-will which produced\r\nthis war, and arrayed the states of Greece against one another,\r\nputting a stop to such a glorious career of conquest at its very\r\noutset, exchanging a foreign for a civil war, and recalling the arms\r\nwhich were being used against the Persians to point them at Grecian\r\nbreasts. I cannot agree with the Corinthian, Demaratus, when he says\r\nthat those Greeks who did not see Alexander seated upon the throne of\r\nDarius lost one of the most delightful spectacles in the world. I\r\nthink they would have been more likely to weep when they reflected\r\nthat this conquest was left for Alexander and the Macedonians to\r\neffect, by those Greek generals who wasted the resources of their\r\ncountry in the battles of Leuktra and Koronea, Corinth and Mantinea.\r\nStill, nothing is more honourable to Agesilaus than the promptitude\r\nwith which he withdrew from Asia, nor can we easily find another\r\nexample of straightforward obedience and self-sacrifice in a general.\r\nHannibal was in great difficulties and straits in Italy, and yet\r\nyielded a very unwilling obedience when summoned home to protect\r\nCarthage, while Alexander merely sneered at the news of the battle\r\nbetween Agis and Antipater, observing, \"It appears, my friends, that\r\nwhile we have been conquering Darius here, there has been a battle of\r\nmice in Arcadia.\"\r\n\r\nWell then does Sparta deserve to be congratulated on the love for her\r\nand the respect for her laws which Agesilaus showed on this occasion,\r\nwhen, as soon as the despatch reached him, he at once stopped his\r\nprosperous and victorious career, gave up his soaring hopes of\r\nconquest, and marched home, leaving his work unfinished, regretted\r\ngreatly by all his allies, and having signally confuted the saying of\r\nPhæax the son of Erasistratus, that the Lacedæmonians act best as a\r\nstate, and the Athenians as individuals. He proved himself indeed to\r\nbe a good king and a good general, but those who know him most\r\nintimately prized him more as a friend and companion than as either a\r\nking or a soldier.\r\n\r\nThe Persian gold coins bore the device of an archer: and Agesilaus as\r\nhe broke up his camp observed that he was being driven out of Asia by\r\nten thousand archers, meaning that so many of these coins had been\r\ndistributed among the statesmen of Athens and Thebes, to bribe them\r\ninto forcing those countries to go to war with Sparta.\r\n\r\nXVI. He now crossed the Hellespont and proceeded through Thrace. Here\r\nhe did not ask leave of any of the barbarian tribes to traverse their\r\ncountry, but merely inquired whether they would prefer him to treat\r\nthem as friends or as enemies during his passage. All the tribes\r\nreceived him in a friendly manner and escorted him through their land,\r\nexcept the Trallians,[180] to whom it is said that Xerxes himself gave\r\npresents, who demanded from Agesilaus a hundred talents of silver and\r\na hundred female slaves for his passage. He answered, \"Why did they\r\nnot come at once and take them;\" and immediately marched into their\r\ncountry, where he found them strongly posted, and routed them with\r\ngreat slaughter.\r\n\r\nHe made the same enquiry, about peace or war, of the King of\r\nMacedonia, and on receiving the answer that he would consider the\r\nquestion, \"Let him consider,\" said he, \"but let us march in the\r\nmeanwhile.\" Struck with admiration and fear at his daring, the king\r\nbade him pass through as a friend. On reaching the country of\r\nThessaly, he found the Thessalians in alliance with the enemies of\r\nSparta, and laid waste their lands. He sent however Xenokles and\r\nSkythes to Larissa, the chief town in Thessaly, to arrange terms of\r\npeace. These men were seized upon by the Thessalians and cast into\r\nprison, at which the army was greatly excited, thinking that Agesilaus\r\ncould do no less than besiege and take Larissa. He, on the other hand,\r\nsaid that he valued the lives of either of these two men more than all\r\nThessaly, and obtained their release by negotiation. This ought not to\r\nsurprise us in Agesilaus, for when he heard of the great battle at\r\nCorinth where so many distinguished men fell, and where though many of\r\nthe enemy perished the Spartan loss was very small, he showed no signs\r\nof exultation, but sighed heavily, and said, \"Alas for Greece, that\r\nshe should by her own fault have lost so many men, who if they were\r\nalive could conquer all the barbarians in the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe Thessalian tribe of the Pharsalians[181] now attacked his army,\r\nupon which he charged them with five hundred horse, and having routed\r\nthem erected a trophy near Mount Narthakius. Agesilaus took great\r\npride in this victory, because in it he had defeated the Thessalian\r\nhorsemen, supposed to be the best in Greece, with cavalry disciplined\r\nby himself in Asia.\r\n\r\nXVII. He was here met by Diphridas the Ephor, who brought him orders\r\nto invade Bœotia immediately. Although he had intended to make more\r\nextensive preparations, he thought it right at once to obey, and\r\ninformed his friends that the day for which they had marched all the\r\nway from Asia would soon be at hand. He also sent for a reinforcement\r\nof two moras[182] from the army at Corinth. The Lacedæmonium\r\ngovernment at home, also, wishing to do him honour, made proclamation\r\nthat whosoever would might enrol himself to serve the King. All\r\neagerly gave in their names, and from them the ephors selected fifty\r\nof the strongest, whom they sent to Agesilaus as a body-guard. He now\r\nmarched through Thermopylæ, crossed the friendly country of Phokis,\r\nand entered Bœotia near Chæronea. While encamped there, he observed\r\nthat the sun was eclipsed and became crescent-shaped, and at the same\r\ntime came the news of the defeat and death of Peisander in a great\r\nsea-fight off Knidus, against Pharnabazus and Konon the Athenian.\r\nAgesilaus was naturally grieved both at his brother-in-law's death and\r\nat the disaster which had befallen Sparta, but as he feared to damp\r\nthe courage of his soldiers on the eve of battle, he ordered the\r\nmessengers to spread the contrary intelligence, that the Spartans had\r\nbeen victorious in the sea-fight, and he himself appeared with a\r\ngarland on his head, offered sacrifice as though he had heard good\r\nnews, and distributed portions of the meat to his friends, as presents\r\nof congratulation.\r\n\r\nXVIII. Proceeding on his march through Bœotia he reached Koroneia,\r\nwhere he came into the presence of the enemy, and arrayed his forces\r\nfor battle, placing the men of Orchomenos[183] on the left wing, while\r\nhe led the right in person. In the army of the allies the Thebans\r\nformed the right, and the Argives the left wing. Xenophon informs us\r\nthat this battle was the most furiously contested one that ever was\r\nknown. He himself was an eye-witness of it, as he had served with\r\nAgesilaus during his Asiatic campaign, and had accompanied him on his\r\nreturn to Europe. The first shock was not very severe, as the Thebans\r\neasily overthrew the Orchomenians, while Agesilaus with equal ease\r\nrouted the Argives. When, however, each of these victorious bodies\r\nheard that their left was hard pressed and retiring, they at once\r\nceased from following up their success and halted where they stood.\r\nAgesilaus might now easily have won a partial victory, by allowing the\r\nThebans to pass back again through his own lines and attacking them as\r\nthey did so. Instead of this, his fierce spirit led him to form his\r\ntroops in close order and attack them front to front. The Thebans\r\nfought with no less courage, and a terrible battle raged all along the\r\nline, but most fiercely at the point where the chosen body-guard of\r\nfifty men fought round the Spartan king. The courage of these men\r\nsaved the life of Agesilaus, for they recklessly exposed themselves in\r\nhis defence, and by their exertions, although they could not prevent\r\nhis being severely wounded, yet by receiving on their bodies through\r\ntheir shields and armour many blows which were intended for him, they\r\nsucceeded in dragging him from where he had fallen among the enemy,\r\nand formed a bulwark around him, slaying many of the enemy, but with\r\ngreat loss to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Lacedæmonians, unable to force back the Thebans, were at length\r\ncompelled to open their ranks, and let them pass through, which at\r\nfirst they had scorned to do. They then assailed them on the flanks\r\nand rear as they passed. Yet they could not boast of having conquered\r\nthe Thebans, who drew off and rejoined their comrades on Mount\r\nHelikon, with the proud conviction that in the battle they at any rate\r\nhad not been defeated.\r\n\r\nXIX. Agesilaus, although suffering from many wounds, refused to go to\r\nhis tent before he had been carried on men's shoulders round the army,\r\nand had seen all the dead brought off the field of battle. He gave\r\norders that some Thebans who had taken refuge in a neighbouring temple\r\nshould be dismissed unharmed. This was the temple of Athena Itonia,\r\nand before it stands a trophy, erected by the Bœotians under Sparton,\r\nmany years before, in memory of a victory which they had won over the\r\nAthenians under Tolmides, who fell in that battle.\r\n\r\nNext morning Agesilaus, wishing to discover whether the Thebans would\r\nrenew the contest, ordered his soldiers to crown themselves with\r\ngarlands, and the flute-players to play martial music while a trophy\r\nwas erected in honour of the victory. When the enemy sent to ask for a\r\ntruce for the burial of their dead, he granted it, and having thus\r\nconfirmed his victory, caused himself to be carried to Delphi. Here\r\nthe Pythian games were being celebrated, and Agesilaus not only took\r\npart in the procession in honour of the god, but also dedicated to him\r\nthe tithe of the spoils of his Asiatic campaign, which amounted to one\r\nhundred talents.\r\n\r\nOn his return home, he was loved and admired by all his\r\nfellow-countrymen for his simple habits of life; for he did not, like\r\nso many generals, return quite a different man, corrupted by foreign\r\nmanners, and dissatisfied with those of his own country, but, just\r\nlike those who had never crossed the Eurotas, he loved and respected\r\nthe old Spartan fashions, and would not alter his dining at the public\r\ntable, his bath, his domestic life with his wife, his care of his\r\narms, or the furniture of his house, the doors of which we are told by\r\nXenophon, were so old that it was thought that they must be the\r\noriginal ones put up by Aristodemus. Xenophon also tells us that the\r\n_kanathrum_ of his daughter was not at all finer than that of other\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nA _kanathrum_ is a fantastic wooden car, shaped like a griffin or an\r\nantelope, in which children are carried in sacred processions.\r\nXenophon does not mention the name of Agesilaus's daughter, and\r\nDikæarchus is much grieved at this, observing that we do not know the\r\nname either of the daughter of Agesilaus or of the mother of\r\nEpameinondas; I, however, have discovered, by consulting Lacedæmonium\r\nrecords, that the wife of Agesilaus was named Kleora, and that she had\r\ntwo daughters, named Eupolia and Prolyta. His spear also may be seen\r\nat the present day in Sparta, and differs in no respect from that of\r\nany other Lacedæmonium.\r\n\r\nXX. Perceiving that many of his countrymen bred horses, and gave\r\nthemselves great airs in consequence, he induced his sister Kyniske to\r\nenter a four-horse chariot for the race at Olympia, to prove to them\r\nthat the winning of this prize depends not upon a man's courage, but\r\nupon his wealth, and the amount of money which he spends upon it. As\r\nXenophon the philosopher was still with him, he advised him to send\r\nfor his sons and educate them in Lacedæmon, that they might learn the\r\nmost important of all lessons, to command and to obey.\r\n\r\nLysander was now dead, but Agesilaus found still existing an important\r\nconspiracy against himself, which Lysander had set on foot when he\r\nreturned from Asia. Agesilaus now eagerly undertook to prove what\r\nLysander's true character had been; and having read amongst the papers\r\nof the deceased that speech which Kleon of Halikarnassus wrote for\r\nhim, treating of reforms and alterations of the constitution, which\r\nLysander meant some day to address to the people of Sparta, he wished\r\nto make it public. However, one of the senators, after reading the\r\nspeech, was alarmed at the plausible nature of the argument which it\r\ncontained, and advised Agesilaus not to dig Lysander out of his grave,\r\nbut rather to bury the speech with him. This advice caused Agesilaus\r\nto desist from his project. He never openly attacked his political\r\nenemies, but contrived to get them appointed generals and governors of\r\ncities. When they displayed their bad qualities in these posts and\r\nwere recalled to take their trial he used to come forward as their\r\nfriend and by his exertions on their behalf make them his active\r\npartisans instead of his enemies, so that before long he succeeded in\r\nbreaking up the party which was opposed to him, and reigned alone\r\nwithout any rival; for the other king, Agesipolis, whose father had\r\nbeen an exile, and who was himself very young, and of a mild and\r\nunassuming temper, counted for nothing in the state. Agesilaus won\r\nover this man also, and made a friend of him; for the two kings dine\r\nat the same _phiditium_, or public table, when they are at Sparta.\r\nKnowing Agesipolis, like himself, to be prone to form attachments to\r\nyoung men, he always led the conversation to this subject, and\r\nencouraged the young king in doing so; for these love affairs among\r\nLacedæmonians have in them nothing disgraceful, but produce much\r\nmodest emulation and desire for glory, as has been explained in the\r\nLife of Lykurgus.\r\n\r\nXXI. Being now the most powerful man in Sparta, Agesilaus obtained the\r\nappointment of admiral of the fleet for Teleutias, his half-brother;\r\nand thereupon making an expedition against Corinth, he made himself\r\nmaster of the long walls by land, through the assistance of his\r\nbrother at sea. Coming thus upon the Argives, who then held Corinth,\r\nin the midst of their Isthmian festival, he made them fly just as they\r\nhad finished the customary sacrifice, and leave all their festive\r\nprovision behind them. Upon this the Corinthian exiles[184] who were\r\nwith him begged him to preside over the games, but this he refused to\r\ndo, ordering them to celebrate the festival, while he took care that\r\nthey did so without interruption. After he was gone the Argives\r\nreturned, and celebrated the Isthmian games over again. Some of the\r\nwinners on the former occasion now won the prize again, while others\r\nwere defeated. Agesilaus observed that the Argives by this act\r\nconfessed themselves to be cowards, if they set so high a value on\r\npresiding at the games, and yet did not dare to fight for it. With\r\nregard to such matters he used to think that a middle course was best,\r\nand he always was present at the choruses and games at Sparta, taking\r\ngreat interest in their management, and not even neglecting the races\r\nfor boys and for girls; but of some other matters in which most men\r\nwere interested he seemed to be entirely ignorant. For instance\r\nKallipides, who was esteemed the finest tragic actor in Greece, once\r\nmet him and spoke to him, after which he swaggered along amongst his\r\ntrain, but finding that no notice was taken of him, he at length\r\nasked, \"Do you not know me, O king?\" Agesilaus at this looked\r\ncarefully at him, and enquired, \"Are you not Kallipides the player?\"\r\nfor so the Lacedæmonians name actors. Again, when he was invited to\r\nhear some one imitate the nightingale he answered, \"I have heard the\r\noriginal.\"\r\n\r\nMenekrates the physician, after having succeeded in curing some cases\r\nof sickness which were thought to be desperate, was given the title of\r\nZeus, and used to use this appellation on all occasions in a foolish\r\nmanner. He even went so far as to write to Agesilaus in the following\r\nterms, \"Menekrates Zeus wishes King Agesilaus health.\" To this he\r\nanswered, \"King Agesilaus wishes Menekrates more sense.\"\r\n\r\nXXII. While he was encamped in the temple of Hera, near Corinth,\r\nwatching the soldiers disposing of the captives which they had taken,\r\nambassadors came from Thebes to treat for peace with him. He always\r\nhad borne a grudge against that city, and thinking that this would be\r\na good opportunity to indulge his hatred, he pretended neither to see\r\nnor to hear them when they addressed him. But he soon paid the\r\npenalty of his insolence; for before the Thebans left him news was\r\nbrought that an entire mora had been cut to pieces by Iphikrates. This\r\nwas the greatest disaster which had befallen the Spartans for many\r\nyears; for they lost a large number of brave and well-equipped\r\ncitizens, all heavy-armed hoplites, and that too at the hands of mere\r\nmercenary light troops and peltasts. On hearing this Agesilaus at\r\nfirst leaped up to go to their assistance; but when he heard that they\r\nwere completely destroyed, he returned to the temple of Hera, and\r\nrecalling the Bœotian ambassadors, bade them deliver their message.\r\nBut they now in their turn assumed a haughty demeanour, and made no\r\nmention of peace, but merely demanded leave to proceed to Corinth. At\r\nthis, Agesilaus in a rage answered, \"If you wish to go there to see\r\nyour friends rejoicing over their success, you will be able to do so\r\nin safety to-morrow.\" On the next day he took the ambassadors with\r\nhim, and marched, laying waste the country as he went, up to the gates\r\nof Corinth, where, having thus proved that the Corinthians dared not\r\ncome out and resent his conduct, he sent the ambassadors into the\r\ncity. As for himself, he collected the survivors of the mora, and\r\nmarched back to Lacedæmon, always starting before daybreak, and\r\nencamping after sunset, that he might not be insulted by the\r\nArcadians, who bitterly hated the Lacedæmonians and enjoyed their\r\ndiscomfiture. After this at the instance of the Achæans he crossed\r\nover into Akarnania with them, where he obtained much plunder, and\r\ndefeated the Akarnanians in battle. The Achæans now begged him to\r\nremain, and so prevent the enemy from sowing their fields in the\r\nwinter; but he answered that he should do exactly the reverse,\r\nbecause, if the enemy next year had a good prospect of a harvest, they\r\nwould be much more inclined to keep the peace than if their fields lay\r\nfallow. And this opinion of his was justified by the result; for as\r\nsoon as the Akarnanians heard that another campaign was threatened,\r\nthey made peace with the Achæans.\r\n\r\nXXIII. Konon and Pharnabazus, after their victory in the sea-fight at\r\nKnidus, had obtained command of the seas and began to plunder the\r\ncoast of Laconia, while the Athenian walls likewise were restored,\r\nwith money supplied by Pharnabazus for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances disposed the Lacedæmonians to make peace with the\r\nking of Persia. They consequently sent Antalkidas to Tiribazus to\r\narrange terms, and most basely and wickedly gave up to the king those\r\nGreek cities in Asia on behalf of which Agesilaus had fought.\r\nAntalkidas, indeed, was his enemy, and his great reason for concluding\r\na peace on any terms was, that war was certain to increase the\r\nreputation and glory of Agesilaus. Yet when some one reproached\r\nAgesilaus, saying that the Lacedæmonians were Medising,[185] he\r\nanswered, \"Nay, say, rather, the Medes (Persians) are Laconising.\"\r\n\r\nBy threats of war he compelled those Greek states who were unwilling\r\nto do so to accept the terms of the peace, especially the Thebans; for\r\none of the articles of the peace was, that the Thebans should leave\r\nthe rest of Bœotia independent, by which of course they were greatly\r\nweakened. This was proved by subsequent events. When Phœbidas, in\r\ndefiance of law and decency, seized the Kadmeia, or citadel of Thebes,\r\nin time of peace, all Greeks cried shame on him, and the Spartans felt\r\nespecial annoyance at it. The enemies of Agesilaus now angrily\r\nenquired of Phœbidas who ordered him to do so, and as his answers\r\nhinted at Agesilaus as having suggested the deed, Agesilaus openly\r\ndeclared himself to be on Phœbidas's side, and said that the only\r\nthing to be considered was, whether it was advantageous to Sparta or\r\nnot; for it was always lawful to render good service to the state,\r\neven impromptu and without previous orders. Yet in his talk Agesilaus\r\nalways set a high value upon justice, calling it the first of all\r\nvirtues; for he argued that courage would be useless without justice;\r\nwhile if all men were just, there would be no need of courage. When he\r\nwas informed, \"The pleasure of the great king is so-and-so,\" he was\r\nwont to answer, \"How can he be greater than I, unless he be\r\njuster?\"--thus truly pointing out that justice is the real measure of\r\nthe greatness of kings. When the king of Persia sent him a letter\r\nduring the peace, offering to become his guest[186] and friend, he\r\nrefused to open it, saying that he was satisfied with the friendship\r\nexisting between the two states, and that while that lasted he\r\nrequired no private bond of union with the king of Persia. However, in\r\nhis actions he was far from carrying out these professions, but was\r\nfrequently led into unjust acts by his ambition. In this instance he\r\nnot only shielded Phœbidas from punishment for what he had done at\r\nThebes, but persuaded Sparta to adopt his crime as its own, and\r\ncontinue to hold the Kadmeia, appointing as the chiefs of the garrison\r\nArchias and Leontidas,[187] by whose means Phœbidas made his way into\r\nthe citadel.\r\n\r\nXXIV. This at once gave rise to a suspicion that Phœbidas was merely\r\nan agent, and that the whole plot originated with Agesilaus himself,\r\nand subsequent events confirmed this view; for as soon as the Thebans\r\ndrove out the garrison and set free their city, Agesilaus made war\r\nupon them to avenge the murder of Archias and Leontidas, who had been\r\nnominally polemarchs, but in reality despots of Thebes. At this period\r\nAgesipolis was dead, and his successor Kleombrotus was despatched into\r\nBœotia with an army; for Agesilaus excused himself from serving in\r\nthat campaign on the ground of age, as it was forty years since he had\r\nfirst borne arms, and he was consequently exempt by law. The real\r\nreason was that he was ashamed, having so lately been engaged in a war\r\nto restore the exiled popular party at Phlius, to be seen now\r\nattacking the Thebans in the cause of despotism.\r\n\r\nThere was a Lacedæmonium named Sphodrias, one of the faction opposed\r\nto Agesilaus, who was established as Spartan governor of the town of\r\nThespiæ, a daring and ambitious man, but hot-headed, and prone to act\r\nwithout due calculation. This man, who longed to achieve distinction,\r\nand who perceived that Phœbidas had made a name throughout Greece by\r\nhis exploit at Thebes, persuaded himself that it would be a much more\r\nglorious deed if he were to make himself master of the Peiræus, and so\r\nby a sudden attack cut off the Athenians from the sea. It is said that\r\nthis attempt originated with the Bœotarchs, Pelopidas and Mellon, who\r\nsent emissaries to Sphodrias to praise and flatter him, and point out\r\nthat he alone was capable of conducting so bold an adventure. By this\r\nlanguage, and an affectation of sympathy with Lacedæmon, these men at\r\nlength prevailed on him to attempt a most unrighteous deed, and one\r\nwhich required considerable boldness and good fortune to ensure its\r\nsuccess. Daylight, however, overtook Sphodrias before he had crossed\r\nthe Thriasian plain, near Eleusis. All hope of surprising Peiræus by a\r\nnight attack was now gone, and it is said, also, that the soldiers\r\nwere alarmed and terror-stricken by certain lights which gleamed from\r\nthe temples at Eleusis. Sphodrias himself, now that his enterprise had\r\nso manifestly failed, lost heart, and after hurriedly seizing some\r\nunimportant plunder, led his men back to Thespiæ. Upon this an embassy\r\nwas sent from Athens to Sparta to complain of the acts of Sphodrias;\r\nbut on the arrival of the ambassadors at Sparta they found that the\r\ngovernment there were in no need of encouragement from without to\r\nproceed against Sphodrias, for they had already summoned him home to\r\nbe tried for his life. Sphodrias durst not venture to return to\r\nSparta, for he saw that his fellow-countrymen were angry with him and\r\nashamed of his conduct towards the Athenians, and that they wished\r\nrather to be thought fellow-sufferers by his crime than accomplices in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nXXV. Sphodrias had a son, named Kleonymus, who was still quite a\r\nyouth, and who was beloved by Archidamus, the son of Agesilaus. He now\r\nassisted this youth, who was pleading his father's cause as best he\r\nmight, but he could not do so openly, because Sphodrias belonged to\r\nthe party which was opposed to Agesilaus. When, however, Kleonymus\r\ncame to him, and besought him with tears and piteous entreaties to\r\nappease Agesilaus, because the party of Sphodrias dreaded him more\r\nthan any one else, the young man, after two or three days' hesitation,\r\nat length, as the day fixed for the trial approached, mustered up\r\ncourage to speak to his father on the subject, telling him that\r\nKleonymus had begged him to intercede for his father.\r\n\r\nAgesilaus was well aware of his son's intimacy with Kleonymus, which\r\nhe had never discouraged; for Kleonymus promised to become as\r\ndistinguished a man as any in Sparta. He did not on this occasion,\r\nhowever, hold out to his son any hopes of a satisfactory termination\r\nof the affair, but said that he would consider what would be the most\r\nfitting and honourable course to pursue. After this reply, Archidamus\r\nhad not the heart to meet Kleonymus, although he had before been\r\naccustomed to see him several times daily. This conduct of his plunged\r\nthe friends of Sphodrias into yet deeper despair of his cause, until\r\nEtymokles, one of the friends of Agesilaus, in a conference with them,\r\nexplained that what Agesilaus really thought about the matter was,\r\nthat the action itself deserved the greatest censure; but yet that\r\nSphodrias was a brave energetic man, whom Sparta could not afford to\r\nlose.\r\n\r\nAgesilaus used this language out of a desire to gratify his son, and\r\nfrom it Kleonymus soon perceived that Archidamus had been true to him\r\nin using his interest with his father; while the friends of Sphodrias\r\nbecame much more forward in his defence. Indeed Agesilaus was\r\nremarkably fond of children, and an anecdote is related of him, that\r\nwhen his children were very little he was fond of playing with them,\r\nand would bestride a reed as if it were a horse for their amusement.\r\nWhen one of his friends found him at this sport, he bade him mention\r\nit to no one before he himself became the father of a family.\r\n\r\nXXVI. Sphodrias was acquitted by the court; and the Athenians, as soon\r\nas they learned this, prepared for war. Agesilaus was now greatly\r\nblamed, and was charged with having obstructed the course of justice,\r\nand having made Sparta responsible for an outrage upon a friendly\r\nGreek state, merely in order to gratify the childish caprice of his\r\nson. As he perceived that Kleombrotus was unwilling to attack the\r\nThebans, he himself invaded Bœotia, disregarding the law under which\r\non a former occasion he had pleaded exemption from military service on\r\naccount of his age. Here he fought the Thebans with varying success;\r\nfor once, when he was being borne out of action wounded, Antalkidas\r\nobserved to him, \"A fine return you are getting from the Thebans for\r\nhaving taught them how to fight against their will.\" Indeed, the\r\nmilitary power of the Thebans at that time was at its height, having\r\nas it were been exercised and practised by the many campaigns\r\nundertaken against them by the Lacedæmonians. This was why Lykurgus of\r\nold, in his three celebrated _rhetras_, forbade the Lacedæmonians to\r\nfight often with the same people, lest by constant practice they\r\nshould teach them how to fight. Agesilaus was also disliked by the\r\nallies of the Lacedæmonians, because of his hatred of Thebes and his\r\ndesire to destroy that state, not on any public grounds, but merely on\r\naccount of his own bitter personal dislike to the Thebans. The allies\r\ncomplained grievously that they, who composed the greater part of the\r\nLacedæmonium force, should every year be led hither and thither, and\r\nexposed to great risks and dangers, merely to satisfy one man's\r\npersonal pique. Hereupon we are told that Agesilaus, desiring to prove\r\nthat this argument about their composing so large a part of the army\r\nwas not founded on fact, made use of the following device:--He ordered\r\nall the allies to sit down in one body, and made the Lacedæmonians sit\r\ndown separately. Next he gave orders, first that all the potters\r\nshould stand up; and when they had risen, he ordered the smiths,\r\ncarpenters, masons, and all the other tradesmen successively to do so.\r\nWhen then nearly all the allies had risen to their feet, the Spartans\r\nall remained seated, for they were forbidden to learn or to practise\r\nany mechanical art. At this Agesilaus smiled, and said, \"You see, my\r\nmen, how many more soldiers we send out than you do.\"\r\n\r\nXXVII. On his return from his campaign against the Thebans, Agesilaus,\r\nwhile passing through Megara, was seized with violent pain in his\r\nsound leg, just as he was entering the town-hall in the Acropolis of\r\nthat city. After this it became greatly swelled and full of blood, and\r\nseemed to be dangerously inflamed. A Syracusan physician opened a vein\r\nnear the ankle, which relieved the pain, but the flow of blood was\r\nexcessive, and could not be checked, so that he fainted away from\r\nweakness, and was in a very dangerous condition. At length the\r\nbleeding stopped, and he was conveyed home to Lacedæmon, but he\r\nremained ill, and unable to serve in the wars for a long time.\r\n\r\nDuring his illness many disasters befel the Spartans both by land and\r\nby sea. Of these, the most important was the defeat at Tegyra, where\r\nfor the first time they were beaten in a fair fight by the Thebans.\r\nThe Lacedæmonians were now eager to make peace with all the Greek\r\ncities, and ambassadors from all parts of Greece met at Sparta to\r\narrange terms. Among them was Epameinondas, a man who was renowned for\r\nhis culture and learning, but who had not hitherto given any proof of\r\nhis great military genius. This man, perceiving that all the other\r\nambassadors were sedulously paying their court to Agesilaus, assumed\r\nan independent attitude, and in a speech delivered before the congress\r\ndeclared that nothing kept the war alive except the unjust pretensions\r\nof Sparta, who gained strength from the sufferings of the other\r\nstates, and that no peace could be durable unless such pretensions\r\nwere laid aside, and Sparta reduced to the equality with the rest of\r\nthe cities of Greece.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. Agesilaus, observing that all the representatives of the Greek\r\nstates were filled with admiration at this language, and manifested\r\nstrong sympathy with the speaker, enquired whether he thought it right\r\nand just that the cities of Bœotia[188] should be left independent.\r\n\r\nEpameinondas quickly and boldly enquired in answer, whether he\r\nthought it right to leave each of the towns in Laconia independent. At\r\nthis Agesilaus leaped to his feet in a rage, and asked him to state\r\nclearly whether he meant to leave Bœotia independent. As Epameinondas\r\nin reply merely repeated his question, as to whether Agesilaus meant\r\nto leave Laconia independent, Agesilaus became furious, eagerly seized\r\nthe opportunity to strike the name of Thebes out of the roll of cities\r\nwith whom peace was being made, and declared war against it. He\r\nratified a treaty of peace with the other Greek cities, and bade their\r\nrepresentatives begone, with the remark, that such of their disputes\r\nas admitted of settlement must be arranged by peaceful negotiation,\r\nand such as could not must be decided by war; but that it was too much\r\ntrouble for him to act as arbitrator between them in their manifold\r\nquarrels and disagreements.\r\n\r\nKleombrotus, the other Spartan king, was at this time in the Phokian\r\nterritory at the head of an army. The Ephors now at once sent orders\r\nto him to cross the Theban frontier, while they assembled a force from\r\nall the allied cities, who were most reluctant to serve, and objected\r\nstrongly to the war, yet dared not express their discontent or disobey\r\nthe Lacedæmonians. Many sinister omens were observed, which we have\r\nspoken of in the life of Epameinondas, and Prothous the Laconian\r\nopenly opposed the whole campaign; yet Agesilaus would not desist, but\r\nurged on the war against Thebes, imagining that now, when all the\r\nother states were standing aloof, and Thebes was entirely isolated, he\r\nhad a more favourable opportunity than might ever occur again for\r\ndestroying that city. The dates of this war seem to prove that it was\r\nbegun more out of ill-temper than as a consequent of any definite\r\nplan; for the peace was ratified in Lacedæmon with the other cities on\r\nthe fourteenth of the month Skirophorion; and on the fifth of the next\r\nmonth, Hekatombæon, only twenty days afterwards, the Spartans were\r\ndefeated at Leuktra. A thousand Lacedæmonians perished, among them\r\nKleombrotus the king, and with him the flower of the best families in\r\nSparta. There fell also the handsome son of Sphodrias, Kleonymus, who\r\nfought before the king, and was thrice struck to the ground and rose\r\nagain before he was slain by the Thebans.\r\n\r\nXXIX. In spite of the unparalleled disaster which had befallen the\r\nLacedæmonians, for the Theban victory was the most complete ever won\r\nby one Greek state over another, the courage of the vanquished is\r\nnevertheless as much to be admired as that of the victors. Xenophon\r\nremarks that the conversation of good and brave men, even when jesting\r\nor sitting at table, is always worth remembering, and it is much more\r\nvaluable to observe how nobly all really brave and worthy men bear\r\nthemselves when in sorrow and misfortune. When the news of the defeat\r\nat Leuktra arrived at Sparta, the city was celebrating the festival of\r\nthe Gymnopædia, and the chorus of grown men was going through its\r\nusual solemnity in the theatre. The Ephors, although the news clearly\r\nproved that all was lost and the state utterly ruined, yet would not\r\npermit the chorus to abridge its performance, and forbade the city to\r\nthrow off its festal appearance. They privately communicated the names\r\nof the slain to their relatives, but they themselves calmly continued\r\nto preside over the contest of the choruses in the theatre, and\r\nbrought the festival to a close as though nothing unusual had\r\noccurred. Next morning, when all men knew who had fallen and who had\r\nsurvived, one might see those whose relations had been slain, walking\r\nabout in public with bright and cheerful countenances: but of those\r\nwhose relatives survived, scarce one showed himself in public, but\r\nthey sat at home with the women, as if mourning for the dead; or if\r\nany one of them was forced to come forth, he looked mournful and\r\nhumbled, and walked with cast-down eyes. Yet more admirable was the\r\nconduct of the women, for one might see mothers receiving their sons\r\nwho had survived the battle with silence and sorrow, while those whose\r\nchildren had fallen proceeded to the temples to return thanks to the\r\ngods, and walked about the city with a proud and cheerful demeanour.\r\n\r\nXXX. Yet, when their allies deserted them, and when the victorious\r\nEpameinondas, excited by his success, was expected to invade\r\nPeloponnesus, many Spartans remembered the oracle about the lameness\r\nof Agesilaus, and were greatly disheartened and cast down, fearing\r\nthat they had incurred the anger of Heaven, and that the misfortunes\r\nof the city were due to their own conduct in having excluded the sound\r\nman from the throne, and chosen the lame one; the very thing which the\r\noracle had bidden them beware of doing. Nevertheless, Agesilaus was so\r\npowerful in the state, and so renowned for wisdom and courage, that\r\nthey gladly made use of him as their leader in the war, and also\r\nemployed him to settle a certain constitutional difficulty which arose\r\nabout the political rights of the survivors of the battle. They were\r\nunwilling to disfranchise all these men, who were so numerous and\r\npowerful, because they feared that if so they would raise a revolution\r\nin the city. For the usual rule at Sparta about those who survive a\r\ndefeat is, that they are incapable of holding any office in the state;\r\nnor will any one give them his daughter in marriage; but all who meet\r\nthem strike them, and treat them with contempt. They hang about the\r\ncity in a squalid and degraded condition, wearing a cloak patched with\r\npieces of a different colour, and they shave one half of their beards,\r\nand let the other half grow. Now, at the present crisis it was thought\r\nthat to reduce so many citizens to this condition, especially when the\r\nstate sorely required soldiers, would be an absurd proceeding; and\r\nconsequently, Agesilaus was appointed lawgiver, to decide upon what\r\nwas to be done. He neither altered the laws, nor proposed any new\r\nones, but laid down his office of lawgiver at once, with the remark,\r\nthat the laws must be allowed to sleep for that one day, and\r\nafterwards resume their force. By this means he both preserved the\r\nlaws, retained the services of the citizens for the state, and saved\r\nthem from infamy. With the intention of cheering up the young men, and\r\nenabling them to shake off their excessive despondency, he led an army\r\ninto Arcadia. He was careful to avoid a battle, but captured a small\r\nfort belonging to the people of Mantinea, and overran their territory;\r\nthus greatly raising the spirits of the Spartans, who began to pluck\r\nup courage, and regard their city as not altogether ruined.\r\n\r\nXXXI. After this, Epameinondas invaded Laconia with the army of the\r\nThebans and their allies, amounting in all to no less than forty\r\nthousand heavy-armed soldiers. Many light troops and marauders\r\naccompanied this body, so that the whole force which entered Laconia\r\namounted in all to seventy thousand men. This took place not less than\r\nsix hundred years after the Dorians had settled in Lacedæmon; and\r\nthrough all that time these were the first enemies which the country\r\nhad seen; for no one before this had dared to invade it. Now, however,\r\nthe Thebans ravaged the whole district with fire and sword, and no one\r\ncame out to resist them, for Agesilaus would not allow the\r\nLacedæmonians to fight against what Theopompus calls 'such a heady\r\ntorrent of war,' but contented himself with guarding the most\r\nimportant parts of the city itself, disregarding the boastful threats\r\nof the Thebans, who called upon him by name to come out and fight for\r\nhis country, since he was the cause of all its misfortunes, because he\r\nhad begun the war.\r\n\r\nAgesilaus was also distracted by the disorderly and excited state of\r\nthe city itself, for the old men were in an agony of grief,\r\nresentment, and wounded honour, while the women could not be kept\r\nquiet, but were wrought to frenzy, by hearing the cries of the enemy,\r\nand seeing the fires which they lighted. He also suffered much at the\r\nthought of his own dishonour; for when he had ascended the throne,\r\nSparta was the greatest and most powerful city in Greece, and now he\r\nbeheld her shorn of all her glories, and his favourite boast, that no\r\nLaconian woman had ever seen the smoke of an enemy's fire rendered\r\nsignally untrue. We are told that when some Athenian was disputing\r\nwith Antalkidas about the bravery of their respective nations, and\r\nsaying, \"We have often chased you away from the Kephissus,\" Antalkidas\r\nanswered, \"Yes, but we have never had to chase you away from the\r\nEurotas.\" This is like the answer made by some Spartan of less\r\ndistinction to an Argive, who said, \"Many of you Spartans lie buried\r\nin Argive soil,\" to which he replied, \"But none of you are buried in\r\nLaconia.\"\r\n\r\nXXXII. We are told at this time Antalkidas was one of the Ephors, and\r\nbecame so much alarmed that he sent his family away to the island of\r\nKythera. Agesilaus, when the enemy attempted to cross the river and\r\nforce their way into the city, abandoned most part of it, and drew up\r\nhis forces on the high hills in the centre. At that time the river\r\nEurotas was in high flood, as much snow had fallen, and the excessive\r\ncold of the water, as well as the strength of the stream, rendered it\r\nhard for the Thebans to cross. Epameinondas marched first, in the\r\nfront rank of the phalanx; and some of those who were present pointed\r\nhim out to Agesilaus, who is said to have gazed long at him, saying\r\nmerely, \"O thou man of great deeds.\"\r\n\r\nEpameinondas was eager to assault the city itself, and to place a\r\ntrophy of victory in its streets; but as he could not draw Agesilaus\r\ninto a battle, he drew off his forces, and again laid waste the\r\ncountry. Meanwhile, in Lacedæmon itself, a body of two hundred men, of\r\ndoubtful fidelity, seized the Issorium, where the temple of Artemis\r\nstands, which is a strong and easily defensible post. The\r\nLacedæmonians at once wished to attack them, but Agesilaus, fearing\r\nthat some deep-laid conspiracy might break out, ordered them to remain\r\nquiet. He himself, dressed simply in his cloak, unarmed, and attended\r\nonly by one slave, went up to the two hundred, and, in a loud voice,\r\ntold them that they had mistaken their orders; that they had not been\r\nordered to go thither, nor yet to go all together in a body, but that\r\nsome were to be posted _there_, pointing to some other place, and the\r\nrest elsewhere in the city. They, hearing his commands, were\r\ndelighted, imagining that their treason was undiscovered, and\r\nimmediately marched to the places which he indicated. Agesilaus at\r\nonce occupied the Issorium with troops which he could trust, and in\r\nthe ensuing night seized and put to death fifteen of the leaders of\r\nthe two hundred. Another more important conspiracy was betrayed to\r\nhim, whose members, full Spartan citizens, were met together in one\r\nhouse to arrange revolutionary schemes. At such a crisis it was\r\nequally impossible to bring these men to a regular trial, and to allow\r\nthem to carry on their intrigues. Agesilaus therefore, after taking\r\nthe Ephors into his confidence, put them all to death untried, though\r\nbefore that time no Spartan had ever been executed without a trial.\r\n\r\nAs many of the Periœki and helots who had been entrusted with arms\r\nescaped out of the city and deserted to the enemy, which greatly\r\ndisheartened the Spartans, he ordered his servants to visit the\r\nquarters of these soldiers at daybreak every morning, and wherever any\r\none was gone, to hide his arms, so that the number of deserters might\r\nnot be known.\r\n\r\nWe are told by some historians that the Thebans left Laconia because\r\nthe weather became stormy, and their Arcadian allies began to melt\r\naway from them. Others say that they spent three entire months in the\r\ncountry, and laid nearly all of it waste. Theopompus relates that when\r\nthe Bœotarchs had decided to leave the country, Phrixus, a Spartan,\r\ncame from Agesilaus and offered them ten talents to be gone, thus\r\npaying them for doing what they had long before determined to do of\r\ntheir own accord.\r\n\r\nXXXIII. I cannot tell, however, how it was that Theopompus discovered\r\nthis fact, and that no other historian mentions it. All writers agree,\r\nnevertheless, in declaring that at this crisis Sparta was saved by\r\nAgesilaus, who proved himself superior to party-spirit and desire of\r\npersonal distinction, and steadily refused to risk an engagement. Yet\r\nhe never was able to restore the city to the glorious and powerful\r\ncondition which it had previously held, for Sparta, like an athlete\r\nwho has been carefully trained throughout his life, suddenly broke\r\ndown, and never recovered her former strength and prosperity. It is\r\nvery natural that this should have happened, for the Spartan\r\nconstitution was an excellent one for promoting courage, good order,\r\nand peace within the city itself; but when Sparta became the head of a\r\ngreat empire to be maintained by the sword, which Lykurgus would have\r\nthought a totally useless appendage to a well-governed and prosperous\r\ncity, it utterly failed.\r\n\r\nAgesilaus was now too old for active service in the field, but his\r\nson, Archidamus, with some Sicilian mercenary troops which had been\r\nsent to the aid of the Spartans by the despot Dionysius, defeated the\r\nArcadians in what was known as the 'Tearless Battle,' where he did not\r\nlose one of his own men, but slew many of the enemy. This battle\r\nstrikingly proved the weakness of the city, for in former times the\r\nSpartans used to regard it as such a natural and commonplace event for\r\nthem to conquer their enemies, that they only sacrificed a cock to the\r\ngods, while those who had won a victory never boasted of it, and those\r\nwho heard of it expressed no extravagant delight at the news. When the\r\nEphors heard of the battle at Mantinea, which is mentioned by\r\nThucydides in his history, they gave the messenger who brought the\r\ntidings a piece of meat from the public dining-table, as a present for\r\nhis good news, and nothing more. But now, when the news of this battle\r\nreached Sparta, and Archidamus marched triumphantly into the town, all\r\ntheir accustomed reserve broke down. His father was the first to meet\r\nhim, weeping for joy. After him came the senate, and the elders and\r\nwomen flocked down to the river side, holding up their hands to heaven\r\nand giving thanks to the gods for having put away the undeserved\r\nreproach of Sparta, and having once more allowed her to raise her\r\nhead. It is said, indeed, that the Spartans before this battle were so\r\nmuch ashamed of themselves, that they dared not even look their wives\r\nin the face.\r\n\r\nXXXIV. The independence of Messenia had been restored by Epameinondas,\r\nand its former citizens collected together from all quarters of\r\nGreece. The Lacedæmonians dared not openly attack these men, but they\r\nfelt angry with Agesilaus, because during his reign they had lost so\r\nfine a country, as large as Laconia itself, and as fertile as any part\r\nof Greece, after having enjoyed the possession of it for so many\r\nyears. For this reason Agesilaus refused to accept the terms of peace\r\noffered by the Thebans. He was so unwilling to give up his nominal\r\nclaim to Messenia, although he had practically lost that country, that\r\ninstead of recovering it he very nearly lost Sparta as well, as he was\r\nout-manœuvred by Epameinondas. This happened in the following manner.\r\nThe people of Mantinea revolted from the Thebans, and solicited aid\r\nfrom the Lacedæmonians. When Epameinondas heard that Agesilaus was\r\nmarching thither at the head of an army, he eluded the Mantineans by a\r\nnight march from Tegea, invaded the Lacedæmonium territory, and very\r\nnearly succeeded in avoiding the army of Agesilaus and catching Sparta\r\ndefenceless. However, Euthynus of Thespiæ, according to Kallisthenes,\r\nor, according to Xenophon, a certain Cretan warned Agesilaus of his\r\ndanger, upon which he at once sent a mounted messenger to the city\r\nwith the news, and shortly afterwards marched thither himself. Soon\r\nthe Thebans appeared, crossed the Eurotas, and assaulted the city with\r\ngreat fury, while Agesilaus, old as he was, defended it with all the\r\nspirit and energy of youth. He did not, as on the former occasion,\r\nconsider that caution would be of any service, but perceived that\r\nreckless daring alone could save Sparta. And by incredible daring he\r\ndid then snatch the city from the grasp of Epameinondas, and set up a\r\ntrophy of victory, having afforded to the women and children the\r\nglorious spectacle of the men of Lacedæmon doing their duty on behalf\r\nof the country which reared them. There, too, might Archidamus be seen\r\nin the thick of the fight, displaying the courage of a man, and the\r\nswiftness of a youth, as he ran to each point where the Spartans\r\nseemed likely to give way, and everywhere with a few followers\r\nresisted a multitude of the enemy. I think, however, that Isidas, the\r\nson of Phœbidas, must have been most admired both by his own\r\ncountrymen and even by the enemy. He was remarkably tall and handsome,\r\nand was just of the age when boyhood merges into manhood. Naked,\r\nwithout either clothes or armour, having just been anointing himself\r\nat home, he rushed out of his house, with a sword in one hand and a\r\nspear in the other, ran through the front ranks, and plunged among the\r\nenemy, striking down all who opposed him. He received not a single\r\nwound, either because the gods admired his bravery and protected him,\r\nor else because he appeared to his foes to be something more than man.\r\nAfter this exploit we are told that the Ephors crowned him for his\r\nbravery, and fined him a thousand drachmas for having fought without\r\nhis shield.\r\n\r\nXXXV. A few days afterwards was fought the battle of Mantinea, where,\r\njust as Epameinondas was carrying all before him and urging his troops\r\nto pursue, Antikrates the Lacedæmonium met him and wounded him,\r\naccording to Dioskorides with a spear, while the Lacedæmonians to this\r\nday call the descendants of Antikrates Machairones, that is, children\r\nof the sword, as though he struck him with a sword. Indeed, they\r\nregarded Antikrates with such a love and admiration, because of the\r\nterror which Epameinondas had struck into their hearts while he was\r\nalive, that they decreed especial honours and presents to be bestowed\r\nupon him, and granted to his descendants an immunity from taxes and\r\npublic burdens which is enjoyed at the present day by Kallikrates, one\r\nof the descendants of Antikrates.\r\n\r\nAfter this battle and the death of Epameinondas the Greek states made\r\npeace between one another. When, however, all the other states were\r\nswearing to observe the peace, Agesilaus objected to the Messenians,\r\nmen, he said, without a city, swearing any such oath. The rest,\r\nhowever, raised no objections to the oath of the Messenians, and the\r\nLacedæmonians upon this refused to take any part in the proceedings,\r\nso that they alone remained at war, because they hoped to recover the\r\nterritory of Messenia. Agesilaus was thought an obstinate and headlong\r\nman, and insatiable of war, because he took such pains to undermine\r\nthe general peace, and to keep Sparta at war at a time when he was in\r\nsuch distress for money to carry it on, that he was obliged to borrow\r\nfrom his personal friends and to get up subscriptions among the\r\ncitizens, and when he had much better have allowed the state some\r\nrepose and watched for a suitable opportunity to regain the country;\r\ninstead of which, although he had lost so great an empire by sea and\r\nland, he yet insisted on continuing his frantic and fruitless efforts\r\nto reconquer the paltry territory of Messenia.\r\n\r\nXXXVI. He still further tarnished his glory by taking service under\r\nthe Egyptian Tachos. It was thought unworthy of a man who had proved\r\nhimself the bravest and best soldier in Greece, and who had filled all\r\nthe inhabited world with his fame, to hire himself out to a barbarian\r\nrebel, and make a profit of his great name and military reputation,\r\njust like any vulgar captain of mercenaries. If, when more than eighty\r\nyears old, and almost crippled by honourable wounds, he had again\r\nplaced himself at the head of a glorious crusade against the Persian\r\non behalf of the liberties of Greece, all men would have admired his\r\nspirit, but even then would not entirely have approved of the\r\nundertaking; for to make an action noble, time and place must be\r\nfitting, since it is this alone that decides whether an action be good\r\nor bad. Agesilaus, however, cared nothing for his reputation, and\r\nconsidered that no service undertaken for the good of his country\r\nwould be dishonourable or unworthy of him, but thought it much more\r\nunworthy and dishonourable to sit uselessly waiting for death at home.\r\nHe raised a body of mercenary troops with the money furnished by\r\nTachos, and set sail, accompanied, as in his former expedition, by\r\nthirty Spartan counsellors.\r\n\r\nWhen he landed in Egypt, the chief generals and ministers of King\r\nTachos at once came to pay their court to him. The other Egyptians\r\nalso eagerly crowded to see Agesilaus, of whom they had heard so much.\r\nWhen, however, they saw only a little deformed old man, in mean\r\nattire, sitting on the grass, they began to ridicule him, and\r\ncontemptuously to allude to the proverb of the mountain in labour,\r\nwhich brought forth a mouse. They were even more astonished when, of\r\nthe presents offered to him, he accepted flour, calves, and geese, but\r\nrefused to receive dried fruits, pastry, and perfumes. When greatly\r\npressed to accept of these things, he ordered them to be given to the\r\nhelots. Yet we are told by Theophrastes that he was much pleased with\r\nthe flowering papyrus, of which garlands are made, because of its neat\r\nand clean appearance, and he begged for and received some of this\r\nplant from the king when he left Egypt.\r\n\r\nXXXVII. When he joined Tachos, who was engaged in preparing his forces\r\nfor a campaign, he was disappointed in not receiving the chief\r\ncommand, but being merely appointed to lead the mercenary troops,\r\nwhile Chabrias the Athenian was in command of the fleet, Tachos\r\nhimself acting as commander-in-chief. This was the first vexatious\r\ncircumstance which occurred to Agesilaus; and soon he began to feel\r\ngreat annoyance at the vainglorious swaggering tone of the Egyptian\r\nking, which nevertheless he was obliged to endure throughout the whole\r\nof a naval expedition which they undertook against the Phœnicians,\r\nduring which he suppressed his feelings of disgust as well as he could\r\nuntil at last he had an opportunity of showing them. Nektanebis, the\r\ncousin of Tachos, and the commander of a large portion of his force,\r\nrevolted, and caused himself to be proclaimed King of Egypt. He at\r\nonce sent to Agesilaus begging for his assistance, and he also made\r\nthe same proposals to Chabrias, offering them great rewards if they\r\nwould join him.\r\n\r\nTachos, hearing of this, also began to supplicate them to stand by\r\nhim, and Chabrias besought Agesilaus to remain in the service of\r\nTachos, and to act as his friend. To this, however, Agesilaus\r\nanswered, \"You, Chabrias, have come here on your own responsibility,\r\nand are able to act as you please. I was given by Sparta to the\r\nEgyptians as their general. It would not become me, therefore, to make\r\nwar against those whom I was sent to aid, unless my country orders me\r\nto do so.\" After expressing himself thus, he sent messengers to\r\nSparta, with instructions to depreciate Tachos, and to praise\r\nNektanebis. Both these princes also sent embassies to the\r\nLacedæmonians, the one begging for aid as their old friend and ally,\r\nthe other making large promises of future good-will towards them.\r\nAfter hearing both sides, the Spartans publicly answered the\r\nEgyptians, that Agesilaus would decide between them, and they sent\r\nhim a private despatch, bidding him to do what was best for Sparta.\r\nHereupon Agesilaus and the mercenaries left Tachos, and joined\r\nNektanebis, making the interests of his country the pretext for his\r\nextraordinary conduct, which we can hardly call anything better than\r\ntreachery. However, the Lacedæmonians regard that course as the most\r\nhonourable which is the most advantageous to their country, and know\r\nnothing of right or wrong, but only how to make Sparta great.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. Tachos, deserted by the mercenaries, now fled for his life;\r\nbut another claimant of the throne arose in the district of Mendes,\r\nand made war against Nektanebis with an army of one hundred thousand\r\nmen. Nektanebis, in his talk with Agesilaus, spoke very confidently\r\nabout this force, saying that they were indeed very numerous, but a\r\nmere mixed multitude of rustic recruits, whom he could afford to\r\ndespise. To these remarks Agesilaus answered, \"It is not their\r\nnumbers, but their ignorance which I fear, lest we should be unable to\r\ndeceive them. Stratagems in war consist in unexpectedly falling upon\r\nmen who are expecting an attack from some other quarter, but a man who\r\nexpects nothing gives his enemy no opportunity to take him unawares,\r\njust as in wrestling one cannot throw one's adversary if he stands\r\nstill.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mendesian soon began to intrigue with Agesilaus, and Nektanebis\r\nfeared much that he might succeed in detaching him from himself.\r\nConsequently, when Agesilaus advised him to fight as soon as possible,\r\nand not prolong the war against men who were indeed inexperienced in\r\nbattle, but who were able, from their enormous numbers, to raise vast\r\nentrenchments and surround him on every side, he took the exactly\r\nopposite course, and retired to a strongly fortified city, of great\r\nextent, viewing Agesilaus with suspicion and fear. Agesilaus was\r\ngrieved at this, but, feeling ashamed to change sides a second time\r\nand so completely fail in his mission, he followed Nektanebis into his\r\nfortress.\r\n\r\nXXXIX. When the enemy advanced and began to build a wall round the\r\ncity, Nektanebis, fearing the consequences of a siege, was eager to\r\nfight, as were also the Greeks, for they were very short of\r\nprovisions. Agesilaus, however, opposed this design, for which he was\r\nheartily abused by the Egyptians, who called him a traitor and the\r\nbetrayer of their king. He paid but little attention to their\r\nslanders, but watched for an opportunity to effect the project which\r\nhe had conceived. This was as follows:--The enemy were digging a\r\ntrench round the city, with the intention of completely isolating the\r\ngarrison and starving it out. When then the two ends of this trench,\r\nwhich was to surround the city, had nearly met, Agesilaus towards\r\nevening ordered the Greeks to get under arms, and, proceeding to\r\nNektanebis, said, \"Young man, this is our opportunity. I would not say\r\nanything about it before, lest the secret should be divulged. But now\r\nthe enemy themselves have secured our position by digging this\r\nenormous trench; for the part of it which is completed will keep off\r\ntheir superior numbers from us, while upon the ground which still\r\nremains unbroken we can fight them on equal terms. Come now, prove\r\nyourself a man of courage, charge bravely with us, and save both\r\nyourself and your army. Those of the enemy whom we first attack will\r\nnot be able to resist our onset, and the rest will not be able to\r\nreach us because of the trench.\"\r\n\r\nNektanebis was surprised at the ingenuity of Agesilaus, placed himself\r\nin the midst of the Greeks, and charging with them gained an easy\r\nvictory. Having once established an ascendancy over the mind of\r\nNektanebis, Agesilaus now proceeded to use the same trick again with\r\nthe enemy. By alternately retreating and advancing he led them on\r\nuntil he had enticed them into a place between two deep canals. Here\r\nhe at once formed his troops on a front equal to the space between the\r\ncanals, and charged the enemy, who were unable to use their numbers to\r\noutflank and surround him. After a short resistance they fled. Many\r\nwere slain, and the rest completely dispersed.\r\n\r\nXL. This victory secured the throne of Egypt for Nektanebis. He now\r\nshowed great esteem for Agesilaus, and begged him to remain in Egypt\r\nduring the winter. Agesilaus, however, was anxious to return home and\r\nassist in the war which was going on there, as he knew that Sparta was\r\nin great want of money, and was paying a force of mercenary troops.\r\nNektanebis escorted him out of the country with great honour, giving\r\nhim many presents, and the sum of two hundred and thirty talents of\r\nsilver to be used in meeting the expenses of the war. As it was\r\nwinter, and stormy weather, Agesilaus did not venture to cross the\r\nopen sea, but coasted along the shores of Libya, as far as a desert\r\nspot known as the Harbour of Menelaus, where he died, in the\r\neighty-fourth year of his age, and having been king of Sparta for\r\nforty-one years, during thirty of which he was the greatest and most\r\npowerful man in Greece, having been looked upon as all but the king of\r\nthe whole country, up to the time of the battle of Leuktra.\r\n\r\nIt was the Spartan custom, in the case of citizens who died in foreign\r\ncountries, to pay them the last rites wherever they might be, but to\r\ntake home the remains of their kings. Consequently the Spartan\r\ncounsellors enveloped the body in melted wax, as they could not obtain\r\nhoney, and took it home to Lacedæmon.\r\n\r\nArchidamus, the son of Agesilaus, succeeded him on the throne, and his\r\nposterity continued to reign until Agis, the fifth in descent from\r\nAgesilaus, was murdered by Leonidas, because he endeavoured to restore\r\nthe ancient discipline of Sparta.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 174: This passage has been admirably paraphrased by Grote,\r\n'History of Greece,' Part II. ch. lxxiii.:--\r\n\r\n\"Combined with that ability and energy in which he was never\r\ndeficient, this conciliatory policy ensured him more real power than\r\nhad ever fallen to the lot of any king of Sparta--power, not merely\r\nover the military operations abroad, which usually fell to the kings,\r\nbut also over the policy of the state at home. On the increase and\r\nmaintenance of that real power, his chief thoughts were concentrated;\r\nnew dispositions generated by kingship, which had never shown\r\nthemselves in him before. Despising, like Lysander, both money,\r\nluxury, and all the outward show of power, he exhibited, as a king, an\r\nultra-Spartan simplicity, carried almost to affectation in diet,\r\nclothing, and general habits. But like Lysander, also, he delighted in\r\nthe exercise of dominion through the medium of knots or factions of\r\ndevoted partizans, whom he rarely scrupled to uphold in all their\r\ncareer of injustice and oppression. Though an amiable man, with no\r\ndisposition to tyranny and still less to plunder, for his own\r\nbenefit--Agesilaus thus made himself the willing instrument of both,\r\nfor the benefit of his various coadjutors and friends, whose power and\r\nconsequence he identified with his own.\" See also infra, ch. xiii. et\r\nal.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 175: We see here the beginning of that tendency of the\r\nNeoplatonic school to find a sanction for all their theories in some\r\nperversion of the plain meaning of Homer's words.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 176: Compare Life of Lysander, ch. xxiii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 177: In Sintenis's text of Plutarch this prince's name is\r\nspelt as above.

But he\r\nintroduces it in a very bold and abrupt way, such as cannot be\r\nconformable to the reality. To raise a question about the right of\r\nSparta to govern Laconia was a most daring novelty. A courageous and\r\npatriotic Theban might venture upon it as a retort against those\r\nSpartans who questioned the right of Thebes to her presidency of\r\nBœotia; but he would never do so without assigning his reasons to\r\njustify an assertion so startling to a large portion of his hearers.\r\nThe reasons which I here ascribe to Epameinondas are such as we know\r\nto have formed the Theban creed, in reference to the Bœotian cities;\r\nsuch as were actually urged by the Theban orator in 427 B.C., when the\r\nfate of the Platæan captives was under discussion. After Epameinondas\r\nhad once laid out the reasons in support of his assertion, he might\r\nthen, if the same brief question were angrily put to him a second\r\ntime, meet it with another equally brief counter-question or retort.\r\nIt is this final interchange of thrusts which Plutarch has given,\r\nomitting the arguments previously stated by Epameinondas, and\r\nnecessary to warrant the seeming paradox which he advances. We must\r\nrecollect that Epameinondas does not contend that Thebes was entitled\r\nto _as much power_ in Bœotia as Sparta in Laconia. He only contends\r\nthat Bœotia, under the presidency of Thebes, was as much an integral\r\npolitical aggregate, as Laconia under Sparta--in reference to the\r\nGrecian world.\"--Grote's 'History of Greece,' part ii. ch. lxvii.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF POMPEIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Towards Pompeius the Roman people seem to have been disposed from\r\nthe very first, just as the Prometheus of Aeschylus[189] was towards\r\nhis deliverer Hercules, when he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Though hateful is the sire, most dear to me the son.\"\r\n\r\nFor neither did the Romans ever display hatred so violent and savage\r\ntowards any commander as towards Strabo[190] the father of Pompeius,\r\nwhom they dreaded, when he was alive, for his military talent, for he\r\nwas a man most expert in arms; and when he was killed by lightning and\r\nhis body was carried out to interment they pulled it from the bier on\r\nwhich it was lying and treated it with indignity: nor, on the other\r\nhand, did any other Roman besides Pompeius ever receive from the\r\npeople tokens of affection so strong, or so early, or which grew so\r\nrapidly with his good fortune, or abided with him so firmly in his\r\nreverses. The cause of their hatred to the father was his insatiable\r\navarice: the causes of their affection to the son were many; his\r\ntemperate life, his practice in arms, the persuasiveness of his\r\nspeech, the integrity of his character, and his affability to every\r\nman who came in his way, so that there was no man from whom another\r\ncould ask a favour with so little pain, and no man whose requests\r\nanother would more willingly labour to satisfy. For in addition to his\r\nother endearing qualities, Pompeius could give without seeming to\r\nconfer a favour, and he could receive with dignity.\r\n\r\nII. At the beginning also his countenance contributed in no small\r\ndegree to win the good-will of the people and to secure a favourable\r\nreception before he opened his mouth. For the sweetness of his\r\nexpression was mingled with dignity and kindness, and while he was yet\r\nin the very bloom of youth his noble and kingly nature clearly showed\r\nitself. There was also a slight falling back of the hair and softness\r\nin the expression of his eyes, which produced a resemblance to the\r\nlikenesses of Alexander, though indeed the resemblance was more talked\r\nof than real. Accordingly many at first gave him the name, which\r\nPompeius did not object to, whence some in derision called him\r\nAlexander. It was in allusion to this that Lucius Philippus,[191] a\r\nconsular man, when he was speaking in favour of Pompeius, said it was\r\nnothing strange if he who was Philippus loved Alexander. They used to\r\nreport that Flora the courtesan, when she was now advanced in years,\r\nalways spoke with pleasure of her intimacy with Pompeius, and said\r\nthat she could never leave the embrace of Pompeius without bearing\r\nmarks[192] of the ardour of his passion. Besides this, Flora used to\r\ntell that Geminius, one of the companions of Pompeius, conceived a\r\npassion for her, and plagued her much with his solicitations, and when\r\nshe said that for the sake of Pompeius she could not consent, Geminius\r\napplied to Pompeius. Now Pompeius, as she told the story, gave\r\nGeminius permission, but he never after touched Flora or had a meeting\r\nwith her, though it was believed that he was attached to her; and\r\nFlora did not take this as most courtesans do, but was ill for a long\r\ntime through grief and regret for the loss of her lover. And indeed it\r\nis said that Flora enjoyed such reputation and was so much talked of,\r\nthat Cæcilius Metellus, when he was ornamenting the temple of the\r\nDioscuri with statues and paintings, had the portrait of Flora painted\r\nand placed in the temple on account of her beauty. The wife of his\r\nfreedman Demetrius also, who had the greatest influence with Pompeius\r\nand left a property of four thousand talents, contrary to his habit he\r\ndid not treat kindly nor in a manner befitting her free condition: but\r\nit was through fear of her beauty, which was irresistible and much\r\ntalked about, and that he might not appear to be captivated by her.\r\nThough he was so exceedingly cautious in such matters and so much on\r\nhis guard, yet he did not escape the imputations of his enemies on the\r\nground of amours, but he was slanderously accused of commerce with\r\nmarried women and of betraying many of the public interests to gratify\r\nthem. Of his temperance and simplicity in his way of living the\r\nfollowing anecdote is told. On one occasion when he was ill and\r\nindisposed to his ordinary food, the physician prescribed a thrush for\r\nhim. After search had been made and none found, for the season was\r\npast, some one observed that one might be found at the house of\r\nLucullus, for he kept them all the year round: \"Well then,\" said\r\nPompeius, \"I suppose if Lucullus were not luxurious, Pompeius could\r\nnot live;\" and without regarding the physician's advice he took\r\nsomething that was ready at hand. This, however, belongs to a later\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nIII. When he was still quite a youth and was serving under his father,\r\nwho was opposed to Cinna, he had one Lucius Terentius[193] for his\r\ncompanion and tent-mate. This Lucius being bribed by Cinna, designed\r\nto kill Pompeius, and others were to fire the general's tent.\r\nInformation of this came to Pompeius while he was at supper, at which,\r\nnothing disturbed, he went on drinking more gaily, and showing great\r\nsigns of affection towards Terentius; but when they were turning in to\r\nrest he slipped unobserved from under the tent, and after placing a\r\nguard about his father, kept quiet. When Terentius thought the time\r\nwas come, drawing his sword he got up, and approaching the bed of\r\nPompeius, he struck many blows upon the bed-covering, supposing that\r\nPompeius was lying there. Upon this there was a great commotion owing\r\nto the soldiers' hatred of their general, and there was a movement\r\nmade towards mutiny by the men beginning to pull down the tents and\r\ntake their arms. The general, fearing the tumult, did not come near;\r\nbut Pompeius, going about in the midst of the soldiers, implored them\r\nwith tears in his eyes, and finally throwing himself on his face\r\nbefore the gate of the camp right in their way, he lay there weeping,\r\nand told those who were going out to trample on him, so that every man\r\ndrew back for very shame, and thus the whole army, with the exception\r\nof eight hundred men, changed their design and were reconciled to\r\ntheir commander.\r\n\r\nIV. Upon the death of Strabo, Pompeius had to defend a prosecution in\r\nrespect of a charge of peculation against his father. He detected one\r\nof his freedmen in having appropriated most of the property, and\r\nproved it to the magistrates; but he was himself accused of having in\r\nhis possession hunting nets and books which were taken among the\r\nplunder at Asculum.[194] He received these things from his father when\r\nhe took Asculum, but he lost them after his return to Rome, when the\r\nguards of Cinna broke into his house and plundered it. He had many\r\npreliminary contests with the accuser before the trial commenced, in\r\nwhich, by showing himself to possess an acuteness and firmness above\r\nhis years, he got great reputation and popularity, so that\r\nAntistius,[195] who was prætor and presided at that trial, conceived a\r\ngreat affection for Pompeius, and offered him his daughter to wife,\r\nand spoke about it to his friends. Pompeius accepted the proposal, and\r\nan agreement was secretly made between them; but yet the matter did\r\nnot fail to be generally known by reason of the partizanship of\r\nAntistius. When at last Antistius declared the votes of the judices to\r\nbe for his acquittal, the people, as if a signal had been concerted,\r\ncalled out the name Talasius,[196] which, pursuant to an old custom,\r\nthey are used to utter on the occasion of a marriage. This ancient\r\ncustom, they say, had the following origin: When the daughters of the\r\nSabines had come to Rome to see the games, and the noblest among the\r\nRomans were carrying them off to be their wives, some goatherds and\r\nherdsmen of mean condition took upon their shoulders a tall handsome\r\nmaid and were carrying her off. In order, however, that none of the\r\nbetter sort who might fall in with them should attempt to take the\r\nmaid from them, they called out as they ran along that she was for\r\nTalasius (now Talasius was a man of rank and much beloved), so that\r\nthose who heard the cry clapped their hands and shouted as being\r\npleased at what the men were doing and commending them for it. From\r\nthis time forth, as the story goes, inasmuch as the marriage of\r\nTalasius turned out to be a happy one, it is usual to utter the same\r\nexpression by way of merriment at the occasion of a marriage. This is\r\nthe most probable story among those which are told about the name\r\nTalasius. However, a few days after the trial Pompeius married\r\nAntistia.\r\n\r\nV. Having gone to Cinna[197] to the camp, Pompeius became alarmed in\r\nconsequence of some charge and false accusation, and he quickly stole\r\nout of the way. On his disappearing, a rumour went through the camp\r\nand a report that Cinna had murdered the young man, whereupon the\r\nsoldiers, who had long been weary of him and hated their general, made\r\nan assault upon him. Cinna attempted to escape, but he was overtaken\r\nby a centurion, who pursued him with his naked sword. Cinna fell down\r\nat the knees of the centurion, and offered him his seal ring, which\r\nwas of great price; but the centurion with great contempt replied: \"I\r\nam not going to seal a contract, but to punish an abominable and\r\nunjust tyrant,\" and so killed him. Cinna thus perished, but he was\r\nsucceeded in the direction of affairs by Carbo, a still more furious\r\ntyrant than himself, who kept the power in his hands till Sulla\r\nadvanced against him, to the great joy of the most part, who in their\r\npresent sufferings thought even a change of masters no small profit.\r\nTo such a condition had calamities brought the state, that men\r\ndespairing of freedom sought a more moderate slavery.\r\n\r\nVI. Now about this time Pompeius was tarrying in Picenum in Italy, for\r\nhe had estates[198] there, but mainly because he liked the cities,\r\nwhich were well disposed and friendly towards him by reason of their\r\nancient connection with his father. Seeing that the most distinguished\r\nand chief of the citizens were leaving their property and flocking\r\nfrom all sides to Sulla's camp as to a harbour of refuge, Pompeius did\r\nnot think it becoming in him to steal away to Sulla like a fugitive,\r\nnor without bringing some contribution, nor yet as if he wanted help,\r\nbut he thought that he should begin by doing Sulla some service and so\r\napproach with credit and a force. Accordingly he attempted to rouse\r\nthe people of Picenum, who readily listened to his proposals, and paid\r\nno attention to those who came from Carbo. A certain Vindius having\r\nremarked that Pompeius had just quitted school to start up among them\r\nas a popular leader, the people were so infuriated that they\r\nforthwith fell on Vindius and killed him. Upon this Pompeius, who was\r\nnow three and twenty years of age, without being appointed general by\r\nany one, but himself assuming the command in Auximum,[199] a large\r\ncity, placing a tribunal in the forum and by edict ordering two\r\nbrothers Ventidii who were among the chief persons in the place and\r\nwere opposing him on behalf of Carbo, to quit the city, began to\r\nenlist soldiers, and to appoint centurions and officers over them, and\r\nhe went to all the surrounding cities and did the same. All who were\r\nof Carbo's party got up and quitted the cities, but the rest gladly\r\nput themselves in the hands of Pompeius, who thus in a short time\r\nraised three complete legions, and having supplied himself with\r\nprovisions and beasts of burden and waggons and everything else that\r\nan army requires, advanced towards Sulla, neither hurrying nor yet\r\ncontent with passing along unobserved, but lingering by the way to\r\nharass the enemy, and endeavouring to detach from Carbo every part of\r\nItaly that he visited.\r\n\r\nVII. Now there rose up against him three hostile generals at once,\r\nCarinna,[200] and Clœlius and Brutus, not all in front, nor yet all\r\nfrom the same quarter, but they surrounded him with three armies, with\r\nthe view of completely destroying him. Pompeius was not alarmed, but\r\ngetting all his force together he attacked one of the armies, that of\r\nBrutus, placing in the front his cavalry, among whom he himself was.\r\nFrom the side of the enemy the Celtæ rode out to meet him, when\r\nPompeius with spear in hand struck the first and strongest of them and\r\nbrought him down; on which the rest fled and put the infantry also\r\ninto confusion, so that there was a general rout. Hereupon the\r\ngenerals quarrelled among themselves and retired, as each best could,\r\nand the cities took the part of Pompeius, seeing that the enemy had\r\ndispersed in alarm. Next came Scipio[201] the consul against him, but\r\nbefore the lines had come close enough to discharge their javelins,\r\nthe soldiers of Scipio saluted those of Pompeius and changed sides,\r\nand Scipio made his escape. Finally, near the river Arsis,[202] Carbo\r\nhimself attacked Pompeius with several troops of horse, but Pompeius\r\nbravely stood the attack, and putting them to flight pursued and drove\r\nall of them upon difficult ground where no cavalry could act; and the\r\nmen, seeing that there was no hope of saving themselves, surrendered\r\nwith their arms and horses.\r\n\r\nVIII. Sulla had not yet received intelligence of these events, but\r\nupon the first news and reports about Pompeius, being alarmed at his\r\nbeing among so many hostile generals of such reputation, he made haste\r\nto relieve him. Pompeius being informed that Sulla was near, ordered\r\nhis officers to arm the forces and to display them in such manner that\r\nthey might make the most gallant and splendid appearance to the\r\nImperator, for he expected to receive great honours from him; and he\r\ngot more than he expected. For when Sulla saw him approaching and his\r\narmy standing by, admirable for the brave appearance of the men and\r\nelated and rejoicing in their success, he leapt down from his horse,\r\nand being addressed, according to custom, by the title of Imperator,\r\nhe addressed Pompeius in return by the title of Imperator, though\r\nnobody would have expected that Sulla would give to a young man who\r\nwas not yet a member of the Senate, the title for which he was\r\nfighting against the Scipios and the Marii. And indeed everything else\r\nwas in accordance with the first greeting, for Sulla used to rise from\r\nhis seat as Pompeius approached and take his vest from his head, which\r\nhe was not observed to do generally to any other person, though there\r\nwere many distinguished men about him. Pompeius, however, was not made\r\nvain by these marks of distinction, but on being immediately sent into\r\nGaul by Sulla, where Metellus[203] commanded and appeared to be doing\r\nnothing correspondent to his means, Pompeius said it was not right to\r\ntake the command from a man who was his senior and superior in\r\nreputation; however he said he was ready to carry on the war in\r\nconjunction with Metellus, if he had no objection, in obedience to his\r\norders and to give him his assistance. Metellus accepted the proposal\r\nand wrote to him to come, on which Pompeius entering Gaul, performed\r\nnoble exploits, and he also fanned into a flame again and warmed the\r\nwarlike and courageous temper of Metellus, which was now near becoming\r\nextinct through old age, as the liquid, heated stream of copper by\r\nflowing about the hard, cold metal is said to soften and to liquefy it\r\ninto its own mass better than the fire. But as in the case of an\r\nathlete[204] who has obtained the first place among men and has\r\ngloriously vanquished in every contest, his boyish victories are made\r\nof no account and are not registered; so the deeds which Pompeius then\r\naccomplished, though of themselves extraordinary, yet as they were\r\nburied under the number and magnitude of his subsequent struggles and\r\nwars, I have been afraid to disturb them, lest if we should dwell too\r\nlong on his first exploits, we should miss the acts and events which\r\nare the most important and best show the character of the man.\r\n\r\nIX.[205] Now when Sulla was master of Italy and was proclaimed\r\nDictator, he rewarded the other officers and generals by making them\r\nrich and promoting them to magistracies and by granting them without\r\nstint and with readiness what they asked for. But as he admired\r\nPompeius for his superior merit and thought that he would be a great\r\nsupport to his own interests, he was anxious in some way to attach him\r\nby family relations. Metella, the wife of Sulla, had also the same\r\nwish, and they persuaded Pompeius to put away Antistia and to take to\r\nwife Aemilia, the step-daughter of Sulla, the child of Metella by\r\nScaurus, who was then living with her husband and was pregnant. This\r\nmatter of the marriage was of a tyrannical character, and more suited\r\nto the interests of Sulla than conformable to the character of\r\nPompeius, for Aemilia, who was pregnant, was taken from another to be\r\nmarried to him, and Antistia was put away with dishonour and under\r\nlamentable circumstances, inasmuch as she had just lost her father\r\nalso, and that, too, on her husband's account; for Antistius was\r\nmurdered in the Senate-house because he was considered to be an\r\nadherent of Sulla for the sake of Pompeius; and the mother of Antistia\r\nhaving witnessed all this put an end to her life, so that this\r\nmisfortune was added to the tragedy of the marriage; and in sooth\r\nanother besides, for Aemilia herself died immediately afterwards in\r\nchild-birth in the house of Pompeius.\r\n\r\nX. After this, news arrived that Perpenna[206] was securing Sicily for\r\nhimself, and that the island was supplying to those who remained of\r\nthe opposite faction a point for concentrating their forces; for\r\nCarbo[207] was afloat in those parts with a navy, and Domitius had\r\nfallen upon Libya, and many other fugitives of note were crowding\r\nthere, who had escaped from the proscriptions. Against these Pompeius\r\nwas sent with a large force: and Perpenna immediately evacuated Sicily\r\nupon his arrival. Pompeius relieved the cities which had been harshly\r\ntreated, and behaved kindly to them all except to the Mamertini in\r\nMessene. For when the Mamertini protested against the tribunal and the\r\nRoman administration of justice, on the ground that there was an old\r\nRoman enactment which forbade their introduction, \"Won't you stop,\"\r\nsaid he, \"citing laws to us who have our swords by our sides?\" It was\r\nconsidered also that Pompeius triumphed over the misfortunes of Carbo\r\nin an inhuman manner. For if it was necessary to put Carbo to death,\r\nas perhaps it was, he ought to have been put to death as soon as he\r\nwas taken, and then the act might have been imputed to him who gave\r\nthe order. But Pompeius produced in chains a Roman who had three times\r\nbeen Consul, and making him stand in front of the tribunal while he\r\nwas sitting, sat in judgment on him, to the annoyance and vexation of\r\nthose who were present; after which he ordered him to be removed and\r\nput to death. They say that when Carbo had been dragged off, seeing\r\nthe sword already bared, he begged them to allow him to retire for a\r\nshort time as his bowels were disordered. Caius Oppius,[208] the\r\nfriend of Cæsar, says that Pompeius behaved inhumanly to Quintus\r\nValerius also; for Pompeius, who knew that Valerius was a learned man\r\nand a particular lover of learning, embraced him, and after walking\r\nabout with him and questioning him about what he wanted to know, and\r\ngetting his answer, he ordered his attendants to take Valerius away\r\nand immediately put him to death. But when Oppius is speaking of the\r\nenemies or friends of Cæsar, it is necessary to be very cautious in\r\nbelieving what he says. Now as to those enemies of Sulla who were of\r\nthe greatest note and were openly taken, Pompeius of necessity\r\npunished them; but as to the rest he allowed as many as he could to\r\nescape detection, and he even aided some in getting away. Pompeius had\r\ndetermined to punish the inhabitants of Himera which had sided with\r\nthe enemy; but Sthenis the popular leader having asked for a\r\nconference with him, told Pompeius that he would not do right, if he\r\nlet the guilty escape and punished the innocent. On Pompeius asking\r\nwho the guilty man was, Sthenis replied, it was himself, for he had\r\npersuaded those citizens who were his friends, and forced those who\r\nwere his enemies. Pompeius admiring the bold speech and spirit of the\r\nman pardoned him first and then all the rest. Hearing that his\r\nsoldiers were committing excesses on the march, he put a seal on their\r\nswords, and he who broke the seal was punished.\r\n\r\nXI. While he was thus engaged in Sicily and settling the civil\r\nadministration, he received a decree of the Senate and letters from\r\nSulla which contained an order for him to sail to Libya and vigorously\r\noppose Domitius,[209] who had got together a power much larger than\r\nthat with which Marius no long time back had passed over from Libya to\r\nItaly and put all affairs at Rome in confusion by making himself a\r\ntyrant after having been a fugitive. Accordingly making his\r\npreparations with all haste Pompeius left in command in Sicily\r\nMemmius,[210] his sister's husband, and himself set sail with a\r\nhundred and twenty large ships, and eight hundred transports which\r\nconveyed corn, missiles, money, and engines. On his landing with part\r\nof his vessels at Utica and the rest at Carthage, seven thousand men\r\ndeserted from the enemy and came over to him; he had himself six\r\ncomplete legions. It is said that a ludicrous thing occurred here.\r\nSome soldiers having fallen in with a treasure, as it seems, got a\r\nlarge sum of money. The matter becoming known, all the rest of the\r\nsoldiers got a notion that the place was full of money, which they\r\nsupposed to have been hid during the misfortunes of the Carthaginians.\r\nThe consequence was that Pompeius could do nothing with the soldiers\r\nfor many days while they were busy with looking after treasure, but he\r\nwent about laughing and looking on so many thousands all at one time\r\ndigging and turning up the ground, till at last the men were tired and\r\ntold their commander to lead them were he pleased, as they had been\r\npunished enough for their folly.\r\n\r\nXII. Domitius had posted himself to oppose Pompeius, with a ravine in\r\nhis front which was difficult to pass and rough; but a violent rain\r\naccompanied with wind commenced in the morning and continued, so that\r\nDomitius giving up his intention of fighting on that day ordered a\r\nretreat. Pompeius taking advantage of this opportunity advanced\r\nrapidly and began to cross the ravine. But the soldiers of Domitius\r\nwere in disorder and confusion, and what resistance they offered was\r\nneither made by the whole body nor yet in any regular manner: the wind\r\nalso veered round and blew the storm right in their faces. However the\r\nstorm confused the Romans also, for they did not see one another\r\nclearly, and Pompeius himself had a narrow escape with his life, not\r\nbeing recognised by a soldier to whom he was somewhat slow in giving\r\nthe word on being asked for it. Having repulsed the enemy with great\r\nslaughter (for it is said that out of twenty thousand only three\r\nthousand escaped) they saluted Pompeius with the title of Imperator.\r\nBut Pompeius said that he would not accept the honour, so long as the\r\nenemy's encampment was standing, and if they thought him worthy of\r\nthis title they must first destroy the camp, upon which they forthwith\r\nrushed against the rampart, and Pompeius fought without a helmet for\r\nfear of what just had happened. The camp was taken and Domitius fell.\r\nSome of the cities immediately submitted, and others were taken by\r\nstorm. Pompeius also made a prisoner of Iarbas,[211] one of the kings,\r\nwho had sided with Domitius, and he gave his kingdom to Hiempsal.\r\nAvailing himself of his success and the strength of his army he\r\ninvaded Numidia. After advancing many days' march and subduing all\r\nwhom he met with, and firmly establishing the dread of the Romans\r\namong the barbarians which had now somewhat subsided, he said that he\r\nought not to leave even the wild beasts of Libya, without letting them\r\nhave some experience of the strength and courage of the Romans.\r\nAccordingly he spent a few days in hunting lions and elephants;[212]\r\nand in forty days in all, as it is said, he defeated his enemies,\r\nsubdued Libya, and settled all the affairs of the kings, being then in\r\nhis four and twentieth year.\r\n\r\nXIII. On his return to Utica he received letters from Sulla, with\r\norders to disband the rest of the army, and to wait there with one\r\nlegion for his successor in the command. Pompeius was annoyed at this\r\nand took it ill, though he did not show it; but the army openly\r\nexpressed their dissatisfaction, and when Pompeius requested them to\r\nadvance, they abused Sulla, and they said they would not let Pompeius\r\nbe exposed to danger without them, and they advised him not to trust\r\nthe tyrant. At first Pompeius endeavoured to mollify and quiet them,\r\nbut finding that he could not prevail, he descended from the tribunal\r\nand went to his tent weeping. But the soldiers laid hold of him and\r\nagain placed him on the tribunal, and a great part of the day was\r\nspent in the soldiers urging him to stay and be their leader, and in\r\nPompeius entreating the soldiers to be obedient and not to mutiny,\r\ntill at last, as they still urged him and drowned his voice with their\r\ncries, he swore he would kill himself, if they forced him; and so at\r\nlast with great difficulty they were induced to stop. Sulla at first\r\nreceived intelligence that Pompeius had revolted, on which he said to\r\nhis friends, it was his fate now that he was old to fight with boys,\r\nalluding to the fact that Marius, who was very young, gave him most\r\ntrouble, and brought him into the extremest danger; but on hearing the\r\ntrue state of affairs, and perceiving that everybody with right good\r\nwill was eager to receive Pompeius and to escort him, he made haste to\r\noutdo them. Accordingly he advanced and met Pompeius, and receiving\r\nhim with all possible expressions of good-will, he saluted him with a\r\nloud voice by the name of Magnus,[213] and he bade those who were\r\npresent to address him in the same way. The word Magnus means Great.\r\nOthers say that it was in Libya first that the whole army with\r\nacclamation pronounced the name, and that it obtained strength and\r\ncurrency by being confirmed by Sulla. But Pompeius himself, after\r\neverybody else, and some time later when he was sent into Iberia as\r\nproconsul against Sertorius, began to call himself in his letters and\r\nedicts Magnus Pompeius; for the name was no longer invidious when\r\npeople had been made familiar with it. And here one may justly admire\r\nand respect the old Romans, who requited with such appellations and\r\ntitles not success in war and battles only, but honoured therewith\r\npolitical services and merits also. Two men accordingly the people\r\nproclaimed Maximi, which means the Greatest; Valerius,[214] because he\r\nreconciled the senate to the people when there was a misunderstanding\r\nbetween them; and Fabius Rullus,[215] because he ejected from the\r\nsenate certain rich persons the children of freedmen who had been\r\nenrolled in the list of senators.\r\n\r\nXIV. After this Pompeius asked for a triumph, but Sulla opposed his\r\nclaim: for the law gives a triumph to a consul or to a prætor[216]\r\nonly, but to no one else. And this is the reason why the first Scipio,\r\nafter defeating the Carthaginians in greater and more important\r\ncontests in Iberia, did not ask for a triumph, for he was not consul,\r\nnor yet prætor. Sulla considered that if Pompeius, who was not yet\r\nwell bearded, should enter the city in triumph, he who, by reason of\r\nhis age, was not yet a member of the senate, both his own office and\r\nthe honour given to Pompeius would be exposed to much obloquy. Sulla\r\nmade these remarks to Pompeius, to show that he did not intend to let\r\nhim have a triumph, but would resist him and check his ambition, if he\r\nwould not listen to reason. Pompeius, however, was not cowed, but he\r\ntold Sulla to reflect, that more men worship the rising than the\r\nsetting sun, intending him to understand that his own power was on the\r\nincrease, but that the power of Sulla was diminishing and fading away.\r\nSulla did not distinctly hear these words, but observing that those\r\nwho did hear them, by looks and gestures expressed their astonishment,\r\nhe asked what it was that Pompeius had said. When he heard what it\r\nwas, he was confounded at the boldness of Pompeius, and called out\r\ntwice, \"Let him triumph!\" Now many persons were annoyed, and expressed\r\ntheir dissatisfaction at the triumph, on which Pompeius, wishing to\r\nannoy them still more, it is said, made preparation for entering the\r\ncity in a car drawn by four elephants,[217] for he brought from Libya\r\nmany of the king's elephants that he had taken; but as the gate was\r\ntoo narrow, he gave up his project and contented himself with horses.\r\nThe soldiers, who had not obtained as much as they expected, were\r\nready to make a disturbance and impede the triumph, but Pompeius said\r\nthat he cared not for it, and would rather give up the triumph than\r\nhumour them; whereupon Servilius,[218] a man of distinction, who had\r\nmade most opposition to the triumph of Pompeius, said, Now he\r\nperceived that Pompeius was really Great and was worthy of the\r\ntriumph. It is also certain that he might then have been easily\r\nadmitted into the senate, if he had chosen; but he showed no eagerness\r\nfor it, seeking, as they say, reputation from what was unusual. For it\r\nwas nothing surprising if Pompeius were a senator before the age, but\r\nit was a most distinguished honour for him to triumph before he was a\r\nsenator. Another thing also gained him the good-will of the many in no\r\nsmall degree, for the people were delighted at his being reviewed\r\namong the Equites after the triumph.\r\n\r\nXV. Sulla[219] was annoyed to see to what a height of reputation and\r\npower Pompeius was advancing, but as he was ashamed to attempt to\r\ncheck his career he kept quiet. However, when Pompeius had brought\r\nabout the election of Lepidus as consul in spite of Sulla and against\r\nhis wish, by canvassing for Lepidus, and by employing the affection of\r\nthe people towards himself to induce them to favour Lepidus, Sulla\r\nseeing Pompeius retiring with the crowd through the Forum, said, \"I\r\nsee, young man, that you are pleased with your victory: and indeed how\r\ncan it be otherwise than generous and noble, for Lepidus, the vilest\r\nof men, to be declared consul before Catulus the best, through your\r\nmanagement of the people? However, it is time for you not to slumber,\r\nbut to attend to affairs, for you have strengthened your rival against\r\nyourself.\" Sulla showed mainly by his testament that he was not well\r\ndisposed to Pompeius, for he left legacies to his other friends, and\r\nmade them his son's guardians, but he passed over Pompeius\r\naltogether. But Pompeius took this very quietly, and behaved on the\r\noccasion as a citizen should do; and accordingly, when Lepidus and\r\nsome others were putting impediments in the way of the body being\r\ninterred in the Field of Mars, and were not for allowing the funeral\r\nto be public, Pompeius brought his aid, and gave to the interment both\r\nsplendour and security.\r\n\r\nXVI. As soon as Sulla's death made his prophetic warnings manifest,\r\nand Lepidus was attempting to put himself in Sulla's place, not by any\r\ncircuitous movement or contrivance, but by taking up arms forthwith,\r\nand again stirring up and gathering round him the remnants of the\r\nfactions which had long been enfeebled and had escaped from Sulla; and\r\nhis colleague Catulus, to whom the most honest and soundest part of\r\nthe Senate and the people attached themselves, was the first of the\r\nRomans of the day for reputation of temperance and integrity, but was\r\nconsidered to be better adapted for the conduct of civil than of\r\nmilitary affairs, and circumstances themselves were calling for\r\nPompeius, he did not hesitate what course to take, but attaching\r\nhimself to the optimates,[220] he was appointed commander of a force\r\nto oppose Lepidus, who had already stirred up a large part of Italy\r\nand held with an army under the command of Brutus, Gaul within the\r\nAlps. Now Pompeius easily defeated the rest whom he attacked, but at\r\nMutina[221] in Gaul he sat down for some time opposite to Brutus,\r\nwhile Lepidus having hurried on to Rome and posted himself before the\r\nwalls was demanding a second consulship and terrifying the citizens\r\nwith a numerous army. But the alarm was ended by a letter from\r\nPompeius, who had brought the war to a fortunate issue without a\r\nbattle. For Brutus, whether it was that he gave up his force himself\r\nor was betrayed by his army changing sides, surrendered his person to\r\nPompeius and with some horsemen as an escort retired to one of the\r\nsmall towns near the Padus, where after the interval of a single day\r\nhe was put to death by Geminius, whom Pompeius sent to him; and\r\nPompeius was much blamed for this. For at the very commencement of the\r\naffair of the army changing sides, he wrote to the Senate that\r\nBrutus[222] had voluntarily surrendered, and he then sent another\r\nletter in which he criminated the man after he was put to death. This\r\nBrutus was the father of the Brutus who together with Cassius killed\r\nCæsar, a man who neither fought nor died like his father, as is told\r\nin his Life. As soon as Lepidus was driven from Italy, he made his\r\nescape into Sardinia, where he fell sick and died of vexation, not at\r\nthe state of affairs, as they say, but from finding some writing by\r\nwhich he discovered that his wife had committed adultery.\r\n\r\nXVII. But a general, Sertorius,[223] who in no respect resembled\r\nLepidus, was in possession of Iberia and was hovering over the other\r\nRomans, a formidable adversary; for the civil wars had concentrated\r\nthemselves as in a final disease in this one man, who had already\r\ndestroyed many of the inferior commanders, and was then engaged with\r\nMetellus Pius, who was indeed a distinguished soldier and of great\r\nmilitary ability, but owing to old age was considered to be following\r\nup the opportunities of war somewhat tardily, and was anticipated in\r\nhis plans by the quickness and rapidity of Sertorius, who attacked him\r\nat all hazards and somewhat in robber fashion, and by his ambuscades\r\nand circuitous movements confounded a man well practised in regular\r\nbattles and used to command a force of heavy-armed soldiers trained to\r\nclose fighting. Upon this Pompeius, who had an army under his command,\r\nbestirred himself to be sent out to support Metellus; and though\r\nCatulus ordered him to disband his force he would not obey, but kept\r\nunder arms in the neighbourhood of the city continually inventing\r\nexcuses, until the command was given to him on the proposal of Lucius\r\nPhilippus. It was on this occasion, as it is said, that some one in\r\nthe Senate asked Philippus with some surprise, if he thought that\r\nPompeius ought to be sent out as Proconsul,[224] and Philippus\r\nreplied, \"Not as Proconsul, as I think, but in place of the Consuls,\"\r\nmeaning that both the consuls of that year were good for nothing. I\r\n\r\nXVIII. When Pompeius arrived in Iberia, as it usually happens with the\r\nreputation of a new commander, he gave the people great hopes, and the\r\nnations which were not firmly attached to the party of Sertorius began\r\nto stir themselves and change sides; whereupon Sertorius gave vent to\r\narrogant expressions against Pompeius, and scoffingly said, he should\r\nonly need a cane and a whip for this youth, if he were not afraid of\r\nthat old woman, meaning Metellus. However he conducted his military\r\noperations with more caution, as in fact he kept a close watch on\r\nPompeius and was afraid of him. For contrary to what one would have\r\nexpected, Metellus had become very luxurious in his mode of life and\r\nhad completely given himself up to pleasure, and there had been all at\r\nonce a great change in him to habits of pride and extravagance, so\r\nthat this also brought Pompeius a surpassing good-will and reputation,\r\ninasmuch as he maintained a frugal mode of living, a thing that cost\r\nhim no great pains, for he was naturally temperate and well regulated\r\nin his desires. Though there were many vicissitudes in the war, the\r\ncapture of Lauron by Sertorius gave Pompeius most annoyance; for while\r\nhe supposed that Sertorius was surrounded, and had uttered certain\r\nboasting expressions, all at once it appeared that he himself was\r\ncompletely hemmed in, and as for this reason he was afraid to stir, he\r\nsaw the city burnt before his face. But he defeated, near Valentia,\r\nHerennius and Perpenna, who were men of military talent, and among\r\nothers had fled to Sertorius and served under him; and he slaughtered\r\nabove ten thousand of their men.\r\n\r\nXIX. Elated by this success, and full of great designs, he hastened\r\nto attack Sertorius himself, in order that Metellus might not share\r\nthe victory. They engaged on the banks of the Sucro, though it was\r\nnear the close of day, both parties fearing the arrival of Metellus,\r\none wishing to fight by himself, and the other wishing to have only\r\none opponent. The issue of the battle was doubtful, for one wing was\r\nvictorious on each side; but of the two commanders-in-chief Sertorius\r\ngot the more honour, for he put to flight the enemy who were opposed\r\nto him. A man of tall stature, an infantry soldier, attacked Pompeius,\r\nwho was on horseback; and as they closed and came to a struggle, the\r\nblows of the swords fell on the hands of both, but not with the same\r\neffect; for Pompeius was only wounded, but he cut off the man's hand.\r\nNow, as many men rushed upon Pompeius, and the rout had already begun,\r\nhe escaped, contrary to all expectation, by quitting his horse, which\r\nhad trappings of gold and decorations of great value; for while the\r\nenemy were dividing the booty and fighting about it with one another,\r\nthey were left behind in the pursuit. At daybreak both commanders\r\nagain placed their forces in order of battle, with the intention of\r\nsecuring the victory, but when Metellus approached, Sertorius\r\nretreated and his army dispersed. For the fashion of his men was to\r\ndisperse and again to come together, so that Sertorius often wandered\r\nabout alone, and often appeared again at the head of one hundred and\r\nfifty thousand men, like a winter-torrent suddenly swollen. Now, when\r\nPompeius went to meet Metellus after the battle, and they were near\r\none another, he ordered his lictors to lower their fasces out of\r\nrespect to Metellus as the superior in rank. But Metellus would not\r\nallow this, and in all other respects he behaved with consideration to\r\nPompeius, not assuming any superiority on the ground of being a\r\nconsular and the elder, except that when the two armies encamped\r\ntogether the watchword for both armies was given out by Metellus; but\r\nthe two armies generally encamped apart. For the enemy used to cut off\r\ntheir communications and separate them, being fertile in stratagems,\r\nand skilful in showing himself in many quarters in a short time, and\r\nin leading from one combat to another. Finally, by cutting off their\r\nsupplies, plundering the country, and getting the command of the sea,\r\nhe drove both Pompeius and Metellus from that part of Iberia which was\r\nunder him, and they were compelled to fly to other provinces through\r\nwant of provisions.\r\n\r\nXX. Pompeius having spent most of his own property and applied it to\r\nthe purposes of the war, demanded money of the senate, and said that\r\nhe would come to Italy with his army if they did not send it.\r\nLucullus, who was then consul, being at variance with Pompeius, and\r\nintriguing to get the command in the Mithridatic war for himself,\r\nbestirred himself to get money sent for fear of letting Pompeius have\r\na reason for leaving Sertorius, and attacking Mithridates, which he\r\nwished to do, for Mithridates was considered to be an opponent whom it\r\nwould be an honour to oppose and easy to vanquish. In the meantime,\r\nSertorius[225] was assassinated by his friends, of whom Perpenna was\r\nthe chief leader, and he attempted to do what Sertorius had done,\r\nhaving indeed the same troops and means, but not equal judgment for\r\nthe management of them. Now Pompeius immediately advanced against\r\nPerpenna, and perceiving that he was floundering in his affairs, he\r\nsent down ten cohorts into the plain, as a bait, and gave them orders\r\nto disperse as if they were flying. When Perpenna had attacked the\r\ncohorts, and was engaged in the pursuit, Pompeius appeared in full\r\nforce, and joining battle, gave the enemy a complete defeat. Most of\r\nthe officers fell in the battle; but Perpenna was brought to Pompeius,\r\nwho ordered him to be put to death, in which he did not show any\r\ningratitude, nor that he had forgotten what had happened in Sicily, as\r\nsome say, but he displayed great prudence and a judgment that was\r\nadvantageous to the commonweal. For Perpenna, who had got possession\r\nof the writings of Sertorins, offered to produce letters from the most\r\npowerful men in Rome, who being desirous to disturb the present\r\nsettlement and to change the constitution, invited Sertorius to Italy.\r\nNow Pompeius, apprehending that this might give rise to greater wars\r\nthan those which were just ended, put Perpenna to death, and burnt the\r\nletters without even reading them.\r\n\r\nXXI. After staying[226] long enough to extinguish the chief\r\ndisturbances, and to quiet and settle those affairs which were in the\r\nmost inflammatory state, he led his army back to Italy, and happened\r\nto arrive at the time when the servile war[227] was at its height.\r\nThis was the reason why Crassus the commander urged on the hazard of a\r\nbattle, which he gained, with the slaughter of twelve thousand three\r\nhundred of the enemy. Fortune, however, in a manner adopted Pompeius\r\ninto this success also, for five thousand men who escaped from the\r\nbattle fell in his way, all of whom he destroyed, and he took the\r\nopportunity of writing first to the senate, to say that Crassus indeed\r\nhad conquered the gladiators in a pitched battle, but he had pulled up\r\nthe war by the roots. And this was agreeable to the Romans to hear,\r\nowing to their good-will towards Pompeius, and also to speak of. As to\r\nIberia and Sertorius, no one even in jest would have said that the\r\nconquest was due to any one else than Pompeius. But though the man was\r\nin such repute, and such expectations were entertained of him, there\r\nwas still some suspicion and fear that he would not disband his army,\r\nbut would make his way by arms and sovereign power straight to the\r\npolity of Sulla. Accordingly, those who through fear ran to greet him\r\non the way, were as many as those who did it from good-will. But when\r\nPompeius had removed this suspicion also by declaring that he would\r\ndisband his army after the triumph, there still remained one subject\r\nof reproach for those who envied him, that he attached himself more\r\nto the people than to the senate, and that he had determined to\r\nrestore the authority of the tribunate, which Sulla had destroyed, and\r\nto court the favour of the many, which was true. For there was nothing\r\nfor which the people were more madly passionate, and nothing which\r\nthey more desired, than to see that magistracy again, so that Pompeius\r\nconsidered the opportunity for this political measure a great good\r\nfortune, as he could not have found any other favour by which to\r\nrequite the good-will of the citizens, if another had anticipated him\r\nin this.\r\n\r\nXXII. Now after a second triumph[228] and the consulship were voted to\r\nhim, Pompeius was not for this reason considered an object of\r\nadmiration and a great man; but the people considered it a proof of\r\nhis distinction, that Crassus, though the richest of all who were\r\nengaged in public life, and the most powerful speaker and the greatest\r\nman, and though he despised Pompeius and everybody else, did not\r\nventure to become a candidate for the consulship till he had applied\r\nto Pompeius. Pompeius indeed was well pleased with this, as he had\r\nlong wished to have the opportunity of doing some service and friendly\r\nact to Crassus. According he readily accepted the advances of Crassus,\r\nand in his address to the people he declared that he should be as\r\ngrateful to them for his colleague as for the consulship. However,\r\nwhen they were elected consuls, they differed about everything, and\r\ncame into collision: in the senate Crassus had more weight, but among\r\nthe people the influence of Pompeius was great. For Pompeius restored\r\nthe tribunate[229] to the people, and he allowed the judicia to be\r\nagain transferred to the Equites by a law. But the most agreeable of\r\nall spectacles was that which Pompeius exhibited to the people when he\r\npersonally solicited his discharge from service. It is the custom\r\namong the Roman Equites[230] when they have served the time fixed by\r\nlaw, to lead their horse into the Forum before the two men whom they\r\ncall Censors, and after mentioning each general and Imperator under\r\nwhom they have served, and giving an account of their service, they\r\nreceive their dismissal. Honours also and infamy are awarded according\r\nto each man's conduct. Now on this occasion the Censors Gellius and\r\nLentulus were sitting in all their official dignity, and the Equites\r\nwho were to be inspected were passing by, when Pompeius was seen\r\ndescending from the higher ground to the Forum, bearing the other\r\ninsignia of his office, but leading his horse by the hand. When he\r\ncame near and was full in sight, he bade the lictors make way for him,\r\nand he led his horse to the tribunal. The people admired, and kept\r\nprofound silence; the censors were both awed and delighted at the\r\nsight. Then the elder said: \"I ask you, Pompeius Magnus, if you have\r\nperformed all the military services that the law requires?\" Pompeius\r\nreplied with a loud voice, \"I have performed all, and all under my own\r\ncommand as Imperator.\" On hearing this the people broke out into loud\r\nshouts, and it was impossible to repress the acclamations, so great\r\nwas their delight; but the censors rising, conducted Pompeius home to\r\nplease the citizens, who followed with loud expressions of applause.\r\n\r\nXXIII. Now when the term of office was near expiring for Pompeius, and\r\nthe differences with Crassus wore increasing, one Caius\r\nAurelius,[231] who though a man of equestrian rank did not meddle with\r\npublic affairs, on the occasion of an assembly of the people ascended\r\nthe Rostra, and coming forward said, that Jupiter had appeared to him\r\nin his sleep and had bid him tell the consuls not to lay down their\r\noffice before they were reconciled. On this being said, Pompeius stood\r\nstill, without saying a word, but Crassus making the first advance to\r\ntake his hand and address him, said, \"I think I am doing nothing\r\nignoble or mean, fellow citizens, in being first to give way to\r\nPompeius, whom you considered worthy of the name of Magnus before he\r\nhad a beard, and decreed to him two triumphs before he was a senator.\"\r\nUpon this they were reconciled and laid down their office. Now Crassus\r\ncontinued the kind of life which he had originally adopted; but\r\nPompeius withdrew himself from his numerous engagements as advocate,\r\nand gradually quitted the forum, and seldom went into public, and\r\nalways with a large crowd of people. For it was no longer easy to meet\r\nwith him or see him without a train; but he took most pleasure in\r\nshowing himself with a numerous company close around him, and by these\r\nmeans he threw a dignity and importance about his presence, and\r\nthought that he ought to keep his high rank from contact or\r\nfamiliarity with the many. For life in the garment of peace is a\r\nhazardous thing towards loss of reputation for those who have gained\r\ndistinction in arms and are ill suited for civil equality; for such\r\nmen claim the first place in peace also, as in war, while those who\r\nget less honour in war cannot submit to have no advantage in peace at\r\nleast. Wherefore when they meet in the Forum with the man who has been\r\ndistinguished in camps and triumphs, they humble him and cast him\r\ndown; but if a man renounces all pretensions to civil distinction and\r\nwithdraws, they maintain his military honours and power untouched by\r\nenvy. Facts soon showed this.\r\n\r\nXXIV. Now the power of the pirates[232] had its beginning in Cilicia,\r\nand at first its adventure was attended with hazard and sought\r\nconcealment, but it gained confidence and daring in the Mithridatic\r\nwar by lending itself to aid the king. Then, the Romans being engaged\r\nin the civil wars about the gates of Rome, the sea was left destitute\r\nof all protection, and this by degrees drew them on, and encouraged\r\nthem not to confine their attacks to those who navigated the sea, but\r\nto ravage islands and maritime cities. And now men who were powerful\r\nby wealth and of distinguished birth, and who claimed superior\r\neducation, began to embark on board piratical vessels and to share in\r\ntheir undertakings as if the occupation was attended with a certain\r\nreputation and was an object of ambition. There were also piratical\r\nposts established in many places and fortified beacons, at which\r\narmaments put in, which were fitted out for this peculiar occupation\r\nnot only with bold vigorous crews and skilful helmsmen and the speed\r\nand lightness of the ships, but more annoying than their formidable\r\nappearance was their arrogant and pompous equipment, with their golden\r\nstreamers[233] and purple sails and silvered oars, as if they rioted\r\nin their evil practices and prided themselves on them. And flutes and\r\nplaying on stringed instruments and drinking along the whole coast,\r\nand capture of persons high in office, and ransomings of captured\r\ncities, were a disgrace to the Roman supremacy. Now the piratical\r\nships had increased to above a thousand, and the cities captured by\r\nthem were four hundred. They attacked and plundered the asyla and\r\nsacred places which had hitherto been unapproached, such as those of\r\nClaros,[234] Didyma, Samothrace, the temple of Chthonia in Hermione,\r\nthe temple of Æsculapius in Epidaurus, and those of Neptune at the\r\nIsthmus and Tænaros and Kalauria, and those of Apollo at Actium and\r\nLeucas, and that of Juno in Samos, and in Argos, and Lacinium. They\r\nalso performed strange rites on Olympus[235] and celebrated certain\r\nmysterious ceremonies, among which were those of Mithras[236] and they\r\nare continued to the present time, having been first introduced by\r\nthem. But they did most insult to the Romans, and going up from the\r\nsea they robbed on their roads and plundered the neighbouring villas.\r\nThey once seized two prætors Sextilius and Bellinus in their purple\r\ndress, and they carried off with them their attendants and lictors.\r\nThey also took the daughter of Antonius, a man who had enjoyed a\r\ntriumph, as she was going into the country, and she was ransomed at\r\ngreat cost. But their most insulting behaviour was in the following\r\nfashion. Whenever a man who was taken called out that he was a Roman\r\nand mentioned his name, they would pretend to be terror-struck and to\r\nbe alarmed, and would strike their thighs and fall down at his knees\r\npraying him to pardon them; and their captive would believe all this\r\nto be real, seeing that they were humble and suppliant. Then some\r\nwould put Roman shoes on his feet, and others would throw over him a\r\ntoga, pretending it was done that there might be no mistake about him\r\nagain. When they had for some time mocked the man in this way and had\r\ntheir fill of amusement, at last they would put a ladder down into the\r\nsea, and bid him step out and go away with their best wishes for a\r\ngood journey; and if a man would not go, then they shoved him into the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nXXV. The power of the pirates extended over the whole of our sea[237]\r\nat once in a measure, so that it could not be navigated and was closed\r\nagainst all trade. It was this which mainly induced the Romans, who\r\nwere hard pressed for provisions and were expecting great scarcity, to\r\nsend out Pompeius to clear the sea of the pirates. Gabinius,[238] one\r\nof the friends of Pompeius, drew up a law which gave Pompeius, not a\r\nnaval command, but palpably sole dominion and power over all men\r\nwithout any responsibility. For the law gave him authority over the\r\nsea within the columns of Hercules and all the main land to the\r\ndistance of four hundred stadia from the sea. There were not many\r\nplaces within the Roman dominions which lay beyond those limits, but\r\nthe chief nations and the most powerful of the kings were comprised\r\nwithin them. Besides this, Pompeius was empowered to choose fifteen\r\nlegati from the Senate who should command in particular parts, to take\r\nfrom the treasuries and from the Publicani as much money as he\r\npleased, and two hundred ships, with full authority as to the number\r\nand levying of the armed force and of the rowers for the vessels. When\r\nthese provisions of the law were read, the people received them with\r\nexceeding great satisfaction, but the chief of the Senate and the most\r\npowerful citizens considered that this unlimited and indefinite power\r\nwas indeed too great to be an object of envy, but was a matter for\r\nalarm. Accordingly with the exception of Cæsar they opposed the law;\r\nbut Cæsar spoke in favour of it, though indeed he cared very little\r\nfor Pompeius, but from the beginning it was his plan to insinuate\r\nhimself into the popular favour and to gain over the people. But the\r\nrest vehemently assailed Pompeius. One of the consuls who had observed\r\nto him that if he emulated Romulus he would not escape the end of\r\nRomulus, was near being killed by the people. When Catulus came\r\nforward to speak against the law, the people out of respect were\r\nsilent for some time; but after he had spoken at length with\r\nhonourable mention of Pompeius and without any invidious remark, and\r\nthen advised the people to spare him and not to expose such a man to\r\nrepeated dangers and wars, \"What other man,\" he continued, \"will you\r\nhave, if you lose him?\" when with one accord all the people replied,\r\n\"Yourself.\" Now as Catulus could produce no effect, he retired from\r\nthe Rostra; when Roscius[239] came forward, nobody listened, but he\r\nmade signs with his fingers that they should not appoint Pompeius to\r\nthe sole command, but should give him a colleague. At this it is said\r\nthat the people being irritated sent forth such a shout, that a\r\ncrow[240] which was flying over the Forum was stunned and fell down\r\ninto the crowd. Whence it appears, that birds which fall, do not\r\ntumble into a great vacuum in the air caused by its rending and\r\nseparation, but that they are struck by the blow of the voice, which,\r\nwhen it is carried along with great mass and strength, causes an\r\nagitation and a wave in the air.\r\n\r\nXXVI. Now for the time the assembly was dissolved. But on the day on\r\nwhich they were going to put the law to the vote, Pompeius privately\r\nretired to the country, but on hearing that the law had passed, he\r\nentered the city by night, considering that he should make himself an\r\nobject of jealousy if the people met him and crowded about him. At\r\ndaybreak he came into public and sacrificed; and an assembly being\r\nsummoned he contrived to get many other things in addition to what had\r\nbeen voted, and nearly doubled his armament. For he manned five\r\nhundred ships, and one hundred and twenty thousand heavy-armed\r\nsoldiers and five thousand horse were raised. He chose out of the\r\nsenate twenty-four men who had held command and served the office of\r\nprætor; and there were two quæstors. As the prices of provisions\r\nimmediately fell, it gave the people, who were well pleased to have\r\nit, opportunity to say that the very name of Pompeius had put an end\r\nto the war. However, by dividing the waters and the whole space of the\r\ninternal sea into thirteen parts and appointing a certain number of\r\nships and a commander for each, with his force, which was thus\r\ndispersed in all directions, he surrounded the piratical vessels that\r\nfell in his way in a body, and forthwith hunted them down and brought\r\nthem into port; but those who separated from one another before they\r\nwere taken and effected their escape, crowded from all parts and made\r\ntheir way to Cilicia as to a hive; and against them Pompeius himself\r\nwent with sixty of the best ships. But he did not sail against them\r\ntill he had completely cleared of the piratical vessels the Tyrrhenian\r\nsea, the Libyan, and the seas around Sardinia, and Corsica, and\r\nSicily, in forty days in all, by his own unwearied exertions and the\r\nactive co-operation of his commanders.\r\n\r\nXXVII. In Rome the consul Piso, through passion and envy, was damaging\r\nthe preparations for the war, and disbanding the seamen who were to\r\nman the ships, but Pompeius sent round his navy to Brundisium and\r\nhimself advanced through Tyrrhenia to Rome. On hearing this all the\r\npeople poured forth out of the city upon the road, just as if they had\r\nnot only a few days before conducted him out of the city. And the\r\nrejoicing was caused by the speediness of the change, which was\r\ncontrary to expectation, for the Forum had a superabundance of\r\nprovisions. The consequence was that Piso ran the risk of being\r\ndeprived of the consulship, for Gabinius had already a law drawn up.\r\nBut Pompeius prevented this, and having managed everything else with\r\nmoderation and got what he wanted, he went down to Brundisium and set\r\nsail. But though he was pressed by the urgency of the business and\r\nsailed past the cities in his haste, still he did not pass by Athens\r\nbut he went up to it. After sacrifices to the gods and addressing the\r\npeople, just as he was quitting the place he read two inscriptions,\r\neach of a single verse, addressed to him, the one within the gate,\r\n\r\n     \"As thou own'st thyself a mortal, so thou art in truth a God.\"\r\n\r\nand that on the outside:\r\n\r\n     \"Expected, welcomed, seen, we now conduct thee forth.\"\r\n\r\nNow as he treated mercifully some of the piratical crews which still\r\nheld together and were cruising about the seas upon their preferring\r\nentreaties to him, and after receiving a surrender of their vessels\r\nand persons did them no harm, the rest entertaining good hopes\r\nattempted to get out of the way of the other officers, and coming to\r\nPompeius they put themselves into his hands with their children and\r\nwives. But he spared all, and it was chiefly through their assistance\r\nthat he tracked out and caught[241] those who still lurked in\r\nconcealment, as being conscious that they had committed unpardonable\r\ncrimes.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. The greater part and the most powerful of the pirates had\r\ndeposited their families and wealth, and their useless people, in\r\ngarrisons and strong forts among the heights of the Taurus; but\r\nmanning their ships the pirates themselves awaited the approach of\r\nPompeius near Coracesium[242] in Cilicia, and a battle was fought in\r\nwhich they were defeated and afterwards blockaded. At last sending a\r\nsuppliant message they surrendered themselves and their cities and the\r\nislands of which they had possession and in which they had built forts\r\nthat were difficult to force and hard to approach. Accordingly the war\r\nwas ended, and all the pirates were driven from the sea in no more\r\nthan three months. Pompeius received by surrender many ships, and\r\namong them ninety with brazen beaks. The pirates, who amounted to more\r\nthan twenty thousand, he never thought of putting to death, but he\r\nconsidered that it would not be prudent to let them go and to allow\r\nthem to be dispersed or to unite again, being poor, and warlike and\r\nmany in number. Reflecting then that by nature man neither is made nor\r\nis a wild animal nor unsocial, and that he changes his character by\r\nthe practice of vice which is contrary to his nature, but that he is\r\ntamed by habits and change of place and life, and that wild beasts by\r\nbeing accustomed to a gentler mode of living put off their wildness\r\nand savageness, he determined to transfer the men to the land from the\r\nsea and to let them taste a quiet life by being accustomed to live in\r\ncities and to cultivate the ground. The small and somewhat depopulated\r\ncities of Cilicia received some of the pirates whom they associated\r\nwith themselves, and the cities received some additional tracts of\r\nland; and the city of Soli,[243] which had lately been deprived of its\r\ninhabitants by Tigranes[244] the Armenian king, he restored and\r\nsettled many of them in it. To the greater part he gave as their\r\nresidence Dyme[245] in Achæa, which was then without inhabitants and\r\nhad much good land.\r\n\r\nXXIX. Now those who envied Pompeius found fault with these measures;\r\nbut as to his conduct towards Metellus[246] in Crete, even his best\r\nfriends were not pleased with it. Metellus, who was a kinsman of the\r\nMetellus who had the command in Iberia jointly with Pompeius, was sent\r\nas commander to Crete before Pompeius was chosen. For Crete was a kind\r\nof second source of pirates and next to Cilicia; and Metellus having\r\ncaught many of them in the island took them prisoners and put them to\r\ndeath. Those who still survived and were blockaded, sent a suppliant\r\nmessage and invited Pompeius to the island, as being a part of his\r\ngovernment and falling entirely within the limits reckoned from the\r\ncoast. Pompeius accepted the invitation and wrote to Metellus to\r\nforbid him continuing the war. He also wrote to the cities not to pay\r\nany attention to Metellus, and he sent as commander one of his own\r\nofficers, Lucius Octavius, who entering into the forts of the besieged\r\npirates and fighting on their side made Pompeius not only odious and\r\nintolerable, but ridiculous also, inasmuch as he lent his name to\r\naccursed and godless men and threw around them his reputation as a\r\nkind of amulet, through envy and jealousy of Metellus. Neither did\r\nAchilles,[247] it was argued, act like a man, but like a youth all\r\nfull of violence and passionately pursuing glory, when he made a sign\r\nto the rest of the Greeks and would not let them strike Hector,\r\n\r\n    \"For fear another gave the blow and won\r\n    The fame, and he should second only come;\"\r\n\r\nbut Pompeius even protected and fought in behalf of the common enemy,\r\nthat he might deprive of a triumph a general who had endured so much\r\ntoil. Metellus however did not give in, but he took and punished the\r\npirates, and after insulting and abusing Octavius in his camp he let\r\nhim go.\r\n\r\nXXX. When news reached Rome that the Pirates' war was at an end and\r\nthat Pompeius being now at leisure was visiting the cities,\r\nManlius,[248] one of the tribunes, proposed a law, that Pompeius\r\nshould take all the country and force which Lucullus commanded, with\r\nthe addition of Bithynia, which Glabrio[249] had, and should carry on\r\nthe war against the kings Mithridates and Tigranes, with both the\r\nnaval force and the dominion of the sea on the terms on which he\r\nreceived it originally. This was in short for the Roman dominion to be\r\nplaced at the disposal of one man. For the provinces which alone he\r\ncould not touch under the former law, Phrygia, Lycaonia, Galatia,\r\nCappadocia, Cilicia, the upper Colchis, Armenia, these he now had\r\ntogether with the armies and resources with which Lucullus defeated\r\nMithridates and Tigranes. But though Lucullus was thus deprived of the\r\nglory of his achievements and was receiving a successor in a triumph\r\nrather than in a war, the aristocratical party thought less of this,\r\nthough they considered that the man was treated unjustly and\r\nungratefully, but they were much dissatisfied with the power of\r\nPompeius which they viewed as the setting up of a tyranny, and they\r\nseverally exhorted and encouraged one another to oppose the law and\r\nnot to give up their freedom. But when the time came, the rest kept\r\nback through fear of the people and were silent, except Catulus, who\r\nafter finding much fault with the law and the tribune, yet without\r\npersuading any one, urged the Senate from the Rostra, repeating it\r\nmany times, to seek for a mountain,[250] like their ancestors, and a\r\nrock, to which they might fly for refuge and preserve their liberty.\r\nAccordingly the law was ratified, as they say, by all the tribes[251]\r\nand Pompeius in his absence was put in possession of nearly\r\neverything which Sulla got after he had made himself master of the\r\ncity by arms and war. On receiving the letters and reading the decrees\r\nin the presence of his friends who were congratulating him, Pompeius\r\nis said to have contracted his eyebrows and to have struck his thigh,\r\nand to have spoken like a man who was already tired and averse to\r\ncommand, \"Oh, the endless toils, how much better it were to have been\r\none unknown to fame, if there shall never be an end to my military\r\nservice and I shall never elude this envy and live quietly in the\r\ncountry with my wife.\"[252] On hearing these expressions not even his\r\nintimate friends could endure his hypocritical pretences, as they knew\r\nthat he was the more delighted, inasmuch as his difference with\r\nLucullus gave additional fire to his innate ambition and love of\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nXXXI. And in truth his acts soon discovered his real temper: for he\r\nissued counter-edicts in all directions by which he required the\r\npresence of the soldiers and summoned to him the subject rulers and\r\nkings. And as he traversed the country, he let nothing that Lucullus\r\nhad done remain undisturbed, but he both remitted the punishments of\r\nmany, and took away what had been given, and in short he left nothing\r\nundone in his eagerness to prove to the admirers of Lucullus[253] that\r\nhe was entirely without power. Lucullus through his friends complained\r\nto Pompeius, and it was agreed that they should have a meeting. They\r\nmet in Galatia: and as they were most distinguished generals and had\r\nwon the greatest victories, their lictors met with the fasces wreathed\r\nwith bay; but Lucullus advanced from green and shady parts, and\r\nPompeius happened to have crossed an extensive tract without trees and\r\nparched. Accordingly the lictors of Lucullus seeing that the bays of\r\nPompeius were faded and completely withered, gave them some of their\r\nown which were fresh, and so decorated and wreathed the fasces of\r\nPompeius with them. This was considered a sign that Pompeius was\r\ncoming to carry off the prizes of victory and the glory that was due\r\nto Lucullus. As to the order of his consulship and in age also\r\nLucullus had the priority, but the reputation of Pompeius was more\r\nexalted on account of his two triumphs. However they managed their\r\nfirst interview with as much civility and friendliness as they could,\r\nmagnifying the exploits of each other, and congratulating one another\r\non their victories: in their conferences however they came to no\r\nreasonable or fair settlement, but even fell to mutual abuse, Pompeius\r\ncharging Lucullus with avarice, and Lucullus charging Pompeius with\r\nlove of power; and they were with difficulty separated by their\r\nfriends. Lucullus being in Galatia assigned portions of the captured\r\nland and gave other presents to whom he chose; while Pompeius, who was\r\nencamped at a short distance, prevented any attention being paid to\r\nthe orders of Lucullus, and took from him all his soldiers except\r\nsixteen hundred, whose mutinous disposition he thought would make them\r\nuseless to himself, but hostile to Lucullus. Besides this, Pompeius\r\ndisparaged the exploits of Lucullus and openly said that Lucullus had\r\nwarred against tragedies and mere shadows of kings, while to himself\r\nwas reserved the contest against a genuine power and one that had\r\ngrown wiser by losses, for Mithridates was now having recourse to\r\nshields, and swords and horses. Lucullus retorting said, that Pompeius\r\nwas going to fight with a phantom and a shadow of war, being\r\naccustomed, like a lazy bird, to descend upon the bodies that others\r\nhad slaughtered and to tear the remnants of wars; for so had he\r\nappropriated to himself the victories over Sertorius, Lepidus and\r\nSpartacus, though Crassus, Metellus and Catulus had respectively\r\ngained these victories: it was no wonder then, if Pompeius was\r\nsurreptitiously trying to get the credit of the Armenian and Pontic\r\nwars, he who had in some way or other contrived to intrude himself\r\ninto a triumph over runaway slaves.\r\n\r\nXXXII. Lucullus[254] now retired, and Pompeius after distributing his\r\nwhole naval force over the sea between Phœnicia and the Bosporus to\r\nkeep guard, himself marched against Mithridates, who had thirty\r\nthousand foot soldiers of the phalanx and two thousand horsemen, but\r\ndid not venture to fight. First of all, Mithridates left a strong\r\nmountain which was difficult to assault, whereon he happened to be\r\nencamped, because he supposed there was no water there; but Pompeius,\r\nafter occupying the same mountain, conjectured from the nature of the\r\nvegetation upon it and the hollows formed by the slopes of the ground\r\nthat the place contained springs, and he ordered wells to be dug in\r\nall parts: and immediately the whole army had abundance of water, so\r\nthat it was a matter of surprise that Mithridates had all along been\r\nignorant of this. Pompeius then surrounded Mithridates with his troops\r\nand hemmed him in with his lines. After being blockaded forty-five\r\ndays Mithridates succeeded in stealing away with the strongest part of\r\nhis army, after having first massacred those who were unfit for\r\nservice and were sick. Next, Pompeius overtook him on the Euphrates\r\nand pitched his camp near him; and fearing lest Mithridates should\r\nfrustrate his design by crossing the river, he led his army against\r\nhim in battle order at midnight, at which very hour it is said that\r\nMithridates had a vision in his sleep which forewarned him of what was\r\ngoing to happen. He dreamed that he was sailing on the Pontic sea with\r\na fair wind, and was already in sight of the Bosporus, and\r\ncongratulating his fellow voyagers, as a man naturally would do in his\r\njoy at a manifest and sure deliverance; but all at once he saw himself\r\nabandoned by everybody and drifting about upon a small piece of wreck.\r\nWhile he was suffering under this anguish and these visions, his\r\nfriends came to his bed-side and roused him with the news that\r\nPompeius was attacking them. The enemy accordingly must of necessity\r\nfight in defence of their camp, and the generals leading their forces\r\nout put them in order of battle. Pompeius, seeing the preparations to\r\noppose him, hesitated about running any risk in the dark, and thought\r\nthat he ought only to surround the enemy, to prevent their escape, and\r\nattack them when it was daylight, inasmuch as their numbers were\r\ngreater. But the oldest centurions by their entreaties and\r\nexhortations urged him on; for it was not quite dark, but the moon\r\nwhich was descending in the horizon still allowed them to see objects\r\nclear enough. And it was this which most damaged the king's troops.\r\nFor the Romans advanced with the moon on their backs, and as the light\r\nwas much depressed towards the horizon, the shadows were projected a\r\nlong way in front of the soldiers and fell upon the enemy, by reason\r\nof which they could not accurately estimate the distance between them\r\nand the Romans, but supposing that they were already at close quarters\r\nthey threw their javelins without effect and struck nobody. The Romans\r\nperceiving this rushed upon the enemy with shouts, and as they did not\r\nventure to stand their ground, but were terror-struck and took to\r\nflight, the Romans slaughtered them to the number of much more than\r\nten thousand, and took their camp. Mithridates at the commencement\r\nwith eight hundred horsemen cut his way through the Romans, but the\r\nrest were soon dispersed and he was left alone with three persons, one\r\nof whom was his concubine Hypsikratia,[255] who on all occasions\r\nshowed the spirit of a man and desperate courage; and accordingly the\r\nking used to call her Hypsikrates. On this occasion, armed like a\r\nPersian and mounted on horseback, she was neither exhausted by the\r\nlong journeys nor ever wearied of attending to the King's person and\r\nhis horse, till they came to a place called Inora,[256] which was\r\nfilled with the King's property and valuables. Here Mithridates took\r\ncostly garments and distributed among those who had flocked to him\r\nafter the battle. He also gave to each of his friends a deadly poison\r\nto carry about with them, that none of them might fall into the hands\r\nof the Romans against his will. Thence he set out towards Armenia to\r\nTigranes, but Tigranes forbade him to come and set a price of a\r\nhundred talents upon him, on which Mithridates passed by the sources\r\nof the Euphrates and continued his flight through Colchis.[257]\r\nXXXIII. Pompeius invaded Armenia at the invitation of young\r\nTigranes,[258] who had now revolted from his father, and he met\r\nPompeius near the river Araxes,[259] which rises in the same parts\r\nwith the Euphrates, but turns to the east and enters the Caspian Sea.\r\nPompeius and Tigranes received the submission of the cities as they\r\nadvanced: but King Tigranes, who had been lately crushed by Lucullus,\r\nand heard that Pompeius was of a mild and gentle disposition, admitted\r\na Roman garrison into his palace,[260] and taking with him his friends\r\nand kinsmen advanced to surrender himself. As he approached the camp\r\non horseback, two lictors of Pompeius came up to him and ordered him\r\nto dismount from his horse and to enter on foot: they told him that no\r\nman on horseback had ever been seen in a Roman camp. Tigranes obeyed\r\ntheir orders, and taking off his sword presented it to them; and\r\nfinally, when Pompeius came towards him, pulling off his\r\ncittaris,[261] he hastened to lay it before his feet, and what was\r\nmost humiliating of all, to throw himself down at his knees. But\r\nPompeius prevented this by laying hold of his right hand and drawing\r\nthe king towards him; he also seated Tigranes by his side, and his son\r\non the other side, and said that Tigranes ought so far to blame\r\nLucullus only, who had taken from him Syria, Phœnicia, Cilicia,\r\nGalatia, and Sophene,[262] but that what he had kept up to that time,\r\nhe should still have, if he paid as a compensation to the Romans for\r\nhis wrongful deeds six thousand talents, and his son should be King of\r\nSophene. Tigranes assented to these terms, and being overjoyed by the\r\nRomans saluting him as king, he promised to give every soldier half a\r\nmina of silver,[263] to a centurion ten minæ, and to a tribune a\r\ntalent. But his son took this ill, and on being invited to supper he\r\nsaid that he was not in want of Pompeius to show such honour as this,\r\nfor he would find another Roman.[264] In consequence of this he was\r\nput in chains and kept for the triumph. No long time after Phraates\r\nthe Parthian sent to demand the young man, as his son-in-law, and to\r\npropose that the Euphrates should be the boundary of the two powers.\r\nPompeius replied that Tigranes belonged to his father rather than to\r\nhis father-in-law, and that as to a boundary he should determine that\r\non the principles of justice.\r\n\r\nXXXIV. Leaving Afranius in care of Armenia, Pompeius advanced through\r\nthe nations that dwell about the Caucasus,[265] as of necessity he\r\nmust do, in pursuit of Mithridates. The greatest of these nations are\r\nAlbani and Iberians, of whom the Iberians extend to the Moschic\r\nmountains and the Pontus, and the Albani extend to the east and the\r\nCaspian Sea. The Albani at first allowed a free passage to Pompeius at\r\nhis request; but as winter overtook the Romans in the country and they\r\nwere occupied with the festival of the Saturnalia,[266] mustering to\r\nthe number of forty thousand they attacked the Romans, after crossing\r\nthe Cyrnus[267] river, which rising in the Iberian mountains and\r\nreceiving the Araxes which comes down from Armenia, empties itself by\r\ntwelve mouths into the Caspian. Others say that the Araxes does not\r\njoin this stream, but that it has a separate outlet, though near to\r\nthe other, into the same sea. Pompeius, though he could have opposed\r\nthe enemy while they were crossing the river, let them cross quietly,\r\nand then he attacked and put them to flight and destroyed a great\r\nnumber. As the King begged for pardon, and sent ambassadors, Pompeius\r\nexcused him for the wrong that he had done, and making a treaty with\r\nhim, advanced against the Iberians, who were as numerous as the Albani\r\nand more warlike, and had a strong wish to please Mithridates and to\r\nrepel Pompeius. For the Iberians had never submitted either to the\r\nMedes or the Persians,[268] and they had escaped the dominion of the\r\nMacedonians also, inasmuch as Alexander soon quitted Hyrkania. However\r\nPompeius routed the Iberians also in a great battle, in which nine\r\nthousand of them were killed and above ten thousand taken prisoners,\r\nand he entered Colchis; and on the Phasis[269] he was met by Servilius\r\nwith the vessels with which he was guarding the Pontus.\r\n\r\nXXXV. The pursuit of Mithridates was attended with great difficulties,\r\nas he had plunged among the nations around the Bosporus and the\r\nMæotis; and intelligence reached Pompeius that the Albani had again\r\nrevolted. Moved by passion and desire of revenge, Pompeius turned\r\nagainst the Albani. He again crossed the Cyrnus with difficulty and\r\ndanger, for the river had been fenced off with stakes to a great\r\nextent by the barbarians; and as the passage of the river was\r\nsucceeded by a long waterless and difficult march, he had ten thousand\r\nskins filled with water and then advanced against the enemy, whom he\r\nfound posted on the river Abas[270] to the number of sixty thousand\r\nfoot and twelve thousand cavalry, but poorly armed, and for the most\r\npart only with the skins of beasts. They were commanded by a brother\r\nof the king, named Kosis, who, when the two armies had come to close\r\nquarters, rushed against Pompeius and struck him with a javelin on the\r\nfold[271] of his breastplate, but Pompeius with his javelin in his\r\nhand pierced him through and killed him. In this battle it is said\r\nthat Amazons[272] also fought on the side of the barbarians, and that\r\nthey had come down hither from the mountains about the river\r\nThermodon. For after the battle, when the Romans were stripping the\r\nbarbarians, they found Amazonian shields and boots, but no body of a\r\nwoman was seen. The Amazons inhabit those parts of the Caucasus which\r\nextend towards the Hyrcanian sea, but they do not border on the\r\nAlbani, for Gelæ and Leges dwell between; and they cohabit with these\r\npeople every year for two months, meeting them on the river Thermodon,\r\nafter which they depart and live by themselves.\r\n\r\nXXXVI. After the battle Pompeius set out to advance to the\r\nHyrkanian[273] and Caspian sea, but he was turned from his route by\r\nthe number of deadly reptiles, when he was three days' march from it.\r\nHe retired to the Less Armenia; and he returned a friendly answer to\r\nthe Kings of the Elymæi[274] and Medes who sent ambassadors, but\r\nagainst the Parthian king who had invaded Gordyene and was plundering\r\nthe people of Tigranes, he sent Afranius with a force who drove him\r\nout and pursued him as far as the territory of Arbela. Of all the\r\nconcubines of Mithridates who were brought to him, he knew not one,\r\nbut sent all back to their parents and kin; for the greater part were\r\nthe daughters and wives of generals and princes. Stratonike,[275] who\r\nwas in the greatest repute and guarded the richest of the forts, was,\r\nit is said, the daughter of a harp-player, who was not rich and was an\r\nold man; and she made so sudden a conquest of Mithridates over his\r\nwine by her playing, that he kept the woman and went to bed with her,\r\nbut sent away the old man much annoyed at not having been even civilly\r\nspoken to by the king. In the morning, however, when he got up and saw\r\nin his house tables loaded with silver and golden cups, and a great\r\ntrain of attendants, with eunuchs and boys bringing to him costly\r\ngarments, and a horse standing before the door equipped like those\r\nthat carried the king's friends, thinking that this was all mockery\r\nand a joke he made an attempt to escape through the door. But when the\r\nslaves laid hold of him and told him that the king had made him a\r\npresent of the large substance of a rich man who had just died, and\r\nthat this was but a small foretaste and sample of other valuables and\r\npossessions that were to come, after this explanation hardly convinced\r\nhe took the purple dress, and leaping on the horse rode through the\r\ncity exclaiming, \"All this is mine.\" To those who laughed at him he\r\nsaid, this was nothing strange, but it was rather strange that he did\r\nnot pelt with stones those who came in his way, being mad with\r\ndelight. Of this stock and blood was Stratonike. But she gave up this\r\nplace to Pompeius, and also brought him many presents, of which he\r\ntook only such as seemed suitable to decorate the temples and add\r\nsplendour to his triumph, and he told her she was welcome to keep the\r\nrest. In like manner when the King of the Iberians sent him a couch\r\nand a table and a seat all of gold, and begged him to accept them, he\r\ndelivered them also to the quæstors for the treasury.\r\n\r\nXXXVII. In the fort Kænum[276] Pompeius found also private writings\r\nof Mithridates, which he read through with some pleasure as they gave\r\nhim a good opportunity of learning the man's character. They were\r\nmemoirs,[277] from which it was discovered that he had taken off by\r\npoison[278] among many others his son Ariarathes and Alkæus of Sardis\r\nbecause he got the advantage over the King in riding racehorses. There\r\nwere registered also interpretations of dreams,[279] some of which he\r\nhad seen himself, and others had been seen by some of his women; and\r\nthere were lewd letters of Monime[280] to him and his answers to her.\r\nTheophanes says that there was also found an address of Rutilius[281]\r\nin which he urged the King to the massacre of the Romans in Asia. But\r\nmost persons with good reason suppose this to be a malicious story of\r\nTheophanes, perhaps invented through hatred to Rutilius, who was a\r\nman totally unlike himself, or perchance to please Pompeius, whose\r\nfather Rutilius in his historical writings had shown to be a\r\nthoroughly unprincipled fellow.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. Thence Pompeius went to Amisus,[282] where his ambition led\r\nhim to reprehensible measures. For though he had abused Lucullus\r\ngreatly, because while the enemy was still alive, he published edicts\r\nfor the settlement of the countries and distributed gifts and honours,\r\nthings which victors are accustomed to do when a war is brought to a\r\nclose and is ended, he himself, while Mithridates was still ruling in\r\nthe Bosporus[283] and had got together a force sufficient to enable\r\nhim to take the field again, just as if everything was finished, began\r\nto do the very things that Lucullus had done, settling the provinces,\r\nand distributing gifts, many commanders and princes, and twelve\r\nbarbarous kings having come to him. Accordingly he did not even deign\r\nwhen writing in reply to the Parthian,[284] as other persons did, to\r\naddress him by the title of King of Kings, and he neglected to do this\r\nto please the other kings. He was also seized with a desire and a\r\npassion to get possession of Syria and to advance through Arabia to\r\nthe Erythræan sea,[285] that in his victorious career he might reach\r\nthe ocean that encompasses the world on all sides; for in Libya he was\r\nthe first who advanced victoriously as far as the external sea, and\r\nagain in Iberia he made the Atlantic sea the boundary of the Roman\r\ndominion; and thirdly, in his recent pursuit of the Albani he came\r\nvery near to reaching the Hyrkanian sea. Accordingly he now put his\r\narmy in motion that he might connect the circuit of his military\r\nexpeditions with the Erythræan sea; and besides, he saw that\r\nMithridates was difficult to be caught by an armed force, and was a\r\nharder enemy to deal with when flying than when fighting.\r\n\r\nXXXIX. Wherefore, remarking that he would leave behind him for\r\nMithridates an enemy stronger than himself, famine, he set vessels to\r\nkeep a guard on the merchants who sailed to the Bosporus; and death\r\nwas the penalty for those who were caught. Taking the great bulk of\r\nhis army he advanced on his march, and falling in with the bodies\r\nstill unburied of those who with Triarius[286] had fought\r\nunsuccessfully against Mithridates and fallen in battle, he buried all\r\nwith splendid ceremonial and due honours. It was the neglect of this\r\nwhich is considered to have been the chief cause of the hatred to\r\nLucullus. After subduing by his legate Afranius the Arabs in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Amanus,[287] he descended into Syria, which he\r\nmade a province and a possession of the Roman people on the ground\r\nthat it had no legitimate kings; and he subdued Judæa[288] and took\r\nKing Aristobulus prisoner. He built some cities, and he gave others\r\ntheir liberty and punished the tyrants in them. But he spent most time\r\nin judicial business, settling the disputes of cities and kings, and\r\nin those cases for which he had no leisure, sending his friends; as\r\nfor instance to the Armenians and Parthians, who referred to him the\r\ndecision as to the country[289] in dispute between them, he sent three\r\njudges and conciliators. For great was the fame of his power, and no\r\nless was the fame of his virtue and mildness; by reason of which he\r\nwas enabled to veil most of the faults of his friends and intimates,\r\nfor he did not possess the art of checking or punishing evil doers,\r\nbut he so behaved towards those who had anything to do with him, that\r\nthey patiently endured both the extortion and oppression of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nXL. The person who had most influence with Pompeius was Demetrius, a\r\nfreedman, a youth not without understanding, but who abused his good\r\nfortune. The following story is told of him. Cato the philosopher, who\r\nwas still a young man, but had a great reputation and already showed a\r\nlofty spirit, went up to Antioch,[290] when Pompeius was not there,\r\nwishing to examine the city. Now Cato, as was his custom, walked on\r\nfoot, but his friends who were journeying with him were on horseback.\r\nObserving before the gate a crowd of men in white vestments, and along\r\nthe road, on one side the ephebi, and on the other the boys, in\r\nseparate bodies, he was out of humour, supposing that this was done\r\nout of honour and respect to him who wanted nothing of the kind.\r\nHowever he bade his friends dismount and walk with him. As they came\r\nnear, the man who was arranging and settling all this ceremony, with a\r\ncrown on his head and a wand in his hand, met them and asked where\r\nthey had left Demetrius and when he would arrive. Now the friends of\r\nCato fell a-laughing, but Cato exclaimed, \"O wretched city,\" and\r\npassed by without making further answer. However Pompeius himself made\r\nDemetrius less an object of odium to others by submitting to his\r\ncaprices without complaint. For it is said that frequently when\r\nPompeius at entertainments was waiting for and receiving his guests,\r\nDemetrius would already have taken his place at the table, reclining\r\nwith haughty air, and with his vest[291] over his ears hanging down.\r\nBefore he had returned to Rome, Demetrius had got possession of the\r\nmost agreeable places in the suburbs, and the finest pleasure-grounds\r\nand costly gardens were called Demetrian; and yet up to his third\r\ntriumph Pompeius was lodged in a moderate and simple manner. But\r\nafterwards when he was erecting for the Romans that beautiful and\r\nfar-famed theatre,[292] he built, what may be compared to the small\r\nboat that is towed after a big vessel, close by a house more\r\nmagnificent than he had before; and yet even this was so far from\r\nbeing such a building as to excite any jealousy that the person who\r\nbecame the owner of it after Pompeius, was surprised when he entered\r\nit, and he asked where Pompeius Magnus used to sup. Such is the story\r\nabout these matters.\r\n\r\nXLI. The King of the Arabians in the neighbourhood of Petra[293]\r\nhitherto had not troubled himself at all about the Romans, but now\r\nbeing much alarmed he wrote to say that he was ready to submit and to\r\ndo anything. Pompeius wishing to confirm him in this disposition made\r\nan expedition against Petra, wherein he did not altogether escape\r\ncensure from most people. For they considered that this was evading\r\nthe pursuit of Mithridates, and they urged him to turn against him who\r\nwas his old antagonist and was fanning his flame and preparing\r\naccording to report to lead an army through the country of the\r\nScythians and Pæonians[294] against Italy. But Pompeius thinking it\r\nwould be easier to crush the forces of Mithridates in the field than\r\nto overtake him when he was flying, did not choose to exhaust himself\r\nto no purpose in a pursuit, and he contrived to find other occupations\r\nin the interval of the war and he protracted the time. Fortune,\r\nhowever, settled the difficulty; for when he was at no great distance\r\nfrom Petra, and had already pitched his camp for that day and was\r\nexercising himself with his horse around the camp, letter-bearers rode\r\nup from Pontus with good tidings. This was manifest at once by the\r\npoints of their spears, for they were wreathed with bay. Pompeius at\r\nfirst wished to finish his exercises, but as the men called out and\r\nentreated him, he leapt from his horse and taking the letters advanced\r\ninto the camp. But as there was no tribunal[295] and there had not\r\nbeen time to make even the kind of tribunal that is used in the camp,\r\nwhich they are accustomed to form by digging out large lumps of earth\r\nand putting them together upon one another, in their then zeal and\r\neagerness they piled together the loadings of the beasts of burden and\r\nraised an elevated place. Pompeius ascending this announced to the\r\nsoldiers, that Mithridates was dead, having put an end to his own life\r\nbecause his son Pharnakes[296] rebelled against him, and Pharnakes had\r\ntaken possession of everything in those parts, and put all under his\r\nown dominion and that of the Romans, as he said in his letter.\r\n\r\nXLII. Upon this the soldiers being delighted, as was natural, occupied\r\nthemselves with sacrifices and entertainments, considering that in the\r\nperson of Mithridates ten thousand enemies had expired. Pompeius\r\nhaving brought his own undertakings and expeditions to a termination,\r\nwhich he had not anticipated could be so easily done, immediately\r\nretired from Arabia; and quickly traversing the intermediate provinces\r\nhe arrived at Amisus, where he found that many presents had been sent\r\nby Pharnakes and many corpses of members of the royal family, and the\r\ncorpse of Mithridates also, which could not well be recognised by the\r\nface (for those who had embalmed the body had neglected to destroy the\r\nbrain); but those who wished to see the body, recognised it by the\r\nscars. Pompeius himself would not see the body, but fearing divine\r\nretribution[297] he sent it off to Sinope.[298] He was amazed at the\r\ndress and armour of Mithridates, both at the size and splendour of\r\nwhat he saw; though the sword belt, which cost four hundred talents,\r\nPublius stole and sold to Ariarathes, and the cittaris, a piece of\r\nwonderful workmanship, Gaius the foster-brother of Mithridates himself\r\ngave to Faustus the son of Sulla who asked for it. Pompeius did not\r\nknow this at the time; but Pharnakes who afterwards discovered it\r\npunished the thieves. After Pompeius had arranged and settled affairs\r\nin those parts, he continued his march with more pomp. On arriving at\r\nMitylene[299] he gave the city its freedom for the sake of Theophanes,\r\nand he witnessed the usual contest there among the poets, the sole\r\nsubject being his own exploits. Being pleased with the theatre he had\r\na sketch taken of it and a plan made, with the intention of making one\r\nlike it in Rome, but larger and more splendid. When he was in Rhodes,\r\nhe heard all the sophists and made each a present of a talent.\r\nPoseidonius[300] put in writing the discourse which he read before\r\nPompeius in opposition to the rhetorician Hermagoras on the doctrine\r\nof general invention. In Athens Pompeius behaved in like manner to the\r\nphilosophers, and after giving also to the city fifty talents towards\r\nits restoration, he was in hopes to set foot in Italy with a\r\nreputation above that of any man and to be received by his family with\r\nthe same eagerness that he had to see them. But the Dæmon[301] who\r\ntakes care always to mix some portion of ill with the great and\r\nglorious good things which come from Fortune, had long been lurking on\r\nthe watch and preparing to make his return more painful to him. For\r\nduring the absence of Pompeius his wife Mucia[302] had been\r\nincontinent. Indeed while Pompeius was at a distance he treated the\r\nreport with contempt, but when he had come near to Italy, and had\r\nexamined the charge with more deliberation, as it seems, he sent her\r\nnotice of divorce, though neither then nor afterwards did he say for\r\nwhat reason he put her away: but the reason is mentioned in Cicero's\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nXLIII. All kinds of reports about Pompeius preceded his arrival at\r\nRome, and there was great alarm, as it was supposed that he would\r\nforthwith lead his army against the city and that a monarchy[303]\r\nwould be firmly established. Crassus taking his sons and his money\r\nsecretly got away from Rome, whether it was that he really was afraid,\r\nor, what is more probable, he wished to give credibility to the\r\ncalumny and to strengthen the odium against Pompeius. As soon,\r\nhowever, as Pompeius landed[304] in Italy, he summoned his soldiers to\r\nan assembly,and after saying what was suitable to the occasion and\r\nexpressing his affectionate thanks to them, he bade them disperse\r\namong their several cities and each go to his home, remembering to\r\nmeet again for his triumph. The army being thus dispersed, and the\r\nfact being generally known, a wonderful circumstance happened. For the\r\ncities seeing Pompeius Magnus unarmed and advancing with a few\r\nfriends, as if he were returning from an ordinary journey, pouring\r\nforth through good will and forming an escort brought him into Rome\r\nwith a larger force, so that if he had designed to make any change and\r\nrevolution at that time he would not have wanted the army which he had\r\ndisbanded.\r\n\r\nXLIV. As the law did not allow a general to enter the city before his\r\ntriumph, Pompeius sent to the Senate to request they would put off the\r\nconsular elections and to grant him this favour, that he might in his\r\nown person assist Piso in his canvass. As Cato opposed his request, he\r\ndid not attain his object. But Pompeius admiring Cato's boldness of\r\nspeech and the vigour which he alone openly displayed in behalf of the\r\nlaw, desired in some way or other to gain the man; and as Cato had two\r\nnieces, Pompeius wished to take one of them to wife and to marry the\r\nother to his son. Cato saw his object, which he viewed as a way of\r\ncorrupting him and in a manner bribing him by a matrimonial alliance;\r\nbut his sister and wife took it ill that he should reject an alliance\r\nwith Pompeius Magnus. In the mean time Pompeius wishing to get\r\nAfranius[305] made consul, expended money on his behalf among the\r\ntribes, and the voters came down to the gardens of Pompeius where they\r\nreceived the money, so that the thing became notorious and Pompeius\r\nhad an ill name for making that office which was the highest of all\r\nand which he obtained for his services, venal for those who were\r\nunable to attain to it by merit. \"These reproaches however,\" said Cato\r\nto the women, \"we must take our share of, if we become allied to\r\nPompeius.\" On hearing this the women agreed that he formed a better\r\njudgment than themselves as to what was proper.\r\n\r\nXLV. Though the triumph[306] was distributed over two days, such was\r\nits magnitude that the time was not sufficient, but much of the\r\npreparation was excluded from the spectacle, and enough for the\r\nsplendour and ornament of another procession. The nations over which\r\nPompeius triumphed were designated by titles placed in front. The\r\nnations were the following, Pontus, Armenia, Cappadocia, Paphlagonia,\r\nMedia, Colchis, the Iberians, Albani, Syria, Cilicia, Mesopotamia, the\r\nparts about Phœnice and Palestine, Judæa, Arabia, and the whole body\r\nof pirates by sea and land who had been subdued. Among these nations\r\nfortified places not fewer than a thousand were taken, and cities not\r\nfar short of nine hundred, and eight hundred piratical ships; and\r\ncities forty save one were founded. Besides this it was shown on\r\nwritten tablets that 5000 myriads (fifty millions) were the produce of\r\nthe taxes, while from the additions that he had made to the state they\r\nreceived 8500 myriads (eighty-five millions), and there were brought\r\ninto the public treasury in coined money and vessels of gold and\r\nsilver twenty thousand talents, not including what had been given to\r\nthe soldiers, of whom he who received the least according to his\r\nproportion received fifteen hundred drachmæ. The captives who appeared\r\nin the procession, besides the chief pirates, were the son of Tigranes\r\nthe Armenian with his wife and daughter, and Zosime a wife of King\r\nTigranes, and Aristobulus King of the Jews, and a wife and five\r\nchildren of Mithridates, and Scythian women, and also hostages of the\r\nAlbani and Iberians and of the King of Commagene, and numerous\r\ntrophies, equal in number to all the battles, which Pompeius had won\r\nhimself or by his legati. But it was the chief thing towards his\r\nglory, and what had never happened before to any Roman, that he\r\ncelebrated his third triumph over the third continent. For though\r\nothers before him had triumphed three times, Pompeius by having gained\r\nhis first triumph over Libya, his second over Europe, and this the\r\nlast over Asia, seemed in a manner to have brought the whole world\r\ninto his three triumphs.\r\n\r\nXLVI. At this time Pompeius was under four-and-thirty[307] years of\r\nage, as those affirm who in all respects compare him with Alexander\r\nand force a parallel, but in fact he was near forty. How happy would\r\nit have been if he had died at the time up to which he had the fortune\r\nof Alexander; but the period that followed brought to him good fortune\r\naccompanied with odium, and ill fortune that was past all cure. For\r\nthe power which he got in the city by fair means, he employed on the\r\nbehalf of others illegally; and as much strength as he gave to them,\r\nso much he took from his own reputation, and so he was overthrown by\r\nthe strength and magnitude of his own power before he was aware of it.\r\nAnd as the strongest parts and places in cities, when the enemies have\r\ngot possession of them, give to them their own strength, so Cæsar\r\nbeing raised up through the power of Pompeius against the State,\r\noverthrew and cast down the man by whose help he became strong against\r\nothers. And it was brought about thus. Immediately upon Lucullus\r\nreturning from Asia, where he had been treated with great contumely by\r\nPompeius, the Senate gave him a splendid reception, and when Pompeius\r\nhad arrived they urged Lucullus still more to take a part in public\r\naffairs, for the purpose of limiting the credit of Pompeius. Though\r\nLucullus was in other matters now dull and chilled for all active\r\nlife, having given himself up to the pleasures of ease and the\r\nenjoyment of wealth, yet he forthwith sprang up against Pompeius, and\r\nby a vigorous attack got a victory over him with respect to the\r\narrangements of Lucullus that he had annulled, and had the advantage\r\nin the Senate with the co-operation of Cato. Pompeius, defeated and\r\npressed on all sides, was compelled to fly to tribunes and to attach\r\nhimself to young men, of whom the most scandalous and the most daring,\r\nClodius, took up his cause, but threw him completely under the feet of\r\nthe people; and by making him inconsistently with his station\r\nconstantly frequent the Forum and carrying him about, he used him for\r\nthe purpose of confirming everything that was said or proposed to\r\nplease and flatter the people. Further, he asked of Pompeius for his\r\nreward, just as if he were not degrading him but were doing him a\r\nservice, and he afterwards got what he asked, the betrayal of\r\nCicero,[308] who was a friend of Pompeius and had served him in public\r\nmatters more than any one else. For when Cicero was in danger and\r\nprayed for his aid, Pompeius would not even see him, but shut the\r\nfront door upon those who came on Cicero's part and went out by\r\nanother door. Cicero fearing the trial retired from Rome.\r\n\r\nXLVII. At this time Cæsar[309] returned from his government and\r\nundertook a political measure, which brought him the greatest\r\npopularity for the present and power for the future, but did the\r\ngreatest damage to Pompeius and the State. For he became a candidate\r\nfor his first consulship; but seeing that while Crassus was at\r\nvariance with Pompeius, if he attached himself to one of them he would\r\nhave the other for his enemy, he applied himself to effect a\r\nreconciliation between them, a thing which in other respects was fair\r\nand useful to the State, but was managed by him for a bad reason and\r\nwith a dexterity full of treacherous design. For the strength which\r\nkept the State, just as in the case of a vessel, in a condition of\r\nequilibrium and prevented it falling over to this side or that, when\r\nbrought together and united caused it to incline to one side with an\r\nirresistible force that overpowered and beat down everything.\r\nAccordingly Cato said that they were mistaken who affirmed that the\r\nState was overturned by the quarrel which afterwards broke out between\r\nCæsar and Pompeius, for they laid the blame on the last events; for it\r\nwas not their disunion nor yet their enmity, but their union and\r\nconcord which was the first and greatest misfortune that befel the\r\nState. Cæsar was elected consul, and forthwith he courted the needy\r\nand poor by proposing measures for the establishment of cities, and\r\nthe division of lands, wherein he stepped beyond the proprieties of\r\nhis office and in a manner made his consulship into a tribunate. When\r\nhis colleague Bibulus opposed him and Cato was prepared to support\r\nBibulus most vigorously, Cæsar brought forward Pompeius on the\r\nRostra, and put the question to him, \"If he approved of the proposed\r\nlaws;\" upon Pompeius saying that he did, \"Will you not then,\" said\r\nCæsar, \"if any one makes resistance to the laws, come forward before\r\nthe people to maintain them?\" \"Certainly,\" said Pompeius, \"I will come\r\nagainst those who threaten swords, with sword and shield.\" It was the\r\ngeneral opinion that Pompeius up to that day had never said or done\r\nanything more arrogant, so that even his friends in his defence said\r\nthat the words had escaped him at the moment. But yet it was clear\r\nfrom what followed that he had completely given himself up to Cæsar to\r\ndo what he pleased with him: for contrary to all expectation Pompeius\r\nmarried Cæsar's daughter Julia, who had been betrothed to Cæpio and\r\nwas going to be married to him within a few days; and to pacify Cæpio,\r\nPompeius gave him his own daughter who was already promised to Faustus\r\nthe son of Sulla. Cæsar himself married Calpurnia the daughter of\r\nPiso.\r\n\r\nXLVIII. After this Pompeius filled the city with soldiers and managed\r\neverything by force. For the soldiers suddenly fell on the consul\r\nBibulus as he was going down to the Forum with Lucullus and Cato, and\r\nbroke the fasces; and some one bedaubed Bibulus by throwing a basket\r\nof ordure over his head, and two of the tribunes who were conducting\r\nhim were wounded. By these means they cleared the Forum of their\r\nopponents and then carried the law about the distribution of lands.\r\nThe people being taken with this bait were now become tame and ready\r\nto support any project of theirs, giving no trouble at all, but\r\nsilently voting for what was proposed to them. Accordingly the\r\nregulations of Pompeius as to which he was at variance with Lucullus\r\nwere confirmed, and Cæsar received Gaul within and without the Alps\r\nand the province of Illyricum for five years with four complete\r\nlegions; and it was settled that the consuls for the next year should\r\nbe Piso[310] the father-in-law of Cæsar, and Gabinius, who was the\r\nmost extravagant of the flatterers of Pompeius. While this was going\r\non, Bibulus shut himself up in his house and never went out for eight\r\nmonths, the remainder of the period of his consulship, but he sent out\r\ncounter-edicts full of abuse and charges against both: Cato as if\r\ninspired and under divine influence foretold in the Senate what would\r\nhappen to the city and to Pompeius; and Lucullus[311] renouncing\r\npublic life kept quiet, on the ground that his age disqualified him\r\nfor political concerns, on which Pompeius observed that for an old man\r\nluxury was more unsuitable to his age than to mingle in affairs of\r\nstate. However Pompeius himself also was soon rendered inactive\r\nthrough passion for his young wife, with whom he passed the chief part\r\nof his time, and lived in the country and his gardens, and he paid no\r\nattention to what was going on in the Forum, so that even Clodius, who\r\nwas then tribune, despised Pompeius and engaged in the most daring\r\nmeasures. For after Clodius had ejected Cicero and sent off Cato to\r\nCyprus[312] under colour of giving him a command, and Cæsar was gone\r\nto Gaul, and Clodius saw that the people were devoted to him as he was\r\ndoing everything and framing all his measures to please them, he\r\nimmediately attempted to repeal some of the regulations of Pompeius,\r\nand seizing the person of the captive Tigranes he kept him in his own\r\nhouse, and he instituted prosecutions against the friends of Pompeius,\r\nand so made trial of the power of Pompeius by attacking his friends.\r\nAt last when Pompeius came forward upon the occasion of a certain\r\ntrial, Clodius having with him a body of men filled with insolence and\r\narrogance took his station in a conspicuous place and put to them the\r\nfollowing questions: \"Who is Imperator unlimited? what man seeks\r\nanother man? who scratches his head[313] with one finger?\" The people\r\nlike a Chorus trained to chant corresponding parts, while Clodius was\r\nshaking his toga,[314] at every question with loud shouts replied,\r\n\"Pompeius.\"\r\n\r\nXLIX. Now this also annoyed Pompeius, who was unaccustomed to be\r\nabused and had no practice in this kind of warfare; but he was still\r\nmore vexed when he perceived that the Senate were pleased at the\r\ninsults offered to him and at his paying the penalty for his treachery\r\nto Cicero. But when it happened that they came to blows in the Forum\r\nand even proceeded so far as to wound one another, and a slave of\r\nClodius was detected in the crowd stealing through the bystanders up\r\nto Pompeius with a dagger in his hand, Pompeius alleging these\r\nproceedings as his excuse, and besides that, being afraid of the\r\ninsolence and abuse of Clodius, came no more into the Forum so long as\r\nClodius was in office, but kept to his house and was planning with his\r\nfriends how he could pacify the resentment of the Senate and the\r\nnobles towards him. However he would not listen to Culleo,[315] who\r\nadvised him to put away Julia and giving up the friendship of Cæsar to\r\npass over to the Senate, but he followed the advice of those who\r\nrecommended that Cicero[316] should be restored, who was the greatest\r\nenemy of Clodius and most beloved by the Senate. Pompeius with a\r\nstrong party accompanied Cicero's brother who was going to make his\r\nentreaty to the people, and after some wounds had been inflicted in\r\nthe Forum and some persons were killed, they got the advantage over\r\nClodius. Cicero returning to the city in pursuance of a law\r\nimmediately reconciled Pompeius to the Senate, and, by speaking in\r\nfavour of the law relating to grain,[317] in a manner again made\r\nPompeius master of all the land and sea that the Romans possessed.\r\nFor under his control were placed harbours, places of trade, the\r\ndisposal of produce, in a word, all the affairs of those who navigated\r\nthe sea and cultivated the land. But Clodius complained that the law\r\nhad not been made on account of the scarcity of grain, but that the\r\nscarcity of grain was caused in order that the law might be passed,\r\nand that Pompeius might again fan into a flame and recover his power,\r\nwhich was as it were wasting away through his want of spirit. Others\r\nexplained this to have been a device of the consul Spinther, whose\r\nobject was to engage Pompeius in a higher official employment, that\r\nhimself might be sent out to support king Ptolemæus.[318] However\r\nCanidius the tribune proposed a measure to the effect that Pompeius\r\nwithout an army and with two lictors should go to bring about a\r\nreconciliation between the Alexandrians and the king. And indeed it\r\nwas supposed that Pompeius was not displeased at the measure, but the\r\nSenate rejected it on the specious pretext that they feared for the\r\nsafety of Pompeius. There were writings to be found scattered about\r\nthe Forum and near the Senate-house, to the effect that Ptolemæus\r\nwished Pompeius to be given to him as general instead of Spinther. And\r\nTimagenes[319] says that Ptolemæus without any reason and without\r\nnecessity had quitted Egypt and left it at the advice of Theophanes\r\nwho was planning profitable occupation for Pompeius and a subject for\r\na fresh command. But the villainy of Theophanes does not make this so\r\nprobable, as the character of Pompeius makes it improbable, for he had\r\nno ambition of so mean and illiberal a kind.\r\n\r\nL. Pompeius being appointed to look after the management and the\r\nsupply of corn, sent his deputies and friends to many places, and he\r\nhimself sailed to Sicily and Sardinia and Libya and collected grain.\r\nWhen he was about to set sail, there was a violent wind on the sea,\r\nand the masters of the ships were unwilling to put out, but Pompeius\r\nembarking first and bidding them raise the anchor, cried, \"It is\r\nnecessary to sail; there is no necessity to live.\" By such boldness\r\nand zeal, and the help of good fortune, Pompeius filled the markets\r\nwith grain and the sea with ships, so that the superfluity of what he\r\ngot together sufficed even for those who were without, and there was\r\nas from a spring an abundant overflowing for all.\r\n\r\nLI. During this time the Celtic wars[320] raised Cæsar to great\r\ndistinction; and though he was considered to be a very long way from\r\nRome, and to be occupied with Belgæ and Suevi and Britanni, he\r\ncontrived, by his skilful management, without being perceived, in the\r\nmidst of the popular assemblies, and in the most important matters, to\r\nfrustrate the political measures of Pompeius. For Cæsar's military\r\nforce was like a body that invested him, and he was training it to\r\ntoil, and making it invincible and formidable, not to oppose the\r\nbarbarians, but he was disciplining his men in these contests just as\r\nif it were merely hunting wild beasts and pursuing them with dogs; and\r\nin the meantime he was sending to Rome gold and silver, and the rest\r\nof the spoil and wealth which he got in abundance from so many\r\nenemies, and by tempting people there with gifts, and assisting ædiles\r\nin their expenses, and generals and consuls and their wives, he was\r\ngaining over many of them; so that when he had crossed the Alps and\r\nwas wintering in Luca, there was a great crowd of men and women who\r\nvied with one another in their eagerness to visit him, besides two\r\nhundred of the Senatorian class, among whom were Pompeius and Crassus;\r\nand one hundred and twenty fasces of proconsuls and prætors were seen\r\nat Cæsar's doors. Now, after filling all the rest with hopes and\r\nmoney, he sent them off; but a compact was made between him and\r\nCrassus and Pompeius, that they should be candidates for the\r\nconsulship, and that Cæsar should help them by sending many of his\r\nsoldiers to vote, and that as soon as they were elected, they should\r\nsecure for themselves the command of provinces and armies, and should\r\nconfirm Cæsar's provinces to him for another five years. Upon this\r\nbeing publicly known, the first men in the State were displeased, and\r\nMarcellinus coming forward before the popular assembly, asked both\r\nCrassus and Pompeius to their faces, if they would be candidates for\r\nthe consulship. The assembly bade them give him an answer, on which\r\nPompeius spoke first, and said, that perhaps he should and perhaps he\r\nshould not. Crassus replied in a manner more befitting a citizen,[321]\r\nfor he said that he would act either way, as he should think it best\r\nfor the common weal. But when Marcellinus stuck close to Pompeius, and\r\nwas considered to be speaking in violent terms, Pompeius said that\r\nMarcellinus, of all men, showed the least regard to fair dealing,\r\nbecause he was not grateful to him in that he was the means of\r\nMarcellinus becoming eloquent, though he was formerly mute, and of now\r\nbeing so full as to vomit, though formerly he was starving of hunger.\r\n\r\nLII. However, though everybody else declined to become candidates for\r\nthe consulship, Cato persuaded Lucius Domitius,[322] and encouraged\r\nhim not to give up, for he said the contest with the tyrants was not\r\nfor power, but for liberty. But Pompeius and his partisans fearing the\r\nvigour of Cato, and lest, as he had all the Senate on his side, he\r\nshould draw away and change the minds of the sounder part of the\r\npeople, would not allow Domitius to come down into the Forum, but they\r\nsent armed men and killed the linkbearer, who was advancing in front,\r\nand put the rest to flight. Cato was the last to retreat, after being\r\nwounded in the right arm while he was fighting in front of Domitius.\r\nBy such means they attained the consulship, nor did they conduct\r\nthemselves in it with more decency. First of all, while the people\r\nwere electing Cato prætor and giving their votes, Pompeius broke up\r\nthe assembly, alleging that the omens were not favourable; and they\r\nhad Vatinius[323] proclaimed in place of Cato by bribing the tribes.\r\nIn the next place they introduced measures by means of Trebonius,[324]\r\nwhich gave to Cæsar, pursuant to the agreement, a second five years,\r\nto Crassus[325] Syria and the Parthian expedition, but to Pompeius all\r\nLibya, and both the provinces of Iberia and four legions, of which he\r\nlent two to Cæsar at his request for the war in Gaul. Now Crassus went\r\nout to his province, after giving up his consular functions; and\r\nPompeius opened his theatre,[326] and gave gymnastic and musical\r\ncontests at the dedication of it, and fights of wild beasts, in which\r\nfive hundred lions were killed; and at the end he exhibited an\r\nelephant-fight, a most astonishing spectacle.\r\n\r\nLIII. For all this Pompeius got admiration and love; but on the other\r\nhand he brought on himself no less odium by giving up the forces and\r\nthe provinces to legati who were his friends, while himself in the\r\nplaces of amusement in Italy going about from one to another spent his\r\ntime with his wife, either because he loved her, or because he could\r\nnot bear to leave his wife who was attached to him; for this also is\r\nsaid. And the love of the young woman for her husband was much talked\r\nabout, for her affection towards Pompeius was not what might have been\r\nexpected considering his age; but the reason appears to have been the\r\nchaste conduct of her husband who knew only his married wife, and the\r\ndignity of his manners which were not austere but agreeable and\r\nparticularly attractive to women, if we must not disbelieve the\r\ntestimony even of Flora the courtezan. It happened that at the\r\nelection of ædiles some men came to blows and no small number were\r\nkilled near Pompeius, and as his garments were drenched with blood, he\r\nchanged them. There was great confusion and hurrying to the house of\r\nthe slaves who were carrying the vests; and it happened that\r\nJulia,[327] who was with child, saw the bloody toga, upon which she\r\nfainted and with difficulty recovered, and in consequence of that\r\nalarm and the excitement, she miscarried. Even those who found most\r\nfault with the alliance of Cæsar and Pompeius, could not blame the\r\nwoman for her affection. She became pregnant a second time and brought\r\nforth a female child, but she died of the pains of labour and the\r\nchild did not survive her many days. Pompeius made preparations to\r\nbury her in his Alban villa, but the people by force took the body and\r\ncarried it down into the Field of Mars, more from pity for the young\r\nwoman than to please Pompeius and Cæsar. But of the two, it was\r\nconsidered that the people gave a larger portion of the honour to\r\nCæsar who was absent than to Pompeius who was present. But in the city\r\nthe waves forthwith began to move and everything was tossed to and\r\nfro, and was the subject of conversation tending to a complete split,\r\nnow that the marriage connection was ended which hitherto rather\r\nveiled than checked the ambition of the two men. After no long time\r\nnews also arrived that Crassus had lost his life among the Parthians;\r\nand that which had been a great hindrance to the civil war breaking\r\nout was now removed, for both Cæsar and Pompeius feared Crassus, and\r\naccordingly to some extent confined themselves within limits in their\r\nbehaviour towards one another. But when fortune had cut off the man\r\nwho was keeping a watch over the struggle, forthwith the words of the\r\ncomic poet became applicable:\r\n\r\n    \"Now each against the other smears his limbs,\r\n    And strews his hands with dust.\"\r\n\r\nSo small a thing is fortune in comparison with men's nature. For\r\nfortune cannot satisfy men's desires, since so great an amount of\r\ncommand and extent of wide-stretched territory put no check on the\r\ndesires of two men, but though they heard and read that \"all\r\nthings[328] were divided into three portions for the gods and each got\r\nhis share of dominion,\" they thought the Roman empire was not enough\r\nfor them who were only two.\r\n\r\nLIV. Yet Pompeius once said when he was addressing the people, that\r\nhe had obtained every office sooner than he expected, and laid it down\r\nsooner than was expected. And in truth he had the disbandings of his\r\nforces a perpetual testimony of the truth of what he said. But now\r\nbeing convinced that Cæsar would not give up his power, he sought by\r\nmeans of the functionaries of the state to strengthen himself against\r\nhim, but he attempted no change of any kind and did not wish to be\r\nconsidered to distrust Cæsar, but to disregard him rather and to\r\ndespise him. However when he saw that the officers were not disposed\r\nof according to his judgment, the citizens being bribed, he allowed\r\nanarchy to spring up in the state; and forthwith there was much talk\r\nabout a dictator, whom Lucilius the tribune first ventured to mention\r\nby advising the people to choose Pompeius dictator. Cato attacked him\r\nfor this, and Lucilius ran the risk of losing his tribunate, and many\r\nof the friends of Pompeius came forward to exculpate him and said that\r\nhe did not seek that office or wish for it. Upon this Cato commended\r\nPompeius and exhorted him to turn his attention to the establishment\r\nof order, and Pompeius then out of shame did turn his attention to it,\r\nand Domitius[329] and Messala were made consuls; but afterwards there\r\nwas again anarchy, and a greater number of persons now began to\r\nagitate the question of a dictator more boldly, and Cato and his\r\npartisans fearing that they should be forced to yield, determined to\r\nlet Pompeius have a certain legalized authority for the purpose of\r\ndiverting him from that pure tyrannical office. Bibulus, who was an\r\nenemy of Pompeius, was the first to propose in the Senate to choose\r\nPompeius sole consul[330] and he said that the city would thus either\r\nbe relieved from the present disorder, or they would be slaves to the\r\nbest man among them. This opinion appeared strange from such a person,\r\nwhen Cato rising for the purpose as it was expected of speaking\r\nagainst Bibulus, as soon as there was silence, said that for his part\r\nhe would not have introduced the proposed measure, but as it was\r\nintroduced by another he advised that it should be adopted, for he\r\npreferred any government to no government, and he thought that nobody\r\nwould administer affairs better than Pompeius at a time of such\r\ndisorder. The Senate accepted the proposal and passed a decree that\r\nPompeius if elected should be solo consul, and that if he wanted a\r\ncolleague, he might choose any person whom he approved of, but not\r\nbefore two months had elapsed; and Pompeius being made consul on these\r\nterms and declared by Sulpicius the Interrex, addressed Cato in a\r\nfriendly manner, admitting his great obligations to him and urging him\r\nto give him his advice as a private man in the discharge of his\r\noffice. But Cato would not admit that Pompeius was under any\r\nobligations to him, for he had said nothing that he did say out of\r\nregard to him, but out of regard to the state: he added that he would\r\ngive him his advice if he were privately applied to; and if Pompeius\r\ndid not invite him, he would publicly tell him his opinion. Such was\r\nCato in everything.\r\n\r\nLV. After entering the city, Pompeius married Cornelia,[331] a\r\ndaughter of Metellus Scipio, who was not a virgin, but had lately been\r\nleft a widow by Publius, the son of Crassus, who had lost his life\r\namong the Parthians, and whose virgin bride she was. The young woman\r\npossessed many charms besides her youthful beauty, for she was well\r\ninstructed in letters, in playing on the lyre, and in geometry, and\r\nshe had been accustomed to listen to philosophical discourses with\r\nprofit. In addition to this she had a disposition free from all\r\naffectation and pedantic display, faults which such acquirements\r\ngenerally breed in women: her father also, both in respect to family\r\nand reputation, was above all imputation. Still the marriage did not\r\nplease some people on account of the disparity of years; for the youth\r\nof Cornelia made her a fitter match for a son of Pompeius. But those\r\nwho were more judicious considered that Pompeius had overlooked the\r\nstate, which was in an unfortunate condition, to cure which the state\r\nhad selected him for her physician, and put herself solely in his\r\nhands; and he was wearing chaplets and celebrating a marriage, when he\r\nought to have considered his consulship a calamity, as it would not\r\nhave been conferred on him so contrary to all constitutional practice,\r\nif his country were in a prosperous condition. However, he presided at\r\nthe trials for corruption and bribery,[332] and drew up laws, pursuant\r\nto which the trials were conducted, and with the exception presently\r\nto be mentioned, he conducted all the proceedings with dignity and\r\nfairness, and he secured to the courts safety, order, and quiet, by\r\ntaking his own place there with armed men; but when his father-in-law\r\nScipio was under trial, he sent for the three hundred and sixty\r\njudices to his house and obtained their support for him, and the\r\naccuser gave up the prosecution when he saw Scipio conducted from the\r\nForum by the judices.[333] This brought Pompeius again into bad\r\nreport, which was still further increased when he came forward to\r\nspeak in praise of Plancus,[334] though he had by special law put an\r\nend to encomiums on persons under trial. Cato, who happened to be one\r\nof the judices, stopped his ears with his hands, saying it was not\r\nright in him to listen to the encomiums which were contrary to law. In\r\nconsequence of this Cato was rejected before the votes were given, but\r\nPlancus was convicted by the votes of the rest and to the shame of\r\nPompeius. Now, a few days after, Hypsæus,[335] a consular man, who was\r\nunder prosecution, watched for Pompeius as he was going to sup after\r\ntaking the bath, and clasping his knees, suppliantly entreated him;\r\nbut Pompeius passed by contemptuously, saying that Hypsæus was\r\nspoiling his supper, and doing nothing more. By showing himself thus\r\npartial he got blame. However, in every other respect he established\r\ngood order, and took his father-in-law as his colleague for the\r\nremaining five months. A decree also was made that he should hold the\r\nprovinces for another four years, and should receive yearly a thousand\r\ntalents, out of which he was to feed and maintain his troops.\r\n\r\nLVI. Cæsar's friends taking advantage of this, claimed some notice for\r\nCæsar also, who was fighting so many battles for the supremacy of\r\nRome; they said that he deserved either another consulship, or to have\r\na fresh period added to his command, during which no other should\r\nsupersede him and carry off the glory due to his labours, but that he\r\nwho had accomplished those things should hold the command and quietly\r\nenjoy the honour. A debate arose on those subjects, on which Pompeius,\r\naffecting to deprecate the odium against Cæsar out of regard to him,\r\nsaid that he had letters of Cæsar, who was willing to have a\r\nsuccessor and to be relieved from service, but still Cæsar thought it\r\nfair that he should be allowed to be a candidate for the consulship\r\nthough he was not at Rome. To this Cato made opposition, and said that\r\nCæsar ought to become a private person and lay down his arms, and then\r\nget any favour that he could from the citizens; and when Pompeius did\r\nnot prosecute the debate, but submitted as if he were worsted, his\r\nreal opinions about Cæsar became more suspected. He also sent to Cæsar\r\nand demanded back the troops[336] which he had lent him, pretending\r\nthat he wanted them for the Parthian war. But Cæsar, though he knew\r\nwhy he was required to give up the troops, sent them back after\r\nhandsomely rewarding them.\r\n\r\nLVII. After this Pompeius had a dangerous illness at Neapolis, from\r\nwhich he recovered. Upon the suggestion of Praxagoras, the people of\r\nNeapolis offered sacrifices for his restoration to health. The\r\nneighbouring people followed their example, and the thing thus going\r\nthe round of Italy, every city, small and great, celebrated a festival\r\nfor several days. No place was large enough to contain the people, who\r\nflocked together from all parts, but the roads were filled and the\r\nvillages and ports with the people rejoicing and sacrificing. Many\r\npersons also with chaplets on their heads and lighted torches received\r\nPompeius, and accompanied him throwing flowers over him, so that his\r\njourney and progress was a most beautiful sight and very splendid.\r\nHowever, it is said that this circumstance contributed to bring about\r\nthe war as much as anything else. For an arrogant feeling entered the\r\nmind of Pompeius, and, with the greatness of the rejoicing, carried\r\noff all reflection on the present state of affairs; and throwing away\r\nthe caution which had always secured his good fortune and his\r\nmeasures, he fell into a state of such unmingled confidence and\r\ncontempt of Cæsar's power, as to suppose that he would require neither\r\narms to oppose him nor any troublesome preparation, but that he could\r\nput him down much easier than he had raised him. Besides this, Appius\r\ncame from Gaul with the troops which Pompeius had lent to Cæsar; and\r\nhe greatly disparaged Cæsar's exploits there, and uttered much abuse\r\nagainst Cæsar; and he said that Pompeius did not know his own power\r\nand reputation, if he intended to strengthen himself against Cæsar by\r\nother troops, for that he could put down Cæsar with Cæsar's own\r\ntroops, as soon as he made his appearance; so great, as he said, was\r\ntheir hatred of Cæsar and their affection towards Pompeius.\r\nAccordingly Pompeius was so much elated, and through his confidence\r\nfilled with such contempt, that he even ridiculed those who were\r\nafraid of the war; and to those who said that, if Cæsar advanced\r\nagainst the city, they saw no troops sufficient to repulse him, with\r\nsmiling countenance and tranquil mien he bade them give themselves no\r\ntrouble about that, \"for in whatever part of Italy,\" he said, \"I stamp\r\nthe earth with my foot, there will spring up forces both men and\r\nhorse.\"\r\n\r\nLVIII. And now Cæsar also stuck to public affairs more vigorously,\r\nhimself keeping at no great distance from Italy, and continually\r\nsending his soldiers to the city to attend the elections, and with\r\nmoney insinuating himself into the favour of many of the magistrates\r\nand corrupting them; among whom was Paulus[337] the consul who changed\r\nsides for fifteen hundred talents, and Curio[338] the tribune who was\r\nreleased by Cæsar from countless debts, and Marcus Antonius who\r\nthrough friendship for Curio was involved in his obligations. Now it\r\nwas said that one of the centurions who had come from Cæsar, while\r\nstanding near the Senate-house and hearing that the Senate were\r\nrefusing to allow Cæsar a prolongation of his term of government, said\r\nas he struck his hand on his sword, \"But this will give it.\" And all\r\nthat was doing and preparing had this design in view. Yet the claims\r\nand reasons urged by Curio in favour of Cæsar were of a more\r\nconstitutional character. For he asked one of two things, either that\r\nthey should require Pompeius also to give up his force, or they should\r\nnot take Cæsar's troops from him: he said, \"Whether they become\r\nprivate persons on fair terms or continued a match for one another by\r\neach keeping what he had, they would remain quiet; but he who proposed\r\nto weaken one of them would double the power which he feared.\" Upon\r\nthis Marcellus the consul called Cæsar a robber, and urged the Senate\r\nto vote him an enemy, if he should not lay down his arms. Yet Curio\r\nwith the assistance of Antonius and Piso, prevailed so far as to have\r\nit put to a regular vote. Accordingly he proposed that those senators\r\nshould move off to one side who were in favour of Cæsar alone laying\r\ndown his arms and Pompeius remaining in command; and the majority went\r\nover to that side. Again, upon his proposing that all should withdraw\r\nwho were of opinion that both should lay down their arms and that\r\nneither should hold a command, only two-and-twenty were in favour of\r\nPompeius, and all the rest were on the side of Curio. Curio\r\nconsidering that he had gained his point, rushed forth to the people\r\nexulting with delight, and the people received him with clapping of\r\nhands and threw on him chaplets and flowers. Pompeius was not in the\r\nSenate, for those who are in command of an army do not enter the city.\r\nBut Marcellus rose up and said that he would not sit still to listen\r\nto words, but that as he spied ten legions already appearing in sight\r\nabove the Alps and on their march, he also would dispatch a man to\r\noppose them and to defend their country.\r\n\r\nLIX. Upon this they changed their garments as was usual in a public\r\ncalamity. Marcellus[339] advanced to Pompeius through the Forum with\r\nthe Senate following him, and standing in front of him said, \"I bid\r\nyou, Pompeius, defend your country and employ the forces that are in\r\nreadiness and raise others.\" Lentulus also said the same, who was one\r\nof the consuls elect for the coming year. But when Pompeius began to\r\nraise recruits, some refused and a few came together tardily and\r\nwithout any readiness, but the greater part cried out that some terms\r\nshould be come to. For Antonius in spite of the Senate had read a\r\nletter of Cæsar to the people which contained proposals likely to\r\nconciliate the mass; for Cæsar proposed that both he and Pompeius\r\nshould give up their provinces and dismiss their troops, and so put\r\nthemselves in the hande of the people and render an account of what\r\nthey had done. Lentulus who was now consul would not assemble the\r\nSenate; but Cicero who had just returned from Cilicia[340] attempted\r\nan amicable settlement on the terms, that Cæsar should quit Gaul and\r\ngive up all his army except two legions with which he should hold\r\nIllyricum and wait for his second consulship. As Pompeius was\r\ndissatisfied with this, the friends of Cæsar so far yielded as to\r\nagree that Cæsar should dismiss one of these two legions; but as\r\nLentulus made opposition and Cato called out that Pompeius was\r\nblundering again if he allowed himself to be deceived, the attempt at\r\na settlement came to no conclusion.\r\n\r\nLX. In the mean time intelligence arrived that Cæsar had taken\r\nAriminum,[341] a large city of Italy, and was marching straight upon\r\nRome with all his force. But this was false; for he was advancing with\r\nonly three hundred horsemen and five thousand legionary soldiers, and\r\nhe did not wait for the rest of his force which was beyond the Alps,\r\nchoosing to fall upon his enemies when they were in confusion and did\r\nnot expect him, rather than to give them time to prepare to fight with\r\nhim. Upon reaching the river Rubico, which was the boundary of his\r\nprovince, he stood in silence and lingered, reflecting, as we may\r\npresume, on the magnitude of the risk. Then, like those who throw\r\nthemselves into a huge abyss from a precipice, closing the eyes of\r\ncalculation and wrapping himself up to meet the danger, he called out\r\nin Greek to those who were present these words only, \"Let the die be\r\ncast,\" and took his army over. As soon as the report reached Rome, and\r\ntumult and fear, such as were never known before, together with\r\nconsternation filled the city, the Senate immediately hurried in a\r\nbody to visit Pompeius, and the magistrates with them; but upon\r\nTullus[342] asking about an army and force, and Pompeius after some\r\ndelay saying in a tone of no great confidence, that he had the men in\r\nreadiness who had come from Cæsar, and he thought he should soon be\r\nable to get together those who had been before enrolled to the number\r\nof thirty thousand, Tullus cried aloud, \"You have deceived us,\r\nPompeius,\" and he advised to send commissioners to Cæsar. One\r\nFavonius,[343] in other respects no bad man, but who with his\r\nself-will and insolence often supposed that he was imitating the bold\r\nlanguage of Cato, bade Pompeius strike the ground with his foot and\r\ncall up the troops which he promised. Pompeius mildly submitted to\r\nthis ill-timed sarcasm; and when Cato reminded him of what he had\r\noriginally predicted to him about Cæsar, Pompeius replied that what\r\nCato had said was in truth more prophetic, but what he had done was of\r\na more friendly character.\r\n\r\nLXI. Cato advised that Pompeius should be appointed general Imperator,\r\nadding, that it was the business of those who caused great mischief to\r\nput an end to it. Cato immediately left the city for Sicily, for he\r\nhad obtained that island as his province; and of the rest each went to\r\nthe province which had been assigned to him by lot. But as nearly all\r\nItaly was in commotion, the events that happened caused much\r\nperplexity; for those who were out of Rome hurried from all parts and\r\ncrowded into the city, and the inhabitants of Rome hastened to leave\r\nthe city, which in such tempest and confusion was weak in available\r\nmeans, but strong in insubordination and the difficulty that it caused\r\nto the magistrates. For it was not possible to allay the fear, nor did\r\nany one allow Pompeius to follow his own judgment, but in whatever way\r\na man was affected, whether by fear, grief or perplexity, he carried\r\nit to Pompeius and filled him with it; and opposite measures prevailed\r\nin the same day, and it was impossible for Pompeius to get any true\r\nintelligence about the enemy, because there were many who reported\r\nanything that they chanced to hear, and were vexed if he did not\r\nbelieve them. Under these circumstances after declaring by an edict\r\nthat he saw nothing but confusion, and bidding all the senators follow\r\nhim, and giving notice that he should consider all who stayed behind\r\nas partisans of Cæsar, he left the city late in the evening; and the\r\nconsuls fled without even making the sacrifices which were usual\r\nbefore wars. But even in the midst of danger Pompeius was fortunate in\r\nthe general affection of the people, for though many blamed the\r\ngeneralship, there was not one who hated the general, but one might\r\nhave found that those who were not willing to leave Pompeius were more\r\nnumerous than those who left the city for the cause of liberty.\r\n\r\nLXII. A few davs after, Cæsar entered and took possession of\r\nRome.[344] He behaved with moderation to all and pacified everybody,\r\nexcept Metellus[345] one of the tribunes who attempted to hinder him\r\nfrom taking money out of the treasury, on which Cæsar threatened him\r\nwith death and added to his threat still harsher words, for he said,\r\nThat to say this was harder for him than to do it. Having thus put\r\nMetellus to flight and taken what he wanted, Cæsar pursued Pompeius,\r\nbeing anxious to drive him out of Italy before his troops from Iberia\r\narrived. Pompeius who had got possession of Brundisium and had plenty\r\nof ships, immediately put on board the consuls and with them thirty\r\ncohorts and sent them over before him to Dyrrachium: Scipio his\r\nfather-in-law and his own son Cneius he sent to Syria to get a fleet\r\nready. After barricading the gates and placing on the walls the\r\nsoldiers who were most lightly armed, he ordered the people of\r\nBrundisium[346] to keep quiet in their houses, and he then broke up\r\nall the ground in the city and intersected it with ditches, and filled\r\nup all the streets with stakes except two through which he went down\r\nto the sea. On the third day he had already embarked at his leisure\r\nall the troops with the exception of those who were guarding the\r\nwalls, to whom he suddenly gave a signal, upon which they all ran down\r\nquickly and being taken on board got out to sea. When Cæsar saw the\r\nwalls deserted, he concluded that the enemy were making off, and in\r\nhis pursuit of them he narrowly escaped getting involved among the\r\nstakes and trenches; but as the people of Brundisium gave him warning,\r\nhe avoided the city and, making a circuit round it, he found that all\r\nhad got under sail, except two vessels which contained only a few\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nLXIII. Now everybody else reckons the sailing away of Pompeius among\r\nthe best military stratagems, but Cæsar[347] wondered that Pompeius,\r\nwho was in possession of a strong city and was expecting his troops\r\nfrom Iberia and was master of the sea, should desert and abandon\r\nItaly. Cicero[348] also blames Pompeius for imitating the generalship\r\nof Themistokles rather than that of Perikles, the circumstances being\r\nlike those of Perikles and not those of Themistokles. And Cæsar showed\r\nby what he did that he was greatly afraid of time:[349] for when he\r\nhad taken prisoner Numerius, a friend of Pompeius, he sent him to\r\nBrundisium with instructions to bring about a reconciliation on fair\r\nterms; but Numerius sailed off with Pompeius. Upon this Cæsar, who in\r\nsixty days had become master of Italy without shedding any blood, was\r\ndesirous of pursuing Pompeius immediately, but as he had no vessels,\r\nhe turned about and marched to Iberia with the design of gaining over\r\nthe troops there.\r\n\r\nLXIV. During this time Pompeius got together a great force: his naval\r\npower was completely irresistible, for the fighting ships were five\r\nhundred, and the number of Liburnian vessels[350] and other small\r\ncraft was immense; the cavalry, the flower of the Romans and Italians,\r\nwas seven thousand, distinguished by family, and wealth and courage;\r\nhis infantry, which was a mixed body and required discipline, he\r\nexercised in Berœa,[351] not sitting still lazily, but practising\r\nhimself in gymnastic exercises[352] as if he were still in the vigour\r\nof his age. And it was a great motive to confidence, when men saw\r\nPompeius Magnus, who was now sixty years of age save two, exercising\r\nhimself among the infantry under arms, then mounting his horse and\r\ndrawing his sword without any trouble while his horse was galloping\r\nand easily sheathing it again; and in the throwing of his spear\r\nshowing not only an exactness of aim, but a strength of arm in the\r\ndistance to which he sent it, which many of the young men could not\r\nsurpass. Both kings of nations and governors came to him; and of the\r\nmen of rank about him from Rome there were sufficient to make up a\r\ncomplete Senate.[353] There came also Labeo,[354] who left Cæsar\r\nthough he had been his friend and had served with him in Gaul; and\r\nBrutus,[355] son of the Brutus who was put to death in Gaul, a man of\r\nnoble spirit who had never yet spoken to Pompeius or saluted him\r\nbecause Pompeius had put his father to death, but now he took service\r\nunder him as the liberator of Rome. Cicero,[356] though he had both in\r\nhis writings and his speeches in the Senate recommended other\r\nmeasures, was ashamed not to join those who were fighting in defence\r\nof their country. There came also to Macedonia Tidius Sextius,[357] a\r\nman of extreme old age, lame of one leg; and while others were\r\nlaughing and jeering, Pompeius on seeing him rose up and ran to meet\r\nhim, for he considered it a great testimony for men of advanced age\r\nand feeble strength to choose danger with him in preference to safety.\r\n\r\nLXV. A Senate being formed, upon the proposition of Cato they came to\r\na resolution to put no Roman to death except in battle, and not to\r\nplunder any city that was subject to the Romans, which increased still\r\nfurther the popularity of the party of Pompeius; for those who were\r\nunconcerned about the war by reason of being far removed from it or\r\nwho were disregarded on account of their weakness, gave Pompeius the\r\nbenefit of their good wishes at least, and as far as words could go\r\ncontended on his behalf in favour of the right, considering every man\r\nan enemy to gods and to men who did not wish Pompeius to be\r\nvictorious. Cæsar also showed much moderation in his success, for\r\nafter he had captured and defeated the forces of Pompeius in\r\nIberia,[358] he let the generals go and employed the troops. After\r\ncrossing the Alps again and hurrying through Italy, he arrived at\r\nBrundisium about the winter solstice. He then crossed the sea and\r\nputting in at Oricum sent Jubius,[359] a friend of Pompeius, who was\r\nhis prisoner, to Pompeius[360] to propose that they should both meet\r\ntogether on the third day, disband all their forces, and after being\r\nreconciled and confirming their union by oath, return to Italy.\r\nPompeius again considered this to be an ambuscade, and hastily going\r\ndown to the sea he took possession of the posts and places which\r\npresented very strong positions for an army; he also seized the naval\r\nstations and landing places which were favourable for those who came\r\nby sea, so that every wind which blew brought to Pompeius corn or\r\ntroops or money; but Cæsar being confined in straits both on the sea\r\nand land side was of necessity glad to fight, and he attacked the\r\nlines of Pompeius and continually provoked him to battle, in which\r\nCæsar had generally the advantage and the superiority in the\r\nskirmishing. But on one occasion he narrowly escaped being completely\r\ncrushed and losing his army, for Pompeius fought with great courage\r\nand routed all the enemy, who lost two thousand men; but he was\r\neither unable or was afraid to force his way into Cæsar's camp and to\r\nenter with the fugitives, which made Cæsar say to his friends, \"To-day\r\nthe victory would have been with the enemy, if they had had a\r\ncommander who knew how to conquer.\"\r\n\r\nLXVI. The partisans of Pompeius being greatly elated at this success\r\nwere eager to have a decisive battle. Pompeius wrote to the distant\r\nkings and generals and cities to inform them that he was victorious,\r\nbut he feared the risk of a battle, thinking that by delay and\r\nreducing the enemy to straits he should finally vanquish men who were\r\ninvincible in arms and had long been accustomed to conquer together,\r\nbut as to the other military duties, and marches, and change of\r\nposition, and digging of trenches and building of walls, were not\r\nefficient by reason of age and on this account were eager to come to\r\nclose fighting and to engage hand to hand. However, previous to the\r\nlast contest Pompeius had been able in some degree to draw his men\r\nfrom their purpose by persuading them to keep quiet; but when Cæsar\r\nafter the battle was compelled by want of provisions to break up his\r\ncamp, and began his march into Thessaly through the country of the\r\nAthamanes,[361] the confidence of the soldiers of Pompeius could no\r\nlonger be kept in check, and calling out that Cæsar was flying, some\r\nwere for following and pursuing him, and others for crossing over into\r\nItaly, and others were sending to Rome their slaves and friends to get\r\npossession of houses near the Forum, with the intention of forthwith\r\nbecoming candidates for office. Many of their own accord sailed to\r\nCornelia who was in Lesbos bearing the good tidings of the war being\r\nat an end; for Pompeius had sent her there out of the way of danger.\r\nThe Senate being assembled, Afranius gave his opinion that they should\r\nstick to Italy, for Italy was the chief prize of the war, and would\r\nbring to those who were masters of it the possession of Sicily,\r\nSardinia, Corsica, Iberia, and all Gaul; and as to that which was the\r\ngreatest concern to Pompeius, his native country who was stretching\r\nout her hands only at a short distance from them, it was not\r\nhonourable to leave her to be insulted and enslaved by slaves and\r\nflatterers of tyrants. But Pompeius did not consider it to be\r\nconsistent with his reputation to run away from Cæsar a second time\r\nand to be pursued, when fortune gave him the opportunity of being the\r\npursuer, nor did he think it consistent with his duty to desert\r\nScipio[362] and the consular men in Hellas and Thessaly who would\r\nimmediately fall into Cæsar's hands with their military chests and\r\nlarge forces; he thought also that Rome was best cared for by fighting\r\nin her defence as far from her as possible, that she might wait for\r\nthe conqueror without feeling or hearing of any misfortunes.\r\n\r\nLXVII. Having come to this decision, Pompeius pursued Cæsar, resolved\r\nto avoid a battle, but by following close up to hem him in and wear\r\nhim out by privation. He had other reasons for thinking this to be the\r\nbest plan, and it also reached his ears that it was a subject of\r\ncommon conversation among the cavalry that they ought to defeat Cæsar\r\nas soon as they could and then put down Pompeius also. Some say that\r\nthis was also the reason why Pompeius employed Cato[363] in no matter\r\nof importance, but even when he was marching against Cæsar left him on\r\nthe coast to look after the stores, through fear that if Cæsar were\r\ndestroyed, Cato might forthwith compel him also to lay down his\r\ncommand. Accordingly as he followed the enemy leisurely he was much\r\ncensured and there was a clamour against him, that his object was not\r\nto defeat Cæsar by his generalship, but his native country and the\r\nSenate, that he might always keep the command and never give over\r\nhaving as his attendants and guards those who considered themselves\r\nthe masters of the world. Domitius Ahenobarbus also by always calling\r\nhim Agamemnon and King of Kings made him odious. Favonius too made\r\nhimself no less disagreeable by his scoffing manner than others by the\r\nunseasonable freedom of their language, calling out, \"Men, we shall\r\nnot eat figs in Tusculum[364] even this year!\" Lucius Afranius who had\r\nlost his forces in Iberia and on that account had fallen under the\r\nimputation of treachery, now seeing that Pompeius avoided a battle,\r\nsaid he was surprised that those who accused him did not advance and\r\nfight against the trafficker in provinces. By these and like\r\nexpressions often repeated they at last prevailed over Pompeius, a man\r\nwho was a slave to public fame and the opinion of his friends, and\r\ndrew him on to follow their own hopes and impetuosity and to give up\r\nthe best considered plans, a thing which would have been unbefitting\r\neven in the master of a vessel, to say nothing of the\r\ncommander-in-chief of so many nations and forces. Pompeius approved of\r\nthe physician who never gratifies the desires of his patients, and yet\r\nhe yielded to military advisers who were in a diseased state, through\r\nfear of offending if he adopted healing measures. And how can one say\r\nthose men were in a healthy state, some of whom were going about among\r\nthe troops and already canvassing for consulships and prætorships, and\r\nSpinther and Domitius[365] and Scipio were disputing and quarrelling\r\nabout the priesthood of Cæsar and canvassing, just as if Tigranes the\r\nArmenian were encamped by them or the King of the Nabathæans, and not\r\nthat Cæsar and that force with which he had taken a thousand cities by\r\nstorm, and subdued above three hundred nations, and had fought with\r\nGermans and Gauls unvanquished in more battles than could be counted,\r\nand had taken a hundred times ten thousand prisoners, and had\r\nslaughtered as many after routing them in pitched battles.\r\n\r\nLXVIII. However, by importunity and agitation, after the army had\r\ndescended into the plain of Pharsalus,[366] they compelled Pompeius to\r\nhold a council of war, in which Labienus, who was commander of the\r\ncavalry, got up first, and swore that he would not leave the battle\r\ntill he had routed the enemy; and they all swore to the same effect.\r\nIn the night Pompeius dreamed that as he was entering the theatre, the\r\npeople clapped, and that he was decorating a temple of Venus the\r\nVictorious[367] with many spoils. And in some respects he was\r\nencouraged, but in others rather depressed by the dream, lest fame and\r\nglory should accrue from him to the race of Cæsar, which traced its\r\ndescent from Venus; and certain panic alarms which were rushing\r\nthrough the camp aroused him. In the morning-watch a bright light[368]\r\nshone forth above the camp of Cæsar, which was in a state of profound\r\ntranquillity, and a flame-like torch springing from this light\r\ndescended upon the camp of Pompeius; and Cæsar himself says that he\r\nwitnessed this as he was visiting the watches. At daybreak, as Cæsar\r\nwas going to move to Scotussa,[369] and the soldiers were engaged in\r\ntaking down the tents and sending forward the beasts and\r\ncamp-followers, the scouts came with intelligence that they spied many\r\narms in the enemy's encampment moving backwards and forwards, and that\r\nthere was a movement and noise as of men coming out to battle. After\r\nthem others came announcing that the vanguard was already putting\r\nitself in battle order. Upon this, Cæsar observing that the expected\r\nday had arrived on which they would have to fight against men, and not\r\nagainst hunger and poverty, quickly gave orders to hang out in front\r\nof his tent the purple colours,[370] which is the signal for battle\r\namong the Romans. The soldiers at the sight of it left their tents\r\nwith loud shouts and rejoicing and hurried to arms; as the centurions\r\nled them to their several ranks, every man, just as if he belonged to\r\na chorus, without confusion, being well trained, quietly took his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nLXIX. Pompeius commanded the right wing, intending to oppose Antonius;\r\nin the centre he placed his father-in-law Scipio against Calvinus\r\nLucius;[371] and the left was commanded by Lucius Domitius, and\r\nstrengthened with the main body of the cavalry. For nearly all the\r\nhorsemen had crowded to that point, with the design of overpowering\r\nCæsar and cutting to pieces the tenth legion, which had a very great\r\nreputation for courage, and Cæsar was accustomed to take his station\r\nin this legion when he fought a battle. But Cæsar, observing that the\r\nenemy's left wing was strengthened by so large a body of cavalry, and\r\nfearing their brilliant equipment, summoned six cohorts from the\r\nreserve, and placed them in the rear of the tenth legion, with orders\r\nto keep quiet and not let the enemy see them; but as soon as the\r\ncavalry advanced, they had orders to run forwards through the first\r\nranks, and not to throw their javelins, as the bravest soldiers are\r\nused to do in their eagerness to get to fighting with the sword, but\r\nto push upwards and to wound the eyes and faces of the enemy, for\r\nthose handsome, blooming pyrrichists would not keep their ground for\r\nfear of their beauty being spoiled, nor would they venture to look at\r\nthe iron that was pushed right into their faces. Now Cæsar was thus\r\nemployed. But Pompeius, who was examining the order of battle from his\r\nhorse, observing that the enemy were quietly awaiting in their ranks\r\nthe moment of attack, and the greater part of his own army was not\r\nstill, but was in wavelike motion through want of experience and in\r\nconfusion, was alarmed lest his troops should be completely separated\r\nat the beginning of the battle, and he commanded the front ranks to\r\nstand with their spears presented, and keeping their ground in compact\r\norder to receive the enemy's attack. But Cæsar finds fault[372] with\r\nthis generalship of Pompeius; for he says that he thus weakened the\r\nforce of the blows which a rapid assault produces; and the rush to\r\nmeet the advancing ranks, which more than anything else fills the mass\r\nof the soldiers with enthusiasm and impetuosity in closing with the\r\nenemy, and combined with the shouts and running increases the\r\ncourage--Pompeius, by depriving his men of this, fixed them to the\r\nground and damped them. On Cæsar's side the numbers were twenty-two\r\nthousand; on the side of Pompeius the numbers[373] were somewhat more\r\nthan double.\r\n\r\nLXX.[374] And now, when the signal was given on both sides, and the\r\ntrumpet was beginning to urge them on to the conflict, every man of\r\nthis great mass was busy in looking after himself; but a few of the\r\nRomans, the best, and some Greeks who were present, and not engaged in\r\nthe battle, as the conflict drew near, began to reflect to what a\r\ncondition ambition and rivalry had brought the Roman State. For\r\nkindred arms and brotherly battalions and common standards,[375] and\r\nthe manhood and the might of a single state in such numbers, were\r\nclosing in battle, self-matched against self, an example of the\r\nblindness of human nature and its madness, under the influence of\r\npassion. For if they had now been satisfied quietly to govern and\r\nenjoy what they had got, there was the largest and the best portion of\r\nthe earth and of the sea subject to them; and if they still wished to\r\ngratify their love of trophies and of triumphs, and their thirst for\r\nthem, they might have their fill of Parthian or German wars. Scythia,\r\ntoo, and the Indians were a labour in reserve, and ambition had a\r\nreasonable pretext for such undertaking, the civilization of barbaric\r\nnations. And what Scythian horse, or Parthian arrows, or Indian wealth\r\ncould have checked seventy thousand Romans advancing in arms under\r\nPompeius and Cæsar, whose name these nations heard of long before they\r\nheard of the name of Rome? Such unsociable, and various, and savage\r\nnations had they invaded and conquered. But now they engaged with one\r\nanother in battle, without even feeling any compunction about their\r\nown glory, for which they spared not their native country, up to this\r\nday having always borne the name of invincible. For the relationship\r\nthat had been made between them, and the charms of Julia, and that\r\nmarriage, were from the very first only deceitful and suspected\r\npledges of an alliance formed from interested motives, in which there\r\nwas not a particle of true friendship.\r\n\r\nLXXI. Now when the plain of Pharsalus was filled with men and horses\r\nand arms, and the signal for battle was raised on both sides, the\r\nfirst to spring forward from the line of Cæsar was Caius\r\nCrassianus[376] a centurion who had the command of one hundred and\r\ntwenty men, and was now fulfilling a great promise to Cæsar. For as\r\nCæsar observed him to be the first that was quitting the camp, he\r\nspoke to him and asked what he thought of the battle; and Crassianus\r\nstretching out his right hand replied with a loud voice, \"You shall\r\nhave a splendid victory, Cæsar; and as to me, you shall praise me\r\nwhether I survive the day or die.\" Remembering what he had said, he\r\nrushed forward and carrying many along with him fell on the centre of\r\nthe enemy. The struggle was forthwith with the sword and many fell;\r\nbut while Crassianus was pushing forwards and cutting down those who\r\nwere in the front ranks, a soldier made a stand against him and drove\r\nhis sword through his mouth so that the point came out at the back of\r\nthe neck. When Crassianus had fallen, the battle was equally contested\r\nin this part of the field. Now Pompeius did not quickly lead on the\r\nright wing, but was looking at the opposite wing and lost time in\r\nwaiting for the cavalry to get into action. The cavalry were now\r\nextending their companies with the view of surrounding Cæsar, and they\r\ndrove Cæsar's cavalry who were few in number upon the line in front of\r\nwhich they were stationed. But upon Cæsar giving the signal, the\r\ncavalry retired, and the cohorts which had been reserved to meet the\r\nenemy's attempt to outflank them, rushed forward, three thousand in\r\nnumber, and met the enemy; then fixing themselves by the side of the\r\nhorsemen, they pushed their spears upwards, as they had been\r\ninstructed, against the horses, aiming at the faces of the riders. The\r\nhorsemen, who were altogether inexperienced in fighting, and had never\r\nexpected or heard of such a mode of attack, did not venture to stand\r\nor endure the blows aimed at their eyes and mouths, but turning their\r\nbacks and holding their hands before their faces they ingloriously\r\ntook to flight. The soldiers of Cæsar leaving these fugitives to\r\nescape advanced against the infantry, and they made their attack at\r\nthat point where the wing having lost the protection of the cavalry\r\ngave them the opportunity of outflanking and surrounding them. These\r\nmen falling on the enemy in the flank and the tenth legion attacking\r\nthem in front, the enemy did not stand their ground nor keep together,\r\nfor they saw that while they were expecting to surround the enemy,\r\nthey were themselves surrounded.\r\n\r\nLXXII. After the infantry were routed, and Pompeius seeing the dust\r\nconjectured what had befallen the cavalry, what reflections passed in\r\nhis mind, it is difficult to say; but like a madman more than anything\r\nelse and one whose reason was affected, without considering that he\r\nwas Magnus Pompeius, without speaking a word to any one, he walked\r\nslowly back to his camp, so that one may properly apply to him the\r\nverses[377]\r\n\r\n    \"But lofty father Zeus struck fear in Ajax;\r\n    He stood confounded, and behind him threw\r\n    His shield of seven-ox-hide, and trembling look'd\r\n    Towards the crowd.\"\r\n\r\nIn this state Pompeius came to his tent and sat down without speaking,\r\nuntil many of the pursuers rushed into the camp with the fugitives;\r\nand then merely uttering these words, \"What, even to the camp!\" and\r\nnothing more, he rose and taking a dress suitable to his present\r\ncondition made his way out. The rest of the legions also fled, and\r\nthere was great slaughter in the camp of those who were left to guard\r\nthe tents and of the slaves; but Asinius Pollio[378] says that only\r\nsix thousand soldiers fell, and Pollio fought in that battle on\r\nCæsar's side. When Cæsar's men took the camp, they saw evidence of the\r\nfolly and frivolity of the enemy. For every tent was crowned with\r\nmyrtle and furnished with flowered coverings to the couches and tables\r\nloaded with cups; and bowls of wine were laid out, and there was the\r\npreparation and decoration of persons who had performed a sacrifice\r\nand were celebrating a festival,[379] rather than of men who were\r\narming for battle. So blinded by their hopes, and so full of foolish\r\nconfidence did they come out to war.\r\n\r\nLXXIII. Pompeius having proceeded a little way from the camp let his\r\nhorse go, and with very few persons about him, went on slowly as no\r\none pursued him, and with such thoughts, as would naturally arise in\r\nthe mind of a man who for four-and-thirty years had been accustomed to\r\nconquer and to have the mastery in everything, and now for the first\r\ntime in his old age experienced what defeat and flight were;\r\nreflecting also that in a single battle he had lost the reputation and\r\nthe power which were the fruit of so many struggles and wars, and\r\nwhile a little before he was protected by so many armed men and\r\nhorses, and armaments, now he was retreating and had become so weak\r\nand humbled, as easily to escape the notice of his enemies who were\r\nlooking for him. After passing Larissa[380] and arriving at Tempe,\r\nbeing thirsty he threw himself down on his face and drank of the\r\nriver, and then rising up he proceeded through Tempe till he reached\r\nthe sea. There he rested for the remainder of the night in a\r\nfisherman's hut, and at daybreak embarking on board of one of the\r\nriver-boats and taking with him those of his followers who were\r\nfreemen, and bidding his slaves go to Cæsar without any apprehension\r\nfor their safety, he rowed along the coast till he saw a large\r\nmerchant-ship preparing to set sail, the master of which was a Roman,\r\nwho had no intimacy with Pompeius, but knew him by sight: his name was\r\nPeticius. It happened the night before that Peticius saw Pompeius in a\r\ndream, not as he had often seen him, but humble and downcast, speaking\r\nto him. And it happened that he was telling his dream to his\r\nshipmates, as is usual with men in such weighty matters, who have\r\nnothing to do; when all at once one of the sailors called out that he\r\nspied a river-boat rowing from the land with men in it who were making\r\nsignals with their clothes and stretching out their hands to them.\r\nAccordingly Peticius turning his eyes in that direction recognised\r\nPompeius just as he had seen him in the dream, and striking his\r\nforehead he ordered the sailors to put the boat alongside, and he\r\nstretched out his right hand and called to Pompeius, already\r\nconjecturing from his appearance the fortune and the reverses of the\r\nman. Upon which the master, without waiting to be entreated or\r\naddressed, took on board with him, all whom Pompeius chose (and these\r\nwere the two Lentuli[381] and Favonius), and set sail; and shortly\r\nafter seeing King Deiotarus making his way from the land as fast as he\r\ncould they took him in also. When it was supper time and the master\r\nhad made the best preparation that he could, Favonius observing that\r\nPompeius had no domestics and was beginning to take off his shoes, ran\r\nup to him and loosed his shoes and helped him to anoint himself. And\r\nhenceforward Favonius continued to wait on Pompeius and serve him,\r\njust as slaves do their master, even to the washing of his feet and\r\npreparing his meals, so that a witness of the free will of that\r\nservice and the simplicity and absence of all affectation might have\r\nexclaimed\r\n\r\n     \"To generous minds how noble every task.\"[382]\r\n\r\nLXXIV. In such wise Pompeius coasted to Amphipolis,[383] and thence\r\ncrossed over to Mitylene, wishing to take up Cornelia and her son.\r\nUpon reaching the shore of the island he sent a message to the city,\r\nnot such as Cornelia expected, for the pleasing intelligence that she\r\nhad received both by report and by letter led her to hope that the war\r\nwas terminated near Dyrrachium, and that all that remained for\r\nPompeius was to pursue Cæsar. The messenger, who found her in this\r\nstate of expectation, did not venture to salute her, but indicating by\r\ntears more than words the chief and greatest of her misfortunes, he\r\nbade her hasten, if she wished to see Pompeius in a single vessel and\r\nthat not his own. Cornelia, on hearing these words, threw herself on\r\nthe ground, and lay there a long time without sense or speech, and\r\nwith difficulty recovering herself, and seeing that it was not a time\r\nfor tears and lamentations, she ran through the city to the sea.\r\nPompeius met and caught her in his arms as she was just ready to sink\r\ndown and fall upon him, when Cornelia said, \"I see you, husband, not\r\nthrough your own fortune but mine, reduced to a single vessel, you who\r\nbefore your marriage with Cornelia sailed along this sea with five\r\nhundred ships. Why have you come to see me, and why did you not leave\r\nto her evil dæmon one who has loaded you also with so much misfortune?\r\nHow happy a woman should I have been had I died before I heard that\r\nPublius, whose virgin bride I was, had perished by the Parthians; and\r\nhow wise, if even after he died I had put an end to my own life, as I\r\nattempted to do; but forsooth I have been kept alive to be the ruin of\r\nPompeius Magnus also.\"\r\n\r\nLXXV. So it is said Cornelia spoke, and thus Pompeius replied: \"It is\r\ntrue, Cornelia, you have hitherto known only one fortune, and that the\r\nbetter; and perhaps it has deceived you too, in that it has abided\r\nwith me longer than is wont. But as we are mortals, we must bear this\r\nchange, and still try fortune; for it is not hopeless for a man to\r\nattempt from this condition to recover his former state who has come\r\nto this after being in that other.\" Accordingly Cornelia sent for her\r\nproperty and slaves from the city; and though the Mitylenæans came to\r\npay their respects to Pompeius, and invited him to enter the city, he\r\nwould not, but he exhorted them also to yield to the conqueror and to\r\nbe of good heart, for Cæsar was merciful and of a humane disposition.\r\nBut turning to Kratippus[384] the philosopher, for he had come down\r\nfrom the city to see him, Pompeius found fault with and in a few\r\nwords expressed some doubts about Providence, Kratippus rather giving\r\nway to him and trying to lead him to better hopes, that he might not\r\ngive him pain at so unseasonable a time by arguing against him; for\r\nPompeius might have questioned him about Providence, and Kratippus\r\nmight have shown that the state of affairs at Rome required a monarchy\r\non account of the political disorder; and he might have asked\r\nPompeius, \"How, Pompeius, and by what evidence shall we be persuaded\r\nthat you would have used your fortune better than Cæsar, if you had\r\nbeen victorious?\" But these matters that concern the gods we must\r\nleave as they are.\r\n\r\nLXXVI. Taking on board his wife and friends, Pompeius continued his\r\nvoyage, only putting in at such ports as of necessity he must for\r\nwater or provisions. The first city that he came to was Attaleia[385]\r\nof Pamphylia; and there some galleys from Cilicia met him, and some\r\nsoldiers were collecting, and there were again about sixty senators\r\nabout him. Hearing that his navy still kept together, and that Cato\r\nhad recruited many soldiers and was passing over to Libya, he lamented\r\nto his friends and blamed himself for being forced to engage with his\r\narmy only, and for not making any use of the force which was beyond\r\nall dispute superior to that of the enemy; and that his navy was not\r\nso stationed that if he were defeated by land he might forthwith have\r\nhad what would have made him a match for the enemy, a strength and\r\npower so great by sea close at hand. Indeed Pompeius committed no\r\ngreater fault, nor did Cæsar show any greater generalship, than in\r\nwithdrawing the field of battle so far beyond the reach of assistance\r\nfrom the navy. However, being compelled in the present state of\r\naffairs to decide and do something, he sent round to the cities, and\r\nhimself sailing about to some, asked them for money, and began to man\r\nships. But fearing the rapid movements and speed of his enemy, lest he\r\nshould come upon him and take him before he was prepared, he looked\r\nabout for a place of refuge for the present and a retreat. Now there\r\nappeared to them upon consideration to be no province to which they\r\ncould safely fly; and as to the kingdoms, Pompeius gave it as his\r\nopinion that the Parthian[386] at the present was the best able to\r\nreceive and protect them in their present weakness, and to strengthen\r\nthem again and to send them forth with the largest force; of the rest,\r\nsome turned their thoughts towards Libya and Juba,[387] but Theophanes\r\nof Lesbos pronounced it madness to leave Egypt, which was only three\r\ndays' sail distant, and Ptolemæus,[388] who was still a youth, and\r\nindebted to Pompeius for the friendship and favour which his father\r\nhad received from him, and to put himself in the hands of the\r\nParthians, a most treacherous nation; and to be the first of all\r\npersons who did not choose to submit to a Roman who had been connected\r\nwith him by marriage, nor to make trial of his moderation, and to put\r\nhimself in the power of Arsakes,[389] who was not able to take even\r\nCrassus so long as he was alive; and to carry a young wife of the\r\nfamily of Scipio among barbarians, who measured their power by their\r\ninsolence and unbridled temper; and if no harm should befall Cornelia,\r\nand it should only be apprehended that she might suffer injury, it\r\nwould be a sad thing for her to be in the power of those who were able\r\nto do it. This alone, it is said diverted Pompeius from proceeding to\r\nthe Euphrates; if indeed any reflection still guided Pompeius, and he\r\nwas not rather directed by a dæmon to the way that he took.\r\n\r\nLXXVII. Accordingly when the proposal to fly to Egypt prevailed,\r\nPompeius setting sail from Cyprus in a galley of Seleukeia[390] with\r\nhis wife (and of the rest some accompanied him also in ships of war,\r\nand others in merchant vessels), crossed the sea safely; and hearing\r\nthat Ptolemæus[391] was seated before Pelusium with his army, being\r\nengaged in war against his sister, he came to that part of the coast\r\nand sent forward a person to announce his arrival to the king and to\r\npray for his protection. Now Ptolemæus was very young, and Potheinus\r\nwho managed everything, summoned a council of the chief persons; and\r\nthe chief persons were those whom he chose to make so, and he bade\r\neach man give his opinion. It was indeed a sad thing that such men\r\nshould deliberate about Pompeius Magnus, as Potheinus the eunuch and\r\nTheodotus of Chios who was hired as a teacher of rhetoric and the\r\nEgyptian Achillas: for these were the chief advisers of the king among\r\nthe eunuchs and others who had the care of his person; and such was\r\nthe court whose decision Pompeius was waiting for at anchor some\r\ndistance from the shore and tossed by the waves, he who thought it\r\nbeneath him to be indebted to Cæsar for his life. Now opinions among\r\nthe rest were so far divided that some advised they should drive away\r\nPompeius, and others, that they should invite and receive him: but\r\nTheodotus displaying his power in speech and his rhetorical art proved\r\nthat neither of these courses was safe, but that if they received\r\nPompeius, they would have Cæsar for an enemy and Pompeius for their\r\nmaster, and if they drove him away, they would incur the displeasure\r\nof Pompeius for ejecting him and of Cæsar for the trouble of the\r\npursuit; it was therefore best to send for the man and kill him, for\r\nthus they would please Cæsar and have nothing to fear from Pompeius.\r\nAnd he concluded with a smile, as it is said, A dead man does not\r\nbite.\r\n\r\nLXXVIII. Having determined on this they intrust the execution to\r\nAchillas, who taking with him one Septimius who had a long time ago\r\nserved under Pompeius as a centurion and Salvius another centurion and\r\nthree or four slaves, put out towards the ship of Pompeius. It\r\nhappened that all the most distinguished persons who accompanied\r\nPompeius had come on board his ship to see what was going on.\r\nAccordingly when they saw a reception which was neither royal nor\r\nsplendid nor corresponding to the expectations of Theophanes, but a\r\nfew men in a fishing-boat sailing towards them, this want of respect\r\nmade them suspect treachery and they advised Pompeius to row back into\r\nthe open sea, while they were still out of reach of missiles. In the\r\nmean time as the boat was nearing, Septimius was the first to rise and\r\nhe addressed Pompeius as Imperator in the Roman language and Achillas\r\nsaluting him in Greek invited him to enter the boat, because, as he\r\nsaid, the shallows were of great extent and the sea being rather sandy\r\nhad not depth enough to float a trireme. At the same time it was\r\nobserved that some of the king's ships were getting their men on\r\nboard, and soldiers occupied the shore, so that it appeared impossible\r\nto escape even if they changed their minds and made the attempt; and\r\nbesides, this want of confidence would give the murderers some excuse\r\nfor their crime. Accordingly, after embracing Cornelia who was\r\nanticipating and bewailing his fate, he ordered two centurions to step\r\ninto the boat before him, and Philippus one of his freedmen and a\r\nslave called Scythes, and while Achillas was offering him his hand out\r\nof the boat, he turned round to his wife and son and repeated the\r\niambics of Sophocles,\r\n\r\n    \"Whoever to a tyrant bends his way,\r\n    Is made his slave, e'en if he goes a freeman.\"\r\n\r\nLXXIX.[392] These were the last words that he spoke to his friends\r\nbefore he entered the boat: and as it was a considerable distance to\r\nthe land from the galley, and none of those in the boat addressed any\r\nfriendly conversation to him, looking at Septimius he said, \"I am not\r\nmistaken I think in recognising you as an old comrade of mine;\" and\r\nSeptimius nodded without making any reply or friendly acknowledgment.\r\nAs there was again a profound silence, Pompeius who had a small roll\r\non which he had written a speech in Greek that he intended to address\r\nto Ptolemæus, began reading it. As they neared the land, Cornelia with\r\nher friends in great anxiety was watching the result from the galley,\r\nand she began to have good hopes when she saw some of the king's\r\npeople collecting together at the landing as if to honor Pompeius and\r\ngive him a reception. In the mean time, while Pompeius was taking the\r\nhand of Philippus that he might rise more easily, Septimius from\r\nbehind was the first to transfix him with his sword; and Salvius, and\r\nafter him Achillas drew their swords. Pompeius drawing his toga close\r\nwith both hands over his face, without saying or doing anything\r\nunworthy of himself, but giving a groan only, submitted to the blows,\r\nbeing sixty years of age save one, and ending his life just one day\r\nafter his birthday.\r\n\r\nLXXX. Those in the ships seeing the murder uttered a shriek which\r\ncould be heard even to the land, and quickly raising their anchors,\r\ntook to flight: and a strong breeze aided them in their escape to the\r\nopen sea, so that the Egyptians, though desirous of pursuing, turned\r\nback. They cut off the head of Pompeius, and throwing the body naked\r\nout of the boat, left it for those to gaze at who felt any curiosity.\r\nPhilippus stayed by the body, till the people were satisfied with\r\nlooking at it, and then washing it with sea-water he wrapped it up in\r\na tunic of his own; and as he had no other means, he looked about till\r\nhe found the wreck of a small fishing-boat, which was decayed indeed,\r\nbut enough to make a funeral pile in case of need for a naked body,\r\nand that not an entire corpse. As he was collecting these fragments\r\nand putting them together, a Roman, now an old man[393] who had served\r\nhis first campaigns in his youth under Pompeius, stood by him and\r\nsaid: \"Who are you, my friend, that are preparing to perform the\r\nfuneral rites to Pompeius Magnus?\" Philippus replying that he was a\r\nfreedman, the man said: \"But you shall not have this honour to\r\nyourself: allow me too to share in this pious piece of good fortune,\r\nthat I may not altogether have to complain of being in a strange land,\r\nif in requital for many sufferings I get this honour at least, to\r\ntouch and to tend with my hands the greatest of the Roman generals.\"\r\nSuch were the obsequies of Pompeius. On the next day Lucius Lentulus\r\nwho was on his voyage from Cyprus, not knowing what had happened, was\r\ncoasting along the shore, when he saw the pile and Philippus standing\r\nby it before he was seen himself and said, \"Who is resting here after\r\nclosing his career?\" and after a slight interval, with a groan, he\r\nadded, \"perhaps it is you, Pompeius Magnus.\" Presently he landed, and\r\nbeing seized was put to death. This was the end of Pompeius. Not long\r\nafter Cæsar arriving in Egypt, which was filled with this horrid deed,\r\nturned away from the man who brought him the head of Pompeius, as from\r\na murderer, and when he received the seal of Pompeius, he shed tears;\r\nthe device was a lion holding a sword. He put to death Achillas and\r\nPotheinus, and the king himself being defeated in battle was lost\r\nsomewhere near the river. Theodotus the sophist escaped the vengeance\r\nof Cæsar, for he fled from Egypt and wandered about in a miserable\r\nstate, the object of detestation; but Brutus Marcus, after he had\r\nkilled Cæsar and got the power in his hands, finding Theodotus in\r\nAsia, put him to death with every circumstance of contumely. Cornelia\r\nobtained the remains of Pompeius and had them carried to his Alban\r\nvilla and interred there.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 189: This line is from the Prometheus Loosed ([Greek:\r\nluomenos] λυόμενος) of Aeschylus which is lost.

It is said that the\r\nfather of Pompeius Magnus had a cook Menogenes, who was called Strabo,\r\nand that the name was given to Cn. Pompeius because he resembled his\r\ncook. However this may be, Cn. Pompeius adopted the name, and it\r\nappears on his coins and in the Fasti. He had a bad character and\r\nappears to have deserved it. (Drumann, _Geschichte Roms_, Pompeii, p.\r\n306.)

Sulla died in the\r\nconsulship of M. Æmilius Lepidus and Q.

Drumann observes (Pompeii, p. 345) that\r\nPlutarch incorrectly tells the story as if Pompeius was not present at\r\nthe attack of Lepidus on Rome (Appianus, _Civil Wars_, i. 107; Floras,\r\niii. 23): but Plutarch's narrative does not of necessity imply that\r\nPompeius was not there.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 222: See the Life of Brutus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 223: See the Life of Sertorius, and as to the conduct of\r\nPompeius in the war more particularly, chapter 12, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 224: Pro Consule was the title of a Roman general who was\r\nsent to a province with consular authority. It was not unusual to\r\nappoint a man Pro Consule who had not been 'consul.' The point of the\r\nreply lies in the form of the expression 'Pro Consule,' which was a\r\ntitle, as contrasted with 'Pro Consulibus,' which means 'instead of\r\nthe consuls, to displace the consuls.' The expression of L. Philippus\r\nis recorded by Cicero (_Pro Lege Manilia_, c. 21). Pompeius went to\r\nIberia B.C. 76.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 225: The death of Sertorius took place B.C. 72. As to the\r\ndeath of Perperna, see the Life of Sertorius, c. 26. The allusion to\r\nSicily will be explained by referring to c. 10; but there is nothing\r\nthere stated for which Pompeius needed to show any gratitude to\r\nPerperna. We may assume that Perperna left the island, because he\r\ncould not safely stay.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 226: The war in Spain was not quite settled by the death of\r\nPerperna. There was still some work left to do. Several towns held\r\nout, particularly in the country of the warlike Arevaci, who were on\r\nthe east coast of Spain. Pompeius burnt Uxama; and L. Afranius\r\nconducted the war with unsparing severity against the Calaguritani who\r\nmade a desperate resistance. (Floras, iii. 22.) The capture of their\r\ntown ended the war. Drumann, _Geschichte Roms_, Pompeii, p. 376.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 227: The history of the Servile war is in the Life of\r\nCrassus, c. 11, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 228: This was in B.C. 71. In B.C. 70 Pompeius was consul for\r\nthe first time with M. Licinius Crassus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 229: Sulla had not abolished the tribunitian office, but he\r\nhad deprived the tribunes of the chief part of their power. It does\r\nnot seem exactly certain what Sulla did. Appianus (_Civil Wars_, i.\r\n100) says 'that he weakened it very much and carried a law by which no\r\nman after being tribune could hold any other office.' Cicero (_De\r\nLegibus_, iii. 9) considers the extension of the tribunitian power as\r\nunavoidable, and as effected with the least mischief by being the work\r\nof Pompeius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 230: A Cornelia Lex, passed in the time of Sulla, made the\r\nJudices in the Judicia Publica eligible only out of the body of\r\nSenators. That the Senators had acted corruptly in the administration\r\nof justice, we have the authority of Cicero in one of his Verrine\r\norations (_In Verr._ A 1, 13 and 16). The measure for restoring the\r\nEquites to a share in the judicial functions was proposed by the\r\nprætor L. Aurelius Cotta, the uncle of C. Julius Cæsar, with the\r\napprobation of Pompeius and Cæsar, who were now acting in concert. The\r\ncharges of corruption which Cotta made against the Senate are recorded\r\nby Cicero (_In Verr._ iii. 96). The proposed law (rogatio), which was\r\ncarried, made the Judices eligible out of the Senators, Equites, and\r\nTribuni Ærarii, which three classes are mentioned by Cicero (_Ad\r\nAtticum_, i. 16) as represented by the Judices who sat on the trial of\r\nClodius. The purity of the administration of justice was not hereby\r\nimproved. Cicero, on the occasion of the trial of Clodius, speaks of\r\nall these classes having their dishonest representatives among the\r\njudices.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 231: Compare the Life of Crassus, c. 12.\r\n\r\nThe remarks at the end of the chapter may be useful to some men who\r\nwould meddle with matters political, when their only training has been\r\nin camps. Pompeius was merely a soldier, and had no capacity for civil\r\naffairs.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 232: The history of piracy in the Mediterranean goes as far\r\nback as the history of navigation. The numerous creeks and islands of\r\nthis inland sea offer favourable opportunities for piratical posts,\r\nand accordingly we read of pirates as early as we read of commerce by\r\nsea. (Thucydides, i. 5.) The disturbances in the Roman State had\r\nencouraged these freebooters in their depredations. Cæsar, when a\r\nyoung man, fell into their hands (Life of Cæsar, c. 1); and also P.\r\nClodius. The insecure state of Italy is shown by the fact of the\r\npirates even landing on the Italian coast, and seizing the Roman\r\nmagistrates, Sextilius and Bellienus. Cicero in his oration in favour\r\nof the Lex Manilia (c. 12, c. 17, &c.) gives some particulars of the\r\nexcesses of the pirates. Antonia, whom they carried off, was the\r\ndaughter of the distinguished orator, Marcus Antonius (Life of Marius,\r\nc. 44), who had been sent against the Cilician pirates B.C. 102, and\r\nhad a triumph for his victory over them. If Cicero alludes (_Pro Lege\r\nManilia_) to the capture of the daughter of Antonius, that probably\r\ntook place before B.C. 87, for in that year Antonius was put to death.\r\nBut Cicero speaks of the daughter of 'a prætor' being carried off from\r\nMisenum, and it is not improbable that he alludes to M. Antonius\r\nCreticus, prætor B.C. 75. If this explanation is correct, the Antonia\r\nwas the grand-daughter of the orator Antonius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 233: [Greek: stulides] στυλίδες. The meaning of this word is\r\nuncertain. [Greek: Stulis] Στυλίς is a diminutive of [Greek: stulos]\r\nστῦλος, and signifies a small pillar, or pole. It may be that which\r\ncarried the colours. But I do not profess to have translated the word,\r\nfor I do not know what is meant.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 234: From the places enumerated it appears that the pirates\r\nhad carried their ravages from the coast of Asia Minor to the shores\r\nof Greece and up the Ionian Sea as far as the entrance of the Gulf of\r\nAmbracia, now the Gulf of Arta, near the entrance of which Actium was\r\nsituated on the southern coast, and even to the Italian shores. The\r\ntemple of Juno Lacinia was on the south-eastern coast of Italy on a\r\npromontory, now called Capo delle Colonne, from the ruins of the\r\nancient temple. The noted temples of antiquity were filled with works\r\nof art and rich offerings, the gifts of pious devotees. Cicero (_Pro\r\nLege Manilia_), c. 18) speaks of the pirates as infesting even the Via\r\nAppia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 235: Not the mountain of that name, Kaltwasser remarks, but\r\na town of Lycia in Asia Minor, one of the headquarters of the pirates.\r\nStrabo (p. 671) places Olympus in Cilicia.

(Dion Cassius, 36. c.\r\n36, 37.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 267: I have kept the name Cyrnus, as it stands in the text\r\nof Plutarch, though it is probably, an error of the transcribers. The\r\nreal name Cyrus could not be unknown to Plutarch. In the text of\r\nAppianus (_Mithridatic War_, c. 103) the name is erroneously written\r\nCyrtus; in Dion Cassius, it is Cyrnus. The Cyrus, now the Cur, flows\r\nfrom the higher regions of the Caucasus through Iberia and Albania,\r\nand is joined by the Araxes, Aras, above the point where the united\r\nstream enters the Caspian on the west coast. The twelve mouths are\r\nmentioned by Appianus (c. 103). Compare Strabo, p. 491.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 268: In fact the Persians never subdued any of the mountain\r\ntribes within the nominal limits of their dominions; and the Caucasus\r\nwas indeed not even within the nominal limits.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Alexander soon quitted Hyrkania, which lies on the\r\nsouth-east coast of the Caspian; but when he was in Hyrkania he was\r\nstill a considerable distance from the Iberians. (Arrianus, iii. 23,\r\n&c.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 269: This is the Faz, or Reone, which enters the south-east\r\nangle of the Euxine in the country of the Colchi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 270: The Abas river is conjectured by some writers to be the\r\nAlazonius, which was the boundary between Iberia and Albania, The Abas\r\nis mentioned by Dion Cassius, 37. c. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 271: [Greek: epi tên tou thôrakos epiptuchên] ἐπὶ τὴν τοῦ\r\nθώρακος ἐπιπτυχήν Apparently some part of the coat of mail where there\r\nwas a fold to allow of the motion of the body. As to the battle see\r\nDion Cassius, 37. c. 3, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 272: Appianus (_Mithridatic War_, c. 103) says \"Among the\r\nhostages and the captives were found many women, who were wounded as\r\nmuch as the men; and they were supposed to be Amazons, whether it is\r\nthat some nation called Amazons borders on them, and they were then\r\ninvited to give aid, or that the barbarians in those parts call any\r\nwarlike women by the name of Amazons.\" The explanation of Appianus is\r\nprobably the true explanation. Instances of women serving as soldiers\r\nare not uncommon even in modern warfare. The story of a race of\r\nfighting women occurs in many ancient writers. The Amazons are first\r\nmentioned by Herodotus (iv. 110-116). There is a story of a hundred\r\narmed women being presented to Alexander (Arrian, vii. 13, &c., who\r\ngives his opinion about them). Strabo (p. 503) says that Theophanes,\r\nwho accompanied Pompeius in this campaign, places the Gelæ and Legæ\r\nbetween the Albanians and the Amazons. It is probable that the women\r\nof the mountain tribes of the Caucasus sometimes served in the field,\r\nand this at least may explain the story here told by Plutarch. The\r\nchief residence of the Amazons is placed in the plains of Themiscyra\r\non the Thermodon in Cappadocia. Plutarch in his confused notions of\r\ngeography appears to consider the Thermodon as a Caucasian river. He\r\nalso places them near the Leges, a name which resembles that of the\r\nLesghians, one of the present warlike tribes of the Caucasus. On\r\nantient medals the Amazons are represented with a short vest reaching\r\nto the knee, and one breast bare. Their arms were a crescent shield,\r\nthe bow and arrow, and the double axe, whence the name Amazonia was\r\nused as a distinctive appellation for that weapon (Amazonia securis,\r\nHorat. _Od._ iv. 4).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 273: The Caspian sea or lake was also called the Hyrkanian,\r\nfrom the province of Hyrkania which bordered on the south-east coast.\r\nThe first notice of this great lake is in Herodotus (i. 203).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 274: The Elymæi were mountaineers who occupied the\r\nmountainous region between Susiana and Media. Gordyene was in the most\r\nsouth-eastern part of Armenia. Tigranocerta was in Gordyene. Appianus\r\nsays that in his time Sophene and Gordyene composed the Less Armenia\r\n(_Mithridatic War_, c. 105). In the territory of Arbela, where the\r\ntown of Arbil now is, Alexander had defeated Darius, the last king of\r\nPersia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 275: Another Greek woman, as we may infer from the name. The\r\nstory of the surrender of the fort by Stratonike is told by Appianus\r\n(_Mithridatic War_, c. 107) with some additional particulars. Dion\r\nCassius (37. c. 7) names this fort Symphorium.\r\n\r\nThe narrative of Plutarch omits many circumstances in the campaigns of\r\nPompeius, which Appianus has described (c. 105, 106) a happening\r\nbetween the arrangement with Tigranes and the surrender of the fort by\r\nStratonike. Among these events was the war in Judæa and the capture of\r\nJerusalem. Pompeius entered the Holy of Holies in the Temple, into\r\nwhich only the high priest could enter, and that on certain occasions.\r\nJerusalem was taken B.C. 63 in the consulship of Cicero. The events of\r\nthis campaign are too confused to be reduced into chronological order.\r\nDrumann has attempted it (_Geschichte Roms_, Pompeii, p. 451, &c.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 276: Plutarch means the fort which he has mentioned in the\r\npreceding chapter without there giving it a name; the Symphorium of\r\nDion. It was on the river Lycus, not quite 200 stadia from Cabira\r\n(Strabo, 556), and was an impregnable place.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 277: [Greek: Hupomnêmata] Ὑπομνήματα: probably written in\r\nGreek, with which Mithridates was well acquainted. These valuable\r\nmemoirs were used by Theophanes in his history of the campaigns of\r\nPompeius. Theophanes was a native of Mitylene in Lesbos and\r\naccompanied Pompeius in several of his campaigns. He is often\r\nmentioned by Cicero (Cicero, _Ad Attic._, ii. 4, and the notes in the\r\nVariorum edition).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 278: The character of Mithridates is only known to us from\r\nhis enemies.

The word is\r\n[Greek: to imation] τὸ ιμάτιον, which ought to signify his vest or\r\ntoga. Some critics take it to mean a kind of handkerchief used by sick\r\npersons and those of effeminate habits; and they say it was also used\r\nby persons when travelling, as a cover for the head, which the Greeks\r\ncalled Theristerium. The same word is used in the passage (c. 7),\r\nwhere it is said that \"Sulla used to rise from his seat as Pompeius\r\napproached and take his vest from his head.\" Whatever may be the\r\nmeaning of the word here, Plutarch seems to say that this impudent\r\nfellow would take his seat at the table before the guests had arrived\r\nand leave his master to receive them.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 292: Drumann (_Geschichte Roms_, Pompeii, p. 53) observes\r\nthat \"Plutarch does not say that Pompeius built his house near his\r\ntheatre, but that he built it in addition to his theatre and at the\r\nsame time, as Donatus had perceived, De Urbe Roma, 3, 8, in Græv.\r\nThes. T. 3, p. 695.\" But Drumann is probably mistaken. There is no\r\ngreat propriety in the word [Greek: epholkion] ἐφόλκιον unless the\r\nhouse was near the theatre, and the word [Greek: paretektênato]\r\nπαρετεκτήνατο rather implies 'proximity,' than 'in addition to.'\r\n\r\nThis was the first permanent theatre that Rome had. It was built\r\npartly on the model of that of Mitylene and it was opened in the year\r\nB.C. 55. This magnificent theatre, which would accommodate 40,000\r\npeople, stood in the Campus Martius. It was built of stone with the\r\nexception of the scena, and ornamented with statues, which were placed\r\nthere under the direction of Atticus, who was a man of taste. Augustus\r\nembellished the theatre, and he removed thither the statue of\r\nPompeius, which up to that time had stood in the Curia where Cæsar was\r\nmurdered. The scena was burnt down in the time of Tiberius, who began\r\nto rebuild it; but it was not finished till the reign of Claudius.\r\nNero gilded the interior. The scena was again burnt in the beginning\r\nof the reign of Titus, who restored it again. The scena was again\r\nburnt in the reign of Philippus and a third time restored. (Drumann,\r\n_Geschichte Roms_, Pompeii, p. 521; Dion Cassius 39. c. 88, and the\r\nnotes of Reimarus.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 293: Petra, the capital of the Nabathæi, is about half way\r\nbetween the southern extremity of the Dead Sea and the northern\r\nextremity of the Ælanitic Gulf, the more eastern of the two northern\r\nbranches of the Red Sea. The ruins of Petra exist in the Wady Musa,\r\nand have been visited by Burckhardt, Irby and Mangles, and last by\r\nLaborde, who has given the most complete description of them in his\r\n'Voyage de l'Arabie Pétrée,' Paris, 1830. The place is in the midst of\r\na desert, but has abundance of water. Its position made it an\r\nimportant place of commerce in the caravan trade of the East; and it\r\nwas such in the time of Strabo, who states on the authority of his\r\nfriend Athonodorus that many Romans were settled there (p. 779). It\r\ncontains numerous tombs and a magnificent temple cut in the rock, a\r\ntheatre and the remains of houses.\r\n\r\nThe king against whom Pompeius was marching is named Aretas by Dion\r\nCassius (37. c. 15).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 294: The Pæonians were a Thracian people on the Strymon.\r\n(Herodotus, v. 1.) It appears from Dion Cassius (49. c. 36) that the\r\nGreeks often called the Pannonians by the name of Pæonians, which\r\nSintenis considers a reason for not altering the reading here into\r\nPannonians. Appianus (_Mithridatic War_, c. 102) uses the name\r\nPæonians, though he means Pannonians.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 295: This is the Roman word.

There might be some doubt about the meaning of the words\r\n'many corpses of members of the royal family' [Greek: polla sômata tôn\r\nbasilikôn] πολλα σώματα τῶν βασιλικῶν but Plutarch appears from the\r\ncontext to mean dead bodies. Two of the daughters of Mithridates who\r\nwere with him when he died, are mentioned by Appianus (c. 111) as\r\nhaving taken poison at the same time with their father. The poison\r\nworked on them, but had no effect on the old man, who therefore\r\nprevailed on a Gallic officer who was in his service to kill him.\r\n(Compare Dion Cassius, 39. c. 13, 14.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 299: He made it what the Romans called Libera Civitas, a\r\ncity which had its own jurisdiction and was free from taxes.

He was one of the masters of Cicero, who often\r\nspeaks of him and occasionally corresponded with him (Cicero, _Ad\r\nAttic._ ii. 1). Cicero also mentions Hermagoras in his treatise De\r\nInventione (i. 6, and 9), and in the Brutus (c. 79).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 301: See the Life of Sulla, c. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 302: She was the daughter of Q. Mucius Scævola, consul B.C.\r\n95, and the third wife of Pompeius, who had three children by her. She\r\nwas not the sister of Q. Metellus Nepos and Q. Metellus Celer, as\r\nKaltwasser says, but a kinswoman. Cn. Pompeius and Sextus Pompeius\r\nwere the sons of Mucia. Cicero (_Ad Attic._ i. 12) speaks of the\r\ndivorce of Mucia and says that it was approved of; but he does not\r\nassign the reason. C. Julius Cæsar (Suetonius, _Cæsar_, c. 50) is\r\nnamed as the adulterer or one of them, and Pompeius called him his\r\nÆgisthus. After her divorce in the year B.C. 62 Mucia married M.\r\nÆmilius Scaurus, the brother of the second wife of Pompeius. Mucia\r\nsurvived the battle of Actium (B.C. 31), and she was treated with\r\nrespect by Octavianus Cæsar (Dion Cassius, 51. c. 2; Drumann,\r\n_Geschichte Roms_, Pompeii, p. 557).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 303: Here and elsewhere I have used Plutarch's word [Greek:\r\nmonarchia] μοναρχία, 'The government of one man,' by which he means\r\nthe Dictatorship, in some passages at least.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 304: He landed in Italy B.C. 62, during the consulship of D.\r\nJunius Silanus and L. Licinius Murena. The request mentioned at the\r\nbeginning of c. 44 is also noticed in Plutarch's Life of Cato (c. 30).\r\nM. Pupius Piso was one of the consuls for B.C. 61.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 305: This was L. Afranius, one of the legati of Pompeius,\r\nwho has often been mentioned. He was consul with Q. Metellus Celer\r\nB.C. 60 (compare Dion Cassius, 37. c. 49). Cicero, who was writing to\r\nAtticus at the time (_Ad Attic._ i. 17), speaks of the bribery at the\r\nelection of Afranius, and accuses Pompeius of being active on the\r\noccasion. From this consulship Horatius (_Od._ ii. 1) dates the\r\ncommencement of the civil wars, for in this year was formed the\r\ncoalition between Cæsar, Pompeius, and Crassus. See the remark of\r\nCato, c. 47.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 306: Compare Appianus (_Mithridatic War_, c. 116) and\r\nDramann, _Geschichte Roms_, Pompeii, p. 485.

The appointment of Pompeius\r\nis mentioned by Dion Cassius (39. c. 9, and the notes of Reimarus).\r\nCicero (_Ad Atticum_, iv. 1) speaks of the appointment of Pompeius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 318: Ptolemæus Auletes had given large bribes to several\r\nRomans to purchase their influence and to get himself declared a\r\nfriend and ally of the Romans; which was in fact to put himself under\r\ntheir protection. His subjects were dissatisfied with him for various\r\nreasons, and among others for the heavy taxes which he laid on them to\r\nraise the bribe money. He made his escape from Egypt and was now in\r\nRome. The story is told at some length in Dion Cassius (39. c. 12,\r\n&c.), and the matter of the king's restoration is discussed by Cicero\r\nin several letters (_Ad Diversos_, i. 1-7) to this Spinther. The king\r\nfor the present did not get the aid which he wanted, and he retired to\r\nEphesus, where he lodged within the precincts of the temple of\r\nArtemis, which was an ASYLUM.

He burnt some of his historical writings, but not all\r\nof them, for Plutarch here refers to his authority. Horatius (1 _Ep_.\r\n19. v. 15) alludes to Timagenes.

In the notes to the life of Crassus, c. 16,\r\nI have incorrectly called this Tribune Titus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 325: Plutarch must mean that Crassus left Rome before the\r\nexpiration of his consulship B.C. 55; but the words [Greek: apallageis\r\ntês hupateias] ἀπαλλαγεὶς τῆς ὑπατείας are in themselves doubtful.\r\n(Life of Crassus, c. 16.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 326: Drumann (_Geschichte Roms_, Pompeii, p. 524) has\r\ndiligently collected all the circumstances of this magnificent\r\nexhibition. (See also Dion Cassius, 39. c. 38, and the references in\r\nthe notes of Reimarus.) The elephant-fight ([Greek: elphantomachia]\r\nἐλφαντομαχία) was a fight between the elephants and armed Gætulians.\r\nThere were eighteen elephants. The cries of the animals when they were\r\nwounded moved the pity of the spectators. The elephants would not\r\nenter the vessels when they were leaving Africa, till they received a\r\npromise from their leaders that they should not he injured; the\r\ntreacherous treatment of them at the games was the cause of their loud\r\nlamentations, in which they appealed to the deity against the\r\nviolation of the solemn promise. (Dion Cassius.) Cicero, who was not\r\nfond of exhibitions of the kind, speaks with disgust of the whole\r\naffair (_Ad Diversos_, vii. 1). The letter of Cicero, written at the\r\ntime, is valuable contemporary evidence. Various facts on the\r\nexhibition of elephants at Rome are collected in the Library of\r\nEntertaining Knowledge, _Menageries_, Elephant.\r\n\r\nA rhinoceros was also exhibited at the games of Pompeius; and an\r\nactress was brought on the stage, who had made her first appearance in\r\nthe consulship of C. Marius the younger, and Cn. Carbo B.C. 82, but\r\nshe made her appearance again in the time of Augustus, A.D. 9, in the\r\nconsulship of Poppæus, when she was 103 years old, 91 years after her\r\nfirst appearance. (Plinius, _H.N_. vii. 49.) Drumann says, when\r\nspeaking of the games of Pompeius, \"a woman of unusually advanced age\r\nwas brought forward;\" but the words of Plinius \"anus pro miraculo\r\nreducta,\" apply to her last appearance. A woman of one-and-forty was\r\nno uncommon thing then, nor is it now. The pointing in the common\r\ntexts is simply the cause of the blunder.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 327: See the Life of Crassus, c. 16, notes, Julia died B.C.\r\n54, in the consulship of L.

Valerius Messala, the\r\nconsuls of B.C. 53, were not elected till seven months after the\r\nproper time, so that there was during this time an anarchy [Greek:\r\nanarchia] ἀναρχία, which is Plutarch's word). This term 'anarchy' must\r\nbe taken in its literal and primary sense of a time when there were no\r\nmagistrates, which would be accompanied with anarchy in the modern\r\nsense of the term. Dion Cassius (40. c. 45) describes this period of\r\nconfusion. The translation in the text may lead to a misunderstanding\r\nof Plutarch's meaning; it should be, \"he allowed an anarchy to take\r\nplace.\" Kaltwasser's translation: \"so liess er es zu einer Anarchie\r\nkommen,\" is perfectly exact.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 330: In the year B.C. 52 in which year Clodius was killed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 331: She was the daughter of Q. Cæcilius Metellus Pius\r\nScipio, who was the son of P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica and of Licinia,\r\nthe daughter of the orator L. Crassus. He was adopted (B.C. 64 or 63)\r\nby the testament of Q. Cæcilius Metellus Pius, who fought in Spain\r\nngainst Sertorius; but his daughter must have been born before this,\r\nas she bore the name Cornelia. Drumann (_Geschichte Roms_, Cæcilii, p.\r\n49) thinks that the story of her attempting to destroy herself when\r\nshe heard of the death of her husband (Life of Pompeius, c. 74) is\r\nsuspicious, because she married Pompeius the year after. If Cornelia\r\nwere the only woman that was ever said to have done so, we might doubt\r\nthe story; but as she is not, we need not suspect it on that account.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 332: Corruption is [Greek: dorodokia] δοροδοκία in Plutarch,\r\n'gift receiving,' and it ought to correspond to the Roman Peculatus.\r\nBut [Greek: dorodokia] δοροδοκία also means corruption by bribes.\r\nBribery is [Greek: dekasmos] δεκασμός in Plutarch, which is expressed\r\ngenerally by the Roman Ambitus, and specially by the verb 'decuriare.'\r\n(See Cicero's Oration Pro Cn.

The illness of Pompeius and the return of the\r\nlegions from Gaul took place in the year B.C. 50. Appius Claudius (c.\r\n57) was sent by the Senate to conduct the legions from Gaul. Dion\r\nCassius (40. c. 65) says that Pompeius had lent Cæsar only one legion,\r\nbut that Cæsar had to give up another also, inasmuch as Pompeius\r\nobtained an order of the Senate that both he and Cæsar should give a\r\nlegion to Bibulus, who was in Syria, for the Parthian war. (Appianus,\r\n_Civil Wars_, ii. 29; _Bell. Gall._ viii. 54.) Thus Pompeius in effect\r\ngave up nothing, but Cæsar parted with two legions. The legions were\r\nnot sent to Syria, but both wintered in Capua. The consul C. Claudius\r\nMarcellus (B.C. 50) gave both these legions to Pompeius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 337: L.

The form of a Roman basilica is known\r\nfrom the description of Vitruvius (v. 1), the ground-plan of two\r\nBasilicæ at Rome, and that of Pompeii which is in better preservation.\r\nSome of the great Roman churches are called Basilicæ, and in their\r\nconstruction bear some resemblance to the antient Basilicæ.

In the Peloponnesian\r\nWar (B.C. 431) Perikles advised the Athenians to keep within their\r\nwalls and wait for the Cæsar invaders to retire from Attica for want\r\nof supplies; in which also the result justified the advice of\r\nPerikles.

Sintenis observes that\r\nOudendorp might have used this passage for the purpose of restoring\r\nthe true prænomen in Cæsar's text, 'Numerius' in place of 'Cneius.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 350: These vessels took their name from the Liburni, on the\r\ncoast of Illyricum.

It appears from this that Pompeius led his troops from the\r\ncoast of the Adriatic nearly to the opposite coast of Macedonia (Dion\r\nCassius, 41. c. 43). His object apparently was to form a junction with\r\nthe forces that Scipio and his son were sent to raise in the East (c.\r\n62).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 352: The Romans were accustomed to such exercises as these\r\nin the Campus Martius.\r\n\r\n                     ------\"cur apricum\r\n    Oderit campum patiens pulveris atque solis?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                     ------sæpe disco\r\n    Sæpe trans finem jaculo nobilis expedito.\"--Horatius, _Od_. i. 8.\r\n\r\nCompare the Life of Marius (34).\r\n\r\nThe Romans maintained their bodily vigour by athletic and military\r\nexercises to a late period of life. The bath, swimming, riding, and\r\nthe throwing of the javelin were the means by which they maintained\r\ntheir health and strength. A Roman commander at the age of sixty was a\r\nmore vigorous man than modern commanders at the like age generally\r\nare.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 353: Pompeius passed the winter at Thessalonica (Saloniki)\r\non the Thermaic Gulf and on the Via Egnatia, which ran from Dyrrachium\r\nto Thessalonica, and thence eastward. He had with him two hundred\r\nsenators. The consuls, prætors, and quæstors of the year B.C. 49 were\r\ncontinued by the Senate at Thessalonica for the year B.C. 48 under the\r\nnames of Proconsuls, Proprætors, Proquæstors. Cæsar and P. Servillus\r\nIsauricus were elected consuls at Rome for the year B.C. 48 (Life of\r\nCæsar, c. 37). The party of Pompeius could not appoint new magistrates\r\nfor want of the ceremony of a Lex Curiata (Dion Cassius, 41. c. 43).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 354: His name is Titus Labienus (Life of Cæsar, c. 34).\r\n'Labeo' is a mere blunder of the copyists. Dion Cassius (41. c. 4)\r\ngives the reasons for Labienus passing over to Pompeius. Labienus had\r\nserved Cæsar well in Gaul, and he is often mentioned in Cæsar's Book\r\non the Gallic War. He fell at the battle of Munda in Spain B.C. 45.\r\n(See the Life of Cæsar, c. 34, 56.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 355: M. Junius Brutus.

See the\r\nremarks on the time in Clinton, _Fasti_, B.C. 49. Oricum or Oricus was\r\na town on the coast of Epirus, south of Apollonia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 359: L. Vibillius Rufus appears to be the person intended.\r\nHe is often mentioned by Cæsar (_Civil War_, i. 15, 23, &c.); but as\r\nthe readings in Cæsar's text are very uncertain (Jubellius, Jubilius,\r\nJubulus) Sintenis has not thought it proper to alter the text of\r\nPlutarch here.\r\n\r\n'On the third day.' Cæsar (_Civil War_, iii. 10) says 'triduo\r\nproximo,\" and the correction of Moses du Soul, [Greek: hêmera rhêtê]\r\nἡμέρα ῥητῆ, is therefore unnecessary. Pompeius had moved westward from\r\nThessalonica at the time when Rufus was sent to him, and was in\r\nCandavia on his road to Apollonia and Dyrrachium (Cæsar, _Civil War_,\r\niii. 11).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 360: Pompeius returned to Dyrrachium, which it had been the\r\nobject of Cæsar to seize. As he had not accomplished this, Cæsar\r\nposted himself on the River Apsus between Apollonia and Dyrrachium.\r\nThe fights in the neighbourhood of Dyrrachium are described by Cæsar\r\n(_Civil War_, iii. 34, &c.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 361: The Athamanes were on the borders of Epirus and\r\nThessalia. In place of the Athamanes the MSS. of Cæsar (_Civil War_,\r\niii. 78) have Acarnania, which, as Drumann says, must be a mistake in\r\nthe text of Cæsar.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 362: Q.

Domitius\r\nAhenobarbus, consul B.C. 54. This affair is mentioned by Cæsar himself\r\n(_Civil War_, iii. 83, &c.). We have the best evidence of the bloody\r\nuse that the party of Pompeius would have made of their victory is the\r\nletters of Cicero himself (_Ad Atticum_, xi. 6). There was to be a\r\ngeneral proscription, and Rome was to see the times of Sulla revived.\r\nBut the courage and wisdom of one man defeated the designs of these\r\nsenseless nobles.

Gall._ ii. 20;\r\n_Bell. Hispan._ c. 28, _Bell. Alexandr._ c. 45). The 'hung out' is a\r\nbetter translation than 'unfurled.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 371: Plutarch in this as in some other instances places the\r\nPrænomen last, instead of first which he ought to do; but immediately\r\nafter he writes Lucius Domitius correctly. The error may be owing to\r\nthe copyists.\r\n\r\nThe order of the battle is described by Cæsar (_Civil War_, iii. 89).\r\nPlutarch here and in the Life of Cæsar (c. 44) says that Pompeius\r\ncommanded the right, but Cæsar says that he was on the left. Domitius,\r\nthat is, L. Domitius Ahenobarbus (Consul B.C. 54), may have commanded\r\nunder him. Cn. Domitius Calvinus (Consul B.C. 53), whom Plutarch calls\r\nCalvinus Lucius, commanded Cæsar's centre. The account of Appianus\r\n(_Civil Wars_, ii. 76) does not agree with Cæsar's.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 372: See Cæsar B.C. (iii. 88), and Appianus (ii. 79), who\r\nquotes Cæsar's letters.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 373: The whole number of Italian troops on both sides was\r\nabout 70,000, as Plutarch says in the next chapter. There were also\r\nother troops on both sides (Appianus, _Civil Wars_, ii. 70). The\r\nbattle was fought on the ninth of August, B.C. 48, according to the\r\nuncorrected calendar.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 374: Dion Cassius has some like reflections (41. c. 53-58);\r\nand Appianus (ii. 77), who says that both the commanders-in-chief shed\r\ntears; which we need not believe.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 375: Lucan, i. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 376: Crassinius, in the Life of Cæsar, c. 44.

Pelusium, on the eastern branch of the Nile, had\r\nfor many centuries been the strong point on this frontier. (Cæsar,\r\n_Civil War_, iii. 103; Dion Cassius, 42. c. 3, &c.) Pompeius\r\napproached the shore of Egypt with several vessels and about 2000\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nAs to the circumstances in this chapter, compare Dion Cassius (42. c.\r\n3), Appianus (_Civil Wars_, ii. 84), and Cæsar (_Civil War_, iii.\r\n104). Cæsar simply mentions the assassination of Pompeius. He says no\r\nmore about it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 392: The death of Pompeius is mentioned by Cicero (_Ad\r\nAtticum_, xi. 6). As to his age, Drumann observes, \"He was born B.C.\r\n106, and was consequently 58 years old when he was killed, on the 29th\r\nof September, or on the day before his birthday, about the time of the\r\nautumnal equinox according to the unreformed calendar.\" (Lucanus, viii\r\n467.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 393: He is called Cordus by Lucanus (viii. 715), and had\r\nformerly been a quæstor of Pompeius.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF AGESILAUS AND POMPEIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. As both these men's lives are now before us, let us briefly\r\nrecapitulate them, observing as we do so the points in which they\r\ndiffer from one another. These are as follows:--First, Pompeius\r\nobtained his power and renown by the most strictly legitimate means,\r\nchiefly by his own exertions when assisting Sulla in the liberation of\r\nItaly; while Agesilaus obtained the throne in defiance of both human\r\nand divine laws, for he declared Leotychides to be a bastard, although\r\nhis brother had publicly recognised him as his own son, and he also by\r\na quibble evaded the oracle about a lame reign.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Pompeius both respected Sulla while he lived, gave his body\r\nan honourable burial, in spite of Lepidus, when he died, and married\r\nSulla's daughter to his own son Faustus; while Agesilaus, on a\r\ntrifling pretext, disgraced and ruined Lysander. Yet Sulla gave\r\nPompeius nothing more than he possessed himself, whereas Lysander made\r\nAgesilaus king of Sparta, and leader of the united armies of Greece.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the political wrong-doings of Pompeius were chiefly committed\r\nto serve his relatives, Cæsar and Scipio; while Agesilaus saved\r\nSphodrias from the death which he deserved for his outrage upon the\r\nAthenians merely to please his son, and vigorously supported Phœbidas\r\nwhen he committed a similar breach of the peace against the Thebans.\r\nAnd generally, we may say that while Pompeius only injured the Romans\r\nthrough inability to refuse the demands of friends, or through\r\nignorance, Agesilaus ruined the Lacedæmonians by plunging them into\r\nwar with Thebes, to gratify his own angry and quarrelsome temper.\r\n\r\nII. If it be right to attribute the disasters which befel either of\r\nthose men to some special ill-luck which attended them, the Romans had\r\nno reason whatever to suspect any such thing of Pompeius; but\r\nAgesilaus, although the Lacedæmonians well knew the words of the\r\noracle, yet would not allow them to avoid \"a lame reign.\" Even if\r\nLeotychides had been proved a thousand times to be a bastard, the\r\nfamily of Eurypon could have supplied Sparta with a legitimate and\r\nsound king, had not Lysander, for the sake of Agesilaus, deceived them\r\nas to the true meaning of the oracle. On the other hand, we have no\r\nspecimen of the political ingenuity of Pompeius which can be compared\r\nwith that admirable device of Agesilaus, when he readmitted the\r\nsurvivors of the battle of Leuktra to the privileges of Spartan\r\ncitizens, by permitting the laws to sleep for one day. Pompeius did\r\nnot even think it his duty to abide by the laws which he had himself\r\nenacted, but broke them to prove his great power to his friends.\r\nAgesilaus, when forced either to abolish the laws or to ruin his\r\nfriends, discovered an expedient by which the laws did his friends no\r\nhurt, and yet had not to be abolished in order to save them. I also\r\nplace to the credit of Agesilaus that unparalleled act of obedience,\r\nwhen on receiving a despatch from Sparta he abandoned the whole of his\r\nAsian enterprise. For Agesilaus did not, like Pompeius, enrich the\r\nstate by his own exploits, but looking solely to the interests of his\r\ncountry, he gave up a position of greater glory and power than any\r\nGreek before or since ever held, with the single exception of\r\nAlexander.\r\n\r\nIII. Looking at them from another point of view, I suppose that even\r\nXenophon himself would not think of comparing the number of the\r\nvictories won by Pompeius, the size of the armies which he commanded,\r\nand that of those which he defeated, with any of the victories of\r\nAgesilaus; although Xenophon has written so admirably upon other\r\nsubjects, that he seems to think himself privileged to say whatever he\r\npleases about the life of his favourite hero. I think also that the\r\ntwo men differ much in their treatment of their enemies. The Greek\r\nwished to sell the Thebans for slaves, and to drive the Messenians\r\nfrom their country, although Thebes was the mother city of Sparta,\r\nand the Messenians sprang from the same stock as the Lacedæmonians. In\r\nhis attempts to effect this, he all but lost Sparta herself, and did\r\nlose the Spartan empire; while Pompeius even gave cities to be\r\ninhabited by such of the Mediterranean pirates as abandoned that mode\r\nof life; and when Tigranes the king of Armenia was in his power, he\r\ndid not lead him in his triumph, but chose rather to make him an ally\r\nof Rome; observing, that he preferred an advantage which would last\r\nfor all time to the glory which only endured for a single day.\r\n\r\nIf, however, we place the chief glory of a general in feats of arms\r\nand strategy, the Laconian will be found greatly to excel the Roman.\r\nAgesilaus did not abandon Sparta even when it was attacked by seventy\r\nthousand men, when he had but few troops with which to defend it, and\r\nthose too all disheartened by their recent defeat at Leuktra.\r\nPompeius, on hearing that Cæsar, with only five thousand three hundred\r\nmen, had taken a town in Italy, left Rome in terror, either yielding\r\nto this small force like a coward, or else falsely supposing it to be\r\nmore numerous than it was. He carefully carried off his own wife and\r\nchildren, but left the families of his partizans unprotected in Rome,\r\nwhen he ought either to have fought for the city against Cæsar, or\r\nelse to have acknowledged him as his superior and submitted to him,\r\nfor Cæsar was both his fellow-countryman and his relative. Yet, after\r\nhaving violently objected to the prorogation of Cæsar's term of office\r\nas consul, he put it in his power to capture Rome itself, and to say\r\nto Metellus that he regarded him and all the rest of the citizens as\r\nprisoners of war.\r\n\r\nIV. Agesilaus, when he was the stronger, always forced his enemy to\r\nfight, and when weaker, always avoided a battle. By always practising\r\nthis, the highest art of a general, he passed through his life without\r\na single defeat; whereas Pompeius was unable to make use of his\r\nsuperiority to Cæsar by sea, and was forced by him to hazard\r\neverything on the event of a land battle; for as soon as Cæsar had\r\ndefeated him, he at once obtained possession of all Pompeius's\r\ntreasure, supplies, and command of the sea, without gaining which he\r\nmust inevitably have been defeated, even without a battle. Pompeius's\r\nexcuse for his conduct is, in truth, his severest condemnation. It is\r\nvery natural and pardonable for a young general to be influenced by\r\nclamours and accusations of remissness and cowardice, so as to abandon\r\nthe course which he had previously decided upon as the safest; but\r\nthat the great Pompeius, of whom the Romans used to say that the camp\r\nwas his home, and that he only made an occasional campaign in the\r\nsenate house, at a time when his followers called the consuls and\r\ngenerals of Rome traitors and rebels, and when they knew that he was\r\nin possession of absolute uncontrolled power, and had already\r\nconducted so many campaigns with such brilliant success as\r\ncommander-in-chief--that he should be moved by the scoffs of a\r\nFavonius or a Domitius, and hazard his army and his life lest they\r\nshould call him Agamemnon, is a most discreditable supposition. If he\r\nwere so sensitive on the point of honour, he ought to have made a\r\nstand at the very beginning, and fought a battle in defence of Rome,\r\nnot first to have retreated, giving out that he was acting with a\r\nsubtlety worthy of Themistokles himself, and then to have regarded\r\nevery day spent in Thessaly without fighting as a disgrace. The plain\r\nof Pharsalia was not specially appointed by heaven as the arena in\r\nwhich he was to contend with Cæsar for the empire of the world, nor\r\nwas he summoned by the voice of a herald either to fight or to avow\r\nhimself vanquished. There were many plains, and innumerable cities and\r\ncountries which his command of the sea would have enabled him to\r\nreach, if he had wished to imitate Fabius Maximus, Marius, Lucullus,\r\nor Agesilaus himself, who resisted the same kind of clamour at Sparta,\r\nwhen his countrymen wished to fight the Thebans and protect their\r\nnative land; while in Egypt he endured endless reproaches, abuse, and\r\nsuspicion from Nektanebis because he forbade him to fight, and by\r\nconsistently carrying out his own judicious policy saved the Egyptians\r\nagainst their will. He not only guided Sparta safely through that\r\nterrible crisis, but was enabled to win a victory over the Thebans in\r\nthe city itself, which he never could have done had he yielded to the\r\nentreaties of the Lacedæmonians to fight when their country was first\r\ninvaded. Thus it happened that Agesilaus was warmly praised by those\r\nwhose opinions he had overruled, while Pompeius made mistakes to\r\nplease his friends, and afterwards was reproached by them for what he\r\nhad done. Some historians tell us, however, that he was deceived by\r\nhis father-in-law, Scipio, who with the intention of embezzling and\r\nconverting to his own use the greater part of the treasure which\r\nPompeius brought from Asia, urged him to fight as soon as possible, as\r\nthough there was likely to be a scarcity of money. In these respects,\r\nthen, we have reviewed their respective characters.\r\n\r\nV. Pompeius went to Egypt of necessity, fleeing for his life; but\r\nAgesilaus went there with the dishonourable purpose of acting as\r\ngeneral for the barbarians, in order that he might employ the money\r\nwhich he earned by that means in making war upon the Greeks. We blame\r\nthe Egyptians for their conduct to Pompeius; but the Egyptians have\r\nequal reason to complain of the conduct of Agesilaus towards\r\nthemselves; for though Pompeius trusted them and was betrayed, yet\r\nAgesilaus deserted the man who trusted him, and joined the enemies of\r\nthose whom he went out to assist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF ALEXANDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. In writing the Lives of Alexander the Great and of Cæsar the\r\nconqueror of Pompeius, which are contained in this book, I have before\r\nme such an abundance of materials, that I shall make no other preface\r\nthan to beg the reader, if he finds any of their famous exploits\r\nrecorded imperfectly, and with large excisions, not to regard this as\r\na fault. I am writing biography, not history; and often a man's most\r\nbrilliant actions prove nothing as to his true character, while some\r\ntrifling incident, some casual remark or jest, will throw more light\r\nupon what manner of man he was than the bloodiest battle, the greatest\r\narray of armies, or the most important siege. Therefore, just as\r\nportrait painters pay most attention to those peculiarities of the\r\nface and eyes, in which the likeness consists, and care but little for\r\nthe rest of the figure, so it is my duty to dwell especially upon\r\nthose actions which reveal the workings of my heroes' minds, and from\r\nthese to construct the portraits of their respective lives, leaving\r\ntheir battles and their great deeds to be recorded by others.\r\n\r\nII. All are agreed that Alexander was descended on his father's side\r\nfrom Herakles through Karanus, and on his mother's from Æakus through\r\nNeoptolemus.\r\n\r\nWe are told that Philip and Olympias first met during their initiation\r\ninto the sacred mysteries at Samothrace, and that he, while yet a boy,\r\nfell in love with the orphan girl, and persuaded her brother Arymbas\r\nto consent to their marriage. The bride, before she consorted with her\r\nhusband, dreamed that she had been struck by a thunderbolt, from which\r\na sheet of flame sprang out in every direction, and then suddenly died\r\naway. Philip himself some time after his marriage dreamed that he set\r\na seal upon his wife's body, on which was engraved the figure of a\r\nlion. When he consulted the soothsayers as to what this meant, most of\r\nthem declared the meaning to be, that his wife required more careful\r\nwatching; but Aristander of Telmessus declared that she must be\r\npregnant, because men do not seal up what is empty, and that she would\r\nbear a son of a spirited and lion-like disposition. Once Philip found\r\nhis wife asleep, with a large tame snake stretched beside her; and\r\nthis, it is said, quite put an end to his passion for her, and made\r\nhim avoid her society, either because he feared the magic arts of his\r\nwife, or else from a religious scruple, because his place was more\r\nworthily filled. Another version of this story is that the women of\r\nMacedonia have been from very ancient times subject to the Orphic and\r\nBacchic frenzy (whence they were called Clodones and Mimallones), and\r\nperform the same rites as do the Edonians and the Thracian women about\r\nMount Haemus, from which the word \"threskeuein\" has come to mean \"to\r\nbe over-superstitious.\" Olympias, it is said, celebrated these rites\r\nwith exceeding fervour, and in imitation of the Orientals, and to\r\nintroduce into the festal procession large tame serpents,[394] which\r\nstruck terror into the men as they glided through the ivy wreaths and\r\nmystic baskets which the women carried on their heads.\r\n\r\nIII. We are told that Philip after this portent sent Chairon of\r\nMegalopolis to Delphi, to consult the god there, and that he delivered\r\nan oracular response bidding him sacrifice to Zeus Ammon, and to pay\r\nespecial reverence to that god: warning him, moreover, that he would\r\nsome day lose the sight of that eye with which, through the chink of\r\nthe half-opened door, he had seen the god consorting with his wife in\r\nthe form of a serpent. The historian Eratosthenes informs us that when\r\nAlexander was about to set out on his great expedition, Olympias told\r\nhim the secret of his birth, and bade him act worthily of his divine\r\nparentage. Other writers say that she scrupled to mention the subject,\r\nand was heard to say \"Why does Alexander make Hera jealous of me?\"\r\n\r\nAlexander was born on the sixth day of the month Hekatombæon,[395]\r\nwhich the Macedonians call Lous, the same day on which the temple of\r\nArtemis at Ephesus was burned. This coincidence inspired Hegesias of\r\nMagnesia to construct a ponderous joke, dull enough to have put out\r\nthe fire, which was, that it was no wonder that the temple of Artemis\r\nwas burned, since she was away from, it, attending to the birth of\r\nAlexander.[396] All the Persian magi who were in Ephesus at the time\r\nimagined that the destruction of the temple was but the forerunner of\r\na greater disaster, and ran through the city beating their faces and\r\nshouting that on that day was born the destroyer of Asia. Philip, who\r\nhad just captured the city of Potidæa, received at that time three\r\nmessengers. The first announced that the Illyrians had been severely\r\ndefeated by Parmenio; the second that his racehorse had won a victory\r\nat Olympia, and the third, that Alexander was born. As one may well\r\nbelieve, he was delighted at such good news and was yet more overjoyed\r\nwhen the soothsayers told him that his son, whose birth coincided with\r\nthree victories, would surely prove invincible.\r\n\r\nIV. His personal appearance is best shown by the statues of Lysippus,\r\nthe only artist whom he allowed to represent him; in whose works we\r\ncan clearly trace that slight droop of his head towards the left, and\r\nthat keen glance of his eyes which formed his chief characteristics,\r\nand which were afterwards imitated by his friends and successors.\r\n\r\nApelles, in his celebrated picture of Alexander wielding a\r\nthunderbolt, has not exactly copied the fresh tint of his flesh, but\r\nhas made it darker and swarthier than it was, for we are told that his\r\nskin was remarkably fair, inclining to red about the face and breast.\r\nWe learn from the memoirs of Aristoxenes, that his body diffused a\r\nrich perfume, which scented his clothes, and that his breath was\r\nremarkably sweet. This was possibly caused by the hot and fiery\r\nconstitution of his body; for sweet scents are produced, according to\r\nTheophrastus, by heat acting upon moisture. For this reason the\r\nhottest and driest regions of the earth produce the most aromatic\r\nperfumes, because the sun dries up that moisture which causes most\r\nsubstances to decay.\r\n\r\nAlexander's warm temperament of body seems to have rendered him fond\r\nof drinking, and fiery in disposition. As a youth he showed great\r\npower of self-control, by abstaining from all sensual pleasures in\r\nspite of his vehement and passionate nature; while his intense desire\r\nfor fame rendered him serious and high-minded beyond his years.\r\n\r\nFor many kinds of glory, however, Alexander cared little; unlike his\r\nfather Philip, who prided himself on his oratorical powers, and used\r\nto record his victories in the chariot races at Olympia upon his\r\ncoins. Indeed, when Alexander's friends, to try him, asked him whether\r\nhe would contend in the foot race at Olympia, for he was a remarkably\r\nswift runner, he answered, \"Yes, if I have kings to contend with.\" He\r\nseems to have been altogether indifferent to athletic exercises; for\r\nthough he gave more prizes than any one else to be contended for by\r\ndramatists, flute players, harp players, and even by rhapsodists,[397]\r\nand though he delighted in all manner of hunting and cudgel playing,\r\nhe never seems to have taken any interest in the contests of boxing or\r\nthe pankratium.[398] When ambassadors from the King of Persia arrived\r\nin Macedonia, Philip was absent, and Alexander entertained them. His\r\nengaging manners greatly charmed them, and he became their intimate\r\nfriend. He never put any childish questions to them, but made many\r\nenquiries about the length of the journey from the sea coast to the\r\ninterior of Persia, about the roads which led thither, about the king,\r\nwhether he was experienced in war or not, and about the resources and\r\nmilitary strength of the Persian empire, so that the ambassadors were\r\nfilled with admiration, and declared that the boasted subtlety of\r\nPhilip was nothing in comparison with the intellectual vigour and\r\nenlarged views of his son. Whenever he heard of Philip's having taken\r\nsome city or won some famous victory, he used to look unhappy at the\r\nnews, and would say to his friends, \"Boys, my father will forestall us\r\nin everything; he will leave no great exploits for you and me to\r\nachieve.\" Indeed, he cared nothing for pleasure or wealth, but only\r\nfor honour and glory; and he imagined that the more territory he\r\ninherited from his father, the less would be left for him to conquer.\r\nHe feared that his father's conquests would be so complete, as to\r\nleave him no more battles to fight, and he wished to succeed, not to a\r\nwealthy and luxurious, but to a military empire, at the head of which\r\nhe might gratify his desire for war and adventure.\r\n\r\nHis education was superintended by many nurses, pedagogues, and\r\nteachers, the chief of whom was Leonidas, a harsh-tempered man, who\r\nwas nearly related to Olympias. He did not object to the title of\r\npedagogue,[399] thinking that his duties are most valuable and\r\nhonourable, but, on account of his high character and relationship to\r\nAlexander, was generally given the title of tutor by the others. The\r\nname and office of pedagogue was claimed by one Lysimachus, an\r\nAkarnanian by birth, and a dull man, but who gained the favour of\r\nAlexander by addressing him as Achilles, calling himself Phœnix, and\r\nPhilip, Peleus.\r\n\r\nVI. When Philoneikus the Thessalian brought the horse Boukephalus[400]\r\nand offered it to Philip for the sum of thirteen talents, the king and\r\nhis friends proceeded to some level ground to try the horse's paces.\r\nThey found that he was very savage and unmanageable, for he allowed no\r\none to mount him, and paid no attention to any man's voice, but\r\nrefused to allow any one to approach him. On this Philip became\r\nangry, and bade them take the vicious intractable brute away.\r\nAlexander, who was present, said, \"What a fine horse they are ruining\r\nbecause they are too ignorant and cowardly to manage him.\" Philip at\r\nfirst was silent, but when Alexander repeated this remark several\r\ntimes, and seemed greatly distressed, he said, \"Do you blame your\r\nelders, as if you knew more than they, or were better able to manage a\r\nhorse?\" \"This horse, at any rate,\" answered Alexander, \"I could manage\r\nbetter than any one else.\" \"And if you cannot manage him,\" retorted\r\nhis father, \"what penalty will you pay for your forwardness?\" \"I will\r\npay,\" said Alexander, \"the price of the horse.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the others were laughing and settling the terms of the wager,\r\nAlexander ran straight up to the horse, took him by the bridle, and\r\nturned him to the sun; as it seems he had noticed that the horse's\r\nshadow dancing before his eyes alarmed him and made him restive. He\r\nthen spoke gently to the horse, and patted him on the back with his\r\nhand, until he perceived that he no longer snorted so wildly, when,\r\ndropping his cloak, he lightly leaped upon his back. He now steadily\r\nreined him in, without violence or blows, and as he saw that the horse\r\nwas no longer ill-tempered, but only eager to gallop, he let him go,\r\nboldly urging him to full speed with his voice and heel.\r\n\r\nPhilip and his friends were at first silent with terror; but when he\r\nwheeled the horse round, and rode up to them exulting in his success,\r\nthey burst into a loud shout. It is said that his father wept for joy,\r\nand, when he dismounted, kissed him, saying, \"My son, seek for a\r\nkingdom worthy of yourself: for Macedonia will not hold you.\"\r\n\r\nVII. Philip, seeing that his son was easily led, but could not be made\r\nto do anything by force, used always to manage him by persuasion, and\r\nnever gave him orders. As he did not altogether care to entrust his\r\neducation to the teachers whom he had obtained, but thought that it\r\nwould be too difficult a task for them, since Alexander required, as\r\nSophokles says of a ship:\r\n\r\n     \"Stout ropes to check him, and stout oars to guide.\"\r\n\r\nhe sent for Aristotle, the most renowned philosopher of the age, to\r\nbe his son's tutor, and paid him a handsome reward for doing so. He\r\nhad captured and destroyed Aristotle's native city of Stageira; but\r\nnow he rebuilt it, and repeopled it, ransoming the citizens, who had\r\nbeen, sold for slaves, and bringing back those who were living in\r\nexile. For Alexander and Aristotle he appointed the temple and grove\r\nof the nymphs, near the city of Mieza, as a school-house and dwelling;\r\nand there to this day are shown the stone seat where Aristotle sat,\r\nand the shady avenues where he used to walk. It is thought that\r\nAlexander was taught by him not only his doctrines of Morals and\r\nPolitics, but also those more abstruse mysteries which are only\r\ncommunicated orally and are kept concealed from the vulgar: for after\r\nhe had invaded Asia, hearing that Aristotle had published some\r\ntreatises on these subjects, he wrote him a letter in which he\r\ndefended the practice of keeping these speculations secret in the\r\nfollowing words:--\r\n\r\n\"Alexander to Aristotle wishes health. You have not done well in\r\npublishing abroad those sciences which should only be taught by word\r\nof mouth. For how shall we be distinguished from other men, if the\r\nknowledge which we have acquired be made the common property of all? I\r\nmyself had rather excel others in excellency of learning than in\r\ngreatness of power. Farewell.\"\r\n\r\nTo pacify him, Aristotle wrote in reply that these doctrines were\r\npublished, and yet not published: meaning that his treatise on\r\nMetaphysics was only written for those who had been instructed in\r\nphilosophy by himself, and would be quite useless in other hands.\r\n\r\nVIII. I think also that Aristotle more than any one else implanted a\r\nlove of medicine in Alexander, who was not only fond of discussing the\r\ntheory, but used to prescribe for his friends when they were sick, and\r\norder them to follow special courses of treatment and diet, as we\r\ngather from his letters. He was likewise fond of literature and of\r\nreading, and we are told by Onesikritus that he was wont to call the\r\nIliad a complete manual of the military art, and that he always\r\ncarried with him Aristotle's recension of Homer's poems, which is\r\ncalled 'the casket copy,' and placed it under his pillow together\r\nwith his dagger. Being without books when in the interior of Asia, he\r\nordered Harpalus to send him some. Harpalus sent him the histories of\r\nPhilistus, several plays of Euripides, Sophokles, and Æschylus, and\r\nthe dithyrambic hymns of Telestus and Philoxenus.\r\n\r\nAlexander when a youth used to love and admire Aristotle more even\r\nthan his father, for he said that the latter had enabled him to live,\r\nbut that the former had taught him to live well. He afterwards\r\nsuspected him somewhat; yet he never did him any injury, but only was\r\nnot so friendly with him as he had been, whereby it was observed that\r\nhe no longer bore him the good-will he was wont to do. Notwithstanding\r\nthis, he never lost that interest in philosophical speculation which\r\nhe had acquired in his youth, as it proved by the honours which he\r\npaid to Anaxarchus, the fifty talents which he sent as a present to\r\nXenokrates, and the protection and encouragement which he gave to\r\nDandamris and Kalanus.\r\n\r\nIX. When Philip was besieging Byzantium he left to Alexander, who was\r\nthen only sixteen years old, the sole charge of the administration of\r\nthe kingdom of Macedonia, confirming his authority by entrusting to\r\nhim his own signet.[401] He defeated and subdued the Mædian[402]\r\nrebels, took their city, ejected its barbarian inhabitants, and\r\nreconstituted it as a Grecian colony, to which he gave the name of\r\nAlexandropolis.\r\n\r\nHe was present at the battle against the Greeks at Chæronea, and it is\r\nsaid to have been the first to charge the Sacred Band of the Thebans.\r\nEven in my own time, an old oak tree used to be pointed out, near the\r\nriver Kephissus,[403] which was called Alexander's oak, because his\r\ntent was pitched beside it. It stands not far from the place where the\r\nMacedonian corpses were buried after the battle. Philip, as we may\r\nimagine, was overjoyed at these proofs of his son's courage and\r\nskill, and nothing pleased him more than to hear the Macedonians call\r\nAlexander their king, and himself their general. Soon, however, the\r\ndomestic dissensions produced by Philip's amours and marriages caused\r\nan estrangement between them, and the breach was widened by Olympias,\r\na jealous and revengeful woman, who incensed Alexander against his\r\nfather. But what especially moved Alexander was the conduct of Attalus\r\nat the marriage feast of his niece Kleopatra. Philip, who was now too\r\nold for marriage, had become enamoured of this girl, and after the\r\nwedding, Attalus in his cups called upon the Macedonians to pray to\r\nthe gods that from the union of Philip and Kleopatra might be born a\r\nlegitimate heir to the throne.\r\n\r\nEnraged at these words, Alexander exclaimed, \"You villain, am I then a\r\nbastard?\" and threw a drinking cup at him. Philip, seeing this, rose\r\nand drew his sword to attack Alexander; but fortunately for both he\r\nwas so excited by drink and rage that he missed his footing and fell\r\nheadlong to the ground. Hereupon Alexander mocking him observed, \"This\r\nis the man who was preparing to cross from Europe to Asia, and has\r\nbeen overthrown in passing from one couch[404] to another.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this disgraceful scene, Alexander, with his mother Olympias,\r\nretired into Epirus, where he left her, and proceeded to the country\r\nof the Illyrians. About the same time Demaratus of Corinth, an old\r\nfriend of the family, and privileged to speak his mind freely, came on\r\na visit to Philip. After the first greetings were over, Philip\r\nenquired whether the states of Greece agreed well together. \"Truly,\r\nKing Philip,\" answered Demaratus, \"it well becomes you to show an\r\ninterest in the agreement of the Greeks, after you have raised such\r\nviolent quarrels in your own family.\"\r\n\r\nThese words had such an effect upon Philip that Demaratus was able to\r\nprevail upon him to make his peace with Alexander and to induce him to\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nX. Yet when Pixodarus, the satrap of Karia, hoping to connect himself\r\nwith Philip, and so to obtain him as an ally, offered his eldest\r\ndaughter in marriage to Arrhidæus, Philip's natural son, and sent\r\nAristokrites to Macedonia to conduct the negotiations, Olympias and\r\nher friends again exasperated Alexander against his father by pointing\r\nout to him that Philip, by arranging this splendid marriage for\r\nArrhidæus, and treating him as a person of such great importance, was\r\nendeavouring to accustom the Macedonians to regard him as the heir to\r\nthe throne. Alexander yielded to these representations so far as to\r\nsend Thessalus, the tragic actor, on a special mission to Pixodarus in\r\nKaria, to assure him that he ought to disregard Arrhidæus, who was\r\nillegitimate, and foolish to boot, and that it was to Alexander that\r\nhe ought to offer the hand of his daughter.\r\n\r\nPixodarus was much more eager to accept this proposal than the former,\r\nbut Philip one day hearing that Alexander was alone in his chamber,\r\nwent thither with Philotas, the son of Parmenio, an intimate friend,\r\nand bitterly reproached him, pointing out how unworthy it was of his\r\nhigh birth and glorious position to stoop to marry the daughter of a\r\nmere Karian,[405] and of a barbarian who was a subject of the King of\r\nPersia.\r\n\r\nUpon this he wrote to the Corinthians to send him Thessalus in chains,\r\nand also banished out of his kingdom Harpalus, Nearchus, Erigyius, and\r\nPtolemæus, all of whom Alexander afterwards brought back and promoted\r\nto great honours.\r\n\r\nShortly after this, Pausanias was grossly insulted by the contrivance\r\nof Attalus and Kleopatra, and, as he could not obtain amends for what\r\nhe suffered, assassinated Philip. We are told that most men laid the\r\nblame of this murder upon Queen Olympias, who found the young man\r\nsmarting from the outrage which had been committed upon him, and urged\r\nhim to avenge himself, while some accused Alexander himself. It is\r\nsaid that when Pausanias came to him and complained of his treatment,\r\nAlexander answered him by quoting the line from the Medea of\r\nEuripides, in which she declares that she will be revenged upon\r\n\r\n     \"The guardian, and the bridegroom, and the bride,\"\r\n\r\nalluding to Attalus, Philip, and Kleopatra.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, it is certain that he sought out and punished all\r\nwho were concerned in the plot, and he expressed his sorrow on\r\ndiscovering that during his own absence from the kingdom, Kleopatra\r\nhad been cruelly tortured and put to death by his mother Olympias.\r\n\r\nXI. At the age of twenty he succeeded to the throne of Macedonia, a\r\nperilous and unenviable inheritance: for the neighbouring barbarian\r\ntribes chafed at being held in bondage, and longed for the rule of\r\ntheir own native kings; while Philip, although he had conquered Greece\r\nby force of arms, yet had not had time to settle its government and\r\naccustom it to its new position. He had overthrown all constituted\r\nauthority in that country, and had left men's minds in an excited\r\ncondition, eager for fresh changes and revolutions. The Macedonians\r\nwere very sensible of the dangerous crisis through which they were\r\npassing, and hoped that Alexander would refrain as far as possible\r\nfrom interfering in the affairs of Greece, deal gently with the\r\ninsurgent chiefs of his barbarian subjects, and carefully guard\r\nagainst revolutionary outbreaks. He, however, took quite a different\r\nview of the situation, conceiving it to be best to win safety by\r\naudacity, and carrying things with a high hand, thinking that if he\r\nshowed the least sign of weakness, his enemies would all set upon him\r\nat once. He crushed the risings of the barbarians by promptly marching\r\nthrough their country as far as the river Danube, and by winning a\r\nsignal victory over Syrmus, the King of the Triballi. After this, as\r\nhe heard that the Thebans had revolted, and that the Athenians\r\nsympathised with them, he marched his army straight through\r\nThermopylæ, with the remark that Demosthenes, who had called him a boy\r\nwhile he was fighting the Illyrians and Triballi, and a youth while he\r\nwas marching through Thessaly, should find him a man when he saw him\r\nbefore the gates of Athens. When he reached Thebes, he gave the\r\ncitizens an opportunity to repent of their conduct, only demanding\r\nPhœnix and Prothytes to be given up to him, and offering the rest a\r\nfree pardon if they would join him. When, however, the Thebans in\r\nanswer to this, demanded that he should give up Philotas and Antipater\r\nto them, and called upon all who were willing to assist in the\r\nliberation of Greece to come and join them, he bade his Macedonians\r\nprepare for battle.\r\n\r\nThe Thebans, although greatly outnumbered, fought with superhuman\r\nvalour; but they were taken in the rear by the Macedonian garrison,\r\nwho suddenly made a sally from the Kadmeia, and the greater part of\r\nthem were surrounded and fell fighting. The city was captured,\r\nplundered and destroyed. Alexander hoped by this terrible example to\r\nstrike terror into the other Grecian states, although he put forward\r\nthe specious pretext that he was avenging the wrongs of his allies;\r\nfor the Platæans and Phokians had made some complaints of the conduct\r\nof the Thebans towards them. With the exception of the priests, the\r\npersonal friends and guests of the Macedonians, the descendants of the\r\npoet Pindar, and those who had opposed the revolt, he sold for slaves\r\nall the rest of the inhabitants, thirty thousand in number. More than\r\nsix thousand men perished in the battle.\r\n\r\nXII. Amidst the fearful scene of misery and disorder which followed\r\nthe capture of the city, certain Thracians broke into the house of one\r\nTimoklea, a lady of noble birth and irreproachable character. Their\r\nleader forcibly violated her, and then demanded whether she had any\r\ngold or silver concealed. She said that she had, led him alone into\r\nthe garden, and, pointing to a well, told him that when the city was\r\ntaken she threw her most valuable jewels into it. While the Thracian\r\nwas stooping over the well trying to see down to the bottom, she came\r\nbehind, pushed him in, and threw large stones upon him until he died.\r\nThe Thracians seized her, and took her to Alexander, where she proved\r\nherself a woman of courage by her noble and fearless carriage, as she\r\nwalked in the midst of her savage captors. The king enquired who she\r\nwas, to which she replied she was the sister of Theagenes, who fought\r\nagainst Philip to protect the liberty of Greece, and who fell leading\r\non the Thebans at Chæronea. Alexander, struck by her answer, and\r\nadmiring her exploit, gave orders that she and her children should be\r\nset at liberty.\r\n\r\nXIII. Alexander came to terms with the Athenians, although they had\r\nexpressed the warmest sympathy for the Thebans, omitting the\r\nperformance of the festival of Demeter, out of respect for their\r\nmisfortunes, and giving a kindly welcome to all the fugitives who\r\nreached Athens. Either he had had his fill of anger, like a sated\r\nlion, or possibly he wished to perform some signal act of mercy by way\r\nof contrast to his savage treatment of Thebes. Be this as it may, he\r\nnot only informed the Athenians that he had no grounds of quarrel with\r\nthem, but even went so far as to advise them to watch the course of\r\nevents with care, since, if anything should happen to him, they might\r\nagain become the ruling state in Greece. In after times, Alexander\r\noften grieved over his harsh treatment of the Thebans, and the\r\nrecollection of what he had done made him much less severe to others.\r\nIndeed, he always referred his unfortunate drunken quarrel with\r\nKleitus, and the refusal of the Macedonian soldiers to invade India,\r\nby which they rendered the glory of his great expedition incomplete,\r\nto the anger of Dionysius,[406] who desired to avenge the fate of his\r\nfavourite city. Moreover, of the Thebans who survived the ruin of\r\ntheir city, no one ever asked any favour of Alexander without its\r\nbeing granted. This was the manner in which Alexander dealt with\r\nThebes.\r\n\r\nXIV. The Greeks after this assembled at Corinth and agreed to invade\r\nPersia with Alexander for their leader. Many of their chief statesmen\r\nand philosophers paid him visits of congratulation, and he hoped that\r\nDiogenes of Sinope, who was at that time living at Corinth, would do\r\nso. As he, however, paid no attention whatever to Alexander and\r\nremained quietly in the suburb called Kraneium, Alexander himself went\r\nto visit him. He found him lying at full length, basking in the sun.\r\nAt the approach of so many people, he sat up, and looked at Alexander.\r\nAlexander greeted him, and enquired whether he could do anything for\r\nhim. \"Yes,\" answered Diogenes, \"you can stand a little on one side,\r\nand not keep the sun off me.\" This answer is said to have so greatly\r\nsurprised Alexander, and to have filled him with such a feeling of\r\nadmiration for the greatness of mind of a man who could treat him with\r\nsuch insolent superiority, that when he went away, while all around\r\nwere jeering and scoffing he said, \"Say what you will; if I were not\r\nAlexander, I would be Diogenes.\"\r\n\r\nDesiring to consult the oracle of Apollo concerning his campaign, he\r\nnow proceeded to Delphi. It chanced that he arrived there on one of\r\nthe days which are called unfortunate, on which no oracular responses\r\ncan be obtained. In spite of this he at once sent for the chief\r\npriestess, and as she refused to officiate and urged that she was\r\nforbidden to do so by the law, he entered the temple by force and\r\ndragged her to the prophetic tripod. She, yielding to his persistence,\r\nsaid, \"You are irresistible, my son.\" Alexander, at once, on hearing\r\nthis, declared that he did not wish for any further prophecy, but that\r\nhe had obtained from her the response which he wished for. While he\r\nwas preparing for his expedition, among many other portents, the\r\nstatue of Orpheus at Loibethra, which is made of cypress-wood, was\r\nobserved to be covered with sweat. All were alarmed at this omen, but\r\nAristander bade them take courage, as it portended that Alexander\r\nshould perform many famous acts, which would cause poets much trouble\r\nto record.\r\n\r\nXV. The number of his army is variously stated by different\r\nauthorities, some saying that it amounted to thirty thousand foot and\r\nfour thousand horse, while others put the whole amount so high as\r\nforty-three thousand foot and five thousand horse. To provide for this\r\nmultitude, Aristobulus relates that he possessed only seventy talents,\r\nwhile Douris informs us that he had only provisions for thirty days,\r\nand Onesikritus declares that he was in debt to the amount of two\r\nhundred talents. Yet although he started with such slender resources,\r\nbefore he embarked he carefully enquired into the affairs of his\r\nfriends, and made them all ample presents, assigning to some of them\r\nlarge tracts of land, and to others villages, the rents of houses, or\r\nthe right of levying harbour dues. When he had almost expended the\r\nwhole of the revenues of the crown in this fashion, Perdikkas enquired\r\nof him, \"My king, what have you reserved for yourself?\" \"My hopes,\"\r\nreplied Alexander. \"Then,\" said Perdikkas, \"are we who go with you not\r\nto share them?\" and he at once refused to accept the present which had\r\nbeen offered to him, as did several others. Those, however, who would\r\nreceive his gifts, or who asked for anything, were rewarded with a\r\nlavish hand, so that he distributed among them nearly all the revenues\r\nof Macedonia; so confident of success was he when he set out. When he\r\nhad crossed the Hellespont he proceeded to Troy, offered sacrifice to\r\nAthena, and poured libations to the heroes who fell there. He anointed\r\nthe column which marks the tomb of Achilles with fresh oil, and after\r\nrunning round it naked with his friends, as is customary, placed a\r\ngarland upon it, observing that Achilles was fortunate in having a\r\nfaithful friend while he lived, and a glorious poet to sing of his\r\ndeeds after his death. While he was walking through the city and\r\nlooking at all the notable things, he was asked whether he wished to\r\nsee the harp which had once belonged to Paris. He answered, that he\r\ncared nothing for it, but that he wished to find that upon which\r\nAchilles used to play when he sang of the deeds of heroes.\r\n\r\nXVI. Meanwhile the generals of Darius had collected a large army, and\r\nposted it at the passage of the river Granikus, so that it was\r\nnecessary for Alexander to fight a battle in order to effect so much\r\nas an entrance into Asia. Most of the Greek generals were alarmed at\r\nthe depth and uneven bed of the river, and at the rugged and broken\r\nground on the farther bank, which they would have to mount in the face\r\nof the enemy. Some also raised a religious scruple, averring that the\r\nMacedonian kings never made war during the month Daisius. Alexander\r\nsaid that this could be easily remedied, and ordered that the second\r\nmonth in the Macedonian calendar should henceforth be called\r\nArtemisium. When Parmenio besought him not to risk a battle, as the\r\nseason was far advanced, he said that the Hellespont would blush for\r\nshame if he crossed it, and then feared to cross the Granikus, and at\r\nonce plunged into the stream with thirteen squadrons of cavalry. It\r\nseemed the act of a desperate madman rather than of a general to ride\r\nthus through a rapid river, under a storm of missiles, towards a steep\r\nbank where every position of advantage was occupied by armed men. He,\r\nhowever, gained the farther shore, and made good his footing there,\r\nalthough with great difficulty on account of the slippery mud. As soon\r\nas he had crossed, and driven away those who had opposed his passage,\r\nhe was charged by a mass of the enemy, and forced to fight, pell-mell,\r\nman to man, before he could put those who had followed him over into\r\nbattle array. The enemy came on with a shout, and rode straight up to\r\nthe horses of the Macedonians, thrusting at them with spears, and\r\nusing swords when their spears were broken. Many of them pressed round\r\nAlexander himself, who was made a conspicuous figure by his shield and\r\nthe long white plume which hung down on each side of his helmet. He\r\nwas struck by a javelin in the joint of his corslet, but received no\r\nhurt. Rhœsakes and Spithridates, two of the Persian generals, now\r\nattacked him at once. He avoided the charge of the latter, but broke\r\nhis spear against the breastplate of Rhœsakes, and was forced to\r\nbetake him to his sword. No sooner had they closed together than\r\nSpithridates rode up beside him, and, standing up in his stirrups,\r\ndealt him such a blow with a battle-axe, as cut off one side of his\r\nplume, and pierced his helmet just so far as to reach his hair with\r\nthe edge of the axe. While Spithridates was preparing for another\r\nblow, he was run through by black Kleitus with a lance, and at the\r\nsame moment Alexander with his sword laid Rhœsakes dead at his feet.\r\nDuring this fierce and perilous cavalry battle, the Macedonian\r\nphalanx[407] crossed the river, and engaged the enemy's infantry\r\nforce, none of which offered much resistance except a body of\r\nmercenary Greeks in the pay of Persia. These troops retired to a small\r\nrising ground, and begged for quarter. Alexander, however, furiously\r\nattacked them by riding up to them by himself, in front of his men.\r\n\r\nHe lost his horse, which was killed by a sword-thrust, and it is said\r\nthat more of the Macedonians perished in that fight, and that more\r\nwounds were given and received, than in all the rest of the battle, as\r\nthey were attacking desperate men accustomed to war.\r\n\r\nThe Persians are said to have lost twenty thousand infantry, and two\r\nthousand five hundred cavalry. In the army of Alexander, Aristobulus\r\nstates the total loss to have been thirty-four men, nine of whom were\r\nfoot soldiers. Alexander ordered that each of these men should have\r\nhis statue made in bronze by Lysippus; and wishing to make the Greeks\r\ngenerally partakers of his victory, he sent the Athenians three\r\nhundred captured shields, and on the other spoils placed the following\r\nvainglorious inscription:[408] \"Alexander, the son of Philip, and the\r\nGreeks, all but the Lacedæmonians, won these spoils from the\r\nbarbarians of Asia.\" As for the golden drinking-cups, purple hangings,\r\nand other plunder of that sort, he sent it nearly all to his mother,\r\nreserving only a few things for himself.\r\n\r\nXVII. This victory wrought a great change in Alexander's position.\r\nSeveral of the neighbouring states came and made their submission to\r\nhim, and even Sardis itself, the chief town in Lydia, and the main\r\nstation of the Persians in Asia Minor, submitted without a blow. The\r\nonly cities which still resisted him, Halikarnassus and Miletus, he\r\ntook by storm, and conquered all the adjacent territory, after which\r\nhe remained in doubt as to what to attempt next; whether to attack\r\nDarius at once and risk all that he had won upon the issue of a single\r\nbattle, or to consolidate and organise his conquests on the coast of\r\nAsia Minor, and to gather new strength for the final struggle. It is\r\nsaid that at this time a spring in the country of Lykia, near the city\r\nof Xanthus, overflowed, and threw up from its depths a brazen tablet,\r\nupon which, in ancient characters, was inscribed a prophecy that the\r\nPersian empire should be destroyed by the Greeks. Encouraged by this\r\nportent, he extended his conquests along the sea coast as far as\r\nPhœnicia and Kilikia. Many historians dwelt with admiration on the\r\ngood fortune of Alexander, in meeting with such fair weather and such\r\na smooth sea during his passage along the stormy shore of Pamphylia,\r\nand say that it was a miracle that the furious sea, which usually\r\ndashed against the highest rocks upon the cliffs, fell calm for him.\r\nMenander alludes to this in one of his plays.\r\n\r\n    \"Like Alexander, if I wish to meet\r\n    A man, at once I find him in the street;\r\n    And, were I forced to journey o'er the sea,\r\n    The sea itself would calm its waves for me.\"\r\n\r\nAlexander himself, however, in his letters, speaks of no such miracle,\r\nbut merely tells us that he started from Phaselis, and passed along\r\nthe difficult road called Klimax, or the Ladder.[409] He spent some\r\ntime in Phaselis, and while he was there, observing in the\r\nmarket-place a statue of Theodektes, a philosopher, who had recently\r\ndied, he made a procession to it one day after dinner, and crowned it\r\nwith flowers, as a sportive recognition of what he owed to Theodektes,\r\nwith whose philosophical writings Aristotle had made him familiar.\r\n\r\nXVIII. After this he put down a revolt among the Pisidians, and\r\nconquered the whole of Phrygia. On his arrival at Gordium, which is\r\nsaid to have been the capital of King Midas of old, he was shown the\r\ncelebrated chariot there, tied up with a knot of cornel-tree bark.\r\nHere he was told the legend, which all the natives believed, that\r\nwhoever untied that knot was destined to become lord of all the world.\r\nMost historians say that as the knot was tied with a strap whose ends\r\ncould not be found, and was very complicated and intricate, Alexander,\r\ndespairing of untying it, drew his sword and cut through the knot,\r\nthus making many ends appear. But Aristobulus tells us that he easily\r\nundid it by pulling out of the pole the pin to which the strap was\r\nfastened, and then drawing off the yoke itself from the pole.\r\n\r\nHe now prevailed upon the people of Paphlagonia and Kappadokia to join\r\nhim, and also was encouraged in his design of proceeding farther into\r\nthe interior by receiving intelligence of the death of Memnon, the\r\ngeneral to whom Darius had entrusted the defence of the sea coast, who\r\nhad already caused him much trouble, and had offered a most stubborn\r\nresistance to him. Darius, too, came from Susa, confident in the\r\nnumbers of his army, for he was at the head of six hundred thousand\r\nmen, and greatly encouraged by a dream upon which the Magi had put\r\nrather a strained interpretation in order to please him. He dreamed\r\nthat he saw the Macedonian phalanx begirt with flame, and that\r\nAlexander, dressed in a courier's cloak like that which he himself had\r\nworn before he became king, was acting as his servant. Afterwards,\r\nAlexander went into the temple of Belus, and disappeared. By this\r\nvision the gods probably meant to foretell that the deeds of the\r\nMacedonians would be brilliant and glorious, and that Alexander after\r\nconquering Asia, just as Darius had conquered it when from a mere\r\ncourier he rose to be a king, would die young and famous.\r\n\r\nXIX. Darius was also much encouraged by the long inaction of Alexander\r\nin Kilikia. This was caused by an illness, which some say arose from\r\nthe hardships which he had undergone, and others tell us was the\r\nresult of bathing in the icy waters of the Kydnus. No physician dared\r\nto attend him, for they all thought that he was past the reach of\r\nmedicine, and dreaded the anger of the Macedonians if they proved\r\nunsuccessful. At last Philip, an Akarnanian, seeing that he was\r\ndangerously ill, determined to run the risk, as he was his true\r\nfriend, and thought it his duty to share all his dangers. He\r\ncompounded a draught for him, and persuaded him to drink it, by\r\ntelling him that it would give him strength and enable him to take the\r\nfield. At this time Parmenio sent him a letter from the camp, bidding\r\nhim beware of Philip, who had been bribed to poison him by Darius with\r\nrich presents, and the offer of his own daughter in marriage.\r\nAlexander read the letter, and showed it to no one, but placed it\r\nunder his pillow. At the appointed hour, Philip and his friends\r\nentered the room, bringing the medicine in a cup. Alexander took the\r\ncup from him, and gave him the letter to read, while he firmly and\r\ncheerfully drank it off. It was a strange and theatrical scene. When\r\nthe one had read, and the other had drunk, they stared into each\r\nother's faces, Alexander with a cheerful expression of trust and\r\nkindly feeling towards Philip, while Philip, enraged at the calumny,\r\nfirst raised his hands to heaven, protesting his innocence, and then,\r\ncasting himself upon his knees at the bed-side, besought Alexander to\r\nbe of good cheer and follow his advice. The effect of the drug at\r\nfirst was to produce extreme weakness, for he became speechless and\r\nalmost insensible. In a short time, however, by Philip's care, he\r\nrecovered his strength, and showed himself publicly to the\r\nMacedonians, who were very anxious about him, and would not believe\r\nthat he was better until they saw him.\r\n\r\nXX. There was in the camp of Darius a Macedonian refugee, named\r\nAmyntas, who was well acquainted with Alexander's character. This man,\r\nwhen he found that Darius wished to enter the hilly country to fight\r\nAlexander amongst its narrow valleys, besought him to remain where he\r\nwas, upon the flat open plains, where the enormous numbers of his\r\ntroops could be advantageously used against the small Macedonian army.\r\nWhen Darius answered that he feared Alexander and his men would escape\r\nunless he attacked, Amyntas said, \"O king, have no fears on that\r\nscore; for he will come and fight you, and I warrant he is not far off\r\nnow.\" However, Amyntas made no impression on Darius, who marched\r\nforward into Kilikia, while at the same time Alexander marched into\r\nSyria to meet him. During the night they missed one another, and each\r\nturned back, Alexander rejoicing at this incident, and hurrying to\r\ncatch Darius in the narrow defile leading into Kilikia, while Darius\r\nwas glad of the opportunity of recovering his former ground, and of\r\ndisentangling his army from the narrow passes through the mountains.\r\nHe already had perceived the mistake which he had committed in\r\nentering a country where the sea, the mountains, and the river Pyramus\r\nwhich ran between them, made it impossible for his army to act, while\r\non the other hand it afforded great advantages to his enemies, who\r\nwere mostly foot soldiers, and whose numbers were not so great as to\r\nencumber their movements.\r\n\r\nFortune, no doubt, greatly favoured Alexander, but yet he owed much of\r\nhis success to his excellent generalship; for although enormously\r\noutnumbered by the enemy, he not only avoided being surrounded by\r\nthem, but was able to outflank their left with his own right wing, and\r\nby this manœuvre completely defeated the Persians. He himself fought\r\namong the foremost, and, according to Chares, was wounded in the thigh\r\nby Darius himself. Alexander in the account of the battle which he\r\ndespatched to Antipater, does not mention the name of the man who\r\nwounded him, but states that he received a stab in the thigh with a\r\ndagger, and that the wound was not a dangerous one.\r\n\r\nHe won a most decisive victory, and slew more than a hundred thousand\r\nof the enemy, but could not come up with Darius himself, as he gained\r\na start of nearly a mile. He captured his chariot, however, and his\r\nbow and arrows, and on his return found the Macedonians revelling in\r\nthe rich plunder which they had won, although the Persians had been in\r\nlight marching order, and had left most of their heavy baggage at\r\nDamascus. The royal pavilion of Darius himself, full of beautiful\r\nslaves, and rich furniture of every description, had been left\r\nunplundered, and was reserved for Alexander himself, who as soon as he\r\nhad taken off his armour, proceeded to the bath, saying \"Let me wash\r\noff the sweat of the battle in the bath of Darius.\" \" Nay,\" answered\r\none of his companions, \"in that of Alexander; for the goods of the\r\nvanquished become the property of the victor.\" When he entered the\r\nbath and saw that all the vessels for water, the bath itself, and the\r\nboxes of unguents were of pure gold, and smelt the delicious scent of\r\nthe rich perfumes with which the whole pavilion was filled; and when\r\nhe passed from the bath into a magnificent and lofty saloon where a\r\nsplendid banquet was prepared, he looked at his friends and said\r\n\"This, then, it is to be a king indeed.\"\r\n\r\nXXI. While he was dining it was told him that the mother and wife of\r\nDarius, and his two daughters, who were among the captives, had seen\r\nthe chariot and bow of Darius, and were mourning for him, imagining\r\nhim to be dead. Alexander when he heard this paused for a long time,\r\nbeing more affected by the grief of these ladies, than by the victory\r\nwhich he had won. Hie sent Leonnatus to inform them, that they need\r\nneither mourn for Darius, nor fear Alexander; for he was fighting for\r\nthe empire of Asia, not as a personal enemy of Darius, and would take\r\ncare that they were treated with the same honour and respect as\r\nbefore. This generous message to the captive princesses was followed\r\nby acts of still greater kindness; for he permitted then to bury\r\nwhomsoever of the slain Persians they wished, and to use all their own\r\napparel and furniture, which had been seized by the soldiers as\r\nplunder. He also allowed them to retain the regal title and state, and\r\neven increased their revenues. But the noblest and most truly royal\r\npart of his treatment of these captive ladies was that he never\r\npermitted them to hear any coarse language, or imagine for a moment\r\nthat they were likely to suffer violence or outrage; so that they\r\nlived unseen and unmolested, more as though they were in some sacred\r\nretreat of holy virgins than in a camp. Yet the wife of Darius is said\r\nto have been the most beautiful princess of her age, just as Darius\r\nhimself was the tallest and handsomest man in Asia, and their\r\ndaughters are said to have resembled their parents in beauty.\r\nAlexander, it seems, thought it more kingly to restrain himself than\r\nto conquer the enemy, and never touched any of them, nor did he know\r\nany other before his marriage, except Barsine. This lady, after the\r\ndeath of her husband Memnon, remained at Damascus. She had received a\r\nGreek education, was naturally attractive, and was of royal descent,\r\nas her father was Artabazus, who married one of the king's daughters;\r\nwhich, added to the solicitations of Parmenio, as we are told by\r\nAristobulus, made Alexander the more willing to attach himself to so\r\nbeautiful and well-born a lady. When Alexander saw the beauty of the\r\nother captives, he said in jest, that the Persian ladies make men's\r\neyes sore to behold them. Yet, in spite of their attractions, he was\r\ndetermined that his self-restraint should be as much admired as their\r\nbeauty, and passed by them as if they had been images cut out of\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nXXII. Indeed, when Philoxenus, the commander of his fleet, wrote to\r\ninform him that a slave merchant of Tarentum, named Theodorus, had two\r\nbeautiful slaves for sale, and desired to know whether he would buy\r\nthem, Alexander was greatly incensed, and angrily demanded of his\r\nfriends what signs of baseness Philoxenus could have observed in him\r\nthat he should venture to make such disgraceful proposals to him. He\r\nsent a severe reprimand to Philoxenus, and ordered him to send\r\nTheodorus and his merchandise to the devil. He also severely rebuked a\r\nyoung man named Hagnon for a similar offence.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, when he heard that two Macedonians of Parmenio's\r\nregiment, named Damon and Timotheus, had violently outraged the wives\r\nof some of the mercenary soldiers, he wrote to Parmenio, ordering him,\r\nif the charge were proved, to put them to death like mere brute beasts\r\nthat prey upon mankind. And in that letter he wrote thus of himself.\r\n\"I have never seen, or desired to see the wife of Darius, and have not\r\neven allowed her beauty to be spoken of in my presence.\"\r\n\r\nHe was wont to say that he was chiefly reminded that he was mortal by\r\nthese two weaknesses, sleep and lust; thinking weariness and\r\nsensuality alike to be bodily weaknesses. He was also most temperate\r\nin eating, as was signally proved by his answer to the princess Ada,\r\nwhom he adopted as his mother, and made Queen of Karia. She, in order\r\nto show her fondness for him, sent him every day many dainty dishes\r\nand sweetmeats, and at last presented him with her best cooks. He\r\nanswered her that he needed them not, since he had been provided with\r\nmuch better relishes for his food by his tutor Leonidas, who had\r\ntaught him to earn his breakfast by a night-march, and to obtain an\r\nappetite for his dinner by eating sparingly at breakfast. \"My tutor,\"\r\nhe said, \"would often look into my chests of clothes, and of bedding,\r\nto make sure that my mother had not hidden any delicacies for me in\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nXXIII. He was less given to wine than he was commonly supposed to be.\r\nHe was thought to be a great drinker because of the length of time\r\nwhich he would pass over each cup, in talking more than in drinking\r\nit, for he always held a long conversation while drinking, provided he\r\nwas at leisure to do so. If anything had to be done, no wine, or\r\ndesire of rest, no amusement, marriage, or spectacle could restrain\r\nhim, as they did other generals. This is clearly shown by the\r\nshortness of his life, and the wonderful number of great deeds which\r\nhe performed during the little time that he lived. When he was at\r\nleisure, he used to sacrifice to the gods immediately after rising in\r\nthe morning, and then sit down to his breakfast. After breakfast, he\r\nwould pass the day in hunting, deciding disputes between his subjects,\r\ndevising military manœuvres, or reading. When on a journey, if he was\r\nnot in any great hurry, he used, while on the road, to practice\r\narchery, or to dismount from a chariot which was being driven at full\r\nspeed, and then again mount it. Frequently also he hunted foxes and\r\nshot birds for amusement, as we learn from his diaries. On arriving at\r\nthe place where he intended to pass the night, he always bathed and\r\nanointed himself, and then asked his cooks what was being prepared for\r\nhis dinner.\r\n\r\nHe always dined late, just as it began to grow dark, and was very\r\ncareful to have his table well provided, and to give each of his\r\nguests an equal share. He sat long over his wine, as we have said,\r\nbecause of his love of conversation. And although at all other times\r\nhis society was most charming, and his manners gracious and pleasant\r\nbeyond any other prince of his age, yet when he was drinking, his talk\r\nran entirely upon military topics, and became offensively boastful,\r\npartly from his own natural disposition, and partly from the\r\nencouragement which he received from his flatterers. This often\r\ngreatly embarrassed honest men, as they neither wished to vie with the\r\nflatterers in praising him to his face, nor yet to appear to grudge\r\nhim his due share of admiration. To bestow such excessive praise\r\nseemed shameful, while to withhold it was dangerous. After a drinking\r\nbout, he would take a bath, and often slept until late in the\r\nfollowing day; and sometimes he passed the whole day asleep. He cared\r\nbut little for delicate food, and often when the rarest fruits and\r\nfish were sent to him from the sea-coast, he would distribute them so\r\nlavishly amongst his friends as to leave none for himself; yet his\r\ntable was always magnificently served, and as his revenues became\r\nincreased by his conquests, its expense rose to ten thousand drachmas\r\na day. To this it was finally limited, and those who entertained\r\nAlexander were told that they must not expend more than that sum.\r\n\r\nXXIV. After the battle of Issus, he sent troops to Damascus, and\r\ncaptured all the treasure, the baggage, and the women and children of\r\nthe Persian army. Those who chiefly benefited by this were the\r\nThessalian cavalry, who had distinguished themselves in the battle,\r\nand had been purposely chosen for this service by Alexander as a\r\nreward for their bravery; yet all the camp was filled with riches, so\r\ngreat was the mass of plunder. Then did the Macedonians get their\r\nfirst taste of gold and silver, of Persian luxury and of Persian\r\nwomen; and after this, like hounds opening upon a scent, they eagerly\r\npressed forward on the track of the wealthy Persians. Alexander,\r\nhowever, thought it best, before proceeding further, to complete the\r\nconquest of the sea-coast. Cyprus was at once surrendered to him by\r\nits local kings, as was all Phœnicia, except Tyre. He besieged Tyre\r\nfor seven months, with great mounds and siege artillery on the land\r\nside, while a fleet of two hundred triremes watched it by sea. During\r\nthe seventh month of the siege he dreamed that Herakles greeted him in\r\na friendly manner from the walls of Tyre, and called upon him to come\r\nin. Many of the Tyrians also dreamed that Apollo appeared to them, and\r\nsaid that he was going to Alexander, since what was being done in the\r\ncity of Tyre did not please him. The Tyrians, upon this, treated the\r\ngod as though he were a man caught in the act of deserting to\r\nAlexander, for they tied cords round his statue, nailed it down to its\r\nbase, and called him Alexandristes, or follower of Alexander.\r\nAlexander now dreamed another dream, that a satyr appeared to him at a\r\ndistance, and sported with him, but when he endeavoured to catch him,\r\nran away, and that, at length, after much trouble, he caught him.\r\nThis was very plausibly explained by the prophets to mean \"Sa\r\nTyros\"--\"Tyre shall be thine,\" dividing the Greek word Satyros into\r\ntwo parts. A well is shown at the present day near which Alexander saw\r\nthe satyr in his dream.\r\n\r\nDuring the siege, Alexander made an expedition against the\r\nneighbouring Arab tribes, in which he fell into great danger through\r\nhis old tutor Lysimachus, who insisted on accompanying him, declaring\r\nthat he was no older and no less brave than Phœnix when he followed\r\nAchilles to Troy. When they reached the mountains, they were forced to\r\nleave their horses and march on foot. The rest proceeded on their way,\r\nbut Lysimachus could not keep up, although night was coming on and the\r\nenemy were near. Alexander would not leave him, but encouraged him and\r\nhelped him along until he became separated from his army, and found\r\nhimself almost alone. It was now dark, and bitterly cold. The country\r\nwhere they were was very rugged and mountainous, and in the distance\r\nappeared many scattered watch-fires of the enemy.\r\n\r\nAlexander, accustomed to rouse the disheartened Macedonians by his own\r\npersonal exertions, and trusting to his swiftness of foot, ran up to\r\nthe nearest fire, struck down with his sword two men who wore watching\r\nbeside it, and brought a burning firebrand back to his own party. They\r\nnow made up an enormous fire, which terrified some of the enemy so\r\nmuch that they retreated, while others who had intended to attack\r\nthem, halted and forbore to do so, thus enabling them to pass the\r\nnight in safety.\r\n\r\nXXV. The siege of Tyre came to an end in the following manner. The\r\ngreater part of Alexander's troops were resting from their labours,\r\nbut in order to occupy the attention of the enemy, he led a few men up\r\nto the city walls, while Aristander, the soothsayer, offered\r\nsacrifice. When he saw the victims, he boldly informed all who were\r\npresent that during the current month, Tyre would be taken. All who\r\nheard him laughed him to scorn, as that day was the last of the month,\r\nbut Alexander seeing him at his wits' end, being always eager to\r\nsupport the credit of prophecies, gave orders that that day should\r\nnot be reckoned as the thirtieth of the month, but as the\r\ntwenty-third. After this he bade the trumpets sound, and assaulted the\r\nwalls much more vigorously than he had originally intended. The attack\r\nsucceeded, and as the rest of the army would no longer stay behind in\r\nthe camp, but rushed to take their share in the assault, the Tyrians\r\nwere overpowered, and their city taken on that very day.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, while Alexander was besieging Gaza, the largest city in\r\nSyria, a clod of earth was dropped upon his shoulder by a bird, which\r\nafterwards alighted upon one of the military engines, and became\r\nentangled in the network of ropes by which it was worked. This portent\r\nalso was truly explained by Aristander; for the place was taken, and\r\nAlexander was wounded in the shoulder.\r\n\r\nHe sent many of the spoils to Olympias, Kleopatra, and others of his\r\nfriends, and sent his tutor Leonidas five hundred talents weight of\r\nfrankincense, and a hundred talents of myrrh, to remind him of what he\r\nhad said when a child. Leonidas once, when sacrificing, reproved\r\nAlexander for taking incense by handfuls to throw upon the victim when\r\nit was burning on the altar. \"When,\" he said, \"you have conquered the\r\ncountry from which incense comes, Alexander, then you may make such\r\nrich offerings as these; but at present you must use what we have\r\nsparingly.\" Alexander now wrote to him, \"We have sent you abundance of\r\nfrankincense and myrrh, that you may no longer treat the gods so\r\nstingily.\"\r\n\r\nXXVI. When a certain casket was brought to him, which appeared to be\r\nthe most valuable of all the treasures taken from Darius, he asked his\r\nfriends what they thought he ought to keep in it as his own most\r\nprecious possession. After they had suggested various different\r\nthings, he said that he intended to keep his copy of the Iliad in it.\r\nThis fact is mentioned by many historians; and if the legend which is\r\ncurrent among the people of Alexandria; on the authority of\r\nHerakleides, be true, the poems of Homer were far from idle or useless\r\ncompanions to him, even when on a campaign. The story goes that after\r\nconquering Egypt, he desired to found a great and populous Grecian\r\ncity, to be called after his own name, and that after he had fixed\r\nupon an excellent site, where in the opinion of the best architects, a\r\ncity surpassing anything previously existing could be built, he\r\ndreamed that a man with long hair and venerable aspect appeared to\r\nhim, and recited the following verses:\r\n\r\n    \"Hard by, an island in the stormy main\r\n    Lies close to Egypt, Pharos is its name.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as he woke, he proceeded to Pharos, which then was an island\r\nnear the Canopic mouth of the Nile, though at the present day so much\r\nearth has been deposited by the river that it is joined to the\r\nmainland. When he saw the great advantages possessed by this place,\r\nwhich is a long strip of land, stretching between the sea and a large\r\ninland lake, with a large harbour at the end of it, he at once said\r\nthat Homer, besides his other admirable qualities, was a splendid\r\narchitect, and gave orders to his workmen to mark out a site for a\r\ncity suitable to such a situation. There was no chalk or white earth,\r\nwith which it is usual to mark the course of the walls, but they took\r\nbarley-groats, and marked out a semicircular line with them upon the\r\nblack earth, dividing it into equal segments by lines radiating from\r\nthe centre, so that it looked like a Macedonian cloak, of which the\r\nwalls formed the outer fringe. While the king was looking with\r\nsatisfaction at the plan of the new city, suddenly from the lake and\r\nthe river, innumerable aquatic birds of every kind flew like great\r\nclouds to the spot, and devoured all the barley. This omen greatly\r\ndisturbed Alexander; however, the soothsayers bade him take courage,\r\nand interpreted it to mean that the place would become a very rich and\r\npopulous city. Upon this he ordered the workmen at once to begin to\r\nbuild, while he himself started to visit the shrine and oracle of Zeus\r\nAmmon. This journey is tedious and difficult, and dangerous also,\r\nbecause the way lies over a waterless desert, where the traveller is\r\nexposed to violent storms of sand whenever the south wind blows. It\r\nwas here that fifty thousand men of the army of Cambyses are said to\r\nhave been overwhelmed by the sand, which rolled upon them in huge\r\nbillows until they were completely ingulfed. All these perils were\r\npresent to all men's minds, but it was hard to turn Alexander away\r\nfrom any project upon which he had once set his heart. The invariable\r\ngood fortune which he had enjoyed confirmed his self-will, and his\r\npride would not allow him to confess himself vanquished either by\r\nhuman enemies or natural obstacles.\r\n\r\nXXVII. During his journey, the signal assistance which he received\r\nfrom the gods in all his difficulties was more remarkable and more\r\ngenerally believed than the oracular response which he is said to have\r\nreceived, although these portents made men more inclined to believe in\r\nthe oracle. In the first place, plentiful showers were sent, which\r\nquite dissipated any fears which the expedition had entertained about\r\nsuffering from thirst, while the rain cooled the sand and thus\r\ntempered the hot air of the desert to a pleasant warmth. Next, when\r\nthe guides lost their way, and all were wandering helplessly, birds\r\nappeared who guided them on the right path, flying before them and\r\nencouraging them to march, and waiting for those of them who fell\r\nbehind wearied. \"We are even assured by Kallisthones that, at night,\r\nthe birds by their cries recalled stragglers, and kept all on the\r\ndirect road.\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander had crossed the desert, and arrived at the temple, the\r\npriest of Ammon greeted him as the son of the god. He inquired whether\r\nanyone of his father's murderers had escaped, to which the priest\r\nanswered that he must not ask such questions, for his father was more\r\nthan man. Alexander now altered the form of his inquiry and asked\r\nwhether he had punished all the murderers of Philip: and then he asked\r\nanother question, about his empire, whether he was fated to conquer\r\nall mankind. On receiving as an answer that this would be granted to\r\nhim and that Philip had been amply avenged, he made splendid presents\r\nto the god, and amply rewarded the priests.\r\n\r\nThis is the account which most historians give about the response of\r\nthe oracle; but in a letter to his mother, Alexander says that he\r\nreceived certain secret prophecies, which upon his return he would\r\ncommunicate to her alone. Some narrate that the priest, wishing to\r\ngive him a friendly greeting in the Greek language, said \"My son,\"\r\nbut being a foreigner, mispronounced the words so as to say \"Son of\r\nZeus,\" a mistake which delighted Alexander and caused men to say that\r\nthe god himself had addressed him as \"Son of Zeus.\" We are told that\r\nwhile in Egypt, he attended the lectures of the philosopher Psammon,\r\nand was especially pleased when he pointed out that God is King over\r\nall men, because that which rules and conquers must be king. He\r\nhimself thought that he had improved upon this by saying that although\r\nGod is the common father of all men, yet that he makes the best men\r\nmore peculiarly his own.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. In his dealings with Asiatics, he always acted and spoke with\r\nthe greatest arrogance, and seemed firmly convinced of his own divine\r\nparentage, but he was careful not to make the same boast when among\r\nGreeks. On one occasion, indeed, he wrote to the Athenians the\r\nfollowing letter about their possession of Samos. \"I,\" he said,\r\n\"should not have presented you with that free and glorious city; but\r\nit was presented to you by its former master, my reputed father\r\nPhilip.\"\r\n\r\nYet afterwards when he was wounded by an arrow and in great pain he\r\nsaid \"This, my friends, is blood that runs from my wound, and not\r\n\r\n     \"Ichor, that courses through the veins of gods.\"\r\n\r\nOnce when a great thunderstorm terrified every one, Anaxarchus the\r\nsophist, who was with him, said \"Son of Zeus, canst thou do as much?\"\r\nTo this, Alexander answered with a smile, \"Nay, I love not to frighten\r\nmy friends, as you would have me do, when you complained of my table,\r\nbecause fish was served upon it instead of princes' heads.\" Indeed we\r\nare told that once, when Alexander had sent some small fish to\r\nHephæstion, Anaxarchus used this expression ironically disparaging\r\nthose who undergo great toils and run great risks to obtain\r\nmagnificent results which, after all, make them no happier or able to\r\nenjoy themselves than other men. From these anecdotes we see that\r\nAlexander himself did not put any belief in the story of his divine\r\nparentage, but that he used it as a means of imposing upon others.\r\n\r\nXXIX. From Egypt he returned to Phœnicia, and there offered\r\nmagnificent sacrifices to the gods, with grand processions, cyclic\r\nchoruses, and performances of tragic dramas. These last were\r\nespecially remarkable, for the local kings of Cyprus acted as choragi,\r\nthat is, supplied the chorus and paid all the expenses of putting the\r\ndrama upon the stage, just as is done every year at Athens by the\r\nrepresentatives of the tribes, and they exhibited wonderful emulation,\r\ndesiring to outdo each other in the splendour of their shows. The\r\ncontest between Nikokreon, King of Salamis, and Pasikrates, King of\r\nSoli, is especially memorable. These two had obtained by lot the two\r\nmost celebrated actors of the day, who were named Athenodorus and\r\nThessalus, to act in their plays. Of these, Athenodorus was assigned\r\nto Nikokreon, and Thessalus, in whose success Alexander himself was\r\npersonally interested, to Pasikrates. Alexander, however, never\r\nallowed any word to escape him denoting his preference for one over\r\nthe other until after the votes had been given, and Athenodorus had\r\nbeen proclaimed the winner, when, as he was going home, he said that\r\nhe would willingly have given up a province of his kingdom to save\r\nThessalus from being vanquished. As Athenodorus was fined by the\r\nAthenians for being absent from their Dionysian festival, in which he\r\nought to have taken part, he begged Alexander to write them a letter\r\nto excuse him. Alexander refused to do this, but paid his fine\r\nhimself. And when Lykon, of Skarphia, an excellent actor who had\r\npleased Alexander well, inserted a verse into the comedy which he was\r\nacting, in which he begged to be given ten talents, Alexander laughed\r\nand gave them to him.\r\n\r\nDarius now sent an embassy to Alexander, bearing a letter, in which he\r\noffered to pay ten thousand talents as a ransom for his wife and\r\nchildren, and proposed that Alexander should receive all the territory\r\nwest of the Euphrates, and become his ally and son-in-law. Alexander\r\nlaid this proposal before his friends, and when Parmenio said, \"I\r\nshould accept it, if I were Alexander.\" \"So would I,\" replied\r\nAlexander, \"if I were Parmenio.\" He wrote, however, a letter in answer\r\nto Darius, informing him that if he would come to him, and submit\r\nhimself, he should be used with courtesy; but that if not, he should\r\npresently march against him.\r\n\r\nXXX. Soon after this the wife of Darius died in child-bed, which\r\ngreatly grieved Alexander, as he thereby lost a great opportunity of\r\ndisplaying his magnanimity: nevertheless he granted her a magnificent\r\nfuneral. We are told that one of the eunuchs attached to the royal\r\nharem, named Teireus, who had been captured with the ladies, made his\r\nescape shortly after the queen's death, rode straight to Darius, and\r\ninformed him of what had happened. Darius, at this, beat his face and\r\nwept aloud, saying, \"Alas for the fortune of Persia! that the wife and\r\nsister of the king should not only have been taken captive while she\r\nlived, but also have been buried unworthily of her rank when she\r\ndied.\" To this the eunuch answered, \"You have no cause to lament the\r\nevil fortune of Persia on account of your wife's burial, or of any\r\nwant of due respect to her. Our lady Statira, your children, and your\r\nmother, when alive wanted for nothing except the light of your\r\ncountenance, which our lord Oromasdes will some day restore to them,\r\nnor was she treated without honour when she died, for her funeral was\r\neven graced by the tears of her enemies. Alexander is as gracious a\r\nconqueror as he is a terrible enemy.\"\r\n\r\nThese words roused other suspicions in the mind of Darius: and,\r\nleading the eunuch into an inner chamber in his tent, he said to him,\r\n\"If you have not, like the good luck of Persia, gone over to Alexander\r\nand the Macedonians, and if I am still your master Darius, tell me, I\r\nconjure you by the name of great Mithras our lord, and by the right\r\nhand of a king, which I give thee, do I lament over the least of\r\nStatira's misfortunes when I weep for her death, and did she not in\r\nher life make us more miserable by her dishonour, than if she had\r\nfallen into the hands of a cruel enemy? For what honest communication\r\ncan a young conqueror have with the wife of his enemy, and what can be\r\nthe meaning of his showing such excessive honour to her after her\r\ndeath?\" While Darius was yet speaking, Teireus threw himself at his\r\nfeet, and besought him to be silent, and not to dishonour Alexander\r\nand his dead wife and sister by such suspicions, nor yet to take away\r\nfrom himself that thought which ought to be his greatest consolation\r\nin his misfortunes, which was that he had been conquered by one who\r\nwas more than man. Rather ought he to admire Alexander, whose\r\nhonourable treatment of the Persian women proved him to be even\r\ngreater than did his bravery in vanquishing their men. Those words the\r\neunuch assured him, with many protestations and oaths, were perfectly\r\ntrue. Darius, when he heard this, came out of his tent to his friends,\r\nand, raising his hands to heaven, said, \"Ye parent gods, who watch\r\nover the Persian throne, grant that I may again restore the fortune of\r\nPersia to its former state, in order that I may have an opportunity of\r\nrepaying Alexander in person the kindness which he has shown to those\r\nwhom I hold dearest; but if indeed the fated hour has arrived, and the\r\nPersian empire is doomed to perish, may no other conqueror than\r\nAlexander mount the throne of Cyrus.\" The above is the account given\r\nby most historians of what took place on this occasion.\r\n\r\nXXXI. Alexander, after conquering all the country on the higher bank\r\nof the Euphrates, marched to attack Darius, who was advancing to meet\r\nhim with an army of a million fighting men.\r\n\r\nDuring this march, one of Alexander's friends told him as a joke, that\r\nthe camp-followers had divided themselves into two bodies in sport,\r\neach of which was led by a general, the one called Alexander, and the\r\nother Darius; and that after beginning to skirmish with one another by\r\nthrowing clods of earth, they had come to blows of the fist, and had\r\nat length become so excited that they fought with sticks and stones,\r\nand that it was hard to part them. On hearing this, Alexander ordered\r\nthe two leaders to fight in single combat: and he himself armed the\r\none called Alexander, while Philotas armed the representative of\r\nDarius. The whole army looked on, thinking that the result would be\r\nominous of their own success or failure. After a severe fight, the one\r\ncalled Alexander conquered, and was rewarded with twelve villages and\r\nthe right of wearing the Persian garb. This we are told by\r\nEratosthenes the historian.\r\n\r\nThe decisive battle with Darius was fought at Gaugamela, not at\r\nArbela, as most writers tell us. It is said that this word signifies\r\n\"the house of the camel,\" and that one of the ancient Kings of Persia,\r\nwhose life had been saved by the swiftness with which a camel bore him\r\naway from his enemies, lodged the animal there for the rest of its\r\nlife, and assigned to it the revenues of several villages for its\r\nmaintenance.\r\n\r\nDuring the month Bœdromion, at the beginning of the celebration of the\r\nEleusinian mysteries, there was an eclipse, of the moon: and on the\r\neleventh day after the eclipse the two armies came within sight of one\r\nanother. Darius kept his troops under arms, and inspected their ranks\r\nby torch-light, while Alexander allowed the Macedonians to take their\r\nrest, but himself with the soothsayer Aristander performed some\r\nmystical ceremonies in front of his tent, and offered sacrifice to\r\nPhœbus.\r\n\r\nWhen Parmenio and the elder officers of Alexander saw the entire plain\r\nbetween Mount Niphates and the confines of Gordyene covered with the\r\nwatch fires of the Persians, and heard the vague, confused murmur of\r\ntheir army like the distant roar of the sea, they were astonished, and\r\nsaid to one another that it would indeed be a prodigious effort to\r\nfight such a mass of enemies by daylight in a pitched battle.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Alexander had finished his sacrifice they went to him, and\r\ntried to persuade him to fall upon the Persians by night, as the\r\ndarkness would prevent his troops from seeing the overwhelming numbers\r\nof the enemy. It was then that he made that memorable answer, \"I will\r\nnot steal a victory,\" which some thought to show an over-boastful\r\nspirit, which could jest in the presence of such fearful danger; while\r\nothers thought that it showed a steady confidence and true knowledge\r\nof what would happen on the morrow, and meant that he did not intend\r\nto give Darius, when vanquished, the consolation of attributing his\r\ndefeat to the confusion of a night attack; for Darius had already\r\nexplained his defeat at Issus to have been owing to the confined\r\nnature of the ground, and to his forces having been penned up between\r\nthe mountains and the sea. It was not any want of men or of arms\r\nwhich would make Darius yield, when he had so vast a country and such\r\ngreat resources at his disposal: it was necessary to make pride and\r\nhope alike die within him, by inflicting upon him a crushing defeat in\r\na fair field and in open daylight.\r\n\r\nXXXII. After his officers had retired, Alexander retired to his tent\r\nand is said to have slept more soundly than was his wont, which\r\nsurprised the generals who came to wait upon him early in the morning.\r\nOn their own responsibility they gave orders to the soldiers to\r\nprepare their breakfast; and then, as time pressed, Parmenio entered\r\nhis tent, and standing by his bed-side, twice or thrice called him\r\nloudly by name. When he was awake, Parmenio asked him why he slept so\r\nsoundly, as if he had already won the victory instead of being just\r\nabout to fight the most important of all his battles. Alexander\r\nanswered with a smile; \"Do you not think we have already won the\r\nvictory, now that we are no longer obliged to chase Darius over an\r\nenormous tract of wasted country?\"\r\n\r\nAlexander both before the battle, and in the most dangerous crisis of\r\nthe day proved himself truly great, always taking judicious measures,\r\nwith a cheerful confidence of success. His left wing was terribly\r\nshaken by a tumultuous charge of the Bactrian cavalry, who broke into\r\nthe ranks of the Macedonians, while Mazæus sent some horsemen\r\ncompletely round the left wing, who fell upon the troops left to guard\r\nthe baggage. Parmenio, finding his men thrown into confusion by these\r\nattacks, sent a message to Alexander, that his fortified camp and\r\nbaggage would be lost, if he did not at once despatch a strong\r\nreinforcement to the rear. At the time when Alexander received this\r\nmessage, he was in the act of giving his own troops orders to attack,\r\nand he answered that Parmenio must, in his confusion, have forgotten\r\nthat the victors win all the property of the vanquished, and that men\r\nwho are defeated must not think about treasure or prisoners, but how\r\nto fight and die with honour. After sending back this answer to\r\nParmenio, he put on his helmet; for he had left his tent fully armed\r\nat all other points, wearing a tunic of Sicilian manufacture closely\r\ngirt round his waist, and over that a double-woven linen corslet,\r\nwhich had been among the spoils taken at Issus. His helmet was of\r\nsteel, polished as bright as silver, and was wrought by Theophilus,\r\nwhile round his neck he wore a steel gorget, inlaid with precious\r\nstones. His sword, his favourite weapon, was a miracle of lightness\r\nand tempering, and had been presented to him by the King of Kitium in\r\nCyprus. The cloak which hung from his shoulders was by far the most\r\ngorgeous of all his garments, and was the work of the ancient artist\r\nHelikon,[410] presented to Alexander by the city of Rhodes, and was\r\nworn by him in all his battles. While he was arraying his troops in\r\norder of battle, and giving final directions to his officers, he rode\r\nanother horse to spare Boukephalus, who was now somewhat old. As soon\r\nas he was ready to begin the attack, he mounted Boukephalus and led on\r\nhis army.\r\n\r\nXXXIII. Upon this occasion, after addressing the Thessalians and other\r\nGreek troops at considerable length, as they confidently shouted to\r\nhim to lead them against the barbarians, we are told by Kallisthenes\r\nthat he shifted his lance into his left hand, and raising his right\r\nhand to heaven, prayed to the gods that, if he really were the son of\r\nZeus, they would assist and encourage the Greeks. The prophet\r\nAristander, who rode by his side, dressed in a white robe, and with a\r\ncrown of gold upon his head, now pointed out to him an eagle which\r\nrose over his head and directed its flight straight towards the enemy.\r\nThis so greatly encouraged all who beheld it, that all the cavalry of\r\nAlexander's army at once set spurs to their horses and dashed\r\nforwards, followed by the phalanx. Before the first of them came to\r\nactual blows, the Persian line gave way, and terrible confusion took\r\nplace, as Alexander drove the beaten troops before him, struggling to\r\nfight his way to the centre, where was Darius himself.\r\n\r\nAlexander had already noted the conspicuous figure of this tall,\r\nhandsome prince, as he stood in his lofty chariot, surrounded by the\r\nroyal body guard, a glittering mass of well-armed horsemen, behind the\r\ndeep ranks of the Persian army. The onslaught of Alexander was so\r\nterrific that none could withstand him, and those whom he drove before\r\nhim, in headlong flight, disordered the ranks which were yet unbroken,\r\nand caused a general rout. Yet the noblest and bravest of the Persians\r\nfought and died manfully in defence of their king, and, even when\r\nlying on the ground at their last gasp, seized the men and horses by\r\nthe legs to prevent their pursuing him. Darius himself, seeing all\r\nthese frightful disasters, when his first line was hurled back in\r\nruin, would fain have turned his chariot and fled, but this was\r\ndifficult, for the wheels were encumbered by the heaps of corpses, and\r\nthe horses were so excited and restive that the charioteer was unable\r\nto manage them. Darius, we are told, left his chariot and his arms,\r\nmounted a mare which had recently foaled, and rode away. He would not\r\nhave escaped even thus, had not mounted messengers just then arrived\r\nfrom Parmenio, begging Alexander to come to his aid, as he was engaged\r\nwith a large body of the enemy upon which he could make no impression.\r\nIndeed, throughout this battle, Parmenio is said to have displayed\r\ngreat remissness and self-will, either because his courage was damped\r\nby age, or because, as we are told by Kallisthenes, he envied\r\nAlexander's greatness and prosperity. Alexander was much vexed at the\r\nmessage, but without explaining to the soldiers what his real reasons\r\nwere, ordered the trumpets to sound the recall, as though he were\r\ntired of slaughter, or because night was now coming on. He himself at\r\nonce rode to the scene of danger, but on his way thither heard that\r\nthe enemy had been completely defeated and put to flight.\r\n\r\nXXXIV. The result of this battle was the complete destruction of the\r\nPersian empire. Alexander was at once saluted King of Asia, and after\r\na splendid sacrifice to the gods, distributed the treasures and\r\nprovinces of that country among his friends. In the pride of his heart\r\nhe now wrote to Greece, saying that all the despots must be driven\r\nout, and each city left independent with a constitutional government,\r\nand gave orders for the rebuilding of the city of Platæa, because the\r\nancestors of the citizens of Platæa gave their territory to be\r\nconsecrated to the gods on behalf of the liberties of Greece. He also\r\nsent some part of the spoils to the citizens of Kroton, in Italy, to\r\nshow his respect for the memory of Phaÿllus the athlete, who, during\r\nthe Persian invasion, when all the other Greek cities in Italy\r\ndeserted the cause of their countrymen in Greece, fitted out a ship of\r\nwar at his own expense, and sailed to Salamis to take part in the\r\nbattle there, and share in the dangers of the Greeks. Such honour did\r\nAlexander pay to personal prowess, for he loved to reward and to\r\ncommemorate noble deeds.\r\n\r\nXXXV. Alexander now marched into the country of Babylonia, which at\r\nonce yielded to him. As he drew near to Ekbatana he marvelled much at\r\nan opening in the earth, out of which poured fire, as if from a well.\r\nClose by, the naphtha which was poured out formed a large lake. This\r\nsubstance is like bitumen, and is so easy to set on fire, that without\r\ntouching it with any flame, it will catch light from the rays which\r\nare sent forth from a fire, burning the air which is between both. The\r\nnatives, in order to show Alexander the qualities of naphtha, lightly\r\nsprinkled with it the street which led to his quarters, and when it\r\nbecame dark applied a match to one end of the track which had been\r\nsprinkled with it. As soon as it was alight in one place, the fire ran\r\nall along, and as quick as thought the whole street was in flames. At\r\nthis time Alexander was in his bath, and was waited upon by Stephanus,\r\na hard-favoured page-boy, who had, however, a fine voice.\r\nAthenophanes, an Athenian, who always anointed and bathed King\r\nAlexander, now asked him if he would like to see the power of the\r\nnaphtha tried upon Stephanus, saying that if it burned upon his body\r\nand did not go out, the force of it must indeed be marvellous. The boy\r\nhimself was eager to make the trial, and was anointed with it and set\r\non fire. He was at once enveloped in flame, and Alexander was\r\nterrified for him, fearing that he would be burned to death. Indeed,\r\nhad it not chanced that several attendants with pitchers of water in\r\ntheir hands had just arrived, all help would have been too late. They\r\npoured water over the boy and extinguished the flames, but not before\r\nhe had been badly burned, so that he was ill for some time after. Some\r\nwriters, who are eager to prove the truth of ancient legends, say\r\nthat this naphtha was truly the deadly drug used by Medea, with which\r\nshe anointed the crown and robe spoken of in the tragedies: for flame\r\ncould not be produced by them, nor of its own accord, but if fire were\r\nbrought near to clothes steeped in naphtha they would at once burst\r\ninto flame. The reason of this is that the rays which fire sends forth\r\nfall harmlessly upon all other bodies, merely imparting to them light\r\nand heat; but when they meet with such as have an oily, dry humour,\r\nand thereby have a sympathy with the nature of fire, they easily cause\r\nthem to catch fire. It is a disputed question, however, how the\r\nnaphtha is produced, though most writers conceive its combustible\r\nprinciple to be supplied by the greasy and fiery nature of the soil;\r\nfor all the district of Babylonia is fiery hot, so that often barley\r\nis cast up out of the ground in which it is sown, as if the earth\r\nthrobbed and vibrated with the heat, and during the hottest part of\r\nsummer the inhabitants are wont to sleep upon leathern bags filled\r\nwith water for the sake of coolness. Harpalus, who was appointed\r\ngovernor of the district, took an especial delight in adorning the\r\npalace and the public walks with Greek flowers and shrubs; but\r\nalthough he found no difficulty with most of them, he was unable to\r\ninduce ivy to grow, because ivy loves a cold soil, and the earth there\r\nis too hot for it. These digressions, provided they be not too\r\nlengthy, we hope will not be thought tedious by our readers.\r\n\r\nXXXVI. When Alexander made himself master of Susa, he found in the\r\npalace forty thousand talents worth of coined money, besides an\r\nimmense mass of other valuable treasure. Here we are told was found\r\nfive thousand talents weight of cloth dyed with Hermionic[411] purple\r\ncloth, which had been stored up there for a space of two hundred years\r\nsave ten, and which nevertheless still kept its colour as brilliantly\r\nas ever. The reason of this is said to be that honey was originally\r\nused in dyeing the cloth purple, and white olive oil for such of it as\r\nwas dyed-white: for cloth of these two colours will preserve its\r\nlustre without fading for an equal period of time. Demon also informs\r\nus that amongst other things the Kings of Persia had water brought\r\nfrom the Nile and the Danube, and laid up in their treasury, as a\r\nconfirmation of the greatness of their empire, and to prove that they\r\nwere lords of all the world.\r\n\r\nXXXVII. As the district of Persis[412] was very hard to invade, both\r\nbecause of its being mountainous, and because it was defended by the\r\nnoblest of the Persians (for Darius had fled thither for refuge),\r\nAlexander forced his way into it by a circuitous path, which was shown\r\nhim by a native of the country, the son of a Lykian captive, by a\r\nPersian mother, who was able to speak both the Greek and the Persian\r\nlanguage. It is said that while Alexander was yet a child, the\r\nprophetess at the temple of Apollo at Delphi foretold that a wolf[413]\r\nshould some day serve him for a guide when he went to attack the\r\nPersians. When Persis was taken, a terrible slaughter was made of all\r\nthe prisoners. A letter written by Alexander himself is still extant,\r\nin which he orders that they should all be put to the sword, thinking\r\nthis to be the safest course. He is said to have found as much coined\r\nmoney here[414] as in Susa, and so much other treasure that it\r\nrequired ten thousand carts, each drawn by a pair of mules, and five\r\nthousand camels, to carry it away.\r\n\r\nAlexander, observing a large statue of Xerxes which had been thrown\r\ndown and was being carelessly trampled upon by the soldiers as they\r\npressed into the royal palace, stopped, and addressed it as though it\r\nwere alive. \"Shall we,\" said he, \"leave thee lying there, because of\r\nthy invasion of Greece, or shall we set thee up again because of thy\r\nmagnificence and greatness of soul?\" He then stood musing for a long\r\ntime, till at length he roused himself from his reverie and went his\r\nway. Being desirous of giving his soldiers some rest, as it was now\r\nwinter, he remained in that country for four months. It is related\r\nthat when he first took his seat upon the royal throne of Persia,\r\nunder the golden canopy, Demaratus, an old friend and companion of\r\nAlexander, burst into tears, and exclaimed that the Greeks who had\r\ndied before that day had lost the greatest of pleasures, because they\r\nhad not seen Alexander seated on the throne of Darius.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. After this, while he was engaged in preparing to march in\r\npursuit of Darius, he chanced to be present at a banquet where his\r\nfriends had brought their mistresses. Of these ladies the chief was\r\nthe celebrated Thais, who afterwards became the mistress of King\r\nPtolemy of Egypt, and who was of Attic parentage.\r\n\r\nShe at first amused Alexander by her conversation, then adroitly\r\nflattered him, and at last, after he had been drinking for some time,\r\nbegan to speak in a lofty strain of patriotism which scarcely became\r\nsuch a person. She declared, that she was fully repaid for all the\r\nhardships which she had undergone while travelling through Asia with\r\nthe army, now that she was able to revel in the palace of the haughty\r\nKings of Persia; but that it would be yet sweeter to her to burn the\r\nhouse of Xerxes, who burned her native Athens, and to apply the torch\r\nwith her own hand in the presence of Alexander, that it might be told\r\namong men that a woman who followed Alexander's camp had taken a more\r\nnoble revenge upon the Persians for the wrongs of Greece, than all the\r\nadmirals and generals of former times had been able to do. This speech\r\nof hers was enthusiastically applauded, and all Alexander's friends\r\npressed him to execute the design. Alexander leaped from his seat, and\r\nled the way, with a garland upon his head and a torch in his hand. The\r\nrest of the revellers followed, and surrounded the palace, while the\r\nremainder of the Macedonians, hearing what was going on, brought them\r\ntorches. They did so the more readily because they thought that the\r\ndestruction of the palace indicated an intention on Alexander's part\r\nto return home, and not to remain in Persia. Some historians say that\r\nthis was how he came to burn the palace, while others say that he did\r\nit after mature deliberation: but all agree that he repented of what\r\nhe had done, and gave orders to have the fire extinguished.\r\n\r\nXXXIX. His liberality and love of making presents increased with his\r\nconquests: and his gifts were always bestowed in so gracious a manner\r\nas to double their value. I will now mention a few instances of this.\r\nAriston, the leader of the Pæonians, having slain an enemy, brought\r\nhis head and showed it to Alexander, saying, \"O king, in my country\r\nsuch a present as this is always rewarded with a gold cup.\" Alexander\r\nsmiled, and said, \"Yes, with an empty cup: but I pledge you in this\r\ngold cup, full of good wine, and give you the cup besides.\" One of the\r\ncommon Macedonian soldiers was driving a mule laden with gold\r\nbelonging to Alexander; but as the animal became too weary to carry\r\nit, he unloaded it, and carried the gold himself. When Alexander saw\r\nhim toiling under his burden, and learned his story, he said, \"Be not\r\nweary yet, but carry it a little way farther, as far as your own tent;\r\nfor I give it to you.\" He seemed to be more vexed with those who did\r\nnot ask him for presents than with those who did so. He wrote a letter\r\nto Phokion, in which he declared that he would not any longer remain\r\nhis friend, if Phokion refused all his presents. Serapion, a boy who\r\nserved the ball to the players at tennis, had been given nothing by\r\nAlexander because he had never asked for anything. One day when\r\nSerapion was throwing the ball to the players as usual, he omitted to\r\ndo so to the king, and when Alexander asked why he did not give him\r\nthe ball, answered \"You do not ask me for it.\" At this, Alexander\r\nlaughed and gave him many presents. Once he appeared to be seriously\r\nangry with one Proteus, a professed jester. The man's friends\r\ninterceded for him, and he himself begged for pardon with tears in his\r\neyes, until Alexander said that he forgave him. \"My king,\" said he\r\n\"will you not give me something by way of earnest, to assure me that I\r\nam in your favour.\" Upon this the king at once ordered him to be given\r\nfive talents. The amount of money which he bestowed upon his friends\r\nand his body guard appears from a letter which his mother Olympias\r\nwrote to him, in which she said, \"It is right to benefit your friends\r\nand to show your esteem for them; but you are making them all as great\r\nas kings, so that they get many friends, and leave you alone without\r\nany.\" Olympias often wrote to him to this effect, but he kept all her\r\nletters secret, except one which Hephæstion, who was accustomed to\r\nread Alexander's letters, opened and read. Alexander did not prevent\r\nhim, but took his own ring from his finger, and pressed the seal upon\r\nHephæstion's mouth. The son of Mazæus, who had been the chief man in\r\nthe kingdom under Darius, was governor of a province, and Alexander\r\nadded another larger one to it. The young nobleman refused to accept\r\nthe gift, and said, \"My king, formerly there was only one Darius, but\r\nyou now have made many Alexanders.\"\r\n\r\nHe presented Parmenio with the house of Bagoas, in which it is said\r\nthat property worth a thousand talents was found which had belonged to\r\nthe people of Susa. He also sent word to Antipater, warning him to\r\nkeep a guard always about his person, as a plot had been formed\r\nagainst his life. He sent many presents to his mother, but forbade her\r\nto interfere with the management of the kingdom. When she stormed at\r\nthis decision of his, he patiently endured her anger; and once when\r\nAntipater wrote a long letter to him full of abuse of Olympias, he\r\nobserved, after reading it, that Antipater did not know that one tear\r\nof his mother's eye would outweigh ten thousand such letters.\r\n\r\nXL. Alexander now observed that his friends were living in great\r\nluxury and extravagance; as for instance, Hagnon of Teos had his shoes\r\nfastened with silver nails; Leonnatus took about with him many camels,\r\nladen with dust,[415] from Egypt, to sprinkle his body with when he\r\nwrestled; Philotas had more than twelve miles of nets for hunting; and\r\nthat all of them used richly perfumed unguents to anoint themselves\r\nwith instead of plain oil, and were attended by a host of bathmen and\r\nchamberlains. He gently reproved them for this, saying that he was\r\nsurprised that men who had fought so often and in such great battles,\r\ndid not remember that the victors always sleep more sweetly than the\r\nvanquished, and that they did not perceive, when they imitated the\r\nluxury of the Persians, that indulgence is for slaves, but labour for\r\nprinces. \"How,\" he asked, \"can a man attend to his horse, or clean\r\nhis own lance and helmet, if he disdains to rub his own precious body\r\nwith his hands? And do you not know, that our career of conquest will\r\ncome to an end on the day when we learn to live like those whom we\r\nhave vanquished?\" He himself, by way of setting an example, now\r\nexposed himself to greater fatigues and hardships than ever in his\r\ncampaigns and hunting expeditions, so that old Lakon, who was with him\r\nwhen he slew a great lion, said, \"Alexander, you fought well with the\r\nlion for his kingdom.\" This hunting scene was afterwards represented\r\nby Kraterus at Delphi. He had figures made in bronze of Alexander and\r\nthe hounds fighting with the lion, and of himself running to help him.\r\nSome of the figures were executed by the sculptor Lysippus, and some\r\nby Leochares.\r\n\r\nXLI. Thus did Alexander risk his life in the vain endeavour to teach\r\nhis friends to live with simplicity and hardihood; but they, now that\r\nthey had become rich and important personages, desired to enjoy\r\nthemselves, and no longer cared for long marches and hard campaigns,\r\nso that at last they began to murmur against him, and speak ill of\r\nhim. He bore this with great gentleness at first, saying that it was\r\nthe part of a king to do his subjects good and to be ill-spoken of by\r\nthem in return. Indeed, he used to take advantage of the most trifling\r\nincidents to show the esteem he had for his intimate friends, of which\r\nI will now give a few examples.\r\n\r\nPeukestas once was bitten by a bear, while hunting. He wrote and told\r\nhis friends of his mishap, but kept it secret from Alexander. He, when\r\nhe heard of it, wrote to Peukestas, blaming him for having concealed\r\nhis hurt. \"But now,\" he writes, \"let me know how you are, and tell me\r\nif those who were hunting the bear with you deserted you, that I may\r\npunish them.\" When Hephæstion was absent on some business, he wrote to\r\nhim to say that Kraterus had been struck in the thighs with\r\nPerdikkas's spear, while they were amusing themselves by baiting an\r\nichneumon.\r\n\r\nWhen Peukestas recovered from some illness, he wrote to the physician\r\nAlexippus, congratulating him on the cure which he had effected. When\r\nKraterus was ill, Alexander had a dream about him, in consequence of\r\nwhich he offered sacrifice to certain gods, and bade him also\r\nsacrifice to them: and when Pausanias the physician wished to give\r\nKraterus a draught of hellebore, Alexander wrote to him, advising him\r\nto take the drug, but expressing the greatest anxiety about the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nHe imprisoned Ephialtes and Kissus, who were the first to bring him\r\nthe news that Harpalus had absconded, because he thought that they\r\nwrongfully accused him.\r\n\r\nWhen he was on the point of sending home all his invalided and\r\nsuperannuated soldiers, Eurylochus of Ægæ was found to have placed his\r\nname upon the list, although he was in perfect health. When\r\nquestioned, he confessed that he was in love with a lady named\r\nTelesippa, who was returning to the sea-coast, and that he had acted\r\nthus in order to be able to follow her. Alexander on hearing this,\r\nenquired who this lady was. Being told that she was a free-born Greek\r\ncourtezan, he answered, \"I sympathise with your affection, Eurylochus;\r\nbut since Telesippa is a free-born woman, let us try if we cannot,\r\neither by presents or arguments, persuade her to remain with us.\"\r\n\r\nXLII. It is wonderful how many letters and about what trifling matters\r\nhe found time to write to his friends. For instance, he sent a letter\r\nto Kilikia ordering search to be made for a slave boy belonging to\r\nSeleukus, who had run away, and praising Peukestas because he had\r\ncaptured Nikon, the runaway slave of Kraterus. He wrote also to\r\nMegabazus about a slave who had taken sanctuary in a temple, ordering\r\nhim to catch him when outside of the temple, if possible, but not to\r\nlay hands on him within its precincts.\r\n\r\nWe are told that when he was sitting as judge to hear men tried for\r\ntheir lives, he was wont to close one ear with his hand, while the\r\nprosecutor was speaking, in order that he might keep it unbiassed and\r\nimpartial to listen to what the accused had to say in his defence. But\r\nlater in his life, so many persons were accused before him, and so\r\nmany of them truly, that his temper became soured and he inclined to\r\nbelieve them to be all alike guilty. And he was especially\r\ntransported with rage, and made completely pitiless if any one spoke\r\nill of him, for he valued his reputation more than his life or his\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\nHe now set out again in pursuit of Darius, with the intention of\r\nfighting another battle with him: but on hearing that Darius had been\r\ntaken by the satrap Bessus, he dismissed all his Thessalian cavalry\r\nand sent them home, giving them a largess of two thousand talents over\r\nand above the pay which was due to them. He now set out on a long and\r\ntoilsome journey in pursuit of Darius, for in eleven days he rode more\r\nthan five hundred miles, so that his men were terribly distressed,\r\nespecially by want of water. One day he met some Macedonians who were\r\ncarrying water from a river in skins on the backs of mules. Seeing\r\nAlexander faint with thirst, as it was the hottest time of the day,\r\nthey quickly filled a helmet with water and gave it to him to drink.\r\nHe asked them to whom they were carrying the water, to which they\r\nanswered, \"To our own sons; but provided that you live, even if they\r\nshould die, we can beget other children.\" On hearing this he took the\r\nhelmet into his hands; but seeing all the horsemen around him eagerly\r\nwatching him and coveting the water, he gave it back without tasting\r\nit. He thanked the men for offering it to him, but said, \"If I alone\r\ndrink it, all these soldiers will be discontented.\" The soldiers, when\r\nthey saw the noble courage and self-denial of Alexander, bade him lead\r\nthem on boldly, and urged forward their horses, saying that they felt\r\nneither hunger nor thirst, and did not think themselves to be mortal\r\nmen, so long as they had such a king as Alexander to lead them.\r\n\r\nXLIII. The whole of his army was equally enthusiastic; yet the\r\nfatigues of the march were so great, that when Alexander burst into\r\nthe enemy's camp, only sixty men are said to have followed him. Here\r\nthey passed over great heaps of gold and silver, and pursued a long\r\nline of waggons, full of women and children, which were proceeding\r\nalong without any drivers, until they had reached the foremost of\r\nthem, because they imagined that Darius might be hidden in them. At\r\nlast he was found, lying in his chariot, pierced with innumerable\r\njavelins, and just breathing his last. He was able to ask for drink,\r\nand when given some cold water by Polystratus, he said to him, \"My\r\ngood sir, this is the worst of all my misfortunes that I am unable to\r\nrecompense you for your kindness to me; but Alexander will reward you,\r\nand the gods will reward Alexander for his courteous treatment of my\r\nmother and wife and daughters. Wherefore I pray thee, embrace him, as\r\nI embrace thee.\" With these words he took Polystratus by the hand and\r\ndied. When Alexander came up, he showed great grief at the sight, and\r\ncovered the body with his own cloak. He afterwards captured Bessus and\r\ntore him asunder, by bending down the tops of trees and tying\r\ndifferent parts of his body to each, and then letting them spring up\r\nagain so that each tore off the limb to which it was attached.\r\nAlexander now had the corpse of Darius adorned as became a prince, and\r\nsent it to his mother, while he received his brother Exathres into the\r\nnumber of his intimate friends.\r\n\r\nXLIV. He himself, with a few picked troops, now invaded Hyrkania,\r\nwhere he discovered an arm of the sea, which appeared to be as large\r\nas the Euxine, or Black Sea, but not so salt. He was unable to obtain\r\nany certain information about it, but conjectured it to be a branch of\r\nthe Mæotic lake.[416] Yet geographers, many years before Alexander,\r\nknew well that this, which is entitled the Hyrkanian or Caspian Sea,\r\nis the northernmost of four gulfs proceeding from the exterior ocean.\r\nHere some of the natives surprised the grooms in charge of his horse\r\nBoukephalus, and captured the animal. Alexander was much distressed at\r\nthis, and sent a herald to make proclamation that unless his horse\r\nwere restored to him, he would massacre the whole tribe with their\r\nwives and children. When, however, they brought back his horse, and\r\noffered to place their chief cities in his hands as a pledge for their\r\ngood behaviour, he treated them all with kindness, and paid a ransom\r\nfor the horse to those who had captured it.\r\n\r\nXLV. From hence he passed into Parthia, where, being at leisure, he\r\nfirst began to wear the Persian dress, either because he thought that\r\nhe should more easily win the hearts of the natives by conforming to\r\ntheir fashion, or else in order to try the obedience of his Macedonian\r\nsoldiers and see whether they might not, by degrees, be brought to pay\r\nhim the same respect and observance which the kings of Persia used to\r\nexact from their subjects. He did not, however, completely adopt the\r\nPersian costume, which would have been utterly repugnant to Grecian\r\nideas, and wore neither the trousers, the coat with long sleeves, nor\r\nthe tiara, but his dress, though less simple than the Macedonian, was\r\nstill far from being so magnificent or so effeminate as that of the\r\nPersians. He at first only wore this dress when giving audiences to\r\nthe natives of the country, or when alone with his more intimate\r\nfriends, but afterwards he frequently both drove out publicly and\r\ntransacted business in the Persian dress. The sight greatly offended\r\nthe Macedonians, but yet they were so filled with admiration for his\r\ncourage, that they felt he must be indulged in his fancies about\r\ndress; for besides all his other honourable wounds, he had only a\r\nshort time before this been struck by an arrow in the calf of his leg,\r\nso that splinters of the bone came out, and also received such a blow\r\nupon his neck from a stone, that his eyesight was affected for a\r\nconsiderable time afterwards. Yet he did not cease to expose himself\r\nto danger, but crossed the river Orexartes, which he himself thought\r\nto be the Tanais or Don, and, although suffering from an attack of\r\ndysentery, defeated the Scythians and chased them for many miles.\r\n\r\nXLVI. Most historians, amongst whom are Kleitarchus, Polykleitus,\r\nOnesikritus, Antigenes, and Istrus, say that while in this country he\r\nmet an Amazon: while Aristobulus, Chares the court-usher, Ptolemy,\r\nAntikleides, Philon of Thebes, and Philippus the herald of festivals,\r\nbesides Hekatæus of Eretria, Philip of Chalkis, and Douris of Samos,\r\nsay that this is a mere fiction. And this opinion seems to be\r\ncorroborated by Alexander himself: for he wrote to Antipater an exact\r\naccount of his Scythian campaign, and mentioned that the King of the\r\nScythians offered him his daughter in marriage, but says nothing about\r\nAmazons. It is said that many years afterwards, when Lysimachus had\r\nmade himself king, Onesikritus was reading aloud to him the fourth\r\nbook of his History of Alexander, in which mention is made of the\r\nAmazon. Lysimachus asked him with a quiet smile, \"And where was I all\r\nthe time?\" However, Alexander's fame is not impaired if we disbelieve\r\nthis story, nor is it increased if we regard it as true.\r\n\r\nXLVII. As he feared that the Macedonians would refuse to follow him\r\nany farther, he allowed the great mass of his army to repose itself,\r\nand advanced through Hyrkania with a force of twenty thousand infantry\r\nand three thousand cavalry, all picked men. In a speech addressed to\r\nthese select regiments, he declared that the natives of Asia had only\r\nseen them hitherto as if in a dream; and that, if they merely threw\r\nthe whole country into disorder and then retired from it, the Asiatics\r\nwould attack them as boldly as if they were so many women. Yet he\r\nsaid, that he permitted those who desired it to leave his service and\r\nreturn home, merely protesting against being left, with only his\r\npersonal friends and a few volunteers, to carry on the noble\r\nenterprise of making Macedonia mistress of the whole world. These are\r\nalmost the exact words which he uses in a letter to Antipater, and he\r\nfurther says that when he had spoken thus, the soldiers burst into a\r\nuniversal shout, bidding him lead them whithersoever he would. After\r\nthis experiment had succeeded with the select troops, it was no\r\ndifficult matter to induce the remainder to follow him, but they came\r\nalmost of their own accord. He now began to imitate the Asiatic habits\r\nmore closely, and endeavoured to assimilate the Macedonian and Asiatic\r\ncustoms and manners, hoping that by this means his empire, during his\r\nabsence, would rest upon a foundation of good will rather than of\r\nforce. To further this object he selected thirty thousand native\r\nyouths, whom he ordered to be taught to speak the Greek language and\r\nto use the same arms as the Macedonians; and appointed a numerous body\r\nof instructors for them. His marriage with Roxana was due to a genuine\r\npassion, for he was struck by her great beauty when he saw her dance\r\nin a chorus after a feast, but nevertheless the alliance was a very\r\npolitic one; for the natives were pleased to see him take a wife from\r\namong themselves, and were charmed with the courteous and honourable\r\nconduct of Alexander, who, although Roxana was the only woman whom he\r\nhad ever loved, yet would not approach her until he was lawfully\r\nmarried to her.\r\n\r\nAs Alexander perceived that, among his most intimate friends,\r\nHephæstion encouraged him and furthered his designs, while Kraterus\r\nsteadfastly adhered to the Macedonian customs, he made use of the\r\nlatter in all transactions with Asiatics, and of the former when\r\ndealing with Greeks and Macedonians. He loved Hephæstion, and\r\nrespected Kraterus above all the rest of his friends, and was wont to\r\nsay that Hephæstion loved Alexander, but that Kraterus loved the king.\r\nHis favour caused constant jealousies between them, so that once in\r\nIndia they actually drew their swords and fought with one another.\r\nTheir friends began to take part in the quarrel on either side, when\r\nAlexander rode up, and bitterly reproached Hephæstion before them all,\r\nsaying that he must be a fool and a madman if he did not see, that\r\nwithout Alexander's favour he would be nobody. Privately also he\r\nsharply rebuked Kraterus; and calling them both before him, made them\r\nbe friends again, swearing by Zeus Ammon, and all the gods, that they\r\nwere the two men whom he loved best in the world; but that if he heard\r\nof any more quarrelling between them he would put them both to death,\r\nor at least him who began the quarrel. In consequence of this, it is\r\nsaid that there never again, even in sport, was any dispute between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nXLVIII. Philotas, the son of Parmenio, was a man of much importance\r\namong the Macedonians; for he was courageous and hardy, and the most\r\nliberal man, and the most devoted to his friends in all the army\r\nexcept Alexander himself. We are told of him that once a friend of his\r\ncame to him to borrow money, and he at once commanded one of his\r\nservants to let him have it. His purse-bearer answered that he had no\r\nmoney, upon which Philotas exclaimed, \"What! Have I no plate or\r\nfurniture upon which you can raise money for my friend?\"\r\n\r\nHis lofty carriage, his immense wealth, and the splendour in which he\r\nlived, caused him to appear too great for a private station, while\r\nhis pride and vulgar ostentation made him generally disliked. His own\r\nfather, Parmenio, once said to him: \"My son, I pray you show a little\r\nmore humility.\" He had long been an object of suspicion to Alexander,\r\nwho was kept constantly informed about him by the following\r\nmeans:--After the battle of Issus, when the baggage of Darius was\r\ncaptured at Damascus, there was taken among the captives a beautiful\r\nGreek girl, named Antigone. She fell to the lot of Philotas, and\r\nbecame his mistress; and the young man, who was much enamoured of her,\r\nused to boast to her over his wine that all the conquests of the\r\nMacedonians were really due to the prowess of his father and himself,\r\nand that Alexander was merely a foolish boy, who owed his crown and\r\nhis empire to their exertions. Antigone repeated these expressions to\r\none of her friends, who, as was natural, did not keep them secret, so\r\nthat at last they reached the ears of Kraterus. Kraterus privately\r\nintroduced the woman to Alexander; and he, after he had heard her\r\nrepeat what she had been told, ordered her to take secret note of the\r\nconfidential expressions of Philotas, and to report them, from time to\r\ntime, to himself.\r\n\r\nXLIX. Philotas had no idea that he was being spied upon in this\r\nmanner, and in his conversation with Antigone frequently spoke\r\ninsolently and slightingly of his sovereign. Alexander, although he\r\nhad accumulated terrible proofs of treason against Philotas,\r\nnevertheless remained silent, either because he felt assured of the\r\nloyalty of Parmenio, or because he feared to attack a man of such\r\npower and importance. At length, however, a Macedonian of Chalastra,\r\nnamed Simnus, formed a plot against Alexander's life, and invited a\r\nyoung man, named Nikomachus, his own intimate friend, to join him.\r\nNikomachus refused compliance, and told the whole story of the plot to\r\nhis brother, Kebalinus, who at once had an interview with Philotas,\r\nand bade him bring them at once to Alexander, as persons who had a\r\nmost important communication to make to him. Philotas, however, for\r\nsome reason or other, did not bring them before Alexander, but said\r\nthat the king was not at leisure to hear them, as he was engaged in\r\nmore important business. This he repeated on a second occasion, and\r\nas his behaviour made the two brothers suspect his loyalty, they\r\ncommunicated with another officer, and by his means obtained an\r\naudience. They now told Alexander about the design of Limnus, and also\r\nsaid that Philotas had acted very luke-warmly in the matter, as they\r\nhad twice told him that there was a plot against Alexander, and yet he\r\nhad, on each occasion, disregarded their warning.\r\n\r\nThis greatly enraged Alexander: and as when Limnus was arrested he\r\ndefended himself desperately and was killed in the scuffle, he was yet\r\nmore disturbed, as he feared he had now lost all clue to the plot. He\r\nnow openly showed his displeasure with Philotas, and encouraged all\r\nhis enemies to say boldly that it was folly of the king to imagine\r\nthat an obscure man like Limnus would have ventured to form a\r\nconspiracy against his life, but that Limnus was merely a tool in the\r\nhands of some more powerful person; and that if he wished to discover\r\nthe real authors of the plot, he must seek for them among those who\r\nwould have been most benefited by its success. Finding that the king\r\nlent a ready ear to suggestions of this kind, they soon furnished him\r\nwith an overwhelming mass of evidence of the treasonable designs of\r\nPhilotas. Philotas was at once arrested, and put to the torture in the\r\npresence of the chief officers of the Macedonian army, while Alexander\r\nhimself sat behind a curtain to hear what he would say. It is said\r\nthat when Alexander heard Philotas piteously beg Hephæstion for mercy,\r\nhe exclaimed aloud, \"Are you such a coward as this, Philotas, and yet\r\ncontrive such daring plots?\" To be brief, Philotas was put to death,\r\nand immediately afterwards Alexander sent to Media and caused Parmenio\r\nto be assassinated, although he was a man who had performed the most\r\nimportant services for Philip, had, more than any other of the older\r\nMacedonians, encouraged Alexander to invade Asia, and had seen two of\r\nhis three sons die in battle before he perished with the third. This\r\ncruelty made many of the friends of Alexander fear him, and especially\r\nAntipater,[417] who now formed a secret league with the Ætolians, who\r\nalso feared Alexander because when he heard of the destruction of the\r\npeople of Œneadæ, he said that he himself, and not the sons of the\r\npeople of Œneadæ, would be revenged upon the Ætolians.\r\n\r\nL. Not long after this followed the murder of Kleitus, which, if\r\nsimply told, seems more cruel than that of Philotas; but if we\r\nconsider the circumstances under which it took place, and the\r\nprovocation which was given, we shall treat it rather as a misfortune\r\nwhich befel Alexander during a fit of drunken passion than as a\r\ndeliberate act. It happened as follows. Some men came from the\r\nsea-coast, bringing Greek grapes as a present to Alexander. He admired\r\ntheir bloom and ripeness, and invited Kleitus to see them, meaning to\r\npresent him with some of them. Kleitus was engaged in offering\r\nsacrifice, but on receiving this summons left his sacrifice and went\r\nto the king: upon which, three of the sheep which he was about to\r\noffer up as victims, followed him. When Alexander heard of this, he\r\nconsulted his soothsayers, Aristander, and Kleomantes the Laconian. As\r\nthey reported that this was an evil omen, he bade them at once offer\r\nan expiatory sacrifice on behalf of Kleitus; for he himself, three\r\ndays before, had dreamed a strange dream about Kleitus, that he had\r\nseen him sitting dressed in black amongst the sons of Parmenio, who\r\nwere all of them dead. Before, however, the sacrifices on behalf of\r\nKleitus had been performed, he came to the banquet, before which\r\nAlexander himself had offered sacrifice to the Dioskuri.\r\n\r\nAfter all had drunk heavily, a song was sung which had been composed\r\nby one Pranichus, or Pierion according to some writers, in which the\r\ngenerals who had recently been defeated by the barbarians were held up\r\nto public shame and ridicule. The elder Macedonians were vexed at\r\nthis, and blamed both the writer of the song and the man who sung it,\r\nbut Alexander and his associates were much pleased with it, and bade\r\nthe singer go on. Kleitus, who was now very much excited by drink and\r\nwho was naturally of a fierce and independent temper, was especially\r\nannoyed, and said that it was not right for Macedonians to be thus\r\ninsulted in the presence of enemies and barbarians, for that, in spite\r\nof their misfortune, they were far braver men than those who ridiculed\r\nthem. Alexander answered that Kleitus, when he called cowardice a\r\nmisfortune, was no doubt pleading his own cause: at which reproach\r\nKleitus sprang to his feet, and exclaimed, \"my cowardice at any rate\r\nsaved the life of the son of the gods, when he turned his back to the\r\nsword of Spithridates; so that now, by the blood and wounds of the\r\nMacedonians, you have become so great a man that you pretend to be the\r\nchild of Ammon, and disown your father Philip.\"\r\n\r\nLI. Alexander, stung to the quick by these words, said, \"Villain, do\r\nyou suppose that you will be allowed to spread these calumnies against\r\nme, rendering the Macedonians disaffected, and yet go unpunished?\"\r\n\"Too much are we punished,\" answered Kleitus, \"when we see such a\r\nreward as this given us for all our hard service, but we congratulate\r\nthose of us who are dead, because they died before they saw\r\nMacedonians beaten with Median rods, and begging Persian attendants to\r\nprocure them an audience of their king.\" When Kleitus spoke his mind\r\nthus boldly, Alexander's intimate friends answered with bitter\r\nreproaches, but the older men endeavoured to pacify them. Alexander\r\nnow turning to Xenodochus of Kardia and Astenius of Kolophon, asked,\r\n\"Do not the Greeks seem to you to treat the Macedonians as if they\r\nwere beasts, and they themselves were more than mortal men? \"Kleitus,\r\nhowever, would not hold his peace, but went on to say that if\r\nAlexander could not bear to hear men speak their mind, he had better\r\nnot invite free-born people to his table, and ought to confine himself\r\nto the society of barbarians and slaves who would pay respect to his\r\nPersian girdle and striped[418] tunic. At this speech Alexander could\r\nno longer restrain his passion, but seized an apple from the table,\r\nhurled it at Kleitus, and began to feel for his dagger. Aristophanes,\r\none of his body-guard, had already secreted it, and the rest now\r\npressed round him imploring him to be quiet. He however leaped to his\r\nfeet, and, as if in a great emergency, shouted in the Macedonian\r\ntongue to the foot-guards to turn out. He bade the trumpeter sound an\r\nalarm, and as the man hesitated and refused, struck him with his fist.\r\nThis man afterwards gained great credit for his conduct, as it was\r\nthought that by it he had saved the whole camp from being thrown into\r\nan uproar. As Kleitus would not retract what he had said, his friends\r\nseized him and forced him out of the room. But he re-entered by\r\nanother door, and in an offensive and insolent tone began to recite\r\nthe passage from the Andromache of Euripides, which begins,\r\n\r\n     \"Ah me! in Greece an evil custom reigns,\" &c.\r\n\r\nUpon this Alexander snatched a lance from one of his guards, and ran\r\nKleitus through the body with it, just as he was drawing aside the\r\ncurtain and preparing to enter the room. Kleitus fell with a loud\r\ngroan, and died on the spot. Alexander, when he came to himself, and\r\nsaw his friends all standing round in mute reproach, snatched the\r\nspear out of the corpse, and would have thrust it into his own neck,\r\nbut was forcibly witheld by his guards, who laid hold of him and\r\ncarried him into his bed-chamber.\r\n\r\nLII. Alexander spent the whole night in tears, and on the next day was\r\nso exhausted by his agony of grief as to be speechless, and only able\r\nto sigh heavily. At length his friends, alarmed at his silence, broke\r\ninto the room. He took no notice of any of their attempts at\r\nconsolation, except that he seemed to make signs of assent when\r\nAristander the soothsayer told him that all this had been preordained\r\nto take place, and reminded him of his dream about Kleitus. His\r\nfriends now brought to him Kallisthenes the philosopher, who was a\r\nnephew of Aristotle, and Anaxarchus of Abdera. Kallisthenes\r\nendeavoured to soothe his grief, by kind and gentle consolation, but\r\nAnaxarchus, a man who had always pursued an original method of his own\r\nin philosophical speculations, and who was thought to be overbearing\r\nand harsh-tempered by his friends, as soon as he entered the room\r\nexclaimed, \"This is that Great Alexander, upon whom the eyes of the\r\nworld are fixed: there he lies like a slave, fearing what men will say\r\nof him, although he ought rather to dictate to them what they should\r\nthink right, as becomes the master of the world, and not to be\r\ninfluenced by their foolish opinions. Know you not,\" asked he \"that\r\nLaw and Justice sit beside the throne of Zeus, and make everything\r\nwhich is done by those in power to be lawful and right?\" By such\r\ndiscourse as this Anaxarchus assuaged Alexander's sorrow, but\r\nencouraged his savage and lawless disposition. He gained great favour\r\nfor himself, and was able to influence Alexander against Kallisthenes,\r\nwho was already no favourite with him on account of his upright,\r\nuncompromising spirit. It is related that once at table, when the\r\nconversation turned upon the seasons, and upon the climate of Asia,\r\nKallisthenes argued that it was colder in the country where they were\r\nthan in Greece; and when Anaxarchus vehemently contradicted this, he\r\nsaid, \"Why, you must admit that this country is the colder of the two;\r\nfor in Greece you used to wear only one cloak all through the winter,\r\nwhereas here you sit down to dinner wrapped in three Persian rugs.\"\r\nThis reply made Anaxarchus more his enemy than before.\r\n\r\nLIII. Kallisthenes made all the sophists and flatterers of Alexander\r\njealous of him because he was much sought after by the young men for\r\nhis learning, and was liked by the elder men on account of his sober,\r\ndignified, and austere life, which confirmed the common report, that\r\nhe had come to the court of Alexander with the intention of prevailing\r\nupon him to refound his native city, and collect together its\r\nscattered citizens. His high moral character gained him many enemies,\r\nbut he himself gave some colour to their accusations by his conduct in\r\nconstantly refusing all invitations, and by behaving himself with\r\ngravity and silence when in society, as if he were displeased with his\r\ncompany. His manner had caused Alexander himself to say of him, \"I\r\nhate a philosopher who is not wise in his own interest.\" It is related\r\nthat once at a great banquet, when sitting over their wine,\r\nKallisthenes was asked to speak in praise of the Macedonians, and that\r\nhe at once poured forth such a fluent and splendid eulogy that all the\r\ncompany rose, vehemently applauding, and threw their garlands to him.\r\nAt this Alexander remarked that, as Euripides says,\r\n\r\n     \"On noble subjects, all men can speak well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said he, \"show us your ability by blaming the Macedonians, in\r\norder that they may be made better men by having their shortcomings\r\npointed out.\" Kallisthenes hereupon began to speak in a depreciatory\r\nstrain, and told many home-truths about the Macedonians, pointing out\r\nthat Philip had become strong only because Greece was weakened by\r\nfaction, and quoting the line,\r\n\r\n     \"In times of trouble, bad men rise to fame.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech caused the Macedonians to hate him most bitterly, and\r\nprovoked Alexander to say that Kallisthenes had made a display, not of\r\nhis own abilities, but of his dislike to the Macedonians.\r\n\r\nLIV. This is the account which Strœbus, Kallisthenes's reader, is said\r\nby Hermippus to have given to Aristotle about the quarrel between\r\nKallisthenes and Alexander; and he added that Kallisthenes was well\r\naware that he was out of favour with the king, and twice or thrice\r\nwhen setting out to wait on him would repeat the line from the Iliad,\r\n\r\n     \"Patroklus, too, hath died, a better man than thou.\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing this Aristotle acutely remarked, that Kallisthenes had\r\ngreat ability and power of speech, but no common sense. He, like a\r\ntrue philosopher, refused to kneel and do homage to Alexander, and\r\nalone had the spirit to express in public what all the oldest and best\r\nMacedonians privately felt. By his refusal he relieved the Greeks and\r\nAlexander from a great disgrace, but ruined himself, because he seemed\r\nto use force rather than persuasion to attain his object. We are told\r\nby Charon of Mitylene that once when at table, Alexander, after\r\ndrinking, passed the cup to one of his friends; and that he after\r\nreceiving it, rose, stood by the hearth, and after drinking knelt\r\nbefore Alexander: after which he kissed him and resumed his seat. All\r\nthe guests did this in turn until the cup came to Kallisthenes. The\r\nking, who was conversing to Hephæstion, did not take any notice of\r\nwhat he did, and after drinking he also came forward to kiss him, when\r\nDemetrius, who was surnamed Pheidon, said, \"My king, do not kiss him,\r\nfor he alone has not done homage to you.\" Upon this Alexander avoided\r\nkissing Kallisthenes, who said in a loud voice, \"Then I will go away\r\nwith the loss of a kiss.\"\r\n\r\nLV. The breach thus formed was widened by Hephæstion, who declared\r\nthat Kallisthenes had agreed with him to kneel before Alexander, and\r\nthen had broken his compact; and this story was believed by Alexander.\r\nAfter this came Lysimachus and Hagnon, and many others, who accused\r\nKallisthenes of giving himself great airs, as though he were a queller\r\nof despots, and said that he had a large following among the younger\r\nmen, who looked up to him as being the only free man among so many\r\nmyriads of people. These accusations were more easily believed to be\r\ntrue because at this time the plot of Hermolaus was discovered; and it\r\nwas said that when Hermolaus enquired of Kallisthenes how one might\r\nbecome the most famous man in the world, he answered, \"By killing the\r\nmost famous man in the world.\" He was even said to have encouraged\r\nHermolaus to make the attempt, bidding him have no fear of Alexander's\r\ngolden throne, and reminding him that he would have to deal with a man\r\nwho was both wounded and in ill-health. Yet none of those concerned in\r\nHermolaus's conspiracy mentioned the name of Kallisthenes, even under\r\nthe most exquisite tortures. Alexander himself, in the letters which\r\nhe wrote to Kraterus, Attalus, and Alketas immediately after the\r\ndiscovery of the plot, states that the royal pages, when put to the\r\ntorture, declared that they alone had conspired, and that they had no\r\naccomplices. \"The pages,\" Alexander goes on to say, \"were stoned to\r\ndeath by the Macedonians, but I will myself punish the sophist, and\r\nthose who sent him hither, and those who receive into their cities men\r\nthat plot against me.\" In these words he evidently alludes to\r\nAristotle: for Kallisthenes was brought up in his house, being the son\r\nof Hero, Aristotle's first cousin. Some writers tell us that\r\nKallisthenes was hanged by the orders of Alexander; others that he was\r\nthrown into chains and died of sickness. Chares informs us that he was\r\nkept in confinement for seven months, in order that he might be tried\r\nin the presence of Aristotle himself, but that during the time when\r\nAlexander was wounded in India, he died of excessive corpulence,\r\ncovered with vermin.\r\n\r\nLVI. This, however, took place after the period of which we write. At\r\nthis time Demaratus of Corinth, although an elderly man, was induced\r\nto travel as far as the court of Alexander: and when he beheld him,\r\nsaid that the Greeks who had died before they saw Alexander sitting\r\nupon the throne of Darius, had lost one of the greatest pleasures in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nDemaratus by this speech gained great favour with the king, but lived\r\nbut a short time to enjoy it, as he was soon carried off by sickness.\r\nHis funeral was conducted with the greatest magnificence, for the\r\nwhole army was employed to raise a mound of great extent, and eighty\r\ncubits high, as a memorial of him; while his remains were placed in a\r\nsplendidly equipped four-horse chariot and sent back to the sea-coast.\r\n\r\nLVII. As Alexander was now about to invade India, and observed that\r\nhis army had become unwieldy and difficult to move in consequence of\r\nthe mass of plunder with which the soldiers were encumbered, he\r\ncollected all the baggage-waggons together one morning at daybreak,\r\nand first burned his own and those of his companions, after which he\r\nordered those of the Macedonians to be set on fire. This measure\r\nappears to have been more energetic than the occasion really required;\r\nand yet it proved more ruinous in the design than in the execution:\r\nfor although some of the soldiers were vexed at the order, most of\r\nthem with enthusiastic shouts distributed their most useful property\r\namong those who were in want, burning and destroying all the rest with\r\na cheerful alacrity which raised Alexander's spirits to the highest\r\npitch. Yet Alexander was terrible and pitiless in all cases of\r\ndereliction of duty. He put to death Menander, one of his personal\r\nfriends, because he did not remain in a fort, where he had been\r\nappointed to command the garrison; and he shot dead with his own hand\r\nOrsodates, a native chief who had revolted from him. At this time it\r\nhappened that a ewe brought forth a lamb, upon whose head was a tiara\r\nin shape and colour like that of the King of Persia, with stones\r\nhanging on each side of it.\r\n\r\nAlexander, much disturbed at this portent, was purified by the\r\npriests at Babylon, whom he was accustomed to make use of for this\r\npurpose, but told his friends that he was alarmed for their sake, and\r\nnot for his own, as he feared that if he fell, heaven might transfer\r\nhis crown to some unworthy and feeble successor. However, he was soon\r\ncheered by a better omen. The chief of Alexander's household servants,\r\na Macedonian named Proxenus, while digging a place to pitch the royal\r\ntent near the river Oxus, discovered a well, full of a smooth, fatty\r\nliquid. When the upper layer was removed, there spouted forth a clear\r\noil, exactly like olive oil in smell and taste, and incomparably\r\nbright and clear: and that, too, in a country where no olive trees\r\ngrew. It is said that the water of the Oxus itself is very soft and\r\npleasant, and that it causes the skin of those who bathe in it to\r\nbecome sleek and glossy. Alexander was greatly delighted with this\r\ndiscovery, as we learn from a letter which he wrote to Antipater, in\r\nwhich he speaks of this as being one of the most important and\r\nmanifest signs of the divine favour which had ever been vouchsafed to\r\nhim. The soothsayers held that the omen portended, that the campaign\r\nwould be glorious, but laborious and difficult: for oil has been given\r\nby the gods to men to refresh them after labour.\r\n\r\nLVIII. Alexander when on this expedition ran terrible risks in battle,\r\nand was several times grievously wounded. His greatest losses were\r\ncaused, however, by the want of provisions, and by the severity of the\r\nclimate. He himself, striving to overcome fortune by valour, thought\r\nnothing impossible to a brave man, and believed that, while daring\r\ncould surmount all obstacles, cowardice could not be safe behind any\r\ndefences. We are told that when he was besieging the fortress of\r\nSisymithres, which was placed upon a steep and inaccessible rock, his\r\nsoldiers despaired of being able to take it. He asked Oxyartes what\r\nsort of a man Sisymithres himself was in respect of courage. When\r\nOxyartes answered that he was the greatest coward in the world,\r\nAlexander said 'You tell me, that the fortress can be taken; for its\r\nspirit is weak.\" And indeed he did take it, by playing upon the fears\r\nof Sisymithres. Once he was attacking another fortress, also situated\r\nupon the top of a lofty rock. While he was addressing words of\r\nencouragement to the younger Macedonians, finding that one of them was\r\nnamed Alexander, he said \"You must this day prove yourself a brave\r\nman, if but for your name's sake.\" The youth fought most bravely, but\r\nfell, to the great grief of Alexander. When he reached the city named\r\nNysa,[419] the Macedonians were unwilling to attack it, because a very\r\ndeep river ran past its walls. \"Unlucky that I am,\" exclaimed\r\nAlexander, \"why did I never learn to swim?\" Saying thus, he prepared\r\nto cross the river just as he was, with his shield upon his left arm.\r\nAfter an unsuccessful assault, ambassadors were sent by the besieged,\r\nwho were surprised to find Alexander dressed in his armour, covered\r\nwith dust and blood. A cushion was now brought to him, and he bade the\r\neldest of the ambassadors seat himself upon it. This man was named\r\nAkouphis: and he was so much struck with the splendid courtesy of\r\nAlexander, that he asked him what his countrymen must do, in order to\r\nmake him their friend. Alexander replied that they must make Akouphis\r\ntheir chief, and send a hundred of their best men to him. Upon this\r\nAkouphis laughed, and answered: \"I shall rule them better, O King, if\r\nI send the worst men to you and not the best.\"\r\n\r\nLIX. There was one Taxiles,[420] who was said to be king of a part of\r\nIndia as large as Egypt, with a rich and fertile soil. He was also a\r\nshrewd man, and came and embraced Alexander, saying, \"Why should we\r\ntwo fight one another, Alexander, since you have not come to take away\r\nfrom us the water which we drink nor the food which we eat; and these\r\nare the only things about which it is worth while for sensible men to\r\nfight? As for all other kinds of property, if I have more than you, I\r\nam willing to bestow it upon you, or, if you are the richer, I would\r\nwillingly be placed in your debt by receiving some from you.\"\r\nAlexander was delighted with these words, and giving him his right\r\nhand as a pledge of his friendship exclaimed, \"Perhaps you suppose\r\nthat by this arrangement we shall become friends without a contest;\r\nbut you are mistaken, for I will contend with you in good offices, and\r\nwill take care that you do not overcome me.\" Saying thus, they\r\nexchanged presents, amongst which Alexander gave Taxiles a thousand\r\ntalents of coined money. This conduct of his greatly vexed his\r\nfriends; but caused him to be much more favourably regarded by many of\r\nthe natives.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Alexander, who had suffered great losses from the Indian\r\nmercenary troops who flocked to defend the cities which he attacked,\r\nmade a treaty of alliance with them in a certain town, and afterwards,\r\nas they were going away set upon them while they were on the road and\r\nkilled them all. This is the greatest blot upon his fame; for in all\r\nthe rest of his wars, he always acted with good faith as became a\r\nking. He was also much troubled by the philosophers who attended him,\r\nbecause they reproached those native princes who joined him, and\r\nencouraged the free states to revolt and regain their independence.\r\nFor this reason, he caused not a few of them to be hanged.\r\n\r\nLX. His campaign against king Porus is described at length in his own\r\nletters. He tells us that the river Hydaspes[421] ran between the two\r\ncamps, and that Porus with his elephants watched the further bank, and\r\nprevented his crossing. Alexander himself every day caused a great\r\nnoise and disturbance to be made in his camp, in order that the enemy\r\nmight be led to disregard his movements: and at last upon a dark and\r\nstormy night he took a division of infantry and the best of the\r\ncavalry, marched to a considerable distance from the enemy, and\r\ncrossed over into an island of no great extent. Here he was exposed to\r\na terrible storm of rain, with thunder and lightning; but, although\r\nseveral of his men were struck dead, he pressed on, crossed the\r\nisland, and gained the furthermost bank of the river. The Hydaspes was\r\nflooded by the rain, and the stream ran fiercely down this second\r\nbranch, while the Macedonians could with difficulty keep their\r\nfooting upon this slippery and uneven bottom Here it was that\r\nAlexander is said to have exclaimed, \"O ye Athenians, what toils do I\r\nundergo to obtain your praise.\"\r\n\r\nThis, however, rests only on the authority of the historian\r\nOneskritus, for Alexander himself relates that they abandoned their\r\nrafts, and waded through this second torrent under arms, with the\r\nwater up to their breasts. After crossing, he himself rode on some\r\ntwenty furlongs in advance of the infantry, thinking that if the enemy\r\nmet him with their cavalry alone, he would be able to rout them\r\neasily, and that, if they advanced their entire force, before a battle\r\ncould be begun, he would be joined by his own infantry. And indeed he\r\nsoon fell in with a thousand horse and sixty war chariots of the\r\nenemy, which he routed, capturing all the chariots, and slaying four\r\nhundred of the horsemen. Porus now perceived that Alexander himself\r\nhad crossed the river, and advanced to attack him with all his army,\r\nexcept only a detachment which he left to prevent the Macedonians from\r\ncrossing the river at their camp. Alexander, alarmed at the great\r\nnumbers of the enemy, and at their elephants, did not attack their\r\ncentre, but charged them on the left wing, ordering Koinus to attack\r\nthem on the right. The enemy on each wing were routed, but retired\r\ntowards their main body, where the elephants stood. Here an obstinate\r\nand bloody contest took place, insomuch that it was the eighth hour of\r\nthe day before the Indians were finally overcome. These particulars we\r\nare told by the chief actor in the battle himself, in his letters.\r\nMost historians are agreed that Porus stood four cubits[422] and a\r\nspan high, and was so big a man that when mounted on his elephant,\r\nalthough it was a very large one, he seemed as well proportioned to\r\nthe animal as an ordinary man is to a horse. This elephant showed\r\nwonderful sagacity and care for its king, as while he was still\r\nvigorous it charged the enemy and overthrew them, but when it\r\nperceived that he was fainting from his wounds, fearing that he might\r\nfall, it quietly knelt on the ground, and then gently drew the spears\r\nout of his body with its trunk. When Porus was captured, Alexander\r\nasked him how he wished to be treated. \"Like a king,\" answered Porus.\r\nAlexander then enquired if he had nothing else to ask about his\r\ntreatment. \"Everything,\" answered Porus, \"is comprised in these words,\r\nlike a king.\" Alexander now replaced Porus in his kingdom, with the\r\ntitle of satrap, and also added a large province to it, subduing the\r\nindependent inhabitants. This country was said to have contained\r\nfifteen separate tribes, five thousand considerable cities and\r\ninnumerable villages; besides another district three times as large,\r\nover which he appointed Philippus, one of his personal friends, to be\r\nsatrap.\r\n\r\nLXI. After this battle with Porus, Alexander's horse Boukephalus died,\r\nnot immediately, but some time afterwards. Most historians say that he\r\ndied of wounds received in the battle, but Onesikritus tells us that\r\nhe died of old age and overwork, for he had reached his thirtieth\r\nyear. Alexander was greatly grieved at his loss, and sorrowed for him\r\nas much as if he had lost one of his most intimate friends. He founded\r\na city as a memorial of him upon the banks of the Hydaspes, which he\r\nnamed Boukephalia. It is also recorded that when he lost a favourite\r\ndog called Peritas, which he had brought up from a whelp, and of which\r\nhe was very fond, he founded a city and called it by the dog's name.\r\nThe historian Sotion tells us that he heard this from Potamon of\r\nLesbos.\r\n\r\nLXII. The battle with King Porus made the Macedonians very unwilling\r\nto advance farther into India. They had overcome Porus with the\r\ngreatest difficulty, as he brought against them a force of twenty\r\nthousand infantry and two thousand cavalry, and now offered the most\r\nviolent opposition to Alexander, who wished to cross the river Ganges.\r\nThis river, they heard, was thirty-two furlongs wide and a hundred\r\ncubits deep, while its further banks were completely covered with\r\narmed men, horses and elephants, for it was said that the kings of the\r\nGandaritæ and Præsiæ were awaiting his attack with an army of eighty\r\nthousand horsemen, two hundred thousand foot soldiers, eight thousand\r\nwar chariots, and six thousand elephants; nor was this any\r\nexaggeration, for not long afterwards Androkottus, the king of this\r\ncountry, presented five hundred elephants to Seleukus, and overran and\r\nsubdued the whole of India with an army of six hundred thousand men.\r\n\r\nAlexander at first retired to his tent in a rage, and shut himself up\r\nthere, not feeling any gratitude to those who had prevented his\r\ncrossing the Ganges, but regarding a retreat as an acknowledgment of\r\ndefeat. However, after his friends had argued with him, and his\r\nsoldiers had come to the door of his tent, begging him with tears in\r\ntheir eyes to go no farther, he relented, and gave orders for a\r\nretreat. He now contrived many ingenious devices to impress the\r\nnatives, as, for instance, he caused arms, and bridles and mangers for\r\nhorses to be made of much more than the usual size, and left them\r\nscattered about. He also set up altars, which even to the present day\r\nare reverenced by the kings of the Præsiæ, who cross the river to\r\nthem, and offer sacrifice upon them in the Greek fashion. Androkottus\r\nhimself, who was then a lad, saw Alexander himself and afterwards used\r\nto declare that Alexander might easily have conquered the whole\r\ncountry, as the then king was hated by his subjects on account of his\r\nmean and wicked disposition.\r\n\r\nLXIII. After this, Alexander wishing to see the outer ocean,[423]\r\ncaused many rafts and vessels managed with oars to be built, and\r\nproceeded in a leisurely manner down the Indus. His voyage, however,\r\nwas not an idle one, nor was it unaccompanied with danger, for as he\r\npassed down the river, he disembarked, attacked the tribes on the\r\nbanks, and subdued them all. When he was among the Malli, who are said\r\nto be the most warlike tribe in India, he very nearly lost his life.\r\nHe was besieging their chief city, and after the garrison had been\r\ndriven from the walls by volleys of missiles, he was the first man to\r\nascend a scaling ladder and mount the walls. The ladder now broke, so\r\nthat no more could mount, and as the enemy began to assemble inside at\r\nthe foot of the wall and shoot up at him from below, Alexander, alone\r\nagainst a host, leaped down amongst them, and by good luck, alighted\r\non his feet. His armour rattled loudly as he leaped, and made the\r\nnatives think that a bright light was emitted from his body; so that\r\nat first they gave way and fled from him. But when they saw that he\r\nwas attended by only two followers, some of them attacked him at close\r\nquarters with swords and spears, while one standing a little way off\r\nshot an arrow at him with such force and with such good aim, that it\r\npassed through his corslet and imbedded itself in the bones of his\r\nbreast. As he shrank back when the arrow struck him, the man who had\r\nshot it ran up to him with a drawn sword in his hand. Peukestas and\r\nLimnæus now stood before Alexander to protect him. Both were wounded,\r\nLimnæus mortally; but Peukestas managed to stand firm, while Alexander\r\ndespatched the Indian with his own hand. Alexander was wounded in many\r\nplaces, and at last received a blow on the neck with a club, which\r\nforced him to lean his back against the wall, still facing the enemy.\r\nThe Macedonians now swarmed round him, snatched him up just as he\r\nfainted away, and carried him insensible to his tent. A rumour now ran\r\nthrough the camp that he was dead, and his attendants with great\r\ndifficulty sawed through the wooden shaft of the arrow, and so got off\r\nhis corslet. They next had to pluck out the barbed head of the arrow,\r\nwhich was firmly fixed in one of his ribs. This arrow-head is said to\r\nhave measured four fingers-breadths[424] in length, and three in\r\nwidth. When it was pulled out, he swooned away, so that he nearly\r\ndied, but at length recovered his strength. When he was out of danger,\r\nthough still very weak, as he had to keep himself under careful\r\ntreatment for a long time, he heard a disturbance without, and\r\nlearning that the Macedonians were anxious to see him, took his cloak\r\nand went out to them. After sacrificing to the gods for the recovery\r\nof his health, he started again on his journey, and passed through a\r\ngreat extent of country and past many considerable cities, all of\r\nwhich he subdued.\r\n\r\nLXIV. He captured ten of the Indian philosophers called\r\nGymnosophistæ;[425] who had been instrumental in causing Sabbas to\r\nrevolt, and had done much mischief to the Macedonians. These men are\r\nrenowned for their short, pithy answers, and Alexander put difficult\r\nquestions to all of them, telling them that he would first put to\r\ndeath the man who answered him worst, and so the rest in order. The\r\nfirst was asked, whether he thought the living or the dead to be the\r\nmore numerous. He answered, \"The living, for the dead are not.\"\r\n\r\nThe second was asked, which breeds the largest animals, the sea or the\r\nland. He answered, \"The land, for the sea is only a part of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe third was asked, which is the cleverest of beasts. He answered,\r\n\"That which man has not yet discovered.\"\r\n\r\nThe fourth was asked why he made Sabbas rebel. He answered, \"Because I\r\nwished him either to live or to die with honour.\"\r\n\r\nThe fifth was asked, which he thought was first, the day or the night.\r\nHe answered, \"The day was first, by one day.\" As he saw that the king\r\nwas surprised at this answer, he added, \"impossible questions require\r\nimpossible answers.\"\r\n\r\nAlexander now asked the sixth how a man could make himself most\r\nbeloved. He answered, \"By being very powerful, and yet not feared by\r\nhis subjects.\"\r\n\r\nOf the remaining three, the first one was asked, how a man could\r\nbecome a god. He answered, \"By doing that which is impossible for a\r\nman to do.\"\r\n\r\nThe next was asked, which was the stronger, life or death. He\r\nanswered, \"Life, because it endures such terrible suffering.\"\r\n\r\nThe last, being asked how long it was honourable for a man to live,\r\nanswered, \"As long as he thinks it better for him to live than to\r\ndie.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this Alexander turned to the judge and asked him to pronounce\r\nhis decision. He said that they had answered each one worse than the\r\nother. \"Then,\" said Alexander, \"you shall yourself be put to death for\r\nhaving given such a verdict.\" \"Not so,\" said he, \"O king, unless you\r\nmean to belie your own words, for you said at the beginning that you\r\nwould put to death him who gave the worst answer.\"\r\n\r\nLXV. Alexander now gave them presents and dismissed them unhurt. He\r\nalso sent Onesikritus to the most renowned of them, who lived a life\r\nof serene contemplation, desiring that they would come to him. This\r\nOnesikritus was a philosopher of the school of Diogenes the cynic. One\r\nof the Indians, named Kalanus, is said to have received him very\r\nrudely, and to have proudly bidden him to take off his clothes and\r\nspeak to him naked, as otherwise he would not hold any conversation\r\nwith him, even if he came from Zeus himself. Dandamis, another of the\r\nGymnosophists, was of a milder mood, and when he had been told of\r\nSokrates, Pythagoras, and Diogenes, said that they appeared to him to\r\nhave been wise men, but to have lived in too great bondage to the\r\nlaws. Other writers say that Dandamis said nothing more than \"For what\r\npurpose has Alexander come all the way hither?\" However, Taxiles\r\npersuaded Kalanus to visit Alexander. His real name was Sphines: but\r\nas in the Indian tongue he saluted all he met with the word 'Kale,'\r\nthe Greeks named him Kalanus. This man is said to have shown to\r\nAlexander a figure representing his empire, in the following manner.\r\nHe flung on the ground a dry, shrunken hide, and then trod upon the\r\noutside of it, but when he trod it down in one place, it rose up in\r\nall the others. He walked all round the edge of it, and showed that\r\nthis kept taking place until at length he stepped into the middle, and\r\nso made it all lie flat. This image was intended to signify that\r\nAlexander ought to keep his strength concentrated in the middle of his\r\nempire, and not wander about on distant journeys.\r\n\r\nLXVI. Alexander's voyage down the Indus and its tributaries, to the\r\nsea-coast, took seven months. On reaching the ocean he sailed to an\r\nisland which he himself called Skillustis, but which was generally\r\nknown as Psiltukis. Here he landed and sacrificed to the gods, after\r\nwhich he explored the sea and the coast as far as he could reach.\r\nHaving done this, he turned back, after praying to the gods that no\r\nconqueror might ever transcend this, the extreme limit of his\r\nconquests. He ordered his fleet to follow the line of the coast,\r\nkeeping India on their right hand: and he gave Nearchus the supreme\r\ncommand, with Onesikritus as chief pilot. He, himself, marched through\r\nthe country of the Oreitæ, where he endured terrible sufferings from\r\nscarcity of provisions, and lost so many men that he scarcely brought\r\nback home from India the fourth part of his army, which originally\r\namounted to a hundred and twenty thousand foot, and fifteen thousand\r\nhorse. Most of the men perished from sickness, bad food, and the\r\nexcessive heat of the sun, and many from sheer hunger, as they had to\r\nmarch through an uncultivated region, inhabited only by a few\r\nmiserable savages, with a stunted breed of cattle whose flesh had\r\nacquired a rank and disagreeable taste through their habit of feeding\r\non sea-fish.\r\n\r\nAfter a terrible march of sixty days, the army passed through this\r\ndesert region, and reached Gedrosia, where the men at once received\r\nabundant supplies of food, which were furnished by the chiefs of the\r\nprovinces which they entered.\r\n\r\nLXVII. After he had refreshed his troops here for a little, Alexander\r\nled them in a joyous revel for seven days through Karmania.[426] He,\r\nhimself, feasted continually, night and day, with his companions, who\r\nsat at table with him upon a lofty stage drawn by eight horses, so\r\nthat all men could see them. After the king's equipage followed\r\nnumberless other waggons, some with hangings of purple and embroidered\r\nwork, and others with canopies of green boughs, which were constantly\r\nrenewed, containing the rest of Alexander's friends and officers, all\r\ncrowned with flowers and drinking wine. There was not a shield, a\r\nhelmet, or a pike, to be seen, but all along the road the soldiers\r\nwere dipping cups, and horns, and earthenware vessels into great jars\r\nof liquor and drinking one another's healths, some drinking as they\r\nmarched along, while others sat by the roadside. Everywhere might be\r\nheard the sound of flutes and pipes, and women singing and dancing;\r\nwhile with all this dissolute march the soldiers mingled rough jokes,\r\nas if the god Dionysus himself were amongst them and attended on their\r\nmerry procession. At the capital of Gedrosia, Alexander again halted\r\nhis army, and refreshed them with feasting and revelry. It is said\r\nthat he himself, after having drunk hard, was watching a contest\r\nbetween several choruses, and that his favourite Bagoas won the prize,\r\nand then came across the theatre and seated himself beside him,\r\ndressed as he was and wearing his crown as victor. The Macedonians,\r\nwhen they saw this, applauded vehemently, and cried out to Alexander\r\nto kiss him, until at length he threw his arms round him and kissed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nLXVIII. He was now much pleased at being joined by Nearchus and his\r\nofficers, and took so much interest in their accounts of their voyage,\r\nthat he wished to sail down the Euphrates himself with a great fleet,\r\nand then to coast round Arabia and Libya, and so enter the\r\nMediterranean sea through the pillars of Herakles.[427] He even began\r\nto build many ships at Thapsakus, and to collect sailors and pilots\r\nfrom all parts of the world, but the severe campaigns which he had\r\njust completed in India, the wound which he had received among the\r\nMalli, and the great losses which his army had sustained in crossing\r\nthe desert, had made many of his subjects doubt whether he was ever\r\nlikely to return alive, and had encouraged them to revolt, while his\r\nabsence had led many of his satraps and viceroys to act in an\r\nextremely arbitrary and despotic manner, so that his whole empire was\r\nin a most critical condition, and full of conspiracies and seditious\r\nrisings. Olympias and Kleopatra[428] had attacked and driven out\r\nAntipater, and had divided the kingdom between themselves, Olympias\r\ntaking Epirus, and Kleopatra Macedonia. When Alexander heard this, he\r\nsaid that his mother had proved herself the wiser of the two; for the\r\nMacedonians never would endure to be ruled by a woman. He now sent\r\nNearchus back to the sea, determining to make war all along the coast,\r\nand coming down in person to punish the most guilty of his officers.\r\nHe killed Oxyartes, one of the sons of Abouletes (the satrap of\r\nSusiana) with his own hands, with a sarissa or Macedonian pike.\r\nAbouletes had made no preparations to receive Alexander, but offered\r\nhim three thousand talents of silver. Alexander ordered the money to\r\nbe thrown down for the horses; and as they could not eat it, he said\r\n\"What is the use of your having prepared this for me?\" and ordered\r\nAbouletes to be cast into prison.\r\n\r\nLXIX. While Alexander was in Persis[429] he first renewed the old\r\ncustom that whenever the king came there he should give every woman a\r\ngold piece. On account of this custom we are told that many of the\r\nPersian kings came but seldom to Persis, and that Ochus never came at\r\nall, but exiled himself from his native country through his\r\nniggardliness. Shortly afterwards Alexander discovered that the\r\nsepulchre of Cyrus had been broken into, and put the criminal to\r\ndeath, although he was a citizen of Pella[430] of some distinction,\r\nnamed Polemarchus. When he had read the inscription upon the tomb, he\r\nordered it to be cut in Greek letters also. The inscription ran as\r\nfollows: \"O man, whosoever thou art, and whencesoever thou comest--for\r\nI know that thou shalt come--I am Cyrus, who won the empire for the\r\nPersians. I pray thee, do not grudge me this little earth that\r\ncovereth my body.\" These words made a deep impression upon Alexander,\r\nand caused him to meditate upon the uncertainty and changefulness of\r\nhuman affairs. About this time, Kalanus, who had for some days been\r\nsuffering from some internal disorder, begged that a funeral pile\r\nmight be erected for him. He rode up to it on horseback, said a\r\nprayer, poured a libation for himself and cut off a lock of his own\r\nhair, as is usual at a sacrifice, and then, mounting the pile, shook\r\nhands with those Macedonians who were present, bidding them be of good\r\ncheer that day, and drink deep at the king's table. He added, that he\r\nhimself should shortly see the king at Babylon. Having spoken thus he\r\nlay down and covered himself over. He did not move when the fire\r\nreached him, but remained in the same posture until he was consumed,\r\nthus sacrificing himself to the gods after the manner of the Indian\r\nphilosophers. Many years afterwards another Indian, a friend of Cæsar,\r\ndid the like in the city of Athens; and at the present day his\r\nsepulchre is shown under the name of \"the Indian's tomb.\"\r\n\r\nLXX. After Alexander left the funeral pyre, he invited many of his\r\nfriends and chief officers to dinner, and offered a prize to the man\r\nwho could drink most unmixed wine. Promachus, who won it, drank as\r\nmuch as four choes.[431] He was presented with a golden crown worth a\r\ntalent, and lived only three days afterwards. Of the others, Chares,\r\nthe historian, tells us that forty-one died of an extreme cold that\r\ncame upon them in their drunkenness.\r\n\r\nAlexander now celebrated the marriage of many of his companions at\r\nSusa. He himself married Statira, the daughter of Darius, and bestowed\r\nthe noblest of the Persian ladies upon the bravest of his men. He gave\r\na splendid banquet on the occasion of his marriage, inviting to it not\r\nonly all the newly married couples, but all those Macedonians who were\r\nalready married to Persian wives. It is said that nine thousand guests\r\nwere present at this feast, and that each of them was presented with a\r\ngolden cup to drink his wine in. Alexander entertained them in all\r\nother respects with the greatest magnificence, and even paid all the\r\ndebts of his guests, so that the whole expense amounted to nine\r\nthousand eight hundred and seventy talents. On this occasion,\r\nAntigenes the one-eyed got his name inscribed on the roll as a debtor,\r\nand produced a man who said that he was his creditor. He received the\r\namount of his alleged debt, but his deceit was afterwards discovered\r\nby Alexander, who was much enraged, banished him from his court, and\r\ntook away his command. This Antigenes was a very distinguished\r\nsoldier. When Philip, was besieging Perinthus, Antigenes, who was then\r\nvery young, was struck in the eye with a dart, and would not allow his\r\nfriends to pull it out, nor leave the fight, before he had driven back\r\nthe enemy into the city. He now was terribly cast down at his\r\ndisgrace, and made no secret of his intention of making away with\r\nhimself. The king, fearing that he would carry out his threat,\r\npardoned him, and permitted him to keep the money.\r\n\r\nLXXI. Alexander was much pleased with the appearance of the three\r\nthousand youths whom he had left to be trained in the Greek manner,\r\nwho had now grown into strong and handsome men, and showed great skill\r\nand activity in the performance of military exercises; but the\r\nMacedonians were very discontented, and feared that their king would\r\nnow have less need for them. When Alexander sent those of them who\r\nwere sick or maimed back to the sea coast, they said that it was\r\ndisgraceful treatment that he should send these poor men home to their\r\ncountry and their parents in disgrace, and in worse case than when\r\nthey set out, after he had had all the benefit of their services. They\r\nbade him send them all home, and regard them all as unserviceable,\r\nsince he had such a fine troop of young gallants at his disposal to go\r\nand conquer the world with. Alexander was much vexed at this. He\r\nsavagely reproached the soldiers, dismissed all his guards, and\r\nreplaced them with Persians, whom he appointed as his body-guards and\r\nchamberlains. When the Macedonians saw him attended by these men, and\r\nfound themselves shut out from his presence, they were greatly\r\nhumbled, and after discussing the matter together they became nearly\r\nmad with rage and jealousy. At last they agreed to go to his tent\r\nwithout their arms, dressed only in their tunics, and there with\r\nweeping and lamentation offered themselves to him and bade him deal\r\nwith them as with ungrateful and wicked men. Alexander, although he\r\nwas now inclined to leniency, refused to receive them, but they would\r\nnot go away, and remained for two days and nights at the door of his\r\ntent lamenting and calling him their sovereign. On the third day he\r\ncame out, and when he saw them in such a pitiable state of abasement,\r\nhe wept for some time. He then gently blamed them for their conduct,\r\nand spoke kindly to them. He gave splendid presents to all the\r\ninvalids, and dismissed them, writing at the same time to Antipater\r\nwith orders, that in every public spectacle these men should sit in\r\nthe best places in the theatre or the circus with garlands on their\r\nheads. The orphan children of those who had fallen he took into his\r\nown service.\r\n\r\nLXXII. After Alexander was come to the city of Ekbatana in Media, and\r\nhad despatched the most weighty part of his business there, he gave\r\nhimself up entirely to devising magnificent spectacles and\r\nentertainments, with the aid of three thousand workmen, whom he had\r\nsent for from Greece. During this time, Hephæstion fell sick of a\r\nfever, and being a young man, and accustomed to a soldier's life, did\r\nnot put himself upon a strict diet and remain quiet as he ought to\r\nhave done. As soon as Glaukus, his physician, left him to go to the\r\ntheatre, he ate a boiled fowl for his breakfast, and drank a large jar\r\nof cooled wine. Upon this he was immediately taken worse, and very\r\nshortly afterwards died.\r\n\r\nAlexander's grief for him exceeded all reasonable measure. He ordered\r\nthe manes of all the horses and mules to be cut off in sign of\r\nmourning, he struck off the battlements of all the neighbouring\r\ncities, crucified the unhappy physician, and would not permit the\r\nflute or any other musical instrument to be played throughout his\r\ncamp, until a response came from the oracle of Ammon bidding him\r\nhonour Hephæstion and offer sacrifice to him as to a hero.[432] To\r\nassuage his grief he took to war, and found consolation in fighting\r\nand man-hunting. He conquered the tribe called Kossæi, and slew their\r\nentire male population, which passed for an acceptable offering to the\r\nmanes of Hephæstion. He now determined to spend ten thousand\r\ntalents[433] on the funeral and tomb of Hephæstion; and as he wished\r\nto exceed the cost by the ingenuity and brilliancy of invention shown\r\nin this spectacle, he chose Stasikrates out of all his mechanicians to\r\narrange it, as he was thought to be able both to devise with grandeur\r\nand to execute with skill.\r\n\r\nHe on one occasion before this, when conversing with Alexander, told\r\nhim that of all mountains in the world Mount Athos in Thrace was that\r\nwhich could most easily be carved into the figure of a man; and that,\r\nif Alexander would give him the order, he would form Athos into the\r\nmost magnificent and durable monument of him that the world had ever\r\nseen, as he would represent him as holding in his left hand the city\r\nof Myriandrus, and with his right pouring, as a libation, a copious\r\nriver into the sea. Alexander would not, indeed, adopt this\r\nsuggestion, but was fond of discussing much more wonderful and costly\r\ndesigns than this with his engineers.\r\n\r\nLXXIII. Just as Alexander was on the point of starting for Babylon,\r\nNearchus, who had returned with his fleet up the Euphrates, met him,\r\nand informed him that some Chaldæans had warned Alexander to avoid\r\nBabylon. He took no heed of this warning, but went his way. When he\r\ndrew near the walls he saw many crows flying about and pecking at one\r\nanother, some of whom fell to the ground close beside him. After this,\r\nas he heard that Apollodorus, the governor of Babylon, had sacrificed\r\nto the gods to know what would happen to Alexander, he sent for\r\nPythagoras, the soothsayer, who had conducted the sacrifice, to know\r\nif this were true. The soothsayer admitted that it was, on which\r\nAlexander inquired what signs he had observed in the sacrifice.\r\nPythagoras answered that the victim's liver wanted one lobe. \"Indeed!\"\r\nexclaimed Alexander, \"that is a terrible omen.\" He did Pythagoras no\r\nhurt, but regretted that he had not listened to the warning of\r\nNearchus, and spent most of his time in his camp outside the walls of\r\nBabylon, or in boats on the river Euphrates. Many unfavourable omens\r\nnow depressed his spirit. A tame ass attacked and kicked to death the\r\nfinest and largest lion that he kept; and one day, as he stripped to\r\nplay at tennis, the young man with whom he played, when it was time to\r\ndress again, saw a man sitting on the king's throne, wearing his\r\ndiadem and royal robe. For a long time this man refused to speak, but\r\nat length said that he was a citizen of Messene, named Dionysius, who\r\nhad been brought to Babylon and imprisoned on some charge or other,\r\nand that now the god Serapis had appeared to him, loosed his chains,\r\nand had brought him thither, where he had bidden him to put on the\r\nking's diadem and robe, seat himself on his throne, and remain silent.\r\n\r\nLXXIV. When Alexander heard this, he caused the man to be put to\r\ndeath, according to the advice of his soothsayers; but he himself was\r\nmuch cast down, and feared that the gods had forsaken him: he also\r\ngrew suspicious of his friends. Above all he feared Antipater and his\r\nsons, one of whom, Iolas, was his chief cup-bearer, while the other,\r\nKassander, had but recently arrived from Greece, and as he had been\r\ntrained in the Greek fashion, and had never seen any Oriental customs\r\nbefore, he burst into a loud, insolent laugh, when he saw some of the\r\nnatives doing homage to Alexander. Alexander was very angry, and\r\nseizing him by the hair with both hands, beat his head against the\r\nwall. Another time he stopped Kassander, when he was about to say\r\nsomething to some men who were accusing his father, Antipater. \"Do you\r\nimagine\" said he, \"that these men would have journeyed so far merely\r\nin order to accuse a man falsely, if they had not been wronged by\r\nhim?\" When Kassander answered, that it looked very like a false\r\naccusation for a man to journey far from the place where his proofs\r\nlay, Alexander said with a laugh, \"This is how Aristotle teaches his\r\ndisciples to argue on either side of the question; but if any of you\r\nbe proved to have wronged these men ever so little, you shall smart\r\nfor it.\" It is related that after this, terror of Alexander became so\r\nrooted in the mind of Kassander, that many years afterwards, when\r\nKassander was king of Macedonia, and lord of all Greece, he was\r\nwalking about in Delphi looking at the statues, and that when he saw\r\nthat of Alexander he was seized with a violent shuddering; his hair\r\nstood upright on his head, and his body quaked with fear, so that it\r\nwas long before he regained his composure.\r\n\r\nLXXV. After Alexander had once lost his confidence and become\r\nsuspicious and easily alarmed, there was no circumstance so trivial\r\nthat he did not make an omen of it, and the palace was full of\r\nsacrifices, lustrations, and soothsayers. So terrible a thing is\r\ndisbelief in the gods and contempt for them on the one hand, while\r\nsuperstition and excessive reverence for them presses on men's guilty\r\nconsciences like a torrent of water[434] poured upon them. Thus was\r\nAlexander's mind filled with base and cowardly alarms. However when\r\nthe oracular responses of the gods about Hephæstion were reported to\r\nhim, he laid aside his grief somewhat, and again indulged in feasts\r\nand drinking bouts. He entertained Nearchus and his friends\r\nmagnificently, after which he took a bath, and then, just as he was\r\ngoing to sleep, Medius invited him to a revel at his house. He drank\r\nthere the whole of the following day, when he began to feel feverish:\r\nthough he did not drink up the cup of Herakles at a draught, or\r\nsuddenly feel a pain as of a spear piercing his body, as some\r\nhistorians have thought it necessary to write, in order to give a\r\ndramatic fitness and dignity to the end of so important a personage.\r\nAristobulus tells us that he became delirious through fever, and drank\r\nwine to quench his thirst, after which he became raving mad, and died\r\non the thirtieth day of the month Daisius.\r\n\r\nLXXVI. In his own diary his last illness is described thus: \"On the\r\neighteenth day of Daisius he slept in the bath-room, because he was\r\nfeverish. On the following day after bathing he came into his chamber\r\nand spent the day playing at dice with Medius. After this he bathed\r\nlate in the evening, offered sacrifice to the gods, dined, and\r\nsuffered from fever during the night. On the twentieth he bathed and\r\nsacrificed as usual, and while reclining in his bath-room he conversed\r\nwith Nearchus and his friends, listening to their account of their\r\nvoyage, and of the Great Ocean. On the twenty-first he did the same,\r\nbut his fever grew much worse, so that he suffered much during the\r\nnight, and next day was very ill. On rising from his bed he lay beside\r\nthe great plunge-bath, and conversed with his generals about certain\r\nposts which were vacant in his army, bidding them choose suitable\r\npersons to fill them. On the twenty-fourth, although very ill, he rose\r\nand offered sacrifice; and he ordered his chief officers to remain\r\nnear him, and the commanders of brigades and regiments to pass the\r\nnight at his gate. On the twenty-fifth he was carried over the river\r\nto the other palace, and slept a little, but the fever did not leave\r\nhim. When his generals came to see him he was speechless, and remained\r\nso during the twenty-fifth, so that the Macedonians thought that he\r\nwas dead. They clamoured at his palace gates, and threatened the\r\nattendants until they forced their way in. When the gates were thrown\r\nopen they all filed past his bed one by one, dressed only in their\r\ntunics. On this day Python and Seleukus, who had been to the temple of\r\nSerapis, enquired whether they should bring Alexander thither. The god\r\nanswered that they must leave him alone. The eight and twentieth day\r\nof the month, towards evening, Alexander died.\"\r\n\r\nLXXVII. Most of the above is copied, word for word, from Alexander's\r\nhousehold diary. No one had any suspicion of poison at the time; but\r\nit is said that six years after there appeared clear proof that he was\r\npoisoned, and that Olympias put many men to death, and caused the\r\nashes of Iolas, who had died in the mean time, to be cast to the\r\nwinds, as though he had administered the poison to Alexander.\r\n\r\nSome writers say that Antipater was advised by Aristotle to poison\r\nAlexander, and inform us that one Hagnothemis declared that he had\r\nbeen told as much by Antipater; and that the poison was as cold as\r\nice, and was gathered like dew, from a certain rock near the city of\r\nNonakris, and preserved in the hoof of an ass: for no other vessel\r\ncould contain it, because it is so exceedingly cold and piercing. Most\r\nhistorians, however, think that the whole story of Alexander's being\r\npoisoned was a fiction; and this view is strongly supported by the\r\nfact, that as Alexander's generals began to fight one another\r\nimmediately after his death, his body lay for many days unheeded, in\r\nhot and close rooms, and yet showed no signs of decay, but remained\r\nsweet and fresh. Roxana, who was pregnant, was regarded with great\r\nrespect by the Macedonians, and being jealous of Statira, she sent her\r\na forged letter, purporting to come from Alexander and asking her to\r\ncome to him. When Statira came, Roxana killed both her and her sister,\r\ncast their bodies down a well, and filled up the well with earth. Her\r\naccomplice in this crime was Perdikkas, who on the death of Alexander\r\nat once became a very powerful man. He sheltered his authority under\r\nthe name of Arrhidæus, who became the nominal, while Perdikkas was the\r\nvirtual king of Macedonia. This Arrhidæus was the son of Philip by a\r\nlow and disreputable woman named Philinna, and was half-witted in\r\nconsequence of some bodily disorder with which he was afflicted. This\r\ndisease was not congenital nor produced by natural causes, for he had\r\nbeen a fine boy and showed considerable ability, but Olympias\r\nendeavoured to poison him, and destroyed his intellect by her drugs.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 394: On the subject of serpent worship, see in Smith's\r\n'Dictionary of the Bible,' art.: 'Serpent,' and 'Brazen Serpent.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 395: The Greek month Hekatombæon answers to the last half of\r\nour July and the first half of August.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 396: Cf.

CÆSAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.[435] When Sulla got possession of the supreme power, he confiscated\r\nthe marriage portion of Cornelia[436] the daughter of Cinna[437] who\r\nhad once enjoyed the supremacy in Rome, because he could not either by\r\npromises or threats induce Cæsar to part with her. The cause of the\r\nenmity between Cæsar and Sulla was Cæsar's relationship to Marius; for\r\nthe elder Marius was the husband of Julia the sister of Cæsar's\r\nfather, and Julia was the mother of the younger Marius, who was\r\nconsequently Cæsar's cousin. Cæsar was not content with being let\r\nalone by Sulla, who was at first fully occupied with the\r\nproscriptions and other matters, but he presented himself to the\r\npeople as a candidate for a priesthood,[438] though he had hardly\r\narrived at man's estate. But Sulla by his opposition contrived to\r\nexclude him from this office, and even thought of putting him to\r\ndeath; and when some observed that there was no reason in putting to\r\ndeath such a youth, Sulla observed, that they had no sense if they did\r\nnot see many Marii in this boy. These words were conveyed to Cæsar,\r\nwho thereupon concealed himself by wandering about for some time in\r\nthe Sabine country. On one occasion when he was changing his place of\r\nabode on account of sickness, he fell in by night with the soldiers of\r\nSulla who were scouring those parts and seizing on those who were\r\nconcealed. But Cæsar got away by giving Cornelius,[439] who was in\r\ncommand of the soldiers, two talents, and going straightway down to\r\nthe coast he took ship and sailed to Bithynia to King Nicomedes,[440]\r\nwith whom he stayed no long time. On his voyage from Bithynia, he was\r\ncaptured near the island Pharmacusa[441] by pirates,[442] who at that\r\ntime were in possession of the seas with a powerful force and numerous\r\nships.\r\n\r\nII. The pirates asked Cæsar twenty talents for his ransom, on which he\r\nlaughed at them for not knowing who their prize was, and he promised\r\nto give them fifty talents. While he dispatched those about him to\r\nvarious cities to raise the money, he was left with one friend and\r\ntwo attendants among these Cilician pirates, who were notorious for\r\ntheir cruelty, yet he treated them with such contempt that whenever he\r\nwas lying down to rest, he would send to them and order them to be\r\nquiet. He spent eight and thirty days among them, not so much like a\r\nprisoner as a prince surrounded by his guards, and he joined in their\r\nsports and exercises with perfect unconcern. He also wrote poems and\r\nsome speeches which he read to them, and those who did not approve of\r\nhis compositions he would call to their faces illiterate fellows and\r\nbarbarians, and he would often tell them with a laugh that he would\r\nhang them all. The pirates were pleased with his manners, and\r\nattributed this freedom of speech to simplicity and a mirthful\r\ndisposition. As soon as the ransom came from Miletus and Cæsar had\r\npaid it and was set at liberty, he manned some vessels in the port of\r\nMiletus and went after the pirates, whom he found still on the island,\r\nand he secured most of them. All their property he made his booty; but\r\nthe pirates, he lodged in prison at Pergamum, and then went to\r\nJunius,[443] who, as governor of the provinces of Asia, was the proper\r\nperson to punish the captives. But as the governor was casting a\r\nlonging eye on the booty, which was valuable, and said he would take\r\ntime to consider about the captives, Cæsar without more ado, left him\r\nand going straight to Pergamum took all the pirates out of prison and\r\ncrucified them, as he had often told them he would do in the island\r\nwhen they thought he was merely jesting.\r\n\r\nIII. Sulla's power was now declining, and Cæsar's friends in Rome\r\nrecommended him to return. However, he first made a voyage to Rhodus\r\nin order to have the instruction of Apollonius the son of Molon,[444]\r\nof whom Cicero also was a hearer. This Apollonius was a distinguished\r\nrhetorician, and had the reputation of being a man of a good\r\ndisposition. Cæsar is said to have had a great talent for the\r\ncomposition of discourses on political matters, and to have cultivated\r\nit most diligently, so as to obtain beyond dispute the second rank;\r\nhis ambition to be first in power and arms, made him from want of\r\nleisure give up the first rank, to which his natural talents invited\r\nhim, and consequently his attention to military matters and political\r\naffairs by which he got the supreme power, did not allow him to attain\r\nperfection in oratory. Accordingly at a later period, in his reply to\r\nCicero about Cato,[445] he deprecates all comparison between the\r\ncomposition of a soldier and the eloquence of an accomplished orator\r\nwho had plenty of leisure to prosecute his studies.\r\n\r\nIV. On his return to Rome he impeached[446] Dolabella[447] for\r\nmaladministration in his province, and many of the cities of Greece\r\ngave evidence in support of the charge. Dolabella, indeed, was\r\nacquitted; but to make some return to the Greeks for their zeal in his\r\nbehalf, Cæsar assisted them in their prosecution of Publius\r\nAntonius[448] for corruption before Marcus Lucullus, the governor of\r\nMacedonia; and his aid was so effectual that Antonius appealed to the\r\ntribunes, alleging that he had not a fair trial in Greece with the\r\nGreeks for his accusers. At Rome Cæsar got a brilliant popularity by\r\naiding at trials with his eloquence; and he gained also much good will\r\nby his agreeable mode of saluting people and his pleasant manners, for\r\nhe was more attentive to please than persons usually are at that age.\r\nHe was also gradually acquiring political influence by the splendour\r\nof his entertainments and his table and of his general mode of living.\r\nAt first those who envied him, thinking that when his resources\r\nfailed his influence would soon go, did not concern themselves about\r\nhis flourishing popularity: but at last when his political power had\r\nacquired strength and had become difficult to overthrow and was\r\nmanifestly tending to bring about a complete revolution, they\r\nperceived that no beginnings should be considered too small to be\r\ncapable of quickly becoming great by uninterrupted endurance and\r\nhaving no obstacle to their growth by reason of being despised.\r\nCicero, who is considered to have been the first to suspect and to\r\nfear the smiling surface[449] of Cæsar's policy, as a man would the\r\nsmiling smoothness of a sea, and who observed the bold and determined\r\ncharacter which was concealed under a friendly and joyous exterior,\r\nsaid that in all his designs and public measures he perceived a\r\ntyrannical purpose; \"but on the other hand,\" said he, \"when I look at\r\nhis hair, which is arranged with so much care, and see him scratching\r\nhis head with one finger,[450] I cannot think that such a wicked\r\npurpose will ever enter into this man's mind as the overthrow of the\r\nRoman State.\" This, however, belongs to a later period.\r\n\r\nV. He received the first proof of the good will of the people towards\r\nhim when he was a competitor against Caius Popilius for a military\r\ntribuneship,[451] and was proclaimed before him. He received a second\r\nand more conspicuous evidence of popular favour on the occasion of the\r\ndeath of Julia[452] the wife of Marius, when Cæsar, who was her\r\nnephew, pronounced over her a splendid funeral oration in the Forum,\r\nand at the funeral ventured to exhibit the images[453] of Marius,\r\nwhich were then seen for the first time since the administration of\r\nSulla, for Marius and his son had been adjudged enemies. Some voices\r\nwere raised against Cæsar on account of this display, but the people\r\nresponded by loud shouts, and received him with clapping of hands, and\r\nadmiration, that he was bringing back as from the regions of Hades,\r\nafter so long an interval, the glories of Marius to the city. Now it\r\nwas an ancient Roman usage to pronounce funeral orations[454] over\r\nelderly women, but it was not customary to do it in the case of young\r\nwomen, and Cæsar set the first example by pronouncing a funeral\r\noration over his deceased wife, which brought him some popularity and\r\nwon the many by sympathy to consider him a man of a kind disposition\r\nand full of feeling. After the funeral of his wife he went to Iberia\r\nas quæstor to the Prætor Vetus,[455] for whom he always showed great\r\nrespect, and whose son he made his own quæstor when he filled the\r\noffice of Prætor. After his quæstorship he married for his third wife\r\nPompeia[456] he had by his wife Cornelia a daughter, who afterwards\r\nmarried Pompeius Magnus. Owing to his profuse expenditure (and indeed\r\nmen generally supposed that he was buying at a great cost a\r\nshort-lived popularity, though in fact he was purchasing things of the\r\nhighest value at a low price) it is said that before he attained any\r\npublic office he was in debt to the amount of thirteen hundred\r\ntalents. Upon being appointed curator of the Appian Road,[457] he laid\r\nout upon it a large sum of his own; and during his ædileship[458] he\r\nexhibited three hundred and twenty pair of gladiators, and by his\r\nliberality and expenditure on the theatrical exhibitions, the\r\nprocessions, and the public entertainments, he completely drowned all\r\nprevious displays, and put the people in such a humour, that every man\r\nwas seeking for new offices and new honours to requite him with.\r\n\r\nVI. There were at this time two parties in the State, that of Sulla,\r\nwhich was all-powerful, and that of Marius, which was cowed and\r\ndivided and very feeble. It was Cæsar's object to strengthen and gain\r\nover the party of Marius, and accordingly, when the ambitious\r\nsplendour of his ædileship was at its height, he had images of Marius\r\nsecretly made, and triumphal Victories, which he took by night and set\r\nup on the Capitol. At daybreak the people seeing the images glittering\r\nwith gold, and exquisitely laboured by art (and there were\r\ninscriptions also which declared the Cimbrian victories of Marius),\r\nwere in admiration at the boldness of him who had placed them there,\r\nfor it was no secret who it was, and the report quickly circulating\r\nthrough the city, brought everybody to the spot to see. Some exclaimed\r\nthat Cæsar had a design to make himself tyrant, which appeared by his\r\nreviving those testimonials of honour which had been buried in the\r\nearth by laws and decrees of the senate, and that it was done to try\r\nif the people, who were already tampered with, were tamed to his\r\npurpose by his splendid exhibitions, and would allow him to venture on\r\nsuch tricks and innovations. But the partisans of Marius, encouraging\r\none another, soon collected in surprising numbers, and filled the\r\nCapitol with their noise. Many also shed tears of joy at seeing the\r\nlikeness of Marius, and Cæsar was highly extolled as the only man\r\nworthy to be a kinsman of Marius. The senate being assembled about\r\nthese matters, Catulus Lutatius, who had at that time the greatest\r\nname of any man in Rome, got up, and charging Cæsar, uttered that\r\nmemorable expression: \"Cæsar, no longer are you taking the state by\r\nunderground approaches, but by storming engines.\" Cæsar spoke in reply\r\nto this charge, and satisfied the senate, on which his admirers were\r\nstill more elated, and urged him not to abate of his pretensions for\r\nany one: with the favour of the people, they said, he would soon get\r\nthe better of all, and be the first man in the State.\r\n\r\nVII. About this time Metellus,[459] the Pontifex Maximus, died, and\r\nthough Isauricus and Catulus were candidates for the priesthood, which\r\nwas a great object of ambition, and were men of the highest rank and\r\ngreatest influence in the senate, Cæsar would not give way to them,\r\nbut he presented himself to the people as a competitor. The favour of\r\nthe people appearing equally divided, Catulus, as the more\r\ndistinguished candidate, being more afraid of the uncertainty of the\r\nevent, sent and offered Cæsar a large sum of money if he would retire\r\nfrom his canvass; but Cæsar replied that he would stand it out even if\r\nhe had to borrow still more. On the day of the election, his mother,\r\nwith tears, accompanied him to the door, when Cæsar embracing her,\r\nsaid, \"Mother, to-day you shall see your son either Pontifex Maximus,\r\nor an exile.\" After the voting was over, which was conducted with\r\ngreat spirit, Cæsar prevailed, a circumstance which alarmed the senate\r\nand the nobles, who feared that he would lead on the people to the\r\nboldest measures. Accordingly, Piso and Catulus blamed Cicero for\r\nhaving spared Cæsar, who, in the matter of Catiline's[460] conspiracy,\r\nhad given him a handle. Now Catiline designed not only to alter the\r\nform of government, but to subvert the whole Commonwealth, and throw\r\nall into confusion, but he was ejected from the city on being\r\nconvicted of some minor charges, and before the extent of his designs\r\nwas discovered. He left behind him in the city Lentulus and Cethegus,\r\nto carry his plans into execution. It is uncertain if Cæsar secretly\r\nlent them any countenance and aid, but when they were completely\r\nconvicted in the senate, and Cicero the consul put it to each senator\r\nto give his opinion on their punishment, all who spoke declared for\r\ndeath till it came to Cæsar's turn to speak. Cæsar rose and delivered\r\na studied oration, to the effect that it was not consistent with the\r\nconstitution, nor was it just to put to death without a trial men\r\ndistinguished for their high character and their family, unless there\r\nwas the most urgent necessity; and he added that, if they were\r\nimprisoned in the Italian cities which Cicero himself might choose,\r\nuntil the war against Catiline was brought to an end, the senate might\r\nhave time to deliberate on the case of each prisoner when peace was\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nVIII. This proposal appeared so humane, and was supported by so\r\npowerful a speech, that not only those who rose after Cæsar sided\r\nwith, him, but many of those who had already spoken changed their\r\nopinions and went over to that of Cæsar, till it came to the turn of\r\nCato and Catulus to speak. After they had made a vigorous opposition,\r\nand Cato in his speech had also urged suspicious matter against Cæsar\r\nand strongly argued against him, the conspirators were handed over to\r\nthe executioner, and as Cæsar was leaving the Senate many of the young\r\nmen who then acted as a guard to Cicero, crowded together and\r\nthreatened Cæsar with their naked swords.[461] But Curio[462] is said\r\nto have thrown his toga round Cæsar, and to have carried him off; and\r\nCicero also, when the young men looked to him, is said to have checked\r\nthem by a motion, either through fear of the people or because he\r\nthought that the death of Cæsar would be most unjust and a violation\r\nof law. If this is true, I cannot conceive why Cicero said nothing\r\nabout it in the book on his Consulship;[463] but Cicero was blamed\r\nafterwards for not having taken advantage of so favourable an\r\nopportunity to get rid of Cæsar, and for having feared the people, who\r\nwere extravagantly attached to Cæsar. And indeed a few days after,\r\nwhen Cæsar had gone to the Senate and defended himself in a speech\r\nagainst the imputations that had been cast on him, and his speech was\r\nreceived with loud marks of disapprobation and the sitting of the\r\nSenate was lasting longer than usual, the people came with loud cries\r\nand surrounded the Senate-house calling for Cæsar and bidding the\r\nSenate let him go. Accordingly, Cato apprehending danger mainly from\r\nsome movement of the needy part of the people, who were like a\r\nfirebrand among the rest of the citizens, as they had all their hopes\r\nin Cæsar, prevailed on the Senate to give them a monthly allowance of\r\ncorn, which produced an addition to the rest of the expenditure of\r\nseven millions[464] five hundred thousands. However, the immediate\r\nalarm was manifestly quenched by this measure, which snapped off the\r\nbest part of Cæsar's influence and scattered it, at a time when he was\r\ngoing to enter on his office of Prætor which made him more\r\nformidable.\r\n\r\nIX. No tumults occurred in Cæsar's Prætorship,[465] but a disagreeable\r\nincident happened in his family. Publius Clodius,[466] a man of\r\nPatrician rank, was distinguished both by wealth and eloquence, but in\r\narrogance and impudence he was not inferior to the most notorious\r\nscoundrels in Rome. Clodius was in love with Pompeia, Cæsar's wife,\r\nand Pompeia was in no way averse to him. But a strict watch was kept\r\nover the woman's apartment, and Aurelia, Cæsar's mother, who was a\r\nprudent woman, by always observing Pompeia, made it difficult and\r\nhazardous for the lovers to have an interview. Now the Romans have a\r\ngoddess whom they call Bona, as the Greeks have a Gynæceia. The\r\nPhrygians, who claim this goddess, say she was the mother of King\r\nMidas; the Romans say she was a Dryad and the wife of Faunus; but the\r\nGreeks say she is one of the mothers of Dionysus, whose name must not\r\nbe uttered; and this is the reason why they cover the tents with\r\nvine-leaves during the celebration of her festival, and a sacred\r\nserpent sits by the goddess according to the mythus. No man is allowed\r\nto approach the festival, nor to be in the house during the\r\ncelebration of the rites; but the women by themselves are said to\r\nperform many rites similar to the Orphic in the celebration.\r\nAccordingly when the season of the festival is come, the husband, if\r\nhe be consul or prætor, leaves the house and every male also quits it;\r\nand the wife taking possession of the house makes all arrangements,\r\nand the chief ceremonies are celebrated by night, the evening festival\r\nbeing accompanied with mirth and much music.\r\n\r\nX. While Pompeia[467] was now celebrating this festival, Clodius, who\r\nwas not yet bearded, and for this reason thought that he should not be\r\ndiscovered, assumed the dress and equipment of a female lute-player\r\nand went to the house looking just like a young woman. Finding the\r\ndoor open, he was safely let in by a female slave who was in the\r\nsecret, and who forthwith ran off to tell Pompeia. As there was some\r\ndelay and Clodius was too impatient to wait where the woman had left\r\nhim, but was rambling about the house, which was large, and trying to\r\navoid the lights, Aurelia's waiting-woman, as was natural for one\r\nwoman with another, challenged him to a little mirthful sport, and as\r\nhe declined the invitations, she pulled him forward and asked who he\r\nwas and where he came from. Clodius replied that he was waiting for\r\nAbra the maid of Pompeia, for that was the woman's name, but his voice\r\nbetrayed him, and the waiting-woman ran with a loud cry to the lights\r\nand the rest of the company, calling out that she had discovered a\r\nman. All the women were in the greatest alarm, and Aurelia stopped the\r\ncelebration of the rites and covered up the sacred things: she also\r\nordered the doors to be closed and went about the house with the\r\nlights to look for Clodius. He was discovered lurking in the chamber\r\nof the girl who had let him in, and on being recognised by the women\r\nwas turned out of doors. The women went straightway, though it was\r\nnight, to their husbands to tell them what had happened; and as soon\r\nas it was day, the talk went through Rome of the desecration of the\r\nsacred rites by Clodius, and how he ought to be punished for his\r\nbehaviour, not only to the persons whom he had insulted, but to the\r\ncity and the gods. Accordingly one of the tribunes instituted a\r\nprosecution against Clodius for an offence against religion, and the\r\nmost powerful of the senators combined against him, charging him,\r\namong other abominations, with adultery with his sister, who was the\r\nwife of Lucullus. The people set themselves in opposition to their\r\nexertions and supported Clodius, and were of great service to him\r\nwith the judices, who were terror-struck and afraid of the people.\r\nCæsar immediately divorced Pompeia, and when he was summoned as a\r\nwitness on the trial, he said he knew nothing about the matters that\r\nClodius was charged with. This answer appearing strange, the accuser\r\nasked him, \"Why have you put away your wife?\" to which Cæsar replied,\r\n\"Because I considered that my wife ought not even to be suspected.\"\r\nSome say that this was the real expression of Cæsar's opinion, but\r\nothers affirm that it was done to please the people who were bent on\r\nsaving Clodius. However this may be, Clodius was acquitted, for the\r\nmajority of the judices gave in their votes[468] written confusedly,\r\nthat they might run no risk from the populace by convicting Clodius\r\nnor lose the good opinion of the better sort by acquitting him.\r\n\r\nXI. On the expiration of his Prætorship, Cæsar received Iberia[469]\r\nfor his province, but as he had a difficulty about arranging matters\r\nwith his creditors, who put obstructions in the way of his leaving\r\nRome, and were clamorous, he applied to Crassus, then the richest man\r\nin Rome, who stood in need of the vigour and impetuosity of Cæsar to\r\nsupport him in his political hostility to Pompeius. Crassus undertook\r\nto satisfy the most importunate and unrelenting of the creditors, and\r\nhaving become security for Cæsar to the amount of eight hundred and\r\nthirty talents, thus enabled him to set out for his province. There is\r\na story that as Cæsar was crossing the Alps, he passed by a small\r\nbarbarian town which had very few inhabitants and was a miserable\r\nplace, on which his companions jocosely observed, \"They did not\r\nsuppose there were any contests for honors in such a place as that,\r\nand struggles for the first rank and mutual jealousy of the chief\r\npersons:\" on which Cæsar earnestly remarked, \"I would rather be the\r\nfirst man here than the second at Rome.\" Again in Spain, when he had\r\nsome leisure and was reading the history of Alexander,[470] he was for\r\na long time in deep thought, and at last burst into tears; and on his\r\nfriends asking the reason of this, he said, \"Don't you think it is a\r\nmatter for sorrow, that Alexander was king of so many nations at such\r\nan early age, and I have as yet done nothing of note?\"\r\n\r\nXII. However, as soon as he entered Iberia, he commenced active\r\noperations and in a few days raised ten cohorts in addition to the\r\ntwenty which were already there, and with this force marching against\r\nthe Calaici[471] and Lusitani he defeated them, and advanced to the\r\nshores of the external sea, subduing the nations which hitherto had\r\npaid no obedience to Rome. After his military success, he was equally\r\nfortunate in settling the civil administration by establishing\r\nfriendly relations among the different states, and particularly by\r\nhealing the differences between debtors and creditors;[472] for which\r\npurpose he determined that the creditor should annually take\r\ntwo-thirds of the debtor's income, and that the owner should take the\r\nother third, which arrangement was to continue till the debt was paid.\r\nBy these measures he gained a good reputation, and he retired from the\r\nprovince with the acquisition of a large fortune, having enriched his\r\nsoldiers also by his campaigns and been saluted by them Imperator.\r\n\r\nXIII. As it was the law at Rome that those who were soliciting a\r\ntriumph should stay outside the city, and that those who were\r\ncandidates for the consulship should be present in the city, Cæsar\r\nfinding himself in this difficulty, and having reached Rome just at\r\nthe time of the consular elections, sent to the senate to request\r\npermission to offer himself to the consulship in his absence through\r\nthe intervention of his friends. Cato at first urged the law in\r\nopposition to Cæsar's request, but seeing that many of the senators\r\nhad been gained over by Cæsar, he attempted to elude the question by\r\ntaking advantage of time and wasting the day in talking, till at last\r\nCæsar determined to give up the triumph and to secure the consulship.\r\nAs soon as he entered the city, he adopted a policy which deceived\r\neverybody except Cato; and this was the bringing about of a\r\nreconciliation between Pompeius and Crassus, the two most powerful men\r\nin Rone, whom Cæsar reconciled from their differences, and centering\r\nin himself the united strength of the two by an act that had a\r\nfriendly appearance, changed the form of government without its being\r\nobserved. For it was not, as most people suppose, the enmity of Cæsar\r\nand Pompeius which produced the civil wars, but their friendship\r\nrather, inasmuch as they first combined to depress the nobility and\r\nthen quarrelled with one another. Cato, who often predicted what would\r\nhappen, at the time only got by it the character of being a morose,\r\nmeddling fellow, though afterwards he was considered to be a wise, but\r\nnot a fortunate adviser.\r\n\r\nXIV. Cæsar,[473] however, supported on both sides by the friendship of\r\nCrassus and Pompeius, was raised to the consulship and proclaimed\r\ntriumphantly with Calpurnius Bibulus for his colleague. Immediately\r\nupon entering on his office he proposed enactments more suitable to\r\nthe most turbulent tribune than a consul, for in order to please the\r\npopulace he introduced measures for certain allotments and divisions\r\nof land.[474] But he met with opposition in the Senate from the good\r\nand honourable among them, and as he had long been looking for a\r\npretext, he exclaimed with solemn adjurations, that he was driven\r\nagainst his will to court the favour of the people by the arrogance\r\nand obstinacy of the Senate, and accordingly he hurried to the popular\r\nassembly and placing Crassus on one side of him and Pompeius on the\r\nother, he asked them if they approved of his legislative measures.\r\nUpon their expressing their approbation, he entreated them to give him\r\ntheir aid against those who threatened to oppose him with their\r\nswords. Pompeius and Crassus promised their assistance, and Pompeius\r\nadded, that he would oppose swords with sword and shield. The nobility\r\nwere annoyed at hearing such mad, inconsiderate words drop from\r\nPompeius, which were unbecoming his own character and the respect that\r\nhe owed to the Senate; but the people were delighted. Cæsar, whose\r\nsecret design it was to secure the influence of Pompeius still more,\r\ngave him to wife his daughter Julia,[475] who was already betrothed to\r\nServilius Cæpio; and he promised Cæpio that he should have the\r\ndaughter of Pompeius, though she also was not disengaged, being\r\nbetrothed to Faustus, the son of Sulla. Shortly after Cæsar married\r\nCalpurnia, the daughter of Piso, and got Piso named consul for the\r\nnext year, though Cato in this matter also strongly protested and\r\nexclaimed that it was an intolerable thing for the chief power to be\r\nprostituted by marriage bargains and that they should help one another\r\nby means of women, to provinces and armies and political power.\r\nBibulus, Cæsar's colleague, found it useless to oppose Cæsar's\r\nmeasures, and he and Cato several times narrowly escaped with their\r\nlives in the Forum, whereupon Bibulus shut himself up at home for the\r\nremainder of his consulship. Immediately after his marriage Pompeius\r\nfilled the Forum with armed men, and supported the people in passing\r\nCæsar's laws and in giving him for five years Gaul on both sides of\r\nthe Alps with the addition of Illyricum and four legions. Upon Cato's\r\nventuring to speak against these measures, Cæsar ordered him to be\r\ncarried off to prison, thinking that he would appeal to the tribunes.\r\nBut Cato went off without speaking a word; and Cæsar observing that\r\nthe nobles were much annoyed at this, and the people also through\r\nrespect for Cato's virtue were following him in silence and with\r\ndowncast eyes, secretly asked one of the tribunes to release Cato.\r\nVery few of the senators used to accompany Cæsar to the Senate, but\r\nthe majority not liking his measures stayed away. Considius,[476] who\r\nwas a very old man, observed that the senators did not come because\r\nthey were afraid of the arms and the soldiers. \"Why don't you then\r\nstay at home for the same reason?\" replied Cæsar, to which Considius\r\nrejoined, \"My age makes me fearless, for the little of life that\r\nremains for me is not worth much thought.\" The most scandalous public\r\nmeasure in Cæsar's consulship was the election as tribune of that[477]\r\nClodius who had dishonoured Cæsar's wife and violated the mysterious\r\nnocturnal rites. But he was elected in order to ruin Cicero, and Cæsar\r\ndid not set out for his province till with the aid of Clodius he had\r\nput down Cicero by his cabals and driven him out of Italy.\r\n\r\nXV. Such is said to have been the course of Cæsar's life before his\r\nGallic campaigns.[478] But the period of his wars which he afterwards\r\nfought and his expedition by which he subdued Gaul, is just like a new\r\nbeginning in his career and the commencement of a new course of life\r\nand action, in which he showed himself as a soldier and a general\r\ninferior to none who have gained admiration as leaders and been the\r\ngreatest men: for whether we compare Cæsar's exploits with those of\r\nthe Fabii, Scipios, and Metelli, or with those of his contemporaries\r\nor immediate predecessors, Sulla and Marius and both the Luculli or\r\neven Pompeius himself, whose fame, high as the heavens, was blossoming\r\nat that time in every kind of military virtue, Cæsar will be found to\r\nsurpass them all--his superiority over one appearing in the\r\ndifficulties of the country in which he carried on his campaigns, over\r\nanother in the extent of country subdued, over a third in the number\r\nand courage of the enemy whom he defeated, over another again in the\r\nsavage manners and treacherous character of the nations that he\r\nbrought to civility, over a fourth in his clemency and mildness to the\r\nconquered, over another again in his donations and liberality to his\r\nsoldiers; and in fine his superiority over all other generals appears\r\nby the numbers of battles that he fought and of enemies that he slew.\r\nFor in somewhat less than ten years during which he carried on his\r\ncampaign in Gaul he took by storm above eight hundred cities, and\r\nsubdued three hundred nations, and fought with three millions of men\r\nat different times, of whom he destroyed one million in battle and\r\ntook as many prisoners.\r\n\r\nXVI.[479] So great were the good-will and devotion of Cæsar's\r\nsoldiers to him, that those who under other generals were in no way\r\nsuperior to ordinary soldiers, were invincible and irresistible and\r\nready to meet any danger for Cæsar's glory. An instance of this is\r\nAcilius, who in the sea-fight of Massalia[480] boarded one of the\r\nenemy's ships and had his right hand cut off with a sword, but he\r\nstill kept hold of his shield with the left hand and striking at the\r\nfaces of the enemy drove all to flight and got possession of the\r\nvessel. Another instance was Cassius Scæva,[481] who in the fight at\r\nDyrrachium had one eye destroyed by an arrow, his shoulder transfixed\r\nwith one javelin and his thigh with another, and on his shield he had\r\nreceived the blows of one hundred and thirty missiles. In this plight\r\nhe called to the enemy as if he designed to surrender himself, and two\r\nof them accordingly approached him, but with his sword he lopped off\r\none man's shoulder and wounding the other in the face, put him to\r\nflight, and finally he escaped himself with the aid of his friends. In\r\nBritannia on one occasion the natives had attacked the foremost\r\ncenturions who had got into a marshy spot full of water, upon which,\r\nin the presence of Cæsar who was viewing the contest, a soldier rushed\r\ninto the midst of the enemy, and after performing many conspicuous\r\nacts of valour, rescued the centurions from the barbarians, who took\r\nto flight. The soldier, with difficulty attempting to cross after all\r\nthe rest, plunged into the muddy stream, and with great trouble and\r\nthe loss of his shield, sometimes swimming, sometimes walking, he got\r\nsafe over. While those who were about Cæsar were admiring his conduct\r\nand coming to receive him with congratulations and shouts, the\r\nsoldier, with the greatest marks of dejection and tears in his eyes,\r\nfell down at Cæsar's feet and begged pardon for the loss of his\r\nshield. Again, in Libya, Scipio's party having taken one of Cæsar's\r\nships in which was Granius Petro, who had been appointed quæstor, made\r\nbooty of all the rest, but offered to give the quæstor his life; but\r\nhe replying that it was the fashion with Cæsar's soldiers to give and\r\nnot to accept mercy, killed himself with his own sword.\r\n\r\nXVII. This courage and emulation Cæsar cherished and created, in the\r\nfirst place by distributing rewards and honours without stint, and\r\nthus showing that he did not get wealth from the enemy for his own\r\nenjoyment and pleasure, but that it was treasured up with him as the\r\ncommon reward of courage, and that he was rich only in proportion as\r\nhe rewarded deserving soldiers; and in the next place by readily\r\nundergoing every danger and never shrinking from any toil. Now they\r\ndid not so much admire Cæsar's courage, knowing his love of glory; but\r\nhis endurance of labour beyond his body's apparent power of sustaining\r\nit, was a matter of astonishment, for he was of a spare habit, and had\r\na white and soft skin, and was subject to complaints in the head and\r\nto epileptic fits, which, as it is said, first attacked him at\r\nCorduba;[482] notwithstanding all this, he did not make his feeble\r\nhealth an excuse for indulgence, but he made military service the\r\nmeans of his cure, by unwearied journeying, frugal diet, and by\r\nconstantly keeping in the open air and enduring fatigue, struggling\r\nwith his malady and keeping his body proof against its attacks. He\r\ngenerally slept in chariots or in litters, making even his repose a\r\nkind of action; and in the daytime he used to ride in a vehicle to the\r\ngarrisons, cities and camps, with a slave by his side, one of those\r\nwho were expert at taking down what was dictated on a journey, and a\r\nsingle soldier behind him armed with a sword. He used to travel so\r\nquick that on his first journey from Rome he reached the Rhodanus[483]\r\nin eight days. From his boyhood he was a good horseman, for he had\r\nbeen accustomed to place his hands behind him and, holding them close\r\ntogether on his back, to put the horse to his full speed. In that\r\ncampaign he also practised himself in dictating letters as he was\r\nriding and thus giving employment to two scribes, and as Oppius[484]\r\nsays, to more. He is said also to have introduced the practice of\r\ncommunicating with his friends by letters, as there was no time for\r\npersonal interviews on urgent affairs, owing to the amount of business\r\nand the size of the city. This anecdote also is cited as a proof of\r\nhis indifference as to diet. On one occasion when he was entertained\r\nat supper by his host Valerius Leo[485] in Mediolanum, asparagus was\r\nserved up with myrum poured on it instead of oil, which Cæsar ate\r\nwithout taking any notice of it, and reproved his friends who were out\r\nof humour on the occasion. \"You should be content,\" he said, \"not to\r\neat what you don't like; but to find fault with your host's\r\nill-breeding is to be as ill-bred as himself.\" Once upon a journey he\r\nwas compelled by a storm to take shelter in a poor man's hut, which\r\ncontained only a single chamber and that hardly large enough for one\r\nperson, on which he observed to his friends that the post of honour\r\nmust be given to the worthiest and the place of safety to the weakest;\r\nand he bade Oppius lie down while he and the rest slept in the porch.\r\n\r\nXVIII. Cæsar's first Gallic campaign was against the Helvetii[486] and\r\nTigurini, who had burnt their cities, twelve in number, and their\r\nvillages, of which there were four hundred, and were advancing through\r\nthat part of Gaul which was subject to the Romans, like the Cimbri and\r\nTeutones of old, to whom they were considered to be not inferior in\r\ncourage and in numbers equal, being in all three hundred thousand, of\r\nwhom one hundred and ninety thousand were fighting men. The Tigurini\r\nwere not opposed by Cæsar in person, but by Labienus, who was sent\r\nagainst them by Cæsar and totally defeated them near the Arar. The\r\nHelvetii fell on Cæsar unexpectedly as he was leading his forces to a\r\nfriendly city, but he succeeded in making his way to a strong\r\nposition, where he rallied his army and prepared for battle. A horse\r\nbeing brought to him, he said, \"I shall want this for the pursuit\r\nafter I have defeated the enemy; but let us now move on against them;\"\r\nand accordingly he made the charge on foot. After a long and difficult\r\ncontest, the Helvetian warriors were driven back, but the hardest\r\nstruggle was about the chariots and the camp, for the Helvetians made\r\na stand there and a desperate resistance, and also their wives and\r\nchildren, who fought till they were cut to pieces, and the battle was\r\nhardly over at midnight. This glorious deed of victory Cæsar followed\r\nup by one still better, for he brought together those who had escaped\r\nfrom the battle and compelled them to re-occupy the tract which they\r\nhad left and to rebuild the cities which they had destroyed; and the\r\nnumber of these was above one hundred thousand. His object in this\r\nmeasure was to prevent the Germans from crossing the Rhenus and\r\noccupying the vacant country.\r\n\r\nXIX. His next contest was with the Germans and for the immediate\r\ndefence of the Gauls, although he had before this made an alliance\r\nwith their king Ariovistus[487] in Rome. But the Germans were\r\nintolerable neighbours to Cæsar's subjects, and if opportunity\r\noffered, it was supposed that they would not remain satisfied with\r\nwhat they had, but would invade and occupy Gaul. Cæsar observing his\r\nofficers afraid of the approaching contest, and particularly the men\r\nof rank and the youths who had joined him in the expectation of\r\nfinding a campaign with Cæsar a matter of pleasure and profit, called\r\nthem to a public assembly and bade them leave him and not fight\r\nagainst their inclination since they were so cowardly and effeminate:\r\nas for himself he said he would take the tenth legion by itself and\r\nlead it against the enemy, knowing that he should not have to deal\r\nwith a braver enemy than the Cimbri, and that he was not a worse\r\ngeneral than Marius. Upon this the tenth legion sent a deputation of\r\ntheir body to thank him, but the rest of the legions abused their own\r\nofficers, and the whole army, full of impetuosity and eagerness, all\r\nfollowed Cæsar, marching for many days, till they encamped within two\r\nhundred stadia of the enemy. The courage of Ariovistus was somewhat\r\nbroken by the bare approach of the Romans; for as he had supposed that\r\nthe Romans would not stand the attack of the Germans, and he never\r\nexpected that they would turn assailants, he was amazed at Cæsar's\r\ndaring and he also saw that his own army was disturbed. The spirit of\r\nthe Germans was still more blunted by the predictions of their wise\r\nwomen, who observing the eddies in the rivers and drawing signs from\r\nthe whirlings and noise of the waters, foreboded the future and\r\ndeclared that the army ought not to fight before it was new moon.\r\nCæsar hearing of this and perceiving that the Germans were inactive,\r\nthought it a good opportunity for engaging with them, while they were\r\nout of spirits instead of sitting still and waiting for their time. By\r\nattacking their fortifications and the hills on which they were\r\nencamped, he irritated the Germans and provoked them to come down in\r\npassion and fight. The Germans were completely routed and pursued to\r\nthe Rhenus a distance of four hundred stadia, and the whole of this\r\nspace was strewed with dead bodies and arms. Ariovistus with a few\r\nescaped across the river. The dead are said to have been eighty\r\nthousand in number.\r\n\r\nXX. After these exploits he left his forces among the Sequani[488] to\r\nwinter, and with the view of attending to what was going on at Rome,\r\ncame down to Gaul about the Padus, which was a part of his province;\r\nfor the river Rubico separates the rest of Italy from Gaul beneath the\r\nAlps. Fixing his residence there, he carried on his political\r\nintrigues, and many persons came to visit him to whom he gave what\r\nthey asked for; and he dismissed all either with their wishes\r\nsatisfied, or with hopes. During the whole period of his government in\r\nGaul, he conducted his operations without attracting any attention\r\nfrom Pompeius, though at one time he was subduing the enemy by the\r\narms of the citizens, and at another capturing and subjecting the\r\ncitizens by the money which he got from the enemy. Hearing that the\r\nBelgæ[489] had risen in arms, who were the most powerful nation of the\r\nGauls and in possession of a third part of all Gaul, and that they had\r\nassembled many ten thousands of armed men, he immediately turned about\r\nand went against them with all possible expedition; and falling upon\r\nthe enemy while they were plundering the Gauls who were in alliance\r\nwith the Romans, he put to flight and destroyed those who were\r\ncollected in greatest numbers and the chief part of them after an\r\nunsuccessful resistance, and such was the slaughter that the Romans\r\ncrossed the lakes and deep rivers over the dead bodies. Of the rebels\r\nall who dwelt near the ocean surrendered without resistance; but\r\nagainst the fiercest and most warlike of those in these parts, the\r\nNervii,[490] Cæsar led his forces. The Nervii, who inhabited the dense\r\nthickets and had placed their families and property in a deep recess\r\nof the forest as far as possible from the enemy, suddenly, to the\r\nnumber of sixty thousand, attacked Cæsar while he was fortifying his\r\ncamp and not expecting a battle, and they put the Roman cavalry to\r\nflight, and surrounding the twelfth and seventh legions, killed all\r\nthe centurions. If Cæsar had not seized a shield and, making his way\r\nthrough the first ranks, charged the barbarians, and if the tenth\r\nlegion had not run down from the heights to support him when he was in\r\ndanger of being overpowered, and broken the ranks of the enemy, it is\r\nsupposed that not a single Roman would have escaped. Encouraged by\r\nCæsar's intrepidity, the Romans fought, as the saying is, beyond their\r\nstrength, but yet they could not put the Nervii to flight, who\r\ndefended themselves till they were cut to pieces. Out of sixty\r\nthousand only five hundred are said to have escaped; and three\r\nsenators out of four hundred.\r\n\r\nXXI. The Senate on receiving intelligence of this victory, decreed\r\nthat for fifteen days[491] there should be sacrifices to the gods and\r\ncessation from all business, with feasting, which had never been done\r\nbefore, for so long a time. For the danger was considered to have been\r\ngreat, so many nations having broken out at once; and because Cæsar\r\nwas the conqueror, the good will of the many towards him made the\r\nvictory more splendid. And accordingly, having settled affairs in\r\nGaul, he again spent the winter in the plain of the Padus, and\r\nemployed himself in intriguing at Rome. Not only the candidates for\r\nthe offices of the State carried their election by Cæsar supplying\r\nthem with money which they spent in bribing the people, and directed\r\nall their measures to the increase of Cæsar's power, but the greater\r\npart of the Romans most distinguished for rank and political power,\r\ncame to see him at Luca,[492] Pompeius and Crassus, and Appius, the\r\ngovernor of Sardinia, and Nepos, proconsul of Iberia, so that there\r\nwere a hundred and twenty lictors there, and more than two hundred\r\nsenators. Their deliberations resulted in this: it was agreed that\r\nPompeius and Crassus should be made consuls, and that Cæsar should\r\nhave an allowance of money and five additional years in his province,\r\nwhich to all reflecting people seemed the most extravagant thing of\r\nall. For those who were receiving so much from Cæsar, urged the Senate\r\nto grant him money as if he had none, or rather compelled the Senate\r\nto do it, groaning as it were over its own decrees. Cato, indeed, was\r\nnot present, for he had been purposely sent out of the way on a\r\nmission to Cyprus; and Favonius, who affected to imitate Cato, finding\r\nhe could do nothing by his opposition, hastily left the Senate and\r\nbegan to clamour to the people. But nobody attended to him, some from\r\nfear of displeasing Pompeius and Crassus, but the greater part kept\r\nquiet to please Cæsar, living on hopes from him.\r\n\r\nXXII. Cæsar again returned to his troops in Gaul where he found much\r\nwar in the country, for two great German nations had just crossed the\r\nRhenus for the purpose of getting land; the one nation was called\r\nUsipes,[493] and the other Tenteritæ. Respecting the battle with them,\r\nCæsar says in his Commentaries,[494] that the barbarians, while they\r\nwere treating with him during a truce, attacked on their march and so\r\nput to flight his own cavalry to the number of five thousand with\r\neight hundred of their own, for his men were not expecting an attack;\r\nthat they then sent other ambassadors to him intending to deceive him\r\nagain, whom he detained, and then led his army against the barbarians,\r\nconsidering all faith towards such faithless men and violators of\r\ntruces to be folly. But Tanusius[495] says that while the senate were\r\ndecreeing festivals and sacrifices for the victory, Cato delivered it\r\nas his opinion, that they ought to give up Cæsar to the barbarians,\r\nand so purge themselves of the violation of the truce on behalf of the\r\ncity, and turn the curse on the guilty man. Of those who had crossed\r\nthe river there were slaughtered to the number of four hundred\r\nthousand, and the few who recrossed the river were received by the\r\nSugambri[496] a German tribe. Cæsar laying hold of this ground of\r\ncomplaint against the Germans, and being also greedy of glory and\r\ndesirous to be the first man to cross the Rhenus with an army, began\r\nto build a bridge over the river, which was very broad, and in this\r\npart of the bed spread out widest, and was rough, and ran with a\r\nstrong current so as to drive the trunks of trees that were carried\r\ndown and logs of wood against the supports of the bridge,[497] and\r\ntear them asunder. But Cæsar planted large timbers across the bed of\r\nthe river above the bridge to receive the trees that floated down, and\r\nthus bridling the descending current, beyond all expectation he\r\naccomplished the completion of the bridge in ten days.\r\n\r\nXXIII. Cæsar now led his troops over the river, no one venturing to\r\noppose him, and even the Suevi, the most valiant of the Germans,\r\nretired with their property into deep woody valleys. After devastating\r\nwith fire the enemy's country and encouraging all those who favoured\r\nthe Romans, he returned into Gaul after spending eighteen days in\r\nGermany. His expedition against the Britanni[498] was notorious for\r\nits daring: for he was the first who entered the western Ocean with\r\nan armament and sailed through the Atlantic sea, leading an army to\r\nwar; and by attempting to occupy an island of incredible magnitude,\r\nwhich furnished matter for much dispute to numerous writers, who\r\naffirmed that the name and the accounts about it were pure inventions,\r\nfor it never had existed and did not then exist, he extended the Roman\r\nsupremacy beyond the inhabited world. After twice crossing over to the\r\nisland from the opposite coast of Gaul, and worsting the enemy in many\r\nbattles rather than advantaging his own men, for there was nothing\r\nworth taking from men who lived so wretched a life and were so poor,\r\nhe brought the war to a close not such as he wished, but taking\r\nhostages from the king and imposing a tribute, he retired from the\r\nisland. On his return he found letters which were just going to cross\r\nover to him from his friends in Rome, informing him of his daughter's\r\ndeath, who died in child-birth in the house of her husband Pompeius.\r\nGreat was the grief of Pompeius, and great was the grief of Cæsar; and\r\ntheir friends were also troubled, as the relationship was now\r\ndissolved which maintained peace and concord in the State, which but\r\nfor this alliance was threatened with disturbance. The child also died\r\nafter surviving the mother only a few days. Now the people, in spite\r\nof the tribunes, carried Julia[499] to the Field of Mars, where her\r\nobsequies were celebrated; and there she lies.\r\n\r\nXXIV. As the force of Cæsar was now large, he was obliged to\r\ndistribute it in many winter encampments. But while he was on his road\r\nto Italy, according to his custom, there was another general rising of\r\nthe Gauls, and powerful armies scouring the country attempted to\r\ndestroy the winter camps, and attacked the Roman entrenchments. The\r\nmost numerous and bravest of the revolted Gauls under Abriorix\r\ndestroyed Cotta[500] and Titurius with their army; and the legion\r\nunder Cicero[501] they surrounded with sixty thousand men and\r\nblockaded, and they came very near taking the camp by storm, for all\r\nthe Romans had been wounded and were courageously defending themselves\r\nabove their strength. When this intelligence reached Cæsar, who was at\r\na distance, he quickly turned about, and getting together seven\r\nthousand men in all, he hurried to release Cicero from the blockade.\r\nThe besiegers were aware of his approach and met him with the\r\nintention of cutting him off at once, for they despised the fewness of\r\nhis numbers. But Cæsar, deceiving the enemy, avoided them continually,\r\nand having occupied a position which was advantageous to one who had\r\nto contend against many with a small force, he fortified his camp, and\r\nkept his men altogether from fighting; and he made them increase the\r\nheight of the ramparts and build up the gates as if they were afraid,\r\nhis manœuvre being to make the enemy despise him, till at last when\r\nthey made their assault in scattered bodies, urged by self-confidence,\r\nsallying out he put them to flight and killed many of them.\r\n\r\nXXV.[502] The frequent defections of the Gauls in those parts were\r\nthus quieted, and also by Cæsar during the winter moving about in all\r\ndirections and carefully watching disturbances. For there had come to\r\nhim from Italy three legions to replace those that had perished,\r\nPompeius having lent him two of those which were under his command,\r\nand one legion having been newly raised in Gaul upon the Padus. But in\r\nthe course of time there showed themselves, what had long in secret\r\nbeen planted and spread abroad by the most powerful men among the most\r\nwarlike tribes, the elements of the greatest and the most dangerous of\r\nall the wars in Gaul, strengthened by a numerous body of young men\r\narmed and collected from all quarters, and by great stores brought\r\ntogether, and fortified cities, and countries difficult of access. And\r\nat that time, during the winter, frozen rivers and forests buried in\r\nsnow, and plains overflowed by winter torrents, and in some parts\r\npaths that could not be discovered for the depth of the snow, and in\r\nother parts the great uncertainty of a march through marshes and\r\nstreams diverted from their course, seemed to place the proceedings of\r\nthe insurgents altogether beyond any attempt on the part of Cæsar.\r\nAccordingly many tribes had revolted, but the leaders of the revolt\r\nwere the Arvenni and the Carnuntini; Vergentorix was elected to the\r\nsupreme direction of the war, he whose father the Gauls had put to\r\ndeath on the ground of aiming at a tyranny.\r\n\r\nXXVI. Vergentorix,[503] dividing his force into many parts, and\r\nplacing over them many commanders, began to gain over all the\r\nsurrounding country as far as those who bordered on the Arar, it being\r\nhis design, as Cæsar's enemies in Rome were combining against him, to\r\nrouse all Gaul to war. If he had attempted this a little later, when\r\nCæsar was engaged in the civil war, alarms no less than those from the\r\ninvasion of the Cimbri would have seized on Italy. But now Cæsar, who\r\nappears to have had the talent for making the best use of all\r\nopportunities in war, and particularly critical seasons, as soon as he\r\nheard of the rising, set out on his march, by the very roads[504] that\r\nhe traversed, and the impetuosity and rapidity of his march in so\r\nsevere a winter letting the barbarians see that an invincible and\r\nunvanquished army was coming against them. For where no one believed\r\nthat a messenger or a letter-carrier from him could make his way in a\r\nlong time, there was Cæsar seen with all his army, at once ravaging\r\ntheir lands, and destroying the forts, taking cities, and receiving\r\nthose who changed sides and came over to him, till at last even the\r\nnation of the Edui[505] declared against him, who up to this time had\r\ncalled themselves brothers of the Romans, and had received signal\r\ndistinction, but now by joining the insurgents they greatly\r\ndispirited Cæsar's troops. In consequence of this, Cæsar moved from\r\nthose parts, and passed over the territory of the Lingones,[506]\r\nwishing to join the Sequani, who were friends, and formed a bulwark in\r\nfront of Italy against the rest of Gaul. There the enemy fell upon him\r\nand hemmed him in with many ten thousands, upon which Cæsar resolved\r\nto fight a decisive battle against the combined forces, and after a\r\ngreat contest, he gained a victory at last, and with great slaughter,\r\nrouted the barbarians; but at first it appears that he sustained some\r\nloss, and the Aruveni show a dagger[507] suspended in a temple, which\r\nthey say was taken from Cæsar. Cæsar himself afterwards saw it, and\r\nsmiled; and when his friends urged him to take it down, he would not,\r\nbecause he considered it consecrated.\r\n\r\nXXVII. However, the chief part of those who then escaped, fled with\r\nthe king to the city of Alesia.[508] And while Cæsar was besieging\r\nthis city, which was considered to be impregnable by reason of the\r\nstrength of the walls and the number of the defenders, there fell upon\r\nhim from without a danger great beyond all expectation. For the\r\nstrength of all the nations in Gaul assembling in arms came against\r\nAlesia, to the number of three hundred thousand; and the fighting men\r\nin the city were not fewer than one hundred and seventy thousand; so\r\nthat Cæsar being caught between two such forces and blockaded, was\r\ncompelled to form two walls for his protection, the one towards the\r\ncity, and the other opposite those who had come upon him, since, if\r\nthese forces should unite, his affairs would be entirely ruined. On\r\nmany accounts then, and with good reason, the hazard before the walls\r\nof Alesia was famed abroad, as having produced deeds of daring and\r\nskill such as no other struggle had done; but it is most worthy of\r\nadmiration that Cæsar engaged with so many thousands outside of the\r\ntown and defeated them without it being known to those in the city;\r\nand still more admirable, that this was also unknown to the Romans who\r\nwere guarding the wall towards the city. For they knew nothing of the\r\nvictory till they heard the weeping of the men in Alesia and the\r\nwailing of the women, when they saw on the other side many shields\r\nadorned with silver and gold, and many breastplates smeared with\r\nblood, and also cups and Gallic tents conveyed by the Romans to their\r\ncamp. So quickly did so mighty a force, like a phantom or a dream,\r\nvanish out of sight and disperse, the greater part of the men having\r\nfallen in battle. But those who held Alesia, after giving no small\r\ntrouble to themselves and to Cæsar, at last surrendered; and the\r\nleader of the whole war, Vergentorix, putting on his best armour, and\r\nequipping his horse, came out through the gates, and riding round\r\nCæsar who was seated, and then leaping down from his horse, he threw\r\noff his complete armour, and seating himself at Cæsar's feet, he\r\nremained there till he was delivered up to be kept for the triumph.\r\n\r\nXXVIII.[509] Cæsar had long ago resolved to put down Pompeius, as\r\nPompeius also had fully resolved to do towards him. For now that\r\nCrassus had lost his life among the Parthians, who kept a watch over\r\nboth of them, it remained for one of them, in order to be the chief,\r\nto put down him who was, and to him who was the chief, to take off the\r\nman whom he feared, in order that this might not befall him. But it\r\nhad only recently occurred to Pompeius to take alarm, and hitherto he\r\nhad despised Cæsar, thinking it would be no difficult thing for the\r\nman whom he had elevated to be again depressed by him; but Cæsar, who\r\nhad formed his design from the beginning, like an athlete, removed\r\nhimself to a distance from his antagonists, and exercised himself in\r\nthe Celtic wars, and thus disciplined his troops and increased his\r\nreputation, being elevated by his exploits to an equality with the\r\nvictories of Pompeius; also laying hold of pretexts, some furnished by\r\nthe conduct of Pompeius himself, and others by the times and the\r\ndisordered state of the administration at Rome, owing to which, those\r\nwho were candidates for magistracies placed tables in public and\r\nshamelessly bribed the masses, and the people being hired went down to\r\nshow their partisanship not with votes on behalf of their briber, but\r\nwith bows and swords and slings. And after polluting the Rostra with\r\nblood and dead bodies, they separated, leaving the city to anarchy,\r\nlike a ship carried along without a pilot, so that sensible men were\r\nwell content if matters should result in nothing worse than a monarchy\r\nafter such madness and such tempest. And there were many who even\r\nventured to say publicly that the state of affairs could only be\r\nremedied by a monarchy, and that they ought to submit to this remedy\r\nwhen applied by the mildest of physicians, hinting at Pompeius. But\r\nwhen Pompeius in what he said affected to decline the honour, though\r\nin fact he was more than anything else labouring to bring about his\r\nappointment as dictator, Cato, who saw through his intention,\r\npersuaded the Senate to appoint him sole consul, that he might not by\r\nviolent means get himself made dictator, and might be contented with a\r\nmere constitutional monarchy. They also decreed an additional period\r\nfor his provinces: and he had two, Iberia[510] and all Libya, which he\r\nadministered by sending Legati and maintaining armies, for which he\r\nreceived out of the public treasury a thousand talents every year.\r\n\r\nXXIX. Upon this, Cæsar began to canvass for a consulship by sending\r\npersons to Rome, and also for a prorogation of the government of his\r\nprovinces. At first Pompeius kept silent, but Marcellus[511] and\r\nLentulus opposed his claim, for they hated Cæsar on other grounds, and\r\nthey added to what was necessary what was not necessary, to dishonour\r\nand insult him. For they deprived of the citizenship the inhabitants\r\nof Novum Comum[512] a colony lately settled by Cæsar in Gaul; and\r\nMarcellus, who was consul, punished with stripes one of the Senators\r\nof Novum Comum who had come to Rome, and added too this insult, \"That\r\nhe put these marks upon him to show that he was not a Roman,\" and he\r\ntold him to go and show them to Cæsar. After the consulship of\r\nMarcellus, when Cæsar had now profusely poured forth his Gallic wealth\r\nfor all those engaged in public life to draw from, and had released\r\nCurio[513] the tribune from many debts, and given to Paulus the consul\r\nfifteen hundred talents, out of which he decorated the Forum with the\r\nBasilica, a famous monument which he built in place of the old one\r\ncalled Fulvia;--under these circumstances, Pompeius, fearing cabal,\r\nboth openly himself and by means of his friends exerted himself to\r\nhave a successor[514] appointed to Cæsar in his government, and he\r\nsent and demanded back of him the soldiers[515] which he had lent to\r\nCæsar for the Gallic wars. Cæsar sent the men back after giving each\r\nof them a present of two hundred and fifty drachmæ. The officers who\r\nled these troops to Pompeius, spread abroad among the people reports\r\nabout Cæsar which were neither decent nor honest; and they misled\r\nPompeius by ill-founded hopes, telling him that the army of Cæsar\r\nlonged to see him, and that while he with difficulty directed affairs\r\nat Rome owing to the odium produced by secret intrigues, the force\r\nwith Cæsar was all ready for him, and that if Cæsar's soldiers should\r\nonly cross over to Italy, they would forthwith be on his side: so\r\nhateful, they said, had Cæsar become to them on account of his\r\nnumerous campaigns, and so suspected owing to their fear of monarchy.\r\nWith all this Pompeius was inflated, and he neglected to get soldiers\r\nin readiness, as if he were under no apprehension; but by words and\r\nresolution he was overpowering Cæsar, as he supposed, by carrying\r\ndecrees against him, which Cæsar cared not for at all. It is even said\r\nthat one of the centurions who had been sent by him to Rome, while\r\nstanding in front of the Senate-house, on hearing that the Senate\r\nwould not give Cæsar a longer term in his government. \"But this,\" he\r\nsaid, \"shall give it,\" striking the hilt of his sword with his hand.\r\n\r\nXXX. However, the claim of Cæsar at least had a striking show of\r\nequity. For he proposed that he should lay down his arms and that when\r\nPompeius had done the same and both had become private persons, they\r\nshould get what favours they could from the citizens; and he argued\r\nthat if they took from him his power and confirmed to Pompeius what he\r\nhad, they would be stigmatizing one as a tyrant and making the other a\r\ntyrant in fact. When Curio made this proposal before the people on\r\nbehalf of Cæsar, he was loudly applauded; and some even threw chaplets\r\nof flowers upon him as on a victorious athlete. Antonius, who was\r\ntribune, produced to the people a letter[516] of Cæsar's on this\r\nsubject which he had received, and he read it in spite of the\r\nconsuls. But in the Senate, Scipio, the father-in-law of Pompeius,\r\nmade a motion, that if Cæsar did not lay down his arms on a certain\r\nday, he should be declared an enemy. Upon the consuls putting the\r\nquestion, whether they were of opinion that Pompeius should dismiss\r\nhis troops, and again, whether Cæsar should, very few voted in favour\r\nof the former question, and all but a few voted in favour of the\r\nlatter; but when Antonius[517] on his side moved that both should\r\ndismiss their troops, all unanimously were in favour of that opinion.\r\nScipio made a violent opposition, and Lentulus, the consul, called out\r\nthat they needed arms to oppose a robber, and not votes, on which the\r\nSenate broke up and the Senators changed their dress as a sign of\r\nlamentation on account of the dissension.\r\n\r\nXXXI. But when letters had come from Cæsar by which he appeared to\r\nmoderate his demands, for he proposed to surrender everything else\r\nexcept Gaul within the Alps and Illyricum with two legions, which\r\nshould be given to him to hold till he was a candidate for a second\r\nconsulship, and Cicero the orator, who had just returned from Cilicia\r\nand was labouring at a reconciliation, was inducing Pompeius to\r\nrelent, and Pompeius was ready to yield in everything else except as\r\nto the soldiers, whom he still insisted on taking from Cæsar, Cicero\r\nurged the friends of Cæsar to give in and to come to a settlement on\r\nthe terms of the above-mentioned provinces and the allowance of six\r\nthousand soldiers, only to Cæsar. Pompeius was ready to yield and to\r\ngive way; but the consul Lentulus would not let him, and he went so\r\nfar as to insult and drive with dishonour from the Senate both Curio\r\nand Antonius, thus himself contriving for Cæsar the most specious of\r\nall pretexts, by the aid of which indeed Cæsar mainly excited the\r\npassions of his men, pointing out to them that men of distinction and\r\nmagistrates had made their escape in hired vehicles in the dress of\r\nslaves. For, putting on this guise through fear, they had stolen out\r\nof Rome.\r\n\r\nXXXII. Now Cæsar had about him no more than three hundred horse and\r\nfive thousand legionary soldiers; for the rest of his army, which had\r\nbeen left beyond the Alps, was to be conducted by those whom he sent\r\nfor that purpose. Seeing that the commencement of his undertaking and\r\nthe onset did not so much require a large force at the present, but\r\nwere to be effected by the alarm which a bold stroke would create and\r\nby quickly seizing his opportunity, for he concluded that he should\r\nstrike terror by his unexpected movement more easily than he could\r\noverpower his enemies by attacking them with all his force, he ordered\r\nhis superior officers and centurions with their swords alone and\r\nwithout any other weapons to take Ariminum, a large city of Gaul,\r\navoiding all bloodshed and confusion as much as possible; and he\r\nintrusted the force to Hortensius.[518] Cæsar himself passed the day\r\nin public, standing by some gladiators who were exercising, and\r\nlooking on; and a little before evening after attending to his person\r\nand going into the mess-room and staying awhile with those who were\r\ninvited to supper, just as it was growing dark he rose, and\r\ncourteously addressing the guests, told them to wait for his return,\r\nbut he had previously given notice to a few of his friends to follow\r\nhim, not all by the same route, but by different directions. Mounting\r\none of the hired vehicles, he drove at first along another road, and\r\nthen turning towards Ariminium, when he came to the stream which\r\ndivides Gaul within the Alps from the rest of Italy (it is called\r\nRubico[519] , and he began to calculate as he approached nearer to\r\nthe danger, and was agitated by the magnitude of the hazard, he\r\nchecked his speed; and halting he considered about many things with\r\nhimself in silence, his mind moving from one side to the other, and\r\nhis will then underwent many changes; and he also discussed at length\r\nwith his friends who were present, of whom Pollio Asinius[520] was\r\none, all the difficulties, and enumerated the evils which would ensue\r\nto all mankind from his passage of the river, and how great a report\r\nof it they would leave to posterity. At last, with a kind of passion,\r\nas if he were throwing himself out of reflection into the future, and\r\nuttering what is the usual expression with which men preface their\r\nentry upon desperate enterprises and daring, \"Let the die be cast,\" he\r\nhurried to cross the river; and thence advancing at full speed, he\r\nattacked Ariminum before daybreak and took it. It is said that on the\r\nnight before the passage of the river, he had an impure dream,[521]\r\nfor he dreamed that he was in unlawful commerce with his mother.\r\n\r\nXXXIII. But when Ariminum was taken, as if the war had been let loose\r\nthrough wide gates over all the earth and sea at once, and the laws of\r\nthe state were confounded together with the limits of the province,\r\none would not have supposed that men and women only, as on other\r\noccasions, in alarm were hurrying through Italy, but that the cities\r\nthemselves, rising from their foundations, were rushing in flight one\r\nthrough another; and Rome herself, as if she were deluged by torrents,\r\nowing to the crowding of the people from the neighbouring towns and\r\ntheir removal, could neither easily be pacified by magistrate nor kept\r\nin order by words, and in the midst of the mighty swell and the\r\ntossing of the tempest, narrowly escaped being overturned by her own\r\nagitation. For contending emotions and violent movements occupied\r\nevery place. Neither did those who rejoiced keep quiet, but in many\r\nplaces, as one might expect in a large city, coming into collision\r\nwith those who were alarmed and sorrowing, and being full of\r\nconfidence as to the future, they fell to wrangling with them; and\r\npeople from various quarters assailed Pompeius, who was terror-struck\r\nand had to endure the censure of one party for strengthening Cæsar\r\nagainst himself and the supremacy of Rome, while others charged him\r\nwith inciting Lentulus to insult Cæsar who was ready to give way and\r\nwas proposing fair terms of accommodation. Favonius bade him stamp on\r\nthe ground with his foot; for Pompeius on one occasion in an arrogant\r\naddress to the Senate, told them not to be concerned or trouble\r\nthemselves about preparations for war; when Cæsar advanced, he would\r\nstamp upon the earth with his foot and fill Italy with armies.\r\nHowever, even then Pompeius had the advantage over Cæsar in amount of\r\nforces: but nobody would let the man follow his own judgment: and\r\ngiving way to the many false reports and alarms, that the war was now\r\nclose at hand and the enemy in possession of everything, and carried\r\naway by the general movement, he declared by an edict that he saw\r\nthere was tumult, and he left the city after giving his commands to\r\nthe Senate to follow, and that no one should stay who preferred his\r\ncountry and freedom to tyranny.\r\n\r\nXXXIV.[522] Accordingly the consuls fled without even making the\r\nsacrifices which it was usual to make before quitting the city; and\r\nmost of the senators also took to flight, in a manner as if they were\r\nrobbing, each snatching of his own what first came to hand as if it\r\nbelonged to another. There were some also who, though they had\r\nhitherto vehemently supported the party of Cæsar, through alarm at\r\nthat time lost their presence of mind, and without any necessity for\r\nit were carried along with the current of that great movement. A most\r\npiteous sight was the city, when so great a storm was coming on, left\r\nlike a ship whose helmsman had given her up, to be carried along and\r\ndashed against anything that lay in her way. But though this desertion\r\nof the city was so piteous a thing, men for the sake of Pompeius\r\nconsidered the flight to be their country, and they were quitting Rome\r\nas if it were the camp of Cæsar; for even Labienus,[523] one of\r\nCæsar's greatest friends, who had been his legatus and had fought with\r\nhim most gallantly in all the Gallic wars, then fled away from Cæsar\r\nand came to Pompeius. But Cæsar sent to Labienus both his property and\r\nhis baggage; and advancing he pitched his camp close by Domitius, who\r\nwith thirty cohorts held Corfinium.[524] Domitius despairing of\r\nhimself asked his physician, who was a slave, for poison, and taking\r\nwhat was given, he drank it, intending to die. Shortly after, hearing\r\nthat Cæsar showed wonderful clemency towards his prisoners, he\r\nbewailed his fate and blamed the rashness of his resolution. But on\r\nthe physician assuring him that what he had taken was only a sleeping\r\npotion and not deadly, he sprung up overjoyed, and going to Cæsar,\r\nreceived his right hand, and yet he afterwards went over again to\r\nPompeius. This intelligence being carried to Rome made people more\r\ntranquil, and some who had fled, returned.\r\n\r\nXXXV. Cæsar took the troops of Domitius into his service, as well\r\nas the soldiers that were raising for Pompeius whom he surprised in\r\nthe cities; and having now got a numerous and formidable army, he\r\nadvanced against Pompeius. Pompeius did not await his approach, but\r\nfled to Brundisium, and sending the consuls over before him with a\r\nforce to Dyrrachium,[525] himself shortly after sailed from Brundisium\r\nupon the approach of Cæsar, as will be told more particularly in the\r\nLife of Pompeius.[526] Though Cæsar wished to pursue immediately, he\r\nwas prevented by want of ships, and he turned back to Rome, having in\r\nsixty days without bloodshed become master of Italy. Finding the city\r\nmore tranquil than he expected and many of the Senators in it, he\r\naddressed them in moderate and constitutional language,[527] urging\r\nthem to send persons to Pompeius with suitable terms of accommodation;\r\nbut no one listened to his proposal, either because they feared\r\nPompeius, whom they had deserted, or supposed that Cæsar did not\r\nreally mean what he said, and merely used specious words. When the\r\ntribune Metellus[528] attempted to prevent him from taking money from\r\nthe reserved treasure[529] and alleged certain laws, Cæsar replied,\r\n\"That the same circumstances did not suit arms and laws: but do you,\r\nif you don't like what is doing, get out of the way, for war needs not\r\nbold words; when we have laid down our arms after coming to terms,\r\nthen you may come forward and make your speeches to the people.\" \"And\r\nin saying this,\" he continued, \"I waive part of my rights, for you are\r\nmine, and all are mine, who have combined against me, now that I have\r\ncaught them.\" Having thus spoken to Metellus he walked to the doors of\r\nthe treasury; but as the keys were not found, he sent for smiths and\r\nordered them to break the locks. Metellus again opposed him, and some\r\ncommended him for it, but Cæsar, raising his voice, threatened to kill\r\nhim, if he did not stop his opposition, \"And this,\" said he, \"young\r\nman, you well know, is more painful for me to have said than to do.\"\r\nThese words alarmed Metellus and made him retire, and also caused\r\neverything else to be supplied to Cæsar for the war without further\r\ntrouble, and with speed.\r\n\r\nXXXVI. He marched against Iberia,[530] having first determined to\r\ndrive out Afranius and Varro, the legati of Pompeius, and having got\r\ninto his power the forces and the provinces in those parts, then to\r\nadvance against Pompeius without leaving any enemy in his rear. After\r\nhaving often been exposed to risk in his own person from ambuscades,\r\nand with his army chiefly from want of provisions, he never gave up\r\npursuing, challenging to battle and hemming in the enemy with his\r\nlines, till he had made himself master of their camps and forces. The\r\ngenerals escaped to Pompeius.\r\n\r\nXXXVII. On his return to Rome, Piso, the father-in-law of Cæsar,\r\nadvised that they should send commissioners to Pompeius to treat of\r\nterms, but Isauricus opposed the measure to please Cæsar. Being chosen\r\nDictator by the Senate, he restored the exiles, and the children of\r\nthose who had suffered in the times of Sulla,[531] he reinstated in\r\ntheir civil rights, and he relieved the debtors by a certain abatement\r\nof the interest, and took in hand other measures of the like kind, not\r\nmany in number; but in eleven days, he abdicated the monarchy, and\r\ndeclaring himself and Servilius Isauricus consuls[532] set out on his\r\nexpedition. The rest of his forces he passed by on his hurried march,\r\nand with six hundred picked horsemen and five legions, the time being\r\nthe winter solstice and the commencement of January (and this pretty\r\nnearly corresponds to the Poseideon of the Athenians), he put to sea,\r\nand crossing the Ionian gulf he took Oricum and Apollonia; but he sent\r\nback his ships to Brundisium for the soldiers whom he had left behind\r\non his march. But while the men were still on the road, as they were\r\nalready passed the vigour of their age and worn out by the number of\r\ntheir campaigns, they murmured against Cæsar, \"Whither now will he\r\nlead us and where will this man at last carry us to, hurrying us\r\nabout and treating us as if we could never be worn out and as if we\r\nwere inanimate things? even the sword is at last exhausted by blows,\r\nand shield and breastplate need to be spared a little after so long\r\nuse. Even our wounds do not make Cæsar consider that he commands\r\nperishable bodies, and that we are but mortal towards endurance and\r\npain; and the winter season and the storms of the sea even a god\r\ncannot command; but this man runs all risks, as if he were not\r\npursuing his enemies, but flying from them.\" With such words as these\r\nthey marched slowly towards Brundisium. But when they found that Cæsar\r\nhad embarked, then quickly changing their temper, they reproached\r\nthemselves as traitors to their Imperator; and they abused their\r\nofficers also for not hastening the march. Sitting on the heights,\r\nthey looked towards the sea and towards Epirus for the ships which\r\nwere to carry them over to their commander.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. At Apollonia, as Cæsar had not a force sufficient to oppose\r\nthe enemy, and the delay of the troops from Italy put him in\r\nperplexity and much uneasiness, he formed a desperate design, without\r\ncommunicating it to any one, to embark in a twelve-oared boat and go\r\nover to Brundisium, though the sea was commanded by so many ships of\r\nthe enemy.[533] Accordingly, disguising himself in a slave's dress, he\r\nwent on board by night, and throwing himself down as a person of no\r\nimportance, he lay quiet. While the river Anius[534] was carrying down\r\nthe boat towards the sea, the morning breeze, which at that time\r\ngenerally made the water smooth at the outlet of the river by driving\r\nthe waves before it, was beaten down by a strong wind which blew all\r\nnight over the sea; and the river, chafing at the swell of the sea and\r\nthe opposition of the waves, was becoming rough, being driven back by\r\nthe huge blows and violent eddies, so that it was impossible for the\r\nmaster of the boat to make head against it; on which he ordered the\r\nmen to change about, intending to turn the boat round. Cæsar\r\nperceiving this, discovered himself, and taking the master by the\r\nhand, who was alarmed at the sight of him, said, \"Come, my good man,\r\nhave courage and fear nothing; you carry Cæsar and the fortune of\r\nCæsar in your boat.\" The sailors now forgot the storm, and sticking to\r\ntheir oars, worked with all their force to get out of the river. But\r\nas it was impossible to get on, after taking in much water and running\r\ngreat risk at the mouth of the river, Cæsar very unwillingly consented\r\nthat the master should put back. On his return, the soldiers met him\r\nin crowds, and blamed him much and complained that he did not feel\r\nconfident of victory even with them alone, but was vexed and exposed\r\nhimself to risk on account of the absent, as if he distrusted those\r\nwho were present.\r\n\r\nXXXIX. Shortly after Antonius arrived from Brundisium with the troops;\r\nand Cæsar, being now confident, offered battle to Pompeius, who was\r\nwell posted and had sufficient supplies both from land and sea, while\r\nCæsar at first had no abundance, and afterwards was hard pressed for\r\nwant of provisions: but the soldiers cut up a certain root[535] and\r\nmixing it with milk, ate it. And once, having made loaves of it, they\r\nran up to the enemies' outposts, threw the bread into the camp, and\r\npitched it about, adding, that so long as the earth produces such\r\nroots, they will never stop besieging Pompeius. Pompeius, however,\r\nwould not let either the matter of the loaves or these words be made\r\nknown to the mass of the army; for his soldiers were dispirited and\r\ndreaded the savage temper and endurance of the enemy as if they were\r\nwild beasts. There were continually skirmishes about the\r\nfortifications of Pompeius, and Cæsar had the advantage in all except\r\none, in which there was a great rout of his troops and he was in\r\ndanger of losing his camp. For when Pompeius made an onset, no one\r\nstood the attack, but the trenches were filled with the dying, and\r\nCæsar's men were falling about their own ramparts and bulwarks, being\r\ndriven in disorderly flight. Though Cæsar met the fugitives and\r\nendeavoured to turn them, he had no success, and when he laid hold of\r\nthe colours, those who were carrying them threw them down, so that the\r\nenemy took two and thirty, and Cæsar himself had a narrow escape with\r\nhis life. A tall, strong man was running away past by Cæsar, who\r\nputting his hand upon him, ordered him to stand and face the enemy;\r\nbut the man, who was completely confounded by the danger, raised his\r\nsword to strike him, on which Cæsar's shield-bearer struck the man\r\nfirst and cut off his shoulder. Cæsar had so completely given up his\r\ncause as lost, that when Pompeius either through caution or from some\r\naccident did not put the finishing stroke to his great success, but\r\nretreated after shutting up the fugitives within their ramparts, Cæsar\r\nsaid to his friends as he was retiring, To-day the victory would be\r\nwith the enemy, if they had a commander who knew how to conquer. Going\r\ninto his tent and lying down, Cæsar spent that night of all nights in\r\nthe greatest agony and perplexity, considering that his generalship\r\nhad been bad, in that while a fertile country lay near him and the\r\nrich cities of Macedonia and Thessaly, he had neglected to carry the\r\nwar thither, and was now stationed on the sea which the enemy\r\ncommanded with his ships, and that he was rather held in siege by want\r\nof supplies than holding the enemy in siege by his arms. Accordingly,\r\nafter passing a restless night, full of uneasiness at the difficulty\r\nand danger of his present position, he broke up his camp with the\r\ndetermination of leading his troops into Macedonia to oppose Scipio,\r\nfor he concluded that either he should draw Pompeius after him to a\r\ncountry where he would fight without the advantage of having the same\r\nsupplies from the sea, or that he would defeat Scipio if he were left\r\nto himself.\r\n\r\nXL. This encouraged the army of Pompeius and the officers about him\r\nto stick close to Cæsar, whom they considered to have been defeated\r\nand to be making his escape; though Pompeius himself was cautious\r\nabout hazarding a battle for so great a stake, and, as he was\r\nexcellently furnished with everything for prolonging the war, he\r\nthought it best to wear out and weaken the vigour of the enemy, which\r\ncould not be long sustained. For the best fighting men in Cæsar's army\r\npossessed experience and irresistible courage in battle; but in\r\nmarchings and making encampments and assaulting fortifications and\r\nwatching by night, they gave way by reason of their age, and their\r\nbodies were unwieldy for labour, and owing to weakness, had lost their\r\nalacrity. It was also reported that a pestilential disease was\r\nprevalent in Cæsar's army, which had originated in the want of proper\r\nfood; and, what was chief of all, as Cæsar was neither well supplied\r\nwith money nor provisions, it might be expected that in a short time\r\nhis army would be broken up of itself.\r\n\r\nXLI. For these reasons Pompeius did not wish to fight, and Cato alone\r\ncommended his design, because he wished to spare the citizens; for\r\nafter seeing those who had fallen in the battle to the number of a\r\nthousand, he wrapped up his face and went away with tears in his eyes.\r\nBut all the rest abused Pompeius for avoiding a battle, and tried to\r\nurge him on by calling him Agamemnon and King of Kings, by which they\r\nimplied that he was unwilling to lay down the sole command, and was\r\nproud at having so many officers under his orders and coming to his\r\ntent, Favonius, who aped Cato's freedom of speech, raved because they\r\nshould not be able even that year to enjoy the figs of Tusculum owing\r\nto Pompeius being so fond of command; and Afranius (for he had just\r\narrived from Iberia, where he had shown himself a bad general), being\r\ncharged with betraying his army for a bribe, asked why they did not\r\nfight with the merchant who had bought the provinces of him. Pressed\r\nby all this importunity, Pompeius pursued Cæsar with the intention of\r\nfighting, though contrary to his wish. Cæsar accomplished his march\r\nwith difficulty, as no one would supply him with provisions and he was\r\nuniversally despised on account of his recent defeat; however, after\r\ntaking Gomphi,[536] a Thessalian city, he had not only provisions for\r\nhis army, but his men were unexpectedly relieved from their disease.\r\nFor they fell in with abundance of wine, of which they drank\r\nplentifully, and revelling and rioting on their march, by means of\r\ntheir drunkenness, they threw off and got rid of their complaint in\r\nconsequence of their bodies being brought into a different habit.\r\n\r\nXLII. When the two armies had entered the plain of Pharsalus and\r\npitched their camps, Pompeius again fell back into his former opinion,\r\nand there were also unlucky appearances and a vision in his\r\nsleep.[537] He dreamed that he saw himself in the theatre, applauded\r\nby the Romans. But those about him were so confident, and so fully\r\nanticipated a victory, that Domitius and Scipio and Spinther were\r\ndisputing and bestirring themselves against one another about the\r\npriesthood of Cæsar, and many persons sent to Rome to hire and get\r\npossession of houses that were suitable for consuls and prætors,\r\nexpecting to be elected to magistracies immediately after the war. But\r\nthe cavalry showed most impatience for the battle, being sumptuously\r\nequipped with splendid armour, and priding themselves on their\r\nwell-fed horses and fine persons, and on their numbers also, for they\r\nwere seven thousand against Cæsar's thousand. The number of the\r\ninfantry also was unequal, there being forty-five thousand matched\r\nagainst twenty-two thousand.\r\n\r\nXLIII. Cæsar, calling his soldiers together and telling them that\r\nCorfinius[538] was close at hand with two legions, and that other\r\ncohorts to the number of fifteen under Calenus were encamped near\r\nMegara and Athens, asked if they would wait for them or hazard a\r\nbattle by themselves. The soldiers cried out aloud that they did not\r\nwish him to wait, but rather to contrive and so manage his operations\r\nthat they might soonest come to a battle with their enemies. While he\r\nwas performing a lustration of the army, as soon as he had sacrificed\r\nthe first victim, the soothsayer said that within three days there\r\nwould be a decisive battle with the enemy. Upon Cæsar asking him, if\r\nhe saw any favourable sign in the victims as to the result of the\r\nbattle also, he replied, \"You can answer this better for yourself: the\r\ngods indicate a great change and revolution of the actual state of\r\nthings to a contrary state, so that if you think yourself prosperous\r\nin your present condition, expect the worst fortune; but if you do\r\nnot, expect the better.\" As Cæsar was taking his round to inspect the\r\nwatches the night before the battle about midnight, there was seen in\r\nthe heavens a fiery torch, which seemed to pass over Cæsar's camp and\r\nassuming a bright and flame-like appearance to fall down upon the camp\r\nof Pompeius. In the morning watch they perceived that there was also a\r\npanic confusion among the enemy. However, as Cæsar did not expect that\r\nthe enemy would fight on that day, he began to break up his camp with\r\nthe intention of marching to Scotussa.\r\n\r\nXLIV. The tents were already taken down when the scouts rode up to him\r\nwith intelligence that the enemy were coming down to battle, whereupon\r\nCæsar was overjoyed, and after praying to the gods he arranged his\r\nbattle in three divisions. He placed Domitius Calvinus in command of\r\nthe centre, Antonius had the left wing, and he commanded the right,\r\nintending to fight in the tenth legion. Observing that the cavalry of\r\nthe enemy were posting themselves opposite to this wing and fearing\r\ntheir splendid appearance and their numbers, he ordered six cohorts to\r\ncome round to him from the last line without being observed and he\r\nplaced them in the rear of the right wing with orders what to do when\r\nthe enemy's cavalry made their attack. Pompeius commanded his own\r\nright, and Domitius the left, and the centre was under Scipio, his\r\nfather-in-law. But all the cavalry crowded to the left, intending to\r\nsurround the right wing of the enemy and to make a complete rout of\r\nthe men who were stationed about the general; for they believed that\r\nno legionary phalanx, however deep, could resist, but that their\r\nopponents would be completely crushed and broken to pieces by an\r\nattack of so many cavalry at once. When the signal for attack was\r\ngoing to be given on both sides, Pompeius ordered the legionary\r\nsoldiers to stand with their spears presented and in close order to\r\nwait the attack of the enemy till they were within a spear's throw.\r\nBut Cæsar says that here also Pompeius made a mistake, not knowing\r\nthat the first onset, accompanied with running and impetuosity, gives\r\nforce to the blows, and at the same time fires the courage, which is\r\nthus fanned in every way. As Cæsar was about to move his phalanx and\r\nwas going into action, the first centurion that he spied was a man who\r\nwas faithful to him and experienced in war, and was encouraging those\r\nunder his command and urging them to vigorous exertion. Cæsar\r\naddressing him by name said, \"What hopes have we Caius\r\nCrassinius,[539] and how are our men as to courage?\" Crassinius\r\nstretching out his right hand and calling out aloud, said, \"We shall\r\nhave a splendid victory, Cæsar; and you shall praise me whether I\r\nsurvive the day or die.\" Saying this, he was the first to fall on the\r\nenemy at his full speed and carrying with him the hundred and twenty\r\nsoldiers who were under his command. Having cut through the first\r\nrank, he was advancing with great slaughter of the enemy and was\r\ndriving them from their ground, when he was stopped by a blow from a\r\nsword through the mouth, and the point came out at the back of his\r\nneck.\r\n\r\nXLV. The infantry having thus rushed together in the centre and being\r\nengaged in the struggle, the cavalry of Pompeius proudly advanced from\r\nthe wing, extending their companies to enclose Cæsar's right; but\r\nbefore they fell upon the enemy, the cohorts sprang forward from\r\namong Cæsar's troops, not, according to the usual fashion of war,\r\nthrowing their spears nor yet holding them in their hands and aiming\r\nat the thighs and legs of the enemy, but pushing them against their\r\neyes and wounding them in the face; and they had been instructed to do\r\nthis by Cæsar, who was confident that men who had no great familiarity\r\nwith battles or wounds, and were young and very proud of their beauty\r\nand youth, would dread such wounds and would not keep their ground\r\nboth through fear of the present danger and the future disfigurement.\r\nAnd it turned out so; for they could not stand the spears being pushed\r\nup at them nor did they venture to look at the iron that was presented\r\nagainst their eyes, but they turned away and covered their faces to\r\nsave them; and at last, having thus thrown themselves into confusion,\r\nthey turned to flight most disgracefully and ruined the whole cause.\r\nFor those who had defeated the cavalry, immediately surrounded the\r\ninfantry and falling on them in the rear began to cut them down. But\r\nwhen Pompeius saw from the other wing the cavalry dispersed in flight,\r\nhe was no longer the same, nor did he recollect that he was Pompeius\r\nMagnus, but more like a man who was deprived of his understanding by\r\nthe god than anything else,[540] he retired without speaking a word to\r\nhis tent, and sitting down awaited the result, until the rout becoming\r\ngeneral the enemy were assailing the ramparts, and fighting with those\r\nwho defended them. Then, as if he had recovered his senses and\r\nuttering only these words, as it is reported, \"What even to the\r\nramparts!\" he put off his military and general's dress, and taking one\r\nsuited for a fugitive, stole away. But what fortunes he afterwards\r\nhad, and how he gave himself up to the Egyptians and was murdered, I\r\nshall tell in the Life of Pompeius.\r\n\r\nXLVI. When Cæsar entered the camp of Pompeius and saw the bodies of\r\nthose who were already killed, and the slaughter still going on among\r\nthe living, he said with a groan: They would have it so; they brought\r\nme into such a critical position that I, Caius Cæsar, who have been\r\nsuccessful in the greatest wars, should have been condemned, if I had\r\ndisbanded my troops. Asinius Pollio[541] says that Cæsar uttered these\r\nwords on that occasion in Latin, and that he wrote them down in Greek.\r\nHe also says that the chief part of those who were killed were slaves,\r\nand they were killed when the camp was taken; and that not more than\r\nsix thousand soldiers fell. Of those who were taken prisoners, Cæsar\r\ndrafted most into his legions; and he pardoned many men of\r\ndistinction, among whom was Brutus, who afterwards murdered him. Cæsar\r\nis said to have been very much troubled at his not being found, but\r\nwhen Brutus, who had escaped unhurt, presented himself to Cæsar, he\r\nwas greatly pleased.\r\n\r\nXLVII. There were many prognostics of the victory, but the most\r\nremarkable is that which is reported as having appeared at\r\nTralles.[542] In the temple of Victory there stood a statue of Cæsar,\r\nand the ground about it was naturally firm and the surface was also\r\npaved with hard stone; from this, they say, there sprung up a\r\npalm-tree by the pedestal of the statue. In Patavium, Caius Cornelius,\r\na man who had reputation for his skill in divination, a fellow-citizen\r\nand acquaintance of Livius the historian, happened to be sitting that\r\nday to watch the birds. And first of all, as Livius says, he\r\ndiscovered the time of the battle, and he said to those who were\r\npresent that the affair was now deciding and the men were going into\r\naction. Looking again and observing the signs, he sprang up with\r\nenthusiasm and called out, \"You conquer, Cæsar.\" The bystanders being\r\nsurprised, he took the chaplet from his head and said with an oath,\r\nthat he would not put it on again till facts had confirmed his art.\r\nLivius affirms that these things were so.\r\n\r\nXLVIII. Cæsar after giving the Thessalians their liberty[543] in\r\nconsideration of his victory, pursued Pompeius. On reaching Asia[544]\r\nhe made the Cnidians free to please Theopompus,[545] the collector of\r\nmythi, and he remitted to all the inhabitants of Asia the third of\r\ntheir taxes. Arriving at Alexandria[546] after the death of Pompeius,\r\nhe turned away from Theodotus who brought him the head of Pompeius,\r\nbut he received his seal ring[547] and shed tears over it. All the\r\ncompanions and intimate friends of Pompeius who were rambling about\r\nthe country and had been taken by the King, he treated well and gained\r\nover to himself. He wrote to his friends in Rome, that the chief and\r\nthe sweetest pleasure that he derived from his victory, was to be able\r\nto pardon any of those citizens who had fought against him. As to the\r\nwar[548] there, some say that it might have been avoided and that it\r\nbroke out in consequence of his passion for Kleopatra and was\r\ndiscreditable to him and hazardous; but others blame the King's party\r\nand chiefly the eunuch Potheinus,who possessed the chief power, and\r\nhaving lately cut off Pompeius and driven out Kleopatra, was now\r\nsecretly plotting against Cæsar; and on this account they say that\r\nCæsar from that time passed the nights in drinking in order to protect\r\nhimself. But in his public conduct Pothinus was unbearable, for he\r\nboth said and did many things to bring odium on Cæsar and to insult\r\nhim. While measuring out to the soldiers the worst and oldest corn he\r\ntold them they must be satisfied with it and be thankful, as they were\r\neating what belonged to others; and at the meals he used only wooden\r\nand earthen vessels, alleging that Cæsar had got all the gold and\r\nsilver vessels in payment for a debt.[549] For the father of the then\r\nKing owed Cæsar one thousand seven hundred and fifty times ten\r\nthousand, of which Cæsar had remitted the seven hundred and fifty to\r\nthe King's sons before, but he now claimed the one thousand to\r\nmaintain his army with. Upon Pothinus now bidding him take his\r\ndeparture and attend to his important affairs and that he should\r\nafterwards receive his money back with thanks, Cæsar said, that least\r\nof all people did he want the Egyptians as advisers, and he secretly\r\nsent for Kleopatra from the country.\r\n\r\nXLIX. Kleopatra,[550] taking Apollodorus the Sicilian alone of all her\r\nfriends with her, and getting into a small boat, approached the\r\npalace as it was growing dark; and as it was impossible for her to\r\nescape notice in any other way, she got into a bed sack and laid\r\nherself out at full length, and Apollodorus, tying the sack together\r\nwith a cord, carried her through the doors to Cæsar. Cæsar is said to\r\nhave been first captivated by this device of Kleopatra, which showed a\r\ndaring temper, and being completely enslaved by his intercourse with\r\nher and her attractions, he brought about an accommodation between\r\nKleopatra and her brother on the terms of her being associated with\r\nhim in the kingdom. A feast was held to celebrate the reconciliation,\r\nduring which a slave of Cæsar, his barber, owing to his timidity in\r\nwhich he had no equal, leaving nothing unscrutinized, and listening\r\nand making himself very busy, found out that a plot against Cæsar was\r\nforming by Achillas the general and Potheinus the eunuch. Cæsar being\r\nmade acquainted with their design, placed a guard around the\r\napartment, and put Potheinus to death. Achillas escaped to the camp,\r\nand raised about Cæsar a dangerous and difficult war for one who with\r\nso few troops had to resist so large a city and force. In this contest\r\nthe first danger that he had to encounter was being excluded from\r\nwater, for the canals[551] were dammed up by the enemy; and, in the\r\nsecond place, an attempt being made to cut off his fleet, he was\r\ncompelled to repel the danger with fire, which spreading from the\r\narsenals to the large library[552] destroyed it; and, in the third\r\nplace, in the battle near the Pharos[553] he leaped down from the\r\nmound into a small boat and went to aid the combatants; but as the\r\nEgyptians were coming against him from all quarters, he threw himself\r\ninto the sea and swam away with great difficulty. On this occasion it\r\nis said that he had many papers in his hands, and that he did not let\r\nthem go, though the enemy were throwing missiles at him and he had to\r\ndive under the water, but holding the papers above the water with one\r\nhand, he swam with the other; but the boat was sunk immediately. At\r\nlast, when the King had gone over to the enemy, Cæsar attacked and\r\ndefeated them in a battle in which many fell and the King[554] himself\r\ndisappeared. Leaving Kleopatra[555] Queen of Egypt, who shortly after\r\ngave birth to a child that she had by Cæsar, which the Alexandrines\r\nnamed Cæsarion, he marched to Syria.\r\n\r\nL. From Syria continuing his march through Asia he heard that Domitius\r\nhad been defeated by Pharnakes[556] son of Mithridates, and had fled\r\nfrom Pontus with a few men; and that Pharnakes, who used his victory\r\nwithout any moderation, and was in possession of Bithynia and\r\nCappadocia, also coveted Armenia, called the Little, and was stirring\r\nup all the kings and tetrarchs in this part. Accordingly Cæsar\r\nforthwith advanced against the man with three legions and fighting a\r\ngreat battle near Zela drove Pharnakes in flight from Pontus, and\r\ncompletely destroyed his army. In reporting to one of his friends at\r\nRome, Amantius,[557] the celerity and rapidity of this battle, he\r\nwrote only three words: \"I came, I saw, I conquered.\" In the Roman\r\nlanguage the three words ending in the like form of verb, have a\r\nbrevity which is not without its effect.\r\n\r\nLI. After this, passing over to Italy he went up to Rome at the close\r\nof the year for which he had been chosen Dictator[558] the second\r\ntime, though that office had never before been for a whole year; and\r\nhe was elected consul for the following year. He was much blamed about\r\na mutiny[559] that broke out among the soldiers in which they killed\r\ntwo men of prætorian rank, Cosconius and Galba, because he reproved\r\nhis men no further than by calling them citizens instead of soldiers,\r\nand he gave to each of them a thousand drachmæ, and allotted to them\r\nmuch land in Italy. He also bore the blame of the madness of\r\nDolabella,[560] the covetousness of Amantius, and the drunkenness of\r\nAntonius, and the greedy tricks of Corfinius in getting the house of\r\nPompeius, and his building it over again as if it were not fit for\r\nhim; for the Romans were annoyed at these things. But Cæsar, in the\r\npresent state of affairs, though he was not ignorant of these things,\r\nand did not approve of them, was compelled to employ such men in his\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nLII. As Cato[561] and Scipio, after the battle near Pharsalus, had\r\nfled to Libya, and there, with the assistance of King Juba, got\r\ntogether a considerable force, Cæsar determined to go against them;\r\nand about the winter solstice passing over to Sicily and wishing to\r\ncut off from the officers about him all hopes of delay and tarrying\r\nthere, he placed his own tent on the margin of the waves,[562] and as\r\nsoon as there was a wind he went on board and set sail with three\r\nthousand foot-soldiers and a few horsemen. Having landed them\r\nunobserved he embarked again, for he was under some apprehension about\r\nthe larger part of his force; and having fallen in with it on the sea,\r\nhe conducted all to the camp. Now there was with him in the army a man\r\nin other respects contemptible enough and of no note, but of the\r\nfamily of the Africani, and his name was Scipio Sallutio;[563] and as\r\nCæsar heard that the enemy relied on a certain old oracular answer,\r\nthat it was always the privilege of the family of the Scipios to\r\nconquer in Libya, either to show his contempt of Scipio as a general\r\nby a kind of joke, or because he really wished to have the benefit of\r\nthe omen himself (it is difficult to say which), he used to place this\r\nSallutio in the front of the battles as if he were the leader of the\r\narmy; for Cæsar was often compelled to engage with the enemy and to\r\nseek a battle, there being neither sufficient supply of corn for the\r\nmen nor fodder for the animals, but they were compelled to take the\r\nsea-weed after washing off the salt and mixing a little grass with it\r\nby way of sweetening it, and so to feed their horses. For the\r\nNumidians, by continually showing themselves in great numbers and\r\nsuddenly appearing, kept possession of the country; and on one\r\noccasion while the horsemen of Cæsar were amusing themselves with a\r\nLibyan, who was exhibiting to them his skill in dancing and playing on\r\na flute at the same time in a surprising manner, and the men, pleased\r\nwith the sight, were sitting on the ground and the boys holding their\r\nhorses, the enemy suddenly coming round and falling upon them killed\r\nsome, and entered the camp together with the rest, who fled in\r\ndisorderly haste. And if Cæsar himself and Asinius Pollio had not come\r\nout of the camp to help the men, and checked the pursuit, the war\r\nwould have been at an end. In another battle, also, the enemy had the\r\nadvantage in the encounter, on which occasion it is said that Cæsar,\r\nseizing by the neck the man who bore the eagle and was running away,\r\nturned him round, and said, \"There is the enemy!\"\r\n\r\nLIII. However Scipio[564] was encouraged by these advantages to hazard\r\na decisive battle; and leaving Afranius and Juba[565] encamped each\r\nseparately at a short distance, he commenced making a fortified camp\r\nabove a lake near the city Thapsus, intending it as a place for the\r\nwhole army to sally forth from to battle and a place of refuge also.\r\nWhile he was thus employed, Cæsar with incredible speed making his way\r\nthrough woody grounds which contained certain approaches that had not\r\nbeen observed, surrounded part of the enemy and attacked others in\r\nfront. Having put these to flight he availed himself of the critical\r\nmoment and the career of fortune, by means of which he captured the\r\ncamp of Afranius on the first assault, and at the first assault also\r\nhe broke into the camp of the Numidians from which Juba fled; and in a\r\nsmall part of a single day he made himself master of three camps and\r\ndestroyed fifty thousand of the enemy without losing as many as fifty\r\nof his own men. This is the account that some writers give of that\r\nbattle; but others say that Cæsar was not in the action himself, but\r\nthat as he was marshalling and arranging his forces, he was attacked\r\nby his usual complaint, and that perceiving it as soon as it came on,\r\nand before his senses were completely confounded and overpowered by\r\nthe malady, just as he was beginning to be convulsed, he was carried\r\nto one of the neighbouring towers and stayed there quietly. Of the men\r\nof consular and prætorian rank who escaped from the battle, some\r\nkilled themselves when they were being taken, and Cæsar put many to\r\ndeath who were captured.\r\n\r\nLIV. Being ambitious to take Cato[566] alive, Cæsar hastened to Utica,\r\nfor Cato was guarding that city and was not in the battle. Hearing\r\nthat Cato had put an end to himself, Cæsar was evidently annoyed, but\r\nfor what reason is uncertain. However, he said, \"Cato, I grudge you\r\nyour death, for you also have grudged me the preservation of your\r\nlife.\" But the work which be wrote against Cato after his death cannot\r\nbe considered an indication that he was mercifully disposed towards\r\nhim or in a mood to be easily reconciled. For how can we suppose that\r\nhe would have spared Cato living, when he poured out against him after\r\nhe was dead so much indignation? However, some persons infer from his\r\nmild treatment of Cicero and Brutus and ten thousand others of his\r\nenemies that this discourse also was composed not from any enmity, but\r\nfrom political ambition, for the following reason. Cicero wrote a\r\npanegyric on Cato and gave the composition the title \"Cato\"; and the\r\ndiscourse was eagerly read by many, as one may suppose, being written\r\nby the most accomplished of orators on the noblest subject. This\r\nannoyed Cæsar, who considered the panegyric on a man whose death he\r\nhad caused to be an attack upon himself. Accordingly in his treatise\r\nhe got together many charges against Cato; and the work is entitled\r\n\"Anticato.\"[567] Both compositions have many admirers, as well on\r\naccount of Cæsar as of Cato.\r\n\r\nLV. However, on his return[568] to Rome from Libya, in the first place\r\nCæsar made a pompous harangue to the people about his victory, in\r\nwhich he said that he had conquered a country large enough to supply\r\nannually to the treasury two hundred thousand Attic medimni of corn,\r\nand three million litræ of oil. In the next place he celebrated\r\ntriumphs,[569] the Egyptian, the Pontic, and the Libyan, not of\r\ncourse for his victory over Scipio, but over Juba.[570] On that\r\noccasion Juba also, the son of King Juba, who was still an infant, was\r\nled in the triumphal procession, most fortunate in his capture, for\r\nfrom being a barbarian and a Numidian he became numbered among the\r\nmost learned of the Greek writers. After the triumphs Cæsar made large\r\npresents to the soldiers, and entertained the people with banquets and\r\nspectacles, feasting the whole population at once at twenty-two\r\nthousand triclina,[571] and exhibiting also shows of gladiators and\r\nnaval combats in honour of his daughter Julia who had been dead for\r\nsome time. After the shows a census[572] was taken, in which instead\r\nof the three hundred and twenty thousand of former enumerations, there\r\nwere enrolled only one hundred and fifty thousand. So much desolation\r\nhad the civil wars produced and so large a proportion of the people\r\nhad been destroyed in them, not to reckon the miseries that had\r\nbefallen the rest of Italy and the provinces.\r\n\r\nLVI. All this being completed, Cæsar was made consul[573] for the\r\nfourth time, and set out to Iberia to attack the sons of Pompeius, who\r\nwere still young, but had got together a force of amazing amount and\r\ndisplayed a boldness that showed they were worthy to command, so that\r\nthey put Cæsar in the greatest danger. The great battle was fought\r\nnear the city of Munda,[574] in which Cæsar, seeing that his men were\r\nbeing driven from their ground and making a feeble resistance, ran\r\nthrough the arms and the ranks calling out, \"If they had no sense of\r\nshame, to take and deliver him up to the boys.\" With difficulty and\r\nafter great exertion he put the enemy to flight and slaughtered above\r\nthirty thousand of them, but he lost a thousand of his own best\r\nsoldiers. On retiring after the battle he said to his friends, that he\r\nhad often fought for victory, but now for the first time he had fought\r\nfor existence. He gained this victory on the day of the festival of\r\nBacchus, on which day it is said that Pompeius Magnus also went out to\r\nbattle; the interval was four years. The younger of the sons[575] of\r\nPompeius escaped, but after a few days Didius[576] brought the head of\r\nthe elder. This was the last war that Cæsar was engaged in; but the\r\ntriumph[577] that was celebrated for this victory vexed the Romans\r\nmore than anything else. For this was no victory over foreign leaders\r\nnor yet over barbarian kings, but Cæsar had destroyed the children of\r\nthe bravest of the Romans, who had been unfortunate, and had\r\ncompletely ruined his family, and it was not seemly to celebrate a\r\ntriumph over the calamities of his country, exulting in these things,\r\nfor which the only apology both before gods and men was that they had\r\nbeen done of necessity; and that too when he had never before sent\r\neither messenger or public letters to announce a victory gained in the\r\ncivil wars, but had from motives of delicacy rejected all glory on\r\nthat account.\r\n\r\nLVII. However, the Romans, gave way before the fortune of the man and\r\nreceived the bit, and considering the monarchy to be a respite from\r\nthe civil wars and miseries they appointed him dictator[578] for life.\r\nThis was confessedly a tyranny, for the monarchy received in addition\r\nto its irresponsibility the character of permanency; and when\r\nCicero[579] in the Senate had proposed the highest honours[580] to\r\nhim, which though great were still such as were befitting a human\r\nbeing, others by adding still further honours and vying with one\r\nanother made Cæsar odious and an object of dislike even to those who\r\nwere of the most moderate temper, by reason of the extravagant and\r\nunusual character of what was decreed; and it is supposed that those\r\nwho hated Cæsar cooperated in these measures no less than those who\r\nwere his flatterers, that they might have as many pretexts as possible\r\nagainst him and might be considered to make their attempt upon him\r\nwith the best ground of complaint. For in all other respects, after\r\nthe close of the civil wars, he showed himself blameless; and it was\r\nnot without good reason that the Romans voted a temple to Clemency to\r\ncommemorate his moderate measures. For he pardoned many of those who\r\nhad fought against him, and to some he even gave offices and honours,\r\nas to Brutus and Cassius, both of whom were Prætors. He also did not\r\nallow the statues of Pompeius to remain thrown down, but he set them\r\nup again, on which Cicero said that by erecting the statues of\r\nPompeius, Cæsar had firmly fixed his own. When his friends urged him\r\nto have guards and many offered their services for this purpose, he\r\nwould not consent, and he said, that it was better to die at once than\r\nto be always expecting death. But for the purpose of surrounding\r\nhimself with the affection of the Romans as the noblest and also the\r\nsecurest protection, he again courted the people with banquets and\r\ndistribution of corn, and the soldiers with the foundation of\r\ncolonies, of which the most conspicuous were Carthage[581] and\r\nCorinth, to both of which it happened that their former capture and\r\ntheir present restoration occurred at once and at the same time.\r\n\r\nLVIII. To some of the nobles he promised consulships and prætorships\r\nfor the future, and others he pacified with certain other offices and\r\nhonours, and he gave hopes to all, seeking to make it appear that he\r\nruled over them with their own consent, so that when Maximus[582] the\r\nconsul died, he appointed Caninius Revilius consul for the one day\r\nthat still remained of the term of office. When many persons were\r\ngoing, as was usual, to salute the new consul and to form part of his\r\ntrain Cicero said, \"We must make haste, or the man will have gone out\r\nof office.\" Cæsar's great success did not divert his natural\r\ninclination for great deeds and his ambition to the enjoyment of that\r\nfor which he had laboured, but serving as fuel and incentives to the\r\nfuture bred in him designs of greater things and love of new glory, as\r\nif he had used up what he had already acquired; and the passion was\r\nnothing else than emulation of himself as if he were another person,\r\nand a kind of rivalry between what he intended and what he had\r\naccomplished; and his propositions and designs were to march against\r\nthe Parthians,[583] and after subduing them and marching through\r\nHyrkania and along the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus, and so\r\nencompassing the Euxine, to invade Scythia, and after having overrun\r\nthe countries bordering on the Germans and Germany itself to return\r\nthrough Gaul to Italy, and so to complete his circle of the empire\r\nwhich would be bounded on all sides by the ocean. During this\r\nexpedition he intended also to dig through the Corinthian\r\nIsthmus,[584] and he had already commissioned Anienus to superintend\r\nthe work; and to receive the Tiber[585] immediately below the city in\r\na deep cut, and giving it a bend towards Circæum to make it enter the\r\nsea by Tarracina, with the view of giving security and facility to\r\nthose who came to Rome for the purpose of trade: besides this he\r\ndesigned to draw off the water from the marshes about Pomentium and\r\nSetia,[586] and to make them solid ground, which would employ many\r\nthousands of men in the cultivation; and where the sea was nearest to\r\nRome he designed to place barriers to it by means of moles, and after\r\nclearing away the hidden rocks and dangerous places on the shore of\r\nOstia[587] to make harbours and naval stations which should give\r\nsecurity to the extensive shipping. And all these things were in\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\nLIX. But the arrangement of the Kalendar[588] and the correction of\r\nthe irregularity in the reckoning of time were handled by him\r\nskilfully, and being completed were of the most varied utility. For it\r\nwas not only in very ancient times that the Romans had the periods of\r\nthe moon in confusion with respect to the year, so that the feasts and\r\nfestivals gradually changing at last fell out in opposite seasons of\r\nthe year, but even with respect to the solar year at that time nobody\r\nkept any reckoning except the priests, who, as they alone knew the\r\nproper time, all of a sudden and when nobody expected it, would insert\r\nthe intercalary month named Mercedonius, which King Numa is said to\r\nhave been the first to intercalate, thereby devising a remedy, which\r\nwas slight and would extend to no great period, for the irregularity\r\nin the recurrence of the times, as I have explained in the Life of\r\nNuma. But Cæsar laying the problem before the ablest philosophers and\r\nmathematicians, from the methods that were laid before him compounded\r\na correction of his own which was more exact, which the Romans use to\r\nthe present time, and are considered to be in less error than other\r\nnations as to the inequality. However, even this furnished matter for\r\ncomplaint to those who envied him and disliked his power; for Cicero,\r\nthe orator, as it is said, when some observed that Lyra would rise\r\nto-morrow, \"Yes,\" he replied, \"pursuant to the Edict,\" meaning that\r\nmen admitted even this by compulsion.\r\n\r\nLX. But the most manifest and deadly hatred towards him was produced\r\nby his desire of kingly power, which to the many was the first, and to\r\nthose who had long nourished a secret hatred of him the most specious,\r\ncause. And indeed those who were contriving this honour for Cæsar\r\nspread about a certain report among the people, that according to the\r\nSibylline writings[589] it appeared that Parthia could be conquered by\r\nthe Romans if they advanced against it with a king, but otherwise\r\ncould not he assailed. And as Cæsar was going down from Alba to the\r\ncity, they ventured to salute him as King, but as the people showed\r\ntheir dissatisfaction, Cæsar was disturbed and said that he was not\r\ncalled King but Cæsar; and as hereupon there was a general silence, he\r\npassed along with no great cheerfulness nor good humour on his\r\ncountenance. When some extravagant honours had been decreed to him in\r\nthe Senate, it happened that he was sitting above the Rostra,[590] and\r\nwhen the consuls and prætors approached with all the Senate behind\r\nthem, without rising from his seat, but just as if he were transacting\r\nbusiness with private persons, he answered that the honours required\r\nrather to be contracted than enlarged. This annoyed not the Senate\r\nonly, but the people also, who considered that the State was insulted\r\nin the persons of the Senate; and those who were not obliged to stay\r\nwent away forthwith with countenance greatly downcast, so that Cæsar\r\nperceiving it forthwith went home, and as he threw his cloak from his\r\nshoulders he called out to his friends, that he was ready to offer his\r\nthroat to anyone who wished to kill him; but afterwards he alleged his\r\ndisease as an excuse for his behaviour, saying that persons who are so\r\naffected cannot usually keep their senses steady when they address a\r\nmultitude standing, but that the senses being speedily convulsed and\r\nwhirling about bring on giddiness and are overpowered. However, the\r\nfact was not so, for it is said that he was very desirous to rise up\r\nwhen the Senate came, but was checked by one of his friends, or rather\r\none of his flatterers, Cornelius Balbus,[591] who said, \"Will you not\r\nremember that you are Cæsar, and will you not allow yourself to be\r\nhonoured as a superior?\"\r\n\r\nLXI. There was added to these causes of offence the insult offered to\r\nthe tribunes. It was the festival of the Lupercalia,[592] about which\r\nmany writers say that it was originally a festival of the shepherds\r\nand had also some relationship to the Arcadian Lykæa. On this occasion\r\nmany of the young nobles and magistrates run through the city without\r\ntheir toga, and for sport and to make laughter strike those whom they\r\nmeet with strips of hide that have the hair on; many women of rank\r\nalso purposely put themselves in the way and present their hands to be\r\nstruck like children at school, being persuaded that this is\r\nfavourable to easy parturition for those who are pregnant, and to\r\nconception for those who are barren. Cæsar was a spectator, being\r\nseated at the Rostra on a golden chair in a triumphal robe; and\r\nAntonius was one of those who ran in the sacred race, for he was\r\nconsul. Accordingly, when he entered the Forum and the crowd made way\r\nfor him, he presented to Cæsar a diadem[593] which he carried\r\nsurrounded with a crown of bay; and there was a clapping of hands,\r\nnot loud, but slight, which had been already concerted. When Cæsar put\r\naway the diadem from him all the people clapped their hands, and when\r\nAntonius presented it again, only a few clapped; but when Cæsar\r\ndeclined to receive it, again all the people applauded. The experiment\r\nhaving thus failed, Cæsar rose and ordered the crown to be carried to\r\nthe Capitol. But as Cæsar's statues were seen crowned with royal\r\ndiadems, two of the tribunes, Flavius and Marullus, went up to them\r\nand pulled off the diadems, and having discovered those who had been\r\nthe first to salute Cæsar as king they led them off to prison. The\r\npeople followed clapping their hands and calling the tribunes Bruti,\r\nbecause it was Brutus who put down the kingly power and placed the\r\nsovereignty in the Senate and people instead of its being in the hands\r\nof one man. Cæsar being irritated at this deprived Flavius and\r\nMarullus of their office, and while rating them he also insulted the\r\npeople by frequently calling the tribunes Bruti and Cumæi.[594] LXII.\r\nIn this state of affairs the many turned to Marcus Brutus,[595] who on\r\nhis father's side was considered to be a descendant of the ancient\r\nBrutus, and on his mother's side belonged to the Servilii, another\r\ndistinguished house, and he was the son-in-law and nephew of Cato. The\r\nhonours and favours which Brutus had received from Cæsar dulled him\r\ntowards attempting of his own proper motion the overthrow of the\r\nmonarchical power; for not only was his life saved at the battle of\r\nPharsalus after the rout of Pompeius, and many of his friends also at\r\nhis entreaty, but besides this he had great credit with Cæsar. He had\r\nalso received among those who then held the prætorship[596] the chief\r\noffice, and he was to be consul in the fourth year from that time,\r\nhaving been preferred to Cassius who was a rival candidate. For it is\r\nsaid that Cæsar observed that Cassius urged better grounds of\r\npreference, but that he could not pass over Brutus. And on one\r\noccasion when some persons were calumniating Brutus to him, at a time\r\nwhen the conspiracy was really forming, he would not listen to them,\r\nbut touching his body with his hand he said to the accusers, \"Brutus\r\nwaits[597] for this dry skin,\" by which he intended to signify that\r\nBrutus was worthy of the power for his merits, but for the sake of the\r\npower would not be ungrateful and a villain. Now, those who were eager\r\nfor the change and who looked up to him alone, or him as the chief\r\nperson, did not venture to speak with him on the subject, but by night\r\nthey used to fill the tribunal and the seat on which he sat when\r\ndischarging his functions as prætor with writings, most of which were\r\nto this purport, \"You are asleep, Brutus,\" and \"You are not Brutus.\"\r\nBy which Cassius,[598] perceiving that his ambition was somewhat\r\nstirred, urged him more than he had done before, and pricked him on;\r\nand Cassius himself had also a private grudge against Cæsar for the\r\nreasons which I have mentioned in the Life of Brutus. Indeed Cæsar\r\nsuspected Cassius, and he once said to his friends, \"What think ye is\r\nCassius aiming at? for my part, I like him not over much, for he is\r\nover pale.\" On the other hand it is said that when a rumour reached\r\nhim, that Antonius and Dolabella were plotting, he said, \"I am not\r\nmuch afraid of these well-fed,[599] long-haired fellows, but I rather\r\nfear those others, the pale and thin,\" meaning Cassius and Brutus.\r\n\r\nLXIII. But it appears that destiny is not so much a thing that gives\r\nno warning as a thing that cannot be avoided, for they say that\r\nwondrous signs and appearances presented themselves. Now, as to lights\r\nin the skies and sounds by night moving in various directions and\r\nsolitary birds descending into the Forum, it is perhaps not worth\r\nwhile recording these with reference to so important an event: but\r\nStrabo[600] the Philosopher relates that many men all of fire were\r\nseen contending against one another, and that a soldier's slave\r\nemitted a great flame from his hand and appeared to the spectators to\r\nbe burning, but when the flame went out, the man had sustained no\r\nharm; and while Cæsar himself was sacrificing the heart of the victim\r\ncould not be found, and this was considered a bad omen, for naturally\r\nan animal without a heart cannot exist. The following stories also are\r\ntold by many; that a certain seer warned him to be on his guard\r\nagainst great danger on that day of the month of March, which the\r\nRomans call the Ides;[601] and when the day had arrived, as Cæsar was\r\ngoing to the Senate-house, he saluted the seer and jeered him saying,\r\n\"Well, the Ides of March are come;\" but the seer mildly replied, \"Yes,\r\nthey are come, but they are not yet over.\" The day before, when Marcus\r\nLepidus was entertaining him, he chanced to be signing some letters,\r\naccording to his habit, while he was reclining at table; and the\r\nconversation having turned on what kind of death was the best, before\r\nany one could give an opinion he called out, \"That which is\r\nunexpected!\" After this, while he was sleeping, as he was accustomed\r\nto do, by the side of his wife, all the doors and windows in the house\r\nflew open at once, and being startled by the noise and the brightness\r\nof the moon which was shining down upon him, he observed that\r\nCalpurnia[602] was in a deep slumber, but was uttering indistinct\r\nwords and inarticulate groans in the midst of her sleep; and indeed\r\nshe was dreaming that she held her murdered husband in her arms and\r\nwas weeping over him. Others say this was not the vision that\r\nCalpurnia had, but the following: there was attached to Cæsar's house\r\nby way of ornament and distinction pursuant to a vote of the Senate an\r\nacroterium,[603] as Livius says, and Calpurnia in her dream seeing\r\nthis tumbling down lamented and wept. When day came accordingly she\r\nentreated Cæsar, if it were possible, not to go out, and to put off\r\nthe meeting of the Senate; but if he paid no regard to her dreams, she\r\nurged him to inquire by other modes of divination and by sacrifices\r\nabout the future. Cæsar also, as it seems, had some suspicion and\r\nfear; for he had never before detected in Calpurnia any womanish\r\nsuperstition, and now he saw that she was much disturbed. And when the\r\nseers also after sacrificing many victims reported to him that the\r\nomens were unfavourable, he determined to send Antonius to dismiss the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nLXIV. In the mean time Decimus Brutus,[604] surnamed Albinus, who was\r\nin such favour with Cæsar that he was made in his will his second\r\nheir,[605] but was engaged in the conspiracy with the other Brutus and\r\nCassius, being afraid that if Cæsar escaped that day, the affair might\r\nbecome known, ridiculed the seers and chided Cæsar for giving cause\r\nfor blame and censure to the Senate who would consider themselves\r\ninsulted: he said, \"That the Senate had met at his bidding and that\r\nthey were all ready to pass a decree, that he should be proclaimed\r\nKing of the provinces out of Italy and should wear a diadem whenever\r\nhe visited the rest of the earth and sea; but if any one shall tell\r\nthem when they are taking their seats, to be gone now and to come\r\nagain, when Calpurnia shall have had better dreams, what may we not\r\nexpect to be said by those who envy you? or who will listen to your\r\nfriends when they say that this is not slavery and tyranny; but if,\"\r\nhe continued, \"you are fully resolved to consider the day\r\ninauspicious, it is better for you to go yourself and address the\r\nSenate and then to adjourn the business.\" As he said this, Brutus took\r\nCæsar by the hand and began to lead him forth: and he had gone but a\r\nlittle way from the door, when a slave belonging to another person,\r\nwho was eager to get at Cæsar but was prevented by the press and\r\nnumbers about him, rushing into the house delivered himself up to\r\nCalpurnia and told her to keep him till Cæsar returned, for he had\r\nimportant things to communicate to him.\r\n\r\nLXV. Artemidorus,[606] a Knidian by birth, and a professor of Greek\r\nphilosophy, which had brought him into the familiarity of some of\r\nthose who belonged to the party of Brutus, so that he knew the greater\r\npart of what was going on, came and brought in a small roll the\r\ninformation which he intended to communicate; but observing that Cæsar\r\ngave each roll as he received it to the attendants about him, he came\r\nvery near, and said, \"This you alone should read, Cæsar, and read it\r\nsoon; for it is about weighty matters which concern you.\" Accordingly\r\nCæsar received the roll, but he was prevented from reading it by the\r\nnumber of people who came in his way, though he made several attempts,\r\nand he entered the Senate holding that roll in his hand and retaining\r\nthat alone among all that had been presented to him. Some say that it\r\nwas another person who gave him this roll, and that Artemidorus did\r\nnot even approach him, but was kept from him all the way by the\r\npressure of the crowd.\r\n\r\nLXVI. Now these things perchance may be brought about by mere\r\nspontaneity; but the spot that was the scene of that murder and\r\nstruggle, wherein the Senate was then assembled, which contained the\r\nstatue of Pompeius[607] and was a dedication by Pompeius and one of\r\nthe ornaments that he added to his theatre, completely proved that it\r\nwas the work of some dæmon to guide and call the execution of the deed\r\nto that place. It is said also that Cassius[608] looked towards the\r\nstatue of Pompeius before the deed was begun and silently invoked it,\r\nthough he was not averse to the philosophy of Epikurus; but the\r\ncritical moment for the bold attempt which was now come probably\r\nproduced in him enthusiasm and feeling in place of his former\r\nprinciples. Now Antonius,[609] who was faithful to Cæsar and a robust\r\nman, was kept on the outside by Brutus Albinus, who purposely engaged\r\nhim in a long conversation. When Cæsar entered, the Senate rose to do\r\nhim honour, and some of the party of Brutus stood around his chair at\r\nthe back, and others presented themselves before him, as if their\r\npurpose was to support the prayer of Tillius Cimber[610] on behalf of\r\nhis exiled brother, and they all joined in entreaty, following Cæsar\r\nas far as his seat. When he had taken his seat and was rejecting their\r\nentreaties, and, as they urged them still more strongly, began to show\r\ndispleasure towards them individually, Tillius taking hold of his toga\r\nwith both his hands pulled it downwards from the neck, which was the\r\nsignal for the attack. Casca[611] was the first to strike him on the\r\nneck with his sword, a blow neither mortal nor severe, for as was\r\nnatural at the beginning of so bold a deed he was confused, and Cæsar\r\nturning round seized the dagger and held it fast. And it happened that\r\nat the same moment he who was struck cried out in the Roman language,\r\n\"You villain, Casca, what are you doing?\" and he who had given the\r\nblow cried out to his brother in Greek, \"Brother, help.\" Such being\r\nthe beginning, those who were not privy to the conspiracy were\r\nprevented by consternation and horror at what was going on either from\r\nflying or going to aid, and they did not even venture to utter a word.\r\nAnd now each of the conspirators bared his sword, and Cæsar, being\r\nhemmed in all round, in whatever direction he turned meeting blows and\r\nswords aimed against his eyes and face, driven about like a wild\r\nbeast, was caught in the hands of his enemies; for it was arranged\r\nthat all of them should take a part in and taste of the deed of blood.\r\nAccordingly Brutus[612] also gave him one blow in the groin. It is\r\nsaid by some authorities, that he defended himself against the rest,\r\nmoving about his body hither and thither and calling out, till he saw\r\nthat Brutus had drawn his sword, when he pulled his toga over his face\r\nand offered no further resistance, having been driven either by chance\r\nor by the conspirators to the base on which the statue of Pompeius\r\nstood. And the base was drenched with blood, as if Pompeius was\r\ndirecting the vengeance upon his enemy who was stretched beneath his\r\nfeet and writhing under his many wounds; for he is said to have\r\nreceived three and twenty wounds. Many of the conspirators were\r\nwounded by one another, while they were aiming so many blows against\r\none body.\r\n\r\nLXVII. After Cæsar was killed, though Brutus came forward as if he was\r\ngoing to say something about the deed, the Senators,[613] without\r\nwaiting to listen, rushed through the door and making their escape\r\nfilled the people with confusion and indescribable alarm, so that some\r\nclosed their houses, and others left their tables and places of\r\nbusiness, and while some ran to the place to see what had happened,\r\nothers who had seen it ran away. But Antonius and Lepidus,[614] who\r\nwere the chief friends of Cæsar, stole away and fled for refuge to\r\nthe houses of other persons. The partizans of Brutus, just as they\r\nwere, warm from the slaughter, and showing their bare swords, advanced\r\nall in a body from the Senate-house to the Capitol, not like men who\r\nwere flying, but exultant and confident, calling the people to liberty\r\nand joined by the nobles who met them. Some even went up to the\r\nCapitol with them and mingled with them as if they had participated in\r\nthe deed, and claimed the credit of it, among whom were Caius Octavius\r\nand Lentulus Spinther.[615] But they afterwards paid the penalty of\r\ntheir vanity, for they were put to death by Antonius and the young\r\nCæsar, without having enjoyed even the reputation of that for which\r\nthey lost their lives, for nobody believed that they had a share in\r\nthe deed. For neither did those who put them to death, punish them for\r\nwhat they did, but for what they wished to do. On the next day Brutus\r\ncame down and addressed the people, who listened without expressing\r\ndisapprobation or approbation of what had been done, but they\r\nindicated by their deep silence that they pitied Cæsar and respected\r\nBrutus. The Senate, with the view of making an amnesty and\r\nconciliating all parties, decreed that Cæsar should be honoured as a\r\ngod and that not the smallest thing should be disturbed which he had\r\nsettled while he was in power; and they distributed among the\r\npartisans of Brutus provinces and suitable honours, so that all people\r\nsupposed that affairs were quieted and had been settled in the best\r\nway.\r\n\r\nLXVIII. But when the will[616] of Cæsar was opened and it was\r\ndiscovered that he had given to every Roman a handsome present, and\r\nthey saw the body, as it was carried through the Forum, disfigured\r\nwith the wounds, the multitude, no longer kept within the bounds of\r\npropriety and order, but heaping about the corpse benches, lattices\r\nand tables taken from the Forum, they set fire to it on the spot and\r\nburnt it; then taking the flaming pieces of wood they ran to the\r\nhouses of the conspirators to fire them, and others ran about the city\r\nin all directions seeking for the men to seize and tear them in\r\npieces. But none of the conspirators came in their way, and they were\r\nall well protected. One Cinna,[617] however, a friend of Cæsar,\r\nhappened, as it is said, to have had a strange dream the night\r\nbefore; for he dreamed that he was invited by Cæsar to sup with him,\r\nand when he excused himself, he was dragged along by Cæsar by the\r\nhand, against his will and making resistance the while. Now, when he\r\nheard that the body of Cæsar was burning in the Forum, he got up and\r\nwent there out of respect, though he was somewhat alarmed at his dream\r\nand had a fever on him. One of the multitude who saw Cinna told his\r\nname to another who was inquiring of him, and he again told it to a\r\nthird, and immediately it spread through the crowd that this man was\r\none of those who had killed Cæsar; and indeed there was one of the\r\nconspirators who was named Cinna: and taking this man to be him the\r\npeople forthwith rushed upon him and tore him in pieces on the spot.\r\nIt was principally through alarm at this that the partisans of Brutus\r\nand Cassius after a few days left the city. But what they did and\r\nsuffered before they died is told in the Life of Brutus.[618] LXIX. At\r\nthe time of his death Cæsar was full fifty-six years old, having\r\nsurvived Pompeius not much more than four years, and of the power and\r\ndominion which all through his life he pursued at so great risk and\r\nbarely got at last, having reaped the fruit in name only, and with the\r\nglory of it the odium of the citizens. Yet his great dæmon,[619] which\r\naccompanied him through life, followed him even when he was dead, the\r\navenger of his murder, through every land and sea hunting and tracking\r\nout his murderers till not one of them was left, and pursuing even\r\nthose who in any way whatever had either put their hand to the deed or\r\nbeen participators in the plot. Among human events the strangest was\r\nthat which befell Cassius, for after his defeat at Philippi he killed\r\nhimself with the same dagger that he had employed against Cæsar; and\r\namong signs from heaven, there was the great comet, which appeared\r\nconspicuous for seven nights after Cæsar's assassination and then\r\ndisappeared, and the obscuration of the splendour of the sun. For\r\nduring all that year the circle of the sun rose pale and without rays,\r\nand the warmth that came down from it was weak and feeble, so that the\r\nair as it moved was dark and heavy owing to the feebleness of the\r\nwarmth which penetrated it, and the fruits withered and fell off when\r\nthey were half ripened and imperfect on account of the coldness of the\r\natmosphere. But chief of all, the phantom that appeared to Brutus\r\nshowed that Cæsar's murder was not pleasing to the gods; and it was\r\nafter this manner. When Brutus was going to take his army over from\r\nAbydus[620] to the other continent, he was lying down by night, as his\r\nwont was, in his tent, not asleep, but thinking about the future; for\r\nit is said that Brutus of all generals was least given to sleep, and\r\nhad naturally the power of keeping awake longer than any other person.\r\nThinking that he heard a noise near the door, he looked towards the\r\nlight of the lamp which was already sinking down, and saw a frightful\r\nvision of a man of unusual size and savage countenance. At first he\r\nwas startled, but observing that the figure neither moved nor spoke,\r\nbut was standing silent by the bed, he asked him who he was. The\r\nphantom replied, \"Thy bad dæmon, Brutus; and thou shalt see me at\r\nPhilippi.\" Upon which Brutus boldly replied, \"I shall see;\" and the\r\ndæmon immediately disappeared. In course of time having engaged with\r\nAntonius and Cæsar at Philippi, in the first battle he was victorious,\r\nand after routing that part of the army which was opposed to him he\r\nfollowed up his success and plundered Cæsar's camp. As he was\r\npreparing to fight the second battle, the same phantom appeared again\r\nby night, without speaking to him, but Brutus, who perceived what his\r\nfate was, threw himself headlong into the midst of the danger. However\r\nhe did not fall in the battle, but when the rout took place, he fled\r\nto a precipitous spot, and throwing himself with his breast on his\r\nbare sword, a friend also, as it is said, giving strength to the blow,\r\nhe died.[621] FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 435: It has been remarked by Niebuhr (_Lectures on the\r\nHistory of Rome_, ii. 33) that the beginning of the Life of Cæsar is\r\nlost. He says, \"Plutarch could not have passed over the ancestors, the\r\nfather, and the whole family, together with the history of Cæsar's\r\nyouth, &c.\" But the reasons for this opinion are not conclusive. The\r\nsame reason would make us consider other lives imperfect, which are\r\nalso deficient in such matters. Plutarch, after his fashion, gives\r\nincidental information about Cæsar's youth and his family. I conceive\r\nthat he purposely avoided a formal beginning; and according to his\r\nplan of biography, he was right. Niebuhr also observes that the\r\nbeginning of the Life of Cæsar in Suetonius is imperfect; \"a fact well\r\nknown, but it is only since the year 1812, that we know that the part\r\nwhich is wanting contained a dedication to the præfectus prætorio of\r\nthe time, a fact which has not yet found its way into any history of\r\nRoman Literature.\" It is an old opinion that the Life of Cæsar in\r\nSuetonius is imperfect. The fact that the dedication alone is wanting,\r\nfor so Niebuhr appears to mean, shows that the Life is not incomplete,\r\nand there is no reason for thinking that it is.\r\n\r\nC. Julius Cæsar, the son of C. Julius Cæsar and Aurelia, was born on\r\nthe twelfth of July, B.C. 100, in the sixth consulship of his uncle C.\r\nMarius. His father, who had been prætor, died suddenly at Pisa when\r\nhis son was in his sixteenth year.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 436: See the Life of Pompeius, c. 9, and notes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 437: Cæsar was first betrothed to Cossutia, the daughter of\r\na rich Roman Eques, but he broke off the marriage contract, and\r\nmarried Cornelia, B.C. 83.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 438: A different story is told by Suetonius (_Cæsar_, c. 1),\r\nand Velleius Paterculus (ii. 43).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 439: Cornelius Phagita (Suetonius, c. 1, 74.)

Suetonius, a lover of scandal, has\r\npreserved a grievous imputation against Cæsar, which is connected with\r\nthis visit to Nicomedes (_Cæsar_, c. 2, 49). Cæsar in a speech for the\r\nBithynians (Gellius, v. 13) calls Nicomedes his friend. He felt the\r\nreproach keenly, and tried to clear himself (Dion Cassius, 43, c. 20).\r\nBut it is easier to make such charges than to confute them.\r\n\r\nM. Minucius Thermus, Proprætor.

Cæsar was already a\r\nPontifex, but the acquisition of the post of Pontifex Maximus, which\r\nplaces him at the head of religion, was an object of ambition to him\r\nin his present position. The office was for life, it brought him an\r\nofficial residence in the Via Sacra, and increased political\r\ninfluence.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 460: The conspiracy of Catiline happened B.C. 63, when\r\nCicero was consul. See the Life of Cicero, c. 10, &c. Sallustius\r\n(_Catilina_, c. 51, &c.) has given the speeches of Cæsar and Cato in\r\nthe debate upon the fate of the conspirators who had been seized. If\r\nwe have not the words of Cæsar, there is no reason for supposing that\r\nwe have not the substance of his speech. Whatever might be Cæsar's\r\nobject, his proposal was consistent with law and a fair trial. The\r\nexecution of the conspirators was a violent and illegal measure.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 461: This circumstance is mentioned by Sallustius\r\n(_Catilina_, 49), apparently as having happened when Cæsar was leaving\r\nthe Senate, after one of the debates previous to that on which it was\r\ndetermined to put the conspirators to death. Sallustius mentions\r\nCatulus and C. Piso as the instigators. He also observes that they had\r\ntried to prevail on Cicero to criminate Cæsar by false testimony.

Cæsar was then rising in power, and Cicero was humbled. It would\r\nbe as well for him to say nothing on this matter which Plutarch\r\nalludes to (_Ad Attic._ ii. 1).\r\n\r\nCicero wrote first a prose work on his consulship in Greek (_Ad\r\nAttic._ i. 19), and also a poem in three books in Latin hexameters\r\n(_Ad Attic._ ii. 3).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 464: Attic drachmæ, as usual with Plutarch, when he omits\r\nthe denomination of the money. In his Life of Cato (c. 26) Plutarch\r\nestimates the sum at 1250 talents. This impolitic measure of Cato\r\ntended to increase an evil that had long been growing in Rome, the\r\nexistence of a large body of poor who looked to the public treasury\r\nfor part of their maintenance. (See the note on the Life of Caius\r\nGracchus, c. 5.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 465: Cæsar was Prætor B.C. 62. He was Prætor designatus in\r\nDecember B.C. 63, when he delivered his speech on the punishment of\r\nCatiline's associates.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 466: Some notice of this man is contained in the Life of\r\nLucullus, c. 34, 38, and the Life of Cicero, c. 29. The affair of the\r\nBona Dea, which made a great noise in Rome, is told very fully in\r\nCicero's letters to Atticus (i. 12, &c.), which were written at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe feast of the Bona Dea was celebrated on the first of May, in the\r\nhouse of the Consul or of the Prætor Urbanus. There is some further\r\ninformation about it in Plutarch's Romanæ Quæstiones (ed. Wyttenbach,\r\nvol. ii.). According to Cicero (_De Haruspicum Responsis_, c. 17), the\r\nreal name of the goddess was unknown to the men; and Dacier considers\r\nit much to the credit of the Roman ladies that they kept the secret so\r\nwell. For this ingenious remark I am indebted to Kaltwasser's citation\r\nof Dacier; I have not had curiosity enough to look at Dacier's notes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 467: The divorce of Pompeia is mentioned by Cicero (_Ad\r\nAttic._ i. 13).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 468: Clodius was tried B.C. 61, and acquitted by a corrupt\r\njury (judices). (See Cicero, _Ad Attic._ i. 16.) Kaltwasser appears to\r\nme to have mistaken this passage. The judices voted by ballot, which\r\nhad been the practice in Rome in such trials since the passing of the\r\nLex Cassia B.C. 137. Drumanu remarks (_Geschichte Roms_, Claudii, p.\r\n214, note) that Plutarch has confounded the various parts of the\r\nprocedure at the trial; and it may be so. See the Life of Cicero, c.\r\n29. There is a dispute as to the meaning of the term Judicia Populi,\r\nto which kind of Judicia the Lex Cassia applied. (Orelli,\r\n_Onomasticon_, Index Legum, p. 279.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 469: Cæsar was Prætor (B.C. 60) of Hispania Ulterior or\r\nBætica, which included Lusitania.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 470: A similar story is told by Suetonius (_Cæsar_, 7) and\r\nDion Cassius (37. c. 52), but they assign it to the time of Cæsar's\r\nquæstorship in Spain.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 471: The Calaici, or Callaici, or Gallæci, occupied that\r\npart of the Spanish peninsula which extended from the Douro north and\r\nnorth-west to the Atlantic. (Strabo, p. 152.) The name still exists in\r\nthe modern term Gallica. D. Junius Brutus, consul B.C. 138, and the\r\ngrandfather of one of Cæsar's murderers, triumphed over the Callaici\r\nand Lusitani, and obtained the name Callaicus. The transactions of\r\nCæsar in Lusitania are recorded by Dion Cassius (37. c. 52).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 472: Many of the creditors were probably Romans. (Velleius\r\nPat. ii 43, and the Life of Lucullus, c. 7.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 473: Cæsar was consul B.C. 59.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 474: The measure was for the distribution of Public land\r\n(Dion Cassius, 38. c. 1, &c. &c.) and it was an Agrarian Law. The law\r\ncomprehended also the land about Capua (Campanus ager). Twenty\r\nthousand Roman citizens were settled on the allotted lands (Vell.\r\nPater, ii. 44; Appianus, _Civil Wars_, ii. 10). Cicero, who was\r\nwriting to Atticus at the time, mentions this division of the lands as\r\nan impolitic measure. It left the Romans without any source of public\r\nincome in Italy except the Vicesimæ (_Ad Attic._ ii. 16, 18).\r\n\r\nThe Romans, who were fond of jokes and pasquinades against those who\r\nwere in power, used to call the consulship of Cæsar, the consulship of\r\nCaius Cæsar and Julius Cæsar, in allusion to the inactivity of\r\nBibulus, who could not resist his bolder colleague's measures.

Cicero says the\r\nsame (_Pro Sestio_, c. 18). Cæsar, according to Dion, was not in\r\nfavour of the penalties contained in the bill; but he probably did not\r\nexert himself to save Cicero. Pompeius, who had presided at the\r\ncomitia in which Clodius was adrogated into a Plebeian family, in\r\norder to qualify him to be a tribune, treated Cicero with neglect\r\n(Life of Pompeius, c. 46). Cæsar owed Cicero nothing. Pompeius owed\r\nhim much. And Cicero deserved his punishment.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 478: Cæsar's Gallic campaign began B.C. 58.\r\n\r\nHe carried on the war actively for eight years, till the close of B.C.\r\n51. But he was still proconsul of Gallia in the year B.C. 50. Plutarch\r\nhas not attempted a regular narrative of Cæsar's campaigns, which\r\nwould have been foreign to his purpose (see the Life of Alexander, c.\r\n1); nor can it be attempted in these notes. The great commander has\r\nleft in his Commentary on the Gallic War an imperishable record of his\r\nsubjugation of Gaul.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 479: Plutarch here, after his fashion, throws in a few\r\nanecdotes without any regard to the chronological order.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 480: Massalia, an ancient Greek settlement, now Marseilles,\r\nwas called Massilia by the Romans. The siege of Massalia is told by\r\nCæsar (_Civil War_, ii. 1, &c.). It took place after Pompeius had fled\r\nfrom Brundisium.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 481: The story of Scæva is told by Cæsar (_Civil War_, iii.\r\n53). The missiles were arrows. As to the exact number of arrows that\r\nthe brave centurion Scæva received in his shield, see the note in\r\nOudendorp's Cæsar. Scæva was promoted to the first class of centurions\r\n(Suetonius. _Cæsar_, 68).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 482: Cordoba or Cordova in Hispania Bætica.

But Kaltwasser is\r\nmistaken.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 484: See the Life of Pompeius, c. 10.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Gellius (xvii. 9) there was extant a collection of\r\nCæsar's letters to C. Oppius and Cornelius Balbus, written in a kind\r\nof cipher. (See Suetonius, _Cæsar_, 56.) Two letters of Cæsar to\r\nOppius and Balbus are extant in the collection of Cicero's letters\r\n(_Ad Atticum_, ix. 8, 16), both expressed with admirable brevity and\r\nclearness. One of them also shows his good sense and his humanity.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 485: The story is also told by Suetonius (_Cæsar_, 54).\r\nInstead of using plain oil, Leo thought he should please his guests by\r\nmixing it with a fragrant oil (conditum oleum pro viridi). He was an\r\nill-bred fellow for his pains; but a well-bred man would affect not to\r\nnotice his blunder.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 486: This campaign belongs to B.C. 58. The Helvetii occupied\r\nthe country between the Rhine, the Jura, the Rhone, and the Rhætian\r\nAlps. The history of the campaign is given by Cæsar (_Gallic War_, i.\r\n2-29; Dion Cassius, 38, c. 31). The Arar is the Saone, which joins the\r\nRhone at Lyons.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 487: This German chief had been acknowledged as king and\r\nally (rex et amicus) during Cæsar's consulship, B.C. 59. What\r\nterritory the Romans considered as belonging to his kingdom does not\r\nappear. The campaign with Ariovistus and the circumstances which\r\npreceded it are told by Cæsar (_Gallic War_, i. 31, &c.).\r\n\r\nThe speech of Cæsar in which he rated the men for their cowardice is\r\nreported by himself (_Gallic War_, i. 40). The pursuit of the Germans\r\nwas continued for five miles according to the MSS. of Cæsar; but some\r\neditors in place of 'five' have put 'fifty.' Plutarch's 400 stadia are\r\nequal to 50 Roman miles.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 488: Cæsar (_Gallic War_, i. 54). The army wintered in the\r\ncountry between the Jura, the Rhone and Saone, and the Rhine; which\r\nwas the country of the Sequani. Cæsar says that he went into Citerior\r\nGallia, that is, North Italy, 'ad conventus agendos,' to make his\r\ncircuits for the administration of justice and other civil business.\r\nHe may be excused for not saying anything of his political intrigues.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 489: The rising of the Belgæ is the subject of Cæsar's\r\nSecond Book. This campaign was in B.C. 57. It was not a rebellion of\r\nthe Belgæ, for they had not been conquered, but they feared that the\r\nRomans would attack them after completing the subjugation of the\r\nGalli. The Belgæ were defeated on the Axona, the Aisne, a branch of\r\nthe Seine (_Gallic War_, ii. 9-11). There is no mention in Cæsar of\r\nlakes and rivers being filled with dead bodies.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 490: The Nervii considered themselves of German origin. They\r\noccupied Hainault in Belgium, and the modern cities of Cambray and\r\nTournay in France were within their limits. The Nervii were on the\r\nSabis, the Sambre. Cæsar (ii. 25) speaks of seizing a shield and\r\nrestoring the battle. Plutarch has taken from Cæsar (c. 29) the amount\r\nof the enemy's loss. See Dion Cassius (39. c. 1, &c.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 491: \"Ob easque res ex litteris Cæsaris dies xv subplicatio\r\ndecreta est, quod ante id tempus accidit nulli.\" (Cæsar, _Gallic War_,\r\nii. 35.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 492: See the Life of Crassus, c. 14; Life of Pompeius, c.\r\n51. The meeting at Luca was at the end of B.C. 56, and Plutarch has\r\nomitted the campaign of that year, which is contained in Cæsar's Third\r\nBook of the Gallic War.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 493: Csasar (iv. 1) names them Usipetes and Tenetheri. The\r\nevents in this chapter belong to B.C. 55, when Cn. Pompeius Magnus and\r\nM. Licinius Crassus were consuls for the second time.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 494: Cæsar, iv. c. 12. Plutarch here calls the Commentaries\r\n[Greek: ephêmerides] ἐφημερίδες, which means a Diary or Day-book. The\r\nproper Greek word would be [Greek: hypomnêmata] ὑπομνήματα. Kaltwasser\r\naccordingly concludes that Plutarah appears to have confounded the\r\nEphemerides and the Commentarii, or at least to have used the word\r\n[Greek: ephêmerides] ἐφημερίδες improperly instead of [Greek:\r\nhypomnêmata] ὑπομνήματα. There is no proof that Cæsar kept a diary.\r\nThat kind of labour is suited to men of a different stamp from him.\r\nPlutarch means the Commentarii. It is true that Servius (_Ad Æneid._\r\nxi. 743) speaks of a diary (Ephemeris) of Cæsar, which records his\r\nbeing once captured by the Gauls. But see the note of Davis on this\r\npassage (Cæsar, ed. Oudendorp, ii. 999). Suetonius, who enumerates\r\nCæsar's writings (Cæsar, 55, 56), mentions no Ephemeris. There were\r\nabundant sources for anecdotes about Cæsar. The Roman himself wrote as\r\nan historian: he was not a diary keeper.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 495: Tanusius Geminus wrote a history which is mentioned by\r\nSuetonius (Cæsar, 9). Cato's opinion on this occasion was merely\r\ndictated by party hostility and personal hatred. His proposal was\r\nunjust and absurd. Cæsar had good reason for writing his Anticato.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 496: Or Sigambri, a German tribe on the east bank of the\r\nLower Rhine. They bordered on the Ubii, and were north of them. The\r\nname probably remains in the Sieg, a small stream which enters the\r\nRhine on the east bank, nearly opposite to Bonn.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 497: Cæsar describes the construction of this bridge (iv.\r\n17) without giving any particulars as to the place where it was made.\r\nThe situation can only be inferred from a careful examination of the\r\nprevious part of his history, and it has been subject of much\r\ndiscussion, in which opinions are greatly divided. The narratives of\r\nDion Cassius (39. c. 48) and Florus (iii. 10) give some assistance\r\ntowards the solution of the question. Professor Müller, in an\r\nexcellent article in the 'Jahrbücher des Vereins von\r\nAlterthumsfreunden im Rheinlande' (vii. 1845), has proved that the\r\nbridge must have been built near Coblenz. Cæsar defeated the Germans\r\nin the angle between the Moselle and the Rhine. He must have crossed\r\nthe Moselle in order to find a convenient place for his bridge, which\r\nhe would find near Neuwied. The bridge abutted on the east bank on the\r\nterritory of the Ubii, who were his friends. The narrative of Cæsar,\r\nwhen carefully examined, admits of no other construction than that\r\nwhich Müller has put upon it; and if there were any doubt, it is\r\nremoved by Cæsar himself in another passage (_Gallic War_, vi. 9)\r\nwhere he speaks of his second bridge, which gave him a passage from\r\nthe territory of the Treviri into that of the Ubii, and he adds that\r\nthe site of the second bridge was near that of the first.\r\n\r\nIn the Gallic War (iv. 15) Cæsar speaks of the junction (ad\r\nconfluentem Mosæ et Rheni) of the Mosa and the Rhine, where Müller\r\nassumes that he means the Moselle, as he undoubtedly does. Either the\r\nreading Mosa is wrong, or, what is not improbable, both the Moselle\r\nand the Maas had the same name, Mosa. Mosella or Mosula is merely the\r\ndiminution of Mosa. At this confluence of the Moselle and Rhine the\r\ntown of Coblenz was afterwards built, which retains the ancient name.\r\nCæsar indicates which Mosa he means clearly enough by the words 'ad\r\nconfluentem.' There was no 'confluens' of the Great Mosa and the\r\nRhenus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 498: The first expedition of Cæsar to Britain was in the\r\nautumn of B.C. 55, and is described in his fourth book of the Gallic\r\nWar, c. 20, &c. He landed on the coast of Kent, either at Deal or\r\nbetween Sandgate and Hythe. His second expedition was in the following\r\nyear B.C. 54, which is described in the fifth book, c. 8 &c. He\r\ncrossed the Thamesis (Thames) in face of the forces of Cassivelaunus,\r\nwhose territories were bounded on the south by the Thames.\r\n\r\nThere has been some discussion on the place where Cæsar crossed the\r\nThames. Camden (p. 882, ed. Gibson) fixes the place at Cowey Stakes\r\nnear Oatlands on the Thames, opposite to the place where the Wey joins\r\nthe Thames. Bede, who wrote at the beginning of the eighth century,\r\nspeaks of stakes in the bed of the river at that place, which so far\r\ncorresponds to Cæsar's description, who says that the enemy had\r\nprotected the ford with stakes on the banks and across the bed of the\r\nriver. Certain stakes still exist there, which are the subject of a\r\npaper in the Archæologia, 1735, by Mr. Samuel Gale. The stakes are as\r\nhard as ebony; and it is evident from the exterior grain that the\r\nstakes were the entire bodies of young oak trees. Cæsar places the\r\nford eighty miles from the coast of Kent where he landed, which\r\ndistance agrees very well with the position of Oatlands, as Camden\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\nCassivelaunus had been appointed Commander-in-chief of all the British\r\nforces. This is the king whom Plutarch means. He agreed to pay an\r\nannual tribute to the Romans (_Gallic War_, v. 22), and gave them\r\nhostages. Compare Cicero, _Ad Attic._ iv. 17.\r\n\r\nCæsar wrote two letters to Cicero while he was in Britain. He wrote\r\none letter on the 1st of September, which Cicero received on the 28th\r\nof September (_Ad Quintum Fratrem,_ iii. 1). Cicero here alludes to\r\nCæsar's sorrow for his daughter's death, of which Cæsar had not\r\nreceived intelligence when he wrote to Cicero; but Cicero knew that\r\nthe news had gone to him. On the 24th of October, Cicero received\r\nanother letter written from the British coast from Cæsar, and one from\r\nhis brother Quintus who was with Cæsar. This letter was written on the\r\n26th of September. Cæsar states (_Gallic War_, v. 23) that it was near\r\nthe time of the equinox when he was leaving Britain.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 499: See the Life of Crassus, c. 16, and the Life of\r\nPompeius, c. 53.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 500: L. Aurunculeius Cotta and Q. Titurius Sabinus were sent\r\ninto the country of the Eburones, the chief part of which was between\r\nthe Maas and the Rhine, in the parallels of Namur and Liege. This\r\nking, who is called Abriorix, is named Ambiorix by Cæsar (_Gallic\r\nWar_, 24, &c.) The Gauls, after an unsuccessful attempt on the camp,\r\npersuaded the Romans to leave it under a promise that they should have\r\na safe passage through the country of the Eburones. Ambiorix made them\r\nbelieve that there was going to be a general rising of the Gauls, and\r\nthat their best plan was to make their way to the camp of Q. Cicero or\r\nLabienus. When they had left their camp, the Gauls fell upon them in a\r\nconvenient spot and massacred most of them.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 501: Quintus Cicero was encamped in the country of the\r\nNervii in Hainault. The attack on his camp is described by Cæsar\r\n(_Gallic War_, v. 39, &c.) Cæsar says, when he is speaking of his own\r\ncamp (v. 50), 'Jubet ... ex omnibus partibus castra altiore vallo\r\nmuniri portasque obstrui, &c.... cum simulatione terroris;' of which\r\nPlutarch has given the meaning.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 502: Kaltwasser remarks that Plutarch passes over the events\r\nin Cæsar's Sixth Book of the Gallic War, as containing matters of less\r\nimportance for his purpose.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 503: Cæsar (vii. 4) calls him Vercingetorix. He was of the\r\nnation of the Arverni, whom Plutarch (as his text stands) calls\r\nArvenni in c. 25, and Aruveni in c. 26. The Arverni were on the Upper\r\nLoire in Auvergne. The Carnunteni, whom Cæsar calls Carnutes, were\r\npartly in the middle basin of the same river. Orleans (Genapum) and\r\nChartres (Autricum) were their headquarters.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 504: [Greek: tais autais hodois] ταῖς αὐταῖς ὁδοῖς in the\r\nMSS., which gives no sense. I have adopted Reiske's alteration [Greek:\r\nautais tais hodois] αὐταῖς ταῖς ὁδοῖς. Cæsar (vii. 8) describes his\r\nmarch over the Cevenna, the Cevennes, in winter. He had to cut his\r\nroad through snow six feet deep. The enemy, who considered the\r\nCevennes as good a protection as a wall, were surprised by his sudden\r\nappearance.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 505: So Plutarch writes it. It is Ædui in Cæsar's text, or\r\nHædui. The Ædui, one of the most powerful of the Gallic tribes, were\r\nsituated between the Upper Loire and the Saone, and possessed the\r\nchief part of Burgundy. The Saone separated them from the Sequani on\r\nthe east.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 506: The Lingones were on the Vosges, which contain the\r\nsources of the Marne and the Moselle. The Saone separated them from\r\nthe Sequani on the south-east. The account of this campaign is\r\nunintelligible in Plutarch. It is contained in Cæsar's Seventh Book.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 507: A small matter in itself; but if true, a trait in\r\nCæsar's character. Schaefer has the following note: \"Aliter facturus\r\nerat Cyrneus, omnino inferior ille Romano.\" The Corsican is Napoleon.\r\nCæsar was the magnanimous man, whom Aristotle describes (_Eth. Nicom._\r\niv. 7); Napoleon was not.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 508: Alise, or rather the summit of Mont Auxois, west of\r\nDijon in Burgundy, represents the Alesia of Cæsar. A stream flowed\r\nalong each of two sides of the city. Alesia belonged to the Mandubii,\r\nwho were dependants of the Ædui. The siege and capture of Alesia, B.C.\r\n52, are told by Cæsar (_Gallic War_, vii. 68, &c.)\r\n\r\nThe assembling of the Gallic nations was a last great effort to throw\r\noff the yoke.\r\n\r\nDion Cassius (40. c. 41) says Vercingetorix was put in chains. Seven\r\nyears after he appeared in Cæsar's triumph, after which he was put to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nCæsar passed the winter of B.C. 51 at Nemetocenna, Arras, in Belgium.\r\nThe final pacification of Gaul is mentioned (viii. 48). Cæsar left\r\nGaul for North Italy in the early part of B.C. 50, and having visited\r\nall the cities in his province on the Italian side of the Alps, he\r\nagain returned to Nemetocenna in Belgium, and after finally settling\r\naffairs in those parts, he returned to North Italy, where he learned\r\nthat the two legions, which had been taken from him for the Parthian\r\nwar, had been given by the consul C. Marcellus to Pompeius, and were\r\nkept in Italy.\r\n\r\nIn nine years Cæsar completed the subjugation of all that part of Gaul\r\nwhich is bounded by the Saltus Pyrenæus, the Alps and the Cevennes,\r\nthe Rhine and the Rhone; and it was reduced to the form of a province.\r\n(Suetonius, _Cæsar_, c. 25.) With the capture of Alesia the Seventh\r\nbook of the Gallic War ends. The Eighth book is not by Cæsar.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 509: As to the disturbances at Rome mentioned in this\r\nchapter, see the Life of Pompeius, c. 54, &c., notes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 510: Life of Pompeius, c. 52.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 511: M. Claudius Marcellus, consul B.C. 51, with S.\r\nSulpicius Rufus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 512: Novum Comum or Novocomum; north of the Padus, had been\r\nsettled as a Colonia Latina by Cæsar. (Appianus, _Civil Wars_, ii.\r\n26.)\r\n\r\nThe government of the colonia was formed on a Roman model: there was a\r\nbody of Decuriones or Senators.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 513: See the Life of Pompeius, c. 58; Appianus, _Civil\r\nWars_, ii, 26; Dion Cassius, 40. c. 59.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 514: L.

The consuls of the year\r\nB.C. 49 were L. Cornelius Lentulus and C. Claudius Marcellus.\r\n\r\nCæsar, in the first few chapters of the Civil War, has clearly stated\r\nall the matters that are referred to in c. 30 and 31. The \"letters\"\r\nmentioned in c. 31 as coming before Curio and Antonius left Rome, are\r\nnot mentioned by Cæsar. Plutarch might have confounded this with\r\nanother matter. (_Civil War_, i. 3.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 517: Cæsar was at Ravenna when the tribunes fled from Rome,\r\nand he first saw them at Ariminum, Rimini, which was not within the\r\nlimits of Cæsar's province. (_Civil War_, i. 6; Dion Cassius, 41. c.\r\n3.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 518: Q. Hortensius Hortalus, a son of the orator Hortensius.\r\nHe was an unprincipled fellow.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 519: Cæsar says nothing of the passage of the Rubico, but\r\nhis silence does not disprove the truth of the story as told by\r\nPlutarch. The passage of the Rubico was a common topic (locus\r\ncommunis) for rhetoricians. Lucanus (_Pharsalia,_ i. 213) has\r\nembellished it:--\r\n\r\n    \"Fonte cadit modico parvisque impellitur undis\r\n    Puniceus Rubicon, cum fervida canduit æstas--\r\n    Tunc vires præbebat hiems.\"\r\n\r\nThis small stream does not appear to be identified with certainty.\r\nSome writers make it the Fiumicino.\r\n\r\nAriminum was not in Cæsar's province, and Plutarch must have known\r\nthat, as appears from his narrative. Kaltwasser thinks that he may\r\nmean that it was originally a Gallic town, which was true.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 520: In Plutarch's time the system of naming the Romans was\r\ngreatly confused, and he extended the confusion to earlier times. C.\r\nAsinius Pollio, who was with Cæsar at the Rubico and at the battle of\r\nPharsalia, wrote a history of the Civil Wars. He was also a poet.\r\n(Horatius, _Od._ ii. 1.) His work, as we may collect from c. 46,\r\nfurnished materials for anecdotes about Cæsar.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 521: This dream according to Suetonius (_Cæsar_, c. 7) and\r\nDion Cassius (41. c. 24) he had at Cades (Cadiz) in Spain during his\r\nquæstorship. The time of the dream is not unimportant, if the\r\ninterpretation of it was that he was destined to have the dominion of\r\nthe world. Cæsar has not recorded his dream. Sulla recorded his\r\ndreams. He was superstitious and cruel. Cæsar was not cruel, and there\r\nis no proof that he was superstitious.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 522: Pompeius went to Capua, where he thought of making a\r\nstand, but he soon moved on to Brundisium. On the confusion in the\r\ncity see Dion Cassius (41. c. 5-9).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 523: The author of the Eighth book of the Gallic War (c. 52)\r\nspeaks of Labienus being solicited by Cæsar's enemies. Cæsar had put\r\nhim over Gaul south of the Alps. In the Civil War, Book 1, he is\r\nmerely mentioned as having fortified Cingulum at his own cost. Cicero\r\n(_Ad Attic._ vii. 7) says that he was indebted to Cæsar for his\r\nwealth. His defection is mentioned by Cicero several times, and it\r\ngave a temporary encouragement to the party of Pompeius. (_Ad Attic._\r\nvi. 12, 13.) Labienus joined Pompeius and the Consuls at Teanum in\r\nCampania on the 23rd of January.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 524: Corfinium three miles from the river Aternus. Cæsar\r\n(_Civil War_, i. 16-23) describes the siege of Corfinium. L. Domitius\r\nAhenobarbus was treated kindly by Cæsar. He afterwards went to\r\nMassalia and defended it against Cæsar. This most excellent citizen,\r\nas Cicero calls him, met the death he so well deserved at the battle\r\nof Pharsalia, and as Cicero says (_Phillipp._ ii. 29), at the hand of\r\nM. Antonius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 525: See the Life of Pompeius, c. 62.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 526: From this it appears that the Life of Pompeius was\r\nwritten after the Life of Cæsar.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 527: Cæsar (_Civil War_, i, 32) has reported his own\r\nspeech.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 528: See the Life of Pompeius, c. 62.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 529: This was the \"sanctius ærarium\" (Cæsar, _Civil War_, i.\r\n13), which Lentulus had left open; in such alarm had he left the city.\r\nThis money, which was kept in the temple of Saturn, was never touched\r\nexcept in cases of great emergency. Vossius remarks that to save his\r\nown character, Cæsar says that he found this treasury open. But Cæsar\r\ndoes not say that he found it open. He says that Lentulus left it\r\nopen. There was time enough for Metellus to lock the door after\r\nLentulus ran away. Cæsar would have been a fool not to take the money;\r\nand if he wanted it, he would of course break the door open, if he\r\nfound it shut. But whether the door was open or shut was unimportant;\r\nthe wrongful act, if there was any, consisted in taking the money, and\r\nhe would not have been excused for taking it simply because the door\r\nwas unlocked. I believe Cæsar broke it open (Cicero _Ad Attic._ x. 4;\r\nDion Cassius, 41. c. 17; and the authorities quoted by Reimarus). I\r\nalso believe Cæsar when he says that Lentulus left the door unlocked.\r\nThe Senate had supplied Pompeius with money for the war out of the\r\nordinary treasury. When Cæsar took Corfinium, he gave to Domitius all\r\nthe money that he found there, which was to a large amount, though\r\nthis was public money and had been given to Domitius by Pompeius to\r\npay his soldiers with. (Appianus, ii. 28; Cæsar, _Civil War_, i. 23.)\r\nWhen \"that man of greatest purity and integrity,\" as Cicero calls him,\r\nM. Terentius Varro, commanded for Pompeius in Spain (B.C. 48), he\r\ncarried off the treasure from the temple of Hercules at Cadiz. That\r\nman, on whom Cicero vents every term of abuse that his fear and hatred\r\ncould supply, restored the stolen money to the god. (Cæsar, _Civil\r\nWar_, ii. 18, 21.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 530: The Spanish campaign against Afranius is contained in\r\nthe _Civil War_, 34, &c. The legati of Pompeius in Spain were L.\r\nAfranius, consul B.C. 60, M. Petreius, and M. Terentius Varro, better\r\nknown for his learning and his numerous works than for his military\r\ntalents. After the surrender of Afranius and Petreius, Cæsar marched\r\nto the south of Spain, for Varro, who was in Lusitania, was making\r\npreparations for war. Varro, after some feeble efforts, surrendered to\r\nthe conqueror at Cordova. Varro was treated kindly like all the rest\r\nwho fell into Cæsar's hands, and he had the opportunity of placing\r\nhimself against Cæsar at Dyrrachium.\r\n\r\nOn his return from the successful close of his Spanish campaign,\r\nMassalia surrendered to Cæsar after an obstinate resistance. (Cæsar,\r\n_Civil War_, ii. 22.)\r\n\r\nIt was on his return to Massalia from the south of Spain that Cæsar\r\nheard of his appointment as Dictator (_Civil War_, ii. 21).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 531: (Cæsar, _Civil War_, iii. 1; Dion Cassius, 41. c. 37.)\r\nCæsar does not speak of those who had suffered in Sulla's time; nor\r\ndoes Dion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 532: Cæsar and P. Servilius Isauricus (son of the consul\r\nIsauricus, B.C. 79) were elected Consuls for B.C. 48. See the Life of\r\nPompeius, c. 54, notes; and of Cæsar, c. 57, _Dictator_.\r\n\r\nWhen Cæsar had left Rome, the boys formed themselves into two parties,\r\nPompeians and Cæsarians, and had a battle without arms, in which the\r\nCæsarians were victorious. (Dion Cassius, 41, c. 39.)\r\n\r\nAs to Cæsar's forces, see _Civil War_, iii. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 533: Dion Cassius (41. c. 45) tells this story of the boat\r\nadventure; and (Appianus, _Civil Wars_, ii. 57) Cæsar was uneasy at\r\nthe delay of M. Antonius and his legions, and he feared that Antonius\r\nmight desert him. Cæsar says nothing of this attempt to cross the sea.\r\nHe very seldom mentions his personal risks. He left this to the\r\nanecdote collectors.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 534: The river appears to be the Anas of Dion (41. c. 45)\r\nwhich is near Apollonia, though he does not mention the river in his\r\naccount of Cæsar's attempted voyage. This is the river which Strabo\r\ncalls Æas, and Hekatæus calls Aous (Strabo, p. 316).\r\n\r\nFor the events in these three chapters see the Life of Pompeius, c.\r\n65, &c., and the references in the notes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 535: Cæsar calls the root Chara (_Civil War_, iii. 48. Comp.\r\nPlinius, _N.H._ 19, c. 8). These facts are mentioned in Cæsar. The\r\nevents in the neighbourhood of Dyrrachium and Apollonia must be\r\nstudied in Cæsar, Dion Cassius, Book 41, and Appianus, Book ii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 536: Cæsar mentions the capture of Gomphi (_Civil War_, iii.\r\n80), but he says nothing of the wine. Cæsar let his men plunder\r\nGomphi. The town had offered him all its means and prayed him for a\r\ngarrison, but on hearing of his loss at Dyrrachinm the people shut\r\ntheir gates against him and sent to Pompeius for aid. The town was\r\nstormed on the first day that it was attacked.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 537: As Kaltwasser observes, there was no bad omen in the\r\ndream, as it is here reported. We must look to the Life of Pompeius,\r\nc. 68, for the complete dream. Perhaps something has dropped out of\r\nthe text here. Dacier, as Kaltwasser says, has inserted the whole\r\npassage out of the Life of Pompeius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 538: This is an error. The name is Q. Cornificus. See the\r\nnote of Sintenis. He was a quæstor of Cæsar. Calenus is Fulvus\r\nCalenus, who had been sent by Cæsar into Achaia, and had received the\r\nsubmission of Delphi, Thebæ, and Orchomenus, and was then engaged in\r\ntaking other cities and trying to gain over other cities.

The origin of it is told by Cæsar at the end\r\nof the third Book of the Civil War. The history of the Alexandrine war\r\nby Appianus was in his Ægyptiaca, which is lost. Dion Cassius, a lover\r\nof scandal, mentions that Cæsar's attachment to Kleopatra was the\r\ncause of the Alexandrine war (42. c. 44). But it could not be the sole\r\ncause. Cæsar landed with the insignia of his office, as if he were\r\nentering a Roman province, and it might be reasonably suspected by the\r\nEgyptians that he had a design on the country. Instead of thanking\r\nthem for ridding him of his rival, he fixed himself and his soldiers\r\nin one of the quarters of Alexandria. Cæsar went to get money (Dion,\r\n42. c. 9). Kleopatra kept him there longer than he at first intended\r\nto stay.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 549: Ptolemæus Auletes through Cæsar's influence had been\r\ndeclared a friend and ally of the Romans in Cæsar's consulship B.C.\r\n59.

It does not appear that this money was\r\npromised to Cæsar: it is more probable that it was promised to the\r\nRoman State and Cæsar came to get it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 550: The story of Kleopatra coming to Cæsar is also told by\r\nDion Cassius (42. c. 34). Cæsar mentions his putting Pothinus to death\r\n(_Civil War_, iii. 112). Cæsar had at first only 3200 foot soldiers\r\nand 800 cavalry to oppose to the 20,000 men of Achillas, who were not\r\nbad soldiers. Besides these 20,000 men Achillas had a great number of\r\nvagabonds collected from all parts of Cilicia and Syria.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 551: Alexandria had no springs, and it was supplied from the\r\nNile, the water of which was received into cisterns under the houses.\r\nThis supply was (_Bell.

Cæsar supplied himself by digging wells in the sand.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 552: As to the destruction of the library see Dion Cassius\r\n(42. c. 38) and the notes of Reimarus. The destruction is not\r\nmentioned by Cæsar or the author of the Alexandrine war. Kleopatra\r\nafterwards restored it, and the library was famed for a long time\r\nafter. Lipsius (Opera iii. 1124, Vesal 1675) has collected all that is\r\nknown of this and other ancient libraries.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 553: The Pharos is a small island in the bay of Alexandria,\r\nwhich was connected with the mainland by a mole, and so divided the\r\nharbour into two parts.

Zela is eight\r\nhours south of Amasia, the birthplace of Strabo, and about 40° 15' N.\r\nlat. Pharnakes was afterwards murdered by Asander, one of his\r\ngenerals. (Appianus, _Civil Wars_, ii. 91; Dion Cassius, 42, 46;\r\n_Bell. Alexandria_, c. 72.)\r\n\r\nThe modern town of Zilleh, which contains 2000 houses, stands on the\r\nsite of Zela. A hill rises abruptly above the plain near the centre of\r\nthe present town, and occupies a commanding position. The appearance\r\nof the place corresponds very well with Strabo's description (p. 561),\r\nin whose time it was the capital of Zelitis. (Hamilton's _Asia Minor_,\r\ni. 361.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 557: This is the best MS. reading, not Amintius; the true\r\nname is probably C. Matius. He was an intimate friend of Cæsar, and he\r\nis well spoken of by Cicero. He remained faithful to the cause of\r\nCæsar after his death, and he attached himself to Octavianus. There is\r\na letter of Cicero to Matius, with the answer of Matius (Cicero, _Ad\r\nDiversos_, xi. 27, 28) written after Cæsar's death, which shows him to\r\nhave been a man of honour and courage, and worthy of the name of\r\nCæsar's friend.\r\n\r\nThis letter of Cæsar's is probably a forgery of the anecdote-makers.\r\nDavis (note to Oudendorp's Cæsar, ii. 992) has indicated the probable\r\nsource of this supposed letter. (Suetonius, _Cæsar_, c. 37.) The\r\nbattle was a smart affair of several hours, and was not won without\r\nsome loss.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 558: He was named Dictator for B.C. 47 by the Senate in Rome\r\nimmediately after the battle of Pharsalia: he was at Alexandria when\r\nhe received this news. He appointed M. Antonius his Master of the\r\nHorse and sent him to Rome. (Dion Cassius, 42. c. 21-33.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 559: It broke out during his dictatorship. (Suetonius,\r\n_Cæsar_, c. 70; Dion Cassius, 42. c. 52.) The story is told very\r\ncircumstantially by Appianus (_Civil Wars_, ii. 92). The soldiers\r\ndemanded of Cæsar release from service (missio), and he granted it to\r\nthem in a single word, Mitto. The soldiers having got what they asked\r\nfor were no longer soldiers, but citizens; and Cæsar in the subsequent\r\npart of the conference properly addressed them as Quirites, just as\r\nCicero addresses the Roman people by this name in one of his orations\r\nagainst Rullus. The soldiers at last prevailed on him to restore them\r\nto their former condition; and he set out with them for his African\r\nwar. This affair is alluded to by Tacitus. (_Annal._ ii. 42; Lucanus,\r\nv. 357.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 560: P. Cornelius Dolabella, a devoted adherent of Cæsar.\r\nHis turbulent tribunate is recorded by Dion Cassius (42. c. 29, &c.).\r\nHe was consul with M. Antonius B.C. 44. The name Amantius occurs here\r\nagain. It is Amintius in some editions of Plutarch. Kaltwasser\r\nobserves that nothing is known of Amintius and Corfinius. But\r\nCorfinius should be Cornificius; and Amantius should probably be C.\r\nMatius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 561: Cato was not in the battle of Pharsalus. After the\r\nbattle Cato, Scipio, Afranius, and Labienus went to Corcyra, whence\r\nthey sailed to Africa to join Juba. (Life of Cato, c. 55; Dion\r\nCassius, 42. c. 10; Appianus, _Civil Wars_, ii. 95, &c.)\r\n\r\nThe history of the African War is contained in one book, and is\r\nprinted in the editions with the Gallic War of Cæsar. Cæsar landed at\r\nHadrumetum, because Utica was strongly guarded. (Dion Cassius, 42. c.\r\n58.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 562: Comp. the _African War_, c. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 563: Dion Cassius (42. c. 58) calls him Salatto. Suetonius\r\n(_Cæsar_, c. 59) also tells the same story. The African campaign is\r\ntold by Dion Cassius, 43. c. 1, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 564: Scipio avoided fighting as long as he could. Thapsus\r\nwas situated on a kind of peninsula, south of Hadrumetum, as Dion\r\nCassius states. But his description is not clear. There were salt-pans\r\nnear it, which were separated from the sea by a very narrow tract.\r\nCæsar occupied this approach to Thapsus, and then formed his lines\r\nabout the town in the form of a crescent. Scipio came to relieve\r\nThapsus, and this brought on a battle. (_African War_, 80.) Cæsar\r\ncould not stop the slaughter after the battle was won.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 565: Petreius, Cæsar's former opponent in Spain, fled with\r\nJuba to Zama, where Juba had his family and his treasures. But the\r\npeople would not receive Juba into the place. On which, after rambling\r\nabout for some time with Petreius, in despair they determined to fight\r\nwith one another that they might die like soldiers. Juba, who was\r\nstrong, easily killed Petreius, and then with the help of a slave he\r\nkilled himself. (_African War_, 94; Dion Cassius, 43, c. 8.)\r\n\r\nScipio attempted to escape to Spain on ship-board. Near Hippo Regius\r\n(Bona) he was in danger of falling into the hands of P. Silius, on\r\nwhich he stabbed himself. Afranius and Faustus Sulla, the son of the\r\ndictator, were taken prisoners and murdered by the soldiers in Cæsar's\r\ncamp.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 566: As to the death of Cato, see the Life of Cato, c. 65.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 567: The work was in two books, and was written about the\r\ntime of the battle of Munda, B.C. 45. (Suetonius, c. 56; Cicero, _Ad\r\nAttic_, xii. 40; Dion Cassius, 43. c. 13, and the notes of Reimarus\r\nabout the \"Anticato.\")]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 568: Cæsar made the kingdom of Juba a Roman province, of\r\nwhich he appointed C. Sallustius, the historian, proconsul. He laid\r\nheavy impositions on the towns of Thapsus and Hadrumetum. He imposed\r\non the people of Leptis an annual tax of 3,000,000 pounds weight of\r\noil (pondo olei), which Plutarch translates by the Greek word litræ.\r\nOn his voyage to Rome he stayed at Carales (Cagliari) in Sardinia. He\r\nreached Rome at the end of July, B.C. 46. (_African War_, 97, &c.)\r\n\r\nDion Cassius (43. c. 15, &c.) gives us a speech of Cæsar before the\r\nSenate on his return to Rome.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 569: As Kaltwasser remarks, Plutarch has omitted the triumph\r\nover Gaul. (Dion Cassius, 43. c. 19; Appianus, _Civil Wars_, ii. 101.)\r\nAfter the triumph Vercingetorix was put to death. Arsinœ, the sister\r\nof Kleopatra, appeared in the Egyptian triumph in chains.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 570: See the Life of Sulla, c. 16 notes; and Dion Cassius,\r\n51. c. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 571: Plutarch has the word [Greek: triklinos] τρίκλινος. The\r\nLatin form is triclinium, a couch which would accomodate three persons\r\nat table. The word is of Greek origin, and simply means a place which\r\nwill allow three persons to recline upon it. As triclinia were placed\r\nin eating-rooms, such a room is sometimes called triclinium. It is\r\nsometimes incorrectly stated that triclinium means three couches, and\r\nthat a dining-room had the name of triclinium because it contained\r\nthree couches; which is absurd. Vitruvius describes œci(dining-rooms)\r\nsquare and large enough to contain four triclinia, and leave room also\r\nfor the servants (vi. 10). It may be true that three couches was a\r\ncommon number in a room.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 572: There was no census this year, as Rualdus quoted by\r\nKaltwasser shows. Augustus had a census made in his sixth consulship,\r\nB.C. 28; and there had then been none for twenty-four years. That of\r\nB.C. 42 was in the consulship of M. Æmilius Lepidus and Munatius\r\nPlancus. It has been remarked that Plutarch gives the exact numbers\r\nthat are given in Suetonius (_Cæsar_, 41), when he is speaking of the\r\nnumber of poor citizens who received an allowance of corn from the\r\nstate, which number Cæsar reduced from 320,000 to 150,000. This\r\npassage, compared with Dion Cassius (43. c. 21), seems to explain the\r\norigin of Plutarch's statement. Appianus (_Civil Wars_, ii. 102) also\r\nsupposed that it was a census. See Clinton, _Fasti_, Lustra Romana,\r\nB.C. 50. (See the Life of Caius Gracchus, c. 5, notes.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 573: Cæsar was sole consul in the year B.C. 45. He was still\r\ndictator.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 574: Munda was in Bætica, west of Malaca (Malaga). The\r\nbattle was fought on the day of the Liberalia, the feast of Liber or\r\nBacchus, the 17th of March. Pompeius, B.C. 49, left Brundisium on the\r\nIdes of March, the 15th.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish campaign is contained in a book entitled \"De Bello\r\nHispaniensi,\" which is printed with the \"Commentaries of Cæsar:\"\r\nthirty thousand men fell on the side of Pompeius, and three thousand\r\nequites (c. 31). See also Dion Cassius, 43, c. 36; and Appianus,\r\n_Civil Wars_, ii. 104.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 575: Cneius Pompeius, the elder of the two sons of Pompeius\r\nMagnus, was overtaken after he had for some time eluded the pursuit of\r\nthe enemy. His head was carried to Hispalis (Seville) and exhibited in\r\npublic. Cæsar, who was then at Gades (Cadiz), came shortly after to\r\nHispalis, and addressed the people in a speech. Sextus Pompeius was at\r\nCorduba during the battle, and he made his escape on hearing the news\r\nof his brother's defeat.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 576: C. Didius. According to Dion, Cn. Pompeius was killed\r\nby another set of pursuers, not by Didius. The author of the Spanish\r\nWar (c. 40) does not mention Didius as having carried the head of\r\nPompeius to Hispalis. After the death of Pompeius, Didius fell in a\r\nbattle with some Lusitani who had escaped from Munda.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 577: Cæsar celebrated his Spanish triumph in October, B.C.\r\n45.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 578: Cæsar was appointed Dictator for Life, and consul for\r\nten years, (Appianus, ii. 106.)\r\n\r\nDictatorship was properly only a temporary office, and created in some\r\ngreat emergency, or for a particular purpose. The first dictator was\r\nT. Lartius, who was appoined, B.C. 501. The original period of office\r\nwas only six months (Livius, ix. 34), and many dictators abdicated,\r\nthat is, voluntarily resigned the dictatorship before the end of the\r\nsix months. The Dictator had that authority within the city which the\r\nconsuls, when in office, only had without. During his term of office\r\nthere were no consuls. Under the Dictator there was a Magister\r\nEquitum, who was sometimes appointed probably by the Dictator. The\r\nwhole question of the dictatorship is one of considerable difficulty.\r\nNo dictator had been appointed for one hundred and twenty years before\r\nthe time when Sulla was appointed; and his dictatorship and that of\r\nCæsar must not be considered as the genuine office. Cæsar was the last\r\nRoman who had the title of Dictator. The subject of the Dictatorship\r\nis discussed by Niebuhr, _Roman History_, vol. i. 552, _English\r\nTransl._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 579: The honours decreed to Cæsar in the year before are\r\nmentioned by Dion Cassius (43. c. 14). Among other things a large\r\nstatue of him was made which was supported on a figure of the earth\r\n(probably a sphere); and there was the inscription--\"Semideus,\r\nHalf-God.\" The further honours conferred on Cæsar in this year are\r\nrecorded by Dion Cassius (43. c. 44, &c.). A statue of the Dictator\r\nwas to be placed in the temple of Quirinus (Romulus), which was\r\nequivalent to calling Cæsar a second founder of Rome. Cicero (_Ad\r\nAttic._ xii. 45, and xiii. 28)\r\n\r\nJokes Atticus on the new neighbour that he was going to have: Atticus\r\nlived on the Quirinal Hill, where the temple of Quirinus stood.\r\n\r\nThe Senate also decreed that Cæsar should use the word Imperator as a\r\ntitle prefixed to his name--Imperator Caius Julius Cæsar. The old\r\npractice was to put it after the name, as M. Tullius Cicero Imperator.\r\nThe title Imperator prefixed to the name does not occur on the medals\r\nof Cæsar. But this decree of the Senate was the origin of the term\r\nImperator being used as a title by the Roman Emperors. (Dion Cassius,\r\n43. c. 44.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 580: I do not find what particular honours Cicero proposed.\r\nHis correspondence with Atticus during this period shows that he was\r\ndissatisfied with the state of affairs, and very uneasy about himself,\r\nthough, as far as concerned Cæsar, he had nothing to fear.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 581: Carthage was destroyed B.C. 146; and Corinth in the\r\nsame year by L. Mummius. Colonies were sent to both places in B.C. 44.\r\n(Dion Cassius, 43. c. 50.) Many Romans were sent to settle in both\r\nplaces. (Strabo, p. 833; Pausanias, ii. 1.) The colonization of\r\nCarthage had been attempted by Caius Gracchus. (Life of C. Gracchus,\r\nc. 11, notes.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 582: In B.C. 45 Cæsar was consul for the fourth time and\r\nwithout a colleague. But he laid down the office before the end of the\r\nyear, and Quintus Fabius Maximus and C. Trebonius were appointed\r\nconsuls; the first instance of consuls being appointed for a part of\r\nthe year, which afterwards became a common practice. (Dion Cassius,\r\n43. c. 46.) The appointment of C. Caninius is mentioned by Cicero (_Ad\r\nDiversos_, vii. 30), who remarks that nobody dined in that consulship,\r\nand that the consul was so vigilant that he did not sleep during his\r\nterm of office: in fact he was consul for only part of a day. An\r\ninscription records the consulships of this year. (Note to Cicero in\r\nthe Variorum edition.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 583: On the intended Parthian expedition of Cæsar, see Dion\r\nCassius, 43. c. 51.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 584: This design of Cæsar is mentioned by Dion Cassius (44.\r\nc. 5), Suetonius (_Cæsar_, 441), and Plinius (_H.N._ iv. 4).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 585: This scheme is not mentioned by any other author that I\r\ncan find. Circæum, or Circeii, as the Romans called it, is the\r\nmountain promontory, now Circello or Circeo, between which and\r\nTarracina lies the southern part of the Pomptine marshes. The intended\r\ncut must therefore run nearly in the direction of the Via Appia and to\r\nthe west of it. But considerable cuttings would be required on that\r\nmore elevated part of the Campagna which lies between the mountains of\r\nAlba and the nearest part of the coast. The basin of the Pomptine\r\nmarshes is bounded by the offsets of the Alban mountains, the Volscian\r\nmountains, and the sea. In the central part it is only a few feet\r\nabove the sea-level, and in some parts it is below it. When a violent\r\nsouth-west wind raises the sea on the coast between Tarracina and\r\nCirceo, the water would be driven into the basin of the Pomptine\r\nmarshes instead of flowing out. There would therefore be no sufficient\r\nfall of water to keep the channel clear, even if the head of the cut,\r\nwhere it originated in the Tiber, were high enough; and that is\r\ndoubtful. The scheme was probably a canal, which with some locks might\r\nbe practicable; but if the work could be accomplished, it would\r\nprobably have no commercial advantages.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 586: Pometia is the common Roman form, from which comes the\r\nname of the Pometinæ, or Pomptinæ Paludes, now the Pontine Paludi; the\r\nsite of Pometia is uncertain. That Cæsar intended to accomplish the\r\ndrainage of this tract is mentioned by Dion Cassius and Suetonius.\r\n\r\nSetia (Sezza), noted for its wine, is on the Volscian hills (the Monti\r\nLepini), and on the eastern margin of the marshes. The physical\r\ncondition of this tract is described by Prony, in his \"Description\r\nHydrographique et Historique des Marais Pontins,\" 4to. Paris, 1822;\r\nthe work is accompanied by a volume of plans and sections and a map of\r\nthe district. A sketch of the physical character of this district, and\r\nof the various attempts to drain it, is also given in the 'Penny\r\nCyclopædia,'--art. _Pomptine Marshes_. See also Westphal's two\r\nvaluable maps of the Campagna di Roma, and his accompanying Memoir,\r\nBerlin and Stettin, 1829.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 587: Ostia, the old port of Rome, on the east bank of the\r\nTiber near the mouth of the river. The present Ostia is somewhat\r\nfarther inland, and was built in the ninth century by Pope Gregory the\r\nFourth. There are extensive remains of the old town, but they are in a\r\nvery decayed condition. \"Numerous shafts of columns, which are\r\nscattered about in all directions, remains of the walls of extensive\r\nbuildings, and large heaps of rubbish covered with earth and overgrown\r\nwith grass, give some, though a faint, idea of the splendour, of the\r\nancient city, which at the time of its greatest splendour, at the\r\nbeginning of our era, had eighty thousand inhabitants.\" (Westphal,\r\n_Die Römische Kampagne_, p. 7.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 588: The reformation of the Kalendar was effected in B.C.\r\n46. Dion Cassius (43. c. 26) says that Cæsar was instructed on this\r\nsubject during his residence at Alexandria in Egypt. The Egyptians had\r\na year of 365 days from a very early date (Herodotus, ii. 4). In this\r\nyear (B.C. 46) Cæsar intercalated two months of 67 days between\r\nNovember and December, and as this was the year in which, according to\r\nthe old fashion, the intercalary month of 23 days had been inserted in\r\nFebruary, the whole intercalation in this year was 90 days. Cæsar made\r\nthe reformed year consist of 365 days, and he directed one day to be\r\nintercalated in every fourth year (quarto quoque anno) in order that\r\nthe civil year, which began on the 1st of January, might agree with\r\nthe solar year. The old practice of intercalating a month was of\r\ncourse dropped. The year B.C. 46 was a year of 445 days. By this\r\nreformation, says Dion Cassius, all error was avoided except a very\r\nsmall one, and he adds, that to correct the accumulations of this\r\nerror, it would only be necessary to intercalate one day in 1461\r\nyears. But this is a mistake; for in 1460 years there would be an\r\nerror of nearly eleven days too much. Ten days were actually dropped\r\nbetween the 4th and 15th of October, 1582, by Gregory XIII., with the\r\nsanction of the Council of Trent.\r\n\r\nA curious mistake was soon made at Rome by the Pontifices who had the\r\nregulation of the Kalendar. The rule was to intercalate a day in every\r\nfourth year (quarto quoque anno). Now such expressions are ambiguous\r\nin Latin, as is shown by numerous examples. (Savigny, _System des\r\nheut. Röm. Rechts_, iv. 329.) The expression might mean that both the\r\nyear one and the year four were to be included in the interpretation\r\nof this rule; and the Pontifices interpreted it accordingly. Thus,\r\nafter intercalating in year one, they intercalated again in year four,\r\ninstead of in year five. In the time of Augustus, B.C. 8. the error\r\nwas corrected, and the civil year was set right by dropping the three\r\nintercalary days which came next after that year, three being the\r\nnumber of days in excess that had been intercalated. For the future\r\nthe rule of Cæsar was correctly interpreted. Dion Cassius in\r\nexpressing the rule as to intercalation uses the phrase, [Greek: dia\r\npente etôn] διὰ πέντε ἐτῶν.\r\n\r\nThe subject of Cæsar's reformation is explained in the notes to Dion\r\nCassius (43. c. 26), ed. Reimarus, and in the article Calendar\r\n(Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities) by Professor Key.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 589: The Romans had a large collection of these writings\r\n(libri Sibyllini) which were kept in the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus\r\nunder the care of particular functionaries (duumviri sacrorum). On\r\nthis curious subject the reader will find sufficient information in\r\nthe Penny Cyclopædia,--art. _Sibyl_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 590: Dion Cassius (44. c. 8), who tells the story, says that\r\nhe was seated in the vestibule of the Temple of Venus; and he mentions\r\nanother excuse that Cæsar had for not rising.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 591: L. Cornelius Balbus was a native of Gades. Pompeius\r\nMagnus gave him the Roman citizenship for his services in Spain\r\nagainst Sertorius, which was confirmed by a lex passed B.C. 72, in the\r\nconsulship of Cn. Cornelius Lentulus. Probably to show his gratitude\r\nto the consul, Balbus assumed the Roman name Cornelius. Balbus is\r\noften mentioned in Cicero's correspondence. After Cæsar's death he\r\nattached himself to Cæsar Octavianus, and he was consul B.C. 40. He\r\nleft a journal of the events of his own and Cæsar's life. He also\r\nurged Hirtius (Pansa) to write the Eighth Book of the Gallic War\r\n(Preface addressed to Balbus), Suetonius, Cæsar, 81.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 592: The Lupercalia are described in the Life of Romulus, c.\r\n21. The festival was celebrated on the 15th of February. It was\r\napparently an old shepherd celebration; and the name of the deity\r\nLupercus appears to be connected with the name Lupus (wolf), the\r\nnurturer of the twins Romulus and Remus. Shakspere, who has literally\r\ntransferred into his play of Julius Cæsar many passages from North's\r\nPlutarch, makes Cæsar say to the consul Antonius--\r\n\r\n    Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,\r\n    To touch Calphurnia; for our elders say,\r\n    The barren, touched in this holy chase,\r\n    Shake off their sterile curse.\r\n\r\nAct i.

Strabo (p. 622) gives two reasons why this opinion obtained;\r\none of which was, that it was not till three hundred years after the\r\nfoundation of the city that they thought of making some profit by the\r\ncustoms duties, though they had a port.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 595: Compare the Life of Brutus, c. 1, Dion Cassius (44. c.\r\n12), and Drumann, _Geschichte Roms_, Junii, p. 2.

There was originally only\r\none prætor, the Prætor Urbanus. There were now sixteen.

The passage of\r\nLivius must have been in the 116th Book, which is lost. See the\r\nEpitome. The word here probably means a pediment.

(_Gallic War_, iii. 12, &c.) Decimus Brutus was a great\r\nfavourite with Cæsar, who by his will placed him in the second degree\r\nof succession; he also gave him the province of Cisalpine Gaul, which\r\nBrutus held after Cæsar's death, and appointed him to be consul for\r\nB.C. 42. In the year B.C. 43, after M. Antonius had united himself\r\nwith M. Lepidus, the governor of Gallia Narbonensis, and L. Munatius\r\nPlancus and Asinius Pollio had also joined M. Antonius, Decimus Brutus\r\nattempted to make his escape into Macedonia to Marcus Brutus; but he\r\nwas overtaken in the Alps by the cavalry of Antonius, and put to death\r\nafter abjectly praying for mercy. This was the just punishment of a\r\ntreacherous friend who helped Cæsar to the supreme power and then\r\nbetrayed him (Vell. Paterculus, ii. 61). Like many other men, he did\r\nwell enough when he was directed by others, but when he was put in\r\ncommand, he lost his head and threw away the opportunities that he\r\nhad. There are extant several of his letters to Ciecro and letters of\r\nCicero to him. (Dion Cassius, 43. c. 53, and the references in the\r\nnotes; Drumann, _Geschichte Roms_, Junii.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 605: It was usual for the Romans in their wills to\r\nsubstitute an heres, one or more (in the Roman sense), to take the\r\nproperty in case the person who was first named in the will for any\r\nreason did not take it. Cæsar's first heres was his great nephew, C.\r\nOctavius, afterwards Augustus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 606: It was the general opinion that some roll or writing\r\nwas put into Cæsar's hands, which informed him of the conspiracy; but,\r\nas is usual in such cases, there were different statements current\r\nabout the particulars of this circumstance. Compare Dion Cassius, 44.\r\nc. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 607: According to Dion Cassius (41. c. 52) the Senate was\r\nassembled in the curia ([Greek: synedrion] συνέδριον), which Pompeius\r\nhad built.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 608: The two sects of Greek philosophy that had most\r\nadherents among the Romans were those of the Epicureans and the\r\nStoics. Cassius, as an Epicurean, would have no faith in any\r\nsuperhuman powers; but in the moments of danger a man's speculative\r\nprinciples give way to the common feelings of all mankind. I have kept\r\nPlutarch's word \"enthusiasm,\" which is here to be understood not in\r\nour sense, but in the Greek sense of a person under some superhuman\r\ninfluence.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 609: This is a mistake of Plutarch, who has stated the fact\r\ncorrectly in his Life of Brutus (c. 17). It was Caius Trebonius who\r\nkept Antonius engaged in talk, as we learn from Dion Cassius (44. c.\r\n10), Appianus (_Civil War_, ii. 117), and Cicero, who in a Letter to\r\nTrebonius (_Ad Diversos_, x. 28) complains that Trebonius had taken\r\nAntonius aside, and so saved his life.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 610: Some would write Tullius Cimber. See the note of\r\nSintenis. Atilius may be the true name.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 611: P. Servilius Casca was at this time a tribune of the\r\nPlebs (Dion Cassius, 44. c. 52).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 612: Dion Cassius adds (44. c. 19) that Cæsar said to M.\r\nBrutus, \"And you too, my son.\" Probably the story of Cæsar's death\r\nreceived many embellishments. Of his three and twenty wounds, only one\r\nwas mortal according to the physician Antistius (Suetonius, _Cæsar_,\r\n82): but though the wounds severally might not have been mortal, the\r\nloss of blood from all might have caused death. Suetonius (c. 82)\r\nadds, that Cæsar pierced the arm of Cassius (he mentions two Cassii\r\namong the conspirators) with his graphium (stylus). See the notes in\r\nBurmann's edition of Suetonius.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the death of Cæsar are minutely stated by\r\nDrumann, _Geschichte Roms_, Julii, p. 728, &c. The reflections of Dion\r\nCassius (44. c. 1, 2) on the death of Cæsar are worth reading. He\r\ncould not see that any public good was accomplished by this murder;\r\nnor can anybody else.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 613: Cicero was among them. He saw, as he says himself (_Ad\r\nAttic._ xiv. 10), the tyrant fall, and he rejoiced. In his letters he\r\nspeaks with exultation of the murder, and commends the murderers. But\r\nhe was not let into the secret. They were afraid to trust him. If he\r\nhad been in the conspiracy, he says (_Philipp._ ii. 14) he would have\r\nmade clean work; he would have assassinated all the enemies of\r\nliberty; in other words, all the chief men of Cæsar's party. He had\r\nabjectly humbled himself before Cæsar, who treated him with kind\r\nrespect. Like all genuine cowards he was cruel when he had power.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 614: M. Æmilius Lepidus, son of M. Lepidus, consul B.C. 78.\r\nHe afterwards formed one of the Triumviri with M. Antonius and\r\nOctavianus Cæsar. This was the Lepidus with whom Cæsar supped the day\r\nbefore he was murdered. He was a feeble man, though something of a\r\nsoldier. Shakspere has painted him in a few words:\r\n\r\n    _Antony_. This is a slight unmeritable man,\r\n    Meet to be sent on errands.\r\n\r\n    _Julius Cæsar_, Act iv. Sc. 1.\r\n\r\nThere is more of him in the Lives of Brutus and Antonius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 615: I do not know who this Caius Octavius is. There is\r\nprobably some mistake in the name. Lentulus was the son of P.\r\nCornelius Lentulus Spinther, consul B.C. 57. He had, like many others,\r\nexperienced Cæsar's clemency. Plutarch is mistaken in saying that this\r\nSpinther was put to death, though he was probably included in the\r\nproscription. (See Drumann, _Geschichte Roms_, Lentuli, p. 545.) The\r\nLentulus who is mentioned as having been put to death in Egypt (Life\r\nof Pompeius, c. 80) was L. Cornelius Lentulus Crus, consul B.C. 49.\r\n\r\nThe disturbances which followed Cæsar's death are more particularly\r\ndescribed in the Lives of Brutus and Antonius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 616: Cæsar made Caius Octavius, his sister's grandson, his\r\nfirst heres. He left a legacy to every Roman citizen, the amount of\r\nwhich is variously stated. He also left to the public his gardens on\r\nthe Tiber. (Suetonius, _Cæsar_, c. 83); Dion Cassius (44. c. 35).\r\n\r\nShakspere has made a noble scene of the speech of Antonius over\r\nCæsar's body on the opening of the will:\r\n\r\n    _Ant_. Here is the will, and under Cæsar's seal;\r\n    To every Roman citizen he gives,\r\n    To every several man, seventy-five drachmas:\r\n    Moreover he hath left you all his walks,\r\n    His private arbours and new planted orchards,\r\n    On this side Tiber; he hath left them you\r\n    And to your heirs for ever; common pleasures,\r\n    To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.\r\n    Here was a Cæsar. When comes such another?\r\n\r\n_Julius Cæsar_, Act iii. Sc. 2.\r\n\r\nAntonius, according to Roman fashion, made a funeral speech over the\r\nbody of Cæsar (Life of Antonius, c. 14; of Brutus, c. 20). Dion\r\nCassius (44. c. 36-49) has put a long speech in the mouth of Antonius,\r\nmere empty declamation. Appianus (_Civil Wars_, ii. 144-6) gives one\r\nwhich is well enough suited to the character of Antonius. (_Oratorum\r\nRomanorum Fragmenta_, ed. Mayer, p. 455.) It is probable that the\r\nspeech of Antonius was preserved, and was used as materials by the\r\nhistorians.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 617: This man, who unluckily bore the name of Cinna, was C.\r\nHelvius Cinna, a tribune of the plebs, a poet, and a friend of Cæsar.\r\n(Dion Cassius, 44. c. 50, and the notes of Reimarus.) The conspirator\r\nCinna was the son of L. Cornelius Cinna, who was a partisan of Marius,\r\nand was murdered in his fourth consulship (Life of Pompeius, c. 5).\r\nCæsar's wife Cornelia, the mother of his only child Julia, was the\r\nsister of the conspirator Cinna, as Plutarch names him. But probably\r\nhe was not one of the conspirators, though he approved of the deed\r\nafter it was done. (Drumann, _Geschichte Roms_, Cinnæ, p. 591, notes,\r\nand also as to Helvius Cinna.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 618: And also in the Life of Antonius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 619: Suetonius (_Cæsar_, c. 89) observes that scarce any of\r\nhis assasins survived him three years; and they all came to a violent\r\nend.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 620: This town was on the Asiatic side of the Hellespont.\r\nCompare the Life of Brutus, c. 36. 48, and Appianus (_Civil Wars_, iv.\r\n134). Dion Cassius does not mention the ghost story.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 621: It has been already remarked that Niebuhr is of opinion\r\nthat the introduction to the Life of Cæsar is lost. This opinion will\r\nnot appear well founded to those who have got a right conception of\r\nthe dramatic form in which Plutarch has cast most of his Lives, and\r\nmore particularly this of Cæsar. He begins by representing him as\r\nresisting the tyrant Sulla when others yielded, and then making his\r\nway through a long series of events to the supreme power, which he had\r\nno sooner attained than he lost it. But his fortune survived him, and\r\nthe faithless men, his murderers, most of whom owed to him their lives\r\nor their fortunes, were pursued by the avenging dæmon till they were\r\nall hunted down.\r\n\r\nA just estimate of the first of all the Romans is not a difficult\r\ntask. We know him from the evidence of his contemporaries, both\r\nfriends and enemies. The devoted attachment of his true friends is\r\nbeyond doubt; and his enemies could not deny his exalted talents.\r\nCicero, who has in various places heaped on him every term of abuse\r\nthat his copious storehouse contained, does not refuse his testimony\r\nto the great abilities and generous character of Cæsar. Drumann\r\n(_Geschichte Roms_, Julii) has given an elaborate examination of\r\nCæsar's character. His faults and his vices belonged to his age, and\r\nhe had them in common with nearly all his contemporaries. His most\r\nstriking virtues, his magnanimity, his generosity, his mercy to the\r\nvanquished, distinguished him among all the Romans of his period.\r\nCæsar was a combination of bodily activity, intellectual power, of\r\nliterary acquirements, and administrative talent that has seldom\r\nappeared. As a soldier he was not inferior in courage and endurance to\r\nthe hardiest veteran of his legions; and his military ability places\r\nhim in the first rank of commanders who have contended with and\r\novercome almost insurmountable obstacles. Cicero ranks him in the\r\nfirst class of orators; and his own immortal work, his History of the\r\nGallic Campaign and the Civil War, is a literary monument which\r\ndistinguishes him among all other commanders. As a speaker and a\r\nwriter he had no superior among his contemporaries. His varied talents\r\nare further shown by his numerous literary labours, of which some\r\nsmall notices remain. His views were large and enlightened, his\r\nschemes were vast and boundless. His genius deserved a better sphere\r\nthan the degenerate republic in which he lived. But the power which he\r\nacquired did not die with him. A youth of tender age succeeded to the\r\nname and the inheritance of Cæsar, and by his great talents and a long\r\ncareer of wonderful success consolidated that Monarchy which we call\r\nthe Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nShakspere has founded his play of Julius Cæsar on Plutarch's Life of\r\nCæsar and the Lives of Brutus and Antonius. The passages in North's\r\nversion which he has more particularly turned to his purpose are\r\ncollected in Mr. Knight's edition of Shakspere (8vo. edition).\r\nShakspere has three Roman plays, Coriolanus, Julius Cæsar, and Antony\r\nand Cleopatra. As a drama the first is the best. The play of Julius\r\nCæsar has been estimated very differently by different critics. Mr.\r\nKnight has many valuable remarks on these Roman plays (vol. xi.), and\r\nhe has shown the way, as he conceives, in which they should be viewed.\r\nThe Julius Cæsar is so constructed as to show the usurpation and death\r\nof Cæsar, and the fall of Brutus, the chief of the assassins, at the\r\nbattle of Philippi. With Brutus the hopes of his party fell. The play\r\nshould therefore rather be entitled Marcus Brutus than Julius Cæsar;\r\nand it is deficient in that unity without which no great dramatic\r\neffect can be produced. The name and the fame of Cæsar,\r\n\r\n                      the noblest man,\r\n    That ever lived in the tide of time,\r\n\r\nobscure the meaner talents of Brutus; and that death which in Plutarch\r\nforms a truly tragical catastrophe, here occurs in the middle of the\r\naction, which would appropriately terminate with it. But we have to\r\nfollow the historical course of events; we follow Brutus to his fate\r\nat the battle of Philippi, and witness the vengeance of which Cæsar's\r\nghost forewarns the false friends. Shakspere may have meant to\r\nrepresent Brutus as the last of the Romans, and the Republic as dying\r\nwith him; but he also represents him as haunted by the ghost of his\r\nmurdered benefactor, and losing heart before the final contest. The\r\n\"great dæmon\" of Cæsar avenged him on his enemies; and in this point\r\nof view the play has a unity. Brutus dies like a Roman, and that\r\nmurder to which he was led by the instigation of others, only renders\r\nthe Monarchy inevitable and necessary. But if the play is faulty in\r\nconstruction, as I venture to think it is, it has other merits of the\r\nhighest order, which place it in some respects among the best works of\r\nthe great master of dramatic art.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF PHOKION.\r\n\r\nI. The orator Demades, who became one of the chief men in Athens by\r\nhis subservience to the Macedonians and Antipater, and who was forced\r\nto say and to write much that was derogatory to the glory and contrary\r\nto the traditional policy of Athens, used to excuse himself by\r\npleading that he did not come to the helm before the vessel of the\r\nState was an utter wreck. This expression, which seems a bold one when\r\nused by Demades, might with great truth have been applied to the\r\npolicy of Phokion. Indeed Demades himself wrecked Athens by his\r\nlicentious life and policy, and when he was an old man Antipater said\r\nof him that he was like a victim which has been cut up for sacrifice,\r\nfor there was nothing left of him but his tongue and his paunch; while\r\nthe true virtue of Phokion was obscured by the evil days for Greece\r\nduring which he lived, which prevented his obtaining the distinction\r\nwhich he deserved. We must not believe Sophokles, when he says that\r\nvirtue is feeble and dies out in men:\r\n\r\n    \"Why, not the very mind that's born with man,\r\n    When he's unfortunate, remains the same.\"\r\n\r\nYet we must admit that fortune has so much power even over good men,\r\nthat it has sometimes withheld from them their due meed of esteem and\r\npraise, has sullied their reputations with unworthy calumnies, and\r\nmade it difficult for the world to believe in their virtue.\r\n\r\nII. It would seem that democracies, when elated by success, are\r\nespecially prone to break out into wanton maltreatment of their\r\ngreatest men; and this is also true in the opposite case: for\r\nmisfortunes render popular assemblies harsh, irritable, and uncertain\r\nin temper, so that it becomes a dangerous matter to address them,\r\nbecause they take offence at any speaker who gives them wholesome\r\ncounsel. When he blames them for their mistakes, they think that he is\r\nreproaching them with their misfortunes, and when he speaks his mind\r\nfreely about their condition, they imagine that he is insulting them.\r\nJust as honey irritates wounds and sores, so does true and sensible\r\nadvice exasperate the unfortunate, if it be not of a gentle and\r\nsoothing nature: exactly as the poet calls sweet things agreeable,\r\nbecause they agree with the taste, and do not oppose or fight against\r\nit. An inflamed eye prefers the shade, and shuns strong lights: and a\r\ncity, when involved in misfortunes, becomes timid and weak through its\r\ninability to endure plain speaking at a time when it especially needs\r\nit, as otherwise its mistakes cannot be repaired. For this reason the\r\nposition of a statesman in a democracy must always be full of peril;\r\nfor if he tries merely to please the people he will share their ruin,\r\nwhile if he thwarts them he will be destroyed by them.\r\n\r\nAstronomers teach us that the sun does not move in exactly the same\r\ncourse as the stars, and yet not in one which is opposed to them, but\r\nby revolving in an inclined and oblique orbit performs an easy and\r\nexcellent circuit through them all, by which means everything is kept\r\nin its place, and its elements combined in the most admirable manner.\r\nSo too in political matters, the man who takes too high a tone, and\r\nopposes the popular will in all cases, must be thought harsh and\r\nmorose, while on the other hand he who always follows the people and\r\nshares in all their mistakes pursues a dangerous and ruinous policy.\r\nThe art of government by which states are made great consists in\r\nsometimes making concessions to the people, and gratifying them when\r\nthey are obedient to authority, and at the same time insisting upon\r\nsalutary measures. Men willingly obey and support such a ruler if he\r\ndoes not act in a harsh and tyrannical fashion: but he has a very\r\ndifficult and laborious part to play, and it is hard for him to\r\ncombine the sternness of a sovereign with the gentleness of a popular\r\nleader, If, however, he succeed in combining these qualities, they\r\nproduce the truest and noblest harmony, like that by which God is\r\nsaid to regulate the universe, as everything is brought about by\r\ngentle persuasion, and not by violence.\r\n\r\nIII. All this was exemplified in the case of the younger Cato: for he\r\nhad not the art of persuasion and was unacceptable to the people, nor\r\ndid he rise to eminence by the popular favour, but Cicero[622] says\r\nthat he lost his consulship because he acted as if he were living in\r\nthe Republic of Plato, and not in the dregs of Romulus. Such men seem\r\nto me to resemble fruits which grow out of season: for men gaze upon\r\nthem with wonder, but do not eat them: and the stern antique virtue of\r\nCato, displayed as it was in a corrupt and dissolute age, long after\r\nthe season for it had gone by, gained him great glory and renown, but\r\nproved totally useless, as it was of too exalted a type to suit the\r\npolitical exigencies of the day. When Cato began his career, his\r\ncountry was not already ruined, as was that of Phokion. The ship of\r\nthe state was indeed labouring heavily in the storm, but Cato,\r\nalthough he was not permitted to take the helm and guide the vessel,\r\nexerted himself so manfully, and gave so much assistance to those who\r\nwere more powerful than himself, that he all but triumphed over\r\nfortune. The constitution was, no doubt, finally overthrown; but its\r\nruin was due to others, and only took place after a long and severe\r\nstruggle, during which Cato very nearly succeeded in saving it. I have\r\nchosen Phokion to compare with him, not because of the general\r\nresemblance of their characters as good and statesmanlike men, for a\r\nman may possess the same quality in various forms, as, for example,\r\nthe courage of Alkibiades was of a different kind to that of\r\nEpameinondas; the ability of Themistokles was different to that of\r\nAristeides; and the justice of Numa Pompilius was different to that of\r\nAgesilaus. But in the case of Phokion and Cato, their virtues bore the\r\nsame stamp, form, and ethical complexion down to the most minute\r\nparticulars. Both alike possessed the same mixture of kindness and\r\nseverity, of caution and daring: both alike cared for the safety of\r\nothers and neglected their own: both alike shrank from baseness, and\r\nwere zealous for the right; so that one would have to use a very nice\r\ndiscrimination to discover the points of difference between their\r\nrespective dispositions.\r\n\r\nIV. Cato is admitted by all writers to have been a man of noble\r\ndescent, as will be explained in his life: and I imagine that the\r\nfamily of Phokion was not altogether mean and contemptible. If his\r\nfather had really been a pestle maker, as we are told by Idomeneus,\r\nwho may be sure that Glaukippus, the son of Hypereides, who collected\r\nand flung at him such a mass of abuse, would not have omitted to\r\nmention his low birth, nor would he have been so well brought up as to\r\nhave been a scholar of Plato while a lad, and afterwards to have\r\nstudied under Xenokrates in the Academy; while from his youth up he\r\nalways took an interest in liberal branches of learning. We are told\r\nby the historian Douris that scarcely any Athenian ever saw Phokion\r\nlaughing or weeping, or bathing in the public baths, or with his hand\r\noutside of his cloak, when he wore one. Indeed when he was in the\r\ncountry or on a campaign he always went barefooted and wore only his\r\ntunic, unless the cold was excessively severe; so that the soldiers\r\nused to say in jest that it was a sign of wintry weather to see\r\nPhokion wearing his cloak.\r\n\r\nV. Though one of the kindest and most affable of men, he was of a\r\nforbidding and severe countenance, so that men who did not know him\r\nwell feared to address him when alone. Once when Chares in a speech\r\nmentioned Phokion's gloomy brow, the Athenians began to laugh. \"Yet,\"\r\nsaid he, \"his brow has never harmed you: but the laughter of these men\r\nhas brought great sorrow upon the state.\" In like manner also the\r\noratory of Phokion was most valuable, as it incited his countrymen to\r\nwin brilliant successes, and to form lofty aspirations. He spoke in a\r\nbrief, harsh, commanding style, without any attempt to flatter or\r\nplease his audience. Just as Zeno says that a philosopher ought to\r\nsteep his words in meaning, so Phokion's speeches conveyed the\r\ngreatest possible amount of meaning in the smallest compass. It is\r\nprobably in allusion to this that Polyeuktus[623] of Sphettus said\r\nthat Demosthenes was the best orator, but that Phokion was the most\r\npowerful speaker. As the smallest coins are those which have the\r\ngreatest intrinsic value, so Phokion in his speeches seemed to say\r\nmuch with few words. We are told that once while the people were\r\nflocking into the theatre Phokion was walking up and down near the\r\nstage, plunged in thought. \"You seem meditative, Phokion,\" said one of\r\nhis friends. \"Yes, by Zeus,\" answered he, \"I am considering whether I\r\ncan shorten the speech which I am going to make to the Athenians.\"\r\nDemosthenes himself, who despised the other orators, when Phokion rose\r\nused to whisper to his friends, \"Here comes the cleaver of my\r\nharangues.\" Much of his influence, however, must be ascribed to his\r\npersonal character; since a word or a gesture of a truly good man\r\ncarries more weight than ten thousand eloquently argued speeches.\r\n\r\nVI. While yet a youth Phokion especially attached himself to the\r\ngeneral Chabrias, and followed him in his campaigns, in which he\r\ngained considerable military experience, and in some instances was\r\nable to correct the strange inequalities of his commander's\r\ntemperament. Chabrias, usually sluggish and hard to rouse, when in\r\naction became vehemently excited, and tried to outdo the boldest of\r\nhis followers in acts of daring: indeed he lost his life at Chios by\r\nbeing the first to run his ship on shore and to try to effect a\r\nlanding in the face of the enemy. Phokion, who was a man of action,\r\nand cautious nevertheless, proved most useful in stirring up Chabrias\r\nwhen sluggish, and again in moderating his eagerness when roused. In\r\nconsequence of this, Chabrias, who was of a kindly and noble\r\ndisposition, loved Phokion and promoted him to many responsible posts,\r\nso that his name became well known throughout Greece, as Chabrias\r\nentrusted him with the management of the most important military\r\noperations. At the battle of Naxos he enabled Phokion to win great\r\nglory, by placing him in command of the left wing, where the most\r\nimportant struggle took place, and where the victory was finally\r\ndecided. As this was the first sea fight, since the capture and ruin\r\nof Athens, which the Athenians won by themselves, without allies, over\r\nother Greeks, they were greatly pleased with Chabrias, and Phokion was\r\nhenceforth spoken of as a man of military genius. The battle was won\r\nduring the performance of the Great Mysteries at Eleusis; and every\r\nyear afterwards, on the sixteenth day of the month Böedromion,\r\nChabrias used to entertain the Athenians, and offer libations of wine\r\nto the gods.\r\n\r\nVII. After this Chabrias sent Phokion to visit the islands and exact\r\ntribute from them, giving him an escort of twenty ships of war: upon\r\nwhich Phokion is said to have remarked, that if he was sent to fight\r\nthe islanders, he should require a larger force, but that if he was\r\ngoing to the allies of Athens, one ship would suffice for him. He\r\nsailed in his own trireme, visited all the states, simply and\r\nunassumingly explained the objects of his mission to their leading\r\nmen, and returned home with a large fleet, which the allies despatched\r\nto convey their tribute safe to Athens.\r\n\r\nHe not only esteemed and looked up to Chabrias while he lived, but\r\nafter his death he took care of his family, and endeavoured to make a\r\ngood man of his son Ktesippus; and though he found this youth stupid\r\nand unmanageable, he never ceased his efforts to amend his character\r\nand to conceal his faults. Once only we are told that when on some\r\ncampaign the young man was tormenting him with unreasonable questions,\r\nand offering him advice as though he were appointed assistant-general,\r\nPhokion exclaimed, \"O Chabrias, Chabrias, I do indeed prove myself\r\ngrateful for your friendship for me, by enduring this from your son!\"\r\nObserving that the public men of the day had, as if by lot, divided\r\nthe duties of the war-office and of the public assembly amongst\r\nthemselves, so that Eubulus, Aristophon, Demosthenes, Lykurgus, and\r\nHypereides did nothing except make speeches to the people and bring\r\nforward bills, while Diopeithes, Menestheus, Leosthenes, and Chares\r\nrose entirely by acting as generals and by making war, Phokion wished\r\nto restore the era of Perikles, Aristeides, and Solon, statesmen who\r\nwere able to manage both of these branches of the administration with\r\nequal success. Each one of those great men seemed to him, in the words\r\nof Archilochus, to have been\r\n\r\n    \"A man, who served the grisly god of arms,\r\n    Yet well could comprehend the Muses's charms.\"\r\n\r\nThe tutelary goddess of Athens herself, he remarked, presided equally\r\nover war and over domestic administration, and was worshipped under\r\nboth attributes.\r\n\r\nVIII. With this object in view Phokion invariably used his political\r\ninfluence in favour of peace, but nevertheless was elected\r\ngeneral[624] more times not only than any of his contemporaries, but\r\nalso than any of his predecessors: yet he never canvassed his\r\ncountrymen or made any effort to obtain the office, though he did not\r\nrefuse to fill it at his country's bidding. All historians admit that\r\nhe was elected general five-and-forty times, and never once missed\r\nbeing elected, since even when he was absent the Athenians used to\r\nsend for him to come home and be elected; so that his enemies used to\r\nwonder that Phokion, who always thwarted the Athenians and never\r\nflattered them either by word or deed, should be favoured by them, and\r\nwere wont to say that the Athenians in their hours of relaxation used\r\nto amuse themselves by listening to the speeches of their more lively\r\nand brilliant orators, just as royal personages are said to amuse\r\nthemselves with their favourites after dinner, but that they made\r\ntheir appointments to public offices in a sober and earnest spirit,\r\nchoosing for that purpose the most severe and sensible man in Athens,\r\nand the one too, who alone, or at any rate more than any one else, was\r\nin the habit of opposing their impulses and wishes. When an oracle was\r\nbrought from Delphi and read before the assembly, which said that\r\nwhen all the Athenians were of one mind, one man would be opposed to\r\nthe state, Phokion rose and said that he was the man in question, for\r\nhe disapproved of the whole of their policy. And once when he made\r\nsome remark in a speech which was vociferously applauded, and he saw\r\nthe whole assembly unanimous in its approval of his words, he turned\r\nto some of his friends and said, \"Have I inadvertently said something\r\nbad?\"\r\n\r\nIX. Once when the Athenians were asking for subscriptions for some\r\nfestival, and all the others had paid their subscriptions, Phokion,\r\nafter he had been frequently asked to subscribe, answered, \"Ask these\r\nrich men: for my part I should be ashamed of myself if I were to give\r\nmoney to you, and not pay what I owe to this man here,\" pointing to\r\nKallikles the money-lender. As the people did not cease shouting and\r\nabusing him, he told them a fable: \"A cowardly man went to the wars,\r\nand when he heard the cawing of the crows, he laid down his arms and\r\nsat still. Then he took up his arms and marched on, and they again\r\nbegan to caw, so he halted again. At last he said, 'You may caw as\r\nloud as you please, but you shall never make a meal of me.'\" On\r\nanother occasion when the Athenians wished to send him to meet the\r\nenemy, and when he refused, called him a coward, he said, \"You are not\r\nable to make me brave, nor am I able to make you cowards. However, we\r\nunderstand one another.\" At some dangerous crisis the people were\r\ngreatly enraged with him, and demanded an account of his conduct as\r\ngeneral. \"I hope,\" said he, \"my good friends, that you will save\r\nyourselves first.\" As the Athenians, when at war, were\r\nhumble-spirited, and full of fears, but after peace was made became\r\nbold, and reproached Phokion for having lost them their chance of\r\nvictory, he said, \"You are fortunate in having a general who\r\nunderstands you; for if you had not, you would long ago have been\r\nruined.\" When the Athenians wished to decide some dispute about\r\nterritory by arms instead of by arbitration, Phokion advised them to\r\nfight the Bœotians with words, in which they were superior, not with\r\narms, in which they were inferior to them. Once when they would not\r\nattend to his words, or listen to him, he said, \"You are able to force\r\nme to do what I do not wish, but you shall never force me to counsel\r\nwhat I do not approve.\" When Demosthenes, one of the orators of the\r\nopposite party, said to him, \"Phokion, the Athenians will kill you, if\r\nthey lose their senses.\" He answered, \"Yes, but they will kill you, if\r\nthey regain them.\" When he saw Polyeuktus of Sphettus in a great heat\r\nurging the Athenians to go to war with Philip, panting and sweating\r\nprofusely, as he was a very fat man, and drinking great draughts of\r\nwater, he said, \"Ought you to believe what this man says, and vote for\r\nwar? What sort of a figure will he make in a suit of armour and with a\r\nshield to carry, when the enemy are at hand, if he cannot explain his\r\nthoughts to you without nearly choking himself?\" When Lykurgus abused\r\nhim freely in the public assembly and above all, reproached him with\r\nhaving advised the people to deliver up ten citizens to Alexander when\r\nhe demanded them, he said, \"I have often given the people good advice,\r\nbut they will not obey me.\"\r\n\r\nX. There was one Archibiades, who was surnamed the Laconizer, who grew\r\na great beard, wore a Spartan cloak, and affected a stern demeanour\r\nlike a Spartan. Once when Phokion was being violently attacked in the\r\nassembly he called upon this man to bear witness to the truth of what\r\nhe said, and to assist him. Archibiades now rose and said what he\r\nthought would please the Athenians, upon which Phokion, seizing him by\r\nthe beard, exclaimed, \"Why then, Archibiades, do you not shave?\"[625]\r\nWhen Aristogeiton, the informer, who made warlike speeches in the\r\npublic assembly, and urged the people to action, came to be enrolled\r\non the list for active service leaning on a stick, with his legs\r\nbandaged, Phokion, catching sight of him from the tribune where he\r\nstood, called out \"Write down Aristogeiton, a cripple and a villain.\"\r\nFrom this it appears strange that so harsh and ungenial a man should\r\nhave been named \"The Good.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, I imagine, but not impossible, for the same man to\r\nbe like wine, both sweet and harsh: just as other men and other wines\r\nseem at first to be pleasant, but prove in the end both disagreeable\r\nand injurious to those who use them. We are told that Hypereides once\r\nsaid to the Athenians, \"Men of Athens, do not think whether I am harsh\r\nor not, but whether I am harsh for nothing;\" as if it was only\r\ncovetousness that made men hated, and as if those persons were not\r\nmuch more generally disliked who used their power to gratify their\r\ninsolence, their private grudges, their anger, or their ambition.\r\nPhokion never harmed any Athenian because he disliked him, and never\r\naccounted any man his enemy, but merely showed himself stern and\r\ninexorable to those who opposed his efforts to save his country, while\r\nin the rest of his life he was so kind and amiable to all men, that he\r\noften helped his opponents, and came to the aid of his political\r\nantagonists when they were in difficulties. Once when his friends\r\nreproached him for having interceded in court for some worthless man\r\nwho was being tried, he answered that good men do not need any\r\nintercessor. When Aristogeiton, after he had been condemned, sent for\r\nPhokion, and begged him to visit him, he at once started to go to the\r\nprison; and when his friends tried to prevent him, he said, \"My good\r\nsirs, let me go; for where would one wish to meet Aristogeiton rather\r\nthan in prison?\"\r\n\r\nXI. Indeed, if any other generals were sent out to the allies and\r\npeople of the islands, they always treated them as enemies, fortified\r\ntheir walls, blocked up their harbours, and sent their slaves and\r\ncattle, their women and children, into their cities for shelter; but\r\nwhen Phokion was in command they came out a long way to meet him with\r\ntheir own ships, crowned with flowers, and led him rejoicing into\r\ntheir cities.\r\n\r\nXII. When Philip stealthily seized Eubœa,[626] landed a Macedonian\r\narmy there, and began to win over the cities by means of their\r\ndespots, Plutarchus of Eretria sent to Athens and begged the Athenians\r\nto rescue the island from the Macedonians. Phokion was now sent\r\nthither in command of a small force, as it was expected that the\r\npeople of the country would rally round him. He found, however,\r\nnothing but treachery and corruption, as all patriotism had been\r\nundermined by the bribes of Philip, and soon was brought into great\r\ndanger. He established himself upon a hill which was cut off by a\r\nravine from the plain near the city of Tamynæ, and there collected the\r\nmost trustworthy part of his forces, bidding his officers take no heed\r\nof the undisciplined mass of talkers and cowards who deserted from his\r\ncamp and made their way home, observing that they were useless in\r\naction because they would not obey orders, and only hindered the\r\nfighting men, while at Athens the consciousness of their baseness\r\nwould prevent their bringing false accusations against him.\r\n\r\nXIII. When the enemy[627] drew near, he ordered his troops to remain\r\nquiet under arms until he had finished offering sacrifice. Either the\r\nsacrifices were unfavourable, or else he designedly wasted time,\r\nwishing to bring the enemy as close as possible. The result was that\r\nPlutarchus,[628] imagining that the Athenians were terror-stricken and\r\nhanging back, rushed to attack the enemy at the head of the Eubœans.\r\nSeeing this, the Athenian cavalry could no longer endure to remain\r\nidle, but charged at once, pouring out of their camp in scattered\r\nbodies and with much confusion. These first troops were defeated, and\r\nPlutarchus himself took to flight. Some of the enemy now came close up\r\nto the rampart of the Athenian camp, and began to tear down the\r\nstakes of which it was formed as though they were already completely\r\nvictorious.\r\n\r\nAt this crisis the sacrifices proved favourable, and the Athenian\r\ninfantry, sallying out of their camp, routed and overthrew all whom\r\nthey found near their ramparts. Phokion now ordered his main body to\r\nremain in reserve, in order to give those who had been scattered in\r\nthe former skirmish a point to rally on, while he himself, with some\r\npicked men, charged the enemy. A severe battle now took place, in\r\nwhich all exerted themselves with the most reckless bravery. Thallus,\r\nthe son of Kineas, and Glaukus, the son of Polymedes, who fought by\r\nthe side of the general himself, were especially distinguished.\r\nKleophanes also did most excellent service on this occasion, for he\r\nrallied the scattered horsemen, called upon them to help their general\r\nin his utmost need, and prevailed upon them to return and complete the\r\nvictory which the infantry had gained. After this, Phokion banished\r\nPlutarchus from Eretria, and captured a fort named Zaretra, which\r\ncommanded the narrowest part of the island. He set free all the Greek\r\ncaptives, because he feared that the Athenian orators might urge the\r\npeople in their anger to treat them with undue severity.\r\n\r\nXIV. After Phokion had accomplished this, he sailed away to Athens;\r\nand the allies soon found cause to wish for his goodness and justice,\r\nwhile the Athenians soon learned to value his courage and military\r\nskill. Molossus, his successor, managed the war so unsuccessfully that\r\nhe himself was made a prisoner by the enemy. Shortly afterwards\r\nPhilip, full of great designs, proceeded with all his army to the\r\nHellespont, in order to take Perinthus, Byzantium, and the Chersonese\r\nat one blow. The Athenians were eager to help these cities, and the\r\norators succeeded in getting Chares sent thither in command of an\r\narmy. However, when he arrived he effected nothing of importance, for\r\nthe cities would not admit his troops within their walls, and viewed\r\nhim with suspicion, so that he was reduced to roaming about the\r\ncountry, exacting contributions of money from the allies of Athens,\r\nand regarded with contempt by the enemy. Upon this the people,\r\nexasperated by the speeches of the orators, became much enraged, and\r\nregretted that they had sent any assistance to the people of\r\nByzantium: but Phokion rose, and said that they ought not be angry\r\nwith their allies for not trusting them, but with their generals for\r\nnot being trustworthy. \"These men,\" he remarked, \"make you feared even\r\nby those who cannot be saved without your assistance.\"\r\n\r\nThe Athenians were much moved by these words. They repented of their\r\nanger, and ordered Phokion himself to take a second armament and\r\nproceed to the assistance of their allies on the Hellespont. The\r\nreputation of Phokion had been very great even before this, but now,\r\nsince Leon, the leading man in Byzantium, who had been a\r\nfellow-student in the Academy with Phokion, made himself answerable\r\nfor his good faith, the Byzantines would not permit him to carry out\r\nhis intention of encamping outside their walls, but opened their gates\r\nand received the Athenians into their houses. Phokion's men proved not\r\nonly irreproachable in their conduct, but repaid the confidence which\r\nhad been shown them by fighting on all occasions with the utmost\r\nbravery. Thus was Philip this time driven from the Hellespont, and\r\nregarded with contempt as a coward and a runaway, while Phokion took\r\nseveral of his ships, recovered some towns which had received\r\nMacedonian garrisons, and landed at various points on the coast to\r\nravage and overrun the country, until at last he was wounded by the\r\nenemy and forced to return home.\r\n\r\nXV. Once when the people of Megara secretly invited Phokion to come to\r\ntheir aid, as he was afraid that the Bœotians might hear of his\r\nintentions and cut off the proposed reinforcements, he called a\r\nmeeting of the Assembly at daybreak, laid the Megarian proposals\r\nbefore the Athenians, and as soon as a decree had been passed to aid\r\nthem, ordered the trumpet to sound, bade his troops leave the Assembly\r\nand get under arms at once, and led them straightway to Megara. The\r\npeople of Megara gladly welcomed him, and he not only fortified Nisæa,\r\nbut built two long walls from the city to its seaport, thus joining\r\nMegara to the sea in such a fashion that the city no longer feared\r\nits enemies by land, and cheerfully threw in its lot with the\r\nAthenians.\r\n\r\nXVI. When Philip was viewed with hostility by every state in Greece,\r\nand other generals had been elected in Phokion's absence to make war\r\nagainst him, Phokion, when he returned from his tour among the\r\nislands, advised them to make peace, and come to terms with Philip,\r\nwho on his part was quite willing to do so, and feared to go to war.\r\nOn this occasion a pettifogging Athenian, who spent all his time in\r\nthe law courts, opposed Phokion, and said, \"Do you dare, Phokion, to\r\nadvise the Athenians to turn back when they have arms already in their\r\nhands?\" \"Yes, I do,\" answered he, \"and that too although I know that\r\nin time of war I shall be your master, and in time of peace you will\r\nbe mine.\" As Phokion did not succeed, but Demosthenes carried his\r\npoint, and counselled the Athenians to fight as far as possible from\r\nAttica, he said to him: \"My good sir, let us not consider where we are\r\nto fight, but how we can win the victory. If we are victorious, the\r\nwar will be kept at a distance, but all the horrors of war always\r\npress closely upon the vanquished.\" After the defeat,[629] the noisy\r\nrevolutionary party dragged Charidemus to the tribune, and bade him\r\nact as general. All the more respectable citizens were much alarmed at\r\nthis. They appealed to the council of the Areopagus to aid them,\r\naddressed the people with tears and entreaties, and prevailed upon\r\nthem to place the city under the charge of Phokion. Phokion now\r\nconsidered it necessary to submit with a good grace to the pleasure of\r\nPhilip, and when Demades moved that Athens should share the general\r\npeace and take part in the congress of the Greek states, Phokion\r\nobjected to the motion before it was known what Philip wished the\r\nGreeks to do. His opposition was fruitless, because of the critical\r\nstate of affairs; but when afterwards he saw the Athenians bitterly\r\nrepenting of what they had done, because they were obliged to furnish\r\nPhilip with ships of war and cavalry, he said: \"It was because I\r\nfeared this that I opposed the motion of Demades: but now that you\r\nhave passed that motion you must not be grieved and downcast, but\r\nremember that your ancestors were sometimes independent and sometimes\r\nsubject to others, but that they acted honourably in either case, and\r\nsaved both their city and the whole of Greece.\" On the death of Philip\r\nhe opposed the wish of the Athenians to hold a festival[630] because\r\nof the good news: for he said that it was an unworthy thing for them\r\nto rejoice, because the army which had defeated them at Chæronea had\r\nbeen weakened by the loss of only one man.\r\n\r\nXVII. When Demosthenes spoke abusively of Alexander, who was even then\r\nat the gates of Thebes, Phokion said to him, in the words of Homer,\r\n\r\n     \"'Rash man, forbear to rouse the angry chief,'\r\n\r\nwho is also a man of unbounded ambition. When he has kindled such a\r\nterrible conflagration close by, why do you wish our city to fan the\r\nflame? I, however, will not permit these men to ruin us, even though\r\nthey wish it, for that is why I have undertaken the office of\r\ngeneral.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Thebes was destroyed, Alexander demanded Demosthenes and his\r\nparty, with Lykurgus, Hypereides, and Charidenus to be delivered up to\r\nhim. The whole assembly, on hearing this proposal, cast its eyes upon\r\nPhokion, and, after calling upon him repeatedly by name, induced him\r\nto rise. Placing by his side his most beloved and trusted friend, he\r\nsaid:[631] \"These men have brought the city to such a pass, that if\r\nany one were to demand that Nikokles here should be delivered up to\r\nhim, I should advise you to give him up. For my own part, I should\r\naccount it a happy thing to die on behalf of all of you. I feel pity\r\nalso, men of Athens,\" said he, \"for those Thebans who have fled\r\nhither for refuge; but it is enough that Greece should have to mourn\r\nfor the loss of Thebes. It is better then, on behalf of both the\r\nThebans and ourselves, to deprecate the wrath of our conqueror rather\r\nthan to oppose him.\"\r\n\r\nWe are told that when the decree refusing to give up the persons\r\ndemanded was presented to Alexander, he flung it from him and refused\r\nto listen to the envoys; but he received a second embassy headed by\r\nPhokion, because he was told by the older Macedonians that his father\r\nhad always treated him with great respect. He not only conversed with\r\nPhokion, and heard his petition, but even asked his advice. Phokion\r\nadvised him, if he desired quiet, to give up war; and if he wished for\r\nglory, to turn his arms against the Persians, and leave the Greeks\r\nunmolested. Phokion conversed much with Alexander, and, as he had\r\nformed a shrewd estimate of his character, was so happy in his remarks\r\nthat he entirely appeased his anger, and even led him to say that the\r\nAthenians must watch the progress of events with care, since, if\r\nanything were to happen to him, it would be their duty to take the\r\nlead in Greece. Alexander singled out Phokion in a special manner as\r\nhis guest and friend, and treated him with a degree of respect which\r\nhe showed to few even of his own companions. The historian Douris\r\ntells us in confirmation of this that after Alexander had conquered\r\nDarius, and had become a great man, he omitted the usual words of\r\ngreeting from all his letters, except from those which he wrote to\r\nPhokion, addressing him alone as he addressed Antipater (his viceroy),\r\nwith the word 'Hail.' This is also recorded by the historian Chares.\r\n\r\nXVIII. With regard to money matters, all writers agree in saying that\r\nAlexander sent Phokion a hundred talents as a present. When this money\r\narrived at Athens Phokion enquired of those who brought it why\r\nAlexander should give all this money to him alone, when there were so\r\nmany other citizens in Athens? They answered, \"Because he thinks that\r\nyou alone are a good and honourable man.\" \"Then,\" said Phokion, \"let\r\nhim allow me still to be thought so, and to remain so.\" When the men\r\nwho brought the treasure followed him into his house, and saw its\r\nfrugal arrangements, and his wife making bread, while Phokion with his\r\nown hands drew water from the well and washed their feet, they pressed\r\nthe money upon him yet more earnestly, and expressed their\r\ndisappointment at his refusal, saying that it was a shameful thing for\r\na friend of King Alexander to live so poorly. Phokion, seeing a poor\r\nold man walk by clad in a ragged cloak, asked them whether they\r\nthought him to be a worse man than that. They begged him not to say\r\nsuch things, but he answered. \"And yet that man lives on slenderer\r\nmeans than mine, and finds that they suffice him. Moreover,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"if I received such a mass of gold and did not use it, I\r\nshould reap no advantage from it, while, if I did use it, I should\r\ndestroy both my own character and that of the giver.\" So the treasure\r\nwas sent back from Athens, and proved that the man who did not need\r\nsuch a sum was richer than he who offered it. As Alexander was\r\ndispleased, and wrote to Phokion saying that he did not regard as his\r\nfriends those who asked him for nothing, Phokion did not even then ask\r\nfor money, but begged for the release of Echekrates the sophist,\r\nAthenodorus of Imbros, and of two Rhodians, Demaratus and Sparton, who\r\nhad been arrested, and were imprisoned at Sardis. Alexander\r\nimmediately set these men at liberty, and sending Kraterus to\r\nMacedonia bade him hand over to Phokion whichever he might choose of\r\nthe Asiatic cities of Kius, Gergithus, Mylassa, and Elæa; showing all\r\nthe more eagerness to make him a present because he was angry at his\r\nformer refusal. Phokion however would not take them, and Alexander\r\nshortly afterwards died. The house of Phokion may be seen at the\r\npresent day in Melite.[632] It is adorned with plates of copper, but\r\notherwise is very plain and simple.\r\n\r\nXIX. We have no information about Phokion's first wife, except that\r\nshe was the sister of Kephisodotus the modeller in clay. His second\r\nwife was no less renowned in Athens for her simplicity of life then\r\nwas Phokion himself for his goodness. Once when the Athenians were\r\nwitnessing a new play, the actor who was to play the part of the king\r\ndemanded from the choragus a large troop of richly-attired attendants,\r\nand, as he did not obtain them, refused to appear upon the stage, and\r\nkept the audience waiting: At last Melanthius, the choragus, shoved\r\nhim on to the stage, exclaiming. \"Do you not see the wife of Phokion\r\nthere, who always goes about with only one maidservant to wait upon\r\nher, and are you going to give yourself ridiculous airs and lead our\r\nwives into extravagance?\" These words were heard by the audience, and\r\nwere received with great cheering and applause. Once, when an Ionian\r\nlady was displaying a coronet and necklace of gold and precious stones\r\nto her, she said, \"My only ornament is that this is the twentieth year\r\nthat Phokion has been elected general by the Athenians.\"\r\n\r\nXX. As his son Phokus wished to contend in the games at the\r\nPanathenaic Festival, he entered him for the horse race,[633] not\r\nbecause he cared about his winning the prize, but because he thought\r\nthat the youth, who was addicted to wine and of licentious life, would\r\nbe benefited by the strict training and exercise which he would have\r\nto undergo. The young man won the race, and was invited by many of his\r\nfriends to dine with them to celebrate his victory. Phokion excused\r\nhim to all but one, with whom he permitted him to dine in honour of\r\nhis success. When, however, he came to the dinner and saw footpans\r\nfilled with wine and aromatic herbs offered to the guests as they\r\nentered to wash their feet in, he turned to his son, and said,\r\n\"Phokus, why do you not prevent your friend from spoiling your\r\nvictory.\" As he wished to remove his son altogether from the influence\r\nof Athenian life he took him to Lacedæmon, and placed him with the\r\nyoung men who were undergoing the Spartan training there. The\r\nAthenians were vexed at this, because Phokion appeared to despise and\r\nundervalue the institutions of his own country. Once Demades said to\r\nhim \"Phokion, why should we not advise the Athenians to adopt the\r\nSpartan constitution; if you bid me, I am quite willing to make a\r\nspeech and bring forward a motion in the assembly for doing so.\"\r\n\"Indeed,\" answered Phokion \"it would suit a man who is scented like\r\nyou, and wears so rich a robe, to talk about plain Spartan fare and\r\nLykurgus to the Athenians!\"\r\n\r\nXXI. When Alexander wrote to the Athenians ordering them to send ships\r\nof war to him, some of the orators were against doing so, and the\r\nsenate asked Phokion to speak. \"I say,\" remarked he, \"that we ought\r\neither to conquer, or else to keep on good terms with our conqueror.\"\r\n\"When Pytheas first began to make speeches, as he was even then fluent\r\nand impudent, Phokion said, \"Will you not be silent, and remember that\r\nyou are only a newly-bought servant of the people.\" When Harpalus fled\r\nfrom Asia with a large amount of treasure and came to Athens, where\r\nall the venal politicians paid great court to him, he gave them but a\r\nvery small part of his hoard, but sent a present of seven hundred\r\ntalents to Phokion, placing all his other property and his person in\r\nhis hands. Phokion returned a rough answer, telling Harpalus that if\r\nhe continued corrupting the Athenians he would sorely repent of it.\r\nFor the moment Harpalus desisted from his offers, but shortly\r\nafterwards when the Athenians were met together in the assembly he\r\nobserved that those who had received his bribes all turned against him\r\nand spoke ill of him, that they might not be suspected, while Phokion,\r\nwho had taken nothing from him, nevertheless showed some interest in\r\nhis safety as well as in the welfare of Athens. Harpalus now was\r\ninduced to pay his court to him a second time, but after assailing him\r\non all sides found that he was impregnable by bribes. However Harpalus\r\nmade a friend and companion of his son-in-law Charikles, who entirely\r\nlost his reputation in consequence, as Harpalus entrusted him with the\r\nentire management of his affairs.\r\n\r\nXXII. Moreover, upon the death of Pythionike, the courtezan, whose\r\nlover Harpalus had been, and who had borne him a daughter, as he\r\ndesired to erect a very costly monument to her memory, he appointed\r\nCharikles[634] to superintend the building of it. Charikles was mean\r\nenough to accept this commission; and he incurred even more disgrace\r\nfrom the appearance of the tomb when it was completed. It stands at\r\nthe present day in the precinct of Hermes, on the road from Athens to\r\nEleusis, and cannot have cost anything like thirty talents, which sum\r\nis said to have been paid to Charikles by Harpalus for its\r\nconstruction. Besides this, after his death, his daughter was adopted\r\nby Charikles and Phokion, and received every attention from them.\r\nWhen, however, Charikles was prosecuted for having taken a share of\r\nthe treasure of Harpalus,[635] and begged Phokion to come into court\r\nand speak in his favour, Phokion refused, saying \"Charikles, I chose\r\nyou to be my son-in-law in all honesty.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Asklepiades, the son of Hipparchus, first brought the news of\r\nAlexander's death to Athens, Demades advised the people not to believe\r\nit. Such a corpse, he declared, must have been smelt throughout the\r\nworld. Phokion, seeing that the people were excited at the report,\r\nendeavoured to soothe and pacify them. Upon this many rushed to the\r\ntribune, and loudly declared that Asklepiades had brought true\r\ntidings, and that Alexander was really dead. \"If,\" replied Phokion,\r\n\"he is dead to-day, he will be dead to-morrow and the day after, so\r\nthat we may quietly, and with all the greater safety, take counsel as\r\nto what we are to do.\"\r\n\r\nXXIII. When Leosthenes plunged the city into the war[636] for the\r\nliberation of Greece, as Phokion opposed him, he sneeringly asked him\r\nwhat good he had done the city during the many years that he had been\r\ngeneral. \"No small good,\" retorted Phokion, \"I have caused the\r\nAthenians to be buried at home in their own sepulchres.\" As Leosthenes\r\nspoke in a boastful and confident manner before the public assembly,\r\nPhokion said, \"Your speeches, young man, are like cypress trees; they\r\nare tall and stately, but they bear no fruit.\" When Hypereides rose\r\nand asked Phokion when he would advise the Athenians to go to war;\r\n\"When,\" answered he, \"I see young men willing to observe discipline,\r\nthe rich subscribing to the expenses, and the orators leaving off\r\nembezzling the public funds.\" As many admired the force which\r\nLeosthenes got together, and inquired of Phokion whether he thought\r\nthat sufficient preparations had been made, he answered, \"Enough for\r\nthe short course; but I fear for Athens if the race of war is to be a\r\nlong one, since she has no reserves, either of money, ships, or men.\"\r\nThe events of the war bore out the justice of his remark; for at first\r\nLeosthenes was elated by his great success, as he defeated the\r\nBœotians in a pitched battle, and drove Antipater into Lamia. The\r\nAthenians were now full of hope, and did nothing but hold high\r\nfestival to welcome the good news, and offer sacrifices of\r\nthanksgiving to the gods. Phokion, however, when asked whether he did\r\nnot wish that he had done all this, answered, \"Certainly I do; but I\r\nwish that quite the contrary policy had been adopted.\" Again, when\r\ndespatch after despatch kept arriving from the camp, announcing fresh\r\nsuccesses, he said, \"I wonder when we shall leave off being\r\nvictorious.\"\r\n\r\nXXIV. After the death of Leosthenes, those who feared that, if Phokion\r\nwere made commander-in-chief, he would put an end to the war, suborned\r\nan obscure person to rise in the assembly and say that, as a friend\r\nand associate of Phokion, he should advise them to spare him, and keep\r\nhim safe, since they had no one else like him in Athens, and to send\r\nAntiphilus to command the army. The Athenians approved of this advice,\r\nbut Phokion came forward and declared that he had never associated\r\nwith the man, or had any acquaintance with him. \"From this day forth,\r\nhowever,\" said he, \"I regard you as my friend and companion, for you\r\nhave given advice which suits me.\" When the Athenians were eager to\r\ninvade Bœotia, he at first opposed them; and when some of his friends\r\ntold him that he would be put to death if he always thwarted the\r\nAthenians, he answered, \"I shall suffer death unjustly, if I tell them\r\nwhat is to their advantage, but justly if I do wrong.\" When he saw\r\nthat they would not give up the project, but excitedly insisted on it,\r\nhe bade the herald proclaim that all Athenians who had arrived at\r\nmanhood[637] from sixty years and under, should take provisions for\r\nfive days and follow him to Bœotia at once. Upon this a great\r\ndisturbance took place, as the older citizens leaped to their feet,\r\nand clamoured loudly. \"There is nothing strange in the proclamation,\"\r\nsaid Phokion, \"for I, who am eighty years of age, shall be with you as\r\nyour general.\" Thus he managed to quiet them, and induced them to give\r\nup their intention.\"\r\n\r\nXXV. As the seaboard of Attica was being plundered by Mikion, who had\r\nlanded at Rhamnus[638] with a large force of Macedonians and mercenary\r\nsoldiers, and was overrunning the country, Phokion led out the\r\nAthenians to attack him. As men kept running up to him and pestering\r\nhim with advice, to seize this hill, to despatch his cavalry in that\r\ndirection, to make his attack in this other place, he said \"Herakles,\r\nhow many generals I see, and how few soldiers.\" While he was arraying\r\nhis hoplites in line, one of them advanced a long way in front, and\r\nthen, fearing one of the enemy, retired. \"Young man,\" said Phokion,\r\n\"are you not ashamed of having deserted two posts, that in which you\r\nwere placed by your general and that in which you placed yourself?\" He\r\nnow charged the enemy and overthrew them, slaying Mikion himself and\r\nmany others. Meanwhile the Greek army in Thessaly fought a battle with\r\nLeonnatus, who was coming[639] to join Antipater with a Macedonian\r\narmy from Asia. Antiphilus led the infantry and Menon, a Thessalian,\r\nthe cavalry. In the battle Leonnatus himself was slain, and his troops\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\nXXVI. Shortly afterwards Kraterus crossed over from Asia with a large\r\nforce, and a second battle took place at Krannon.[640] The Greeks were\r\ndefeated, but not in a crushing manner or with much loss. Yet, as the\r\nGreek commanders were young men, unable to maintain discipline, and,\r\nas at the same time, Antipater was tampering with the loyalty of the\r\ncities from which the army came, the whole force broke up, and most\r\ndisgracefully betrayed the cause of Grecian liberty. Antipater at once\r\nmarched upon Athens with his army. Demosthenes and Hypereides at once\r\nfled from Athens, but Demades, who had not been able to pay any part\r\nof the money which he had been condemned to pay to the state (for he\r\nhad been convicted of making illegal proposals[641] on seven separate\r\noccasions, and had become disfranchised and disqualified from\r\naddressing the people), now set the laws at defiance, and proposed\r\nthat ambassadors, with full powers, should be sent to Antipater to sue\r\nfor peace. The people were greatly alarmed, and called upon Phokion,\r\nsaying that they could trust no one else. \"If I had always been\r\ntrusted,\" said he, \"we should not now be discussing such matters as\r\nthese.\" The motion was carried, and Phokion was sent to Antipater, who\r\nwas encamped in the Kadmeia of Thebes, and preparing to invade Attica.\r\nPhokion's first request was that he would stay where he was and\r\narrange terms. Upon hearing this Kraterus said, \"Phokion advises us to\r\ndo what is unjust, when he bids us remain here, doing evil to the\r\ncountry of our friends and allies, while we might do ourselves good\r\nin that of our enemies.\" Antipater, however, seized him by the hand\r\nand said, \"We must yield to Phokion in this.\" With regard to terms, he\r\nsaid that he required the same terms from the Athenians which\r\nLeosthenes had demanded from himself at Lamia.\r\n\r\nXXVII. When Phokion returned to Athens, as the people had no choice\r\nbut to submit to these terms, he went back again to Thebes with the\r\nother ambassadors;[642] for the Athenians had appointed the\r\nphilosopher Xenokrates[643] as an additional ambassador, because his\r\nvirtue, wisdom, and intellectual power was so renowned that they\r\nimagined that no man's heart could be so arrogant, cruel, and savage\r\nas not to be touched by some feeling of reverence and awe at the sight\r\nof Xenokrates.\r\n\r\nHowever, their expectations were entirely disappointed by the\r\nignorance and hatred of good men displayed by Antipater. In the first\r\nplace, though he shook hands with the others, he bestowed no greeting\r\nupon Xenokrates; upon which Xenokrates is said to have remarked that\r\nAntipater did well in showing that he felt shame before him for the\r\ntreatment which he was about to inflict upon the city. After this\r\nXenokrates began to make him a speech, but Antipater would not suffer\r\nhim to proceed, and by rude interruptions reduced him to silence.\r\nAfter Phokion and Demades had spoken, Antipater stated his willingness\r\nto make peace and become an ally of the Athenians, if they would\r\ndeliver up Demosthenes, Hypereides, and some other orators to\r\nhim,[644] re-establish their original government, in which the\r\nmagistrates were chosen according to property, receive a garrison in\r\nMunychia, and pay the whole expenses of the war, besides a fine. The\r\nambassadors thought that they ought to be contented and thankful for\r\nthese terms, with the exception of Xenokrates, who said, \"If Antipater\r\nlooks upon us as slaves, the terms are moderate; if as free men, they\r\nare severe.\"[645] When Phokion earnestly begged Antipater not to send\r\na garrison to Athens, he is said to have said in reply, \"Phokion, I am\r\nwilling to grant you any request you please, unless it be one which\r\nwould be fatal both to you and to myself.\" Some say that this is not\r\nthe true version of the incident, but that Antipater enquired of\r\nPhokion whether, if he did not place a garrison in Athens, Phokion\r\nwould guarantee that the city would abide by the terms of the peace,\r\nand not intrigue with a view of regaining its independence: and as\r\nPhokion was silent and hesitated how to reply, Kallimedon, surnamed\r\n'the crab' a man of a fierce and anti-democratical temper, exclaimed:\r\n\"If, Antipater, this man should talk nonsense, will you believe him,\r\nand not do what you have decided upon?\"\r\n\r\nXXVIII. Thus it came to pass that the Athenians received into their\r\ncity a Macedonian garrison, whose commander was Menyllus, an amiable\r\nman and a friend of Phokion himself. It was thought that the sending\r\nof the garrison was a mere piece of arrogance on Antipater's part, and\r\nto be more due to an insolent desire to show the extent of his power\r\nthan to any real necessity. The time, too, at which it was sent,\r\nrendered its arrival especially galling to the Athenians: for it was\r\nduring the celebration of the mysteries, on the twentieth day of the\r\nmonth Bœdromion, that the garrison entered the city. On that day,\r\nIacchus used to be carried in procession from Athens to Eleusis, but\r\nnow the whole ritual was marred, and the Athenians sadly contrasted\r\nthis celebration of the mysteries with those of former years. In\r\nearlier times,[646] when the city was powerful and flourishing, the\r\nsplendid spectacle of the celebration of the mysteries used to strike\r\nawe and terror into the hearts of the enemies of Athens, but now at\r\nthese same rites the gods seemed to look on unmoved at the disasters\r\nof Greece, while the most sacred season was desecrated, and that which\r\nhad been the pleasantest time of the year now served merely to remind\r\nthem of their greatest misfortunes. A few years before this, the\r\npriestesses of Dodona had sent an oracular warning to Athens, bidding\r\nthe Athenians guard the extremities of Artemis. In those days the\r\nfillets which are wound round the couches of the gods which are\r\ncarried in the mysteries were dyed of a yellow instead of a crimson\r\ncolour, and presented a corpse-like appearance, and, what was more\r\nremarkable, the fillets dyed by private persons at the same time, all\r\nwere of the same colour. One of the initiated also, while washing a\r\nlittle pig in the harbour of Kantharus,[647] was seized by a shark,\r\nwho swallowed all the lower part of his body. By this portent, Heaven\r\nclearly intimated to the Athenians that they were to lose the lower\r\npart of their city, and their command of the sea, but to keep the\r\nupper part. As for the Macedonian garrison, Menyllus took care that\r\nthe Athenians suffered no inconvenience from it; but more than twelve\r\nthousand of the citizens were disfranchised under the new\r\nconstitution, on account of their poverty. Of these men, those who\r\nremained in Athens were thought to have been shamefully ill treated,\r\nwhile those who left the city in consequence of this measure and\r\nproceeded to Thrace, where Antipater provided them with a city and\r\nwith territory, looked like the inhabitants of a town which has been\r\ntaken by storm.\r\n\r\nXXIX. The deaths of Demosthenes at Kalauria, and of Hypereides at\r\nKleonæ, which I have recounted elsewhere, very nearly led the\r\nAthenians to look back with regret upon the days of Alexander and\r\nPhilip. In later times, after Antigonus had been assassinated, and his\r\nmurderers had begun a career of violence and extortion, some one\r\nseeing a countryman in Phrygia digging in the ground, asked him what\r\nhe was doing, the man replied with a sigh, \"I am seeking for\r\nAntigonus.\" Just so at this time it recurred to many to reflect on the\r\nnoble and placable character of those princes, and to contrast them\r\nwith Antipater, who, although he pretended to be only a private\r\ncitizen, wore shabby clothes, and lived on humble fare, really\r\ntyrannized over the Athenians in their distress more grievously than\r\neither of them.\r\n\r\nPhokion, however, managed to save many from exile, by supplicating\r\nAntipater on their behalf, and in the case of the exiles he obtained\r\nthis much favour, that they were not transported quite out of Greece,\r\nbeyond the Keraunian mountains and Cape Tænarus, as were the exiles\r\nfrom the other Greek cities, but were settled in Peloponnesus. Among\r\nthese was Hagnonides, the informer. Phokion now devoted his attention\r\nto the management of the internal politics of Athens in a quiet and\r\nlaw-abiding fashion. He contrived to have good and sensible men always\r\nappointed as magistrates, and by excluding the noisy and revolutionary\r\nparty from the public offices, made them less inclined to create a\r\ndisturbance, and taught them to be content with their country as it\r\nwas, and to turn their minds to agricultural pursuits. When he saw\r\nXenokrates paying his tax as a resident alien, he wished to enrol him\r\nas a citizen; but Xenokrates refused, saying that he would not put\r\nhimself under the new constitution after he had gone on an embassy to\r\nprevent its being established.\r\n\r\nXXX. When Menyllus offered him presents, Phokion replied that he did\r\nnot consider him to be a better man than Alexander, and saw no greater\r\nreason why he should accept a present now than when Alexander offered\r\nit to him. As Menyllus begged his son Phokus to accept it, Phokion\r\nsaid, \"If Phokus alters his nature, and becomes frugal, his father's\r\nproperty will be enough for him; but, as it is, nothing will satisfy\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave a sharp reply to Antipater, who asked him to perform some\r\ndisgraceful service for him. \"I cannot,\" said he, \"be Antipater's\r\nfriend and his toady at the same time.\"\r\n\r\nAntipater himself is said to have remarked that he had two friends at\r\nAthens, Phokion and Demades, the one of whom he could not persuade to\r\ntake a bribe, while the other took bribes and never was satisfied.\r\nPhokion indeed considered it a great proof of his virtue that he had\r\ngrown old in poverty, after having so many times been elected general\r\nof the Athenians, and having been the friend of kings; while Demades\r\nopenly prided himself both upon his wealth and his contempt for the\r\nlaws. Although there was a law in force at Athens at that period,\r\nwhich forbade foreigners to appear in a chorus, and imposed a fine of\r\none thousand drachmas upon the choragus who allowed them to do so,\r\nDemades exhibited a chorus of one hundred foreigners, and publicly\r\npaid in the theatre a fine of a thousand drachmas for each of them. On\r\nthe occasion of the marriage of his son Demeas, he said, \"My boy, when\r\nI married your mother, our next-door neighbours heard nothing of it;\r\nbut kings and potentates shall attend your nuptials.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the Athenians tormented Phokion with requests that he would\r\nuse his influence with Antipater to get the Macedonian garrison\r\nwithdrawn, he always contrived to postpone making this application,\r\neither because he knew that it would not be granted, or because he\r\nthought that the fear of the Macedonian troops compelled the Athenians\r\nto live in a quiet and orderly fashion; but, on the other hand, he\r\ninduced Antipater to postpone indefinitely his demand for money from\r\nthe city. The Athenians now betook themselves to Demades, who eagerly\r\npromised his services, and, together with his son, started for\r\nMacedonia, to which country it seems as if he was brought by the\r\ndirect agency of the gods at a time when Antipater was on a sick bed,\r\nand Kassander, who was now at the head of affairs, had discovered a\r\nletter addressed by Demades to Antigonus in Asia, inviting him to\r\ncross over into Greece and Macedonia, and free them from their\r\ndependence on an old and rotten warp[648] -by which expression he\r\nmeant to sneer at Antipater. As soon as Kassander saw Demades arrive\r\nin Macedonia he had him arrested, and first led his son close to him\r\nand then stabbed him, so that his robe was covered with his son's\r\nblood, and then, after bitterly upbraiding him with his ingratitude\r\nand treason, killed him also.\r\n\r\nXXXI. Antipater on his death-bed appointed Polysperchon to the supreme\r\ncommand, and gave Kassander the post of chiliarch, or general of the\r\nbody guard. Kassander, however, instantly began to plot against\r\nPolysperchon, and taking time by the forelock, sent Nikanor in haste\r\nto supersede Menyllus, before the news of the death of Antipater\r\nbecame publicly known, with orders to make himself master of\r\nMunychia. This was done, and when after a few days the Athenians heard\r\nthat Antipater was dead they blamed Phokion, insinuating that he had\r\nbeen told of the death of Antipater, but said nothing about it, and so\r\nencouraged the designs of Nikanor. Phokion took no notice of this\r\nscandalous talk, but put himself in communication with Nikanor, and\r\nprevailed upon him to treat the Athenians with mildness, and even\r\ninduced him to act as president of the games, in the performance of\r\nwhich office he took considerable pride and incurred some expense.\r\n\r\nXXXII. Meanwhile Polysperchon, who was now regent of the Macedonian\r\nempire, and had put down Kassander, sent a letter to the Athenians to\r\nthe effect that \"the king restored the democracy at Athens, and bade\r\nthe Athenians govern themselves according to the customs of their\r\nfathers.\" This was merely a trick to ruin Phokion, for Polysperchon,\r\nwhose design, as his acts shortly afterwards proved, was to gain over\r\nthe city of Athens to his side, had no hopes of succeeding in this\r\nunless Phokion were driven out of Athens; while he expected that\r\nPhokion would be driven out when all the exiled citizens returned, and\r\nwhen the informers and mob orators again occupied the bema. As the\r\nAthenians were excited at this intelligence, Nikanor desired to\r\ndiscuss the matter with them, and appeared at a conference held in\r\nPeiræus, having received from Phokion a pledge for his personal\r\nsafety. Derkyllus, the local commander, tried to seize him, but\r\nNikanor escaped, and at once began to take measures for the defence of\r\nPeiræus against the Athenians. Phokion, when blamed for having\r\npermitted Nikanor to escape, answered that he felt confidence in\r\nNikanor, and did not expect that he would do any harm; and even if he\r\ndid, he preferred suffering wrong to doing it. This was no doubt a\r\nmost magnanimous sentiment; but when a man on such grounds risks the\r\nfreedom of his country, especially when he is acting as general, I am\r\ninclined to think that he breaks an older and more important law,\r\nthat, namely, of his duty to his fellow-citizens. We cannot argue that\r\nPhokion refrained from seizing Nikanor because he feared to involve\r\nhis country in war, and it was absurd of him to plead that good faith\r\nand justice demanded that Nikanor should be left alone, on the\r\nunderstanding that he would feel bound to abstain from any acts of\r\nviolence. The real truth seems to have been that Phokion had a firm\r\nbelief in Nikanor's honesty, since he refused to believe those who\r\ntold him that Nikanor was plotting the capture of Peiræus, and had\r\nsent Macedonian soldiers into Salamis, and had even corrupted some of\r\nthe inhabitants in Peiræus itself. Even when Philomelus of Lamptra\r\nmoved a resolution that all Athenians should get under arms and be\r\nready to follow their general Phokion, he refused to act, until\r\nNikanor marched his troops out of Munychia and fortified Peiræus with\r\na trench and palisade.\r\n\r\nXXXIII. When this took place Phokion, who was now quite willing to\r\nlead the Athenians to attack Nikanor, was insulted and treated with\r\ncontempt; and now Alexander the son of Polysperchon arrived with a\r\nmilitary force, nominally with the intention of assisting the citizens\r\nagainst Nikanor, but really meaning if possible to make himself master\r\nof the city while it was divided against itself. The exiled Athenians\r\nwho accompanied him at once entered the city, and as the disfranchised\r\ninhabitants joined them, a disorderly and informal assembly was held,\r\nin which Phokion was removed from his office, and other men were\r\nappointed generals. Had it not been that Alexander and Nikanor were\r\nobserved to hold frequent conferences together alone outside the\r\nwalls, the city could not have been saved. Hagnonides the informer now\r\nat once began to accuse Phokion and his party of treason; upon which\r\nCharikles and Kallimedon left the city in terror, while Phokion and\r\nthose of his friends who stood by him proceeded to Polysperchon\r\nhimself. They were accompanied, out of regard for Phokion, by Solon of\r\nPlatæa and Deinarchus of Corinth, who were thought to be intimate\r\nfriends of Polysperchon. As Deinarchus was sick, they waited for some\r\ndays at Elatea, and in the meantime, at the instigation of Hagnonides,\r\nalthough Archestratus brought forward the motion for it in the\r\nassembly, the Athenians sent an embassy to the court of Macedonia to\r\naccuse Phokion of treason. Both met Polysperchon at the same time, as\r\nhe with the king[649] was passing through a village of Phokis named\r\nPharyges, which lies at the foot of the Akrousian mountain, now called\r\nGalate. Here Polysperchon set up the throne with the gilt ceiling,\r\nunder which he placed the king and his friends. He ordered Deinarchus\r\nat once to be seized, tortured, and put to death, but he allowed the\r\nAthenians to plead their cause before him. They however made a great\r\ndisturbance by contradicting and abusing one another, so that\r\nHagnonides said, \"Pack us all into one cage and send us back to Athens\r\nto be tried.\" At this the king laughed, but the Macedonians and others\r\nwho were present wished to hear what each side had to say, and bade\r\nthe two embassies state their case. They were not, however, fairly\r\ntreated, for Polysperchon several times interrupted Phokion during his\r\nspeech, until at last he struck the ground with his staff in a rage\r\nand held his peace. When Hegemon[650] too said that Polysperchon\r\nhimself knew him to be a friend to the people of Athens, Polysperchon\r\nangrily exclaimed \"Do not slander me to the king.\" At this the king\r\nhimself leaped to his feet, and would have struck Hegemon with a\r\nspear, but was quickly seized by Polysperchon, upon which the court\r\nbroke up.\r\n\r\nXXXIV. Phokion and his companions were now taken into custody: upon\r\nwhich such of his friends as saw this from a distance covered their\r\nfaces with their cloaks and made their escape. Kleitus conducted the\r\nprisoners back to Athens, nominally to be tried there, but really\r\nalready under sentence of death. The procession was a sad one, as they\r\nwere brought in carts through the Kerameikus to the theatre, where\r\nKleitus kept them until the archons had convened the assembly. From\r\nthis assembly neither slaves, foreigners, nor disfranchised citizens\r\nwere excluded, but every one, men and women alike, were allowed to be\r\npresent and to address the people. After the king's letter was read,\r\nin which he said that he was convinced that these men were traitors,\r\nbut sent them to Athens for trial because that city was free and\r\nindependent, Kleitus brought in the prisoners. At the sight of Phokion\r\nthe better class of citizens covered their faces and silently wept,\r\nand one of them had the courage to rise and say that, as the king had\r\nallowed the Athenian people to conduct so important a trial, all\r\nslaves and foreigners ought to leave the assembly. The populace,\r\nhowever, would not hear of this, but cried, \"Down with the oligarchs\r\nwho hate the people.\" As no other friend of Phokion dared to speak, he\r\nhimself, after obtaining a hearing with difficulty, asked \"Do you wish\r\nto condemn us to death justly or unjustly?\" As some answered \"justly,\"\r\nhe said, \"How can you be sure of this, if you will not hear us?\" As\r\nhowever the people paid no more attention to him, he came nearer to\r\nthem and said, \"For my own part, I admit that I have done wrong, and I\r\nconsider that my political acts deserve to be punished with death;\r\nbut, men of Athens, why will you kill these others, who have done no\r\nwrong?\" When many voices answered, \"Because they are your friends,\"\r\nPhokion retired and held his peace. Hagnonides now read the motion\r\nwhich he was about to put to the meeting which called upon the people\r\nto decide by a show of hands whether the men were guilty or not; and\r\nin case they were found guilty, to put them to death.\r\n\r\nXXXV. When this decree was read some wished to add to it that they\r\nshould be put to death with torture, and bade Hagnonides send for the\r\nrack and the executioners; but Hagnonides, seeing that even the\r\nMacedonian Kleitus was disgusted at this proposal, and thought it a\r\nsavage and wicked action, said, \"Men of Athens, when we catch the\r\nvillain Kallimedon, we will put him to the torture; but I will make no\r\nsuch proposal in the case of Phokion.\" Upon this one of the better\r\nclass cried out, \"And quite right too; for if we torture Phokion, what\r\nshall we do to you?\" When the decree was passed by show of hands, no\r\none sat still, but the whole people, many of them wearing garlands of\r\nflowers, rose and voted for the death of the accused. These, besides\r\nPhokion, consisted of Nikokles, Thodippus, Hegemon, and Pythokles:\r\nwhile sentence of death in their absence was passed against Demetrius\r\nPhalereus, Kallimedon, Charikles, and some others.\r\n\r\nXXXVI. When after the assembly broke up the condemned men were being\r\ntaken to prison, the others threw themselves into the arms of their\r\nfriends and relations, and walked along with tears and lamentations;\r\nbut when they saw that the countenance of Phokion was as calm as when\r\nhe used as general to be conducted in state out of the assembly, they\r\nwondered at his composure and greatness of soul. His enemies\r\naccompanied him and abused him, and one even came up to him and spat\r\nin his face. At this outrage it is said that Phokion looked towards\r\nthe archons, and said, \"Will no one make this fellow behave himself?\"\r\nAs Thodippus in prison, when he saw the hemlock being prepared,\r\nbewailed his fate, and said that he did not deserve to perish with\r\nPhokion, Phokion said, \"Are you not satisfied then to die in Phokion's\r\ncompany?\" When one of his friends asked him if he had any message for\r\nhis son Phokus, he answered, \"Yes, tell him not to bear any malice\r\nagainst the Athenians.\" When Nikokles, the most trusty of his friends,\r\nbegged to be allowed to drink the poison before him, he answered,\r\n\"Your request is one which it grieves me to grant; but, as I have\r\nnever refused you anything in your life, I agree even to this.\" When\r\nall his friends had drunk, the poison ran short, and the executioner\r\nrefused to prepare any more unless he were paid twelve drachmas, the\r\nprice of that weight of hemlock. After a long delay, Phokion called\r\none of his friends to him, and, saying that it was hard if a man could\r\nnot even die gratis at Athens, bade him give the man the money he\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nXXXVII. The day of Phokion's death was the nineteenth of the month\r\nMunychion,[651] and the knights rode past the prison in solemn\r\nprocession to the temple of Zeus. Some of them took off their garlands\r\nfrom their heads, while others came in tears to the gates of the\r\nprison and looked in. All whose better feelings were not utterly\r\noverpowered by passion and hatred agreed in thinking it a very\r\nindecent proceeding not to have waited one day for the execution, and\r\nso to have avoided the pollution of the festival by the death of the\r\nprisoners. Moreover, the enemies of Phokion, as if they had not even\r\nyet satisfied their spite, passed a decree excluding his body from\r\nburial, and forbidding any Athenian to furnish fire to burn it. In\r\nconsequence of this, no one of his friends dared to touch the body,\r\nbut one Konopion, a man who was accustomed to deal with such cases for\r\nhire, conveyed the body beyond Eleusis, obtained fire from Megara over\r\nthe Attic frontier, and burned it. Phokion's wife, who was present\r\nwith her maids, raised an empty tomb[652] on the spot, placed the\r\nbones in her bosom, and carried them by night into her own house,\r\nwhere she buried them beside the hearth, saying, \"To thee, dear\r\nhearth, I entrust these remains of a good man; do you restore them to\r\nhis fathers' tomb when the Athenians recover their senses.\"\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. After a short time, however, when circumstances had taught\r\nthem what a protector and guardian of virtue they had lost, the\r\nAthenians set up a brazen statue of Phokion, and gave his remains a\r\npublic burial. They themselves condemned and executed Hagnonides,\r\nwhile Phokion's son followed Epikurus and Demophilus, who fled the\r\ncountry, discovered their place of refuge, and avenged himself upon\r\nthem. He is said to have been far from respectable in character; and\r\nonce, when attached to a common prostitute, who was the slave of a\r\nbrothel-keeper, he happened to attend one of the lectures of\r\nTheodorus, who was surnamed \"the atheist,\" in the Lyceum. As he heard\r\nhim say that \"if it be noble to ransom one's male friends from\r\ncaptivity, it must be equally so to ransom one's female friends; and\r\nthat, if it be right for a man to set free the man whom he loves, it\r\nmust be his duty to do likewise to the woman whom he loves,\" he\r\ndetermined to use this argument for the gratification of his own\r\npassion, and to conclude that the philosopher bade him purchase the\r\nfreedom of his mistress.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of Phokion reminded the Greeks of that of Sokrates, as\r\nboth the crime and the misfortune of the city in both cases was almost\r\nexactly the same.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 622: Cic. ad Att. ii. 1.

Cato's family derived the origin of its splendour and reputation\r\nfrom his great-grandfather[653] Cato, a man who had reputation and\r\npower chief among the Romans by reason of his merit, as it has been\r\nwritten in his Life. Cato was left an orphan with his brother Cæpio\r\nand a sister Porcia. Servilia also was a sister of Cato by the same\r\nmother. All of them were brought up and lived with Livius Drusus,[654]\r\ntheir mother's uncle, who was then the chief political leader; for he\r\nwas a most powerful speaker, and also a man of the best regulated\r\nhabits, and in lofty bearing inferior to no Roman. It is said that\r\nCato from his childhood both in his voice and the expression of his\r\ncountenance and even in his amusements gave indication of a character\r\nimmovable and impassive and firm in everything. His purposes displayed\r\na strength in accomplishing his ends which was above his age: and\r\nwhile he was rough and stubborn towards those who attempted to flatter\r\nhim, still more did he show his mastery over all who would try to\r\nterrify him by threats. He was also difficult to move to laughter, and\r\nhis countenance was seldom relaxed even into a smile; he was not quick\r\nnor prone to anger, but when he had been moved to anger, he was hard\r\nto pacify. Accordingly when he began to learn, he was dull and slow to\r\nconceive, but when he had conceived, he held fast and remembered well.\r\nAnd it is generally the case that those who have a good natural\r\ncapacity are more ready at recollection,[655] but those have a strong\r\nmemory who learn with labour and trouble; for all learning is in a\r\nmanner a branding on the mind. It appears too that Cato's difficulty\r\nof persuasion made learning a matter of more labour to him; for\r\nlearning is in truth a kind of passive condition, and to be easily\r\npersuaded is incident to those who have less power of resistance. It\r\nis for this reason that young men are more easily persuaded than old\r\nmen, and sick persons than those who are whole; and generally, with\r\nthose in whom the doubting faculty is weakest, that which is proposed\r\nmeets the readiest acceptance. However, they say that Cato was\r\nobedient to his pædagogus and did everything that he was bid, but he\r\nwould ask for the reason of everything, and inquire the Why. His\r\npædagogus also was a good-tempered man, and was readier at a reason\r\nthan a blow: his name was Sarpedon.\r\n\r\nII. While Cato was still a boy, the Allies[656] of the Romans were\r\nagitating to obtain the Roman franchise; and a certain Pompædius\r\nSillo,[657] a man of military talent and of the highest repute, and a\r\nfriend of Drusus, lodged with him several days, during which he became\r\nfamiliar with the youths, and he said, \"Come now, pray your uncle on\r\nour behalf to exert himself to get the franchise for us.\" Now, Cæpio\r\nwith a smile nodded assent, but as Cato made no answer and looked on\r\nthe strangers steadily and sternly, Pompædius said, \"But you, young\r\nman, what reply have you for us? Can you not help the strangers with\r\nyour uncle, like your brother?\" As Cato still would not speak, but by\r\nhis silence and his expression showed that he rejected their entreaty,\r\nPompædius took him up and holding him through the window as if he\r\nintended to drop him down, told him either to assent or he would let\r\nhim fall, and at the same time he assumed an angry tone and several\r\ntimes he swung the boy backwards and forwards as he held him in his\r\nhands. Now, when Cato had borne this for some time, unmoved and\r\nfearless, Pompædius gently putting him down said to his friends, \"What\r\na blessing[658] to Italy that he is a child; for if he were a man, I\r\ndo not think we should have a single vote among the people.\" On\r\nanother occasion when a kinsman on his birthday invited to supper\r\nother boys and Cato with them, in order to pass the time they played\r\nin a part of the house by themselves, younger and older mixed\r\ntogether; and the game consisted of trials, and accusations, and\r\ncarrying off those who were convicted. Now, one of the boys convicted,\r\nwho was of a handsome presence, being dragged off by an older boy to a\r\nchamber and shut up, called on Cato for aid. Cato soon perceiving what\r\nwas going on came to the door, and pushing through those who were\r\nstanding before it and endeavouring to stop him, took the boy out; and\r\nin a passion he went off home with him and other boys accompanied him.\r\n\r\nIII. Cato was so much talked of that when Sulla was preparing for\r\nexhibition the sacred horse race called Troja,[659] in which youths\r\nare the actors, and had got together the boys of noble birth and\r\nappointed two captains, the boys submitted to the one for his mother's\r\nsake, for he was a son of Metella, Sulla's wife; but the other, who\r\nwas a nephew of Pompeius and named Sextus, they would not have, nor\r\nwould they go through their exercise nor follow him; and on Sulla\r\nasking whom they would have, they all called out \"Cato,\" and Sextus\r\nhimself gave way and yielded the honour to Cato as his better. It\r\nhappened that Sulla was an old friend of Cato's family, and sometimes\r\nhe had the children brought to him and talked with them, a kind of\r\nfriendship which he showed to few, by reason of the weight and state\r\nof the office and power that he held. Sarpedon considering this a\r\ngreat matter both as regarded the honour and security of the youth,\r\nconstantly took Cato to pay his respects to Sulla at his house, which\r\nat that time to all outward appearance differed not from a place of\r\ntorture for criminals,[660] so great was the number of those who were\r\ndragged there and put to the rack. Cato was at this time in his\r\nfourteenth year, and seeing the heads of persons who were said to be\r\nmen of distinction brought out, and those who were present lamenting\r\ninwardly, he asked his pædagogus why nobody killed this man. Sarpedon\r\nreplied, \"Because they fear him, child, more than they hate him.\"\r\n\"Why, then,\" said Cato, \"do you not give me a sword that I might kill\r\nhim, and so free my country from slavery?\" Hearing these words and at\r\nthe same time observing his eyes and countenance to be filled with\r\npassion and resolve, Sarpedon was so afraid that henceforward he kept\r\na close look and watch upon him, that he should not venture on any\r\ndesperate measure. Now when he was still a little boy, and some\r\npersons asked him whom he loved most, he replied his brother; when he\r\nwas asked whom he loved next, he gave the same answer, his brother;\r\nand so on to the third question, until the questioner was tired out by\r\nalways getting the same answer. When he arrived at man's estate, he\r\nstrengthened still more his affection to his brother; for when he was\r\ntwenty years of age he never supped, he never went abroad, never came\r\ninto the Forum without Cæpio. When Cæpio used perfumes, Cato would\r\nnot have them; and in all other respects he was strict and frugal in\r\nhis way of living. Accordingly Cæpio, who was admired for his\r\ntemperance and moderation, admitted that he was indeed temperate and\r\nmoderate when contrasted with others, \"but,\" said he, \"when I compare\r\nmy life with Cato's, I seem to myself to differ not at all from\r\nSippius;\" which was the name of a man notorious at that time for\r\nluxury and effeminacy.\r\n\r\nIV. After Cato obtained the priesthood[661] of Apollo, he changed his\r\nresidence, and taking his portion of his paternal property, which\r\nportion was a hundred and twenty talents, he contracted his style of\r\nliving still further, and making his companion of Antipater[662] of\r\nTyrus, a Stoic, he attached himself mainly to Ethical and Political\r\nstudies, occupying himself with every virtue as if he were possessed\r\nby some divine influence; but above all that part of the beautiful\r\nwhich consists in steady adherence to justice and in inflexibility\r\ntowards partiality or favour was his great delight. He disciplined\r\nhimself also in the kind of speaking which works upon numbers,\r\nconsidering that, as in a great state, so in political philosophy,\r\nthere should be nurtured with it something of the contentious quality.\r\nYet he did not practise his exercises in company with others, nor did\r\nany one hear him when he was declaiming; but to one of his companions\r\nwho observed, \"Men find fault, Cato, with your silence,\" he replied,\r\n\"I only hope they may not find fault with my life. But I will begin to\r\nspeak, when I am not going to say something that were better unsaid.\"\r\n\r\nV. The Basilica[663] called Porcia was a censorial dedication of the\r\nold Cato. Now, as the tribunes were accustomed to transact business\r\nhere, and there was a pillar which was considered to be in the way of\r\ntheir seats, they resolved to take it away or to remove it to another\r\nspot. This was the first occasion that brought Cato into the Forum,\r\nand against his will; for he opposed the tribunes, and he gained\r\nadmiration by this sample of his eloquence and elevated character. His\r\nspeech contained nothing juvenile or artificial, but it was\r\nstraightforward, full to overflowing, and rough. However there was\r\ndiffused over the roughness of the sentiments a charm which led the\r\near, and his own character intermingled with it gave to the dignity of\r\nhis address a certain pleasingness and placidity, that were not ill\r\ncalculated to win men's favour. His voice was loud and powerful enough\r\nto reach to so large a multitude, and it had a strength and tone which\r\ncould neither be broken nor tired; for he often spoke for a whole day\r\nwithout being wearied. On this occasion he got the better in the\r\nmatter in dispute, and then again wrapped himself up in silence and\r\nhis discipline. He used to harden his body by vigorous exercises,\r\ntraining himself to endure both heat and snow with uncovered head, and\r\nto walk along the roads in all seasons without a vehicle. His friends\r\nwho used to accompany him on his journeys employed horses, and Cato\r\nwould often go side by side with each of them in turns, and talk to\r\nthem, himself walking while they rode. He showed in his complaints\r\nalso wonderful endurance and self-denial; for when he had a fever, he\r\nwould spend the day quite alone without permitting any person to\r\napproach him, until he felt certain relief, and that the disease was\r\ngoing away.\r\n\r\nVI. At entertainments he used to cast lots for the parts, and if he\r\nfailed, and his friends urged him to begin first, he would say that it\r\nwas not right to do so against the will of Venus.[664] And at first he\r\nwould get up from supper after drinking once, but in course of time\r\nhe stuck to drinking more than anybody, so that he often continued\r\nover his wine till daybreak. His friends said that the cause of this\r\nwas the administration and public affairs, in which Cato being engaged\r\nall day and hindered from literary pursuits, associated with\r\nphilosophers during the night and over his cups. Accordingly when one\r\nMemmius[665] observed in company that Cato was intoxicated all night\r\nlong, Cicero rejoined, \"But you do not say that he also plays at dice\r\nall day long.\" Altogether Cato thought that he ought to walk a course\r\nthe opposite to the then modes of life and usages, which he considered\r\nto be bad and to require a great change, and observing that a purple\r\ndress of a deep bright was much in fashion, he himself wore the dark.\r\nHe would go into public without shoes and tunic after dinner, not\r\nseeking for reputation by the strangeness of the practice, but\r\nhabituating himself to be ashamed only of what was shameful, and to\r\ndespise everything else as indifferent. The inheritance of his cousin\r\nCato of the value of a hundred talents having been added to his\r\nproperty, he turned it into money and let any of his friends make use\r\nof it who needed, without paying interest. Some also pledged to the\r\ntreasury both lands and slaves of his, which Cato himself offered for\r\nthis purpose and confirmed the pledge.\r\n\r\nVII. When he considered that he was ripe for marriage, without ever\r\nhaving had to do with any woman, he betrothed Lepida, who had before\r\nbeen promised in marriage to Scipio Metellus,[666] but at that time\r\nwas disengaged, for Scipio had repudiated her, and the betrothment was\r\ncancelled. However before the marriage Scipio again changed his mind,\r\nand by using every exertion got the maid. Cato, who was greatly\r\nirritated and stung, made preparation to prosecute the matter in legal\r\nform, but on his friends preventing him, in his passion and youthful\r\nfervour he betook himself to iambic verses and vented much injurious\r\nlanguage upon Scipio, employing the bitterness of Archilochus,[667]\r\nbut dropping his ungoverned licence and childish manner. He married\r\nAtilia,[668] the daughter of Soranus, and this was the first woman\r\nwith whom he came together, but not the only woman, like Lælius[669]\r\nthe companion of Scipio; for Lælius was more fortunate in having known\r\nduring his long life only one woman and that his wife.\r\n\r\nVIII. When the Servile War[670] was on foot, which they called the war\r\nof Spartacus, Gellius was commander, but Cato joined the service as a\r\nvolunteer for his brother's sake, for his brother Cæpio was a tribune.\r\nHe had not indeed the opportunity of displaying as much as he wished\r\nhis zeal and his discipline in virtue owing to the war being ill\r\nconducted; but notwithstanding this, by showing, in contrast to the\r\ngreat effeminacy and luxury of those who were engaged in that\r\ncampaign, orderly behaviour and bravery when it was required, and\r\ncourage and prudence in all things, he was considered in no degree to\r\nfall short of the old Cato. Gellius assigned to him special\r\ndistinctions and honours, which Cato would not take nor allow, saying\r\nthat he had done nothing worthy of honour. In consequence of this he\r\nwas considered a strange kind of fellow; and when a law was made, that\r\nthose who were candidates for an office should not be accompanied by\r\nnomenclators,[671] he was the only person when a candidate for a\r\ntribuneship who observed the law; and having himself made it his\r\nbusiness to salute and address those whom he met with, he did not\r\nescape censure even from those who praised him, for the more they\r\nperceived the honourable nature of his conduct, the more they were\r\nannoyed at the difficulty of imitating it.\r\n\r\nIX. Upon being appointed a tribune he was sent to Macedonia to Rubrius\r\nthe Prætor. On that occasion it is told that his wife being troubled\r\nand shedding tears, one of the friends of Cato, Munatius, said,\r\n\"Atilia, be of good cheer; I will take care of him for you.\" \"It shall\r\nbe so,\" replied Cato; and after they had advanced one day's journey,\r\nhe said immediately after supper, \"Come, Munatius, and keep your\r\npromise to Atilia by not separating yourself from me either by day or\r\nby night.\" Upon this he ordered two beds to be placed in the same\r\nchamber and Munatius always slept thus, being watched in jest by Cato.\r\nThere accompanied him fifteen slaves, and two freedmen and four\r\nfriends, and while they rode on horseback, Cato himself always went on\r\nfoot, keeping by the side of each of them in turns and talking with\r\nthem. When he arrived at the camp, where there were several legions,\r\nbeing appointed to the command of one legion by the general, he\r\nconsidered the display of his own merit, being only one thing, as a\r\nsmall matter and nothing kingly, but being chiefly ambitious to make\r\nthose who were under him like himself, he did not deprive his power of\r\nits terrors, but he added to it reason, by means of which persuading\r\nand instructing his men about every thing--honour and punishment\r\nfollowing; whether he made his soldiers more peaceable or warlike or\r\nmore full of zeal or just, it is difficult to say, so formidable did\r\nthey become to the enemy, and gentle to the allies, and so little\r\ndisposed to wrong, and so ambitious of praise. But that which Cato\r\ncared least for, he had most of, both good opinion, and popularity,\r\nand honour above measure, and affection from the soldiers. For by\r\nvoluntarily labouring at that which he imposed on others, and in his\r\ndress and way of living and marching on foot making himself like them\r\nrather than the commander, and in his morals and in his noble bearing,\r\nand in eloquence surpassing all who were intitled Imperators and\r\ngenerals, by such means he imperceptibly produced in the men at the\r\nsame time good will towards himself. For no true emulation after\r\nvirtue is bred except from perfect good will and respect towards him\r\nwho commends it: but those who having no love, praise the brave,\r\nrespect their character, though they admire not their virtue, nor do\r\nthey imitate it.\r\n\r\nX. Hearing that Athenodorus[672] named Kordylion, who had great skill\r\nin the Stoic philosophy, was living at Pergamus, being now an old man,\r\nand having most resolutely resisted all intimacy and friendship with\r\ngovernors and kings, Cato thought that he should get nothing by\r\nsending and writing to him, but as he had a furlough of two months\r\nallowed by the law, he made a voyage to Asia to the man, in the\r\nconfidence that through his own merits he should not fail in the\r\nchase. After discoursing with Athenodorus and getting the victory\r\nover him and drawing him from his settled purpose, he returned with\r\nhim to the camp, overjoyed and greatly elated at having made the\r\nnoblest capture and got a more splendid booty than the nations and\r\nkingdoms which Pompeius at that time and Lucullus were subduing in\r\ntheir campaigns.\r\n\r\nXI. While Cato was still engaged in the service, his brother, who was\r\non his road to Asia, fell sick at Ænus,[673] in Thrace; and a letter\r\nimmediately came to Cato, and though the sea was very stormy, and\r\nthere was no vessel at hand of sufficient size, taking only two\r\nfriends with him and three slaves, he set sail from Thessalonike in a\r\nsmall trading ship. After narrowly escaping being drowned at sea, he\r\nwas saved by unexpected good luck, but he found Cæpio already dead. He\r\nwas considered to have borne the misfortune with more of passion than\r\nphilosophy, not only in his lamentations and his embracings of the\r\ndead body and the heaviness of his grief, but also in his expenditure\r\nabout the interment, and the trouble that he took about fragrant\r\nspices and costly vests which were burnt with the body, and a monument\r\nof polished Thasian stone of the cost of eight talents which was\r\nconstructed in the Agora of Ænus. These things there were some who\r\nfound fault with by comparison with Cato's freedom from all display in\r\nother matters, not seeing how much mildness and affection there was in\r\nthe man who was inflexible and firm against pleasures and fears and\r\nshameless entreaties. For the celebration of the funeral both cities\r\nand princes offered to send him many things to do honour to the dead,\r\nfrom none of whom however would he receive valuables, but he accepted\r\nfragrant spices and vests, paying the price to those who sent the\r\nthings. Though the succession came to him and the young daughter of\r\nCæpio, he did not claim back in the division of the property any thing\r\nthat he had expended about the funeral. And though he did such things\r\nas these and continued to do such, there was one[674] who wrote, that\r\nhe passed the ashes of the dead through a sieve and sifted them to\r\nsearch for the gold that was burnt. So far did the writer allow, not\r\nto his sword only, but also to his stilus, irresponsibility and\r\nexemption from all account.\r\n\r\nXII. When the time of Cato's service was at an end, he was attended on\r\nhis departure, not with good wishes, which is usual, nor yet with\r\npraises, but with tears and never-satisfied embraces, the soldiers\r\nplacing their garments under his feet on the way by which he went and\r\nkissing his hands, which the Romans of that day hardly ever did to any\r\nof their Imperators. As he wished, before engaging in public affairs,\r\nat the same time to travel about to make himself acquainted with Asia,\r\nand to see with his own eyes the customs and mode of living and power\r\nof each province, and at the same time not to give any offence to the\r\nGalatian Deiotarus,[675] who prayed Cato to come to him on account of\r\nthe ancient ties of hospitality and friendship that subsisted between\r\nhim and Cato's family, he made his sojourning after this fashion. At\r\ndaybreak he used to send forward his bread-maker and cook to the place\r\nwhere he intended to lodge; and it was their practice to enter the\r\ncity with great decorum and no stir, and if there happened to be no\r\nancient friend of Cato's family there or no acquaintance, they would\r\nprepare for his reception in an inn without troubling anybody; and if\r\nthere was no inn, they would in that case apply to the magistrates and\r\ngladly accept what accommodation was offered. And oftentimes getting\r\nno credit, and being neglected because they did not apply to the\r\nmagistrates about these matters with noise or threats, Cato came upon\r\nthem before they had accomplished their business, and when he was\r\nseen, he was still more despised; and because he would sit silently on\r\nthe baggage, he gave them the notion of being a person of mean\r\ncondition and a very timid man. However Cato would call them to him,\r\nand would say, \"Ye miserable wretches, lay aside this inhospitable\r\npractice. All those who come to you will not be Catos. Dull by your\r\nkind reception the power of those who only want a pretext to take by\r\nforce what they cannot get from you with your consent.\"\r\n\r\nXIII. In Syria[676] a laughable incident is said to have happened to\r\nhim. For as he was walking to Antiocheia, he saw near the gates on the\r\noutside a number of men arranged on each side of the road, among whom\r\nyoung men by themselves in cloaks and boys on the other side stood in\r\norderly wise, and some had white vests and crowns, and these were\r\npriests of the gods or magistrates. Now Cato, being quite sure that\r\nsome honourable reception was preparing for him by the city, was angry\r\nwith those of his own people who had been sent on, for not having\r\nprevented this, and he bade his friends get off their horses and he\r\nproceeded with them on foot. But when they came near, he who was\r\narranging all this ceremony and setting the folk in order, a man\r\nsomewhat advanced in years, holding a rod in his hand and a chaplet,\r\nadvanced in front of the rest, and meeting Cato, without even saluting\r\nhim, asked where they had left Demetrius and when he would be there.\r\nDemetrius had been a slave of Pompeius, but at this time, as all the\r\nworld, so to speak, had their eyes on Pompeius, Demetrius was courted\r\nabove his merits on account of his great influence with Pompeius. Now\r\nthe friends of Cato were seized with such a fit of laughter that they\r\ncould not contain themselves as they walked through the crowd, but\r\nCato, who at the time was vehemently disconcerted, uttered the words,\r\n\"O ill-fated city,\" and nothing more; afterwards however he was\r\naccustomed to laugh at the matter himself both when he told the story\r\nand when he thought of it.\r\n\r\nXIV. However Pompeius himself reproved those who thus misbehaved\r\nthemselves towards Cato in their ignorance. For when Cato on his\r\narrival at Ephesus went to pay his respects to Pompeius as his elder,\r\nand much his superior in reputation and then at the head of the\r\ngreatest armies, Pompeius observing him did not wait or allow Cato to\r\napproach him as he was seated, but springing up as to a man of\r\nsuperior rank, he met him and gave him his right hand. And Pompeius\r\npassed many encomiums on the merit of Cato while treating him as a\r\nfriend and showing him attention during his stay, and still more when\r\nhe had departed, so that all persons being admonished and now\r\ndirecting their observation to Cato admired him for the things for\r\nwhich he was despised, and studied his mildness and magnanimity. Yet\r\nit did not escape notice that the great attention of Pompeius to him\r\nproceeded more from respect than from love, and people discerned that\r\nPompeius honoured him while he was present, and was glad when he went\r\naway. For the other young men who came to him, he was ambitious to\r\nkeep with him, and he wished them to stay, but he asked of Cato\r\nnothing of the kind, and as if he were not commander with\r\nirresponsible power while Cato was there, he was glad to get rid of\r\nhim; and yet he was almost the only person among those who were\r\nsailing to Rome to whom Pompeius commended his children and wife, who\r\nhowever were connected with Cato by kinship. In consequence of this\r\nthere was high regard and great exertion and emulation in the cities\r\ntowards Cato, and suppers and invitations, wherein Cato bade his\r\nfriends keep a watch upon him, lest he should unawares make good what\r\nCurio[677] had said. For Curio, who was annoyed at the austerity of\r\nCato, who was his friend and intimate, asked him if he should like to\r\nvisit Asia after he had served his time in the army. And on Cato\r\nsaying that he should like it very much, \"You say well,\" replied\r\nCurio, \"for you will be more agreeable when you return thence, and\r\ntamer,\" using some such words as these.\r\n\r\nXV. Deiotarus the Galatian, who was now an old man, sent for Cato,\r\nwishing to intrust to him his children and his family; and on his\r\narrival he offered him all manner of presents, and tried and entreated\r\nhim in every way till he so irritated Cato, that after arriving in the\r\nevening and staying all night, he set off on the following day about\r\nthe third hour. However when he had advanced one day's journey, he\r\nfound in Possinus[678] more presents than before awaiting him there,\r\nand letters from the Galatian begging him to receive them; and if he\r\nshould not be disposed to take them, to let his friends at least\r\nreceive favours on his account, as they well deserved it, and Cato had\r\nnot much of his own. But Cato did not give in even to these arguments,\r\nthough he saw that some of his friends were beginning to be softened\r\nand were inclined to blame him; but observing that all receiving of\r\ngifts might find a good excuse, and his friends should share in all\r\nthat he got honourably and justly, he sent back the presents to\r\nDeiotarus. As he was about to set sail to Brundisium, his friends\r\nthought that they ought to put the ashes of Cæpio in another vessel,\r\nbut Cato, saying that he would rather part with his life than the\r\nashes of his brother, set sail. And indeed it is said that it chanced\r\nthat he had a very dangerous passage, though the rest got to\r\nBrundisium with little difficulty.\r\n\r\nXVI. On his return to Rome he spent his time either at home in the\r\ncompany of Athenodorus, or in the Forum assisting his friends. Though\r\nthe office of Quæstor[679] was now open to him, he did not become a\r\ncandidate for it till he had read the laws relating to the\r\nquæstorship, and had learned all particulars from the experienced, and\r\nhad comprehended the powers of the office in a certain shape.\r\nAccordingly as soon as he was established in the office, he made a\r\ngreat change in the servants and clerks about the treasury, for as\r\nthey constantly had in hand the public accounts and the laws, and had\r\nyoung superiors who, by reason of their inexperience and ignorance, in\r\nfact required others to teach and direct them, they did not allow\r\ntheir superiors to have any power, but were the superior officers\r\nthemselves, until Cato vigorously applied himself to the business, not\r\nhaving the name only and the honour of a magistrate, but understanding\r\nand judgment and apt expression; and he resolved to make the clerks\r\ninto servants as they really were, in some things detecting their evil\r\ndoings, and in others correcting their errors which arose from\r\ninexperience. But as the clerks were insolent, and attempted to\r\ningratiate themselves with and to flatter the other quæstors, and\r\nresisted him, he expelled from the treasury the first among them whom\r\nhe had detected in knavish dealings in a matter of trust concerning an\r\ninheritance, and he brought another to trial for dishonesty. This\r\nsecond person Catulus Lutatius[680] the censor came forward to defend,\r\na man who had great dignity from his office, and the greatest from his\r\nmerit, being considered superior to all the Romans in integrity and\r\ntemperance; and he was also an admirer and intimate friend of Cato all\r\nthrough his life. Now, when Catulus found that the justice of the case\r\nwas against him and openly asked to have the man acquitted for his\r\nsake, Cato would not allow him to act so: and when he still continued\r\nto urge his request, Cato said, \"It were a scandalous thing, Catulus,\r\nfor you, who are the censor, and whose duty it is to examine into our\r\nlives, to be turned out[681] by our officers.\" When Cato had uttered\r\nthese words, Catulus looked at him as if he were going to reply, but\r\nhe said nothing, and either being angry or ashamed he went away in\r\nsilence and perplexed. However the man was not convicted, for when the\r\nvotes for condemnation had exceeded those for acquittal by a single\r\nvote, and Lollius Marcus, one of the colleagues of Cato, owing to\r\nsickness had not attended at the trial, Catulus sent to him and\r\nprayed him to give his support to the man; and he was carried thither\r\nin a litter after the trial and gave the vote which acquitted. However\r\nCato did not employ the clerk nor give him his pay, nor did he take\r\nany reckoning at all of the vote of Lollius.\r\n\r\nXVII. Having thus humbled the clerks and reduced them to obedience, by\r\nmanaging the accounts in his own way, he made the treasury in a short\r\ntime more respected than the Senate, so that every body said and\r\nconsidered that Cato had surrounded the quæstorship with the dignity\r\nof the consulship. For in the first place finding that many persons\r\nowed old debts to the state and that the state was indebted to many,\r\nhe at the same time put an end to the state being wronged and wronging\r\nothers, by demanding the money from those who owed it vigorously and\r\nwithout relenting at all, and paying the creditors speedily and\r\nreadily, so that the people respected him when they saw those pay who\r\nexpected to defraud the state, and those recover who never expected\r\nit. In the next place, it was the general practice to bring in\r\nwritings without observing the proper forms, and previous quæstors\r\nused to receive false decrees to please persons, and at their request.\r\nCato however let nothing of this kind escape his notice, and on one\r\noccasion being in doubt about a decree, whether it was really\r\nratified, though many persons testified to the fact, he would not\r\ntrust them, nor did he allow it to be deposited until the consuls came\r\nand by oath confirmed its genuineness. Now there were many whom Sulla\r\nhad rewarded for killing proscribed persons at the rate of twelve\r\nthousand drachmæ apiece, and though all detested them as accursed and\r\nabominable wretches, no one ventured to bring them to punishment; but\r\nCato, calling to account every man who had public money by unfair\r\nmeans, made him give it up and at the same time upbraided him for his\r\nunholy and illegal acts with passion and argument. Those whom this\r\nbefel were immediately charged with murder and were brought before the\r\njudices in a manner prejudged, and were punished, to the joy of all\r\nwho considered that the tyranny of those former times was at the same\r\ntime blotted out and that they witnessed Sulla himself punished.\r\n\r\nXVIII. The many were captivated by his persevering and unwearied\r\nindustry: for none of his colleagues went up earlier to the treasury\r\nor came away after him. He never omitted attending any meeting of the\r\npeople and of the Senate, for he feared and kept a watch on those who\r\nwere ready to vote for remissions of debts and taxes and for gifts in\r\nfavour of any body. By proving that the treasury was inaccessible and\r\nfree from intrigues, and full of money, he showed that they could be\r\nrich without doing wrong. Though at first he appeared to be disliked\r\nby and odious to some of his colleagues, he afterwards gained their\r\ngood-will by subjecting himself on behalf of them all to the hatred\r\nthat was incurred by not giving away the public money and by not\r\ndeciding dishonestly, and by furnishing them with an answer to those\r\nwho preferred their requests and urged them, that nothing could be\r\ndone if Cato did not consent. On the last day of his office when he\r\nhad been accompanied to his house by almost all the citizens, he heard\r\nthat many who were intimate with Marcellus,[682] and men of influence,\r\nhad fallen upon him at the treasury and having got round him were\r\nforcing him to sign a certain payment of money that was due. Marcellus\r\nfrom his boyhood had been a friend of Cato and together with him had\r\nbeen a most excellent magistrate, but by himself he was easily led by\r\nothers through false shame, and was ready to oblige any body.\r\nAccordingly Cato immediately returned to the treasury, and finding\r\nthat Marcellus had been prevailed upon to sign the payment asked for\r\nthe tablets and erased what was written, while Marcellus stood by and\r\nsaid not a word. Having done this Cato conducted him down from the\r\ntreasury and put him in his house; and Marcellus neither then nor\r\nafterwards found fault with Cato, but continued on intimate terms with\r\nhim all along. Nor did Cato when he had quitted the treasury leave it\r\ndestitute of protection, but slaves of his were there daily who copied\r\nout the transactions, and he himself purchased for five talents books\r\nwhich contained the public accounts from the times of Sulla to his own\r\nquæstorship, and he always had them in his hands.\r\n\r\nXIX. He used to go into the Senate house the first, and he was the\r\nlast to come away; and often while the rest were slowly assembling, he\r\nwould sit and read quietly, holding his toga before the book. He never\r\nwent abroad when there was to be a meeting of the Senate; but\r\nafterwards when Pompeius saw that Cato could not be prevailed upon,\r\nand could never be brought to comply with the unjust measures on which\r\nhe was intent, he used to contrive to engage him in giving his aid to\r\nsome friend in a matter before the courts, or in arbitrations, or in\r\ndischarging some business. But Cato quickly perceiving his design,\r\nrefused all such engagements and made it a rule to do nothing else\r\nwhile the Senate was assembled. For it was neither for the sake of\r\nreputation, nor self-aggrandisement, nor by a kind of spontaneous\r\nmovement, nor by chance, like some others, that he was thrown into the\r\nmanagement of state affairs, but he selected a public career as the\r\nproper labour of a good man, and thought that he ought to attend to\r\npublic concerns more than the bee to its cells, inasmuch as he made it\r\nhis business to have the affairs of the provinces and decrees and\r\ntrials and the most important measures communicated to him by his\r\nconnections and friends in every place. On one occasion by opposing\r\nClodius the demagogue, who was making a disturbance and laying the\r\nfoundation for great charges, and calumniating to the people the\r\npriests and priestesses, among whom was also Fabia,[683] the sister of\r\nTerentia, Cicero's wife, he was in great danger, but he involved\r\nClodius in disgrace and compelled him to withdraw from the city; and\r\nwhen Cicero thanked him, Cato said that he ought to reserve his\r\ngratitude for the state, as it was for the sake of the state that he\r\ndid every thing and directed his political measures. In consequence of\r\nthis there was a high opinion of him, so that an orator said to the\r\njudices on a certain trial when the evidence of a single person was\r\nproduced, that it was not right to believe a single witness even if he\r\nwas Cato; and many persons now were used to say when speaking of\r\nthings incredible and contrary to all probability, as by way of\r\nproverb, that this could not be believed even if Cato said it. And\r\nwhen a man of bad character and great expense delivered a discourse in\r\nthe senate in favour of frugality and temperance, Amnæus[684] rose up\r\nand said, \"My man, who will endure you, you who sup like Crassus, and\r\nbuild like Lucullus, and harangue us like Cato.\" Others also who were\r\npeople of bad character and intemperate, but in their language\r\ndignified and severe, they used to call by way of mockery, Catos.\r\n\r\nXX. Though many invited him to the tribuneship, he did not think it\r\nwell to expend the power of a great office and magistracy, no more\r\nthan that of a strong medicine, on matters wherein it was not\r\nrequired. At the same time as he had leisure from public affairs, he\r\ntook books and philosophers with him and set out for Lucania, for he\r\nhad lands there on which there was no unseemly residence. On the road\r\nhe met with many beasts of burden and baggage and slaves, and learning\r\nthat Nepos Metellus[685] was returning to Rome for the purpose of\r\nbeing a candidate for the tribuneship, he halted without speaking, and\r\nafter a short interval ordered his people to turn back. His friends\r\nwondering at this, he said, \"Don't you know that even of himself\r\nMetellus is a formidable man by reason of his violence; and now that\r\nhe has come upon the motion of Pompeius, he will fall upon the state\r\nlike a thunderbolt and put all in confusion? It is therefore not a\r\ntime for leisure or going from home, but we must get the better of the\r\nman or die nobly in defence of liberty.\" However at the urgency of his\r\nfriends he went first to visit his estates, and after staying no long\r\ntime he returned to the city. He arrived in the evening, and as soon\r\nas day dawned, he went down into the Forum to be a candidate for the\r\ntribuneship and to oppose Metellus. For this magistracy gives more\r\npower to check than to act; and even if all the rest of the tribunes\r\nsave one should assent to a measure, the power lies with him who does\r\nnot consent or permit.\r\n\r\nXXI. At first there were few of Cato's friends about him, but when his\r\nviews became public, in a short time all the people of character and\r\ndistinction crowded together and cheered and encouraged him, for they\r\nsaid it was no favour that he was receiving, but he was conferring the\r\ngreatest favour on his country and the most honest of the citizens,\r\nfor that when it was often in his power to hold a magistracy without\r\nany trouble, he now came down to contend on behalf of freedom and the\r\nconstitution, not without danger. It is said that owing to many\r\npersons through zeal and friendly disposition crowding towards him he\r\nwas in some danger, and with difficulty on account of the crowd he\r\nmade his way to the Forum. Being elected tribune with others and with\r\nMetellus, and observing that the consular comitia were accompanied\r\nwith bribery, he rated the people, and at the close of his speech he\r\nswore that he would prosecute the briber, whoever he might be, with\r\nthe exception of Silanus,[686] on account of his connection with him;\r\nfor Silanus had to wife Servilia, a sister of Cato. For this reason he\r\npassed over Silanus, but he prosecuted Lucius Murena,[687] on the\r\ncharge of having secured his election with Silanus by bribery. There\r\nwas a law according to which the accused had always the power to\r\nappoint a person to watch the accuser, in order that it might not be\r\nunknown what he was getting together and preparing to support the\r\nprosecution. Now he who was appointed by Murena to watch Cato used to\r\naccompany him and observe his conduct, and when he saw that Cato was\r\ndoing nothing with unfair design or contrary to equity, but honourably\r\nand in a kindly spirit was going a simple and straightforward course\r\ntowards the prosecution, he had such admiration of his noble bearing\r\nand morality that he would come up to Cato in the Forum, or go to his\r\ndoor and ask, whether he intended that day to attend to any matters\r\nthat concerned the prosecution, and if he said that he did not, he\r\nwould take his word and go away. When the trial came on, Cicero, who\r\nwas then consul and one of the advocates of Murena, on account of\r\nCato's connection with the Stoics, ridiculed and mocked these\r\nphilosophers and their so-called paradoxes, and thus made the judices\r\nlaugh. On which it is said that Cato, with a smile, observed to those\r\nwho were present, \"My friends, what a ridiculous consul we have.\"\r\nMurena, who was acquitted, did not display towards Cato the temper of\r\na bad or a foolish man, for in his consulship he used to ask his\r\nadvice in the most important affairs, and all along in every other\r\nmatter showed him respect and confidence. Cato's own conduct was the\r\ncause of this, for while he was severe and terrible on the judgment\r\nseat and in the Senate on behalf of justice, he was benevolent and\r\nfriendly in all his social intercourse.\r\n\r\nXXII. Before Cato entered on the tribuneship, during Cicero's\r\nconsulship he supported his administration in many other difficulties,\r\nand he put the finishing stroke to the measures relating to\r\nCatiline,[688] which were the most important and glorious of all.\r\nCatiline himself, who was designing to effect a pernicious and\r\ncomplete change in the Roman state, and was at the same time stirring\r\nup insurrection and war, being convicted by Cicero, fled from the\r\ncity; but Lentulus and Cethegus and many others with them, who had\r\ntaken up the conspiracy, upbraiding Catiline with cowardice and want\r\nof spirit in his designs, were plotting to destroy the city with\r\nfire, and to subvert the supremacy of Rome by the revolt of nations\r\nand by foreign wars. Their schemes having been discovered in the\r\nmanner told in the Life of Cicero, he laid the matter before the\r\nSenate for their deliberation, whereupon Silanus, who spoke first,\r\ngave his opinion that the men ought to suffer the extreme punishment,\r\nand those who followed him spoke to the same effect, till it came to\r\nCæsar's turn. Cæsar now rose, and as he was a powerful speaker and\r\nwished rather to increase all change and disturbance in the state than\r\nto allow it to be quenched, considering it as the stuff for his own\r\ndesigns to work upon, he urged many arguments of a persuasive and\r\nhumane kind to the effect that the men ought not to be put to death\r\nwithout trial, and he advised that they should be confined in prison:\r\nand he wrought so great a change in the opinion of the Senate, who\r\nwere afraid of the people, that even Silanus retracted what he had\r\nsaid, and affirmed that neither had he recommended that they should be\r\nput to death, but that they should be imprisoned; for to a Roman this\r\nwas the extreme of punishment.\r\n\r\nXXIII. Such had been the change, and all the Senators in a body had\r\ngone over to the milder and more humane proposal, when Cato rising to\r\ndeliver his opinion, commenced his speech in anger and passion,\r\nabusing Silanus for changing his mind, and attacking Cæsar, whom he\r\ncharged with a design to overturn the State under a popular guise and\r\npretext of humanity, and with making the Senate alarmed at things at\r\nwhich he himself ought to be alarmed, and therewith well content, if\r\nhe escaped unharmed on account of what had passed and without\r\nsuspicion, when he was so openly and audaciously endeavouring to\r\nrescue the common enemies of all, and admitting that he had no pity\r\nfor the state, such and so great though it was, and though it had so\r\nnarrowly escaped destruction, but was shedding tears and lamenting\r\nbecause those who ought never to have existed or been born would by\r\ntheir death release the state from great bloodshed and danger. They\r\nsay that this is the only speech of Cato which is preserved, and that\r\nit was owing to Cicero the consul, who had previously instructed\r\nthose clerks who surpassed the rest in quick writing in the use of\r\ncertain signs which comprehended in their small and brief marks the\r\nforce of many characters and had placed them in different parts of the\r\nSenate house. For the Romans at this time were not used to employ nor\r\ndid they possess what are called note-writers,[689] but it was on this\r\noccasion, as they say, that they were first established in a certain\r\nform. However, Cato prevailed and changed the opinion of the Senate,\r\nwho condemned the men to death.\r\n\r\nXXIV. Now as we perhaps ought not to omit even the slight tokens of\r\ncharacter when we are delineating as it were a likeness of the soul,\r\nit is reported that on this occasion when Cæsar was making much\r\nexertion and a great struggle against Cato, and the attention of the\r\nSenate was fixed on both of them, a small letter was brought in for\r\nCæsar from the outside. Cato attempted to fix suspicion on this\r\nmatter, and alleged that some of the senators were disturbed at it and\r\nhe bade him read the writing, on which Cæsar handed the letter to Cato\r\nwho was standing near him. Cato read the letter, which was an amatory\r\nepistle addressed to Cæsar by his sister Servilia[690] who was\r\nenamoured of Cæsar and had been debauched by him, and throwing it at\r\nCæsar he said, \"Take it, drunkard,\" and so resumed his speech. Indeed\r\nin the female part of his family Cato appears to have always been\r\nunlucky. For this sister had a bad report in respect of Cæsar; and the\r\nconduct of the other Servilia, also a sister of Cato, was still more\r\nunseemly. For though she was married to Lucullus, a man who was among\r\nthe first of the Romans in reputation, and bore him a child, she was\r\ndriven from his house for incontinence. And what was most scandalous\r\nof all, even Cato's wife Atilia was not free from such vices, for\r\nthough he had two children by her, he was compelled to put her away\r\nfor her unseemly behaviour.\r\n\r\nXXV. Cato then married Marcia, a daughter of Philippus,[691] who had\r\nthe character of being an honest woman, and about whom a good deal is\r\nsaid; but just as in a drama, this part of Cato's life is a difficult\r\nand perplexed matter. However it was after the following manner, as\r\nThrasea[692] writes, who refers as his authority to Munatius, a\r\ncompanion and intimate associate of Cato. Among the numerous friends\r\nand admirers of Cato there were some more conspicuous and\r\ndistinguished than others, of whom one was Quintus Hortensius,[693] a\r\nman of splendid reputation and honest morals. Now as Hortensius was\r\ndesirous to be not merely an intimate friend and companion of Cato,\r\nbut in a manner to unite in kinship and community the whole family and\r\nstock, he endeavoured to persuade Cato, whose daughter Porcia was the\r\nwife of Bibulus and had born him two sons, to give her in turn to him\r\nas a fertile soil to beget children in. He said that according to\r\nmen's opinion such a thing was strange, but that according to nature\r\nit was good and for the advantage of states, that a woman who was in\r\nher youth and perfection should neither lie idle and check her\r\nprocreative power, nor yet should by breeding more children than\r\nenough cause trouble to her husband and impoverish him when he wanted\r\nno more children; but that if there was a community of offspring among\r\nworthy men, it would make virtue abundant and widely diffused among\r\nfamilies, and would mingle the state with itself by these family\r\nrelationships. If Bibulus, he said, was greatly attached to his wife,\r\nhe would return her as soon as she had born a child, and he had become\r\nmore closely united both with Bibulus and Cato by a community of\r\nchildren. Cato replied that he loved Hortensius and valued his\r\nkinship, but he considered it strange for Hortensius to speak about\r\nthe marriage of his daughter who had been given to another; on which\r\nHortensius changing his proposal and disclosing himself did not\r\nhesitate to ask the wife of Cato, who was still young enough to bear\r\nchildren, while Cato himself had children enough. And it cannot be\r\nsaid that Hortensius did this because he knew that Cato paid no\r\nattention to Marcia, for they say that she happened to be with child\r\nat the time. Accordingly Cato seeing the earnestness and eagerness of\r\nHortensius did not refuse, but he said that Philippus the father of\r\nMarcia must also approve of it. When they had seen Philippus and\r\ninformed him of the agreement, he did not give Marcia in marriage,\r\nexcept in the presence of Cato, and Cato joined in giving her away.\r\nThough this took place later, it seemed convenient to me to anticipate\r\nthe time as I had made mention of the female part of Cato's family.\r\n\r\nXXVI. When Lentulus and his associates had been executed, and Cæsar,\r\non account of the charges and insinuations made against him before the\r\nSenate, betook himself to the people for protection and was stirring\r\nup the numerous diseased and corrupted members of the state and\r\ncollecting them about him, Cato, being alarmed, persuaded the Senate\r\nto relieve the crowd of poor who had no property by an allowance of\r\ngrain, the expenditure for which purpose was to the amount of twelve\r\nhundred and fifty talents[694] annually; and the threats of Cæsar were\r\nmanifestly rendered futile by this liberality and bounty. After this,\r\nMetellus, as soon as he had entered on the tribuneship, got together\r\ntumultuous meetings and proposed a law that Pompeius Magnus[695]\r\nshould hasten to Italy with his forces and should undertake the\r\nprotection of the city, which it was alleged was in danger from\r\nCatiline. This was in appearance a specious proposal, but the real\r\nobject and end of the law was to put affairs in the hands of Pompeius\r\nand to surrender to him the supremacy. When the Senate was assembled\r\nand Cato did not in his usual way fall violently on Metellus, but\r\nadvised him with much forbearance and moderation, and at last even\r\nbetook himself to entreaty and praised the family of the Metelli for\r\nhaving always been aristocratic, Metellus becoming much emboldened and\r\ndespising Cato, whom he supposed to be giving way and cowering, broke\r\nout in extravagant threats and arrogant expressions, as if he would\r\naccomplish every thing in spite of the Senate. On this Cato, changing\r\nhis attitude and tone and language, and concluding all that he said\r\nwith a vehement affirmation that so long as he lived Pompeius should\r\nnot come into the city with his soldiers, brought the Senate to this\r\nopinion, that neither he nor Metellus was in a sober mind and that\r\nneither of them was guided by sound considerations, but that the\r\nmeasures of Metellus were madness which from excess of depravity was\r\nloading to the destruction and confusion of every thing, and those of\r\nCato an enthusiasm of virtue struggling in behalf of honour and\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nXXVII. But when the people were going to vote on the law, and armed\r\nstrangers and gladiators and slaves had come to the Forum arrayed to\r\nsupport Metellus, and that part of the people which longed for\r\nPompeius from desire of change was not small, and there was also great\r\nsupport from Cæsar who was then prætor, and the first men of the\r\ncitizens rather shared in the indignation and wrongs of Cato than\r\njoined him in making resistance, and great depression and alarm\r\nprevailed in his family, so that some of his friends taking no food\r\nwatched all night with one another in perplexed deliberation on his\r\nbehalf, and his wife and sisters also were lamenting and weeping, Cato\r\nhimself displayed a fearless and confident behaviour to all, and\r\ncheered them, and he took his supper, as usual, and after resting all\r\nnight was roused from a deep sleep by Minucius Thermus one of his\r\ncolleagues; and they went down to the Forum with a few persons\r\naccompanying them, though many met them and urged them to be on their\r\nguard. When Cato stopped and saw the temple of the Dioscuri[696]\r\nsurrounded by armed men and the steps guarded by gladiators, and\r\nMetellus himself with Cæsar sitting above, he turned to his friends\r\nand said, \"O the daring and cowardly men, to collect such a force of\r\nsoldiery against a single man unarmed and defenceless.\" Saying this he\r\nadvanced straight forwards with Thermus; and those who occupied the\r\nsteps made way for them but they let nobody else pass, except that\r\nCato with difficulty pulled Munatius by the hand and got him up, and\r\nthen advancing right onwards, he flung himself between Metellus and\r\nCæsar and there took his seat, and so cut off their communications.\r\nCæsar and Metellus were disconcerted, but the better part of the\r\npeople seeing and admiring the noble bearing and spirit of Cato came\r\nnearer, and with shouts encouraged Cato to be of good heart, and they\r\nurged one another to stay and keep close together and not to betray\r\ntheir liberty and the man who was contending in defence of it.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. The clerk now produced the law, but Cato would not let him\r\nread it, and when Metellus took it and began to read, Cato snatched\r\nthe writing from him; and when Metellus who knew the law by heart was\r\nbeginning to declare it orally, Thermus held his mouth with his hand\r\nand stopped his voice, till at last Metellus seeing that the men were\r\nmaking an opposition which he could not resist and that the people\r\nwere beginning to give way to what was best and to change, he ordered\r\narmed men to hurry thither from his house[697] with threats and\r\nshouts. This being done, and all having been dispersed except Cato,\r\nwho stood there, though he was pelted with stones and pieces of wood\r\nfrom above, Murena, who had been brought to trial and prosecuted by\r\nCato, did not remain indifferent, but holding his toga in front of him\r\nand calling out to those who were throwing missiles, to stop, and\r\nfinally persuading Cato himself and taking him in his arms, led him\r\noff to the temple of the Dioscuri. Now when Metellus saw that all was\r\nclear about the Rostra, and that his opponents were flying through the\r\nForum, being quite confident that he had got the victory, he ordered\r\nthe armed men to go away, and coming forward in an orderly manner he\r\nattempted to conduct the proceedings about the law. But his opponents\r\nquickly recovering themselves from their rout again advanced with loud\r\nand confident shouts, so that the partizans of Metellus were seized\r\nwith confusion and fear, for they thought that their opponents were\r\nfalling on them with arms which they had provided themselves with from\r\nsome place or other, and not one of them stood his ground, but all ran\r\naway from the Rostra. When they were thus dispersed, and Cato coming\r\nforward partly commended and partly encouraged the people, the people\r\nprepared themselves to put down Metellus by every means, and the\r\nSenate assembling declared anew that they would support Cato and\r\nresist the law, which they considered to be introducing discord and\r\ncivil war into Rome.\r\n\r\nXXIX. Metellus himsalf was unmoved from his purpose and still bold,\r\nbut seeing that his partizans were struck with great terror at Cato,\r\nand considered him invincible and that it was impossible to overpower\r\nhim, he suddenly hurried out to the Forum, and assembling the people\r\nhe said many things calculated to bring odium on Cato, and crying out\r\nthat he was flying from his tyranny and the conspiracy against\r\nPompeius, for which the city would speedily repent and for their\r\ndisgracing so great a man, he forthwith set out to Asia to lay all\r\nthese charges before Pompeius. Now the fame of Cato was great inasmuch\r\nas he had eased the state of the no small burden of the tribuneship,\r\nand in a manner had put down the power of Pompeius in the person of\r\nMetellus; but he got still more credit by not consenting that the\r\nSenate, who were minded to do it, should degrade Metellus, and by\r\nopposing the measure and praying them not to pass it. For the majority\r\nconsidered it a token of a humane and moderate temper not to trample\r\non his enemy nor insult him after he had got the victory; and to the\r\nprudent it appeared wise and politic in him not to irritate Pompeius.\r\nAfter this, Lucullus,[698] who had returned from his campaign, the\r\nconclusion and the glory of which Pompeius was considered to have\r\nsnatched from him, ran the risk of not having a triumph, owing to\r\nCaius Memmius stirring up the people and bringing charges against him,\r\nrather to please Pompeius than out of any private ill-will. But Cato,\r\nbeing connected with Lucullus by Lucullus having married Cato's sister\r\nServilia, and also thinking it a scandalous affair, resisted Memmius\r\nand exposed himself to much calumny and many imputations. Finally an\r\nattempt being made to eject Cato from his office, on the ground that\r\nhe was exercising tyrannical power, he so far prevailed as to compel\r\nMemmius himself to desist from his prosecution and to give up the\r\ncontest. Lucullus accordingly had a triumph, in consideration of which\r\nhe stuck still more closely to the friendship of Cato, which was to\r\nhim a protection and bulwark against the power of Pompeius.\r\n\r\nXXX. Pompeius[699] returning from his military command with great\r\nreputation, and relying on the splendour and heartiness of his\r\nreception for getting everything from the citizens that he asked for,\r\nsent a message to the Senate before his arrival at Rome, to ask them\r\nto put off the Comitia, that he might be present to assist Piso at his\r\ncanvass. The majority were ready to give way, but Cato who did not\r\nconsider the putting off the Comitia as the chief matter, and wished\r\nto cut short the attempts and the hopes of Pompeius, opposed the\r\nrequest and induced the Senate to change their mind and reject it.\r\nThis gave Pompeius no little uneasiness, and considering that he\r\nshould find no slight obstacle in Cato, if he did not make him his\r\nfriend, he sent for Munatius,[700] an intimate of Cato, and as Cato\r\nhad two marriageable nieces, he asked for the elder for his own wife,\r\nand the younger for his son. Some say that the suit was not for the\r\nnieces, but the daughters of Cato. When Munatius made the proposal to\r\nCato and his wife and sisters, the women were delighted above measure\r\nat the prospect of the alliance by reason of the greatness and\r\nreputation of the man; but Cato, without pause or deliberation, with\r\npassion forthwith replied, \"Go, Munatius, go, and tell Pompeius, that\r\nCato is not to be caught by approaching him through the women's\r\nchamber, but that he is well content to have the friendship of\r\nPompeius, and if Pompeius will act rightly, Cato will show him a\r\nfriendship more sure than any marriage connection, but he will not\r\ngive up hostages to the reputation of Pompeius contrary to the\r\ninterests of his country.\" The women were vexed at these words, and\r\nCato's friends blamed his answer as both rude and insolent. The next\r\nthing, however, was that Pompeius while trying to secure the\r\nconsulship for one of his friends, sent money for the tribes, and the\r\nbribery[701] was notorious, the money being counted out in his\r\ngardens. Accordingly when Cato observed to the women, that he who was\r\nconnected with Pompeius by marriage, must of necessity participate in\r\nsuch measures and be loaded with the disgrace of them, they admitted\r\nthat he had judged better in rejecting the alliance of Pompeius. But\r\nif we may judge by the result, Cato appears to have made a complete\r\nmistake in not accepting the proposed alliance with Pompeius, and\r\nallowing him to turn to Cæsar and to contract a marriage, which, by\r\nuniting the power of Pompeius and Cæsar, nearly overthrew the Roman\r\nstate and did destroy the constitution, nothing of which probably\r\nwould have happened if Cato had not, through fear of the small errors\r\nof Pompeius, overlooked the greatest, which was the allowing him to\r\nincrease the power of another.\r\n\r\nXXXI. These things, however, were still in the future. Now when\r\nLucullus was engaged in a contest with Pompeius respecting the\r\narrangements made in Pontus, for each of them wished his own\r\narrangements to be confirmed, and Cato gave his aid to Lucullus, who\r\nwas manifestly wronged, Pompeius being worsted in the Senate and\r\nseeking to make himself popular, proposed a division of lands among\r\nthe soldiery. But when Cato opposed him in this measure also and\r\nfrustrated the law, Pompeius next attached himself to Clodius, the\r\nboldest of the demagogues at that time, and gained over Cæsar,[702] to\r\nwhich Cato in a manner gave occasion. For Cæsar, who had returned from\r\nhis prætorship in Iberia, at the same time wished to be a candidate\r\nfor the consulship and asked for a triumph. But as it was the law that\r\nthose who were candidates for a magistracy should be present, and\r\nthose who were going to have a triumph should stay outside the walls,\r\nCæsar asked permission of the Senate to solicit the office through\r\nmeans of others. Many were willing to consent, but Cato spoke against\r\nit, and when he saw that the Senators were ready to oblige Cæsar, he\r\ntook up the whole day in talking, and thus frustrated the designs, of\r\nthe Senate. Cæsar accordingly giving up his hopes of a triumph,\r\nentered the city, and immediately attached himself to Pompeius, and\r\nsought the consulship. Being elected consul, Cæsar gave Julia in\r\nmarriage to Pompeius, and the two now coalescing against the state,\r\nthe one introduced laws for giving to the poor allotments and a\r\ndistribution of land, and the other assisted in supporting these\r\nmeasures. But Lucullus and Cicero siding with Bibulus, the other\r\nconsul, opposed the measures, and Cato most of all, who already\r\nsuspected that the friendship and combination of Cæsar and Pompeius\r\nhad no just object, and said that he was not afraid of the\r\ndistribution of the land, but of the reward for it which those would\r\nclaim who were gratifying the multitude, and alluring them by this\r\nbait.\r\n\r\nXXXII. By these arguments Cato brought the Senate to an unanimous\r\nopinion; and of those without the Senate no small number supported the\r\nsenators, being annoyed at the unusual measures of Cæsar: for what the\r\nboldest and most reckless tribunes were used to propose for\r\npopularity's sake, these very measures Cæsar in the possession of\r\nconsular power adopted, basely and meanly endeavouring to ingratiate\r\nhimself with the people. Cæsar's party, therefore, being alarmed, had\r\nrecourse to violence, and first of all a basket of ordure was thrown\r\nupon Bibulus as he was going down to the Forum, and then the people\r\nfell on his lictors and broke the fasces; finally missiles being\r\nthrown about, and many being wounded, all the rest ran away from the\r\nForum except Cato, who walked away slowly, every now and then turning\r\nround and cursing the citizens. Accordingly Cæsar's partisans not only\r\npassed the law for the distribution of land,[703] but they added to it\r\na clause to compel all the Senate to swear that they would maintain\r\nthe law, and give their aid against any one who should act contrary to\r\nit, and they enacted heavy penalties against those who did not swear.\r\nAll swore to maintain the law under compulsion, bearing in mind what\r\nbefell Metellus of old, whom the people allowed to be driven from[704]\r\nItaly because he would not swear to observe a like enactment. For this\r\nreason the women of Cato's family with tears earnestly entreated him\r\nto yield and take the oath, and also his friends and intimate\r\nacquaintance. But the person who most persuaded and induced Cato to\r\ntake the oath was Cicero the orator, who argued and urged that perhaps\r\nit was not even right for him to think that he was the only man who\r\nought to refuse obedience to what had been determined by the common\r\nvoice; and when it was impossible to undo what had been done, it was\r\naltogether senseless and mad to have no regard for himself; and of all\r\nevils, he argued, it was the greatest to give up and surrender the\r\nstate, to the interests of which all his actions were directed, to\r\nthose who were plotting against it, as if he were glad to be released\r\nfrom all struggles in its behalf; for if Cato did not stand in need of\r\nRome, Rome stood in need of Cato, and all his friends also did; and\r\namong them Cicero said that he was the first, being the object of the\r\ndesigns of Clodius, who was clearly proceeding to attack him by means\r\nof the tribunitian office. By these and the like arguments and\r\nentreaties, both at home and in the Forum, it is said that Cato was\r\ninduced to relent, and was prevailed upon with difficulty, and that he\r\ncame forward to take the oath last of all, except Favonius, one of his\r\nfriends and intimates.\r\n\r\nXXXIII. Cæsar being encouraged, introduced another law for the\r\ndivision of nearly the whole of Campania among the poor and needy.\r\nNobody spoke against it except Cato; and him Cæsar caused to be\r\ndragged from the Rostra to prison, Cato the while remitting nothing of\r\nhis freedom of speech, but as he went along, at the same time speaking\r\nabout the law and advising them to cease attempting such political\r\nmeasures. The Senate followed with downcast countenances, and the best\r\npart of the people, much annoyed and troubled, though they said\r\nnothing, so that Cæsar did not fail to see that they were displeased;\r\nbut out of self-will and expectation that Cato would appeal and have\r\nrecourse to entreaties, he continued leading him to prison. But when\r\nit was plain that Cato intended to do nothing at all, Cæsar, overcome\r\nby shame and the ill opinion of the thing, privately persuaded one of\r\nthe tribunes to rescue Cato. By these laws, however, and these grants\r\nof land, they so cajoled the people, that they voted to Cæsar the\r\ngovernment of Illyricum and all Gaul with four legions for five years,\r\nthough Cato warned them that they would by their own votes plant the\r\ntyrant in the Acropolis; and they transferred by illegal means Publius\r\nClodius from the patrician order to the plebeians, and made the man a\r\ntribune, who was willing to do anything in his public capacity to\r\nserve them, on condition that they would let Cicero be driven out; and\r\nthey made consuls Piso[705] Calpurnius, the father of Cæsar's wife,\r\nand Gabinius Aulus, a man from the lap of Pompeius, as those say who\r\nwere acquainted with his habits and life.\r\n\r\nXXXIV. But though Cæsar and his party had thus violently got\r\npossession of the power, and had one part of the citizens at their\r\ncommand through their grants, and another part through fear, they\r\nstill dreaded Cato. For even when they did get the advantage over him,\r\nthe fact that it was with difficulty and labour, and not without shame\r\nand exposure that they hardly forced their purpose, was annoying and\r\nvexatious. Clodius, indeed, did not expect to be able to put down\r\nCicero so long as Cato was at home, and as he was contriving how to\r\neffect this, he sent for Cato as soon as he was in his office, and\r\naddressed him to the effect that he considered Cato to be the purest\r\nman of all the Romans, and he was ready to prove the sincerity of his\r\nopinion by his acts, and he said that though many persons were\r\nsoliciting the commission to Cyprus and Ptolemæus,[706] and asking to\r\nbe sent, he thought Cato alone worthy of it, and that he gladly\r\noffered him the favour. On Cato crying out that the thing was a snare\r\nand insult and not a favour, Clodius replied in an insolent and\r\ncontemptuous manner, \"Well, if you don't like it, you shall make the\r\nvoyage against your liking;\" and immediately going before the people\r\nhe got the mission of Cato confirmed by a law. When Cato was leaving\r\nRome, Clodius allowed him neither ship nor soldier nor attendant\r\nexcept two clerks, one of whom was a thief and a thorough knave, and\r\nthe other was a client of Clodius. And as if he had given him but\r\nsmall occupations with the affairs of Cyprus and Ptolemæus, Clodius\r\ncommissioned him also to restore the Byzantine fugitives, his wish\r\nbeing that Cato should be as long as possible from Rome during his\r\ntribuneship.\r\n\r\nXXXV. Being under such compulsion, Cato advised Cicero, who was\r\npressed by his enemies, not to raise any commotion nor to involve the\r\ncity in a contest and bloodshed, but by yielding to the times to be\r\nagain the saviour of his country; and sending forward to Cyprus\r\nCanidius,[707] one of his friends, he prevailed on Ptolemæus[708] to\r\nyield without a struggle, assuring him that he should want neither\r\nmoney nor respect, for that the people would give him the priesthood\r\nof the goddess at Paphos.[709] Cato himself stayed in Rhodes making\r\npreparation and waiting for the answers. In the meantime\r\nPtolemæus,[710] King of Egypt, left Alexandria in anger after\r\nquarrelling with the citizens, and set sail for Rome in the hope that\r\nCæsar and Pompeius would restore him with a military force; and as he\r\nwished to see Cato he sent a message, expecting that Cato would come\r\nto him. Cato happened to be then undergoing a purging,[711] and he\r\nanswered that Ptolemæus must come, if he wished to see him; and when\r\nthe king did come, Cato neither advanced to meet him nor rose, but\r\nsaluted him as one of his ordinary visitors and bade him be seated;\r\nand by this behaviour the king was at first disturbed, and was amazed\r\nat the contrast between Cato's haughty behaviour and rough manners,\r\nand the meanness and simplicity of the man's attire. But when he had\r\nbegun to talk with him about his own affairs, and listened to words\r\nfull of wisdom and plain-speaking, for Cato reproved him and showed\r\nwhat a happy condition he had left and to what servitude and toils and\r\ncorruption and love of aggrandisement in the chief men of the Romans\r\nhe was subjecting himself, whom scarcely Egypt would satisfy if it\r\nwere all turned into silver, and Cato advised the king to return and\r\nbe reconciled to his people, and said that he was ready to sail with\r\nhim and assist in bringing about an accommodation, the king, as if he\r\nhad been brought to his senses from some madness or delirium by the\r\nwords of Cato, and perceiving the integrity and judgment of the man,\r\nwas resolved to follow his advice. However, the king was again turned\r\nby his friends to his original design, but as soon as he was in Rome\r\nand was approaching the door of one of the magistrates, he groaned\r\nover his ill resolve, as if he had rejected, not the advice of a good\r\nman, but the prophetic warning of a deity.\r\n\r\nXXXVI. The Ptolemæus in Cyprus, to Cato's good luck, poisoned himself;\r\nand as it was said that he had left a large sum of money, Cato\r\ndetermined to go to Byzantium himself, and he sent his nephew\r\nBrutus[712] to Cyprus, because he did not altogether trust Canidius.\r\nAfter bringing the exiles to terms with their fellow-citizens and\r\nleaving Byzantium at peace with itself, he sailed to Cyprus. Now as\r\nthere was a great quantity of movables, such as suited a royal\r\nhousehold, consisting of cups, tables, precious stones and purple, all\r\nwhich was to be sold and turned into money, Cato being desirous to do\r\neverything with the greatest exactness and to bring up everything to\r\nthe highest price, and to be present everywhere and to apply the\r\nstrictest reckoning, would not trust even to the usages of the market,\r\nbut suspecting all alike, assistants, criers, purchasers and friends,\r\nin fine, by talking to the purchasers singly and urging them to bid,\r\nhe in this way got most of the things sold that were put up for sale.\r\nCato thus offended the rest of his friends by showing that he did not\r\ntrust them, and Munatius, the most intimate of all, he put into a\r\nstate of resentment that was well nigh past cure; so that when Cæsar\r\nwas writing his book against Cato, this passage in the charges against\r\nhim furnished matter for the most bitter invective.\r\n\r\nXXXVII. Munatius, however, states that his anger against Cato arose\r\nnot by reason of Cato's distrust of him, but his contemptuous\r\nbehaviour, and a certain jealousy of his own in regard to Canidius;\r\nfor Munatius also published a book about Cato, which Thrasea chiefly\r\nfollowed. He says that he arrived after the rest in Cyprus and found\r\nvery poor accommodation prepared for him; and that on going to Cato's\r\ndoor he was repulsed, because Cato was engaged about some matters in\r\nthe house with Canidius, and when he complained of this in reasonable\r\nterms, he got an answer which was not reasonable and to the effect:\r\nThat excessive affection, as Theophrastus says, is in danger of often\r\nbecoming the cause of hatred, \"for,\" continued Cato, \"you, by reason\r\nof your very great affection for me, are vexed when you suppose that\r\nyou receive less respect than is your due. But I employ Canidius\r\nbecause I have made trial of him and trust him more than others, for\r\nhe came at the first and has shown himself to be an honest man.\" This,\r\nsays Munatius, Cato said to him, when they two were alone, but that\r\nCato afterwards told it to Canidius; and accordingly when Munatius\r\nheard of it, as he says, he did not go to Cato's table nor to his\r\ncounsels when he was invited; and when Cato threatened that he would\r\ntake pledges[713] from him, which the Romans do in the case of those\r\nwho refuse to obey a command, that without caring for Cato's threats\r\nhe sailed away from Cyprus and for a long time continued to be angry\r\nwith him. That afterwards Marcia, for she was still the wife of Cato,\r\nhaving spoken with Cato, both Cato and he happened to be invited to\r\nsupper by Barcas;[714] and Cato, who came in after the guests were\r\nseated, asked where he should recline. Upon Barcas answering, \"Where\r\nhe pleased,\" Cato looking about him said he would take his place near\r\nMunatius; and going round he did take his place near him, but showed\r\nhim no other sign of friendly feeling during the supper. However, upon\r\nMarcia preferring a second request, Cato wrote to him to say that he\r\nwished to see him on some matter, and that he went early in the\r\nmorning to the house and was detained by Marcia till all the rest went\r\nway, when Cato came in and throwing both his arms round him saluted\r\nand received him with all signs of friendship. Now I have told this at\r\nsome length, because I consider such things to contain a certain\r\nevidence for the exhibition and perception of character no less than\r\npublic and great acts.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. Cato[715] got together nearly seven thousand talents of\r\nsilver, and being afraid of the length of the voyage, he had many\r\nvessels made, each of which contained two talents and five hundred\r\ndrachmæ, and he fastened to each vessel a long rope, to the end of\r\nwhich was attached a very large piece of cork, with the view, that if\r\nthe ship were wrecked, the cork holding the vessels suspended in the\r\ndeep sea might indicate the place. Now the money, with the exception\r\nof a small part, was safely conveyed; but though he had accounts of\r\nall his administration carefully drawn up in two books, he saved\r\nneither of them. One of them was in the care of his freedman\r\nPhilargyros, who set sail from Kenchreæ,[716] but was wrecked, and\r\nlost the book and all the cargo with it: the other he had safely\r\ncarried as far as Corcyra, where he pitched his tent in the Agora; but\r\nthe sailors on account of the cold having lighted many fires, the\r\ntents were burnt in the night, and the book was destroyed. The king's\r\nmanagers who were present were ready to stop the mouths of the enemies\r\nand detractors of Cato; but the matter gave him annoyance for other\r\nreasons. For it was not to prove his own integrity, but to set an\r\nexample of exact dealing to others that he was ambitious to produce\r\nhis accounts, and this was the cause of his vexation.\r\n\r\nXXXIX. Cato's arrival with the ships did not pass unobserved by the\r\nRomans, for all the magistrates and priests, and all the Senate and a\r\ngreat part of the people met him at the river, so that both the banks\r\nwere covered, and Cato's voyage upwards was not inferior to a triumph\r\nin show and splendour. Yet it seemed to some to be a perverse and\r\nstubborn thing, that though the consuls and prætors were present, Cato\r\nneither landed to meet them nor stopped his course, but sweeping along\r\nthe shore in a royal galley of six banks, he never stopped till he had\r\nmoored his ships in the dockyard. However, when the money was carried\r\nalong through the Forum, the people were amazed[717] at the quantity,\r\nand the Senate assembling voted together with suitable thanks that an\r\nextraordinary prætorship[718] should be given to Cato, and that he\r\nshould wear a dress with a purple border when he was present at the\r\npublic spectacles. Cato protested against both these distinctions, but\r\nhe recommended the Senate to emancipate Nikias, the king's steward, to\r\nwhose care and integrity he bore testimony. At that time Philippus,\r\nthe father of Marcia, was consul, and in a manner the dignity and\r\npower of the office were transferred to Cato, for the colleague of\r\nPhilippus[719] paid no less respect to Cato on account of his merit\r\nthan on account of his relationship to Philippus.\r\n\r\nXL. When Cicero[720] had returned from the exile into which he was\r\ndriven by Clodius, and was now a powerful man, he forcibly pulled down\r\nand destroyed in the absence of Clodius, the tribunitian tablets which\r\nClodius had recorded and placed in the Capitol; and the Senate having\r\nbeen assembled about this business, and Clodius making it a matter of\r\naccusation, Cicero said that inasmuch as Clodius had been made tribune\r\nin an illegal manner, all that had been done during his tribunate and\r\nrecorded ought to be ineffectual and invalid. But Cato took exception\r\nto what Cicero said, and at length he rose and declared, that he was\r\nof opinion that there was nothing sound or good in any degree in the\r\nadministration of Clodius, but that if any man was for rescinding all\r\nthat Clodius had done in his tribunate, all his own measures relating\r\nto Cyprus were thereby rescinded, and his mission had not been legal,\r\nhaving been proposed by a man who was not legally tribune: he\r\nmaintained that Clodius had not been illegally elected tribune by\r\nvirtue of being adopted out of the patrician body into a plebeian\r\nfamily, for the law allowed this; but if he had been a bad magistrate,\r\nlike others, it was fitting to call to account the man who had done\r\nwrong, and not to annul the office which had been wronged also. In\r\nconsequence of this, Cicero was angry with Cato, and for a long time\r\nceased all friendly intercourse with him: however, they were\r\nafterwards reconciled.\r\n\r\nXLI. After this Pompeius and Crassus[721] had a meeting with Cæsar,\r\nwho had come across the Alps, in which they agreed that they should\r\nseek a second consulship; and when they were established in it, they\r\nshould cause another period in Cæsar's government as long as the first\r\nto be given him by the vote of the people, and to themselves the chief\r\nof the provinces and money and military forces: the which was a\r\nconspiracy for the division of the supreme power and the destruction\r\nof the constitution. Now though many honest men were at this time\r\npreparing to be candidates for the consulship, they were deterred by\r\nseeing Pompeius and Crassus canvassing; but Lucius Domitius alone, the\r\nhusband of Porcia, the sister of Cato, was induced by Cato not to give\r\nway or to yield, as the contest was not for office but for the liberty\r\nof Rome. And indeed it was currently said among that part of the\r\ncitizens who were still of sober thoughts, that they ought not to\r\nallow the consular office to become completely overbearing and\r\noppressive by permitting the power of Crassus and Pompeius to be\r\ncombined, but that they should deprive one of them of the office. And\r\nthey ranged themselves on the side of Domitius, urging and encouraging\r\nhim to keep to his purpose; for many, they argued, even of those who\r\nsaid nothing by reason of fear, would help him with their votes. The\r\nparty of Pompeius and Crassus fearing this, laid an ambuscade for\r\nDomitius as he was going down to the Campus Martius early in the\r\nmorning, by torch-light. First of all the man who was lighting\r\nDomitius and standing close by him was struck and fell down dead; and\r\nafter him others also being wounded, there was a general flight of all\r\nexcept Cato and Domitius; for Cato held Domitius though he himself was\r\nwounded in the arm, and urged him to stay and so long as there was\r\nbreath in them, not to give up the struggle for liberty against the\r\ntyrants who showed how they would use their power, by making their\r\nway to it through such acts of wrong.\r\n\r\nXLII. Domitius, however, did not face the danger, but fled to his\r\nhouse, upon which Pompeius and Crassus,[722] were elected. Yet Cato\r\ndid not give up the contest, but came forward as a candidate for a\r\nprætorship, because he wished to have a strong position in his\r\nstruggles with them and not to be himself a private man while he was\r\nopposing those who were in office. Pompeius and Crassus being afraid\r\nof this, and considering that the prætorship by reason of Cato would\r\nbecome a match for the consulship, in the first place on a sudden and\r\nwithout the knowledge of many of the body, summoned the Senate, and\r\ngot a vote passed that those who were elected prætors should enter on\r\noffice forthwith and should not let the time fixed by law intervene,\r\nduring which time prosecutions were allowed of those who had bribed\r\nthe people. In the next place, now that they had by the vote of the\r\nSenate made bribery free from all responsibility, they brought forward\r\ntheir own tools and friends as candidates for the prætorship,\r\nthemselves giving the bribe-money, and themselves standing by while\r\nthe voting was going on. But when the merit and good name of Cato were\r\ngetting the superiority even over all this, the many for very shame\r\nconsidering it a great crime by their votes to sell Cato, whom it were\r\neven honourable to purchase for the state as prætor, and the tribe\r\nwhich was first called voted for him, Pompeius all at once, falsely\r\nsaying he had heard thunder, dissolved the assembly, for it was the\r\ncustom of the Romans to view such tokens as inauspicious, and not to\r\nratify anything when there had been signs from heaven. Thereafter, by\r\nemploying excessive bribery and driving all the honest folks from the\r\nCampus they brought about by violence that Vatinius should be elected\r\nprætor instead of Cato. Upon this it is said that those who had given\r\ntheir votes thus illegally and dishonestly, forthwith skulked away;\r\nand a certain tribune forming on the spot a meeting of those who were\r\nassembling together and expressing their dissatisfaction, Cato came\r\nbefore them, and as if inspired by the gods, foretold everything that\r\nwould happen to the state, and urged the citizens to oppose Pompeius\r\nand Crassus as being privy to such measures and engaging in a course\r\nof policy, on account of which they feared Cato lest, if he were\r\nprætor, he should get the advantage over them. And finally as he went\r\nhome, he was attended by such a crowd as not even all the prætors\r\ntogether, who were elected, had to accompany them.\r\n\r\nXLIII. When Caius Trebonius[723] drew up a law for the division of the\r\nprovinces between the consuls, to the effect that one of them should\r\nhave the government of Iberia and Libya, and the other Syria and\r\nEgypt, to attack and carry on war against whom they pleased with naval\r\nand military forces, the rest despairing of all opposition and\r\nhindrance even desisted from speaking against the measure, and when\r\nCato got up on the Rostra before the question was put to the vote, and\r\nexpressed a wish to speak, he with difficulty obtained leave to speak\r\nfor two hours.[724] After Cato had occupied this time with much\r\nspeaking, and alleging of arguments and prophetic warnings, they would\r\nnot let him speak longer, but an officer went up and pulled him down\r\nwhile he was still keeping his place on the Rostra. But inasmuch as he\r\ncontinued to cry out from the place where he was standing below, and\r\nhad persons to listen to him and join in his dissatisfaction, the\r\nofficer again laid hold of him and taking him away, put him out of the\r\nForum. But scarcely was he let loose when he returned and made his way\r\nto the Rostra with loud shouts, urging the citizens to aid him. This\r\nbeing repeated several times, Trebonius in a passion ordered him to be\r\nled to prison, and the crowd followed listening to him talking as he\r\nwent along, so that Trebonius was afraid and let him go. In this\r\nmanner Cato took up all that day: but on the following days by\r\nterrifying some of the citizens and gaining over others by favours and\r\nby bribes, and with armed men preventing Aquilius[725] one of the\r\ntribunes from coming out of the senate house, and by ejecting from the\r\nForum Cato himself, who called out that there had been thunder, and by\r\nwounding no small number, and even killing some, they forcibly carried\r\nthe law, in consequence of which many persons in passion crowded\r\ntogether and pelted the statues of Pompeius. Cato, however, who came\r\nup to them stopped this; and further, when a law was proposed\r\nrespecting the provinces and armies of Cæsar, Cato no longer addressed\r\nhimself to the people, but turning to Pompeius himself he adjured and\r\nforewarned him, that he did not see that he was now taking up Cæsar on\r\nhis shoulders, but that when he began to feel the weight of his burden\r\nand to be mastered by it, having neither power to rid himself of it\r\nnor strength to bear it, he would fall with it upon the state, and\r\nthen he would remember Cato's advice and see that it concerned no less\r\nthe interests of Pompeius than honour and justice. Though Pompeius\r\nheard this often, he cared not for it and let it pass, not believing\r\nthere would be any change in Cæsar, because he trusted in his own good\r\nfortune and power.\r\n\r\nXLIV. For the following year Cato was chosen prætor,[726] but he was\r\nconsidered not to add so much dignity and honour to the office by his\r\ngood administration, as to detract from it and bring it into disrepute\r\nby often going to the Rostra without his shoes and his tunic, and in\r\nthis attire presiding at trials of men of rank in matters of life and\r\ndeath. Some also say that even after dinner, when he had drunk wine,\r\nhe would transact business; but this at least is untruly said. The\r\npeople being now corrupted by the bribery of those who were ambitious\r\nof office, and the majority being accustomed to receive money for\r\ntheir votes as if in the way of a regular trade, Cato wishing to\r\neradicate completely this disease in the state, persuaded the Senate\r\nto make a decree, that if those who were elected magistrates should\r\nhave none ready to accuse them, they should themselves be compelled to\r\ncome forward before a sworn court and give an account of their\r\nelection. The candidates for magistracies were vexed at this, and\r\nstill more vexed were the mass who received the bribe-money.\r\nAccordingly in the morning when Cato had gone to the tribunal, the\r\npeople in a body pressing upon him, cried out, abused him, and pelted\r\nhim so that every person fled from the tribunal, and Cato himself\r\nbeing shoved from his place by the crowd and carried along with it,\r\nwith difficulty laid hold of the Rostra. Thereupon getting up, by the\r\nboldness and firmness of his demeanour, Cato forthwith mastered the\r\ntumult, and stopped the shouting, and after saying what was suitable\r\nto the occasion and being listened to with perfect quiet, he put an\r\nend to the disturbance. When the Senate were bestowing praise upon\r\nhim, he said, \"But I cannot praise you, who left a prætor in danger\r\nand did not come to his help.\" But of the candidates for magistracies\r\nevery man felt himself in a difficult position, being afraid to give\r\nbribes himself, and being afraid that he should lose the office if\r\nanother did it. Accordingly it was agreed among them that they should\r\ncome together to one place, and each lay down one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five thousand drachmæ of silver, and all should then seek the\r\noffice in a right and just way, and that he who broke the terms and\r\nemployed bribery, should lose his money. Having agreed to these terms\r\nthey chose Cato as depositary and umpire and witness, and bringing the\r\nmoney, they offered to place it with him; and they had the terms of\r\nthe agreement drawn up before him, but Cato took sureties instead of\r\nthe money, and would not receive the money itself. When the day for\r\nthe election came, Cato taking his place by the presiding tribune and\r\nwatching the vote, discovered that one of those who had entered into\r\nthe engagement, was playing foul, and he ordered him to pay the money\r\nto the rest. But they, commending his uprightness and admiring it,\r\nwaived the penalty, considering that they had sufficient satisfaction\r\nfrom the wrong-doer; but Cato offended all the rest and got very great\r\nodium from this, it being as if he assumed to himself the power of the\r\nSenate and of the courts of justice and of the magistrates. For the\r\nopinion and the credit of no one virtue makes people more envious than\r\nthat of justice,[727] because both æpower and credit among the many\r\nfollow it chiefly. For people do not merely honour the just, as they\r\ndo the brave, nor do they admire them, as they do the wise, but they\r\neven love the just, and have confidence in them and give them credit.\r\nBut as to the brave and wise, they fear the one, and give no credit to\r\nthe other; and besides this, they think that the brave and the wise\r\nexcel by nature rather than by their own will; and with respect to\r\ncourage and wisdom, they consider the one to be a certain sharpness,\r\nand the other a firmness of soul; but inasmuch as any man who chooses,\r\nhas it in his power to be just, they have most abhorrence of injustice\r\nas badness that is without excuse.\r\n\r\nXLV. Wherefore all the great were enemies of Cato, as being reproved\r\nby his conduct: and as Pompeius viewed Cato's reputation even as a\r\nnullification of his own power, he was continually setting persons on\r\nto abuse him, among whom Clodius also was one, the demagogue, who had\r\nagain insensibly attached himself to Pompeius, and was crying out\r\nagainst Cato on the ground that he had appropriated to his own\r\npurposes much money in Cyprus, and was hostile to Pompeius because\r\nPompeius had rejected a marriage with Cato's daughter. Cato replied\r\nthat he had brought to the city from Cyprus, without the aid of a\r\nsingle horse or soldier, more money than Pompeius had brought back\r\nfrom so many wars and triumphs after disturbing the habitable world,\r\nand that he never chose Pompeius to make a marriage alliance with, not\r\nbecause he considered Pompeius unworthy, but because he saw the\r\ndifference between his polity and that of Pompeius. \"For my part,\"\r\ncontinued Cato, \"I declined a province when it was offered to me after\r\nmy prætorship, but Pompeius has got some provinces, and he also offers\r\nsome to others; and now, last of all, he has lent to Cæsar a force of\r\nsix thousand legionary soldiers for Gaul, which neither did Cæsar ask\r\nof you, nor did Pompeius give with your assent; but forces to such an\r\namount and arms and horses are gifts from private persons and things\r\nof mutual exchange. And being called Imperator and governor he has\r\ngiven up to others the armies and the provinces, and he himself sits\r\ndown close to the city raising commotions at the elections and\r\ncontriving disturbances, from which it is manifest that he is\r\nintriguing to get by means of anarchy a monarchy for himself.\"\r\n\r\nXLVI. In this fashion Cato defended himself against Pompeius. But\r\nMarcus Favonius, an intimate friend and admirer of Cato, just as\r\nApollodorus[728] of Phalerum is said to have been of Socrates of old,\r\nbeing a passionate man and one who was violently moved by his\r\nprinciples, did not with any temper or moderation, but intemperately\r\nattack Pompeius, like a man under the influence of drink and somewhat\r\nmad. Favonius was a candidate for the ædileship and was losing his\r\nelection, when Cato, who was present, observed that the voting tablets\r\nwere written in one hand, and so proved the knavery, and by appealing\r\nto the tribunes stopped the return. Afterwards when Favonius was made\r\nædile, Cato both administered the other duties of the ædileship, and\r\nsuperintended the exhibitions in the theatre, giving to the actors not\r\ncrowns of gold, but as is the fashion of Olympia, crowns of wild\r\nolive, and instead of costly presents, giving to the Greeks, turnips\r\nand lettuces and radishes and parsley;[729] and to the Romans, earthen\r\njars of wine, and hogs' flesh, and figs and gourds, and bundles of\r\nwood, at the thrift of which gifts some laughed, but others treated\r\nthe matter in a respectful way, seeing the austere and serious\r\ncountenance of Cato imperceptibly assuming a pleasant expression.\r\nFinally, Favonius, mingling with, the crowd and sitting among the\r\nspectators, applauded Cato, and called out to him to give to those who\r\nwere distinguishing themselves, and to honour them, and he urged the\r\nspectators to the same effect, inasmuch as he had surrendered all his\r\nauthority to Cato. Now in the other theatre, Curio, the colleague of\r\nFavonius, was conducting the celebration in splendid style, but still\r\nthe people left him to go to the other place, and they readily joined\r\nin the amusement of Favonius playing a private part and Cato the part\r\nof the superintendent of the exhibitions. And Cato did this to\r\ndisparage the thing and to show that when a man is in sport he should\r\nuse sportive ways, and accompany it with unpretending kindness rather\r\nthan with much preparation and great cost, bestowing great care and\r\ntrouble on things of no value.\r\n\r\nXLVII. Now when Scipio and Hypsæus and Milo[730] were candidates for\r\nthe consulship, and were employing not merely those wrongful ways that\r\nwere now familiar and had become usual in matters political, the\r\ngiving of gifts and bribery, but were plainly pushing on through arms\r\nand slaughter to civil war, in their daring and madness, and some\r\npersons were urging Pompeius to preside over the comitia, Cato at\r\nfirst opposed this and said, that the laws should not owe their\r\nmaintenance to Pompeius, but that Pompeius should owe his security to\r\nthe laws. However, when there had been an anarchy for some time, and\r\nthree armies were occupying the Forum daily, and the mischief had well\r\nnigh become past checking, he determined in favour of putting affairs\r\nin the hands of Pompeius before the extreme necessity arrived, by the\r\nvoluntary favour of the Senate, and by employing the most moderate of\r\nunconstitutional means as a healing measure for the settlement of what\r\nwas most important, to bring on the monarchy rather than to let the\r\ncivil dissensions result in a monarchy. Accordingly Bibulus, who was\r\na friend of Cato, proposed that they ought to elect Pompeius sole\r\nconsul, for that either matters would be put into a good condition by\r\nhis settlement of them, or that the state would be enslaved by the\r\nbest man in it. Cato rose and spoke in favour of the proposal, which\r\nnobody could have expected, and recommended any government as better\r\nthan no government; and he added, that he expected that Pompeius would\r\nmanage present affairs best, and would protect the state with which he\r\nwas intrusted.\r\n\r\nXLVIII. Pompeius[731] being thus declared consul prayed Cato to come\r\nto him to the suburbs: and on his arrival Pompeius received him in a\r\nfriendly manner with salutations and pressing of hands, and after\r\nacknowledging his obligations he entreated Cato to be his adviser and\r\nhis assessor in the consulship. But Cato replied, that neither had he\r\nsaid what he first said out of evil disposition towards Pompeius, nor\r\nhad he said what he last said in order to win his favour, but\r\neverything for the interest of the state; accordingly he observed that\r\nhe would give Pompeius his advice when he was privately invited, but\r\nthat in public, even if he should not be invited, he would certainly\r\nsay what he thought. And he did as he said. In the first place, when\r\nPompeius was proposing laws with new penalties and severe proceedings\r\nagainst those who had already bribed the people, Cato advised him not\r\nto care about the past, but to attend to the future, for he said, it\r\nwas not easy to determine at what point the inquiry into past offences\r\nshould stop, and if penalties be imposed after the offences, those\r\nwould be hardly dealt with who were punished by a law which they were\r\nnot breaking at the time of their wrong-doing. In the next place, when\r\nmany men of rank were under trial, some of whom were friends and\r\nrelations of Pompeius, Cato observing that Pompeius was giving way to\r\nthe greater part of them and yielding, rebuked him firmly and roused\r\nhim up. Though Pompeius himself had caused a law to be passed which\r\ndid not allow the panegyrics which used to be pronounced on those who\r\nwere under trial, he wrote a panegyric on Munatius Plancus[732] on\r\nthe occasion of his trial and handed it in, but Cato by stopping his\r\nears with his hands, for he happened to be one of the judices,\r\nprevented the testimonial from being read. Plancus challenged Cato as\r\none of the judices after the speeches, but nevertheless he was\r\nconvicted. And altogether Cato was a kind of thing difficult and\r\nunmanageable for persons accused, as they were neither willing to have\r\nhim to be a judex, nor could they venture to challenge him. For not a\r\nfew were convicted because, by being unwilling to have Cato for one of\r\ntheir judices, they were considered to show that they had no\r\nconfidence in the justice of their cause; and their revilers even\r\ncharged it upon some as matter of great reproach that they would not\r\nhave Cato as one of their judices when he was proposed.\r\n\r\nXLIX. Now when Cæsar, though he kept close to his armies in Gaul and\r\nstuck to arms, was still employing gifts and money and friends to\r\nsecure his power in the city, Cato's admonitions roused Pompeius from\r\nhis former long continued state of incredulity, and he began to be\r\nafraid of the danger; but as he was somewhat hesitating and\r\nspiritlessly procrastinating all attempts at prevention, Cato resolved\r\nto be a candidate for the consulship with the view of either forthwith\r\nwresting Cæsar's arms from him or demonstrating his designs. But the\r\nrival candidates were both popular men: and Sulpicius[733] had already\r\nderived much advantage from Cato's reputation in the state and his\r\ninfluence. He therefore seemed to be doing what was neither just nor\r\ngrateful, but yet Cato found no fault with him. \"What is it strange,\"\r\nsaid he, \"if a man does not give up to another the thing which he\r\nthinks to be the greatest of goods?\" But Cato by persuading the Senate\r\nto pass a Consultum that those who were candidates for the office\r\nshould canvass the people themselves, and should not solicit through\r\nany other person, not even by such person going about to see the\r\ncitizens on their behalf, still more irritated the citizens, in that\r\nby depriving them not only of the opportunity of receiving money, but\r\neven of conferring a favour, he rendered the people at once poor and\r\ndishonoured. In addition to this, as Cato had neither any persuasive\r\nmanners in canvassing for himself, but wished to maintain the dignity\r\nof his life in his character rather than to add to it that of the\r\nconsulship by shaking hands with the electors, and as he would not\r\nallow his friends to do the things by which the mass are taken and\r\ngained over, he lost the office.\r\n\r\nL. Though the matter caused not only to those who failed, but to their\r\nfriends and kin a certain degree of shame and depression and sorrow\r\nfor many days, Cato bore what had happened with so little concern,\r\nthat after anointing himself in the Campus he exercised at ball, and\r\nagain after dinner, according to his wont, he went down into the Forum\r\nwithout his shoes and tunic, and walked about with his intimates. But\r\nCicero blames him, that when the times required such a magistrate, he\r\nused no exertion nor tried to gain the favour of the people by\r\nfriendly intercourse with them, but for the future ceased to make any\r\neffort and gave up the contest, though he was again a candidate for\r\nthe prætorship. Cato, however, said, that he lost the prætorship not\r\nby the real will of the majority, but because they were forced or\r\ncorrupted; whereas in the voting for the consulship, in which there\r\nwas no foul play, he further perceived that he had displeased the\r\npeople by his manners, which it was not the part of a man of sense to\r\nchange in order to please others, nor, if he still kept to the like\r\nmanners, to subject himself to the like treatment.\r\n\r\nLI. When Cæsar had attacked warlike nations and had conquered them\r\nwith great hazard, and when it was the opinion that he had fallen upon\r\nthe Germans even after a truce had been made, and had destroyed three\r\nhundred thousand[734] of them, the rest indeed were promising to the\r\npeople to offer sacrifices for the victory, but Cato urged that they\r\nshould give up Cæsar to those who had been wronged, and should not\r\nturn the guilt upon themselves nor allow it to fall on the state.\r\n\"However,\" said he, \"let us still sacrifice to the gods, that they do\r\nnot turn their vengeance for the madness and desperation of the\r\ncommander upon the soldiers, and that they spare the city.\" Upon this\r\nCæsar wrote and sent a letter to the Senate; and when the letter had\r\nbeen read, which contained much abuse of Cato and many charges against\r\nhim, Cato got up, and not under the influence of passion or personal\r\nanimosity, but as if it were on good consideration and due\r\npreparation, showed that the charges against him were in the nature of\r\nabuse and insult, and were pure trifling and mockery on Cæsar's part.\r\nThen taking hold of all Cæsar's measures from the first, and unveiling\r\nall his plans, not as if he were an enemy, but a fellow conspirator\r\nand participator, he proved to them that they had no reason to fear\r\nthe sons of the Britons nor yet the Celts, but Cæsar himself, if they\r\nwere prudent; and he so worked on and excited them that the friends of\r\nCæsar repented of having read the letter in the Senate, and so given\r\nCato an opportunity of making a fair statement and true charges.\r\nNothing, however, was done, but it was merely said that it would be\r\nwell for a successor to Cæsar to be appointed. But when Cæsar's\r\nfriends required that Pompeius also should lay down his arms and give\r\nup his provinces, or that Cæsar should not, Cato cried out, that now\r\nwhat he foretold them had come to pass, and that the man was having\r\nrecourse to force and was openly employing the power which he had got\r\nby deceiving and gulling the state; yet Cato could do nothing out of\r\ndoors, because the people all along wished Cæsar to have the chief\r\npower, and he found the Senate ready to assent to his measures, but\r\nafraid of the people.\r\n\r\nLII. But when Ariminum[735] was captured, and news came that Cæsar\r\nwith his army was advancing against the city, then indeed all men\r\nturned their eyes on Cato, both the people and Pompeius, as the only\r\nman who from the first had foreseen and who had first clearly shown\r\nthe designs of Cæsar. Accordingly Cato said, \"Men, if any among you\r\nhad listened to what I had all along been foretelling and advising,\r\nyou would neither have to fear a single man now, nor would you have to\r\nrest all your hopes on a single man.\" Upon Pompeius saying that Cato\r\nhad indeed spoken more like a prophet, but that he had acted more like\r\na friend, Cato advised the Senate to place affairs in the hands of\r\nPompeius alone, for it was the business of those who caused great\r\nevils to put an end to them. Now as Pompeius had not a force in\r\nreadiness, and he saw that the troops which he was then levying had no\r\nzeal, he left Rome. Cato having determined to follow Pompeius in his\r\nflight, sent his younger son into the country of the Bruttii[736] to\r\nMunatius for safe keeping, but the elder he took with him. And as his\r\nhousehold and daughters required some one to look after them, he took\r\nagain Marcia, who was now a widow with a large estate, for Hortensius\r\nat his death had made her his heir. It was with reference to this that\r\nCæsar[737] vented most abuse on Cato, and charged him with\r\ncovetousness and making a traffic of his marriage; for why should he\r\ngive up his wife, said Cæsar, if he still wanted one, or why should he\r\ntake her back, if he did not want one? if it was not that from the\r\nfirst[738] the woman was put as a bait in the way of Hortensius, and\r\nCato gave her up when she was young that he might have her back when\r\nshe was rich. Now, in reply to these charges, this from Euripides\r\nsuffices:--\r\n\r\n    \"First then what can't be said, for of this kind\r\n    I deem thy so call'd cowardice, O Hercules.\"\r\n\r\nFor to accuse Cato of filthy lucre is like upbraiding Hercules with\r\ncowardice. But whether the matter of the marriage was not well in\r\nother respects is a thing for inquiry. However, Cato did espouse\r\nMarcia, and intrusting to her his family and daughters, hurried after\r\nPompeius.\r\n\r\nLIII. From that day it is said that Cato never cut the hair of his\r\nhead or beard, nor put on a chaplet, but maintained till his death the\r\nsame outward signs of sorrow and depression of spirits and grief over\r\nthe misfortunes of his country, just the same when his party was\r\nvictorious and when it was vanquished. At that time having got by lot\r\nSicily as his province, he crossed over to Syracuse, and on hearing\r\nthat Asinius Pollio[739] had arrived from the enemy with a large force\r\nat Messene, he sent to him to demand the reason of his coming. But\r\nCato in turn being asked for the reason of the change in affairs, and\r\nhaving heard that Pompeius had completely deserted Italy and was\r\nencamped in Dyrrachium, he said that there was great perplexity and\r\nuncertainty in matters appertaining to the gods. Pompeius, who had\r\nalways been invincible while he was doing what was not honest or just,\r\nnow when he wished to save his country and fight in defence of\r\nliberty, was deserted by his good fortune. As to Asinius, he said that\r\nhe was able to drive him out of Sicily, but as another greater force\r\nwas coming against him, he did not choose to ruin the island by a war;\r\nand after advising the Syracusans to join the victorious party and to\r\ntake care of themselves, he sailed away. When he came to Pompeius, he\r\nkept steadily to one opinion, to prolong the war, for he expected\r\nsome terms of reconciliation and did not wish that the state should be\r\nworsted in a battle and suffer from itself the extreme of sufferings\r\nby having its fate determined by the sword. And he persuaded Pompeius\r\nand his council to other determinations akin to these, neither to\r\nplunder any city that was subject to the Romans, nor to put to death\r\nany Roman except on the field of battle; and he gained good opinion\r\nand brought over many to the side of Pompeius, who were pleased with\r\nhis moderation and mildness.\r\n\r\nLIV. Being sent to Asia to help those there who were collecting\r\nvessels and an army, he took with him his sister Servilia and her\r\nyoung child by Lucullus. For Servilia, who was now a widow, followed\r\nCato, and she removed much of the evil report about her licentious\r\nconduct by voluntarily subjecting herself to the guardianship of Cato\r\nand his wanderings and mode of life. But Cæsar[740] did not spare his\r\nabuse of Cato even with respect to Servilia. However as it seems the\r\ngenerals of Pompeius did not want the assistance of Cato at all; and\r\nafter persuading the Rhodians to join the side of Pompeius and leaving\r\nServilia and the child there, he returned to Pompeius, who had already\r\na splendid military force and a naval power with him. Here indeed\r\nPompeius appeared most clearly to show his mind; for at first he\r\nintended to give to Cato the command of the ships, and the fighting\r\nvessels were not fewer than five hundred, and the Liburnian and spy\r\nships and open boats were very numerous: but having soon perceived, or\r\nit having been hinted to him by his friends, that it was the one chief\r\nthing in all the policy of Cato to liberate his country, and that if\r\nhe should have the command of so great a force, the very day on which\r\nthey should defeat Cæsar, Cato would require Pompeius also to lay down\r\nhis arms and to follow the laws, he changed his mind though he had\r\nalready spoken with him, and he appointed Bibulus commander of the\r\nships. Yet he found not Cato's zeal dulled by this; for it is told\r\nthat when Pompeius was urging his troops to a battle before Dyrrachium\r\nand bidding each of the commanders say something and to encourage the\r\nmen, the soldiers heard them with listlessness and silence; but when\r\nCato, after the rest, had gone through all the topics derived from\r\nphilosophy that were suitable to the occasion to be said about liberty\r\nand virtue, and death and good fame, with great emotion on his part,\r\nand finally addressed himself to invoke the gods as being there\r\npresent and watching over the struggle on behalf of their country,\r\nthere was so loud an acclamation and so great a movement in the whole\r\narmy thus excited, that all the commanders hastened to the contest\r\nfull of hopes. The soldiers of Pompeius routed and defeated the enemy,\r\nbut the dæmon of Cæsar prevented the completion of the victory by\r\ntaking advantage of the caution of Pompeius and his want of confidence\r\nin his success. Now this is told in the Life of Pompeius.[741] But\r\nwhile all were rejoicing and magnifying the victory, Cato wept for his\r\ncountry and bewailed the love of power that brought destruction and\r\nmisfortune with it, when he saw that many brave citizens had fallen by\r\nthe hands of one another.\r\n\r\nLV. When Pompeius in order to pursue Cæsar broke up his camp to march\r\ninto Thessaly, he left at Dyrrachium a great quantity of arms and\r\nstores, and many kinsmen and friends, and he appointed Cato commander\r\nand guardian over all with fifteen cohorts, both because he trusted\r\nand feared the man. For if he were defeated, he considered that Cato\r\nwould be his surest support; but that if he were victorious, Cato\r\nwould not, if he were present, let him manage matters as he chose.\r\nMany men of rank also were left behind in Dyrrachium with Cato. When\r\nthe defeat at Pharsalus took place, Cato resolved that if Pompeius\r\nwere dead, he would take over to Italy those who were with him, and\r\nhimself would live an exile as far from the tyranny as possible; but\r\nif Pompeius were alive, that he would by all means keep together the\r\nforce for him. Accordingly having crossed over to Cercyra, where the\r\nnavy was, he proposed to give up the command to Cicero, who was a\r\nconsular, while he was only of prætorian rank; but when Cicero would\r\nnot accept the command and set off for Italy, Cato observing that\r\nPompeius[742] through his stubborn self-will and unreasonable temper\r\nwas desirous of punishing those who were sailing away, privately\r\nadmonished and pacified him, by which Cato manifestly saved Cicero\r\nfrom death and secured the safety of the rest.\r\n\r\nLVI. Conjecturing that Pompeius Magnus would make his escape to Egypt\r\nor to Libya, and being in haste to join him, Cato with all whom he had\r\nabout him weighed anchor and set sail after permitting all those to go\r\naway or stay behind who were not ready to accompany him. He reached\r\nLibya, and coasting along he fell in with Sextus,[743] the younger son\r\nof Pompeius, who reported to him his father's death in Egypt. Now they\r\nwere all much troubled, and no one after the death of Pompeius would\r\nobey any other commander while Cato was present. Wherefore Cato, out\r\nof respect to those who were with him, and because he had not heart to\r\ndesert and leave in difficulties the brave men who had given proof of\r\ntheir fidelity, undertook the command and went along the coast till he\r\ncame to Cyrene; for the people received him though a few days before\r\nthey had shut out Labienus. Upon hearing that Scipio, the\r\nfather-in-law of Pompeius, had been well received by King Juba, and\r\nthat Varus Attius, who had been appointed governor of Libya by\r\nPompeius, was with them with a force, he set out by land in the winter\r\nseason, having got together a number of asses to carry water, and\r\ndriving along with him a quantity of cattle, and also taking chariots\r\nand the people called Psylli,[744] who cure the bites of serpents by\r\nsucking out the poison with their mouths, and deaden and soothe the\r\nserpents themselves by charming them with music. Though the march was\r\nseven days in succession, Cato led at the head of his men without\r\nusing horse or beast of burden. And he continued to sup in a sitting\r\nposture from the day that he heard of the defeat at Pharsalus, and he\r\nadded this further sign of his sorrow, never to lie down except when\r\nhe was sleeping. Having spent the winter in Libya[745] he led forth\r\nhis army; and the men were near ten thousand.\r\n\r\nLVII. Matters were in bad plight between Scipio and Varus, for in\r\nconsequence of their disagreement and disunion they were secretly\r\ntrying to win the favour of Juba,[746] who was intolerable for the\r\narrogance of his temper and his haughtiness by reason of his wealth\r\nand power. When he was going to have his first interview with Cato,\r\nJuba placed his seat between the seats of Scipio and Cato. However,\r\nwhen Cato observed it, he took up his seat and moved it to the other\r\nside so as to leave Scipio in the middle, though Scipio was his enemy,\r\nand had published a certain writing which contained abuse of Cato.\r\nThis, indeed, people make no account of; but they blame Cato that in\r\nSicily he placed Philostratus[747] in the middle, as he was walking\r\nabout with him, to do honour to philosophy. On this occasion, however,\r\nhe checked Juba, who had all but made Scipio and Varus his satraps,\r\nand he reconciled them. Though all invited Cato to the command, and\r\nScipio and Varus were the first to surrender and give it up to him, he\r\nsaid that he would not break the laws in defence of which they were\r\nfighting against him who broke them, nor would he place himself, who\r\nwas a proprætor, before a proconsul who was present. For Scipio had\r\nbeen appointed proconsul, and the majority, on account of the name,\r\nhad confidence that they should be successful, if a Scipio commanded\r\nin Libya.\r\n\r\nLVIII. However when Scipio[748] immediately on receiving the command,\r\nwished to please Juba by putting to death all the people of Utica who\r\nwere capable of bearing arms, and to dig down the city, because it\r\nfavoured Cæsar, Cato would not endure this, but with adjurations and\r\nloud cries in the council and by appealing to the gods he with\r\ndifficulty rescued the people from their cruelty; and partly at the\r\nrequest of the citizens of Utica[749] and partly at the instance of\r\nScipio, he undertook to keep guard in the city, that it should not\r\neither involuntarily or voluntarily join Cæsar. For the place was in\r\nall respects advantageous, and defensible by those who held it; and it\r\nwas strengthened still more by Cato. For he brought abundance of corn\r\ninto the city, and he strengthened the walls by raising towers, and\r\nmaking strong ditches and palisado-work in front of the city. To the\r\npeople of Utica who were able to bear arms he assigned the\r\npalisado-work as their quarter, and made them give up their arms to\r\nhim; but he kept the rest in the city, and took great care that they\r\nshould not be wronged and should suffer no harm from the Romans. He\r\nalso sent out a great quantity of arms, supplies and grain to those\r\nin camp, and altogether he made the city the storehouse for the war.\r\nBut the advice which he gave Pompeius before, and gave Scipio then,\r\nnot to fight with a man of a warlike turn and great ability, but to\r\ntake advantage of time which wastes all the vigour wherein the\r\nstrength of tyranny lies, Scipio through self-will despised; and on\r\none occasion he wrote to Cato upbraiding him with cowardice, in that\r\nhe was not content to sit down within a city and walls, but would not\r\neven let others boldly use their own judgment as opportunity offered.\r\nTo this Cato replied, that he was ready to take the legionary soldiers\r\nand horsemen whom he had brought into Libya, and carry them over to\r\nItaly, and so make Cæsar change his place and to turn him from them to\r\nhimself. And when Scipio mocked at this also, it was clear that Cato\r\nwas much annoyed that he had declined the command, for he saw that\r\nScipio would neither conduct the war well, nor, if he should succeed\r\ncontrary to expectation, would he behave with moderation to the\r\ncitizens in his victory. Accordingly Cato formed the opinion and\r\nmentioned it to some of his friends, that he had no good hopes of the\r\nwar on account of the inexperience and confidence of the commanders,\r\nbut if there should be any good fortune, and Cæsar should be worsted,\r\nhe would not stay in Rome, and would fly from the harshness and\r\ncruelty of Scipio, who was even then uttering dreadful and extravagant\r\nthreats against many. But it turned out worse than he expected; and\r\nlate in the evening there arrived a messenger from the camp who had\r\nbeen three days on the road, with the news that a great battle had\r\nbeen fought at Thapsus[750] in which their affairs were entirely\r\nruined, that Cæsar was in possession of the camps, Scipio and Juba had\r\nescaped with a few men, and the rest of the army was destroyed.\r\n\r\nLIX. On the arrival of this intelligence, the city, as was natural on\r\nthe receipt of such news by night and in time of war, nearly lost its\r\nreason, and hardly contained itself within the walls; but Cato coming\r\nforward, whenever he met with any one running about and calling out,\r\nlaid hold of him, and cheering him took away the excessive fright and\r\nconfusion of his alarm, by saying that matters perchance were not so\r\nbad as they had been reported, but were magnified by rumour; and so he\r\nstayed the tumult. At daybreak he made proclamation that the three\r\nhundred, whom he had as a Senate, and these were Romans, and were\r\ncarrying on business in Libya as merchants and money-lenders, should\r\nassemble at the temple of Jupiter, and also all the Roman senators who\r\nwere present and their sons. While they were still assembling, Cato\r\nadvanced, without hurry and with a tranquil countenance, as if nothing\r\nnew had happened, holding a book in his hand, which he was reading;\r\nand this was a register of the military engines, arms, corn, bows, and\r\nlegionary soldiers. When they had come together, beginning with the\r\nthree hundred, and commending at some length the zeal and fidelity\r\nwhich they had displayed in aiding with their means and persons and\r\nadvice, he exhorted them not to let their hopes be destroyed, and not\r\nseverally to provide for their flight or escape. For, he said, that if\r\nthey would keep together, Cæsar would despise them less if they made\r\nresistance, and would spare them more if they asked his mercy. And he\r\nurged them to deliberate about themselves, and that he would not find\r\nfault with their deciding either way, and if they should be disposed\r\nto turn to the fortunate side, he should attribute the change to\r\nnecessity; but if they preferred to oppose the danger and to undertake\r\nthe hazard in defence of liberty, he should not only commend them, but\r\nadmire their virtue, and make himself their commander and\r\nfellow-combatant, till they had tried the last fortune of their\r\ncountry, which was not Utica or Adrumetum only, but Rome, that had\r\noften by her might recovered from greater falls. And they had many\r\ngrounds for safety and security; and chief of all, that they were\r\nwarring against a man who was pulled in many directions by the\r\ncircumstances of the times, for Iberia had gone over to Pompeius the\r\nyoung, and Rome herself had not yet altogether received the bit for\r\nwant of being used to it, but was impatient of suffering and ready to\r\nrise up collected upon every change, and danger was not a thing to\r\nfly from, but they should take as a pattern the enemy, who was not\r\nsparing of his life for accomplishing the greatest wrongs, and for\r\nwhom the uncertainty of the war had not the same result as for them,\r\nto whom it would bring the happiest life, if they were successful, and\r\nthe most glorious death if they failed. However, he said they ought to\r\ndeliberate by themselves, and he joined them in praying that in\r\nconsideration of their former virtue and zeal what they resolved might\r\nbe for the best.\r\n\r\nLX. When Cato had spoken to this effect, some of them indeed were\r\nbrought to confidence by his words; but the greater part seeing his\r\nfearlessness and noble and generous temper, nearly forgot present\r\ncircumstances, and considering him alone as an invincible leader and\r\nsuperior to all fortune, prayed him to use their persons and property\r\nand arms as he judged best, for they said it was better to die in\r\nobedience to him than to save their lives by betraying such virtue. On\r\na certain person observing that they should declare freedom to the\r\nslaves, and most of them assenting to this, Cato said he would not do\r\nso, for it was not lawful nor yet right; but if the masters were ready\r\nto give up their slaves, they should receive those who were of\r\nmilitary age. Many offers were made, and Cato, after telling them to\r\nenrol every man who was willing, retired. Shortly after there came to\r\nhim letters from Juba and Scipio; from Juba, who was hid in a mountain\r\nwith a few men, asking him what he had resolved to do; and that if\r\nCato left Utica he would wait for him, and if he stood a siege he\r\nwould come to aid him with an army; from Scipio, who was in a vessel\r\noff a certain point not far from Utica, and waiting with the same\r\nviews.\r\n\r\nLXI. Accordingly Cato determined to detain the letter-carriers till he\r\nhad confirmed the resolution of the three hundred. For the senators\r\nwere zealous, and immediately manumitted their slaves, and set about\r\narming them. But with respect to the three hundred, inasmuch as they\r\nwere men engaged in maritime affairs and money lending, and had the\r\nchief part of their substance in slaves, the words of Cato stood no\r\nlong time in them, but oozed out, just as bodies which have a great\r\ndegree of rarity easily receive heat and again part with it, being\r\ncooled when the fire is removed; in like manner Cato, while they saw\r\nhim, fanned the flame and warmed those men; but when they began to\r\nreflect by themselves, the fear of Cæsar drove out of them all regard\r\nto Cato and to honour. \"Who are we,\" said they, \"and who is the man\r\nwhose commands we are refusing to obey? Is not this Cæsar, to whom the\r\nwhole power of the Romans has been transferred? and not one of us is a\r\nScipio, nor a Pompeius, nor a Cato. But at a time when all men by\r\nreason of fear are humbled in mind more than is fitting, at such a\r\ntime shall we fight in defence of the liberty of the Romans, and\r\ncontend in Utica against a man before whom Cato with Pompeius Magnus\r\nfled and gave up Italy; and shall we manumit our slaves to oppose\r\nCæsar, we who have only as much freedom as he shall choose to give?\r\nNo, even yet, miserable wretches, let us know our own weakness, and\r\ndeprecate the conqueror, and send persons to supplicate him.\" This was\r\nwhat the most moderate among the three hundred recommended; but the\r\nmajority were forming a design on the senatorial class, with the hope\r\nthat, if they seized them, they would pacify Cæsar's rage against\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nLXII. Though Cato suspected the change, he took no notice of it.\r\nHowever he wrote to Scipio and Juba to tell them to keep away from\r\nUtica, because he distrusted the three hundred, and he sent off the\r\nletter-carriers. But the horsemen who had escaped from the battle, no\r\ncontemptible number, riding up to Utica, sent to Cato three men, who\r\ndid not bring the same message from all; for one party was bent on\r\ngoing to Juba, another wished to join Cato, and a third was afraid of\r\nentering Utica. Cato on hearing this ordered Marcus Rubrius to observe\r\nthe three hundred and quietly to receive the registrations of those\r\nwho manumitted their slaves without forcing any one; and himself\r\ntaking the senatorial men went out of Utica, and meeting with the\r\ncommanders of the cavalry he besought them not to betray so many Roman\r\nsenators, nor to choose Juba for their commander in place of Cato but\r\nto secure their own safety and that of the rest by coming into a city\r\nwhich could not be taken by storm, and contained both corn and other\r\nresources for many years. The senatorial men joined in this prayer and\r\nwept; and the commanders conferred with the cavalry, while Cato sat\r\ndown on a mound with the senatorial men and waited for the answer.\r\n\r\nLXIII. In the meantime Rubrius came in a passion, charging the three\r\nhundred with great disorder and tumult, inasmuch, as they were falling\r\noff and disturbing the city. On which the rest, altogether despairing,\r\nfell to weeping and lamentation, but Cato attempted to cheer them, and\r\nsent to the three hundred and bade them wait. But the representatives\r\non the part of the horsemen came with no reasonable requisitions: for\r\nthey said that they neither wanted Juba for their pay-master, nor were\r\nthey afraid of Cæsar if they had Cato to command them, but it was a\r\ndangerous thing to shut themselves up with the citizens of Utica, who\r\nwere Phœnicians and an inconstant people; and if they should keep\r\nquiet now, they would set upon them and betray them, when Cæsar came.\r\nIf then any man wanted their aid in war and their presence, he must\r\neject or kill all the people of Utica, and then invite them into a\r\ncity free from enemies and barbarians. Cato considered this to be an\r\nexcessively savage and barbarous proposal, but he answered mildly and\r\nsaid that he would consult with the three hundred. When he had\r\nreturned into the city he found the men no longer making pretexts or\r\nevasions out of respect to him, but openly complaining that any one\r\nshould force them to fight with Cæsar when they were neither able nor\r\nwilling. Some even whispered with respect to the senatorial men, that\r\nthey ought to keep them in the city, since Cæsar was near. Cato let\r\nthis pass as if he did not hear it, and indeed he was somewhat deaf;\r\nbut when one came up to him and reported that the horsemen were going\r\naway, Cato, fearing that the three hundred might do something\r\ndesperate to the senatorial men, got up with his friends and set out\r\nwalking; but observing that they had already advanced some distance,\r\nhe seized a horse and rode to them. The horsemen were glad to see him\r\napproach, and received him and urged him to save himself with them.\r\nThen it is said that Cato even shed tears, beseeching on behalf of the\r\nsenatorial men and holding forth his hands, and turning back the\r\nhorses of some and laying hold of their arms, until he prevailed on\r\nthem to abide there for that day at least, and secure the senatorial\r\nmen in their flight.\r\n\r\nLXIV. When Cato arrived with the horsemen, and had posted some at the\r\ngates, and had delivered the citadel to others to watch, the three\r\nhundred, who were afraid that they should be punished for their\r\nchange, sent to Cato and prayed him by all means to come to them. But\r\nthe senatorial men crowding round him would not let him go, and they\r\ndeclared that they would not give up their guardian and saviour to\r\nfaithless men and traitors. For a most lively perception, as it\r\nappears, and affection and admiration of Cato's virtue had been\r\nimplanted in all alike who were in Utica, inasmuch as nothing spurious\r\nor deceitful was mingled with what he did. And as the man had long\r\nresolved to kill himself, he laboured with prodigious toil, and had\r\ncare and pain on behalf of others, in order that after placing all in\r\nsafety he might be released from life. For his resolution to die was\r\nno secret, though he said nothing. Accordingly he complied with the\r\nwish of the three hundred after comforting the senatorial men, and he\r\nwent alone to the three hundred, who thanked him, and prayed him to\r\nemploy them and trust them in everything else, and if they are not\r\nCatos, and not capable of the lofty mind of Cato, he should have pity\r\non their weakness; and as they had determined to supplicate Cæsar and\r\nto send to him, on Cato's behalf chiefly and for him first of all they\r\nwould prefer their prayer; and if they could not prevail on Cæsar,\r\nneither would they receive the grace if it were offered to themselves,\r\nbut so long as they breathed would fight for him. In reply to this\r\nCato commended their good intentions, but said that they ought for\r\ntheir own safety's sake to send quickly, and not to offer any petition\r\non his behalf, for entreaty belonged to the vanquished, and\r\ndeprecation of vengeance to those who were wrongdoers; that he had not\r\nonly been unvanquished all through life, but that he was victorious as\r\nfar as he chose to be, and had the superiority over Cæsar in things\r\nhonourable and just, and that Cæsar was the party who was captured\r\nand conquered; for what he used to deny that he was doing against his\r\ncountry long ago, he was now convicted of and detected therein.\r\n\r\nLXV. Having thus spoken to the three hundred he went away, and hearing\r\nthat Cæsar at the head of all his army was already on his march, \"Ha!\"\r\nsaid he, \"he considers that he has to deal with men;\" and turning to\r\nthe senators he urged them not to delay, but to make their escape\r\nwhile the horsemen were still staying there. He also closed the gates,\r\nexcept one that led to the sea, where he assigned vessels to those\r\nunder his command and preserved order by stopping wrong-doing and\r\nsettling disturbances, and supplying with stores those who were ill\r\nprovided. And when Marcus Octavius[751] with two legions had encamped\r\nnear, and had sent a message to Cato, in which he called on Cato to\r\ncome to some terms with him about the command, Cato gave him no\r\nanswer, but he said to his friends, \"Do we wonder why our affairs are\r\nruined, when we see that love of power abides among us even when we\r\nare in the midst of ruin?\" In the mean time hearing that the horsemen,\r\nas they were leaving the city, were pillaging and plundering the\r\npeople of Utica, as if their property was booty, Cato hurried to them\r\nas fast as he could run, and took the plunder from the first that he\r\nmet with, and the rest made haste to throw it away or set it down on\r\nthe ground, and all of them for very shame retired in silence and with\r\ndowncast looks. Cato having called together the people of Utica in the\r\ncity, entreated them not to irritate Cæsar against the three hundred,\r\nbut to unite altogether to secure their safety. Then again betaking\r\nhimself to the sea he inspected the persons who were embarking, and\r\nall his friends and acquaintance whom he could persuade to go away, he\r\nembraced and accompanied to the shore. But he did not recommend his\r\nson to take shipping, nor did he think it his duty to turn him from\r\nhis purpose of sticking to his father. There was one Statyllius, in\r\nyears a young man, but one who aimed at being resolute in character\r\nand an imitator of the indifference of Cato. This man Cato entreated\r\nto embark, for he was notoriously a hater of Cæsar; and-when he would\r\nnot go, Cato looking on Apollonides the Stoic and Demetrius the\r\nPeripatetic said--\"It is your business to soften this stubborn man and\r\nto fashion him to his own interests.\" But Cato himself was busied all\r\nthe night and the greatest part of the following day in assisting the\r\nrest in making their escape and helping those who wanted his aid.\r\n\r\nLXVI. When Lucius Caæsar,[752] who was a kinsman of Cæsar, and about\r\nto go to him as ambassador on behalf of the three hundred, urged Cato\r\nto help him in devising some plausible speech which he should employ\r\non behalf of the three hundred, \"for on thy behalf,\" he continued, \"it\r\nis becoming for me to touch the hands and to fall down at the knees of\r\nCæsar,\" Cato would not allow him to do this, and said, \"For my part,\r\nif I wished to save my life by Cæsar's favour, I ought to go to him\r\nmyself. But I do not choose to thank a tyrant for his illegal acts;\r\nand he acts illegally in sparing as master those whom he has no right\r\nto lord it over. However, if you please, let us consider how you shall\r\nget pardon for the three hundred.\" After talking with Lucius on this\r\nmatter he presented his son and his friends to him as he was\r\ndeparting, and after accompanying him some distance and taking leave\r\nof him he returned home, and then calling together his son and his\r\nfriends he spoke on many subjects, among which he forbade his son to\r\nmeddle in political matters, for, he said, circumstances no longer\r\nallowed him to act as befitted a Cato, and to act otherwise was base.\r\nAt evening he went to the bath. While he was bathing, he remembered\r\nStatyllius, and calling out aloud he said, \"Apollonides, have you sent\r\nStatyllius away, and brought him down from his stubborn temper, and\r\nhas the man gone without even taking leave of us?\" \"By no means,\"\r\nreplied Apollonides, \"though we said much to him, but he is lofty and\r\nimmovable and says he will stay and do whatever you do.\" On this they\r\nsay that Cato smiled and replied, \"Well, this will soon be shown.\"\r\n\r\nLXVII. After taking the bath he supped in much company, still sitting\r\nas his fashion had been since the battle, for he never reclined except\r\nwhen he was sleeping; and there were at supper with him all his\r\nfriends and the magistrates of Utica. After supper the drinking went\r\non with much gaiety and enjoyment, one philosophical subject after\r\nanother taking its turn, till at last the enquiry came round to the\r\nso-called paradoxes of the Stoics, that the good man alone is free,\r\nand that all the bad are slaves. Hereupon the Peripatetic making\r\nobjections, as one might expect, Cato broke in with great vehemence,\r\nand with a loud tone and harsh voice maintained his discourse at great\r\nlength, and displayed wonderful energy, so that no one failed to\r\nobserve that he had resolved to end his life and relieve himself from\r\npresent troubles. Wherefore as there was silence and depression of\r\nspirits among all the company, after he had done speaking, with the\r\nview of cheering them up and diverting their suspicions, Cato again\r\nbegun to put questions and to express anxiety about the state of\r\naffairs, and his fears for those who had sailed away, and also for\r\nthose who were going through a waterless and barbarian desert.\r\n\r\nLXVIII. At the end of the entertainment he took his usual walk with\r\nhis friends after supper, and after giving the officers of the watch\r\nthe proper orders, he retired to his chamber, but he first embraced\r\nhis son and his friends with more than his usual expression of\r\nkindness, which again made them suspect what was going to happen. On\r\nentering his chamber and lying down he took Plato's dialogue on the\r\nSoul,[753] and when he had gone through the greater part of it, he\r\nlooked up over his head, and not seeing his sword hanging there, for\r\nhis son had caused it to be taken away while he was at supper, he\r\ncalled a slave and asked who had taken his sword. The slave made no\r\nanswer and Cato was again at the book, but after a short interval, as\r\nif he were in no haste or hurry, and was merely looking for his sword,\r\nhe bade the slave bring it. As there was some delay and nobody brought\r\nit, after having read the dialogue through he again called his slaves\r\none by one, and raising his voice demanded his sword; and striking the\r\nmouth of one of them with his fist he bruised his hand, being in a\r\ngreat passion and calling out aloud that he was surrendered\r\ndefenceless to the enemy by his son and his slaves, till at last his\r\nson ran in weeping with his friends, and embracing him fell to\r\nlamentations and entreaties. But Cato rising up looked sternly and\r\nsaid, \"When and where have I been proved, and without knowing it, to\r\nhave lost my reason, that no one instructs me or teaches me in the\r\nmatters wherein I am judged to have determined ill, but I am hindered\r\nfrom using my own reasonings and am deprived of my weapons? Why don't\r\nyou put your father in chains also, generous son, and his hands behind\r\nhis back, till Cæsar shall come and find me unable even to defend\r\nmyself? For I need not a sword to kill myself, when it is in my power\r\nto die by holding my breath for a short time and giving my head a\r\nsingle blow against the wall.\"\r\n\r\nLXIX. As he said this the youth went out weeping, and all the rest,\r\nexcept Demetrius and Apollonides, to whom when they were left by\r\nthemselves Cato begun to speak in milder terms, and said, \"I suppose\r\nyou too have resolved by force to keep alive a man of my age and to\r\nsit here in silence and to watch him, or are you come to prove that it\r\nis neither a shocking nor a shameful thing for Cato, when he has no\r\nother way to save his life, to wait for mercy from his enemy? Why then\r\ndo you not speak and convince me of this and teach me a new doctrine,\r\nthat we may cast away those former opinions and reasons in which we\r\nlived together, and being made wiser through Cæsar owe him the greater\r\nthanks for it? And yet for my part I have come to no resolve about\r\nmyself, but it is necessary that when I have resolved I have power to\r\ndo what I have determined. And I will deliberate in a manner together\r\nwith you, deliberating with the reasons which even you in your\r\nphilosophy follow. Go away then in good heart and tell my son not to\r\nforce his father when he cannot persuade him.\"\r\n\r\nLXX. Upon this Demetrius and Apollonides without making any reply\r\nretired weeping. The sword was sent in by a child, and when Cato\r\nreceived it he drew it and looked at it. Seeing that the point was\r\nentire and the edge preserved, he said, \"Now I am my own master,\" and\r\nlaying the sword down, he began reading the book again, and he is said\r\nto have read it through twice.[754] He then fell into so sound a sleep\r\nthat those who were outside the chamber were aware of it, and about\r\nmidnight he called his freedmen Cleanthes the physician and Butas whom\r\nhe employed chief of all in public matters. He sent Butas to the sea\r\nto examine if all had set sail and to report to him, and he presented\r\nhis hand to the physician to tie it up, as it was inflamed from the\r\nblow which he gave the slave. And this made them all more cheerful,\r\nfor they thought that Cato was inclined to live. In a little time\r\nButas came and reported that all had set sail except Crassus,[755] who\r\nwas detained by some business, and that even he was now all but on\r\nboard, and that a violent storm and wind prevailed at sea. Cato\r\nhearing this groaned for pity of those who were at sea and he sent\r\nButas again to the sea, to learn if any one were driven back and\r\nwaited any necessaries, and to let him know. And now the birds were\r\nbeginning to sing,[756] and he sank asleep again for a while. When\r\nButas had returned and reported that all was quiet about the ports,\r\nCato, bidding him close the door, threw himself on the bed as if he\r\nwere going to sleep for the rest of the night. When Butas had gone\r\nout, he drew the sword and thrust it beneath his chest, but as he used\r\nhis hand with less effect owing to the inflammation, he did not\r\nimmediately despatch himself, and having some difficulty in dying he\r\nfell from the bed and made a noise by overturning a little abacus of\r\nthe geometrical kind that stood by, which his attendants perceiving\r\ncalled out and his son and his friends immediately ran in. Seeing him\r\nsmeared with blood and the greater part of his bowels protruding,\r\nthough he was still alive and his eyes were open, they were all\r\ndreadfully alarmed, and the physician going up to him attempted to\r\nreplace his bowels, which remained uninjured, and to sew up the wound.\r\nBut when Cato recovered and saw this, he pushed the physician away,\r\nand tearing the bowels with his hands and at the same time rending the\r\nwound he died.[757] LXXI. In a space of time which one would not have\r\nthought enough for all in the house to have heard of the event, there\r\nwere present at the door the three hundred, and soon after the people\r\nof Utica were assembled, with one voice calling Cato benefactor and\r\nsaviour and the only free man, the only unvanquished. And this they\r\ndid though it was told that Cæsar was advancing; but neither fear nor\r\nsubserviency towards the conqueror nor their mutual differences and\r\nquarrels dulled them towards doing honour to Cato. They decorated the\r\nbody in splendid style, and made a pompous procession and interred him\r\nnear the sea, where a statue of him now stands with a sword in his\r\nhand, and then they began to think how they should save themselves and\r\ntheir city.\r\n\r\nLXXII. Cæsar hearing from those who came to him that Cato was staying\r\nin Utica and not flying away, and that he was sending off the rest,\r\nwhile himself and his companions and his son were fearlessly going\r\nabout, thought it difficult to ascertain the intentions of the man,\r\nbut as he made most account of him he advanced with his force by quick\r\nmarches. When he heard of his death, it is reported that he said this,\r\n\"Cato, I grudge thee thy death, for thou hast grudged me thy safety.\"\r\nFor in fact if Cato had submitted to receive his life from Cæsar, he\r\nwould not have been considered to have lowered his own fame so much as\r\nto have added to the splendour of Cæsar's. What would have been done\r\nis uncertain, but with respect to Cæsar the milder measures are more\r\nprobable.\r\n\r\nLXXIII. When Cato died he was fifty[758] years of age save two. His\r\nson[759] received no harm from Cæsar, but he is said to have been fond\r\nof pleasure and not free from blame with regard to women. In\r\nCappadocia he had as his host Marphadates, one of the royal family,\r\nwho possessed a handsome wife, and as Cato stayed longer with them\r\nthan was decent, he was satirized in such terms as these:\r\n\r\n     \"To-morrow Cato goes away, to-morrow thirty days.\"\r\n\r\nAnd:\r\n\r\n     \"Porcius and Marphadates, friends are two, but Psyche one.\"\r\n\r\nFor the wife of Marphadates was named Psyche (Soul). And again:\r\n\r\n     \"Of noble blood and splendid fame, Cato has a royal Soul.\"\r\n\r\nBut he blotted out and destroyed all such ill report by his death; for\r\nwhile fighting at Philippi against Cæsar and Antonius in defence of\r\nliberty, and the line was giving way, not deigning either to fly or to\r\nsecrete himself, but challenging the enemy and showing himself in\r\nfront of them and cheering on those who kept the ground with him he\r\nfell after exhibiting to his adversaries prodigies of valour. And\r\nstill more, the daughter of Cato being inferior neither in virtue nor\r\ncourage (for she was the wife of Brutus who killed Cæsar) was both\r\nprivy to the conspiracy and parted with life in a manner worthy of her\r\nnoble birth and merit, as is told in the Life of Brutus. Statyllius,\r\nwho said that he would follow Cato's example, was prevented indeed at\r\nthe time by the philosophers, though he wished to kill himself, but\r\nafterwards he showed himself most faithful to Brutus and most\r\nserviceable at Philippi, and there he died.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 653: Cato was a cognomen of the Porcia Gens, which was\r\nPlebeian. The name Cato was first given to M. Porcius Cato Censorius,\r\nwho was consul B.C. 195 and censor B.C. 184. The father of the Cato\r\nwhose life is here written was M. Porcius Cato, a Tribunus Plebis, who\r\nmarried Livia, a sister of the tribune M. Livius Drusus. This Cato,\r\nthe tribune, was the son of M. Porcius Cato Salonianus, who was the\r\nson of Cato the Censor. Cato the Censor was therefore the\r\ngreat-grandfather of the Cato whose life is here written. See the\r\n_Life of Cato the Censor_ by Plutarch, c. 24. 97. This Cato was born\r\nB.C. 95.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 654: The text of Plutarch says that Livius Drusus was the\r\nuncle of Cato's mother, but this is a mistake, and accordingly\r\nXylander proposed to read [Greek: theio men onti pros tês mêtros] θείο\r\nμὲν ὄντι πρὸς τῆς μητρός. But Sintenis supposes that Plutarch may have\r\nmisunderstood the Roman expression \"avunculus maternus.\" Cato's father\r\nhad by his wife Livia a daughter Porcia, who married J. Domitius\r\nAhenobarbus. Livia's second husband was Q. Servilius Cæpio, by whom\r\nshe had a son Q. Servilius Cæpio, whom Plutarch calls Cato's brother,\r\nand two daughters, named Servilia, one of whom married M. Junius\r\nBrutus, the father of the Brutus who was one of Cæsar's assassins, and\r\nthe other married L. Licinius Lucullus (Life of Lucullus. c. 38).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 655: The word is [Greek: anamnêstikous] ἀναμνηστικούς. The\r\nmeaning of Plutarch is perhaps not quite clear. See the note in\r\nSchaefer's edition.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 656: These were the Roman Socii, or Italian states, which\r\nwere in a kind of alliance with and subordination to Rome. They had to\r\nfurnish troops for the wars, and to share the burdens of the Roman\r\nState in return for which they claimed the citizenship (Life of\r\nMarius, c. 32).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 657: Or Silo (Life of Marius, c. 33).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 658: There is obviously an error here in Plutarch's text, as\r\nSintenis observes. The real meaning of what Pompædius said appears\r\nfrom the context, and from a passage of Valerius Maximus (3. 1, 2),\r\nwho tells the same story.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 659: This sham fight was according to an old tradition\r\nestablished by Æneas.

These games (ludi) were also celebrated under the early Emperors.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 660: The text is literally \"a place for the impious,\" not\r\n_the_ place.

The effect of this political institution was more extensive\r\nthan at first sight may appear, but the examination of such a question\r\nbelongs, as Plutarch sometimes observes, to another place.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 662: He is mentioned by Cicero (_De Offic._ ii. 24), but\r\nsome suppose that there were two Tyrian philosophers of that name.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 663: See Plutarch's Life of Cato the Censor, c. 19. This,\r\nthe first Roman Basilica, was erected B.C. 182 (Livy, 39. c. 44).

The lowest cast was four\r\npoints, and it was called Canis. This is one explanation.

It is said that sometimes they\r\nplayed with four-sided dice, sometimes with six-sided. The subject is\r\nsomewhat obscure, and the investigation not suited to all people.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 665: Probably C. Memmius Gemellus, tribune of the Plebs,\r\nB.C. 66. See the Life of Lucullus, c. 37.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 666: This was Q. Cæcilius Metellus Pius Scipio, the son of\r\nP. Cornelius Scipio Nasica, prætor B.C. 94. He was the adopted son of\r\nQ.

This rival of Cato was the Metellus who was defeated by\r\nCæsar at the battle of Thapsus, and is often mentioned in this Life.\r\nIt is not said what legal process Cato could have instituted for the\r\nloss of his promised marriage.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 667: This Greek poet, who was probably born about the close\r\nof the eighth century B.C. at Paros, was noted for his biting Iambics,\r\nwhich became proverbial.\r\n\r\n     \"Archilochum proprio rabies armavit iambo.\"\r\n\r\nHORAT. _Ars Poet._, v. 79.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 668: This was of course a gentile name.

As to Gellius, see the Life of\r\nCrassus, c. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 671: Nomenclators, literally, \"persons who called or\r\naddressed others by name,\" were slaves and sometimes perhaps other\r\npersons, whose business it was to know every man's name, to attend a\r\ncandidate in his canvass, and to inform him of the names of those whom\r\nhe was going to address, in order that he might appear to be\r\nacquainted with them; for in accordance with a feeling, which all men\r\nhave in some degree, a desire to be known, a voter was pleased to find\r\nhimself addressed by a candidate as if his face and name were\r\nfamiliar. This kind of notice from people who are above another in\r\nrank and station is peculiarly gratifying to those who are conscious\r\nthat they have no real merit, and the pleasure which such attention\r\ngives to those who receive it is the exact measure of their own real\r\nopinion of their insignificance. I say their real opinion, for such\r\npersons have a true opinion of themselves, though they attempt to\r\nconceal it from themselves, and also to conceal it from others, in\r\nneither of which attempts are they quite successful. It makes no\r\ndifference if a man knows that the great man who affects to know him\r\nreally does not know him, for he knows that the great man does not\r\nknow everybody and cares for very few; but the mere pretence of\r\nknowing, the mere show of knowing and recognising, which the great man\r\nassumes, he is willing to take for what he knows that it is not, a\r\nmark of respect; and mainly, that others, as he hopes, may be deceived\r\nby the false appearance, and take him to be what he knows that he is\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nCato's tribuneship was a military tribuneship (tribunus militum).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 672: He was a native of Tarsus in Cilicia, and at the time\r\nof Cato's visit to him he had the care of the library at Pergamus.\r\nStrabo (p. 674, ed. Casaub.) says that he died in Cato's house at\r\nRome.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 673: Ænus was a small town at the mouth of the river Hebrus,\r\nnow the Maritza. The island of Thasos, now Thaso, contains marble. The\r\nmonument was a costly memorial, if the Attic talent was meant, which\r\nwe must presume. Talents of silver are of course intended.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 674: The allusion is to the Anticato of Cæsar (Life of\r\nCæsar, c. 54). How the matter really was, no one can tell; but such a\r\nstory is not likely to be a pure invention.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 675: He is mentioned as being an old man in B.C. 54 (Life of\r\nCrassus c. 17). Deiotarus was a friend of the Romans in their Asiatic\r\nwars against Mithridates, and the senate conferred on him the title of\r\nking. He knew what kind of people he had to deal with when he showed\r\nsuch attention to Cato's train (c. 15). His history is closely\r\nconnected with that of Cæsar, and of Cicero, who made a speech in his\r\ndefence before Cæsar at Rome B.C. 45 (Pro Rege Deiotaro).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 676: The story about Demetrius, the contemptible favourite\r\nof Pompeius, is told by Plutarch in his Life of Pompeius, c. 40.\r\nPlutarch makes the visit to Asia precede Cato's quæstorship, upon\r\nwhich see the remarks of Drumann, _Geschichte Roms_, v. 157. The\r\nnarration of Plutarch is evidently confused as will appear from the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth chapters.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 677: Either C.

Cato\r\nhinted that the officers of the Court would turn Catulus out, if he\r\ncontinued to act as he did. Plutarch has told the same story in his\r\ntreatise [Greek: peri dusopias] περὶ δυσοπίας, _De Vitioso Pudore_ c.\r\n13, to which Kaltwasser refers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 682: He may be C.

He was\r\nprobably the husband of Servilia at this time.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 690: Short-hand writers were called by the Romans \"actuarii\"\r\nand \"notarii,\" of which last word Plutarch's word ([Greek:\r\nsêmeiographoi] σημειόγραφοι) is a translation.

His\r\nauthority for the Life of Cato was, as it appears, Munatius Rufus, who\r\naccompanied Cato to Cyprus (c. 37).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 693: Quintus Hortensius was consul B.C. 69, a distinguished\r\norator and a man of refined and luxurious habits. Bibulus is M.\r\nCalpurnius Bibulus, the colleague of Cæsar in his consulship B.C. 59.\r\nHe had three sons by Porcia, Cato's daughter by Atilia.\r\n\r\nThis transfer of Marcia is oddly told by Plutarch. It was not a mere\r\ncase of lending the woman for the purpose of procreation, for the\r\nchild of Hortensius could not be his legal child, unless Marcia became\r\nhis legal wife. Cato must accordingly have divorced his wife, which\r\nwas done at Rome without any trouble. The only thing then that is\r\npeculiar in the affair is, that Cato did not divorce his wife because\r\nhe was dissatisfied with her on good grounds, nor for such grounds as\r\nCicero divorced his wife, but for the reason mentioned in the text.\r\nMarcia continued to be the wife of Hortensius till his death. The\r\nmarriage with Hortensius probably took place about B.C. 56.\r\n\r\nThis affair has caused the critics much difficulty. But as we may\r\nassume that Hortensius wished to have a child that would be his own,\r\nwhich is in fact Plutarch's statement, and one that would be in his\r\npaternal power, he must have married Marcia, and Cato must have\r\ndivorced her in proper form. The fact of Philippus giving his daughter\r\naway shows that she was then at his disposal. Cato married her again,\r\nand his conduct proved that he trusted her. The notion of Cato lending\r\nhis wife would have been as inconsistent with legal principle and\r\nmorality in Rome as such a transaction would be in England.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 694: Compare the Life of Cæsar, c. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 695: Pompeius was now in Asia.

The story is told in the Life of Marius, c.\r\n29. The matters referred to in this and the following chapter are told\r\ncircumstantially by Dion Cassius (38, c. 1-7). See Life of Cæsar, c.\r\n14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 705: L. Calpurnius Piso, the father of Calpurnia the wife of\r\nCæsar, and Aulus Gabinius were consuls B.C. 58. Aulus Gabinius, when\r\nTribunus Plebis B.C. 67, proposed the law which gave Pompeius the\r\ncommand against the pirates. The meaning of the obscure allusion at\r\nthe end of the chapter, which is literally rendered, may be collected\r\nfrom the context; and still more plainly from the abuse which Cicero\r\nheaps on Gabinius for his dissolute life after he had been banished in\r\nthe consulship of Gabinius (Drumann, _Gabinii_, p. 60).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 706: This Ptolemæus, the brother of Ptolemæus Auletes, King\r\nof Egypt, was now in possession of Cyprus, and the mission of Cato,\r\nwhich could not be to his taste, was to take possession of the island\r\nfor the Romans. When Clodius had been made prisoner by the pirates\r\nnine years before, Ptolemæus was asked to contribute to his ransom but\r\nhe only sent two talents, for which ill-timed saving he was mulcted in\r\nhis whole kingdom by this unprincipled tribune (Drumann, _Claudii_, p.\r\n263).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 707: He is called Caninius in the Life of Brutus, c. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 708: The feeble king had not spirit to attempt a resistance,\r\nwhich indeed would have been useless. He put an end to himself by\r\npoison (c. 36), and the Romans took the island. A more unjustifiable\r\nact of aggression than the occupation of Cyprus, hardly occurs even in\r\nthe history of Rome.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 709: The priesthood of such temples as Paphos was a valuable\r\nthing. These temples had lands and slaves.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 710: This was Auletes, the father of Cleopatra. He was\r\nrestored to his kingdom by A. Gabinius B.C. 55, while he was governor\r\nof Syria.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 711: This is the meaning of the passage. The interview was\r\nludicrous enough, but Dacier makes it still more so, by seating Cato\r\non a close-stool; and Kind and Schirach, two German translators, make\r\nhim receive the king in the same way (Kaltwasser's note).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 712: This was M. Junius Brutus, afterwards Cæsar's friend\r\nand assassin. Cato could not have found a better man for his purpose;\r\nat least for laying his hands on all that came in his way. Brutus took\r\nthe opportunity of helping himself to some of the plunder in his\r\nuncle's absence. At a later time he had large sums out at interest in\r\nCyprus and partly in other persons' names. He was a merciless usurer.\r\n(Cicero, _Ad Attic._, v. 18 and 21; vi. 21; and the Life of Cicero, c.\r\n36, notes.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 713: Plutarch explains in a general way what is meant. The\r\nRoman word \"pignus,\" which Plutarch translates by [Greek: enechyra]\r\nἐνέχυρα, means a thing pawned and delivered as a security to the\r\npawnee. To take pledges, \"pignora capere,\" was to seize something that\r\nbelonged to a man in order to compel the discharge of a duty. It was\r\nlike a distress for a service. Instances occur in Livy (3. c. 38, 37.\r\nc. 51; Cicero, _De Oratore_, 3. c. 1).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 714: The Greek nominative would be Barcas. The name does not\r\nappear to be Roman and is probably corrupted. Bursa is a Roman name.\r\nSee c. 48.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 715: There is no suspicion that Cato got anything for\r\nhimself. He was above that. He honestly discharged his dishonest\r\nmission.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 716: This was a port of Corinth on the east side of the\r\nIsthmus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 717: The amazement of the people at the quantity of the\r\nplunder, and the thanks of the Senate for the faithful discharge of\r\ntheir order to pillage, might seem regular enough if it had been booty\r\ngotten in war. But the robbery was not gilded with this false show. It\r\nwas pure, simple robbery without the accessories of war.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 718: This means a prætorship before the age at which a man\r\ncould regularly hold the office. Cato returned from Cyprus in B.C. 56.\r\nHe was now thirty-eight years of age, for he died B.C. 46, when he was\r\nforty-eight.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 719: The order of the words in the original makes the\r\nmeaning appear somewhat ambiguous. The passage might be translated, as\r\nit is by Dacier, \"for the colleague of Philippus paid no less respect\r\nto Cato on account of his merit, than Philippus did on account of his\r\nrelationship.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 720: Cicero returned from exile B.C. 57, in the month of\r\nSeptember of the unreformed calendar.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 721: This was the meeting at Luca in B.C. 56. See the Life\r\nof Pompeius, c. 51; and the Life of Cæsar, c. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 722: This was the second consulship of each, and was in B.C.\r\n55. Cato lost the prætorship, and Vatinius was elected instead of him\r\n(Dion Cassius (39, c. 32).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 723: As to Caius Trebonius, see the Life of Pompeius, c.\r\n52.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 724: One would suppose that a less time would have been more\r\nthan enough, though not for Cato. Dion Cassius (39. c. 31) says that\r\nFavonius spoke for an hour before Cato did, and took up all the time\r\nin complaining of the shortness of his allowance. It would be a fair\r\ninference that he had little to say against the measure itself.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 725: Dion Cassius (39. c. 35) tells us more particularly how\r\nit happened that P. Aquilius Gallus was in the senate house. Gallus\r\nwas afraid that he should be excluded from the Forum the next day, and\r\naccordingly he passed the night in the senate house, both for safety's\r\nsake and to be ready on the spot in the morning. But Trebonius, who\r\nfound it out, kept him shut up for that night and the greater part of\r\nthe following day.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 726: Cato was prætor in B.C. 54. It does not appear that he\r\never was prætor before, and it is not therefore clear what is meant by\r\nthe \"extraordinary prætorship\" (c. 39). In place of the word \"Rostra,\"\r\nin the fifth line of this chapter, read \"tribunal.\" Plutarch uses the\r\nsame word ([Greek: bêma] βῆμα) for both, which circumstance is\r\ncalculated occasionally to cause a translator to make a slip, even\r\nwhen he knows better. The \"tribunal\" was the seat of the prætor, when\r\nhe was doing justice. But lower down (line 8 from the bottom) Rostra\r\nis the proper translation of Plutarch's word ([Greek: epilabesthai tôn\r\nembolon] ἐπιλαβέσθαι τῶν ἐμβόλον) and it was the place from which Cato\r\nspoke, after he had got up. In c. 43, when Cato gets up to speak,\r\nPlutarch makes him mount the Bema ([Greek: bêma] βῆμα), by which he\r\nmeans the place when the orators stood at the Rostra. The Rostra were\r\nthe beaks of the Antiate galleys, with which, it is said, this place\r\nwas ornamented at the close of the Latin war (Livy, 8, c. 14).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 727: The reason according to Plutarch why people envy the\r\nman who has a high reputation for integrity, is because of the power\r\nand credit which it gives. Whatever then gives power and credit should\r\nbe also an object of envy, as wealth; and so it is. The notion of envy\r\nimplies a desire to see the person who is the object of it humbled and\r\ncast down. The Greeks attributed this feeling to their gods, who\r\nlooked with an evil eye on great prosperity, and loved to humble it.\r\nBut the feeling of envy, if that is the right term, towards him who\r\nhas power and credit by reason of his high character for integrity, is\r\nnot the same feeling as envy of the wealthy man. The envious of wealth\r\ndesire to have the wealth both for itself and for its uses. The\r\nenvious of character desire to have the opinion of the character,\r\nbecause of the profit that is from it, but they may not desire to have\r\nthat which is the foundation of the character. If they did, their\r\ndesire would be for virtue, and the envious feeling would not exist.\r\nCourage and wisdom are less objects of envy than good character or\r\nwealth, and perhaps, because most men feel that they are not capable\r\nof having the one or the other. The notion of envy implies that the\r\nperson has, or thinks he has, the same capability as another who has\r\nsomething which he has not. A man who is not a painter does not envy a\r\ngreat painter; a man who is a painter may envy a great painter. The\r\nmass may admire the honest man who is of higher rank than themselves,\r\neven if they have no regard for honesty; but they do not envy; they\r\nwonder as at something which is above them. But if the honest man is\r\nof their own station in life, and has a character of integrity, they\r\nmay envy him for his superiority. It appears that if there is a number\r\nof people who are generally on a footing of equality, any superiority\r\nwhich one may acquire over the rest, makes him an object of envy. If\r\nhigh character for integrity brings power and credit with it, there\r\nmust be some persons with whom the power and the credit prevail, but\r\nthese are the persons who are farthest removed from rivalry with him\r\nwho has the credit. Those who are nearer to him are the persons who\r\nenvy, who feel that the superiority of one man makes their\r\ninferiority. Plutarch assumes the existence of a class who love the\r\njust and give them credit, and of a class who envy them; but the two\r\nclasses of persons are not the same.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 728: This name recurs in the Symposium and Phædon of Plato.\r\nThe second sentence in this chapter is very corrupt in the original,\r\nand the translation is merely a guess at the meaning. Favonius was\r\nædile in B.C. 53 (Dion Cassius, 40. c. 45).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 729: Some apology is necessary for translating \"pears \"\r\n([Greek: apious] ἀπίους, in the original said to mean \"pears\") into\r\n\"parsley.\" The context shows clearly enough that pears are not meant.\r\nKaltwasser has made the \"pears\" into \"celery,\" and there is just as\r\ngood reason for making \"parsley\" of them. Plutarch may have\r\nmisunderstood the Roman word \"apium\" or confounded it with the Greek.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 730: Scipio was the father-in-law of Cornelia, the last wife\r\nof Pompeius (Life of Pompeius, c. 55). As to P. Plautus Hypsæus, see\r\nthe Life of Pompeius, c. 55. Titus Annius Milo afterwards killed\r\nClodius, and Cicero defended him on his trial (Life of Cicero, c.\r\n35).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 731: Pompeius was sole consul B.C. 53, for seven months,\r\nafter which he had his father-in-law Scipio as his colleague.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 732: T. Munatius Plancus Bursa was a tribune in B.C. 52.\r\nWhen Clodius was killed by Milo, the populace, who loved Clodius, took\r\nthe dead body into the Curia Hostilia, at the instigation of Bursa and\r\nhis colleague Rufus, and making a pile of the benches, burnt the body\r\nand the Curia with it (Dion Cassius, 40. c. 49, 55). Bursa was tried\r\nfor his share in this matter and convicted, to the great joy of\r\nCicero, who was his accuser. Cicero speaks of this affair in a letter\r\nto Marius (_Ad Diversos_, vii. 2).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 733: Servius Sulpicius Rufus, a friend of Cicero, who has\r\nrecorded his great talents, and a distinguished Jurist. He was consul\r\nin B.C. 51 with M. Claudius Marcellus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 734: Kaltwasser refers to the Life of Cæsar, c. 22, for an\r\nexplanation of the first part of this chapter; and to the Life of\r\nCæsar, c. 29, and to that of Pompeius, c. 58, for the transactions\r\nwhich are mentioned in the latter part of this chapter.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 735: Cæsar took Ariminum (Rimini) in B.C. 49. See the Life\r\nof Cæsar, c. 33, and the Life of Pompeius, c. 60.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 736: In South Italy, now Calabria Ultra. This Munatius was\r\nprobably Munatius Rufus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 737: In Cæsar's Anticato, which has often been mentioned. It\r\nseems that Cæsar raked up all that he could in Cato's life that was\r\nagainst him, and this affair of Marcia furnished him with plausible\r\nmatter. Hortensius died B.C. 50. Drumann remarks (_Porcii_, p. 198),\r\n\"that she lived, after the year 56, in which she reconciled Cato with\r\nMunatius Rufus, with the consent of Cato, with Hortensius, after whose\r\ndeath in the year 50 she returned into her former relation,\" that is,\r\nshe became again the wife of Cato. If so, Cato must have married her\r\nagain (see note, c. 25), as Plutarch says that he did. Drumann speaks\r\nas if Cato had a reversion of her, which became an estate in\r\npossession after the estate of Hortensius was determined by her\r\ndeath.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 738: The quotation is from the Hercules [Greek: Heraklês\r\nmainomenos] Ἡρακλῆς μαινόμενος of Euripides (v. 173), one of the\r\nextant plays.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 739: See Life of Cæsar, c. 72.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 740: Another allusion to the Anticato. It is difficult to\r\nsee what probable charge Cæsar could make of this circumstance. The\r\nmeaning of Plutarch may easily be conjectured (Drumann, _Porcii_, p.\r\n192).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 741: See the Life of Pompeius, c. 65; and the Life of Cæsar,\r\nc. 39.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 742: Cn. Pompeius, the elder son of Pompeius Magnus is\r\nmeant. It is conjectured that the word \"young\" ([Greek: neon] νέον)\r\nhas fallen out of the text (compare c. 58). He had been sent by his\r\nfather to get ships, and he arrived with an Egyptian fleet on the\r\ncoast of Epirus shortly before the battle of Pharsalus. On the news of\r\nthe defeat of Pompeius Magnus, the Egyptians left him (Dion Cassius,\r\n42. c. 12).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 743: He must also have seen Cornelia, for Sextus was with\r\nher. Life of Pompeius, c. 78.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 744: These people are described by Herodotus (iv. 173) as\r\nhaving been all destroyed by the sands of the deserts, and their\r\ncountry, which was on the Syrtis, being occupied by the Nasamones.\r\n\r\nLucan (_Pharsalia_, ix. 891) has made the Psylli occupy a conspicuous\r\nplace in the march of Cato.\r\n\r\n                      \"Gens unica terras\r\n    Incolit a sævo serpentum innoxia morsu,\r\n    Marmaridæ Psylli: par lingua potentibus herbis,\r\n    Ipse cruor tutus, nullumque admittere virus\r\n    Vel cantu cessante potest.\"\r\n\r\nSeven days is much too little for the march from Cyrene to the\r\nCarthaginian territory, and there is either an error in Plutarch's\r\ntext or a great error in his geography.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 745: The name Libya occurs four times in this chapter. Libya\r\nwas the general name for the continent, but the term did not include\r\nEgypt. In the first two instances in which the name occurs in this\r\nchapter, the word is used in the general sense. In the other two\r\ninstances it means the Roman province of Africa. Kaltwasser has used\r\nthe term Africa in all the four instances. It is immaterial which is\r\nused, if rightly understood in both cases.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 746: See the Life of Cæsar, c. 53, 54, 55, and the\r\nreferences in the notes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 747: See the Life of Antonius, c. 81.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 748: See the Life of Cæsar, c. 52, and Dion Cassius, 42, c.\r\n57. This Scipio was unworthy of the name and unequal to the times.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 749: The Greek writers represent the name in different ways.\r\nPlutarch writes [Greek: Itukê] Ἰτύκη. Dion Cassius writes it [Greek:\r\nOutikê] Οὐτική. This old Phœnician city was on the coast near the\r\nmouth of the river Bagradas; but its supposed remains are some\r\ndistance inland. (Shaw's _Travels in Barbary_, &c., p. 79, 4to.\r\nedition.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 750: See the Life of Cæsar, c. 53, and Dion Cassius, 43, c.\r\n7. The battle was fought in B.C. 46.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 751: The son of Cn. Octavius, who was consul B.C. 76. Marcus\r\nwas Curule Ædile B.C. 50. (Drumann, _Octavii_, p. 225.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 752: He was the son of L. Julius Cæsar, consul B.C. 64. The\r\nson was pardoned by Cæsar (_Bell. Afric._ c. 88, 89). Dion Cassius\r\n(43, c. 12) says that Cæsar first brought him to trial, but as he was\r\nunwilling to condemn him by his own authority, he privately got him\r\nput to death. The statement of Dion is deficient in precision,\r\nincredible by reason of Cæsar's well-known clemency, and the\r\ninsignificance of Lucius as an enemy, and not altogether reconcilable\r\nwith other authorities. (Drumann, _Julii_, p. 125.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 753: The Phædon which contains the last conversation of\r\nSocrates, and his death. The incident of the reading of the Dialogue,\r\nand the reflections which it suggested, have been used by Addison in\r\nhis frigid and bombastic tragedy of Cato.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 754: Kaltwasser quotes a note of Dacier who cannot conceive\r\nhow Cato could read so long a Dialogue through twice in so short a\r\ntime. It is equally a matter of wonder how any body could know that he\r\nread it through once. The fact that he had the book and was reading it\r\nis all that could be known. Another difficulty that is suggested by\r\nDacier is, that the Dialogue contains the strongest arguments against\r\nsuicide; but perhaps this difficulty is removed by the suggestion that\r\nin one passage it is said that a man should not kill himself till the\r\ndeity has sent a kind of necessity; and Cato might conceive, as he did\r\nconceive, that the necessity had come to him.\r\n\r\nThe suicide of Cato was a peculiar case and hardly belongs to the more\r\ngeneral cases of suicide. His position, if he had lived under the\r\ndomination of Cæsar, would have been intolerable to a man of his\r\nprinciples; for that he might have lived by Cæsar's grace, if he had\r\nchosen, can hardly be doubted notwithstanding Cæsar wrote his\r\nAnticatones.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 755: This was P. Licinius Crassus Junianus, a Junius who had\r\nbeen adopted by a Crassus, as the name shows.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 756: [Greek: êdê d' ornithes êdon] ήδη δ' ὄρνιθες ηδον. The\r\ntranslators do not agree about these words. Dacier and others\r\ntranslate them literally, as I have done. Kaltwasser translated them,\r\n\"and already the cocks crowed.\" He adds that the other translation is\r\nwrong, because it is said immediately after, that it was still night.\r\nBut what follows as to the night does not prove that it was dark; it\r\nrather implies that there was not much sleeping time that remained\r\nbefore morning. Cocks sometimes crow in the night, it is true, but\r\nPlutarch evidently means to show by the expression that the morning\r\nwas dawning, and so the birds might be singing, if there were any\r\nbirds in Utica. The matter is appropriate for a dissertation, which\r\nwould be as instructive as many other dissertations on matters of\r\nantiquity.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 757: Appian (_Civil Wars_, ii. 98, &c.) tells the story of\r\nhis death differently. He says that the wound was sewed up, and that\r\nbeing left alone, he tore his bowels out. But it is improbable that,\r\nif the wound had been sewed up, he would have been left alone. The\r\nstory of Dion Cassius (43, c. 11) is the same. See Florus, iv. 2, 71,\r\nwho says that he killed himself \"circa primam vigiliam.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 758: As he died in B.C. 46, he was in the forty-ninth year\r\nof his age. His chatacter requires no comment; it has been fully\r\ndelineated by Plutarch. A single letter of Cato to Cicero is extant\r\n(_Ad Diversos_, xv. 5); and a letter of such a man is worth reading,\r\nthough it be short. His speech against the conspirators, which Sallust\r\nhas given, may contain the matter, but not the words of Cato.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 759: He had his father's property. After Cæsar's death he\r\njoined M. Brutus, the husband of his sister Portia, and fell at\r\nPhilippi B.C. 42. This son of Cato had a younger brother (c. 52),\r\nwhose mother was Marcia, but nothing more is known of him. The death\r\nof the wife of Brutus is told in the Life of Brutus, c. 13, 53.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL. III.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON: PRINTED BY WM.
